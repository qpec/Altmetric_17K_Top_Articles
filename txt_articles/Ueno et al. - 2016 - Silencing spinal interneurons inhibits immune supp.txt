Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) at high spinal levels (e.g., above thoracic level 5) causes systemic 
immune suppression; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that 
profound plasticity develops within spinal autonomic circuitry below the injury, creating a 
sympathetic anti-inflammatory reflex, and that chemogenetic silencing of this reflex circuitry 
blocks post-SCI immune suppression. These data provide new insights and potential therapeutic 
options for limiting the devastating consequences of post-traumatic autonomic hyperreflexia and 
post-injury immune suppression.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) above the T5 spinal level removes brain stem control over spinal 
autonomic circuitry causing normally innocuous stimuli below the level of injury (e.g., 
bladder or bowel filling) to elicit exaggerated reflex activation of sympathetic preganglionic 
neurons (SPNs). In SCI mice and humans, eliciting a visceral-sympathetic reflex can 
provoke autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a potentially fatal clinical syndrome marked by 
paroxysmal hypertension1, 2. Recently, we found that intentional and spontaneous activation 
of this reflex also suppresses immune function3–5, potentially explaining why people with 
high-level SCI are more susceptible to infection – a leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
after SCI6. However, the neuronal substrate responsible for post-injury immune suppression 
has not been determined.

 T3 and T9 SCI remove or preserve, respectively, brainstem control over SPNs, and only after 
T3 SCI does sympathetic hyperreflexia develop with concomitant immune suppression3, 4. 
Accordingly, we first determined whether T3 and T9 SCI differentially affect the 
neuroanatomical substrate that connects the spinal cord with the spleen, a major secondary 
lymphoid organ. Consistent with previous reports3, T3 but not T9 SCI caused profound 
splenic atrophy and leucopenia (Supplemental Fig. 1). To map connections between spinal 
cord and spleen, trans-synaptic neurotropic retrograde GFP-expressing pseudorabies virus 
(PRV)7 was injected into spleens of uninjured (control) or SCI mice 28 days after a T3 or T9 
SCI. In control spinal cords, PRV-GFP+ cells were found ipsilateral to the intrasplenic 
injection (left side) within the lateral and intermediate gray matter at T4–9 spinal levels (Fig. 
1a, d, g, h, m–o; see also Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Such labeling 
is consistent with the location of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) previously 
shown to innervate rat spleen8. PRV-GFP+ cells were found in similar numbers and 
distribution in control mice and T9 SCI mice (Fig. 1b, e, I, j, m–o). Conversely, although 
total numbers of PRV-GFP+ cells within the lateral zone of the T4–T9 segment were similar 
after T3 SCI, they more than doubled in intermediate and medial zones of thoracic spinal 
cord and throughout lumbar and sacral spinal cord gray matter (Fig. 1c, f, k, l, m–o, 
Supplementary Fig. 3).
GFP+ neurons in the medial and intermediate zones after T3 SCI are likely interneurons that 
form new synapses with SPNs. To distinguish SPNs from transynaptically-labeled PRV-
GFP+ interneurons, fluorogold (FG), a retrograde tracer, was injected into the intraperitoneal 
cavity (Supplementary Fig. 4a)8, 9. SPNs of the splenic circuit were FG/PRV-GFP-double-
positive (FG+/PRV+), whereas interneurons do not label with FG (FG−/PRV+). In spinal 
cords from control and T9 SCI mice, FG+/PRV+ neurons were predominantly found in the 
lateral gray matter and were choline acetyltransferase-positive (CHAT+) (Fig. 2a–h). Few 
FG−/PRV+ interneurons were in intermediate or medial zones (Fig. 2a–h, arrows). However, 
after T3 SCI, the number of FG−/PRV+ interneurons more than doubled in the intermediate 
and medial zones (Fig. 2i–l (arrows), Fig. 2m).
We next examined the phenotype of these spinal interneurons. Glutamatergic excitatory or 
GABAergic/glycinergic inhibitory neurons were genetically labeled using Vglut2 (also 
known as Slc17a6)-Cre10; CAG-lox-CAT-lox-EGFP (cc-EGFP11) or Vgat (also known as 
Slc32a1)-Cre10; cc-EGFP mice, respectively. Most FG−/PRV+ interneurons were Vglut2-
GFP+ (44.0 ± 2.65% in T3 SCI; 29.2 ± 1.75% in controls) while fewer were CHAT+ (18.3 
± 2.15% in T3 SCI; 47.1 ± 6.45% in controls) or Vgat-GFP+ (9.88 ± 1.86 % in T3 SCI; 16.1 
± 0.87% in controls) (Fig. 2n–z, Supplementary Fig. 3n–q). Together, these data suggest that 
after T3 SCI, there is a preferential increase in connectivity between excitatory interneurons 
and SPNs. Consistent with this conclusion, we also observed a time-dependent increase in 
VGLUT2+ pre-synaptic puncta contacting FG+/PRV+ SPNs (Supplementary Fig. 4b–h).
To determine whether enhanced structural plasticity in the spinal-splenic circuit is inherently 
more sensitive to activation by visceral-sympathetic reflexes, expression of c-Fos, an 
activity-dependent immediate early gene, was quantified after eliciting colorectal distension 
(CRD) in T3 SCI mice. Similar to previous reports in SCI rats12, 13, CRD increased the 
number of c-Fos+ neurons throughout the intermediate and medial gray matter of SCI mice

 (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). Most c-Fos+ cells (>55%) were Vglut2+ interneurons; <20% 
were CHAT+ (Supplementary Fig. 5d–g).
We previously showed that both spontaneous and intentional activation of spinal autonomic 
reflexes cause immune suppression after T3 SCI3. To definitely prove a causal role for 
Vglut2+ or CHAT+ spinal interneurons in propagating immune suppressive autonomic 
reflexes, we silenced these neurons using chemogenetics14. Specifically, Gi/o-coupled 
human muscarinic M4 designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug (hM4Di 
DREADD) were expressed in Vglut2+ or CHAT+ neurons using an adeno-associated viral 
(AAV) vector. To target interneurons, AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry was injected 
into intermediate thoracic spinal cord gray matter of Vglut2-Cre or Chat-Cre mice at P14 
(Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 6). Six weeks later (P56), all mice received T3 SCI and then to 
silence neurons, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 1 mg/kg)14 was injected 2x/day from day 14–27 
post-injury (Fig. 3a), when exaggerated immune suppressive reflexes develop spontaneously 
in SCI mice3. The data reveal significant silencing of hM4DGi+ spinal neurons 
(Supplementary Fig. 7) with immune protection only in T3 SCI Vglut2-Cre mice injected 
with hM4Di DREADD and CNO. Splenic atrophy was reversed and total numbers of 
splenocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B220+ B cells, were restored to pre-
injury levels (Fig. 3b–g, Supplementary Fig. 8). Although the hM4Di DREADDs were 
effectively introduced into Chat+ interneurons, fewer Chat+ SPNs were positive for hM4Di-
mCherry as compared with interneurons located in the medial or intermediate zones (medial, 
38.6 ± 6.26 %; intermediate, 55.5 ± 5.17 %; lateral, 5.86 ± 1.54 %, n = 4: Supplementary 
Fig. 6f–i). Accordingly, only modest non-significant immune protection occurred in Chat-
Cre mice (Fig. 3c, d).
Data in this report reveal a novel neurogenic mechanism underlying immune suppression 
caused by high-level SCI. Specifically, retrograde trans-synaptic labeling from the spleen 
reveals that a new and complex intraspinal circuitry forms after SCI, presumably due to 
ongoing plasticity and synaptogenesis between primary sensory afferents, interneurons and 
SPNs in the spinal cord. The receptive field for activating this newly formed circuit expands 
beyond the thoracic spinal segments that normally innervate secondary lymphoid tissues in 
naïve/uninjured mice. As a result, after SCI, the spontaneous activation of spinal 
interneurons by visceral afferents (e.g., from bladder or bowel) causes exaggerated 
activation of SPNs and post-ganglionic neurons that innervate vasculature, viscera and 
lymphoid tissues (Supplementary Fig. 9). Engaging this circuitry activates a sympathetic 
anti-inflammatory reflex (SAR). Although we have previously shown that the immune 
suppressive effects of SAR can be mitigated by repeat injections of adrenergic receptor 
antagonists3, novel data in this manuscript show that immune protection can be achieved by 
“silencing” aberrant intraspinal circuitry. In humans, high-level SCI elicits spinal cord 
injury-induced immune depression syndrome (SCI-IDS), a level-dependent neurogenic 
mechanism of immune suppression that increases infectious complications (e.g., 
pneumonia)15. Thus, our model clinically relevant and the application of similar techniques 
in humans could eliminate SCI-IDS and significantly improve quality of life for those living 
with SCI. Since existing clinical data indicate that SCI-IDS develops without eliciting 
compensatory hematopoiesis6, 16, combinatorial approaches are needed that both silence the 
SAR and boost hematopoiesis and subsequent immune function.

  METHODS
All outcome measures were evaluated by individuals who were blind to the experimental 
group or individual manipulation.
 Animals
C57BL/6J (Jackson laboratory), Vglut2-Cre10, Vgat-Cre10, Chat-Cre17 and CAG-lox-CAT-
lox-EGFP (cc-EGFP11) mice (female, 8 weeks old) were used. Mutants were backcrossed 
with C57/BL/6J strain at least 3 generations. Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free 
environment in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee of the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. Total numbers of 
mice used for all studies in this report were: 116 C57BL/6J mice, 36 Vglut2-Cre mice 
(including wild-type littermate and Vglut2-Cre; cc-EGFP mice), 22 Chat-Cre mice 
(including wild-type littermate and Chat-Cre; cc-EGFP mice), and 8 Vgat-Cre mice 
(including Vgat-Cre; cc-EGFP mice).
 PRV tracing
Bartha strain PRV152 (expressing GFP; 4.9 × 109 pfu/ml7) and PRV614 (expressing RFP; 
3.9 × 109 pfu/ml18; gifts from Dr. Lynn Enquist, Princeton University) were used. Under 
abdominal surgery with anesthesia, PRV was injected into the spleen (10 sites, total 10 μl). 
Muscle and skin were then sutured. Animals were kept for indicated days and processed for 
histological analyses.
 Spinal cord injury
Adult female mice (8 weeks of age) were anesthetized with isoflurane. A laminectomy was 
performed to expose the spinal cord and complete transection was performed at T3 or T9 
level with iridectomy scissors and aspirator as previously described3. The muscle layers and 
skin on the back were then sutured and mice were injected with 1 ml of saline 
subcutaneously. They were placed in HEPA filtered cages (maximum 4 mice/cage) on the 
slide warmer at 37°C, under 12hr of light-dark cycle and fed commercial pellets and water 
ad libitum. Dehydration was monitored daily and manual bladder expression was conducted 
2× daily. A total of 105 mice received SCI. Of these, seven mice died of unknown causes 
before intended date of analyses and were therefore excluded from the experiments.
 Fluorogold tracing
One hundred μl of 0.4 % FG in distilled water (Fluorochrome) was injected intraperitoneally 
7 days before the perfusion.
 Immunohistochemistry
The animals were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Spinal cords 
were dissected and post-fixed in the same fixatives overnight at 4°C. The tissues were then 
cryopreserved in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight then embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT 
compound (Sakura Finetek). Fifty-μm-thick serial sections (for Fig. 1a–l, Supplementary 
Fig. 2 and 3a–i, k–m) or 20-μm-thick of every other section (for the other experiments) were

 made with a cryostat and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher). Sections for synapse 
counting (Supplementary Fig. 4) were incubated in PBS overnight after fixation, embedded 
in low-melting agarose gel then 80-μm-thick of floating sections were made with a 
vibrotome (Leica).
For immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/
0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 hr and then incubated with the following primary antibodies 
overnight at 4°C: sheep anti-GFP (1:1000; AbD Serotec, 4745-1051), rabbit anti-GFP 
(1:1000; Invitrogen, A11122), rat anti-GFP (1:1000; Nacalai, 04404-84), rabbit anti-RFP 
(Rockland, 1:1000, 600-401-379), rabbit anti-DsRed (1:500, Clontech, 632496), goat anti-
choline acetyltransferase (CHAT; 1:100; Millipore, AB144P), rat anti-CD45R (B220)-FITC 
(1:20; BD Biosciences, 553088), rabbit anti-fluorogold (1:500, Fluorochrome), guinea pig 
anti-VGLUT2 (1:10000, Millipore, AB2251), and goat anti-c-Fos antibodies (1:100, Santa 
cruz, sc-52G). After washing with 0.1% Tween20/PBS, the sections were incubated with 
corresponding secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488, 568, 647 or DyLight 549 donkey anti-
sheep, rabbit, rat, guinea pig or goat IgG (1:1000; Invitrogen, A11015, A21206, A10042, 
A31573, A21208, A11055, A11057, or Jackson ImmunoResearch, 706-505-148) for 2 hr at 
room temperature. For labeling vibrotome sections, tissues were incubated with primary or 
secondary antibody 3 overnights at 4°C. Images were acquired using a wide-field 
fluorescence (Zeiss, AXIO IMAGER Z1) or confocal microscope (Nikon A1R+).
 Quantification of PRV-positive neurons
To evaluate the normal neural-splenic circuit, brains and spinal cords were analyzed at 48 (n 
= 2 mice), 72 (n = 2 mice), 96 (n = 2 mice), 108 (n = 1 mouse), 120 (n = 2 mice), 144 (n = 3 
mice) or 168 hr (n = 2 mice) after PRV injection (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary 
Table 1). Specific regions of the brain were identified and mapped using the atlas by Paxinos 
and Franklin (2001)19. To verify that retrograde PRV labeling from the spleen occurs via the 
splenic nerve and not as a result of spurious labeling due to blood-borne virus, the splenic 
nerve was cut before PRV injection then analyzed at 120 hr (n = 2 mice).
For counting in the spinal cord, PRV-positive cells were counted then analyzed in horizontal 
spinal cord sections at 96 hr after PRV injection (Fig. 1a–l, Supplementary Fig. 3). Pilot 
studies revealed that this time point allowed consistent labeling in SPNs and presumptive 
interneurons without causing overt degeneration in PRV+ neurons (Supplementary Fig. 2e–
g, Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, in these mice, robust labeling was evident in neuron 
clusters over multiple spinal segments. The total number of PRV+ neurons was counted in 
each sub-region of the spinal cord; the left, the right, the medial zone which is along the 
central canal, the intermediate zone which is the central part of the gray matter, and the 
lateral zone which is at the interface between gray matter and white matter (see Fig. 1g). 
Most animals showed left side-dominant distribution (ipsilateral to PRV injection into 
spleen), but some animals showed an opposite tendency. Hence the quantification was done 
separately as ipsilateral and contralateral sides (Fig. 1m–o). The number of spinal cords 
analyzed were: T1–3, n = 4 mice; T4–9, n = 5 mice; T10–13, n = 4 mice; L1–5, n = 5 mice; 
S1–2, n = 5 mice; for each control, T9 SCI, or T3 SCI group.

 Quantification of FG+ and Vglut2-GFP+, Vgat-GFP+, Chat+ neurons were done in horizontal 
sections at T4–9 spinal level. The number of spinal cords analyzed was: control, n = 4 mice; 
T9 SCI, n = 4 mice; T3 SCI, n = 4 mice for FG and PRV double injection experiments (Fig. 
2a–m): n = 3 each for characterizing interneuron subtype (Fig. 2n–z).
In ~30% of mice (25/91), we observed no labeling or very few PRV+ cells (~10 cells in the 
lateral edge of the gray matter) in the thoracic cord. This variability was not specific to any 
experimental group and was considered an intrinsic variability in injection and/or uptake of 
the virus. Samples from these mice were excluded from further analyses.
 Quantification of Vglut2+ presynaptic puncta on SPNs
Horizontal floating sections (T4–9 level) were stained with rabbit anti-FG, sheep anti-GFP, 
and guinea pig anti-vGlut2 antibodies (80-μm-thick) then were mounted on slides and 
coverslipped. Z-stack images were acquired with confocal microscopy. FG+/PRV-GFP+ 
SPNs with their entire cell body localized within the plane of section and not overlapped 
with other cells were selected and 3D images were reconstructed using Imaris software 
(BITPLANE). VGlut2+ puncta on the surface of GFP+ SPN soma were manually selected 
and the density (Vglut2+ puncta number/GFP+ surface) was calculated. The number of 
animals analyzed were: controls without injury, n = 2 mice (44 cells); day 7 after T3 SCI, n 
= 3 mice (29 cells); day 10, n = 1 mouse (10 cells); day 28, n = 5 mice (67 cells). Data of 
day 7 and 10 were pooled into one group as a time interval that precedes post-SCI immune 
suppression3.
 PACT clearing of spleen
Spleens were cleared using the passive CLARITY (PACT) protocol20. Harvested spleens 
were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and washed in PBS. The samples were incubated overnight 
at 4°C in A4P0 hydrogel monomer solution (4% acrylamide and 0% PFA in PBS), 
containing 0.25% photoinitiator 2,2′-Azobis[2-(imidazolin-2-yl)propane] dihydrochloride 
(VA-044, Wako). To polymerize the tissue-hydrogel matrix, samples were then incubated in 
a 37°C oven with shaker for 2–3 hr. Polymerized tissues were washed with PBS and then 
transferred to a clearing solution containing 8% SDS diluted in 0.1M PBS and incubated at 
37°C for 5 days with shaking. The samples were washed with 5 changes of PBS over 1 day 
and were incubated in blocking solution containing 10% normal donkey serum, 0.1% triton 
X-100 and 0.01% sodium azide at room temperature for 24 hr with shaking. They were then 
incubated with rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (1:500, Millipore, AB152) in 
blocking solution at 40 C for 4 days. They were washed with 5 changes of PBS over 1 day 
and incubated with Alexa 568 donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) in 
blocking solution at 40 C for 2 days. They were washed with 5 changes of PBS over 1 day 
and incubated in RIMS solution (88% Histodenz, 0.01% Sodium azide in 0.02M phosphate 
buffer, pH to 7.5) for 24 hr. Images were acquired using a multiphoton confocal microscope 
(Nikon, A1MP).
 Colorectal distension (CRD) and c-Fos analyses
Colorectal distension was induced as previously reported3, 12, 13 with minor modification. A 
4-French, 60 mm balloon-tipped catheter (Swan-Ganz monitoring catheter model 116F4;

 Edwards Life Sciences) was inserted 1.5 cm into the rectum before securing the catheter to 
the tail with surgical tape. The balloon was inflated with 0.2 ml of air for 30 sec then 
deflated 60 sec. This 90 sec cycle was repeated for 90 min. Mice were perfused 30 min after 
the final cycle of inflation. The number of c-Fos+ cells were counted and analyzed in 2 
representative horizontal spinal cord sections at T4–9 level from multiple SCI animals with 
or without CRD stimulation. The number of animals analyzed were: uninjured with or 
without CRD, n = 3 mice/group; T3 SCI (day 28) without CRD, n = 3 mice; T3 SCI (day 
28) with CRD, n = 5 mice; Vglut2-Cre; cc-EGFP + T3 SCI (day 28) with CRD, n = 3 mice; 
Chat-Cre; cc-EGFP + T3 SCI (day 28) with CRD, n = 3 mice (Supplementary Fig. 5). To 
evaluate the effects of DREADD in mice with CRD-induced activation of visceral-
sympathetic reflex, CNO (1.0 mg/kg body weight, i.p.; Sigma) or vehicle saline was injected 
into Vglut2-Cre + T3SCI + AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry mice at day 28 post-
injury, 30 min before the induction of CRD (n = 3 mice each) (Supplementary Fig. 7).
 DREADD experiment
AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry; 7 × 1012 vg/ml; 
UNC Vector Core) was injected into T5 and 7 levels of the spinal cord of Vglut2-Cre, Chat-
Cre, or WT mice at P14 (0.8 μl/site, 0.25 mm lateral, 0.5 mm in depth). We confirmed that 
AAV-mediated transduction was restricted to neurons within and adjacent to the injection 
site and virus did not get retrogradely transported into brain stem (Supplementary Fig. 6k). 
T3 SCI was induced at 8 weeks old, and then CNO (1.0 mg/kg body weight, i.p.; Sigma) 
was injected twice per day from day 14 to 27 post-injury (Fig. 3a). Small cohorts of mice 
from each colony were randomly chosen for each experimental group and used as they 
reached the appropriate age for experimentation. Total number of mice used across different 
experiments were: WT control, 3 separate rounds (n = 3, 3, 3, total n = 9 mice); WT + T3 
SCI, 5 separate rounds (n = 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, total 8 mice); WT + T3 SCI + AAV8-hSyn-DIO-
hM4Di-mCherry +CNO, 3 rounds (n = 4, 2, 2, total 8 mice); Vglut2-Cre + T3 SCI + AAV8-
hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry + CNO, 5 rounds (n = 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, total 8 mice); Chat-Cre + T3 
SCI + AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry +CNO, 4 rounds (n = 4, 1, 1, 2, total 8 mice). In 
some experiments, spleens were fixed via immersion in 4% PFA fixation (i.e, no flow 
cytometry analyses; WT control, n = 4 mice; WT + T3 SCI, n = 5 mice; WT + T3 SCI + 
AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry + CNO, n = 4 mice; Vglut2-Cre + T3 SCI + AAV8-
hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry + CNO, n = 4 mice; Chat-Cre + T3 SCI + AAV8-hSyn-DIO-
hM4Di-mCherry +CNO, n = 6 mice). Female C57BL/6J mice were used for WT control and 
WT + T3 SCI group, and WT littermate with Vglut2-Cre and Chat-Cre mice (n = 4 mice, 
each) were used for WT + T3 SCI + AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry + CNO group.
 Flow cytometry
Spleens were harvested in Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer (eBioscience) and cell 
suspensions were made by expressing spleen tissue through a cell strainer using the plunger 
of a 10 ml syringe. Cell suspensions were then washed, centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml 
of the buffer. Splenocytes were counted on a hemocytometer and 5 × 105 cells were 
incubated with Fc-block (anti-mouse-CD16/CD32 antibody; eBioscience). Samples were 
stained with the following antibodies: anti-CD45R (B220)-FITC (clone RA3-6B2; BD 
Biosciences), anti-CD4-FITC (clone GK1.5; BD Biosciences), anti-CD8-PE (clone 53-6.7;

 BD Biosciences), and isotype-specific control anti-rat IgG2a κ-FITC and -PE antibodies 
(clone R35-95; BD Biosciences). All antibodies were diluted to 0.5 μg for 5 × 105 cells. 
Splenocytes (10,000 events/sample) were analyzed using a FACSCanto flow cytometer with 
FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Data analyses were conducted with FlowJo software 
(FlowJo). Dot plots of forward scatter (FSC) vs side scatter (SSC) were used to exclude 
debris, and then doublets were excluded using FSC-height (H) vs FSC-width (W) and SSC-
H vs SSC-W plots (Supplementary Fig. 8). The number of each subset was calculated as the 
percentage of labeled cells multiplied by the total number of splenocytes.
 Statistical analyses
Quantitative data are expressed as the mean ± s.e.m. No statistical methods were used to 
predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are comparable to those reported in 
previous publications3,8. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad). 
Differences among the groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test or 
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Normality and equality 
of variances among the groups were analyzed with D’Agostino-Pearson normality test and 
Brown-Forsythe test, respectively. Differences between experimental group pairs were 
analyzed with Student’s t test (two tailed). Normality and equality of variances between the 
groups were analyzed with D’Agostino-Pearson normality test and F test, respectively. 
When the sample numbers were too small to calculate, distribution was assumed to be 
normal. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Trans-synaptic labeling of spinal cord-spleen circuit in T3 SCI mice. (a–l) Horizontal 
sections of spinal cord in control (a, d, g, h), T9 SCI (b, e, i, j), and T3 SCI mice (c, f, k, l), 
96 hr after intrasplenic PRV injection. Images of 2 serial adjacent sections of T6–8 are 
shown, stained with anti-GFP antibody (green). Rostral is left. Magnified view of dotted 
squares in a–f are shown in g–l, respectively. Scale bars, 200 μm (a–f); 100 μm (g–l). The 
images are representative of 4 independent experiments. (m–o). Number of PRV-positive 
cells was quantified in medial (m), intermediate (n), and lateral zone (o) of the spinal cord 
gray matter (see g) from T1 to S2 level then were compared between control (blue bars), T9 
SCI (green bars), and T3 SCI mice (magenta bars). Dark bars, ipsilateral side; light bars, 
contralateral side of the spinal cord. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m (n = 4 mice for 
T1–3 and T10–13, n = 5 mice for others). One way ANOVA followed by Tukey test or 
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test; p = 0.0121, 0.0151, 
0.0194, 0.0194 (m, up to bottom), p = 0.0414, 0.033. 0.0279 (n), p = 0.0194, 0.0194, 
0.0043, 0.0157 (o); *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Identification of spinal interneurons in the spinal cord-splenic sympathetic circuit. (a–l) GFP 
(PRV, green), Chat (red), and FG (blue) labeled neurons at T6 spinal level in control (a–d), 
T9 SCI (e–h), and T3 SCI mice (i–l) after double-labeling with FG (i.p.) and PRV 
(intrasplenic). Horizontal spinal cord sections are oriented with rostral edge of spinal cord to 
the left. Dotted boxes in left panels are magnified in individual channels to the right. Arrows 
indicate FG−/PRV+ spinal interneurons. Scale bars, 50 μm (a for left panels, b for others). 
Images are representative of 4 independent experiments. (m) Quantification of the ratio of 
spinal interneurons (FG−/PRV+) to SPNs (FG+/PRV+). Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m 
(n = 4 mice). One way ANOVA followed by Tukey test; p = 0.0315, 0.0487 (left to right); *p 
< 0.05. (n–y) Neurotransmitter subtype of spinal interneurons in T3 SCI. (n–q) GFP (PRV, 
green), Chat (red), and FG (blue). (r–u) RFP (PRV, red), GFP (Vglut2, green), and FG 
(blue) in Vglut2-Cre; cc-EGFP mice. (vy) RFP (PRV, red), GFP (Vgat, green), and FG 
(blue) in Vgat-Cre; cc-EGFP mice. Arrows indicate double-positive interneurons (FG−). 
Images are representative of 3 independent experiments. (z) The ratio of Chat+, Vglut2-
GFP+ and Vgat-GFP+ in FG−/PRV+ spinal interneurons in T3 SCI mice (n = 3 mice).
