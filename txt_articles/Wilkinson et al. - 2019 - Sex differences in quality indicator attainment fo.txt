AbsTrACT
Aim to investigate sex differences in acute myocardial 
infarction (aMi) guideline-indicated care as defined 
by the european society of cardiology (esc) acute 
cardiovascular care association (acca) quality 
indicators.
Methods nationwide cohort study comprising 691 
290 aMi hospitalisations in england and Wales (n=233 
hospitals) from the Myocardial ischaemia national audit 
Project between 1 January 2003 and 30 June 2013.
results there were 34.5% (n=238 489) women 
(median age 76.7 (iQr 66.3–84.0) years; 33.9% 
(n=80 884) st-elevation myocardial infarction (steMi)) 
and 65.5% (n=452 801) men (median age 67.1 (iQr 
56.9–77.2) years; 42.5% (n=192 229) steMi). Women 
less frequently received 13 of the 16 quality indicators 
compared with men, including timely reperfusion therapy 
for steMi (76.8% vs 78.9%; p<0.001), timely coronary 
angiography for non-steMi (24.2% vs 36.7%; p<0.001), 
dual antiplatelet therapy (75.4% vs 78.7%) and 
secondary prevention therapies (87.2% vs 89.6% for 
statins, 82.5% vs 85.6% for ace inhibitor/angiotensin 
receptor blockers and 62.6% vs 67.6% for beta-blockers; 
all p<0.001). Median 30-day global registry of acute 
coronary events risk score adjusted mortality was higher 
for women than men (median: 5.2% (iQr 1.8%–13.1%) 
vs 2.3% (iQr 0.8%–7.1%), p<0.001). an estimated 
8243 (95% ci 8111 to 8375) deaths among women 
could have been prevented over the study period if their 
quality indicator attainment had been equal to that 
attained by men.
Conclusion according to the esc acca aMi quality 
indicators, women in england and Wales less frequently 
received guideline-indicated care and had significantly 
higher mortality than men. greater attention to the 
delivery of recommended aMi treatments for women has 
the potential to reduce the sex-aMi mortality gap.
InTroduCTIon
Women now account for more new cases of cardio-
vascular disease than men; in 2015 the incidence 
of cardiovascular disease among women was 
5.3 
million across 47 European Society of Cardi-
ology (ESC) member countries.1 For acute myocar-
dial infarction (AMI), women have higher early 
mortality rates and lower longer term survival than 
men.2 3 Women with AMI are more likely to have 
non-chest pain symptoms,4 longer delays in seeking 
medical care following symptom onset,5 myocardial 
infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries 
(MINOCA)6 and a different comorbidity burden.7 
However, such factors may not fully explain their 
disadvantaged outcomes. Research using the 
Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Devel-
opment of Evidence-based care in Heart disease 
Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies 
(SWEDEHEART) registry found that the delivery of 
cardiovascular care, but not patient demographics 
or medical history accounted for sex differences in 
excess mortality following AMI.8
The ESC Acute Cardiovascular Care Association 
(ACCA) recently developed and externally vali-
dated a suite of quality indicators (QI) for AMI.9–11 
These dovetail many of the ESC guidelines class I 
level A recommendations for the management of 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 
non-STEMI (NSTEMI), and are inversely associ-
ated with 30-day and 3-year mortality.10 11 Given 
the knowledge gap with regard to the precise nature 
and full extent of the impact of sex-dependent 
inequalities in AMI care, we mapped the ESC ACCA 
QIs to men and women hospitalised in England 
and Wales with AMI. We aimed to identify where 
in the pathway of AMI care greater attention may 
be required to deliver ESC guideline-recommended 
interventions and therefore improve cardiovascular 
outcomes.
MeThods
setting and design
The analyses used data from the Myocardial 
Ischaemia 
National 
Audit 
Project 
(MINAP), 
a comprehensive registry of acute coronary 
syndrome hospitalisations in England and Wales 
mandated by the Department of Health.12 Each 
MINAP entry provides patient demographic and 
clinical details of the patient journey across 122 
data items. Data collection and management have 
been described previously.12
Patients aged 18 years or over who were admitted 
to one of 233 hospitals between 1 January 2003 
and 30 June 2013 with a discharge diagnosis of 
AMI (STEMI and NSTEMI) were included in the 
study (n=693 
211). In the case of multiple admis-
sions, the earliest record was used to reduce poten-
tial bias caused by treatments associated with prior 
admissions of AMI. Those with missing sex were 
excluded, leaving an analytical cohort of 691 
290 
(figure 
1).

(heart failure (HF), asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD)) and clinical characteristics (heart rate, systolic 
blood pressure (BP), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, creatinine, 
ST-segment deviation, Killip class) at the time of hospitalisation. 
Vital status and date of all-cause mortality were linked from the 
Office for National Statistics, and provided as part of the anony-
mised patient-level data set.
Ethical approval for this study was not required under National 
Health Service (NHS) research governance arrangements for 
the secondary use of anonymised patient data. The National 
Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, including the 
MINAP database, has support under section 251 of the NHS Act 
2006 to use patient information for medical research without 
consent (NIGB: ECC1-06(d)/2011). The study was conducted in 
compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Quality indicators
The ESC ACCA has set out 20 QIs for measuring attainment 
of guideline-indicated AMI care.9 These indicators cover seven 
domains, including the evaluation of: (1) centre organisation, (2) 
reperfusion / invasive strategy, (3) in-hospital risk assessment, (4) 
antithrombotic treatment during hospitalisation, (5) secondary 
prevention discharge treatments, (6) patient satisfaction, and (7) 
composite QIs, and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events 
(GRACE) risk score adjusted 30-day mortality.
Numerators and denominators corresponding to the compo-
nents of the QIs were taken from relevant MINAP data fields. 
An individual would be deemed ineligible if a QI was listed 
within MINAP as contraindicated, not indicated, not applicable, 
declined by the patient or was deemed inappropriate. If a patient 
was eligible for treatment, but had missing receipt of treatment 
data, a default imputation strategy was adopted where they 
would be treated as not having received the treatment.
Attainment of four QIs could not be calculated from the 
MINAP data fields: discharge prescription of high-intensity 
statins, documentation of GRACE or Can Rapid Risk Stratifi-
cation of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes 
with Early Implementation of the ACC/AHA Guidelines score 
in the medical notes and patient satisfaction. QIs that are part 
of routine UK processes were scored at 100% attainment, 
including assessment of time to reperfusion, participation in a 
regular registry, prehospital activation of the catheter labora-
tory and a single emergency phone number for medical triage.11 
For domain 6, patient-reported experience is not recorded. We 
therefore report provision of dietary advice and cardiac rehabil-
itation referral.
Domain 7 specifies the use of composite scores including an 
opportunity-based and all-or-none score. The opportunity-based 
score was derived by dividing the total number of interven-
tions received, by the number that the patient was eligible for. 
The nine measures available within MINAP that were included 
were: the centre is part of a network organisation; proportion 
of patients receiving reperfusion therapy among those eligible 
(STEMI, and first medical contact within 12 
hours of onset of 
pain); coronary angiography in high-ischaemic-risk STEMI and 
NSTEMI without contraindications; assessment of left ventric-
ular (LV) ejection fraction before hospital discharge; low-dose 
aspirin (unless high bleeding risk or oral anticoagulation); P2Y12 
inhibition; ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker 
(ARB) in patients with clinical evidence of HF or evidence of 
moderate/severe LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) on echocardi-
ography; beta-blockers (unless contraindicated) in patients with 
clinical evidence of HF or moderate/severe LVSD; and  prescrip-
tion of a statin.
The all-or-none composite score was derived by categorising 
care receipt into optimal (all interventions received) or subop-
timal (missed one or more care interventions for which the 
patient was eligible). For patients without HF, the measures 
included were receipt of low-dose aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor 
and statin. For those with HF (defined as an ejection fraction 
of <40% 
or presence of HF symptoms) receipt of beta-blockers 
and ACEi/ARB were included in addition, making five variables 
in total.
statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics were described using numbers and 
percentages, medians and IQR or means with SDs. Comparisons 
were made using Χ2, t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The propor-
tion (%) of patients in whom each QI was attained of those who 
were eligible is reported.
Given MINAP does not directly record a patient’s baseline 
clinical risk, we calculated the mini-GRACE risk score, which 
has been validated for use within the registry.13 This comprises 
age, cardiac arrest, ST-segment deviation, elevated cardiac 
enzymes, systolic BP
, heart rate, loop diuretic (as a surrogate for 
Killip class II–IV) and creatinine (as a surrogate for CKD).13 14 
Each patient’s ischaemic risk was categorised in line with ESC 
guidance.15
To estimate 30-day GRACE adjusted mortality, we used the 
predicted probabilities derived from a logistic regression model 
where the dependent variable was 30-day mortality and the

independent variable was each patient’s GRACE risk score. To 
estimate the number of potentially preventable deaths had QI 
attainment been equal between men and women, we calcu-
lated the GRACE risk adjusted OR for the association of the 
opportunity-based composite score with 30-day mortality using 
a logistic regression model. This was based on complete cases 
analysis. The OR corresponding to a single unit change in the 
composite opportunity-based score was converted to correspond 
to a change equivalent to the difference between median attain-
ment levels of the score between women and men (by raising the 
OR to the power of the difference). The percentage change in 
mortality was then multiplied by the observed number of deaths 
in women to estimate the number of deaths that may have been 
prevented, had QI attainment been equal. Sensitivity analyses 
were performed using imputed data and fully adjusted models 
(online supplementary table 1).
Inverse probability weighting propensity score analysis was 
used to account for systematic differences between men and 
women (ie, differences in baseline characteristics). A series of 
Royston-Parmar flexible parametric survival models were then 
fitted to determine the extent to which year of admission, Index 
of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score, GRACE risk score, comor-
bidities, risk factors and QIs explained the difference in 30-day 
survival between men and women (online supplementary section 
1). The analyses were undertaken overall for the AMI group, as 
well as stratified by AMI subtype. Stata MP V
.14.0 (StataCorp, 
USA) was used for analysis, with statistical significance deter-
mined at 5%.

Patient characteristics
The analytical cohort comprised 238 
489 women (34.5%) and 
452 
801 men (65.5%). Women were, on average, 9.6 years older 
and more frequently had NSTEMI than men (66.1% vs 57.5%, 
p<0.001) (table 1). Fewer women were smokers or ex-smokers

than men, and there was a lower proportion with previous coro-
nary revascularisation among women than men. Women had 
a greater prevalence of angina, hypertension, cerebrovascular 
disease, COPD or asthma, renal failure and HF, and a lower 
prevalence of previous AMI, hypercholesterolaemia and PVD 
compared with men (all p<0.001).
Women less frequently had a prehospital cardiac arrest than 
men (1.5% vs 2.3%, p<0.001), and more women were classified 
as high ischaemic risk according to the GRACE score (36.6% vs 
21.0%, p<0.001). Prior to hospitalisation, women were more 
likely to be taking aspirin, beta-blockers and ACEi/ARBs, and 
less likely to be taking statins or P2Y12 inhibitors compared with 
men (all p<0.001).
Quality indicators
Data were available for six of the seven domains of care, covering 
16 of the 20 QIs. For three QIs, a score of 100% was assigned 
to all patients. Of the remaining 13 QIs, there was significantly 
lower attainment for women compared with men (table 2, 
figure 2).
Domain 1: centre organisation
All centres are part of a network with protocols to guide safe and 
efficient care, so scores of 100% were assigned. An ECG was 
performed and interpreted prehospital in more men than women 
(68.1% vs 67.1%, p<0.001).
Domain 2: reperfusion: invasive strategy
For STEMI presenting within 12 
hours of symptom onset, 
less women than men received reperfusion therapy (84.9% vs 
87.0%, p<0.001), and less women received reperfusion within 
the predefined time limits (76.8% vs 78.9%, p<0.001). The time 
from diagnosis to wire passage was longer for women than men 
(median 46 vs 44 
min, p<0.001). For NSTEMI, fewer women 
than men received coronary angiography within 72 
hours of 
admission to hospital (24.2% vs 36.7%, p<0.001).
Domain 3: in-hospital risk assessment
Less women than men had an inpatient evaluation of their 
LV ejection fraction (47.0% vs 49.5%, p<0.001).
Domain 4: antithrombotic treatment during hospitalisation
Less women than men with NSTEMI received fondaparinux 
(24.2% vs 24.6%, p=0.028). At hospital discharge, less women 
than men were prescribed P2Y12 inhibitors or dual antiplatelet 
therapies (both p<0.001).
Domain 5: secondary prevention: discharge treatment
Despite high attainment, less women than men were discharged 
on secondary prevention therapies. Where it was indicated, 
women less frequently than men received a statin, ACEi/ARB or 
beta-blocker (all p<0.001).
Domain 6: patient satisfaction
Less women than men received or were referred for cardiac 
rehabilitation (70.4% vs 76.7%, p<0.001) or received dietary 
advice (28.8% vs 32.0%, p<0.001).
Domain 7: composite and outcome QI
Median attainment of the composite opportunity-based QI was 
higher for men than women (80.0% vs 71.4%, p<0.001). Simi-
larly, the overall composite QI score was higher for men than 
women (74.6 vs 69.5, p<0.001). At 30 
days, 28 
004 women and 
33 
937 men had died (11.7% vs 7.5%, p<0.001). Thirty-day 
GRACE risk score adjusted mortality was higher among women 
than men (mean 9.9% vs 6.3%, p<0.001, median 5.2% vs 2.3%, 
p<0.001) (figure 3).
Overall, for a single percentage increase in the composite 
opportunity-based QI score, there was an associated 3.8% 
decline in the 30-day GRACE score adjusted mortality rate 
(OR=0.96, 95% 
CI 0.962 to 0.963; p<0.001). If women in 
the cohort (with complete GRACE score data) had the same 
composite opportunity-based score attainment as that of the 
men, an estimated 8243 (95% CI 8111 to 8375) deaths among 
women could potentially have been prevented at 30 days (online 
supplementary table 1) .
Propensity score analysis
For STEMI, after weighting and adjustment for baseline char-
acteristics (including GRACE score, supplementary tables 2 
and 3), survival differences between men and women were 
evident (average treatment effect (ATE) 0.42, 95% 
CI 0.01 to 
0.84; p=0.048) and remained after further adjustment for the 
QIs (ATE 0.55, 95% 
CI 0.13 to 0.96; p=0.010) (figure 4). For 
NSTEMI, no survival differences were observed after adjust-
ment for baseline characteristics (ATE −0.06, 95% 
CI −0.41 to 
0.28; p=0.717) or after further adjustment for QIs (ATE −0.03; 
95% 
CI −0.37 to 0.31; p=0.850).
Factors explaining the survival differences between the sexes
For STEMI, the QIs attenuated the difference in 30-day survival 
between men and women which was further reduced, but not 
eliminated by the addition of comorbidities, cardiovascular risk 
factors, year, demographics and GRACE score. For NSTEMI, 
the QIs also attenuated the difference in 30-day survival between 
men and women, and the difference was eliminated with the 
addition of comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors and the 
GRACE score (online supplementary tables 4-6).
For inpatient mortality, clinical and demographic character-
istics attenuated the difference between men and women, and 
the addition of the QIs eliminated the difference. In contrast, 
for those who survived to hospital discharge, the GRACE score 
attenuated the difference in survival to 30 
days (online supple-
mentary tables 7–9).
dIsCussIon
Using a nationwide clinical registry and an analytical cohort 
of nearly 700 
000 patients with AMI, we found that the provi-
sion of care across the ESC ACCA QIs was lower for women 
than men. After adjustment for baseline ischaemic risk, women 
had higher rates of early mortality than men, and differences 
in the attainment of QIs mediated some of the differences in 
30-day survival between men and women. While sex-depen-
dent inequalities in cardiovascular care and outcomes have been 
reported previously, this study identifies where (and therefore 
how) deaths from AMI may be reduced among women.
Amounting evidence points towards the importance of health 
service factors in the clinical outcomes of women with AMI. Data 
from the SWEDEHEART registry showed that the lower survival 
among women than men was attenuated by adjustment for the 
use of pharmacotherapies and an invasive coronary strategy,8 
which suggests that sex-dependent differences in AMI mortality 
are potentially modifiable through improved concordance with 
guideline-indicated care. Guideline recommendations are based 
on large randomised controlled trials which have demonstrated

intervention efficacy15 16 and supported by real-world data veri-
fying their effectiveness.17 18 Missed opportunities in the delivery 
of such care are associated with excess mortality, and potentially 
avoidable deaths.17 Attainment of the ACCA QIs is significantly 
associated with improved mortality,11 and their use in this study 
enabled us to identify inequities in provision of optimal care 
across the duration of clinical care.9
Whereas the combination of demographic and clinical char-
acteristics, as well as the attainment of QIs, eliminated the 
sex-based difference in in-hospital mortality, the GRACE 
risk score had the greatest impact on sex-based differences in 
mortality at the landmark between discharge and 30 
days. This 
suggests possible scope for improvement in in-hospital treatment 
for women with AMI. Provision of coronary angiography within 
72 
hours for NSTEMI showed the greatest sex discrepancy 
in QI attainment (12.5% lower for women than men). While 
the Early Invasive versus Selectively Invasive Management for 
Acute Coronary Syndromes (ICTUS) trial did not demonstrate 
a benefit for an early invasive strategy compared with a selec-
tive invasive strategy,19 in patients with high-risk NSTEMI early 
angiography has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of 
death and AMI,20 21 and therefore suboptimal attainment of this 
QI could potentially be associated with adverse outcomes. For 
STEMI, provision of timely reperfusion revealed a much smaller 
sex discrepancy which may, in part, be explained by differences 
in treatment pathways. During STEMI, the first encounter 
between patient and operator may be in the catheter laboratory, 
whereas in NSTEMI treatment decisions are made on the ward 
and may take greater account of comorbidities and frailty status. 
In STEMI, the small difference in delivery of primary percuta-
neous coronary intervention (PCI) between the sexes and the 
short duration of follow-up may explain the limited association 
between STEMI-specific QIs and differences in 30-day survival 
between men and women.22
Previous research has shown that women are less likely than 
men to receive guideline-indicated care,8 and that physicians 
tend to underestimate cardiovascular risk in women.23 Our find-
ings imply that a combination of ‘biology and bias’ accounts for 
sex disparities in AMI treatment and outcome.8 24 25 Overall, the 
rates of delivery of interventions were high, and exceeded those 
elsewhere in Western Europe.26 There have been improvements 
in the use of AMI treatments, where provision of primary PCI 
for STEMI was 99.3% in 2016 in England.27 28 Yet, even in high 
functioning healthcare systems such as Sweden and the UK there 
appear to be systematic differences in the use of evidence-based 
medicine that disadvantages women.8 However, the QIs did 
not fully explain the sex differences in survival following AMI, 
and we also acknowledge sex differences in symptomatology, 
health-seeking behaviour4 5; comorbidity burden,7 vascular 
physiology, incidence of MINOCA6; and pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics.29
Whilst this study has strengths including the extent and quality of 
data, which allowed the interrogation of care according to the QIs, 
we recognise the limitations of our research. We followed the ACCA 
QI specification for the calculation of adjusted mortality,9 being 
mindful that other patient and hospital-specific influences were 
not accounted for in the modelling, and so residual confounding 
is likely. For the GRACE score we used surrogates for Killip class 
and creatinine.13 Similarly, ‘statin prescription’ was used as a surro-
gate for high-intensity statin, and any P2Y12 inhibitor for potent

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have worse 
clinical outcomes than men. It is suggested that this relates 
to differences in comorbidity burden, clinical presentation and 
delivery of care.
What might this study add?
 
► We mapped the European Society of Cardiology AMI quality 
indicators to 691 290 patients using the UK Myocardial 
Ischaemia National Audit Project to investigate potential 
areas of suboptimal care provision for women, including 
timely reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction (STEMI) and coronary angiography for non-STEMI, 
dual antiplatelet therapy and secondary prevention therapies. 
We found that attainment of each of these was lower, and 
30-day Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score 
adjusted mortality was higher in women. We estimate that 
8243 deaths among women were potentially preventable had 
quality indicators attainment been equal between sexes.
how might this impact on clinical practice?
 
► Greater attention to guideline-indicated care has the 
potential to reduce the sex-dependent AMI mortality gap.
antiplatelet medication. MINAP does not record detail on coronary 
anatomy. Finally, we used the composite QIs to define optimal care 
and calculate the number of potentially avoidable deaths among 
women. However, this estimate may be imprecise due to limitations 
in data quality, and the fact that the QIs do not represent the full 
pathway of AMI care.
In conclusion, according to the ACCA QIs, women in England 
and Wales less frequently received guideline-indicated care and 
had significantly higher mortality rates than men. While the QIs 
did not fully explain sex differences in survival following AMI, 
greater attention to the delivery of recommended AMI treat-
ments for women has the potential to reduce potentially avoid-
able deaths among women.
