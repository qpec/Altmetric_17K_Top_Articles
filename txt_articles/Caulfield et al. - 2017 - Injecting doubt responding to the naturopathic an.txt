ABSTRACT
There is growing controversy about vaccination rates in Canada. A signifi-
cantpercentageofthepopulationisuncertainaboutthescienceofvaccines,
and in some areas ‘
herd immunity’is being threatened. Hesitancy to vacci-
nate is a complex phenomenon, but there is little doubt that complemen-
tary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers have played a role. In this
study,ourfirstobjectivewastoexaminewebsitesofnaturopathicclinicsand
practitioners in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, looking for
(1) the presence of discourse that may contribute to vaccine hesitancy, and
(2) recommendations for ‘
alternatives’to vaccines or flu shots. Of the 330
naturopath websites we analysed, 40 included vaccine hesitancy discourse
and26offeredvaccineorflushotalternatives.Usingthesedata,weexplored
thepotentialimpactsuchstatementscouldhaveonthephenomenonofvac-
cine hesitancy. Our second objective was to consider these misrepresenta-
tions in the context of Canadian law and policy, and to outline various le-
gal methods of addressing them. We concluded that tightening advertising
law, reducing CAM practitioners’ability to self-regulate, and improving en-
forcement of existing common and criminal law standards would help limit
naturopaths’ability to spread inaccurate and science-free anti-vaccination
and vaccine-hesitant perspectives.

ratesarestillbelowideallevels.2 Thisisoccurringinpartbecausenumerousvaccination
myths are being circulated throughout popular culture. The ongoing and unfounded
connection made between vaccines and autism,3 for example, leads to inaccurate per-
ceptions about risk, and in turn, a greater number of Canadians becoming hesitant
about vaccinating. A 2015 survey found that one in four Canadian parents either be-
lieves vaccines are associated with autism and other mental health issues or is uncertain
about the issue.4 Other research has found that, on average, 39% of Canadians believe
that the science on vaccines is not clear.5 This is not to say that a large portion of Cana-
dians harbor strident anti-vaccination beliefs. But a growing percentage has doubts and
concerns that seem to be fueled by the misleading rhetoric around vaccination safety.
Indeed, recent outbreaks of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases have
been attributed, at least in part, to the vaccine hesitancy phenomenon6 and to efforts
by those in the anti-vaccination community to create doubt about the effectiveness and
kept and up-to-date are falling over time. If immunization coverage continues to fall, more vulnerable popu-
lations, such as children, the elderly, and people with medical conditions that may prevent them from being
immunized, will be put at risk’
. Also see David W. Scheifele, Scott A. Halperin & Julie A. Bettinger, Childhood
Immunization Rates in Canada are too low: UNICEF, 19 PAEDIATR CHILD HEALTH 237, 237 (2014), which,
summarizing a UNICEF study states, ‘
Canada fared poorly in comparison with other affluent countries, rank-
ing 28th among 29 countries. The immunization coverage rate cited for Canada was 84%, compared with
rates of 96% in the United Kingdom, and 93% in the United States and Australia. Canada was one of only
three countries with rates <90%’

Central to the vaccine-causing autism claims was a paper by Andrew Wakefield initially published in the
influential The Lancet journal in 1998. This paper postulated that after eight children received the MMR
vaccine, they developed intestinal inflammation leading to usually non-permeable peptides translocating
first to the bloodstream, then the brain, where development was affected. This paper was later retracted
by The Lancet. Much has been written about this retraction, and the vaccination scare which it produced.
See for example, http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452 (accessed Jan. 16, 2017). Claims made by
Wakefield as well as other anti-vaccination authors have been assessed and discredited. See for example,
http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full.pdf+html (accessed Jan. 16, 2017), where it reads in
the conclusion, ‘
Twenty epidemiologic studies have shown that neither thimerosal nor MMR vaccine causes
autism. These studies have been performed in several countries by many different investigators who have em-
ployed a multitude of epidemiologic and statistical methods. The large size of the studied populations has
afforded a level of statistical power sufficient to detect even rare associations. These studies, in concert with
the biological implausibility that vaccines overwhelm a child’
s immune system, have effectively dismissed the
notion that vaccines cause autism. Further studies on the cause or causes of autism should focus on more-
promising leads’
. Andrew Wakefield continues to propagate anti-vaccination views in the current day. His
2016 film, ‘
Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe’
, was screened in cinemas across North America.

safety of vaccination.7 A recent study found that in some areas of Vancouver the vacci-
nation rates have declined to the point where the benefits of ‘
herd immunity’have been
lost.8 Less than ideal vaccination rates can also have an economic impact. A 2016 study
estimates that, in the USA alone, the economic burden of vaccine preventable diseases
is approximately $9 billion.9
The reasons for the existence and spread of vaccination hesitancy are complex, nu-
merous, and interrelated.10 Still, there seems little doubt that complementary and al-
ternative medicine (CAM) practitioners play a role.11 While not all CAM practitioners

CAM is a complex term to define, but as written on the Canadian Bioethics society, ‘
At the heart
of all definitions of CAM is the fundamental distinction between therapies that are taken in com-
plement with western medicine and those which are pursued as an alternative to the offerings of
western medicine’
. (https://www.bioethics.ca/blog.html?Step=2&MB=283) (accessed Jan. 16, 2017).
A similar definition is provided on the NIH’
s National Centre for Complementary and Integrative
Health, which defines ‘
complementary’as ‘
a non-mainstream practice is used together with conventional
medicine’
, and ‘
alternative’ as ‘
a non-mainstream practice is used in place of conventional medicine’
(https://nccih.nih.gov/health/integrative-health) (accessed Jan. 16, 2017). Common examples of CAM in-
clude acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic, spinal manipulation therapy, reiki, etc.

r Responding to naturopathic anti-vaccination rhetoric
increased anti-vaccination attitudes,13 and a 2004 study of Canadian Naturopathic stu-
dents found that only 12.8% would advise full vaccination.14 As such, in Canada, there
has been concern about how the naturopathic community and other alternative practi-
tioners represent the health benefits and risks associated with vaccination.15
In this paper, we will shed light on vaccination-hesitant16 discourse used by the
naturopathic community on clinic websites as well as those of individual naturopaths.
An exploration of how naturopaths represent the risks and benefits of vaccination will
inform what policies should be used to correct the spread of misinformation about vac-
cination. Furthermore, it will serve to highlight the degree to which naturopaths are en-
gagedinthedistributionofscientificallyquestionablevaccination-hesitantdiscourse.17
at abstract (2008): ‘
Refusal to follow the basic vaccination schemata was more frequent among CAM-users
than non-users and reflected in most cases parental wishes rather than physicians’recommendations’
. And,
of course, naturopaths aren’
t the only CAM providers that have been associated with a tendency toward
anti-vaccination views. See, for example, Emily A Medd & Margaret L Russell, Personal and Professional
Immunization Behavior Among Alberta Chiropractors: A Secondary Analysis of Cross-Sectional Survey Data,

, we mean discourse which (1) explicitly denounces vaccination; (2) raises issues of
harms and risks of vaccines; (3) offers alternative vaccination services such as alternatives to the flu shot.

Previous research has found that much of what is advertised on the websites for naturopath clinics is not
supported by a solid foundation of science. For example, see Timothy Caulfield & Christen Rachul,Supported

VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY
The development of vaccines has been characterized as one of civilization’
s greatest
health achievements.18 It has been estimated that, worldwide, vaccination prevents
two to three millions deaths every year.19 It has been noted that if people stop vacci-
nating their children, vaccine preventable disease can and will come back.20 Indeed,
measles—a vaccine preventable disease—remains one of the leading causes of death
for young children.21 While almost all health interventions are associated with some
risks,22 the vaccines that are currently recommended have a strong and well-known
safety profile.23 Also, there is no credible evidence that the preservatives used in vac-
cines, such as thermasol, are associated with the development of any disease or ailment,
includingautism.24 Indeed,thereisabsolutelynocredibleevidencetosupportthemyth
that vaccines cause autism.25 The concern that children can’
t handle multiple vaccines
at once is also without foundation.26 In fact, the immune system can handle thousands
of different challenges. Every day children are exposed to multiple foreign substances
that create an immune response. So while new vaccines require rigorous testing and we
should continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of existing vaccines, there is a
large body of literature that has established not only their safety but the vital role that
vaccines play in maintaining a healthy population.

r Responding to naturopathic anti-vaccination rhetoric
naturopath websites. Rather, the goal is to highlight examples of the type of rhetoric
used by naturopaths in this context.
First,
we
identified
naturopaths
in
each
province
using
the
website
www.findanaturopath.com, which has over 1850 naturopaths listed in Canada
(157 in Alberta and 388 in British Columbia), and captured all available websites
for the listed naturopaths in the two provinces (221 in British Columbia, 105 in
Alberta).27 We then used Google to search for the appearance of the following words
in each website: vaccine, vaccination, flu, immune, immunization.28 In the case of any
search words appearing on the website, we looked for the following: (1) discourse of
vaccine hesitancy (text or links to text which demonstrate explicit anti-vaccination
views or which raise issues surrounding the harms/risks of vaccination) and (2)
services offered or text descriptions of alternatives to vaccinations or the flu shot.
While there is an abundance of websites offering natural solutions to ‘
boost immunity’
or to prepare one for the flu season,29 these websites were not included in our analysis
as they did not explicitly address vaccination or flu shots.30
After reviewing just over 330 websites, we found 40 websites with vaccine hesitancy
discourse, and 26 websites offering vaccine or flu shot alternatives. Thirteen websites
had both. In total, 53 had either vaccine-hesitant language, suggested a vaccine alterna-
tive or had both. Text examples of vaccine hesitancy discourse can be found in Table 1,
and text examples of vaccine or flu shot alternatives in Table 2.
AsevidentinTable1,thevaccinationhesitancyinformationonthenaturopathweb-
sites falls on a continuum, from those that are overtly anti-vaccination to those that
subtly undermine the relevant science. For example, it is common on websites with
vaccine hesitancy discourse to make a link between mercury (thimerosal) and vac-
cines, and to then discuss the related risks and harms (see examples 1 and 2 in Ta-
ble 1). There is no credible evidence that the mercury-based preservative used in vac-
cines, thimerosal, is linked to illnesses in children.31 Furthermore, almost all vaccines in
27
Additional websites (approximately 10) were added when found URLs didn’
t work but others matching the
same listed naturopath or same clinic appeared in Google searches.
28
The search query was the following: search word + site: URL. So, in the case of the search word
‘
vaccine’ and the website www.naturopathicfundamentals.com, the search was as followed: vaccine
site:www.naturopathicfundamentals.com and vaccine site:naturopathicfundamentals.com
29
For example, the clinic www.backtowellness.ca (accessed Nov. 14, 2016) offers ‘
Joy of the Mountains
Oregano Oil’
, which is ‘
absolutely’proven ‘
to boost your immune system’
. The site www.askdoctorbill.com

ing vitamin D3 and Astragalus. The clinic www.woodgrovepinesclinic.com (accessed Nov. 14, 2016) offers

course, these claims and services are also not supported by science. See, for example, Timothy Caulfield, The

The conventional Flu Shot is a mixture of 3 strains of flu viruses mixed with a number

are continuously mutating.’

A [sic] epidemiologist researcher from British Columbia, Dr. Danuta Skowronski,

Increasing evidence suggests that injecting a child with nearly three dozen doses of 10
different viral and bacterial vaccines before the age of five, while the immune system is still
developing, can cause chronic immune dysfunction. The most that vaccines can do is lead
to an increase in antibodies to a specific disease.’

of thimerosal used in vaccines is harmful. Another common vaccination-hesitancy sen-

(see example 3 in Table 1) and/or suggesting that vaccination can lead to higher de-
grees of risk (see examples 4 and 5 in Table 1). The risks associated with vaccination
are not only relatively mild but also very infrequent.32 And more serious occasions, for
example, an allergic reaction, are very rare.33 Notably, very few naturopath websites
were explicitly supportive of vaccinations.

Geta homeopathic prophylactic immuneinjection—As an alternative to the flu shot,
you can choose a homeopathic prophylactic injection instead. These have been
scientifically shown to increase white blood cell activity by over 30%. This injection is safe
and without side effects.’

There are alternatives to the standard vaccines, and these work on boosting your
immune response naturally through diet, supplements and with standardized plant
extracts that stimulate and strengthen the immune response without any added
toxins.’

Unfortunately the flu vaccine includes adjuvants (additives) that are poorly tolerated
and can be difficult to process (including many patients suffering from auto-immune
diseases, that often suffer major relapses after receiving a flu shot). Its [sic] also based on
last year’
s virus, which has mutated considerably by this year, hence rendering the
vaccine’
s effectiveness questionable to this year’
s newly mutated virus. Dosing a
homeopathic preparation based on the last 100 years of flu pandemics encompasses the
many genetic variants that occur with flu viruses. It is free of adjuvants, and will not
interfere with any other medications or cause the immune dysregulation that is seen in
auto-immune diseases.’

5) ‘It’
s that time again, the dreaded cold and flu season! Many people opt to get a flu shot.
This year, there is concerns [sic] the flu vaccine may not be effective against all virus
strains. Fortunately, our body has excellent defense mechanisms to protect us from these
harmful viruses and bacteria. It’
s time to start boosting your immune system....
Naturally!!! Many of the suggestions I have listed are herbs or botanicals you can find in
your kitchen cupboard. Let’
s start with the basics, as these really do
work.’
—www.vitaliahealthcare.ca
6) ‘Immune Boosting Homeopathics: You may be more familiar with the conventional flu
shot, which provides vaccination from predicted influenza virus strains; not necessarily
what people are actually exposed to this season. Homeopathic immune boosters can be
delivered by injection or orally, and do not have the side effects commonly seen with flu
shots, such as malaise, fever, and lethargy. They are great for prevention and treatment of
colds and give your immune system an extra punch to naturally knock out those bugs and
viruses throughout the year.’

In terms of alternatives to vaccines or flu shots, again a continuum is present as
some suggest complete replacement while others suggest supporting flu shots with nat-
ural measures. Although naturopaths recommend a wide range of vaccination alterna-
tives including plant extracts, ‘

alternatives are described as some form of homeopathy.34 Of course, there is no sci-
entific evidence supporting the efficacy of homeopathy for treating any health condi-
tion.35 The idea that homeopathic vaccines could work is scientifically absurd.36 Addi-
tionally,asrecentlyasNovemberofthisyear,theAmericanFederalTradeCommission
(FTC) echoed this statement, stating that there is no scientific basis supporting the ef-
ficacy claims made by homeopathic products.37 Our analysis is, of course, confined to

naturopaths to patients during clinical encounters. Regardless, our data provide a sense
of the kind of anti-vaccination rhetoric that exists within the naturopathic community
in Alberta and British Columbia.
THE IMPACT
As noted, there is evidence that suggests that CAM providers play a role in parental atti-
tudes and vaccination intentions.38 The relationship is complex, however, as those who
are more likely to be attracted to CAM are also the ones most likely to hold negative
attitudes toward vaccination.39 Still, there seems little doubt that healthcare providers
can play an important role in how parents and patients approach vaccination.40 This
seems particularly true if naturopaths are involved. A 2011 study found that ‘
endorsing
a naturopathic physician’as the ‘
most trusted source of information regarding vacci-
nation’was ‘
associated with greater odds of having a partially vaccinated or unvacci-
nated child’
.41 In addition, because the information is available to anyone searching for

information on vaccination and it appears on the websites of healthcare providers, it
may facilitate the spread of misinformation to the public more broadly. This seems par-
ticularly worrisome given that many provincial jurisdictions have explicitly legitimized
naturopaths via legislative action.42
Furthermore,
research
tells
us
that
mere
exposure
to
anti-vaccination
rhetoric—whetherintheformofconspiracytheories43 orfalselybalancedstoriesinthe
media44—can also impact attitudes and can play a role in the intention to vaccinate. It
is not the case, of course, that people make decisions about vaccination based solely on
rational, evidenced-based, scientific perspectives.45 Individuals are situated in diverse
contexts and are informed and influenced by a range of different individuals and social
entities when it comes to making decisions about vaccinations.46 Once a particular
perspective is established, we all have a natural tendency, known as the confirmation
bias, to seek information that corresponds with and validates our existing view.47 As
such, for those who are already hesitant or hold anti-vaccination views, the existence of
anti-vaccination or vaccination-hesitant rhetoric on naturopathic websites could serve
as a source of validation. This seems particularly so because of the heightened status
of naturopaths, at least in some jurisdictions, as a government regulated healthcare
profession.
To be fair, the number of naturopathic websites with explicitly anti-vaccination
rhetoric was relatively small (53 out of the 330 that we reviewed). Still, the ease
with which this information can be accessed online increases the significance of the

be easy. That said, the circulation of misleading rhetoric can only make the task more

there are certainly many reasons for seeking to correct online misinformation, includ-

of a requirement of methodological rigor enables the use of unscientific research and
biased information to justify products and services.63
Special civil remedies also exist under the Competition Act. Section 36 (1) states that

. The Competition Tribunal is a specialized adjudicative body
that handles most matters relating to advertising misrepresentation. However, there is
precedent for handling such matters in the courts. In Maritime Travel Inc. v Go Travel

ScotiaCourtofAppeal,heldthataplaintifftravelagencyhadsufferedcompensableloss
due to a second travel agency’
s advertisements comparing its price to a misrepresenta-
tion of the plaintiff’
s.64 The same principle of loss found in s.36 would logically apply to
misrepresentations made by health care providers or health care product companies,
online or otherwise, to patients/consumers who subsequently experience harm or loss,
though case law in this vein is currently lacking.65
Health Canada has a mandate to approve or deny proposed natural health prod-
ucts, to determine labeling requirements for them, and to regulate advertising relating
to them. Specific changes to the federal Natural Health Product Regulations in 2015
now require homeopathy vaccines (also referred to as nosodes) to include on their la-
bels the statement that ‘
[t]his product is neither a vaccine nor an alternative to vaccina-
tion. This product has not been proven to prevent infection. Health Canada does not
recommend its use in children and advises that your child receive all routine vaccina-
tions’
.66 The press release for these changes also indicated that Health Canada will no
longer approve ‘
specific health claims on homeopathic remedies for cough, cold and flu
for children 12 or under’
,unless the claims are backed by scientific evidence.67 This is
an important first step in curbing inaccurate representations, though tighter regulation
involving bans on unproven claims in all contexts would be beneficial. A 2016 proposal
fromHealthCanada,currentlyintheconsultationstage,wouldchangethestandardfor
natural health products to one that only allows claims that are supported with scientific
proof.68 The adoption of this standard would finally require de facto truth in advertis-
ing among natural health products in Canada. However, the proposal is being strongly
opposed by the Canadian Health Food Association, and its future is uncertain.69
Better regulation of product claims will help establish science-based norms that will
likely reduce, in the long term, the number of false claims found on Canadian websites.
Yet, Health Canada has limited power to directly regulate the claims made on the web-
sites we studied. The Food and Drugs Act and Regulations only apply to advertisements

Abroad, the USA has recently undertaken a truth-in-advertising approach to deal
with unproven remedies. On November 15, 2016, the FTC, which is responsible for
marketing regulation in the USA, released an ‘
Enforcement Policy Statement on Mar-
keting Claims for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Homeopathic Drugs’that changes the
national marketing landscape.71 Under this new policy, the FTC prohibits claims of
efficacy and safety for OTC homeopathic drugs that are not supported by ‘
competent
and reliable’scientific evidence, unless the promotion also clearly communicates that
there is ‘
no scientific evidence that the product works’and that the product’
s claims are
‘
based only on theories of homeopathy from the 1700s that are not accepted by most
modern medical experts’
.72 These statements must stand out on the product and must
be featured in close proximity to the claim of efficacy.73
There are many other examples where regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions have
used truth-in-advertising policies to curb the proliferation of unproven claims and
therapies.74 This approach seems likely to help create an expectation for a more

science-informed approach to marketing in this context. Still, merely creating adver-
tising policy and enforcing it upon receipt of a complaint is unlikely to result in im-
mediate widespread compliance, especially since the accused parties sometimes sub-
sequently refuse to comply.75 Therefore, Health Canada and the Competition Bureau
should adopt proactive enforcement methods that actively identify and eliminate false
andmisleadingclaimsandpractices,usingsuccessesinotherjurisdictionsasatemplate.
2. Self-regulation
Naturopaths present themselves as evidence-based, and governments have echoed
this position.76 The provincial health professional and naturopathy statutes and
regulations by which naturopaths are granted self-regulation (as is the case in British
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario) create provincial colleges
of naturopathy that are typically responsible for setting standards of practice and for
enforcing them among members.77 The Ontario Naturopathy Act’
s Professional Mis-
conduct Regulation, for example, states that it is an act of professional misconduct to
recommend or provide a treatment ‘
the member knows or ought to know is unneces-
sary or ineffective’
.78 Further listed acts of professional misconduct include ‘
making a
claim respecting a drug, substance, remedy, treatment, device or procedure other than
a claim that can be supported as reasonable professional opinion’
, and ‘
permitting the
advertising of the member or his or her practice in a manner that is false or misleading
or that includes statements that are not factual or verifiable’
.79
Based on these regulations, it would be logically consistent to take disciplinary ac-
tion against members who give their clients false information about vaccines and who
suggest unproven or disproven alternatives. Yet, there is little evidence that appropriate
enforcement takes place. Indeed, a national journalist recently reviewed the websites of
approximately 300 active naturopaths in Toronto, and found that almost half of them
breached the advertising rules of the College of Naturopaths of Ontario.80 Moreover,

r Responding to naturopathic anti-vaccination rhetoric
since Alberta legislated self-regulation in 2012, the provincial college has engaged in
only one investigation of misconduct by a member, in the context of the highly pub-
licized death of child Ezekiel Stephan.81 A similar lack of policy enforcement by self-
regulating bodies of alternative practitioners has been observed in other jurisdictions,
including Australia and New Zealand.82
The regulatory bodies that govern and represent the profession have, to date, largely
been silent or have taken remarkably soft positions on vaccination. For example, of all
the naturopath college websites in Canada, only the College of Naturopaths of Ontario
site contains content that speaks directly to homeopathic vaccines and vaccines in a
way that restricts allowable claims to those that are scientifically proven.83 In this case,
Health Canada’
s position is merely reiterated.84
Conversely, the British Columbia Naturopathic Association has published a posi-
tion paper on vaccination that supports a vaccine-hesitant approach.85 The document
is an excellent example of the ambiguous attitude of the naturopathic community to
vaccines. It purports to explain the advantages and disadvantages of vaccination, at one
point implying that the risks are equivalent to the benefits. The document notes that
vaccine preventable ‘
diseases can cause injury or death in a less than robustly healthy
infantorchild’

.86 It contains a list of unsub-
stantiated concerns such as the alleged presence of toxic preservatives and the unnat-
ural route of entry of vaccines.87 The document suggests that vaccines are helpful only
because without them ‘
parents run the risk of their child encountering a virile disease
agent at a time when their child’
s immune system may be compromised by stressors
such as injury and poor nutrition’

is scientifically inaccurate.
Moreover, though it is not a self-regulating body, the Canadian Association of
Naturopathic Doctors indicates on its website that, at its most recent 2015 biennial
conference held for the purpose of educating its naturopath membership, it featured a
presentation in which the speaker claimed that ‘
vaccines do not confer immunity’
,that
homeopathic vaccines can ‘
help treat miasms created by vaccinations’
, and that ‘
acute
diseases can improve the constitution’
.89
Documents and claims of this nature are clearly contradictions of claims made by
naturopathic institutions that the practice is evidence-based. Along with the noted
lack of enforcement of self-proclaimed standards by colleges, it is reasonable to con-
clude that self-regulation is, at best, ineffective, and, at worst, a podium upon which
naturopaths can legitimize scientifically inaccurate perspectives.90 As such, increased
regulatory restrictions, a related reduction in powers of self-regulation, and third party
oversightofdisciplinaryfunctionscouldallcontributetocurbingtheharmfulrepresen-

3. Common law disclosure requirements
Informed consent has many components, but importantly requires the disclosure of
information about the proposed intervention, including any material, special and un-
usual risks, and potential treatment alternatives.91 Indeed, disclosure must include any-
thingareasonablepersoninthepatient’
spositionwouldwanttoconsiderbeforegiving
consent.92 The standard of disclosure is the same regardless of whether the treatment
is conventional or alternative in nature.
Naturopaths are increasingly positioning themselves as primary care providers.93
As health care providers, they are legally responsible to uphold existing common law
standards of informed consent.94 The fact that they are not physicians does not exempt
them from this responsibility. Indeed, the courts have applied the duty of disclosure to

r Responding to naturopathic anti-vaccination rhetoric
other practitioners such as nurses, chiropractors, and even veterinarians.95 As such, if a
naturopath wishes to recommend a homeopathic vaccine instead of a real vaccine, he
or she has a legal obligation to disclose existing evidence (known to him/her) that the
homeopathic vaccine does not work, and that there is a highly efficacious alternative
in the form of a vaccine. Where a naturopath does not make these disclosures, he or
she may be guilty of negligence. Deception or lack of disclosure is not legally justified
by the potential benefits of the placebo effect.96 It should be noted that medical doc-
tors likely have a similar obligation if they wish to refer to unproven practitioners like
naturopaths.97
The law is quite settled in this area, but policing of those who breach these legal stan-
dards appears to be scarce in the context of complementary and alternative medicine.
So while the existing consent law is likely not a tool that can be easily used to police
the misleading claims on websites, it can be used to enforce a science-based standard of
disclosure that may help to counter the misinformation.98 In addition, if this standard
becomes more well known, it may help to promote a more science-informed approach,
and aggrieved patients may be more likely to pursue remedies.
The common law can potentially provide remedies, in parallel with s.36 of the Com-
petition Act, to patients and consumers who act on misleading advertising to their detri-
ment. The torts of deceit and fraudulent misrepresentation can be used to obtain reme-
dies for loss resulting from misleading advertising. Indeed, an ongoing lawsuit in the
B.C. Supreme Court about alleged misrepresentation by a cold and flu remedy manu-
facturer includes a claim under the Act as well as in tort.99 While there is no Canadian
case law directly on point, it seems reasonable to conclude that this law would apply to
statements made on practitioner websites and, therefore, could serve as a potential reg-
ulatory tool in the fight against the spread of misinformation. The tort of negligent mis-
representation requires proof of five elements. First, there must be a duty of care based
on a ‘
special relationship’between the representor and representee. Second, the mis-
representation must be untrue, inaccurate, or misleading. Third, the representor must
have acted negligently in making the misrepresentation. Fourth, the representee must
have relied in a reasonable manner on the negligent misrepresentation. Fifth, the re-
liance must have been detrimental to the representee.100 Fraudulent representation is
different and requires proof of a specific intent to deceive.101 Given the lack of scien-
tific evidence for recommending against vaccination and for recommending homeo-
pathic vaccination, it is likely that naturopaths making such suggestions are engaging in

negligent misrepresentation—though, to date, we are unaware of any negligent mis-
representation jurisprudence in Canada focused on representations by a naturopath.
4. Potential criminal implications
A naturopath who recommends homeopathic vaccines or who counsels against
conventional vaccination could potentially be criminally negligent. Section 219 of the
Criminal Code of Canada [Code] states that ‘
[e]very one is criminally negligent who,
in doing anything, or in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do, shows wan-
ton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons’
.102 Subsection (2) goes
on to state that, for the purposes of criminal negligence, ‘
duty’means a duty imposed
by law;103 a legal duty in this context is one arising from statute or from the common
law.104 The Code creates a legal duty for anyone ‘
who undertakes to administer surgical
or medical treatment to another person or to do any other lawful act that may endanger
the life of another person’to ‘
have and to use reasonable knowledge, skill and care in
so doing’
.105 This duty is a uniform standard, meaning the requirement of reasonable
knowledge, care, and skill is based on the treatment or lawful act in question, not on
the level of experience of the person administering it.106 As such, naturopaths offering
services similar to medical doctors will be held to the same standards under the Code.
Criminal negligence occurs due to the ‘
failure to direct the mind to a risk of harm
which [a] reasonable person would have appreciated’
.107 Fault is premised on the
wrongful act involved, rather than the guilty mind of the perpetrator.108 Naturopaths
counseling patients against vaccination are arguably undertaking a lawful act that en-
dangers the life of another person (especially in the case of a young child, elderly indi-
vidual, or immunocompromised person), breaching s.216 of the Code.109 In addition,
since relevant legal duties include those arising through the common law,110 natur-
opaths could alternatively be criminally negligent for failing to satisfy the aforemen-
tioned duty of reasonable disclosure inherent to standard of care in tort. In the context
of a community with diminished vaccination rates, either failure could be considered
wanton or reckless, as it may greatly and needlessly endanger the patient. However,
under the standard for criminal negligence, the trier of fact must ‘
assess whether the ac-
cused’
s conduct, in view of his or her perception of the facts, constituted a marked and
substantial departure from what would be reasonable in the circumstances’
.111 This is
similartothestandardofgrossnegligence,soultimatelyafindingofcriminalnegligence

r Responding to naturopathic anti-vaccination rhetoric
CONCLUSION
There is reason for concern over the decrease in vaccination rates in Canada. While
numerous factors coalesce to cause this complex phenomenon, negative or hesitation-
inducing representations of vaccines by naturopaths and other alternative practitioners
seem likely to play an important role. Our survey of naturopath websites in Alberta and
B.C. demonstrates the not-uncommon presence of misleading positions on vaccines.
The information presented here exists on a continuum. On one end are examples of
websites subtly raising issues over vaccine safety and effectiveness. On the other are
explicit anti-vaccination perspectives raising suspicions and fears. Vaccination alterna-
tives offered by these naturopathic websites are, without exception, unproven or dis-
proven, and reliance on these products in lieu of vaccines creates a false sense of immu-
nity while exposing both the individual and the surrounding community to potential
harm.
It is essential that we combat these dangerous misrepresentations. Various legal
and policy approaches could be taken to address this issue. The Competition Bureau
and Health Canada could modify advertising standards to prohibit all clearly unsub-
stantiated treatment and performance claims online, and the latter could even act
to prevent entirely the sale of demonstrably ineffective natural health products like
homeopathicvaccines.Afterall,theseproductsneednotbeintrinsicallyharmfultoulti-
mately cause harm. Provincial regulation has helped to legitimize naturopaths, making
their claims more persuasive.113 It would be wise to roll back the scope of naturopath
self-regulation, and to establish third party oversight and management of disciplinary
bodies.114 Ifnaturopathsweretrulyanevidence-basedprofessionandheldtoascience-
informed standard, one would expect the relevant regulatory bodies to take action on
the misleading advertising. Naturopaths genuinely interested in the science of health
carewouldlogicallyalsobeopenandwelcomingtosuchchanges.Thescopeofofferings
available for naturopaths to advertise would certainly be diminished, and these changes
would likely entail a ban on naturopaths providing any advice or service relating to vac-
cination, other than a referral to an appropriate, science-informed, healthcare provider.
As a result, we could expect an improvement in the accuracy of representations made
to Canadians trying to make difficult health care decisions. Misrepresentations relating
to vaccination can be matters of life and death. As such, it is essential to employ the
various legal tools that could be used to help address this dangerous social trend.
113 Naturopaths regularly reference the fact that they are government regulated when advertising their legiti-
macy. For example, ‘
Naturopathic physicians are licensed primary care providers; they are the equivalent of
a GP in the realm of alternative medicine. They are regulated just as MDs, nurses and other health profes-
sionals are licensed and regulated’

114 While describing the exact nature of this oversight mechanism is beyond the scope of this paper, this could
be a government-created entity that monitors claims made by alternative providers. Given that it seems im-
possible for science-free providers to self-regulate in a manner that would impose a science-informed stan-
dard, an independent third party seems a logical way forward. To be clear, we are not endorsing the exis-
tence of these regulatory bodies. Indeed, Caulfield has argued that their creation was a mistake. See, for exam-
ple, http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/timothy-caulfield-dont-legitimize-the-witch-doctors (ac-
