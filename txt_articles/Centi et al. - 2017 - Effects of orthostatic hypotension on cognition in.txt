Effects of orthostatic hypotension on
cognition in Parkinson disease
ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the relation between orthostatic hypotension (OH) and posture-
mediated cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) using a cross-sectional and within-
group design.
Methods: Individuals without dementia with idiopathic PD included 18 with OH (PDOH) and
19 without OH; 18 control participants were also included. Neuropsychological tests were
conducted in supine and upright-tilted positions. Blood pressure was assessed in each posture.
Results: The PD groups performed similarly while supine, demonstrating executive dysfunction in
sustained attention and response inhibition, and reduced semantic fluency and verbal memory
(encoding and retention). Upright posture exacerbated and broadened these deficits in the PDOH
group to include phonemic fluency, psychomotor speed, and auditory working memory. When
group-specific supine scores were used as baseline anchors, both PD groups showed cognitive
changes following tilt, with the PDOH group exhibiting a wider range of deficits in executive func-
tion and memory as well as significant changes in visuospatial function.
Conclusions: Cognitive deficits in PD have been widely reported with assessments performed in
the supine position, as seen in both our PD groups. Here we demonstrated that those with PDOH
had transient, posture-mediated changes in excess of those found in PD without OH. These
observed changes suggest an acute, reversible effect. Understanding the effects of OH due to
autonomic failure on cognition is desirable, particularly as neuroimaging and clinical assessments
collect data only in the supine or seated positions. Identification of a distinct neuropsychological
profile in PD with OH has quality of life implications, and OH presents itself as a possible target for
intervention in cognitive disturbance. Neurology® 2017;88:17–24

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is among the most commonly reported nonmotor manifesta-
tions in persons with Parkinson disease (PD), with prevalence as high as 53%.1 Symptoms
include lightheadedness, fatigue, neck pain, presyncope, and syncope.2,3 The causes can include
both CNS and peripheral nervous system degeneration.4 Dopamine replacement therapies have
been implicated as well.5
OH is associated with cognitive impairment. Even when controlling for systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP), both elderly and younger individuals with OH show relative deficits in verbal mem-
ory and sustained attention, both of which are predictors of subsequent cognitive decline that is
greater than would be expected in the context of normal aging.6
Idiopathic PD is itself associated with cognitive deficits. Historically, these were thought to be
limited to psychomotor/information processing speeds and caused by disease-specific subcortical
pathologies.7 However, deficits across executive functions are present, even in cases without

 significant motor slowing, and are attributed to
an alteration of connectivity between prefrontal
and striatal regions, where dopaminergic and
cholinergic projections are abundant.8–12 An
updated model of cognitive decline in PD is
now appropriately characterized as a disconnec-
tion syndrome.13
We hypothesized that cognition is transiently
impaired during OH in PD and that persons
with PD and OH would have cognitive deficits
that are more severe than those with PD without
OH. We used standard autonomic assessment
tools to determine whether OH would be asso-
ciated with immediate effects on cognition as
well as impairment independent of posture.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents. The study was approved by the Boston
University and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institu-
tional Review Boards. All participants provided written informed
consent.
Study sample. Fifty-five individuals without dementia partici-
pated in the study: 18 patients with PD and neurogenic OH
(PDOH), 19 normotensive patients with PD without OH
(PD), and 18 control participants (controls). OH was defined
as a sustained reduction in SBP of at least 20 mm Hg or a reduc-
tion in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of at least 10 mm Hg dur-
ing the first 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt on a 608 tilt
table.14 All groups were matched on age, education, and male:
female
ratio.
Control
participants
were
not
excluded
if
maintained on antihypertensive medications, so long as they
were normotensive at the time of testing and had no evidence of
OH. The Mini-Mental State Examination was used as a general
cognitive screening with a cutoff of 27 for controls and 25 for PD.
The cutoff for PD was lower to account for disease-specific (i.e.,
motor) errors that are not associated with dementia.15 Participants
also received the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II),16 the
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS),17 and the Beck Anxiety
Inventory (BAI).18 For those with PD, side of symptom onset,
Hoehn & Yahr motor stage, and treatment history were
obtained. All met clinical criteria for mild to moderate idiopathic
PD (Hoehn & Yahr stages I-II). Dopaminergic therapies were
converted to levodopa equivalent dosages.19
Autonomic assessment. Assessment of autonomic functioning
was completed in accordance with standardized clinical protocols.
Participants were instructed to remain on all medications as pre-
scribed and to eat a light breakfast the morning of testing. Testing
was scheduled for a 12:00 PM start time to minimize diurnal
effects on hemodynamics. Upon arrival, participants were allowed
a 20-minute rest in the supine position to attain psychological
and physiologic equilibration. RR interval, beat-to-beat blood
pressure (Finometer; FMS, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and
oscillometric blood pressure (Dinamap; Critikon Company,
Tampa, FL) were measured for 5 minutes in the supine
position, followed by 15 minutes in the 60-degree tilted position.
Prespecified exclusion criteria included any subjective symp-
toms associated with orthostasis (lightheadedness, dizziness) that
were rated as severe (.8 on a 10-point Likert scale), significant
tachycardia (.150 BPM), or SBP in the range associated with
presyncope/syncope. Of the 55 participants who met eligibility,
none was excluded using these criteria. During the testing session,
arterial pressure was measured for 3 minutes at 1-minute intervals
while supine. A battery of neuropsychological tests was then admin-
istered. Participants were then tilted to 608 at a rate of 68/s. Arterial
pressures were again measured at 1-minute intervals for 3 minutes
prior to the start of the second session of testing. Following test
completion, participants were returned to the supine position.
Once systolic pressure returned to within 10 mm Hg of baseline,
this sequence (supine-tilt) was repeated for sessions 3 and 4.
Throughout the assessment, participants reported subjective symp-
toms using the same 10-point Likert scale introduced during the
initial screening. To control for the effects of subjective symptoms
on cognitive performance, a score of 8 or higher was used to
determine data exclusion; no participants met this criterion.
Cognitive assessment. The Wechsler Test of Adult Reading
(WTAR) was administered prior to testing as a measure of pre-
morbid verbal intelligence.20 Each of the 4 testing sessions was
completed in approximately 15 minutes. For each session, the
order of test administration was counterbalanced, and validated
alternate forms or split-halves were used in each subsequent
session to maintain internal consistency. All tests with visual
stimuli or motor components were adapted for projection on
a large screen at approximately 538 visual angle with responses
given orally.21 Specific tests included the following.
Attention/executive functioning. A Stroop test was used as
a measure of sustained attention and response inhibition (color vs
color-word conditions)22; the Digit Span Test (forward [DSF],
backward [DSB]) to assess basic auditory attention (DSF, DSB)
and working memory (DSB); the Arithmetic test to assess working
memory and logical reasoning23; Verbal Fluency tests (phonemic
and semantic) to assess lexical retrieval processes24; and the Symbol
Search Test to assess visual scanning and psychomotor speed.23
Memory.
The
Consortium
to
Establish
a
Registry
for
Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) Verbal Learning Test was used
to assess verbal memory. Variables analyzed included scores on
the first recall trial, the total encoded words across trials (total
score), learning slope, and delayed recall (assessed 10 minutes
after the final learning trial).25
Visuospatial functioning. The Hemifield Lines Test was used
to measure right/left biases in 2 conditions. For this measure, a line
presented in one hemifield changes incrementally in size until the
participant perceives it to be the same size as a line of constant
length in the opposite hemifield.26 The Line Bisection test was used
to determine egocentric reference point, and the Visual Depen-
dence test was used to assess line orientation and angle judgment.26
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
v17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Analyses of variance with Tukey
post hoc analysis were used to examine group differences on clinical
measures except for median Hoehn & Yahr score (x2 analysis).
Group differences in baseline supine conditions were analyzed
using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc analysis.
Paired-samples t tests were used to detect differences from supine to
tilted performance in within-group cognitive performance, and
change in z score performance from supine to tilted positions was
used as an index of relative impairment. The a for cognitive
measures was 0.01 to correct for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS Study sample. None of the participants met
criteria for dementia. There were no differences across
groups with regard to age, male:female distribution, or

 premorbid verbal IQ. PD groups were similar with re-
gard to left/right side of symptom onset, disease stage/
duration, and levodopa equivalent dosages (table 1).
Patients with PDOH were more likely to be on anti-
hypotensive medications than control and PD groups.
Controls were more likely to be on antihypertensive
medications than patients with PDOH but not pa-
tients with PD. Both PD and PDOH groups scored
higher on the BDI-II than did controls (p , 0.05,
both groups) and patients with PDOH scored higher
than patients with PD (p , 0.05). Patients with
PDOH scored higher on the GDS than did controls
(p , 0.05), while differences between PD groups were
not significant. On the BAI, both PD groups scored
higher than controls (p , 0.05) but were similar to
each other.
Hemodynamic measures. There were no significant
group differences in baseline SBP, DBP, or heart rate.
Supine hypertension (SPB .135 mm Hg or DBP
.100) was found in 6 of 19 patients with PDOH, 5
of 18 patients with PD, and 4 of 18 controls (table 2).
Cognitive measures. Supine. Compared to controls, both
PD groups showed impaired cognition (table 3).
Patients with PD performed more poorly than controls
on semantic fluency and on both Stroop conditions.
They also displayed reduced memory encoding and
delayed recall. There were no differences on any visuo-
spatial measures. Patients with PDOH were impaired
relative to controls on several executive tasks, including
DSB, Symbol Search, both fluency tests, and the
Stroop test. They were also impaired on all memory
submeasures, but not on any visuospatial measures.
There were no differences between PD groups on any
cognitive measure.
Upright tilt. Compared to controls, patients with
PD were impaired on several executive measures
and had poorer memory encoding (table 4). Patients
with PDOH, however, performed more poorly than
controls on nearly all executive measures, including
several that did not elicit differences between controls
and patients with PD. Patients with PDOH also had
worse memory encoding than patients with PD.
There were no significant differences between groups
on any measure of visuospatial functioning.
Changes in performance. Within-group, following tilt.
Controls had no within-group changes when supine
and upright performances were compared. Patients
with PD demonstrated deficits when upright relative
to supine on Symbol Search and 2 CERAD subtests
(Learning and Delayed Recall, p , 0.001). Patients
with PDOH showed posture-mediated impairment
on nearly all measures of cognition, including Arith-
metic (p , 0.001), Symbol Search (p , 0.001), both
fluency conditions (p , 0.01), memory encoding and
retention (p , 0.01), and Line Bisection (p , 0.01).
Across-group, following tilt. The change in group-
specific z score following tilt was used as an index of
relative performance (i.e., to control for baseline differ-
ences that may have skewed the effect of postural
change) (figure). There were no significant differences
in the effect of postural change on cognition between
the controls and PD groups. By contrast, patients with
PDOH showed a greater posture-mediated impair-
ment than controls on several tests, including Arith-
metic, Symbol Search, Phonemic Fluency, DSB, the

DISCUSSION We assessed cross-sectional and within-
group, posture-specific neuropsychological performance
to determine the effects of OH on cognition in patients
with PD. When cognition was assessed in the upright
position, we found more widespread deficits in
executive function and memory as well as visuospatial
impairments
in
PDOH
as
part
of
an
overall
exacerbated deficit profile, with a subsequent return to
baseline performance in the supine position. This
transient change was not observed in patients with
PD or control participants and would thus imply
a direct effect of OH.
Cognitive deficits in PD are, at least in part, the
result of central neurodegeneration. This presents a chal-
lenge when determining the relative contribution of
other comorbidities. Reports of cognitive deficits in pure
autonomic failure, where degeneration, at least in the
early stages of the disease, is limited to the peripheral
autonomic nervous system, suggest that hemodynamic
changes may indeed play a contributing role. Cognitive
deficits centered in the domains of memory and execu-
tive functioning have also been observed in autonomic
autoimmune ganglionopathy, a rare disorder in which
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies disrupt trans-
mission across autonomic ganglia, leading to autonomic
failure. Following plasma exchange and titer reduction,
OH resolves and cognition improves.27,28
As expected, both PD groups displayed frontostria-
tal and visuospatial cognitive deficits relative to con-
trols. This pattern is observed in as many as 55% of
all individuals with PD and is most likely the result
of a functional disconnection. Specifically, the basal
ganglia and their dense dopaminergic and cholinergic
projections to multiple cortical regions as well as the
thalamus are selectively affected in a progressive and
disease-specific process.29 It is this central degeneration
that causes global alterations of neurotransmission and
the emergence of numerous motor and nonmotor
signs that are associated with the disease.
We found no meaningful differences across PD
groups while supine. This contrasts with at least
one previous report.30 Unlike this previous study, in
which the participants with PD included those with

 and without supine hypertension, our PD groups
included only normotensive participants. Thus, we
reduced the likelihood of comorbid white matter an-
giopathy, a known and independent risk factor for
cognitive impairment.31–33 PD groups were also
matched across measures of disease duration, motor
symptom severity, and levodopa equivalent dosages.
There is considerable support, therefore, that these
transient decrements in cognition following postural
change are independently related to a failure of cere-
bral autoregulation during orthostatic stress.
The overwhelming majority of clinical neuropsy-
chological tests, if not all, are administered in the
seated position. Based on these results, it seems rea-
sonable to modify assessment methodology in PD
to include testing in a variety of postures. Notably,
none of our participants reported severe symptoms
of OH and many were asymptomatic; nevertheless,
cognitive deficits emerged. Clinicians should consider
incorporating both autonomic and functional cogni-
tive assessments in all persons with PD regardless of
subjective concerns brought forth by the patient. Fur-
thermore, as delayed OH is common in patients with
PD and other a-synucleinopathies, clinicians should
also be mindful of this manifestation of autonomic
failure in those individuals who show a normal hemo-
dynamic response within the first 3 minutes of
standing.34,35
A multiphasic cognitive profile, if detected as part
of a comprehensive assessment across postural changes,
would be instructive for providers and would reveal
otherwise unrecognized targets for intervention. For
instance, impairments in verbal fluency, already noted
in PD, could make it increasingly difficult to commu-
nicate effectively, particularly in the setting of already
reduced nonverbal expression caused by declining
motor functions. This might not be appreciated in
a private office setting, but may manifest when con-
ducting affairs in public spaces where sitting is not
an option and the effects of social anxiety are perhaps
more palpable. Impairments in visual and spatial pro-
cessing could lead to problems in the marketplace,
where searching for wanted items among a varied array
of goods would be a particular challenge. Difficulties
with judging line orientation and egocentric reference
point could affect proprioception and other aspects
of postural stability, thereby increasing the risk of falls
that would otherwise be entirely attributed to motor
features of PD. Again, clinical providers might miss
an important target for intervention when not

 considering the contribution of such cognitive impair-
ment. Working memory problems, along with lapses
in self-monitoring and vigilance, might lead to difficul-
ties in tracking conversations, counting change, or
when processing pedestrian safety signals and other ori-
enting markers, further complicating social interactions
and possibly leading to withdrawal from meaningful
activities.
There are also implications for functional neuro-
imaging studies, including those measuring regional
metabolic activity and markers of network connectiv-
ity, as imaging data are collected while supine and
thus without consideration of posture-induced hemo-
dynamic changes. If the cause of cognitive change in
OH is related to alterations in regional cerebral blood
flow or task-specific metabolic activity as we suggest,
these prior studies may have failed to demonstrate
fully the neurophysiologic underpinnings of cognitive
decline in diseases where OH is present.
It is, of course, difficult to fully rule out all poten-
tial confounds when assessing cognition, particularly
when utilizing repeat assessments and in disease states
where multiple comorbidities are common. With re-
gard to possible iatrogenic effects of dopamine ago-
nists, which have been shown to produce or worsen
OH and cause cognitive deficits, we controlled for
levodopa equivalent dosages and found no associated
differences in OH severity or cognitive perfor-
mance.36,37 We also addressed potential confounds
that would have otherwise affected interpretation of
our neuropsychological test findings. As noted, we
ensured that no participants had severe (hence dis-
tracting) symptoms during tilt, and while reliance on
the subjective report has some inherent flaws, we are
confident that the cognitive changes as observed in
this study were not driven by state-based factors
related to somatic stress. With regard to the potential
threats to validity following repeated neuropsycholog-
ical assessment, several methodologic safeguards were
put in place. We counterbalanced the order of test
administration, used alternate forms when available,
and randomized split-halves when no alternate forms

Prior to analysis of change, all raw scores on cognitive measures were converted to group-specific z scores, where the mean
and SD in the supine position of each specific group (NC, PD, PDOH) were used to determine relative within-group perfor-
mance while under upright tilt. Values reported are for within-group z score change for each measure. Error bars represent

 existed. Perhaps more importantly, had any order or
practice effects emerged, they would have served to
mitigate our hypothesized differences across groups,
as all participants were first tested in the supine
position.
