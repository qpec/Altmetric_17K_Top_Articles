We describe a single-color digital PCR assay that detects and quantifies cancer mutations directly from
circulating DNA collected from the plasma of cancer patients. This approach relies on a double-stranded
DNA intercalator dye and paired allele-specific DNA primer sets to determine an absolute count of both
the mutation and wild-typeebearing DNA molecules present in the sample. The cell-free DNA assay
uses an input of 1 ng of nonamplified DNA, approximately 300 genome equivalents, and has a mo-
lecular limit of detection of three mutation DNA genome-equivalent molecules per assay reaction. When
using more genome equivalents as input, we demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.10% for detecting the
BRAF V600E and KRAS G12D mutations. We developed several mutation assays specific to the cancer
driver mutations of patients’ tumors and detected these same mutations directly from the non-
amplified, circulating cell-free DNA. This rapid and high-performance digital PCR assay can be
configured to detect specific cancer mutations unique to an individual cancer, making it a potentially
valuable method for patient-specific longitudinal monitoring. (J Mol Diagn

In cancer patients, apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells
release their DNA content into the blood. This is
commonly referred to as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA);
one uses either DNA sequencing or molecular genotyping
assays to identify and quantitatively measure those ctDNA
molecules bearing somatic mutations.1,2 Liquid biopsy
specimens are used to detect specific cancer mutations in
ctDNA from the plasma fraction of a standard blood draw,
and detecting mutations in ctDNA has numerous appli-
cations.2 These detected mutations may indicate the type
of tumor present, thus reducing the need for an invasive
tissue
biopsy
specimen.3e5 Longitudinal, quantitative
monitoring of cancer mutations in ctDNA provides in-
formation about the general tumor burden for an individ-
ual patient during treatment.4 For example, elevated levels
of detectable ctDNA mutations are associated with the
presence of higher tumor burden.2,6 One can measure and
quantitatively track the abundance of cancer mutations
from
ctDNA
after
surgical
resection
of
the
tumor.
Furthermore, one can identify mutations that can provide
insight into treatment options; an example of this would
be the presence of hotspot KRAS mutations and the
negative predictive response to antieepidermal growth
factor receptor therapy.5,7,8
Current methods of ctDNA analysis include next-
generation targeted sequencing and fluorescent probee
based digital PCR assays.9,10 Regardless of the method,
several challenges exist in identifying ctDNA mutations.

 concentration, even in those patients with high metastatic
tumor burden. Furthermore, the analysis of ctDNA is
complicated by its short half-life that ranges from several
minutes to hours.1,12e14 Some next-generation targeted
sequencing
and
digital
PCR
methods
rely
on
pre-
amplification of the cell-free DNA to increase the amount
of
DNA
template
and
improve
the
quantitation
of
measurable ctDNA with mutations.15,16 However, a pre-
amplification step introduces polymerase-based errors and
PCR bias that may obscure the accurate detection of
mutations.
To address these challenges, we developed a molecular
assay that uses single-color digital droplet PCR (ddPCR).17
This approach involves partitioning one or several DNA
molecules into individual microvolume droplet reactions,
where a specific PCR amplicon product is generated. We
use single-color intercalator dye (eg, EvaGreen) that binds
to double-stranded DNA, such as PCR amplicons. After
droplet partitioning and thermal cycling, one measures the
droplet-specific fluorescence generated from the interaction
between the single-color intercalator dye and the PCR
amplicon (Figure 1). The resulting single-color dye fluo-
rescent signal has a direct relationship to the size of the
amplicon product.17,18
PCR primers were designed to detect somatic single-
nucleotide variants in cancer mutations. Each assay de-
tects and quantitates a single mutation. A mutation- or
wild-typeespecific
reverse
primer
is
paired
with
a
common target forward primer (Figure 1B). These primer
sets are used in two categories of assays that detect either
a single variant allele or paired alleles in which one
quantitates both the wild-type and variant allele. For the
paired-allele assay, the mutation-specific primer has a
configurable extension tail that differentiates the mutation
amplicons from the wild-type amplicons. The extension
tail
produces
a
different
size
amplicon
product
(Figure 1B). When the droplet fluorescence data are
visualized, this difference leads to the separation of fluo-
rescent clusters composed of either mutation or wild-type
amplicons. By quantitatively measuring and counting the
number of fluorescence-positive droplets, one determines
the number of mutation and wild-type DNA molecules
present for a specific mutation (Figure 1A).17 The primers
were designed to produce small amplicons that cover
genomic segments <150 bases. As a result, one can
readily amplify the highly fragmented, low-molecular-
weight ctDNA molecules bearing cancer mutations. As
already noted, the amplicon extension tail varies the size
of PCR products, thus enabling different amplicons and
multiplexing to be used for single-color ddPCR. In addi-
tion, this single-color assay design avoids the extensive
optimization
required
of
a
third
fluorescent
probe
(ie, TaqMan), as is commonly used in most ctDNA gen-
otyping assays.
In this study, we demonstrate how a series of specific
features of this assay enable the high performance for
detecting mutations. This method’s flexible design allows
for efficient configuration across different cancer mutations,
high sensitivity in detecting mutations at the resolution of
several DNA molecules from ctDNA, and high specificity of
detection for single-nucleotide alterations. Only several
nanograms of cell-free DNA are required without the need
for preamplification, and one can detect as few as three
mutation-bearing molecules in a single reaction. This level

allele genotyping assay, in the context of this
article, refers to combining the wild-type allele
genotyping assay with the mutation allele geno-
typing assay in one ddPCR. To facilitate separation
of droplets based on fluorescence, a noncomple-
mentary tail is added to one of the allele-specific
primers, herein shown as the mutation.

 of sensitivity enables one to detect a 0.10% mutation frac-
tion. By eliminating preamplification, some bias in the ab-
solute quantification of mutation signal can be avoided.
Moreover, these assays can be completed in a matter of
hours (Figure 1A).
First, we demonstrate how specific features of the assay
can be adjusted for improving the detection of different
mutationsdthis is particularly critical given the small
amount of ctDNA that exists in clinical samples. Second,
we developed a series of mutation assays specific to the
cancers of individual patients. We applied these optimized
single-color ddPCR assays on clinical DNA samples,
including cell-free DNA, and identified cancer driver
mutations in the ctDNA specific to a patient’s primary
malignancy.
Materials and Methods
DNA Samples and Processing
The Institutional Review Board at Stanford University
School of Medicine (Stanford, CA) approved the study, and
informed consent was obtained. Each patient had undergone
diagnostic cancer gene sequencing of his or her colorectal
adenocarcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma and had diagnostic
cancer mutation reports available at the time of enrollment
into the study. For all cell-free samples, two EDTA vials
(BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) of blood were collected. Within 2
hours of the initial collection, the blood was spun for 10
minutes at 2000 � g. The plasma fraction was transferred to
a fresh Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) LoBind microtube.
The plasma was spun a second time for 10 minutes at
2000 � g. The spun plasma was subsequently transferred
into Eppendorf LoBind microtubes in 1-mL aliquots and
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at �80�C
until the time of extraction. The Promega (Madison, WI)
Maxwell 16 Circulating DNA Plasma Kit was used to
extract cell-free DNA from 0.5- to 1.0-mL aliquots of the
spun plasma. To extract DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue, a total of 10 sections (5 mm thick)
was collected from each block and the DNA was extracted
using the Promega Maxwell 16 FFPE Plus LEV DNA
extraction kit.
NA18507 wild-type DNA was obtained from the Coriell
Institute (Camden, NJ). Cancer cell lines and related DNA
were obtained through the following sources: ATCC
(Manassas, VA), the Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German

(Braunschweig,

the
National
Institute
of
Biomedical Innovation’s Japanese Collection of Research
Bioresources Cell Bank (Asagi Saito Ibaraki-City, Osaka,
Japan), and Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Additional
cancer cell line information matched to the relevant cancer
mutation is provided in Table 1. DNA was extracted from
the cell lines LS123 and RPMI-8226 (ATCC) using
the Promega Maxwell 16 Cell DNA Purification Kit. DNA
was quantified with the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as well as with a custom simplex
single-color ddPCR assay targeting the human RPP30 gene
(forward, 50-TGCCCTCAATCAGCCCCTGG-30; reverse,
50-TTGCCAAGGAAAATCTAAAGG-30).
As
described
later, this simplex ddPCR assay was used to quantify cell-
free samples.
Assay Design
Using the results from clinical diagnostic sequencing of
the patients’ primary colorectal cancer, two or three
cancer driver mutations were chosen, specific to each
patient, that lead to amino acid substitutions. The selected
cancer driver genes for this study included BRAF, KRAS,
TP53, AKT1, and PIK3CA. Wild-type and mutation-
specific single-allele genotyping assays were designed
for selected mutations from these driver genes. These
assays were configured with a single common forward
primer and two reverse primers that were identical

 except at the 30 base (Figure 1B). The 30 base of the
reverse primers was determined based on the target. It
was either the single-nucleotide variant mutation of
interest or a wild-type reference base. Each primer
length was generally 20 nucleotidesdwhen needed,
the length was adjusted to improve the overall melting
temperature. The primers amplified between 65 and 150
bp of genomic DNA for each mutation of interest. As
previously published, a bioinformatics process of select-
ing primer sequences that are unique in the human
genome and whose melting temperatures are within a 3�C
range was used.19
Designing Paired-Allele Assays
For assays that simultaneously detect DNA molecules for
both the wild type and mutation, a nonspecific 50 exten-
sion tail (ie, repeats of AAAT) was added to the
allele-specific primer of one of the single-allele geno-
typing primer sets (Figure 1B). For a given amplicon,
primers containing different tail lengths were tested, and
the extension tail length that provided the best separation
between the two positive cluster populations was selected
(Figure 2). Because there is no universal tail length for
cluster separation, this extension tail length experiment
was used to identify the optimal length that provided a
distinct separation between the mutation and wild-type
droplet clusters for other paired-allele mutation detec-
tion assays.
All primers were synthesized through Integrated DNA
Technologies (Coralville, IA), Exiqon (Woburn, MA), and
the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility (Stanford,
CA). Primer sequences are noted in Table 2. Primer sets were
optimized using a thermal gradient, and confirmed the PCR
specificity using cancer cell line DNA already known to have
the mutation and normal human cell line DNA (Table 1).
Digital PCR Assay Conditions
For both the validation experiments and patient cell-free
experiments, all samples were analyzed with at least three or
four replicates. Before ddPCR, the cell line and FFPE
genomic DNA samples were treated with an EcoRI (New
England
BioLabs,
Ipswich,
MA)
restriction
digest,
incubating for 8 hours at 37�C, followed by subsequent
65�C incubation for 20 minutes to terminate the reaction.17
Patient cell-free DNA did not require enzymatic fragmen-
tation given that these samples are already highly frag-
mented. All ddPCRs were performed using the Bio-Rad
EvaGreen QX200 ddPCR system and protocol (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Each 22 mL ddPCR used 1�
EvaGreen ddPCR supermix and a final concentration of 50
to 100 nmol/L of each genotyping primer set per reaction
(Table 2). The PCR master mix was partitioned and plated
per Bio-Rad’s QX200 droplet generation protocol. The
thermal conditions were as follows, with a heated lid tem-
perature set to 105�C: one cycle of enzyme activation at
95�C for 5 minutes; denaturation at 95�C for 30 seconds,
immediately followed by annealing/extension between 54�C
and 68�C for between 1 and 2 minutes, depending on the
assay target, for a total of 40 cycles; a final droplet stabili-
zation step at 4�C for 5 minutes; 90�C for 5 minutes; and an
extended 4�C hold. The annealing and extension tempera-
ture and time are noted for each mutation detection assay in
Table 2. After thermal cycling, the plate was transferred and
read by the Bio-Rad QX200 Droplet reader. Amplitude files
were generated using the Bio-Rad droplet reader software,
QuantaSoft version 1.7.4.0917.

 Determining Number of Mutation DNA Molecules
For reporting results, mass was converted to molarity and
the molecular haploid genome equivalents were includedd
this number accurately reflects the molecule-based detection
for these assays. Supplemental Table S1 shows a detailed

Encyclopedia
data
(http://www.cbioportal.org,
accessed
February 14, 2017), cancer cell lines that had the same
driver mutations identified from diagnostic sequencing of
the patient’s primary tumor were identified.20,21 After
obtaining these mutation-matched cancer cell lines, the
concentration of all DNA samples in terms of haploid
genome equivalents was measured. To determine this
genome equivalent concentration, a simplex ddPCR assay
that amplifies the 110 bases of the human RPP30 gene
(forward, 50-TGCCCTCAATCAGCCCCTGG-30; reverse,
50-TTGCCAAGGAAAATCTAAAGG-30) was used. The
master mix and thermal cycling conditions are identical to
the digital PCR assay conditions previously noted in
Materials and Methods, but used a final primer concentra-
tion of 100 nmol/L and a thermal cycling annealing/exten-
sion temperature of 54�C for 1 minute. Using the calculated
genome equivalent concentration and the reported mutation
allele fraction from the cBio website above (Table 1), the
number of mutation and wild-type bearing molecules in
each of the cancer cell line DNA samples was calculated. A
series of DNA mixtures containing different fractional
amounts of mutation-bearing genome equivalents (cancer
cell line DNA) to normal DNA genome equivalents
(NA18507) was prepared. Generally, for any given ddPCR,
approximately 300 genome equivalents of the mixed tem-
plate DNA were used per reaction, equivalent to a final
concentration of approximately 1 ng/mL.
In addition, the above RPP30 simplex DNA assay was
used to measure the concentration of each patient DNA
sample in terms of haploid genome equivalents. This con-
centration was used to adjust the overall concentration of the
DNA dilution series to be equivalent to the cell-free patient
sample. This DNA dilution was then used as a standard
curve and was run in parallel to every patient sample.
Clustering and Quantitation of Mutation Signal
The QuantaSoft version 1.7.4.0917 (Bio-Rad) experiments
were used to assign clusters for simplex assays. The R version
3.2.3 programing language (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://www.R-project.org) was
used
for
additional
analysis
and
generating
plots.
Supplemental Figure S1 provides a simplified workflow of
the automated clustering of paired-allele assays. A data file was
generated that contained up to four replicates of a positive
controlmixturecondition(ie,50:50mutation/wildtype),which
established CIs for all cluster types and served as an empirical
reference model. These reference model data were used to
classify droplets in all assays, including those with unknown
abundances of mutation and wild-type alleles. A droplet was
classified as belonging to a specific cluster type based on the
distance of its fluorescent signal to a given reference cluster’s
CI. By running individual reactions with no template DNA, the
baseline fluorescence of negative droplets was identified, and
this result was used to determine the threshold of nonspecific
amplification events. Significant droplet fluorescence arising
from the correct amplicon products was defined to be when, on
average, more than one positive droplet was identified among
all replicates. Generally, the negative control replicates did not
haveanysignificantampliconproducts,asindicatedbythe vast
majority of the replicates having no positive droplets.
For each mutation assay, a series of DNA mixtures con-
taining different fractions of mutation and wild-type mole-
cules was generated. These DNA mixture series were used
during optimization and validation of all assays. As
mentioned in DNA Mixtures for Mutation Quantitation, these
series were also adjusted to be the same concentration as
clinical cell-free DNA samples and then used as a standard
curve when testing patient ctDNA. This standard curve was
used in two capacities: to generate the reference model and
establish CIs, and to validate the linear range of detection of
assays in line with patient mutation detection assays. If the
negative control of a standard curve showed positive fluo-
rescent signal, linear regression was performed on the in-line
standard curve and was used to interpolate the fraction or
percentage of mutation genome equivalent molecules for a
given patient ctDNA of FFPE sample. Inclusion of a multi-
point standard curve alongside patient cell-free samples pro-
vides an in-line measure of the assay function; however, in
practice, multiple replicates of mixed template (ie, 50% mu-
tation) and negative control template (ie, 0% mutation) are
sufficient to generate the CIs required to automatically cluster
patient data, as described in the previous paragraph.
Statistical Analysis
Correlation analyses were performed using the Pearson
correlation coefficient and associated two-tailed P values.

 These values and linear plots were generated using Prism 7
statistical analysis software version 7.0a (GraphPad Soft-
ware, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Prism 7 was also used to perform
the linear regression analysis method mentioned above to
interpolate the percentage mutation. Additional plots were
generated using the R programing language (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://www.
r-project.org). A one-sided t-test was used for determining
significance among different assay conditions and back-
ground signal.
Results
For
this
single-color,
droplet-based
dPCR
assay,
we
describe several of the critical parameters that enable this
assay to detect rare mutations from ctDNA. All experiments
were run in triplicate or greater per sample and used
genomic or cell-free DNA directly without any pre-
amplification steps. For assay development and performance
testing, we used a series of mixed DNA dilutions of normal
control and cancer cell line DNA containing known frac-
tions of mutation to wild-type genome equivalents. Using
the critical parameters that are described, we designed a
series of wild-type and mutation-specific assays that were
present in the primary colon adenocarcinomas of the pa-
tients in the study. The selected cancer driver genes for this
study included BRAF, KRAS, TP53, AKT1, and PIK3CA. As
a demonstration of this assay’s application on ctDNA, we
ran our single-color mutation detection assays directly on
cell-free DNA. Finally, the assay was also used on degraded
DNA of poor quality originating from clinical FFPE tumor
samples.
Amplicon Length Affects Performance for Paired-Allele
Assays
For paired-allele assays, a nonspecific 50 extension (ie, re-
peats of AAAT) was added to the mutation-specific primer
(Figure 1B). It was observed that different mutations
showed variable characteristics in terms of the fluorescent
droplet quantitation and clustering of mutation versus wild-
type amplicons. We determined how different tail extension
lengths influenced the separation of clustering and accurate
genotype measurements (Figure 2). For these studies,
primers were designed for the KRAS G12V (c.35 G>T)
mutation, and tested primer with different tail extensions
ranging from 12 up to 100 bp. These assays used DNA
composed of a 1:1 mixture of the normal control NA18507
DNA and the cancer cell line RCM-1 DNA (Figure 2). For
the KRAS G12V amplicons with 12, 24, or 39 bp length, the
mutation cluster was not clearly separated from the wild-
type cluster. At 60 bp or greater, the mutation droplet
cluster separated without any overlap from the droplet
cluster composed of wild-type amplicons. As a result, the
fractional representation of the KRAS G12V (c.35 G>T)
mutation versus wild-type alleles matched the reported
values in the cancer cell line. Similarly, for the other mu-
tations, we determined the appropriate tail length. The
primer sequences, including tails, for all assays are noted in
Table 2.
Comparing the Single- versus Paired-Allele Assays
A single-color detection assay targeting the hotspot muta-
tion KRAS G12D (c.35 G>A) was designed. Using a total of
300 genome equivalents for each sample, a series of DNA
mixtures using normal NA18507 DNA and cancer cell line
GP2d DNA such that the fraction of mutation genome
equivalents ranged from 43.0% to 0.0% of the total 300
(Table 1) was prepared. For these experiments, the perfor-
mance of the single-allele (ie, simplex) assay was compared
with the paired-allele assays using these different mixture
samples. Figure 3A shows the results of this comparison as
a two-dimensional clustering plot. The fractional represen-
tation of the detected mutation versus wild-type genome
equivalents matched the expected values of the DNA
mixtures for both the single-allele and paired-allele assay
formats. Figure 3B displays a plot of the expected
percentage mutation at each fraction versus the average
detected percentage mutation, with the variance as deter-
mined from replicates. The Pearson correlation coefficient
R2 was calculated to be 0.9971 (P Z 0.0342) and 0.9999
(P < 0.0001) for the single- and paired-allele assays,
respectively. Overall, these high correlation values indicated
that the single- versus paired-allele assays demonstrate
similar performance for this mutation.
Primer Features that Improve Detection Specificity
To improve the assay’s base-pair specificity for mutation
detection in some cases, the allele-specific primers (Figure
4A) were altered to contain a single mismatched based
this change in the primer sequence decreased the binding
efficiency for nontarget alleles (Figure 4B). The approach
was tested for the KRAS A146V (c.437 C>T) mutation.
Both mutation and wild-type primers were tested with all
possible options for the third base in from the 30 portion of
the reverse primer. All experiments were run with three or
more replicates.
Supplemental Figure S2 summarizes the mismatch opti-
mization results for the KRAS A146V. For this experiment,
normal control DNA from NA18507 was used as the tem-
plate. Different mutation-specific versus wild-type primers
were tested to evaluate the presence of off- versus on-target
amplification. The results are visualized using a two-
dimensional plot of droplet fluorescent amplitude. The

primer

alterations

amplification
(Supplemental Figure S2A). After substituting the third base

Figure S2B), it was evident from the decrease in off-target

 positive droplets that the mismatched base reduced the off-
target primer binding. For example, when substituting the
third base for either a G or a T, no off-target molecules were
amplified, as noted by the lack of positive droplets. In
contrast, when substituting a C, as indicated by positive
droplets,
off-target
molecules
were
identified.
When
comparing the wild-type clusters for every substitution
condition, the primers containing G bases provided more
distinct clusters in the wild-type assay than the primers
containing T bases. In combination, the G base substitution
provided the most specific and distinct clusters for both the
mutation and the wild-type sequences. The same method
was used to improve the detection specificity of primers for
the PIK3CA H1047R (c.3140 A>G), KRAS G12D (c.35
G>A), and KRAS G12V (c.35 G>T) mutations, as listed in
Table 2.
Comparison of Different Primer Sets to Detect the BRAF
V600E
We determined whether modified nucleotides improve the
performance of single-color ddPCR genotyping, particularly
for the BRAF V600E (c.1799T>A) mutation. As a test, a
locked nucleic acid nucleotide (LNA) was introduced in the

nating from the cancer cell line LS411N DNA and the
normal standard NA18507 DNA were used (Table 1). We
prepared the mixtures so that the fraction of mutation
genome equivalents ranged from 68.0% to 0% of the total
genome equivalents assayed per reaction. The quantitative
signal from the decreasing fractional abundances of muta-
tion and wild-type molecules was measured using the BRAF
assay. All experiments were run with three or more
replicates.

BRAF

assays:

primer,
ii) single-allele LNA primer, and iii) paired-allele DNA
primer assays. The simplex DNA assay did not accurately
quantify
the
low-fraction
components
of
the
DNA
mixture series, as denoted by a low correlation coefficient
R2 value of 0.0749. In contrast, when using the simplex
LNA assay, the fractional representation of the detected
mutation versus wild-type genome equivalents matched
the expected values of the DNA mixtures. Compared with
the nonmodified oligonucleotide simplex assay, the LNA
assay’s
R2
correlation
coefficient
was
significantly
improved at 0.9985 (P Z 0.0006), suggesting a linear
detection range. For the LNA assay, the negative controls
did not show any significant signal. Thus, the addition
of the LNA base led to a significant improvement in
detection
sensitivity
compared
with
the
non-LNA
simplex assay.
Finally, the paired-allele BRAF V600E assay was tested
with DNA primers that lacked the LNA nucleotides. It was
determined that the paired-allele assay had a correlation
coefficient R2 of 0.9988 (P Z 0.0006), indicating that
detection behaved in a highly linear manner. The negative
controls did not show any significant signal. Overall, the
paired-allele assay provided mutation fraction results that
corresponded to the range of mutation allelic fractions ex-
pected from the DNA mixtures. When comparing the per-
formance of the simplex LNA versus the paired-allele DNA
assays, both had similar detection performance.
Detection Specificity for Different KRAS Mutations
To determine the specificity of the genotyping detection and
quantitation, we designed and tested two separate paired-
allele assays for either the KRAS G12D (c.35 G>A) or
KRAS G12V (c.35 G>T) mutation; these mutations differ
by only a single nucleotide at the same codon position.
Ideally, a paired-allele KRAS G12D genotyping assay
should not amplify the KRAS G12V mutation and vice
versa.
We identified two colorectal cancer cell lines that had
different KRAS mutations (eg, GP2d for KRAS G12D and
RCM-1 for KRAS G12V). Using each cell line DNA, we
prepared two separate series of DNA mixtures with normal
control NA18507 DNA to a final concentration of 300
genome equivalents per sample reaction. For both KRAS
G12D and G12V mutations, we prepared two mixed DNA
samples such that the fraction of mutation genome equiva-
lents represented either 10.0% or 1.0% of the total 300
genome equivalents. Normal DNA without cancer cell line
DNA (NA18507) was included as a negative control. Three
assay types were tested: i) single-color, paired-allele KRAS
G12D; ii) single-color, paired-allele KRAS G12V; and iii)
commercially
available

KRAS
G12D assay (Bio-Rad) with the KRAS G12V 10.0% muta-
tion condition. All samples were run with three or more
replicates.
Both single-color KRAS mutation assays had base-pair
specificity, only amplifying their specific mutation target
when using the matched cancer cell line DNA (Table 3). For
example, when the RCM-1 cell line having the KRAS G12V
mutation was tested, the G12D assay did not detect either a
10.0% (P Z 0.0003) or a 1.0% fraction (P Z 0.0233)
compared with the G12V assay. Likewise, when testing the
GP2d cell line DNA for the KRAS G12D mutation, the

 G12V assay did not detect the 10.0% (P Z 0.0014) or 1.0%
(P Z 0.0475) fraction compared with the G12D assay.
A commercially available paired-allele TaqMan probe
KRAS G12D (c.35 G>A) assay using the GP2d cell line
DNA was tested for comparison (Table 3). Running five
replicates, we analyzed GP2d and identified a 49.7% �
0.6% mutation fraction. A 10.0% KRAS G12V DNA
mixture was generated using the RCM-1 cell line. When we
ran the TaqMan KRAS G12D assay on this sample, three
clusters were identified: a negative cluster, a wild-type
cluster, and a nonewild-type cluster that represented 7.9%
� 1.8% of the total positive droplet population. This cluster
represents the G12V mutation. Thus, the TaqMan probe
G12D assay demonstrated a nonspecific signal from the
different mutation. These results agree with a previous
report in which it was observed that the TaqMan-based
KRAS G12D assay did not discriminate among different
KRAS mutations.25 Overall, these results suggest that the
single-color mutation detection assay provides quantitative
single-nucleotide specificity for single-nucleotide variant
mutations, unlike the TaqMan probe assay.
Mutation Limit of Detection at 0.1%
We sought to determine whether the single-color assay
could detect a 0.1% allelic fraction for the BRAF V600E
(c.1799 T>A) and KRAS G12D (c.35 G>A) mutations. A
series of DNA mixtures with an increasing number of
genome equivalents being assayed per sample reaction for
both mutations was prepared. The lowest fraction was 0.1%.
Each DNA sample had between 2000 and 3000 genome
equivalents per reaction. For the BRAF V600 assay mixture
series, DNA from the cancer cell line LS411N and normal
control DNA from NA18507 were used (Table 1). For the
KRAS G12D mixture series, DNA from the cancer cell line
GP2d and normal control DNA from NA18507 were used
(Table 1).
For this experiment, the BRAF V600E and KRAS G12D
paired-allele assay used standard oligonucleotides and had
no LNAs. More than five replicates were run for each
sample, and average values of the mutation fractions with
SDs are reported for each sample. These results are sum-
marized in Table 4. Using the paired-allele assays, we
detected on average 0.7% � 0.3% and 1.0% � 0.3% mu-
tation in the 1.0% mutation condition for the BRAF V600E
and KRAS G12D assays, respectively, both of which were
significantly greater than the negative control DNA condi-
tion (P < 0.0001 for both assays). This result is additionally
supported seeing that no signal from mutation-bearing
molecules was detected across wild-type DNA control
replicates. Converting from the fraction mutation to the
number of mutation genome equivalent molecules detected,
we observed an average of 15.2 � 6.5 BRAF V600E mu-
tation genome equivalents and 20.8 � 6.3 KRAS G12D
mutation genome equivalents.
For the 0.10% mutation fraction, we detected 0.11% �
0.08% and 0.12% � 0.10% for the BRAF V600E and KRAS
G12D assays, respectively. These values were also deter-
mined to be significantly greater than the negative control
using the wild-type DNA (P Z 0.0004 for BRAF V600E,
and P Z 0.0016 for KRAS G12D). The negative controls
with either no DNA or wild-type DNA alone demonstrated
no mutation PCR product signal. The correlation coefficient
R2 of the detected percentage mutation with respect to the
expected percentage mutation was 1.00 (P < 0.0001) for the
BRAF V600E assay and 1.00 (P < 0.0001) for the KRAS
G12D assay, thus indicating linear detection. These results
demonstrated that the single-color, paired-allele BRAF
V600E and KRAS G12D assays accurately detected a 0.10%
mutation fraction. The linear range of detection requires
higher genome equivalent sample inputs to resolve lower
allelic fraction mutations.

 Identifying Different Cancer Mutations from ctDNA
Based on the diagnostic primary tumor sequencing and
genotyping results, we identified several driver mutations in
the primary tumors of six individual cancer patients; Pa-
tients 5297, 5606, 5790, 5792, and 5397 were all diagnosed
with colorectal cancer, and Patient 5788 was diagnosed with
cholangiocarcinoma. Three patients were not receiving
active treatment at the time of sample collection (Patients
5297, 5606, and 5788), whereas three were receiving
ongoing chemotherapy (Patients 5790, 5792, and 5793). A
series of assays was designed that matched the mutations
from these patients (Table 5).
To enable validation of each assay’s performance,
different cancer cell lines that had the same mutations found
among the primary tumors were selected (Table 1). For the
TP53 R175H (c.524 G>A), TP53 E285K (c.853 G>A),
AKT1 E17K (c.49 G>A), KRAS A146V (c.437 C>T),
KRAS G12V (c.35 G>T), and PIK3CA H1047R (c.3140
A>G) mutations, we used the cancer cell lines LS123,
RPMI-8226, PL-21, KU1919, RCM-1, and RKO, respec-
tively. The sensitivity and specificity of each assay were
measured by generating a series of DNA mixtures that
contained known ratios of normal control DNA from
NA18507 and cancer cell line DNA (described in Materials
and Methods). Each reaction contained approximately 300
genome equivalents, and mixtures were prepared such that
the fraction of mutation genome equivalents to normal wild-
type genome equivalents ranged from 50.0% to 1.0% of the
total genome equivalents assayed per reaction. A normal
control DNA reaction (NA18507) was also included as a
negative control for all assays.
The expected percentage mutation versus the average
detected percentage mutation for each assay was plotted
individually in Supplemental Figure S3; the KRAS G12D
plot can be found in Figure 3B. Across all assays, we
observed high Pearson correlation values, with R2 > 0.98
(P < 0.01), suggesting all of the assays had a linear
detection performance. All mutations did not show any
significant signal in the negative controls. The only excep-
tion was for the AKT1 E17K assay that had had a raw
background droplet count of 3.0 � 4.0 positive droplets in
the negative control.
For testing the cell-free DNA, we used the cell line DNA
dilution samples to provide standard curve points. Namely,
the highest fraction of mutation genome equivalents pro-
vided the result for CIs that were then used to cluster each
patient
sample
reaction
(described
in
Materials
and
Methods). This step was important given that our proced-
ure ensures that we can detect a low allelic fraction repro-
ducibly. The droplet counts were converted to haploid
genome equivalents to determine the number of mutation-
bearing molecules present in the sample and then deter-
mined the mutation allelic fraction and percentage mutation.
The DNA concentration of the cell-free samples was
measured
as
previously
described
in
Materials
and
Methods, and all were within a 10-fold concentration
range (Figure 6A). All six patient samples were tested with
their respective mutation detection assays (Table 5), and
identified tumor-derived ctDNA molecules from three of the
six patients. Patient 5297’s cancer had TP53 R175H (c.524
G>A), AKT1 E17K (c.49 G>A), and KRAS A146V (c.437
C>T) mutations. All three mutations from ctDNA were
identified as well (Figure 6B). The mutation allele fractions
for the TP53 R175H, AKT1 E17K, and KRAS A146V mu-
tations were 59.3% � 13.5%, 34.3% � 1.5%, and 63.4% �
2.1% mutation, respectively. On average, 47.2 � 16.0, 61.2
� 3.9, and 133.1 � 1.4 mutation-bearing molecules per
microliter were identified for TP53 R175H, AKT1 E17K,
and KRAS A146V, respectively.
Patient 5606’s primary tumor had KRAS G12V (c.35
G>T) and PIK3CA H1047R (c.3140 A>G) mutations.
Analysis of the ctDNA identified the KRAS G12V mutation
at 8.3% � 2.9%; this is equivalent to 8.5 � 2.9 mutation-
bearing
molecules
per
microliter
(Figure
6B).
The
PIK3CA mutation was identified at 0.9% � 1.1% mutation
allelic fraction. However, after calculating the number of
mutation-bearing molecules, the average number of positive
mutation-bearing molecules was only 0.3 � 0.4 molecules
per microliter. This did not constitute significant signal over
that of the background signal. Compared with the KRAS
mutation, the lower levels of the PIK3CA H1047R mutation
may be an indication that this driver event may occur in
only a fraction of the tumor metastatic sites.
Finally, Patient 5788’s tumor had a TP53 E285K (c.853
G>A) mutation. From the cell-free sample collected, we
identified
TP53
E285K
at
1.1%
�
0.2%
mutation
(Figure 6B). This was equivalent to 1.5 � 0.3 mutation-
bearing molecules per microliter, on average.
For Patients 5790, 5792, and 5793, no detectable ctDNA
molecules were observed for their mutations (PIK3CA
H1047R, KRAS G12D, and KRAS G12V, respectively). The
wild-type sequences were identified in all three of these
cases. As the positive and negative controls showed the
expected result, we concluded that our assay did not detect

Precision Assays for Analysis of Patient FFPE DNA
Previous
diagnostic
genotyping
(DNA
Samples
and
Processing) showed that Patient 1820’s primary tumor had
a KRAS G12D (c.35 G>A) mutation. The KRAS G12D
assay was tested on the DNA extracted from FFPE colo-
rectal adenocarcinoma. FFPE-extracted DNA is subject to
degradation and chemical cross-links that compromise the
analyte quality and adversely affect the performance of
molecular assays. Thus, this test provided information about
the single-color ddPCR assay’s performance on low-quality
DNA.
For Patient 1820, we obtained matched FFPE tissue
samples that included colon tissue adjacent to the tumor,
dysplastic tissue without invasive carcinoma, and fully
invasive carcinoma from the primary cancer. All three
samples were tested in triplicate using our wild-type muta-
tion pair KRAS G12D assay. We determined the average
fraction of mutation versus wild-type genome equivalents as
well as the associated SD. For the KRAS G12D mutation,
the adjacent colon tissue, dysplastic, and malignant samples
had fractional measurements of 1.6% � 1.1%, 12.5% �
4.9%, and 10.4% � 1.5%, respectively. Converting the
fraction to the number of detected mutation-bearing mole-
cules, this represented an average of 3.2 � 2.0, 26.1 � 9.8,
and 20.3 � 2.9 molecules from the adjacent colon tissue,
dysplastic tissue, and tumor samples, respectively. Gener-
ally, the three negative control replicates did not have any
significant amplicon products, as defined by having, on
average, more than one positive droplet among all repli-
catesdmost negative control replicates had no positive
droplets. The presence of the KRAS mutation in the colon
tissue sample suggests that the KRAS mutation was an early
cancer driver event before the development of invasive
carcinoma and present in adjacent colon tissue as a
subclone.
Discussion
With the emergence of precision cancer medicine, there is
an increasing need for new tests to evaluate patients at the
time of diagnosis, during treatment, and for routine longi-
tudinal clinical monitoring. Liquid biopsy specimens are
traditionally used to analyze circulating cell-free DNA
molecules and enable longitudinal monitoring for precision
cancer medicine.1,2 To address the need for rapid, accurate
methods for analyzing ctDNA, we developed a single-color
ddPCR assay for detecting cancer mutations from ctDNA at
single-molecule resolution. This study demonstrates that

Detecting cancer mutations from
patient cell-free DNA. A: Bars represent the con-
centration of circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA)
extracted from cancer patients using the RPP30
ddPCR assay (described in Materials and Methods).
One to three replicates were run per sample,
depending on sample availability. The diagnosis of
each patient is abbreviated below the number,
as colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) or chol-
angiocarcinoma (CCA). B: Bars represent the
average percentage mutation detected for each
target single-nucleotide variant (SNV) listed from
patient-derived cell-free DNA. Below bars are the

 single-color ddPCR assays can be successfully applied to
ctDNA from clinical samples.
The
single-color
assay
has
several
advantages
compared with traditional fluorescent probes, including
the following: i) ease of design and testing, ii) no
requirement for specialized probe reagents, and iii) robust
detection performance for resolving point mutations. We
validated the sensitivity and specificity of this assay using
control DNA mixtures composed of decreasing fractional
abundances of mutation-bearing cell line DNA genome
equivalents. To provide highly accurate mutation-bearing
molecule quantification, we used a standard curve in
parallel when analyzing each patient cell-free DNA sam-
ple. We demonstrated the sensitivity and specificity at
1.0% fraction using 300 genome equivalent, or approxi-
mately 1 ng per assay, thus minimizing the blood and
DNA sample requirements for analysis. By increasing the
number of genome equivalents assayed per reaction, one
can
also
improve
the
sensitivity
of
detectiondwe
demonstrated robust detection of the BRAF V600E and
KRAS G12D at a 0.10% fraction. By avoiding the pre-
amplification of patient circulating cell-free DNA, we
avoid
some
of
the
complexity
and
issues
of
pre-
amplification steps. In addition to the high sensitivity, the
assay provides single bp specificity for the intended target
mutation, as shown when using KRAS mutation assays
that only differ by a single nucleotide.
In summary, our single-color ddPCR assay can be
customized for a variety of different mutations and thus
designed for an individual patient. For future development,
we are seeking to improve the scalability of designing as-
says with highly parallel evaluation of primer candidates
across tens of thousands of cancer mutations. If successful,
this scalability would improve our ability to generate
customized mutation primers.
