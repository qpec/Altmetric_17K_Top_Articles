Abstract Pioneering work with nonhuman primates and recent human studies established
intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) as a method of inducing
discriminable artificial sensation. However, these artificial sensations do not yet provide the
breadth of cutaneous and proprioceptive percepts available through natural stimulation. In a
tetraplegic human with two microelectrode arrays implanted in S1, we report replicable elicitations
of sensations in both the cutaneous and proprioceptive modalities localized to the contralateral
arm, dependent on both amplitude and frequency of stimulation. Furthermore, we found a subset
of electrodes that exhibited multimodal properties, and that proprioceptive percepts on these
electrodes were associated with higher amplitudes, irrespective of the frequency. These novel
results demonstrate the ability to provide naturalistic percepts through ICMS that can more closely
mimic the body’s natural physiological capabilities. Furthermore, delivering both cutaneous and
proprioceptive sensations through artificial somatosensory feedback could improve performance
and embodiment in brain-machine interfaces.

Introduction
The absence of somatosensation profoundly diminishes a person’s ability to move and interact within
their environment (Cole and Cole, 1995; Sainburg et al., 1993). Even with intact vision and hearing,
which can provide sensory information about body position, movement, and interaction, basic
behaviors such as walking or reach-and-grasp require substantially greater cognitive load without
somatosensory feedback. The severity of these deficits underscores how deeply integrated cutane-
ous and proprioceptive somatosensations are in the neural control of movement, and motivates the
problem of restoring sensation when it is missing. However, the complexity of the somatosensory cir-
cuit, and the difficulty of writing information into this circuit with sufficient integrity, have posed sig-
nificant challenges. Recent advances in brain-machine interface (BMI) technology have led to
renewed efforts in this area, under the hypothesis that providing closed-loop motor-sensory control
and feedback pathways could lead to vital increases in performance (Bensmaia and Miller, 2014).
Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is a promising technique for implementing a return path in
which electrical stimuli are written directly into the somatosensory cortex through implanted

SHORT REPORT
 electrode arrays. Non-human primates (NHPs) successfully incorporated ICMS information to per-
form discrimination, detection tasks (Romo et al., 1998; Romo et al., 2000; Tabot et al., 2013;
Dadarlat et al., 2015) and as sensory feedback for brain control in BMI tasks (O’Doherty et al.,
2011; Klaes et al., 2014), and recent human studies have provided insight into the feeling and per-
ception of the sensations produced through ICMS (Flesher et al., 2016). However, qualities ascribed
by human subjects to these sensations (e.g., ‘tingling’ or ‘buzzing’) have been mostly artificial in
nature (Johnson et al., 2013; Flesher et al., 2016), and it is as yet unclear what range of sensations
could be elicited through ICMS. Here, we present novel findings from two experiments: one which
tested each electrode over a range of amplitudes with fixed frequency, and one which tested a sub-
set of electrodes over a range of amplitudes and frequencies. We found reliable elicitation of natural
cutaneous and proprioceptive sensations spanning a range of stimulus amplitudes and frequencies,
obtained from stimulation in S1 of a single human subject (participant FG, Figure 1; see Materials
and methods) with a C5-level spinal cord injury. We further show that current amplitude, not fre-
quency, of the electrical stimulus differentiates the modality (i.e., cutaneous or proprioceptive) of the
elicited percept at some stimulation sites.
Results and discussion
In Experiment 1, over an eight-week period, electrical stimuli were tested across a range of current
amplitudes between 20–100 mA, with pulse frequency held constant at 150 Hz (see Materials and
methods). Stimulation through 46/96 electrodes (48%) prompted at least one response, and there
were in total 381 reported sensations out of 1229 non-catch trials (see Materials and methods).
There was weak correlation between the number of electrodes that elicited a sensation and the cur-
rent amplitude (r = 0.34, p=0.42, Pearson linear correlation). Additionally, we found no correlation
between electrode impedance and the likelihood of elicited percepts (p=0.80, Pearson linear corre-
lation coefficient), pooling all electrode responses over all days. Furthermore, there was no signifi-
cant difference in the aggregate impedances of either electrodes that produced or did not produce
percepts (p=0.707, Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test). No false positives were reported in any
eLife digest Nerves throughout the body send information about touch, temperature, body
position and pain through the spinal cord to the brain. A part of the brain called the somatosensory
cortex processes this information. Spinal cord injuries disrupt these messages. Even though the
somatosensory cortex has not been damaged, sensation is lost for the affected body areas. No
treatment exists to repair the spinal cord so the loss of sensation is permanent.
Applying electricity to the somatosensory cortex can produce artificial sensations. Scientists are
testing this approach to restore a sense of touch for people with spinal cord injury. Early
experiments show that using different patterns of electrical stimulation generates unnatural
sensations in different body parts. People receiving the stimulation describe it as tingling or shocks.
Scientists wonder if they can improve the technique to mimic feelings like touch or body position to
make it easier for people with a spinal injury to move or use prostheses.
Now, Armenta Salas et al. generated more natural sensations in a person with a spinal cord
injury. Instead of taking the usual approach of delivering large currents to the surface of cortex, they
inserted small electrodes into the inside of the cortex to stimulate it with small currents. In the
experiments, electrodes were implanted in the somatosensory cortex of a volunteer who had lost
the use of his limbs and torso because of a spinal injury. Armenta Salas et al. applied different
patterns of electrical stimuli and the volunteer reported what they felt like. The patient described
sensations like a pinch or squeeze in the forearm or upper arm with certain patterns. In some cases,
the patient reported the sensation of the arm moving with stronger electrical currents.
The experiments show that electrical stimulation of the brain can recreate some natural
sensations. These sensations could help patients using robotic or prosthetic arms become more
dexterous. It might also help patients view artificial limbs as part of their bodies, which could
improve their sense of wellbeing.

 catch trials, and we found no effect of trial history in the proportion of reported sensations during
stimulation (see Materials and methods). The stimulation did not trigger any painful sensations, and
no adverse events occurred during any of the sessions.
Receptive fields along the upper arm, forearm and hand corresponded to coarse somatotopical
organization in the corresponding stimulation sites. Figure 2 shows the most frequently reported
receptive field and sensation modality for each electrode across all trials. Of the 46 electrodes with
responses, 32 evoked percepts in the upper arm, 18 in the forearm, and two in the hand (palmar sur-
face of digits and a finger pad). In agreement with previous reports, stimulation could produce per-
cepts with variably-sized receptive fields in different electrodes (Flesher et al., 2016). For the
majority of electrodes (24/46), receptive fields were reported in the same body region (i.e. upper
arm or forearm) or in the same plane (i.e. anterior or posterior) across all tested amplitudes. Coarse
somatotopy was present between the medial and lateral arrays (Figure 2B); the medial array was

 more likely to have reliable receptive fields in the anterior upper arm (46% of medial-array receptive
fields), while stimulation on the lateral array induced sensation more frequently on the posterior fore-
arm (51% of lateral-array receptive fields). However, there was no clear somatotopical organization
within each array as previously reported (Kim et al., 2015a; Kaas, 1983; Flesher et al., 2016). The
coarse somatotopy found across arrays but not within arrays, could be due to the small area of cor-
tex sampled by the implants, and the fact that the implants predominantly covered upper arm and
forearm, areas with a less established somatotopic map (Kaas et al., 1979; Kaas, 1983). Another
plausible explanation is that the topography in somatosensory cortex has been remapped after
injury (Kaas et al., 1983; Florence et al., 1998; Moore et al., 2000)
FG has reported a wealth of qualitative sensations induced by ICMS (Table 1). Unlike paresthetic
sensations experienced post-injury, these naturalistic responses were broadly characterized as cuta-
neous (e.g. squeeze) or proprioceptive (e.g. rightward movement), and as being subjectively similar
to sensations experienced prior to injury. At his own discretion, the subject used single-word
descriptors to characterize the perceived sensations as accurately as possible. Single-word descrip-
tors have the advantage that they can be compared across large data sets or subjects. However, as
experimental advances continue to push the capabilities of ICMS, responses could become more
complex and future studies might benefit from more structured descriptors, which take into consid-
eration the complexity of these sensory experiences (Darie et al., 2017).

Neuroscience
 We found that 18 electrodes had cutaneous-only responses across all tested current amplitudes,
while six electrodes had proprioceptive-only responses; the rest of the electrodes (22/46) had mixed
responses, where the perceived modality (cutaneous or proprioceptive) varied as stimulus parame-
ters changed. Of these mixed-response electrodes, 45% evoked mostly cutaneous sensations, 32%
evoked mostly proprioceptive sensations, and 23% had an equal number of cutaneous and proprio-
ceptive sensations (Figure 2B). This pattern of cutaneous and proprioceptive evoked sensations
complements recent reports of multimodal (i.e. cutaneous and proprioceptive) neurons throughout
S1 (Yau et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015b). While prior single-unit experiments have defined maps
from single neurons to specific unimodal receptive fields (Kaas et al., 1979; Kaas, 1983;
Friedman et al., 2004; Romo et al., 2000), the above results suggest that more than one variable
may be represented when mapping with ICMS. This finding may be the product of different mecha-
nisms by which receptive fields are observed through recording versus stimulation, and could be an
important topic for future work. We found a significant difference between the amplitudes that eli-
cited cutaneous or proprioceptive responses, with the distribution of proprioceptive responses
skewed towards higher amplitudes (Figure 3A), when pooling across all electrodes and amplitudes
that produced a sensation (p=0.039, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric ANOVA, c2(1,378)=4.41, proprio-
ceptive responses N = 79, cutaneous responses N = 302). To assess consistent current delivery
across all electrodes, we measured electrode impedance at the beginning of every session and
found no significant difference when comparing proprioceptive or cutaneous responses (p=0.237,
c2(1,378)=1.39) and, furthermore, we found no significant difference between the impedance of pro-
prioceptive- and cutaneous-only (p=0.922, c2(1,155)=0.01) or mixed-response electrodes (p=0.372,
c2(1,221)=0.8). To account for potential bias from an uneven distribution of responses across ampli-
tudes, we compared the proportion of proprioceptive and cutaneous responses in a bootstrapped
resampling (N = 10000), in which each repetition drew 15 responses at each amplitude from all data
pooled across days (Figure 3B). We observed a clear relationship between the number of proprio-
ceptive and cutaneous responses and stimulation amplitudes, measured through overall positive
slopes in the 1st-order polynomial fit at each iteration for proprioceptive responses, and negative
slopes for cutaneous responses (Figure 3C).
Experiment 2 tested a subset of 5 electrodes with robust responses across all tested amplitudes
in Experiment 1 (Figure 2B, Figure 3D). In a pseudorandomly-interleaved fashion, we stimulated
each electrode with five amplitudes (range 20 to 100 mA) at six different frequencies (range 50 to
300 Hz) over the course of three consecutive days (see Materials and methods). We reproduced the
effect of amplitude on sensation modality, either proprioceptive or cutaneous, when pooling across
all responses (p=2�10�5, c2(1323)= 18.17, Figure 3E). Similar to the main mapping task, we did not

 find any significant effect on modality due to electrode impedance (p=0.305, c2(1323)=0.8). Further-
more, there was no significance when testing the effect of frequency in eliciting proprioceptive or
cutaneous responses (p=0.22, c2(1323)= 1.48).
This amplitude-specific effect on sensation modality is perhaps surprising given the more com-
monly observed effect of frequency and pulse-width modulation on sensation in the periphery
(Graczyk et al., 2016). Although there is evidence of tactile and proprioceptive inputs co-modulat-
ing S1 firing activity (Kim et al., 2015b), we are unaware of any reported effect of amplitude or fre-
quency thresholding for different sensory modalities in the CNS. Proprioceptive sensations are
commonly thought to derive from activity in areas 2 or 3a, while cutaneous sensations more likely
correspond to activity in areas 3b and 1. From topographical features, we estimate our implants lie
in area 1; however, with evidence of interindividual variability in the microstructural organization
within S1 (Geyer et al., 1999), and the potential for functional reorganization after injury
(Kaas et al., 1983; Florence et al., 1998), it is possible that higher current amplitudes could
increase the effective range of stimulation to include sensory areas 3a or 2. Moreover, given the

 receptive fields activated during stimulation, the two implants are well within the arm and forearm
regions of S1, which might receive a larger ratio of proprioceptive-to-cutaneous signals than hand
regions (McKenna et al., 1982), making it more likely to activate these different modalities with
ICMS.
FG also provided subjective measures of sensation intensity and duration. Sensation intensity was
ranked from 1 to 10 (weakest to strongest). In Experiment 1, we found a strong positive correlation
between intensity and amplitude (r = 0.2, p=2.1�10�5, Pearson linear correlation coefficient), with
an intensity of 2.4 ± 1.9 a.u. (mean ±s.d.) for 20 mA and 4.0 ± 2.1 a.u. for 100 mA, with a slope of 0.02
(1st-order polynomial, least squares fitting). As subjective measures of intensity are most likely sensi-
tive to day-to-day variability, in post-hoc analysis we also normalized intensity values within each ses-
sion (see Materials and methods). We measured a negative correlation between the current
amplitude and the standard deviation of the intensity (r = �0.6, p=0.12). Duration of the percept
was recorded for each response as either short (sensation lasts only briefly at the onset of stimula-
tion), medium (sensation persists throughout the stimulation but not for the full length of the stimu-
lation) or long (sensation lasts the full duration of the stimulation). The majority of responses were
short (N = 225), followed by medium (N = 122) with very few long responses (N = 12). Stimulus dura-
tion was not recorded for 22 responses of the 381 responses. For Experiment 2 this trend was repli-
cated (N = 268, 55 and 1. Short, medium and long, respectively). There was no relationship between
duration of the sensation and either amplitude of stimulation (p=0.1, c2(1323)=4.53) or frequency of
stimulation (p=0.2, c2(1323)=2.83).
To our knowledge, this is the first report in human of replicable, purely naturalistic proprioceptive
and cutaneous sensations induced through ICMS. Stimulation over a wide range of amplitudes and
frequencies generated qualitatively diverse sensations, although percept modality was strongly
linked to variations in amplitude. Pairing these natural sensations with BMIs create a unique opportu-
nity to explore how effectively they can be incorporated in a closed-loop BMI system. For example,
the ability to evoke proprioceptive sensations could allow the subject to interpret position- or move-
ment-related information, as previously reported in primate studies (Tomlinson and Miller, 2016;
Dadarlat et al., 2015), while eliciting cutaneous sensations could improve our ability to deliver richer
somatosensory feedback for object manipulation. Together these somatosensory signals have the
potential to improve performance and embodiment when using a BMI-controlled external device.
Materials and methods
Subject
We recruited and consented a 32-year-old male participant (FG) with C5-level complete spinal cord
injury, 1.5 years post-injury, to participate in a clinical trial of a BMI system with intracortical record-
ing and stimulation. The subject has residual sensation in the anterior-radial section of his upper
arm, and some residual sensation in the posterior-radial section of his upper arm and forearm, which
present as paresthesias. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of
the University of Southern California (USC) and Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Hospital
(RLA). The implant procedure occurred at Keck Hospital of USC, and study sessions took place at
RLA.
Surgical planning and implantation
Surgical planning followed the protocols described in (Aflalo et al., 2015), with an additional task
for identifying an implant location within somatosensory cortex. In this task, a visual cue prompted
the experimenter, who was standing next to the MRI, to reach into the MRI machine with a wooden
pole and repeatedly press at one of three points on the subjects right upper limb where he previ-
ously reported residual paresthetic sensation; biceps, forearm and thenar eminence. The subject was
instructed to attend to any residual sensation he felt at each location and report the number of times
the experimenter touched him on the cued location (Kastner et al., 1998; Staines et al., 2002).
After functional imaging, three target locations for electrode placement were identified; supramargi-
nal gyrus (SMG), ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). One 96-
channel, platinum-tipped Neuroport microelectrode recording array (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt
Lake City, UT) was implanted in each of SMG and PMv. Two 7 � 7 SIROF (sputtered iridium oxide

Neuroscience
 film)-tipped microelectrode arrays (with 48 physically-connected channels each) were implanted in
S1. The SIROF-tipped electrodes have lower impedance than the platinum-tipped electrodes, and
thus are better suited to stimulation.
Stimulation and recording parameters
All stimuli consisted of biphasic, charge-balanced, cathodic-leading pulses, with 200 ms width per
phase, 53 ms interphase interval, and one-second stimulus duration delivered to a single electrode
on the S1 array only. The maximum charge delivered per phase was 20 nC. We selected these
parameters, and set electric charge limits according to safe ranges shown in ICMS studies with NHPs
(Kim et al., 2015a). Stimulation was delivered with a Blackrock CereStim device, and stimulation
parameters were set and delivered using the CereStim API through MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc,
Natick, MA) software (MATLAB code in Source code file 1).
Task
Experiment 1: After initial assessment of implant viability, we evaluated the effects of stimulation
parameters through a percept-detection task. For this primary mapping task, each of the 96 stimula-
tion electrodes were evaluated at eight amplitudes: 20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 mA, at 150
Hz. The subject was seated in a wheelchair approximately 1.5 meters from a TV screen. The subject
was instructed to look at a fixation point in the middle of the screen throughout the experiment. In
each trial, after a three-second inter-trial interval, the subject was presented with a large purple cir-
cle on the screen indicating that an electric stimulus was being delivered. Then, after a one-second
delay, an auditory cue signaled the subject to report whether he felt any sensation. When a sensa-
tion was perceived, the subject reported its location on a body and hand map, with anterior and
posterior views, by referencing a fine overlaying grid (Figure 1). The subject also reported qualita-
tive characteristics including the perceived stimulus intensity, the perceived duration of stimulation,
and a description of the sensation (Table 1). Sensations closer in nature to tactile stimuli were classi-
fied as cutaneous, and those triggering a feeling of movement or change in position were classified
as proprioceptive. To complete the mapping of amplitude, we ran trial blocks where we randomly
selected a subset of electrodes. Each block contained three replicates of stimulation per parameter,
per electrode. An additional set of trials, numbering 10% of the total trials in a block, were added as
‘catch’ trials, where the visual stimuli on the screen and auditory response cue remained identical
but the stimulation did not occur. Catch trials were randomly interleaved among the normal trials. In
each block, trials were ordered such that stimulation did not occur to the same or adjacent electro-
des concurrently.
Experiment 2: For the second mapping task, five electrodes were selected for further evaluation
at different amplitudes and frequencies. All the phases of the task and other stimulation parameters
were the same as in the previous mapping task. The subset of electrodes selected for this task were
those that exhibited the most reliable responses in the first mapping task. We varied the current
amplitude (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mA) and pulse frequency (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 Hz), and tested
each amplitude-frequency combination six times per electrode. The full dataset was obtained over
three consecutive days. In each day, each of the five electrodes received two replicates of all possi-
ble amplitude and frequency combinations. The order of electrode stimulation was determined
pseudorandomly.
Statistics and analysis methods
Throughout the analysis we used the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric ANOVA statistical test. We calcu-
lated correlations between responses using the Pearson linear correlation coefficient.
To examine whether response history had a significant effect on the proportion of reported sen-
sations (de Lafuente and Romo, 2005), we looked at differences between the distribution of
reported sensations during stimulation for three conditions: all trials, trials after a reported sensation
(hit) and trials after no reported sensation (miss). We estimated these distributions for each ampli-
tude in a given experimental session across all tested electrodes, and used Kruskal-Wallis nonpara-
metric ANOVA with Dunn-Sidak multiple comparisons correction to test for significance at each
amplitude. Furthermore, we generated a shuffle distribution of probabilities with N = 10,000 permu-
tations for hits following a hit or a miss for each amplitude. We found no significant difference

 between the shuffle distributions and the empirical data, with the actual proportion being within the
5th-95th percentile range of the shuffle distribution. For the bootstrapped resampling of proprio-
ceptive and cutaneous responses in Experiment 1, we drew 15 samples at each iteration from the
total responses at each amplitude (range 21–93 responses across all amplitudes). Where normalized
intensity data are reported, we rescaled the raw intensity (range 1–10) to a normalized scale (range
0–1) for each day by subtracting the minimum and then dividing by the maximum.
Raw data for all analysis presented in this manuscript can be found as downloadable source data
‘Responses to single-electrode stimulation’. Specific details can also be found in the first sheet of
