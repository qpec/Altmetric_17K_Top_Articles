Physical activity confers considerable health benefits, but 
only half of U.S. adults report participating in levels of aerobic 
physical activity consistent with guidelines (1,2). Step It Up! The 
Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Walking and Walkable 
Communities identified walking as an important public health 
strategy to increase physical activity levels (3). A previous 
report showed that the self-reported prevalence of walking 
for transportation or leisure increased by 6 percentage points 
from 2005 to 2010 (4), but it is unknown whether this increase 
has been sustained. CDC analyzed National Health Interview 
Survey (NHIS) data from 2005 (26,551 respondents), 2010 
(23,313), and 2015 (28,877) to evaluate trends in the age-
adjusted prevalence of self-reported walking among adults 
aged ≥18 years. The prevalence of walking increased steadily 
among women, from 57.3% in 2005, to 62.5% in 2010, and 
to 65.1% in 2015 (significant linear trend). Among men, a 
significant linear increase in reported walking was observed, 
from 54.3% in 2005, to 61.8% in 2010, and to 62.8% in 
2015, although the increase stalled between 2010 and 2015 
(significant linear and quadratic trends). Community design 
policies and practices that encourage pedestrian activity and 
programs tailored to the needs of specific population subgroups 
remain important strategies for promoting walking (3).
NHIS is a continuous in-person survey of U.S. households 
designed to be representative of the civilian, noninstitution-
alized population (5). NHIS consists of a core questionnaire 
that collects basic health and demographic information for 
all family members in a sampled household and supplements 
that collect information about specialized topics. Questions 
specific to walking for leisure and transportation were asked 
of one adult aged ≥18 years per sampled household in the 
2005, 2010, and 2015 Cancer Control Supplements. Sample 
adult response rates were 69.0% (2005), 60.8% (2010), and 
55.2% (2015) (6).
Walking was defined as engaging in at least one 10-minute 
period of transportation or leisure walking in the past 7 days 
at the time of survey. To assess transportation walking, respon-
dents in all 3 years were asked, “During the past 7 days, did 
you walk to get someplace that took you at least 10 minutes?” 
To assess leisure-time walking, respondents in 2005 were asked, 
“During the past 7 days, did you walk for at least 10 minutes 
at a time [for fun, relaxation, exercise, or to walk the dog]?” 
and in 2010 and 2015, “During the past 7 days, did you walk 
for at least 10 minutes [for fun, relaxation, exercise, or to walk 
the dog]?”
Demographic characteristics (sex, age, race/ethnicity, and 
education level) and health-related characteristics (height, 
weight, walking assistance status, and physical activity) were 
also assessed. Meeting the aerobic physical activity guideline of 
at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity equivalent aerobic 
activity per week was assessed using responses on the usual

frequency and duration of light- to moderate-intensity and 
vigorous-intensity leisure-time physical activity (1).
From the initial total sample of 92,257 (31,428 [2005]; 
27,157 [2010]; and 33,672 [2015]), 13,516 (15%) persons 
were excluded, including 2,280 who were unable to walk 
and 11,236 for whom data were missing for walking (6,044), 
physical activity (1,054), health-related characteristics (3,708), 
or demographic characteristics (430). Thus, the final analytic 
sample consisted of 78,741 respondents (26,551 [2005]; 
23,313 [2010]; and 28,877 [2015]).
The proportion (with 95% confidence intervals) of adults 
who reported walking each year was calculated. Linear and 
quadratic trends in walking prevalence from 2005 to 2015 were 
tested using logistic regression, controlling for age group. For 
three time points, a temporal change that includes significant 
linear and quadratic trend terms indicates an overall increase 
or decrease over time as well as a deviation from linearity. For 
example, if the linear trend is positive and quadratic trend is 
negative, this indicates an increase from 2005 to 2015 with a 
stalling or leveling off between 2010 and 2015. Because signifi-
cant interactions between sex and trend terms were observed, 
sex-specific results are presented. Subgroup analyses were 
conducted by age group, race/ethnicity, education level, U.S. 
Census region, body mass index category, walking assistance 
status, and meeting the aerobic physical activity guideline, 
and pairwise differences between subgroups and across years 
were tested using adjusted Wald tests. Statistically significant 
(p<0.05) results are reported. All analyses accounted for the 
complex survey design. Reported estimates are weighted and 
age-standardized to the 2000 U.S. standard population (7).
In 2015, women were significantly more likely to report 
walking (65.1%) than were men (62.8%) (Figure). Among 
women in 2015, the lowest reported prevalence of walking was 
among those aged ≥65 years, non-Hispanic blacks (blacks), and 
residents of the South, compared with their respective coun-
terparts (Table 1). Among men in 2015, the lowest prevalence 
of walking was among blacks and Hispanics and the highest 
prevalence was among men in the West, compared with their 
respective counterparts (Table 2). Among males, there were no 
significant age group differences in walking prevalence. The 
prevalence of walking was lower among men and women with 
a high school education or less, who had obesity, who needed 
walking assistance, or who did not meet aerobic physical 
activity guidelines than among their respective counterparts.
Among women, the prevalence of walking demonstrated a 
significant linear increase from 2005 to 2015, with no significant 
quadratic trend (Figure) (Table 1). This trend remained when 
stratified by selected characteristics, with two exceptions: both 
linear and quadratic trends were significant among women 
who were overweight or lived in the Midwest. The increase in 
walking prevalence among women between 2010 and 2015 was 
significant overall (2.7 percentage points) and among select strata 
(age 45–64 years, age ≥65 years, non-Hispanic whites, college 
graduates, residents of the Northeast and South regions, those 
who were underweight or normal weight, those with obesity, 
and those not needing walking assistance).

characteristics, with one exception: among men aged ≥65 years, 
the prevalence of walking increased by 3.8 percentage points

Discussion
The prevalence of reported walking for transportation or 
leisure among men and women increased between 2005 and 
2015; however, for men, the increase stalled between 2010 and 
2015. This trend among males is similar to trends for leisure 
time physical activity, with the reported prevalence of meeting 
physical activity guidelines increasing steadily from 2008 to 
2012 and stalling between 2012 and 2015 (2).* However, even 
given this increase, nearly one third of women and men report 
that they did not walk for at least 10 minutes in the past week.
Walking is an easy way for most adults to incorporate more 
physical activity into their daily routines. Women are less

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Only half of U.S. adults report achieving physical activity levels 
consistent with published guidelines. Walking is an easy way for 
most persons to be more physically active. Self-reported walking 
among adults increased by 6 percentage points from 2005 to 
2010, but it is unknown whether this increase has continued.
What is added by this report?
The prevalence of self-reported walking among women 
significantly increased from 2005 to 2015 (2005: 57.4%; 2010: 
62.5%; 2015: 65.1%); among men, the prevalence increased 
overall but stalled between 2010 and 2015 (2005: 54.3%; 2010: 
61.8%; 2015: 62.8%). Sociodemographic disparities in walking 
prevalence exist, with the lowest prevalences among non-His-
panic blacks and persons with a high school education or less. 
Moreover, differences by education level appear to have 
widened over time among men, with walking prevalence 
increasing steadily among college graduates but leveling off 
among men with lower education levels.
What are the implications for public health practice?
To promote walking, streets and communities can be designed so 
that walking is a safe and convenient option for all persons. 
Communities can also implement walking programs that are 
tailored to the interests and abilities of specific population 
subgroups. Focused approaches to overcome barriers to walking 
in low socioeconomic status and minority communities, such as 
policies and practices that improve the safety and quality of 
community supports for physical activity (e.g. trails and side-
walks), might help reduce the observed disparities in walking.
likely than men to achieve physical activity levels sufficient to 
meet guidelines (2). However, this study found that walking 
has become increasingly common among women since 2005, 
representing a potential opportunity for addressing the gender 
difference in overall physical activity. Efforts to sustain the 
observed increase in the percentage of adults who walk could 
contribute to more adults meeting guidelines, potentially 
reducing the burden of chronic diseases and premature death 
associated with low levels of physical activity. For example, 
communities can create additional opportunities for walking 
by implementing walking programs tailored to the interests 
and abilities of specific subgroups of the population (3). In 
addition, policies and practices that improve the safety of com-
munities and promote walkable design can help make walking 
a convenient option for almost all persons.
For both women and men, walking was least prevalent 
among blacks and persons with lower educational attain-
ment, groups that have been shown to report lower levels of 
physical activity compared to their counterparts (8). In some 
cases, differences in walking appear to be widening over time. 
For example, among men, walking increased at a steady rate 
among college graduates from 2005 to 2015 (significant linear

trend only), but stalled between 2010 and 2015 among those 
who did not graduate from high school (significant linear 
and quadratic trends). Low socioeconomic status (SES) and 
minority neighborhoods are often perceived as less attractive 
and less safe because of traffic or crime when compared with 
higher SES and majority white neighborhoods (9). Efforts 
to overcome such environmental barriers to walking in these 
communities, like policies and practices that improve the 
safety and quality of community supports for physical activity 
(e.g., trails and sidewalks), might help to reduce the observed 
disparities in walking (3).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, this analysis relies on self-reported data, 
and social desirability bias might result in overestimates of 
walking (10). Second, the wording of the question about 
leisure walking changed slightly between 2005 and 2010; to 
improve comparability between years, participants in all years

 § Significant deviation from linear trend from 2005 to 2015 (p<0.05), based on trend analyses using logistic regression controlling for age category.
 ¶ Significant change from 2010 to 2015 (p<0.05).
 ** “Other race” category includes non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native, and persons reporting more than one race.
 †† Body mass index (weight [kg]/height [m2]) estimates were calculated from self-reported weight and height. Underweight and normal weight: <25.0, overweight: 
25.0–29.9, and has obesity: ≥30.
 §§ Needing walking assistance was defined as being unable or finding it very difficult “to walk one-quarter mile without special equipment.”
 ¶¶ Meeting the 2008 aerobic physical activity guideline was defined as participating in ≥150 minutes of moderate-intensity equivalent aerobic activity per week 
(light- to moderate-intensity minutes plus two times vigorous-intensity minutes).
(1,076 respondents) were categorized as nonwalkers. Third, 
survey response rates could contribute to response bias if non-
responders differed systematically from responders, although 
weighting procedures should reduce the impact of survey 
nonresponse. Finally, approximately 6% of respondents were 
missing walking data each year; the application of sample 
weights would not be expected to mitigate any potential bias 
associated with missing data.
The reported prevalence of transportation or leisure walk-
ing among women and men increased from 2005 to 2015, 
although among men, the increase has stalled in recent years. 
By implementing community and street scale design strategies 
that encourage pedestrian activity and by supporting walking 
programs where persons spend their time, communities can 
improve walkability and make walking a safer and easier option 
for increasing physical activity (3).
