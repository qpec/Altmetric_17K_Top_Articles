BACKGROUND: Recent research efforts on bariatric surgery have focused 
on metabolic and diabetes mellitus resolution. Randomized trials designed 
to assess the impact of bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and 
hypertension are needed.
METHODS: In this randomized, single-center, nonblinded trial, we included 
patients with hypertension (using ≥2 medications at maximum doses or >2 at 
moderate doses) and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m2. Patients 
were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus medical therapy or medical 
therapy alone. The primary end point was reduction of ≥30% of the total 
number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure <140 mm 
Hg and 90 mm 
Hg, respectively, at 12 months.
RESULTS: We included 100 patients (70% female, mean age 43.8±9.2 years, 
mean body mass index 36.9±2.7 kg/m2), and 96% completed follow-up. 
Reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications 
while maintaining controlled blood pressure occurred in 41 of 49 patients 
from the gastric bypass group (83.7%) compared with 6 of 47 patients 
(12.8%) from the control group with a rate ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence 
interval, 3.1–14.0; P<0.001). Remission of hypertension was present in 25 
of 49 (51%) and 22 of 48 (45.8%) patients randomized to gastric bypass, 
considering office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 
respectively, whereas no patient submitted to medical therapy was free of 
antihypertensive drugs at 12 months. A post hoc analysis for the primary end 
point considering the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) target 
reached consistent results, with a rate ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 
1.4–10.6; P=0.005). Eleven patients (22.4%) from the gastric bypass group 
and none in the control group were able to achieve SPRINT levels without 
antihypertensives. Waist circumference, body mass index, fasting plasma 
glucose, glycohemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and 10-year Framingham risk score were 
lower in the gastric bypass than in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery represents an effective strategy for 
blood pressure control in a broad population of patients with obesity and 
hypertension.

iven the current high prevalence of obesity,1 an 
increasing number of hypertension cases occur 
in people with excess weight.2 Several patients 
with hypertension require >2 medications to achieve 
blood pressure control,3 which creates challenges for 
long-term adherence to treatment, and it is well docu-
mented that hypertension is poorly controlled in pa-
tients with obesity.4
Bariatric surgery represents the most effective meth-
od to treat obesity.5,6 Although much recent research 
efforts have focused on metabolic improvement and 
diabetes mellitus resolution, previous studies suggest 
that a significant percentage of patients with coexist-
ing obesity and hypertension are able to reduce or even 
discontinue their antihypertensive medications after 
bariatric surgery.7–10 Because blood pressure control was 
not the primary focus of these studies and most ran-
domized trials were restricted to patients with diabetes 
mellitus, the effects of bariatric surgery in a broader 
population of patients with obesity and hypertension 
remain uncertain. Thus, we designed the GATEWAY tri-
al (Gastric Bypass to Treat Obese Patients With Steady 
Hypertension) to assess the impact of bariatric surgery 
on hypertension improvement in patients with obesity.
METHODS
We will share the database containing unidentified individual 
participant data, data dictionary documentation, statistical 
analysis plan, and analysis code. Beginning 6 months and 
ending 24 months after article publication, the trial steering 
committee will evaluate proposals of studies accompanied by 
a statistical analysis plan and may grant access to the data 
for approved proposals. After 24 months, the database and 
accompanying documents will be publicly available in an insti-
tutional data repository.11
Study Design and Oversight
The study design was published previously.12 Briefly, this is 
a randomized, nonblinded, single-center, clinical trial. The 
follow-up period for the primary end point is 12 months, 
but patients are scheduled for a 5-year extension study. The 
Research Ethics Board at the Heart Hospital approved the pro-
tocol. All patients provided written informed consent.
The trial was coordinated by the Research Institute at the 
Heart Hospital. Ethicon Inc provided unrestricted funding for 
this investigator-initiated trial. All authors had full and inde-
pendent access to all data and vouch for the integrity and 
accuracy of the analysis.
Patients
We included patients 18 to 65 years of age with hyperten-
sion,13 with a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 30.0 to 
39.9 kg/m2, and treated with ≥2antihypertensive drugs at 
maximum doses or >2 drugs at moderate doses (Table I in the 
online-only Data Supplement).14 Exclusion criteria were sys-
tolic blood pressure ≥180 mm 
Hg or diastolic blood pressure 
≥120 mm 
Hg; cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction 
or stroke within 6 months, angina, coronary revasculariza-
tion, heart failure); severe psychiatric disorders because of 
increased risk of low compliance with the study procedures; 
chronic kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy or glomerular 
filtration rate <30 mL/min); secondary hypertension, except 
because of sleep apnea; peripheral arterial disease; atrophic 
gastritis; type 1diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes 
of adults, or type 2 diabetes mellitus with glycohemoglobin 
>7.0%; alcoholism or use of illicit drugs; current smoking; pre-
vious abdominal surgery; severe hepatic diseases; pregnancy 
or women of childbearing age not using effective contracep-
tive methods; cancer in the past 5 years; use of immunosup-
pressive drugs, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy; or inability to 
understand or adhere to study procedures (detailed criteria 
for eligibility are provided in Box I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Randomization
Subjects were randomized (1:1) to either gastric bypass 
combined with medical therapy or medical therapy alone. 
Randomization was performed through a 24-hour central 
web-based automated system.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The current body of evidence on the improvement 
of hypertension after bariatric surgery is reported 
from studies designed for a different primary end 
point, restricted to patients with diabetes mellitus 
or from observational studies.
• In this trial, 100 patients with obesity and hyper-
tension (the majority of whom did not have diabe-
tes mellitus) were randomized to gastric bypass or 
medical therapy alone.
• Patients randomized to gastric bypass were 6 times 
more likely to reduce ≥30% of the total number 
of antihypertensive medications while maintaining 
controlled blood pressure levels.
• In addition, 51% of the patients submitted to gas-
tric bypass showed remission of hypertension.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Bariatric surgery represents an effective strategy for 
reducing antihypertensive drugs in patients with 
obesity and hypertension.
• Given the morbidity of surgery, our results do not 
imply that all patients with obesity and hyperten-
sion should be submitted to bariatric surgery.
• Treatment of hypertensive patients with obesity has 
multiple barriers, including nonadherence to long-
term multiple antihypertensive drugs. Thus, gastric 
bypass represents 1 extra option to help achieve 
blood pressure control.
• Taken together with the improvement of the meta-
bolic and inflammatory profile, such effects have 
the potential to reduce major cardiovascular events.

Treatments
Medical therapy was standardized for all patients based on 
office blood pressure. (The detailed method of office blood 
pressure measurement is described in Materials in the online-
only Data Supplement). Patients were preferably treated 
with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angioten-
sin receptor blockers and a calcium-channel blocker, except 
if these were contraindicated or if the patients already had 
controlled blood pressure with their current regimen. If the 
previously mentioned association was already in use and the 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained >130 mm 
Hg or 
80 mm 
Hg, respectively, a combination with a thiazide diuretic 
was preferred. If a thiazide diuretic was contraindicated or if 
other medications were deemed necessary, then spironolac-
tone or clonidine was used. Medications were reduced or dis-
continued if patients presented systolic blood pressure <110 
mm 
Hg or diastolic blood pressure <70 mm 
Hg. For patients 
with systolic blood pressure between 110 and 130 mm 
Hg or 
diastolic blood pressure between 70 and 80 mm 
Hg associated 
with symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, dose reduction of 
antihypertensive medications was attempted. For patients 
submitted to bariatric surgery, the necessity of reintroducing 
antihypertensive medications was initially checked on a daily 
basis in the immediate postoperative period, in the first visit 1 
week after the procedure, and in the remaining follow-up vis-
its. Adherence to treatment was based on patient self-report. 
Besides medical therapy, patients randomized to the gas-
tric bypass group were submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
performed by a single surgeon (Figure I in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Patients from both groups received nutritional advice based 
on national statements for hypertension and obesity.15 A visit 
to a dietitian from the investigation team followed each medi-
cal visit at the hospital to reinforce the nutritional recommen-
dations previously indicated. Nutritional advice in the medical 
therapy group was mainly directed at weight reduction and 
blood pressure control.15–17 Aimed at progressive weight loss 
over time, a total daily energy consumption calculated as 
20 kcal/kg of ideal body weight per day was recommended 
among the patients. Similarly, for the improvement of blood 
pressure control, the ingestion of high-sodium food, such as 
snacks, sausages, and fast food, was discouraged, and the 
reduction of salt used for cooking at home or added to already 
prepared food was encouraged. Fruit and vegetable consump-
tion was also recommended to increase potassium intake. For 
those patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the 
nutritional advice included information about food consis-
tency in the postoperative period. During nutritional visits, a 
detailed evaluation regarding diet tolerance was performed. 
In addition, all patients received psychological and physical 
activity counseling and were treated for other comorbidities 
according to current guidelines.
Data Collection and Assessment
At baseline, we collected data on demographic information, 
comorbidities, anthropometric values, use of medications, 
and laboratory values. We collected office blood pressure 
at baseline and months 1, 3, 6, and 12. Twenty-four-hour 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) (the detailed 
method of 24-hour ABPM is described in Materials in the 
online-only Data Supplement),18 echocardiogram, ECG, and 
laboratory values were measured at baseline and 12 months.
End Points
The primary outcome was a reduction of ≥30% of the total 
number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining 
office systolic and diastolic blood pressure <140 mm 
Hg and 
90 mm 
Hg, respectively, at 12 months (eg, patients using 2 
or 3 medications needed to reduce ≥1 medication to achieve 
the primary end point; patients using 4 or 5 medications 
need to reduce ≥2). Secondary end points included number 
of antihypertensive drugs, systolic and blood pressure (office 
and 24-hour ABPM), weight and BMI, waist circumference, 
fasting plasma glucose and glycohemoglobin, homeostasis 
model assessment of insulin resistance index, lipid profile 
(low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, and triglycerides levels), uric acid, high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein levels, interventricular septum diastolic 
thickness, a 10-year Framingham risk score, and adverse 
events.
We also measured secondary end points defined post hoc: 
remission of hypertension (defined as systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure <140 mm 
Hg and 90 mm 
Hg, respectively, with-
out medications based on office blood pressure), remission of 
hypertension (defined as systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
<140 mm 
Hg and 90 mm 
Hg, respectively, without medica-
tions based on 24-hour ABPM), and reduction of ≥30% of the 
total number of antihypertensive medications while maintain-
ing an office systolic blood pressure <120 mm 
Hg (SPRINT lev-
els [Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial])19 at 12 months.
Statistical Analysis
The study was initially designed to enroll 60 patients. During 
trial conduct and while blinded to the study results, the 
executive committee decided to increase the sample size to 
100 patients to improve statistical power. This revised sample 
provides 90% power to detect an increase in the probability 
of the primary end point from 10% in the medical therapy 
group to 40% in the gastric bypass group, assuming a 2-sided 
α of 5%.
Continuous variables with a normal distribution are 
reported as mean and standard deviation. Variables with a 
non-normal distribution are reported as medians and inter-
quartile ranges. Categorical variables are summarized as 
frequencies. Main analysis followed the modified intention-
to-treat principle, and missing values were imputed with a 
simple carry-over procedure if the patient had information of 
6-month visit.20 We used the Fisher exact test to analyze the 
primary end point, and results are reported as rate ratios and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs). Continuous end points were 
analyzed with adjustments for baseline values using repeated 
measure analysis of variance models. Variables that did not 
hold a normal distribution assumption were analyzed using 
generalized estimating equation models with distribution that 
better fit the data.
A post hoc analysis was performed to assess the propor-
tion of patients with a reduction number of the total antihy-
pertensive medications of ≥30% while keeping the SPRINT 
target.19 We conducted other 5 sensitivity analyses for the 
primary end point: complete-case analysis, per-protocol

analysis, as-treated analysis, worst-case scenario, and mul-
tiple imputation analysis. Definitions are provided in Table II 
in the online-only Data Supplement. We also conducted an 
adjusted analysis for BMI, number of medications at baseline, 
10-year Framingham risk score, basal insulin level at baseline, 
and duration of hypertension using Poisson regression model 
with robust variance. In all cases, results are presented as rate 
ratios and 95% CIs.
The significance level for the primary end point was 0.05. 
For all other end points, the significance level was 0.05 with-
out adjustment for multiple comparisons. Because of this, all 
secondary end points and analyses should be interpreted as 
exploratory. Analyses were performed using R software, ver-
sion 3.3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Of the 100 included patients from May 2013 to May 
2016, four patients were excluded from the final analy-
sis. One patient withdrew consent after randomization in 
the medical therapy group, and 2 further patients in the 
medical therapy group and 1 in the gastric bypass group 
missed their follow-up visits. Thus, information on the 
primary end point at 12 months is available for 96 pa-
tients (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics are shown in Ta-
ble 1. Groups were well balanced at baseline. The mean 
(±standard deviation) age was 43.8±9.2 years, 70.0% 
were women, the mean BMI was 36.9±2.7 kg/m2, and 
the average duration of hypertension was 9.4±6.7 years.
Primary End Point and Effects on Blood 
Pressure
Reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihy-
pertensive medications while maintaining controlled 
office blood pressure levels occurred in 41 of 49 pa-
tients from the gastric bypass group (83.7%) com-
pared with 6 of 47 patients (12.8%) from the control 
group, with a rate ratio of 6.6 (95% CI, 3.1–14.0; 
P<0.001) (Figure 2A).
Twenty-five of 49 patients (51%) from the gastric by-
pass group showed remission of hypertension (defined 
as systolic and diastolic blood pressure <140 mm 
Hg 
and 90 mm 
Hg, respectively, without medications), 
whereas no patient submitted to medical therapy was 
free of antihypertensive drugs at 12 months (Figure 2B). 
Results were similar considering remission rates based 
on 24-hour ABPM. In this sense, 22 of 48 patients 
(45.8%) from the gastric bypass group showed remis-
sion of hypertension, whereas no patient submitted to 
medical therapy was free of antihypertensive drugs at 
12 months. Additionally, a reduction in the number of 
antihypertensive medications (P<0.001) occurred, as 
well as  in most classes of medications for blood pres-
sure control (Table 2 and Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
A post hoc analysis for the primary end point con-
sidering the SPRINT target reached consistent results 
with rate ratio of 3.8 (95% CI, 1.4–10.6; P=0.005). 
The reduction occurred in 16 of 49 patients from the 
gastric bypass group (32.7%) compared with 4 of 47 
(8.5%) from the control group (Figure IIA in the online-
only Data Supplement). Eleven patients (22.4%) from 
the gastric bypass group and none in the control group 
were able to achieve SPRINT levels without antihyper-
tensives (Figure IIB in the online-only Data Supplement).
Exploratory secondary end points are presented in 
Table 2 and Table IV in the online-only Data Supple-
ment. The office blood pressure during the follow-up 
was similar in both groups (Table 2 and Figure 3). Blood 
pressure levels assessed by 24-hour ABPM were also 
similar between groups (Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement).

Weight Loss
At 12 months, changes in weight and BMI were greater 
in the gastric bypass than in the medical therapy group 
(Table 2 and Figure III in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). The BMI was 26.8±3.7 kg/m2 in the surgical 
group and 36.3±3.9 kg/m2 in medical therapy group 
(P<0.001). Additionally, the waist circumference was 
lower in the gastric bypass group (86.9±8.5 cm) than in 
the control group (109.8.2±9.6 cm, P<0.001). Whereas 
weight decreased progressively during the 12-month 
follow-up in the gastric bypass group, the effect on the 
primary end point was fully achieved on the first month 
and was maintained during the 12-month follow-up 
period (Figure 4).
Glycemic Control and Lipid Profile
Patients who underwent gastric bypass had lower lev-
els of fasting plasma glucose (P<0.001), glycohemoglo-
bin (P<0.001), and homeostasis model assessment of 
insulin resistance (P<0.001) (Table 2). The low-density 
lipoprotein  cholesterol and triglycerides levels at 12 
months were lower in the gastric bypass than in the 
medical therapy group (P<0.001 for both comparisons) 
(Table 2). Conversely, high-density lipoprotein  choles-
terol levels increased in the gastric bypass compared to 
the control group (P=0.05).
Other End Points
A significant reduction in the high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein level was found in the gastric bypass group 
compared with the medical therapy group (P<0.001). 
Uric acid was lower in the gastric bypass group than 
in the control group (P=0.001). Similarly, the interven-
tricular septum diastolic thickness was lower in the gas-
tric bypass group than in the control group (P=0.03), 
and the 10-year Framingham risk score was lower in 
the gastric bypass group than in the medical therapy 
group (P=0.04) (Table 2).
Renal Function
Creatinine levels at 12 months were 0.7±0.1 mg/dL 
in the gastric bypass group and 0.8±0.2 mg/dL in the 
medical therapy group ( <0.001). The glomerular fil-
tration rate at 12 months was 115.3±21.2 mL/min in 
the gastric bypass group and 97.5±22.3 mL/min in the 
medical therapy group (P<0.001) (Table 2).
Adverse Events
Table 3 shows adverse events at 12 months. Six patients 
needed hospitalization in the gastric bypass group ver-
sus none in the control group (P=0.03). Only 2 of them 
were hospitalized because of procedure complications. 
One patient required a reoperation 4 months after sur-
gery because of an abscess near the jejunal anastomo-
sis, and 1 was admitted for vomiting and dehydration. 
Four patients developed cholelithiasis after the gastric 
bypass, 3 were symptomatic, and 1 was asymptomatic. 
All of them were submitted to a laparoscopic chole-
cystectomy, and all recovered uneventfully. One patient 
developed an anastomotic ulcer and was successfully 
treated medically. Anemia was present in 20% and 
10% of participants in the gastric bypass group and 
medical therapy group, respectively (P=0.23).
Nutritional parameters in the gastric bypass group 
showed significant differences from baseline to 12 
months only for anemia, 6% to 20%, respectively 
(P=0.01), and hypovitaminosis B12, 9% to 28%, re-
spectively (P=0.01). No difference for secondary hy-

perparathyroidism, hypoalbuminemia, iron, and ferritin 
deficiency occurred (Table VI in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
There were no deaths, episodes of severe hypogly-
cemia, malnutrition, or excessive weight loss. Five par-
ticipants (11%) in the medical therapy group  showed 
excessive weight gain (increase of >5% over the base-
line value).
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses are presented in Table II in the on-
line-only Data Supplement. An analysis assessing treat-
ment effect on the primary end point adjusted for BMI, 
number of medications at baseline, 10-year Framing-
ham risk score, basal insulin level at baseline, and dura-
tion of hypertension found similar results with a rate 
ratio of 6.3 (95% CI, 3.1–13.0; P<0.001). Accordingly, 
results for the complete-case, per-protocol, as-treated, 
worst-case scenario, and multiple imputation analy-
ses were consistent with those observed for the main 
analysis.
DISCUSSION
Our results indicated that at 12 months, patients with 
obesity and hypertension who underwent gastric 
bypass plus medical therapy were significantly more 
likely to reduce ≥30% of the number of medications 
while maintaining controlled blood pressure than 
patients managed with medical therapy alone. Nota-
bly, half of the patients in the surgical group were 
able to maintain systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
<140 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg, respectively, without 
the need for medications (remission of hypertension), 
whereas no control group patient was free of medica-
tions at 12 months. The post hoc analysis indicated 
that ≈20% of patients in the gastric bypass group 
achieved SPRINT goals19 without medications at 12 
months. In addition, exploratory end points such as 
the number of antihypertensive medications, waist 
circumference, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, insulin 
resistance, glycohemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein, uric acid, and the 10-year Framingham risk 
score were lower in the surgical than in the medical 
therapy group. Thus, despite the fact that the groups 
had similar blood pressure levels at 12 months, pa-
tients submitted to gastric bypass were able to achieve 
these levels with few or any medications and also had 
their metabolic profile improved.
Several observational studies suggested improve-
ment and remission of hypertension after surgery.6,7,9,21 
Previous randomized trials in patients with diabetes 
mellitus also assessed the effects of bariatric surgery on 
hypertension control. In the STAMPEDE trial (Surgical 
Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Dia-
betes Efficiently Trial), the authors observed a signifi-
cant reduction in the number of antihypertensives after

able to stop their medications while maintaining hyper-
tension control.8 After 5 years, the number of patients 
using >3 cardiovascular drugs fell from 61.2% in the 
baseline to 20.4%.22 In the study by Mingrone et al,10 
antihypertensive therapy was reduced or discontinued 
in 80% of the patients undergoing gastric bypass. Oth-
er trials also documented improvement of hypertension 
after bariatric surgery.23,24
Our trial confirms the results from the observational 
studies with better control of residual confounding be-
cause of the randomized design. In contrast with the 
GATEWAY trial, in previous randomized trials, hyper-
tension improvement and remission were measured as 
secondary end points. In addition, hypertension man-
agement and decision to reduce or discontinue anti-
hypertensive medications were not standardized in all 
studies. Finally, the GATEWAY trial included a broader 
population of patients with obesity and hypertension, 
the majority of whom did not have diabetes mellitus. 
Therefore, our trial provides novel findings and comple-
ments the results from the available randomized evi-
dence.
Although hypertension improvement after bariatric 
surgery could be attributable to hemodynamic chang-
es and decreased intra-abdominal pressure associated 
with weight loss, it is likely that several factors play an 
important role.25,26 Insulin resistance is associated with 
renal sodium reabsorption and increased sympathetic 
tone.27Another factor that may influence hypertension 
control is inflammation, which can modulate arterial 
stiffness.28 Small mechanistic studies suggest that this 
modulation is attributable to a reduction in perivascu-
lar adipocyte inflammation. In lean healthy subjects, the 
perivascular adipose tissue exerts an anticontratile effect 
on adjacent small arteries, which is lost in patients with 
obesity probably because of inflammation.29 Thus, by 
reversing inflammation, bariatric surgery can contribute 
to the restoration of normal anticontratile activity. We

demonstrated both a significant reduction in homeo-
stasis model assessment of insulin resistance index and 
high-sensitivity CRP levels in the gastric bypass group 
when compared with controls. Reduction of such fac-
tors is not immediate after surgery. In our trial, hyperten-
sion improvement occurred early after surgery and was 
maintained for ≤12 months (which is consistent with 
previous studies) (Figure 4).30 Thus, the effects could 
also be attributable to additional mechanisms.31 Some 
evidence has shown that gut hormones may be involved 
in sodium and water handling of the kidney.31 In this 
sense, glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, whose 
effects are exaggerated within days after surgery, may 
act as mediators between the gut and the kidney (en-
terorenal axis concept), influencing electrolyte transport 
in the renal tubular cells as well as causing diuresis.32
Our study has limitations that merit consideration. 
These limitations include the relatively short duration of 
follow-up (12 months), being a single-center trial, and 
the open-label nature of the study (which increased the

risk of bias because doctors could have preferentially 
moderated therapy for subjects they knew had under-
gone gastric bypass). We attempted to minimize the 
potential systematic errors associated with the lack of 
masking of investigators by training all the personnel in-
volved in the study and guaranteeing that they strictly 
follow the trial protocol. A single surgeon with long-term 
expertise in bariatric surgery performed all the surger-
ies. Thus, one may question the external validity of our 
findings, especially to sites with less experience in these 
procedures. Because of the study’s academic nature 
(investigator-initiated) and the consequent limited fund-
ing, in our trial, compliance with study medications was 
based on patient self-report. Therefore, the risk of veri-
fication bias in our primary end point represents a major 
limitation of our trial. At 12 months, information on the 
primary end point was not available for 4 out of 100 
patients. Nevertheless, our findings for the primary end 
point were robust to all sensitivity analyses assumptions. 
We excluded patients with systolic blood pressure ≥180 
mm 
Hg and diastolic blood pressure ≥120  
Hg as well as 
elderly patients. Whether our results can be extrapolated 
to these populations remains to be determined. Finally, 
we are not able to generalize from a study cohort con-
taining patients with class I obesity (BMI 30–34.9) to the 
overwhelming number of individuals who undergo bar-
iatric surgery, those with class II and III obesity (BMI >35).
In conclusion, bariatric surgery represents an effec-
tive strategy for reducing antihypertensive drugs at 12 
months in patients with obesity and hypertension while 
maintaining controlled blood pressure levels. The du-
rability of our findings remains uncertain, but further 
4-year follow-up of patients should allow assessment of 
the long-term effects of bariatric surgery in the studied 
population. Given the morbidity of surgery, our results 
do not imply that all patients with obesity and hyperten-
sion with similar characteristics to those included in our 
trial should be submitted to bariatric surgery. However, 
multiple barriers exist to managing hypertension in obe-
sity, including nonadherence to long-term multiple an-
tihypertensive drugs. Thus, gastric bypass represents 1 
extra option to help achieve blood pressure control with 
the added benefit of improving metabolic and inflam-
matory profile. Taken together, such effects have the po-
tential to reduce major cardiovascular events, although 
further trials are needed to confirm these benefits.
