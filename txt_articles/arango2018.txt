Available treatment methods have shown little effect on the burden associated with mental health disorders. We 
review promising universal, selective, and indicated preventive mental health strategies that might reduce the 
incidence of mental health disorders, or shift expected trajectories to less debilitating outcomes. Some of these 
interventions also seem to be cost-effective. In the transition to mental illness, the cumulative lifetime effect of 
multiple small effect size risk factors progressively increases vulnerability to mental health disorders. This process 
might inform different levels and stages of tailored interventions to lessen risk, or increase protective factors and 
resilience, especially during sensitive developmental periods. Gaps between knowledge, policy, and practice need to 
be bridged. Future steps should emphasise mental health promotion, and improvement of early detection and 
interventions in clinical settings, schools, and the community, with essential support from society and policy makers.
Introduction
Although interest in early detection to prevent 
progression to severe mental health disorders such as 
schizophrenia and recurrent major depression is 
increasing, knowledge of risk factors and developmental 
trajectories has not yet been widely applied to clinical 
practice and public health.1 Psychiatry has traditionally 
been based on treatment and prevention of progression 
and disability in individuals with established illness 
(ie, tertiary prevention). Although many medical 
specialties have joined forces with public education and 
health associations to reduce risk factors for diseases 
such as myocardial infarction,2 preventive initiatives for 
mental health have received far less attention. Scientific 
evidence gathered from other areas of medicine, along 
with increasing knowledge of developmental risk factors 
preceding psychiatric illness, and preliminary findings 
supporting preventive inter-ventions, indicate that our 
field could move toward the more ambitious goals of 
universal prevention of vulnerability, selective prevention 
in high-risk subgroups, and indicated prevention of full 
or more severe expression of illness in individuals 
already showing early manifestations.3 The reality is that 
less than 5% of mental health research funding goes on 
prevention research, even in countries that invest in 
prevention.4
In this Review, we will first summarise the various 
possibilities for mental health prevention throughout 
development, and the evidence supporting them. We 
will then review the potential limitations associated with 
these approaches, and potential ways to overcome them.
Prevention in mental health
Preventive interventions 
Prevention in mental health aims to reduce the incidence, 
prevalence, and recurrence of mental health disorders and 
their associated disability. Preventive interventions are 
based on modifying risk exposure and strengthening 
the coping mechanisms of the individual.5 Effective 
interventions require the identification of causal risk 
factors6 and can target both generic risk factors, which 
are likely to be shared by different disorders, and 
disease-specific factors. Most preventive programmes will 
involve a combination of strategies for reducing exposure 
to risk factors, enhancing protective factors, and targeting 
putative mediating causal mechanisms, such as cognitive 
schemas or neurotransmitter imbalances. Primary 
preventive interventions in mental health target risk 
factors and promote mental health in individuals without a 
clinically diagnosable mental disorder. Such interventions 
could target a whole population regardless of individual 
risk (universal prevention), a subpopulation known to be 
at increased risk for mental disorders (selective 
prevention), or individuals already showing subthreshold 
clinical manifestations (indicated prevention).5 Table 1 
provides an overview of the different kinds of preventive 
interventions in mental health with examples of each. 
This Review will focus mostly on primary preventive 
interventions.

Review
risk factor.7 The cumulative effect of multiple common 
alleles with small effects, or the relatively high impact 
of rare pathogenic variants, in combination with 
environmental risk factors, increases the risk of 
developing mental disorders; similarly, although some 
rare environmental risk factors might have large effect 
sizes, most are characterised by small effect sizes and 
seem to increase susceptibility, but are not sufficient to 
explain the occurrence of a disorder.8 They include, but 
are not limited to, prenatal environment (eg, poor 
nutrition, exposure to drugs or toxins, and maternal 
infections or stress), birth complications, preterm 
delivery, brain trauma, social risks (eg, socioeconomic 
disadvantage and poverty, urbanicity, immigration, and 
social isolation), trauma (eg, parental neglect, physical, 
emotional, and sexual abuse, and bullying), insufficient 
stimulation, general adversity and stressful life events, 
and drug abuse (figure).23,25,27,35 Many risk factors are 
interrelated, and tend to cluster and have synergistic 
effects. For example, immigration often co-occurs with 
urbanicity and social disadvantage,28 whereas children 
who have been exposed to violence are at higher risk of 
repeated victimisation.63 People with mental health 
disorders or disabilities, and individuals who have 
already been exposed to risk factors, might be less 
capable of defending themselves than those without 
these factors and seem to be targeted by bullies and 
abusers more frequently.64 Therefore, once an individual 
becomes vulnerable, they are more likely to experience 
further risk factors, leading to a vicious cycle. This so-
called facilitation effect is supported by epigenetic 
changes found in the serotonin transporter and gluco-
corticoid receptor genes, and subsequent neuroendocrine 
alterations and changes in brain structure and function, 
in victims of childhood trauma.19 Neurobiological 
changes can lead to maladaptive responses to stress, 
thus increasing vulnerability to stress-related diseases, 
and feeding lifetime revictimisation.19
Identification of specific risk and protective factors for 
mental health disorders is challenging because of 
person–environment 
interactions 
and 
correlations. 
Individuals are not passive recipients of events and 
process their experiences according to their personal 
history and social environment, thus influencing their 
ability to adapt to events, and modifying how they interact 
with the environment to shape and select their future 
experiences.65 Interaction with the environment is also 
subject to genetic influence; genetic factors could 
affect the sensitivity of the individual to particular 
environmental risks and contexts (ie, gene–environment 
interactions)8,66 and modulate exposure to certain risk and 
protective factors (ie, gene–environment correlations).67 
Furthermore, exposure to the environment and life 
events, as well as interventions (both pharmacological 
and psychosocial), can induce biological changes at 
different levels (eg, epigenetics, neurotransmitters, and 
brain connectivity), thus modifying the ability to adapt to 
further stressors. These processes complicate the 
situation, but also afford an opportunity for different 
levels of intervention (eg, biological, psychological, 
family-related, or societal), at different developmental 
stages to lessen risk or increase protective factors.

Review
Opportunities for prevention during development
The cumulative effect of risk and absence of protective 
factors during development can lead to a transition 
from health to mental illness.68 Even if early risk factors 
(eg, genetic risk or early environmental factors such as 
severe deprivation) are present, without additional so-
called hits, a disorder ultimately might not develop. The 
presence of multiple hits is especially important in the 
development of disorders such as schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder,69 and offers a unique opportunity for 
targeted prevention in high-risk individuals by reducing 
exposure to further risk factors and enhancing protective 
factors.35 Among possible additional risk factors, bullying 
victimisation has been strongly associated with short-
term and long-term vulnerability to mental illness.25 
Ceasing exposure to bullying and maltreatment during 
childhood has been shown to reduce the incidence of 
psychotic experiences after 12 months.70 Effective 
strategies to reduce bullying, such as school-based anti-
bullying programmes, have also proved effective in 
reducing 
subsequent 
aggression 
or 
internalising 
problems in adolescents.48 Similarly, strategies such as 
providing comprehensive educational and family 
support to economically disadvantaged children, could 
be effective in preventing other risk factors such as child 
abuse; one study38 reported a 52% reduction in the 
incidence of maltreatment in participants compared 
with children not participating in the school-based 
intervention.
Even when there is a first hit or further hits, the effect 
could be lessened by enhancing protective factors such 
as family and social support, and promoting resilience.71 
Resilience is a multidimensional construct that can be 
conceptualised as the ability to adapt well after exper-
iencing adversity, trauma, or other stressors.71 Many 
effective interventions have been developed to promote 
resilience, especially in children and adolescents.47 Their 
core elements include enhancing social and emotional 
competence skills, and promoting self-efficacy, adapta-
bility, and social connectedness in young people, as well 
as fostering positive parenting, and facilitating family 
communication and problem solving.47 For instance, in 
children exposed to risk factors such as low birthweight 
or bullying, a positive family environment increases 
resilience to these risk factors.72,73 Although prevention of 
bullying primarily involves addressing factors in the 
community and schools that foster bullying behaviour, 
family interventions and other strategies to promote 
individual resilience could be helpful in improving 
outcomes in individuals who have already been 
victimised.74
From a developmental psychopathological perspective, 
mental disorders appear to be the result of a dynamic 
process of repeated environmental maladaptation, leading 
to progressive deviation from normative development. 
Multiple pathways can lead to similar outcomes, whereas 
the same deviant developmental pathway can lead to 
different psychopathological outcomes. Although change 
can be constrained to some extent by previous adaptation, 
especially during sensitive developmental periods, the 
pluripotentiality of early trajectories of vulnerability 
suggests that change is possible at many points during 
development.75 This developmental psychopathology 
model is compatible with a staging model similar to 
models developed in other areas of medicine, which 
suggests that severe mental disorders develop from at-risk 
preclinical states, pass through undifferentiated general 
symptoms, and lead to increasing clinical specificity and 
functional decline.76 
Both models have an optimistic outlook for a preventive 
approach, suggesting it would be possible to intervene in 
the developmental process of any mental condition, or 
shift the psychopathological expression towards less 
debilitating disorders, by intervening in people with 
risk factors, or people who are already showing 
subtle abnormal development.77 Early risk markers of 
developmental deviance that can precede severe disorders 
in adulthood include subtle language and motor delays, 
extreme temperament traits, irritability, subthreshold 
hyperactivity and conduct problems, low cognitive 
performance, decline in intelligence quotient, and social 
difficulties in childhood.32–34 These markers could 
help 
characterise 
subpopulations 
with 
increased 
developmental vulnerability to guide targeted intensive 
interventions.
It could be feasible to change trajectories towards a less 
severe mental disorder, or a less severe form of a given 
disorder. Psychosocial interventions in people at clinical 
high risk for psychosis, such as cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT), could lead to a reduction in transition 
rates to psychosis, or a delay in the onset and amelioration 
of debilitating symptoms.78 Although based on a single 
study54 that warrants replication, preliminary evidence 
suggests that an early comprehensive behavioural 
intervention in toddlers diagnosed with autism spectrum 
disorder could improve function 
ality and diminish core 
symptoms of the disorder. Another example is attention-
deficit hyper 
activity dis 
order. Treat 
ment with stimulants 
in childhood might improve or stabilise social 
functioning and academic performance in patients with 
the disorder; subsequently, the rate of secondary drug 
abuse, conduct disorders, and social problems can 
decrease in adolescence and adulthood, stopping a 
potential down 
ward spiral.57 Similarly, reducing the 
duration of anxiety or depressive episodes in young 
people might prevent the development of more severe 
mental health disorders during adulthood.79
During a lifespan, there are sensitive periods when 
risk and protective factors could have greater effects and 
long-lasting consequences.19,80 These periods include the 
prenatal period, childhood, and adolescence through 
early adulthood (figure). These intervals of vulnerability 
largely overlap with periods of major developmental 
brain changes, such as maturation of several receptors, 
 www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 5   July 2018 
595
Review
myelination, pruning, and development of hub regions.80 
These periods are also crucial for the development of 
secure attachment; basic schemas related to self, others, 
and the world; self-esteem and self-integrity; and the 
adult personality, and they overlap with the peak 
incidence of major mental disorders.81 Prevention 
focusing on these periods might be more effective and 
have long-lasting benefits.
The prenatal environment can shape gene expression 
related to fetal brain development, and thus affect the 
risk of developing mental health disorders.82 Therefore, 
providing appropriate screening and care for factors such 
as maternal nutrition and substance abuse (including 
smoking) and parental mental health disorders and 
stress during this period, could contribute considerably 
to global prevention of mental health disorders in 
children.15,16 In the postnatal period and early childhood, 
exposure to stressors (such as child abuse, neglect, or 
malnutrition) might interfere with the development of 
brain regions crucial for the regulation of emotion, 
leading to poor mental and physical health.19 Thus, 
reducing the frequency of child abuse and improving 
early family and social environments could decrease the 
occurrence of lifetime mental health disorders.24 During 
adolescence, strategies to prevent substance abuse and 
other risky behaviours, and to promote healthy lifestyles 
and positive coping mechanisms, could be especially 
useful.47,51
Despite the numerous opportunities for prevention in 
mental health, some specific factors could hamper the 
advancement of prevention in psychiatry, and should be 
considered when designing and implementing inter-
ventions (panel 1).  
Evidence supporting primary prevention in 
psychiatry
Universal preventive interventions
Universal prevention of mental health disorders 
addresses generic risk and protective factors in the 
general population. Such interventions are likely to 
affect the global probability of developing psychiatric 
and other disorders in a non-specific fashion. A holistic 
approach to health, integrating psychosocial and physical 
aspects of wellbeing, might be especially valuable in this 
regard. Results from a meta-analysis89 of 67 cluster trials 
reported that the WHO Health Promoting School 
framework, a holistic approach to promoting mental 
health in schools, had significant positive effects on 
physical activity, physical fitness, bodyweight, fruit and 
vegetable intake, tobacco use, and bullying. Despite the 
small effect sizes, the investigators suggested that these 
interventions could have public health benefits at the 
population level. Data also suggest that promotion of 
healthy lifestyles, including appropriate nutrition and 
regular exercise, could have positive effects on cognitive 
development, scholastic achievement, and mental health 
vulnerability.5,50 Something as simple as eating dinner as 
a family could serve as a venue for parents to promote 
coping strategies that offset the impact of stressful 
environmental factors, such as cyberbullying.46
Key targets for universal prevention include the prenatal 
and perinatal periods. Dietary phosphatidylcholine 
supplementation during the second and third trimesters 
could prevent cerebral inhibition deficits associated 
with schizophrenia and attention-deficit disorder.42 
Furthermore, 
vitamin 
D 
supplementation 
during 
pregnancy could reduce the frequency of low birthweight 
and preterm delivery,85 which have been associated with 
attention deficits and an increased risk of developing 
childhood behavioural and emotional disorders.13,90 
Similarly, preliminary data suggest that vitamin D 
supplementation during the first year of life could reduce 
the incidence of schizophrenia in men.91 Other strategies 
to 
improve 
maternal 
nutrition 
(fortification 
or 
supplementation) have been associated with reduced 
obstetric complications and improved behavioural out-
comes in offspring.92 Interventions to promote effective 
parenting in expectant or new parents can also have 
positive effects on the cognitive, social, and motor 
development, and mental health of the child.93 
Schools have a central, universal preventive role during 
childhood and adolescence. Many school-based anti-
bullying programmes have been shown to be effective, 
reducing bullying by an average of about 20% according 
to meta-anaylsis,49 and might also reduce related mental 
health symptoms.48 Universal school-based programmes 
could also be effective in improving social and emotional 
skills, attitudes, behaviour, and academic performance, 
as suggested by the results of a meta-analysis94 assessing 
213 programmes involving more than 270 000 students 
from age 5 years to 18 years. School-based programmes 
with self-regulation change techniques, can also improve 
self-esteem and internalising behaviour in adolescents, 
with small effect sizes (about 0·20).95
Results from meta-analyses and systematic reviews 
have shown that some psychosocial universal preventive 
inter 
ventions are effective for anxiety and depression,96,97 
eating disorders,98 and substance use disorders in young 
people.51 Restriction of access to lethal means and school-
based awareness programmes have been found to reduce 
suicidality.99 Preliminary evidence suggests that additional 
supplementation strategies (eg, N-acetylcysteine, sulpho- 
raphane, and probiotics) constitute promising approaches 
for universal prevention in mental health.86
Selective preventive interventions
Children of parents with mental illness or substance use 
disorders represent one of the populations at highest 
risk for psychiatric problems.9 In children with 
high familial risk for psychosis, about 10% will 
develop psychosis, and 50% non-psychotic problems.9,32 
Similarly, children of parents with depression have a 
three times higher risk of developing anxiety disorders, 
major 
depression, 
and 
substance 
dependence.10

Review
Panel 1: Factors that hamper the advancement of prevention in psychiatry
Limitations of using diagnoses of specific mental disorders 
as outcome measures of preventive interventions
Risk or protective factors do not seem to be specific for 
particular mental disorders. Whether at the level of aetiology7 or 
pathophysiology,83 these factors seem to increase or decrease 
vulnerability to many mental disorders. Even in genetic 
conditions, such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, pleiotropy is 
remarkable, and the outcome is highly variable in terms of 
functionality, intellectual disability, and psychiatric diagnosis, 
which is true for almost all copy number variations associated 
with psychiatric conditions.11 Therefore, fixed pathways do not 
seem to be leading to each disorder as defined in DSM or ICD.75,77 
Although some interventions could be more specific (eg, some 
indicated interventions), public health interventions, whether 
population-wide or in a high-risk subgroup, might have low 
specificity and reduce incidence or improve outcomes across 
disorders. Quantification of the effectiveness of such 
interventions should, therefore, be reflected by global measures 
of disorders and include other outcomes (eg, education, 
wellbeing, and use of social and legal services). For mental 
illness, in many instances, a two-decade delay from birth to 
emergence of a specific disorder is an additional problem.
Barriers to identification and care in those at risk
Without reliable biomarkers for mental disorders, prediction of 
future illness in individuals and reliable identification of 
subpopulations at risk for specific disorders is very difficult. The 
difficulties involved in identifying those individuals at high risk 
are exacerbated by the fact that families most in need of 
intervention (eg, families who are disadvantaged) might have 
the least access to care. Further research is needed on the early 
stages of mental disorders, with the aim of identifying potential 
psychological, biological, and social risk markers.
Methodological and ethical challenges of preventive 
interventions
Preventive strategies are associated with some intrinsic 
difficulties, including the high number of potentially 
false-positive treatments and the high costs associated with 
interventions in larger populations. Considering the potential 
for ineffective, or even iatrogenic interventions, doing rigorous 
research on preventive interventions is crucial. Since a high 
proportion of the population, not necessarily at risk, could be 
exposed to these kinds of interventions, safety should guide the 
implementation of primary universal interventions. Strategies 
to promote mental wellbeing, healthy eating and physical 
activity, reduce bullying and other forms of child abuse, and 
improve workplace conditions are associated with very low risks 
and could be prioritised. Although supplementation strategies 
during pregnancy or the neonatal period could become useful 
preventive strategies, they should be further studied 
considering their potential risks. Nevertheless, the association 
of reduced vitamin D during pregnancy and the neonatal period 
with neurodevelopmental disorders,84 preliminary data 
suggesting a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on 
birth outcomes in offspring and low risk of side-effects,85 
suggests that supplementation strategies could be carefully 
implemented, at least in high-risk subpopulations (ie, pregnant 
women or neonates with vitamin D concentrations in the 
lowest percentiles). Low sensitivity for the identification of 
individuals with subthreshold symptoms could limit indicated 
preventive interventions; it has been estimated that well 
established clinical high-risk services might miss 95% of people 
who will develop a psychotic disorder.86
Implementing early-stage detection and intervention strategies 
in a clinical context for indicated and selective prevention has 
clear ethical implications. It seems feasible (and crucially 
important) to identify people at high-risk for whom health 
systems are equipped to provide proper care (eg, young people 
showing mild symptoms or behaviours suggestive of clinical 
high-risk, and healthy individuals with known genetic risk). 
Disclosure in these instances could be beneficial for both patient 
and family by providing understanding, perspective, and advice 
for reducing risk, promoting resilience, and orienting future 
actions in case of progression; however, this process could also 
be stressful and raise concerns regarding stigma. Disclosure 
should be done with great caution so as not to decrease self-
esteem and hopes or aims for the future. Rather, interventions 
in at-risk individuals should be framed as encouragement for a 
better future. Safety should guide clinical decision making in 
those individuals identified as being at risk, and lower-risk 
interventions should be prioritised, especially in young people.
Long-term benefits do not seem to motivate health 
authorities or political decisions
Lack of awareness of the substantial economic savings from 
preventive interventions for mental disorders, the need for an 
initial investment in training and investment of time by 
professionals (often with no short-term return), and stigma, 
partly explain the lower interest in mental health prevention 
than in other areas of medicine. It might take more time to 
realise the benefits of investing in prevention for mental health 
than in other areas of medicine (eg, oncology or cardiovascular 
disease), which is problematic when politicians need to 
prioritise their health actions on the basis of what can be 
communicated to future voters in 4–5-year election cycles. 
A focus on prevention and public health requires a long-term 
view that is sometimes not possible in politics because of 
politicians’ short terms in office, and subsequent shifts in 
priorities for health and education when a different party comes 
to power (potentially without regard for the benefits of 
previous approaches). National and international funding 
agencies could play an essential part in providing the required 
long-term support to assess and implement preventive 
interventions appropriately. Additionally, prevention and early 
detection of mental disorders might be perceived as more 
complex than in other areas of medicine because of the false

Review
Genetic vulnerability aside, several studies100,101 have 
found an association between childhood risk and 
parental mental health status, suggesting that successful 
management of parental psychopathology could improve 
outcomes in their children. Outcomes of a meta-
analysis53 have indicated that preventive interventions 
targeting parents with mental illness could reduce the 
risk of mental disorders in their children by 40%.
Other at-risk populations include children with genetic 
disorders associated with an increased risk for early 
developmental deficits and psychiatric symptoms. In 
these at-risk populations, universal school-based or 
community-based preventive interventions against 
bullying and abuse might be especially helpful in 
preventing mental disorders, by reducing exposure to 
these frequent risk factors. Selective preventive 
interventions in at-risk populations should target social 
stress and emotional problems, promote resilience, and 
facilitate early identification and access to services in 
individuals already in need of care.35 Compensatory 
approaches to social and cognitive prob-lems could 
provide additional benefits to interventions aimed at 
improving resilience in at-risk populations.62
Evidence also supports the efficacy of some psychosocial 
selective interventions to prevent externalising disorders 
in children reared in disadvantaged environments102 or 
exposed to violence within the family context,103 post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and 
adolescents exposed to traumatic events,104 eating 
disorders in young people belonging to high-risk groups 
(eg, female athletes or adolescents with body image 
issues),98 post-partum depression,105 and depression or 
anxiety disorders in young children of patients with 
depressive disorders106 and other high-risk populations.96,107 
Additionally 
some 
pharmacotherapy 
strategies 
(eg, hydrocortisone) have been shown to be effective for 
the prevention of PTSD.108 Most effective interventions 
had small to medium effect sizes relative to control 
conditions.
Indicated preventive interventions
Indicated 
preventive 
interventions 
are 
used 
for 
individuals showing subthreshold manifestations of 
mental health disorders. Interventions in these 
subgroups might be more cost-effective, and therefore 
efficient, because they minimise the number of 
(Panel 1 continued from previous page)
perception that mental disorders are not associated with 
mortality, with resources more easily directed toward health
conditions that are considered fatal (especially in the short 
term). To overcome these difficulties, politicians and society 
should become aware of the high morbidity and mortality 
associated with mental disorders,87 and the economic return on 
investment in mental health research, which is similar to 
research in cardiovascular disease.88
Some preventive interventions could be delivered by sectors 
other than health care. Support and funding from other 
institutions, including education authorities, might be required 
for improving health literacy and developing interventions 
targeting children and adolescents, especially in schools. An 
economic argument can be made to employers to motivate 
them to intervene proactively to reduce stress and improve 
working environments in their companies. Therefore, research 
on potential short-term benefits of interventions needs to look 
beyond impacts on the health system (eg, for school-related 
outcomes such as academic achievement, reduced truancy, 
and teacher stress, or potential employer benefits of improved 
worker mental health) to involve these additional sectors, 
which also opens up opportunities for additional sources of 
funding and support.
Challenge of rebalancing investment in prevention and 
treatment of mental disorders
Although the costs associated with some preventive 
interventions are not necessarily high, choices and trade-offs are 
required between investment in prevention and investment in 
treatment of existing conditions. Mid-term to long-term 
cost-effectiveness arguments should be made. Multisectorial 
investment also becomes feasible if economic benefits to other 
sectors (eg, education) can also be identified.
Stigma
General stigmatisation of mental illness implies an 
underestimation of the need for prevention in psychiatry on 
the part of the general population. The risk of a heart attack 
seems plausible to most of us, but many will not believe they 
need to be protected against suicide or self-harm. Personal and 
community stigma, and lack of insight, could also hinder 
indicated prevention in people with early manifestations of 
mental illness, more than for other medical conditions, 
by delaying help-seeking behaviour as a result of anticipated 
discrimination.30 Evidence-based interventions to tackle stigma 
and improve access to care in individuals already experiencing 
mental distress should be prioritised.
Additional factors
Additional factors include poor insurance coverage in some 
countries, the need for multilevel and multisectorial 
intervention when services are usually compartmentalised, 
low perception of risk when early manifestations of mental 
illness are subtle (especially in children and adolescents), 
high variability of behavioural manifestations during infancy 
and adolescence, and paucity of validated screening tools and 
treatment for conditions first evident in infants. These factors 
should be considered when designing preventive interventions.

individuals who need to be exposed to the intervention 
and target individuals who might already be in need of 
care. Results of meta-analyses58,97,98 suggest that indicated 
interventions could have greater effect sizes than 
universal ones (eg, programmes for eating disorders or 
depression), although this outcome is not consistent 
across studies; several meta-analyses96 report no 
significant differences or greater effect sizes for universal 
interventions. 
Examples 
of 
effective 
indicated 
interventions, supported by meta-analyses,55,56 include 
parent management training to prevent externalising 
disorders in children with high antisocial behaviour 
scores, and prevention of depression and anxiety 
disorders in children showing early manifestations of 
internalising disorders. CBT in individ-uals at clinical 
high risk could lead to a reduction in the transition from 
clinical high risk to psychosis.59 CBT-based strategies 
might be effective for preventing chronic PTSD in 
patients showing early acute stress symptoms after 
exposure to a traumatic event60 and eating disorders in 
young people with subthreshold symptoms.98 CBT and 
interpersonal therapy might also be effective for the 
prevention of depression and anxiety in young people 
and adults presenting with subclinical symptoms.58,61
Is it worth investing in mental health 
prevention? 
Despite mounting scientific data supporting the efficacy 
of early intervention and prevention in psychiatry, a gap 
still exists between research evidence and clinical and 
public health practices. Can this be attributed to 
economics? Improving long-term outcomes, and 
reducing long-term adverse consequences of poor 
mental health (eg, secondary disorders, criminality, and 
unemployment), make many early mental health 
interventions cost-effective for society.35,109 This cost-
effectiveness is in light of the high direct and indirect 
costs generated by neuropsychiatric disorders, which are 
responsible for 14% of the global burden of disease 
(disability-adjusted 
life 
years) 
worldwide.110 
The 
European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, 
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, and the WHO Regional Office for Europe 
have compiled data showing that influencing risk 
behaviours for chronic non-communicable diseases, 
including mental health disorders, is an efficient use of 
government money, and that government policies can 
have a major impact on risk behaviours for mental 
health disorders.111
In the UK for every US$1 spent on mental health 
promotion and prevention, the calculated total societal 
returns on investment over 10 years (including impacts 
on health and other sectors, such as education and the 
criminal justice system) were $83·73 for whole-school 
conduct disorder prevention and $10·27 for early 
detection services in people with prodromal symptoms 
of psychosis.109 An estimate of the benefits of bullying 
prevention suggested a conservative return of between 
$10·67 and $16·79 per dollar invested by age 21 years, 
due to higher earnings and better educational outcomes,

factors, such as folic acid fortification of enriched cereal 
or grain products for the prevention of neural tube 
defects,117 and universal screening in pregnancy for 
subclinical hypothyroidism,118 could also be cost effective. 
For conditions such as maternal depression and suicidal 
behaviour, improving the ability of professionals to 
detect and intervene in at-risk groups and at early stages 
could be beneficial to individuals, relatives, and 
society.119,120 The promotion of health literacy in routine 
educational settings could also be cost-effective for a 
wide range of health, educational, and social outcomes.121 
Table 2 provides a summary of the cost-effectiveness 
analysis of key examples of primary preventive 
interventions in psychiatry.
Savings made due to the prevention of mental health 
disorders could be greater than for other medical 
conditions. Debilitating mental disorders usually have 
an earlier-onset than many other chronic diseases, 
increasing the number of years that health and social 
welfare services and caregiver support are needed. For 
example, the mean age at onset of diabetes is 
52·5 years,125 and the average age of a first heart attack in 
men in the USA is 65 years,126 whereas 50% of mental 
disorders start before the age of 14 years, and 75% before 
the age of 24 years.81 Therefore, we can assume that the 
direct and indirect savings (eg, higher proportion of 
employment and higher earnings when employed) to 
society from the early and long-lasting reduction of the 
burden of mental illness would be much higher than for 
many other chronic medical conditions. Furthermore, 
considering the bidirectional association between 
mental and physical health, altering risk factors for 
psychiatric disorders could also help to prevent other

prevention and promotion.
• 
Includes social education campaigns about early signs, 
risk, and protective factors, and consequences of mental 
disorders. Claims for societal health investment in 
preventive psychiatry should be based on personal, 
family, health, education, and social benefits of reducing 
mental illness burden, and on long-term and indirect 
economic savings of mental health prevention 
programmes by reducing disability.
3 Move clinical practice toward at-risk-oriented detection and 
intervention.
• 
Need for clearer and more specific definitions of early 
clinical stages incorporating neuroimaging, 
neurocognitive, and biochemical markers into the 
description of cases, which could help monitor possible 
trajectories and detect new therapeutic targets.
• Provide standardised and cost-effective screening 
measures for the accurate detection of at-risk 
populations at early stages of development such as 
patients with perinatal mental illness and 
developmental disorders, individuals at high risk for 
psychosis, and children of parents with severe mental 
illness. In particular, development of screening tools 
with high sensitivity, specificity, and positive 
predictive value for toddlers and preschool children 
is needed.
• 
Procure standardised and cost-effective preventive 
interventions such as caring for pregnant adults and 
adolescents, parental training programmes, 
cognitive-behavioural therapy, and other psychosocial 
interventions (for high-risk subjects).
• 
Promote proper training in standardised and 
cost-effective preventive interventions for professionals. 
Since professionals will detect the risk, they should 
acquire skills for communicating probability, and 
managing related stress in parents and patients facing 
uncertainty. In this regard, any decision making should 
be based on evidence regarding risks and benefits.
4 Provide interventions designed for each developmental 
stage aimed at minimising the impact of risk factors.
5 Promote interventions with a multidisciplinary and 
multilevel (psychological, social, familial, and legal) approach.
• 
Requires improving coordination between different 
institutions.
6 Promote healthy lifestyles including nutrition and exercise.
7 Encourage school-based interventions (targeting children, 
parents, and education professionals) for:
• 
Early detection of deviation from normal psychomotor 
development, language delays, abnormal social 
behaviour, and poor academic performance.
• 
Reduction of bullying.
• 
Protection and promotion of resilience to peer 
victimisation and abuse in the vulnerable, and assistance 
for victims, abusers, and bystanders.
• 
Prevention of health risk behaviours, including 
substance abuse and suicidality, and related burden.
• 
Promotion of mental and physical health.

medical conditions in adulthood. For example, bullying 
victimisation has been associated with an increased risk 
of inflammatory disorders.25 Interventions to prevent 
bullying are likely to have an effect on the development 
of both psychiatric and medical disorders, as well as 
non-medical outcomes (eg, educational attainment and 
societal benefits).
In light of this evidence, two initiatives in the USA127 
and Europe128 have included prevention among the top 
priorities for mental health research. The US group 
emphasises that it is feasible to achieve these priorities 
in the next 10 years, but only if funding begins 
immediately.127
The role of mental health professionals in 
mental health prevention
Some of the general risk factors for mental disorders, 
such as social exclusion or economic inequality, 
cannot be directly addressed by psychiatrists. Universal 
interventions in the general population require a public 
mental health approach, and will probably need to be 
delivered by professionals from other medical specialties, 
such as obstetricians and general practitioners, or other 
sectors such as education. We believe that it is the duty 
of mental health professionals to increase awareness 
among the general public, politicians, and policy makers 
of the importance of mental health prevention and 
promotion, and of the evidence supporting cost-effective 
interventions. Mental health professionals could also 
incorporate an at-risk oriented focus into clinical practice 
by improving definitions for early clinical stages, 
enhancing screening instruments, developing targeted 
interventions, and promoting training in prevention for 
all mental health professionals. The role of clinicians 
could be especially important for selective and indicated 
interventions, by providing care to individuals already at 
Search strategy and selection criteria
We identified references for this Review through PubMed searches for articles and 
previous reviews published from inception to December, 2016, using the key terms 
“prevention”, “high-risk”, “risk factors”, “promotion”, “resilience”, “development”, 
“staging”, and “early intervention” in combination with the terms “psychiatry”, “mental 
health”, and “psychopathology”. Articles identified by these searches that related to the 
main topics covered in the manuscript, and relevant references cited in those articles, 
were selectively reviewed. We did an additional systematic PubMed search from inception 
to Nov 6, 2017, to identify meta-analyses assessing primary preventive interventions for 
specific mental conditions (ie, mood disorders [depression, bipolar disorder], anxiety 
disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, externalising disorders [disruptive behaviour 
disorders (ie, conduct disorders, oppositional-defiant disorder), attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder], eating disorders, psychotic disorders, autism spectrum disorders, 
and suicidal behaviour; see appendix for additional details). We systematically reviewed 
these references and included the most recent or comprehensive meta-analyses 
supporting universal, selective, or indicated preventive interventions for each disorder in 
the manuscript. We did complementary searches in Google Scholar and PubMed to 
identify examples of cost-effectiveness studies on preventive interventions in psychiatry.
risk in whom periodic specialised monitoring of 
subsequent mental health problems might be especially 
useful. Strengthening the coordination between child 
and adolescent and adult psychiatric services targeting 
the same areas could be valuable in the management of 
children of patients with major mental disorders. 
Furthermore, improved coordination could assist with 
the transition through services for other high-risk 
populations, 
which 
could 
be 
especially 
useful 
considering the often large treatment gap during the 
transition from child and adolescent services to adult 
services.129 Improving access to care for people already in 
need could provide an excellent secondary and tertiary 
preventive strategy by reducing the duration of untreated 
illness and its negative consequences. Considering the 
high comorbidity and bidirectional association of mental 
disorders with somatic conditions, coordination with 
primary care is essential. Panel 2 summarises key areas 
of mental disorder prevention that we suggest should be 
prioritised. 
Conclusions
Increasing 
evidence 
suggests 
that 
preventive 
interventions in psychiatry that are feasible, safe, and 
cost-effective could translate into a broader focus on 
prevention in our field. Universal, indicated, and selective 
prevention strategies might be effective in improving 
psychological wellbeing or preventing mental disorders 
throughout development, although further evidence is 
required. There is a precedent for implementing safe 
universal interventions, despite incomplete evidence, 
from other areas of medicine for which data showing 
benefits were acquired only after universal adoption 
(eg, folic acid supplementation, fluoride treatment, and 
measles vaccination). These cases set an example for 
implementing safe interventions for mental disorders 
that have preliminary data showing efficacy, especially 
considering the potential two decade gap between 
implementation of early preventive strategies and 
emergence of mental disorders.
Investigations are needed of the early stages of mental 
disorders integrating different dimensions (genetic, 
transcriptomic, neurobiological, psychological, and 
socio-economic), including their complex interactions 
throughout early developmental periods. Evidence 
should be gathered on the optimisation of intervention 
strategies based on developmental timing, while 
factoring in potential short-term and long-term benefits 
beyond mental health outcomes (ie, educational, 
functional, and societal). Because prioritisation of these 
interventions is needed, we propose that implementation 
in the area of mental health could start in children with 
risk factors for developing a mental disorder (eg, 
offspring of parents with major mental disorders or 
individuals with genetic risk factors) or children 
showing non-specific symptomatic manifestations of 
the early stages of mental disorders or indicators of

early developmental deviation. To achieve these goals, 
the support of society and public policy makers is 
essential. Disseminating the potential societal benefits 
of evidence-based findings could increase community 
awareness, and stimulate inclusion of cost-effective 
prevention pro 
grammes for mental disorders in political 
agendas.
