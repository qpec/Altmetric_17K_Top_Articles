BACKGROUND: Recent failures of drugs that raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials have led to 
increased interest in alternative indices of HDL quality, such as cholesterol efflux 
capacity, and HDL quantity, such as HDL particle number. However, no studies 
have directly compared these metrics in a contemporary population that includes 
potent statin therapy and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
METHODS: HDL cholesterol levels, apolipoprotein A-I, cholesterol efflux capacity, 
and HDL particle number were assessed at baseline and 12 months in a nested 
case-control study of the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in 
Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a randomized primary 
prevention trial that compared rosuvastatin treatment to placebo in individuals with 
normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but increased C-reactive protein levels. 
In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, 
unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were 
compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression 
models adjusting for risk factors evaluated associations between HDL-related 
biomarkers and incident CVD.
RESULTS: Cholesterol efflux capacity was moderately correlated with HDL 
cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and HDL particle number (Spearman r= 0.39, 0.48, 
and 0.39 respectively; P<0.001). Baseline HDL particle number was inversely 
associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds ratio per SD increment [OR/SD], 
0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; P<0.001), whereas no significant 
association was found for baseline cholesterol efflux capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.72–1.10; P=0.28), HDL cholesterol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; P=0.08), 
or apolipoprotein A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; P=0.08). Twelve months 
of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) did not change cholesterol efflux capacity (average 
percentage change ‒1.5%, 95% CI, ‒13.3 to +10.2; P=0.80), but increased HDL 
cholesterol (+7.7%), apolipoprotein A-I (+4.3%), and HDL particle number (+5.2%). 
On-statin cholesterol efflux capacity was inversely associated with incident CVD 
(OR/SD, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42–0.92; P=0.02), although HDL particle number again 
emerged as the strongest predictor (OR/SD, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33–0.77; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In JUPITER, cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with incident 
CVD in individuals on potent statin therapy but not at baseline. For both baseline 
and on-statin analyses, HDL particle number was the strongest of 4 HDL-related 
biomarkers as an inverse predictor of incident events and biomarker of residual risk.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is a well-inte-
grated biomarker of cardiometabolic health and remains 
a key component of the cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
risk prediction algorithms used to guide therapy.1 How-
ever, HDL cholesterol-raising therapeutics have failed to 
demonstrate efficacy in multiple recent clinical trials.2–4 
These results have called into question both the causal-
ity of the observed relationship between HDL and CVD 
and the hypothesis that modulation of HDL cholesterol 
levels can improve clinical outcomes. At a minimum, it 
has become clear that changes in HDL cholesterol levels 
are an inadequate surrogate biomarker for therapeutic 
efficacy.
The static measurement of HDL cholesterol levels, as 
is performed in current clinical practice, may not ade-
quately capture the anti-atherogenic properties of highly 
heterogeneous HDL particles. Beyond apolipoprotein A-I 
(apoA-I), proteomics analyses have identified >80 dis-
tinct proteins associated with circulating HDL particles.5 
Previous studies have suggested that the number of cir-
culating HDL particles may serve as a better predictor of 
cardiovascular risk than HDL cholesterol levels.6–13 A pu-
tative atheroprotective mechanism of HDL involves the 
reverse cholesterol transport pathway, the process by 
which excess cholesterol is removed from the periphery 
and returned to the liver for biliary excretion.14 Choles-
terol efflux capacity is 1 metric of HDL functionality that 
quantifies the ability for an individual’s HDL to extract 
cholesterol from macrophages, the rate-limiting step of 
reverse cholesterol transport. Efflux capacity was dem-
onstrated to be a better predictor of atherosclerotic 
burden than HDL cholesterol levels in several previous 
studies.15–19 This inverse relationship was extended to 
incident cardiovascular events in some16–18 but not all19 
previous analyses. However, owing to challenges of 
standardizing a cell-based assay across laboratories, it 
is unlikely that assessment of efflux capacity will enter 
into routine clinical use.
Few previous studies have determined the relation-
ships among these various HDL-related biomarkers, and 
none to date have directly compared their associations 
with incident cardiovascular events, particularly in a con-
temporary cohort with low or normal levels of low-densi-
ty lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels that includes ran-
domized treatment with potent statin therapy. Here, we 
examined prospective associations of HDL cholesterol, 
apoA-I, HDL particle number, and cholesterol efflux ca-
pacity in a nested case-control cohort derived from the 
JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Pre-
vention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin).20
METHODS
Study Population
The study population was derived from the JUPITER trial, a pre-
viously reported primary prevention, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial investigating whether rosuvastatin 
20 mg daily would decrease incident CVD in 17 
802 asymp-
tomatic individuals with LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dL and a 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level ≥2.0 mg/L.20 
Exclusion criteria for the JUPITER trial included diabetes mel-
litus, previous or current use of lipid-lowering therapy, or tri-
glycerides >500 mg/dL. In addition to blood samples required 
for the trial protocol assays, 11 
953 (67%) of trial participants 
voluntarily provided samples for additional biomarker pheno-
typing. End points within the JUPITER trial were adjudicated by 
an independent committee blinded to treatment assignment.20 
All participants provided written informed consent as part of 
the JUPITER trial enrollment. Institutional review board approval 
for the present study was obtained from Partners HealthCare 
(Boston, MA).
A nested case-control cohort was derived from individuals 
with available baseline blood samples. The primary analysis 
involved 314 cases who experienced the JUPITER trial primary 
end point (myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable 
angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular 
death); an expanded secondary end point (N=525 cases) was 
prespecified to additionally include death from any cause as 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Moderate correlations between high-density lipo-
protein (HDL)-related biomarkers—HDL cholesterol, 
apolipoprotein A-I, HDL particle number, and choles-
terol efflux capacity—were noted in JUPITER trial 
(Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: 
an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) partici-
pants, reinforcing the complementary information 
provided by each assessment.
• No significant relationship was observed between 
baseline or serial changes in cholesterol efflux 
capacity (a commonly used measure of HDL func-
tionality) and incident cardiovascular events. How-
ever, cholesterol efflux capacity assessed on potent 
statin therapy was inversely associated with incident 
cardiovascular events.
• Among HDL-related biomarkers, HDL particle num-
ber demonstrated the strongest inverse association 
with incident cardiovascular events when assessed 
at both baseline and on potent rosuvastatin therapy.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Cholesterol efflux capacity was a marker of residual 
risk when assessed on statin therapy, consistent 
with a potential role in driving residual risk in a low 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol environment.
• HDL particle number was a stronger predictor of 
cardiovascular disease than other HDL-related bio-
markers and may serve as a biomarker of residual 
risk or response to therapy in the future.
• Whether a therapy designed to enhance cholesterol 
efflux capacity or increase HDL particle number can 
reduce cardiovascular risk remains uncertain.

implemented in previous JUPITER biomarker analyses (Table 
I in the online-only Data Supplement).21–23 Each case definition 
was compared to controls who remained free of events at the 
time of case event and matched in a 1:1 ratio based on age 
(±2 years) and sex.
Laboratory Measurements
Fasting lipids, apolipoproteins, hsCRP, and glucose levels were 
measured in a core laboratory as previously described.20,23,24 
HDL particle number was measured using nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy LipoProfile III by LipoScience, Inc. 
(now LabCorp). Total particle number was calculated to be the 
sum of levels across HDL subclasses, identified based on lipid 
methyl group nuclear magnetic resonance signals as previ-
ously described.12
Cholesterol efflux capacity was quantified in plasma sam-
ples thawed from liquid nitrogen storage using a previously 
validated cell-based ex vivo assay.15 In brief, J7774 mac-
rophage cells were incubated with 3H-radiolabeled choles-
terol. Expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 
transporter was upregulated using cAMP. Diluted apolipopro-
tein B-depleted plasma was then added and liquid scintillation 
counting used to quantify the percentage of radioactive choles-
terol from the cells effluxed into the media. To minimize varia-
tion related to batch effects, paired baseline and 12-month 
samples from cases and matched controls were included on 
the same plate for efflux capacity assessment. In addition, a 
pooled plasma control was used to correct for interassay varia-
tion across assays. In a pilot analysis involving blinded duplicate 
assessments of 20 patient samples divided into 2 aliquots, the 
mean intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 3.7% 
and 4.7%, respectively. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase 
A2 activity levels were measured using an automated enzyme 
assay system.25 HDL-related phenotypes, including cholesterol 
efflux capacity, were measured at both baseline and after 12 
months of therapy in individuals with samples available.
Statistical Analysis
Medians, 25th, and 75th percentiles were calculated for con-
tinuous variables. The significance of variation in cholesterol

efflux capacity across categorical patient characteristics 
was assessed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum 
or Chi-square tests. Spearman coefficients were calculated 
to determine the magnitude of correlation between biomark-
ers. The impact of treatment on HDL-related phenotypes was 
determined by calculating the percentage change from base-
line to 12 months in individuals stratified by treatment group. 
Statistical comparisons with baseline and placebo values were 
determined by 1- and 2-sample t tests, respectively.
Odds ratios were calculated across tertiles as well as per 
standard deviation increment in each biomarker. Conditional 
logistic regression models accounting for the matched study 
design were further adjusted for age, race, randomized 
treatment group, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, 
body mass index, fasting glucose, LDL cholesterol level, log-
transformed triglyceride level, and family history of premature 
coronary artery disease. P-values for trend were obtained by 
including tertile number as a variable in the regression model. 
Models analyzing on-statin biomarkers incorporated on-treat-
ment values for LDL and log-transformed triglycerides. To 
preserve power while maintaining the matched case-control 
design, subgroup analyses were conducted by adding appro-
priate interaction terms to the models. Subgroup-specific linear 
regression parameters and odds ratios were calculated using 
combinations of main effect and interaction terms (online-only 
Data Supplement).
All P-values were 2-tailed, with a value <0.05 used to indi-
cate statistical significance. Analyses were performed using R 
version 3.1 software (The R Project for Statistical Computing).
RESULTS
The study population included 1050 trial partici-
pants—525 controls, 314 cases who experienced the 
primary JUPITER trial end point, and 525 cases who ex-
perienced the expanded secondary end point inclusive 
of all-cause mortality (Table 1). Those who experienced 
the primary JUPITER trial end point were more likely to 
have been allocated to placebo, had slightly lower body 
mass index, were more likely to report current smoking, 
and had higher baseline triglycerides. HDL cholesterol, 
apoA-I, and HDL particle number were each significantly 
lower in cases compared with controls. By contrast, no 
significant difference was noted in baseline cholesterol 
efflux capacity.
Baseline cholesterol efflux capacity was higher in fe-
male participants (Table 2) but did not appreciably vary 
according to treatment group, smoking status, family 
history of premature coronary artery disease, or pres-
ence of the metabolic syndrome. Moderate correlations 
were noted between efflux capacity and other HDL-relat-
ed phenotypes (Figure 1 and Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). LDL-related biomarkers demonstrat-
ed modest correlations with cholesterol efflux capacity, 
with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.19, 0.15, 
and 0.18 for non-HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, 
and apolipoprotein B levels, respectively (P<0.0001 
for each). HsCRP and lipoprotein-associated phospholi-
pase A2 activity levels, biomarkers of inflammation, both 
demonstrated inverse correlations with efflux capacity 
(Spearman correlation coefficients –0.09 and –0.21, re-
spectively; P=0.003 and P<0.0001).
Overall, no significant association was found between 
baseline cholesterol efflux capacity and incident cardio-
vascular events, with adjusted odds ratios for tertiles 2 
and 3 compared with tertile 1 of 1.08 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.70–1.67) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.47–1.21), 
respectively. Similarly, the adjusted odds ratio per SD 
increment in efflux capacity was not statistically signifi-
cant—0.89 (95% CI, 0.72–1.10; P=0.28) (Table 3 and 
Figure 2). No significant heterogeneity of effect was 
noted according to sex, randomization to rosuvastatin 
versus placebo, or in participants stratified according to 
median hsCRP levels or other clinical subgroups (Table 
III in the online-only Data Supplement). The efficacy of 
rosuvastatin was also similar across tertiles of baseline 
cholesterol efflux capacity (Table IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Twelve-month levels of cholesterol efflux capacity 
were available in 617 of 1050 (59%) study participants. 
Rosuvastatin treatment compared with placebo did not 
lead to a significant change in cholesterol efflux capacity 
(Table 4). By contrast, a modest increase in HDL cho-
lesterol, apoA-I, and HDL particle number levels was 
noted in individuals randomized to rosuvastatin treat-

ment, with average percentage change values of 7.7, 
4.3, and 5.2%, respectively (Table 4). Moderate correla-
tions were noted between change in cholesterol efflux 
capacity and change in HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, and HDL 
particle number (Spearman r=0.26, 0.36, 0.20 respec-
tively; P<0.001 for each; Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Change in efflux capacity was not related 
to incident cardiovascular events (adjusted odds ratio 
per 10% change, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88–1.04; P=0.33; 
Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement).
On-statin levels of cholesterol efflux capacity were 
available for 248 of 450 (55%) of rosuvastatin-treat-
ed study participants (Table VII in the online-only Data 
Supplement). On-statin cholesterol efflux capacity was 
significantly associated with risk of incident cardiovascu-
lar events for the primary end point (odds ratio per SD 
increment, 0.62; P=0.02) but not for the expanded end 
point inclusive of total mortality (odds ratio per SDincre-
ment, 0.79; P=0.13) (Table 5 and Figure 2). No signifi-
cant heterogeneity of effect was noted across clinical or 
biomarker parameters (Table VIII in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Among HDL-related biomarkers assessed at baseline, 
HDL particle number had the strongest inverse associa-
tion with incident cardiovascular events, followed by HDL 
cholesterol and apoA-I levels (Figure 2 and Table IX in the 
online-only Data Supplement). A similar pattern emerged 
in the on-statin analysis; although point estimates for all

4 HDL-related biomarkers suggested an inverse associa-
tion with incident events, HDL particle number emerged 
as the strongest inverse predictors of incident events 
(Figure 2, Table 6, and Table X in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Effect estimates for baseline and on-treat-
ment associations were similar in a sensitivity analysis 
to cases (N=182) with an incident hard cardiovascular 
event of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular 
death. It is important to note that the magnitude of as-
sociation for these biomarkers compares favorably to 
that observed for non-HDL cholesterol, a frequently used 
surrogate for atherogenic apolipoprotein-B-containing li-
poproteins. For example, in a model adjusting for age, 
treatment, race, systolic blood pressure, smoking, body 
mass index, and fasting glucose, an odds ratio per SD 
lower non-HDL cholesterol of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.53–1.00; 
P=0.05) was observed.
Inclusion of alternate HDL-related biomarkers in the 
same regression model was used to isolate independent 
predictors of residual risk for incident cardiovascular 
events (Table 6). In this analysis, the inverse association 
between HDL particle number levels and incident CVD 
was the most robust and maintained significance in each 
of the mutually adjusted models.
DISCUSSION
In a nested case-control study in the JUPITER trial of 
participants with elevated hsCRP but normal or low LDL 
cholesterol, we determined the relationship among 4 key 
markers of HDL metabolism—HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, 
HDL particle number, and cholesterol efflux capacity—
and risk of incident CVD. An inverse relationship was 
noted for on-statin, but not baseline, cholesterol efflux 
capacity and incident cardiovascular events. Among all 4 
HDL-related phenotypes analyzed, HDL particle number 
emerged as the strongest inverse predictor of incident 
events, at both baseline and during potent statin therapy.
Our findings of moderate correlations between 
cholesterol efflux capacity and HDL cholesterol levels, 
apoA-I, and HDL particle number are in keeping with 
multiple previous reports.15–17 We extend these obser-
vations to note an inverse association between cho-
lesterol efflux capacity and the inflammatory biomark-
ers hsCRP and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase 
A2 activity. This finding is consistent with previous 
mouse and human data suggesting that remodeling 
of the HDL proteome or site-specific oxidation of apo-
lipoprotein A-I by myeloperoxidase in an inflammatory

setting inhibits cholesterol efflux and the reverse cho-
lesterol transport pathway.26–28
Rosuvastatin was associated with an increase in HDL 
cholesterol, apoA-I, and HDL particle number as previ-
ously reported,12 but it had no impact on cholesterol ef-
flux capacity, consistent with a similar result noted in a 
randomized trial involving pravastatin or atorvastatin.15
In contrast with most previous studies,15–18 we did 
not observe a significant inverse relationship between 
baseline cholesterol efflux capacity and incident cardio-
vascular events in JUPITER. One potential explanation 
for this directionally consistent but less striking relation-
ship may relate to the elevated hsCRP for all JUPITER 
participants. The drivers of atherosclerotic events in 
this inflammatory context may be different than those in 
previous population-based studies.15–19 It is interesting 
to note that on-statin cholesterol efflux capacity was in-
versely associated with incident cardiovascular events. 
This finding could reflect the increased importance of 
HDL functionality in the context of a low-achieved LDL 
cholesterol or during statin therapy. Although not con-
clusive, this association supports ongoing efforts to in-
corporate therapies that promote reverse cholesterol 
transport into statin-based regimens to improve patient 
outcomes.
The current study findings add to a growing body of 
evidence supporting HDL particle number as a stronger 
predictor of incident cardiovascular events than HDL 
cholesterol or apoA-I levels. Similar observations were 
noted from less contemporary population cohorts6–8 and 
clinical trial-based analyses.9–12 In the Women’s Health 
Study, a significant inverse relationship was noted with 
incident coronary events29 but not for overall cardiovas-
cular outcomes.30 The present study extends this previ-
ous evidence base, noting that HDL particle number was 
the strongest HDL-related biomarker of residual risk in 
participants treated with potent statin therapy. In addi-
tion, we note that HDL particle number was a better risk 
predictor than the best-validated metric of HDL function-
ality, cholesterol efflux capacity. If confirmed in addition-
al studies, HDL particle number assessment may have 
value as a surrogate for clinical efficacy in the assess-
ment of interventions targeting HDL metabolism. This 
nuclear magnetic resonance -based assessment affords 
considerable logistical advantages over cholesterol ef-
flux capacity, a cell-based assay that requires significant 
resources and is difficult to standardize across studies 
or research groups.
Strengths of the study include detailed assessment 
of 4 HDL-related phenotypes in a contemporary clini-
cal trial population, prospective adjudication of all trial 
end points, and randomized allocation of potent statin 
therapy to achieve low levels of circulating LDL cho-
lesterol. A limitation of this study is that the JUPITER 
trial was terminated after a median follow-up of 1.9 
years on the basis of demonstrated efficacy of rosu-
vastatin therapy in cardiovascular event reduction.20 
The relatively small number of CVD events may have 
limited power to detect associations between HDL re-
lated phenotypes and outcomes, particularly in analy-
ses restricted to those receiving rosuvastatin therapy. 
Furthermore, the generalizability of our findings may 
be limited beyond the population studied in the JUPI-
TER trial.

CONCLUSIONS
On-statin but not baseline cholesterol efflux capacity was 
inversely associated with incident cardiovascular events 
in JUPITER trial participants. Among 4 HDL-related bio-
markers, HDL particle number was the strongest inverse 
predictor of risk in both baseline and on-statin analyses. 
Whether a therapy designed to enhance cholesterol ef-
flux capacity or increase HDL particle number can com-
plement high-potency statin therapy in reducing cardio-
vascular risk remains to be determined.
