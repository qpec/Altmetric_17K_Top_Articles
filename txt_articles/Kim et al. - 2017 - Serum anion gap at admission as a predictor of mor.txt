An accurate method to predict the mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) patients has been required, 
especially in children. The aim of this study is to evaluate the value of serum anion gap (AG) for 
predicting mortality in pediatric ICU (PICU). We reviewed a data of 461 pediatric patients were collected 
on PICU admission. Corrected anion gap (cAG), the AG compensated for abnormal albumin levels, was 
significantly lower in survivors compared with nonsurvivors (p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression 
analysis identified the following variables as independent predictors of mortality; cAG (OR 1.110, 95% 
CI 1.06–1.17; p < 0.001), PIM3 [OR 7.583, 95% CI 1.81–31.78; p = 0.006], and PRISM III [OR 1.076, 95% 
CI 1.02–1.14; p = 0.008]. Comparing AUCs for mortality prediction, there were no statistically significant 
differences between cAG and other mortality prediction models; cAG 0.728, PIM2 0.779, PIM3 
0.822, and PRISM III 0.808. The corporation of cAG to pre-existing mortality prediction models was 
significantly more accurate at predicting mortality than using any of these models alone. We concluded 
that cAG at ICU admission may be used to predict mortality in children, regardless of underlying 
etiology. And the incorporation of cAG to pre-existing mortality prediction models might improve 
predictability.
To improve the quality of intensive care unit (ICU) care, mortality prediction is important1. However, estimation 
of mortality is difficult in critically ill patients whose condition may deteriorate. There are some invasive methods 
to assess the status of patients, such as pulmonary artery wedge pressure measurement, but these take time to 
institute and have side effects, such as infection. Recently developed assessments based on physiologic variables 
have limitations related to the high proportion of missing data, because the variables required are not collected for 
all patients admitted to ICU or not required for direct patient management1. Therefore it is necessary to identify 
noninvasive, easy tools for mortality prediction in ICUs, especially for pediatric ICU (PICU) patients.
Anion gap (AG) is traditionally one of the most commonly used biomarkers. It is the simplest means of eval-
uating the acid-base status of patients, and is calculated from the difference between the measured concentration 
of serum cations and anions. It helps to identify the presence and causes of metabolic acidosis2, 3. In addition, 
calculation of an initial serum AG in adult patients admitted to ICU has been suggested as a sensitive and specific 
tool to predict prognosis or mortality4–6. It has been shown that patients with a high AG have increased admission 
rates to hospital, increased rates of admission to ICU, and increased severity of illness, independent of concomi-
tant electrolyte abnormalities4. An elevated AG is also associated with increased in-hospital mortality compared 
with patients having a normal AG5, 6. However, there is lack of data related to pediatric patients. In pursuit of 
better mortality prediction and proper management of patients in PICU, research on AG as a mortality predictor 
is meaningful.
In this study, we researched several factors associated with mortality in children admitted to PICU. Specifically, 
we investigated whether serum AG measured at the admission to PICU could be strong predictor of mortality, 
and what its predictive value is compared with other mortality prediction models.

Results
Patients’ characteristics. 
From December 2009 to February 2015, a total of 461 pediatric patients were 
included in this study. Predisposing medical diseases were neurologic problems (222 patients, 48.2%), such as 
intractable epilepsy or status epilepticus; respiratory problems (82 patients, 17.8%), such as respiratory infec-
tion or airway obstruction; and hematologic-oncologic problems (69 patients, 15%), such as neutropenic fever 
or tumor lysis syndrome. The patients’ baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. The median age of the 
patients was 3.1 years and 58.1% (268/461) were male. Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.2% (93/461) with a 
median lengh of stay (LOS) in PICU of 10 days. A total of 349 children (75.7%) required mechanical ventilation 
within 24 hours of PICU admission. Overall, 281 (61%) patients had a metabolic acidosis. The most common 
reason for PICU admission was respiratory failure (51.6%).
Clinical Characteristics of survivors and non-survivors. 
Patients were divided into survivors and 
non-survivors on the basis of in-hospital mortality (Table 2). Survivors were younger than non-survivors 
were (median age, 2.4 vs. 5.8 years). Median LOS in PICU was statistically different between survivors and 
non-survivors, 9 days and 14 days, respectively. Non-survivors tended to require mechanical ventilation within 
24 hours of PICU admission. The two groups were distinct in their reasons for PICU admission. The percentage 
of children with respiratory failure, neurologic problems, and requiring intensive monitoring was higher in survi-
vors than in non-survivors. Meanwhile, a higher proportion of non-survivor had sepsis, post-resuscitation status, 
and renal failure. Scoring measurements for mortality prediction used in PICU (PIM2, PIM3, and PRISM III) 
were statistically different between survivors and non-survivors (p < 0.0001).
More than 60% of patients in both groups had metabolic acidosis, but this had no statistical meaning. 
According to the summary data for measured and calculated variables, non-survivors had higher levels of sodium 
and lactate and lower levels of albumin, pH, SBE, and HCO3, compared with survivors. Both AG and cAG at 
admission were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors (p < 0.0001). There were significant differ-
ences in the median values of delta neutrophil index (DNI), coagulation indices (platelets and partial thrombin 
time), and C-reactive protein (CRP) between survivors and non-survivors (p < 0.0001).
Corrected anion gap as a predictor of mortality in PICU patients. 
In the univariable analyses, 15 
variables were correlated with in-hospital mortality (p < 0.01). Of these, 9 variables (age, sex, pH, DNI, platelets, 
cAG and pre-existing mortality prediction models) were introduced into the multivariable logistic regression 
analysis. cAG was identified as an independent factor associated with in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) 
1.110, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–1.17, p < 0.001]. PIM3 and PRISM III were also found to be inde-
pendently associated with mortality (Table 3).
We also considered relationship between cAG at admission and pre-existing mortality prediction models used 
in PICU. Each model was significantly correlated with cAG, but the correlation coefficients were relatively low. 
However, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of cAG, PIM 2, PIM3, and PRISM III showed that there 
were no differences in mortality prediction. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.728 for cAG, 0.779 for 
PIM2, 0.822 for PIM3, and 0.808 for PRISM III score (Table 4, Fig. 1).
The incorporation of cAG to pre-existing mortality prediction models improved their ability to predict mor-
tality (Table 5). The incorporation of cAG to PIM2 gave an NRI of 17.5% (p = 0.001) and IDI of 7.9% (p < 0.001). 
The PIM3 with cAG provided an NRI of 16.7% (p = 0.002) and IDI of 7.3% (p < 0.001). And the incorporation 
of cAG to PRISM III yielded an NRI of 9.4% (p = 0.043) and IDI of 5.2% (p < 0.001). All cAG-incorporated 
models showed good discrimination but, the models of PIM3 with cAG showed was revealed poor calibration in 
Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (p = 0.0004) (Supplementary Table S1).
And comparing AUCs between pre-existing models and cAG-incorporated models, all cAG-incorporated 
models showed improved performance in mortality prediction. But the model of PIM3 with cAG showed no 
statistical significance as well in AUC comparison, even though AUC of PIM3 with cAG (0.855) was greater

Discussion
In this study, serum cAG calculated at the time of PICU admission was higher in non-survivors than in survivors. 
Increased cAG was associated with in-hospital mortality, and was an independent predictor of mortality in PICU 
patients. And cAG was correlated with pre-existing mortality prediction models for children. cAG could be a 
mortality predictor in critically ill children, regardless of the presence of metabolic acidosis or their underlying 
etiology.
Acid-base derangements are common in critically ill patients. Although the pathogenesis is not fully under-
stood, it is well-known that ongoing acid-base disequilibrium could reflect the severity of disease and is associ-
ated with a poor prognosis of the patient7. Many studies have observed a strong association between acidosis and 
increased organ dysfunction and mortality. However, it remains difficult to ensure accurate measurement of in 
ICU patients because of their complex and mixed clinical situations of each8, 9.
In recent years, quantitative approaches to acid-base disturbances have been increasingly applied to clini-
cal practice. These aim to give information about unmeasured anions or strong ion differences for quantitative 
evaluation of acid-base derangements in the ICU10–12. Previous studies compared traditional biomarkers, such 
as pH, base excess, or lactate, as means of assessing acid-base disorders and predicting prognosis in critically ill 
patients13–16. However, their reliability has not been established yet. Therefore, reassessing the clinical application 
of AG, the easiest and most readily available way to calculate acid-base disequilibrium, is useful and meaningful.
AG is a traditional tool used to assess acid-base status and aid the differential diagnosis of metabolic acido-
sis. Because hypoalbuminemia could affect its interpretation, AG should be corrected for serum albumin level. 
An elevated cAG usually reflects the presence of metabolic acidosis caused by the overproduction or decreased 
excretion of organic acids. In addition, elevated cAG has been reported as a predictor of mortality in critically 
ill patients5, 6, 10, 11. In patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia5 and acute myocardial infarction6, the 
presence of an increased cAG acidosis was associated with increased mortality.
Mortality is considered the most reliable endpoint of clinical management in ICU setting. Therefore, esti-
mating mortality risk is an important of ICU care. Several models are available to predict the risk of death of 
children in PICU. By keeping these models updated, the clinical meaning and validity of each prediction model 
have been proved. However, with ongoing revision and updating, these models have become more complicated. 
They require at least 10 variables to be collected from patients, have different coding rules, and each model relies 
on complex calculations, making their application difficult1, 17, 18. Therefore, there is an increasing need to estab-
lish an easy clinical method for use in PICU settings. Several biomarkers such as DNI19, CRP20, procalcitonin21, 
thrombocytopenia22 and eosinopenia23 have been suggested for use in PICU.
We conducted this study to test whether cAG at admission can predict mortality or morbidity in PICU 
patients. Comparing survivors and non-survivors, we determined that an increased cAG at admission to PICU 
was strongly associated with in-hospital mortality, regardless of the underlying etiology. In terms of the multivar-
iable logistic regression analysis for mortality prediction, cAG at admission was identified as the strongest inde-
pendent factor associated with in-hospital death. Furthermore, incorporation of cAG at admission to pre-existing 
mortality prediction models improved their ability of to predict mortality in this study. Considering the complex 
characteristics of physiology and disease etiologies in children, measurement of cAG at admission to PICU could 
aid understanding of current status and the clinical outcome of pediatric patients. This study shows that cAG, 
which is a simple method to calculate, does not require arterial puncture and is readily available, could be a 
marker of mortality prediction in PICU. The limitation of this study is that data were collected retrospectively. We

assessed only the initial cAG at admission to PICU, and obtained the results associated with mortality. And con-
sidering incorporation of cAG to pre-existing mortality prediction models, the model of PIM3 with cAG showed 
good discrimination but poor calibration. There was still a clinical significant improvement in mortality predic-
tion, even if not statistical significant when comparing AUCs between PIM3 and cAG-incorporated PIM3. We 
think that because predictability of standalone PIM3 is already very powerful and the sample size was relatively 
small. But owing to the results of NRI, IDI, and an increase in AUC from 0.822 of PIM3 to 0.855 of PIM3 with 
cAG, cAG is still a useful tool to add on to other mortality prediction models in general. Further studies might 
be needed as a prospective design in a large multicenter setting to validate the ability of cAG to predict clinical 
outcome. And serial assessment of cAG could provide much more information about prognosis in PICU.
In conclusion, an elevated cAG at admission was associated with higher mortality in PICU. We suggest that 
cAG at admission may be used to predict mortality in PICU, regardless of underlying etiology. And the incorpo-
ration of cAG to pre-existing mortality prediction models could improve their performance.
Methods
Study population. 
This was an observational study using data collected retrospectively from the medi-
cal records of children admitted to the PICU at Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea between December 2009 and 
February 2015. Patients were over 1 month and under 18 years of age and were in the care of the Department of 
Pediatrics. Patients were admitted to PICU from the emergency department or the general ward. Patients who 
were discharged or died within 24 hours of PICU admission were excluded. Neonates, patients with cardiac dis-
eases, and patients requiring post-operative care were admitted to and treated in separate specialized units, and 
were thus excluded from this study.
Data collection. 
All data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Blood samples were obtained from 
indwelling arterial catheters or by venipuncture on admission to PICU. The samples were immediately trans-
ported to the central laboratory based in the hospital. Initial arterial blood gases, complete blood cell counts, 
coagulation indices, serum electrolytes, and levels of albumin were analyzed. The AG was calculated as:

Age, sex, in-hospital mortality, length of stay in PICU, underlying etiology, reasons for admission, and require-
ment for mechanical ventilation within 24 hours of PICU admission were recorded. Concomitant metabolic prob-
lems that could affect acid-base status and cAG, such as liver or renal failure, were also recorded. For all patients, 
Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) 218 and PIM 31 were recorded at admission, and the Pediatric Risk of Mortality 
III (PRISM III)17 was recorded at 24 hours after admission to PICU. PIM and PRISM III scores were calculated 
on the basis of required variables of each. And then PIM2 and PIM3 were expressed as ‘logit_probability’ based 
on the logistic regression equation for the derived scores17. But PRISM III was expressed as calculated scores24.
Statistical analysis. 
Baseline characteristics of patients were compared using Mann-Whitney U test 
or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Data were reported as numbers (percentages) or medians (inter-quartile 
range). Groups were compared by the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, and the 
Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. Among variables with P < 0.01 in the univariable logistic regression anal-
yses, less than 9 variables without missing values were introduced into multivariable logistic regression analysis. 
Multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors of mortality and to examine 
the relation between cAG and mortality. The correlation between cAG and pre-existing mortality prediction 
models was assessed using Spearman’s method. Survival curves were determined using Kaplan-Meyer method, 
and the differences in survival according to cutoff values of cAG were analyzed by means of the log-rank test. The 
optimal cutoff value of cAG to predict mortality was chosen by the Youden index and the AUC. Statistical analy-
ses were performed with SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
The predictive values of cAG and PIM2, PIM3, PRISM III for predicting in-hospital mortality were compared 
by calculating the AUC. Between pre-existing models and cAG-incorporated models (PIM2 with cAG, PIM3 with 
cAG, and PRISMIII with cAG), Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for calibration to assess applicability and 
ROC curve for discrimination and comparisons of AUCs were used by SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).
And the net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) statistics 
are introduced to assess the incremental predictive impact of new models that integrate a candidate marker (cAG) 
to pre-existing models (PIM2, PIM3 or PRISM III)25. Subjects are considered separately who develop and who 
do not develop events; patients who are dead or survived in this case. For NRI, each subject is assigned to a risk 
category based on the death probability calculated by the pre-existing mortality prediction models. And then 
each subject is reassigned to a risk category using new mortality prediction models, constructed by incorporation 
of cAG to pre-existing mortality prediction models. After calculating the net proportion of subjects with death 
reassigned to a higher risk category (NRIevemt) and of subjects without events reassigned to a lower risk category 
(NRInonevent), the NRI is the sum of NRIevent and NRInonevent. And the IDI considers separately the actual change in

calculated risk for each individual for those with and those without events. The IDIevent is the difference between 
the mean probability of a new mortality prediction model for those with the event and the mean probability of the 
existing models for those with the event. The IDI for those without events (IDInonevent) is the difference in mean 
probability for those who do not have the event between the reference and new models. The IDI is expressed as 
the total of IDIevents and IDInonevents. If the value of NRI and IDI are over 0, it means that the performance of new 
models to predict mortality is improved than existing models in sensitivity and specificity26. NRI and IDI were 
performed using R software (R version 3.0.1). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
