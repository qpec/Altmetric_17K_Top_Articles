Abstract
Elucidating how cannabinoids affect brain function is instru-
mental for the development of therapeutic tools aiming to
mitigate ‘on target’ side effects of cannabinoid-based thera-
pies. A single treatment with the cannabinoid receptor agonist,
WIN 55,212-2, disrupts recognition memory in mice. Here, we
evaluate how prolonged, intermittent (30 days) exposure to
WIN 55,212-2 (1 mg/kg) alters recognition memory and
impacts on brain metabolism and functional connectivity. We
show that chronic, intermittent treatment with WIN 55,212-2
disrupts recognition memory (Novel Object Recognition Test)
without affecting locomotion and anxiety-like behaviour (Open
Field and Elevated Plus Maze). Through 14C-2-deoxyglucose
functional brain imaging we show that chronic, intermittent
WIN 55,212-2 exposure induces hypometabolism in the
hippocampal dorsal subiculum and in the mediodorsal nucleus
of the thalamus, two brain regions directly involved in
recognition memory. In addition, WIN 55,212-2 exposure
induces hypometabolism in the habenula with a contrasting
hypermetabolism in the globus pallidus. Through the applica-
tion of the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) algorithm
to the brain imaging data, we observed that prolonged WIN
55,212-2 administration alters functional connectivity in brain
networks that underlie recognition memory, including that
between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, the thalamus
and prefrontal cortex, and between the hippocampus and the
perirhinal cortex. In addition, our results support disturbed
lateral habenula and serotonin system functional connectivity
following WIN 55,212-2 exposure. Overall, this study provides
new insight into the functional mechanisms underlying the

Heavy or regular cannabis abuse, generally defined as daily
or almost-daily use over a prolonged period of time, has been
linked to cognitive dysfunction (Abush and Akirav 2012)
and increased risk of developing psychiatric symptoms,
including schizophrenia spectrum disorders (Andr�
easson
et al. 1987; Hall and Degenhardt 2009), acute psychosis
and mania (Khan and Akella 2009) and an amotivational
syndrome (Tunving 1987; Fujiwara 2001; Ozaki and Wada
2001). In addition, cannabis-based medicines are increas-
ingly being used to treat several diseases such as epilepsy
(Maa and Figi 2014), chronic pain (Carter et al., 2015),
multiple sclerosis (Fitzpatrick and Downer 2017) and
neurodegenerative diseases (Fagan and Campbell 2014),
but the potential for negative side effects has not been well
characterized. Understanding the effects of chronic cannabi-
noid exposure upon brain and synaptic function opens a
window into the development of therapeutic tools that could
counteract the ‘on target’ side effects associated with chronic
use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines (Copeland
et al. 2013; Lovelace et al. 2015).
Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) mediates the characteristic
psychoactive effects of exogenous cannabinoids and the
synaptic actions of endocannabinoids (Kano et al. 2009).
One immediate consequence of cannabis consumption is an
impairment in memory consolidation, seen in both humans
(Ranganathan and D’Souza 2006; Borgelt et al. 2013) and
laboratory animals (Clarke et al. 2008; Kano et al. 2009;
Sousa
et al.
2011;
Mouro et al.
2017).
Cannabinoid-
mediated disruptions in learning and memory may be related
to reported impairments in long-term potentiation at gluta-
matergic synapses (Terranova et al. 1995; Stella et al. 1997;
Misner and Sullivan 1999; Wang et al. 2016; Silva-Cruz
et al. 2017), detrimental modifications in fast-/slow-wave
oscillations,
known
to
be
modulated
by
GABAergic
interneurons (Freund et al. 2003), and altered activity in
septal-hippocampal monoaminergic and cholinergic path-
ways, known to regulate cortical plasticity and activity
(Miller and Branconnier 1983; Gessa et al. 1998; Sullivan
2000; Redmer et al. 2003; Khakpai et al. 2012).
Studies in humans, using functional magnetic resonance
imaging, have shown that chronic cannabis users display
significant alterations in functional connectivity in brain
networks relevant to self-awareness (Pujol et al. 2014),
working memory (Cousijn et al. 2013) and recognition
memory (Riba et al. 2015) which may be linked with
functional differences in structures of the medial temporal
lobe and prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Riba et al. 2015). In a
recent study, it was also shown that chronic marijuana use
leads to increased functional connectivity in the orbitofrontal
network, as well as higher functional connectivity in tracts
that innervate the orbitofrontal cortex (Filbey et al. 2014).
However, chronic consumption studies in humans can be
contaminated by confounding variables, such as lifestyle
factors or mixed drug use.
This work was designed to elucidate the impact of chronic,
intermittent cannabinoid exposure on brain metabolism,
functional brain connectivity and recognition memory. We
carry out three different analysis: first, we evaluated recog-
nition memory in the Novel Object Recognition Test
(NORT); secondly, we studied brain metabolic activity in
these animals using 14-C-2-deoxyglucose (14C-2-DG) func-
tional brain imaging and finally, we characterized alterations
in brain network functional connectivity through the appli-
cation of the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
algorithm to the 14C-2-DG brain imaging data. We found out
that adult mice chronically exposed to WIN 55,212-2
displayed impaired recognition memory and differences in
metabolic brain activity and dysfunctional connectivity in
circuits that underlie memory processing, thus providing new
insights into the functional mechanisms that underlie the
impact of chronic cannabinoid exposure on memory.
Methods
Animals
Adult (8–12 weeks old) male C57BL/6 mice (IMSR Cat# CRL:27,
RRID:IMSR_CRL:27) (Charles River, Barcelona, Spain) were used.
Animals were housed in a temperature (22/24°C) and humidity (45–
65%) regulated room with a 14/10-h light/dark cycle (07:00–21:00)
with ad libitum access to food and water. Animal behaviour
experiments were conducted during the light phase at around
the same time each day (10 : 00). All experimentation followed the
European Community Guidelines (Directive 2010/63/EU) and the
Portuguese law (DL 113/2013) for Animal Care for Research
Purposes, and were approved by the ‘Instituto de Medicina
Molecular’ Internal Committee and the Portuguese Animal Ethics
Committee – Direcc

ao Geral de Veterin�
aria. The experimental
protocol was not preregistered. Animals were habituated to the
presence of the investigator and handled for 5 days before testing. A
total of 40 mice were used, 20 were treated with WIN 55,212-2 and
20 were receiving the vehicle only. All animals were used for
behaviour analysis, which was performed in two series of 10 mice
per drug condition, giving a total of 20 mice per condition. For
connectivity analysis, 10 mice per condition were used. To

 determine whether an animal would be allocated to the control or
experimental treatment group a pseudo-randomization procedure
was employed. Animals were tagged and distributed in groups of
five animals to each housing cage (8 cages of 5 animals).
Subsequently, four cages were randomly attributed to each treatment
condition (either control or chronic WIN 55,212-2). To do so, a
number was attributed to each cage and randomly drawn. Drawn
cage numbers were distributed sequentially to either the control or
the experimental group (first drawn number allocated to control, the
second drawn number attributed to experimental group, until all
numbers have been drawn).
Drugs
WIN 55,212-2 (TOCRIS Bioscience, catalogue number 1038,
Bristol, Avon, United Kingdom) was suspended in dimethylsulfox-
ide (Sigma Aldrich, catalogue number D2650, Missouri, St. Louis,
MO, USA at stock concentration of 100 mM, and stored at �20°C;
appropriate dilutions of these solutions were made in saline (NaCl
0.9%) before injection. The amount of dimethylsulfoxide present in
the solutions used for intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections was < 0.6 lL
per mouse, and control animals were injected with equivalent
amounts of vehicle (2 mL/kg).
Chronic WIN 55,212-2 treatment protocol
WIN 55,212-2 was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg i.p., a dose
known to affect recognition memory in the NORT without creating
sedative or cataleptic effects that are associated with higher doses
(Schneider and Koch 2003; Baek et al. 2009; Mouro et al. 2017),
over 30 days. Behavioural tests were carried out on the last 7 days
of treatment. The injections were performed around the same hour
of the day (18 : 00 � 1 h), while behavioural tests were performed
during the morning (10 : 00). Doing so, we avoided withdrawal
symptoms (Maldonado 2002; Lichtman and Martin 2005; Solymosi
and K€
ofalvi 2017), while minimizing acute effects of the drug
during testing. In order to replicate a pattern of chronic intermittent
cannabinoid exposure (Lamarque et al. 2001; Schneider and Koch
2003) animals were treated for 5 consecutive days followed by
2 days without treatment (22 injections over 30 days). This protocol
was designed to minimize the tolerance to WIN 55,212-2 that may
develop during chronic continuous administration (see Maldonado
2002; Hampson et al. 2003; Solymosi and K€
ofalvi 2017). For
further detail on the treatment and experimental protocol see Fig. 1.
Novel object recognition test (NORT)
NORT was conducted in a wooden square open field arena
(40 9 40 9 40 cm) as previously reported (Bailey and Crawley
2009; Antunes and Biala 2012). In brief, the test involved a
habituation period (3 days), a training day and a test day. Before
training, animals were habituated to the arena in the absence of any
stimulus or object, under the same lighting and environmental
conditions, for 20 min over 3 consecutive days. On the fourth day,
after habituation, animals were placed inside the arena, facing away
from the two identical objects (familiar objects) and allowed to
freely explore the environment and objects for 5 min. After a
retention interval of 24 h, to test long-term memory (Clarke et al.
2008; Antunes and Biala 2012), animals were placed inside the
arena with one novel and one familiar object (test day). Animals
were allowed to explore the objects for 5 min. The objects used in
the training and test days were wooden dolls (7 cm height 9 6 cm
width). The role of the object, as either familiar or novel, was
randomized as was the location of their presentation. To randomize
the role of the object a blind experimenter was asked to randomly
select one of the objects to be the novel object for the first animal.
Then, for the following animals, the novel object was always
permuted, to ensure that both objects were used as the novel object
the same number of times in both the control and the experimental
groups (for instance, if the object A was randomly selected for the
trial of animal 1, then for animal 2 the novel object would be object
B, for animal 3 the object would be again object A, and so on).
Between every trial the arena and the objects were cleaned with 30%
ethanol to erase any olfactory clues. The objects were secured to the
bottom of the arena with Velcro, which could not be seen or touched
by the animals, and were placed in opposite corners of the arena.
Activity was recorded using the video-tracking software – SMART�
(RRID:SCR_002852). To refine the results obtained by software
measures, a post-analysis was conducted. In the post-analysis, the
investigator was blind to the experimental condition. Exploratory
behaviour was quantified as the amount of time (seconds) animals
spent investigating each object (only direct approaches were
considered; ≤ 1 cm distance). The number of approaches that
included sniffing the object, rearing towards the object or touching
the object was counted (Ennaceur and Delacour 1988; Ennaceur
Fig. 1 Scheme depicting the treatment schedule and overall experi-
mental protocol. Over 30 consecutive days mice were treated with 22
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections with WIN 55,212-2 or vehicle control.
Behavioural tests were performed between days 22 and 26; as
indicated in the inset. The habituation phase of novel object recognition
test (NORT) was initiated on day 22, simultaneously with the open field
test (OFT). The habituation continued on the days 23 and 24. The
training phase of NORT was performed on day 25. On day 26 the test
phase of NORT was performed. Immediately after the NORT animals
were placed in the EPM to assess anxiety-like behaviour. Subse-
quently, 24 h after the final WIN 55,212-2 treatment, animals under-
went the 14C-2-deoxyglucose brain imaging protocol. From the initial
40 animals, one animal of the control group was excluded by post-
analysis (outlier, p < 0.05); thus, 19 control and 20 WIN 55,212-2-
treated mice were used in the behavioural assays and 10 control and
10 WIN 55,212-2-treated mice were used in the 14C-2-deoxyglucose
brain imaging study.

 2010; Antunes and Biala 2012). Exploration of each object was
quantified as the novelty preference index (NPI) – calculated as
(B�A)/(B+A), where B corresponds to the time spent exploring the
novel object and A the time spent exploring the familiar object,
during the test phase of NORT. This index ranges from �1 to 1
(�1 = exclusive exploration of the familiar object; 0 = absence of
discrimination between novel and familiar objects, i.e. equal time
exploring both objects; and 1 = exploration of the novel object
only). We defined full immobility during the test stage of NORT as
an a priori exclusion criterion, by which no animals were excluded
from analysis. However, data from one animal on the control group
were eliminated by post-analysis as it corresponded to a significant
outlier (p < 0.05).
Open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM)
Anxiety-like and locomotor behaviour were analysed in the OFT
and EPM. Behaviour in the OFT was analysed before the NORT.
The OFT was used to assess individual behaviour when animals
were placed in a novel environment (Wilson et al. 1976), as well
as anxiety (Careau et al. 2012). As locomotor activity can impact
exploratory drive (Broadhurst 1957, 1958; Stanford 2007), it was
important to ascertain that animals did not display significant
differences in locomotor activity. The OFT took place in the same
arena as that used for the NORT (square open field arena: 40 9 40
9 40 cm) and activity was recorded during the first time that
animals had contact with the environment, that is, on the first
5 min of the first day of NOR habituation phase (see schematics on
Fig. 1). To quantify behaviour, the percentage of time spent in the
central zone of the arena was used as an indicator of anxiety, as
previously described (Mouro et al. 2017). Mean velocity and
distance moved were quantified to compare locomotor abilities
between the experimental groups. Activity was recorded and
analysed using the video-tracking software – SMART� (RRID:
SCR_002852). The reference point used by the software to
determine the position of the animal was the centre of the mouse
dorsum, as done previously in our Institute (Batalha et al. 2013;
Coelho et al. 2014; Mouro et al. 2017). Environmental conditions
and animal manipulation procedures were kept as similar as
possible between animals.
Anxiety-like behaviour was also assessed in the EPM. Immedi-
ately after being tested in the NORT during the test day (see
schematics on Fig. 1), animals were placed in a maze shaped like a
plus sign composed by two open arms with no walls (5 9 29 cm)
and two closed arms (5 9 29 9 15 cm) arranged perpendicularly
and elevated 50 cm above the floor (Mouro et al. 2017). Animals
were placed on the centre of the maze, facing an open arm, and
allowed to freely explore the maze during 5 min. The total time
spent in open arms was used as a measure of anxiety-like behaviour
(Pellow et al. 1985; Coelho et al. 2014; Mouro et al. 2017).
14C-2-D-deoxyglucose functional brain imaging
Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was determined after the
final WIN 55,212-2 (or vehicle) treatment (n = 10 per group, at day
31 for half of the controls and half of the test animals, at day 32 for
the remaining animals), in accordance with previously published
protocols (Dawson et al. 2012, 2015). In brief, mice were injected
i.p. with 4.625 MBq/Kg of 2-deoxy-D-[14C]glucose diluted in
physiological saline (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., USA,
catalogue number ARC 0111A, dose volume of 2.5 mL/kg). After
the injection animals were returned to their home cages. Forty-five
minutes after isotope injection, animals were killed by cervical
dislocation and subsequently decapitated. A terminal blood sample
was collected from the neck by torso inversion, to determine
circulating glucose levels (Accu-Chek Aviva Blood Glucose
Monitor). The brain was dissected out and immediately frozen in
isopentane (�40°C) and stored at �80°C until sectioning. Blood
samples were centrifuged to separate the plasma for determination of
plasma 2-deoxy-D-[14C]-glucose concentration by liquid scintilla-
tion analysis (Table S1).
Brains were coronally sectioned in a cryostat (�20°C) at 20 lm.
Three consecutive sections were retained from every 60 lm and
dried rapidly onto slide covers on a hot plate (70°C). Autoradio-
grams were obtained by placing these sections, along with pre-
calibrated 14C-standards (39-1069 nCi/g tissue equivalents; Amer-
ican Radiolabelled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA, catalogue
number ARC 0146R) to high-resolution autoradiographic film
(Carestream Kodak Biomax MR, Sigma-Aldrich, UK, catalogue
number Z358460-50EA) for 7 days, after which they were devel-
oped in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Autora-
diographic images were analysed by computer-based images
analysis (MCID/M5) (RRID:SCR_014278). The local isotope
concentration for each brain region of interest (RoI) was obtained
directly from the optical density of autoradiographic images relative
to that of co-exposed 14C-standards. Forty-nine anatomically distinct
RoI were measured with reference to a stereotactic mouse brain atlas
(Paxinos and Franklin 2001) (RRID:SCR_007127). LCGU in each
RoI was obtained by comparing the ratio of 14C in each RoI to the
14C concentration in the whole brain of the same animal, referred to
as the 14C-2-DG uptake ratio (14C-2-DG UR). The whole brain
average
14C concentration was determined as the average
14C
concentration across all sections in which a RoI was measured. No
animals were excluded from this data set.
Functional brain connectivity
Regional functional connectivity was analysed in control (saline
treated) and WIN 55,212-2-treated mice. To elucidate the impact of
chronic WIN 55,212-2 exposure on regional functional connectivity,
we applied the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) algorithm
(pls package in R, https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pls, Mevik
and Wehrens 2007) to characterize statistically significant differ-
ences in the functional connectivity of defined ‘seed regions’ to all
the other RoI’s analysed. In our analysis these seed regions were
chosen on the basis of the overt differences in LCGU seen following
chronic WIN 55,212-2 treatment (Fig. 4). Thus, the chosen seed
brain regions in our analysis were the dorsal subiculum of the
ventral hippocampus (DSub), the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus
(MD), the habenula (Hab) and the globus pallidus (GP). The
application of the PLSR algorithm to functional 14C-2-DG imaging
data was undertaken as previously reported (Dawson et al. 2012,
2015). In brief, functional connectivity between each seed RoI and
all other RoI measured was defined by the variable importance to the
projection (VIP) statistic gained from PLSR analysis. A significant
functional connection between brain regions was considered to exist
if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the VIP statistic exceeded 0.8,
denoting a considerable contribution of the explanatory variable
(RoI) to the dependent variable (seed region) in PLSR analysis. The
SD and CI of the VIP statistic were estimated by jack-knifing. The

 significance of WIN 55,212-2-induced alterations in the VIP statistic
was determined by t-test with post hoc Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons. WIN 55,212-2-induced alterations in func-
tional connectivity on this basis were thus defined as being
significant increases or reductions in functional connectivity (where
the value of the VIP statistic is significantly altered between the
groups but the 95% CI of the VIP statistic exceeds the 0.8 threshold
in both experimental groups), or significantly lost or newly gained
functional connectivity (WIN 55,212-2-treated animals significantly
different from controls and the 95% CI of the VIP statistic exceeds
the 0.8 threshold in only one of the experimental groups).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means � SEM. All data sets were tested for
normality and analysed in Graphpad Prism 6 software (RRID:
SCR_002798) or R (version 3.4.4, http://www.r-project.org, RRID:
SCR_001905). A test for outliers was performed using the Graphpad
Outlier Calculator. NORT data were analysed using two-tailed,
paired or unpaired Student’s t-tests, as appropriate for each condition
and as indicated in the figure legends. Overt alterations in LCGU
were statistically analysed by Student’s t-test, with discrete RoI
treated as independent variables, as previously justified (Kelly and
McCulloch 1987). Significance was set at p < 0.05 throughout.
Results
Chronic, intermittent WIN-55,212-2 administration
disrupts recognition memory
Chronic, intermittent exposure to the cannabinoid agonist
WIN 55,212-2 disrupted recognition memory evaluated in the
NORT. In the training phase, control animals (vehicle treated)
and animals treated chronically with WIN 55,212-2 explored
the two identical objects for a similar amount of time (Fig. 2,
panel a). However, on the test day, while control animals
showed a significant preference for the novel as compared with
the familiar object (p < 0.001, n = 19), WIN 22,515-2-treated
animals did not (p > 0.05, n = 20). A similar effect was seen
when analysing the novelty preference index (NPI) with
control animals showing a significant preference for the novel
object during the test phase (p < 0.05, n = 19), while WIN
55,212-2-treated animals did not (Fig. 2, panel b). Impor-
tantly, we found that there was no significant difference in the
total time of object exploration between control and WIN
55,212-2-treated mice, during either the training or test phase
(Fig. 2, panels c and d).
The NPI scores obtained in this work were not signifi-
cantly different from zero, being similar to those previously
reported by us using the same NORT paradigm in mice of the
same age during acute WIN 55,212-2 administration (Mouro
et al. 2017). This indicates that the treatment schedule used
in this work does not result in tolerance with regards to
recognition memory. Once confirmed this was then taken as
a positive control to proceed for the assessment of the
influence of WIN 55,212-2 upon brain metabolism and
functional brain connectivity, to elucidated the functional
changes underlying this deficit.
Chronic, intermittent WIN-55,212-2 administration does
not alter locomotor behaviour or anxiety-like behaviour
Anxiety-like behaviour and locomotor abilities were mea-
sured before, after and during the memory test, using,
respectively, the OF test, the EPM and by measuring the total
time of object exploration during the test phase of the NORT.
We found no evidence to suggest that chronic WIN 55,212-2
administration significantly impacted on locomotor activity
or anxiety-like behaviour (Figs 2 panel c and d and 3).
Chronic, intermittent WIN 55,212-2 administration alters
LCGU
Chronic, intermittent WIN 55,212-2 administration induced
both increases and decreases in LCGU on a brain region-
dependent basis. WIN 55,212-2-treated mice showed marked
hypometabolism in the dorsal subiculum of the ventral
hippocampus (DSub), the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus
(MD) and in the habenula (Hab) (p < 0.05, n = 10). By
contrast, WIN 55,212-2-treated animals showed significant
hypermetabolism in only one of the brain regions analysed,
the Globus Pallidus (GP) (p < 0.05, n = 10). These results
support altered function in the basal ganglia–thalamic–
hippocampal circuits (Fig. 4). Interestingly, when measuring
LCGU on three different amygdala regions, there were no
statistically significant differences between control and
experimental groups. Thus, these data support the results
obtained in the behaviour tests which showed no significant
differences in anxiety-like behaviour (Fig. 3) following
chronic WIN 55,212-2 administration. Full 14C-2-deoxyglu-
cose brain imaging data are shown in the supplemental
material (Table S2). Blood glucose and level of 14C-2-DG in
the plasma were not significantly altered in control and WIN
55,212-2-treated animals (Table S1).
Regional functional connectivity
We analysed the functional connectivity of four ‘seed’
regions, defined as those where we had identified a
significant impact of WIN 55,212-2 treatment on LCGU
(DSub, MD, Hab, GP). Analysis by means of PLSR
algorithm revealed significant modifications in functional
connectivity in the mice that had received WIN 55,212-2
(Fig. 5).
For the DSub of the ventral hippocampus, in control
animals this region was significantly connected to multiple
subfields of the PFC, selected other ventral hippocampal
subfields and to the serotonergic raph�
e (dorsal raph�
e, DR;
median raph�
e, MR; Table S3). In animals treated with WIN
55,212-2, functional connectivity of the DSub was signifi-
cantly altered. Specifically, significant decreases in (anterior
prelimbic, aPrL; medial orbital MO and medial prelimbic,
mPrL) and lost (infralimbic, IL) connectivity with multiple
PFC regions were seen in animals treated chronically with
WIN 55,212-2. By contrast, chronic WIN 55,212-2 admin-
istration resulted in new abnormal functional connectivity

 between the DSub of the ventral hippocampus and subfields
of the dorsal hippocampus (CA1, CA2). In addition,
functional connectivity of the DSub to other subfields in
the ventral hippocampus was significantly enhanced (Mol,
CA3) or gained (DG) in WIN 55,212-2-treated animals. This
suggests that the local connectivity of the ventral hippocam-
pus DSub to other hippocampal subfields was significantly
increased as a result of chronic WIN 55,212-2 administra-
tion. In addition, functional connectivity of the DSub to the
perirhinal cortex was abnormally gained in response to
chronic WIN 55,212-2 treatment. Furthermore, the DSub
gained new functional connectivity to discrete thalamic
nuclei (anteroventral, AV; mediodorsal, MD) and to the
serotonergic MR following chronic WIN-55,212-2 adminis-
tration.
In control animals the Hab was functionally connected
with several PFC subfields and several striatal, hippocampal
and amygdala regions (Table S4). Following chronic WIN
55,212-2 treatment the functional connectivity of the Hab
was significantly altered. On one hand, the Hab lost
functional connectivity with multiple PFC subfields (frontal
association area; dorsolateral orbital cortex; lateral orbital
cortex, LO and IL) and showed significantly lost (substantia
nigra pars compacta, SNC) and decreased connectivity
(dorsolateral striatum; GP and substantia nigra pars reticu-
lata, SNR) to several regions of the basal ganglia. By
contrast, WIN 55,212-2 treatment provoked abnormal gains
in connectivity between the Hab and subfields of the nucleus
accumbens (core, AcbC; shell, AcbSh), with the serotonergic
system (dorsal raph�
e, DR).

 In control animals the MD thalamic nucleus was signif-
icantly functionally connected to multiple subfields of the
prefrontal cortex (PFC), other cortical regions and other
thalamic nuclei (Table S5). The functional connectivity of
the MD was significantly altered in mice treated chronically
with WIN 55,212-2. This included significantly lost (an-
teroventral nucleus, AV) or decreased (anteromedial nucleus,
AM; anterior reticular thalamus) connectivity to other
thalamic nuclei, and cortical regions (frontal association
cortex, frontal association area; insular cortex, Ins). By
contrast, chronic WIN 55,212-2 treatment resulted in new,
abnormal functional connectivity between the MD and
multiple subfields of the septum/diagonal band of Broca
(medial septum, MS; lateral septum, LS; ventral limb of the
diagonal band of broca, VDB).
Finally, in control animals the GP was functionally
connected to numerous regions of the septum/diagonal band
of Broca, and to striatal and cortical regions (Table S6). As a
consequence of chronic WIN 55,212-2 treatment the func-
tional connectivity of the GP was significantly modified. The
GP significantly lost functional connectivity with several
regions of the septum/diagonal band of Broca (medial
septum, MS; ventral limb diagonal band of Broca, VDB;
horizontal limb diagonal band of Broca) and to the striatum
(dorsolateral
striatum
and
ventrolateral
striatum).
By
contrast, the GP gained abnormal new connectivity with
PFC (dorsolateral orbital cortex, mPrl and cingulate cortex,
Cg1) and to the serotonergic raphe (MR and DR) following
chronic, intermittent WIN 55,212-2 treatment.
Discussion
In this work we demonstrated that mice chronically exposed
to the non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN
55,212-2, displayed disrupted cerebral metabolism and
abnormal functional connectivity in the cortico–thalamic–
hippocampal circuits that underlie recognition memory. This
includes
compromised
perirhinal–hippocampus–prefrontal
cortex and thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. In
parallel, we observed deficits in recognition memory as a
consequence of chronic WIN 55,212-2 administration with-
out
signs
of
altered
motor
abilities
and
anxiety-like
behaviour.
CB1Rs on synapses inhibit glutamatergic and GABAergic
transmission, modulate different forms of synaptic plasticity
and control neural oscillations that support behaviour and
diverse cognitive functions, including learning and memory
(Hajos et al. 2000; Piomelli 2003; Kano et al. 2009;
Albayram et al. 2016; Araque et al. 2017; Lupica et al.
2017). Altogether, previous data also suggest that endo- and
Fig. 3 Chronic, intermittent WIN55, 212-2
treatment does not impact on locomotor
activity or anxiety-like behaviour. Panel (a)
and (b) – Locomotor abilities were assessed
in the open field test (OFT) (panels (a) and
(b)), performed during the first habituation
day of the novel object recognition test
(NORT). Chronic WIN, 55,212-2 treatment
did not significantly alter the total distance
travelled (panel a) or velocity (panel b) in
comparison with vehicle-treated
controls
(p > 0.05,

Student’s
t-test).
Panels (c) and (d) –Anxiety-like behaviour
was assessed at two time points: before the
novel object recognition test (NORT) in the

spent in the central zone (panel c), and after
novel object recognition test (NORT), in the
EPM
test
(panel
d)
by
evaluating
the
percentage of time spent in the open arms
of the maze. In both tests, there were no
significant differences between WIN 55,212-

animals
and

controls
(p > 0.05,

 exo- cannabinoids may induce the functional reconfiguration
of neuronal and brain networks to impact on memory
processing,
and
we
now
specifically
addressed
this
possibility.
Object recognition learning and memory is a process
involving multiple items, the contextual clues surrounding
them and the temporal order in each they are presented.
Effective recognition memory depends on functional inter-
actions within a circuit comprised by the perirhinal cortex
(Bussey et al. 2000; Warburton and Brown 2010), the
hippocampus (Brown and Aggleton 2001; Barker and
Warburton 2011), the medial prefrontal cortex (O’Neil et al.
2012) and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (Mitchell
et al. 2005; Warburton and Brown 2015). In this work we
report deficits on recognition memory following chronic,
intermittent WIN 55,212-2 treatment as assessed by the
NORT. Data from the behavioural test served as a positive
confirmation for the results obtained from the brain imaging
and functional connectivity experiments, discussed below.
We found that chronic, intermittent WIN 55-212-2 admin-
istration significantly impacts on the function and connec-
tivity of the hippocampal dorsal subiculum (DSub, Fig. 5), in
line with previous suggestions that the subiculum is involved
in recognition memory (Chang and Huerta 2012). The
subiculum is a primary output structure of the hippocampus
and receives direct projections from other brain regions
critical for recognition memory, including the perirhinal
cortex (Amaral et al. 2007). Monosynaptic and reciprocal
connections between the subiculum and the perirhinal and
the postrhinal cortices exist (Witter et al. 2000), implicating
the subiculum in a short functional loop with cortical areas
known to be crucial for recognition memory (Warburton and

Panel (a) – Chronic, intermittent WIN 55,212-2 administration induced

(DS), Mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and Habenula (Hab) and increased

metabolism in the amygdala nuclei (Basolateral, BLA; Central, CeA;
Medial, MeA) was not significantly altered in WIN 55,212-treated
animals. | Data shown as the 14C-2-DG uptake ratio obtained for each

F. M. Mouro et al.
 Brown 2010). Our study revealed that chronic, intermittent
WIN 55,212-2 treatment induced a pattern of irregular and
dysfunctional connectivity between the dorsal subiculum and
virtually every other subfield of the hippocampus (CA1,
CA2, CA3, ML and DG; Fig. 5). Furthermore, chronic,
intermittent WIN 55,212-2 treatment impaired connectivity
between the dorsal subiculum and several subfields of the
prefrontal cortex, another structure directly implicated in
recognition memory (Riba et al. 2015).
We
also
found
widespread
evidence
for
functional
dysconnectivity of the mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nuclei
as a consequence of WIN 55,212-2 administration, which
could also contribute to the deficits in recognition memory
seen in these animals. Indeed, there is building evidence
supporting a cortico–thalamic–hippocampal network, includ-
ing the MD, that underlies recognition memory, in part as a
result of the ability of the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei to act
as a relay between the perirhinal and the medial prefrontal
cortex (Parker and Gaffan 1998; Warburton and Brown
2015). The mediodorsal thalamic nucleus directly projects to
the hippocampus and to the prefrontal cortex. Lesions in this
thalamic nucleus result in recognition memory deficits
(Parker et al. 1997), replicating deficits related with lesions
of the medial temporal lobe (Warburton and Brown 2015). In
addition, it has been previously shown that disconnection of
the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus from the medial temporal
cortex impairs object-in-place and temporal order perfor-
mance (Cross et al. 2012).
The habenula is an important anatomical hub involved in a
diverse range of behaviours including reward processing,
reward prediction error, memory and the stress response
(Naamboodiri et al. 2016). The habenula receives direct
projections from the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia
(globus pallidus, Hikosaka et al. 2008), regions that show
reduced functional connectivity to the habenula after chronic,
intermittent WIN 55,212-2 administration (Fig. 4). The
habenula also sends direct projections to dopamine-rich
brain regions including the ventral tegmental area and
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC, Hikosaka et al.
2008). Remarkably, the functional connectivity of the
habenula to these regions is also lost in animals treated
chronically with WIN 55,212-2. Moreover, the functional

connectivity in neural circuits underpinning recognition memory.

Cannabinoids modify brain functional connectivity
79
 connectivity of the habenula to other components of the
mesolimbic system, including the nucleus accumbens, is also
significantly altered by chronic WIN 55,212-2-treated ani-
mals. These effects may relate to the amotivation syndrome
(Tunving 1987) and reward processing deficits (Fujiwara
2001; Friemel et al. 2014) seen as a result of cannabinoid
exposure. By contrast, the functional connectivity of the
habenula to the serotonergic raphe, to which the habenula
directly projects, is abnormally enhanced by chronic WIN
55,212-2 administration. This suggests that chronic cannabi-
noid exposure may impact both dopaminergic and seroton-
ergic system function by impacting, in part, on the functional
connectivity of the habenula.
Altered serotonin system function as a result of chronic,
intermittent WIN55,212-2 administration, is also supported by
broader evidence of altered raph�
e nuclei functional connec-
tivity, being evident to each of the seed brain regions analysed.
A number of previous studies have found that chronic
cannabinoid exposure alters the functioning of the serotonin
system, including the induction of altered serotonin levels
(Sagredo et al. 2006) and serotonin receptor activity (Darmani
2001; Hill et al. 2006; Moranta et al. 2009; Franklin et al.,
2013; Esteban and Garc�
ıa-Sevilla 2012). Moreover, the role of
the serotonin system in recognition memory is firmly estab-
lished (Zhang et al. 2013, 2015) suggesting that the disruption
of serotonin system connectivity may be one of the key
mechanisms by which chronic, intermittent WIN 55,212-2
exposure impairs recognition memory. This possibility war-
rants, however, further systematic investigation. If found to be
correct, targeting the serotonin system may represent a
therapeutic strategy to restore memory deficits as a conse-
quence of chronic cannabinoid exposure.
Cannabinoid intake induces more severe behavioural
deficits in pubertal rats than in mature animals (Schneider
and Koch 2002; Schneider et al., 2008). Indeed, short-term
recognition memory impairments (30 min retention time in
NORT) can persist beyond cannabinoid exposure if the
exposure occurs during the pubertal period (Schneider and
Koch 2002; Schneider et al., 2008), but not if the exposure
occurs only during adulthood (Schneider and Koch 2003) or
even if it occurs only during the pre-pubertal period (Schneider
et al. 2005). However, as we herein show, cannabinoid
exposure in adulthood does induce alterations in brain
metabolism and connectivity, and these alterations are accom-
panied by significant recognition memory impairments over
longer retention intervals (24 h). In addition, the present
evidence showing that functional connectivity between the
thalamus and prefrontal cortex is affected by cannabinoid
exposure is in line with previous findings that cannabinoids can
exacerbate deficits induced by prefrontal cortex lesions
(Schneider and Koch 2005; Schneider and Koch 2007).
The exact pharmacological identification of the receptor
influenced by the cannabinoid compound used in this work is
outside its objective. However, there is evidence that
supports the possibility of the presently described actions
of WIN 55,212-2 being mediated through CB1R. WIN 55-
212,2 is one of the most commonly used cannabinomimetics
to study the role of the CB1R and the CB2R (Solymosi and
K€
ofalvi 2017), showing similar preference for activating both
receptors (Pertwee et al. 2010). On the other hand, evidence
has consistently shown that WIN 55,212-2 has no effect
upon G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) (Johns et al.
2007; Ryberg et al. 2007; Pertwee et al. 2010; Solymosi and
K€
ofalvi 2017). We previously showed that the CB1R
selective antagonist (AM 251) abolished the impact of acute
WIN 55,212-2 administration on recognition memory, which
was evaluated with the same NORT paradigm and using
mice of the same age as used in this study (Mouro et al.
2017), supporting involvement of CB1R. There is, in fact, a
broad range of evidence supporting the involvement of CB1R
in memory deficits (Clarke et al. 2008; Suenaga and Ichitani
2008; Wise et al. 2009), while CB2R agonists do not seem to
affect recognition memory (Clarke et al. 2008). Regarding
modifications of brain metabolism following cannabinoid
administration, evidence shows that CB1R agonists lead to
decreases in glucose uptake (Duarte et al. 2012; Miederer
et al. 2017) and mitochondrial respiration (B�
enard et al.
2012).
In conclusion, we herein demonstrated that prolonged,
intermittent exposure of adult mice to the non-selective
cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 induces alter-
ations in metabolic brain activity in selected brain regions,
alters their functional connectivity and impairs recognition
memory. Connectivity modifications were seen in circuits
known to be directly involved in recognition memory, and
for the habenula and raph�
e nuclei. These data give new
insight into the mechanisms by which chronic cannabinoid
exposure impacts on behaviour and cognition, and highlight
the value of considering cannabinoid actions at the systems-
level perspective.
