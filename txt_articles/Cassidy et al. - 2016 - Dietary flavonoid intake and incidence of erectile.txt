ABSTRACT
Background: The predominant etiology for erectile dysfunction
(ED) is vascular, but limited data are available on the role of diet.
A higher intake of several flavonoids reduces diabetes and cardio-
vascular disease risk, but no studies have examined associations
between flavonoids and erectile function.
Objective: This study examined the relation between habitual fla-
vonoid subclass intakes and incidence of ED.
Design: We conducted a prospective study among 25,096 men from
the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Total flavonoid and sub-
class intakes were calculated from food-frequency questionnaires
collected every 4 y. Participants rated their erectile function in
2000 (with historical reporting from 1986) and again in 2004 and
2008.
Results: During 10 y of follow-up, 35.6% reported incident ED.
After multivariate adjustment, including classic cardiovascular dis-
ease risk factors, several subclasses were associated with reduced
ED incidence, specifically flavones (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.97;
P-trend = 0.006), flavanones (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.95;
P-trend = 0.0009), and anthocyanins (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85,
0.98; P-trend = 0.002) comparing extreme intakes. The results remained
statistically significant after additional adjustment for a composite
dietary intake score. In analyses stratified by age, a higher intake of
flavanones, anthocyanins, and flavones was significantly associated
with a reduction in risk of ED only in men ,70 y old and not older
men (11–16% reduction in risk; P-interaction = 0.002, 0.03, and
0.007 for flavones, flavanones, and anthocyanins, respectively). In
food-based analysis, higher total intake of fruit, a major source of
anthocyanins and flavanones, was associated with a 14% reduction
in risk of ED (RR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.92; P = 0.002).
Conclusions: These data suggest that a higher habitual intake of
specific flavonoid-rich foods is associated with reduced ED incidence.
Intervention trials are needed to further examine the impact of increas-
ing intakes of commonly consumed flavonoid-rich foods on men’s
health.

INTRODUCTION
Erectile dysfunction (ED)7 has considerable impact on the
quality of life of middle-aged men and is a significant global
health problem with estimates of a 33–52% prevalence (1–3).
Although the origins of ED were thought to be psychogenic or
neuropathic, evidence now clearly suggests that the predominant
etiology is vascular (4–7). Therefore, ED shares risk factors,
including hypertension, obesity, and smoking, with cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) (3, 4, 8–10); occurrence rises with a pro-
gressive clustering of risk factors, and ED is an independent
predictor of CVD events (8, 11, 12).
Lifestyle modifications that target CVD risk factors will also
have the potential to improve ED, with data from a systematic
review of the available 6 randomized controlled trials dem-
onstrating beneficial effects of lifestyle interventions on erectile
function after follow-up of 2–24 mo (13). Specifically, they
showed that a healthy diet, increased physical activity, and
statin therapy were important components to improve men’s
sexual health. The specific role of dietary change was dem-
onstrated in a 2-y Mediterranean diet trial where a diet rich in
whole grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and olive oil was
associated with an improvement in erectile function in subjects
with metabolic syndrome (14). This intervention also resulted
in an improvement in endothelial function and a decrease in
C-reactive protein concentrations, which further highlights the
shared underlying mechanisms linking diet, inflammation,
vascular function, and ED. In men without established ath-
erosclerosis, those with ED also had poorer endothelial
function (15).
To date, few studies have examined the potential role of dietary
intake, and the limited available epidemiologic and intervention
trial data have predominantly focused on adherence to a Medi-
terranean diet (14, 16). This diet contains high concentrations of
flavonoids, bioactive constituents of foods that may explain some

 of the observed beneficial effects. Growing evidence supports an
improvement in endothelial function and blood pressure after
increased dietary flavonoid intake (17–23), suggesting that flavo-
noids might be more likely than other dietary factors to improve
erectile function. Flavonoids are present in many plant-based
foods/beverages, including fruit, vegetables, tea, herbs, and
wine, and exert anti-inflammatory effects, inhibit LDL oxidation
and endothelial NADPH oxidase, modulate endothelial nitric
oxide (NO) synthase activity, and augment NO status (17, 18,
22, 24–26).
To our knowledge, the association between different dietary
flavonoid subclasses present in plant-based foods on ED in-
cidence has not been investigated.
We therefore examined the relation of the 6 main subclasses
of flavonoids commonly consumed in the US diet—flavanones,
anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavonoid polymers, flavonols, and
flavones—with incidence of ED. We hypothesized, on the
strength of the available mechanistic and human trial data on
vascular function, that a high intake of anthocyanins, flavanones,
and flavan-3-ols would be associated with a reduction in the
incidence of ED.
METHODS
Subjects
The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) is a pro-
spective cohort study that commenced in 1986 with the re-
cruitment of 51,529 middle-aged male dentists, pharmacists,
optometrists, osteopath physicians, podiatrists, and veterinar-
ians (aged 40–75 y). Approximately 97% of participants were
of white European descent. Questionnaires were mailed to par-
ticipants at baseline and biennially to update exposure infor-
mation and to ascertain the self-report of newly diagnosed
diseases (94% response rate) (27). The HPFS was approved by
the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Institutional
Review Board.
Outcome assessment
On the 2000 questionnaire, HPFS participants were asked
to rate their ability (without treatment) to have and maintain
an erection sufficient for intercourse. Each question included
a time grid with year/month increments (before 1986, 1986–
1989, 1990–1994, 1995 or later, in the past 3 mo) to allow
participants to report historically when and if erectile function
changed. Participants were again asked to report their current
function (without treatment) in 2004 and 2008. Response op-
tions on the 5-point scale included very poor, poor, fair, good,
and very good. Only 25,096 men who at baseline in 1998 were
without prior diagnosis of ED; prostate, bladder, or testicular
cancer; or CVD were included in our analyses. Date of di-
agnosis was defined as the date of return of the 2000 ques-
tionnaire, and we censored at first report of ED. Participants
were subsequently censored during follow-up if they developed
prostate, bladder, or testicular cancer, and we stopped updating
dietary information if they developed CVD during follow-up.
Reports of poor or very poor erectile function in any of the
periods from 2000 to 2008 were considered incident cases of
ED.
Dietary assessment
Dietary intake data collected from HPFS participants in
1986 and subsequently every 4 y through 2010 were used to
calculate cumulative flavonoid subclass intakes. A database for
assessment of flavonoid subclass intakes was constructed
as previously described (19), which was compiled before
the release of the phenol-explorer database. Briefly, intakes
of individual compounds were calculated as the sum of the
consumption frequency of each food multiplied by the content
of the specific flavonoid for the specified portion size. We
derived intakes of the subclasses commonly consumed in the
US diet—specifically, flavanones, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols
(monomers), flavonols, flavones, and polymers/oligomers
(including proanthocyanidins, theaflavins, and thearubigins).
We did not evaluate isoflavone intakes because concentrations
are very low (,3 mg/d) in the habitual US diet (28), and from
a meta-analysis of soy isoflavone intervention studies, we
know that isoflavone intakes of 65–153 mg/d are required for
blood pressure–lowering effects in hypertensive subjects and
50–99 mg/d for effects on endothelial function (29, 30). Cu-
mulative intakes (energy adjusted) were calculated for a given
questionnaire cycle by averaging the intake for the current
and preceding food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs). The
validity and reproducibility of the FFQs have been reported
previously, and correlations between major dietary sources of
flavonoids (fruit, vegetables, tea, wine) measured by diet re-
cords and FFQs were 0.70, 0.50, 0.77, and 0.83 respectively
(31, 32). Our FFQ has not been specifically validated for
the intake of flavonoid subclasses, but in a recent study, the
sum of 7 flavonoid biomarkers measured in 24-h urine
samples was correlated with intakes of fruit and vegetables
(0.43–0.66) (33), correlations of a similar magnitude to our
validation studies.
Statistical methods
Participants contributed person-time of follow-up from the
date of return of the 2000 questionnaire to the date of first report
of ED or the end of follow-up (2010). Updating of dietary in-
formation ended at the time participants developed cancer (ex-
cept nonmelanoma skin cancer), coronary artery disease, angina,
or stroke (self-reported percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty/coronary artery bypass graft or myocardial infarc-
tion) during follow-up to avoid bias due to reverse causality
(34). We used a left-truncated Cox proportional hazard re-
gression for time-varying covariates, with a counting process
data structure and age in months as the time scale, stratifying
also on calendar year (35) to estimate the HR for flavonoid
subclass intake in relation to risk of ED by using the lowest
intake quintile as the referent group. Covariates were updated
biennially (36). We controlled for marital status (married, di-
vorced, separated, widowed, or never married), smoking (never,
past, or current 1–14, 15–24, $25 cigarettes/d), BMI (in kg/m2;
,24.9, 25–29.9, or $30), physical activity (metabolic equivalents/wk
in quintiles), alcohol consumption (0, 0.1–4.9, 5–14.9, 15–
29.9, or .30 g alcohol/d), use of multivitamin supplements
(yes/no), energy intake (kcal/d, in quintiles), history of hyper-
tension (yes/no), history of myocardial infarction (yes/no), his-
tory of hypercholesterolemia (yes/no), and history of diabetes
(yes/no).

 We conducted further analyses in which we also adjusted for
caffeine intake, as well as intake of caffeine/methylxanthine-
containing beverages (tea and coffee) and the alternative healthy
eating index (as an index of overall diet quality and adherence to
dietary guidelines). In other models, we examined the impact of the
addition of intakes of amino acids involved in vascular function, in-
cluding arginine, cysteine, and methionine, to the multivariate model.
In sensitivity analyses, we restricted analyses to healthy men
who had never had diabetes or CVD. To identify the impact of
risk factors that may modify the relation between flavonoid
subclass intake and ED, we examined the effect modification
among strata, including age, BMI, smoking, physical activity, and
statin use. We conducted food-based analyses on the main dietary
sources of the flavonoid subclasses that were associated with
a reduction in ED incidence to relate our findings to dietary
guidelines. We also examined the joint effects of flavonoid
subclasses associated with risk of ED (combined intakes of
anthocyanins and flavanones but not flavones because most
flavone intake is derived from the same dietary sources as fla-
vanones) with other risk factors including smoking and physical
activity. All analyses were conducted with SAS software, version
9 (SAS Institute, Inc.). All P values were 2-sided.
RESULTS
During 10 y of follow-up among the 25,096 participants,
35.6% reported incident ED. Baseline characteristics of the
participants according to quintiles of cumulative flavanone
intake in 2000 are shown in Table 1. Men with a higher fla-
vanone intake smoked less, exercised more, and consumed
less alcohol. The flavonoid polymer subclass contributed
most to total flavonoid intake (mean intake 207 mg/d; range:
68–442 mg/d), whereas intakes ranged from 3.3 to 35.9 mg/d
for anthocyanin and 13.6 to 102.5 mg/d for flavanones. After
adjusting for potential confounders, including classic CVD
risk factors and a range of lifestyle factors, participants in the
highest compared with the lowest quintile of several sub-
classes of flavonoids had a reduction in the incidence of ED,
specifically intakes of flavones (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85,
0.97; P-trend = 0.006), flavanones (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83,
0.95; P-trend = 0.0009), and anthocyanins (RR = 0.91; 95%
CI: 0.85, 0.98; P-trend = 0.002) (Table 2). The results
remained statistically significant when we added either caffeine
intake or intake of caffeine/methylxanthine-containing beverages
(tea and coffee) to the multivariate model—specifically, intakes
of flavones (addition of caffeine; flavones (RR: 0.91; 95%
CI: 0.85, 0.97; P-trend = 0.007), flavanones (RR = 0.89;

CI: 0.84, 0.97; P-trend = 0.002). The results also remained
statistically significant when we added alternative healthy eat-
ing index to the multivariate model—specifically, intakes of fla-
vones (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.94; P-trend = 0.0007),
flavanones (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94; P-trend = 0.0001),
and anthocyanins (RR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.95; P-trend =
0.0003). The addition of intakes of arginine, cysteine, or me-
thionine either individually or together to our multivariate
model did not materially alter the results (data not shown).

inverse association between intakes of flavones (RR = 0.91; 95% CI:
0.84, 0.99, P-trend = 0.04), flavanones (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83,

To confirm our findings and to relate the effects to public health
and dietary guidelines, we then conducted food-based analyses
for total fruit intake and the top 5 sources of anthocyanins,
flavones, and flavanones: strawberries, blueberries, red wine,
apples/pears, and citrus products. Total fruit intake was associ-
ated with a 14% reduction in risk of ED (RR = 0.86; 95%

although when we focused on the top sources contributing to the

observed a 19% reduction in risk of ED (RR = 0.81; 95%
CI: 0.64, 1.03; P , 0.008) (Figure 1). This inverse association

In stratified analyses (Table 3), we observed that the inverse
association of flavones, flavanones, and anthocyanins with ED
was stronger among men aged ,70 y compared with those aged
$70 y (P-interaction = 0.002, 0.03, and 0.007 for flavones,
flavanones, and anthocyanins, respectively). The inverse asso-
ciation between flavanones and ED was stronger among
overweight men compared with those who had a BMI ,25
(P-interaction = 0.009) (Table 3). We therefore also examined
the joint effects of age and BMI, and although we acknowledge
that incidence rates were higher in the older men, these analyses

 suggest that the greatest benefit from an increased intake of
flavonones, flavones, and anthocyanins is observed in the younger
overweight and obese men; for example, for flavanone intake,
comparing extreme quintiles of intakes, the relative risk of ED was
0.85 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.98) for participants aged ,70 y with
a BMI in the 25–29.9 range and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.77) in the
BMI $30 category. The inverse association was similar in smokers
and nonsmokers, across physical activity levels, and by statin use
(Table 3). In joint effect analysis, individuals who consumed a high
intake of anthocyanins and flavanones and who were physically
active had the lowest risk of ED compared with those consuming
a low intake of anthocyanins and flavanones and low physical
activity levels (RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.87; P-trend , 0.0001).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first observational study to
suggest that increased habitual intakes of several dietary flavo-
noids are associated with improved erectile function. Specifically,
during 10 y of follow-up and after adjustment for a number of
potential confounders, including classic CVD risk factors and
a range of lifestyle factors, men in the highest compared with the
lowest quintile of intakes of flavanones, flavones, and anthocy-
anins had a 9–11% reduced incidence of ED. This magnitude of
effect is similar to undertaking 7.7–16.5 metabolic equivalent
tasks per week of physical activity (37), which equates to ap-
proximately 2–5 h of brisk walking per week.
The projected worldwide prevalence of ED for 2025 has been
suggested to be .322 million men, with the largest projected
increases in the developing world (1). Our data strengthen the
knowledge that a healthy diet, specifically one rich in several
flavonoids, together with increased physical activity and main-
tenance of body weight are important components of health to
improve sexual health and CVD risk factor reduction. These
lifestyle modifications will likely provide benefit regardless of
use of current drug therapies, including phosphodiesterase type
5 inhibitors. Although the magnitude of the reduced risk of in-
creased flavonoid intake on erectile function was moderate (9–
11%), the potential benefits on improving erectile function could
be important at a population level. Interestingly, in our joint
analysis, we observed that individuals who consumed a high
intake of anthocyanins and flavanones and who were physically
active had a 21% lower risk of ED compared with those con-
suming a low intake of anthocyanins and flavanones and low
physical activity levels. In a 2-y intervention trial, in which
subjects were advised to achieve 10% weight loss through re-
duced energy intake and increased physical activity, a 4.0-point
improvement in the International Index of Erectile Function
(IIEF-5) score was observed (38). These data are supported by
prospective data, which found that the 10-y odds of ED was 2.0
comparing men with a BMI $28 with men with a BMI ,28 at
baseline (8), and previous data showed that the RR of ED for
obese men (BMI $30) was almost twice that of men with an
ideal BMI (,25) (RR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.6, 2.2). Together, these
data suggest that even a modest improvement in ED through
increased intake of flavonoid-rich foods combined with a mod-
erate increase in physical activity and other lifestyle factor
modifications will improve erectile function and offer an op-
portunity for early intervention for CVD prevention.
In nationally representative data from NHANES, .18 million
US men were estimated to have ED, with older men particularly
affected (39), and in our cohort, 37.9% reported incident ED
over a 10-y period. A 9–11% improvement in ED is important
from a public health perspective because ED is an early ba-
rometer of poor vascular function and offers a critical oppor-
tunity to intervene earlier for the prevention of CVD. The lag
time between the onset of ED and CVD presentation is 2–5 y
(40–42), and it has been shown to be an independent risk factor
for CVD mortality and morbidity (12, 43, 44). Men with ED are
likely to be highly motivated to adapt a healthy lifestyle, in-
cluding dietary approaches, to improve sexual health with re-
sulting benefits to cardiovascular health. In addition, men are
likely to recognize dysfunction in their sexual health early, in
contrast to risk factors for CVD, which are frequently identified
after much of the irreversible vascular damage has occurred.
To date, few studies have specifically examined the potential
role of dietary constituents on ED. Recently, a cross-sectional
study reported a 39% reduction in risk of ED with higher caffeine
intake (intake equivalent to 2–3 cups of coffee/d) (45), although
the relative importance of the polyphenol content of coffee was
not addressed. The addition of either caffeine intake or caffeine/
methylxanthine-containing beverages (tea and coffee) to our
model did not attenuate the relation, suggesting that the benefits
may be more likely related to the flavonoid content. The only
long-term trial observed a beneficial effect of adherence to
a Mediterranean diet (14, 46), the data for which are supported
by an observational study in men with type 2 diabetes (46). Of
the 65 men with metabolic syndrome who were enrolled and
followed up for 2 y, a 3-point improvement in the IIEF-5 score
was observed (range: 0.6–5.2) in those advised to follow
a Mediterranean-style diet (14). Several other trials have eval-
uated the impact of other lifestyle modifications, including
weight loss, exercise, or combined exercise and lifestyle change,
and a meta-analysis of the 4 lifestyle modification trials (ex-
cluding the 2 pharmacotherapy studies) demonstrated improve-
ments in sexual function. They observed a pooled improvement
of 2.4 points in the IIEF-5 score, which is consistent with
a relevant improvement in mild ED and a lesser improvement in
more advanced ED (13). A clinically important difference in the
erectile function domain is accepted to be a 4-point improve-
ment in IIEF-5 score, but the clinical importance of the differ-
ence varies substantially according to the degree of severity of
ED. For mild ED, a 2.0-point improvement in the IIEF-5 score
equates to a clinically important effect, whereas for moderate or
severe ED, a respective 5.0- or 7.0-point change in the score is
required for a clinical benefit (47). Interestingly, when we added
a modified Mediterranean diet score, appropriately adapted for
a US habitual diet (alternative healthy eating index), it did not
alter our observed inverse associations, providing evidence to
suggest the specific importance of high flavonoid intakes.
Penile erection is regulated by a dynamic balance between
vasodilator and vasoconstrictor tone, and lack of this homeostasis
leads to ED. Vasoconstriction is mediated mostly via RhoA/Rho-
kinase pathways, whereas the NO pathway is one of the main
vasodilator mediators involved in the functional control of
erectile function (48). Available data suggest that several
flavonoids can attenuate vascular contraction by inhibiting
RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathways from experiments using rat
aortic rings (49, 50) and population-based studies, and short-term

 trials support an effect for specific flavonoid subclasses, including
flavones, anthocyanins, flavanones, and flavan-3-ols, on vascular
function and NO in vivo (18–20, 22–26). Although NO has been
accepted as the pathway for mediating the vasorelaxant effects
of flavonoids, hydrogen sulfide has been identified as another
important physiologic regulator of erectile function via effects
on arterial relaxation and (51), and recent in vitro evidence
provides evidence to suggest that the hydrogen sulfide pathway
was key in mediating the relaxant effect of blueberry juice on rat
aortic tissue (52).
Few animal studies have examined the impact of flavonoid
ingestion on erectile function, but in one 8-wk study, the flavonol
quercetin at high doses (20 and 50 mg $ kg21 $ d21) ameliorated
ED in a diabetic rat model (53); we observed no inverse asso-
ciation for habitual flavonol intake (mean intake 18.4 mg/d).
Although habitual flavone intakes were low (mean intake 2.6
mg/d), we did observe a reduction in risk with increased intake,
and in an animal model, the flavone apigenin markedly in-
creased NO concentrations and evoked endothelium-dependent
vasorelaxation (54). We also hypothesized that increased flavan-
3-ol intake would reduce risk, given the wealth of mechanistic
support for this subclass, particularly in relation to effects on NO
metabolism and endothelial function (17, 20, 21). However, no
relation was apparent for habitual intake in this population. Our
meta-analysis of flavan-3-ol randomized controlled trials and
CVD risk biomarkers suggested that .50 mg epicatechin/d, one
of the main flavan-3-ol compounds, is required for beneficial
effects on blood pressure (21). By their very nature, FFQs
cannot capture all sources of flavonoids, and some sources of
flavan-3-ols may not have been accurately captured. For ex-
ample, dark chocolate, a major source of flavan-3-ols, was not
consumed regularly in the 1990s, and most FFQs of that era did
not assess different chocolate types. Furthermore, the exact
composition of flavan-3-ols in dark and milk chocolate de-
pends on the alkalization process during production (55).
The strengths of this study include the prospective design, the
large sample size with long-term follow-up, repeat measures of
dietary intake, detailed data on risk factors and confounders for
CVD risk, and an up-to-date database of the range of flavonoid
subclasses present in the habitual diet. The study also has
a number of limitations. Although we adjusted for a range of
potential confounders, there is still the possibility of residual or
unmeasured confounding from additional unmeasured factors.
However, given our detailed and updated adjustment for con-
founders, it is unlikely these would fully account for the observed
findings. Of all the flavonoid classes assessed, only anthocyanins,
flavanones, and flavones were associated with ED, suggesting
something specific about these subclasses. We used repeated
measurements and assessed cumulative intake of diet to more
accurately assess long-term flavonoid intake and reduce mea-
surement error. However, flavonoid content varies widely,
depending on growing conditions and manufacturing methods,
but despite these sources of variation, these data allow us to rank
order intakes, which allows comparisons between high and low
intakes in large population groups. There are currently a limited
range of validated biomarkers to integrate intake with the ex-
tensive metabolism these compounds undergo in vivo, so our
current knowledge base can only be derived from dietary intake.
Improvement in erectile function in men should therefore be
added to the growing list of clinical benefits brought about by
a healthy lifestyle, including increased intake of flavonoids. From
a public health perspective, ED provides an opportunity for early
intervention for the prevention of CVD and represents an op-
portunity for the early identification of risk factors that are
modifiable with lifestyle, particularly in middle-aged men. Our
data suggest that increased intake of specific flavonoid-rich foods
is associated with a reduced ED incidence, and intervention trials
are needed to further examine the potential impact of flavonoids
to improve men’s overall health.
