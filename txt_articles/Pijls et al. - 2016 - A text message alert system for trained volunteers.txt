 A  Text  Message
 (TM)  alert  system
 for  trained  volunteers
 in  the  community
 was  imple-
mented
 in
 the  Netherlands
 to  reduce  response
 times.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to
 assess
 if
 this
 system
improves
 survival  after  OHCA.
Methods
 and  Results:
 From  April  2012  to April  2014  data  on  all
 1546  emergency
 calls  for  OHCA  in the Dutch
province
 of  Limburg
 were
 collected
 according
 to the  Utstein  template.
 On  site  resuscitation
 attempts
for
 presumed
 cardiac  arrest  were
 made  in  833 cases,  of which
 the  TM-alert
 system
 was
 activated
 in
422
 cases.
 Two  cardiopulmonary
 resuscitation
 (CPR)  scenarios
 were  compared:
 1.  TM-alert
 system
 was
activated
 but  no  responders
 attended
 (n  =
 131),  and  2.  TM-alert  system
 was  activated
 with  attendance
 of
≥1
 responder(s)
 (n =
 291).  Survival
 to  hospital  discharge
 was  16.0%  in  scenario
 1  and  27.1%  in
 scenario
 2
corresponding
 with
 OR  =  1.95  (95%
 CI  1.15–3.33;
 P  =  .014).
 After  adjustment
 for  potential
 confounders
 the
odds
 ratio  increased
 (OR
 =  2.82;
 95%  CI 1.52–5.24;
 P  =  .001).  Of  the 100  survivors,
 92%  were
 discharged
from
 the  hospital
 to their  home
 with  no  or limited
 neurological
 sequelae.
Conclusion:
 The
 TM-alert  system
 is  effective
 in  increasing
 survival  to hospital
 discharge
 in
 OHCA  victims
and
 the  degree  of  disability
 or  dependence
 after survival
 is  low.

Introduction
Sudden
 out-of-hospital
 circulatory
 arrest
 (OHCA)
 is
 an
 impor-
tant
 public
 health
 problem,1,2 largely
 caused
 by
 cardiac
 disease.3
Survival
 rates
 are
 low4–6 (<10%)
 and
 increase
 by
 early
 notification
of
 Emergency
 Medical
 Systems
 (EMS)
 and
 early
 application
 of
 basic
life
 support
 and
 defibrillation.6
In
 50–70%
 of
 victims,
 their
 cardiac
 arrest
 occurs
 at
 home1 and
improving
 outcomes
 after
 OHCA
 requires
 new
 strategies.
 To
 coun-
teract
 delayed
 ambulance
 arrival
 times,
 first
 responder
 systems
were
 implemented
 in
 several
 countries.7,8 In

 Approval
 for
 the
 study
 was
 obtained
 from
 the
 medi-
cal
 ethics
 committee
 of
 the
 Maastricht
 University
 Medical
 Centre
(project
 number
 114029).
Resuscitation
 volunteer
 network
 in
 the
 study
 region
If
 EMS
 are
 called
 for
 (suspected)
 OHCA,
 the
 professional
 pro-
cedure
 throughout
 the
 Netherlands
 consists
 of
 dispatching
 two
ambulances
 to
 the
 scene.
 Each
 vehicle
 is
 manned
 by
 1
 paramedic
and
 a
 driver
 with
 CPR
 skills
 and
 equipped
 for
 providing
 advanced
life
 support.
 First
 responders
 (policemen)
 are
 notified
 only
 if
 they
are
 already
 in
 close
 range
 of
 the
 circulatory
 arrest
 case.
 To
 reduce
the
 delay
 in
 response
 time
 to
 start
 BLS,
 a
 network
 of
 BLS/AED
trained
 volunteers
 was
 developed.
 This
 network
 consists
 of
 TM-
volunteers
 and
 AEDs
 placed
 in
 residential
 areas.
 TM-volunteers
 are
notified
 by
 the
 dispatch
 centre,
 using
 the
 zip
 code
 derived
 loca-
tion
 of
 the
 victim
 and
 the
 TM-volunteers.
 In
 a
 suspected
 OHCA,
the
 dispatch
 centralist
 activates
 the
 system
 simultaneously
 with
the
 two
 ambulances.
 Zip
 code
 identified
 TM-volunteers
 within
 a
radius
 of
 1
 km
 (0.62
 mi)
 of
 the
 victim
 receive
 a
 TM,
 directing
 them
to
 the
 scene
 to
 either
 start
 BLS
 (1/3
 of
 notifications)
 or
 to
 get
 a
 near-
est
 network
 AED
 first
 (2/3).
 During
 the
 study
 period
 the
 network
comprised
 17
 of
 the
 24
 Dutch
 dispatch
 centres
 and
 61.000
 TM-
volunteers,
 including
 two
 dispatch
 centres
 and
 >9000
 volunteers
(8.3/1000
 inhabitants)
 in
 Limburg.
Notification
 of
 TM-volunteers
 does
 not
 result
 in
 a
 predictable
response,
 because
 this
 depends
 on
 the
 number
 of
 TM-volunteers
in
 the
 specific
 zip
 code
 area
 and
 their
 availability.
 The
 dispatcher
 is
not
 aware
 of
 actual
 attendance
 of
 volunteers.
To
 analyse
 the
 effect
 of
 attending
 TM-volunteers,
 two
 different
resuscitation
 scenarios
 were
 compared.
 In
 scenario
 1
 the
 TM-alert
system
 was
 activated
 but
 no
 TM-volunteers
 responded
 to
 the
notification.
 This
 unwanted
 situation
 will
 improve
 with
 further
implementation
 of
 the
 system,
 but
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 our
 study
these
 cases
 were
 considered
 as
 the
 reference
 group
 because
 sur-
vival
 of
 the
 OHCA
 victims
 depended
 on
 standard
 care.
 In
 scenario
 2
the
 TM-alert
 system
 was
 activated
 and
 at
 least
 one
 TM-volunteer
responded
 to
 the
 notification.
The
 primary
 outcome
 measure
 was
 the
 proportion
 of
 OHCA
victims
 who
 survived
 to
 hospital
 discharge.
 Secondary
 outcome
measures
 were
 proportion
 with
 return
 of
 spontaneous
 circula-
tion
 (ROSC)
 at
 departure
 from
 site
 of
 the
 OHCA
 and
 at
 hospital
arrival,
 proportion
 with
 discharge
 to
 rehabilitation
 centre
 and
 nurs-
ing/caring
 home
 and
 Modified
 Rankin
 score12 (mRS)
 at
 discharge.
Data
 collection
Data
 were
 retrieved
 from
 the
 following
 sources:
 1.
 the
 dispatch
centres
 from
 Limburg
 North
 and
 South,
 2.
 their
 respective
 emer-
gency
 medical
 services,
 3.
 notified
 volunteers,
 4.
 TM-alert
 database
(HartslagNu®),
 5.
 the
 six
 hospitals
 in
 Limburg,
 and
 6.
 AED
 providers.
On
 a
 daily
 basis,
 all
 emergency
 calls
 in
 the
 dispatch
 centre
 sys-
tem
 were
 screened
 for
 suspected
 OHCAs.
 Data
 collected
 consisted
of
 notification
 time,
 ambulance
 departure
 time
 and
 arrival
 time
at
 the
 location,
 departure
 time
 to
 and
 arrival
 time
 at
 the
 hospital,
patient’s
 condition
 and
 treatment.
 Information
 was
 also
 obtained
from
 the
 paramedics
 notes
 on
 the
 resuscitation
 scenario.
 The
TM-alert
 system
 organisation
 provided
 information
 about
 the
 acti-
vation
 of
 the
 TM-alert
 system,
 such
 as
 the
 time
 the
 TM
 was
 sent,
the
 number
 of
 notified
 TM-volunteers
 and
 AEDs,
 and
 type
 of
 noti-
fication
 (start
 BLS
 or
 first
 get
 an
 AED).
All
 notified
 TM-volunteers
 received
 a
 questionnaire
 gathering
information
 about
 their
 attendance
 and
 if
 applicable
 about
 details
of
 the
 CPR
 scenario.
 Information
 included
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 witness
and
 the
 start
 of
 CPR
 by
 the
 witness
 or
 by
 a
 bystander.
 Importantly,
a
 witness
 was
 defined
 as
 the
 one
 who
 saw,
 heard
 or
 monitored
 the
arrest
 whereas
 the
 term
 bystander
 was
 reserved
 for
 those
 who
 did
not
 witness
 the
 event
 but
 arrived
 the
 scene
 as
 well
 (e.g.
 a
 neigh-
bour
 alarmed
 by
 the
 witness).
 Also
 recorded
 was
 if
 and
 how
 many
TM-volunteers
 reached
 the
 scene.
 From
 the
 six
 hospitals
 receiving
the
 victims,
 information
 was
 gathered
 about
 the
 post
 resuscitation
treatment,
 outcome
 and
 discharge
 date,
 and
 if
 applicable,
 the
 medi-
cal
 history
 before
 OHCA.
 To
 acquire
 information
 about
 the
 quality
 of
survival,
 discharge
 to
 the
 patients
 home,
 to
 a
 rehabilitation
 centre
or
 to
 a
 nursing/caring
 facility
 was
 used
 as
 an
 indicator
 for
 cerebral
outcome.
 Additionally,
 in
 one
 hospital
 (Maastricht)
 the
 Modified
Rankin
 Scale12 was
 used
 to
 determine
 the
 degree
 of
 disability
 at
hospital
 discharge.
 The
 scores
 were
 derived
 from
 chart
 review.
 AED
recordings
 were
 retrieved
 from
 the
 TM-alert
 system
 organisation
or
 from
 private
 AED
 providers.
Statistical
 analysis
Patients
 with
 OHCA
 were
 categorised
 into
 two
 groups
 according
to
 the
 corresponding
 CPR
 scenario.
 The
 distribution
 of
 age,
 gen-
der,
 witnessed
 OHCA
 and
 other
 potential
 determinants
 of
 survival
at
 hospital
 discharge
 were
 compared
 between
 the
 two
 CPR
 sce-
narios.
 Categorical
 variables
 were
 described
 as
 absolute
 numbers
and
 percentages,
 and
 continuous
 variables
 as
 means
 with
 standard
deviation
 or
 medians
 with
 interquartile
 range.
 The
 Chi
 square
 test
was
 used
 to
 test
 for
 statistically
 significant
 differences
 between
proportions.
 The
 t-test
 for
 independent
 samples
 or
 the
 Mann
 Whit-
ney
 U-test
 was
 used
 for
 continuous
 variables.
To
 assess
 whether
 mobilisation
 of
 TM-volunteers
 improved
probability
 of
 survival,
 odds
 ratios
 as
 a
 measure
 of
 relative
 risk
 with
95%
 confidence
 interval
 (95%
 CI)
 were
 calculated
 using
 scenario
 1
 as
reference
 category.
 Multivariable
 logistic
 regression
 analyses
 were
performed
 to
 assess
 the
 contribution
 to
 survival
 of
 scenario
 2
 with
adjustment
 for
 between
 group
 differences
 in
 potential
 determi-
nants
 of
 probability
 of
 survival.
 A
 P-value
 of
 ≤0.05
 was
 considered
as
 statistically
 significant.
 The
 statistical
 software
 package
 of
 SPSS
(SPSS
 for
 Windows,
 version
 22.0,
 SPSS
 Inc,
 Chicago,
 IL)
 was
 used
 to
analyse
 the
 data.
Results
Fig.
 1
 depicts
 the
 flow
 chart
 of
 the
 study
 population.
 Out
 of
 a
 total
of
 1546
 OHCA
 EMS
 notifications
 during
 the
 24
 months
 study
 period,
1040
 resuscitation
 attempts
 were
 recorded.
 The
 group
 of
 506
cases
 without
 a
 resuscitation
 attempt
 consisted
 of
 461
 cases
 being
pronounced
 dead
 on
 arrival
 of
 the
 EMS
 and
 45
 with
 a
 “do
 not
 resus-
citate”
 statement.
 Arrests
 within
 the
 ambulance
 were
 excluded
 and
occurred
 in
 31
 instances.
 Another
 5
 cases
 were
 excluded,
 because
they
 were,
 after
 sufficient
 recovery,
 discharged
 to
 a
 hospital
 outside
the
 Netherlands
 and
 no
 information
 on
 outcome
 could
 be
 acquired.
Because
 the
 purpose
 of
 this
 study
 was
 to
 evaluate
 the
 effect
 of
the
 TM-system
 on
 arrests
 with
 a
 cardiac
 origin,
 171
 arrests
 with
a
 non-cardiac
 origin
 were
 excluded.
 In
 411
 (49.3%)
 cases
 the
 dis-
patch
 centre
 decided
 not
 to
 activate
 the
 system
 mostly
 because
 the
ambulance
 was
 already
 nearby
 or
 present
 at
 the
 scene,
 or
 the
 OHCA
occurred
 in
 a
 (closed)
 public
 place
 with
 an
 on-site
 AED
 (such
 as
shopping
 malls,
 sport
 venues
 etc.)
 These
 cases
 were
 excluded
 from
the
 analysis.
 Hence,
 the
 total
 study
 population
 consisted
 of
 422
(presumed)
 cardiac
 arrests
 in
 which
 the
 TM-alert
 system
 was
 acti-
vated.
 In
 291
 cases
 (69%)
 ≥1
 TM-volunteers
 attended
 (scenario
 2),
and
 in
 131
 cases
 (31%)
 no
 responder
 attended
 (scenario
 1,
 reference
group).
Baseline
 characteristics
The
 mean
 age
 of
 these
 422
 OHCA
 victims
 was
 68.1
 years
 and
71.6%
 were
 male.

variables
 among
 the
 two
 scenarios.
 Study
 groups
 were
 comparable
regarding
 most
 variables,
 but
 significant
 differences
 were
 observed
with
 respect
 to
 initial
 rhythm
 and
 the
 person
 who
 started
 BLS.
 In
scenario
 2,
 BLS
 was
 less
 often
 started
 by
 a
 witness
 (35.8%
 vs
 41.5%)
and
 more
 often
 by
 other
 parties.
 In
 scenario
 2,
 a
 TM-volunteer
started
 BLS
 in
 24.7%.
 Patients
 in
 scenario
 2
 were
 more
 likely
 to
have

 initial
 rhythm
 compared
 to
 the
 patients
 in
 sce-
nario
 1
 (59.9%
 vs.
 46.5%;
 P

 .011).
 Although
 differences
 were
 not
statistically
 significant,
 patients
 in
 scenario
 2
 were
 slightly
 older
than
 patients
 in
 scenario
 1
 and
 the
 ambulance
 arrived
 more
 often
after
 8
 min
 (50.9%
 vs
 43.3%).
 The
 lack
 of
 difference
 in

times
 between
 the

 suggests
 equal
 accu-
rateness
 in
 both
 scenarios
 in
 identifying
 OHCAs
 by
 the

centralist.
Contribution
 of
 TM-responders
 to
 survival
Survival
 to

 discharge
 of
 27.1%
 (79/291)
 in

 2
was
 significantly
 higher
 compared
 to
 16.0%

 in

 1.
 In
 total,
 100
 of
 the
 422

 (23.7%)
 were
 discharged
alive
 from
 the
 hospital.
 Percentages
 with

 was
 higher
 in

Discussion
Main
 findings
This
 is
 a
 population
 based
 survey,
 performed
 in
 a
 well-defined
area
 in
 the
 Netherlands,
 including
 all
 consecutive
 resuscitations
 of
OHCA
 cases
 during
 a
 2
 year
 period,
 studying
 the
 contribution
 of
 a
novel
 citizen
 responder
 system
 (Table
 1).
 Results
 showed
 improved
outcomes
 in
 survival
 to
 hospital
 discharge
 when
 1
 or
 more
 TM-
volunteers
 responded
 with
 27.1%
 survival
 (79/291)
 compared
 to
16.0%
 (21/131)
 in
 case
 no
 volunteer
 responded
 (P
 =
 .001).
After
 correction
 for
 differences
 in
 the
 distribution
 of
 other
 deter-
minants
 of
 survival,
 the
 adjusted
 relative
 risk
 estimate
 of
 survival
at
 hospital
 discharge
 in
 scenario
 2
 was
 2.82
 (95%
 CI
 1.52–5.24;
P
 =
 .001)
 compared
 to
 scenario
 1
 (Table
 3).
 Survivors
 had
 a
 low
degree
 of
 disability
 or
 dependence,
 as
 suggested
 by
 the
 low
 refer-
ral
 rate
 to
 rehabilitation
 or
 nursing
 centres
 (8%)
 and
 accordingly
low
 scores
 in
 the
 majority
 of
 survivors
 with
 an
 available
 Modified
Rankin
 score.
Study
 population
 and
 the
 TM-alert
 system
Our
 study
 group
 consists
 of
 consecutive
 cases
 from
 the
 general
population.
 The
 TM-alert
 system
 was
 activated
 in
 50.7%
 of
 resusci-
tations
 for
 OHCA
 with
 a
 (presumed)
 cardiac
 cause.
 In
 about
 one
third
 of
 these
 cases,
 no
 volunteer
 responded,
 either
 due
 to
 the
absence
 or
 non-availability
 of
 volunteers
 in
 the
 zip
 code
 area
 of
 the
victim.
 With
 further
 implementation
 of
 the
 system
 the
 number
 of
citizen
 volunteers
 will
 increase,
 with
 expectedly
 higher
 attendance
rates.
 Where
 we  studied
 the
 system
 comprising
 61.000
 volunteers,
at
 the
 moment
 of
 this
 writing
 the
 TM-alert
 system
 studied
 contains
already
 more
 than
 91.000
 rescuers.
 The
 fact
 that
 during
 the
 study
period
 no
 volunteer
 attended
 in
 a
 substantial
 number
 of
 cases
 pro-
vided
 us
 with
 the
 opportunity
 to
 handle
 these
 cases
 (scenario
 1)
 as
a
 reference
 group,
 because
 they
 were
 derived
 from
 the
 same
 popu-
lation
 as
 the
 group
 where
 volunteers
 attended
 (scenario
 2)
 but
 had
to
 depend
 on
 standard
 care.

 (2016)
 182–187
Our
 findings
 suggest
 that
 the
 lay
 rescuer
 system
 substantially
attributed
 to
 different
 links
 in
 the
 chain
 of
 survival:
 1.
 In
 24.7%
of
 the
 291
 cases
 where
 TM-responders
 did
 arrive
 on
 the
 scene,
they
 were
 the
 first
 to
 start
 BLS
 and
 in
 26.8%
 they
 were
 the
 first
to
 connect
 an
 AED.
 The
 higher
 survival
 rate
 in
 scenario
 2
 com-
pared
 to
 scenario
 1
 suggests
 that
 the
 TM-alert
 system
 is
 successful
in
 decreasing
 response
 time.
 2.
 The
 observation
 that
 the
 initially
recorded
 rhythm
 was
 more
 often
 shockable
 in
 scenario
 2
 compared
to
 scenario
 1
 (59.9%
 vs
 46.5%,
 P
 =
 .015),
 is
 probably
 also
 related
 to
 the
shorter
 arrival
 times
 and
 adequate
 BLS.
 3.
 The
 probability
 to
 arrive
at
 the
 hospital
 alive
 was
 higher
 in
 the
 study
 arm
 with
 ≥
 1
 respon-
ders
 (47.9%
 vs
 30.8%).
 Moreover
 this
 difference
 not
 only
 persisted
but
 further
 increased
 as
 reflected
 by
 higher
 survival
 at
 hospi-
tal
 discharge,
 suggesting
 a
 better
 medical
 condition
 at
 hospital
arrival.
Other
 factors
 contributing
 to
 survival
Like
 in
 comparable
 studies
 regarding
 survival
 of
 OHCA,
 multi-
variable
 logistic
 regression
 analysis
 suggested
 that
 higher
 age
 was
associated
 with
 worse
 survival
 whereas
 male
 sex,
 particularly
 wit-
nessed
 OHCA,
 BLS
 started
 by
 a
 witness
 and
 a
 short
 arrival
 time
 of
the
 first
 ambulance
 were
 associated
 with
 better
 survival
 (Table
 3).
Quality
 of
 survival
The
 low
 degree
 of
 disability
 of
 survivors
 in
 our
 study
 population
is
 in
 agreement
 with
 recent
 studies
 by
 Moulaert
 et
 al.
 in
 the
 same
geographical
 area.
 Here
 it
 was
 found
 that
 almost
 80%
 of
 the
 patients
experience
 high
 quality
 of
 life13 and
 that
 70%
 of
 employed
 patients
returned
 to
 work
 within
 12
 months
 after
 discharge.14
Comparison
 with
 other
 community
 responder
 systems
In
 different
 countries
 different
 strategies
 exist
 to
 involve
 citizen
volunteers
 for
 improving
 survival
 of
 OHCA.15,16 To
 our
 knowledge,
however,
 no
 data
 on
 their
 contribution
 to
 survival
 have
 been
 pub-
lished
 thus
 far.
The
 Dutch
 TM-alert
 system
 was
 recently
 evaluated
 in
 two
 other
regions,
 but
 this
 research
 was
 focused
 on
 the
 use
 of
 AEDs
 and
 no
survival
 data
 were
 reported.17
Limitations
The
 design
 of
 the
 study
 was
 observational.
 More
 formal
 proof
of
 the
 effect
 of
 the
 TM-alert
 system
 would
 require
 a
 (randomised)
controlled
 study
 design.
 Such
 an
 approach
 is
 impossible,
 given
 the
already
 widespread
 implementation
 of
 the
 system.
 Exact
 informa-
tion
 on
 neurological
 outcome
 was
 not
 available
 due
 to
 practical
limitations.
 However
 92%
 of
 the
 surviving
 patients
 were
 discharged
home
 and
 assessment
 of
 scores
 on
 the
 Modified
 Rankin
 Scale
 in
 one
hospital
 provided
 good
 functional
 outcomes,
 in
 agreement
 with
results
 from
 previous
 research
 in
 the
 same
 region13,14 and
 else-
where
 in
 the
 Netherlands.18,19
Five
 foreign
 patients
 were
 excluded,
 because
 they
 were,
 after
sufficient
 recovery
 within
 the
 local
 hospital
 in
 Limburg,
 transferred
to
 a
 hospital
 outside
 the
 Netherlands.
 They
 therefore
 likely
 sur-
vived,
 but
 their
 survival
 status
 could
 not
 be
 confirmed.
Although
 we
 tried
 to
 obtain
 accurate
 information
 from
 the
 noti-
fied
 TM-volunteers
 by
 use
 of
 a
 questionnaire,
 it
 was
 practically
impossible,
 due
 to
 the
 rapidly
 changing
 nature
 of
 a
 resuscitation
setting,
 to
 retrieve
 exact
 numbers
 of
 TM-responders
 and
 their
arrival
 times
 at
 the
 location.
 Therefore,
 the
 reduction
 in
 response
times
 could
 not
 be
 quantified.
Conclusion
The
 TM-alert
 system
 has
 shown
 to
 be
 effective
 in
 increasing
 sur-
vival
 to
 hospital
 discharge
 in
 OHCA
 victims.
 About
 90%
 of
 survivors
went
 home
 after
 hospital
 discharge.
 Further
 improvement
 in
 sur-
vival
 will
 likely
 be
 achieved
 by
 a
 higher
 density
 and
 availability
 of
citizen
 rescuers.
