SUMMARY
The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5
(IRF-5) plays an important function in innate immu-
nity and in initiating pro-inflammatory responses
against pathogens. IRF-5 is constitutively expressed
in several cell types, including plasmacytoid den-
dritic cells, monocytes, and B cells. We have previ-
ously reported that IRF-5 is also expressed in
T cells during infection. The role of IRF-5 in T cells
is yet unknown. Here, we demonstrate that IRF-5 is
increasingly expressed in interferon (IFN)-g+ CD4
T cells over the course of L. donovani infection.
This transcription factor is induced by apoptotic ma-
terial via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and promotes the
expression of death receptor 5 (DR5). IRF-5 activa-
tion sensitizes CD4 T cells to cell death. Because
tissue disruption and chronic inflammation are com-
mon characteristics of persistent infections, activa-
tion of IRF-5 in CD4 T cells may represent a common
pathway that leads to suppression of protective CD4
T cell responses, favoring the establishment of
chronic infection.
INTRODUCTION
The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)
has been implicated in the antiviral immune response because
of its involvement in the transcriptional activation of both type I
interferon (IFN) genes and genes encoding key pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines in antigen-presenting cells (Barnes et al., 2001,
2004; Takaoka et al., 2005). Besides its important role in innate
immunity, IRF-5 also appears to be a critical regulator of DNA-
damage-induced apoptosis and tumor suppression (Bi et al.,
2014; Couzinet et al., 2008). In human, various IRF5 polymor-
phisms are also linked to autoimmune diseases, including lupus
erythematosus (Graham et al., 2006), rheumatoid arthritis (Die-
guez-Gonzalez et al., 2008), and inflammatory bowel disease
(Dideberg et al., 2007). IRF-5 is constitutively expressed by
several cell types, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, mono-
cytes, and B cells. Activation of IRF-5 occurs after phosphory-
lation, following which this transcription factor delocalizes from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus. IRF-5 can be activated by Toll-
like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 via the MyD88 signaling
pathway, directly by viral infections and type I IFN (Schoene-
meyer et al., 2005), or by apoptotic and/or necrotic material
(Stone et al., 2012).
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a potentially lethal chronic dis-
ease that causes hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, cachexia, hy-
pergammaglobulinemia, and immunosuppression (Kaye et al.,
2004). Mice infected with the protozoan parasite Leishmania
donovani, a causative agent of VL, also develop hepatosple-
nomegaly (Kaye et al., 2004). Although infection in the liver
is self-resolving, the parasite persists in the spleen of infected
mice. Chronic infection in the spleen is associated with
disruption of the splenic architecture and massive recruitment
of pro-inflammatory cells. IFN-g-producing CD4 T cell re-
sponses are essential for controlling parasite growth but
only develop 2 to 3 weeks after infection and gradually
show signs of functional exhaustion soon thereafter. CD8
T cells also contribute to protection; however, these cells un-
dergo very limited expansion and become dysfunctional dur-
ing chronic infection (Hammami et al., 2015; Joshi et al.,
2009). Protective T cell responses are also suppressed by
interleukin-10 (IL-10) derived from IFN-g+IL-10+ CD4 T cells
(Ranatunga et al., 2009; Sta
¨ ger et al., 2006) and B cells (Bank-
oti et al., 2012) and by myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(Hammami et al., 2017).
We have previously reported that Irf5�/� mice are more sus-
ceptible to L. donovani infection. Susceptibility was associated
with a significant reduction of inflammatory cell infiltration in
the liver and spleen and with a severe impairment in the develop-
ment of Th1 cells (Hammami et al., 2015; Paun et al., 2011). IRF-5
was indeed required for inducing IL-12 production by dendritic
cells and sustaining Th1 responses. Our results were in agree-
ment with Krausgruber et al. (2011), who demonstrated the crit-
ical role of this transcription factor in determining lineage
commitment of inflammatory macrophages by promoting IL-12
while repressing IL-10. Interestingly, we noticed that IRF-5
mRNA was also upregulated in total splenic T cells mainly during
chronic infection (Paun et al., 2011). The role of IRF-5 in T cells is
yet unknown.
Here, we show that IRF-5 is upregulated and activated in CD4
T cells during chronic VL. This transcription factor is induced by
TLR7 triggering. IRF-5 activation results in the upregulation of
death receptor 5 (DR5) and, ultimately, in CD4 T cell death.

 RESULTS
IRF-5 Is Activated in Splenic CD4 T Cells during
Chronic VL
We have previously reported that IRF-5 mRNA is expressed in
splenic T cells in L. donovani-infected mice (Paun et al., 2011).
Because effector CD8 T cells are not functional (Hammami
et al., 2015; Joshi et al., 2009) and do not express IRF-5 during
chronic VL (data not shown), we decided to concentrate our
analysis on CD4 T cells. Splenic CD4 T cells upregulated IRF-5
mRNA from day 21 (d21) post infection (p.i.) on (Figure 1A).
Image Stream flow cytometry analysis revealed that about
5%–12% of splenic CD4 T cells expressed IRF-5 on the protein
level (Figure 1B) and that this transcription factor was increas-
ingly translocated to the nucleus over the course of infection
(Figures 1C, 1G [upper rows], S1A, and S1B), indicating that it
was activated. Although a significant percentage of CD4
T cells expressed IRF-5 in the liver (Figures 1D and 1E), this tran-
scription factor remained in the cytoplasm and was not translo-
cated to the nucleus (Figures 1F, 1G [lower rows], S1A, and S1B).
Next, we wanted to identify splenic CD4 T cell subpopulations
expressing IRF-5. As shown in Figure 1H, effector and memory
cells, but not naive CD4 T cells, were positive for IRF-5 during
chronic VL (Figure S1C). A closer analysis of subpopulations ex-
pressing IRF-5 revealed that 40%–50% of IFN-g-producing CD4
T cells were expressing this transcription factor at d21 and d28
p.i. (Figure 1I). Hence, IRF-5 appears to be active in splenic,
but not hepatic, IFN-g-producing CD4 T cells during chronic
L. donovani infection.
Cell-Specific IRF-5 Ablation in T Cells Results in Higher
Frequencies of IFN-g-Producing CD4 T Cells during VL
To better characterize the function of IRF-5 in CD4 T cells, we
generated T-cell-specific Irf5�/� mice. We first compared the
frequency of CD4 T cells and T cell precursors in the thymus of
naive Irf5flox/flox-Cre+ (IRF-5 deficient) to that of Cre� (IRF-5 suf-
ficient) littermate controls to ensure that the absence of IRF-5 did
not alter T cell development. The percentage of various precur-
sors and of CD4 T cells present in the thymus was comparable
in both groups of mice (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B), as was the
frequency of CD4 T cells in the spleen (Figures 2B and S2C).
This confirmed that T cell development was normal in our
T-cell-specific IRF-5-deficient mice and that we could use these
mice to investigate IRF-5 function in T cells during VL. Because
total Irf5�/� mice develop defective Th1 responses following
L. donovani infection (Paun et al., 2011), we sought to determine
whether this transcription factor was required for IFN-g produc-
tion by CD4 T cells. Hence, we stimulated naive CD4 T cells from
Cre+ and Cre� mice with anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of re-
combinant IL-12 and monitored IFN-g production. The absence
of IRF-5 did not seem to affect the differentiation into IFN-g-pro-
ducing Th1 cells (Figure 2C), suggesting that defective Th1 re-
sponses in L. donovani-infected total Irf5�/� mice was more a

 consequence of antigen-presenting cell (APC) malfunction
rather than an intrinsic T cell effect, in agreement with Kraus-
gruber et al. (2011).
We then infected Cre+ and Cre� mice with L. donovani and
monitored CD4 T cell responses over the course of infection.
Interestingly, similar frequencies of splenic IFN-g+ CD4 T cells
were detected in both groups of mice at d14 p.i.; however, at
d21 and d28 p.i., IFN-g-producing CD4 T cells were significantly
more abundant in the spleen of T-cell-specific Irf5�/� mice (Fig-
ures 2D and S2D). We next investigated whether this increase
was a consequence of fewer CD4 T cells becoming exhausted
during chronic VL. The frequency of exhausted PD-1+ TIM3+
CD4 T cells did not vary between both groups of infected mice
(Figure 2E). To rule out the possibility that IRF-5 was affecting
the survival of regulatory T cells and that this had an indirect
impact on the frequencies of IFN-g+ CD4 T cells, we examined
Tr1 and Tregs responses. No differences were observed in the
percentage of IFN-g+ IL-10+ Tr1 cells (Sta
¨ ger et al., 2006; Fig-
ure 2F) or Foxp3+ CD4 T cells (Figures 2G and S2D), concurring
with our previous observation that IRF-5 was mainly active in
IFN-g+ CD4 T cells. Overall, these results indicate that IRF-5
may be involved in regulating the survival of IFN-g+ CD4 T cells.
Because Th1 responses are required to control parasite
growth (Bankoti and Sta
¨ ger, 2012), it was not surprising that
Cre+ mice displayed a significantly lower splenic and hepatic
parasite burden (Figure 2H).
TLR7 Is Required to Induce IRF-5 in CD4 T Cells
during VL
In the following experiment, we wanted to identify which
pathway was responsible for IRF-5 upregulation in IFN-g+
CD4 T cells to better understand the role this transcription fac-
tor might have in these cells. IRF-5 can be induced, among
others, by IFN-I and TLR7. IFN-I is upregulated during chronic
VL (Silva-Barrios et al., 2016), and TLR7 can be triggered by
the parasite (Paun et al., 2011; Silva-Barrios et al., 2016).
Hence, we performed adoptive transfer experiments using
Ifnar�/� and Tlr7�/� CD4 T cells and monitored the expression
of IRF-5 in endogenous and adoptively transferred cells
during the course of L. donovani infection. When we transferred
Ifnar�/� CD4 T cells into congenic mice, we noticed that IRF-5
was upregulated (Figure 3A) and translocated (Figure 3B)
at similar levels as endogenous wild-type (WT) CD4 T cells.
Moreover, no differences were observed in the percentage of

(Figure 3C). In contrast, adoptively transferred Tlr7�/� CD4
T cells failed to upregulate IRF-5 (Figure 3D), suggesting that
TLR7 is upstream of IRF-5 in CD4 T cells. Similarly to Irf5�/�
cells (Figure 2D), significantly more Tlr7�/� CD4 T cells ex-
pressed IFN-g at d28 p.i. (Figure 3E).
TLR7-Induced IRF-5 Promotes the Upregulation of DR5
and Induces Cell Death in CD4 T Cells from L. donovani-
Infected Mice
Several studies have reported the expression of various TLRs,
including TLR7, on murine T cell subsets (Caramalho et al.,
2003; Fukata et al., 2008; Gelman et al., 2004; Tomita et al.,
2008). To better identify the role of TLR7 in inducing IRF-5, we first
assessed its expression on CD4 T cells over the course of
L. donovani infection. The expression kinetics of TLR7 mRNA
was similar to the one observed for IRF-5: at d14 p.i., it was ex-

pressed at similar levels as in CD4
T cells from naive mice; however, by d21
and d28 p.i., CD4 T cells from infected
mice significantly upregulated TLR7 (Fig-
ure 4A). We next investigated whether
TLR7 was responsible for IRF-5 induction
in CD4 T cells during VL. CD4 T cells were
purified from the spleen of L. donovani-in-
fected mice at d14, d21, and d28 p.i. and
treated in vitro with the TLR7 agonist imi-
quimod (IMQ). IRF-5 mRNA expression
was evaluated 24 and 30 hr after stimula-
tion (Figure 4B). As expected, treatment
with IMQ did not induce IRF-5 in CD4
T cells purified from the spleen at d14
p.i., because the cells do not yet express
TLR7 (Figure 4B). In contrast, when we
stimulated cells enriched at d21 and d28
p.i., we saw an upregulation of IRF-5 at
24 and 30 hr post-treatment (Figure 4B).
When we perform adoptive transfer experiments using CD4
T cells, we notice that a large percentage of adoptively trans-
ferred wild-type CD4 T cells downregulates CD4 (Figure 4C).
About 70% (at d21) and 50% (at d28) of the adoptively trans-
ferred CD4 T cells present in the spleen are CD4lo/neg. Most of
these cells also downregulated CD3 (Figure S3A), and about
30% of the cells were DR5 and annexin V positive (Figures
S3B and S3C). Interestingly, the majority of the CD4lo/neg
T cells upregulated B220 (Figure S3D), a marker that has been
associated with pre-apoptotic stages in T cells (Oka et al.,
2000; Park et al., 2002; Renno et al., 1998).
Surprisingly, adoptive transfer of Tlr7�/� or Irf5�/� CD4 T cells
does not lead to the same results and only a small percentage of
cells downregulate CD4 at d21 and d28 p.i. (Figure 4C).
IRF-5 has been described to transcriptionally regulate death
receptor 5 (DR5 or TRAIL receptor 2) in human colorectal carci-
noma cell lines, sensitizing cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis

 (Hu and Barnes, 2009). Thus, we were wondering whether DR5
and cell death were also promoted following TLR7 stimulation
of CD4 T cells. We first assessed whether DR5 was expressed
on CD4 T cells during VL, and we noticed that this molecule
was upregulated on CD4 T cells from d21 p.i. on (Figures 4D
and S4A). We also monitored the expression of Fas receptor
(FasR), another known IRF-5 target (Hu and Barnes, 2009), on
CD4 T cells from L. donovani-infected Irf5flox/flox-Cre+ and Cre�
mice. No differences were observed between Cre+ and Cre�
mice (Figures 4E and S4B). Similar results were obtained when
we assessed tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-I (TNFR-I)
expression (Figures 4F, S4C, and S4D), suggesting that DR5,
but not FasR or TNFR-I, may possibly be a target of IRF-5 in
CD4 T cells.
Indeed, DR5 was also upregulated on CD4 T cells purified at
d21 and d28 p.i., but not on those from d14 p.i. following TLR7
stimulation with IMQ (Figure 4G), implying that the TLR7-IRF-5-
DR5 pathway could predispose CD4 T cells to cell death.
Hence, we monitored the expression of annexin V on CD4
T cells in L. donovani-infected Cre+ and Cre� mice (Figures 4H
and S4E). CD4 T cells in IRF-5-sufficient mice increasingly
showed signs of apoptosis over the course of VL, and the fre-
quency of CD4 T cells expressing annexin V was significantly
lower at d28 p.i. in Cre+ mice. Moreover, apoptosis was also
induced in CD4 T cells purified at d21 and d28 p.i. following incu-
bation with IMQ (Figure 4I), although annexin V expression was
not altered in CD4 T cells from d14-p.i.-infected mice. To deter-
mine whether IRF-5 induction in CD4 T cells made cells more
prone to TRAIL-mediated death, we treated CD4 T cells purified
at d14 and d21 p.i. from L. donovani-infected mice with recom-
binant TRAIL. Cell death was assessed after 6 hr by fluores-
cence-activated cell sorting (FACS). As shown in Figure 4J, treat-
ment with recombinant TRAIL (rTRAIL) did not alter cell survival
rate in CD4 purified at d14 p.i. when DR5 is still expressed at
low levels (Figure 4D). In contrast, when we incubated CD4
T cells from d21-infected mice, we noticed a significant increase
in cell death in rTRAIL-treated cells.
Taken together, these results indicate that the TLR7-IRF-5-
DR5 axis sensitizes splenic CD4 T cells to TRAIL-induced cell
death during VL.
IRF-5 Does Not Affect CD4 T Cell Proliferation
IRF-5 was reported to be involved in cell cycle regulation in tumor
cells (Barnes et al., 2003). Thus, we assessed whether there was
a difference in the proliferative capacity between Cre� and Cre+
CD4 T cells. Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-
labeled naive Cre� and Cre+ CD4 T cells were stimulated with
anti-CD3/CD28 in vitro for 5 days. No differences in the percent-
age of CFSElo/int cells were observed between the two groups
over the 5-day period (Figure 5A), indicating that IRF-5 defi-
ciency did not confer a proliferative advantage. To test whether
Cre� and Cre+ CD4 T cells had similar proliferative capacities
during L. donovani infection, we performed a double adoptive
transfer experiment, in which IRF-5-sufficient CD45.1 and IRF-
5-deficient CD45.2 CD4 T cells were co-transferred into
CD45.1/CD45.2 recipients a day prior to L. donovani infection.
The proliferative capacity was monitored based on the Ki67
expression. As shown in Figure 5B, IRF-5-sufficient and deficient
cells had similar Ki67 expression levels, suggesting that the
absence of IRF-5 did not alter cell division in CD4 T cells in vivo
as well. Interestingly, though, the number of IRF-5-deficient CD4
T cells present in the spleen at d21 and d28 p.i. was significantly
higher than that of IRF-5-sufficient cells (Figure 5C). Because
both cell types had similar proliferative capacities (Figure 5B),
this implies that wild-type CD4 T cells were dying.
TLR7-Mediated IRF-5 Activation and CD4 Cell Death Are
Not a Consequence of Microbial Sensing
The next important question that arose was to determine
whether TLR7 on CD4 T cells was directly triggered by
L. donovani and whether other pathways were also involved in
inducing IRF-5. Hence, we incubated CD4 T cells purified from
d14, d21, and d28 p.i. with CpG, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), par-
asites, and parasite RNA or DNA and monitored IRF-5 and DR5
expression by flow cytometry. Because apoptotic and/or
necrotic material has also been described to induce IRF-5 in
monocytes of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients
(Stone et al., 2012) and splenic tissue disruption occurs during
chronic VL (Smelt et al., 1997), we incubated CD4 T cells with su-
pernatant (SN) of apoptotic splenocytes previously incubated
with staurosporine. As for IMQ, cells purified at d14 p.i. did not
upregulate IRF-5 (Figure 6A) or DR5 (Figure 6B) with any of the
stimuli. Only IMQ and the supernatant of apoptotic splenocytes
induced IRF-5 and DR5 expression 30 hr after incubation on CD4
T cells enriched at d21 and d28 p.i. (Figures 6A, 6B, S5A, and
S5B). Similarly, only the incubation of CD4 T cells with IMQ
and the SN of apoptotic splenocytes led to an increase in cell
death (Figure 6C), and all other treatments did not alter the sur-
vival of the cells at any time point observed. This suggests that
microbial sensing or TLR9 and 4 were not involved in inducing
IRF-5 expression and cell death in CD4 T cells during VL, but
this pathway was rather triggered by tissue disruption and TLR7.
Apoptotic Cell Material Induces IRF-5 via TLR7
Our results indicate that TLR7 and tissue disruption can both
induce IRF-5 in CD4 T cells from L. donovani-infected mice.
Hence, we next investigated whether the SN from apoptotic cells
was inducing IRF-5 via TLR7. CD4 T cells were purified from L.
donovani-infected C57BL/6 mice at d14 and d21 p.i. and incu-

 were also treated or not with synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides
with immunoregulatory sequences (IRSs) that specifically block
signaling via TLR7, IRS661 (Barrat et al., 2005). Thirty hours later,
IRF-5 expression was assessed by Image Stream. As expected,
IRF-5 induction following IMQ treatment of d21 p.i. CD4 T cells
was inhibited by IRS661 (Figure 7A). Interestingly, the TLR7
antagonist also prevented the upregulation of IRF-5 following in-
cubation of CD4 T cells purified at d21 p.i. with SN from stauro-
sporine-treated cells (Figure 7A), suggesting that apoptotic ma-
terial also signals via TLR7. No differences in the level of IRF5
expression were detected after any treatment of CD4 T cells pu-
rified at d14 p.i.
To identify the SN component(s) that triggers TLR7, we puri-
fied RNA and DNA (Figure S6) from the SN of apoptotic cells
and analyzed whether IRF-5 was induced by these two compo-
nents. As expected, treatment of splenic Cre� CD4 T cells from
d21-infected mice with IMQ or SN resulted in the upregulation of
IRF-5 mRNA, which was abrogated by the TLR7 agonist IRS661
oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) (Figure 7B). In contrast, IRF-5
mRNA levels did not change when RNA or DNA purified from
the SN of apoptotic cells was added to the same Cre� CD4
T cells (Figure 7B), suggesting that pure RNA or DNA from
apoptotic cell material is not involved in the TLR7-dependent
IRF-5 induction in CD4 T cells.
Similarly to IRF-5, DR5 expression was also not induced
following incubation of Cre� CD4 T cells with RNA or DNA puri-
fied from the SN of apoptotic cells, but it was induced, as ex-
pected, by IMQ and the SN in cells purified at d21 p.i. (Figure 7C).

 Treatment with IRS661 ODN abrogated DR5 induction. To note,
DR5 was not upregulated in CD4 from Cre+ mice even when
treated with IMQ and SN, confirming that IRF-5 is required in
this pathway. We next determined the level of caspase 8
mRNA expression (Figure 7D). Caspase 8 is another reported
downstream target of IRF-5 (Hu and Barnes, 2009) and is part
of the TRAIL-mediated cell death signaling pathway. Treatment
of CD4 T cells purified from d21-infected Cre� mice with IMQ
or SN resulted in a significant caspase 8 induction, which was
blocked by IRS661 ODN. No effect on caspase 8 mRNA expres-
sion levels was observed when the same cells were incubated
with RNA or DNA purified from the SN of apoptotic cells (Fig-
ure 7D). As for DR5, Cre� CD4 T cells and IRF-5-deficient CD4
T cells purified from infected mice at d14 or d14 and d21 p.i.,
respectively, did not upregulate caspase 8 expression under
any condition tested (Figure 7D). Taken together, our results sug-
gest that RNA or DNA from staurosporine-treated cells cannot
trigger TLR7 to induce IRF-5 in CD4 T cells and that IRF-5 is a
crucial component in this pathway.
We finally sought to understand whether the lack of IRF-5 was
somehow altering TLR7 expression on CD4 T cells, and this
would additionally contribute to the reduced cell death
observed in IRF-5-deficient CD4 T cells. To this end, we moni-
tored TLR7 expression on CD4 T cells at d14, d21, and d28 p.i.
in L. donovani-infected Cre� and Cre+ mice. As shown before
(Figure 4A), TLR7 expression was increasingly upregulated
over the course of infection in Cre� CD4 T cells (Figure 7E). In
contrast, TLR7 mRNA was maintained on a stable level in IRF-
5-deficient CD4 T cells (Figure 7E), suggesting that IRF-5 is
not only directly involved in the TLR7-IRF-5-DR5 pathway, but
it also participates in a feedforward loop to upregulate TLR7
expression.

DISCUSSION
Chronic infections are typically associ-
ated with anti-inflammatory responses
aimed at regulating T cell responses
and limiting tissue injuries. However,
these responses often favor pathogen
persistence and may result in immune
suppression.
In
the
present
study,
we propose IRF-5 as an important player in the regulation of
pro-inflammatory CD4 T cells. We show that TLR7-mediated
IRF-5
activation
is
enhancing
DR5-dependent
induction
of apoptosis of protective IFN-g-producing CD4 T cells in L.
donovani-infected mice. T-cell-specific IRF-5 ablation resulted
in stronger IFN-g responses and ultimately lower parasite
burden.
Our
results
also
suggest
that
this
pathway
is
triggered by tissue disruption.
Inflammation is essential for controlling intracellular pathogen
growth. However, excessive and/or chronic inflammation often
leads to tissue damage and initiates anti-inflammatory tissue-
protecting pathways. In the case of VL, disruption of the splenic
microarchitecture occurs from d14 p.i. on and leads to an
impaired capacity of naive T cells and dendritic cells to migrate
to T cell area (Ato et al., 2002) and a progressive loss of B cell
germinal centers (Smelt et al., 1997). TNF is largely responsible
for initiating this process as well as for inducing IL-10 (Ato
et al., 2002; Engwerda et al., 2002). Tissue damage is accompa-
nied by a massive infiltration of inflammatory cells and by spleno-
megaly (Hammami et al., 2017). In this environment, we
observed a gradual upregulation and activation of IRF-5 in
IFN-g+ CD4 T cells. Increased IRF-5 expression was paralleled
by an upregulation of TLR7 and DR5. Although high IFN-I levels
have been linked to DR5 and lymphocytes death (Hardy et al.,
2007; Herbeuval et al., 2006), we did not see a direct effect
of IFN-I on IRF-5 upregulation and CD4 T cell death in L.
donovani-infected mice. In contrast, IRF-5 appeared to be
induced by TLR7. TLR9 and 4, which are both expressed in
T cells (Rahman et al., 2009), do not seem to promote IRF-5
expression in CD4 T cells. The function of innate sensors in cells
of adaptive immunity is still a fairly unexplored field. TLR
signaling pathways in T cells were shown to be necessary for
1170

 effective clonal expansion, in that they act synergistically with
T cell receptor (TCR)-induced signals to enhance proliferation,
survival, and cytokine production in effector cells (Rahman
et al., 2009). Nevertheless, TLR7 was reported to induce anergy
in human CD4 T cells (Dominguez-Villar et al., 2015). A similar
antiproliferative activity was also recently attributed to stimulator
of IFN genes (STING) in T lymphocytes (Cerboni et al., 2017). We
also observed a reduction in proliferation of CD4 T cells from
L. donovani-infected mice in the presence of IMQ (data not
shown); however, the most remarkable effect of TLR7 triggering

was the induction of IRF-5 and subse-
quently DR5, a known target of IRF-5
(Hu and Barnes, 2009). The TLR7-IRF-5
pathway was sensitizing CD4 T cells to
TRAIL-mediated cell death. Interestingly,
IRF-5 and DR5 were mainly expressed in
IFN-g+ CD4 T cells, suggesting that induc-
tion of apoptosis via IRF-5 preferentially
affected
pro-inflammatory
cells.
This
observation prompted us to believe that
this pathway may be in place to protect
inflammation-mediated tissue injuries.
A major question that arose during our
study pertained to the nature of the ligand
responsible for triggering TLR7 in CD4
T cells: is the TLR7 pathway activated
following microbial sensing? Leishmania
typically resides in parasitophorous vacu-
oles inside macrophages (Arango Duque
et al., 2014). Although parasites have
been seen inside or on various cells other
than macrophages (Abidin et al., 2017;
Bankoti
et
al.,
2012;
Ribeiro-Gomes
et al., 2012; Romano et al., 2017; Silva-
Barrios et al., 2016), they were never re-
ported to be internalized by T cells. How-
ever, there is still the remote possibility
though that dead parasites or RNA from
dead parasites could be internalized by
T cells and trigger TLR7. Our results refute
this possibility: Leishmania or leishmanial
DNA/RNA does not trigger TLR7 to induce
IRF-5 in T cells, suggesting that IRF-5-induced cell death during
VL is not a consequence of microbial sensing.
Because splenic tissue disruption is a characteristic feature of
VL (Silva-Barrios et al., 2016) and, in SLE patients, IRF-5 can be
induced by apoptotic and/or necrotic material (Stone et al.,
2012), we were not surprised to observe that the supernatant
of apoptotic splenocytes induced IRF-5 expression and conse-
quently cell death of CD4 T cells from L. donovani-infected
mice. Interestingly, RNA and DNA released by apoptotic cells
were not involved in this induction, suggesting that other, yet
Cell Reports 24, 1163–1175, July 31, 2018
1171
 unidentified supernatant components may trigger the TLR7
pathway in T cells. Hence, local tissue damage mediated by
persistent inflammation leads to suppression of protective
T cell responses during chronic VL. The fact that IRF-5 is not acti-
vated in hepatic CD4 T cells supports our conclusions. Indeed,
this organ clears L. donovani infection by generating a very effi-
cient granulomatous response without major disruption of the
hepatic microarchitecture. It is well documented that dying cells
can regulate adaptive immunity by the release of damage-asso-
ciated molecular pattern (DAMP). However, DAMPs are mainly
known for promoting inflammation and provide immunogenic
signals enhancing T cell priming (Yatim et al., 2017). In our model
of chronic infection, tissue damage appears to dampen pro-in-
flammatory CD4 T cell responses rather than promoting inflam-
mation. This discrepancy probably depends on the cell and re-
ceptor recognizing DAMPs and on the stage of infection;
innate sensors may have very different functions in T cells in a
chronic inflammatory environment.
Although the activation of the TLR7-IRF-5-DR5 axis in T cells
protects the spleen by reducing inflammation, it is also beneficial
to the establishment of persistent L. donovani infection. Indeed,
IFN-g+ CD4 T cells are essential for controlling parasite growth
during chronic VL (Engwerda et al., 1998). In L. donovani-in-
fected mice, IFN-g-producing CD4 T cells are first detectable
at d14 p.i. and reach maximal expansion at d28 p.i. In the liver,
high frequencies of parasite-specific IFN-g+ CD4 T cells are
observed (Paun et al., 2011); in contrast, small percentages of
IFN-g-producing CD4 T cells are typically detected in the spleen.
Because progressive tissue damage and upregulation of TLR7
also occur during this time in the spleen, we believe that IRF-5-
mediated CD4 T cell death severely undermines the expansion
and, later, the maintenance of protective responses in this organ.
This highlights a tissue-specific inhibition of CD4 T cell re-
sponses in L. donovani-infected mice. It remains to determine
though whether IRF-5-mediated death of effector CD4 T cells
is restricted to Leishmania-specific responses or extends to all
effector CD4 T cells present in the spleen and therefore is
accountable for the general immune suppression observed in
VL patients.
Another observation that requires further investigation con-
cerns the regulation of TLR7 expression in CD4 T cells. Our re-
sults indicate that IRF-5 is involved in the upregulation of this re-
ceptor. However, we do not yet know the exact role of IRF-5 in
this feedforward loop or the initial signal(s) responsible for
inducing and activating IRF-5. Because TLR7 is also upregulated
on T cells during chronic viral infections in humans (Dominguez-
Villar et al., 2015; Hammond et al., 2010), dissecting the dynamic
of IRF-5 and TLR7 induction in T cells could help identify poten-
tial therapeutic targets aimed at reversing suppression of protec-
tive T cell responses during persistent infections.
In conclusion, we propose IRF-5 as an important player in the
regulation of IFN-g+ CD4 T cell responses during chronic VL.
Activation of this transcription factor is TLR7 dependent and
appears to be induced by apoptotic and/or necrotic material.
In IFN-g+ CD4 T cells, IRF-5 promotes the expression of DR5
and caspase 8, sensitizing these cells to TRAIL-mediated cell
death. Because tissue disruption is a common characteristic of
persistent infections, this regulatory pathway may not only be
activated during VL but could be a generalized mechanism pre-
sent in other chronic infectious diseases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice and Parasites
B6.129S7-Rag1tm1Mom and congenic B6-Ly5.1 mice were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory. C57BL/Bl6-Tlr7�/� mice and Ifnar�/� mice were a kind gift
from Drs. Alain Lamarre (INRS-Institut Armand Frappier) and Jo
¨ rg Hermann Fritz
(McGill University).Mice with a targetedIRF-5mutation inT cells were generated
by crossing Irf5flox/flox mice(Hammamiet al., 2015) with mice expressing thecre-
recombinase under the Lck promoter. All mice were housed at the Institut Na-
tional de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS) animal facility under specific path-
ogen-free conditions and used at 6–10 weeks of age. Leishmania donovani
(strain LV9) were maintained by serial passage in B6.129S7-Rag1tm1Mom mice,
and amastigotes were isolated from the spleen of infected animals. Mice were
infected by injecting 2 3 107 amastigotes intravenously via the lateral tail vein.
Splenic parasite burden was determined by examining methanol-fixed, Giemsa
stained tissue impression smears. Data are presented as Leishmania donovani
units (LDUs) (Silva-Barrios et al., 2016).
Study Approval
Experiments involving mice were carried out under protocols approved by the
Comite
´ Institutionnel de Protection des Animaux of the INRS-Institut Armand
Frappier (1510-02 and 1602-02). These protocols respect procedure on
good animal practice provided by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. No
differences in the course of L. donovani infection were observed between
male and female mice, so male and female mice were used indiscriminately.
Nevertheless, male mice were always matched and compared to male mice
for the various experimental groups.
In Vivo Th1 Polarization
CD4 T cells were enriched by magnetic cell sorting (MACS) using a CD4 T cell
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech) and activated for 5 days with plate-bound
1 mg/mL anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C1C; eBioscience) and 2 mg/mL anti-CD28
(clone 37.51; eBioscience) in the presence of 2 ng/mL IL-2 and 30 ng/mL
IL-12 (PeproTech). Cells were then restimulated for 4 hr with phorbol 12-myr-
istate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin in the presence of Brefeldin A (Sigma), har-
vested, and analyzed by flow cytometry as detailed below.
In Vitro CD4 T Cell Proliferation
CD4 T cells were enriched by MACS using a CD4 T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi
Biotech) and then stained with CFSE as previously described (Joshi et al.,
2009). CFSE-labeled CD4 T cells were activated with plate-bound 1 mg/mL
anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C1C; eBioscience) and 2 mg/mL anti-CD28 (clone
37.51; eBioscience) in the presence of 2 ng/mL IL-2 and analyzed by flow cy-
tometry as detailed below.
Adoptive Transfer Experiments
C57BL/6, C57BL/6-Ly5.1, Irf5�/�, Tlr7�/�, and Ifnar�/� mice were used as CD4
T cells donors. CD4 T cells were enriched by MACS from splenocytes of naive
animals using a CD4 T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech). 5 3 106 donor CD4
T cells were injected into the lateral tail vein of congenic B6-Ly5.1 or B6-Ly5.1-
Ly5.2 mice the day prior to infection with L. donovani amastigotes. Mice were
sacrificed at the indicated time points.
Flow Cytometry
The following antibodies were used for surface staining: BV421-conjugated
anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11; BD Biosciences); BV421-conjugated anti-CD4
(clone GK1.5; BD Biosciences); fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conju-
gated anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5; BD Biosciences); phycoerythrin (PE)-conju-

286; BioLegend); BV650-conjugated CD45.2 (clone 104; BD Biosciences);
and Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend). Intracellular staining
was performed as previously described (Hammami et al., 2015). Briefly, sple-
nocytes were either restimulated with bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells
(BMDCs) pulsed with fixed parasites or PMA/ionomycin in the presence of
Brefeldin A (BD Biosciences). After fixation, cells were permeabilized and
stained with the following antibodies: APC-conjugated anti-IFNg (clone
XMG1.2; BD Biosciences); PE-conjugated anti-IL-10 (BD Biosciences);
AF488-conjugated anti-FoxP3 (clone FJK-16 s; eBioscience); PE-Cy7-conju-
gated anti-Ki67 (clone 16A8; BioLegend); and propidium iodide (Sigma). Flow
cytometric analysis was performed with a BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer
(Becton Dickinson). Samples were analyzed with Flowjo and DIVA software.
ImageStream Flow Cytometry
The following antibodies were used for surface staining: PE-conjugated anti-
CD4 (clone GK1.5); biotin-conjugated anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5); biotin-conju-
gated anti-CD45.2 (clone 104; cat no. 553771); PE-Cy7-conjugated streptavi-
din; APC-conjugated streptavidin; PE-conjugated anti-CD62L (clone MEL-14);
APC-conjugated anti-CD44 (clone IM7); and biotin-conjugated anti-CD3
(clone 145-2C11) from BD Biosciences. For intracellular staining, cells were
stimulated with BMDCs pulsed with fixed parasites in the presence of Brefeldin
A (BD Biosciences) and stained with surface antibodies. After fixation, cells
were permeabilized and stained with APC-conjugated anti-IFN-g (clone
XMG1.2; BD Biosciences) and AF488-conjugated anti-IRF5 (R&D Systems).
DAPI (Invitrogen) was used to stain the nucleus of cells immediately before
acquisition. Samples were acquired using the ImageStreamX MKII flow
cytometer and analyzed with IDEAS software (Amnis, Seattle, WA, USA).
200,000–500,000 gated cell singlets were analyzed for each sample. Nuclear
localization of IRF5 was measured using a morphology mask to determine a
similarity score, which quantifies the correlation of pixel values of the DAPI
and IRF5 images on a per cell basis. A similarity score >1 was used as a cutoff
for nuclear localization. Cells in individual bins were visually inspected to
confirm subcellular localization (values < or >1).
Real-Time qPCR Analysis
RNA from isolated CD4 T cells from in vitro or in vivo experiments was ex-
tracted using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Reverse transcription was carried out using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-
Rad) as previously described (Hammami et al., 2015). Real-time PCR analysis
was performed using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Dr5,
Irf5, Tlr7, and Hprt were amplified using the following primers: Hprt, 50-GTT
GGA TAC AGG CCA GAC TTT GTT G-30 and 50-GAT TCA ACC TTG CGC
TCA TCT TAG GC-30; Tnfrsf10b (DR5), 50-TGA CGG GGA AGA GGA ACT

ACA GG-30; and Casp8, 50-CTC CGA AAA ATG AAG GAC AGA-30 and
50-CGT GGG ATA GGA TAC AGC AGA-30. All PCRs were carried out with
the Stratagene mx3000P real-time PCR system. Data were normalized to hy-
poxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and expressed as fold
gene regulation compared to naive controls.
In Vitro CD4 T Cell Stimulation and Recombinant TRAIL Treatment
CD4 T cells were purified following manufacturer’s instructions from spleno-
cytes of infected and naive mice by MACS using a CD4 isolation kit (Miltenyi
Biotech). Purified CD4 T cells (purity >95%) were incubated at 37�C for 24 hr
or 30 hr with 5 mg/mL imiquimod (Invivogen), 3 mg/mL CpG (Invivogen),
10 mg/mL LPS (Sigma), amastigotes at a MOI of 1:10, 500 ng/mL parasite
RNA, 500 ng/mL parasite DNA, 10% v/v supernatant of staurosporine-treated
cells, 500 ng/mL RNA, or 500 ng/mL DNA purified from supernatant of staur-
osporine-treated cells. ODNs IRS661 (50-TGCTTGCAAGCTTGCAAGCA-30)
were used as TLR7 antagonist; 50-TCCTGCAGGTTAAGT-30 ODNs were
used as control (Barrat et al., 2005). ODNs were prepared in sterile water
and utilized at 5.6 mg/mL. Cells were treated with IRS661 30 min before to
receive other treatments. For TRAIL treatment, CD4 T cells were purified as
mentioned above and incubated at 37�C for 6 hr with 100 ng/mL recombinant
murine TRAIL (Peprotech). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco; Invitro-
gen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using paired Student’s t test or multi-way
ANOVA. Statistical analysis was conducted using Graphpad Prism (Graph-
Pad). Differences were considered to be statistically significant when p <
0.05. All experiments were conducted independently at least three times.
