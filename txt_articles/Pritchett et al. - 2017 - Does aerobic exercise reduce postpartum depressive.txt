 INTRODUCTION
Postpartum depression is a global mental 
health issue, annually affecting 13 million 
women worldwide.1–3 Postpartum depression 
can lead to thoughts of self-harm and/or 
harm of the child,4 and negatively affect 
children’s development.5,6 There can be 
reluctance by women to take antidepressants 
postnatally, 
particularly 
if 
they 
are 
breastfeeding.7,8 
Cognitive 
behavioural 
therapy can be effective but waiting lists are 
often long in the UK.9 Exercise can have a 
moderate effect in reducing general adult 
depression (standardised mean difference 
[SMD] ]–0.62, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = –0.81 to –0.42).10 
Practitioner-led 
group 
exercise 
is 
recommended by the UK National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
for persistent subthreshold depressive 
symptoms 
and 
mild-to-moderate 
depression.11 However, women in the 
postpartum period have particular physical, 
practical, and psychological challenges to 
exercising.12,13 
A 2009 review provided some support 
for exercise as an adjunctive treatment 
for postpartum depressive symptoms.14 
Despite its challenges, exercise provides 
another intervention option when many 
mothers are reluctant to seek treatment 
and/or take antidepressants.8 
Exercise also offers improved fitness and 
weight loss, and opportunities for social 
interaction at a time when women experience 
decreased exercise and weight retention.15–17
Aim and objectives
The aim and objectives of this study were to 
undertake a meta-analysis of randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the 
effect of aerobic exercise interventions, 
compared with usual care, on depressive 
symptoms in women up to 1 year 
postpartum. The study aimed to explore the 
effect of exercise on depressive symptoms 
in three subgroup analyses:
• women with possible depression and 
general postpartum populations;
• interventions based only on exercise and 
those with co-interventions; and
• interventions providing structured group 
exercise and those supporting participant 
choice of exercise.
METHOD
The review was registered on PROSPERO: 
CRD42016047656.
Data sources and searches
The Cochrane Collaboration’s guidance 
was followed on reviews of interventions18 
and PRISMA guidelines.19 The following 
bibliographic databases were searched 
electronically for eligible trials: MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, 
SportDiscus, 
and 
Clinical 
Trials.gov. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) 
International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform was searched for trials in 
progress. Searches were conducted for grey 
literature in Open Grey (http://opengrey.

Abstract
Background
There is currently no specific guidance on 
the role of exercise in managing postpartum 
depression in the UK and US, and international 
guidance is inconsistent. 
Aim
To assess the effectiveness of aerobic exercise 
on postpartum depressive symptoms.
Design and setting
Systematic review and meta-analysis. There 
was no restriction to study site or setting. 
Method
The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane 
Library, PsycINFO, SportDiscus, Clinical 
Trials.gov, and the World Health Organization 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform 
were searched. Titles and abstracts, then 
full-text articles, were screened against 
inclusion criteria: RCTs measuring depressive 
symptoms in mothers ≤1 year postpartum; 
and interventions designed to increase aerobic 
exercise compared with usual care or other 
comparators. Included studies were assessed 
using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of 
bias tool. Meta-analysis was conducted. 
Pre-planned subgroup analyses explored 
heterogeneity. 
Results
Thirteen RCTs were included, with 1734 eligible 
participants. Exercise significantly reduced 
depressive symptoms when all trials were 
combined (standardised mean difference 
–0.44; 95% confidence interval = –0.75 to 
–0.12). Exploration of heterogeneity did not find 
significant differences in effect size between 
women with possible depression and in general 
postpartum populations; exercise only and 
exercise with co-interventions; and group 
exercise and exercise counselling.
Conclusion
This systematic review provides support 
for the effectiveness of exercise in reducing 
postpartum depressive symptoms. Group 
exercise, participant-chosen exercise, and 
exercise with co-interventions all may be 
effective interventions. These results should be 
interpreted with caution because of substantial 
heterogeneity and risk of bias.

Searches were conducted on a range of 
psychological outcomes; only the results 
for depression are presented. The following 
terms were searched as text words and MeSH 
terms where applicable: exercise, physical 
activity, postpartum, postnatal, mother, birth, 
perinatal, depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, 
quality of life, mother and infant bonding, 
and child development (the MEDLINE search 
strategy is available from authors on request). 
Searches were unrestricted by date or 
language and undertaken up to September 
2016. Bibliographies of eligible studies and 
reviews were searched for additional trials, 
and authors contacted if required. Two 
researchers independently reviewed titles, 
abstracts, and full-text articles. Eligibility 
discrepancies were discussed with a third 
reviewer
.
Study selection
Inclusion criteria were:
• populations 
of 
mothers 
<1 year 
postpartum; 
• interventions designed to increase 
aerobic 
exercise 
(activity 
causing 
increased heart rate, respiratory rate, 
and sweating), including those with 
co-interventions such as social support 
or nutrition elements;
• comparator groups receiving no care or 
any form of usual care; 
• depressive symptoms measured by 
questionnaire or diagnostic interview; and
• RCTs.
Exclusion criteria were trials comparing 
two types of exercise.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data describing the population, intervention, 
and findings were extracted independently 
by two researchers using standardised, 
piloted, extraction spreadsheets. Reviewers 
were not blinded to authors, institution, 
or journal. Authors were contacted if 
clarification was required.
Two researchers independently applied 
the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias 
tool18 in relation to sequence generation, 
allocation 
concealment, 
blinding 
of 
outcome assessors, incomplete outcome 
data, selective outcome reporting, and other 
sources of bias.18 Blinding of personnel and 
participants to group allocation was not 
assessed because of the impracticalities 
of this in exercise trials. Each study was 
allocated an overall risk of bias: with 
a low risk of bias being assigned if the 
risk of bias was deemed to be low in all 
subdomains; an unclear risk of bias if the 
risk was considered unclear in one or more 
subdomains; and a high risk of bias if 
the risk was considered high in one or 
more subdomains.18 Publication bias was 
assessed by visually inspecting a funnel plot 
of the SMDs for depressive symptoms.
Data synthesis and analysis
Populations indicating possible depression 
on screening questionnaires or in the 
clinical judgement of a health professional 
are referred to as ‘depressed’ postpartum 
populations.
Meta-analyses and meta-regressions 
were conducted using Review Manager 5.3. 
An SMD18 was calculated for continuous 
outcomes of depressive symptoms. If more 
than one measure for depression was 
reported, the primary continuous outcome 
measure was used. The final point of 
follow-up was used because the aim was 
to report long-term outcomes. A weighted 
mean difference (WMD) was calculated for 
all trials using the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale (EPDS) to assess 
depressive symptoms.20 Where the standard 
deviation of the difference in score was not 
reported, this was calculated. A correlation 
of 0.6 was used in the assumptions to 
estimate standard deviations of differences, 
based on a previous sample of postpartum 
women.21 A random effects model was 
used throughout because of known clinical 
heterogeneity between populations and 
methodological heterogeneity between 
interventions.
An initial pooled SMD difference was 
calculated with 95% CI, with all trials 
included. Statistical significance was defined 
as having a 95% CI that did not include 
zero. Clinical heterogeneity was explored 
(by qualitatively comparing characteristics 
How this fits in
UK clinical guidance recommends 
psychological therapy and antidepressants 
for postnatal depression. However, women 
can be reluctant to take antidepressants 
postnatally and the availability of 
psychological therapies is often limited. 
Exercise is effective in treating depression 
in the general adult population; however, 
there are particular challenges to be 
overcome in the postnatal period. This 
systematic review found that exercise is an 
effective intervention for reducing postnatal 
depressive symptoms.

 between trials) and statistical heterogeneity 
using c2 tests of heterogeneity and the I 2 
statistic.
Three a priori subgroup analyses 
were performed, investigating whether 
the effectiveness of exercise in reducing 
postpartum depressive symptoms varied 
in relation to the population of women 
(women with possible depression or 
general postpartum populations); the 
presence of co-interventions (exercise only 
or exercise with co-interventions such as 
diet or social support); and the context of 
exercise (exercise groups or participant 
choice; participant choice often consisted 
of exercise counselling interventions 
in which participants typically elected to 
exercise alone, often by walking). For each 
hypothesis, the trials were categorised into 
subgroups; and a random effects meta-
regression model was used to determine 
the effects of exercise in each subgroup 
and the significance of differences between 
subgroups.
RESULTS
Trial selection
Of the 9165 records identified after the 
removal of duplicates, 9043 were excluded 
after reading titles and abstracts. A further 
109 full-text records were excluded based 
on the eligibility criteria. Thirteen trials were 
included in the meta-analysis (Figure 1).
Trial characteristics
All 13 RCTs had been peer reviewed and 
published as journal articles,22–24,26–33 a 
PhD thesis,25 or abstracts.34 Four trials 
were conducted in the US,25,27,29,31 three in 
England, UK,28,33,34 two in Australia,22,26 one in 
Canada,23 one in India,30 one in Japan,32 and 
one in Taiwan.24
The total population of the combined 
studies was 1734 eligible participants, with 
follow-up data provided by 1307 participants 
who were included in the primary meta-
analysis. Seven trials recruited participants 
with possible depression,22–25,28,33,34 of which 
three required participants to score above 
a threshold on the EPDS questionnaire 
(from ≥10 to >12),26,27,32 and two required 
a diagnosis of depression (International 
Classification of Diseases version 10 [ICD-
10]33 or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders fourth edition [DSM-IV] 
criteria).34 Despite not reporting baseline 
depression threshold criteria, two trials 
reported mean baseline depression scores 
indicating depressed populations (EPDS 
scores of 18.9–19.8,25 Beck Depression 
Inventory 
[BDI] 
15.8–16.9).27 
These 
trials were therefore considered to have 
‘depressed’ 
postpartum 
populations. 
Six trials recruited general postpartum 
populations (Table 1).26,27,29–32
Intervention characteristics
All trials included interventions designed 
to increase exercise levels. In addition, two 
trial interventions also aimed to improve 
diet and encourage a healthy lifestyle,24,27 
two also provided social support,22,31 and 
one also provided education on postpartum 
issues.26 Six trials had group exercise 
interventions;22,26,30–32,34 seven trials had 
interventions in which exercise counselling 
was provided and the participant was free 
to choose their own form of exercise (Table 
1).23–25,27–29,33 The interventions ranged from 
4 weeks’ duration30,32 to 6 months.24,29,33 
Most aimed to achieve 30 minutes 
of moderate activity three to five times 
weekly,22,23,25,27–29,32–34 
although 
some 
consisted of once-weekly group exercise.26,30 
Eight of the studies reported adherence to 
the intended intervention.22,23,25,28,29,32–34
Risk of bias in included studies and 
publication bias
Six trials were considered at unclear 
risk22,23,28–30,34 and seven at high risk of 
bias.24–27,31–33 Principal factors introducing 
a risk of bias were a lack of intention-to-

 treat analyses (some studies excluded non-
adherent participants), a lack of clarity on 
selective outcome reporting, a lack of robust 
sequence generation and concealment of 
randomisation procedures, and unclear 
blinding of those conducting outcome 
assessments and analyses (details of the 
risk of bias in included studies are available 
from the authors on request).
The funnel plot was visually inspected 
for the main analysis including all trials. 
There appeared to be a lack of smaller 
studies with results indicating an increase 
in depression in exercise intervention 
groups compared with comparator groups. 
This may be an indication of publication 
bias (details available from the authors on 
request).
Provision of additional data
Authors of four trials provided additional 
data for this review: DaCosta et al,23 Surkan 
et al,27 Lewis et al,29 and Boath et al.34
Data analysis
Overall effect of exercise on depression 
scores. Exercise interventions significantly 
reduced depressive symptoms (SMD –0.44, 
95% CI = –0.75 to –0.12, n = 1307, I 
 
² 85%, 
13 trials) (Figure 2).22–34 The WMD was 
–1.54 EPDS units, 95% CI = –2.97 to –0.12, 
n = 652, I 2 87%.22,23,25,26,28,30–34
Population. Exercise interventions had 
a significant effect in reducing depressive 
symptoms in ‘depressed’ postpartum 
populations (SMD –0.32, 95% CI = –0.63 
to –0.00), I 2 55% (Table 2),22–25,28,33,34 and in 
general postpartum populations (-0.57, 95% 
CI = –1.12 to –0.02, I 2 92%) (Table 2).26,27,29–32 
The effect of exercise interventions in the 
‘depressed’ 
and 
general 
postpartum 
populations was not significantly different 
(test for subgroup differences c² 0.62, 
P = 0.43, I 2 0%) (further details available from 
the authors on request).
Intervention type. Exercise-only interventions 
had a non-significant effect in reducing 
depressive symptoms (SMD –0.56, 95% 
CI = –1.13 to 0.01, I 2 89%).23,25,28–30,32–34 Exercise 
with co-interventions had a significant effect 
on reducing depressive symptoms (–0.35, 
95% CI = –0.66 to –0.04, I 2 72%).22,24,26,27,31 
The effect of exercise-only interventions 
and exercise co-interventions on depressive 
symptoms was not significantly different (test 
for subgroup differences: c² 0.41, P = 0.52, I 2 
0%) (Table 2) (further details available from 
the authors on request).
Exercise 
context. Group 
exercise 
interventions had a significant effect in 
reducing depressive symptoms (SMD 
difference –1.10, 95% CI = –1.99 to –0.21, 
I 2 
93%).22,26,30–32,34 
Participant 
choice 
interventions such as exercise counselling 
with personal choice of exercise (often 
exercise alone) had a significant effect in 
reducing depressive symptoms (–0.20, 95% 
CI = –0.33 to –0.06, I 2 0%).23–25,27–29,33 The 
effects of group exercise and participant 
choice exercise on depressive symptoms 
were not significantly different (test for 
subgroup differences: c² 3.89, P = 0.05), I 2 
74%) (Table 2) (further details available from 
the authors on request).
DISCUSSION
Summary
There is no specific guidance on the role 
of exercise in management of perinatal 
mental health in the UK or the US.7,35 
This systematic review provides support 
for exercise as an effective treatment for 
reducing postpartum depressive symptoms, 
whether or not women meet robust criteria 
for postpartum depression. Additionally, 
characteristics of exercise interventions 
have been explored that are most likely to 
be effective for the postpartum population.
Strengths and limitations 
Caution should be taken when interpreting 
the present results, as a substantial level of 
heterogeneity was present. Heterogeneity 
was present in the design of the trials, 
including exercise-only interventions and 
those also promoting a healthy diet or 
social support among peers. Exercise 
contexts also varied between structured, 
group-based exercise and tailored exercise 
counselling with participant choice of 
exercise. A random effects model was used 
in analyses to account for this variation, 
and potential causes of heterogeneity were 
explored in subgroup analyses; however, 
there were insufficient numbers of trials 
to explore this heterogeneity in depth. The 
last follow-up point was used because the 
focus of the present study was on long-term 
outcomes; the median duration of follow-
up was 6 months from recruitment (IQR 
3.6 months).
The methodological quality of several of 
the included trials was low. Exclusion of 
non-adherent participants, insufficiently 
robust sequence generation, and unclear 
blinding of outcome assessors resulted in 
an increased risk of bias. Only two included 
trials in ‘depressed’ populations recruited 
women with a diagnosis of depression 
(ICD-10 or DSM-IV);33,34 the remainder 
used screening questionnaires such as the

 EPDS 20 to indicate women with possible 
depression. The EPDS has the advantage of 
being relatively short and simple to complete, 
but has been reported to have considerable 
heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity 
for detecting postpartum depression across 
different settings and populations.36
There was a lack of assessment of 
exercise duration and intensity in included 
studies; of those that did provide this 
information, only two included an objective 
measure of exercise.31,33 Exercise intensity 
can be difficult to determine accurately by 
self-report. For future research, objective 
accelerometry would allow for greater 
accuracy and more meaningful comparison 
between intervention types.
This review has several strengths. 
Recommended methods were followed; 
searching was systematic and not limited 
by language of publication. The review was 
restricted to RCTs to reduce the potential for 
confounding. The effectiveness of exercise 
was explored in different populations, 
intervention types, and exercise contexts, 
which has not been previously attempted.
Comparison with existing literature 
The evidence in this field has increased 
substantially since the review by Daley et al 
in 2009.14 Although the primary effect size 
in this review is smaller than that reported 
by Daley et al (SMD –0.44, 95% CI = –0.75 
to –0.12 rather than –0.81, 95% CI = –1.53 
to –0.1014), the CI surrounding the effect is 
narrower here, indicating more precision.
In this review, the effect of exercise in 
depressed postpartum populations was 
smaller than that reported in a recent 
review of exercise in general adult 
depressed populations (SMD –0.62, 95% 
CI = –0.81 to –0.42),10 indicating that there 
may be differences in the way general adult 
populations and postpartum populations

 respond to exercise or differing abilities to 
adhere to an exercise regime. Women in the 
postnatal period have the time constraints 
of new parenthood and barriers to exercise 
such as fatigue. These factors could be 
explored by qualitative research with 
postnatal women.
The effect of exercise on postpartum 
depressive symptoms reported in this 
review compared favourably with that 
reported in a review of low-intensity 
psychological interventions (such as online 
cognitive behavioural therapy and self-help 
literature) versus usual care for depression 
in the general population (SMD –0.42, 
95% CI = –0.55 to –0.29).37 Despite some 
temporary changes in the composition of 
breastmilk following maximal exercise, the 
literature does not suggest any detrimental 
effects of moderate levels of aerobic 
exercise,38 as evaluated by the trials in this 
review. Such interventions are often among 
the first treatments offered to individuals 
presenting with depression.11 The effect 
reported here of exercise on postpartum 
depressive symptoms is also comparable 
with those reported for antidepressants 
in depressed adult populations (SMD 
–0.49, 95% CI = –0.67 to –0.32 for tricyclic 
antidepressants and –0.24, 95% CI = –0.35 
to –0.12 for selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors compared with placebo).39 
Exercise interventions also offer the 
additional health benefits of improved 
physical fitness and weight loss, outcomes 
particularly relevant to postpartum women, 
who often experience decreased exercise 
levels and excess weight.15–17 The finding 
that both group exercise and participant 
choice of exercise (often solitary exercise) 
may be effective in reducing postpartum 
depressive symptoms is also noteworthy. 
Current guidance from NICE on the 
treatment of postpartum mental illness 
refers clinicians to exercise advice for the 
general adult population, recommending 
only group exercise,11 which may not be 
the most feasible or acceptable option for 
women after having a baby.40 
Implications for practice 
National and international guidance on 
the use of exercise to reduce depressive 
symptoms in the postpartum period 
is 
lacking. 
Although 
acknowledging 
considerable 
uncertainty 
about 
the 
present findings because of substantial 
heterogeneity, given the high prevalence of 
postpartum depression and the potential 
for exercise to be a low-cost, freely available 
intervention, aerobic exercise should 
be considered as a management option 
for postpartum women with depressive 
symptoms and as a potential preventative 
measure more generally in postpartum 
women.
