ABSTRACT
Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the second most prevalent carcinogenic exposure in Canada and is
similarly important in other countries with large Caucasian populations. The objective of this article
was to estimate the economic burden associated with newly diagnosed non-melanoma skin cancers
(NMSCs) attributable to occupational solar radiation exposure. Key cost categories considered were
directcosts (healthcarecosts,out-of-pocketcosts (OOPCs),andinformalcaregivercosts);indirectcosts
(productivity/output costs and home production costs); and intangible costs (monetary value of the
loss of health-related quality of life (HRQoL)). To generate the burden estimates, we used secondary
data from multiple sources applied to computational methods developed from an extensive review of
the literature. An estimated 2,846 (5.3%) of the 53,696 newly diagnosed cases of basal cell carcinoma
(BCC) and 1,710 (9.2%) of the 18,549 newly diagnosed cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 2011 in
Canada were attributable to occupational solar radiation exposure. The combined total for direct and
indirect costs of occupational NMSC cases is $28.9 million ($15.9 million for BCC and $13.0 million for
SCC), and for intangible costs is $5.7 million ($0.6 million for BCC and $5.1 million for SCC). On a per-case
basis, the total costs are $5,670 for BCC and $10,555 for SCC. The higher per-case cost for SCC is largely
a result of a lower survival rate, and hence higher indirect and intangible costs. Our estimates can be
used to raise awareness of occupational solar UV exposure as an important causal factor in NMSCs and
can highlight the importance of occupational BCC and SCC among other occupational cancers.
Introduction
Skin carcinomas are the most common form of cancer
in countries with large Caucasian populations and are
one of the few malignancies with increasing incidence.
In Canada, it is estimated that 34% of all cancers are
skin related.[1] The 3 most common forms of skin can-
cer are melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The latter two are
commonly referred to together as non-melanoma skin
cancers (NMSCs). NMSCs are far more prevalent than
melanoma, and BCC specifically is the most common
form of any skin malignancy.[2]

The risk of developing NMSCs is associated with
several factors, however, it has long been accepted that
ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is the main cause
of this cancer.[3,4] CAREX Canada has identified solar
UV radiation as the second most prominent carcino-
genic exposure in Canada.[5] Peters et al. reported over
1.5 million Canadian workers are exposed to solar UV
at work, and approximately 900,000 of them spent more
than 75% of their workdays outdoors (e.g., construction
workers, farmers, and landscapers) and have a high
level of exposure to solar UV (defined as 6 hr or more
per workday spent outdoors).[6] Exposure to solar UV

radiation depends on a number of factors, including
latitude, elevation, the presence of reflective surfaces,
ozone concentration, cloud cover, and particulate matter
in the atmosphere.[7]
Estimating the number of cases and economic burden
of NMSCs caused by occupational solar UV exposure can
provide invaluable information for policy development
and priority-setting for occupational cancer prevention
purposes. Several studies have been undertaken that
consider the economic burden of all skin cancers, or only
occupational cases, in Canada and elsewhere. We present
a subset of NMSCs economic burden studies from North
America that provide both direct and indirect cost esti-
mates and reported per-case cost in order to facilitate
comparisons.
Krueger et al. reported on the cost of skin cancers in
Canada for new cases in 2004.[1] Based on their incidence
numbers and total costs, we calculated average per-case
costs for NMSCs of $1,162 in 2004 Canadian dollars
($1,429 in 2011 Canadian dollars). The average per-case
direct costs for BCC and SCC were $436 and $660,
respectively, in 2004 Canadian dollars. The authors con-
sidered 3 expenditure categories for direct costs: primary
care-based treatment, day surgery in outpatient clinics,
and inpatient/hospital stays. Based on the data presented
in their report, indirect per-case costs for BCC and SCC
were $362 and $1,945, respectively, in 2004 Canadian
dollars. The SCC indirect costs are higher due to a higher
mortality rate for this type of cancer. These costs include
the value of work-loss days from mortality and morbidity.
In another Canadian study, Orenstein et al. estimated
the economic burden of occupational cancers in Alberta
for the year 2003.[8] Their average cost estimate for
NMSCs was $3,233 per-case in 2008 Canadian dollars
($3,533 in 2011 Canadian dollars). This study does not
provide the cost for BCC and SCC separately. Since the
authors only had healthcare costs information for lung
cancer, they used the published scientific literature to esti-
mate a proportion of the lung cancer costs that would be
appropriate for NMSCs (a ratio of 0.19). The estimated
direct and indirect costs per-case NMSCs are $2,484 and
$749, respectively, in 2008 Canadian dollars. In their indi-
rect costs, they included costs attributable to absenteeism,
disability, and premature mortality.
Bickers et al. estimated the burden of NMSCs in the
United States (US) for new cases in 2004.[9] However, this
study does not provide the costs for BCC and SCC sep-
arately. It also does not provide per-case cost. We esti-
mated the average per-case cost for NMSCs to be $2,010
in 2004 US dollars ($2,472 in 2011 Canadian dollar). We
also estimated their direct and indirect costs at $1,209
and $801, respectively, in 2004 US dollars. For direct
costs, the authors considered hospital costs for inpatient,
outpatient, and the emergency department. They also
included physician office visits and prescription drugs in
their direct cost calculations. For the indirect cost cate-
gory, they considered time spent for healthcare consump-
tion, lost or impaired ability to work or enjoy leisure
activities as a result of morbidity, caregiver lost workdays
and lost future earnings due to premature mortality. This
study also reported an additional cost category, intangi-
ble costs associated with the impact of skin disease on
quality of life. We estimated their per-case intangible cost
at $801 in 2004 US dollars, as they did not provide per-
case cost. These costs are based on the Dermatology Life
Quality Index (DLQI) score used in conjunction with a
willingness-to-pay approach to approximate the average
amount a person is willing to pay to avoid this adverse
health outcome.
In another study in the U.S., Kyle et al. reported on an
economic evaluation with different preventive program
scenarios for the 1999 calendar year.[10] Their average
per-case cost for BCC and SCC are $1,785 and $4,523,
respectively, in 1999 US dollars ($2,545 and $6,449 in 2011
Canadian dollars). Since they did not report the aver-
age cost per-case for NMSCs, nor the incident number
of NMSCs, we are unable to estimate an NMSCs per-case
cost for this study. The authors reported the direct cost of
both BCC and SCC at $825, in 1999 US dollars. They drew
on the healthcare costs from Chen et al. study,[11] which
was calculated based on Medicare current beneficiary sur-
vey data (1999–2000). They also reported the indirect
costs at $959 and $3,698 for BCC and SCC, respectively, in
1999 US dollars. Their indirect costs estimation are based
on a US Environmental Protection Agency analysis devel-
oped to support a regulatory impact analysis. Productiv-
ity loss costs per-case were estimated by multiplying the
Environmental Protection Agency’
s estimates of the loss
of work associated with illness from BCC and SCC, as
well as caregiving performed by others, by the national
mean annual wage for 1999. Work loss associated with
morbidity and premature mortality were both included in
the indirect cost estimation. The researchers also consid-
ered Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) losses from an
intervention program with different preventive scenarios,
but did not report the per-case numbers in the study.
There have been several economic burden of skin can-
cer studies published in the scientific literature, but there
are inconsistencies in the methods used, as well as a ten-
dency to not include some key costs such as HRQoL costs.
Some studies simply reported healthcare system costs
as direct costs and ignore out-of-pocket costs (OOPCs)
and informal caregiver costs. In terms of indirect costs,
most studies considered productivity losses due to mor-
bidity and premature mortality but differ in the details
of the methods used. Some considered only productivity

be worth including if at all possible, given that their values

tude.
Most studies on the economic burden of NMSCs do
not focus on occupational exposure. In fact, we were
unable to identify any peer-reviewed economic burden
studies focused solely on occupational NMSCs arising
from solar UV radiation. Thus, this study provides the
first attempt to comprehensively estimate the economic
burden of occupational NMSCs in Canada. Specifically,
we used an incidence cost approach to estimate the eco-
nomic burden for Canada of newly diagnosed NMSCs
cases in the calendar year 2011, attributable to occupa-
tional solar radiation exposure.
Methods
This study draws on computation methods developed
from an extensive review of the literature, particularly
Tompa et al.[12] and Leigh.[13] Several studies have used
similar approaches to estimate the societal burden of all
occupational injuries and illnesses in Australia[14] and
Singapore.[15] We used an incidence cost approach to esti-
mate the lifetime cost of newly diagnosed NMSCs in the
calendar year 2011. We consider the economic burden
of NMSCs in three broad cost categories as indicated in
Table 1, namely direct, indirect, and intangible costs. All
monetary values were converted to 2011 Canadian dol-
lars. Monetary flows in years after 2011 were discounted
to the 2011 calendar year using a 3% discount/interest
rate. Productivity growth was assumed to be 1%, based on
data drawn from Canadian System of National Accounts
(CSNA).[16]
Input data
To generate the estimates, we combined secondary data
sources drawn from various sources with an estima-
tion method described above. The principal data were
NMSCs incidence rates, healthcare costs, Health Utili-
ties Index (HUI) values for different health states, the
probability of survival at different ages, consumer price
indices, and employment rates. Data sources include the
Occupational Cancer Research Centre (OCRC) based in
Toronto (2011); Schedule facility fees and physician ser-
vices under the health insurance act of Ontario, Canada
(2013);[17] Canadian Population Life Expectancy (2009–
2011);[18] Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)
(2010);[19] Labour Force Survey (LFS) (2011);[20] Sur-
vey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) (2010);[20]
CSNA (2011);[16] General Social Survey (GSS) (2005);[21]
and Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH)
(2011).[22] Other secondary data sources included data
abstracted from the published literature for various esti-
mates needed for the computations. Sources are identified
in the description of these computations below.
The starting point for our burden estimates was the
number of newly identified NMSCs in Canada in 2011
attributable to occupational solar radiation exposure,
stratified by sex and age bracket, estimated by several
members of our research team at OCRC and CAREX
Canada. They identified the number of workers exposed
to solar radiation based on an approach similar to
the United Kingdom Burden of Occupational Cancer
Study,[23] but revised for the Canadian context.
Calculating the Attribution Factor (AF) involved three
major steps. The first was to select an appropriate relative
risk from a high-quality, epidemiological study suitable
for the Canadian context. The second step was to assess
the prevalence of exposure to UV in the Canadian work-
ing population. The prevalence was based on exposure
estimates previously developed by CAREX Canada. The
final step was population modelling. Methods were used
to model the working population in total and the working
population ever exposed to UV included in the study. The
number of workers ever exposed during the risk expo-
sure period (in this case 1961–2000) was calculated by
counting the number of all exposed workers in the first
year of the risk exposure period (i.e., 1961) and the num-
ber of exposed new hires in each subsequent year (i.e.,
1962–2000); the survival of all of these workers was then

followed to the target year (i.e., 2011). More details about
this method are described elsewhere.[24]
Direct costs
We considered healthcare costs of NMSCs at three main
phases in the cancer journey—diagnosis, treatment, and
follow-up. We turned to several studies for the computa-
tion of healthcare costs,[1,8,11,17,25] as well as the sched-
ule facility fees and physician services under the health
insurance act of Ontario, Canada.[17,26] Since healthcare
is a provincial-level jurisdiction in Canada, treatment
costs can vary to some degree from province to province.
Canada-wide estimates by health condition and/or treat-
ment paradigm are not available for BCC and SCC, hence
the reason for the use of healthcare date from Canada’
s
most populous province.
We assumed that if a worker survived 5 years after their
initial diagnosis that they were cancer free, and at that
point their risk of mortality returned to that of the gen-
eral population. We used a survival rate of 99.98% and
99.30% for of BCC and SCC, respectively, based on Lucas
et al.[27] However, different survival rate scenarios were
investigated in sensitivity analyses, ranging from 99% and
99.5% for BCC and SCC, respectively. To estimate the
healthcare-related costs of recurrence, we approximated
average recurrence rates of BCC and SCC based on the
meta-analysis of Marcil et al.,[28] at 44% and 18% for BCC
and SCC, respectively. We also estimated the probability
of conversion of BCC to SCC and vice versa at 44% and
6%, respectively, as indicated in Figure 1.
OOPCs include several costs such as travel to health-
care appointments, pharmaceuticals, vitamins, and sup-
plements, purchased home healthcare services, and hotel
accommodation costs. Since we could not identify a study
specifically on OOPCs for NMSCs in Canada, we used
OOPCs from Morries et al.[29] which were £310.7 per case
in 2002 British Pounds ($547 in 2011 Canadian dollars).
Additionally, we undertook a sensitivity analysis using a
range from $0–$2,300 per-case in 2011 Canadian dollars,
based on a Longo et al.[30]
To estimate the informal caregiving time, we divided
the treatment of NMSCs in 2 phases: local and terminal
phases. For informal caregiving cost during local disease
treatment phase, we used Bickers et al., on 2006 study,
which proposed a value of $26 per-case in 2011 Canadian
dollars.[9] For the terminal phase of the disease, which
generally requires intensive care, we used 0.08 years of
full-time caregiving, based on a World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) report.[27] We also performed a sensitivity
analysis over the range of 0 to 1 year at 6.8 hr per day,
based on Yabroff et al.[31]
Indirect costs
The
most
common
approach
to
estimate
out-
put/productivity losses is the human capital approach,
where it is assumed that losses are equivalent to
the wage value of time off work. The human capital
approach is appropriate for estimating macro-level out-
put/productivity losses at the societal level, and is used
in relevant work injury/illness burden studies.[12,14,15]
We used this approach for both paid-labor force out-
put/productivity losses and lost home production.
We considered four indirect cost categories. The first
is the time away from work seeking medical care, such
as time spent in doctors’office visits. Since we could not
find a valid estimate of the number of hours spent per
visit for NMSCs, we used the Chen et al. value at 0.9 days
(7.2 hr per-case).[11] We also performed a sensitivity anal-
ysis using a range from 5–10 working days as a rough esti-
mate for all medical seeking purposes.
The second category is morbidity costs. NMSCs are
generally caught early and treated efficiently, requiring
very little time off work for most cases, and with little
long-term consequences.[1,8] We estimated the reduced
work output/productivity associated with absenteeism
on the basis of a methodology by Kevin et al., in 2015.[32]
Specifically, to estimate the work days lost from BCC and
SCC, the disability weight (DW) of each stage of the dis-
ease is multiplied by the stage length. We used DWs from
the WHO report.[27] For BCC the DWs were 0.05, 0.2,
and 0.93 for localized, disseminated, and terminal stages,
respectively. The duration of these stages were 0.04, 2.4,
and 0.08 years, respectively.[27] For SCC we considered
two possibilities, no lymph node involvement, and lymph

485
node involvement. For the former, the DW was 0.07 and
duration 0.04 years. For lymph node involvement, the
DW was 0.3 and duration 0.06 years. The DW for reoc-
currence of SCC was 0.07 with a duration of 0.04 years.
For the disseminated and terminal phases of SCC, the
DWs were 0.2 and 0.93, and durations 1.2 and 0.08 years,
respectively.[27] Figure 2 illustrated the calculated lost
working day for each stage of BCC and SCC. We also
performed a sensitivity analysis using a range from 5 to
10 working days lost.
The third indirect cost category is the loss of future
earnings due to premature mortality. To estimate the aver-
age present value of future earnings, we considered the
number of fatalities from NMSC by age and sex, and com-
pared them to the age and sex specific fatality rates of the
general population. The present value in 2011 for labor-
market earnings losses in years after 2011 was estimated
for all paid labor-force time loss. For these estimates, we
used the age and sex-specific average wage rates taken
from the LFS,[20] plus fringe benefits of 14%, consistent
with other Canadian studies.[33] All employment rates for
the population were extracted from the 2011 LFS[20] and
the 2007 SLID.[34] The LFS aggregates individuals above
the age of 70, so the SLID public use file was used to get
more granularity above age 70. A technical appendix sum-
marizes the formulas for calculating output/productivity
losses used for this study.
The fourth indirect cost category is home production
losses associated with morbidity and premature mortal-
ity. In order to calculate this cost category, we identified
the average time that men and women spend on various
domestic related activities from the GSS.[21] The mone-
tary value of time in home production was estimated at
the average hourly earnings for housekeepers and related
occupations (occupation code 4412, $15.40 in 2011
Canadian dollars), based on SEPH.[22] For morbidity, we
estimated the potential home production losses based on
the DWs and length of the disease stage. For terminal
cases, home production was assumed to be zero, as cases
usually lose their ability to perform daily domestic activ-
ities. For mortality, we estimated home production losses
over the remaining standard life expectancy.
Intangible costs
Intangible costs (HRQoL costs) were captured through
QALYs proxied with the HUI and then converted into
monetary units using a value of $50,000 per QALY.[35,36]
We identified HUI values of BCC and SCC for the local
disease at 0.97 based on Chen et al.,[37] and 0.67 for ter-
minal cases based on Gaulin et al.[38] Case QALYs were
compared with population average QALYs, adjusted for
age, sex, and population life expectancy. We also con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis for this component using
alternative monetary value of a QALY of, $100,000 and
$150,000. The $50,000 rate has been used in Canada since
the early 1990 s in the health technology assessment field.
The $150,000 value is more reflective of willingness-to-
pay values for a QALY identified in recent studies.[39,40]
The $100,000 value is the midpoint between the two.
Results
There were 53,696 newly diagnosed cases of BCC and
18,549 newly diagnosed cases of SCC in Canada in 2011.
As is illustrated in Table 2, based on OCRC estimates,
5.3% (2,846 cases) of BCC cases and 9.2% (1,710 cases)
of SCC cases are attributable to occupational exposure to
solar radiation.

rate of occupational NMSCs by age and sex group. For
both sexes the age group of 65–69 has the highest rate

of BCC and 70–74 has the highest rate of SCC. There
were notable differences between men and women in the
incidence of NMSCs attributable to occupational expo-
sures. As expected, due to most outdoor workers being
men, they have much higher occupational BCC incidence
(9.0% of all cases) and occupational SCC (14.0% of all
cases). For women, 1.3% of all NMSCs were attributable to
occupational exposure (1.2% of occupational BCC, 1.7%
of SCC), compared to 10.4% for men (see Table 2 for
details).
Figure 4 presents the distribution of occupational BCC
and SCC cases by province. The estimated percentage
of cancer cases attributable to occupational solar radi-
ation exposure varies from the lowest percentages in
Ontario to the highest in the province of Saskatchewan.
However, data presented excludes the Yukon, Northwest
Territories, and Nunavut, as there was not sufficient data
to estimate cases for the territories. The provinces of

Ontario (BCC: 868, SCC: 521) and Quebec (BCC: 622,
SCC: 388) have the highest numbers of cases, which is due
to their relatively large populations. The proportion of
occupationally attributed NMSCs in Ontario and Quebec
is 4.2% and 4.6% for BCC, and 7.4% and 8.5% for SCC,
respectively. The highest proportion of occupationally
attributed NMSCs is in Saskatchewan, where 11.1% of
BCCs and 17.7% of SCCs are estimated to be caused by
work-related sun exposure.
Table 3 summarizes the direct, indirect and intangi-
ble costs of BCC and SCC. Direct costs are estimated at
$14.4 million ($5,066 per-case) for BCC and $5.5 mil-
lion ($3,198 per-case) for SCC. The total indirect costs
are $1.1 million ($401 per-case) for BCC and $7.5 mil-
lion ($4,379 per-case) for SCC. The estimated intangible
costs for BCC and SCC are 0.6 million ($202 per-case) and
$5.1 million ($2,978 per-case), respectively.
As illustrated in Table 4, the sensitivity analyses indi-
cated that the total BCC economic burden could be as low
as $15.1 million and as high as $49.9 million, based on dif-
ferent assumptions for key parameters. For SCC, the range
is $14.9 million to $29.3 million. Using different values for
the monetary value of a QALY of $100,000 and $150,000
rather than $50,000 results in a change in total costs from
3.6–7.1% for BCC and 32.3–62.5% for SCC (see the Tech-
nical Appendix for details).
To estimate a comparable burden for the U.S., we
considered the incidence of NMSCs in the U.S. from the
Guy et al. study (4.3 million in 2011).[41] We assumed that
6.3% of all NMSC cases in the U.S. in 2011 (271,158 cases),
were attributable to occupational sun exposure (similar to
our study). We also assumed that the treatment methods
and related costs are likely similar in both countries.
Based on our conservative assumptions, we estimated the
economic burden of occupational NMSCs in 2011 in the
U.S. at $1.7 billion Canadian dollars. Since this calcula-
tion does not account for differences in the composition
of the workforce or exposure differences associated with
latitude (i.e., there are likely a higher number of cases per
capita due to the lower latitude of the U.S.), it is likely that
the estimate is low. It may also be low due to higher health
care costs in the U.S. Thus, this example provides only a

starting point for using our numbers to estimate burdens
in other countries. For more precise country estimates,
multiplier might be developed to adjust various cost
components we have estimated for Canada.
Discussion
Our estimate of attributable fractions for occupational
solar UV radiation exposure are 5.3% of newly diagnosed
BCC cases and 9.2% of newly diagnosed SCC in 2011.
Our estimate of the economic burden of newly diagnosed
occupational NMSCs in Canada is $28.9 million for direct
and indirect costs. Breakdown of our estimates between
direct and indirect cost indicated that 70% of NMSC costs
are associated with direct costs and 30% with indirect
costs. Intangible costs are estimated at $5.7 million based
on a value of $50,000 per QALY. We present direct and
indirect costs separately from intangible costs due to pos-
sible overlap in these costs. Specifically, estimates of the
value of a QALY may include output/productivity losses,
since it is difficult to separate out HRQoL from other val-
ues derived from health.
This is the first study to exclusively consider occupa-
tional NMSCs, rather than all-cause NMSCs, therefore it
is difficult to compare our estimated values with those
found in the published literature. All of the quoted NMSC
per-case costs from the literature are well below our esti-
mate of $5,670 for BCC and $10,555 for SCC, respectively.
For example, Krueger and colleagues estimated the direct
costs for BCC and SCC at $536 and $812 in 2011 Cana-
dian dollars,[1] which is much lower than our direct costs.
One of the reasons is that they only considered medical
treatment costs, including primary care, hospital-based
day surgery, and hospital inpatient care. Treatment costs
associated with recurrences were not considered. They
also did not consider informal caregiving and OOPCs in
their direct costs calculation. They estimated the aver-
age indirect costs per-case of BCC and SCC at $445 and
$2,392 in 2011 Canadian dollars, respectively. They used
the algorithm developed by Lucas et al.,[42] to determine
the level of disability and the associated value of work-
loss days following a diagnosis of BCC or SCC. They
also attempted to address time costs such as unpaid work
and leisure time to value what they describe as non-
productive time. However, they did not include costs such
as home production losses. Breakdown of their reported
costs indicated that 41% of NMSC costs are attributed to
direct costs and 59% attributed to indirect costs.
In the Orenstein et al. study in Alberta, Canada,
researchers reported estimated per-case direct and indi-
rect costs of NMSCs at $2,714 and $818 in 2011 Canadian
dollars, respectively.[8] These direct costs refer to health-
care expenditures by the government for the costs of
treating these cancer patients, but they did not include
OOPCs, nor informal caregiving costs in their direct
costs calculation. In terms of indirect costs for calculating
absenteeism, they only considered time seeking medical
care (based on study of Chen et al.),[43] however, this
value is a part of total lost time, as the episodes of disease

care includes other episodes such as illness episodes,
disease episodes, health maintenance episodes, and care
episodes.[11] They also did not consider home produc-
tion losses. Breakdown of their reported attributable costs
indicated that 77% of total NMSC costs were direct costs
and 23% were indirect costs.
Bickers et al. reported the direct and indirect costs of
NMSCs in the US at $1,487 and $985 per-case in 2011
Canadian dollars, respectively.[9] In terms of direct cost,
although they considered different costs categories that
relate to the hospital stays, doctors’office visits, prescrip-
tion drugs, and OOPCs in their calculations, they did
not consider informal caregiving costs, but rather, put
it under indirect costs. This may be one of the reasons
that their indirect costs were higher than other studies.
In their study, authors considered different indirect costs
categories such as time spent seeking healthcare, lost or
impaired ability to work, caregiver costs and premature
mortality, but they did not consider home production loss
costs. Breakdown of their reported costs indicated that
60% of total NMSC costs were attributed to direct and
40% attributed to indirect costs. The ratio of the intan-
gible costs to the total direct and indirect costs was just
5%.
Kyle et al. reported direct costs of BCC and SCC at
$2,545 and $6,449 per-case in 2011 Canadian dollars,
respectively.[10] They did not report the average cost per-
cases for NMSCs. In terms of the direct costs, they only
considered healthcare and did not include the OOPCs and
caregiver costs. In terms of indirect costs, they considered
the loss of productivity as a result of premature deaths,
as well as caregiving performed by others, However, they
did not include lost home production. Breakdown of BCC
reported costs indicated that 46% of the costs were direct
and 54% were indirect. The percentage of direct and indi-
rect costs for SCC were 18% and 82%, respectively.
The magnitude and proportion of costs attributable
to direct and indirect costs of NMSCs varies widely in
the scientific literature, as indicated in previous studies
such as Doran et al.[44] Different studies have considered
different cost elements in their direct and indirect cost
components. In general, the main reason for our costs
being higher than values from other studies is that we
were able to include more cost elements. Our methodol-
ogy includes many subcomponents of direct and indirect
costs, based on previous frameworks and methodological
approaches.[13]
Lack of data for key inputs has often been cited as
a limitation in occupational disease burden studies, and
this is also the case with our study. Some assumptions
(and sometimes compromises) were made to address data
gaps. Our estimates are nonetheless underestimates, since
not all resource implications of occupational NMSCs were
included. This is because we lacked key data sources. For
example, we did not include the effect of poor health
on work performance, or presenteeism (working while in
poor health).[45] Presenteeism can decrease worker’
s pro-
ductivity in the pre-diagnosis and after return to work
periods. It is highly recommended that it be included
as a factor in future studies to avoid underestimation of
impacts on productivity. Additionally, we included in our
calculations time off work for recovery, but we did not
consider time off work for diagnostic procedures. Fur-
thermore, the costs of lost work time can be substantially
higher than the wage when perfect substitution of absent
workers is not possible. This can also be a problem when
there are team-based projects that require all workers to
be present for full functioning, or where a penalty is asso-
ciated with not meeting deadlines.[46,47]
Lack of data sources with which to develop our OOPCs
estimates is another limitation. Since OOPCs can be
markedly different for rural versus urban residents, we
used an average value based on comparable studies and
ran a sensitivity analysis for upper and lower limits of
OOPCs. Lastly, we had data limitations in relation to
return to work of cases with BCC and SCC.[48]
To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the
economic burden of occupational NMSCs attributable to
solar radiation exposure has been estimated in Canada
or elsewhere. We have attempted to be as comprehensive
as possible in identifying the resource implications under
three broad cost categories—direct, indirect, and intan-
gible costs. Despite some uncertainties from required
assumptions, the obtained results are as robust as possible,
and the structure of the model gives insight into the total
costs breakdown, pointing out the most relevant variables
such as survival rate. The present study captured a signif-
icant portion of the economic burden of NMSCs that is
sometimes described as the “hidden part of the iceberg of
costs” in occupational health and safety.[49] Future stud-
ies should attempt to account for a broader set of resource
implications than those we included in the categories of
direct, indirect, and intangible costs, in order to capture a
larger part of the “hidden iceberg of costs.”
Conclusions
This study is part of a growing literature which attempts
to put a monetary value on the costs of occupational
carcinogen exposures. We anticipate that this study will
provide insights for policy makers who make decisions
about occupational cancer prevention resource alloca-
tions. Case-costing information from this study can also
be used as an input for studies evaluating interventions
to reduce occupational UV exposure in terms of their
cost-benefit/cost-effectiveness. Thus, the results of this

study can assist researchers interested in demonstrating
the monetary impact of decreasing or eliminating occu-
pational solar radiation exposures through various pre-
vention measures.
