Adequate statistical power in
clinical trials is associated with
the combination of a male first
author and a female last author
Abstract Clinical trials have a vital role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of new treatments and interventions in
medicine. A key characteristic of a clinical trial is its statistical power. Here we investigate whether the statistical
power of a trial is related to the gender of first and last authors on the paper reporting the results of the trial.
Based on an analysis of 31,873 clinical trials published between 1974 and 2017, we find that adequate statistical
power was most often present in clinical trials with a male first author and a female last author (20.6%, 95%
confidence interval 19.4-21.8%), and that this figure was significantly higher than the percentage for other gender
combinations (12.5-13.5%; P<0.0001). The absolute number of female authors in clinical trials gradually increased
over time, with the percentage of female last authors rising from 20.7% (1975-85) to 28.5% (after 2005). Our results
demonstrate the importance of gender diversity in research collaborations and emphasize the need to increase the
number of women in senior positions in medicine.

Introduction
There is increasing awareness that many clinical
trials have systematic methodological flaws and
that their results may be biased, exaggerated,
and difficult to reproduce (Ioannidis et al.,
2014). Clinical trials are the result of complex
group efforts. Male and female researchers dif-
fer
in
their
collaborative
strategies
which
depends on the level of their expertise and
whether they have a junior or senior position
(Zeng et al., 2016; Bozeman and Gaughan,
2011). There are indications that mixed gender
teams may make the best use of personal knowl-
edge and skills, (Nielsen et al., 2017) an effect
also reported in a scientific research context
(Woolley et al., 2010; Campbell et al., 2013).
Even though this may in turn positively influence
the quality of clinical research, (Nielsen et al.,
2017) no studies have systematically investi-
gated whether collaborations between male and
female researchers affect the quality of clinical
trials. This topic is important in light of the exist-
ing diversity challenges that currently exist in the
biomedical research field (Valantine and Collins,
2015).
In this study, we therefore aimed to quantify
the effect of collaborations across gender com-
binations of junior and senior authors on the
methodological quality of clinical trials. To this
aim, we determined the percentage of ade-
quately powered trials in 31,873 clinical trials
published between 1974 and 2017 based on
Cochrane meta-analyses. As statistical power
reflects the chance of detecting a true effect, it
is regarded as one of the key elements of
responsible research (Button et al., 2013) and
considered
essential
in
reproducible
clinical
research (Halpern et al., 2002). We found that
the probability of having adequate statistical
power for one combination - male first author,
female last author - was significantly higher than

Results
Statistical power and gender combinations
in all clinical trials (N=31,873)
In our 31,873 trials, the number of published
clinical trials with adequate statistical power
(>80%) was generally low (12-13%; Figure 1A,
left panel). The exception was the set of trials
with a male first author combined with a female
last author with 20.6% of outcomes adequately
powered (CI 19.4–21.8). This percentage was
significantly higher in comparison to the three
other combinations (highest odds ratio 2.08, CI
1.87–2.30, P<0.0001). Cut-off values for ade-
quate power set to either 70% or 90% yielded
comparable results (P<0.0001; Figure 1B). The
percentage
of
adequately
powered
trials
in
which the gender combination was unknown
was 13.8% (CI 13.6–14.1; Figure 1C). Irrespec-
tive of the gender of the first author, clinical tri-
als
with
female
last
authors
had
a
higher
statistical power compared to male last authors:
16.6% (CI 15.9–17.4) versus 12.9% (CI 12.6–13.3;
Figure 2). The average statistical power of clini-
cal trials with missing gender was comparable to
those
with
known
gender
combinations
(Figures 1C and 2). Slightly higher odds for ade-
quately powered trials were also found in the
author combination ‘both males’ and ‘female –
male (last)’ in comparison to the reference group
‘both females’: odds ratios 1.28 (CI 1.17–1.41,
P<0.0001) and 1.25 (CI 1.13–1.39, P<0.0001),
respectively (Table 1). In the sensitivity analysis
model estimates were slightly lower (relative
estimate difference 2.3% to 4.8%; Table 2).
Trends across countries
The world map in Figure 3 shows the geograph-
ical distribution of the trials in our sample (based
on affiliation of the first author). The percentage
of trials originating from Anglosphere countries
(United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand) was 46.9%; the percent-
age from European countries was 32.9%; and
the percentage from non-western countries was
20.2% (with the top five being Turkey, Japan,
India, China and Israel). European trials had
lower odds of adequate statistical power com-
pared to Anglosphere trials (odds ratio: 0.76, CI
0.71–0.81, P<0.0001; Figure 4A). This was also
the case in trials from Non-western countries

Table 1). Individual country data, from the sensi-

Trends over time
The percentage of adequately powered trials
with a male first author and a female last author
increased over time, and was higher than the
percentage for other combinations in the last
three decades of the study (Figure 1A, right
panel). According to a logistic regression multi-
variable model (see "Data analysis and statistical
model") the odds ratio of adequate statistical
power increased each year (odds ratio: 1.03, CI:
1.02–1.03, P<0.0001; Figure 4B).
Trends across medical fields
The higher percentage of adequately powered
clinical trials with a combination of a male first
author
and
a
female
last
author
was
not
restricted
to
specific
medical
disciplines,
although the effect sizes differed across disci-
plines (Figure 5). The medical fields with a rela-
tive low odds for adequate statistical power in
general, as determined with the multivariable
model, are: ‘complementary medicine’, ‘endo-
crine & metabolic’, ‘gastroenterology & hepatol-
ogy’, ‘genetic disorders’, ‘health & safety at
work’ and ‘heart & circulation’, all with signifi-
cant odds ratios below 0.3 compared to the ref-
erence field allergy and intolerance (Table 1).
The fields with most pronounced higher statisti-
cal power for male first and female last author
were ‘pregnancy & childbirth’, ‘gynaecology’,
‘lungs & airways’, ‘gastroenterology & hepatol-
ogy’ and ‘tobacco, drugs & alcohol’. The total
number of trials for each of the four gender
combinations was not equally distributed. Most
trials were published by the male–male author
combination (Figure 6), and this inequality in the
gender of authors was found across major medi-
cal disciplines (Figure 6). Nevertheless, the num-
ber of clinical trials with a male first and last
author decreased from 64.8% in the period
1975–1985 (CI 61.9–67.6) to 49.0% after 2005
(CI 48.4–49.6; Figure 7).
Correction for potential confounders
To correct for the potential confounders at the
country level, the year of publication, and the
medical discipline, logistic regression was per-
formed. The linear combination of the variables
‘author
combination’,
‘year
of
publication’,
‘country’ and ‘medical discipline’ explained the
presence or absence of adequate statistical

Adequate statistical power in clinical trials
 power well in a multivariable logistic regression
model (c2Zeng et al., 2016 = 1146.5 (degree-
of-freedom 36), P<0.0001). The four author com-
binations were overall different from each other
(c2Zeng et al., 2016 = 440.5 (4), P<0.0001). The
model estimates are provided in Table 1. A sen-
sitivity analysis with ‘country’ defined as individ-
ual countries rather than groups of countries did
not significantly change the other variable model
estimates
(Table
2).
The
sensitivity
model
explained the presence or absence of adequate
statistical power very well in a multivariable
logistic regression model (c2Zeng et al., 2016 =
3638.6 (degree-of-freedom 101), P<0.0001). The
four author combinations in the sensitivity analy-
sis were also overall different from each other
(c2Zeng et al., 2016 = 488.2 (4), P<0.0001).
Discussion
The analysis of 31,873 clinical trials published
between 1974 and 2017 demonstrates that ade-
quately powered clinical trials are relatively more
often published by a combination of a male first
author and a female last author compared to
other
gender
combinations.
This
effect
was
robust as the effect was present across countries
and most medical fields. Even though the aver-
age statistical power was generally low, the
overall percentage of adequately powered trials
slightly increased over the past four decades.
In line with recent literature, (West et al.,
2013) the absolute number of clinical trials pub-
lished by female authors remained relatively low,
even though it increased over time. The effects
of equal representation of male and female sci-
entists are not only important to better under-
stand the success of collaborative efforts, but
are also pressing in light of the persistent gen-
der gap in medicine. Despite improvements,
female scientists continue to face unequal pay
(Rimmer,
2017)
and
funding

(Shen, 2013), and to remain underrepresented

and

publications
(Jagsi et al., 2006; Reed et al., 2011), even
though gains in participation have been made
over the last years (Filardo et al., 2016). Inde-
pendent of gender, the overall percentage of
adequately powered clinical trials was disap-
pointingly low, notwithstanding the fact that the
practice of conducting clinical trials with low sta-
tistical power has been denounced for a long
time (Halpern et al., 2002; Ioannidis, 2005). On
a more positive note, the percentage of ade-
quately powered trials did increase slightly over
the past four decades. A possible reason for this
increase may be the obligation to register clini-
cal trials (i.e., on platforms like clinicaltrials.gov).
This may have caused an increase in pre-registra-
tions and research protocols with a higher qual-
ity and commitment to the original research plan
and proposed sample size.
Our results support previous reports that
gender differences exist and may influence the
quality of clinical trials (Campbell et al., 2013;
Nielsen et al., 2017). It may also be influenced
by collaboration style patterns as differences
exist between men and women in mixed-sex
interactions (Balliet et al., 2011). Firm evidence
on the influence of collaborative styles is still
lacking. (Zeng et al., 2016; Arau
´jo et al., 2017)
However, the impact of social behavior between
clinical researchers on trial outcomes – particu-
larly related to gender - is yet a rather unex-
plored area. It is important to note that not all
studies have found convincing evidence for gen-
der differences in science, (Hyde, 2005) for
example with regard to bias (Fanelli et al.,
2017). From our results, it could be hypothe-
sized that collaborations between male and
female researchers are beneficial with respect to
cross-fertilization,
team
productivity
and
research efficacy. However, our understanding
of social and gender-related factors that under-
lie clinical trial quality is probably still limited,
which is underlined by our finding that the statis-
tical power of trials is relatively low when both
first and last author are female.
Because our analyses are based on a compre-
hensive body of clinical trials published over a
40-year period, across medical fields, the results
provide a representative picture of the relation
between gender collaborations and statistical
power. Nonetheless, there are several limita-
tions. First, we only investigated one aspect of
methodological rigor. Even though statistical
power is an important sign of sound trial con-
duct, there are other domains, including pre-
post registration mismatch and other sources of
bias that determine methodological rigor. These
parameters, however, are more difficult to quan-
tify. Second, gender from the first and last
author
could
not
be
determined
for
most
included clinical trials (almost 70%, see flow dia-
gram) as not all first name records were avail-
able. However, the statistical power of trials with
missing gender data was not different from the
clinical trials with known gender. Third, first and
last authorships only provide a relative rough
proxy for junior and senior positions. The actual
hierarchical relations in a clinical trial may differ

Adequate statistical power in clinical trials
 take
other
methodological
outcomes
into
account, such as the risk of bias and deviations
from the pre-registered protocol. Also, to fur-
ther determine how the gender of a researcher
impacts on the scientific methodological quality,
a more qualitative research design would be
necessary to explore on a deeper level why
methodological quality of clinical trials depends
on the gender of researchers and clinicians. This
would include interviews and observation studies
of clinical trial teams with male and female lead-
ership positions. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of gender diversity in research col-
laborations and emphasize the need for more
prominent positions for women at senior posi-
tions in medicine (Nature, 2013).
Materials and methods
Selection of clinical trials
The selection of trials for this analysis is shown in
a flow chart (Figure 8). Clinical trials were
extracted from the Cochrane Database of Sys-
tematic Reviews. Only the subset of trials was
included in the analysis where the first name of
the first and last author were reported. These
reviews cover all medical fields and have high
quality standards and methodological rigor with
elaborate search protocols, and rigorously iden-
tify
and
summarize
comparable
trials
(Jørgensen
et
al.,
2006).
Moreover,
these
reviews perform meta-analyses on individual clin-
ical trials to generate an estimated effect size of
interventions. All clinical trials with a PubMed ID
included in a systematic review published in the
second Issue of the 2017 Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were extracted using
an in-house developed, open-source Cochrane
Library website parser. For each individual clini-
cal trial, we extracted publication year, outcome
estimates (odds or risk ratio, risk difference or
standardized mean difference), and Cochrane’s
medical discipline classifications.
Statistical power of individual clinical trials
Statistical power was assessed in clinical trials,
published after 1974, which were included in a
Cochrane meta-analysis with a significant overall
estimate (i.e., a meta-analytic P-value of <0.05).
All data and scripts are available via the Open
Science Framework (WM Otte, Temporal RCT

interval for proportions. (B) A logistic regression multivariable model (see "Data analysis and
statistical model" below) can be used to predict the probability that a trial will have a power
above a certain value. Here the predicted probabilities that trials will have power > 0.8 are
plotted as a function of year for the four gender combinations in the three country groups.
The predicted probabilities are averaged across medical disciplines and plotted as mean
and 95% confidence intervals.

 effects. In other words, if a confidence interval
of a meta-analysis contains 0, the point estimate
of the overall effect size is not reliable nor
known and may not be used to estimate the
individual power of studies included in that
meta-analysis. Nevertheless, inclusion of non-sig-
nificant meta-analyses did not impact on our
findings (data not shown).
The power for an individual clinical trial was
calculated based on the sample sizes in both
trial arms, using a 5% a threshold using the
meta-analytic estimate as approximation of the
true effect size. Trials with a statistical power
lower than 80% were considered to be under-
powered
based
on
historical
arguments
(Moher et al., 1994). This cut-off is standard but
also relatively arbitrary. We therefore also per-
formed analyses using a less and more conserva-
tive cut-off of 70% and 90%, respectively. The
statistical power is presented in all plots with
95% confidence intervals determined with the
Wilson’s score method (Wilson, 1927).
Gender extraction
All included trials had multiple authors. We con-
sidered the first author of clinical trial publication
as a junior researcher and the last author as a
senior. This assumption will most likely reflect
the hierarchal relationship in the majority of the
cases. The senior author having the last position
in publications has long been practiced in medi-
cine. Typically, the person conducting the practi-
cal research, analyzing the data, and drafting the
first manuscript is often the first author, while
the last author is the senior research responsible
for the overall oversight.
For the gender of authors, first names were
extracted for the first and the last author for all
included clinical trials using the online interface

were then converted to male and female proba-
bilities with the application programming inter-
face (API) of Genderize (http://genderize.io/).
This API compares first names against a data-
base containing over 216,000 distinct names
from 79 countries and 89 languages based on
millions of public profiles and their gender data
in major social networks. Accuracy of female and
male classification with this API, compared with
open-source gender prediction tools, is excel-
lent (Wais, 2016). A recent validation study
reported female and male classification preci-
sions
of
95%
and
98%,
respectively
(Karimi et al., 2016). Gender probabilities were
dichotomized
to
obtain
binary
male/female
labels. Trials with unknown gender data for
either the first or last author were not included
in the analysis. Missing first names caused most
of the unknown genders. For some first names
no gender data was available in the gender
database (<5%).
Data analysis and statistical model
Clinical trials with adequate statistical power,
more than 80%, were identified for all four com-
binations of the gender of first and last author
(i.e.
female–female,
male–male,
female–male
and male–female).
To correct for potential cultural differences
we determined the author’s institutional country
based on the given affiliation. We only deter-
mined this for the first author as affiliations for
co-authors are added to the PubMed database
only since 2014. We categorized the countries
into three main groups based on prevalence.
The Anglosphere countries are those where
English is the main native language, the Euro-
pean countries, except for the United Kingdom
but
including
Ireland,
were
categorized

classifica-
tions. To exclude selection bias, statistical power
was determined for all clinical trials with missing
gender data. To ascertain that results were not
due to disproportionate female underrepresen-
tation in older trials, the absolute number of clin-
ical
trials
for
the
four
different
gender
combinations was also calculated.
The data were modeled with logistic regres-
sion. In this model the log odds of the dichoto-
mous outcome variable, namely trial ‘adequate
power’, was modeled as a linear combination of
predictor variables. We used the glm function in
R software version 3.2.0. The variable ‘author
combination’ was added as a factor to the
model,
with
the
author
combination
‘both
females’ as reference group. The three covari-
ates included were ‘publication year’, ‘country’
and ‘medical field’. The model fit was investi-
gated with the significance of the overall model.
This c (Zeng et al., 2016) test determines
whether the model with predictors fits signifi-
cantly better than a so called null model with
just an intercept. The 95% confidence intervals
for the estimated coefficients were determined
with
the
profiled
log-likelihood
function
(Venzon and Moolgavkar, 1988).. The esti-
mates were exponentiated to interpret them as
odds-ratios. The overall effect of ‘author combi-
nation’ in the model was tested with the Wald
test. We determined the model’s predicted
probabilities and their 95% confidence intervals
over time. We considered a P-value<0.005 as
significant (Benjamin et al., 2018). We per-
formed a sensitivity analysis with the ‘country’
variable not specified into three main categories
but into individual country categories, if a mini-
mal of fifty entries per country were present.
