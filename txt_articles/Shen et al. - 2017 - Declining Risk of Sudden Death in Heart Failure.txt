BACKGROUND
The risk of sudden death has changed over time among patients with symptomatic 
heart failure and reduced ejection fraction with the sequential introduction of medi-
cations including angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor 
blockers, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. We sought to 
examine this trend in detail.
METHODS
We analyzed data from 40,195 patients who had heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction and were enrolled in any of 12 clinical trials spanning the period from 
1995 through 2014. Patients who had an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator at 
the time of trial enrollment were excluded. Weighted multivariable regression was 
used to examine trends in rates of sudden death over time. Adjusted hazard ratios 
for sudden death in each trial group were calculated with the use of Cox regression 
models. The cumulative incidence rates of sudden death were assessed at different 
time points after randomization and according to the length of time between the 
diagnosis of heart failure and randomization.
RESULTS
Sudden death was reported in 3583 patients. Such patients were older and were 
more often male, with an ischemic cause of heart failure and worse cardiac function, 
than those in whom sudden death did not occur. There was a 44% decline in the rate 
of sudden death across the trials (P 
= 
0.03). The cumulative incidence of sudden 
death at 90 days after randomization was 2.4% in the earliest trial and 1.0% in 
the most recent trial. The rate of sudden death was not higher among patients 
with a recent diagnosis of heart failure than among those with a longer-standing 
diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS
Rates of sudden death declined substantially over time among ambulatory patients 
with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who were enrolled in clinical trials, 
a finding that is consistent with a cumulative benefit of evidence-based medica-
tions on this cause of death. (Funded by the China Scholarship Council and the

any patients with heart failure 
and reduced ejection fraction die sud-
denly, often owing to a ventricular ar-
rhythmia.1 Implantable cardioverter–defibrillators 
(ICDs) reduce this risk and are currently recom-
mended in patients with New York Heart Asso-
ciation (NYHA) functional class II or III symp-
toms and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 
35% or less, regardless of cause.2-5 However, 
ICDs are costly, have occasional complications 
early after implantation (e.g., infection), and may 
have later adverse outcomes including inappro-
priate shocks and device malfunction that lead, 
in some patients, to a diminished quality of life.6
The currently recommended medications for 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, in-
cluding angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers,7,8 
beta-blockers,9 and mineralocorticoid-receptor 
antagonists,10 reduce the risk of sudden death. 
After the accrual of evidence from randomized, 
controlled trials, these drugs have increasingly 
been used in combination, with the latest guide-
lines recommending treatment with all three in 
most patients. More recently, combination ther-
apy with sacubitril and valsartan resulted in a 
lower risk of sudden death than the ACE inhibi-
tor enalapril.11 With the increasing use of evi-
dence-based medications, rates of sudden death 
over time may have diminished such that ICDs 
may not significantly reduce overall mortality 
when added to appropriate medical therapy in 
some groups of patients, such as those with non-
ischemic cardiomyopathy.12 To investigate this 
issue, we examined the risk of sudden death dur-
ing follow-up in 12 randomized, controlled trials 
involving patients with symptomatic heart failure 
with reduced ejection fraction that were conduct-
ed during the period from 1995 through 2014.
Methods
Population of Patients
We attempted to obtain patient-level data from 
all randomized trials enrolling more than 1000 
broadly representative patients with chronic am-
bulatory and symptomatic (NYHA class II, III, or 
IV) heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(≤40%) that were conducted over the past 20 years 
and that included adjudication of cause of death 
(excluding trials in which all the patients in each 
randomized group had an ICD) (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org). Among 42 trials 
identified, 20 trials were excluded for the reasons 
indicated in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. A total of 22 trials were eligible for inclu-
sion in our analysis, but data were not obtained 
for 10 of them (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix), so 12 trials were included in this 
analysis (Table 1). The design and results of 
these trials have been published in detail,2,13-23 
and their main characteristics are summarized 
in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Outcome of Interest
In the present study, the outcome of interest was 
sudden death. The adjudication of sudden death 
in each trial was carried out by an independent 
committee in a blinded fashion with the use of 
prespecified criteria. Similar but not identical 
criteria were used in most trials (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The cumulative inci-
dence rates of sudden death in each trial were 
calculated at 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days, 
1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after randomization. 
The risk of sudden death was also calculated 
according to the length of time between the 
diagnosis of heart failure and randomization 
(≤3 months, >3 to 6 months, >6 to 12 months, 
>1 to 2 years, >2 to 5 years, or >5 years).
Adjustment for Potential Confounding 
Variables
We examined the confounding effect of a number 
of baseline variables on the risk of sudden death, 
including age, sex, left ventricular ejection frac-
tion, NYHA class, cause (ischemic vs. nonische-
mic), previous myocardial infarction, and history 
of hypertension or diabetes; these data had been 
collected in all the trials. The estimated glomeru-
lar filtration rate (GFR) was not available in most 
patients in the two CHARM (Candesartan in 
Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mor-
tality and Morbidity) trials (measured only in 
patients from North America).18,19 The plasma 
level of N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP) was measured only in Val-HeFT 
(Valsartan Heart Failure Trial),17 CORONA (Con-
trolled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart 
Failure),20 GISSI-HF (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio 
della Sopravvivenza nell’Insufficienza Cardiaca 
Heart Failure Trial),21 and the PARADIGM-HF 
(Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ACEI to 
Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Mor-
bidity in Heart Failure)23 trial. We examined the

Declining Risk of Sudden Death in Heart Failure

mated GFR and the NT-proBNP level on sudden 
death in patients with full data and after impu-
tation of missing values.
Statistical Analysis
The characteristics of all the patients at baseline, 
and the characteristics of the patients with sud-
den death and those without, in each trial were 
summarized as means with standard deviations 
for continuous variables and as percentages for 
categorical variables. The characteristics at base-
line were compared between the patients with 
sudden death and those without sudden death 
with the use of Student’s t-tests for continuous 
variables and chi-square tests for categorical vari-
ables. Because NT-proBNP values were not nor-
mally distributed, they are presented as medians 
and interquartile ranges and were analyzed with 
the use of the Mann–Whitney U test.
The annual rate of sudden death in each trial 
and in each group in each trial was calculated 
per 100 patient-years. The cumulative incidence 
rates of sudden death in each trial were calcu-
lated and were also shown by means of cumula-
tive incidence curves, with the use of the non-
parametric cumulative incidence function of Fine 
and Gray,24 in which death from nonsudden 
causes was treated as a competing risk (i.e., de-
pendent censoring). The hazard ratio for sudden 
death in each trial group was calculated with the 
use of a cause-specific Cox proportional-hazards

A total of 91 patients in the BEST trial were excluded from this analysis because data from 1 patient were not available in the public-use copy  
of the BEST database we obtained from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and 90 patients had an implantable cardioverter– 
defibrillator (ICD) at the time of enrollment in the trial. A total of 829 patients in SCD-HeFT were excluded from this analysis because they 
had been randomly assigned to receive an ICD. Also excluded from this analysis for having an ICD at the time of enrollment in the trial were 
68 patients in the CHARM-Alternative trial, 100 patients in the CHARM-Added trial, 136 patients in CORONA, 293 patients in GISSI-HF, 421 
patients in the EMPHASIS-HF trial, and 1243 patients in the PARADIGM-HF trial. In addition, 461 patients in GISSI-HF were excluded from 
this analysis because they had a left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 40%.

model, and we used the placebo group of the 
earliest trial, RALES (Randomized Aldactone 
Evaluation Study),13 as the reference.
In a Cox model we then examined the asso-
ciation between calendar year and the risk of 
sudden death with adjustment for randomized 
group, with the trial as a random effect. This 
model was then further adjusted for the con-
founding variables listed above. The association 
between calendar year and the rate of sudden 
death was assessed in a multiple linear regres-
sion model with the randomization year and 
randomized group as covariates, weighted by the 
inverse variance of the rate, with the trial as a 
random effect. To examine whether, and to what 
extent, outliers influenced the overall trends, we 
undertook sensitivity analyses that excluded each 
outlier trial in turn and reproduced the regres-
sion analysis. Additional analyses were performed 
to examine the influence of the duration between 
the diagnosis of heart failure and randomization 
on the cumulative incidence of sudden death and 
to evaluate whether and how the risk of sudden 
death varied according to the left ventricular 
ejection fraction. Further details about the sta-
tistical analyses are provided in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was 
considered to indicate statistical significance. 
The cumulative incidence analysis was under-
taken with the use of R software, version 3.2.3, 
with the cmprsk package. All other data analy-
ses were performed with the use of Stata soft-
ware, version 14 (StataCorp).
Results
Study Population
We analyzed data from 40,195 patients with heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction who were 
enrolled in any of 12 clinical trials conducted 
over a 20-year period (Table 1), after excluding 
3180 patients who had an ICD or were receiving 
cardiac-resynchronization therapy with a defi-
brillator and 461 patients with a left ventricular 
ejection fraction greater than 40% in GISSI-HF. 
Of the participants included in the analysis, 
3583 (8.9%) had sudden death.
Baseline Characteristics of Study Population
The characteristics of the patients in each trial 
are summarized in Table S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix. The mean age of the patients 
across the trials was 65 years, and 77% of the 
patients were men. Most of the patients (95%) 
had NYHA class II or III heart failure. The mean 
left ventricular ejection fraction varied across the 
trials, ranging from 23% in the BEST (Beta-
Blocker Evaluation of Survival)14 trial to 32% in 
GISSI-HF; the overall mean ejection fraction was 
28%. A total of 62% of the patients across the 
trials had an ischemic cause of heart failure. The 
use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor 
blockers was consistently high (>90%) across 
these trials (with the exception of the CHARM-
Alternative trial, which enrolled patients who 
could not take an ACE inhibitor). As a general 
trend, there was a substantially greater use of 
beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid-receptor an-
tagonists in more recent trials. An estimated 
GFR measurement was available in 36,959 pa-
tients (92%), and both the estimated GFR and 
the NT-proBNP level were available in 15,308 
patients (38%).
Baseline Characteristics of Patients  
with Sudden Death
The characteristics of the patients with sudden 
death and those without sudden death in each 
trial are shown in Table S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. Overall, older age, male sex, lower left 
ventricular ejection fraction, lower systolic blood 
pressure, higher heart rate, worse heart-failure 
symptoms, an ischemic cause of heart failure, 
and a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, 
or renal dysfunction were positively associated 
with sudden death. Patients with sudden death 
were less likely to have undergone coronary re-
vascularization than those without sudden death. 
The NT-proBNP levels were substantially higher 
in patients who had sudden death in the Val-
HeFT, CORONA, GISSI-HF, and PARADIGM-HF 
trials than in patients who did not have sudden 
death. Patients with sudden death were less 
likely than those without sudden death to have 
been treated with a beta-blocker but were more 
likely to be receiving a diuretic, digitalis, or a 
mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist.
Sudden Death Rates in Each Trial
The annual rate of sudden death fell over time, 
from 6.5% in the earliest trial (RALES, which 
was completed in 1998) to 3.3% in the most re-
cent trial (PARADIGM-HF, which was completed 
in 2014) (Table 2 and Fig. 1); the P value for 
trend was 0.02. The CORONA trial (completed in

Declining Risk of Sudden Death in Heart Failure
2007) was an outlier, with a rate of sudden death 
of 5.2% (Table 2). The rate of death from any 
cause in the CORONA trial also lay outside the 
declining trend for all trials, which suggests that 
the higher rate of sudden death was likely to be 
due to specific clinical characteristics of the 
patients in the CORONA trial; the trial enrolled 
only patients 60 years of age or older who had 
ischemic heart failure. A sensitivity analysis that 
excluded the CORONA trial showed a steeper 
trend line for sudden death over time. In the 
BEST and Val-HeFT trials, sudden death that was 
preceded by worsening of heart failure was ex-
cluded from the analyses in order to be consis-
tent with the definitions used in the remaining 
trials; a sensitivity analysis that included these 
events showed a steeper trend line for the de-
cline in sudden death over time. The proportion 
of sudden death relative to overall mortality did 
not change across trials, which indicates that 
the falling rates of sudden death were in line 
with the downward trend in the overall death 
rates. Details are provided in Figures S2, S3, and 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The rate of sudden death was lower in the 
experimental-therapy group than in the control 
group in all the trials, with the exceptions of 
Val-HeFT and GISSI-HF (Fig. 2). With adjustment 
for randomized group, with the trial as a random 
effect, there was a decline in the risk of sudden 
death of 44% over the 19 years (hazard ratio, 
0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.93; 
P 
= 
0.03). The reduction in risk over time was 
attenuated with further adjustment for baseline 
covariates (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 
0.61 to 1.32; P 
= 
0.60) although the randomized 
group remained associated with a lower risk of 
sudden death (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81 
to 0.92; P<0.001). Additional analyses that took 
into account the individual randomized groups 
in each trial are presented in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Sudden Death According to Duration  
of Follow-up and Time since Diagnosis
At 90 days after randomization, the cumulative 
incidence rates of sudden death ranged from 
2.4% (95% CI, 1.6 to 3.1) in RALES to 1.0% 
(95% CI, 0.8 to 1.3) in the PARADIGM-HF trial 
(Table 2 and Fig. 3). Generally, in each trial, 
the cumulative incidence of sudden death at 
180 days was approximately double that at 90 
days, with a similar general trend toward lower 
rates in more recent trials. This trend was evident 
through the latest follow-up interval assessed (3 
years).
The cumulative risk of sudden death during 
follow-up increased significantly according to 
the length of time between the diagnosis of 
heart failure and randomization in the nine tri-
als that had this information available (involving 
31,866 patients [79% of the total study sample]) 
(Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). There 
was no evidence that the cumulative incidence of 
sudden death among patients with recently diag-
nosed heart failure (≤3 months before random-
ization) was greater than among those with a 
longer duration of heart failure.
Sudden Death According to Left Ventricular 
Ejection Fraction
We examined the annual rate and the cumulative 
incidence rates of sudden death at different time 
intervals during follow-up according to subgroups 
that were defined according to the left ventricu-
lar ejection fraction (<30% vs. 30 to 35% and 
<25% vs. 25 to 35%) in each trial (Tables S6 and 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Generally, 
there was a downward trend in the rate of sud-
den death, similar to the trend in the entire 
population, across the trials within each of the 
ejection fraction subgroups. Consistently in each 
trial, a higher rate of sudden death was observed 
in the subgroup of patients with a lower ejection 
fraction. Details are provided in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Discussion
In this analysis involving 40,195 patients with 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who 
were enrolled in any of 12 clinical trials con-
ducted over a period of 19 years, we found that 
the rate of sudden death has declined by 44%. 
The decline in the rate of sudden death over this 
period paralleled the increasing use of evidence-
based pharmacotherapies that are known to re-
duce the incidence of sudden death. The contem-
porary cumulative incidence of sudden death 
(according to the three most recent trials in our 
study) is approximately 1% by 3 months and 2% 
or less by 6 months among patients treated with 
an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker, 
a beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid-receptor 
antagonist; the 6-month rate was 1.7% among 
patients receiving combination therapy with sac-

Declining Risk of Sudden Death in Heart Failure
ubitril and valsartan. After 3 years, the cumula-
tive incidence was 8.8%.
The decreased risk of sudden death in con-
temporary trials involving patients with a high 
use of guideline-recommended therapies, coupled 
with data from previous trials and registries on 
the likely benefits and complications of ICDs, 
suggests that it may be difficult to show a sig-
nificant benefit of ICD implantation for primary 
prevention in most patients with heart failure 
with reduced ejection fraction in the current era. 
This view is reinforced by the recent findings 
of the Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of 
ICDs in Patients with Non-ischemic Systolic 
Heart Failure on Mortality (DANISH), which 
showed no reduction in overall mortality among 
patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy with 
high rates of guideline-recommended pharma-
cologic treatment and cardiac-resynchronization 
therapy.12
Our study suggests that new efforts are 
needed to find a high-risk subgroup of patients 
who benefit from ICD implantation and in whom 
it is cost effective.25 The identification of such 
patients is important, because not all sudden 
deaths occur in patients with ischemic cardio-
myopathy in whom myocardial scar (the domi-
nant substrate for ventricular dysrhythmias) is 
present. Although the burden of myocardial scar 
may help identify patients who are at higher risk 
for sudden death, alternative risk predictors are 
needed, particularly in patients with nonischemic 
cardiomyopathies.12 Although we found some 
subgroups that had higher rates of death, well-
developed and validated prognostic models are 
needed to identify high-risk patients.
Figure 1. Trends in the Rate of Sudden Death across Trial Groups over Time.
Shown are the annual rates of sudden death per 100 patient-years. Data are shown according to the respective start 
dates of each trial. Each circle represents a group from each trial as labeled, with the control group shaded and the 
experimental-therapy group unshaded. For the SCD-HeFT trial, this analysis used the placebo group as the control 
group and the amiodarone group as the experimental-therapy group (the group of patients assigned to receive an 
implantable cardioverter–defibrillator was not used in this analysis). The center of each circle corresponds to the 
randomization year and the annual rate of sudden death in each group, and I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. 
The area of each circle represents the sample size in each group (reference sizes are shown in the key). The dotted 
line is based on the multiple linear regression of the annual rate of sudden death in each trial group with the ran-
domization year and randomization group as covariates, weighted by its inverse variance and with trial as a random 
effect. The P value for the slope represents the P value for the randomization year on the basis of the linear model.

Declining Risk of Sudden Death in Heart Failure
The rate of sudden death in our analysis was 
not higher among patients with a recent diagno-
sis of heart failure than among those with longer-
standing heart failure with reduced ejection frac-
tion; indeed, the reverse was true. Current guidance 
states that the use of evidence-based pharmaco-
logic therapy for at least 3 months is appropriate 
in most patients, with repeat measurement of the 
ejection fraction before device implantation.26 
However, in patients with a new diagnosis, the 
initiation and increase in dose of three neurohu-
moral blockers may take many weeks, and there 
is evidence that reverse remodeling is both dose-
dependent and greater with multiple drugs than 
with one or two agents.27-31 Moreover, a reduction 
in left ventricular volumes and an increase in the 
left ventricular ejection fraction may still occur 
between 6 and 12 months after the initiation of 
treatment.32 Consequently, 3 months may be too 
short a period to wait to see whether there is 
sufficient recovery of left ventricular function to 
obviate the need for an ICD.
One limitation of our study is that it is retro-
spective and based on clinical trials, in which 
the majority of patients were white and male, 
rather than in real-world cohorts in which pa-
tients tend to be older, have more coexisting 
conditions, and receive fewer, and lower doses 
of, evidence-based drugs.33-35 However, the rates 
of sudden death have also been shown to be de-
creasing among less-selected patients over a time 
span similar to that covered in our study.36 More-
over, it is in patients who are similar to those in 
the present studies that ICDs are most clearly 
indicated. The rates of sudden death that we 
found are also in keeping with a report on the 
national experience of wearable cardioverter–
defibrillators in the United States.37
Other limitations of our analysis include the 
fact that the trials we studied did not share a 
standardized definition of sudden death, although 
sensitivity analyses suggest that the lack of such 
standardization does not explain the falling rate 
of sudden death over time. The measurement of 
NT-proBNP levels, an important prognostic fac-
tor, was not available in all patients, but on the 
basis of the available data, additional adjustment 
for NT-proBNP levels did not substantially alter 
the observed decline in the rate of sudden death. 
We did not exclude patients who received an ICD 
during follow-up in each trial; the available data 
suggest that these numbers were small. Finally, 
we did not include 10 other trials that were con-
ducted during the period from 1995 through 
2014, although the characteristics of the patients 
enrolled in those trials were very similar to 
those of the patients in the included trials (Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In conclusion, the rate of sudden death 
among patients with heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction who were enrolled in clinical 
trials has fallen over the past two decades, a 
finding that is consistent with a cumulative ben-
efit of evidence-based medications on sudden 
death. The absolute rate of sudden death was 
lower among patients with a more recent diag-
nosis of heart failure than among those with a 
longer-standing diagnosis of heart failure.
