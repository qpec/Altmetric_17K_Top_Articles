Background:Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) with sickle cell disease (SCD) require opioid treatment. Despite evi-
dence to support rapid pain management within 30 minutes, care for these patients does not consistently meet
this benchmark. This quality improvement study sought to decrease the first analgesic administration time, increase
patient satisfaction, and expedite patient flow. Methods: A prospective pre-/postevaluation design was used to eval-
uate outcomes with patients 18 years or older with VOEs in an urgent care (UC) center after implementation of
evidence-based practice standard care (EBPSC). A pre- and postevaluation survey of SCD patients’ satisfaction with
care and analogous surveys of the UC team to assess awareness of EBPSC were used. A retrospective review of
the electronic medical records of patients with VOEs compared mean waiting time from triage to the first analgesic
administration and the mean length of stay (LOS) over 6 months. Results: Implementing EBPSC decreased the
mean time of the first analgesic administration (P = .001), significantly increased patient satisfaction (P = .002),
and decreased the mean LOS (P = .010). Conclusion: Implementing EBPSC is a crucial step for improving the
management of VOEs and creating a positive patient experience. The intervention enhances the quality of care for
the SCD population in a UC center.

PURPOSE AND REVIEW OF LITERATURE
Despite improving survival rates for sickle cell disease
(SCD),1 vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) remain inad-
equately managed. As a result, patients suffer need-
lessly from uncontrolled acute pain.2
SCD is an inherited blood disorder that is character-
ized by acute pain episodes. Sickled red blood cells
clump and attach to the walls of blood vessels, lead-
ing to vessel obstruction and ischemia, which, in turn,
cause tissue hypoxia and intense pain. VOEs, the clini-
cal hallmark of SCD, are the most common reason for

emergency department (ED) visits and admissions for
this population.3
Significance
SCD affects approximately 100 000 Americans,4 and an
additional 3 million carry the sickle cell trait.5 From 1989
to 1993, an average of 75 000 hospitalizations occurred
in the United States because of SCD, incurring approx-
imately $475 million in medical costs.4 Higher rates of
resource utilization among SCD patients were found
among those aged 18 to 30 years.6 Rehospitalization
rates at 30 days for SCD are 30% to 47%, and 14-day
rates are 22.1%.7
Patient experience
Negative experiences in hospital
Patients with VOEs have reported significant negative
hospital experiences, characterized by significant de-
lays in pain control, mistrust, stigmatization, lack of
autonomy over one’s treatment, negligent care, poor
monitoring of vital signs, and lack of psychosocial
support.2,8
Barriers
Inadequate acute pain management for SCD stems
partly from problems in the patient-provider relation-
ship regarding this disease. Prejudice about drug abuse
leads to disagreements between ED medical providers
and SCD patients—53% of ED physicians and 23% of
hematologists believed that more than 20% of SCD
patients were addicted to narcotics and were disin-
clined to administer high-dose, parenteral opioids due
to fears about the patient’s narcotics addiction.9,10 How-
ever, the prevalence of opioid addiction in SCD patients
is 2%—lower compared with addiction in other chronic

pain syndromes.11 Negative attitudes from providers
and lack of knowledge have been identified as crit-
ical barriers to effective pain management in SCD
and have led to poor adherence to current analgesic
protocols.12
Rapid pain management within 30 minutes from
triage for VOEs is a well-supported evidence-based
guideline for treating this population.13 Yet, despite the
literature in support of this standard of care, health care
teams remain nonadherent, leading to inadequate pain
management of SCD patients. Although this quality
improvement (QI) study was conducted in the United
States, it is applicable to practices worldwide because
inadequate management of VOEs in patients with SCD
is a global issue.14,15
Current guidelines and recommendations
A plethora of clinical guidelines exist regarding VOEs
in patients with SCD. The clear and consistent mes-
sage of these guidelines is that VOEs in patients with
SCD require rapid assessment, evaluation, administra-
tion of analgesics, and initial pain control to be per-
formed within 30 minutes of triage.3,14-23
Current evidence has demonstrated statistically sig-
nificant outcomes for SCD patients with triage guide-
lines, fast-track algorithms, ED-based pain protocols,
standardized ED analgesic protocols, and use of clinical
pathways. The success of these interventions depends
on the education of patients, nurses, and health care
providers. The outcomes of these interventions include
improved pain management, hospital revenue, utiliza-
tion of primary care clinics, and compliance with stan-
dard practice patterns and reduced admissions, length
of stay (LOS), repeat ED visits, and 30-day readmission
rates.6,17,24-30 Consequently, developing a set of quality
measures and implementing evidence-based practice
(EBP) clinical guidelines have the potential to improve
health outcomes of SCD.31,32
The purpose of this QI study was to improve the
timeliness of pain management for adult patients
with SCD who are experiencing VOEs by translating
EBP guidelines and recommended best practices into
action-oriented standard care. The aims of the project
were to decrease the time from triage until the first
analgesic administration, increase patient satisfaction
regarding acute pain control, and expedite patient flow
by implementing an evidence-based practice standard
care (EBPSC)—a visual algorithm flowchart for patients
with VOEs.
METHODS
Setting and participants
The implementation site was an urban academic ter-
tiary medical center urgent care (UC) unit. The inclusion
criteria were as follows: age 18 years or greater with
a final diagnosis of SCD crisis (ICD-10 code D57.00,
D57.219, or ICD-9 code 282.62) and treatment with
analgesics of patients while in the UC center with-
out regard to their final disposition (admitted or dis-
charged). The exclusion criteria were age less than
18 years or chief complaint unrelated to VOEs in pa-
tients with SCD. The patient sample size was estimated
by data abstraction from a prior study27 using the follow-
ing assumptions: μ (0) = 293 “known” mean value for
SCD population; μ (1) = 236 “expected” mean” value
from sample; σ (standard deviation) = 154 for the pop-
ulation; 2-sided test; α = .05; and β = .8. A sample of
58 patients per group was required to estimate a dif-
ference in time to initial administration of analgesic of
30 minutes and in LOS from triage to disposition in the
UC center.
This QI study was reviewed by the institutional re-
view board at the implementation site and granted a
waiver from informed consent on June 25, 2015.
Intervention
The EBPSC (Figure 1), including computerized triage
order sets, was developed and implemented on July
31, 2015. The 6-month period from July 31, 2014, to
January 31, 2015, served as the historical control
(“pre”), and another 6-month period, July 31, 2015,
through January 31, 2016, was defined as the in-
tervention period (“post”). The study used the same
6-month period in 2 consecutive years (2014 and 2015)
to account for any seasonal confounding variables. Staff
members attended 7 formal education workshops and
informal meetings to facilitate their understanding of
the action-oriented EBPSC before and during imple-
mentation of the EBPSC. S. K. conducted 10- to 15-
minute educational lectures during the monthly staff
meeting with PowerPoint presentations, storyboards,
academic handouts, and posters from March 2015 to
March 2016. S. K. provided 3 formal education sessions
with a 30- to 60-minute PowerPoint presentation during
provider meetings before and after the EBPSC imple-
mentation and several informal face-to-face educational
sessions during the S. K.
’s working hours.
Design
A prospective pre-/postevaluation design was used to
compare postimplementation outcomes with a preim-
plementation convenience sample of patients 18 years
or older who presented with VOEs in the UC cen-
ter. A retrospective review of the electronic medi-
cal records (EMRs) of patients with VOEs compared
mean waiting time from triage to the first analgesic
administration and the mean LOS in the UC center
during 6 months preimplementation versus 6 months
postimplementation of the EBPSC. Data were col-
lected through a pre- and postevaluation survey of SCD
patients to assess their satisfaction with the level of
pain control and through analogous surveys of staff
and providers to assess attitude and awareness of
EBPSC.
A 16-item preevaluation provider survey and a
13-item preevaluation staff survey were developed
by the S. K. and adapted from existing evidence.19
The surveys included questions regarding demograph-
ics, practice patterns, awareness of EBP guidelines,
and attitudes toward the population with SCD. To
measure providers’ and staff members’ attitudes, the

S. K. administered 2 previously validated items from
the Positive Provider Attitudes Toward Sickle Cell
Patients Scale. Haywood et al28 reported good reliability
(Cronbach α = 0.76-0.89) on attitude items. A 9-item
postevaluation provider and staff survey consisted of
items from the preevaluation survey to measure differ-
ences in practice patterns and attitudes toward SCD
patients after implementing the EBPSC. Postevalua-
tion surveys for providers and staff included questions
regarding demographics (4 items), awareness of EBP
guidelines (4 items), and attitudes toward the popula-
tion with SCD (1 item). S. K. also developed a 9-item
survey of SCD patients’ UC center experiences, based
on a literature review of acute pain management in
the ED. The patient survey was a 9-item Likert-based
scale (5 = very satisfactory; 4 = satisfactory; 3 = fair;
2 = low; 1 = very low), covering demographics (3 items)
and experience with acute pain management in the UC
center (6 items).
Data collection
Data collection began on July 31, 2014, and lasted
through January 31, 2016. The list of patients with
VOEs in the UC center was retrieved from the cod-
ing Department of Family Medicine. Pertinent data
were abstracted from the patient’s EMR. In addition,
pre- and postevaluation surveys of SCD patients, nurs-
ing staff, and providers were collected. All surveys

were anonymous. Web-based survey software, Survey
Monkey, and paper surveys were used for the providers
and staff.
Patients’ surveys were collected through a Web-
based survey software, Survey Monkey, and paper sur-
veys at community SCD support group meetings, the
bedside, and the outpatient SCD clinic.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (Chicago, Illinois), version 22.0, for
Windows. To assess the accuracy of data entry by the
S. K., O. K. reviewed the charts independently. Descrip-
tive statistics were generated for all categorical and
continuous variables for the pre- and postimplementa-
tion groups. The independent t test and the χ 2 test
were used to compare continuous and categorical data
as appropriate. Pearson’s r correlation test was used
to compute the relationship between initial analgesic
administration time (minutes) and LOS (minutes) in the
UC center from triage to disposition. A P value of less
than .05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Pre- and postimplementation group characteristics
A total of 124 (pre: 61; post: 63) adult patients with
VOEs in the UC center were included in the QI study.
Demographics and clinical characteristics are reported
in Table 1. No statistically significant differences in
group characteristics were found between the pre-
and postimplementation groups. Subject demograph-
ics and sickle genotypes were similar between the
2 groups, including age, gender, race, pain score in
triage, type of first analgesic, disposition, and whether
patients were on hydroxyurea therapy. However, pa-
tients aged between 18 and 27 years with VOEs had
the highest UC center utilization rates.
Primary outcomes
All primary outcome measures demonstrated statisti-
cally significant improvements (Table 2).
Aim 1: Mean time to first analgesic administration from
triage decreased from 92 minutes (SD = 59) to
62 minutes (SD = 37) (P = .001).

Aim 2: Patient satisfaction with acute pain manage-
ment in the UC center increased from 23% to 68%
who were satisfied before versus after implementa-
tion of the EBPSC (Fisher’s exact test P = .002). A
total of 26 preevaluation surveys and 25 postevalua-
tion surveys were collected.
Aim 3: Mean time to disposition from triage declined
significantly from 283 minutes (SD = 169) to 256
minutes (SD = 97) (P = .010).
Secondary outcomes
Initial analgesic administration time (minutes) was di-
rectly related to LOS (minutes) in the UC facility from
triage to disposition: the briefer the time between
triage and administration, the shorter the time until dis-
position (r = 0.223; total N = 124; P = .013) (Figure 2).
Pain reassessment within 30 minutes after initial anal-
gesic administration increased from 24.6% preinter-
vention to 42.9% postintervention (P = .032). Patients’
perception of receiving empathy increased from 23.1%

preintervention to 64% postintervention (Fisher’s exact
test, P = .005) and shared decision making of acute
pain management increased from 26.9% to 68%, re-
spectively (Fisher’s exact test, P = .005). Administration
of the second dose of analgesic within 30 minutes af-
ter initial analgesic dose was unchanged (P = .375) as
were 30-day readmission rate (pre: 31%; post: 19%;
P = .120) and discharged home from the UC center
(pre: 18%; post: 20.6%; P = .714) (Tables 3 and 4).
Data were collected through a pre- and postevalua-
tion survey of UC providers (pre: 15/post: 21) and staff
(pre: 14/post: 15) to assess attitudes and awareness
of the EBPSC. The results demonstrated improved
provider awareness of rapid pain management within
30 minutes from triage, from 80% preintervention to
95% postintervention (P = .254). Inadequate pain as-
sessment tools were identified by 42% of 36 providers
(pre: 15/post: 21) as the greatest barrier to rapid pain
management. Staff awareness of guidelines that re-
quired rapid pain management within 30 minutes from
triage increased from 28.6% preintervention to 100%
postintervention (χ 2 test, P = .000). Among the staff,
45% (n = 29; pre: 14/post: 15) identified lack of time
or overcrowding in the UC center as the greatest bar-
rier in the management of VOEs in patients with SCD.
The percentage of staff who believed that SCD pa-
tients were drug-addicted declined from 57.1% prein-
tervention to 33% postintervention (likelihood ratio
χ 2 = 6.723, df = 5, P = .242).
DISCUSSION
The implementation of EBPSC, including computerized
triage order sets and education for the UC team, was
associated with improvements in VOE pain manage-
ment in patients with SCD during the implementation
period. However, multiple confounding variables were
identified and potentially affected project outcomes.

had the potential to interfere with adoption among
providers and staff. Another challenge was competing
priority issues in this setting. In addition, this UC center
prioritizes patients with trauma, stroke, heart disease,
and sepsis. As a result, staff and providers cannot give
priority to hemodynamically stable SCD patients: when

priority conditions, the waiting times for SCD patients
lengthened significantly.
Barriers
Resistance to change, lack of knowledge of EBP guide-
lines, nonacceptance of the evidence, and nonadher-
ence by the UC team were barriers to be overcome.
Some providers and staff did not grasp the importance
of EBPSC for VOEs in patients with SCD. As a result,
reinforcing communication channels was critical, as
were anticipating and troubleshooting challenges dur-
ing implementation. This QI study also involved estab-
lishing a new culture of quality within the work envi-
ronment, requiring that team members follow quality
guidelines themselves and consistently observe oth-
ers taking quality-focused actions. Creating an envi-
ronment in which quality-focused behavior is the norm
can be a crucial first step in changing negative percep-
tions and stereotypes about the SCD population in the
UC team. Furthermore, improving health care teams’
knowledge of current EBP guidelines and rigorously
evaluating outcomes allow the UC team to effectively
meet population needs and understand the impact of
practices that are grounded in strong evidence.
Limitations
This report was a single-site study that was conducted
with small, convenience samples. Imperfections in
EMR could have led to inaccurate recordings. Other po-
tential sources of bias included the limitations that are

inherent to using a pre- versus postevaluation design
and the Hawthorne effect from having providers and
staff members collect UC center experience surveys
in real time from patients in their care. The identified
confounding variables might have masked an actual as-
sociation. Furthermore, because this UC unit effectively
functions as a sub-ED and thus differs from other UC
settings, the effectiveness and sustainability of the EBP
change of this project might be unsuitable for other ED
or UC settings because patient flow patterns and sever-
ity of disease differ between sites.
Implications for future research
Implementing standard care is an effective means of
translating strong evidence and experience into best
practices to optimize care. However, health care teams
and team members who harbor negative biases to-
ward SCD patients might show low adherence to new
EBPSC for acute VOE pain management. The barriers
between EBPSC and day-to-day practice by health care
team members deserve further research to improve
care for acute SCD pain in multiple settings. The high-
est UC utilization group from this study echoes that in
previous research,6 indicating that patients with SCD
rely more heavily on acute care settings for SCD care
posttransition from pediatric to adult care.33 These find-
ings emphasize the need for more research to improve
transition care in this population.
CONCLUSION
Health care teams should not ignore or underestimate
SCD patients’ pain. Implementing EBPSC and educat-
ing staff and providers about its function and need are
crucial steps for improving the pain management of
VOEs, creating a more positive patient experience, and
routinizing the standard and quality care for the SCD
population in the UC center. Even allowing for over-
crowding in acute care settings, delays in acute SCD
pain management can be overcome and the quality of
care can be improved.
