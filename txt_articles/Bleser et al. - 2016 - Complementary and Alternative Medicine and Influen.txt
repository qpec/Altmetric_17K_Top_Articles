Complementary and Alternative 
Medicine and Influenza Vaccine 
Uptake in US Children
William K. Bleser, PhD, MSPH, Bilikisu Reni Elewonibi, MPH, Patricia Y. Miranda, PhD, MPH, Rhonda BeLue, PhD, MS
abstract
BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly used in the 
United States. Although CAM is mostly used in conjunction with conventional medicine, 
some CAM practitioners recommend against vaccination, and children who saw 
naturopathic physicians or chiropractors were less likely to receive vaccines and more 
likely to get vaccine-preventable diseases. Nothing is known about how child CAM usage 
affects influenza vaccination. 
METHODS: This nationally representative study analyzed ∼9000 children from the Child 
Complementary and Alternative Medicine File of the 2012 National Health Interview 
Survey. Adjusting for health services use factors, it examined influenza vaccination odds 
by ever using major CAM domains: (1) alternative medical systems (AMS; eg, acupuncture); 
(2) biologically-based therapies, excluding multivitamins/multiminerals (eg, herbal 
supplements); (3) multivitamins/multiminerals; (4) manipulative and body-based therapies 
(MBBT; eg, chiropractic manipulation); and (5) mind–body therapies (eg, yoga).
RESULTS: Influenza vaccination uptake was lower among children ever (versus never) 
using AMS (33% vs 43%; P = .008) or MBBT (35% vs 43%; P = .002) but higher by 
using multivitamins/multiminerals (45% vs 39%; P < .001). In multivariate analyses, 
multivitamin/multimineral use lost significance, but children ever (versus never) using 
any AMS or MBBT had lower uptake (respective odds ratios: 0.61 [95% confidence interval: 
0.44–0.85]; and 0.74 [0.58–0.94]).
CONCLUSIONS: Children who have ever used certain CAM domains that may require contact 
with vaccine-hesitant CAM practitioners are vulnerable to lower annual uptake of influenza 
vaccination. Opportunity exists for US public health, policy, and medical professionals to 
improve child health by better engaging parents of children using particular domains of 
CAM and CAM practitioners advising them.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Complementary 
and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly popular 
and is implicated in supporting antivaccine viewpoints. 
Some CAM practitioners advise alternative vaccination 
schedules or against vaccination. No previous studies 
about the association of child CAM usage and infl
 uenza 
vaccination were identifi
 ed.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: US children who have ever 
used domains of CAM often requiring contact with 
CAM practitioners (eg, chiropractors, naturopathic 
physicians) have lower odds of infl
 uenza vaccination. 
Opportunity exists to improve child health by engaging 
their parents and their CAM practitioners.

Adverse effects of routinely 
recommended vaccines are markedly 
outweighed by their benefits, but 
the public is not trained to carefully 
weigh such risks and benefits. 
1 
Coupled with the success of vaccines 
at preventing disease, this scenario 
has created a public health challenge: 
the current low incidence of most 
vaccine-preventable diseases 
often misleads the public to the 
misperception that the risks of these 
diseases are low and the costs/risks 
of the vaccines are comparatively 
high, resulting in relatively low 
vaccination program participation. 
2 
Recently, there has been a rise in 
“antivaccine” and “vaccine-hesitant” 
sentiment in the United States. 
3 
Vaccine hesitancy, which recognizes 
a spectrum of beliefs ranging from 
total vaccine acceptance to total 
vaccine refusal, is a complex and 
contextual issue and requires 
approaches at multiple levels, 
including addressing individuals, 
providers, health systems, and the 
nation. 
3, 
4 Vaccine hesitancy is heavily 
grounded in myths about vaccine-
preventable diseases and their 
corresponding vaccines that are not 
supported by scientific evidence. 
5 
– 
7 
However, vaccine hesitancy is also 
entwined with broader factors such 
as institutional trust, socioeconomic 
context, the media, social norms, and 
health beliefs, among others. 
3, 
4 
Although vaccine hesitancy has 
received increasing empirical 
attention lately, 
 
4 it is an extremely 
important issue that requires more 
investigation. 
3
Complementary and alternative 
medicine (CAM), approaches to 
health that are not considered 
part of conventional medicine 
(eg, homeopathy, chiropractic 
manipulation, chelation therapy), 
 
8 
have also recently risen in popularity 
as a form of health care. Estimates 
from the previous decade (pooled 
data from 2002, 2007, and 2012) 
show that one-third of the US 
population had used at least 1 type 
of CAM in the previous 12 months. 
9 
The prevalence of CAM is highest 
among middle-aged, non-Hispanic 
white women of high socioeconomic 
status, as well as those with 
multiple health conditions and who 
frequently visit medical facilities. 
8, 
 
9 
CAM is mostly used in conjunction 
with conventional medicine10 
for prevention of diseases and to 
improve health and well-being 
11 and 
thus should not, in theory, interfere 
with vaccination uptake. However, 
CAM has been implicated as lending 
support to antivaccine/vaccine-
hesitant viewpoints via criticism 
of vaccination, public health, and 
conventional medicine from adults 
using CAM, 
 
12 
– 
14 as well as from CAM 
practitioners and practitioners-
in-training.12, 
 
15, 
 
16 Even among 
CAM practitioners who generally 
support the concept of vaccination, 
a majority report they recommend 
a vaccine schedule different from 
the standard schedule put forth by 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices. 
17
Influenza is a vaccine-preventable 
disease of particular importance 
in the United States, causing up to 
200 000 hospitalizations, 
 
18 49 000 
deaths, 
 
19 and an estimated $87 billion 
of economic burden annually. 
20 
The association of CAM use and 
influenza vaccination in adults has 
been examined, although nationally 
representative findings are limited 
and conflicting: adults who use CAM 
may have significantly lower uptake, 
 
21 
no difference in uptake, 
22 or higher 
uptake 
23 compared with non-CAM 
users. To the best of our knowledge, 
there has been no examination of the 
association of CAM use and influenza 
vaccination in US children.
This limitation of the literature is 
important for 2 primary reasons. 
First, US children are an extremely 
important population pertaining 
to influenza. They experience the 
highest rates of infection and serve as 
a major source of transmission in the 
family and community. 
24 
 
 
–28 Children 
aged <5 years are a high-risk group 
because they are at increased danger 
of influenza-related complications 
and comprise a substantial portion of 
influenza-related morbidity and care 
visits. 
18, 
 
24, 
 
29, 
 
30 Influenza vaccination 
is recommended for all persons aged 
≥6 months annually.25 In children, 
the vaccine is safe, 
 
31 widely available, 
and increasingly affordable, 
 
32, 
 
33 and 
although the effectiveness varies 
each year, 
 
34 influenza vaccines are 
immunologically efficacious and 
effective at preventing numerous 
outcomes.35 However, influenza 
vaccination uptake among US 
children is suboptimal 
36 and 
substantially lower than uptake 
of other recommended childhood 
vaccines. 
37 Second, CAM use in 
children is not uncommon, and the 
sparse literature available suggests 
that children using CAM are less 
likely to be vaccinated. National 
estimates from 2007 to 2012 show 
that nearly 12% of US children 
had used 1 type of CAM in the last 
12 months. 
8, 
 
38 Child CAM use was 
more common among adolescents, 
non-Hispanic white children, and 
children whose parents had high 
levels of education, were not poor, 
and had private health insurance. 
Furthermore, a study of vaccine 
uptake (not including influenza) in 
Washington from 2000 to 2003 found 
that children who saw a naturopathic 
physician or chiropractor were 
less likely to receive recommended 
vaccines and more likely to be 
diagnosed with vaccine-preventable 
diseases, 
39 suggesting children 
who use CAM may be less likely to 
be vaccinated against influenza. 
The present study examines 
the association of CAM use with 
influenza vaccination in a nationally 
representative sample of US children.

(NHIS), the most recent NHIS to 
include the Child Complementary 
and Alternative Medicine File 
(CAL). The NHIS annually collects 
information on the health of the 
US noninstitutionalized civilian 
population through household 
interviews of household adults. 
40 
Houses were sampled by using 
multistage area probability design, 
and the total household response 
rate was 77.6%. 
41 The 2012 CAL 
collected information about all 
NHIS sample children aged 4 to 
17 years (N = 10 218) on use 
of nonconventional health care 
practices (children aged <4 years 
are excluded from the CAL). 
Approximately 1.9% (n = 195) of the 
CAL respondents did not provide any 
responses to the CAL questions but 
are retained in the file as the missing 
values. 
41 All questions are reported 
by household adult respondents.
Dependent Variable
The dependent variable is parent-
reported child receipt of an influenza 
vaccination within the previous 12 
months from the NHIS Child Sample 
file.
Independent Variables
The CAL asks household adults if 
the child has used 37 types of CAM 
for health reasons both ever and 
within the previous 12 months. 
The prevalence of ever using CAM 
varied from 0.01% to 6.4% across 
all types of CAM except the use 
of multivitamins/multiminerals 
(62.3%). We used the “ever” 
questions because although the 
prevalences are still small, they are 
larger than the “previous 12 months” 
questions. Using CAM literature as a 
guide, we grouped these 37 therapies 
across 4 domains developed by the 
National Center for Complementary 
and Alternative Medicine in 
2012 
42 
 
– 
45: (1) alternative medical 
systems (AMS; eg, acupuncture); 
(2) biologically based therapies 
(BBTs; eg, herbal supplements); 
(3) manipulative and body-based 
therapies (MBBT; eg, chiropractic 
manipulation); and (4) mind–body 
therapies (MBT; eg, yoga) (Table 1). 
Variables were constructed 
representing having ever used at 
least 1 type of CAM separately for 
each domain (eg, ever using any 
type of AMS), as done in previous 
literature. 
44 Because the prevalence 
of ever using multivitamins/
multiminerals was much higher 
than any other single CAM type, we 
hypothesized it to be different and 
separated it from other BBT types. 
Thus, the 5 independent variables 
in this study are ever using, for 
health reasons, the following: 
(1) any AMS type; (2) any BBT 
type, excluding multivitamins/
multiminerals; (3) multivitamins/
multiminerals; (4) any MBBT type; 
and (5) any MBT type.

Covariates
The selection of covariates was 
conceptually grounded in Andersen’s 
Behavioral Model of Health Services 
Use. 
46 This model has been used 
in varying health settings to study 
different health outcomes, 
 
47 and 
it provides conceptual factors 
influencing health service use 
(influenza vaccination) at more 
distal levels (predisposing, enabling, 
and creating need), as well as the 
more intermediary health behavior 
level. Using this model, 13 covariates 
were selected. At the child level, 
these covariates were: sex (female/
male); age (years); race/ethnicity 
(non-Hispanic white; non-Hispanic 
black or African American; non-
Hispanic Asian; non-Hispanic other 
or multiple race; and Hispanic); 
usual source of care they go to 
when the child is sick or the parent 
needs advice about the child’s 
health (yes/no); well-child checkup 
in the previous 12 months (yes/
no); number of physician visits in 
the previous 12 months; US-born 
status (yes/no); presence of at 
least 1 serious chronic condition 
or limitation (yes/no [defined as 
having 1 of the following: Down 
syndrome, cerebral palsy, muscular 
dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell 
anemia, autism or autism spectrum 
disorder, type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
arthritis, congenital heart disease, 
or other heart condition]); asthma 
status (yes/no); and insurance type 
(private, public, or no coverage). 
At the family level, these covariates 
were: highest family education (less 
than high school, completed high 
school or the General Educational 
Development test, associate’s degree 
or some college [no degree], or 
bachelor’s degree or higher); family 
income as a percentage of the federal 
poverty level (<100%, 100%–199%, 
or ≥200%); and language of 
interview (English only or other). 
These variables come from the NHIS 
Sample Child, Family, and Person 
files.

Analysis
Bivariate associations were used 
to show unadjusted associations 
between ever use of CAM domains 
and influenza vaccination uptake. 
Multivariate logistic regression 
was then used to examine these 
associations, adjusting for factors of 
health services use (n = 8981–8989 
across CAM domains), as well as in 
1 model including all CAM domain 
variables to adjust for ever using 
other types of CAM (n = 8947). 
Analyses were conducted by using 
Stata/MP 14.1 with preconstructed 
NHIS weights 
41 and Stata’s svy 
commands to obtain nationally 
representative results and SEs 
accounting for complex survey 
design. 
48 We obtained exempt status 
from the institutional review board of 
Pennsylvania State University.
RESULTS
The percentage of sample children 
who had ever used multivitamins or 
multiminerals was 62%; otherwise, 
the percentages ever using any 
subtype of AMS, BBT, MBBT, and 
MBT CAM domains were 3.8%, 7.6%, 
7.3%, and 5.3%, respectively. Overall, 
43% of sample children received an 
influenza vaccine in the previous 
12 months. Sample children were 
predominantly native-born, non-
Hispanic white, and privately insured, 
did not have asthma or serious 
chronic condition/limitations, and 
had a usual source of care, annual 
well-child evaluations, and physician 
visits. They lived with English-
speaking families with at least some 
college education and income above 
the poverty line ( 
Table 2).
In unadjusted analyses, uptake was 
lower among children who had ever 
(versus never) used AMS (33% vs 
43%; P = .008) and MBBT (35% vs 
43%; P = .002). Conversely, uptake 
was higher among children who ever 
(versus never) used multivitamins/
multiminerals (45% vs 39%;

P < .001). There was no significant 
association in children by ever using 
any BBT or MBT. Across covariates, 
significantly lower uptake was 
seen in children according to race/
ethnicity (lowest: non-Hispanic white 
children) and with each increasing 
year of age. Lower uptake was also 
noted in children: without a usual 
source of care; without a recent 
well-child checkup; without serious 
chronic conditions/limitations; 
without asthma; with no insurance 
coverage; with decreasing recent 
physician visits; and in families with 
some college but no degree ( 
Table 3).
Results from multivariate analyses 
adjusting for all health services use 
covariates had similar significant 
results ( 
Table 4). Children ever 
using any type of AMS, or any type of 
MBBT, had lower odds of influenza 
vaccination in the previous 12 
months compared with those never 
using those types of CAM (adjusted 
odds ratios of 0.61 [95% confidence 
interval: 0.44–0.85] and 0.74 [95% 
confidence interval: 0.58–0.94], 
respectively). There were still no 
significant differences in odds of 
uptake among children ever using 
BBT or MBT, and having ever used 
multivitamins or multiminerals was 
no longer significant. Adding all CAM 
domains variables together in one 
model, the MBBT outcome moved 
just outside of significance (odds 
ratio: 0.78 [95% confidence interval: 
0.61–1.00]).
Looking at covariates across the 
columns in  
Table 4, there were 
several patterns of significant results. 
Compared with non-Hispanic white 
children, higher odds of influenza 
vaccination were seen in non-
Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic other or 
multiple race, and Hispanic children; 
there was no significant difference 
between black and white children. 
Compared with children with private 
insurance, children with no coverage 
during the year had lower odds of 
vaccination; there was no significant 
public–private difference. Higher 
odds of vaccination were recorded 
in children with a well-child visit in 
the previous year, with increasing 
number of physician visits, with each 
decreasing year of age, with asthma, 
and not born in the United States. 
There was a U-shaped pattern of 
vaccination odds according to family 
education, whereby the lowest and 
highest categories of education had 
the highest uptake.
DISCUSSION
Although CAM is mostly used in 
conjunction with conventional 
medicine, the present study 
provides evidence that US children 
who have ever used any subtype 
of AMS or MBBT had lower odds 
of influenza vaccination. In our 
sample, the second most prevalent 
type of AMS was naturopathy, and 
the most prevalent type of MBBT 
was chiropractic or osteopathic 
manipulation. These specific types 
of CAM may require contact with 
CAM practitioners shown to have 
vaccine-critical viewpoints, advise 
against vaccination, or advise 
vaccine schedules different from 
those recommended by the federal 
government. 
12, 
 
15 
– 
17, 
39 Because 
chiropractic manipulation is 
grouped in the survey question 
with osteopathic manipulation, it 
is possible that the association of 
MBBT use with lower vaccination 
odds is diluted if osteopathic 
physicians hold viewpoints closer to 
medical physicians and further from 
chiropractors. The MBBT finding 
moved just outside of significance 
when all CAM variables were 
included in 1 model; other CAM 
use may confound the relationship 
between MBBT use and influenza 
vaccination. In terms of the lack of 
a significant difference in uptake 
observed among children ever using 
BBT or MBT, we do not know if 
CAM practitioners are involved in 
the study children’s CAM use; it is 
plausible, however, that these types 
of CAM may involve less contact 
with CAM practitioners (eg, herbal 
supplements, alternative diets, and 
yoga are easily available for home 
use). More research is needed 
investigating these patterns.
Several covariates were also 
significantly associated with 
influenza vaccination uptake and 
warrant further investigation in a 
future, longitudinal study as potential 
mediators and/or moderators of 
influenza vaccine disparities in 
children. Consistent with other 
studies, we found higher uptake 
among the following groups of 
children: those with a higher number

70 Although we found 
no disparities between black and 
white children, we did observe 
higher uptake in Asian, Hispanic, and 
other/multiracial children. There 
were no significant racial/ethnic 
disparities nationally among children 
in most recent influenza seasons, 
 
69 
although higher uptake among 
Asian children has been observed.70 
Generally, higher parental education 
is associated with higher influenza 
vaccine uptake in children. 
56, 
 
68, 
 
70 
However, this scenario is not always 
the case, and in this study we found 
the inverse association. Studies (not 
including influenza vaccination) 
have documented that parents who 
delay or refuse vaccinating their 
children in general tend to be college 
educated, higher income, white 
populations, and also tend to have 
lifestyles that include CAM use and 
alternative diets. 
14, 
71 
– 
73 Perhaps not 
coincidentally, CAM is associated 
with higher income and higher 
education, 
 
74 which may partially 
explain the inverse education 
relationship we observed. Lastly, 
we found that foreign-born children 
had higher odds of vaccination 
compared with US-born children. 
Although we are unaware of studies 
examining the relationship of 
nativity/citizenship and influenza 
vaccination in US children, a recent 
study of Mexican adults in California 
found that higher influenza vaccine 
uptake diminishes after the first 
generation postmigration. 
75 
Furthermore, a study of other 
vaccines found that having a 
foreign-born or noncitizen mother 
was associated with reduced odds 
or vaccination.76 More research is 
needed in these areas.
The findings of this study should be 
interpreted within its limitations.

First, aggregating CAM therapies 
into domains masks the effects 
of individual therapies. Because 
the prevalence of ever using most 
individual CAM therapies in children 
in the NHIS was very small, we 
were not afforded the statistical 
opportunity to conduct such 
individual analyses. Furthermore, 
the use of the “ever” CAM questions 
instead of the “within the previous 
12 months” questions, although 
necessary for power reasons, 
prevented us from discerning if 
these are children whose parents 
were having them “try out” CAM 
versus consistent CAM users. Second, 
the CAL excludes children aged 
<4 years, although children aged 
<5 years are at high risk for influenza 
complications. 
18, 
 
24, 
 
29, 
 
30 These are 
survey limitations; future studies 
should capture larger samples of 
children’s CAM use and include 
those aged 0 to 3 years. Related, 
both the CAM variables and the 
influenza vaccine question are 
parent-reported, creating potential 
recall bias, although for the latter, the 
influenza vaccine is recommended 
annually, lessening the time period 
that the parent needs to recall and 
thus also the chance of recall bias. 
Last, this study was cross-sectional, 
and therefore the findings are 
associative and not causal. We believe 
the possibility of bidirectionality 
in our findings, however, to be less 
likely. The reasons many use CAM 
include cultural and philosophical 
beliefs about health and health 
services, and CAM often aims to 
treat illness beyond the physical and 
biomedical contexts.43 Andersen’s 
model posits that such health beliefs, 
values, and knowledge are individual 
predisposing characteristics that 
temporally precede the decision 
to use a health service such as 
vaccination. 
46 However, although 
we feel it is less likely, the reverse 
relationship is possible: that parents 
who have already chosen not to 
vaccinate their child feel pressured 
by conventional medicine and thus 
choose to pursue CAM.
CONCLUSIONS
From 2001 to 2010, significant 
progress was made in reducing 
disparities across many domains 
in many vaccinations among US 
children, largely in part due to the 
Vaccines For Children program. 
77 
Furthermore, in 2010, the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act 
began requiring all new health plans 
to cover routinely recommended 
vaccinations (including influenza 
vaccination) without cost-sharing. 
33 
Significant disparities remain, 
however. 
77 The findings from this 
study suggest that children who have 
ever used any type of AMS or MBBT 
(ie, CAM types more likely to result 
in contact with CAM practitioners 
documented as advising alternative 
vaccine schedules or against 
vaccination) should be considered 
as a group vulnerable to low annual 
uptake of influenza vaccination. 
Although more and more patients 
are using CAM and may be expecting 
health professionals to guide 
them in making decisions about 
whether CAM and/or conventional 
approaches work better for disease 
treatment or prevention, most 
CAM users do not disclose to their 
physicians that they use CAM. 
74 At 
the same time, there is increasing 
vaccine hesitancy in the United 
States. However, there is very 
limited research on how vaccination 
perspectives develop among 
CAM practitioners- and medical 
practitioners-in-training.78 There 
is opportunity for US public health, 
policy, and conventional medical 
professionals and educators to 
improve vaccine uptake and child 
health by better engaging both 
CAM and conventional medicine 
practitioners-in-training, parents of 
children using particular domains 
of CAM, and the CAM practitioners 
advising them.
