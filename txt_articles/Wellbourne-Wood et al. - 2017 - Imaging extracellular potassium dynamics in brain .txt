Abstract. Neuronal activity results in the release of Kþ into the extracellular space (ECS). Classically, mea-
surements of extracellular Kþ (½Kþ�o) are carried out using Kþ-sensitive microelectrodes, which provide a single
point measurement with undefined spatial resolution. An imaging approach would enable the spatiotemporal
mapping of ½Kþ�o. Here, we report on the design and characterization of a fluorescence imaging-based Kþ-sen-
sitive nanosensor for the ECS based on dendrimer nanotechnology. Spectral characterization, sensitivity, and
selectivity of the nanosensor were assessed by spectrofluorimetry, as well as in both wide-field and two-photon
microscopy settings, demonstrating the nanosensor efficacy over the physiologically relevant ion concentration
range. Spatial and temporal kinetics of the nanosensor responses were assessed using a localized iontophoretic
Kþ application on a two-photon imaging setup. Using acute mouse brain slices, we demonstrate that the nano-
sensor is retained in the ECS for extended periods of time. In addition, we present a ratiometric version of the
nanosensor, validate its sensitivity in brain tissue in response to elicited neuronal activity and correlate the
responses to the extracellular field potential. Together, this study demonstrates the efficacy of the Kþ-sensitive
nanosensor approach and validates the possibility of creating multimodal nanosensors. © The Authors. Published by

Introduction
During the repolarization phase of action potentials, neurons
release potassium (Kþ), causing an increase of the extracellular
Kþ concentration (½Kþ�o). Since Kþ is one of the key membrane
potential determinants and, thus, fundamentally affects electrical
signaling, the central nervous system has several homeostatic
mechanisms to control ½Kþ�o. In addition to passive diffusion
through the extracellular space (ECS), Kþ is taken up and
released by both glia and neurons, which is accomplished by
various Kþ selective channels and transporters.1 In addition
to its fundamental effects on neuronal excitability, changes in
½Kþ�o have been shown to influence long-term potentiation,2
vascular tone,3,4 and glial morphology.5 Impaired ½Kþ�o homeo-
stasis is associated with a wide range of pathological states, such
as epilepsy,6,7 cortical spreading depression,8 and ischemic
stroke/ anoxia.9 It is yet unclear whether pathological changes
in ½Kþ�o are a result or a cause of some of these diseases. To
address the role of ½Kþ�o in physiological and in pathological
conditions, monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of
½Kþ�o changes is of crucial importance.
To date, ½Kþ�o has been measured predominantly using
Kþ-sensitive microelectrodes.10–12 Although still the methodo-
logical standard for measuring ½Kþ�o, they are nonetheless lim-
ited by only providing a single point measurement. They also
introduce a substantial dead space in the tissue, which may alter
local structure and thus function. This makes their application
limited in scope, especially from the perspective of monitoring
the spatiotemporal flux of Kþ, which is needed to address the
standing questions regarding Kþ kinetics and dynamics.
Alternatively, one may attempt to image extracellular ion
dynamics with ion sensitive dyes. This, however, is a far less
widespread practice due to methodological problems, such as
immediate diffusion of the dye through the ECS and a lack
of dyes with a suitable affinity for their respective ion concen-
trations found in the ECS. Due to these methodological difficul-
ties, published attempts to image Kþ in the ECS are limited to
only a few studies. For instance, in one study, the authors uti-
lized a long wavelength fluorescent sensor based on the tetraa-
zachlorine moiety, which was applied to the exposed cortex of
an anesthetized mouse to visualize Kþ waves in the cortex.13
Others injected the Kþ sensitive dye APG2 into the cisterna
magna, and, after the diffusion of the dye throughout the
brain, performed in vivo fluorescence imaging of the cortex.14
Both studies utilize in vivo fluorescence imaging strategies that,
while highly valuable, only permit the imaging of superficial
cortical regions.
To image various brain regions that are not accessible with
current in vivo optical imaging methods, acute brain slice prep-
arations can be used. This approach is also benefited by the abil-
ity to place microelectrodes more accurately and in the desired
brain region for electrophysiology, as well as the ability to con-
trol the environment of the tissue to a greater degree. Imaging
extracellular ion dynamics in acute slices is more difficult, how-
ever, due to the lack of an enclosed compartment that the skull
and dura naturally provide, as well as the constant superfusion
of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) over the slice. Together,
these cause a rapid washout of small molecule dyes from the
ECS, with little to no time to gather useful data.

 To overcome these challenges, we designed a Kþ potassium
nanosensor based on dendrimer nanotechnology. For this, we
used a larger molecule [generation 5, polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-
functionalized, PAMAM dendrimer] as a scaffold for the small
molecule Kþ sensitive dye Asante Potassium Green 4 (APG4)
through a noncovalent interaction. This strategy of dye encap-
sulation has been previously applied in our laboratory for intra-
cellular imaging with the sodium (Naþ) sensitive dye, corona
green.15 Here, we show that this new APG4-based nanosensor
is well retained in the ECS, is selective and sensitive enough to
measure ½Kþ�o at ionic concentration ranges relevant for ECS,
and can be used to measure rapid local changes in ½Kþ�o in
response to iontophoretic pulses of Kþ. Furthermore, we show
changes in ½Kþ�o after the induction of neuronal activity with
glutamate and correlate this to local field potential. Overall,
we demonstrate that this APG4-based Kþ sensitive nanosensor
is suitable for imaging ½Kþ�o in acute brain slices and can be
used to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of ½Kþ�o in
the brain.

Materials and Methods
2.1
Nanosensor Synthesis
Asante Potassium Green 4 (APG4), (Teflabs, Texas, USA) and
Generation 5 PAMAM dendrimers with a 1,4-diaminobutane
core and a poly (ethyleneglycol) methyl ether surface (Andrews
ChemServices, Michigan) were used to prepare the nanosensor.
The preparation of PAMAM dendrimer and APG4 was per-
formed at a 1∶1.2 molar ratio to ensure at least one dye molecule
per dendrimer. For the ratiometric nanosensor, a second dye,
AlexaFluor 568 (AF568) was incorporated, with a final 1.2∶1.2∶1
APG4 to AF568 to dendrimer ratio. To remove any unbound dye
molecules after their integration into the dendrimer complex, the
solution was passed through an ultrafiltration column with a
3kDa cutoff (Millipore, Massachusetts). Filtration was repeated
several times to ensure a thorough washout of unbound dye.
After being prepared, the nanosensor was stored at −20°C in
aqueous HEPES buffer at pH 7.5. Under these conditions,
the nanosensor remains stable for >1 year.
2.2
Spectral Characterizations
Fluorimetric analysis was performed in quartz cuvettes using a
using a spectrofluorimeter (LS55 Luminescence, PerkinElmer,
Massachusetts). First, the nanosensor was diluted to 100 nM in
an extracellular-like solution containing (mM): NaCl 160,
KCl∕Kþ-gluconate 0-50, CaCl2 1.3, MgSO4 0.81, NaH2PO4
0.78, HEPES 20 adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. For Kþ cali-
bration curves, fluorescence intensities of the emission maxima
were plotted against known Kþ concentrations. For this, K-gluc-
onate (1M) was titrated in the cuvette over the range of 0 to
50 mM, and the results were corrected for dilution. For Naþ
experiments, extracellular-like solution, as described above, was
used but with 5 mM KCl and 135 mM NaCl. NaCl (2M) was
then titrated to gather data in the range of 135 to 165 mM Naþ
and were also corrected for dilution. For Mg2þ Ca2þ, and Ba2þ
experiments, MgSO4, CaCl2, and BaðOHÞ2 (adjusted to pH 7.4)
solutions were titrated in extracellular-like solution (5 mM Kþ),
as described above. All spectral characterizations are an average
of three separate scans.
2.3
Sol-Gel Synthesis
To immobilize the nanosensor for in vitro spatiotemporal imag-
ing, silica sol-gels were synthesized in two steps: hydrolysis and
condensation.16 The hydrolysis consists of the following reac-
tion: SiðOMeÞ4 þ MeOH þ H2O → MeOH þ Si-OH, while the
condensation follows the reaction: Si-OH þ Si-OH → Si-O-Si þ
H2O. Hydrolysis was performed under a fume hood at room
temperature by mixing MeOH, H2O, and SiðOMeÞ4 in molar
ratios of 7.5∶10∶1. After hydrolysis, a small volume of fluores-
cent nanosensor preparation was diluted in <100 μl of the sol-
gel mix and 5 μl drops of the fluorescent sol-gel mix were pipet-
ted onto glass microscope coverslips. Drops were allowed to
condense and dry and were used for experiments after 24 h.
2.4
K+ Iontophoresis
Iontophoresis was carried out using a Neurophore BH-2
(Digitimer, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom). Borosilicate glass
pipettes (∼5 or 25 MΩ) containing 1M KCl were used. A DC
holding current of 50 nA was applied before and after iontopho-
retic pulses to ensure Kþ retention. 500 nA pulses were used for
rapid Kþ ejection.
2.5
Imaging
Single-photon fluorescence imaging of sol-gels was performed
on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 100M,
Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a 40 × 1.3 N.A. oil-immersion
objective lens. Selection of the fluorescence excitation wave-
length was performed using a monochromator (Till Photonics,
Gräfelfing, Germany), and fluorescence was detected using an
EM CCD camera (Andor, Belfast, United Kingdom). Image

 acquisition was computer-controlled using the Metafluor imag-
ing software (Molecular Devices, California).
Two-photon imaging of sol-gels and acute brain slices was
carried out using a custom-built two-photon microscope with a
40× 0.8 N.A. water-dipping objective (Olympus). Fluorescence
excitation was performed using a Chameleon Vision S
femtosecond infrared laser including group velocity dispersion
compensation (Coherent, California). Captured emission wave-
lengths were 525 � 25 nm and 620 � 30 nm for the green
and red channels, respectively. Image acquisition and linescan
was performed using custom-written software in the Labview
environment.

 2.6
Brain Slice Preparation
After decapitation of 2.5- to 3-week old mice, brains were
extracted and 300-μm thick hippocampal slices were prepared
with a vibratome (VT 1000S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), as pre-
viously described.17 Slices were imaged in an open chamber
superfused with ACSF, bubbled with 95% O2 5% CO2. ACSF
solution contains (mM): NaCl 125, KCl 3, NaHCO3 25, CaCl2
1.2, MgSO4 1, NaH2PO4 1.25, glucose 10. Local delivery of the
APG4 PAMAM-PEG nanosensor was achieved by applying
pressure pulses of 5 to 60 s at 1 to 2 psi to the back of a glass
pipette of tip diameter 1 to 2 μm using a Pressure System II
(The Toohey Company, Fairfield, New Jersey). Pipettes were
retracted out of the tissue after satisfactory dye application.
All experimental procedures were carried out in strict accor-
dance with the recommendations of the Swiss Ordinance on
Animal Experimentation and were specifically approved for this
study by the Veterinary Affairs Office of the Canton of Vaud,
Switzerland.
2.7
Extracellular Field Recordings
Borosilicate glass pipettes (∼4.5 MΩ) were filled with an
ACSF-like solution. Recordings were obtained in the zero cur-
rent clamp configuration using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier
(Molecular Devices) in gap-free mode. Data were acquired at
10 kHz by a Digidata 1440 analog-to-digital converter, con-
trolled with the pCLAMP 10 software.

Results
3.1
Nanosensor Design, Preparation, and
Characterization
The Kþ sensitive nanosensor is composed of a generation 5 poly
(amidoamine) (PAMAM) type dendrimer with a poly(ethylene-
gylcol) functionalized surface. With our strategy, this G5
PAMAM-PEG dendrimer, which has been measured as 6.57nm
in diameter,15 becomes a host for small molecules, such as the
Kþ sensitive dye APG4, via electrostatic interaction (Fig. 1).
Tertiary amines that compose the dendrimer core are thought
to play a key role in this incorporation process, since electro-
static interaction of any anionic dye with core amines will deter-
mine its integration pattern or lack thereof, as reported for other
guest–host dendrimer interactions.18,19
A dye-to-dendrimer ratio of 1.2∶1 was selected to ensure at
least one dye per dendrimer molecule. After incorporation of the
dye, the complex was repeatedly passed through a centrifugal
filter with a 3-kDa cutoff to eliminate nonencapsulated dye.
While each dendrimer most likely encapsulates a single APG4
molecule, the possibility that a single given dendrimer may con-
tain fewer or more APG4 molecules has not been ruled out, as
one has to consider the statistical nature of the nanoparticles
produced.
Emission and excitation spectrum of the APG4 PAMAM-
PEG nanosensor in extracellular-like solution are presented in
Fig. 2(a), along with the excitation spectrum of the free
APG4 indicator. The spectra exhibit an excitation maximum
around 515 nm and show a slightly red-shifted maximum exci-
tation wavelength compared with free APG4. The emission
maximum was found to be ∼540 nm. The Kþ-dependent fluo-
rescence was analyzed over a Kþ concentration range of 0 to
50 mM [Fig. 2(b)] and showed that the Kþ-nanosensor fluores-
cence increases stepwise with increasing ½Kþ�, and did not
present spectral shifts in response to the increasing concentra-
tion. The peak emission intensity was plotted against ½Kþ� and
compared to two other nanosensors, APG2 PAMAM-PEG and
PBFI PAMAM-PEG, which only differ in regards to their encap-
sulated fluorescent indicator [Fig. 2(c)]. The APG4-based
nanosensor exhibits a fivefold higher fluorescent yield when
compared to the APG2 and PBFI nanosensors in an extracellu-
lar-like milieu. It is noteworthy that the classical Kþ-indicator
PBFI behaves drastically differently in solutions mimicking the
intracellular and extracellular milieu [Fig. 2(d)], which may
explain the poorer performance of PBFI PAMAM-PEG com-
pared with the other two nanosensors.
Last, the sensitivity of the APG4 PAMAM-PEG nanosensor
to Naþ was assessed from 135 to 165 mM Naþ, the concentra-
tion range expected to be found extracellularly under physio-
logical conditions. Figure 2(e) indicates that altering ½Naþ�
has negligible effects on the overall nanosensor fluorescence
while recorded with constant ½Kþ�. Other cations were also
tested for sensitivity, including magnesium, calcium, and barium
[Fig. 2(f)]. While the APG4 PAMAM-PEG nanosensor is insen-
sitive to calcium and magnesium over a relevant concentration
range, the barium ion induces a large increase in fluorescence
at concentrations greater than 100 μM. Since barium is known
to block inwardly rectifying Kþ channels and is often used

 experimentally,20 caution must be employed when using the
nanosensor.
After demonstrating the sensitivity of the nanoprobe in a
cuvette, we then investigated its spatiotemporal characteristics
using single and two-photon microscopy in vitro. For this pur-
pose, we incorporated the nanosensor into a porous silica glass
using a sol-gel process, providing us with an in vitro platform in
which we could image its performance, all the while keeping it
immobilized, as well as closely controlling the local environ-
ment via iontophoresis or superfusion of solutions.
After preparation of the sol-gel silica structures on cover slips
[Fig. 3(a)], we performed single-photon imaging in a closed per-
fusion chamber, in which we could measure the stepwise
increase in fluorescence following increasing concentrations
of Kþ. Superfusion and imaging of the sol-gel fragments dem-
onstrated that its porosity is sufficient for allowing fast diffusion
of solutes through their matrix, while being able to immobilize
the nanosensor. The stepwise increase in fluorescence and the
reversibility of the signal upon washout of the high Kþ solution
demonstrate that the dye is stable and responsive over time
[Fig. 3(b)].
Because two-photon microscopy is significantly more advan-
tageous for imaging in thick tissue and it is primarily the setting
in which this nanosensor is ultimately intended to be employed,
we analyzed the APG4 PAMAM-PEG containing silica glass in
a two-photon microscope. This allowed us to verify its efficacy in
a two-photon excitation setting, as well as to gather additional data
regarding spatial and temporal kinetics of the sensor. To demon-
strate the excitation maxima in a two-photon setting, wavelength
tuning from 770 to 840 nm was performed. The emission intensity
was recorded for each wavelength, correcting for laser output
power as measured in the beam path. Figure 4(a) shows the mea-
sured two-photon excitation spectrum, showing a maximal peak
two-photon excitation wavelength for the nanosensor at ∼815 nm.
To analyze the spatial and temporal kinetics of the sensor,
iontophoretic Kþ ejection was performed. A 1M KCl filled
borosilicate glass pipette was lowered to a distance of 5 μm
from the surface of the sol-gel, and iontophoretic pulses were
used to expel Kþ, thereby increasing the local Kþ concentration
in a radial manner from the pipette tip [Fig. 4(b)]. A local fluo-
rescence increase that was maximal at the tip of the pipette open-
ing and radiating outward could be observed. Figure 4(c) shows

an indicator of the rate of cation extrusion from the pipette and used to estimate the response delay of the
nanosensor response to abrupt Kþ changes, estimated to be 33.6 ms.

 the waveform of fluorescence at regions of varying distance
from the epicenter, demonstrating spatial variation of the Kþ
concentration increase and the resulting fluorescence. The char-
acteristically slow increase to steady-state and fast decay of sig-
nal also matches the kinetics of iontophoretic release, as
demonstrated previously by others.21 Taken together, these
results indicate that the temporal and spatial characteristics of
fluorescence of the nanosensor are favorable and that the signal
is an accurate representation of the Kþ fluxes induced. To fur-
ther explore the temporal kinetics of the nanosensor, line-scan-
ning experiments were performed during iontophoresis. The
pipette was placed on the surface of the sol-gel, and simultane-
ous iontophoresis of sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) and Kþ was
performed, causing a measurable increase in fluorescence of
both the red channel (SR101 expelled from the pipette) and
the green channel [APG4 PAMAM-PEG embedded in the
sol-gel; Fig. 4(d)]. The presence of the two fluorescent dyes
in the pipette allowed us to take into account the nonlinear
kinetics of iontophoresis.21 The inflection points of the fluores-
cence signals were compared as an indication of rapid kinetics
of the sensor. The slope of the fluorescence of the red channel
reaches its inflection point 33.6 ms before the slope of the green
channel. This delay is a good estimate of the responsiveness of
the nanosensor in the presence of a sudden Kþ rise. By com-
parison, a fast version of the genetically encoded calcium indi-
cator, GCaMP6F, has an activation time of 74 ms.22 Synthetic
organic ion indicators are generally faster. A range of hypotheti-
cal calcium dyes with different Kd values binding Ca2þ over a
range of concentrations will have a response time between 2 to
40 ms,23 while the widely used dye fura-2 demonstrates a
response time estimated at 11 ms in-vitro and 40 ms in-vivo.24,25
3.2
Acute Brain Slice Measurements
The second issue related to imaging Kþ in the ECS is the reten-
tion of the dye in the tissue. Injecting a small water-soluble mol-
ecule such as APG4 into acute brain slices results in a fast
disappearance of the dye that makes it impossible to use effec-
tively. Therefore, the dendrimer must serve the function of sta-
bilizing the dye in the ECS for extended periods of time.
Figure 5(a) displays the nanosensor’s distribution in the ECS
after several microinjections demonstrating concurrent fluores-
cence of the nanosensor (green), staining of astrocytes with
SR101 (red), and unlabeled cell bodies likely belonging to neu-
rons. A comparison between the injections of free APG4 and
APG4 PAMAM-PEG demonstrates that the dendrimer greatly
improves the nanosensor retention in tissue and that the den-
drimer is successfully being retained in the ECS [Fig. 5(b)].
The marked difference in dye signal over time demonstrates
the efficacy of the nanosensor design. Occasionally, observed
decay of signal after injection in the tissue was found to be
mainly due to bleaching, with minimal contribution of washout
of the dye, demonstrating that the dye is very well stabilized by
the dendrimer in the ECS (data not shown).
To demonstrate sensitivity of the nanosensor in tissue, ion-
tophoresis of Kþ in acute slices was carried out with or without
the presence of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 50 μM) in the perfusion
solution (Fig. 6). The amplitude of signal increase was higher
for slices perfused with 4-AP. This observation is consistent
with the fact that 4-AP is known to block a number of Kþ
channels26 and may, therefore, alter Kþ buffering out of the ECS.
This likely slows the process of Kþ uptake by cells in response to
the extracellular concentration increase via iontophoresis.

 One challenge related to imaging brain tissue in a two-pho-
ton setting is that it is very sensitive to small movements or drift,
which greatly affects the thin focal plane. This is especially true
in regards to imaging the ECS. While individual cells show rel-
atively stable signal even with small focal plane shifts, the fine
and heterogeneous structures of the ECS are, in our experience,
extremely prone to such shifts. Such movement artifacts cannot
be avoided entirely, especially with long duration recordings. To
counteract this problem, we designed another version of the
APG4-based nanosensor. This improved version includes a sec-
ond, potassium insensitive dye, AlexaFluor 568 (AF568), and is
thus dubbed the APG4/AF568 PAMAM-PEG nanosensor
[Fig. 7(a)]. Its emission spectral scans [Fig. 7(b)] demonstrate
that the sensitivity of the APG4 is not diminished by the addition
of another molecule in the dendrimer. The AF568 does not
respond to potassium and emits in the red spectrum. This allows
for more precise ratiometric imaging of Kþ dynamics and dem-
onstrates the general feasibility of the ratiometric, multidye, and
multimodal nanosensor design.
While the basal level of ½Kþ�o in the mammal brain rests
around 2.5 to 3 mM, periods of intense neuronal activity can
raise that value to a physiological ceiling level of around 10 to
12 mM.27 It was also shown recently with Kþ-sensitive micro-
electrodes that bath application of 500-μM glutamate induces a
rise of ½Kþ�o in the range of several millimolar in the “stratum
radiatum” of the CA1.28 Using the APG4/AF568 PAMAM-PEG
nanosensor, we performed ratiometric imaging of Kþ in the stra-
tum radiatum of the CA1 in response to intermittent bath appli-
cation of 500-μM glutamate (Fig. 8). In this experiment, spatial
resolution was privileged by selecting one small, 5-μm diameter
region of interest. The signal-to-noise ratio of the trace would
increase for larger regions. An application time of 30 s was
chosen since ½Kþ�o elevations typically follow sustained and
persistent neural activity.
With each sequential application, the ratio of fluorescence of
the two channels rises and then drops accordingly. The corre-
sponding field potential was simultaneously recorded, demon-
strating a similar waveform. Individual peaks exhibiting
common characteristics in both the field potential and fluores-
cence can be observed, further supporting the efficacy of the
nanosensor design.

Discussion
During neuronal activity, ion fluxes across cell membranes are
associated both with the generation of action potentials and with
the postsynaptic events. ½Kþ�o levels have been shown to
undergo substantial fluctuations in brain tissue during physio-
logical and pathological conditions. In particular, neuronal exci-
tation leads to elevations of ½Kþ�o that have to be rapidly
regulated to enable subsequent activity.29 Once locally released
in the ECS by neurons, ½Kþ�o elevations are rapidly dissipated
by passive diffusion across the ECS, reuptake into neurons and
astrocytes, and redistribution across the astroglial syncytium.1
The measurement of ½Kþ�o has been so far mainly performed
using ion-selective electrodes.30,31 These approaches are rela-
tively invasive and do not provide direct spatial information
about Kþ changes. Fluorescence-based detection of ECS Kþ
offers the benefits of being both noninvasive and capable of
assessing the spatiotemporal pattern of Kþ flux within the tissue.
The advantages of spatiotemporal data acquisition in regards
to ion dynamics are evident when one considers the wealth

 of knowledge uncovered, for instance, in the field of Ca2þ
signaling.
The ECS in the brain occupies 15% to 30% of the volume,
and its geometry is made of an interconnected network of
<100 nM tube- or sheet-like conduits.32 Due to the limited vol-
ume and diffusion constraints of the ECS, the local neuronal Kþ
efflux (e.g., occurring during the repolarization phase of action
potentials) is sufficient to significantly increase ½Kþ�o. While the
basal ½Kþ�o concentration is ∼3 mM,33 somewhat lower than the
plasma concentration, ½Kþ�o may rise to 10 to 12 mM during
sustained neuronal activity.27 While the ECS presents some dif-
fusion barriers due to its constrained geometry, diffusion of
small molecules in the ECS is relatively fast. In particular,
organic fluorescent molecules routinely used for ion imaging
have molecular weights typically <1500 Da. Local application
of such dyes in the ECS leads to disappearance of fluorescent
signal within seconds, as seen in Fig. 5(b). The strategy that we
followed was to incorporate a Kþ-selective indicator inside a
larger scaffold consisting of a generation 5 PAMAM dendrimer.
The size of this construct, estimated to be around 6.6 nm in
diameter with a molecular mass above 100 kDa,15 considerably
slows down its diffusion in the tissue and enables longer term
monitoring of ECS fluorescent signals. It should be underlined
that smaller dendrimers, i.e., under generation 4, do not form
developed enough internal cavities to provide encapsulation,
while dendrimers of generation 7 and above are too large, result-
ing in blocked pores that are less accessible.34 Generation 5 pro-
vides internal cavities large enough to host smaller molecules,
such as APG4, and still open and exposed for solutes and ions to
readily pass through.
Another important factor is surface functionalization. To pre-
vent toxicity of the dendrimer-based nanosensor, the surface of
the dendrimer must be electroneutral. It has been demonstrated
that naked PAMAM dendrimers, which possess cationic amine
terminals, induce the formation of transient holes in membranes
of living cells.35 This increases toxicity and allows passage to
solutes, including the dendrimer itself, across the plasma mem-
brane. In the same study, a PEG functionalized-dendrimer was
shown to have no effect over the same concentration range. It
has also been shown that PEG-functionalized dendrimers, when
inserted inside neurons, do not affect the integrity or electrical
properties of the neurons.15
While the dendrimer nanoparticle properties play an impor-
tant role in the nanosensor design, the dye itself is especially
important. Due to the fact that Naþ and Kþ are both monovalent
cations with very similar properties, dyes that bind Kþ are likely
to have a certain degree of affinity to Naþ. Most ion-sensitive
dyes are used to image “intracellular” ion dynamics, but due to
differential ionic concentrations across the membrane, some
dyes that are effective intracellularly will not be as useful in
the extracellular setting. The classical Kþ dye PBFI,36 for
example, is more effective intracellularly, where there is a
low concentration of Naþ and a high concentration of Kþ.
Extracellularly, the respective ion concentrations are reversed,
and PBFI loses sensitivity due to the confounding fluorescence
introduced by the high Naþ concentration [Fig. 2(d)]. For this
reason, it was important to assess the sensitivity of nanosensors
based on various dyes in an extracellular-like solution. Figure 2(c)
demonstrates that under extracellular conditions, APG4 is the
most sensitive of the dyes tested.
The APG4 fluorescent nanosensor emits green light at
∼540 nM, with a one-photon excitation maximum at ∼490 nm.
In two-photon mode, it has a broader excitation centered around
810 nm. As various organic dyes with red emission have similar
two-photon excitation wavelengths around 800 nm, one
could envisage using one common excitation wavelength
while detecting both green and red emission simultaneously.
This indeed proved useful for our design, enabling the improve-
ment of the nanosensor via the incorporation of AF568, which
can be excited with the same infrared wavelength.
After characterizing the nanosensor using sol-gels and
cuvettes, we aimed to demonstrate its efficacy in living brain
tissue. Iontophoresis in the tissue or superfusion of solutions
are both possible methods for demonstrating differential fluores-
cence of the nanosensor in the tissue in response to a variable
concentration of ½Kþ�o. However, it is more relevant to both
physiology and pathology to assess whether the nanosensor
is able to measure changes associated with ½Kþ�o, where the
source of the Kþ fluctuations is the tissue itself.
The experiment carried out in Fig. 8 demonstrates that the
sensor is sensitive enough to detect such changes in ½Kþ�o
and correlates them to a well-established readout, the local
field potential. To relate raw fluorescence to concentrations,
one would need a calibration protocol for the nanosensor in liv-
ing tissue. This would require the silencing of neuronal activity,
as well as the blockade of a variety of Kþ channels, using mol-
ecules such as 4-AP. Barium can also be used to block Kþ chan-
nels, but the observed sensitivity of the nanosensor to barium
may exclude it from employment in the calibration process,
except at low concentrations (<100 μM). Alternatively, one
could envisage extending the sol-gel approach depicted in
Figs. 3 and 4 and combining it with the ratiometric nanosensor
to calibrate the fluorescence signal ex vivo. This approach, once
validated,
would
significantly
accelerate
the
process
of
obtaining absolute extracellular Kþ levels in situ.
Kþ homeostasis has many contributing functional compo-
nents taking part in the process, including Na-K-ATPase
pumps, Na-K-Cl cotransporters (NKCC), inwardly rectifying
potassium channels (Kir), voltage-gated potassium channels,
and, in the case of the astrocytic syncytium, gap junctions.1
This nanosensor is likely to facilitate future investigations of
these mechanisms and their interactions. The spatiotemporal
nature of the gathered data will allow for the investigation
into the possible existence of Kþ microdomains around acti-
vated neurons and the spatial extent of these domains.
In addition to validating the feasibility of the nanosensor for
imaging in the ECS, this study highlights the range of possible
extensions of the nanosensor strategy. For example, the ratio-
metric nanosensor design demonstrates the possibility of com-
bining several optical readouts, laying the path for the design of
multimodal optical nanosensors and introducing a broader range
of possible applications.
