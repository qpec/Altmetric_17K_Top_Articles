Abstract
 IMPORTANCE—Homicide is a leading cause of adolescent mortality. To our knowledge, 
relatively little has been studied in terms of the association between environmental neighborhood 
features, such as streets, buildings, and natural surroundings, and severe violent injury among 
youth.
 OBJECTIVE—To assess associations between environmental neighborhood features and 
adolescent homicide in order to identify targets for future place-based interventions.
 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Population-based case-control study 
conducted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from April 15, 2008, to March 31, 2014. We identified 
adolescents who died by homicide at 13 to 20 years of age from 2010 to 2012 while residing in 
Philadelphia. We used incidence-density sampling and random-digit dialing to recruit control 
participants ages 13 to 20 years matched on sex and indoor-outdoor location at the time of each 
index case participant’s homicide.
 EXPOSURES—To obtain environmental data about modifiable features that were present in 
the immediate surroundings of our case and control participants, blinded field researchers used 
standardized techniques to photograph case and control participant outdoor locations. 
Photographic data were stitched together to create 360° panoramic images that were coded for 60 
elements of the visible environment.

  MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE—Adolescent homicide.
 RESULTS—We enrolled 143 homicide case participants (mean [SD] age, 18.4 [1.5] years) and 
155 matched control participants (mean [SD] age, 17.2 [2.1] years) who were both outdoors at the 
time of the homicide. In adjusted analyses, multiple features of Philadelphia streets, buildings, and 
natural surroundings were associated with adolescent homicide. The presence of street lighting 
(odds ratio [OR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.70), illuminated walk/don’t walk signs (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 
0.03-0.92), painted marked crosswalks (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04-0.63), public transportation (OR, 
0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.49), parks (OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.88), and maintained vacant lots (OR, 
0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.81) were significantly associated with decreased odds of homicide. The odds 
of homicide were significantly higher in locations with stop signs (OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.40-13.45), 
security bars/gratings on houses (OR, 9.23; 95% CI, 2.45-34.80), and private bushes/plantings 
(OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.18-10.01).
 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Using a population-based case-control design, we 
identified multiple modifiable environmental features that might be targeted in future randomized 
intervention trials designed to reduce youth violence by improving neighborhood context.
Violence changes the life course of far too many young people in the United States. 
Homicide, the most extreme consequence of interpersonal violence, led to 2043 deaths 
among adolescents ages 13 to 20 years in 2013,1 with the highest incidence concentrated in 
urban settings and among African American youths.2 Medical advances have reduced 
assault case-fatality rates, but declines over the last 25 years have stagnated as we reach the 
limits of what postinjury medical care can do to save critically injured youths.2
Youth violence is as complex as it is pervasive and requires research that addresses 
individual-, family-, community-, and society-level risk factors.3 Prevention programs that 
intervene on violence-promoting societal factors, such as poverty and inequities in 
education, could produce a very high level of population effect, while offering major savings 
to the US medical system.4 Although such programs are absolutely necessary to set in 
motion, they are also complicated, at times controversial, and may take generations to 
produce sustained results. Research has also shown that, while sometimes effective, 
programs targeting individual factors, including high impulsivity, delinquent behavior, and 
substance use, often require expensive and continuous investments to maintain long-term 
behavior change for small numbers of youths. These programs may thus have limited effect, 
sustainability, and benefit to the broader population of youths.2,4-6
Modifying environmental risks for violence offers an intervention point between extensive 
but ambitious socioeconomic interventions and less sustainable individual-level 
interventions. Structural deterioration, abandonment, and social disorder may heavily 
influence the occurrence of crime and violence.7,8 A growing evidence base demonstrates 
that inexpensive revitalization of blighted urban land, buildings, and business districts, as 
well as remediation of structural concerns—poor street lighting, limited transportation 
access, and limited exposure to nature—may be key in improving health and reducing 
violence.2,5,6,9-13

 Adolescence includes tremendous physical, developmental, and social change, which may 
fundamentally alter the way youths assess risk and navigate their environments. 
Understanding the unique influences of modifiable environmental factors on adolescent 
homicide is a critical first step in designing place-based interventions for youth violence 
prevention. To address this, we conducted a population-based, case-control study among 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, adolescent residents aged 13 to 20 years in which the 
environments of case and matched control participants were photographed and quantified via 
standardized pictometric protocols14 to assess associations between modifiable 
environmental features and adolescent homicide.
 Methods
We used incidence-density sampling to recruit participants for a population-based case-
control study. This study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania and the City of 
Philadelphia institutional review boards. We obtained verbal consent for participation from 
respondents aged 18 years and older and verbal consent from a parent or guardian and assent 
from those aged 13 to 17 years.
 Participants and Matching
Case participants died by homicide at 13 to 20 years of age and were Philadelphia County 
residents whose homicide occurred in Philadelphia between 2010 and 2012. Each case 
participant was identified on the day in which the homicide occurred by data coordinators 
who established an adolescent homicide case participant surveillance system with the 
Philadelphia Office of the Medical Examiner and the Philadelphia Police Department. 
Information on case participants, including homicide date and time, age and sex, and 
Philadelphia resident status, was forwarded to an independent survey research firm (DataStat 
Inc) to recruit matched control participants.
Through random-digit dialing, we recruited 13- to 20-year-old control participants from 
households located within Philadelphia County using incidence-density sampling to recruit a 
population-based sample of Philadelphia youths.15-17 By doing so, we recruited control 
participants from the same source population (Philadelphia County) that gave rise to the case 
participants. A ±3-hour caliper match surrounding the homicide time was used to pair-match 
control participants to case participants to mitigate the effect of unmeasured confounders 
related to time and seasonal variation.17-20 Control participants were also pair matched to 
case participants by sex and indoor vs outdoor location at the time of each case participant’s 
homicide because high levels of mismatch were predicted in these 2 variables prior to 
recruitment.18
The current analysis includes all adolescent homicide case participants who were injured 
outdoors and their matched control participants. The recruitment of case and control 
participants at a 1:1 sampling ratio was based on a priori power calculations. However, to 
quickly identify control participants, there were several instances in which multiple 
interviewers simultaneously completed control participant interviews. This resulted in 13 
case participants who had more than 1 matched control participant, all of whom were 
retained in the analysis.

  Data Collection and Sources
Detailed information about case participants was obtained from the Philadelphia Child 
Death Review Case Reporting System in the Office of the Medical Examiner. This review is 
composed of an interdisciplinary team of municipal and private member organizations that 
jointly compile records for all deaths of Philadelphia children from birth through 21 years 
including information on the decedent, his or her family, and contextual characteristics. The 
Philadelphia Police Department provided the address location and circumstances of each 
homicide and the case participant’s arrest history. Toxicology results provided by the 
Medical Examiner’s Office established case participants’ substance use at the time of the 
homicide.
Control participants provided information on their demographic characteristics, delinquency 
history, and substance use in a structured telephone interview conducted at enrollment. 
Interviewers used prompts to help control participants accurately recall detailed information 
about their address location and substance use at the time of their matched case participants’ 
homicide. To minimize recall bias, control participant interviews were conducted within a 
median time of 11 days of their matched case participants’ homicide.
The population-based random sample survey was fielded to rapidly interview (within 1-2 
weeks) a representative sample of a specific group of hard-to-reach study participants (ages 
13 to 20 years) who were outdoors in a specific city (Philadelphia) within a specific time 
window (homicide time of a specific case participant). To maximize participation and avoid 
nonresponse and other selection biases, DataStat used multiple recruitment strategies.18,21 
Based on American Association for Public Opinion standard formulae, the cooperation rate 
for control participants was 73.4% and the response rate was 52.3%,22 which are as high or 
higher than rates achieved by other representative, random-sample surveys.23-26
Neighborhood-level potential confounders were geographically coded using latitude and 
longitude centroid points of Census tracts (household income and unemployment) and block 
groups (race/ethnicity) from 2010 US Census data. We used annual Philadelphia Police 
Department crime location data to create a geographically coded summary variable of total 
crimes per square mile (summing aggravated assaults, burglaries, robberies, disorderly 
conduct, theft, vandalism, illegal dumping, public drunkenness, and narcotic manufacture, 
possession, and sales). Case and control participants were assigned measures of their 
exposure to each neighborhood-level confounder based on homicide and matched control 
locations and the magnitude of the environmental factors surrounding them using inverse 
distance weighting (Census variables) and kernel density (crime) calculations. Census tracts 
and block groups, created as administrative boundaries, often do not represent the 
geographic scale best suited for particular studies of environmental effects.27,28 Using 
inverse distance weighting and kernel density measures, which are continuous and boundary 
free, allowed us to assign each case and control participant their own unique neighborhood 
exposure based on their exact location. This procedure avoids aggregation effects and does 
not require multilevel adjustments.29
To obtain microspatial data about modifiable features that were present in the immediate 
environments of our case and control participants, trained field staff conducted audits of all

 case and control participant address locations. Field staff were blinded to case/control 
participant status and were purposely delayed by 1 to 2 weeks in their field audits to avoid 
other official investigations (eg, by police). Full, 360° sets of photographs were taken from 
the street corner closest to each case participant (corresponding to the homicide address) and 
control location using a standardized field protocol. Photographs were uploaded and stitched 
into 360° high-resolution panoramas using Microsoft Photosynth software (eFigure 1 in the 
Supplement). Trained coders blinded to case/control participant status coded all panorama 
photographs for 60 visible elements of the built and social environments using a detailed 
code book (eTable in the Supplement). Photographs were assessed by multiple coders and 
any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
 Statistical Methods
We separately modeled associations between each environmental exposure of interest and 
adolescent homicide. We used conditional logistic regression to produce odds ratios (ORs) 
that accounted for matching on sex, hour of the day, and outdoor status using Stata version 
13 (StataCorp). Fully adjusted ORs adjusted for individual characteristics, including age in 
years (linear), race (black, white, or other), history of arrest (yes/no), and alcohol and drug 
use at the time of the homicide (yes/no), and neighborhood characteristics defined by inverse 
distance weighting/kernel density calculations, including median household income (linear), 
unemployment percentage (linear), percentage who were black (linear), percentage who 
were Hispanic (linear), and crimes per square mile (linear). A robustness check to assess 
alternative confounder forms (eg, quadratic) was not statistically significant and overall 
findings were unchanged. We examined stratified 2 × 2 tables, initial and fully adjusted 
standard errors to identify concerns related to sparse data and collapsed multicategory 
classifications when appropriate. We tested all models for collinearity and variance inflation 
factors were less than 2.5 in all instances. Statistical tests were 2-tailed, and P < .05 was 
used as the threshold for significance.
 Results
A total of 143 homicide case participants and 155 matched control participants were 
included. The median difference between case time and control time was 53.5 minutes 
(interquartile range, 18.5-104 minutes). Fifty-four percent were matched between 0 and 59 
minutes, 26% between 60 and 119 minutes, 18% between 120 and 179 minutes, and 2% at 
longer than 180 minutes. One hundred of the homicides occurred between 7 PM and 5 AM. 
On average, the mean control times were further from midnight than the case participant 
times by 11.3 minutes for these nighttime homicides.
Case participants tended to be older (18.4 vs 17.2 years), were more likely to be black 
(87.4% vs 55.5%), to have a history of arrest (67.1% vs 14.8%), and to have used drugs at 
the time of the homicide (17.5% vs 4.5%) (Table 1). Case locations had higher crime rates 
(1321.6 vs 1044.5 crimes per square mile) and lower percentage who were Hispanic (5.1% 
vs 6.4%). There were no significant differences in ethnicity, alcohol use, median household 
income, unemployment percentage, or percentage who were black. On average, 0.9% of 
individual characteristics and 1.7% of neighborhood characteristics were missing. Twelve

 case and 13 control participants (8%) were missing elements of the pictometry data. Case 
locations tended to cluster in high-risk neighborhoods, whereas control locations 
demonstrated geographic coverage of Philadelphia County, appropriately reflecting 
population-based sampling (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
 Association Between Street Conditions and Adolescent Homicide
In fully adjusted analyses, multiple features of Philadelphia streets were associated with 
adolescent homicide (Table 2). The presence of street lighting (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 
0.09-0.70), illuminated walk/don’t walk signs (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.92), painted 
marked crosswalks (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04-0.63), and public transportation visibility/
availability (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.49) were all significantly associated with decreased 
odds of homicide. Stop signs were associated with significantly increased odds of homicide 
(OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.40-13.45). Associations between homicide and trash, sidewalk 
condition, and street type were not significant in adjusted analyses.
 Association Between Building Conditions and Adolescent Homicide
Few features of building conditions were associated with adolescent homicide (Table 3). 
The odds of homicide were significantly higher in locations with security bars on houses 
(OR, 9.23; 95% CI, 2.45-34.80). The odds of homicide was 4.71 times higher in locations 
with row homes, although the 95% CI crossed just beyond 1 (95% CI, 0.99-22.47). Point 
estimates for the association between property type and homicide were less than 1 for 
commercial and mixed commercial/residential areas compared with residential areas, but 
adjusted estimates did not reach statistical significance. While the direction and magnitude 
of associations between homicide and other building features suggested both direct (building 
condition, broken windows, and visible furniture) and inverse (housing over store-fronts, 
pull-down metal fencing, security fences, and murals) associations, none of these 
associations were statistically significant in fully adjusted models.
 Association Between Natural Surroundings and Adolescent Homicide
Several features of natural surroundings were associated with adolescent homicide in fully 
adjusted analyses (Table 4). The presence of a park was associated with significantly lower 
odds of homicide (OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.88). The odds of homicide were significantly 
lower in locations with a maintained vacant lot (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.81). Private 
bushes/plantings were associated with 3.44 times higher odds of homicide (95% CI, 
1.18-10.01). Playgrounds, neglected vacant lots, trees, and public plantings were not 
significantly associated with homicide.
 Discussion
Using a population-based case-control design, we examined associations between 
environmental features and adolescent homicide in Philadelphia. After controlling for 
individual and neighborhood characteristics, multiple modifiable features of streets, 
buildings, and natural surroundings were significantly associated with adolescent homicide, 
highlighting potential targets for future place-based interventions.

 Homicide stems from a complex interplay of individual, relational, and environmental 
factors. Multiple theories concur with our findings. In framing these findings, the observed 
associations between homicide and the built environment support a nuanced view of broken 
windows theory, a common framework for thinking about the effect of neglected urban 
environments. This theory suggests that dilapidated public spaces and visible signs of 
disorder become part of a larger contagion effect that creates more disorder and ultimately 
crime, leaving communities disempowered to intervene.30 Our initial analyses found 
significant associations between homicide and signs of physical disorder, such as trash, poor 
sidewalk condition, and broken windows. Yet none of these associations maintained 
statistical significance in fully adjusted models. This is in contrast to research in adult 
populations that demonstrates significant associations between vacant properties and 
aggravated assault8 and simple building remediation, such as replacing broken windows, and 
reductions in violence.10 Given the growing evidence that associates physical disorder and 
crime8,10,31 and the ORs observed in the current study, future research should continue to 
assess the association and identify potential mediators between physical disorder and 
adolescent homicide.
A related, but more recent theory, suggests that busy streets and mixed residential-
commercial urban spaces create vibrant community contexts that encourage interactions and 
social connections among residents and facilitate social control, thus reducing crime.13 This 
theory suggests that features of the built environment can directly shape residents’ 
perceptions of safety and willingness to interact and monitor their neighborhoods. Built 
features that encourage higher street activity serve as deterrents to crime. Street lights, 
illuminated walk/don’t walk signs, marked crosswalks, and stops for public transportation 
are all environmental features that encourage busy streets through increased pedestrian 
activity and community interaction and were inversely associated with adolescent homicide 
in our analyses. In contrast, stop signs, which were associated with higher odds of homicide, 
may be markers of less busy settings in urban residential neighborhoods.
Urban land use and remediation offer additional modifiable factors that may influence the 
association between the built environment and youth homicide. Prior research has 
demonstrated associations between the greening of vacant lots and reductions in violent 
crime.9,32-35 The current study corroborates and supports this research—we found 
significant associations between well-maintained vacant lots and decreased odds of 
homicide. The presence of parks was also associated with a reduction in the odds of 
homicide, suggesting that the benefit of municipal green spaces extends beyond 
opportunities for physical and leisure activity.36 Parks and other green spaces encourage 
public gatherings and informal guardianship and have also been shown to mitigate 
psychological precursors to violence such as mental fatigue.37 Although we found no 
association between locations with trees or public plantings and homicide, the odds of 
homicide were significantly increased in locations with private plantings. Private plantings 
may obscure visibility along sidewalks and create opportunities for crime, potentially 
explaining the observed association.36,38 The findings related to maintained vacant lots and 
green space hold promise as targets for future place-based interventions. Researchers using 
this urban revitalization strategy should consider studying homicide reduction as a key 
health outcome.

  Limitations and Strengths
The current study had several limitations. Despite rigorous methods to recruit a 
representative population-based sample, selection bias among eligible control participants 
could have affected our results. While we adjusted for demographic differences between 
case and control participants and accounted for multiple potential individual and 
neighborhood confounders, it is possible that unmeasured individual, social, and contextual 
factors that we were unable to include may have influenced our findings. Owing to sparse 
data concerns, we also examined each of our environmental factors separately and were 
unable to draw conclusions about the potentially synergistic effects of multiple co-occurring 
environmental factors. Even in doing this, the number of case and/or control participants 
within certain strata was sometimes small and may have led to unstable estimates with wide 
confidence intervals in some of the associations we report here. Although it was possible 
that some environmental features might have changed between the index homicide and 
pictometry dates, we analyzed features of the built environment that likely changed little, if 
any, over this interval that was only a few weeks long. We also selected the corner closest to 
the index case/control location to protect participant confidentiality, but this may have 
resulted in up to a half block distance misclassification. Given the relatively short distance of 
Philadelphia city blocks, most features of the built environment that we coded were in view 
regardless of this minor distance misclassification. Finally, and very importantly, case-
control studies are observational by design and we have endeavored not to infer causation 
based on the associations observed here.
The key strengths of our study included a population-based case-control design with 
incidence-density sampling and detailed assessment of environmental features. Prior 
research has suggested that a more nuanced appreciation of specific features in the urban 
environment may be critical to our understanding of environmental risk and protective 
factors that adults and children encounter on a daily basis.10,39,40
 Future Directions
Based on our findings and prior research, several features emerged for consideration in 
future experimental or quasi-experimental studies of interventions to reduce adolescent 
violence. These features include lighting, pedestrian infrastructure, public transportation, 
parks, and remediated vacant spaces. Business improvement districts, vacant lot greening, 
enhanced sanitation, security, and usability of public spaces have all been associated with 
decreases in violent crime,9,11 coincide with our findings here, and may be promising 
avenues for future interventions that prevent broken windows and promote busy streets in 
urban areas.12 Community-based qualitative research and participatory methods may also 
offer more in-depth explanations of the causal mechanisms underlying these associations 
and any subsequent interventions.
 Conclusions
Using a novel population-based case-control design, this study provides valuable new 
information and quantitative findings regarding the associations between features of the 
immediate, surrounding environment and adolescent homicide. We identified multiple

 Key Points
Question
What modifiable features of streets, buildings, and natural surroundings are associated 
with adolescent homicide?
Findings
A population-based, case-control study of Philadelphia adolescents ages 13 to 20 years 
used pictometry to assess features at homicide and control locations. Street lights, 
illuminated walk/don’t walk signs, painted marked crosswalks, public transportation, 
parks, and maintained vacant lots were associated with significantly decreased odds of 
homicide. Stop signs, security bars on houses, and private bushes/plantings were 
associated with significantly increased odds of homicide.
Meaning
Modifiable environmental features identified here should be considered for future trials of 
place-based interventions to reduce youth violence.
