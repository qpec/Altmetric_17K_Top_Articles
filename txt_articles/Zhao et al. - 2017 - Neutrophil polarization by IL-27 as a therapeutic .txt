Shortly
after
intracerebral
hemorrhage,
neutrophils
infiltrate
the
intracerebral
hemorrhage-injured brain. Once within the brain, neutrophils degranulate, releasing
destructive molecules that may exacerbate brain damage. However, neutrophils also release
beneficial molecules, including iron-scavenging lactoferrin that may limit hematoma/iron-
mediated brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage. Here, we show that the immunor-
egulatory cytokine interleukin-27 is upregulated centrally and peripherally after intracerebral
hemorrhage. Data from rodent models indicate that interleukin-27 modifies neutrophil
maturation in the bone marrow, suppressing their production of pro-inflammatory/cytotoxic
products while increasing their production of beneficial iron-scavenging molecules, including
lactoferrin. Finally, interleukin-27 or lactoferrin administration results in reduced edema,
enhanced hematoma clearance, and improved neurological outcomes in an animal model of
intracerebral hemorrhage. These results suggest that interleukin-27/lactoferrin-mediated
modulations of neutrophil function may represent a therapeutically viable concept for the
modification of neutrophils toward a “beneficial” phenotype for the treatment of intracerebral
hemorrhage.

ntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke
with 30–67% mortality and poor prognosis for which no
effective therapy is currently available1–3. Rapid accumulation
of blood within the brain parenchyma causes compression and
primary “mechanical” brain damage. Only half of ICH-related
deaths occur within the first 2 days4, stressing the importance of
secondary brain injury in ICH pathogenesis, including the toxi-
city of hemolytic products (e.g., hemoglobin/heme/iron), oxida-
tive stress, and inflammation1, 2, 5–9. After ICH, microglia are
activated within minutes2 to release cytokines, chemokines, and
proteases, which coordinate the recruitment of potentially
damaging polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) from the per-
iphery into the ICH-affected brain10, 11.
While the first wave of PMNs enter the brain within hours,
PMNs continue to enter the ICH-affected site for several days
after ICH onset11. Once inside the brain, PMNs release various
microbial defense-related molecules that could aggravate ICH
pathogenesis, consistent with the finding that depletion of PMNs
prior to ICH could mitigate ICH-mediated injury12. However,
PMNs also release a subset of molecules that might benefit the
ICH-compromised brain, including iron-sequestering lactoferrin
(LTF) and hemoglobin-sequestering haptoglobin (Hp)13, 14. This
ratio of damaging to beneficial molecules may be important in
ICH pathogenesis and treatment. However, the relevance of
beneficial PMN-derived molecules in ICH is not completely clear
and is, in part, the subject of this report.
PMN maturation takes place in bone marrow (BM), where
developing PMNs (BM-PMN) accomplish the majority of protein
transcription, synthesis, and packaging into intracellular gran-
ules15. This maturation process defines the properties (chemical
composition, including LTF content) of mature PMNs. After
reaching terminal differentiation, PMNs are released from the
BM into circulation. Upon exiting the marrow, they retain their
BM-established phenotype and continue with only limited and
specific renewal of key proteins. Transcripts for many proteins,
including LTF, are not detected in mature PMNs16–19. After
injury, PMNs carry their prepared granule content to the site of
inflammation (here, the ICH-affected brain).
Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of
IL-27
p28,
which
is
unique
to
IL-27,
and
Epstein-Barr
Virus-Induced Gene 3 Protein (EBI3), a structural component
of both IL-27 and IL-3520, 21. IL-27 acts on various cell types,
including T cells, B cells, and macrophages via a heterodimeric
IL-27 receptor (IL-27R) composed of IL-27Rα and gp13022. IL-27
has many activities, including the unique ability to limit
inflammation23 and immune-mediated pathology associated with
autoimmune responses24, 25. By contrast, elevated expression of
IL-27 is reported in some pathological autoimmune conditions,
including
rheumatoid
arthritis26,
psoriasis27,
and
multiple
sclerosis28. IL-27 is mainly produced by activated dendritic cells
and macrophages, but has also been reported to be produced by
astrocytes25, 29. Interestingly, the IL-27R is also present on
PMNs20, 30, 31. Although there is very limited data, IL-27 and IL-
27R on PMNs has been proposed to contribute to the negative
regulation of reactive oxygen species and cytotoxic granule
component
production30,
31.
IL-27
also
modulates
haematopoietic stem cells’ differentiation into myeloid progeni-
tors22, 32, suggesting a regulatory function of IL-27 in modulating
PMN maturation and phenotype.
Therefore, we hypothesize that ICH induces the production of
immunoregulatory IL-27. Indeed, IL-27 signals to maturing PMN
in the BM, enhancing their production of potentially beneficial
proteins (including iron-sequestering LTF) and induces a less
harmful PMN phenotype that may benefit the ICH-compromised
brain. We thus demonstrate that pharmacological approaches
adopted from this pathway (IL-27 and LTF supplementation)
could be considered as potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate
ICH-mediated damage and to improve post-ICH recovery.

ICH induces production of IL-27 in the brain and periphery.
IL-27 is an immunoregulatory cytokine that may modulate
ICH-induced immune responses. Using a clinically relevant ani-
mal model, we induced ICH and measured the expression of IL-
27 over time. mRNA analysis showed that IL-27 p28 in the brain
increased within 1 h of ICH onset, peaked around 3 h, and then
declined over the next 2 days. The EBI3 increased similarly to
p28; however, its induction was long lasting and persisted for at
least for 14 days (Fig. 1a). The transient nature of IL-27 p28 gene
induction in the brain is mirrored by the transient elevation
(peaking at 1d) of IL-27 p28 protein in the CSF (Fig. 1b) and in
peripheral blood (Fig. 1c). Unexpectedly, ICH-induced IL-27
gene expression is elevated in the remotely positioned spleen
(Fig. 1d), with a temporal expression profile similar to that seen in
the brain, suggesting IL-27 protein elevations detected in
peripheral blood could originate from multiple sources, in both
the brain and periphery.
Microglia are the source of brain-derived IL-27. Prompted by
the animal studies showing a robust increase in IL-27 production
in the ICH-affected brain, we used cultured astrocytes, oligo-
dendroglia, microglia, and neurons (with and without exogen-
ously added red blood cells (RBCs) to mimic ICH in vitro) to
establish that microglia are the dominant cell type expressing IL-
27 mRNA (Fig. 2a–c). We established that the addition of RBCs
to microglia (a process that normally leads to engulfment of RBC
by microglia6, a critical step in post-ICH brain repair) augments
the mRNA synthesis of both IL-27 subsets only in microglia, but
not in other brain cell types (Fig. 2b, c). Finally, adding RBCs to
microglial culture augments IL-27 production and release, as

 determined by measuring IL-27 content in the culture media
(Fig. 2d). By comparing RBCs to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or
INFγ, two known inducers of IL-2733, we showed that RBCs are
uniquely effective in inducing IL-27 production in microglia
(Fig. 2d). This demonstrates that RBC-activated microglia pro-
duce and secrete IL-27, likely contributing to the overall increase
of IL-27 mRNA in the brain and IL-27 protein seen in the CSF in
animals after ICH (Fig. 1a).
IL-27 modifies PMN phenotypes in BM. IL-27 is a pleiotropic
cytokine that acts through IL-27R on PMNs30, cells that play a
central function in ICH pathogenesis11. We next examined
whether IL-27 could modify the phenotype of developing
BM-PMNs. BM-PMNs have wheel-like nuclei and constitute
5–20% of the total nucleated cells in BM. We purified these
BM-PMNs from mice 24 h after ICH and immediately cultured
the cells in vitro, incubated with or without recombinant IL-27
(rIL-27). After 24 h, cells were analyzed for gene expression of
pre-selected PMN components that could affect ICH pathogen-
esis. We detected downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes,
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), matrix metallopeptidase-9
(MMP-9), and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), and upregulation of
anti-inflammatory genes, hemoglobin-neutralizing Hp and iron-
sequestering LTF, with rIL-27 (Fig. 2e, f). Interestingly, IL-27
robustly increased the expression of its own receptor, IL-27R
(both of alpha subunit and gp130), suggesting that IL-27 can
amplify its own signal transduction in PMNs. Exposure to rIL-27
did not affect production of MPO, ELANE, or glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), indicating that the effect of
IL-27 was target-specific (Fig. 2e, f). In agreement with the uti-
lization of canonical signaling pathway by IL-27 in BM-PMNs,
the exposure to IL-27 caused increased phosphorylation of
STAT3 that was effectively reversed by a STAT3 inhibitor,
STATTIC (Fig. 2g).
We next asked whether the gain or loss of IL-27 after ICH
in vivo could augment or reverse this BM-PMN phenotype. Thus,
we injected mice after ICH with rIL-27, anti-IL-27 antibody (to
neutralize circulating IL-27 p28), or isotype IgG control and
2 days later harvested BM-PMN for gene analysis. IL-27
neutralization effectively reduced the amount of native IL-27 in
the blood plasma by 81% (p < 0.0003; n = 6). As anticipated, BM-
PMNs isolated from mice treated with anti-IL-27Ab, as compared
to BM-PMNs harvested from control mice, showed increased
pro-inflammatory gene expression and reduced expression of Hp,
LTF, and IL-27R (Fig. 3a). rIL-27 showed the opposite effect.
Again, no effect on myeloperoxidase, ELANE, or GAPDH
expression was noted. Ultimately, anti-IL-27Ab-treated mice

 showed worse neurological deficits score (NDS) as compared to
animals treated with control antibodies (Fig. 3b, c), suggesting
beneficial functions of IL-27 in ICH. Anti-IL-27Ab-treatment did
not significantly affect animal mortality after ICH (Fig. 3d). In
addition, flow cytometry on blood taken from animals at day 3
after
stroke
demonstrated
that
anti-IL-27-Ab
significantly
decreased the intensity of LTF per blood neutrophil (p = 0.02;
n = 3/group) after ICH (Fig. 3e, f).
rIL-27 treatment improves ICH outcomes. To test whether
IL-27 administration improves outcome after ICH, we subjected
mice to ICH and then treated with rIL-27. rIL-27 reduced
ICH-induced NDS, as demonstrated by several behavioral tests
(Fig. 4a), and also reduced brain edema (Fig. 4b). There was no
effect of IL-27 treatment on the number of PMNs infiltrating the
ICH-affected brain (12.2 ± 4.5 in control vs. 12.0 ± 4.1 in rIL-27-
treated), as determined on day 2. To verify whether this IL-27-
mediated benefit requires the presence of PMNs, we depleted
PMNs (44% reduction) by the administration of an anti-Ly6G
antibody in the IL-27-treated animals. We found that the
reduction of PMNs was associated with a modest but significant
loss of rIL-27 efficacy in reducing NDS (Fig. 4c) and the com-
promised body weight recovery (Fig. 4d), suggesting that PMNs
are, in part, required for the protective effects of IL-27 treatment
after ICH. The most intriguing by-product of rIL-27 treatment
was the improved removal of hemoglobin (Fig. 4e) and free iron
(Fig. 4f) from the ICH-affected brain. This suggests that seques-
tration of pro-oxidative hemoglobin and iron may represent an
underlying mechanism by which IL-27 improves outcome. To
explore how IL-27 mediates improved iron clearance, we focused
on the iron-binding LTF, a gene product that was upregulated in
BM-PMNs with IL-27 treatment (Fig. 2f).
rIL-27 helps the expression of iron-neutralizing LTF in PMNs.
Since PMNs are the main physiological source of LTF (a protein
with an exceptionally high affinity for sequestering iron), we
hypothesized that IL-27-modified PMNs could enhance the
delivery of LTF to the ICH-affected brain, augmenting the neu-
tralization of toxic iron and improve ICH outcome.
First, using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5a) or FACS staining
(Fig. 5b, c), we confirmed that LTF is indeed present in
BM-PMNs. Next, we demonstrated that treating animals or
freshly isolated BM-PMNs with rIL-27 upregulates LTF expres-
sion by BM-PMNs (Figs. 2f, 3a). We also harvested BM cells after
ICH from mice treated with rIL-27 or saline and analyzed the
cells using flow cytometry. We established that IL-27 treatment
does not alter the proportions of inflammatory monocytes (3.9 vs.
4.45%), T cells (2.6 vs. 2.0%), or PMNs (59 vs. 61%) present in the
BM. We also confirmed that only PMNs (CD45+CD11b+Ly6C
+Ly6G+ cells) produce LTF (Fig. 5b). Finally, we found that the
levels of LTF per PMN (as measured median fluorescence
intensity, MFI) is significantly higher in PMNs from animals
treated with rIL-27 (Fig. 5b, c), thus providing additional
evidence that IL-27 treatment could increase LTF content of
BM-PMNs in animals after ICH.

 Using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5d) and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 5e), we confirmed that LTF is
an abundant component of mature circulating PMNs and that
ICH (an insult that increases blood IL-27; see Fig. 1) increased
LTF content in the peripheral blood PMNs (Fig. 5e; middle bar),
and that rIL-27 treatment after ICH further augmented PMNs’
LTF content (Fig. 5d; red bar).
Importantly for ICH pathogenesis, using immunohistochem-
istry we detected LTF-positive PMNs in ICH-affected brain
(Fig. 5f). We also found LTF to be elevated in the ICH-affected
brains of animals treated with rIL-27 (Fig. 5g), despite the fact
that neither neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia nor microglia
(analyzed for mRNA expression; data not included), nor other
immune cells (Fig. 5b) express LTF. These data suggest that
PMNs may deliver LTF to the injured brain.
LTF reduces damage in models of ICH. Our final set of
experiments sought to establish the relevance of LTF as a treat-
ment for ICH. Since LTF is highly effective in the sequestration of
iron, and iron-mediated toxicity contributes to ICH-induced
damage, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of LTF using an
in vitro ICH-like injury model and clinically relevant ICH animal
models34–36.
We first employed an in vitro model, based on exposing
neuron-glia co-culture to RBC lysates. Using this model, we
showed that RBC lysates are toxic to neurons (Fig. 6a), and that
presence of recombinant LTF in culture media improves neuronal
survival in this injury model (Fig. 6b).
In the next experiment, we employed a well-validated ICH
model (based on an intrastriatal autologous blood injection) in
both rats (Fig. 6c–e) and mice (Fig. 6f, g)34, 36. First, in a proof of
concept experiment, we treated rats with LTF at 30 min after the
onset of ICH. These studies showed that LTF potently reduced
NDS (Fig. 6c), brain edema (Fig. 6d), and oxidative stress
(Fig. 6e). Second, using a mouse ICH model, we established that
LTF has a very long, clinically relevant therapeutic window. Mice
that received LTF as late as 24 h after ICH demonstrated a robust
decrease in NDS (Fig. 6f) and improved clearance of iron from
the hematoma-affected hemisphere (Fig. 6g).
Discussion
PMNs are the shortest-lived and most abundant cells of the
innate immune system. Following ICH, PMNs enter the affected
CNS within hours. Once there, they release various lytic enzymes
and generate free radicals that may damage the surrounding brain
tissue15. While PMNs are one of the first blood cell types to enter
the injured brain, they continue entering damaged tissue for up to
several weeks. This poses the question whether PMNs at the later
stages of ICH pathogenesis are of the same damaging phenotype
as these entering brain during the initial hours, and whether their
phenotype could be altered to ameliorate their damaging capacity
during recovery.
Our study is the first to demonstrate that IL-27 production
increases within an hour after ICH in the brain and periphery,
with increases seen in the ICH-affected brain (primarily from
microglia), CSF, spleen, and peripheral blood. We found that IL-

 27 acts upon maturing BM-PMNs (in vitro and in vivo) to modify
their phenotype, resulting in the induction of PMN components
such as Hp and LTF that could play beneficial or protective
functions in ICH while reducing the expression of potentially
harmful pro-inflammatory iNOS, MMP9, or NOX2. Most
importantly, we found that these effects of IL-27 treatment
coincide with its therapeutic benefit in an ICH model, including
reduced brain edema and an improvement in acute and sub-acute
functional outcomes. Furthermore, we have also shown for the
first time that LTF, a protein highly expressed in PMNs, is sig-
nificantly increased in BM-PMNs, circulating PMNs, and the
ICH-affected brain in response to the treatment with rIL-27.
Most importantly, direct treatment with LTF produces a similar
therapeutic effect to IL-27 treatment in our ICH model.
PMNs are short-lived myeloid cells that originate and mature
in the BM15. Most PMN constituents are synthesized at various
stages of their development before storage in various intracellular
granules15; and mature PMNs entering circulation act as shuttles
to deliver these constituents to the site of infection or tissue
damage16–19. After degranulation (release of the granule content),
circulating PMNs retain only a partial capacity to renew these
constituents, indicating that the biological properties of PMNs at
the site of their infiltration may depend on their phenotype (the
chemical
composition
of
their
granules)
that
was
pre-established in the BM. Thus, based on the outcome of our
present study, it is likely that IL-27 generated in response to ICH
could signal through the IL-27R30 on maturing PMNs in the BM
to modify PMN phenotype to a less neurotoxic (or even some-
what beneficial) type. Indeed, depletion of PMNs prior to ICH
mitigates ICH-induced damage12, while post-ICH depletion of
PMNs has a neutral effect (as seen in our present study), sug-
gesting a potential temporal difference in the function that PMNs
play in ICH pathogenesis. Finally, our results suggest that IL-27 is
less effective in reducing ICH-mediated damage in PMN-depleted
animals, implying that IL-27-modified PMNs entering the ICH-
affected brain during the sub-acute phase may cause less damage
and possibly augment the recovery process. Furthermore, our
study indicates that BM-PMNs exposed to IL-27 upregulate the
IL-27R itself, suggesting that IL-27 acts in a feed-forward
mechanism
to
further
amplify
and
strengthen
the
anti-
inflammatory phenotype of PMNs.
The mechanisms responsible for the increased IL-27 level in
the blood and CSF after ICH has not been studied in this project;
however, it is possible that IL-27 generated by the ICH-activated
microglia could enter the peripheral circulation and or CSF and
contribute to its elevated levels. Furthermore, we have observed
that after ICH, expression of IL-27 is also elevated in the spleen.
While we do not know the routes of communication between
ICH-affected brain and spleen, the earlier research demonstrated
that chemical (e.g., damage-associated molecular pattern mole-
cules, such as HMGB137) and/or electrical (efferent neurogenic
polysynaptic relay through the vagus nerve38) signals originating
from the injured brain could modulate the spleen activities, that
could also include IL-27 production.

 While the effect of IL-27 on PMNs is likely important, the
therapeutic effect of IL-27 in ICH may also include the regulation
of various components of the immune system, including B, T, and
NK cells15, 24, 25. This is especially important, as various immune
cells are implicated in ICH pathobiology39, 40. However, we have
also demonstrated here that LTF (a protein whose main systemic
source is circulating PMNs) is upregulated in PMNs in response
to IL-27 and that LTF, when used therapeutically, protects from
ICH-induced brain edema and neural tissue damage. In addition
to LTF, IL-27 enhanced the expression of Hp, a key acute phase
hemoglobin-detoxifying protein36. In our earlier work, we
showed that Hp plays an essential function in protecting the brain
from blood toxicity after ICH36. Taken together, this evidence
argues that PMNs may augment the detoxification of cytotoxic
hemoglobin and iron, two components associated with secondary
brain injury after ICH1, 7.
In addition to upregulating the beneficial components of
PMNs, IL-27 reduced the expression of NOX2, MMP-9, and
iNOS, enzymes that could aggravate ICH pathogenesis. NOX2 is
a key constituent of NADPH oxidase41, which is highly abundant
in PMNs and is a main source of PMN-generated superoxide and
oxidative damage at the site of ICH-induced inflammation.
Genetic disruption of NADPH oxidase has been demonstrated to
protect animals from ICH-mediated damage42. The inducible
form of NOS (iNOS) is highly expressed in PMNs and was
demonstrated to contribute to brain tissue damage following
ischemic stroke43. As ICH triggers robust PMN recruitment into
the ICH-affected brain parenchyma11, amelioration of iNOS
expression in PMNs with IL-27 may have a protective effect.
PMN-derived MMP-9 contributes to extracellular matrix and
basal lamina degradation, blood-brain-barrier disruption, and
hemorrhagic transformation44, 45. MMP-9 inhibition was shown
to effectively ameliorate damage associated with ICH46. However,
MMP-9 is proposed to act as important contributor to post-
stroke remodeling and repair at later stage47. It is interesting to
note that IL-27 caused only partial inhibition of MMP-9
expression, suggesting it may play a limited function in the
improved functional outcomes seen in this study. However, fur-
ther studies to address these issues are warranted.
One of the most promising findings of this study is the iden-
tification of LTF, a pleotropic iron-binding glycoprotein from the
transferrin family, as a potential innate defense mechanism
against damage caused by ICH. LTF is a well-conserved 80 kDa
protein found in mucosal secretions as a product of epithelial cells
and in the specific granules of PMNs48. LTF is generally recog-
nized as a first-line defense molecule in protection against
microbial infections due to its ability to sequester iron away from
invading microbes49. One molecule of LTF can bind two iron
atoms with the extraordinary high affinity (Kd~10−22 M). Unlike
other iron binding proteins, LTF retains iron molecules even at
low pH50. This property is important in sequestering free iron to
form iron–LTF complexes in inflamed tissue (acidic pH), pre-
venting free Fe2+ engagement in Fenton’s reaction which pro-
duces oxidative damage and inflammation7. This is particularly
important in ICH pathogenesis, as the RBC in the ICH hematoma
undergo hemolysis, generating large quantities of hemoglobin,
heme and iron, leading to oxidative damage to brain cells and the
neurovasculature1, 7, 8, 36, 51. Thus, iron neutralization by LTF
may represent an essential step in the removal of free iron and the
reduction of iron-mediated oxidative damage. Since PMNs are a
key source of peripheral LTF, and PMNs can carry LTF to the
ICH-affected area, we postulate that PMNs play an essential
function in mitigating iron-mediated oxidative damage to brain
tissue after ICH. Furthermore, our data indicate that approaches
that augment LTF content in PMNs represent promising ther-
apeutic strategies for improved outcomes after ICH.
In contrast to most experimental and clinical studies to date,
which used various types of LTF not fully compatible for human
parenteral administration, in the present study we employed GLP
quality recombinant LTF expressed based on the wild-type
sequence in eukaryotic cells. This approach guarantees that the
LTF used in our study is correctly glycosylated and possess
optimal bioactivities52. And LTF robustly improved iron removal
and reduced oxidative stress, brain edema, and neurologic dys-
function, suggesting that direct LTF supplementation represents a
viable candidate for ICH treatment. Since LTF can penetrate the
BBB53, we believe that parenteral LTF administration could
directly improve iron neutralization at the site of ICH. Most
importantly, our studies demonstrate a robust protective effect of
LTF when given early after ICH or even 24 h after ICH, indicating
a uniquely long therapeutic window.
In conclusion, our studies demonstrate the following: (1) in
response to ICH, IL-27 is produced in the brain (with microglia
serving as the primary brain cell source) and also in the spleen;
(2) IL-27 acts on developing PMNs in BM to reprogram the
expression of various genes known for their strong relevance to
ICH pathogenesis, while (3) improving ICH outcome, reducing
edema and augmenting iron and hemoglobin clearance from the
ICH-affected brain; (4) neutralization of IL-27 after ICH aggra-
vates the injury; (5) IL-27-mediated protection is reduced in
PMN-depleted animals; (6) IL-27 augments the production of
LTF in PMNs; and (7) LTF used as a therapeutic agent robustly
reduces the damage caused by ICH with 24 h therapeutic window.
We propose that LTF released from PMNs entering the ICH-
affected brain may neutralize iron toxicity, and that IL-27 may
augment this process (Fig. 7). This study also shows a novel
function of IL-27 in PMN polarization based on reciprocal
communication between brain and BM. Therefore, modulation of
IL-27 and LTF and their associated pathways may represent
novel, powerful targets for the treatment of ICH.

Fig. 7 In response to injury caused by ICH, activated brain microglia and
spleen rapidly produce IL-27 (1), a cytokine, which modifies the developing
PMNs in the BM to express more of a potent iron-sequestrating LTF and
less of pro-inflammatory factors (2). This process is referred to as PMNs
polarization. In consequence, these polarized PMNs may carry more
cytoprotective LTF. Upon entering the injured brain, the PMNs may release
more LTF that through sequestrating the cell-free ferric iron (produced due
to intra-hematoma hemolysis) alleviates oxidative stress, ICH-deposited
iron, and ultimately neurological damage

 at Houston. All studies were performed using a randomization (coin toss)
approach and all analyses were performed by investigators blinded to treatment
assignments (animals were coded for the group allocation). Animals were kept in a
specific pathogen-free/SPF environment and were fed a standard mouse/rat diet,
and housed in standard mouse/rat cages on a 12-h inverted light–dark cycle.
Behavioral analyses were carried out from the hours of 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
ICH in rat and mice. ICH in rat and mouse was induced by intra-striatal injection
of autologous blood as described previously6, 34, 35. Briefly, male Sprague Dawley
(SD) rats (250–350 g) or male C57BJ6 mice (25–30 g) under chloral hydrate
anesthesia (0.35 g/kg; i.p.) were immobilized onto a stereotaxic frame. A 1-mm-
diameter burr hole was drilled in the skull and a 26-gauge stainless steel cannula
was inserted for blood infusion (collected from femoral artery; 15 μl/5 min for
mice, or 35 μl/5 min for rats) into the left corpus striatum (for SD rat, 0.5 mm
anterior to bregma and 4.0 mm lateral to midline, and 5.6 mm deep to skull; for
mouse, 0.0 mm anterior to bregma and 3.0 mm lateral to midline, and 3.5 mm deep
to skull). Core body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C during entire
surgery and for 2 h afterward.
Tissue harvesting. Animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (0.5 g/kg; i.p.)
and intracardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. Subsequently, for histology or bio-
chemical analyses, the spleen, whole brains, or the sub-dissected tissues repre-
senting the area of sub-cortical striatum affected by ICH were snap frozen by
submersion in –80 °C 2-methylbutane and stored in −80 °C freezer prior to
cryosectioning, RNA isolation, or protein analyses.
Blood preparation and cerebrospinal fluid harvesting. Blood serum or plasma
from rat or mouse was obtained via cardiac puncture. Freshly drawn whole blood
(500 μl–1 ml) in a micro-centrifuge tube was allowed to clot (30 min–2 h after
harvesting at 4 °C) before centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min (4 °C)54. The
supernatant (serum) was transferred to another micro-centrifuge tube and stored
in −80 °C freezer until being used for ELISA assay. To harvest plasma, whole blood
from cardiac puncture was collected in EDTA-coated tube (BD Vacutainer, K2
EDTA) before centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for
ELISA assay. The cerebrospinal fluid (50–100 μl) from SD rats was collected from
the cisterna magna. After centrifugation (400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the super-
natant were transferred to another micro centrifuge tube and stored in −80 °C
freezer until being used for ELISA assay.
IL-27 ELISA. The amount of IL-27 in rat microglial culture medium and IL-27 in
CSF after ICH was measured using a rat IL-27 p28 ELISA kit (MBS2601322, My
BioSource). The samples were diluted at 1:5 (for CSF) or 1:2 (for culture medium)
with the Standard Diluent provided in the kit and then measured against the
standard at 0–500 pg/ml, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The IL-27
p28 in mouse serum or plasma was measured using mouse IL-27 p28 ELISA kit
(MBS176517, My Bioscience) and multiplex MAP mouse Th17 Magnetic Bead kit
(MT17MAG47K-PX25, Millipore). The serum were first diluted in the Standard
Diluent provided in the ELISA kit and then measured against the standard at
0–250 pg/ml, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Primary cortical neuron cultures. The cortices of E-18 pre-natal embryos were
dissected and dissociated by triturating as we previously described55, with some
modification. The dissociated cells were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated culture
plates in Neurobasal medium with B27 at 300–700 cells/mm2. The cells were
maintained in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 21% O2) at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C. Half of the
culture medium was changed every 3 days. After a total of 9–12 days in culture, the
neuronal cells formed extensive axonal and dendritic networks and were ready for
the experiments. Using MAP2 immunofluorescence, we confirmed that ≥90%
living cells were MAP2+ neurons.
Astrocyte/oligodendrocyte/microglia cultures. The individual primary cortical
glial cell cultures were isolated and purified from rat brain co-cultures using p1-p2
pups, as we previously described6. First, the cells from brain cortices were seeded in
75 cm2 TC flasks and cultured for 14 days. The loosely adherent microglia were
harvested from the culture medium after slight shaking. After centrifugation at
400 × g for 5 min, microglia were collected and re-plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated
TC plates, with or without 12-mm diameter German-glass, at a density of 1–4 ×
105 cells/ml. After removing the microglia, the co-culture flasks were continuously
shaken at a speed of 220 rpm for 30 min to remove the other loosely attached cells
including microglia and proliferating cells (cells at the proliferating stage are
loosely attached to the astrocyte layer, and thereby relatively easily shaken off). The
co-culture flasks were then changed into fresh culture medium and agitated at 220
rpm for 16–20 h to harvest the oligodendrocytes. After the above shaking steps, the
tightly attached cell layer on the tissue culture flasks consisted primarily of
astrocytes. Using immunostaining for microglia (CD68, MCA341, Serotec), oli-
godendrocytes (OSP, Ab7474, Abcam), and astrocytes (GFAP, G3893,
Sigma-Aldrich), we confirmed that microglia cultures 24 h after re-plating were
≥ 96% pure; oligodendrocyte-rich cultures 10 days after re-plating were ≥ 84%
pure; and the astrocyte-rich cultures 10 days after re-plating were ≥ 90% pure.
LTF treatment of co-cultured cells. For the cell culture experiments, 5 μg/ml
recombinant human lactoferrin (rLTF) was applied to the cortical neuron-glia
co-culture medium at 30 min before adding lysed RBC, and continuously incubated
for 24 h after incubating in RBS lysate. The cells were then fixed for MAP2-
immunofluorescence, GFAP-immunofluorescence, or NeuN-immunofluorescence
labeling and cell counting.
Blood PMNs isolation. Peripheral blood was drawn via cardiac puncture and
blood PMNs were purified by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation as described56.
Mouse PMNs were further purified using Anti-Ly-6G MicroBeads kit (Miltenyi
Biotec) and EasySepTM mouse Neutrophil Enrichment kit (STEMCELLTM
Technologies).
LTF ELISA. LTF levels in blood serum and blood-derived PMN lysates were
measured using a rat LTF ELISA kit (MBS728256, MyBioSource.com).
BM-precursor PMNs. The precursors of PMNs (metamyelocytes, myelocytes,
promyelocytes, and myeloblasts) present in BM were harvested using gradient
centrifugation as previously described, with minor modifications57, 58. Briefly, rat
or mouse BM was harvested from femurs and tibias of both hind legs by flushing
with ice-cold Ca++/Mg++-free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) using a 1 ml
syringe (22G needle). After centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min, the RBCs in the cell
pellet were removed with RBC Lysis Buffer and the cells were rinsed with HBSS.
Next, the cell pellet was re-suspend in 3–6 ml 45% Percoll Solution and the cells
were filtered through a cell strainer of 100 μm porosity to eliminate eventual cell
clumps and fat aggregates. The cells were loaded on top of a discontinuous Percoll
density gradient (from the bottom of a 15 ml falcon tube, a sequence of 81% (3 ml),
62% (2 ml), 55% (2 ml), and 50% (2 ml) Percoll solutions). After centrifugation at
700 × g for 30 min (without the brake), we collected the cells from the interface of
the 62/81% (mature PMN fraction) and also from 62/55% (immature-to-mature
PMN), and 55/50% (immature PMN), and washed them with HBSS before culture
or other use.
RBC isolation. Rat blood RBC were prepared using column density gradient
centrifugation (BD Vacutainer® CPT™) as reported6.
Flow cytometry. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture into tubes anti-
coagulated with 4% citric acid. Two femurs from each mouse were dissected out
and flushed with 10 ml of RPMI1640 culture medium. RBC in blood and BM were
lysed with an ammonium chloride solution (Stem Cell Technologies). Cell number
was quantified on a BD Countess Cell Counter and all samples were diluted to a
concentration of 500,000 cells/ml. Blood and BM leukocytes were washed, stained
for viability, and blocked with mouse Fc Receptor Blocking Solution fluorophores:
CD45-vf450, CD11b−APC-Cy7, and Ly6G-PE, Ly6C-APC, CD3-Pe-Cy7. For
intracellular staining for LTF, cells were incubated in a fixation/permeabilization
buffer (BD Biosciences) for 20 min, then washed and incubated with a rabbit
anti-mouse lactoferrin primary antibody (L-3262, Sigma-Aldrich) or rabbit
anti-mouse control IgG for 30 min. After washing, cells were incubated with a goat
anti-rabbit secondary conjugated to AlexaFluor488 (Invitrogen) for 30 min. For full
details on all targets, antibody clones, sources and dilutions for antibodies, and
staining reagents used, please see Supplementary Table 3. Data were acquired on a
Cytoflex S cytometer (Beckmann Coulter) and analyzed by FlowJo Software (Tree
Star). PMNs were identified as CD45+CD11b+Ly6CIntLy6G+ cells, inflammatory
monocytes were identified as CD45+CD11b+Ly6CHighLy6G− cells, and T cells were
identified as CD45+CD11b−CD3+ cells. Fluorescence minus one controls and/or
isotype controls were used to determine positive gates for each antibody. The MFI
of LTF was quantified within the PMN population, with T cells and inflammatory
monocytes serving as negative controls for LTF fluorescence. For full details
regarding the flow cytometry gating strategy for Figs. 3e and 5c, please see Sup-
plementary Fig. 1.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The ipsilateral
striatum surrounding the hematoma was dissected on ice, snap-frozen, and pro-
cessed for mRNA extraction using Trizol-Reagents. The primary brain cells or
purified BM-PMNs in culture were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed in
Trizol-Reagent. RT-PCR analyses were done as described previously6, 59. GAPDH
was used as an internal standard. The sequences of primers are listed in Supple-
mentary Table 1. Measurements of the gene products were normalized to the
optical density of GAPDH bands. The results were calculated as optical density or
percentage change over the control (naïve animal in vivo; media control in vitro).
Western blot. Protein levels were determined using Western blotting, as pre-
viously described6. Rabbit anti-lactoferrin (bs-5810R, Bioss), mouse anti-STAT3
(9139 Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p-STAT3 (9131S, Cell Signaling), or chicken anti-

 GAPDH (Millipore, AB2302) immunopositive bands were visualized using goat
anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (invitrogen) or goat anti-chicken IgG-HRP (Invitrogen) and
ECL (Pierce, Rockford, IL) (see Supplementary Table 2 for more information).
Semi-quantification of luminescence signal intensity on X-ray film was determined
by the analyses of optical density, using a Computer-Assisted Kodak Analysis
(EDAS) 290 system. Western blots of Fig. 2g (STAT3) and Fig. 5g (LTF) are
included as Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.
Immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemistry for rat or mouse lactoferrin, IL-27
p28, PMNs (ELANE), MAP2, NeuN, and GFAP was performed using the proce-
dure as described6. Briefly, cells grown on German Glass, or smears of blood on
glass slides, or spots of BM-PMNs on glass slides and coronal brain sections were
treated with 95% methanol containing 5% acetic acid for 10 min at −20 °C and then
incubated with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) overnight at 4 °C. Goat
anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-rat IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 546
(Invitrogen, USA) was used to visualize the fluorescent signals. The nuclei were
visualized with DAPI. The immunofluorescence signals were observed under a
Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope, which was equipped with CCD camera
and operated by MetaMorph 7.4 software. The images were acquired using the
filter sets at Ex/Em of 490/520 nm for Alexa Fluor 488, Ex/Em of 550/575 nm for
Alexa Fluor 546, and Ex/Em of 365/480 nm for DAPI-labeled nuclei.
PMNs counting. The number of PMNs from each brain section at the needle
insertion site is calculated. PMN cell counting in mouse peripheral blood was per-
formed with tail blood smears on slides after immunofluorescent labeling with a rat
anti-PMN antibody (ELANE, ab53457, Abcam). The digitized images (4 × 4 images
under 20× lens) were acquired and stitched and the number of ELANE+-neutrophils
was automatically counted with CellSens software (Olympus).
NDS measurement. All behavioral tests in mice and rats were conducted in a quiet
and low-lit room by an experimenter blinded with respect to the treatment groups.
Pre-tests were done to exclude abnormal animals. Only animals with less than 20%
foot-faults and animals that had no preference in forelimb placing were subjected
to ICH. An individual test score and a combination test score from a battery of
behavioral tests (Foot-fault, Forelimb Placing, Postural Flexing, Wire and Circling)
was used to measure the NDS, as we reported earlier6, 60. Grand composite NDS
combined all the tests assumed an equal weight of each of the tests.
IL-27/anti-IL-27 Ab and LTF administration. Recombinant mouse IL-27 (rIL-27,
577404, Biolegend, a heterodimer of mouse recombinant IL-27 EBI3 and p28
linked by a GGGSGGGSGGGTGGGS linker) at 50 ng/kg was administered i.v. at
0.5, 24, and 42 h after ICH for the experiments probing 48 and 72 h outcomes. In
the sub-acute study, rIL-27 (50 ng/kg) was administered i.v. at 30 min and then
daily s.c., day 1 to 6 after ICH. To assess the therapeutic relevance of IL-27, we
treated mice with rIL-27 (as above) or with mouse anti-IL-27 antibody (αIL-27;
Biolegend, 516912) at 40 μg/mouse i.v. at 0.5, 24, and 42 h after ICH to neutralize
endogenous IL-27, with mice injected with rat IgG1 (400427, Biolegend) serving as
a control. We measured the LTF content in mature blood PMNs and expression of
selected genes in BM-PMNs at 48 h with LTF ELISA, the LTF content in mature
blood PMNs at 72 h with flow cytometry, and the NDS at 72 h and 7 days. For
in vivo LTF experiments, rLTF (gift from PharmaReview Corporation, Houston,
TX) was dissolved in saline and administered i.v. at 5 mg/kg, starting 30 min after
ICH, plus 2.5 mg/kg, p.o. on day 1 and day 2 after ICH, with outcome measure-
ments on day 3 in the acute treatment experiments. Saline was used as the vehicle
control. For the sub-acute study, recombinant mouse LTF (gift from PharmaRe-
view Corporation, Houston, TX) was dissolved in saline and administered 5 mg/kg,
i.v. at 24 h after ICH plus 2.5 mg/kg, p.o., on days 2–7. Saline was used as the
vehicle control. Outcomes were measured on day 1, 3, 7, and 14.
PMNs depletion in mice after ICH. To understand the function of PMNs in
rIL-27-induced protection (Biolegend, 577404, a heterodimer of mouse recombi-
nant IL-27 EBI3 and p28 linked by a GGGSGGGSGGGTGGGS linker), we injected
rat monoclonal α-Ly-6G, a PMN depleting antibody (BioXCell, 1A8, BE0075) at
500 μg/mouse at 2, 24, and 72 h after ICH (i.p.). A rat IgG 2a isotype control
antibody (BioXCell, 2A3, BE0089) was used as the control. We measured PMN
numbers in the peripheral blood to confirm the efficacy of PMN depletion. NDS
was measured on day 1 and day 3 after ICH.
Hematoma size measurement. Hematoma resolution was assessed by measuring
the amount of hemoglobin remaining in the hematoma-affected brain on day 7
after ICH, as detailed previously6. Briefly, mice under chloral hydrate anesthesia
were perfused with ice-cold PBS to remove intravascular hemoglobin. Intrapar-
enchymal hemoglobin in the homogenized ipsilateral striatum was measured using
Drabkin’s reagent6, 61. Peripheral blood (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 20 μl) was added to the
homogenate of naïve perfused brain and used to prepare a standard calibration
curve. The data were expressed as blood volume per brain homogenate.
Non-heme brain tissue iron determination. To establish the location of iron in
the brain sections, we used enhanced Perl’s reaction62. Brain sections fixed with 2%
formalin were incubated in Perl’s solution (1:1, 5% potassium ferrocyanide and 5%
HCl) for 45 min. After washing with distilled water, the sections were incubated in
0.5% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride with nickel for 60 min.
To quantify non-heme iron in the ICH-affected brain, animals were perfused
with saline before decapitation. A coronal 4-mm thick slice centered on the
injection needle tract was generated, divided into ipsilateral and contralateral sides
and weighed out. The tissue iron content was determined according to a method
described by Weinfeld et al.63 using an Iron Colorimetric Assay Kit (CFE-005,
JaICA). Briefly, the brain tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of dH2O. After adding 1
ml of 8.5 M HCl the brain tissue samples were hydrolyzed at 90 °C for 60 min.
After cooling, 2 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added to precipitate proteins,
and supernatant was collected after centrifugation. The supernatant was run
through an acid-washed filter, and the precipitate was washed with 1 ml of 4.25 M
HCl plus 20% trichloroacetic acid (1:1). The supernatant was collected, and 4 ml of
1 M sodium citrate was added. The pH was adjusted to 3.1, and the final volume
was adjusted to 25 ml. The total non-heme iron content was assayed with
Spectrometer at 560 nm against iron standards.
Brain edema. Brain edema was measured using the wet weight/dry weight
method36. Briefly, the brains were removed without perfusion and the ICH-affected
brain hemispheres were dissected. A brain coronal section (4-mm thick; 2 mm
anterior and 2 mm posterior to the blood injection site) was excised. The tissue
weight was determined before and after drying in a 95 °C oven for 48 h. Brain
edema was expressed as percent of water content: (wet weight−dry weight)/wet
weight × 100.
Statistical analyses. Data were expressed as a mean ± SEM. For in vitro experi-
ments, we pooled samples from three culture wells and repeated the experiments
three times. We performed statistical analyses using the GraphPad and InStat
programs and SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) fol-
lowed by Newman–Keuls post-test was used for multiple comparisons. Paired
t-test was used when two groups were compared. Two-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni post-test to compare replicate means was used to compare NDS
between two groups at different time points. Also, the longitudinal data analysis
was performed using the mixed effects model.
