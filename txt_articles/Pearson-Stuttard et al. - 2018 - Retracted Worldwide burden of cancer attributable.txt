Worldwide burden of cancer attributable to diabetes and 
high body-mass index: a comparative risk assessment
Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard, Bin Zhou, Vasilis Kontis, James Bentham, Marc J Gunter, Majid Ezzati
Summary
Background Diabetes and high body-mass index (BMI) are associated with increased risk of several cancers, and are 
increasing in prevalence in most countries. We estimated the cancer incidence attributable to diabetes and high BMI 
as individual risk factors and in combination, by country and sex. 
Methods We estimated population attributable fractions for 12 cancers by age and sex for 175 countries in 2012. We 
defined high BMI as a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m². We used comprehensive prevalence estimates of 
diabetes and BMI categories in 2002, assuming a 10-year lag between exposure to diabetes or high BMI and incidence 
of cancer, combined with relative risks from published estimates, to quantify contribution of diabetes and high BMI 
to site-specific cancers, individually and combined as independent risk factors and in a conservative scenario in which 
we assumed full overlap of risk of diabetes and high BMI. We then used GLOBOCAN cancer incidence data to 
estimate the number of cancer cases attributable to the two risk factors. We also estimated the number of cancer cases 
in 2012 that were attributable to increases in the prevalence of diabetes and high BMI from 1980 to 2002. All analyses 
were done at individual country level and grouped by region for reporting. 
Findings We estimated that 5·6% of all incident cancers in 2012 were attributable to the combined effects of diabetes 
and high BMI as independent risk factors, corresponding to 792 600 new cases. 187 600 (24·5%) of 766 000 cases of 
liver cancer and 121 700 (38·4%) of 317 000 cases of endometrial cancer were attributable to these risk factors. In the 
conservative scenario, about 4·5% (626 900 new cases) of all incident cancers assessed were attributable to diabetes 
and high BMI combined. Individually, high BMI (544 300 cases) was responsible for twice as many cancer cases as 
diabetes (280 100 cases). 26·1% of diabetes-related cancers (equating to 77 000 new cases) and 31·9% of high BMI-
related cancers (174 040 new cases) were attributable to increases in the prevalence of these risk factors from 
1980 to 2002.
Interpretation A substantial number of cancer cases are attributable to diabetes and high BMI. As the prevalence of 
these cancer risk factors increases, clinical and public health efforts should focus on identifying optimal preventive 
and screening measures for whole populations and individual patients.

Introduction
Diabetes and high body-mass index (BMI), defined as a 
BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m², are leading 
causes of mortality and morbidity globally1 and their 
prevalence has increased substantially over the past four 
decades in most countries.2,3 The global age-standardised 
adult prevalence of diabetes was reported to be 9·0% in 
men and 7·9% in women in 2014, affecting about 
422 million adults.3 In 2016, the age-standardised adult 
prevalence of overweight and obesity (those with BMI 
≥25 kg/m²) was estimated to be 38·5% in men and 
39·2% in women, affecting approximately 2·01 billion 
adults globally.2 
The International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) 
have concluded that there is a causal association between 
high BMI and colorectal,4 gallbladder,5 pancreas,6 kidney,7 
liver,8 endometrial,9 postmenopausal breast,10 ovarian,11 
gastric cardia,12 and thyroid cancer,13 as well as oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma14 and multiple myeloma.13 A study in 
2015 estimated that about 3·6% of all cancer cases in 2012 
were attributable to high BMI.15 Since then, high BMI has 
been thought to have a causal relationship with additional 
site-specific cancers8,13,14,16 and more recent and more 
detailed global BMI prevalence estimates, based on 
substantially more data, have become available.2 Diabetes 
is increasingly recognised as a risk factor for colorectal, 
pancreatic, liver, gallbladder, breast, and endometrial 
cancer,17 but the global cancer burden attributable to 
diabetes has not been quantified. Furthermore, since 
high BMI is an important risk factor for diabetes, priority 
setting for public health and clinical interventions 
requires information on the cancer burden attributable to 
both high BMI and diabetes. We aimed to estimate the 
proportion of global cancer incidence in 2012 that was 
attributable to diabetes and high BMI individually and 
combined, under varying assumptions about the 
independence of their effects.

Methods
Study design
We reviewed the WCRF continuous update projects, 
IARC publications, and other published literature that 
summarised associations of diabetes17 and high BMI 
with site-specific cancers.4–14 We searched MEDLINE via 
PubMed for articles published up to June 30, 2017, with 
no language restrictions using the search terms 
(“Diabetes” OR “Body-mass index” OR “Overweight”, 
OR “Obesity”), AND (“Cancer risk”, OR “Cancer 
incidence”), AND “Attributable fraction”. We selected 
cancers that the WCRF and IARC have judged to have a 
causal association with high BMI: colorectal, gallbladder, 
pancreatic, liver, postmeno 
pausal breast, endometrial, 
kidney, ovarian, stomach cardia, and thyroid cancer, 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and multiple myeloma. 
For diabetes, we identified pub 
lished meta-analyses17 of 
the relative risks (RR) for the association of diabetes 
with site-specific cancer. The studies included in the 
meta-analyses had applied rigorous adjustment to 
control for potential confounding factors, including 
BMI. The RRs for each site-specific cancer applied in 
our analysis and their sources are detailed in the 
appendix (pp 1, 2). For the diabetes analysis we included 
colorectal, gallbladder, pancreatic, liver, breast, and 
endometrial cancer. 
High BMI has also been proposed to be causally 
associated with meningioma.13 However, most mening-
iomas are benign and the incidence of meningioma is 
not reported in GLOBOCAN. The association between 
high BMI and oesophageal and stomach cancer is limited 
to oesophageal adenocarcinoma14 and stomach cardia12 
cancer; therefore, we only included these two subtypes in 
our analysis.
Using prevalence of diabetes3 and of categories of BMI2 
and RRs for their associations with the cancers identi-
fied from published meta-analyses, we estimated the 
population attributable fraction (PAF) of incident cancers 
attributable to diabetes and high BMI. For 175 countries 
in 2012 (appendix p 10), we estimated individual PAFs for 
each risk factor, as well as two scenarios of diabetes and 
high BMI combined, one treating their effects as 
independent and another as overlapping. All analyses 
were stratified by sex and age group and restricted to 
people aged 18 years or older. We then estimated the 
number of cancer cases attributable to diabetes, high 
BMI, and their combined effect globally by multiplying 
the PAFs with the number of incident cancers for each 
age, sex, and country stratum using data from 
GLOBOCAN.18 
Given the cumulative nature of carcinogenesis, and 
the importance of risk factor exposure over time, a time 
lag of several years from exposure to the risk factor and 
development of the disease is expected. For the 
association between high BMI and cancer, this lag is 
commonly assumed to be about 10 years.19 Thus, in our 
main analysis we calculated cancer incidence in 2012 
that we attributed to diabetes and high BMI in 2002. We 
also estimated cancer incidence due to the change in the 
prevalence of these two risk factors from 1980 to 2002. 
Data sources
We obtained data on the prevalence of diabetes and 
categories of BMI for 1980 and 2002, stratified by age 
group (18–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 
50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, and 
≥85 years), sex, and country from estimates2,3 by the 
NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC). BMI data 
were summarised as prevalence of BMI categories 
(<18·5, 18·5 to <20, 20 to <25, 25 to <30, 30 to <35, 
35 to <40, and ≥40 kg/m²) to characterise the varying 
shape of the distribution across populations.2 Diabetes 
was defined as fasting plasma glucose greater than or 
equal to 7·0 mmol/L, a history of diagnosis of diabetes 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published up to 
June 30, 2017, with no language restrictions using the search 
terms (“Diabetes” OR “Body-mass index” OR “Overweight”, 
OR “Obesity”), AND (“Cancer risk”, OR “Cancer incidence”), 
AND “Attributable fraction”. We found one study estimating 
the burden of cancer associated with type 2 diabetes in 2010 
and 2030 in Japan and we found several studies estimating 
the burden of cancer attributable to high BMI or obesity 
alone, either in one country or in one country and one cancer 
site. One previous study quantified the global burden of 
cancer attributable to high BMI. New, more comprehensive 
estimates of BMI prevalence have since been published. No 
previous study has estimated the global burden of cancer 
attributable to diabetes alone or diabetes and high BMI 
combined.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study provides the first estimate of 
global cancer burden attributable to diabetes alone and to 
diabetes and high BMI combined, and uses the most 
comprehensive available estimates of diabetes and high BMI 
prevalence. We also quantified the global burden of cancer 
attributable to rises in the prevalence of diabetes and high BMI 
over time.
Implications of all the available evidence
In 2012, about 6% of all incident cancers were attributable to 
the combined effects of diabetes and high BMI, corresponding 
to 792 600 cases. As the prevalence of these cancer risk factors 
increases, clinical and public health efforts should focus on 
identifying optimal preventive and screening measures for 
whole populations and individual patients.

(we did not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 
diabetes), or use of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs. 
The data sources used by NCD-RisC to estimate BMI 
and diabetes were checked against a defined set of 
inclusion criteria, which have been described in detail 
previously,1,2 and data were reanalysed according to a 
common protocol. To avoid potential bias from self-
reported data, NCD-RisC only uses data from studies 
that had measured height and weight or a diabetes 
biomarker (fasting plasma glucose, 2 h oral glucose 
tolerance test, or HbA1c). The same criteria and protocol 
were applied to studies throughout time and across 
countries. After pooling the data, NCD-RisC fitted a 
bespoke Bayesian hierarchical model to the data with 
the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and generated 
1000 draws from the posterior distribution for each 
country-year-sex-age 
stratum. 
Details 
have 
been 
reported previously in studies investigating BMI and 
diabetes.2,3
GLOBOCAN 2012 cancer incidence data18 for the 
selected cancer sites were available in age groups (15–39, 
40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, and 
≥75 years). We used population weighting to ensure that 
the age groups for diabetes and BMI prevalence were the 
same as those for cancer incidence. The GLOBOCAN 
cancer incidence data covered 183 countries and 
territories, for which both diabetes and BMI estimates 
were available in 175 of them. We subsequently grouped 
these 175 countries into nine regions by geo 
graphical and 
national income criteria (appendix p 10). 
Statistical analysis
Most risk factors act proportionally to increase disease risk, 
therefore we first calculated the proportional reduction of 
cancer that would occur if exposure to the risk factor was 
reduced to an alternative scenario, as measured by the 
PAF.20 The PAF attributable to diabetes and high BMI 
separately was calculated using the formula21
where Pi is the actual prevalence of diabetes or BMI 
category i, P ʹi is the prevalence in an alternative scenario, 
and RRi the adjusted relative risk of site-specific cancer 
associated with diabetes or the corresponding level of 
BMI. In our main analysis we estimated the total cancer 
burden of diabetes and high BMI, and used an optimal 
prevalence as our alternative scenario—namely zero 
diabetes prevalence and BMI of 20–25 kg/m² (used as 
22·5 kg/m² in the calculation), where the cancer risk is 
assumed to be lowest at the population level. A diabetes 
prevalence of less than 1% has not been observed,22 so we 
did a further analysis in which the optimal prevalence of 
diabetes was 1% rather than zero. We calculated PAFs for 
2035 with prevalence in 2025 (projected on the 
assumption that recent trends continue, as described 
previously) instead of 2002 prevalence.2,3,23
Diabetes and high BMI have increased in prevalence 
substantially worldwide since 1980.2,3 We therefore used 
a second alternative scenario to estimate the cancer 
burden attributable to these increases. To do this, we 
replaced the optimal prevalence with the prevalence of 
diabetes and high BMI in 1980 as the alternative scenario. 
We then calculated the PAFs for the combined effects 
of diabetes and high BMI in two scenarios: diabetes and 
high BMI as independent risk factors, and a conser-
vative estimate. To calculate combined PAF with high 
BMI and diabetes as independent risk factors, we used the 
formula24 PAF = 
       1 – [(1 – PAFDiabetes) × (1 – PAFHigh BMI)]. For the 
conservative estimate, we selected the larger of PAFDiabetes 
and PAFHigh BMI in each age, sex, and country stratum to 
generate a con 
servative PAF. This approach assumes 
complete overlap of pathophysiology of diabetes and high 
BMI with cancer.
We calculated the number of incident cancer cases in 
2012 attributable to each risk factor individually and 
combined as the product of the corresponding PAF and 
the incident site-specific cancer cases. All analyses were 
done by sex, age group, and country stratum. To produce 
aggregated results across age groups, we weighted the 
age group-specific PAFs by age group-specific cancer 
incidence by sex and country. 
We propagated the uncertainties of diabetes and BMI 
prevalence estimates and those of the RRs to the final 
estimates using a simulation approach. Specifically, we 
generated 1000 draws for each RR from a log-normal 
distribution, with mean equal to the reported estimate and 
SD calculated with the reported confidence interval and 
1000 draws from the posterior distributions of diabetes3 
and high BMI prevalence.2 We repeated the PAF calculation

Results
In 2012, diabetes and high BMI combined were res-
ponsible for an estimated 792 600 new cases of cancer 
worldwide (5·6% of all 14 067 894 cancer cases re-
ported by GLOBOCAN18) in the independent scenario. 
280 100 (2·0%) cancer cases were attributable to diabetes 
and 544 300 (3·9%) to high BMI alone (figures 1, 2). In 
the conservative scenario, the two risk factors combined 
were responsible for 626 900 new cancer cases in 2012. 
Cancer cases attributable to diabetes and high BMI 
combined were almost twice as common in women 
(496 700 cases) as in men (295 900 cases) in the indepen-
dent scenario. 
In men, 126 700 cases (95% UI 95 900–159 400) were 
from liver cancer, constituting 42·8% of all cancer cases 
attributable to diabetes and high BMI combined in the 
independent scenario; colorectal cancer cases (63 200 cases, 
40 600–86 000) were the next largest contributor, consti-
tuting 21·4% of the total cases (figures 1, 2; table 1). In 
women, there were 147 400 cases (106 700–190 000) of 
breast cancer, constituting 29·7% of all cancers attributable 
to diabetes and high BMI; the second largest contributor 
was endometrial cancer (121 700 cases, 108 600–135 000), 
which constituted 24·5% of such cases.
Of the six cancers associated with diabetes and 
12 associated with high BMI, 15·0% in men and 
13·3% in women were attributable to the combined effect 
of these risk factors in the independent scenario (11·6% in 
men and 10·7% in women in the conservative scenario; 
table 1). The PAF varied substantially by cancer site in 
both sexes. Of all liver cancers, 23·3% (17·6–29·3) in men 
and 27·3% (20·9–33·9) in women were attributable to 
diabetes and high BMI combined, compared with just 
8·6% (5·5–11·7) of cases of colorectal cancer in men and 
9·7% (6·3–12·7) in women. 38·4% (34·3–42·6) of all 
endometrial cancer cases in 2012 were attributable to 
these risk factors compared with 3·9% (0·9–6·7) of 
ovarian cancer cases (table 1). 
There were notable differences in the proportion of 
cancer cases attributable to diabetes versus high BMI 
individually. For example, high BMI was responsible 
for about three times the proportion of breast (6·9%) and 
endometrial (31·0%) cancers as compared with diabetes 
(2·2% for breast and 10·8% for endometrial; table 1). 
By contrast, the proportion of liver (14·5%) and pan-
creatic (12·8%) cancer in men attributable to diabetes was 
substantially larger than that attributable to high BMI 
(10·1% for liver and 5·8% for pancreatic). When using 1% 
as the optimal diabetes prevalence rather than zero, this 
resulted in a reduction in cancer cases attributable to 
diabetes by 6·8% (261 000 vs 280 100). 
303 000 (38·2%) of 792 600 cases of cancer attributable 
to the combined risk of diabetes and high BMI in the 
independent scenario in 2012 occurred in high-income 
western countries (figures 1, 2). East and southeast Asia 
had the second largest proportion (190 900 [24·1%]) of 
cases attributable to the combined risk of diabetes and 
high BMI, and the largest number of cancer cases 
attributable to diabetes individually (105 500 attributable 
cases) (figure 2). 
The contribution of each cancer site to the regional 
cancer burden also varied substantially. Of the total

high BMI, liver cancer contributed more than 30·7% in 
the high-income Asia Pacific region and 53·8% in east 
and southeast Asia, compared with just 7·0% in central 
and eastern Europe (figure 2B). By contrast, breast and 
endometrial cancer contributed about 18·5% of the

There was substantial heterogeneity in the proportion 
of cancer cases attributable to diabetes, high BMI, 
and their combination in the independent scenario at 
country level. For example, less than 1% of all new cancer 
cases in Malawi (0·6%) and Tanzania (0·9%) in 2012

compared with more than 10% in Egypt (12·0%) and 
Mongolia (13·9%)—the countries with the largest PAF—
reflecting large variations in risk factor prevalence, and 
in the way that some cancers are more affected by these 
factors than others (figure 3).
We calculated that 26·1% of all cancer cases in 2012 
attributable to diabetes were due to the increase in diabetes 
prevalence from 1980 to 2002 (table 2), equating to 
77 000 new cases worldwide. 31·9% of cancer cases 
attributable to high BMI were due to increased prevalence 
of this risk factor over the same period, accounting for 
approximately 174 040 cancer cases. The largest pro 
portion 
of cancer cases attributable to the increase in prevalence of 
diabetes and high BMI during this period was in low-
income and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa. At the two extremes, just 7% of cancer 
cases attributable to diabetes were due to increased diabetes 
prevalence in women in central and eastern Europe, 
compared with 48% in men in south Asia. 
The PAF of cancer attributable to diabetes and high BMI 
is expected to increase substantially in coming decades 
(appendix p 5). For example, PAFs for most site-specific 
cancers would increase by more than 30% in women and 
20% in men when using projected 2025 prevalence 
compared with 2002 prevalence. In men, the PAF for liver 
cancer would increase by 47% (from 23·3% to 34·3%) and 
gallbladder cancer would increase by 53% (from 
16·7% to 25·5%), while in women, the PAF for ovarian 
cancer would increase by 38% (from 3·9% to 5·4%).
Discussion 
We estimated that approximately 6% of cancer cases 
worldwide in 2012 were attributable to diabetes and high 
BMI, with high BMI being responsible for almost twice 
as many cases as diabetes. About a third of cancer cases 
attributable to diabetes and a quarter of cases attributable 
to high BMI were due to increases in the prevalence of 
these risk factors from 1980 to 2002. Given the continued 
rise in the prevalence of these risk factors since 2002,2,3 
the attributable cancer burden is likely to continue to 
increase in coming decades. Approximately one in 
four liver and oesophageal adenocarcinomas and 
38·4% of endometrial cancers worldwide in 2012 were 
estimated to be attri 
butable to diabetes and high BMI. 
LMICs have had substantial increases in the prevalence 
of diabetes and high BMI during the past three decades, 
whereas parts of Europe and the high-income Asia 
Pacific region have seen more stable age-standardised 
prevalences (appendix p 7).2,3 In our analysis LMICs had 
the largest increases in numbers of cancer cases 
attributable both to diabetes, and diabetes and high BMI 
combined, which is particularly important to note 
because these countries are generally less well equipped 
to manage the burden of complex non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) than high-income countries.
Previous studies have quantified the global cancer 
burden attributable to nine potentially modifiable diet 
and lifestyle risk factors (PAF 35% in 2001),26 smoking 
(PAF 21% in 2000),27 high BMI (PAF 3·6% in 2012),15 
and common infections (PAF 15·4% in 2012).28 Our 
findings suggest that 3·9% of global cancer cases in 2012 
were attributable to high BMI, taking into account the 
four additional cancer sites and more compre 
hensive 
and up-to-date BMI data compared with previous work.15 
Proposed biological mechanisms underlying the link 
between diabetes, high BMI, and cancer include hyper-
insulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, chronic inflam 
mation,29 
and dysregulation of sex hormone activity. Insulin itself 
could be oncogenic,30 and results from several analyses 
showed that people with hyper 
insulinaemia were at 
increased risk of breast and colorectal cancer irrespective 
of their BMI.31–33 Prospective studies and large-scale 
consortia with more accurate assessments of adiposity, 
diabetes, and metabolic health, which incorporate mole-
cular tools, will be needed to draw conclusions about the 
underlying mechanisms that link diabetes, high BMI, 
and cancer, and inform clinical interventions. 
To our knowledge, this is the only study to have 
quantified the global burden of cancer attributable to 
diabetes and to diabetes combined with high BMI, by use 
of robust evidence from WCRF4–12,14 for BMI and high 
quality meta-analyses for diabetes.17 Our findings are 
important to policy makers developing coordinated 
approaches to tackle the rising prevalence of diabetes, 
high BMI, and all of their sequelae. The cancers judged 
to have a convincing association with diabetes by the 
umbrella meta-analysis were restricted to those for which 
the effect of study bias was expected to be lowest. 
Our study has some limitations. The precision of the 
risk estimates used to adjust for common confounders, 
including diabetes and BMI, might be affected by 
potential biases such as reverse causality and ascer-
tainment bias, which are believed to affect some estimates 
of the association between diabetes and cancer.34 We used 
the same relative risk for age group, sex, and region; more 
granular risk estimates by age, sex, and stage of diagnosis 
would allow for greater accuracy at the subgroup level. 
We quantified the cancer burden attributable to all BMI 
levels greater than 25 kg/m². Some researchers have 
argued that Asian populations might need BMI cutoffs 
that are different from other populations,35 although 
meta-analyses of Asian and western cohorts have shown 
that disease risk increases by similar proportions in Asian 
and western populations36–39 and indeed the latest WHO 
consensus statement on BMI cutoffs, having considered 
the argu 
ments for region-specific cutoffs, recommended 
use of similar cutoffs throughout the world.35 The 
mediated and direct effects of diabetes and high BMI on 
cancer—which would allow for more accurate estimation 
of their com 
bined contributions to the cancer burden—
have not yet been quantified in the way that has been 
done for cardiovascular diseases.40 Additionally, the 
10-year lag from diabetes and high BMI prevalence to 
cancer incidence that we used is an imperfect measure of

cumulative past risk factor exposure, which is important 
for cancer burden.41 Our PAF analysis quantified the 
proportion and number of cancer cases that would be 
averted if diabetes and high BMI prevalence were reduced 
to optimal levels. However, if the cancer burden of 
diabetes and high BMI is removed, these risks could lead 
to populations developing other disorders such as cardio-
vascular disease and chronic kidney disease as quanti 
fied 
elsewhere.42 Finally, we assumed an optimal diabetes 
prevalence of zero, and achieving a prevalence of less 
than 1% might not be feasible.22 Nonetheless, when we 
sub 
stituted zero for 1% as the optimal diabetes prevalence, 
the cancer burden attributable to diabetes changed by less 
than 7% and was still responsible for 261 000 cases. 
Trends in diabetes and those in BMI were only partly 
correlated across regions. . For example, in south Asia 
and possibly east Asia diabetes prevalence has risen 
faster than would be expected by changes in BMI levels, 
whereas in northern Europe diabetes prevalence is 
increasing at a slower rate than might be expected by the 
changes in BMI. Several factors might be causing these 
diverse trends. First, regional differences in the 
prevalence of diabetes might be due to differences in 
genetic suscepti 
bility or phenotypic variations arising 
from inadequate fetal and childhood nutrition and 
growth; earlier onset of β-cell dysfunction could be a 
differentiating characteristic of Asian populations 
compared with other groups.43–47 Second, people who are 
at high risk of developing diabetes might be identified at 
an earlier stage in health systems in high-income 
countries, allowing for earlier intervention with lifestyle 
and dietary modification or drugs.48 Finally, total caloric 
intake, dietary composition, and physical activity might 
affect diabetes risk and contribute to differences in 
regional trends to a greater extent than would otherwise 
be expected on the basis of BMI.49 
Our results suggest that the increases in diabetes and 
BMI worldwide could lead to a substantial increase in the 
cancer burden in future decades. For example, when we 
used 2025 projections for diabetes and BMI prevalence 
we found that a substantially larger share of cancers 
would be attributable to these risk factors in the future 
than in 2012. PAFs for all site-specific cancers would be 
significantly higher if trends in diabetes and BMI 
continue as projected, with the largest increases in 
gallbladder, liver, and endometrial cancers. These 
projections are particularly alarming in view of the high, 
and growing, economic cost of cancers and metabolic 
diseases, and highlight the importance of integrated 
control measures to tackle common modifiable risk 
factors, alongside clinician awareness of diabetes and 
high BMI as established risk factors for common cancers.
Population-based strategies to prevent diabetes and 
high BMI have great potential impact—not least because 
many NCDs have overlapping risk factors, comorbidities, 
and shared sequelae—but have so far often failed, largely 
because of reluctance by governments and policy makers 
to pursue structural interventions that tackle key risks for 
NCDs, such as diet and physical inactivity.1 Future efforts 
should focus on identifying the most effective clinical 
interventions to prevent development of NCDs in at-risk 
groups and their sequelae, such as cancer. Primary care 
interventions, such as glucose-modifying medications, 
can be effective in preventing diabetes complications 
such as macrovascular disease,50 but this approach relies 
on early identification and close monitoring of people 
with diabetes, which can be challenging in LMICs that 
have limited resources. As well as coordinated approaches 
to halt and reverse the rise in NCDs, global efforts and 
clinical guidance should reflect the importance of cancer 
as a sequela of both diabetes and high BMI, and NCD 
control measures should be integrated into clinical 
guide 
lines to identify opportunities to reduce morbidity 
in this group of patients.
