Background. A reported penicillin allergy may compromise receipt of recommended antibiotic prophylaxis intended to pre-
vent surgical site infections (SSIs). Most patients with a reported penicillin allergy are not allergic. We determined the impact of a 
reported penicillin allergy on the development of SSIs.
Methods. In this retrospective cohort study of Massachusetts General Hospital hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, hysterec-
tomy, colon surgery, and coronary artery bypass grafting patients from 2010 to 2014, we compared patients with and without a 
reported penicillin allergy. The primary outcome was an SSI, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National 
Healthcare Safety Network. The secondary outcome was perioperative antibiotic use.
Results. Of 8385 patients who underwent 9004 procedures, 922 (11%) reported a penicillin allergy, and 241 (2.7%) had an SSI. 
In multivariable logistic regression, patients reporting a penicillin allergy had increased odds (adjusted odds ratio, 1.51; 95% con-
fidence interval, 1.02–2.22) of SSI. Penicillin allergy reporters were administered less cefazolin (12% vs 92%; P < .001) and more 
clindamycin (49% vs 3%; P < .001), vancomycin (35% vs 3%; P < .001), and gentamicin (24% vs 3%; P < .001) compared with those 
without a reported penicillin allergy. The increased SSI risk was entirely mediated by the patients’ receipt of an alternative perioper-
ative antibiotic; between 112 and 124 patients with reported penicillin allergy would need allergy evaluation to prevent 1 SSI.
Conclusions. Patients with a reported penicillin allergy had a 50% increased odds of SSI, attributable to the receipt of sec-
ond-line perioperative antibiotics. Clarification of penicillin allergies as part of routine preoperative care may decrease SSI risk.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) account for 40% of all healthcare-as-
sociated infections among hospitalized patients [1]. Surgical site 
infections result in substantial morbidity and mortality [2] and 
an estimated attributable cost exceeding $25 000 (2017 US dol-
lars) per case [1, 3, 4]. Surgical site infections additionally influ-
ence perceptions of hospital quality; the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services Inpatient Prospective Payment System 
publicly reports SSIs through the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), with 
data made available to patients on Hospital Compare [1, 5]. For 
these reasons, reducing SSIs is a national healthcare priority [6–9].
Appropriate use of perioperative antibiotics can decrease the inci-
dence of SSIs [10–12]. For most surgical procedures, a beta-lactam 
antibiotic is the preferred perioperative antibiotic [13]. Cefazolin, 
a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, is often the recom-
mended drug due to its spectrum of coverage (ie, activity against 
common skin flora, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus 
aureus [MSSA] and Streptococcus species), bactericidal activity, 
and favorable pharmacokinetics whereby the drug rapidly reaches 
optimal antibacterial concentrations in tissues [13–15]. For the 10% 
of patients who report a prior penicillin allergy [16, 17], non–beta-
lactam antibiotics (eg, clindamycin, vancomycin) may be adminis-
tered [18–21]. This is despite evidence demonstrating that 90%–99% 
of patients with a reported penicillin allergy are not truly allergic (ie, 
there is no immediate hypersensitivity) and <3% of patients with an 
allergy to penicillin will also react to cefazolin [22–25].
A reported penicillin allergy has been associated with 
increased healthcare-associated infections, including 23% 
increased odds of Clostridium difficile, 14% increased odds of 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] coloniza-
tion or infection, and 30% increased odds of vancomycin-re-
sistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization or infection [26]. Few 
studies have assessed risk of SSIs in patients reporting drug 
allergies [27–29]. Our objective was to assess SSI risk among 
surgical patients reporting a penicillin allergy.

hysterectomy (HYST), colon surgery (COLO), or coronary 
artery bypass grafting (CABG) from 2010 through 2014 at the 
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). All data were identified 
electronically from the Enterprise Data Warehouse, a comprehen-
sive electronic health record database for Partners HealthCare 
System [30]. We additionally used MGH procedure and SSI data, 
which were collected, compiled, and reported to NHSN by the 
MGH Infection Control Unit in accordance with NHSN guidance.
Exposure
The exposure was a reported penicillin allergy, defined as a his-
torically documented allergy to any penicillin antibiotic at the 
time of surgery, regardless of stated reaction (ie, hypersensitiv-
ities, side effects, and intolerances were all included). Allergies 
included both those reactions that were clinician-observed and 
those self-reported by patients. For patients who underwent 
multiple surgical procedures, we used penicillin allergy status at 
the time of their first procedure.
Reactions to penicillin antibiotics were identified using both 
coded and free-text reaction data, and categorized as (1) an aller-
gic or hypersensitivity reaction; (2) a side effect, intolerance, or 
toxicity; or (3) an unknown reaction. We identified reactions 
representing contraindications to receiving beta-lactam anti-
biotics and those that would have been amenable to standard 
penicillin allergy evaluation methods (ie, penicillin skin testing 
and/or test dose challenge procedures) [31].
Outcomes
The primary outcome was SSI, as defined and reported to NHSN 
for each procedure, including all SSI types: superficial, deep, 
and organ space. At MGH, SSIs are determined through pro-
spective surveillance by 8 infection control practitioners, regis-
tered nurses certified in infection prevention and control with 
9–30 years of experience. Surgical site infections were identified 
through chart review of 100% of procedures and application of 
standardized NHSN definitions at the time of reporting [32].
The secondary outcome was perioperative antibiotic use, 
defined as antibiotics administered from 120 minutes prior to sur-
gery until the end of surgery. Given the importance of antibiotic 
timing to development of SSI [13], we additionally assessed a pre-
operative antibiotic timing window, with initiation of antibiotics 
from 120 minutes prior to surgery until the time of incision, and 
separately assessed a stringent timing window for vancomycin 
(initiation of antibiotics 60–120 minutes prior to incision), given 
its pharmacokinetics and guideline recommendation for earlier 
administration [13]. During the study period, there were institu-
tional guidelines for periprocedural antimicrobial prophylaxis with 
recommendations for agent choice and administration timing.
Covariates and Confounders
Age, sex, and race were identified from patient demographic 
tables. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from height and 
weight assessments during the study period. American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) class was identified from the preopera-
tive anesthesiology visit and documented according to established 
guidelines [33]. Medical comorbidities (ie, diabetes, cardiovas-
cular disease, malignancy, asthma, chronic renal impairment) 
were identified using codes from the International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Edition billed during the surgical procedure 
or subsequent hospitalization; chosen codes were informed by 
prior studies, when available [34–37]. Resistant organism colon-
ization was identified using electronic health record “flags” for 
patients with MRSA and VRE. Cephalosporin allergy, vancomy-
cin allergy, and number of other allergies were identified from the 
allergy record in the Enterprise Data Warehouse.
Surgery type was specified as HPRO, KPRO, HYST, COLO, or 
CABG and identified as per NHSN criteria [38]. Hip arthroplasty 
included all surgical procedures involving the partial or total place-
ment or replacement of a hip prosthesis; KPRO included all surgical 
procedures involving partial or total placement or replacement of 
a knee prosthesis; HYST included all abdominal and vaginal hys-
terectomies, including those performed by laparoscope; COLO 
included all incisions, resections, or anastomosis of the large intes-
tine, including large-to-small and small-to-large bowel anastomo-
ses; and CABG included all coronary artery bypass grafts with chest 
or chest and donor incisions to perform direct revascularization of 
the heart or internal thoracic artery [32, 38]. Emergency procedures, 
those related to trauma, wound class, and procedure duration (min-
utes) were identified from prospectively collected data reported to 
NHSN. Length of hospital stay (days) was calculated by subtracting 
the discharge date/time from the admission date/time.
Statistical Analysis
We compared patient and procedure characteristics in patients 
with and without a reported penicillin allergy using Wilcoxon 
rank sum test for continuous variables and χ2 test or Fisher’s 
exact test, as appropriate, for binary variables. To determine the 
adjusted impact of the reported penicillin allergy on SSIs for 
patients’ demographic, clinical, and surgery characteristics, we 
built a multivariable logistics model. We first selected important 
covariates by using both a priori knowledge and a univariate test 
with P < .10 as the criteria for model entry. We forced the varia-
bles included in NSHN risk stratification (ASA score, procedure 
duration, and wound class) into the model [14, 39]. We added 
additional candidate variables one at a time, and assessed their 
impact on the model through change in the quasi-likelihood 
under the independence model criterion goodness of fit and the 
P value of the model parameter. Given the low SSI event rate and 
concern for model overfitting, we removed candidate variables 
from the model with P > .05 and those that were collinear with 
other variables in the model (eg, cardiovascular disease and BMI 
are considered in the ASA score [33]). When precedent existed, 
we reduced the class-level sizes of the categorical variables into 
fewer numbers (eg, grouping ASA scores of IV and V together)

[40, 41]. The model estimation was performed using generalized 
estimating equations to consider the intrapatient clustered out-
comes that arose from repeated surgical procedures. We reported 
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
The final multivariable model was used for a mediation ana-
lysis to determine whether the association between penicillin 
allergy and SSI was mediated by perioperative antibiotic use. We 
grouped antibiotics into beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactam 
alternative antibiotics and assessed receipt of only alternative anti-
biotics as the potential mediator. We used a marginal structural 
model to assess the amount of mediation, or indirect effect, while 
controlling for confounders in the multivariable model [42].
The final multivariable logistic model was used to calculate 
the expected number of patients who would require allergy 
evaluation, or number needed to evaluate (NNE), to prevent 1 
SSI. In this calculation, we used prior knowledge that patients 
reporting penicillin allergy are not truly penicillin allergic, with 
the plausible range of 90%–100%, and assumed that without a 
reported penicillin allergy, patients would be administered a 
first-line beta-lactam antibiotic [43–45].
We used SAS version 9.4 for all analyses, and a 2-sided P 
value of < .05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Cohort Characteristics
The cohort included 8385 patients who underwent 9004 proce-
dures: 2624 HPRO, 2439 KPRO, 1560 HYST, 1250 COLO, and 
1131 CABG (Figure 1).
Nine hundred twenty-two patients (11.0%) reported a penicil-
lin allergy. There were 1042 reactions documented to penicillin 
among the 922 patients (Table 1). Most reactions were possibly 
allergic, or hypersensitivity, reactions (n = 718, 68.9%), with rash 
(n = 346, 37.5%), urticaria (n = 166, 18.0%), and angioedema 
(n = 82, 8.9%) most common. There were 89 reactions (8.5%) that 
were side effects or toxicities, most commonly gastrointestinal 
symptoms (n = 51, 5.5%); 235 (25.5%) had unknown reactions. 
There were 5 hypersensitivity reactions (acute interstitial nephri-
tis: n = 2; blister: n = 2; and Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic 
epidermal necrolysis: n = 1) that possibly represented true con-
traindications to receiving beta-lactam class antibiotics. There 
were 953 reactions (92.0%; 718 hypersensitivity and 235 unknown 
reactions) amenable to traditional penicillin allergy evaluation 
methods of skin testing and/or drug challenges (Table 1).
Patients reporting penicillin allergy were older (65 y vs 64 y; 
P = .03) and more likely to be female (72.0% vs 56.8%; P < .001 
(Table 2). Race was imbalanced between allergy groups, with 
penicillin allergy reporters more likely to be white (87.9% vs 
84.7%; P = .02). Body mass index (P = .15) and ASA scores 
(P = .06) were slightly imbalanced between allergy groups; 
comorbidities were balanced between penicillin allergy groups, 
except cardiovascular disease, which was less common in 
patients reporting penicillin allergy (19.0% vs 23.4%; P = .003), 
and asthma, which was more common in patients with a pen-
icillin allergy (12.4% vs 9.4%; P = .004). Vancomycin-resistant 
Enterococcus colonization was uncommon (n = 85), but patients 
reporting penicillin allergy had a higher frequncy of VRE col-
onization or infection history (1.7% vs 0.9%; P = .02). Patients 
with penicillin allergy histories had more cephalosporin allergy, 
vancomycin allergy, and more allergies overall (P < .001).
Surgery type was imbalanced between allergy groups 
(P < .001), with patients reporting penicillin allergy less likely 
to have had CABG and COLO and more likely to have had 
HYST. Although emergency surgical procedures were gener-
ally similar between penicillin allergy groups (P = .41), trauma 
was more frequent in the patients reporting penicillin allergy 
(4.2% vs 3.0%; P = .04). Wound class was imbalanced between 
penicillin allergy groups (P = .01), with patients reporting pen-
icillin allergy less frequently having a clean wound and more 
frequently having clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty 
wounds. Procedure duration was relatively similar between 
penicillin allergy groups (P = .24), and hospital length of stay

was slightly shorter for patients reporting penicillin allergy, 
with a median of 3 days (interquartile range [IQR], 2–5 d) com-
pared with those without (median, 3 d; IQR, 2–6 d; P = .01).
Primary Outcome: Surgical Site Infections
Among 9004 procedures, there were 241 SSIs (2.7%): 126 SSIs 
for COLO (10.1%), 35 SSIs for HYST (2.2%), 31 SSIs for HPRO 
(1.2%), 26 SSIs for KPRO(1.1%), and 23 SSIs for CABG (2.0%) 
(Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1). In the univariable ana-
lysis, patients who reported a penicillin allergy history more 
frequently had an SSI (3.5% vs 2.6%; P = .10). In the multi-
variable logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, race, 
surgery type, ASA class, procedure duration, and wound class, 
a reported penicillin allergy was associated with increased odds 
of SSI (adjusted OR [aOR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02–2.22) (Table 3).
In the multivariable marginal structural model, the effect of 
penicillin allergy reporting on SSI development was entirely 
mediated through receipt of a beta-lactam alternative antibiotic. 
Although the indirect effect of reported penicillin allergy on SSI 
through perioperative antibiotic choice demonstrated signifi-
cantly increased odds of SSI for penicillin allergy reporters (aOR, 
2.05; 95% CI, 1.40–3.00), the direct effect of a reported penicillin 
allergy on SSI was not significant (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, .36–2.78).
Secondary Outcome: Perioperative Antibiotic Choice and Timing
Overall, the most commonly used perioperative antibiotics were 
cefazolin (n = 7534, 83.7%), metronidazole (n = 1083, 12.0%), 
clindamycin (n = 722, 8.0%), and vancomycin (n = 601, 6.7%). 
Patients with a reported penicillin allergy were significantly less 
likely to receive cefazolin (12.2% vs 92.4%; P < .001) and more 
likely to receive clindamycin (48.8% vs 3.1%; P < .001), vancomy-
cin (34.7% vs 3.3%; P < .001), gentamicin (24.0% vs 2.8%; P < .001), 
and fluoroquinolones (6.8% vs 1.3%; P < .001) (Figure 2).
When restricting antibiotics to preoperative timing (ie, initi-
ation from 120 minutes prior to incision until surgical incision), 
similar differences in antibiotic choice were observed, although 
209 patients (2.3%) received the antibiotic outside of the timing 
window (Supplementary Table 2). Among procedures that did 
not use both a beta-lactam antibiotic and beta-lactam alterna-
tive antibiotic during surgery (n = 7893), beta-lactam antibi-
otics were more commonly initiated in the preoperative time 
window (98.2% vs 96.0%; P < .001).
Among patients receiving cefazolin or vancomycin 
(n = 8085), 97.5% did not receive vancomycin in the guide-
line-recommended time frame for administration (ie, 60–120 
minutes before incision), whereas only 1.7% of patients did not 
receive cefazolin in the recommended time-frame (P < .001). 
Vancomycin initiation occurred a median of 24.0 minutes (IQR, 
13.0–35.0 min) prior to incision.
Number Needed to Evaluate 
Between 112 and 124 patients with reported penicillin allergy 
would need allergy evaluation to prevent 1 SSI.
DISCUSSSION
In this retrospective cohort study of more than 8000 patients 
and 9000 procedures, including hip and knee arthroplasty, 
hysterectomy, colon surgery, and coronary artery bypass graft-
ing, patients who reported a prior penicillin allergy had a 50% 
increased odds of developing a SSI, using established definitions 
from NHSN and after controlling for important confounders. 
The differential SSI risk was attributable to receipt of alternative 
antimicrobial prophylaxis in the patient population reporting 
a prior history of penicillin allergy. Most patients had reported 
penicillin reactions eligible for standard allergy evaluation pro-
cedures that can distinguish true penicillin allergies and iden-
tify >95% of them as false. Based on published incidence of 
true penicillin allergy in this population, between 112 and 124 
patients would need penicillin allergy evaluation to avert 1 SSI.
Although prior studies suggested that a penicillin allergy may 
be associated with increased infection risk generally, previous 
reports have not used NHSN SSI criteria and have focused on a 
specific surgical procedure (eg, head and neck free tissue transfer 
[27], infections after dental implants [29]) or infection type (eg, 
septic arthritis after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate liga-
ment) [28]. The 50% increased odds of SSI among patients report-
ing a penicillin allergy in this cohort was entirely due to the use of 
beta-lactam alternative perioperative antibiotics [46] because the 
association between a reported penicillin allergy and SSI was an

indirect effect in the marginal structural model. This implies that 
the increased SSI risk is potentially modifiable if patients with a 
reported penicillin allergy could receive first-line beta-lactam anti-
biotic prophylaxis after a negative penicillin allergy evaluation [12].
Although approximately 85% of procedures used the first-line 
recommended antibiotic cefazolin, patients reporting a pen-
icillin allergy rarely received cefazolin and instead were 8–16 
times more likely than those without a penicillin allergy his-
tory to receive clindamycin, vancomycin, or gentamicin. Prior 
studies reported similar patterns of antibiotic prophylaxis use 
among those with a reported penicillin allergy [18–21]. Patients 
with reported penicillin allergy in this study were not only less 
likely to receive the most effective perioperative antibiotic, 
they were also less likely to receive prophylaxis in the recom-
mended time-frame for optimal tissue concentration, especially 
when vancomycin was the alternative antibiotic administered. 
Administration of beta-lactam alternative antibiotics, even 
perioperatively, increases risk of antibiotic adverse effects, such 
as Clostridium difficile colitis from clindamycin [47–50] or 
nephrotoxicity from vancomycin or gentamicin [51].
Current antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines delineate rec-
ommended agent(s) and alternative agents for patients with 
immunoglobulin E–mediated penicillin allergy [13]. Although 
this guideline encourages taking an allergy history, no guid-
ance on methods to clarify allergies or risk stratify patients is 
provided [13]. With limited direction and comfort with drug 
allergy assessment [52–54], providers understandably choose 
alternative agents for patients with prior reported penicillin 
allergy [25]. From the penicillin reaction histories in this study, 
all but 5 patients should have been able to either tolerate cefazo-
lin directly (eg, the patients with nonimmunologic reactions or 
mild, nonspecific immunologic reactions) or would be eligible 
for outpatient penicillin allergy evaluation by an allergist/immu-
nologist (ie, penicillin skin testing and/or test dose challenges) 
prior to surgery [55, 56]. Approaches to preoperative patients 
with reported penicillin allergy histories have been well docu-
mented and include outpatient specialist consultations and skin 
testing at preoperative visits [43]. Alternative approaches may 
include implementation of perioperative test dose challenges 
to cefazolin for patients with mild and/or remote penicillin 
allergy histories, an approach successfully used among hospi-
talized [57, 58] and ambulatory [59, 60] patients. Assuming all 
patients without true penicillin allergy would receive first-line

 Penicillin Allergy and SSIs • CID 2018:66 (1 February) • 335
perioperative prophylaxis, only 112–124 patients would need 
an allergy assessment to prevent 1 SSI.
This analysis, although limited by its retrospective design, 
used prospectively collected data (eg, procedure data, SSI) 
and manually validated data (eg, penicillin allergy) for key 
variables. Although the process for determining an SSI is not 
standard across institutions [61–67], differential surveillance 
methodologies would not be related to the exposure (pen-
icillin allergy) and would therefore not affect our conclu-
sions. Because SSIs occurred in only 241 patients, we could 
not account for all possible confounders in the relationship 
between penicillin allergy and SSI simultaneously. However, 
we were able to adjust for the most important confounders 
or a variable collinear with an important confounder. Further, 
the small number of SSIs left us underpowered to perform 
subgroup analyses by surgical procedure. Finally, these data 
represent the experience of 1 academic medical center, whose 
patients, providers, and practices may differ from those of 
other institutions. However, given the breadth of surgical dis-
ciplines included in this study and standardized implemen-
tation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention NHSN 
criteria, these findings are likely generalizable to many other 
US and international hospitals. Further, given that a penicillin 
allergy label conferred a 50% increased risk of SSI at a hospital 
with low SSI prevalence, rigorous infection control and pre-
vention, and ready access to allergy specialists, the problem is 
likely to be greater in other settings.
CONCLUSIONS
We identified that patients with a reported penicillin allergy 
are at 50% increased odds of developing SSI and that this 
increased risk is attributable to the inferior antibiotic proph-
ylaxis such patients receive in terms of drug choice and/or 
administration time. Only 5 reactions to penicillin represented 
contraindications to receiving a beta-lactam; the vast major-
ity of patients would have tolerated first-line recommended 
cephalosporin prophylaxis had allergy evaluation been pur-
sued. Systematic, preoperative penicillin allergy evaluations in 
surgical patients may not only improve antibiotic choice but 
also decrease SSI risk.
