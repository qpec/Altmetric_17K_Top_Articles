BACKGROUND: Cannabis is purported to alleviate symptoms related to cancer treatment, although the patterns of use among cancer
patients are not well known. This study was designed to determine the prevalence and methods of use among cancer patients, the
perceived benefits, and the sources of information in a state with legalized cannabis. METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymous survey
of adult cancer patients was performed at a National Cancer Institute–designated cancer center in Washington State. Random urine
samples for tetrahydrocannabinol provided survey validation. RESULTS: Nine hundred twenty-six of 2737 eligible patients (34%) com-
pleted the survey, and the median age was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46-66 years). Most had a strong interest in learning
about cannabis during treatment (6 on a 1-10 scale; IQR, 3-10) and wanted information from cancer providers (677 of 911 [74%]). Pre-
vious use was common (607 of 926 [66%]); 24% (222 of 926) used cannabis in the last year, and 21% (192 of 926) used cannabis in
the last month. Random urine samples found similar percentages of users who reported weekly use (27 of 193 [14%] vs 164 of 926
[18%]). Active users inhaled (153 of 220 [70%]) or consumed edibles (154 of 220 [70%]); 89 (40%) used both modalities. Cannabis
was used primarily for physical (165 of 219 [75%]) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (139 of 219 [63%]). Legalization significantly
increased the likelihood of use in more than half of the respondents. CONCLUSIONS: This study of cancer patients in a state with
legalized cannabis found high rates of active use across broad subgroups, and legalization was reported to be important in patients’
decision to use. Cancer patients desire but are not receiving information about cannabis use during their treatment from oncology
providers. Cancer 2017;123:4488-97. V

INTRODUCTION
Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug in the United States.1-3 In the 2014-2015 National Survey on Drug
Use and Health, 8.3% of those who were 12 years old or older had used cannabis in the past month.2 Of adult active
users, 9.8% reported use for medical reasons.4 A number of states have passed regulations that allow medicinal and/or
recreational cannabis use, and this has increased local access and availability.4 In Washington State, cannabis was legal-
ized for medicinal use in 1998 and for recreational use in November 2012; cannabis became commercially available in
Washington in July 2014.
Cannabis has been purported to provide benefits for cancer patients, most frequently by alleviating anorexia, nau-
sea, and pain.5 Positive impacts on mood and insomnia have been suggested as additional benefits.6 Research evaluating
cannabis as therapy is limited,7,8 and because of federal regulations, most studies have examined synthetic tetrahydro-
cannabinol (THC) analogues.9-11 THC may help to relieve pain12 and spasticity among targeted populations,13 but
data evaluating other therapeutic aspects of cannabis are insufficient.5,7,14,15 With insufficient data demonstrating the
benefits for cancer patients, small studies and clinical observations have also raised concerns about the safety of cannabis

 use in immunosuppressed populations.16-19 Currently,
most available data on the medical uses of cannabis for
cancer-related symptom management come from nonsci-
entific observations assembled from Web sites, lay press,
and community interactions rather than rigorous scien-
tific research.7
Increasing interest and shifting political attitudes on
cannabis, coupled with a lack of knowledge of the risks
and benefits in cancer care, indicate a need to understand
current use patterns and to develop accurate and informa-
tive education for both cancer patients and their providers.
The primary aim of this study was to better understand the
extent and patterns of cannabis use among cancer patients
in a state with legalized medical and recreational cannabis.
We administered an anonymous survey to a representative
cohort of ambulatory patients at a large National Cancer
Institute–designated comprehensive cancer center in the
Pacific Northwest specifically to determine the prevalence
of cannabis use within a range of cancer patients. Further-
more, among active users, we assessed the methods of use,
the context of their current use with medical treatment, the
current reasons for use, the perceived impact of the legali-
zation of recreational cannabis on current use, and patients’
sources of information about cannabis use in cancer. Ran-
dom urine samples tested for THC were used as a method
of validation for survey prevalence data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting
We conducted a cross-sectional survey of cancer patients
at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance over a 6-week period
between 2015 and 2016. The Seattle Cancer Care Alli-
ance is the ambulatory center for a cancer consortium that
includes the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s
Hospital; it serves patients from Alaska, Idaho, Montana,
Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming as well as those
referred to the center for hematopoietic cell transplanta-
tion and other research protocols. The facility includes
clinical laboratories, clinics, radiology and procedure
suites, and an infusion center; providers see approximately
75,000 outpatients yearly.
Participants
Patients presenting to the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance dur-
ing the study period were eligible for the survey. To ensure
a broad selection, surveys were offered in 3 clinical areas:
radiology/special procedures, general oncology, and infu-
sion units. Patients were eligible for the study and were
given the opportunity to participate if they 1) were 18 years
old or older, 2) were English-speaking, and 3) had not pre-
viously completed the survey at a prior appointment.
Survey Development
A 44-item questionnaire was developed to address canna-
bis use among cancer patients. These survey items were
constructed to address key research questions on cannabis
beliefs and health perceptions. An initial draft was
informed by a literature review, consultations with clinical
staff and patients, and study investigator experience. Inde-
pendent clinical staff then assessed and modified the ini-
tial draft through one-on-one discussions and an e-mail
review with investigators. Health care providers, nutri-
tionists, specialists in patient education, and the local pub-
lic health department provided feedback on the survey’s
content and format. A draft was then presented to a care-
giver and patient committee, and this allowed feedback
on the survey’s methods and validity; after additional
modifications, this committee approved the final survey.
The final survey had an introductory page describing the
study goals, the anonymous nature of responses, and the
estimated time for completion. The survey covered demo-
graphic and clinical information as well as issues concern-
ing cannabis use (see online supporting information).
Study Procedures
Eligible patients were approached on arrival by trained
front-desk staff. Interested patients were given the paper
survey and a prelabeled/self-sealing privacy envelope.
Completed surveys were returned directly to front-desk
staff in sealed envelopes and were picked up by the
research team weekly or were sent by patients through
campus/standard mail to the research team. Staff docu-
mented refusals during the first period of the survey distri-
bution (radiology/procedures). In the other 2 areas, the
denominator of eligible patients was determined from the
total number of appointments/arrivals during the period
of the survey distribution. An opt-out check box was also
available; opt-outs and surveys that were returned unan-
swered were considered refusals. All anonymized survey
responses were entered into Research Electronic Data
Capture (RedCap, Nashville, Tennessee)20 and were
double-entered for accuracy.
Urine samples
In the first survey period, random leftover clinical urine
samples (�1 mL) from the center’s laboratory were proc-
essed for THC. All urine samples were stored anony-
mously onsite in refrigerators and were then processed in
bulk with the enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique;

 samples with detected THC concentrations � 50 ng/mL
were considered positive. Samples with detectable levels <
50 ng/mL were sent for confirmatory testing using gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (Mayo Clinical Ref-
erence Laboratory), which assessed them for D-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid. Those with samples
insufficient for retesting or below the limit of detection
(<3 ng/mL) were considered negative.
The survey, the methods for distribution, and all
other study-related procedures were approved by the insti-
tutional review board of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center.
Measures
Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, education
level, and residential distance from the cancer center,
whereas the cancer status included various indicators of
the current diagnosis and treatment status. Cannabis use
was assessed with multiple variables, including any life-
time use, details of the frequency and recency of use,
methods of use (including inhalation, edibles, or both),
reasons for stopping, and the impact of legalization on
use. In addition, we assessed where patients acquired
information on cannabis and where they preferred to get
this information. Respondents were characterized as self-
identified active users (those patients who self-reported
cannabis use within the last year), prior users (those
patients who reported cannabis at any point in their life
but not within the past year), and never users (those
patients who reported no history of cannabis use). Those
who used cannabis 1 or more times a day were considered
heavy users, those who used cannabis less than once a day
but 1 or more times a week were considered moderate
users, and those who used cannabis less than once per
week were considered light users. Nine self-reported rea-
sons for using cannabis were assessed with a check-all-
that-apply question and, for analyses, were stratified into
physical symptoms (for pain, for nausea/upset stomach,
and to improve appetite), neuropsychiatric symptoms (for
depression/to improve mood, to help cope with illness, to
help deal with stress, and to sleep), recreational use/enjoy-
ment, and treatment of cancer.
Statistical Methods
Survey responses and data comparisons are summarized as
frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and
as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous
variables. Statistical comparisons were performed with the
chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test (categorical variables),
a 2-sample t test (continuous variable vs 2-category
variable), or a 1-way analysis of variance (continuous vari-
able vs 3-category variable). Because some questions
allowed multiple responses, the sum was larger than the
total sample of respondents; therefore, percentages repre-
sent the percentages of responses per the number of partic-
ipants. To compare Likert scales, values were combined
into low (1-3), medium (4-7), and high categories (8-10).
Analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS, Cary, North
Carolina). A significance level of .05 (2-sided) was used
for all analyses.
RESULTS
Demographics of the Survey Respondents
Out of a maximum of 2737 possible participants, 926
(34%) completed the survey (Fig. 1). Of those completing
the survey, the median age was 58 years (IQR, 46-66
years), and the majority were men (Table 1). More than
half reported having at least a college degree, and most
lived locally (median from the center, 25 miles; IQR, 10-
60 miles); the reported distances were consistent with the
Figure 1. Schema of the survey respondents. Survey period 1
includes patients given the survey in the radiology/procedure
suite waiting room (September 21 to October 9, 2015). During
this period, surveyors recorded all refusals. Survey period 2
includes patients given the survey in the general oncology
(January 11-25, 2016) and infusion waiting rooms (January 4-
20, 2016). During this period, refusals were estimated on the
basis of the number of unique patients seen in this area dur-
ing the survey time period. *Anonymous leftover urine sam-
ples were collected during survey period 1. Declined indicates
patients who declined to take the survey at the front desk,
whereas opt out indicates patients who took the survey but
returned the survey unanswered or after they had checked
the opt-out box on the first page of the survey.

 center’s national catchment area (Supporting Fig. 1 [see
online supporting information]). The largest group of
respondents had an underlying solid tumor malignancy,
and the majority were receiving active cancer treatment at
the time of the survey’s completion (Table 1). When we
compared the 2 study periods, differences in sex, the type
of cancer, and the treatment status were noted (Support-
ing Table 1 [see online supporting information]).
Current and Past Cannabis Use
Sixty-six percent of the respondents (607 of 926) had
used cannabis at some point in their life, and 24% (222
of 926) considered themselves active cannabis users (Sup-
porting Fig. 2 [see online supporting information]).
Active users were younger, had less education, and were
less likely to be hematopoietic cell transplant recipients
in comparison with prior and never users (Table 2); the
underlying type of cancer did not affect use. There were
no differences in cannabis use among respondents in the
2 study periods (Supporting Table 1 [see online support-
ing information]).
Most active users had used cannabis before their can-
cer diagnosis (147 [67%]). Of those who quit, most did
so before their diagnosis (266 of 326 [82%]), and they
were older (median, 59 years; IQR, 50-66 years) than
those who quit after their diagnosis (median, 48 years;
IQR, 34-58 years; P < .0001). Most who quit after their
diagnosis (32 of 57 [56%]) were undergoing active treat-
ment for a solid tumor malignancy; a small number quit
on the basis of a recommendation from their cancer or
primary care physician (8 of 51 [16%] and 2 of 51 [4%],
respectively). The majority of the active users had told
their cancer team about their use (138 of 221 [62%]).
Frequency and Methods of Cannabis Use
Of the 222 active cannabis users, 164 (74%) reported
using cannabis at least once a week (moderate use), and
124 (56%) used cannabis at least daily (heavy use); 68
(31%) used cannabis multiple times a day. Among the 193
leftover urine samples selected from the ambulatory labora-
tory for THC testing, 27 (14%) were positive (23 by the
enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique and 4 by gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry), and this was consis-
tent with the number of survey respondents who reported
at least moderate (weekly) use (164 of 926 [18%]).
A similar number of active users smoked (153 of
220 [70%]) or used edibles (154 [70%]), although dual
use was also common (89 [40%]; Fig. 2). Pipes were the
most common method of inhalation, and they were fol-
lowed by vaporizers and rolled cigarettes; the most

 frequent forms of edibles were store-bought candy/other
edibles, butters/oils, and homemade baked goods.
Reasons for Marijuana Use Among Active Users
Active users reported using cannabis most frequently for
pain, which was followed by nausea/upset stomach and
stress (Fig. 3). Seventy-six of 219 patients (35%) reported
using cannabis for enjoyment/recreational use, but only
16 of these patients (7.3%) used cannabis for this reason
exclusively. Use for neuropsychiatric reasons (139 of 219
[63%]) was nearly as common as use for physical symp-
toms (165 of 219 [75%]; Fig. 3). More than one-quarter
of active users (58 of 219 [26%]) believed that cannabis
was helping to treat their cancer, and 10 (5%) indicated
that this was their only reason for use. Regardless of symp-
toms, 106 of 206 (51%) felt that cannabis was a major
benefit (score on a Likert scale, 8-10), and 80 (39%) felt
that it was a moderate benefit (score, 4-7).
In comparison with prior and never users, active
users reported that they were more likely to use cannabis

 because of its legalization (P < .001; scale, 1 [no change]
to 10 [much more likely]): the median value was 8 for
active users (IQR, 1-10), 4 for prior users (IQR, 1-8), and
1 for never users (IQR, 1-6). Among active and prior
users, women were more likely to use because of legaliza-
tion in comparison with men (P 5 .002; Supporting
Table 1 [see online supporting information]).
Knowledge and Sources of Information
The majority of the respondents wanted to learn more
about cannabis and cancer (6 on a 1-10 scale; IQR, 3-10)
but the level of interest varied with age (P < .01; Fig. 4A).
Although nearly all respondents preferred to get informa-
tion from their cancer team, (677/911 [74%]) less than
15% received information from their cancer physician or
nurse (Fig. 4B). Most received information from friends/
family, newspaper/magazine articles, Web sites/blogs, or
another cancer patient; more than one-third reported that
they had not received any information. Only 73 of the
926 patients completing the survey (8%) did not want to
receive more information.
DISCUSSION
This survey-based study of cancer patients at a large com-
prehensive cancer center within a state with medically and
recreationally legalized cannabis found that nearly a quar-
ter of patients reported active use. More than half of active
users reported that legalization significantly increased
their likelihood of using, and cannabis use was spread
across demographic subsets, including age, sex, and cancer
diagnosis subsets. Respondents reported using a diverse
mix of cannabis products, which were evenly divided
between inhaled and edible modalities. Cannabis was
used commonly for the relief of physical symptoms, but
use for neuropsychiatric symptoms was nearly as frequent.
Even among never users, the respondents indicated sub-
stantial interest in learning more about the role of canna-
bis in cancer care. Despite nearly all respondents wanting
more information/education directly from their hematol-
ogy/oncology providers, most reported that they were
more likely to get information from sources outside the
health care system.

 Self-reported cannabis use among respondents in our
study was 24% within the last year and 21% within the last
month. These levels are more than double those reported in
national prevalence studies, where rates vary between 1.8%
and 8.3% over 1 month and between 2.8% and 12.9%
over 1 year.2-4,21-25 The younger demographic drives rates
in most large studies, in which nearly 20% of 18- to 25-
year-olds are reported to use cannabis.2 In contrast, those
under the age of 30 years made up only 6% of our total
respondents but had rates of active use of nearly 40%.
Studies specifically targeting older adults (�50
years), which are more consistent with our cohort’s
median age, have described cannabis use rates of 1.8% per
month and 2.8% to 4.8% per year.23,26 Older adults at
our cancer center were much more likely to use cannabis,
with rates anywhere from 4 to 14 times those reported for
the general population. The frequency of THC detection
in anonymized leftover urine samples appeared to corrob-
orate survey data for patients who reported a weekly use.
Comparing our results with the results for other can-
cer populations is difficult because of the limited number
of studies. An Australian study evaluating cannabis use
among patients with advanced cancer and/or a poor appe-
tite at cancer and palliative care clinics found that 26 of
204 patients (13%) had previously used medical canna-
bis.27 A study from Israel, where medical cannabis is legal,
estimated that only 1.7% of 17,000 cancer patients had
acquired a permit for medical marijuana.28 Among

Interest in learning about cannabis during cancer therapy stratified by age (*P � .05, **P < .01, and ***P < .001). In the low-
interest group, comparisons were made between ages < 30 years and other age strata. In the high-interest group, comparisons
were made between ages � 70 years and other age strata. No statistical differences were found in the moderate-interest group.

 patients receiving medical cannabis, only 7% of those in
California reportedly used it for cancer-related complica-
tions,29 and only 2.6% of those in the Netherlands
reported combined medical cannabis and oncolytics.30
Although reports indicate that less than 20% of patients
use cannabis for primarily medicinal purposes,31 with the
rest presumably using cannabis recreationally, only 7% of
the respondents in our study used cannabis only for recre-
ational purposes.
Cannabis use in other immunosuppressed popula-
tions and in those with other chronic conditions also
appears to be higher overall than usage rates reported for
the general public.32-34 However, comparisons with our
data may be less relevant because most studies are not con-
ducted in locales with available recreational cannabis and/
or focus on diseases that are more frequently reported in
younger patient populations (eg, inflammatory bowel dis-
ease) and/or may be associated with increased substance
use (eg, human immunodeficiency virus).35
Respondents in our cohort used cannabis for a wide
variety of physical and neuropsychiatric symptoms that
have a limited evidence base.7,36,37 Most frequently,
patients used cannabis to treat pain. Although there is evi-
dence for the pain-relieving properties of cannabis, most
data come from small studies that have evaluated its use
for chronic neuropathic pain.37-40 Other more recent
studies have suggested that cannabis may help to limit
opioid use in some patients with chronic pain.12,41 How-
ever, because pain can be a persistent symptom in cancer
patients, intermittent use among respondents may indi-
cate limits to the benefits of cannabis use for pain control.
Future studies evaluating cannabis in cancer-related pain
control are needed to assess its role as a potential adjunct
to currently approved pain-control strategies.
Data supporting cannabis use for nausea and appe-
tite improvement are even less clear, with some studies
suggesting possible benefits15,42 and others suggesting
none.11,14 Despite weak evidence, nearly 50% of oncolo-
gists would still recommend cannabis for such symp-
toms.43 In addition, a significant number of respondents
believed that cannabis helped to treat their cancer,
although no trials have addressed this question.
Neuropsychiatric problems such as depression, anxi-
ety, and insomnia are common during cancer treatment,
and evidence-based treatments are available to address
these problems.44 Despite little scientific data supporting
cannabis use for mental health–related symptoms during
cancer treatment,45 our findings reveal that a large pro-
portion of patients use cannabis for these issues. Cannabis
use may be associated with self-medication of serious
psychiatric disorders and/or avoidance of potentially ben-
eficial evidence-based approaches to these problems.
Research is needed to examine the potential role of canna-
bis as an alternative or adjunct for treating depression,
anxiety,46 and insomnia47,48 in addition to other com-
mon cancer-related comorbidities. In future studies, it
may be important to compare cannabis with alcohol and
other illicit substances that may also be used by patients to
mitigate some of these same symptoms
There is a need to better understand methods of can-
nabis use to maximize benefit and limit risk because
patients are already using a wide variety of products. Prior
studies using synthetic THC analogues9-11 have not incor-
porated the whole cannabis plant and, therefore, cannot
evaluate other substances, such as terpenes and flavonoids,
that may enhance or provide additional therapeutic prop-
erties.49 At the same time, the numerous potential risks of
cannabis in this population, including drug-drug interac-
tions,17,50
infections,16,51-54
sinopulmonary
side
effects,18,54-56 neuropsychiatric sequelae,19,57 and unin-
tended overdoses/poisonings,58-61 argue for rigorous
safety studies. Currently, however, the US government
continues to classify cannabis as a schedule I drug, and
this restricts federal funding for safety studies and those
assessing its therapeutic use in this population.62
Our study is not without limitations typically seen in
survey studies. Most importantly, only 1 in 3 patients
responded to the survey, so it is possible that a sampling
bias may have led to either overrepresentation or underrep-
resentation of current use patterns among cancer patients.
For example, it is possible that patients who were already
interested in cannabis may have been more likely to
respond to our survey, and this could have inflated the
number of active users. Conversely, because cannabis
remains an illicit drug, social desirability may have led
respondents to underreport use. As with many survey
instruments, it is also possible that because questions were
asked about both recent and past use, a recall bias may
have also affected responses. Furthermore, it is possible
that patients taking dronabinol or other cannabinoids may
have considered themselves cannabis users, and such agents
may have affected urinary testing. Our data may not reflect
rates of use among cancer patients in other states that have
different medical/recreational cannabis laws. Finally, our
survey was limited to English-speaking patients and poten-
tially missed segments of the population whose cannabis
usage patterns may vary because of cultural differences.
Despite these limitations, the moderate response rate, large
sample size, and corroboration between random urinary

 testing and survey results suggest that this study provides a
good estimate of current use practices at our center.
It is expected that many of the estimated 1.7 million
patients in the United States diagnosed with cancer yearly
will be exposed to increased local availability, permissive-
ness, and nonscientific reports suggesting benefits of canna-
bis. Because it is estimated that cannabis use will continue
to expand nationally,24 the development of a framework for
understanding the utility of cannabis among patients who
are diagnosed with cancer has become important for both
patients and providers. Despite the limited evidence for a
medical role for cannabis in oncology, our data suggest that
cannabis may be currently used frequently in this setting.
Patients are interested in receiving information about how
cannabis might benefit them and prefer that this informa-
tion come directly from their cancer providers. There is a
need for clinical trials evaluating the role of cannabis in
symptom management and for the development of formal-
ized education for patients and health care professionals
about the risks and benefits of use in this population.
