 Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus, and Pteropus spp. 
bats are the natural reservoir. From December 2010 
through March 2014, hospital-based encephalitis surveil-
lance in Bangladesh identified 18 clusters of NiV infection. 
The source of infection for case-patients in 3 clusters in 2 
districts was unknown. A team of epidemiologists and an-
thropologists investigated these 3 clusters comprising 14 
case-patients, 8 of whom died. Among the 14 case-patients, 
8 drank fermented date palm sap (tari) regularly before their 
illness, and 6 provided care to a person infected with NiV. 
The process of preparing date palm trees for tari production 
was similar to the process of collecting date palm sap for 
fresh consumption. Bat excreta was reportedly found inside 
pots used to make tari. These findings suggest that drinking 
tari is a potential pathway of NiV transmission. Interventions 
that prevent bat access to date palm sap might prevent tari-
associated NiV infection.
N
ipah virus (NiV) is a bat-borne emerging infection, 
and Pteropus spp. bats are the wildlife reservoir (1). 
NiV was discovered in an outbreak in Malaysia in 1998 
that affected 283 persons and caused 109 deaths (case-fa-
tality rate 39%) (2). Subsequently, outbreaks of NiV infec-
tion have occurred nearly every year in Bangladesh and oc-
casionally in India (1,3–5). A total of 33 outbreaks of NiV 
encephalitis were reported in Bangladesh and India during 
2001–2014, and epidemiologic investigations implicated 
batborne and human-to-human transmission (6,7). During 
2004–2012, a total of 157 NiV infections were reported in 
Bangladesh, and 22% of these occurred through human-to-
human transmission (8).
Investigations of NiV-associated outbreaks in Ban-
gladesh identified consumption of fresh date palm sap as 
the primary route of bat-to-human transmission (1,9). In 
Bengali culture, sap harvested from the date palm tree is 
commonly used for fresh consumption and fermentation 
(10,11). Moreover, in Asia, Australia, and Africa, ferment-
ed date palm sap is used to make alcoholic drinks, known as 
toddy, tari, or palm wine (12,13). In Bangladesh, date palm 
sap is typically collected in clay pots that are attached to 
the tree. A top section of the date palm tree bark is shaved, 
allowing the sap to ooze overnight into the collection pot 
(11). A previous NiV study reported that Pteropus spp. bats 
frequently feed on the shaved bark and often contaminate 
the sap with saliva, urine, and excreta (14). Pteropus spp. 
bats are also known to occasionally shed NiV in their secre-
tions and excretions (15,16).
Since 2006, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease 
Control, and Research (IEDCR) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, 
under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Ban-
gladesh, has collaborated with the International Centre for 
Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dha-
ka, on hospital-based encephalitis surveillance in the areas 
where NiV-associated outbreaks have been reported (3). 
From December 2010 through March 2014, the surveillance 
identified 18 clusters of NiV infection; in 15 of these clus-
ters, the index case-patients had exposure to fresh date palm 
sap before illness onset. For the remaining 3 clusters, the 
index case-patients had no known contact with date palm 
saps, bats, or sick animals other than bats. Recognizing the 
potential for new pathways of transmission, we investigated

other possible exposures to NiV by applying epidemiologic 
and anthropological approaches in our study of these 3 NiV 
disease clusters. We used the epidemiologic study to explain 
the proximate individual-level factors linked to the disease 
outbreak (17) and an anthropological approach to explicate 
local perceptions, behaviors, and practices that might have 
contributed to the disease occurrence (18). Therefore, the 
objectives of our investigation were to describe the clinical 
signs and symptoms of the case-patients and determine the 
possible route of transmission for these clusters.
Methods
The team conducted this study during 2011–2014 in Ra-
jshahi and Rangpur Districts, Bangladesh. Surveillance 
physicians from Rangpur Medical College Hospital and 
Rajshahi Medical College Hospital identified suspected 
case-patients (Table), recorded clinical histories and home 
addresses, and collected whole blood samples from each. 
The serum was separated from each sample, stored in liq-
uid nitrogen at the hospital, and then transported to IEDCR 
(3). The laboratory team at IEDCR tested serum samples 
for NiV IgM and IgG by using IgM-capture and indirect 
IgG enzyme immunoassays (19,21).
On the basis of type of exposure, we categorized sus-
pected case-patients as primary or secondary case-patients, 
and these two groups were further categorized as case-pa-
tients with probable or laboratory-confirmed NiV infection 
(Table). To identify a potential NiV infection cluster, sur-
veillance physicians asked each of the admitted suspected 
case-patients and their caregivers present in the hospital 
about other sick persons or persons in their communities 
who had recently died with similar symptoms. We defined 
a NiV infection cluster as >2 suspected meningoencephali-
tis case-patients living within 30 minutes’ walking distance 
from each other who had onset of similar illnesses within 3 
weeks of one another or had epidemiologic linkages to one 
another (22).
After identifying laboratory-confirmed NiV infection 
cases (Table), the team reviewed hospital records, took 
preliminary information from the surveillance physicians, 
and visited case-patients from each cluster within a month 
of case confirmation. We limited this study to clusters in 
which no case-patients had a history of drinking fresh date 
palm sap. In the community, the team used a structured 
questionnaire to interview surviving case-patients and the 
friends, relatives, and neighbors of deceased case-patients 
as proxy respondents. The team collected information re-
lated to exposure and signs and symptoms of illness to de-
termine routes of NiV transmission for each case-patient.
The team visited the households of case-patients and 
used culturally appropriate approaches to build rapport 
and trust with the community (23). The team conducted 
in-depth interviews and group discussions with surviv-
ing case-patients and the family caregivers, friends, and 
neighbors of the deceased to explore the exposure histo-
ries of each case-patient by using an open-ended interview 
guide. Open-ended questions allowed the interviewers to 
obtain new insights about the outbreak. Good rapport with 
community members helped the team collect information 
on potentially sensitive issues, such as alcohol consump-
tion (24), which is prohibited among the majority Muslim 
population of Bangladesh. The preliminary data collected 
during this study suggested that the case-patients might 
have consumed tari before their illness onset. Therefore, 
the team also interviewed 5 date palm sap harvesters and 
conducted 3 group discussions with community members 
to learn about tari production, consumption, and selling 
practices in the affected communities. The team also col-
lected and analyzed whole blood samples from surviving 
case-patients and from nonpatients (defined as persons in 
the community who drank tari with the case-patients but 
did not experience any symptoms) by using the same meth-
ods described above.
Data Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to characterize the demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of the case-patients. The 
team expanded the observation and interview field notes 
and summarized them. The primary author (M.S.I.) read 
summaries of the interviews and identified themes. These 
themes were shared among investigators for review and 
consensus. The primary author then categorized the data

Ethical Considerations
The team obtained verbal informed consent from study par-
ticipants. The surveillance and outbreak investigation study 
protocol was reviewed and approved by the ICDDR,B Eth-
ical Review Committee.
Results
Three clusters were identified, consisting of 14 case-pa-
tients (9 with confirmed NiV infection, 5 with probable 
NiV infection). Eight of the 14 case-patients were prima-
ry case-patients (3 with confirmed NiV infection, 5 with 
probable NiV infection). All 6 of the secondary case-pa-
tients had confirmed NiV infection. Among the 14 case-
patients, 7 had illness onset during January–March 2011 
in Rangpur District (first cluster), 3 had illness onset in 
February 2012 in Rajshahi District (second cluster), and 4 
had illness onset during January–February 2014 in Rang-
pur District (third cluster). Eight drank tari before their 
illness onset, whereas 6 only had exposure to other case-
patients. None of the primary case-patients had any his-
tory of drinking fresh date palm sap or exposure to sick 
humans or animals. All of the illnesses began with fever. 
All 8 of the primary case-patients had altered mental status 
followed by loss of consciousness and death. The median 
duration from illness onset to death was 6 days. All 6 sec-
ondary case-patients survived. The median age of all 14 
case-patients was 32 years. All the primary case-patients 
were male, and all the secondary case-patients were fe-
male. None of the non–case-patients had NiV IgM or IgG 
detected in their serum samples.
In the 2011 Rangpur cluster, case-patients A, B, C, and 
G drank tari regularly in the evenings, and the sap to make 
tari was collected from a single village (Figure). Case-pa-
tients A and G were family friends and lived in the same 
village. Case-patients B and C were also related and lived 
in the same village. Case-patients D, E, and F were fam-
ily caregivers of case-patient C and provided close-contact 
care during his illness. All 3 family caregivers experienced 
illness within 2 weeks of case-patient C’s illness onset.
In the 2012 Rajshahi cluster, case-patient H was a tari 
producer and harvester of date palm sap. Case-patient I was 
a neighbor and cousin of case-patient H, and both drank 
tari regularly in the evenings. They drank tari together 
from the same pot 6 days before their illness onsets. Case-
patient J was a family caregiver of patient H and provided 
close-contact care during his illness. She experienced fever 
11 days after case-patient H’s illness onset.
In the 2014 Rangpur cluster, the respondents reported 
that case-patients K and L were family friends and had 
drunk tari every day in the evenings before their illness 
onsets (Figure). Case-patient L became ill after 5 days after 
case-patient K, and case-patient L did not have any contact 
with case-patient K while case-patient K was ill. The tari 
they drank was collected from the same village where the 
2011 Rangpur cluster was identified. Case-patients M and 
N shared the same bed with case-patient L at home; case-
patient N was a family caregiver to case-patient L, provid-
ing close-contact care for him at home and in the hospital. 
Case-patient M had onset of fever 12 days later, and case-
patient N had onset of fever 14 days after case-patient L’s 
illness onset.
Tari Production, Processing, and Selling Patterns in 
Rangpur and Rajshahi
The area of Rangpur where the case-patients lived was 
well known for its tari production and was the largest tari-
producing area in the district. An estimated 500 date palm 
trees grow in the area, which produces and supplies tari 
throughout the district. Tari retailers from different subdis-
tricts of Rangpur also come to this area to buy tari at a 
wholesale price. In the affected villages, the tari producers 
reported that they had been leasing all the date palm trees 
for several years. Villagers reported they did not have regu-
lar access to fresh date palm sap because almost all the date 
palm sap from the village was made into tari.
In the NiV-affected area of Rajshahi, the tari is pro-
duced in small quantities. An estimated 15 date palm trees

grow in the affected community of Rajshahi. The tari pro-
ducer leases these trees only during winter to produce tari.
The tari production process was identical in each of 
the affected communities. The process of preparing the 
date palm trees for tari production was similar to the pro-
cess for collecting date palm sap for fresh consumption 
(11). To prepare the tree for tapping, the sap harvesters cut 
the old leaves close to the top of the trees with a knife to 
expose the tender part of the tree. To tap the tree, the har-
vesters shave a V-shaped cut at the top of the tree and set 
a bamboo spigot at the end of the cut. After 3–5 days, the 
V cut is shaved again, and an earthen pot is hung under the 
spigot to catch the sap that oozes out. For fresh date palm 
sap, the harvesters need to clean and dry the sap collection 
pots after each episode of sap collection. However, tari har-
vesters from both affected communities reported that they 
use the same earthen pot for sap collection for several days 
without cleaning it so that yeast can form at the bottom of 
the earthen pot. Yeast aids the fermentation of the fresh 
date palm sap in the pot.
In Rangpur, the date palm sap is harvested for tari year 
round. The harvesters reported that date palm sap can be 
collected from each tree for 3–4 days a week for 4 months 
at a time, and then the tree is left to recover for the next 
7–8 months. The harvesters stagger the tapping of trees 
so there is a continuous supply of date palm sap to make 
tari throughout the year. The harvesters reported that they 
harvest more sap during winter than during other seasons 
because of higher demand for tari from consumers. More-
over, they reported that the sap flows more freely from each 
tree during the winter. In the affected communities, the har-
vesters reported that every day from 8 a.m. until noon, they 
collect the sap from the hanging earthen pots and accumu-
late the collected sap in other earthen pots or containers 
and leave the hanging pots on the trees. In Rangpur, the 
harvesters bring tari to their house and immediately sell it 
to retailers and consumers from morning until late at night. 
Occasionally, consumers take tari away with them in plas-
tic bottles. In the affected area of Rajshahi, after being re-
moved from the trees, the tari pots are kept in a betel leaf 
garden, and the harvesters sell tari from there.
The tari sellers and harvesters reported that tari consum-
ers are men and included truck and bus drivers, day laborers, 
rickshaw pullers, and local farmers. They also reported that 
tari is less expensive than other illegal alcohol available for 
sale and that making tari is less laborious than collecting 
fresh date palm sap because harvesters do not need to clean 
and dry the earthen pots after each collection. They added 
that making tari is more profitable than selling fresh date 
palm sap. During our visit to communities near to the af-
fected areas in Rangpur, the price of fresh date palm sap was 
$0.20 per liter, and the price of tari was $0.50 per liter. The 
price differential provides an incentive for making tari.
We observed bat roosts in the affected community of 
Rangpur, and date palm sap harvesters reported that they 
frequently observe bats flying near the date palm trees. The 
harvesters reported that they often find bat excreta in and 
on the sap pots. The harvesters reported filtering tari with 
a net or cloth before selling it to remove the excreta. In 
Rajshahi, the villagers reported that there is no bat roost in 
their community. However, they reported seeing bats visit-
ing date palm trees at night. None of the harvesters in Ra-
jshahi reported filtering tari before selling it to consumers.
Discussion
The laboratory, clinical, and qualitative findings in this 
study suggest that the 14 case-patients in the 3 clusters we 
investigated were infected with NiV. The primary NiV case-
patients identified in the clusters drank tari regularly in the 
evenings before their illness onsets, and none of them had a 
history of fresh date palm sap consumption or any exposure 
to other NiV case-patients, which were the main transmis-
sion pathways for NiV infection identified in previous out-
break investigations in Bangladesh (9,26). Moreover, none 
of the case-patients had exposure to sick animals, another 
possible pathway for NiV transmission reported in studies 
conducted in Malaysia and Singapore (27).
Tari is a date palm sap product. Because tari fermenta-
tion was a continuous process and date palm sap was fer-
mented inside the tari pots while they were hanging in the 
trees, some date palm sap added to the tari might technical-
ly be fresh sap. However, the primary case-patients prob-
ably did not consume fresh date palm sap because tari was 
collected from 8 a.m. to noon but the primary case-patients 
drank tari only in the evening, which suggests that all the 
sap they consumed was at least partially fermented by the 
time of consumption. Findings from this investigation sug-
gest that drinking tari is a potential source of NiV infection 
in Bangladesh. Investigators in India had similar findings 
during an outbreak reported in 2007 in West Bengal near 
the border with Bangladesh (4). They reported that drink-
ing fermented date palm sap possibly contaminated with 
bats excreta and secretions was the source of NiV infection 
for the index patient, which further supports our assertion 
that NiV infection from drinking tari is plausible (4). More-
over, 2 clusters in this study were traced back to the same 
tari production village in Rangpur, further strengthening 
the conclusion that tari was the mode of transmission.
Previous studies have shown that fruit bats frequently 
lick the date palm sap and occasionally urinate inside col-
lection pots (14). In our investigation, the reported evi-
dence of bats visiting date palm trees, the presence of bat 
excreta inside tari pots, the reported use of the same pot for 
several days without cleaning, and the accumulation of sap 
from multiple pots into 1 pot suggest that sap is probably 
contaminated with bat urine or saliva during collection and

fermentation. NiV can survive up to 4 days in bat urine and 
at least 1 day in sap contaminated with bat urine when kept 
at an average temperature of 19°C (28). A study to deter-
mine viability of NiV in artificial palm sap contaminated 
with NiV (strain Bangladesh/200401066) found no statisti-
cally significant reduction in NiV titers for at least 7 days 
when kept at a temperature of 22°C (29). Generally, envel-
oped and thus lipophilic viruses like NiV are susceptible to 
alcohol. A 60%–70% alcohol solution is recommended for 
sterilizing contaminated objects (30). A study conducted in 
India showed that tari derived naturally from fermenting 
date palm sap contains 5%–8% alcohol and has a pH of 
4.5–6.0 (12). This 5%–8% alcohol concentration might not 
have been high enough or sufficiently distributed through-
out the tari to sterilize the NiV, thus allowing persistence 
of viable virus and transmission of NiV to tari consumers 
during the winter months, when the ambient temperature 
ranges from 15°C to 28°C (21).
In Bangladesh, family caregivers commonly provide 
close-contact care to hospitalized patients (31). Infected 
patients often shed the virus through body secretions and 
excretions and can contaminate foods and surfaces, includ-
ing bed rails, bed sheets, and towels (32,33). Close contact 
is the most likely route through which family caregivers 
became infected (26). Family caregivers identified in this 
study had direct contact with primary case-patients and 
their body secretions.
The findings of our study are subject to limitations. 
First, some participants may have been reluctant to re-
port production, consumption, and selling of tari because 
these are illegal activities in Bangladesh. Initially, some 
of the date palm sap harvesters and tari producers were 
reluctant to share information with us. However, the so-
cial scientists on the investigation team built rapport and 
trust with the respondents, which encouraged the respon-
dents to share sensitive information (23). Thus, the hesi-
tance to disclose behaviors related to tari probably did 
not have a substantial effect on our findings. Second, 
no control group was available. Without a comparison 
group, we were unable to determine if our primary case-
patients were more likely than other persons residing in 
these villages to drink tari. However, given the absence of 
evidence that the primary case-patients had other contact 
with bats, sick animals, or persons with NiV infection, 
consumption of tari appears to be the most likely trans-
mission route. Third, we interviewed family members and 
friends of the deceased case-patients as proxy respondents 
to ascertain case exposures. However, during outbreaks of 
fatal diseases such as NiV infection (with a case-fatality 
rate >70%), there is no alternative to this approach (20). 
Since 2003, we have interviewed proxy respondents for 
case-exposures in every NiV-associated outbreak investi-
gation conducted in Bangladesh (3,9,19). Fourth, because 
of the delays in investigation of the 2011 cluster, our defi-
nition for a confirmed cases of NiV infection was based 
on the presence of NiV IgM or IgG in serum samples. 
Confirming a case based on the presence of IgG is reason-
able, however, because all the family caregivers from the 
2011 Rangpur cluster had illness onset within 2 weeks 
after contact with a case-patient (19).
Because harvesting date palm sap for tari production 
is similar to harvesting it for consumption of fresh date 
palm sap, the intervention of using bamboo skirts to cover 
the shaved part of the date palm tree and the sap collection 
pots to prevent bat contact and possible NiV introduction 
is worth exploring. The use of bamboo skirts is already a 
successful, affordable, and culturally acceptable method to 
prevent bat access to date palm sap, and this strategy could 
also be used to prevent NiV transmission from tari con-
sumption (34,35). In addition, tari harvesters from ethnic 
minority communities have limited access to mass media 
because of their ethnic, religious, and linguistic minority 
status in Bangladesh. Efforts should be made to raise their 
awareness about strategies that interrupt bat access to date 
palm sap. At this time, we are not aware of any studies that 
have tested the survival of NiV in tari. As a next step, we 
recommend testing NiV survival in tari at different levels 
of alcohol concentration.
All 3 of the clusters of NiV infection that we investi-
gated were linked to drinking tari. Drinking tari might also 
be a route of exposure for other batborne viruses. A total 
of 55 newly described viruses from 7 virus families were 
recently identified in urine and saliva from Pteropus spp. 
bats in Bangladesh (36), suggesting that these bats could 
also contaminate tari with other viruses that could cause 
disease in humans. Date palm sap is harvested for fermen-
tation in many areas where Pteropus spp. bats and other 
fruit bats are native, including Australia, Asia, and Africa 
(37–40). Consumers of fermented drinks and other date 
palm products that are harvested using similar processes as 
in Bangladesh might be at risk for NiV infection and other 
batborne diseases (12,13,36).
