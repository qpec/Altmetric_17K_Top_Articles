ABSTRACT
Introduction Gender disparities in income continue to
exist, and many studies have quantified the gap between
male and female workers. These studies paint an
incomplete picture of gender income disparity because of
their reliance on notoriously inaccurate or incomplete
surveys. We quantified gender reimbursement disparity
between female and male healthcare providers using
objective, non-self-reported data and attempted to
adjust the disparity against commonly held beliefs as to
why it exists.
Methods We analysed over three million publicly
available Medicare reimbursement claims for calendar
year 2012 and compared the reimbursements received
by male and female healthcare providers in 13 medical
specialties. We adjusted these reimbursement totals
against how hard providers worked, how productive
each provider was, and their level of experience. We
calculated a reimbursement differential between male
and female providers by primary medical specialty.
Results The overall adjusted reimbursement differential
against female providers was −US$18 677.23 (95% CI
−US$19 301.94 to −US$18 052.53). All 13 specialties
displayed a negative reimbursement differential against
female providers. Only two specialties had
reimbursement differentials that were not statistically
significant.
Conclusions After adjustment for how hard a
physician works, his/her years of experience and his/her
productivity, female healthcare providers are still
reimbursed less than male providers. Using objective,
non-survey data will provide a more accurate
understanding of this reimbursement inequity and
perhaps lead the medical profession (as a whole)
towards a solution that can reverse this decades-old
injustice.
INTRODUCTION
For decades studies have shown inequities in pay
between women and men. Some of the earliest ana-
lyses of pay inequity were conducted in the 1970s,
and, since that time, reports indicate that women
consistently earn less than their male contemporar-
ies.1 2 Indeed one would be hard pressed to iden-
tify a single calendar year in which female workers
achieved
earnings
parity
with
their
male
counterparts.
Many studies have theorised that pay disparities
result from women (1) undervaluing the services
they provide, (2) working fewer hours and/or (3)
being less productive.3–10 Unfortunately, these the-
ories are based on analyses of data that are
susceptible to bias and/or not adjusted for con-
founding variables.11 12 A large proportion of these
studies rely on self-reported income and many do
not adjust for factors that could influence gender
pay.13 14 With such limitations, we believe that the
medical community could improve upon its under-
standing of gender pay inequality. W
e quantified
gender reimbursement disparity between female
and male healthcare providers using objective,
non-self-reported data and attempted to adjust the
disparity against commonly held beliefs as to why it
exists.
METHODS
W
e obtained healthcare provider reimbursement
data for various medical specialties using the 2014
Medicare Fee-for-Service Provider Utilisation and
Payment Data Physician and Other Supplier Public

(PUF)

2012_update.zip). This freely available dataset
contains the practice locations, primary medical
specialty, sex, reimbursements paid, services pro-
vided, and beneficiaries seen of, to and by health-
care providers participating in the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Part B
fee-for-service programme in the USA for calendar
year 2012.15 The CMS Office of Information
Products and Data Analytics used data from the
National Claims History Standard Analytic Files to
create the Medicare PUF
. The data in the PUF
are
not
self-reported
by
individual
healthcare
providers.15
Unlike survey data used by previous investigators,
the 2014 Medicare PUF did not include: hours
worked, non-clinical earnings, bonus/incentive/per-
formance monies, medical school type/location/
graduation date, or years in clinical practice. The
PUF
included
the
National
Provider
Identifier
(NPI), which we used to estimate the years in clin-
ical practice for each provider. The National Plan
and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) gener-
ates a unique NPI for each healthcare provider.16 17
Each provider receives an NPI from NPPES once
and uses that NPI to submit reimbursement claims
to CMS during the entirety of their active clinical
practice. W

 the year a provider’s NPI was generated (enumeration year) and
the year 2012. W
e used this value as a surrogate for years of
clinical experience.
W
e calculated reimbursement differentials between reimburse-
ments paid to female and male providers. Subsequently, we per-
formed multivariate
analyses of reimbursement differential
against a number of confounding variables. Based on the work
of W
eeks et al,3 Baker5 and Seabury et al,18 we included the fol-
lowing confounders in our model: primary medical specialty,
years of clinical experience, hours worked and productivity. The
first confounder was included in the 2014 PUF. Using the NPI
enumeration year, we calculated a surrogate value for the
number of years of clinical experience. W
e used the number of
Medicare beneficiaries seen as a surrogate for the total number
of hours worked delivering care to patients. Based on data pre-
sented in The Physicians Foundation Annual Report and The
W
ashington Post, we assumed that providers who delivered care
to more beneficiaries were likely to have worked more hours
than those who delivered care to fewer beneficiaries.19
20
Similarly, we assumed that the number of services provided
would be an appropriate surrogate for productivity: the greater
the
number
of
services
provided,
the
greater
the
productivity.19 20
W
e restricted our analyses to providers who self-identified as
practicing internal medicine, family practice, or a medical spe-
cialty, such as cardiology, endocrinology, nephrology, rheumatol-
ogy, haematology, medical oncology, haematology and oncology,
pulmonary, critical care, infectious disease or gastroenterology.
W
e used Microsoft Excel and JMP to perform multiple linear
regression analyses and calculated an adjusted reimbursement
differential between women and men. Our statistical threshold
for significance was p<0.05. Wherever possible, we followed
the STROBE and SAMPL guidelines for conducting observa-
tional research and reporting results, respectively.21 22 The insti-
tutional review boards of the Department of Veterans Affairs
(Salisbury, North Carolina, USA) and East Carolina University—
Brody School of Medicine (Greenville, North Carolina, USA)
approved this study.
RESULTS
The Medicare PUF for calendar year 2012 contained 9 153 273
records for 882 125 providers. W
e included the records of pro-
viders in 13 medical specialties, resulting in 3 549 862 records
for 246 995 providers. W
e were either missing or unable to
download and/or analyse records for 1344 providers (0.5%). Of
the remaining providers in our dataset (245 651), nearly 70%
were generalists in either internal medicine (91 336; 37%) or
family practice (77 452; 32%). The greatest number of specia-
lists was in cardiology (22 150; 9%) and the fewest in haematol-
ogy (682; 0.3%).
The dataset with which we worked had a 70:30 ratio of male
to female providers. Cardiology had the lowest percentage of
female providers (10.7%). No specialty had an equal percentage
of male/female providers; endocrinology came close to parity
with a male/female ratio of 57:43. Tables 1 and 2 summarise
our baseline data.
In the unadjusted analysis, female providers were reimbursed
US$34 125.68 (95% CI −US$34 991.61 to −US$33 259.76)
less. Six specialties had a female reimbursement differential
greater than the overall differential (cardiology, haematology/
oncology,
haematology,
nephrology,
medical
oncology
and
rheumatology); all differentials were statistically significant. The
narrowest reimbursement differentials were in family practice
(−US$15 029.77 (95% CI −US$15 627.83 to −US$14 431.70))
and
infectious
disease
(−US$19 176.82
(95%
CI
−US
$23 177.82 to −US$15 175.83)), but female providers had a
statistically significant gap in reimbursement compared with
male providers in every specialty. Table 3 summarises the
unadjusted analysis.
In the adjusted analysis, we used surrogate observations to
account for three confounders purported to affect the disparity
in gender reimbursement: years of experience (surrogate: years
since NPI enumerated), productivity (surrogate: number of ser-
vices provided) and hours worked (surrogate: number of benefi-
ciaries seen). The overall adjusted reimbursement differential
was
−US$18 677.23
(95%
CI
−US$19 301.94
to
−US
$18 052.53). Nephrology displayed the largest statistically sig-
nificant gender differential of −US$16 688.96 (95% CI −US
$21 437.04 to −US$11 940.88). Of the 13 specialties, only
haematology and medical oncology had differentials that were
not statistically significant. Table 3 and figure 1 summarise the
adjusted analyses.
DISCUSSION
After adjustment for hours worked, productivity and level of
experience, female healthcare providers received lower reimbur-
sements than their male counterparts. Investigators have often
cited at least one of these explanations for the disparity in phys-
ician pay.3 5–9 23 Despite these adjustments, female providers
received statistically lower reimbursements in 11 of 13 medical
specialities.
W
eeks and W
allace have extensively analysed the income dis-
parities for physicians.3 6–9 Their work has revealed widespread
inequality in an overwhelming number of specialties and has led
them to conclude that three variables are likely to affect this
inequality: physician effort, physician experience and practice
characteristics. In the present investigation, we adjusted for
physician
effort
and
experience
using
objective,
non-self-reported surrogate observations. W
e were unable to
adjust for practice characteristics because the Medicare PUF did
not contain such information.
Baker5 and Sasser23 expounded on the theories of W
eeks and
W
allace by suggesting that type of specialty affects physician
income. Female physicians are more likely to work in less lucra-
tive specialties, so their incomes will be lower than their male
counterparts who more commonly work in highly lucrative
fields. Baker’s work also shed light on the factors that did not
affect income, namely biological age, ethnic group and type/
geography of medical school.5 Therefore, we adjusted our ana-
lysis for 13 medical specialties. W
e found that in 11 of these
specialties, female providers received statistically less reimburse-
ment than male providers irrespective of the amount worked,
level of productivity or years of experience.
In 2009, Cron and Gilly reintroduced ‘inherent value’ to the
discussion of gender pay inequality.24 Female workers receive
less money because they price their services lower than male
counterparts. This idea may hold true in traditional industries.
In healthcare, insurance companies set the price for most ser-
vices, with a heavy reliance on the pricing trends established by
Medicare. Differences in prices are more likely to be due to geo-
graphic considerations or concomitant services provided than
the negotiating prowess of individual providers.25 As a result,
individual providers are less likely to undervalue themselves
because they are unlikely to broadly affect prices for healthcare
services.

analyses of gender income inequality in healthcare. After analys-
ing self-reported data in the March Current Population Survey

 and adjusting for race, age, sex, hours worked and practice loca-
tion, they revealed a US$33 840.00–US$56 019.00 income
range differential between female and male providers. This dif-
ferential straddles the US$34 125.68 unadjusted differential
(95% CI −US$34 991.61 to −US$33 259.76) that we report,
but is double the US$18 677.23 adjusted differential in our ana-
lysis. The discrepancies between these investigations may be due
to different sample sizes (38 115 vs 245 651), the manner in
which data were collected (self-reported in the Seabury study),
and/or the inability to adjust for specialty or procedural volume
using the March Current Population Survey dataset.14 18
W
e recognise that the work of these investigators has provided
the foundation on which contemporary analyses, such as our
own, have been performed. Unfortunately, these antecedent
studies relied on survey data from various sources, including the
American Medical Association, Survey of Young Physicians, US
Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and/or March
Current Population Survey.3 5–9 18 23 24 Despite our belief in the
methodologies of these surveys, there are unavoidable biases
that percolate through them which can negatively impact their
analysis.13
26 Our investigation used reimbursement claims
information—data that are not self-reported. In so far as these
data are not self-reported, analysis of the Medicare PUF should
not be plagued by low survey response rates or measurement/
sampling biases.10–12 27
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
The size and type of data analysed help strengthen our analyses
and conclusions. The Medicare PUF contains observational data
for all providers that billed Medicare Part B for services in cal-
endar year 2012. W
e analysed data from over 245 000 provi-
ders. Our study is one of the largest to address gender pay
inequity
in
recent
years,
including
the
recently
released
Doximity survey of 35 000 providers.28 Equally important is the
fact
that
the
data
for
these
providers
are
objective.
Consequently, the PUF is less susceptible to poor response rates
or self-reporting biases that can exist when survey data are
used.3 5–9 18 23 24

 Another strength is our ability to adjust for variables that have
been proposed to be the reasons for gender pay inequality.29 30
After adjusting for physician work hours, productivity and years
of experience, we found a statistically significant gender reim-
bursement differential in 85% of specialties analysed.
As with all investigations, ours has limitations worthy of
mention. First, we used surrogate markers to estimate physician
work hours, productivity and years of experience. Prior investi-
gations have directly measured these variables through the use
of surveys.3 5–9 18 23 24 28 W
e knowingly used surrogate vari-
ables in our analyses to avoid the uncertainties of working with
survey
data.11
Second,
we
analysed
reimbursements
from
Medicare Part B only. While Medicare is the largest insurer of
patients in the USA, we ignored reimbursements from other
agencies/companies, including other federal programmes (eg,
Federal Employees Health Benefits, Tricare) and the Medicare
Advantage plan.15 29 31 Could there be more female providers
receiving higher reimbursements from other agencies than male
providers? The data needed to answer this and other questions
were not available to us. Had it been available, our analyses
would have provided an even more complete picture of reim-
bursement differentials. Third, our analysis does not address
quality of care. Because the Medicare PUF does not contain
such information, we do not know if quality of care affects pro-
vider reimbursement.15 Lastly, and perhaps most regrettably, we
still do not have an answer as to why female providers are reim-
bursed less than their male counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS
Reimbursement differentials between male and female providers
continue to exist in a large proportion of medical specialties. Our
findings suggest that the commonly held theories of why monet-
ary disparities exist need to be revisited.32 33 After adjustment for
work hours, years of experience and productivity, female health-
care providers are still reimbursed less than male providers.
Despite using Medicare Part B data to ascertain specialty-specific
reimbursement differentials, we have no reason to believe that
such differentials exist only in this dataset. If there is a disparity
in gender reimbursement that is independent of the health insur-
ance company that is billed, then future research should be per-
formed to uncover this pattern. Only then can the medical
community have the most accurate understanding of the reim-
bursement inequity and perhaps be guided towards a solution
that can reverse this decades-old injustice.34–36

 Main messages
▸ Female healthcare providers are reimbursed less than their
male contemporaries.
▸ The Medicare Public Use File is one of the largest publicly
accessible databases to contain reimbursement data.
▸ After adjustment for productivity, amount of work and years
of experience, female providers are reimbursed less than
their male counterparts.
Current research questions
▸ Is the reimbursement disparity limited to Medicare, or is it
seen with other insurance companies?
▸ Can we quantify hours worked and productivity in a more
direct manner than using surrogates or survey data?
▸ How can the medical profession resolve the gender disparity
in reimbursement?
