Phytochemical studies on the liverwort Radula genus have previously identified the bibenzyl (−)-cis-perrottetinene 
(cis-PET), which structurally resembles (−)-9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-trans-THC) from Cannabis sativa 
L. Radula preparations are sold as cannabinoid-like legal high on the internet, even though pharmacological data 
are lacking. Herein, we describe a versatile total synthesis of (−)-cis-PET and its (−)-trans diastereoisomer and 
demonstrate that both molecules readily penetrate the brain and induce hypothermia, catalepsy, hypolocomo-
tion, and analgesia in a CB1 receptor–dependent manner in mice. The natural product (−)-cis-PET was profiled on 
major brain receptors, showing a selective cannabinoid pharmacology. This study also uncovers pharmacological 
differences between 9-THC and PET diastereoisomers. Most notably, (−)-cis-PET and (−)-trans-PET significantly 
reduced basal brain prostaglandin levels associated with 9-trans-THC side effects in a CB1 receptor–dependent 
manner, thus mimicking the action of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. Therefore, the natural product 
(−)-cis-PET is a psychoactive cannabinoid from bryophytes, illustrating the existence of convergent evolution of 
bioactive cannabinoids in the plant kingdom. Our findings may have implications for bioprospecting and drug 
discovery and provide a molecular rationale for the reported effects upon consumption of certain Radula prepa-
rations as moderately active legal highs.
INTRODUCTION
Cannabinoids have a wide range of actual and potential therapeutic 
applications, and marijuana is widely used not only for its recre-
ational but also for its medicinal properties (1, 2). To date, the plant 
Cannabis sativa L. is the only known natural source of CB1 cannabi-
noid receptor (CB1R) activators, with 9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(9-trans-THC) being the most potent partial agonist (3, 4). The 
THC scaffold was presumed unique to the Cannabis plant genus 
until the bibenzyl cis-THC, (−)-cis-perrottetinene (cis-PET) (Fig. 1), 
was isolated from the liverwort Radula perrottetii Gottsche ex Steph 
in 1994 by Asakawa and co-workers and later from Radula marginata 
Taylor ex Gottsch (5, 6). Further, Cullman and Becker isolated cis-
PET from Radula laxiramea Steph (7). Bryophytes are a distinctive 
group of an early-diverged lineage of nonvascular land plants com-
prising more than 20,000 species (Fig. 1). This division includes 
mosses, hornworts, and liverworts (8). Liverworts often generate the 
opposite stereochemical configuration in secondary metabolite bio-
synthesis compared with higher plants (9). This is also the case for 
the cis configuration in the cyclohexene ring in cis-PET compared 
with 9-trans-THC. The absolute stereochemistry of cis-PET was 
fully structurally characterized in 2008 (10). Comparatively little 
attention has been paid to the liverworts for use in human diet or 
medicine to date (9). Worldwide anecdotal reports both affirm and 
refute the effectiveness of consuming R. marginata preparations in-
ducing a legal cannabis-like high. However, the pharmacology of 
this natural product remains unknown. R. marginata is endemic to 
New Zealand and Tasmania, and collected dried samples are cur-
rently sold via the internet as an emerging recreational drug or as 
incense (see Acknowledgments). A molecular understanding of 
the effects of PET is essential to anticipate potential toxicological 
or recreational effects in humans. On the basis of a previously es-
tablished stereodivergent synthesis of 9-THCs (11–13), we re-
port a versatile total synthesis of natural cis-PET and its (−)-trans 
diastereoisomer (Figs. 2 and 3). This enabled a comparative study 
of PET and 9-THC structure-activity relationships for CB1R and 
CB2R activation, respectively, as well as cannabimimetic and bio-
chemical effects in mice. To further investigate the pharmacological 
effects of the liverwort cannabinoid, we measured the bioavailability 
of cis-PET to the brain and profiled this natural product on major 
central nervous system (CNS) receptors. The CB1R-mediated psycho-
active pharmacology is characterized by a typical central effect pat-
tern in mice, generally referred to as the “tetrad test,” which includes 
antinociception, hypothermia, catalepsy, and locomotion inhibi-
tion (14). A full assessment of both PET diastereoisomers on the 
endocannabinoid system (ECS) was performed. This study not only 
provides a molecular basis on which to assess the mode of action 
and emerging recreational use of smoked Radula liverwort prepara-
tions as legal high but also allows a direct comparison with 9-THC 
for potential therapeutic applications.
RESULTS
Stereodivergent total synthesis of cis- and trans-PET
We previously introduced stereodivergent catalysis to enable the 
synthesis of all stereoisomers of a target, applying it to the synthesis 
of 9-THCs (11–13). Maintaining this stereodivergent step, the 
strategy was adapted to synthesize sufficient amounts of PETs for 
biological testing and relied on a SNAr cyclization to assemble the 
dihydrobenzopyran core (15). Following a stereodivergent step using 
iridium- and amine-catalyzed aldehyde allylation (1 + 2 → 3), the 
SNAr precursors 4 were prepared through ring-closing metathesis, 
oxidative esterification, and subsequent Grignard addition (Fig. 2).

The outcome of the crucial SNAr cyclization was highly dependent 
on the choice of base; in reactions with LiHMDS and NaHMDS, the 
substrate proved to be unreactive, with full recovery of starting ma-
terial after 16 hours in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF). The use of 
KHMDS under otherwise identical conditions resulted in the forma-
tion of (S,R)-5 and (R,R)-5 in high yield (Fig. 3). Last, demethylation 
with sodium ethanethiolate in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 
140°C afforded (−)-cis-PET and (−)-trans-PET.
In vitro pharmacology of PET and 9-THC isomers  
on cannabinoid receptors and  
endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes
At the human cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R), the natural prod-
uct cis-PET exhibited a Ki = 481 nM, while its diastereoisomer 
trans-PET was more potent (Ki = 127 nM) (see Table 1 and fig. S1). 
Similarly, at the human peripheral cannabinoid receptor type 2 
(CB2R), Ki values of 225 and 126 nM for cis- and trans-PET were 
measured, respectively. These differences parallel the lower affinity 
of 9-cis-THC compared to 9-trans-THC. 9-cis-THC is a minor 
cannabinoid in cannabis (16) and a moderately active CB1R partial 
agonist (Table 1), in agreement with the in vivo data reported 
for racemic 9-cis-THC prior to the identification of CB receptors 
(17). Thus, the benzyl substituent in PET does not fundamentally 
alter the binding relationships at CB receptors. In [35S]GTPS 
binding assays, both PETs were partial CB1R agonists such as the 
9-THCs, reaching 60 to 80% of the maximal efficacy of the known 
full CB1R/CB2R agonist CP55,940 (see Table 1 and fig. S2). At the 
CB1R functional level, cis-PET was about 10 times less potent than 
9-trans-THC [half maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 406 nM 
versus 43 nM] (fig. S2A). Similarly, 9-trans-THC showed a lower 
EC50 value at CB2R compared with cis-PET (12 nM versus 167 nM) 
(fig. S2B). cis-PET was slightly more potent at CB2R than trans-
PET, revealing a distinct stereochemical bias toward CB2R over 
CB1R at the functional level as compared with the corresponding 
9-THCs. At CB2R, all cannabinoids were inefficient partial agonists 
despite their nanomolar receptor binding affinities. No relevant ef-
fects on the major endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes fatty acid 
amid hydrolase (FAAH), monoacyl glycerol lipase (MAGL), and 
/ hydrolases 6 and 12 (ABHD6 and ABHD12) were observed in 
vitro below 10 M (table S1).
In vivo pharmacology of cis- and trans-PET
The potential cannabimimetic effects of PET diastereoisomers were 
assessed in vivo in a battery of four tests typically associated with 
CB1R activation in mice (hypothermia, catalepsy, hypolocomotion, 
and analgesia), collectively referred to as the “tetrad” (14). Experi-
ments using various (i.e., equipotent to 9-trans-THC) doses showed 
that cis-PET (50 mg/kg) and trans-PET (40 mg/kg) elicited the full 
tetrad in BALB/c mice upon intraperitoneal injection (Fig. 4). The 
magnitude of hypothermia, catalepsy, hypolocomotion, and anal-
gesia was in the same range as seen with 9-trans-THC at the dose 
of 10 mg/kg, in agreement with the different potencies measured in 
vitro for CB1R activation. The pharmacological effects of PET and 
THC diastereoisomers were fully abolished by pretreatment with the 
CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (SR1) at 5 mg/kg, indicating 
that the tetrad is dependent on CB1 receptor activation in the brain.
LC-MS/MS quantification of cis- and trans-perrottetinene 
PET, endocannabinoids, prostaglandins, and arachidonic 
acid levels in mouse brain
We developed a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrom-
etry (LC-MS/MS) method to quantify 9-trans-THC, cis-PET, 
and trans-PET in the brain. Endocannabinoid levels and other N- 
acetylethanolamines (NAEs), arachidonic acid (AA), prostaglandin 
D2 (PGD2), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were quantified to evalu-
ate potential biochemical changes upon cannabinoid exposure (Fig. 5 
and fig. S3). We measured 9-trans-THC, cis-PET, and trans-PET 
concentrations of 0.24, 1.64, and 0.80 nmol/g, respectively, in total 
brain 1 hour after injection (Fig. 5A). This corresponds to a concen-
tration of 197 nM for 9-trans-THC, 1350 nM for cis-PET, and 
662 nM for trans-PET, in line with the bioactive concentrations for 
CB1R activation (Table 1). Correlation between brain penetration 
and behavioral pharmacology was also observed for 9-trans-THC 
(Fig. 5A), in line with the literature (18). In plasma, the concentra-
tions of 9-trans-THC, cis-PET, and trans-PET were 0.47, 1.79, and 
1.56 nmol/ml, respectively (fig. S4). These results show that 9-
trans-THC and PET diastereoisomers rapidly and efficiently accu-
mulate in the brain with Cbrain/Cplasma ratios (Kp values) of 0.51 for 
9-trans-THC, 0.91 for cis-PET, and 0.51 for trans-PET. Animals 
treated with 9-trans-THC, cis-PET, and trans-PET did not display 
any significant modulation of the endocannabinoids anandamide 
(AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) levels in the brain as 
compared with vehicle (Fig. 5, B and C). Similarly, the brain levels 
of AA were not affected by the treatments (Fig. 5D). Unexpectedly, 
cis- and trans-PET significantly reduced the basal levels of PGD2 
and PGE2 in the brain in a CB1 receptor–dependent manner (Fig. 5, 
E and F). In sharp contrast, no significant acute effects on prosta-
glandins were observed in 9-trans-THC–treated animals. Given the 
wide-reaching importance of prostaglandins in the brain (19, 20), 
these pharmacological effects notably differentiate PET from 
9-trans-THC.
cis-PET pharmacology on major CNS targets
To characterize the in vitro pharmacology of cis-PET, we assessed 
this novel cannabinoid in a screening panel of 44 CNS targets, includ-
ing G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, nuclear

receptors, membrane transporters, and enzymes. At the concentra-
tion of 10 M (blue line), cis-PET showed the highest binding affinity 
toward CB1R and CB2R (≥90%), followed by serotonin receptors 
5-HT2A (86%) and 5-HT2B (85%), cholecystokinin receptor (CCK1; 
84%), dopamine transporter (DAT; 83%), and l-type Ca2+ channel 
(80%) (Fig. 6). At a concentration of 1 M, cis-PET still binds sig-
nificantly to CB1R (68%) and CB2R (75%), while it markedly lost 
affinity for 5-HT2A (5%), 5-HT2B (30%), CCK1 (32%), DAT (27%), 
and l-type Ca2+ channel (9%) (Fig. 6, orange line). This is in agree-
ment with the full CB1R dependence of the cis-PET effects in vivo 
obtained in the behavioral tests (Fig. 4, tetrad) and modulation of 
prostaglandin levels in mouse brain (Fig. 5, E and F). Last, these 
data are also in perfect agreement with the measured brain concen-
tration of cis-PET, which reached approximately 1.4 M at the dose

of 50 mg/kg (Fig. 5A). 9-trans-THC has been shown to interact 
with other targets beyond CB receptors at concentrations between 1 
and 10 M, including 5-HT2A receptors, DAT, Ca2+ channels, Na+ 
channels, Kv channels, and monoamino oxidase (MAO) (21–23). 
In addition, 9-trans-THC inhibited 5-HT transporter (SERT) and 
norepinephrine transporter (NAT) at concentrations <1 M (21, 22). 
To directly compare cis-PET and 9-trans-THC, the latter was also 
assessed in the screening panel of 44 CNS targets at 1 M (Fig. 6). 
The results indicate specific binding to CB1R (95%) and CB2R (90%), 
with only minor effects on CCK1 (40%), DAT (22%), and histamine 
1 receptor (H1; 20%). Neither 9-trans-THC nor cis-PET inhibited 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at physiological concentrations (Fig. 6 
and fig. S5).
DISCUSSION
The isolation of the liverwort-derived bibenzyl cannabinoid cis-PET 
was first reported in 1994 (5), although in 1988, Crombie and co- 
workers already predicted cis-PET as a natural product (24). Possibly 
because of a lack of isolated pure substance, no research was con-
ducted on its biological activity. In recent years, reports on Radula 
as legal high have accumulated. Our study shows that cis-PET is a 
moderately potent but efficacious psychoactive cannabinoid identi-
fied outside the Cannabis genus, in agreement with the reported 
recreational use of R. marginata, which is endemic to New Zealand 
and Tasmania. Like 9-trans-THC, cis-PET occurs in the plant as 
acid (5, 6), which is progressively decarboxylated upon drying or 
smoking. Dried R. marginata collected in the wild is currently sold 
in the internet as legal high, making reference to cis-PET being 
structurally similar to THC (see Acknowledgments). The online 
community reporting about legal highs both affirms and refutes 
the anecdotes regarding the cannabis-like effects of smoked 
R. marginata. Given the uncertain amounts of cis-PET in the purchas-
able preparations and the lack of information regarding the pharma-
cology of cis-PET, we synthesized both PET diastereoisomers and 
tested them in vitro and in mice. We show that cis-PET is readily 
bioavailable to the brain in mice (Kp value of 0.91) and selectively 
binds to CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R at 
nanomolar concentrations in vitro, without affecting the other com-
ponents of the ECS and 44 CNS targets including GPCRs, ion channels, 
nuclear receptors, membrane transporters, and enzymes. In vivo, 
cis-PET induced analgesia, catalepsy, hypolocomotion, and hypo-
thermia (collectively called tetrad) in a CB1R-dependent manner 
similarly to 9-trans-THC. As in the case of the THC scaffold, the 
cis-PET isomer is a less potent CB1R partial agonist than the trans-
PET. Unexpectedly, the PET diastereoisomers differed pharmaco-
logically from 9-trans-THC as it significantly reduced basal PGD2 
and E2 levels in the brain in a CB1R-dependent manner, potentially 
limiting its adverse effects (20) and reducing neuroinflammation 
(19, 25). The interplay between CB1R activation by cannabinoids

and modulation of PGE2 has been emphasized previously. Activa-
tion of CB1R by 9-trans-THC and CP55,940 was shown to induce 
COX-2 expression in different cell types, including neurons and 
astrocytes (20, 26, 27). Chen and colleagues (20) reported that 
9-trans-THC acutely increases COX-2 expression in the brain in a 
CB1R-dependent mechanism by specifically recruiting a G subunit– 
mediated intracellular signaling, while 2-AG led to CB1R-dependent 
COX-2 suppression via the Gi subunit. Moreover, in vivo, 9-
trans-THC (10 mg/kg) strongly increased basal PGE2 levels in the 
hippocampal region, giving rise to central adverse effects (20). 
Using the same dose of 9-trans-THC, in our experiments we could 
not detect a significant change of basal PGD2 and PGE2 levels in 
mouse whole brain (Fig. 5, E and F). Conversely, PET diastereomers 
specifically reduced basal PGD2 and PGE2 levels without affecting 
COX-2 activity. It remains to be determined whether PET recruits 
the CB1R-mediated transduction pathways reported for 2-AG, which 
also reduces basal prostaglandin levels (19, 28). Recent studies have 
provided strong evidence that low-dose 9-trans-THC treatment 
may still be beneficial with reduced central side effects (29, 30). 
Thus, the less potent PET diastereoisomers showing additional ef-
fects on brain prostaglandin levels exhibit pharmacological charac-
teristics of potential medical phytocannabinoids. The inhibition of 
constitutive prostaglandin production is not associated with toxic 
effects in the brain, while in the periphery, it may induce an impair-
ment of the renal plasma flow, possibly leading to kidney injury 
(31–33). Although the moderate but significant inhibition of brain 
prostaglandin levels induced by cis-PET is not comparable to the 
pharmacological blockage of COX-2 activity elicited by nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs, the reduction of brain prostaglandins 
may contribute to the neuropharmacology of this new cannabinoid 
(20). Our data also provide additional important information about 
the functional consequences of 9-THC side-chain modifications 
(34, 35). Using stereodivergent total synthesis, after more than 20 years 
from the first report of cis-PET, this study finally uncovers the un-
derlying molecular mechanism of action. This gives a rationale for 
the recreational use of Radula liverworts and provides a molecular 
basis on which to assess the prospective toxicity and usefulness of 
the plant material.
Moreover, the findings on the pharmacological effects of cis-PET 
provide a marked example of convergent evolution of bioactive plant 
secondary metabolites in the plant kingdom. Despite the existence 
of more than 20,000 bryophyte species globally, cis-PET is the first 
psychoactive constituent in this group of plants. Recently, putative 
genes involved in the biosynthesis of cis-PET were described (8). 
The abuse potential of Radula species is probably low, given the 
relatively moderate potency and low abundance of cis-PET (0.7 to 
7% in an extract) (5, 6) as compared with marijuana, with 9-trans-
THC contents typically higher than 10% (36). Nevertheless, cis-PET 
could be an interesting lead for drug development as it might have 
fewer side effects than 9-trans-THC and reduces prostaglandins. 
The likely relevance of signaling-specific CB1R pathways (37), in 
particular related to the reduced prostaglandin biosynthesis observed 
with the bibenzyl PET scaffold, will need to be studied in preclinical 
disease models.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
General
Unless otherwise noted, all reactions were carried out under an am-
bient atmosphere, and all reagents were purchased from commercial 
suppliers and used without further purification. The amine catalysts 
(S)-,-bis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2-pyrrolidinemethanol 
trimethylsilyl ether and (R)-,-bis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)
phenyl]-2-pyrrolidinemethanol trimethylsilyl ether were purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich. The (R)-enantiomer was received as an off-
white solid and was therefore purified by column chromatography 
before use to give a white solid. [Ir(cod)Cl]2 (97%) was purchased 
from Combi-Blocks Inc. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) 
was performed on Merck silica gel 60 F254 TLC glass plates and 
visualized with 254-nm light and potassium permanganate or See-
bach’s “magic” staining solutions followed by heating. Purification 
of reaction products was carried out by flash chromatography using 
Sigma-Aldrich silica gel, 60 Å, 230 to 400 mesh under 0.3 to 0.5 bar 
pressure. The ligands (S)-L and achiral rac-L were prepared follow-
ing known procedures (13, 38). Aldehyde 2 was prepared by pub-
lished procedures (13, 39). 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 400-MHz spectrometer and 
are reported in parts per million (ppm), with the solvent resonance 
used as the internal standard (CHCl3 at 7.26 ppm). Peaks are re-
ported as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, or 
m = multiplet, coupling constant(s) in Hz, integration. 13C NMR 
spectra were recorded with 1H decoupling on a Bruker AV 101-MHz 
or Bruker AV 151-MHz spectrometer and are reported in parts per 
million, with the solvent resonance used as the internal standard 
(CDCl3 at 77.16 ppm). Peaks are reported as follows: s = singlet, d = 
doublet, coupling constant(s) in Hz. 19F NMR spectra were recorded 
with 1H decoupling on a Bruker AV 377-MHz or Bruker AV 471-
MHz spectrometer and are reported in parts per million. Peaks are 
reported as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, coupling constant(s) in 
Hz. Unless otherwise noted, all NMR measurements were conducted 
at room temperature. NMR service measurements were obtained at 
the NMR spectrometry service operated by the Laboratory of Organic 
Chemistry at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETHZ). 
Infrared spectra were measured neat on a PerkinElmer UATR Two 
Spectrometer. The peaks are reported as absorption maxima (n, cm−1). 
High-resolution mass spectral data were obtained at the MS service 
operated by the Laboratory of Organic Chemistry at the ETHZ on a 
Micromass (Waters) AutoSpec Ultima–EI-Sector-MS (EI), Bruker 
maXis–ESI-Qq-TOF-MS (ESI), or Bruker solariX–MALDI- 
FTICR-
MS (Dual MALDI/ESI) and are reported as mass/charge ratio (m/z). 
Enantiomeric excesses were determined on a Waters ACQUITY 
UltraPerformance Convergence Chromatography supercritical fluid 
chromatography (SFC) system using a chiral stationary phase DAICEL 
CHIRALCEL OJ-H (3 m, 4.6 mm by 150 mm). Optical rotations 
were measured with a JASCO P-2000 Polarimeter (10 cm, 1-ml cell).

(progesterone-2,2,4,6,6,17,21,21,21-d9), and corticosterone (11,21- 
dihydroxy-pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) were obtained from Cayman 
Chemicals Europe (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Guanosine triphosphate 
(GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) were purchased from Sigma 
(St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Rimonabant (SR141716A, SR1) with 
a purity >98% was ordered from Pharmaserv AG, Switzerland. 
(−)-9-cis-THC and (−)-9-trans-THC were synthesized and pre-
pared with a purity >95% as previously reported (see the Supple-
mentary Materials for NMR spectra) (13).
Radioligand binding assays on cannabinoid receptors
The assay was performed as previously described (40). Briefly, 15 g 
of membrane preparation obtained from CHO cells stably trans-
fected with hCB1 or hCB2 receptors were resuspended in 300 l of 
binding buffer [50 mM tris-HCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 
fatty acid–free bovine serum albumin (BSA; 0.5 mg/ml) (pH 7.4)] in 
silanized glass tubes and coincubated with the tested compounds at 
different concentrations (1 pM to 100 M) or vehicle and 0.5 nM 
[3H]CP55,940 (168 Ci/mmol) for 1.5 hours at 30°C. Nonspecific 
binding of the radioligand was determined in the presence of 10 M 
WIN55,512. After the incubation time, membrane suspensions were 
rapidly filtered through a 0.5% polyethyleneimine presoaked 96-
well microplate bonded with GF/B glass fiber filters (UniFilter-96 
GF/B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under vacuum and washed 12 times 
with 150 l of ice-cold washing buffer. Filters were added to 45 l of 
MicroScint-20 scintillation liquid, and radioactivity was measured 
with the 1450 MicroBeta Trilux top counter. Data were collected 
from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate, 
and the nonspecific binding was subtracted. Results were expressed 
as [3H]CP55,940 bound as percentage of binding in vehicle-treated 
samples, and Ki (inhibition constant) values were calculated apply-
ing the Cheng-Prusoff equation.
[35S]GTPS binding assay
The assay was performed as previously described (40). Briefly, 5 g 
of clean membrane prepared in-house from CHO-hCB2 and CHO-
hCB1 cells was diluted in silanized plastic tubes with 200 l of GTPS 
binding buffer [50 mM tris-HCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 
and 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5% of fatty acid–
free BSA] in the presence of 10 M GDP and 0.1 nM [35S]GTPS 
(1250 Ci/mmol). The mixture was kept on ice until the binding re-
action was started by adding the tested compound, vehicle (negative 
control), or CP55,940 (positive control). Nonspecific binding was 
measured in the presence of 10 M GTPS (Sigma). The tubes were 
incubated at 30°C for 90 min under shaking, and then, they were 
put on ice to stop the reaction. An aliquot (185 l) of the reaction 
mixture was rapidly filtered through a 96-well microplate bonded 
with GF/B glass fiber filters (UniFilter-96 GF/B, PerkinElmer Life 
Sciences) previously presoaked with ice-cold washing buffer [50 mM

tris-HCl (pH 7.4) plus of 0.1% fatty acid–free BSA]. The filters were 
washed six times with 180 l of washing buffer under vacuum and 
dried under the air drier flow. The radioactivity was measured with 
the 1450 Microbeta WallacTrilux Top counter after the addition of 
45 l of scintillation cocktail. Specific binding was calculated by 
subtracting the residual radioactivity signal obtained in presence of 
an excess of GTPS, and the results were expressed as percentage of 
vehicle control.
Enzyme inhibition assays for FAAH, MAGL, ABHD6,  
ABHD12, and COX-2
The enzyme inhibition assays were performed as previously pub-
lished (40). Briefly, for AEA and 2-OG hydrolysis, different concen-
trations of cis-PET, trans-PET, and 9-trans-THC were preincubated 
with 200 g of pig brain homogenate in tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) 
supplemented with 0.1% of fatty acid–free BSA for 20 min at 
37°C. Then, 0.1 M AEA or 1 M 2-OG containing trace amounts 
of [ethanolamine-1-3H]-AEA (1 nM) or [glycerol-1,2,3-3H]-2-OG 
(1 nM), respectively, were incubated with the mixtures for another 
15 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding two volumes of 
ice-cold CHCl3:MetOH mixture (1:1) and centrifuged at 16,000g for 
10 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was collected, and the radioactiv-
ity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. hABHD6 and 
hABHD12 activity was determined using cell homogenates from 
hABHD6 and hABHD12 stably transfected human embryonic kidney 
(HEK) 293 cells. Different concentrations of cis-PET, trans-PET, 
and 9-trans-THC were preincubated with 40 g of cell homoge-
nate for 30 min at 37°C in assay buffer [1 mM tris, 10 mM EDTA, 
and 0.1% BSA (pH 7.6)]. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as 
vehicle control, and 10 M WWL70 or 20 M tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) 
as positive controls. Then, 10 M 2-OG was added and incubated 
for 5 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 l 
of ice-cold CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). The samples were vortexed and 
centrifuged (16,000g, 10 min, 4°C). Aliquots (200 l) of the aqueous 
phase were assayed for tritium content by liquid scintillation spectros-
copy. Blank values were recovered from tubes containing no enzyme. 
Basal 2-OG hydrolysis occurring in nontransfected HEK293 cells was 
subtracted. Inhibition of human recombinant COX-2 was assessed 
using an in-house validated COX fluorescent inhibitor screening assay 
kit from Cayman Chemical Europe as previously described (40).
In vitro pharmacological screening
cis-PET and 9-trans-THC were profiled in a Cerep (Eurofins Pharma 
Discovery Services) screening panel of 44 targets including GPCRs, 
ion channels, nuclear receptors, membrane transporters, and en-
zymes mostly expressed in the CNS. cis-PET was tested at 1 and 
10 M, while 9-trans-THC was tested only at 1 M. Data pre-
sented were obtained from two independent experiments each 
performed in duplicate. The GPCRs tested were as follows: 1A 
adrenergic receptor, 2A adrenergic receptor, 2B adrenergic receptor, 
1 adrenergic receptor, 2 adrenergic receptor, CB1R, CB2R, D1 do-
pamine receptor type 1, D2 dopamine receptor type 2, H1 histamine 
receptor type 1, H2 histamine receptor type 2, delta-type opioid 
receptor, mu-type opioid receptor, kappa-type opioid receptor, 
5-HT1A serotonin receptor, 5-HT1B serotonin receptor, 5-HT2A 
serotonin receptor, 5-HT2B serotonin receptor, 5-HT3 serotonin 
receptor, M1 muscarinic receptor, M2 muscarinic receptor, M3 
muscarinic receptor, A2A adenosine receptor, ETA endothelin re-
ceptor, CCK1 cholecystokinin A receptor, and V1A vasopressin/
oxytocin receptor. Ion channels were as follows: GABAA channel 
at the benzodiazepine (BZD), 4/2 acetylcholine ion channel, 
Cav1.2 (l-type) calcium ion channel (dihydropyridine site), Kv 
voltage-gated potassium ion channel, Na+ voltage-gated sodium 
channel, human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium 
channels, N-methyl-d-aspartate (glutamate) receptor. Nuclear re-
ceptors were as follows: androgen receptor and glucocorticoid 
receptor. Enzymes were as follows: MAO-A, acetylcholinesterase, 
lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase phosphodiesterase 
3A, phosphodiesterase 4D2, COX-1, and COX-2. Membrane neu-
rotransmitter transporters were as follows: noradrenaline trans-
porter, DAT, and serotonin transporter.
Animals
In vivo experiments were performed in accordance with the Swiss 
Federal guidelines, which agree with the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. Male BALB/c mice (8 to 
10 weeks old) were provided by Janvier Labs (St Berthevin, France). 
Mice were housed in groups of five per cage in a specific pathogen–
free unit under controlled 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle (ambi-
ent temperature, 21° ± 2°C; humidity, 40 to 50%) with free access to 
standard rodent chow and water. The mice were acclimatized to the 
animal house for 1 week before the experiments.
Tetrad test
Compounds were dissolved in pure DMSO and administered intra-
peritoneally at different doses using five to eight mice for each treatment 
group. cis-PET, trans-PET, and 9-trans-THC were administered 
1 hour before assessing locomotion, catalepsy, body temperature, 
and analgesia (collectively referred as tetrad test). The rectal tem-
perature was measured before (basal) and 1 hour after injection with 
a thermocouple probe (1 to 2 cm; Testo AG, Switzerland), and the 
change in rectal temperature was expressed as the difference be-
tween basal and postinjection temperatures. Catalepsy was mea-
sured using the bar test, where mice were retained in an imposed 
position with forelimbs resting on a bar 4 cm high; the end point of 
catalepsy was considered when both front limbs were removed or 
remained over 120 s. Locomotion was determined using the rotarod 
test; animals were placed on the rotarod (Ugo Basile, Italy) at 6 rpm, 
and the latency to fall was measured with a cutoff time of 120 s. 
Catalepsy and locomotion were measured in three trials. The hot 
plate test was performed to evaluate analgesia using a 54° to 56°C 
hot plate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) with a 
Plexiglas cylinder. The latency to the first nociceptive response (paw 
lick or foot shake) was measured.
LC-MS/MS quantifications of PET, THC, AEA, 2-AG, PEA, LEA, OEA, 
AA, PGD2, and PGE2 in mouse brain tissue
LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu UFLC coupled 
to a TripleQuad 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (ABSciex Con-
cord, Ontario, Canada). AEA, 2-AG, OEA, PEA, LEA, AA, PGE2, and 
PGD2 were quantified in mouse brains using our recently published 
method (40). For the analysis of cis-PET, trans-PET, and 9-trans-
THC, a Reprosil Fluosil 100 PFP (particle size, 3 m; 2 mm by 
50 mm; Dr. A. Maisch, Germany) column was used in reversed- 
phase mode with gradient elution starting with 95% of phase A 
(0.1% formic acid and 2 mM ammonium acetate in water) and 5% 
of phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The amount of phase 
B was linearly increased to 40% at 3 min, then to 58% at 8 min and 
kept for 1 min, and then increased linearly again to 80% at 10 min;

the column was flushed for 3.5 min with 99% of phase B with sub-
sequent reequilibration at 5% for a further 3 min. The total analysis 
time was 17 min at 40°C, the flow rate was 0.3 ml/min, and the in-
jection volume was 10 l. These LC conditions provided the chro-
matographic resolution of cis- and trans-PET prior to MS/MS (see 
fig. S6 for the chromatogram), where both isomers ([M+H+] of 349 m/z) 
showed the same fragmentation pattern (m/z = 293, 267, 227). The 
TurboIon Spray interface was operated in positive mode. The MS 
parameters of the ESI source were as follows: capillary voltage, 
4.5 kV; temperature, 600°C; nebulizer pressure, 50 psi. Peaks were 
integrated using the Analyst software version 1.5 (AB Sciex Concord, 
Ontario, Canada). Because of the lack of a deuterated version for 
interested molecules and the chemical similarity between 9-trans-
THC and both PET isomers, we used 9-trans-THC as internal stan-
dard (IS) for cis- and trans-PET, whereas cis-PET was used as IS for 
9-trans-THC. The ratio of peak area of analyte to peak area of IS 
was used to ensure linearity of the calibrations. The slope, intercept, 
and regression coefficient of those calibration lines were determined. 
The concentrations of PET diastereosimoners and 9-trans-THC 
in the brain and plasma were calculated applying a model previously 
described (40). The ratios between brain and plasma concentrations 
(Kp) of 9-trans-THC, cis-PET, and trans-PET were calculated as 
previously reported (40).
Sample preparation
Mouse brains were divided into two sagittal hemispheres, and one 
hemisphere was used for LC-MS/MS analyses. Half brains were 
weighted when still frozen and transferred to 2-ml microcentrifuge 
vials (XXTuff Microvials, BioSpec, Oklahoma, USA) with three 
chrome-steel beads (diameter, 2.3 mm; BioSpec, Oklahoma, USA) 
and 1.5 ml of 0.1 M formic acid. Samples were homogenized using 
a 24-position Mini bead beater (BioSpec Products Inc., Bartlesville, 
OK, USA) for the extraction of administered molecules (cis-PET, 
trans-PET, and 9-trans-THC), as well as for endogenous molecules 
AEA, 2-AG, PEA, OEA, LEA, PGE2, PGD2, AA, corticosterone, and 
progesterone using a previously described extraction protocol (40). 
For the quantification of cis-PET, trans-PET, and 9-trans-THC, a 
different extraction method was used. Briefly, 200 l of brain homo-
genate or plasma was rapidly transferred to a silanized Eppendorf 
tube containing 400 l of acetone and 400 ng/ml of the designed 
internal standard. Samples were centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 10 min 
at 4°C to precipitate proteins, and the supernatant was further ex-
tracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate:hexane (9:1) 0.1% formic acid 
strongly vortexed for 30 s and sonicated (Sonicator Merck-Gruppe) 
in a cold bath for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 
10 min at 4°C and kept for 1 hour at −20°C to freeze the lower aque-
ous phase. The upper organic phase was recovered in plastic tubes 
and dried into a speed vacuum. The extracts were reconstituted in 
50 l of acetonitrile with 20% of water, and 10 l was injected in the 
LC-MS/MS system.
Statistical analyses
Data were collected from at least three independent experiments 
each performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as mean values 
and standard error deviation. The statistical significance difference 
among groups was determined by the Student’s t test (paired, one-
tailed, or two-tailed t test) or one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s 
post hoc test. Statistical differences between the treated and con-
trol groups were considered as significant if p ≤ 0.05. GraphPad 5.0 
software was used to fit the concentration-dependent curves and for 
the statistical analysis.
