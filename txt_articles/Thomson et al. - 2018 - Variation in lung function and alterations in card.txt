Abstract
Background
Reduced lung function is common and associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality, even in asymptomatic individuals without diagnosed respiratory disease.
Previous studies have identified relationships between lung function and cardiovascular
structure in individuals with pulmonary disease, but the relationships in those free from diag-
nosed cardiorespiratory disease have not been fully explored.
Methods
UK Biobank is a prospective cohort study of community participants in the United Kingdom.
Individuals self-reported demographics and co-morbidities, and a subset underwent cardio-
vascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and spirometry. CMR images were analysed
to derive ventricular volumes and mass. The relationships between CMR-derived measures
and spirometry and age were modelled with multivariable linear regression, taking account
of the effects of possible confounders.
Results
Data were available for 4,975 individuals, and after exclusion of those with pre-existing
cardiorespiratory disease and unacceptable spirometry, 1,406 were included in the analy-
ses. In fully-adjusted multivariable linear models lower FEV1 and FVC were associated with
smaller left ventricular end-diastolic (−5.21ml per standard deviation (SD) change in FEV1,
−5.69ml per SD change in FVC), end-systolic (−2.34ml, −2.56ml) and stroke volumes

 (−2.85ml, −3.11ml); right ventricular end-diastolic (−5.62ml, −5.84ml), end-systolic
(−2.47ml, −2.46ml) and stroke volumes (−3.13ml, −3.36ml); and with lower left ventricular
mass (−2.29g, −2.46g). Changes of comparable magnitude and direction were observed
per decade increase in age.
Conclusions
This study shows that reduced FEV1 and FVC are associated with smaller ventricular vol-
umes and reduced ventricular mass. The changes seen per standard deviation change in
FEV1 and FVC are comparable to one decade of ageing.
Introduction
Respiratory disease is common and under-diagnosed, and a significant and growing cause of
death and disability[1]. Much of the excess morbidity and mortality is secondary to cardiovas-
cular disease[2]. In a prospective cohort study of 7,575 patients with chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD) from Saskatchewan, Canada[3], the quintile of patients with the most
severe COPD had relative risks between 1.4 and 3.1 for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
mortality, congestive heart failure, and angina.
Lung function is independently associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
[4,5], both in individuals with established respiratory disease and in those without any diagno-
sis or symptoms. In a prospective study of 15,000 individuals in the west of Scotland[6], those
in the lowest quintile for forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1) had an all-cause
mortality almost twice that of the highest quintile. The risks were similar in asymptomatic
(subclinical) individuals.
The prevalence of subclinical impaired lung function is great: in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and NHANES III cohort studies of community
volunteers in the United States[7] around 12–13% of individuals had an FEV1 to forced vital
capacity (FVC) ratio less than 0.7, the generally accepted cut-off for obstructive lung disease
[8]. Almost three quarters of these individuals did not have a diagnosis of lung disease, and
most of the undiagnosed individuals reported good or excellent health. Mortality was higher
in those with abnormal spirometry, irrespective of the presence of diagnosed lung disease.
Previous work has explored some of the relationships between lung disease and cardiovas-
cular structure. Using data from the MESA cohort, Grau and colleagues[9] demonstrated that
increasing emphysema severity, quantified with thoracic computed tomography, is associated
with lower right ventricular volumes and mass. They also found that right ventricular mass is
associated with the FEV1 to FVC ratio. Barr et al.[10] continued this analysis to identify similar
relationships between emphysema severity and left ventricular volumes and mass, and between
the FEV1 to FVC ratio and left ventricular end-diastolic and stroke volumes. These analyses
were conducted in an all-comers population, many of whom had existing cardiovascular and
respiratory disease. Furthermore, the effects of FEV1 and FVC per se were not studied. Given
the prevalence of subclinical changes in lung function, together with the associations with
adverse outcomes, we set out to explore the relationships between lung function and cardio-
vascular structure and function in a population free from diagnosed cardiovascular and respi-
ratory disease.

 Methods
UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort study of approximately 500,000 unselected commu-
nity volunteers aged 40 to 69 at the time of enrolment, living in the United Kingdom. The
design and conduct of the study have been described in detail previously[11]. This study was
covered by the general ethical approval for UK Biobank studies from the NHS National
Research Ethics Service on 17th June 2011 (Ref 11/NW/0382). None of the authors had direct
contact with the study participants. This report is a cross-sectional analysis of the subset of par-
ticipants who took part in the imaging pilot programme.
Demographics and doctor-diagnosed co-morbidities were self-reported by electronic ques-
tionnaire and interview with a healthcare professional. Data collected during the imaging visit
were used in the analyses, except where unavailable, in which case data from the enrolment
visit were used. If a participant did not answer a question regarding a comorbid diagnosis, or
did not know, it was assumed they did not have the condition. Physical measurements (height,
weight, blood pressure, heart rate) and smoking status were captured exclusively at the time of
imaging.
Smokers were defined as individuals who smoke, or used to smoke, on all or most days.
Those who smoked occasionally were deemed to be never smokers. For current or previous
smokers, pack year history was calculated as the product of the number of packs of cigarettes
smoked per day and the difference between age started smoking and age stopped smoking (or
age at imaging for current smokers).
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance
A subgroup of participants is undergoing cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).
The CMR acquisition protocol and post-processing have been described previously[12]. In
brief, participants underwent imaging using a 1.5 Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Aera scanner
(Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) at a central imaging centre. Short and long
axis cine images were acquired using a balanced steady state free precession sequence. Manual
image analysis was performed across two core imaging centres using cvi42 version 5.1.1 (Circle
Cardiovascular Imaging, Calgary, Canada) by observers blinded to all clinical information.
The software used these contours to calculate right and left ventricular end-diastolic, end-
systolic, and stroke volumes; right and left ventricular ejection fraction; and left ventricular
mass. The manual image analysis and quality control, including assessment of intra- and inter-
observer variability, have been described in detail previously[13].
Spirometry
Spirometry without bronchodilator administration was performed at the time of imaging
according to a standard protocol using a Vitalograph Pneumotrac 6800 spirometer [14]. Each
participant produced two blows, and a third if there was unacceptable variance in the first two
(as calculated by the spirometer). The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced
vital capacity (FVC), and an automated assessment of measurement quality were recorded.
Spirometry blows were excluded from the analysis if the automated quality assessment was
anything other than ‘acceptable’. Participants were excluded if they had fewer than two accept-
able blows, if the coefficient of variation for the two or three acceptable blows exceeded 5%, or
if the difference between the best and second best acceptable blow exceeded 150ml, in accor-
dance with established guidelines[8]. To investigate the potential impact of these exclusion cri-
teria on the results we performed a sensitivity analysis in which all participants with at least
two ‘acceptable’ spirometry blows were included, without any limit on the permissible range

 or coefficient of variation between blows. The results of this sensitivity analysis are presented
in S2 File. Obstructive spirometry was defined as an FEV1 to FVC ratio less than 0.7.
Statistical analysis
The CMR-derived parameters and FEV1 and FVC were approximately normally distributed
and the assumptions for linear regression were satisfied. FEV1 and FVC were standardised to
the mean (FEV1 mean 2.87 litres, SD 0.70 litres; FVC mean 3.73 litres, SD 0.89 litres).
The relationships between nine CMR-derived parameters and both FVC and FEV1 were
modelled with multivariable linear regression, using age, sex, ethnicity, height, weight, systolic
blood pressure, resting heart rate, Townsend deprivation index (a commonly used measure of
material deprivation where positive values represent above-average deprivation and negative
values below-average deprivation), education level (categorised as the presence or absence of a
degree or professional qualification), regular alcohol consumption (defined as three or more
occasions per week), smoking history (pack years) and any diagnosis of hypertension or diabe-
tes as co-variates. Height and weight were included as covariates in the regression models,
rather than indexing the dependent variables to body surface area, since the use of ratios in
regression analysis is liable to spurious results and misinterpretation[15,16]. The approach
adopted ensures all variables in the model are appropriately adjusted for body composition.
To place the effects of spirometry on CMR-derived parameters in context, the relationships
between the CMR-derived parameters and age were modelled in a similar fashion, except that
both FEV1 and FVC were used as co-variates. Interaction terms were used to explore any strat-
ification by sex in the relationships between the CMR-derived parameters and the primary
exposure variable (FEV1, FVC, or age) in each regression model.
Each regression analysis was performed on a complete-case basis without imputation of
missing data. Nine of thirteen covariates had no missing data, and the covariate with most
missing data (alcohol consumption) lacked fewer than one percent of observations. The out-
come variables (CMR-derived parameters) had fewer than two percent missing observations,
which were clustered in 22 participants who were missing all the outcome variables and
another one who was missing right ventricular parameters.
Regression coefficients are presented as the change in the CMR-derived parameter per stan-
dard deviation change in FEV1 or FVC, or per decade change in age. P values were calculated
using Student’s t test or ANOVA for continuous variables and Chi-squared test for categorical
variables. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.3.2[17].
Results
1,221 individuals were excluded on account of pre-existing cardiorespiratory disease, the defi-
nition of which is provided in S1 File. Of the remaining 3,754 individuals, a further 2,348 were
excluded in the primary analysis because they did not meet the criteria for reproducible and
acceptable spirometry. The case selection process for the primary analysis is shown in Fig 1.
1,406 participants were included in the primary analysis. On account of missing data, the
number of observations in the regression models was 1,366 or 1,367 depending on the CMR-
derived parameter being studied. Baseline characteristics, stratified by tertile of FEV1, are
described in Table 1. Compared to those in the highest tertile, those in the lowest tertile of
FEV1 were older, more likely to be female, shorter, lighter, had lower diastolic blood pressure
and higher resting heart rates, and were more likely to have obstructive spirometry.
Following adjustment for potential confounders in a multivariable linear model, lower
FEV1 and FVC were associated with smaller left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume, LV
end-systolic volume, LV stroke volume, right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume, RV end-

 systolic volume, RV stroke volume, and LV mass (Table 2). The interaction terms between the
primary exposure variables and sex were not statistically significant and thus there were no dif-
ferences in the observed relationships between males and females. The linear relationships
between CMR-derived parameters and FEV1 and FVC are shown in the S1 and S2 Figs,
respectively.
In a similar multivariable linear model, increasing age was associated with smaller LV end-
diastolic volume (−3.96ml, −6.01ml to −1.92ml), LV end-systolic volume (−1.52ml, −2.86ml
to −0.17ml, LV stroke volume (−2.47ml, −3.73ml to −1.20ml), RV end-diastolic volume
(−5.30ml, −7.49ml to −3.11ml), RV end-systolic volume (−3.03ml, −4.47ml to −1.59ml), and
RV stroke volume (−2.30ml, −3.57ml to −1.03ml) (Table 3). Values represent the mean and
lower and upper 95% confidence intervals for the change in CMR-derived parameter per

fraction. Age did not influence left ventricular mass. The relative effect sizes of FEV1, FVC,
and age on CMR-derived parameters are shown in Fig 2.
In a sensitivity analysis employing a broader definition of acceptable spirometry (at least
two ‘acceptable’ blows with no restriction on the range or coefficient of variation of these
blows) 2,070 individuals met the criteria for inclusion. There were minimal changes to the

Discussion
The key finding of our study is that in a large cohort of individuals without prior diagnosis of
cardiorespiratory disease, lower lung function is associated with smaller left and right ventricu-
lar end-systolic, end-diastolic, and stroke volumes; and with lower left ventricular mass. These
relationships are independent of other variables known to affect cardiac structure. There was
no association with ejection fraction.
The results of our study confirm and expand on previous work. The Multi Ethnic Study
of Atherosclerosis (MESA) lung substudy has previously identified relationships between
emphysema severity, quantified by thoracic computed tomography, and right and left ven-
tricular volumes and mass[9,10,18], although the consistency of the relationships varied
between analyses, and many of the patients had diagnoses of cardiovascular and respiratory
disease. In the same cohort, reduced FEV1 to FVC ratio was associated with LV end-diastolic
volume and LV stroke volume[10], and with RV mass[9] although associations with FEV1
and FVC per se were not studied. Using echocardiography, Watz and colleagues[19] showed
that LV end-diastolic diameter and RV diameter are associated with FEV1. Our study
extends these previous findings to a cohort without diagnosed heart or lung disease, and
demonstrates consistent relationships between spirometry and multiple measures of left and
right ventricular structure and function. The effect sizes seen in this study (2.29ml to 5.84ml
per standard deviation change in FEV1 or FVC) are comparable to those seen in MESA[10]
and in echocardiographic studies[19]. Furthermore, they are comparable in size to the effects
of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and diabetes, all widely accepted drivers of ventricu-
lar remodelling[20].
Age is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality[21,22], and is
associated with the development of ventricular fibrosis, remodelling, and diastolic dysfunction
[23]. Previous investigations have explored the relationship between age and ventricular struc-
ture and function. Analysis of a subset of the UK Biobank CMR study, free from all reported

 comorbid disease[13] showed a statistically significant negative correlation between age and
LV and RV end-diastolic, end-systolic, and stroke volumes; and LV mass. Similar relationships
were found using the MESA dataset[24,25], and in the current study population.
In the current study, the variation in ventricular volumes and mass seen with lower FEV1
and FVC is comparable to that seen with ageing. Notably, the changes in CMR-derived
parameters per standard deviation of FEV1 and FVC are approximately the same as those
seen with one decade of ageing. This suggests lower lung function is associated with a ‘pre-
mature ageing’ effect on the ventricle. This provides potential insight into the mechanisms
responsible for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in those with deranged lung function, and

 highlights the potential importance of measuring lung function as a marker of cardiovascular
‘ageing’ and risk.
Our analysis did not identify any relationship between ejection fraction and FEV1, FVC, or
age, despite the significant influence of these factors on other measures of ventricular function.
Similar results were found in a MESA analysis of individuals with emphysema[10]. Our results
add to the evidence that ejection fraction alone is an insensitive marker of cardiac function
and remodelling, particularly as it relates to respiratory function.
This study has several limitations. The design of UK Biobank renders it liable to selection
bias, and it is likely that the population recruited to the study is not completely representative
of the population as a whole. The self-reporting of co-morbidities and lifestyle factors such as
smoking is liable to ascertainment bias. The relatively low prevalence of smoking observed in
our study population may be explained, at least in part, by these two factors.
Many participants were excluded from the analysis as their spirometry did not meet con-
ventional criteria for reproducibility and validity. It is possible that the variability in spirome-
try arose from its acquisition in the non-specialist UK Biobank assessment centre, rather than
in a dedicated pulmonary function laboratory. Furthermore, the study protocol limited partici-
pants to producing three blows, rather than repeating the measurement until valid and repro-
ducible results were achieved, as is commonly done in clinical practice. Nonetheless, even after
individuals with unacceptable variation had been excluded the full range of FEV1 and FVC
were represented, and thus the ability to examine relationships between these parameters and
cardiac structure was preserved. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis revealed that exclusion
of these individuals did not materially affect the results, and suggests that no significant selec-
tion bias was introduced by the exclusion of individuals with unacceptable spirometry. The
inclusion only of individuals with reproducible, high quality spirometry increases the confi-
dence in the relationships identified by this study.
This study raises a number of questions worthy of further analysis, including the long term
cardiovascular outcomes of individuals with subclinical changes in lung function, the changes
in cardiovascular phenotype over time in those with deranged spirometry, and evaluation of
ventricular fibrosis in participants with impaired lung function through T1 mapping. These
will be amenable to investigation as longitudinal follow-up and parametric mapping data
become available from UK Biobank.
Conclusions
In a large cohort of patients without known cardiorespiratory disease, lower FEV1 and FVC
are associated with smaller left and right ventricular volumes, and lower left ventricular mass.
The changes in ventricular structure per standard deviation fall in FVC and FEV1 are similar
to those seen with a one decade increase in age, and may shed light on the mechanisms under-
lying increased cardiovascular risk in those with subclinical changes in lung function, as well
as the importance of lung function as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
