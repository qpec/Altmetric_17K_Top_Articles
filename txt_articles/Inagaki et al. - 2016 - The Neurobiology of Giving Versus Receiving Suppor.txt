Abstract
Objectives—There is a strong association between supportive ties and health. However most 
research has focused on the health benefits that come from the support one receives while largely 
ignoring the support giver and how giving may contribute to good health. Moreover, few studies 
have examined the neural mechanisms associated with support giving or how giving support 
compares to receiving support.
Method—The current study assessed the relationships: 1) between self-reported receiving and 
giving social support and vulnerability for negative psychological outcomes and 2) between 
receiving and giving social support and neural activity to socially rewarding and stressful tasks. 
Thirty-six participants (M age=22.36, SD=3.78, 44% female) completed three tasks in the fMRI 
scanner: (1) a stress task (mental arithmetic under evaluative threat), (2) an affiliative task (viewing 
images of close others), and (3) a prosocial task.
Results—Both self-reported receiving and giving social support were associated with reduced 
vulnerability for negative psychological outcomes. However, across the three neuroimaging tasks, 
giving, but not receiving support was related to reduced stress-related activity (dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex, (r=−.27), left (r=−.28) and right anterior insula (r=−.33), and left (r=−.32) and 
right amygdala (r=−.32) to a stress task, greater reward-related activity (left (r=.42) and right 
ventral striatum (VS; r=.41) to an affiliative task, and greater caregiving-related activity (left VS 
(r=.31), right VS (r=.31), and septal area (r=.39) to a prosocial task.
Conclusion—These results contribute to an emerging literature suggesting that support giving is 
an overlooked contributor to how social support can benefit health.

 Social relationships are critical to health and well-being (1–3). Those without close ties fare 
poorly across a range of important outcomes (1,4,5) including mental and physical health 
(2–6), whereas those with more social ties show enhanced mental and physical health. To 
date, the research literature has focused on how “social support”—the perception or 
experience that one is loved and cared for by others, esteemed and valued, and part of a 
social network of mutual assistance and obligations (7)—relates to positive health outcomes. 
Since social support, by definition, focuses more on the consequences of receiving support, 
studies linking social support and health have largely focused on the support recipient while 
ignoring the individual giving support and care. Therefore the following study aimed to 
examine the associations between both receiving and giving support with: 1) vulnerability to 
negative psychological outcomes and 2) neural activity to stressful and socially rewarding 
tasks.
Since the 1970’s, studies have shown associations between supportive ties and reduced 
morbidity and mortality (8). Theories on social support suggest that these health benefits 
may come from the support we receive from others, which then helps to reduce stress 
responding (9–11). For example, undergoing stressful tasks with a friend present (vs. alone) 
leads to reduced cardiovascular responses to the stressors (12, see 13 for a review). In 
addition, self-reports of social support have been associated with reduced distress-related 
neural activity (in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)) to an experience of social 
rejection (14,15) and receiving support during a painful experience is associated with 
reduced pain-related neural activity (16,17). Though the benefits of receiving support are 
well established, receiving support can sometimes be ineffective, or in worst cases, backfire 
(e.g. 18,19). Therefore, it is possible that the support that one receives may not explain the 
relationship between social support and health in its entirety.
There has been increasing interest in the support giver, and the health benefits that may be 
accrued by giving to others. Thus, support giving, much like support receiving, is associated 
with a number of beneficial mental and physical health outcomes (20–24). Specifically, 
giving to others is associated with lower mortality rates over a 5-year period (20), fewer sick 
days (24), and reduced cardiovascular activity over a 24-hour period (22). The mechanisms 
leading to support giving’s beneficial effects may have evolved out of a caregiving system 
that helped nurture and support infants and others in need (25–30). In particular, giving to 
others may rely on distinct neural regions that serve to reinforce the caregiving behavior and 
are also involved in the regulation of stress responses (31,32).
In fact, it has been shown that the neural regions involved in maternal caregiving behavior in 
animals and the provision of social support in humans are also known for processing basic 
rewards; these include the ventral striatum (VS) and septal area (SA; 31,32). Moreover, 
these caregiving regions have inhibitory connections with regions known to be involved in 
threat and stress responding such as the amygdala (33,34). This activity in caregiving 
regions may dampen stress responding in order to facilitate adaptive care during times of 
stress, which over time may have health benefits. For example, giving support to a romantic 
partner in need (vs. not giving support) activated both the VS and SA (32). Furthermore, one 
of these regions, the SA, was negatively correlated with amygdala activity when participants 
gave support to their partners, suggesting that caregiving-related circuitry may help dampen

 stress responding. Indeed, in a separate study, giving support to a friend (vs. a control 
condition) led to reduced sympathetic-related responding to a laboratory-based stress task 
(21). Together, these findings suggest that giving to others may be stress-reducing on its own 
and therefore may be an overlooked contributor to the mental and physical health benefits of 
social support.
Still, little work has examined both receiving and giving support in terms of how they relate 
to stress-related neural activity. Furthermore, no studies have assessed social support and 
neural activity to positive, stress-free experiences. Hence, the current study examined the 
associations between both receiving support and giving support with neural activity in 
response to stressful and socially rewarding tasks. Specifically, we examined how both 
individual differences in receiving and giving support related to neural activity in response to 
a stress task, an affiliative task (in which participants viewed images of their close others), 
and a prosocial task.
There were two main goals. First, we examined whether self-reported support receiving 
related to negative psychological outcomes and neural activity to the three tasks. The current 
literature on receiving social support and health-related outcomes suggest that receiving 
social support is sometimes helpful, particularly at reducing stress, and sometimes not. 
Therefore, receiving support was hypothesized to be associated with less negative 
psychological outcomes, however, given the mixed findings in the literature, no directional 
hypotheses were made for the neural outcomes. Second, we examined the associations 
between self-reported support giving and negative psychological outcomes and neural 
activity to the three tasks. Based on emerging findings that giving to others might be good 
for health and relationships, support giving was hypothesized to be associated with less 
negative psychological outcomes, decreased stress-related activity to the stressful task, 
increased reward-related activity to viewing close others, and increased caregiving-related 
activity to the prosocial task.
Method
Participants
Forty-seven individuals participated as part of a larger study on the neural mechanisms 
associated with social support. The sample was then constrained to those who completed all 
3 neuroimaging tasks. A single outlier who was consistently greater than 3 SD’s away from 
the mean (both below and above) across multiple tasks was removed leaving a final sample 
of 36 participants (Table 1). The self-reported ethnic composition included 8.3% Black/
African American, 22.2% Latino/Chicano, 33.3% White, 30.6% Asian, and 5.6% Other. 
Procedures were run between June and October of 2014 in accordance with Institutional 
Review Board guidelines and all participants provided informed consent.
Self-report Measures
Support Receiving and Giving
Support receiving and giving was assessed with the 21-item 2-way social support scale (35). 
Questions are rated on a 0-not at all to 5-always scale with higher numbers indicating a

 greater amount of support received and given. Sample items to assess receiving support 
include: “when I am feeling down there is someone I can lean on,” and “I have someone to 
help me if I am physically unwell.” Giving support is evaluated by items such as: “I look for 
ways to cheer people up when they are feeling down,” and “I have helped someone with 
their responsibilities when they were unable to fulfill them.” Participants reported receiving 
more support than they gave (t(35)=8.26, p<.001). Reports of receiving support were also 
moderately associated with reports of support giving (r=.501, p=.002) suggesting that both 
forms of social support are related, but separate constructs.
Vulnerability Index
Since receiving social support has historically been associated with less stress, we examined 
the associations between self-reported receiving and giving social support and a broad array 
of negative psychological outcomes. A “vulnerability index” was created that included 
depression (Beck Depression Inventory,36), sensitivity to social rejection (Mehrabian 
Rejection Sensitivity,37), perceptions of stress (Perceived Stress Scale,38), and feelings of 
loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale,39). The scales were standardized to the same scale by 
converting the raw scores to z-scores. Scores were averaged to create a single value per 
participant (α=.82).
Neuroimaging Measures
The association between questionnaire measures of receiving and giving social support and 
neural activity was assessed across 3 separate tasks
Stress Task
Stress-related neural activity was manipulated with a modified version of the Montreal 
Imaging Stress Task (MIST;40) where participants calculated math problems of varying 
difficulty under the guise that the experimenters were comparing their performance to other 
students at UCLA. As a control condition, participants completed “practice” blocks where 
they answered easy math problems (e.g. 1+2+4=) silently in their heads. Participants pushed 
a button once they came up with an answer. No answer choices or responses were displayed. 
During the “test” blocks, the blocks designed to elicit stress, participants mentally calculated 
more difficult math problems (e.g. 14 × 3/6 =) under time pressure and then selected an 
answer from among a set of possible answers. The subsequent screen provided the 
participant with feedback about whether or not they answered correctly and their 
performance relative to the “typical UCLA student.” Over time, the feedback indicated that 
participants’ performance (based on how quickly and accurately they responded relative to 
the average student) became increasingly worse as the typical student’s performance grew 
better, thus amplifying the social evaluative nature and uncontrollability of the situation.
Participants completed a total of 8 56-second blocks separated by 5-seconds of fixation 
crosshair: 4 practice blocks and 4 test blocks. Within each block, 8 math problems were 
presented for 5-seconds each. For the practice blocks, math problems were followed by 2-
seconds of rest, but for the test blocks, math problems were followed by 2-seconds of 
feedback (1-second indicating whether the participant correctly answered and 1-second

 indicating how they performed relative to others). After each block participants rated how 
stressful they found the previous block (“how stressful was that”), rated from 1-not at all 
stressed to 4-extremely stressed. As expected, participants found the test blocks more 
stressful (M=2.90, SD=.73) than the practice blocks (M=1.98, SD=.72, t(35)=8.74, p<.001) 
indicating that the test blocks were indeed stressful. Stress-related neural activity was 
evaluated by comparing the test blocks to the practice blocks.
Affiliative Task
To examine associations between social support and reward-related activity in the ventral 
striatum to viewing images of close others, participants completed a modified affiliative task 
previously shown to activate reward-related neural circuitry (41–43). Prior to their 
experimental session, participants emailed 2 digital photographs of 2 different close others 
and ratings to two items using a 1–10 scale: “how close are you to this person,” anchored by 
“not at all” and “extremely” and “to what extent is this person a source of social support to 
you” anchored by “not a source of support” and “tremendous source of support.” 
Participants were indeed able to identify people with whom they had close, supportive 
relationships (M closeness=9.21, SD=1.31; M supportiveness=9.03, SD=1.26). One outlier, 
who rated one of their close others a 4 on closeness and supportiveness, was removed from 
any analyses evaluating the affiliative task. Therefore, the affiliative task is based on a 
sample of 35 participants.
Images of close others were reformatted into standard space and presented along with 
gender, race, and age-matched strangers in a block design. For each block, 2 images of a 
single person (either a close other or a stranger) were presented for a total of 16 seconds (8 
seconds for each of the 2 images). In between blocks of images, participants completed easy 
mental arithmetic silently in their heads (e.g. count back by 3’s from 639) in 12-second 
blocks. This was included as a neutral baseline condition intended to prevent participants 
from continuing to think about their close others in between trials. In total, 16 blocks were 
presented, 8 mental arithmetic, 4 close other, and 4 stranger. Neural activity to the affiliative 
task was evaluated by comparing blocks of close others to blocks of strangers.
Prosocial Task
In addition to exploring associations between social support and neural activity to a stressful 
and affiliative task, we wanted to understand the associations between social support and 
neural responses to acting prosocially. Thus, participants completed a modified version of a 
donation task (44,45). In this task, participants had the chance to earn raffle tickets for 
themselves and for “someone you know that could use some money right now.” Before the 
task began, participants were asked to name the person they would be playing for and to 
provide the email and phone number of this person so that the experimenters could later 
contact them directly if they won. After the study was over, the tickets were entered into a 
drawing (including subjects as well as those they were playing for), in which 2 people won 
$300 each. The more tickets a participant won, the greater chance that they or the person 
they were playing for could win the $300.

 During the task, participants saw 4 different trial types. On each trial, participants viewed a 
proposed distribution of raffle tickets split across themselves and the other person they chose 
to play for (3.5 seconds followed by a jittered fixation period, lasting 3 seconds on average 
(range=2.28–6.07)), and participants could then choose whether to accept or reject the 
proposed split. During the key prosocial trials—costly giving trials, participants chose 
whether to accept offers where they could give raffle tickets to the other person at a cost of 
tickets for themselves (e.g. YOU −10, OTHER +50). During the self-reward trials, 
participants could win raffle tickets for themselves without any cost to the other person (e.g. 
YOU +40, OTHER +0). On control trials, participants saw trials in which no tickets could be 
won or lost (YOU +0, OTHER +0). Costly reward (e.g. YOU +30, OTHER −10) trials were 
also included in the task to keep participants engaged and interested in the task, but were not 
analyzed.
The prosocial task included 90 trials (40 costly giving—to account for the fact that some 
trials would not be accepted, 20 pure reward, 20 control, 10 costly reward). The range of 
tickets that participants could win or lose varied between −30 tickets and +70 tickets. The 
running total of tickets was not shown. During data analysis, trials were binned based on the 
acceptance of an offer. Thus, if a participant accepted a costly giving trial, that trial was 
modeled as a prosocial giving trial, otherwise it was modeled separately and not examined 
(based on prior procedures; 44,45). To assess caregiving-related neural activity in response 
to acting prosocially, costly giving trials were compared to both control and self-reward 
trials.
fMRI Data Acquisition
Participants were scanned at UCLA’s Staglin IMHRO Center for Cognitive Neuroscience on 
a Siemens 3 Telsa “Tim Trio” MRI scanner. Two anatomical scans, a high-resolution T1-
weighted echo-planar imaging volume (spin-echo, TR=5000ms; TE=33ms; matrix size 
128×128; 36 axial slices; FOV =20cm; 3mm thick, skip 1mm) and T2-weighted matched-
bandwidth (slice thickness=3mm, gap=1mm, 36 slices, TR=5000ms, TE=34ms, flip 
angle=90°, matrix=128×128, FOV=20 cm) were collected. Functional scans for each of the 
three tasks (stress task: 9 minutes, 31 seconds; affiliative task: 4 minutes, 14 seconds; 
prosocial task: 10 minutes, 12 seconds) were then acquired (echo planar T2* weighted 
gradient-echo, TR=2000ms, TE=25ms, flip angle=90°, matrix size 64×64, 36 axial slices, 
FOV=20 cm; 3-mm thick, skip 1mm). The affiliative and prosocial tasks were 
counterbalanced across participants, but the stress task was always presented after these 
other two tasks to ensure that the stressfulness of completing the stress task did not alter the 
potentially pleasant experience of completing the other two tasks.

 fMRI Data
Data was preprocessed using the DARTEL procedure in SPM8 (Wellcome Department of 
Imaging Neuroscience, London). Images were realigned, then normalized to the T2-
weighted matched bandwidth and warped into Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space, 
and finally smoothed with an 8mm Gaussian kernel, full width at half maximum. The 
general linear model was used to estimate first-level effects to each condition of interest 
compared to their respective controls. Group level analyses were then computed using the 
first-level contrast images for each participant.
Region-of-Interest (ROI) Analyses
Given that the main goals of the current study were to examine the association between self-
reported social support and stress, reward, and caregiving-related neural circuitry to three 
separate tasks, analyses were constrained to a-priori hypothesized regions-of-interest (ROI, 
see Fig. 1). In addition, two regions that were unrelated to the hypotheses tested in the 
current study were created in order to test the specificity of the associations.
For the stress task, we examined regions known to signal threat and stress including the 
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), left and right anterior insula (AI), and left and right 
amygdala. Stress-related ROIs were structurally defined using the Automated Anatomical 
Labeling (AAL) Atlas (46). To further refine the dACC ROI, we constrained the region at 
32<y<0 on the basis of summary data on cingulate activations to physical pain (47) and for 
the AI ROI, we divided the insula at y=8 the approximate boundary between the dysgranular 
and granular sectors.
For the affiliative task, left and right ventral striatum (VS) ROI’s were structurally defined 
by combining the caudate and putamen from the AAL Atlas and then constraining the 
regions at −24<x<24, 4<y<18, −12<z<0. Based on previous work on the neural correlates of 
support giving (32), the anatomical ROIs of the VS and an additional ROI of the septal area 
(SA) were used to explore activity in maternal caregiving regions to the prosocial task. The 
SA ROI was previously defined for a study examining prosocial emotions (48) according to 
microscopic sections between y=0 and y=14 that show the location of the septal nuclei 
through the anterior commissure and anterior to the optic chiasma. Though the septal nuclei 
are too small to be imaged with the 3T fMRI, the SA ROI used in the current study 
encompasses the larger surrounding area. The SA has also been imaged and reported on 
previously (49–51) although it is still a relatively small region and thus results should be 
interpreted with caution.
Finally, “control” regions were created based on their irrelevance to the current tasks in 
order to establish whether the associations between social support and neural activity were 
specific to the hypothesized regions. The supplementary motor area (SMA) was chosen as a 
control region for the affiliative task because this task did not involve any motor actions (i.e. 
there were no button responses required) and the olfactory cortex, including the olfactory 
tubercle and Broca’s olfactory cortex located under the corpus callosum, was chosen as a 
control region for the stress and prosocial tasks because there is no hypothesized function of

using the Wake Forest University Pickatlas (52).
All ROI analyses were run in Marsbar (http://marbar.sourceforge.net) and thresholded at p<.

Results
Correlation between receiving/giving social support and the vulnerability index
In line with the current literature linking social support with well-being, both self-reported 
receiving support (r=−.60, p<.001) and self-reported giving support (r=−.64, p<.001) were 
negatively correlated with the vulnerability index (Fig. 2). That is, both receiving and giving 
more support were related to lower reported negative psychological outcomes.
Neural Results
Stress Task
Main effect of task: For the stressful math task, we looked for activity in stress and threat-
related regions (dACC, AI, amygdala) when participants completed test blocks compared to 
when participants completed practice blocks. Validating the stressfulness of the task, dACC 
(M=.21, SD=.61) and left (M=.14, SD=.51) and right AI (M=.08, SD=.55) activity was 
greater during the test blocks compared to the practice blocks (M dACC=.06, SD=.48, 
t(35)=2.07, p=.023; M L AI=.03, SD=.42, t(35)=1.63, p=.056; M R AI=−.07, SD=.43, 
t(35)=2.29, p=.014). Amygdala activity, however, did not differ between test (L amyg M=−.
25, SD=.59; R amyg M=−.30, SD=.63) and practice blocks (L amyg M=−.30, SD=.63, 
t(35)=.74, p=.23; R amyg M=−.32, SD=.48, t(35)=.16, p=.44).
Correlations between receiving/giving support and neural activity: We then examined 
whether questionnaire measures of social support were related to neural activity to the stress 
task. Although receiving support was not associated with dACC (r=.07), AI (left r=.08, right 
r=.03) or amygdala activity (left r=−.04, right r=−.02), support giving was negatively 
correlated with dACC (r=−.27, p=.054), left (r=−.28, p=.048) and right AI (r=−.33, p=.024), 
and left (r=−.32, p=.028) and right amygdala (r=−.32, p=.028 activity to test (vs. practice) 
blocks (Fig. 3). The correlations between neural activity and self-reported support giving 
were significantly different from the correlations with self-reported support receiving across 
all of these regions (dACC Z=2.01, p=.022; left AI Z=2.13, p=.016; right AI Z=2.02, p=.
014; left amygdala Z=1.71, p=.043; right amygdala Z=1.81, p=.035). Thus, those who 
reported the most support giving also displayed the least amount of threat-related activity to 
the socially evaluative stressor, which is consistent with hypotheses that support giving 
might be stress-reducing.
Supporting the specificity of this effect, there were no associations between olfactory cortex 
activity (the chosen control region) and either self-reported receiving support (r=.164, p=.
170) or self-reported support giving (r=.007, p=.491) in response to the stress task (test vs. 
practice blocks).

 Affiliative Task
Main effect of task: Ventral striatum activity was assessed as participants viewed images of 
close, supportive others and strangers. Consistent with the importance of reward-related 
processing to close social relationships (42), viewing images of close others (vs. strangers) 
led to increased activity in the left (M close other=.04, SD=.22, M stranger=−.03, SD=.20, 
t(34)=1.88, p=.034) and right VS (M close other=−.03, SD=.20, M stranger=−.10, SD=.21, 
t(34)=1.71, p=.049).
Correlations between receiving/giving support and neural activity: Correlational 
analyses revealed that while support receiving was not associated with VS activity (r left=.
03, r right=−.02), support giving was associated with greater left (r=.42, p=.006) and right 
VS (r=.41, p=.008) to viewing images of close others (vs. strangers). Moreover, these 
associations were significantly different from those between receiving support and VS 
activity (left Z=2.34, p=.009; right Z=2.58, p=.005; Fig. 4).
To examine the specificity of these effects, we examined the correlation between activity in 
the control region (SMA) and questionnaire measures of social support. As expected, there 
were no associations between SMA activity and either self-reported receiving support (r=−.
024, p=.446) or self-reported support giving (r=.191, p=.136) in response to the affiliative 
task.
Prosocial Task
Main effect of task: To ensure that the prosocial task activated the hypothesized caregiving 
regions, we evaluated differences in the left and right VS and SA activity to costly giving 
and reward trials (vs. control) separately. Consistent with prior studies (44,45), VS activity 
was greater during the costly giving trials, when participants chose to give raffle tickets to 
someone else (M left VS=.26, SD=.50; M right VS=.42, SD=.62), compared to the control 
condition (M left VS=.04, SD=.20, t(35)=2.795, p=.004; M right VS=.07, SD=.24, 
t(35)=3.937, p<.001). Moreover, in response to self-reward (vs. control) trials, there was 
greater activity in the right VS (M=.31, SD=.75, t(35)=2.193, p=.018), but not the left VS 
(M=.16, SD=.72, t(35)=1.15, p=.13). SA activity was not significantly different between 
costly giving trials (M=−.18, SD=1.55) and control trials (M=−.18, SD=.55, t(35)=−.01, p=.
50) or between self-reward trials (M=−.50, SD=1.78) compared to control trials (t(35)= 
−1.34, p=.094). There were no differences in VS and SA to costly giving vs. self-reward 
(ps>.14), indicating that both giving and receiving lottery tickets elicited reward-related 
activity.
Correlations between receiving/giving support and neural activity: Correlational 
analyses showed no association between self-reported receiving support and either left (r=.
11, p=.26) or right VS activity (r=.09, p=.31) in response to costly giving (vs. self-reward) 
trials. The association between receiving support and SA activity during costly giving (vs. 
self-reward) was marginal (r=24, p=.084). However, there was a significant association 
between support giving and left VS (r=.31, p=.033), right VS (r=.31, p=.034), and SA (r=.
39, p=.095) activity (Fig. 5). That is, those who reported giving the most support to others 
demonstrated the greatest VS and SA activity to costly giving trials relative to self-reward

 trials. Thus, the more participants reported giving support to others, the more caregiving-
related neural activity they showed to trials in which they chose to give to another person in 
need, but no such association was found between how much support people received and 
neural activity to the prosocial task. The correlations between self-reported support giving 
and the VS were marginally different from the correlation between self-reported receiving 
support and the VS (left: Z=−1.32, p=.094; right Z=−1.19, p=.12), however, the correlation 
between self-reported support giving and SA activity was not significantly different from the 
correlation between self-reported receiving support and SA activity (p=.17).
Finally, we examined the correlation between activity in the control region (olfactory cortex) 
and questionnaire measures of social support. There were no associations between olfactory 
cortex activity and either the questionnaire measure of receiving support (r=.004, p=.491) or 
the questionnaire measure of support giving (r=.021, p=.452).
Discussion
To date, our understanding of the association between social ties and health has been 
incomplete insofar as there is a fair amount known about the benefits of receiving support, 
but less is known about the benefits that may come from giving to others. The current study 
examined the associations between questionnaire measures of receiving and giving support 
to others, self-reported negative psychological outcomes, and neural activity to stressful and 
socially rewarding tasks. Although both receiving and giving social support were related to 
lower reported negative psychological outcomes, at the level of the brain, only support 
giving was associated with beneficial outcomes. Specifically, support giving was associated 
with lower threat-related activity to a stress task, greater activity in the ventral striatum to 
viewing images of close others (vs. strangers), and greater caregiving-related neural activity 
to acting prosocially (vs. selfishly). These results add to the accumulating literature 
suggesting that giving to others might be beneficial for health and well-being (30–
24,32,44,53).
The current findings suggest that giving to others may act through multiple routes: 1) via 
reduced stress-related mechanisms, 2) via increased reward-related activity in response to 
viewing close others, and 3) via increased caregiving-related activity in response to acting 
prosocially. The findings from each of the three tasks are discussed below.
Although physical health outcomes were not measured in this study, the current results shed 
light on possible neural pathways by which giving to others may be associated with better 
health outcomes (20,22), namely by reducing activity in stress and threat-related regions 
during stressful experiences. Indeed, stressor-evoked dACC, AI, and amygdala activity, as 
studied here, have all been associated with increased autonomic (SNS) responding (see 31 
for review).
Why might giving support, but not receiving support, be associated with reduced stress-
related neural activity? Giving support might bypass some of the conditions that result in the 
detrimental effects associated with receiving support. For instance, receiving support 
sometimes backfires because it mismatches one’s personal preferences for support (54),

 leaves one feeling indebted (18), and signals that something distressing or negative has 
happened (55). Giving support, on the other hand, allows an individual to control when and 
how support is given, can lead to a greater sense of autonomy and self-efficacy (56), is 
associated with increased feelings of social connection (32), and increased happiness (57). 
Thus, to the extent that giving to others simultaneously bypasses the problems that receiving 
support sometimes elicits and increases one’s psychological resources, giving, relative to 
receiving support, may result in more effective stress reduction. The current results are 
correlational, however, and so experimental work that directly compares both receiving and 
giving support on physical health-related outcomes is needed to understand when and how 
each kind of support is uniquely beneficial or whether those who give support are simply 
less prone to stress-related responding to socially evaluative stressors, as examined in the 
current study.
The hypothesis that support giving might be stress reducing on its own appears to contradict 
the large and well-known literature on the negative health effects of chronic caregiving (e.g. 
58,59). It is possible that when the caregiving needs exceed the demands of psychological, 
material, or social resources available to an individual, giving support may no longer be 
health-protective. However, studies linking chronic caregiving to poor health outcomes have 
thus far failed to control for the emotional distress of witnessing the deterioration of a loved 
one. Therefore it remains unclear whether the support giving component of chronic 
caregiving is the “active ingredient” in the association between caregiving and bad health or 
if there are other factors at play. Some studies suggest that caregiving can be associated with 
beneficial, rather than detrimental, health outcomes (60,61), pointing to the possibility that 
the caregiving itself may not be the cause of the negative health effects. Thus, much like 
receiving support, there are a number of factors that contribute to whether and when giving 
to others is or is not beneficial for health.
In addition to the relationship between support giving and reduced stress-related neural 
activity, support giving was also associated with increased VS activity to viewing images of 
close others. Those who reported giving more support to others also displayed greater 
reward-related activity to images of their own loved ones. There was no such association 
between VS activity and reports of receiving support. The ventral striatum is particularly 
sensitive to social (vs. nonsocial) rewards (62), and also to the degree of closeness between 
two individuals (63). For instance, sharing monetary rewards with a friend activates the VS 
more than sharing rewards with a stranger. Furthermore, those reporting higher closeness 
ratings with the friend display greater VS to the shared wins with the friend (vs. a stranger). 
Similarly, the number of years married is associated with increased VS to images of 
romantic partners (vs. close friends; 41). Based on these findings it is possible that VS 
activity to “social rewards” might also signal the degree of closeness and connection with 
others. Thus the positive correlation between support giving and VS to images of close 
others may suggest that there is something unique about giving support, but not necessarily 
receiving support, that binds people closer together (26).
The prosocial task assessed caregiving-related neural activity as participants had the 
opportunity to give to another individual. Self-reported support giving, but not support 
receiving, was positively correlated with VS and SA activity in response to acting

 prosocially (vs. selfishly). These findings suggest that those who tend to give more support 
might also be more rewarded by acting prosocially toward a known other, which may 
encourage more subsequent support giving behavior. Although the current task assessed 
prosocial behavior toward a single target, caregiving-related activity while acting prosocially 
toward others more broadly may predict better health outcomes on its own. Consistent with 
this possibility, one recent study found that ventral striatum activity to giving, but not to 
receiving monetary rewards for oneself, was associated with reduced depression levels a 
year later (45). Future work directly linking caregiving-circuitry during prosocial behavior 
and health outcomes outside of the scanner will clarify the role of the VS and SA in any 
health benefits that may come from giving to others.
An important future direction for understanding how support giving relates to beneficial 
outcomes is to isolate the unique contribution of support giving itself from other individual 
difference factors, such as extraversion or general positive affect. Previous work exploring 
the health benefits of support giving has shown that the associations between support giving 
and health remain after controlling for subjective well-being, baseline health factors, and 
extraversion (20,23) suggesting that there is something uniquely beneficial about giving to 
others. However, controlling for these additional personality factors will help clarify the 
unique role that support giving plays in health.
In sum, the results of the current study suggest that examining the psychological and 
physical health benefits of giving support to others deserves greater empirical attention and 
that gaining a full understanding of how and why social ties are so important to well-being 
requires the consideration of both the support that is received and given.
