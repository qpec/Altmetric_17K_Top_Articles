Abstract
Perceptions of neighborhood safety are positively associated with
perceptions of neighborhood violence. However, research has yet to
examine whether this relationship is moderated by specific types of
violence, such as sexual violence, that are more salient for women.
Using street-intercept interviews with 343 adults in 9 neighbor-
hoods of a U.S. city with high rates of poverty, unemployment, and
crime, we examine the relationship of perceived neighborhood vio-
lence to perceived safety in the context of gender while controlling
for neighborhood assetsthatmoderate perceptionsofneighborhood
safety and violence. We hypothesized that gender would moder-
ate the relationship between perceived neighborhood violence and
safety, and that women's perceptions of neighborhood safety would
be significantly influenced by neighborhood sexual violence, but not
other types of violence. Although women and men in these high
crime, urban neighborhoods did not differ in their perceptions of
neighborhood safety or violence, perceived sexual violence did sig-
nificantly moderate safety by gender; women's perceptions of neigh-
borhood sexual violence predicted perceived safety in their neigh-
borhood. Importantly, gender did not moderate perceived safety for
other types of violence. These results illustrate the importance of
taking gender and perceived sexual violence into account to under-
stand neighborhood safety in adults, particularly women.

INTRODUCTION
Neighborhoods are important influences on human development and behavior (Henry, Gorman-Smith, Schoeny, &
Tolan, 2014). For example, studies have shown that neighborhood structural conditions, such as residential segrega-
tion, concentrated poverty, physical and social disorder, crime, and exposure to violence, have harmful effects on health
and well-being (Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, & Aber, 1997; Coulton, Pandey, & Chow, 1990; Diez Roux, 2016; Sampson,
Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997; Silver, Mulvey, & Swanson, 2002). We also know that specific neighborhood assets, such

as neighborhood collective efficacy—which represents a combination of social cohesion and trust among neighbors
and informal social controls (Sampson et al., 1997)—can mitigate harmful effects on health by moderating the influ-
ence of these structural conditions (Henry et al., 2014; Mujahid, Roux, Morenoff, & Raghunathan, 2007; Sampson et al.,
1997). In addition, improvements in the aesthetic quality and walking environment of a neighborhood can moderate
the negative health effects of neighborhood conditions, such as physical and social disorder, by creating safer or more
appealing spaces for physical activity (Mason, Kearns, & Livingston, 2013; Miles, 2008; Mujahid et al., 2007).
Neighborhood perceptions of safety can serve as a proxy for certain neighborhood conditions such as crime, expo-
sure to violence, and concentrated poverty (Drakulich, 2013; Ross & Mirofsky, 2001; Rassmussen, Aber, & Bhana,
2004; Thomas, Caldwell, Jagers, & Flay, 2016). Neighborhood safety has also been found to be negatively associ-
ated with health and well-being (Burdette, Wadden, Wadden, & Whitaker, 2006; Duncan, Johnson, Molnar, & Azrael,
2009; Zhang, Eamon, & Zhan, 2015), and positively associated with favorable perceptions of the neighborhood walk-
ing environment (Brown, Perkins, & Brown, 2004; Foster & Giles-Corti, 2008; Mason et al., 2013), aesthetic quality
(Austin, Furr, & Spine, 2002; Kuo & Sullivan, 1998; Miles, 2008), and collective efficacy (Allik & Kearns, 2016; Pearson,
Breetzke, & Ivory, 2015; Thomas, Caldwell, & Jagers, 2016).
In this study, we examine perceptions of neighborhood safety in the context of one commonly assessed neighbor-
hood condition—perceived violence—while controlling for neighborhood assets that have been found to moderate the
relationship between safety and violence. These include social cohesion and trust among neighbors, informal social
control, neighborhood aesthetic quality, and the neighborhood walking environment. In addition, we examine the rela-
tionship between neighborhood safety and violence in the context of gender and specific types of neighborhood vio-
lence that may be salient for women such as sexual violence to determine whether previous approaches for assess-
ing neighborhood safety have neglected to take into account gender-sensitive perceptions essential to understanding
safety.
1.1
Gender and perceived neighborhood safety
There is considerable evidence that women report higher threats to personal safety than men, and that this may be
due to gender differences between women and men in the fear of crime (Allik & Kearns, 2016; Hale, 1996; Haynie,
1998; Schaefer, Huebner, & Bynum, 2006; Warr, 1984). In urban neighborhoods with high rates of crime, women also
report less personal safety (Allik & Kearns, 2016; Brunton-Smith & Sturgis, 2011; Rasmussen, Aber, & Bhana, 2004).
Importantly, gender differences in perceptions of neighborhood safety may not be based on victimization or exposure
to crime, but simply knowledge of neighborhood crime, particularly violent crime (Drakulich, 2013; Skogan & Maxfield,
1981).
But what accounts for gender differences in perceived safety? The “vulnerability hypothesis”maintains that women
feel less physically able to thwart a potential attack and thus are more concerned about personal safety, including sex-
ual assault (Franklin, Franklin, & Fearn, 2008; Haynes & Rader, 2015; Schafer, Huebner, & Bynum, 2006; Yodanis, 2004).
There is some evidence to support this view, although findings are inconclusive (Allik & Kearns, 2016; Haynes & Rader,
2015). A variation of this theory is that men minimize their vulnerability because admitting fear for their safety may
threaten traditional conceptualizations of masculinity (Sutton & Farrall, 2005); thus, men report feeling less vulnera-
ble to physical attack.
Another theory is that women are generally more afraid of violent crime, such as robbery and assault because these
have the potential to lead to sexual assault. Known as the “shadow of sexual assault theory”(Ferraro, 1996), this theory
has also garnered some support (Fisher & Sloan, 2003; Hirtenlehner & Farral, 2014; Lane, Gover, & Dahod, 2009), with
one study indicating that controlling for fear of sexual assault among college women was associated with reduced fears
of other types of crime (Dobbs, Waid, & Shelley, 2009). Finally, feminist theories of safety and fear of crime have argued
that in societies or social groups in which women experience status inequities relative to men, women are more likely to
be vulnerable to physical attack, subject to sexist masculine norms, and experience sexual assault (Yodanis, 2004), thus
accounting for gender differences in perceptions of safety. Each of these theories emphasizes the salience of sexual
assault for women relative to men when considering neighborhood safety.
 HOFFMAN ET AL.
81
Most assessments of neighborhood safety usually collapse judgments about the threat or knowledge of sexual
assault into a broader category of perceptions of violence that includes other types of violent crime (Henry et al., 2014;
Mujahid et al., 2007; Sampson et al., 1997). Thus, studies of perceived safety that examine gender differences may
“mask”or “wash out”a key factor in women's feelings of personal safety, particularly in higher crime neighborhoods.
This may have important implications for understanding neighborhood safety accurately for men and women and for
developing gender-sensitive interventions.
1.2
The current study
In this study, we use hierarchical regression to examine the relationship between perceptions of neighborhood
safety and violence by gender in a sample of predominantly Black adults residing in high-crime neighborhoods in
a northeastern city in the United States. We control for race and key neighborhood factors known to moderate
perceptions of safety, including cohesion and trust among neighbors, informal social control in the neighborhood,
neighborhood aesthetic quality, and the neighborhood walking environment. In a second set of regression analyses,
we then examine the relationship of four types of neighborhood violence—sexual assault, a fight with a weapon, a
gang fight, and a robbery/mugging—to perceived neighborhood safety and examine whether gender moderates these
relationships.
Our hypotheses are as follows:
H1:
Gender will moderate the relationship between perceived violence and safety, with women reporting higher
threats to safety.
H2:
Gender will moderate the relationship between perceived sexual violence and safety, with women reporting
higher threats to safety, but that there will be no differences in perceived safety between men and women for
other types of violence assessed.

METHOD
2.1
Participants
Participants include 343 individuals residing in one of nine neighborhoods in a large northeastern city in the United
States. Data available for the most recent year in which the study was conducted indicate that study neighborhoods
have a median annual household income less than $27,000; 29%–53% of residents in each neighborhood live below the
federal poverty level; unemployment ranges from 14% to 22% across neighborhoods; and crimes per 1,000 residents
ranges from 66 to 123, which is over one-half higher than the mean rate for the city overall (Tebes, Matlin, Hunter,
Thompson, Prince, & Mohatt, 2015; U.S. Census Bureau, 2013; U.S. Department of Justice, 2013a). Additionally, the
rateofsexualassaultinthecityisalmostone(.82)in1,000,whichismorethantwicethestate'srate(U.S.Departmentof
Justice, 2013b,c). Over one-half of participants are men (N = 213; 61.9%), more than three-quarters are Black (N = 328;
86%), just over 10% Hispanic/Latino (N = 35; 10.7%), and the remaining residents self-identify as White (N = 6; 1.7%),
Asian American (N = 6; 1.7%), Native American (N = 5; 1.5%), and other (N = 15; 4.4%). Overall, participants report
living in their neighborhood for about 20 years (mean [M] = 19.51, standard deviation [SD] = 55.32), with men living
there slightly longer than women (men: M = 22.53, SD = 69.27; women: M = 15.98, SD = 14.70). These demographic
characteristics are consistent with those of residents living in the neighborhoods where the study took place.
2.2
Procedure
Street-intercept interviews were completed in nine neighborhoods at three predesignated intersections within one-
half to one mile of one another. All interviews were conducted across a 2-year period in the afternoon hours on week-
days and weekends and were not done during inclement weather. A total of 22 individuals were trained to complete
 82
HOFFMAN ET AL.
street intercept interviews for this study. Interviewers ranged between 21 and 59 years of age, with most in their
20s. Interviewer race and ethnicity was not directly assessed, but of the 18 interviewers who volunteered this infor-
mation, four identified as Black, three Hispanic or Bilingual Spanish, three Asian American, and the remainder White. A
total of 17 interviewers (77%) were women and five were men.
Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish using a semistructured protocol that required approximately
8–15 minutes to complete. Residents were eligible for an interview if they were older than 18 years of age and lived
within a mile of the interview intersection. Participants used a set of laminated response cards to assist participants
in responding to each question or statement read by the interviewer. At the conclusion of the interview, participants
were compensated with two tokens for the local transportation system. All interviews were conducted in compliance
with university and city institutional review board procedures.
Participants were given the option of not responding to individual perceived violence items, and thus in many
instances, data on specific items were incomplete. Because this study examines whether responses to specific types
of neighborhood violence moderate perceptions of safety for women and men, we decided not to impute scores
for those specific items. Instead, we included only those participants for whom all four violence items were com-
plete in our final sample size (n = 343). However, this left the possibility that those who completed all four items
were a select group, possibly different in key ways from those who did not respond to all four violence items.
Thus, we examined responses from participants who completed each of the four perceived items (n = 343) to
those who completed one to three items (n = 377) using t-tests on perceptions of neighborhood violence and
safety. No differences were found between the two groups for these neighborhood perceptions; in addition, no
group differences in completion rates were found by gender. As a result, our final sample size for this study was
343 participants.
2.3
Measures
2.3.1
Perceived safety
Three items from the Neighborhood Scales (Mujahid, Diez Roux, Morenoff, & Raghunathan, 2007) assessed percep-
tions of safety: “I feel safe walking in my neighborhood day or night,”“Violence is not a problem in my neighborhood,”
and “My neighborhood is safe from crime.”All 343 participants responded to each item and rated the items on a 5-point
Likert-style scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), with a high score indicating greater perceptions
of safety. Scores for each item were summed and an average of the sum score was taken, resulting in a mean of 4.89
(standard deviation [SD] = 2.64, range: 3–15) and reliability was satisfactory (𝛼 = .61).
2.3.2
Perceived violence
The perceived violence items measured participants’ perceptions of how often a particular crime occurred in their
neighborhood in the past 6 months. There were four violence knowledge questions from the Mujahid et al. (2007)
Neighborhood Scales: “Was there a fight in this neighborhood in which a weapon was used?”
; “Were there gang fights in
this neighborhood?”
; “Was there a sexual assault or rape in this neighborhood?”
; and “Was there a robbery or mugging
in this neighborhood?”All 343 participants responded to each item and rated the items on a 4-point Likert-style scale
ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (often), with high scores indicating perceiving the neighborhood as more violent. Scores for
each item were summed, and an average of the sum score was taken. The perceived violence subscale had a mean of
5.61 (SD = 3.36, range: 4–16) and reliability was good (𝛼 = .80).
2.3.3
Neighborhood control variables
Four subscales from the Mujahid et al. (2007) Neighborhood Scales were controlled for in this study: Neighborhood
Social Cohesion and Trust, Neighborhood Informal Social Control, Neighborhood Aesthetic Quality, and Neighbor-
hood Walking Environment. For each subscale, respective items were summed and an average of the sum score was
taken.
 HOFFMAN ET AL.
83
Neighborhood social cohesion and trust was assessed with five items (e.g., “This is a close knit neighborhood”and
“People in this neighborhood can be trusted”
). Participants rated the items on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly
agree) to (strongly disagree), with higher scores indicating greater cohesion and trust. The mean for this subscale was
15.79 (SD = 3.56, range: 5–25) and reliability was satisfactory, 𝛼 = .64.
Neighborhood informal social control comprised five items that posed hypothetical neighborhood situations (e.g.,
“If there was a fight in front of a house in this neighborhood and someone were being beaten or threatened, how likely
is it that a neighbor would break it up?”
; “Suppose that because of budget cuts the fire station closest to here was going
to be closed down by the city. How likely is it that neighborhood residents would organize to try to do something to
keep the fire station open?”
). Participants indicated their neighbors’ likely response on a 5-point scale ranging from 1
(very likely) to 5 (very unlikely), with higher scores indicating greater informal social control. This subscale had a mean of
16.81 (SD = 5.10, range: 5–25) and reliability was good, 𝛼 = .79.
The aesthetic quality of the neighborhood was assessed with six items (e.g., “There is a lot of trash and litter
on the street in this neighborhood”and “This neighborhood is attractive”
). Participants rate the aesthetic quality of
their neighborhood on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to (strongly disagree), with higher scores indi-
cating greater aesthetic quality. This subscale had a mean of 18.35 (SD = 3.80, range: 6–30) and reliability was
good, 𝛼 = .76.
Finally, neighborhood walking environment was assessed with nine items (e.g. “It is pleasant to walk in this neigh-
borhood” and “I often see other people walking in this neighborhood”
). Participants rated the neighborhood walk-
ing environment on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to (strongly disagree), with higher scores indicat-
ing more positive environment. This subscale had a mean of 27.94 (SD = 5.30, range: 9–45) and reliability was
good, 𝛼 = .70.
2.3.4
Demographics
At the conclusion of the interview, interviewers obtained self-ratings of race and gender using categories consistent
with the U.S. Census. For this study, race and gender categories were collapsed into two groups, Black and non-Black,
and men and women.
2.4
Analytic approach
We used hierarchical regression analyses in three steps to examine whether gender moderated the relationship
between perceived violence and perceived safety. We then examined whether gender moderated perceptions of neigh-
borhood safety when perceptions of neighborhood sexual violence were taken into account. In these analyses, we
controlled for race as well as key neighborhood assets and characteristics including social cohesion and trust among
neighbors, neighborhood informal social control, neighborhood aesthetic quality, and the neighborhood walking envi-
ronment. Hierarchical regressions were performed in three steps. First, gender was examined as a moderator between
perceived safety and perceived violence. Second, gender was examined as a moderator between perceived safety and
each perceived violence item. And third, the interaction between gender and perceived sexual violence was examined
in relation to perceived safety.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the correlation matrix of study variables, indicating modest but significant correlations in the expected
direction for all variables examined in the regression analyses, except gender and race, which were not significantly
related to any variables. Additional descriptive analyses were conducted to examine whether there were signifi-
cant a priori gender differences in perceived safety and violence. Mean scores for each revealed no differences by

Regression analyses
Next, we used hierarchical regression to examine gender as a moderator of the relationship between perceived vio-
lence and safety while controlling for race and neighborhood-level variables. The results are shown in Table 2. We
entered race, gender, and neighborhood-level controls into step 1, F (6, 301) = 15.79, p < .001, R2 = 0.24, and then
entered perceived violence into step 2, which resulted in a significant model change, R2 = 0.34, ∆F(1, 300) = 21.57,
p < .001. For every unit increase in perceived violence, there was a 0.35-point decrease in perceived safety, b = −0.35,
standard error [SE] = 0.04, t (308) = −6.56, p < .001, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.35, −0.19]. Consistent with the
descriptive analyses, there was no main effect for gender, and the interaction term for gender and perceived violence
(entered in step 3) did not result in a significant model change, R2 = 0.34, ∆F(1, 299) = 1.99, p = 0.160.
Next, we examined gender as a moderator of the relationship between each type of perceived violence—sexual vio-
lence, a fight with a weapon, a gang fight, a robbery/mugging—and perceived safety. Table 3 shows the results of these
analyses. Race, gender, and the neighborhood-level variables were entered into step 1 F (6, 301) = 15.79, p < .001,

FIGURE 1
Interaction term with gender moderating perceived sexual violence and perceived safety
R2 = 0.24. Perceived sexual violence was entered in step 2, which resulted in a significant model change, R2 = 0.26,
∆F(1, 300) = 9.72, p < 0.01. For every unit increase in perceived sexual violence there was a 0.78-point decrease in
perceived safety, b = −0.16, SE = 0.14, t(308) = −3.12, p < .01, 95% CI [−0.70, −0.16]. Once again, there was no main
effect for gender.
An interaction term for gender and perceived sexual violence was then entered in step 3 and resulted in a signifi-
cant model change, R2 = 0.28, ∆F(1, 299) = 6.06, p < .05, indicating that gender moderated the relationship between
perceived sexual violence and perceived safety, b = −0.29, SE = 0.27, t(308) = −2.46, p = .014, 95% CI [−1.19, −0.13].
Figure 1 shows this relationship: Women who reported higher perceptions of sexual violence reported less perceived
safety than men who also reported higher perceptions of sexual violence. Conversely, women who reported low per-
ceptions of sexual violence reported higher perceived safety when compared to men who reported low perceptions of
sexual violence; men who reported both low and high perceptions of sexual violence had similar perceptions of safety.
Importantly, as shown in Table 3, gender does not moderate the relationship between any of the other types of violence
and safety: fighting with a weapon, R2 = 0.34, ∆F(1, 299) = 2.95, p = .087; gang fights, R2 = 0.27, ∆F(1, 299) = 0.69,
p = .407; and robbery or mugging, R2 = 0.33, ∆F(1, 299) = 0.35, p = .555.

DISCUSSION
We examined perceptions of neighborhood violence and safety among men and women who live in low-income, high-
crime urban neighborhoods. We hypothesized that gender would moderate the relationship between perceptions
of violence and safety, and that this relationship would be stronger for women. We also hypothesized that gender
would moderate the relationship between perceived neighborhood sexual violence and neighborhood safety, whereby
women's perceptions of neighborhood safety would be significantly influenced by their perceptions of neighborhood
 90
HOFFMAN ET AL.
sexual violence, and that none of the other types of neighborhood violence would be moderated by gender. With the
exception of our initial hypothesis, the results supported our expectations.
Overall, men and women in these high-crime urban neighborhoods did not differ in their overall perceptions of
neighborhood safety or violence. However, consistent with our second hypothesis, perceptions of sexual violence
significantly moderated perceptions of safety by gender, with women's judgment about neighborhood sexual vio-
lence significantly predictive of their perceptions of neighborhood safety. Also as expected, gender did not mod-
erate perceptions of safety for other types of neighborhood violence such as a fight with a weapon, a gang fight,
or a robbery/mugging. In combination, these results show the importance of taking gender and perceptions of sex-
ual violence into account when attempting to understand perceived neighborhood safety by adults, particularly
women.
Previous literature had shown that outside of their home, women generally feel less safe than men, especially in
high-crime urban neighborhoods (Allik & Kearns, 2016; Brunton-Smith & Sturgis, 2011; Haynie, 1998; Lane & Meeker,
2003; Lane et al., 2009; Schafer et al., 2006; Warr, 1984). Yet our study did not show this effect. Our sample of women
and men reported very similar perceptions of safety and violence in their neighborhoods. The lack of a moderation
effect suggests that overall violence in the community did not impact women in ways we initially expected. One expla-
nation for this finding is that—on average—both women and men in our sample reported living in their neighborhood
for 15 years or more, and their long-term residence may have mitigated their perceptions of crime, violence, and safety
in their neighborhood. Another possibility is that repeated exposure to community violence may have desensitized
both women and men to neighborhood crime and its perceived safety, a finding reported in previous research (Fowler,
Tompsett, Braciszeweski, Jaques-Tiura, & Baltes, 2009).
Research by Brunton-Smith and Sturgis (2011) has found that women's fear of crime and perceptions of safety are
linked to perceptions of neighborhood disorder (e.g., loitering, arguing among adults). Because these neighborhoods
were characterized by high rates of crime and violence, it is possible higher perceptions of disorder in these neigh-
borhoods may have reduced the potential for observing gender differences in neighborhood safety. Future research
should examine potential mitigating factors directly such as longevity in the neighborhood, desensitization to rates of
neighborhood crime, and perceptions of neighborhood disorder.
Relatedly, we also found that as the relationship between perceived violence and safety in the neighborhood
increased, perceptions of safety decreased for both women and men. This finding is consistent with research show-
ing that resident perceptions of neighborhoods as violent tend to covary with neighborhood perceptions of safety
(Drakulich, 2013). For our sample, perceptions of safety may have reduced residents’ engagement in their neighbor-
hoods in meaningful ways such as use of its walking environment. Neighborhoods perceived to be safe by residents
have been linked with psychosocial benefits from participation in neighborhood activities (Mason et al., 2013); such
benefits may simply not have accrued to residents in our sample because their neighborhood was not perceived as
safe.
As expected, we found that gender moderated the relationship between perceived sexual violence and safety;
importantly, however, gender did not moderate the relationship between other types of violence and safety. This sug-
gests that although the vulnerability hypothesis (Franklin et al., 2008; Haynes & Rader, 2015) may have some gen-
eral applicability regarding gender and perceptions of safety, specific concerns about sexual violence among women—
consistent with the shadow of sexual assault theory (Ferraro, 1996)—are also relevant. While some research has sug-
gested that fear of physical violence actually drives women's fear of crime (Hirtenlehner & Farrall, 2014), our study
shows that multiple types of violent crime (including physical violence) did not result in differential perceptions of
safety among women and men. Clearly, sexual violence is a salient concern among women living in these neighbor-
hoods, a finding consistent with prior research (Fisher & Sloan, 2003; Hilinski, 2009; MacMillan, Nierobisz, & Welsh,
2000; Watson, Marszalek, Dispensa, & Davids, 2015). This study, however, was the first study to show the importance
of taking specific perceptions of sexual violence into account by gender when assessing neighborhood safety.
Our findings illustrate the relationship of sexual assault to women's feelings of safety in their neighborhood—
feelings that are related to physical and mental health (Burdette, Wadden, & Whitaker, 2006; Clark et al., 2007; Duncan
et al., 2009; Whitley & Prince, 2005). For example, research has shown that, compared to men, women report walking
 HOFFMAN ET AL.
91
less when they feel less safe (Foster, Hillsdon, & Thorogood, 2004). If women feel threatened by sexual violence in their
neighborhoods, they may also be less likely to become involved in their neighborhood or do so at considerable personal
cost. Perceptions of neighborhood safety also are likely to diminish opportunities for engagement with neighborhood
social supports.
These findings have programmatic implications for the development of community-level interventions. Our study
identifies perceptions of sexual violence as an important component of women's perceptions of safety in their neigh-
borhoods. This suggests that reductions in sexual crime may help women feel safer in their communities. Aspects of a
neighborhood's built environment—such as aesthetic quality—have been associated with reduced crime (Kuo & Sulli-
van, 2001) and, in particular, reductions in domestic violence (Sullivan & Kuo, 1996). Community gardening represents
one possible approach to reducing crime by improving a neighborhood's aesthetic quality and creating viable opportu-
nities for supportive engagement among neighborhood residents (Okvat & Zautra, 2011). Participatory interventions
aimed at community development may also be effective in improving neighborhood assets such as collective efficacy,
which have been linked to reduced crime (Sampson et al., 1997). Aligning perceptions of safety with direct changes
in neighborhoods may be a promising approach to addressing feelings of safety as well as perceptions of community
violence.
Finally, our findings show that, when studying perceptions of safety or fear of crime, it may be important to sepa-
rately track items pertaining to sexual violence from other types of violence. This departs from previous research in
which perceived violence or exposure to violence aggregates responses across different types of violence (Richters
& Saltzman, 1990; Selner-O'Hagan, Kindlon, Buka, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1998). By separating out different types of
violence, including sexual violence, when assessing results by gender, researchers and policymakers are more likely to
develop a more gender-sensitive understanding of the effects of neighborhood violence on perceived safety. Future
research should also examine what this study did not: Whether specific types of sexual violence other than sexual
assault such as indecent exposure or sexual harassment yield differences by gender on the perceived safety of a
neighborhood.
4.1
Limitations
The current study has a few limitations. First, the research design was cross-sectional and the data were self-report.
However, self-report is a common method for collecting data on perceptions of neighborhood safety and violence.
Future research should examine these relationships longitudinally and combine them with objective ratings of neigh-
borhood disorder and decay such as systematic social observations (Sampson et al., 1997), to complement resident per-
ceptions of neighborhood safety and violence. This study also did not include data on participants’ direct experiences
with crime, including the specific types of violence examined. One's direct experience with specific types of crime and
violence clearly affect perceptions of violence and safety in communities. Future research may consider incorporating
such information to determine how differences in experience, including by gender, influence perceptions of safety and
violence. Finally, our measure for assessing perceptions of violence included only four items rather than a wider range
of community violence. Despite this limitation, there were clear differences between men and women on how sexual
violence moderated perceptions of safety as compared to the three other violence items.
4.2
Conclusion
In summary, the present study offers new knowledge about how assessments of violence should take into account
gender differences in perceptions of sexual assault because gender differences are related to perceived neighbor-
hood safety. Our study distinguished between different types of community violence (i.e., sexual violence, fight with
weapon, gang fight, and a robbery/mugging) and found gender-moderated perceived safety based on perceptions of
sexual violence. That gender moderated perceived neighborhood safety under these conditions, when no differences
in safety were observed by gender, illustrates how important it is to take perceptions of sexual violence into account to
understand neighborhood safety.
