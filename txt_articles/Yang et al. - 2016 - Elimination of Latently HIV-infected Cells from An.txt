Persistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a 
latent state in long-lived CD4+ T-cells is a major barrier to 
eradication. Latency-reversing agents that induce direct 
or immune-mediated cell death upon reactivation of HIV 
are a possible solution. However, clearance of reactivated 
cells may require immunotherapeutic agents that are fine-
tuned to detect viral antigens when expressed at low lev-
els. We tested the antiviral efficacy of immune-mobilizing 
monoclonal T-cell receptors against viruses (ImmTAVs), 
bispecific molecules that redirect CD8+ T-cells to kill 
HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells. T-cell receptors specific for 
an immunodominant Gag epitope, SL9, and its escape 
variants were engineered to achieve supraphysiological 
affinity and fused to a humanised CD3-specific single 
chain antibody fragment. Ex vivo polyclonal CD8+ T-cells 
were efficiently redirected by immune-mobilising mono-
clonal T-cell receptors against viruses to eliminate CD4+ 
T-cells from human histocompatibility leukocyte anti-
gen (HLA)-A*0201-positive antiretroviral therapy-treated 
patients after reactivation of inducible HIV in vitro. The 
efficiency of infected cell elimination correlated with HIV 
Gag expression. Immune-mobilising monoclonal T-cell 
receptors against viruses have potential as a therapy to 
facilitate clearance of reactivated HIV reservoir cells.

INTRODUCTION
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persists in long-lived 
CD4+ T-cells for the lifetime of the infected individual due to sta-
ble integration into host cell chromosomes from the earliest stages 
of infection. In this form it is inaccessible to immune effector cells 
and is unperturbed by antiretroviral agents. The apparent cure of 
a single individual who underwent a CCR5-null hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation has provided impetus to develop safer 
and more scalable therapeutic approaches to HIV cure.1 A two-
step approach involving administration of a latency-reversing 
agent (LRA) together with a therapeutic vaccine or other immu-
nomodulator to engage host immune responses, has gained 
widespread support; the goal is to reactivate and then eliminate 
long-lived CD4+ T-cells that harbor latent HIV.2,3 However, LRAs 
that are both safe and sufficiently potent to induce HIV protein 
expression without global T-cell activation have yet to be iden-
tified.4–6 In addition, most therapeutic HIV vaccine candidates 
tested to date, mobilize only a small fraction of the CD8+ T-cell 
repertoire, which frequently comprises clones that failed to con-
trol the virus in the first place.7–12 Ex vivo expanded virus-specific 
cytotoxic T-cells have been used successfully in the treatment 
of post-transplant viral infections and were recently shown to 
eliminate latent HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells after in vitro reactiva-
tion13–16 However, the clinical utility of such an approach for HIV 
eradication is not yet known.
Engineered T-cell therapy is an alternative immunotherapeu-
tic approach that has been pioneered for cancer treatment. Genetic 
engineering of T-cells to express specific receptors can overcome 
the limitations of natural adaptive immune responses to cancer 
antigens in several ways, including affinity enhancement, redi-
rection of specificity away from self-antigens, proliferation and 
trafficking (reviewed in ref. 17). As similar considerations apply 
to genetically unstable viruses such as HIV, redirection of large 
numbers of effector T-cells toward selected epitopes could provide 
a critical advantage to the immune system, since ongoing viral 
escape from CD8+ T-cell responses could be mitigated. In support 
of this, modification of mature T-cells in the peripheral blood and 
of hematopoietic stem cells by lentiviral transduction with CD4-ζ 
or HIV TCRs has been shown to endow them with potent antivi-
ral effector function in vitro and in vivo.18–22 The development of 
bispecific soluble reagents comprising a TCR fused to a human-
ized CD3-specific single chain variable fragment (scFv) is a crucial 
advance on transduced T-cell technology, as ex vivo manipulation 
of effector cells is not required. These immune-mobilising mono-
clonal TCRs against cancer (ImmTACs) and viruses (ImmTAVs) 
have several unique features: targeted modifications of TCR com-
plementarity-determining regions result in extraordinarily high 
affinity for peptide-MHC class I, in the picomolar range, without 
loss of specificity; dosing can be tightly controlled and synergized 
with other therapies; the immune-mobilising moiety enables 
recruitment of the most potent effector cells. The net result is a

rapid and potent polyclonal response that eliminates target cells 
expressing very low levels of cognate epitope, thus overcoming a 
major hurdle not only for cancer therapy but also for pathogens 
such as HIV that downregulate human histocompatibility leuko-
cyte antigen (HLA) class I expression.23,24 Furthermore, selection 
of TCRs that recognize naturally occurring variants of the cog-
nate epitope potentiates clearance of infected cells harboring virus 
escape mutants.20,25 ImmTACs have shown promise in vitro and in 
early clinical trials in melanoma and a similar technology employ-
ing antibody-mediated redirection led to development of bispe-
cific T-cell engagers such as blinatumomab, which was recently 
licensed for of the treatment of certain leukemia.26–31
In this study, we investigated the capacity of two ImmTAVs 
with picomolar affinity for an immunodominant HIV epit-
ope to eliminate HIV gag-expressing CD4+ T-cells, after infec-
tion in vitro and after reactivation of latent HIV in CD4+ T-cells 
from antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated patients. We show that 
ImmTAVs are highly effective in mobilising polyclonal CD8+ 
T-cells to kill infected CD4+ T-cells at low CD8+/CD4+ cell ratios 
and low epitope densities.
RESULTS
Redirected antigen specificity of human primary 
CD8+ T-cells by ImmTAVs
A panel of ImmTAVs with enhanced affinity for the immunodomi-
nant HLA-A*02-restricted HIV-1 gag p17 epitope, SLYNTVATL 
(SL9) was generated by TCR engineering, as described previously.26 
Two ImmTAVs, m121 and m134, demonstrated particularly potent 
biological activity against peptide-pulsed targets, with EC50 values 
below 10–11 mol/l (Figure 1a), and these were selected for further 
testing. The target specificity of these ImmTAVs was demonstrated 
using antigen-negative HLA-A*02-positive cell lines, with which 
nonspecific T-cell activation was observed only at high ImmTAV 
concentrations, i.e., at least 1,000-fold >half maximal effective con-
centration (EC50) values (Figure 1b). A slight loss of specific bind-
ing at concentrations >10–9 mol/l has been observed previously 
with other immune-mobilising TCR reagents and is attributed to 
HLA-restricted peptide cross-reactivity.26,27 Peptide titration exper-
iments showed that m121 and m134 were sensitive to nanomolar 
concentrations of exogenously loaded SL9 peptide, indicating rec-
ognition of low numbers of epitopes32,33 (Figure 1c). In addition, 
they could interact with endogenously generated viral peptides 
presented by HIV-infected primary CD4+ T-cells (Figure 1d), 
even when the cognate epitope carried a naturally occurring muta-
tion (Y-F at position 3 in the case of the clade A virus) (Figure 1d). 
We also confirmed that they could induce specific lysis of peptide-
loaded targets (Figure 1e).
ImmTAV-redirected CD8+ T-cells inhibit exogenous 
HIV replication in vitro
Next, we investigated whether CD8+ T-cells from healthy HLA-
A*0201+ donors could inhibit HIV replication in autologous 
CD4+ T-cells when redirected by ImmTAVs. We have previously 
established the kinetics of infection with diverse laboratory-
adapted and primary HIV isolates in primary CD4+ T-cells: IIIB 
was selected because infected cell frequencies of ~20% can be 
sustained at the peak of replication (days 5–7 of culture) without 
excessive cell death.34 HIV IIIB-infected CD4+ T-cells were cul-
tured alone, with autologous unstimulated CD8+ T-cells or with 
autologous CD8+ T-cells plus ImmTAVs for 7 days. Consistent 
with our previous data, the peak Gag p24+ cell frequency was 
19% in CD4+ cell-only cultures and as expected, was not reduced 
by autologous CD8+ T-cells alone.34 However, when redirected by 
HIV ImmTAVs, CD8+ T-cells reduced infected cell frequencies 
significantly, by up to 85%, indicating a potent antiviral response. 
By contrast, an irrelevant TCR-anti-CD3 scFV fusion (control 
TCR) had negligible effect on HIV replication (Figure 2a–d). The 
effect of the ImmTAVs was dependent on both their concentration 
and the CD8+/CD4+ ratio: at a ratio of 1:1, they were most potent 
at a concentration of 10–8 mol/l, whereas at a CD8+/CD4+ cell 
ratio of 1:10, potency increased with decreasing ImmTAV concen-
trations as far as 10−10 mol/l (Figure 2a–d). There were marginally 
lower percentages of live cells in cultures with HIV ImmTAVs at 
concentrations of 10 nmol/l compared to 1 nmol/l or no ImmTAV 
(see Supplementary Figure S1).
To assess whether the antiviral efficacy of ImmTAV-redirected 
CD8+ T-cells was determined by the extent to which available 
CD8+ T-cells were recruited, purified CD8+ T-cells were loaded 
with ImmTAVs and then stained with an HLA-A*0201/SL9 dex-
tramer at 37 °C. This showed that the SL9 dextramer bound to 
ImmTAV-bearing CD8+ T-cells in a dose-dependent manner, with 
>90% and up to 87% binding the ImmTAV at concentrations of 10–
8 mol/l and 10–9 mol/l respectively; no dextramer binding to CD8+ 
T-cells was observed when loaded with irrelevant TCR (Figure 2e). 
This indicated that at optimal concentrations for viral inhibition, 
ImmTAVs engaged the majority of available CD8+ T-cells.
ImmTAVs enhance the capacity of CD8+ T-cells from 
chronic HIV-infected subjects to reduce autologous 
HIV spread upon reactivation in vitro
We then assessed the antiviral potency of ImmTAVs against pri-
mary HIV isolates in CD4+ T-cells from patients with chronic 
infection. As phytohemagglutinin (PHA) is reported to induce 
consistent reactivation of latent HIV in primary cell cultures, we 
stimulated purified CD4+ T-cells from 10 HLA-A*0201+ chroni-
cally infected subjects (8 ART-treated and 2 ART-naive) with 
PHA for 72 hours and then cultured them with autologous puri-
fied CD8+ T-cells, alone or with ImmTAVs for 7 days.35 We have 
previously observed that PHA stimulation of CD4+ T-cells from 
37 ART-treated patients led to detectable HIV reactivation in 46% 
subjects, defined by Gag+ T-cells acquired in the CD3+CD8− gate 
exceeding the negative cut-off value of 41, (obtained from the 
mean +3 SD of Gag+ cells in unstimulated CD4+ T-cell cultures). 
We have also shown that Gag expression strongly correlated with 
the level of p24 antigen production measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay.34 To ensure reproducible HIV reactivation 
prior to ImmTAV exposure, we set a higher threshold requiring 
at least 100 Gag-positive cells in CD4+/CD8+ cell-only cultures. 
Both ImmTAVs (used at a concentration of 10–8 mol/l for a CD8+/
CD4+ ratio of 1:1 and 10–11 mol/l for a ratio of 1:10) enhanced the 
capacity of ex vivo CD8+ T-cells to block replication of autologous 
virus. At a CD8+/CD4+ ratio of 1:1, the mean (SD) reduction in 
p24 Ag+ cells observed with CD8+ T-cells alone was 49% (26%), 
which was consistent with data we obtained from 50 chronic

ART-treated patients with diverse HLA haplotypes (Yang H. and 
Dorrell L., unpublished data). In the presence of the ImmTAVs, 
mean (SD) reduction in p24 Ag+ cells was 60% (20%) for m121 
and 72% (14%) for m134 (P = 0.008 for m134) (Figure 3a). At a 
ratio of 1:10, the ImmTAVs showed similar antiviral effects: 55% 
(17%) for m121 and 55% (15%) for m134 versus 19% (17%) for

release by CD4+ T-cells when infected with HIV in vitro. (e) CFSE-labelled T2 cells were pulsed with 10 μmol/l SL9 peptide, irrelevant (influenza) pep-
tide or unpulsed, then cultured with healthy donor CD8+ T-cells with or without ImmTAV (1 nmol/l) for 24 hours and analyzed by flow cytometry.

of viral replication. Similar rates of live cell recovery were observed 
when comparing cultures with the irrelevant TCR-anti-CD3 scFV 
fusion at 10–9 mol/l, m121 and m134 at either 10–9 or 10–8 mol/l 
and CD8+ T-cells alone (Supplementary Figure S1). The irrel-
evant TCR was therefore used at concentrations of 10–9 mol/l or 
lower in all subsequent experiments.
ImmTAV-redirected CD8+ T-cells from healthy 
donors have superior capacity to reduce spread of 
reactivated HIV in CD4+ T-cells from HIV-positive 
ART-treated subjects
Persistent defects in the effector function of CD8+ T-cells specific 
for HIV and other antigens are well documented in patients on 
long-term ART.36–38 To investigate whether this could explain the 
modest effects of the ImmTAVs when used to redirect patient-
derived CD8+ T-cells, particularly at the 1:1 CD8+/CD4+ ratio, 
we cocultured CD8+ T-cells from healthy HIV-uninfected donors 
with reactivated CD4+ T-cells from the same ART-treated HIV-
positive subjects, with or without ImmTAVs. Healthy donor 
CD8+ T-cells were able to reduce p24 Ag+ cells by >80% when 
redirected by ImmTAVs at a concentration of 10–8 mol/l and 
CD8+/CD4+ cell ratio of 1:1 (mean (SD) for m121 – 87% (6%); 
m134 – 82% (11%); P < 0.0001) (Figure 4a). The ImmTAVs were 
also tested at 10–9 mol/l to rule out the possibility of any nonspe-
cific binding to HLA-A2-self peptide complexes (which had been 
observed at 10–8 mol/l with HLA-A*0201-positive human cancer 
cells, Figure 1b). Spread of infection was reduced by >60% at this 
concentration (mean (SD) for m121 – 70.5% (17.8%); m134 – 62% 
(26%), P < 0.0001) (Figure 4a). A similar magnitude of effect was seen 
with a CD8+/CD4+ cell ratio of 1:10 and ImmTAV concentration 
of 10–11 mol/l (mean (SD) for m121 − 63% (23%); m134 – 71% 
(18%); P < 0.0001) (Figure 4b). In all experiments, the irrelevant 
TCR-anti-CD3 scFV fusion had minimal or no impact on HIV 
replication, nor did the CD8+ T-cells from healthy donors have 
any effect in the absence of ImmTAVs, ruling out any CD8+ T-cell 
killing by an allospecific mechanism.
Consequently, we interrogated the flow cytometric data to 
determine the number of conjugates forming between CD8+ 
T-cells and HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells (gating strategy is shown 
in Supplementary Figure S2). In most cases, we observed more 
frequent conjugates forming in the presence of healthy donor 
CD8+ T-cells than autologous CD8+ T-cells under all conditions 
tested; this could have contributed to the greater antiviral effects 
of the ImmTAVs when redirecting healthy donor CD8+ T-cells 
(see Supplementary Figure S3).
We also examined the effector capability of different CD8+ 
T-cell memory populations when redirected by an ImmTAV. CD8+ 
T-cells from one of the healthy donors were sorted into naive, cen-
tral memory, effector memory and terminally differentiated effec-
tor subsets and then added to PHA-activated CD4+ T-cells from 
two ART-treated patients. Because of the low frequency of central 
memory cells in the peripheral blood, a CD8+/CD4+ cell ratio 
of 1:2 was used for all subsets. Effector or effector memory cells 
showed the strongest capacity to reduce HIV infection when redi-
rected by an ImmTAV, similar to or exceeding the effect observed 
with bulk CD8+ T-cells, whereas central memory and naive cell 
subsets were less effective (Figure 4c). These results were consistent 
with previous observations on ImmTAC killing of cancer cells.26
Antiviral efficacy of ImmTAV-redirected CD8+ T-cells 
is dependent on rapid killing of infected cells
ImmTACs specific for a melanoma antigen have been shown to 
induce rapid killing of target cells, therefore, we wished to estab-
lish whether the antiviral effects of the ImmTAVs involved a lytic 
mechanism.26,27 We used three approaches to address this. First, 
we used flow cytometric analysis to identify CD8+/CD4+ T-cell 
conjugates as before, this time to quantify HIV-infected CD4+ 
T-cells that expressed caspase-3, which is activated in response 
to extrinsic apoptotic signals.39,40 We also demonstrated these 
conjugates by confocal microscopy (Figure 5a). We compared 
Figure 3 ImmTAV-mediated inhibition of autologous HIV spread in 
CD4+ T-cells from HIV-infected subjects. Purified CD4+ T-cells (1 × 105) 
from 10 HIV-positive HLA-A*0201+ subjects (8 ART-treated and 2 ART-
naive, represented by symbols shown above) were stimulated with PHA 
for 72 hours to promote replication of endogenous HIV, then cultured 
with autologous CD8+ T-cells at CD8+/CD4+ cell ratios of 1:1 (a) and

TCR-anti-CD3 scFV fusion (control TCR) was tested at 10–9 mol/l and 
10–12 mol/l for the 1:1 and 1:10 ratios respectively because of nonspecific 
cell death at higher concentrations. Reduction in Gag+ cells was deter-
mined on day 7 of coculture. Horizontal lines indicate mean values. HLA,

caspase-3 expression in uninfected CD4+ T-cells, infected singlet 
CD4+ T-cells and infected CD4+/CD8+ T-cell conjugates in the 
presence or absence of ImmTAVs. HIV-infected singlet CD4+ 
T-cells showed higher caspase-3 levels than uninfected CD4+ 
T-cells, suggestive of a recent ImmTAV-mediated death signal or 
possibly a direct effect of HIV. Caspase-3 expression was signifi-
cantly increased in infected CD4+ T-cells forming conjugates with 
CD8+ T-cells exposed to ImmTAVs (mean (SD) for 10–8 mol/l − 
m121 − 41% (11.5%), m134 – 44% (4%); 10–9 mol/l − m121 − 48% 
(12%), m134 – 53% (8%); CD4+/CD8+ T-cell conjugates with-
out ImmTAVs – 15% (3%); P < 0.0001) (Figure 5b). Caspase-3 
expression was not upregulated above background levels in the 
presence of the irrelevant TCR-anti-CD3 scFV fusion.
Next, we performed cell cultures in which the medium was 
replaced after 48 hours in order to wash out any unbound TCR; the 
m134 TCR was used for these experiments because of its shorter 
binding half-life (8.6 hours) than m121 (Figure 1a). Cultures were 
maintained for a further 5 days, after which the proportion of 
infected cells remaining was compared with cultures in which the 
medium was not changed. Infected cell frequencies at day 7 did 
not differ significantly between cultures in which the ImmTAVs 
were present for the duration or for the first 48 hours only (P = 
0.68), indicating that the effect of the ImmTAV was irreversible 
and had reached a maximum by 48 hours (Figure 5c).
Finally, to confirm that Gag-expressing CD4+ T-cells were elim-
inated upon ImmTAV exposure, we treated HIV-infected cells with 
a reverse transcriptase inhibitor to stop HIV spread via produc-
tion of new virions during culture (see Supplementary Figure S4). 
CD4+ T-cells from 3 ART-treated patients and 3 healthy donors 
were first stimulated with PHA, to reactivate latent virus or permit 
in vitro infection, respectively. They were then treated with tenofo-
vir or left untreated for 48 hours, after which they were cocultured 
with CD8+ T-cells +/− ImmTAV for a further 48 hours (see schema 
in Figure 5d). The ImmTAV was observed to eliminate 50–78% 
of HIV-infected cells within 48 hours in the presence of tenofovir, 
whether they were infected in vitro or in vivo (Figure 5d). A higher 
proportion of infected cells was eliminated by the ImmTAV when 
tenofovir was absent (mean 88% versus 66%, P = 0.0006). A likely 
explanation for this is a reduction in Gag epitope generation follow-
ing tenofovir treatment, which is an expected downstream effect of 
inhibition of reverse transcription. Consistent with this, tenofovir 
had no effect on infected cell  
elimination by the TCR-anti-CD3 
scFV fusion (mean 8% versus 5%, P = 0.48), Figure 5d) and Gag 
mean fluorescence intensity was slightly lower in tenofovir-treated 
than untreated cells (see Supplementary Figure S5). Overall, these 
data confirmed that the HIV ImmTAVs were able to kill in vitro- 
and in vivo-infected CD4+ T-cells.
The antiviral effect of ImmTAVs is determined by the 
level of target cell epitope expression
Given that latently infected CD4+ T-cells in the peripheral blood 
may vary in sensitivity to viral reactivation with a polyclonal 
stimulus and that some expression of Gag proteins has been dem-
onstrated in the absence of productive infection, ex vivo CD4+ 
T-cells from ART-treated patients are likely to be heterogeneous 
with respect to the expression of HIV epitopes.41–43 In view of this, 
we hypothesized that elimination of these cells by the ImmTAVs 
would depend on both the activation state of the infected cell and

the density of cognate epitope on the cell surface. We investigated 
this in three ways.
First, we repeated the coculture experiments using PHA-
stimulated CD4+ T-cells from 5 HIV-positive ART-treated 
subjects and CD8+ T-cells from a single healthy donor, with or 
without ImmTAV. After 7 days, we quantified activated (CD25+/
CD69+/HLA-DR+) and resting (CD25−/CD69−/HLA-DR−) 
CD4+ T-cells in cultures with CD8+ T-cells alone and CD8+ 
T-cells with ImmTAV. Under all experimental conditions, the 
proportion of p24 Ag+ cells was higher in activated than resting 
CD4+ T-cells, yet the absolute number of p24 Ag+ cells among 
resting cells exceeded that in activated CD4+ T-cell populations 
because there were many more resting than activated cells over-
all (Figure 6a and Supplementary Figure S6). Unexpectedly, the 
ImmTAV eliminated not only the vast majority of activated CD4+ 
T-cells in cultures exposed to the ImmTAV for only 48 hours 
(mean (SD) − 95% (3%)) but also most of the resting cells, albeit to 
a lesser extent (mean (SD) – 87% (4%), P <0.0001). Furthermore, 
the fraction of infected cells that was eliminated was similar 
between cultures with ImmTAV for 48 hours and 7 days (mean 
(SD) for both activated and resting cells at 7 days – 94% (4%) 
and 85% (5%) respectively, not significant), indicating that the 
ImmTAV exerted maximal effect in the first 48 hours, regardless 
of the activation state of the target cell (Figure 6a,b). We analyzed 
the level of HIV Gag expression in the CD4+ T-cells remaining 
at the end of 7 days’ co-culture with CD8+ T-cells +/− ImmTAV. 
 
As expected, Gag expression was significantly lower in resting 
cells than activated cells overall (P = 0.002), particularly when 
comparing cultures without ImmTAVs (Figure 6c, ‘CD8+ only’). 
Of note, the few residual activated cells in the ImmTAV-treated 
cultures showed significantly lower Gag expression than the 
remaining activated cells in the CD8+ cell-only cultures, con-
sistent with rapid ImmTAV-mediated elimination of Gaghi cells. 
By contrast, Gag expression in resting cells was similar among 
populations cultured with or without ImmTAV and was consis-
tently lower than in activated cells (Figure 6c). Overall, these data

mol/l), which was either present throughout the culture period or washed out by replacing the culture medium after 48 hours. Reduction in Gag+

suggested that the level of Gag expression in both activated and 
resting cells was sufficient to render them susceptible to killing 
but that Gaghi cells were preferentially killed. In support of this, 
we observed a strong correlation between Gag expression, mean 
fluorescence intensity and % reduction in infected cells (r2 = 0.86, 
P < 0.0001) (Figure 6d).
In parallel, we performed a direct quantification of epitope 
presentation on the surface of infected CD4+ T-cells, compris-
ing activated and resting cells, using a biotinylated version of 
the m134 ImmTAV to visualize peptide-HLA complexes at the 
single cell level. This method has been shown previously to be 
suitable for the detection of low numbers of epitopes on can-
cer cells (5–150 per cell).32,33 The data shown in Figure 6e were 
obtained following infection of CD4+ T-cells from two donors; 
in both cases ~20% of HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells were positive 
for ImmTAV staining. This was in agreement with the frequency 
of p24 Ag+ cells detected concurrently by flow cytometry (27.6% 
p24+ cells for donor 1 and 21.7% p24+ cells for donor 2) and con-
trasted with the low level of staining observed with uninfected 
cells. In addition, staining observed with an irrelevant biotinyl-
ated TCR-anti-CD3 scFV fusion was similar to that of uninfected 
cells (data not shown). Of those cells that stained positive with 
ImmTAV, between 8 and 46 epitopes were observed on individual 
cells. These data indicate that the ImmTAVs are capable of induc-
ing T-cell killing despite a very low level of epitope presentation 
on infected cells.
ImmTAV-redirected CD8+ T-cells clear autologous 
inducible HIV from resting CD4+ T-cells
As the previous experiments were performed with unfraction-
ated CD4+ T-cells from ART-treated patients, we modified our 
coculture assay in order to investigate whether resting HIV-
infected cells could be eliminated by the ImmTAVs after reac-
tivation of latent HIV. Resting CD4+ cells were isolated from 
three patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and 
stimulated with PHA for 72 hours, then cultured with healthy 
CD8+ T-cells alone, or with ImmTAVs for 14 days. Irradiated 
feeders were added to support the replication of autologous 
viruses. Infected cell elimination was again quantified by flow 
cytometry. In  
addition, supernatants were tested for p24 Ag 
release. The supernatants from purified resting CD4+ T-cells 
cultured alone for 14 days after reactivation were positive for 
Figure 6 ImmTAV-mediated elimination of activated and resting HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells. Purified PHA-stimulated CD4+ T-cells from the same 
five HLA-A*0201-positive ART-treated patients as in Figure 5 were cultured with healthy donor CD8+ T-cells alone or with ImmTAV m134 (10–8 
mol/l). The ImmTAV was either present for the duration of coculture or washed out after 48 hours. (a) The number of activated (CD25+/CD69+/

ing that new virions had been produced. ImmTAV-redirected 
CD8+ T-cells were able to eliminate the majority of reactivated 
p24 Ag+ CD4+ T-cells in all three subjects (mean 70% for m121 
versus 22% for the TCR-anti-CD3 scFV fusion) (Figure 7a–c). 
Finally, to evaluate ImmTAV-redirected killing after in vitro 
reactivation of HIV without global T-cell activation, we treated 
ex vivo purified resting CD4+ T-cells from five ART-treated 
patients with a combination of LRAs—romidepsin, a histone 
deacetylase inhibitor and bryostatin, a PKC agonist for 6 hours, 
followed by culture with healthy donor CD8+ T-cells alone or 
with an ImmTAV for a further 42 hours. LRA treatment led to 
induction of HIV replication, indicated by detectable viral RNA 
in culture supernatants that exceeded >1000 copies/ml in all five 
patients (Figure 7d). Exposure to ImmTAV after viral reactiva-
tion led to a complete abrogation of viral recovery in four out of 
five patients whereas exposure to the control TCR reduced viral 
recovery marginally, except in one patient (Figure 7d).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have shown that engineered immune-mobilising 
HIV-specific TCR anti-CD3 fusion proteins mediate killing of 
CD4+ T-cells from HIV-infected ART-treated individuals upon 
in vitro reactivation of latent virus. The development of these 
ImmTAVs was predicated on the generation and selection of TCR 
candidates with picomolar affinity for pMHC and the capacity to 
recognize all naturally occurring variants of the cognate epitope. 
This technology therefore has the potential to address two major 
challenges that the adaptive immune system faces when respond-
ing to antigens derived from reactivated HIV in latently infected 
cells, namely, the release of viral escape mutants and low levels 
of antigen expression.20,25 Here, we have shown for the first time 
that upon specific interaction with cell surface HLA class I-viral 
peptide complexes, the ImmTAVs were capable of mobilising and 
activating the majority of effector CD8+ T-cells in the vicinity 
of the infected cell via CD3 signaling. The capacity to harness a 
large number of immune effector cells simultaneously is another 
advantage of ImmTAV technology that may provide superior 
antiviral efficacy to naturally primed cytotoxic T-cells. In vitro 
efficacy of a similar technology comprising dual-affinity retarget-
ing proteins, which engage HIV-infected target cells via specific 
monoclonal antibodies, was demonstrated recently using resting 
CD4+ T-cells from ART-treated patients.44 However, the affinity 
of the HIV binding arm of these agents is still considerably 
lower (50–200 fold) than the TCR component of the ImmTAVs 
described here. Furthermore, they are targeted to Env epitopes 
which are expressed at lower densities than Gag on both activated 
and resting cells and are highly variable in sequence.
We have shown that ImmTAV-redirected polyclonal autolo-
gous CD8+ T-cells eliminated HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells more 
efficiently than the patients’ naturally primed CD8+ T-cells spe-
cific for the same Gag epitope, SL9, which typically account for ≤ 
2% CD8+ T-cells in chronically infected subjects.8,45 These find-
ings were expected in the light of previously reported tumor-lytic 
effects of melanoma antigen-specific ImmTACs.26 In some indi-
viduals, the ImmTAVs conferred on autologous CD8+ T-cells a 
level of lytic capacity that was similar to naturally primed HIV-
specific CD8+ T-cells from elite controllers.46 However, stronger 
ImmTAV-mediated killing was observed in all subjects when 
CD8+ T-cells were derived from healthy HIV-uninfected donors, 
which suggests that persistent functional defects affecting all 
CD8+ T-cells were present in chronic ART-treated subjects. This 
is perhaps not surprising, given that ART greatly reduces but does 
not normalize the expression of immune checkpoint molecules 
such as PD-1 and TIM-3 in all CD8+ T-cells.47,48 This suggests 
that synergistic approaches combining ImmTAVs with agents to 
correct intrinsic CD8+ T-cell dysfunction may be necessary to 
achieve maximal therapeutic effect.
We observed that ImmTAVs eliminated the majority of HIV-
infected CD4+ T-cells that expressed markers of recent activa-
tion, CD25, CD69 and HLA-DR. This was expected, since HIV 
replication, and consequently antigen expression, is greatest in 
activated CD4+ T-cells.49 A surprising observation was that the 
majority of resting infected cells present in the same cultures 
were also killed. Consistent with their lack of expression of acti-
vation markers, expression of Gag was also lower in these cells 
compared with activated cells, which could explain their relatively 
reduced susceptibility to killing. However, we did not observe a 
linear association between the expression of Gag and of activation 
markers on endogenously HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells. Expression 
of Gag in the absence of productive infection has been reported 
in a superinfection model and in ex vivo CD4+ T-cells from ART-
treated patients. These so called “Gag-positive reservoir cells” 
appear to be rare but were nevertheless susceptible to CD8+ T-cell 
killing, which suggests a possible explanation for our results.43,50 
Alternatively, the Gag-positive resting cells that we identified 
could represent cells that were infected while in transition to the 
resting state and the Gag proteins detected were from incoming 
virions.51
We observed a strong correlation between Gag mean fluo-
rescence intensity and susceptibility of Gag-positive cells to 
ImmTAV-mediated killing, which suggested that intracellular Gag 
was a useful proxy for cognate Gag epitope density on the infected 
cell surface. Direct quantification of HIV SL9 epitopes on the cell 
surface indicated that <50 were present on primary CD4+ T-cells 
that were infected in vitro after polyclonal activation. It was not 
possible to perform this analysis on ex vivo CD4+ T-cells from 
patients due to the limits of detection with the fluorescence micros-
copy approach used. However, by purifying resting CD4+ T-cells 
from ART-treated patients and reactivating latent HIV in vitro, 
we were able to confirm that ImmTAV-redirected CD8+ T-cells 
were able to reduce viral recovery from these latently infected cells 
even though the density of SL9 epitopes was likely to be consid-
erably lower under such conditions than after in vitro infection. 
Collectively, these observations indicated that ImmTAV-mediated 
killing was highly efficient, although nevertheless dependent on 
the density of HLA class I-HIV peptide complexes on the infected 
cell surface. This has implications for the use of ImmTAVs to kill 
infected CD4+ T-cells in vivo. Circulating HIV-infected CD4+ 
T-cells are largely in a resting state and may be heterogeneous in 
terms of viral protein expression when treated with LRAs. To sum-
marize, ImmTAVs are most effective against activated cells though 
they also mediate elimination of resting cells that are expected to 
present very low viral antigen concentrations, which may reflect 
the level of antigen expression on a subset of HIV reservoir cells 
in vivo.
Our study has shown the translational potential of ImmTAVs 
for combating HIV infection; however, for this to be fully real-
ized, several issues need to be resolved. First, we assessed killing 
of infected cells upon recognition of a single HLA class I-bound 
HIV epitope. To achieve clinically useful effects on the latent res-
ervoir, multiple TCRs targeting diverse viral epitopes might be 
required. However, this must be balanced with the risk of off-target 
effects when using a cocktail of ImmTAVs, which would need care-
ful consideration during development. Second, the potency of the 
ImmTAVs was lower when they were used at a concentration of 
10–9 mol/l, despite similar levels of caspase-3 expression in targeted 
CD4+ T-cells to those observed at ImmTAV concentrations of 10–8 
mol/l. HLA restricted cross-reactivity can be detected with tumor 
targeting ImmTACs at concentrations >10–9 mol/l. The potential 
for cross-reactivity is determined in part by the extent to which 
peptide mimics are expressed in the human genome, which can be 
assessed using a combination of in silico and in vitro methods.26,27,52

Enhanced T-cell Receptors Clear HIV-infected Cells
A systematic approach involving a molecular level analysis of TCR 
binding to peptide variants to define a recognition motif, database 
searches to identify proteins containing the motif and empirical 
testing for TCR reactivity using a panel of HLA-matched anti-
gen-negative primary cell lines for TCR reactivity is being used 
routinely as a predictor of clinical safety, with clinical evidence 
supporting this strategy.53 Assays to screen for reactivity against 
HLA-mismatched cell lines, platelets and even whole blood can 
also minimize the risk of induction of alloreactivity or a cytokine 
storm. These approaches may be more informative than preclinical 
testing in animal models for HIV. For example, an ImmTAV spe-
cific for a monkey MHC allele would be required for evaluation in 
the SIV model and would have limited predictive value for human 
HLA-TCR interactions. HLA-humanized mouse models circum-
vent this particular issue but cannot provide adequate assurance 
of safety in humans since variation at a single residue within the 
target peptide can be sufficient to abrograte TCR binding.53 An 
important distinction between soluble bispecific TCRs and TCR-
transduced T-cells (which led to fatality) is that dosing can be more 
tightly controlled with the former.52 Safe dosing may involve mul-
tiple administrations of the ImmTAV in order to achieve a clini-
cally significant impact on the viral reservoir, in a similar manner 
to the treatment of melanoma.30 Finally, in vivo studies may need to 
address whether adequate ImmTAV concentrations can be attained 
in relevant tissues. Murine and non-human primate models have 
shown that the outcome of persistent viral infections was highly 
dependent on the number and timing of CD8+ T-cell effectors that 
colocalized with virus-infected targets in lymphoid tissues.54 The 
frequency of circulating HIV-infected cells is very low (from <1/
million to ~1/10,00055) but the majority of HIV-infected cells are 
found in lymphoid tissues in vivo, particularly in germinal centers 
where they may be inaccessible to CD8+ T-cells, and also in other 
tissue compartments that are known to be poorly penetrated by 
antiretroviral drugs.56,57 Reassuringly, ImmTACs against mela-
noma antigens were able to localize to tumor sites after intravenous 
(i.v.) administration in murine models and tumor shrinkage with 
an ImmTAV has been observed in the clinic.27,30
In summary, we have shown in a clinically relevant in vitro 
system that ImmTAVs specific for an immunodominant HIV Gag 
epitope have potent antiviral effects against CD4+ T-cells harbor-
ing diverse primary HIV isolates. We conclude that ImmTAVs are 
promising agents that could form a component of HIV eradica-
tion strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and primary cells. Mel526 cells were obtained from Thymed, 
J82 and T2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. 
PBMC were isolated by density gradient separation. CD4+ and CD8+ 
T-cells were enriched from PBMC by negative selections using magnetic 
bead immunodepletion, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (MACS, Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, UK). In selected experiments, 
freshly isolated CD8+ T-cells were sorted into memory subsets on a 
MoFlo cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) using CD8-APC, CCR7-
PE-Cy7, and CD45RA-PE antibodies (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). 
Resting CD4+ T-cells were isolated from ART-treated HLA-A*0201-
positive subjects by depletion of CD8+ T-cells as described above, fol-
lowed by labelling of cells expressing CD25, CD69, and HLA-DR using 
PE-conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences) and depletion using anti-PE 
beads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Surface plasmon resonance. Purified ImmTAVs were subjected to sur-
face plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis on a BIAcore3,000 as described 
previously.26 Briefly, biotinylated pMHC monomers were immobilized 
on streptavidin-coupled CM-5 sensor chips up to 100 RU and biotin-
blocked. Equilibrium binding constants and dissociation rate constants 
were calculated using the BIAevaluation software.
Production of ImmTAVs. TCR isolation and engineering to produce 
ImmTAV reagents have been described previously.26,58 In brief, phage 
display affinity maturation was performed using the native SL9 pep-
tide to select alternative affinity enhanced variants of the wild-type 
TCR described in Varela-Rohena et al. (2008). To produce ImmTAVs, 
soluble, disulphide linked TCRs fused to anti-CDR3 and incorporating 
the affinity-enhanced alpha and beta chains were expressed as inclu-
sions bodies in Escherichia coli and subsequently refolded and purified 
(reviewed in ref. 53). Recognition of the following SL9 escape variants: 
SLYNTIATL, SLYNTIAVL, SLYNTVAVL, SLFNTIATL, SLFNTIAVL, 
SLFNTVATL, and SLFNTVAVL by the wild-type TCR has been dem-
onstrated previously.20
IFN-γ ELISpot assays. Interferon (IFN)-γ ELISpot assays were per-
formed as previously described and according to the manufacturer’s 
 
instructions.26 Briefly, target cells and effector cells were cultured at 
5 × 104 cells/well and 8 × 104 cells/well respectively. Effector cells were 
tested with and without ImmTAVs at various concentrations. Plates 
were incubated overnight at 37 °C / 5% CO2 and quantified after devel-
opment using an automated ELISpot reader (Immunospot Series 5 
Analyzer, Cellular Technology). EC50 values were determined from 
nonlinear fitting of data obtained with titrated ImmTAV concentrations 
using Graphpad Prism version 6 software.
CFSE-based cytolytic T-cell assay. T2 cells were labelled with Carboxy-
fluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (1μmol/l) for 5 minutes and 37 
°C. Labelling was quenched with warm RPMI supplemented with 10% 
fetal calf serum (R10) and cells were pulsed with peptide (10 μmol/l) 
in serum-free medium for 5 hours. After washing off unbound peptide, 
they were cocultured with healthy donor CD8+ T-cells (1:1 ratio) +/− 
ImmTAV (1 nmol/l) for 24 hours and then analyzed by flow cytometry. 
Labelling efficiency was confirmed to be 100%. Specific lysis was deter-
mined from the formula: 1 – (% CFSEhi cells in ImmTAV-treated sample) 
/ (% CFSEhi cells in sample without ImmTAV) × 100%.
Dextramer analysis. Purified CD8+ T-cells from a healthy donor were 
incubated with ImmTAVs at various concentrations, together an HLA-
A*0201-SL9 dextramer conjugated to PE (Immudex, Copenhagen, 
Denmark) for 20 minutes at 37 °C. Cells were then stained with Aqua live/
dead (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), CD3-APC-Cy7 (Biolegend, London, 
UK) and CD8-APC (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry. 
All cytometric analyses were performed on a CyAn flow cytometer and 
analyzed using FlowJo (version 9.2).
Exogenous HIV infection and reactivation of endogenous HIV in 
patient-derived CD4+ T-cells. The laboratory-adapted CXCR4-tropic 
clade B isolate, IIIB, was obtained from the Programme EVA Centre for 
AIDS Reagents, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control 
(NIBSC), a center of the Health Protection Agency, UK. CD8-depleted 
PBMC (hereafter referred to as CD4+ cells) were stimulated with PHA (5 
µg/ml) in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS (R10) for 3 
days, washed and infected with HIV IIIB at a multiplicity of infection of 
1 × 10−2 by spinoculation for 2 hours at 25 °C, as described previously.34 
Endogenous HIV in PBMC from HIV-positive subjects was reactivated 
by stimulation of purified CD4+ T-cells with PHA (5 µg/ml) in R10 for 3 
days. In selected experiments, reactivation of latent HIV in purified rest-
ing CD4+ T-cells was achieved by treatment with bryostatin-1 (10 nmol/l, 
Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and romidepsin (40 nmol/l, Cambridge 
Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) at 37 °C for 6 hours.

Viral inhibition / infected cell elimination assay. After spinoculation or 
reactivation, HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells were washed and cultured in 
duplicate (1 × 105 cells/well) in R10 supplemented with IL-2 (20 IU/ml), 
either alone or with purified CD8+ T-cells with and without ImmTAVs 
for 7 days. An irrelevant tumor-specific ImmTAC was used as a control 
for specificity. The frequency of infected cells was determined by intra-
cellular staining for Gag p24 Ag, optimized for sensitivity and specific-
ity, as described previously.34,59 Viral inhibition / infected cell elimination 
was calculated by normalizing to data obtained with no ImmTAVs, using 
the formula: (fraction of Gag+ cells in CD4+ T-cells cultured with CD8+ 
T-cells alone – fraction of Gag+ in CD4+ T-cells cultured with CD8+ 
cells plus ImmTAV) / fraction of p24+ cells in CD4+ T-cells cultured 
with CD8+ T-cells alone × 100%. In selected experiments, CD4+ T-cells 
were analyzed for expression of caspase-3 or activation markers CD25, 
CD69, and HLA-DR using PE-conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences). 
To confirm productive infection in patients’ CD4+ T-cells after in vitro 
reactivation of latent HIV, culture supernatants were tested for free p24 
Ag by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described previously.34 In 
experiments with latency reversing agents, viral outgrowth was assessed 
by amplification of HIV RNA in culture supernatants using QIAamp Viral 
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Manchester, UK) and quantification by reverse-tran-
scriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (RealStar HIV RT-PCR Kit 
1.0, Altona Diagnostic, Hamburg, Germany).
Confocal imaging. HIV IIIB-infected CD4+ T-cells were cultured for 6 
days, subjected to dead cell removal and then cocultured with purified 
CD8+ T-cells (1:2 ratio) +/− ImmTAVs (10–9 mol/l) on poly-L-lysine 
coated cover slips for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Cells were permeabilized and 
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by 0.2% Triton-X 100, blocked 
with 2.5% goat serum for 45 minutes, then stained with primary antibod-
ies to p24 Ag (37G12 directly conjugated to Aberior STAR 635P, St Louis, 
MO) and CD8 (rabbit anti-CD8a, followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit 
Alexa568, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Cover slips were mounted on slides 
using VectaShield mounting buffer and sealed. HIV infected CD4+ / 
CD8+ T-cell conjugates were visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal 
microscope with 63× oil objective.
Quantification of epitope presentation by microscopy. CD4+ T-cells 
obtained from two healthy volunteer donors were infected in vitro with 
HIV-1 IIIB, as described earlier, and stained with biotinylated m134 
ImmTAV (5 µg/ml) or irrelevant TCR in phosphate-buffered saline 
supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 400 nmol/l CaCl2 and 
400 nmol/l MgCl2 for 30 minutes at RT. Stained cells were then incu-
bated with PE-conjugated streptavidin (10 µg/ml) at RT for 20 min-
utes (BD Bioscience), fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, 
resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and plated on glass coverslip 
chambers. Phase-contrast and PE-fluorescence images were acquired as 
previously described using a Zeiss 200 mol/l/Universal Imaging system 
with a 63× objective.32 Z-stack fluorescent images were taken (27 indi-
vidual planes, 0.7 µm apart) to cover the entire 3D surface of the cell. The 
fluorescent spots corresponding to ImmTAV-PE bound to peptide-HLA 
complexes on each Z-stack were counted and summed to obtain the total 
count for each cell. In each experiment epitopes were quantified on at 
least 50 individual cells.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad 
Prism software (version 6.0). ImmTAV effects at different concentrations 
were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s post-test 
correction for multiple comparisons. Paired samples were analyzed using 
a paired t-test. Correlations were explored by determining the Pearson 
correlation coefficient. All tests were two-tailed and P values < 0.05 were 
considered significant.
Ethics statement and study participants. Blood samples from HIV-
positive subjects in this study were obtained with approval from UK 
Research Ethics Committees (Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee & 
Gene Therapy Advisory Committee) and written informed consent from 
all participants, prior to transfer to the Weatherall Institute of Molecular 
Medicine (WIMM, University of Oxford) Licensed Tissue Bank, in com-
pliance with the Human Tissue Act 2004. All except two subjects had 
received combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 months at the 
time of sampling, and had maintained undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA 
(<50 copies/ml) and CD4+ cell counts > 350 cells/µl. Two subjects were 
ART-naive with CD4+ cell counts > 350 cells/µl. PBMC were stored in 
vapour phase liquid nitrogen until use. Healthy HIV-uninfected donor 
PBMC were obtained from buffy coats supplied by the National Health 
Service Blood Transfusion Service, Bristol, UK or from the WIMM 
Licensed Tissue Bank.
