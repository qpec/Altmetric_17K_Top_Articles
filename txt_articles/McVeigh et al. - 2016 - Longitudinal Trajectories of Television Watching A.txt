ABSTRACT
Sedentary behaviors such as watching television (TV) are associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. The effects of TV
watching during key developmental stages on skeletal health are uncertain. Hours of TV watching/week were recorded by parental
or self-report at 5, 8, 10, 14, 17, and 20 years of age in 1181 members (48% female) of a pregnancy cohort (the Raine Study).
Participants were classified into one of three TV-watching trajectories (using latent class analysis): low (consistently <14 h/week;
20.3%), high (consistently �14 h/week; 44.4%), or increasing (increased from <14 to �14 h/week during adolescence; 35.3%).
General linear models tested associations between TV trajectory and bone mineral content (BMC) measured at age 20 years using
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. After adjustment for height, body mass, physical activity, calcium intake, serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, alcohol, and smoking (all at age 20 years), males in the low TV-watching trajectory had greater
BMC for whole body (mean � SEM, 3338 � 59 g versus 3111 � 31 g), legs (612 � 12 g versus 569 � 6 g), and arms (234 � 5 g versus
214 � 3 g) than those in the high TV-watching trajectory. Differences between low and high TV-watching trajectories were similar for
females. BMC in the increasing TV-watching trajectory also differed for both sexes, for example males in the increasing TV-watching
trajectory had greater whole-body BMC (3252 � 38 g) than males in the high TV-watching trajectory (3111 � 31 g) but less arm BMC
(218 � 3 g) than those in the low TV-watching trajectory (234 � 5 g). In this community-based cohort, consistently high TV watching
during childhood and adolescence independently predicted reduced peak bone mass at age 20 years. Because attainment of
optimal peak bone mass is protective against osteoporosis in later life, reducing sedentary time in children may have long-term
skeletal benefits. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Introduction
T
ime spent in sedentary behaviors has increased among all
age groups, largely due to the greater access and availability
of electronic media(1) and an increase in the percent of people
employed in sedentary occupations.(2) Television (TV) watching, a
ubiquitous behavior across the lifespan, is often used as a broad
marker of exposure to sedentary time.(3) The secular trend of time
spent watching TV by Australian children shows an increase from
113min/day in 1992 to 171min/day in 2006.(4,5) Several studies
have synthesized the evidence for the negative association
between TV watching and various cardiometabolic health
outcomes at specific life-course epochs, including early child-
hood(6) and adolescence(7); young adulthood;(8) and during later
adult years.(9) However, the risks to bone health of exposure to TV
watching over developmental life stages are largely unknown.
Adolescence is an important time for bone acquisition and
contributes a large proportion of the peak bone mass value
achieved by the end of skeletal development. Peak bone mass is
highly predictive of the risk of osteoporotic fracture in later
life(10) and attainment of an optimal peak bone mass is
considered the best protection against future fracture.(11)

 Whole-body bone mineral content (BMC) as assessed by dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) reaches a plateau between
18 and 20 years of age,(12) so measurement at the age of 20 years
may be optimal in determining peak bone mass achieved at
skeletal maturity.(13)
The results of cross-sectional studies on the association of TV
watching and bone health (assessed using DXA) in children and
adolescents havebeen differentfor malesandfemales.(14–19)These
contrasting findings could in part be due to important covariates
such as body size(20) (a primary determinant of BMC)(21) and other
lifestylefactorsknowntoaffectbonemassnotbeingaccountedfor
in these studies.(15) In a recent study using peripheral quantitative
computed tomography (pQCT), Gabel and colleagues(22) showed
no association between screen time and bone architecture,
volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), or bone strength in
healthy male and female youths and young adults.
Longitudinal studies have shown more consistent findings on
the negative influence of TV watching on bone health in children
and adolescents. Wosje and colleagues(23) found that children
who spent less than 2 hours per day watching TV had greater
gains in bone area and BMC (after adjustment for race, sex,
baseline age, final visit height or lean mass, and calcium intake)
from ages 3.5 to 7 years. Two other longitudinal studies,
spanning a 2-year period, examined the relationship between
sedentary time (measured using accelerometry) and bone mass
around the early and mid-pubertal period, and reported
sedentary time to have an negative effect on femoral neck
BMD (after adjustment for age, height, and lean body mass)(24)
and whole-body BMC (after adjustment for height, puberty, and
bone area at follow-up, and sex).(25) Only one longitudinal study
has examined the relationship between TV watching in
childhood and peak bone mass. In a study of 693 (341 with
complete data) American females, TV watching prior to puberty
was inversely associated with bone mass (after adjustment for
race, height, and body mass) in early adulthood.(26)
The studies mentioned in the previous paragraph have
differed in their approach to accounting for differences in
variables related to growth, sex, methods of assessing bone
mass and physical activity levels, study design, and statistical
analyses. Furthermore, although these studies lend support to
the contention that sedentary time is negatively associated with
bone health, none have examined a longer period of bone mass
acquisition from early childhood to early adulthood, nor has the
cumulative effect of TV watching over critical developmental
periods been considered.
In a pregnancy cohort of young people in Western Australia,
we previously identified three distinct TV-watching trajectories
between 5 and 20 years of age: high TV watchers (consistently
�14 h/week), increasing TV watchers (increasing hours of TV
watching during adolescence), and low TV watchers (consis-
tently <14 h/week).(27) The aim of the current study was to
investigate the relationship between TV-watching trajectories
(that capture distinct and potentially meaningful patterns) and
peak bone mass measured at 20 years. We hypothesized that the
low TV watchers would have a higher bone mass at age 20 years
than participants in the high TV-watching trajectory.
Subjects and Methods
Participants
Participants for this study were part of The Western Australian
Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study (www.rainestudy.org.au).(28)
Briefly, 2900 pregnant women attending a public antenatal
clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, or nearby private
practices, were recruited into the Raine Study between
May 1989 and November 1991. Serial assessments in utero, at
birth, and at ages 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 14, 17, and 20 years were made
on the offspring, although the number of participants at each
point of follow-up varied. Informed, written consent to
participate in the study was obtained from the mother of
each child at enrolment and at each subsequent follow-up until
the children achieved majority and provided their own consent.
The research presented in this article complied with the World
Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki–Ethical Principles for
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. The study proto-
cols were approved by the institutional ethics committee of
Curtin University (HR 23/2013) and the University of Western
Australia (RA/4/1/2646 and RA/4/1/2100).
At the 20-year follow-up, 1565 participants took part.
Complete data for TV watching, bone mass, physical activity,
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), dietary calcium intake,
smoking habits, and alcohol consumption were available for
1181 (76%) participants, who were included in the present study
(Supplementary Fig. 1). These participants did not differ
significantly by BMI at age 5 years (p ¼ 0.543) or family income
at age 5 years (p ¼ 0.457) from those excluded because of
incomplete data However, the percentage of females included
in the present study was higher than those who were excluded
at age 20 years (48% versus 37%, p ¼ 0.011) (Supplementary
Table 1).
Anthropometric and bone mass measures
Height and body mass were measured in all participants to the
nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg on a stadiometer (Seca, Hanover, MD)
and an automatic electronic scale (Personal Precision scales
UC-321; A and D Company). Measurements were performed
according to standardized procedures, wearing light clothing
without shoes. BMI was calculated as body mass (kg) divided by
height squared (m2). At age 20 years, a whole-body DXA scan
(Norland XR-36 densitometer; Norland Medical Systems, Inc.,
Fort Atkinson, WI, USA) was performed according to manufac-
turer-recommended procedures using built-in software (version
4.3.0). The whole-body scan was used to derive measures of
BMC, bone area, and BMD. The whole-body scan also enabled
the assessment of whole-body lean and fat tissue mass (g)
and percent body fat. All analyses were checked for consistency
and daily calibration was performed on the DXA machine prior
to each scanning session. The densitometer had a variation in
precision of <2.0% for the whole-body scan at standard speed.
Serum 25(OH)D
At the 20-year follow-up, participants provided a fasting blood
sample for the analysis of serum 25(OH)D concentrations.
Venous blood samples were taken from an antecubital vein after
an overnight fast and samples were stored at –80°C until
analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrom-
etry (RDDT Victoria, Australia), according to published meth-
ods.(29) Across all participants, blood samples were collected
year-round, so a sinusoidal model incorporating month of blood
collection was used to calculate deseasonalized serum 25(OH)D
concentrations. Serum calibration standards containing nominal
amounts of 25(OH)D2/25(OH)D3 from Chromsystems were used
to generate calibration curves. Tri-level quality control samples
containing 25(OH)D2/25(OH)D3 designated as Level Low, Level

 1 and Level 2 were purchased from UTAK Laboratories (PM
Separations). The coefficient of variation (CV) for 25(OH)D3 was
5.8% at 28 nmol/L, 5.2% at 80 nmol/L, and 9.2% at 188 nmol/L.
The CV for 25(OH)D2 was 7.9% at 25 nmol/L, 6.6% at 75 nmol/L,
and 10.4% at 185 nmol/L.(30)
Television watching
At ages 5, 8, and 10 years, parents reported the length of time
their child spent watching TV per day using a six-category
question with response options from “none” to “more than 3
hours” per day. At ages 14, 17, and 20 years, study participants
themselves responded to five-category questions about the
length of time they usually spent watching TV per day with
response options from “none at all” to “4 hours or more” per day.
Data were combined to create overall TV watching categories
across all six time points of: (1) 0 h/week; (2) less than 7 h/week;
(3) between 7 and 14 h/week; (4) between 14 and 21 h/week;
and (5) more than 21 h/week. The questions were derived from
the Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (ACTPANS).(31)
Latent class analysis was used to estimate trajectories of TV
watching using an ordinal logit model, which was appropriate
for the ordinal nature of the indicator variables: TV watching at 5,
8, 10, 14, 17, and 20 years.(27) Sex was used as an active covariate
in the models, and a series of models with between one and six
trajectories were estimated. Three trajectories were chosen
based on a combination of statistical criteria, parsimony, and
interpretability.(32) The following were considered: (1) the
minimum values of the goodness of fit measures Bayes
Information criteria (BIC), Akaike’s information criteria (AIC),
and the Consistent AIC (CAIC); (2) consideration of the
identification of the model in terms of the proportion of
random starts converging on the same solution; (3) boot-
strapped p value for the log-likelihood difference between
models where differences in BIC and AIC were similar; (4) the
degree to which the trajectory classes identified captured
distinct and potentially meaningful patterns in the data; and (5)
the quality of the model in terms of posterior probability
diagnostics, namely the entropy R2 value, average posterior
probability for each trajectory class, odds of correct classifica-
tion, and classification error. Participants were assigned to the
trajectory class for which they had the highest posterior
probability of membership. The trajectories of TV watching
were estimated using all available data; ie, 2411 participants
with one or more time points (over 15 years) reporting hours
spent watching TV per week as high TV watchers (consistently
�14 h/week), increasing TV watchers (increased from <14 to
�14 h/week
during
adolescence),
and
low
TV
watchers
(consistently
<14 h/week).
It
is
recommended
in
both
Australia(33) and the United States(34) that children should not
have more than 2 hours of screen time a day, and therefore
participants who spent more than 14 h/week of TV watching
were considered to be exceeding this guideline and were
classified as “high” TV watchers. The results presented in this
current study pertain only to the 1181 participants for whom
complete data (at age 20 years) were available, but the
percentage of participants in each TV-watching trajectory was
not significantly different from that of the whole cohort
(p ¼ 0.915).
Questionnaires
Physical activity was assessed at age 20 years, using the short
form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
(IPAQ-short), which has been shown to have acceptable
test-retest reliability (Spearman’s rho ¼ 0.76) and criterion
validity (Spearman’s rho ¼ 0.30), comparable to other self-
report measures.(35) Participants were asked to report the
number of days in the past week and the total time per day
(hours, minutes) of walking, moderate-intensity and vigorous-
intensity physical activity. Data were quality-controlled and
total weekly physical activity was then estimated by weighting
the reported minutes per week within each category (walking,
moderate or vigorous activity) by a metabolic equivalent (MET)
energy expenditure estimate assigned to each level of activity
(3.3, walking; 4.0, moderate; 8.0, vigorous) to obtain MET-
minutes per week (MET � min/week). The IPAQ-S also provided
data about time spent sitting.
A validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire,
the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies (DQES
v2) developed by the Cancer Council Victoria was self-
administered at the year 20 cohort assessment. In this cohort,
the questionnaire has been shown to correctly rank a
reasonable proportion of most nutrient intakes when com-
pared to a 3-day food diary.(36) The DQES v2 incorporates a
food list of 74 items and six types of alcoholic beverage. The
data collected by DQES v2 were used to calculate dietary
calcium intake. Participants who reported no alcohol intake
were compared with those who
reported
“sometimes.”
Participants reported if they currently smoke and the quantity
smoked by questionnaire. Participants that did not smoke
were compared with smokers.
Statistical analysis
Variables are presented as means � standard deviation (SD) or
numbers (percentage, %) stratified by sex and trajectories of TV
viewing. The statistical significance of participant characteristics
was examined using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
continuous
variables
or
chi-squared
test
for
categorical
variables. ANOVA and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with
Bonferroni post hoc comparisons was used to investigate
differences in BMC between TV-watching trajectories. All
analyses were weighted according to probability of membership
for assigned TV-watching trajectory. Data from males and
females were analyzed separately. Unadjusted analyses for
comparison
of
BMD
across
TV-watching
trajectories
are
presented in Tables 2 and 3, as are BMC comparisons across
trajectories unadjusted (model 1); adjusted for height and body
mass and bone area (model 2); and adjusted for height, body
mass, log-transformed physical activity scores (MET-min/week),
dietary
calcium
intake,
serum
25(OH)
D
levels,
alcohol
consumption, and smoking habits (model 3). Age was not
used as covariate, because DXA measurements were made at a
very narrow age range (SD ¼ 0.5 years) for all participants. A p
value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were performed using LatentGold Version 4.5 (Statisti-
cal Innovations Inc, Belmont, MA, USA) and SPSS v22 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
The trajectories of TV watching for the 1181 participants are
shown in Fig. 1. “High” TV watchers (44.4%) were characterized
by consistently high (>14 h/week) levels of TV watching
between age 5 and 20 years, “increasing” TV watchers (35.3%)
by a sharp increase in TV watching during adolescence, and

 “low” TV watchers (20.3%) by consistently lower (<14 h/week)
levels of TV watching. Sex was significantly associated
with trajectory class membership (p < 0.001), with females
comprising 42%, 48%, and 64% of high, increasing, and low TV
watching trajectories, respectively.
Table 1 shows descriptive variables at age 20 years of the
participants by sex and TV trajectory. There were no significant
differences
between
the
TV
trajectories
in
any
of
the
anthropometric and lifestyle variables listed in Table 1 for
both males and females, except that males in the high TV
watching trajectory had a significantly greater BMI than did
males in the increasing TV trajectory (p ¼ 0.048) and females in
the low TV watching trajectory had significantly lower fat mass
(p ¼ 0.017) than those in the high TV watching trajectory.
Males
There were no statistically significant differences across any of
the three TV-watching trajectories for males (all p > 0.05) for
unadjusted BMC values (model 1) or BMC values adjusted for
height, body mass, and bone area (model 2) at any site measured
(Table 2). However, in the fully adjusted model 3, males in the

 When bone area was included into model 3 (data not shown),
arm BMC in the low TV-watching trajectory (mean � SE,
228 � 4 g) was greater than in the increasing (217 � 3 g) and
high (217 � 2 g) TV-watching trajectories (p ¼ 0.033).
Females
There were no significant differences in BMC for females at any
site measured in the unadjusted analysis (model 1) and after
adjustment for height, body mass, and bone area (model 2),
except for that at the leg where females in the lowest TV-
watching trajectory has significantly greater BMC than those in
the highest TV-watching trajectory (p ¼ 0.03) in model 2
(Table 3). In the fully adjusted model 3, females in the low
TV-watching trajectory had significantly greater whole-body
(p ¼ 0.048), leg (p ¼ 0.018), and arm (p ¼ 0.050) BMC than those
in the high TV-watching trajectory (Table 3, Fig. 2). Females in
the increasing TV-watching trajectory had also had significantly
greater BMC at the whole-body (p ¼ 0.048) and leg (p ¼ 0.044)
than females in the high TV-watching trajectory (Fig. 2). There
were no statistically significant differences between the
three TV-watching trajectories (all p > 0.05) for BMD values at
any site measured (Table 3). There were no significant differ-
ences between trajectories nor site measured when bone area
was included in model 3 (data not shown).
Discussion
This is the first longitudinal study in a large, representative,
community-based sample to examine the associations between
TV watching during critical periods of development and peak
bone mass in young adults. We found that after adjustment for
relevant covariates, high levels of TV watching were associated
with lower BMC; conversely lower levels of TV watching were
associated with better bone health.

TELEVISION WATCHING IN CHILDHOOD/ADOLESCENCE PREDICTS BONE MASS AT AGE 20
2037
 The findings in this study were similar (in magnitude and
direction) for both males and females, consistent with cross-
sectional studies that have reported an inverse relationship
between TV watching and bone health for both sexes(15,37) as
well as with the only longitudinal study (in young children),
which reported greater gains in BMC for males and females in
those who watched less than 2 hours of TV per day.(23) Whereas
one cross-sectional study has shown no association between TV
watching and bone health in males or females,(22) two have
shown a relationship in males only(16,17) and one in females
only.(14,20) Interestingly, although Winther and colleagues(18)
reported a negative association between bone mass and TV
watching in males, they reported a positive association between
bone mass and TV watching in females, whereas our study found
a negative association in both sexes.
There are likely to be indirect and direct mechanisms that
influence the relationship between TV watching and bone mass.
This first is indirect, in that time spent watching TV might
displace engagement in osteogenic activities.(37) In addition,
there is evidence that consumption of foods with high energy,
fat, and sugar content (ie, carbonated drinks) might increase
during time spent watching TV,(38,39) and these food choices
may have a negative influence on bone health.(40) Second,
repeated exposure over childhood and adolescence to sitting in
front of the TV for long periods of time might directly result in
systemic physiological changes affecting bone metabolism,
similar to those observed in bed rest studies.(41) It is plausible
that the lack of mechanical loading inherent to sedentary
behavior may lead to an increase in bone resorption without
concomitant changes in bone formation and eventually result in
reduced BMC and an increased risk of osteoporosis.(42–44)
Further, it appears that moderate and vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) alone is not enough to prevent these changes in bone
metabolism; less sedentary behavior may also be required.(43,44)
As has been suggested by Chastin and colleagues,(37) the effects
of sedentary time (sitting in particular) might be most evident
for the unweighted regions. In the current study, the most
pronounced relationships between low levels of TV watching
and bone mass were observed for the BMC of the arms,
suggesting that this relatively unweighted site may indeed be
more sensitive to high volumes of sedentary activity than for a
weight bearing site such as the leg. In a study with children aged
9 to 16 years, a dose-response association of time spent
television, computer, and video viewing in both sexes and
forearm fracture risk was observed, which was independent of
bone mass and patterns of physical activity.(15) The authors
explained the possible mechanism by either adverse effect on
bone quality not measurable by DXA or behavioral or
psychosocial disturbances in children. The association between
TV watching and bone mass in our study was independent of
physical activity levels, indicating that the negative impact of TV
watching may not necessarily be offset by increased activity
levels. In addition, our study participants had reached skeletal
maturity; therefore, the results are less likely to be influenced by
differences in pubertal development.
In the current study females in the increasing trajectory (the
trajectory characterized by a peak in TV watching over the
adolescent years) had higher whole-body and leg BMC
compared to the high TV-watching trajectory, suggesting that
the prepubertal and early pubertal years are an important period
for bone mineral accrual in females. As in females, males in the
increasing TV-watching trajectory had greater whole-body BMC
than those in the high TV-watching trajectory. However, males in
the increasing TV-watching trajectory had less arm BMC than
those in the low TV-watching trajectory, suggesting that in
males the late-pubertal years may be more important for bone
accrual of non–weight bearing sites. The timing of pubertal
milestones are different in males and females, such as an earlier
attainment of peak height velocity in females than in males,(45)
and previous studies have suggested that prepubertal years are
an opportune time for incorporating physical activity to
promote bone health in girls because it is a period for increasing
periosteal apposition.(46) When bone area was further adjusted
in model 3, the differences between TV-watching trajectories
were no longer significant (data not shown), apart from at the
arm in males. Indeed, the greater BMC in the low TV-watching
trajectory might be a result of a larger bone size, and thus low
TV-watching may benefit bone strength through increased bone
size(47) rather than increased volumetric bone density.
The current study makes a key contribution to the literature
by providing the only longitudinal data assessing the indepen-
dent influence of sedentary time across long periods of growth
and development on peak bone mass. The only other study that
has examined the relationship between TV watching in
childhood and peak bone mass did not consider in their
analyses the cumulative effect of TV watching over important
developmental periods.(26) The findings of the current study are
in support of the hypothesis that prolonged periods of higher
levels of TV watching over childhood and adolescence are
associated with lower peak bone mass in young adulthood.
This study has a number of strengths and limitations. We
present a large longitudinal data set with repeated measures of
TV watching over critical periods of development. Further, the
sophisticated statistical techniques of latent class modeling
enabled trajectories spanning 15 years to be used in relation to
objective measurements of bone mass in male and female young
adults. An additional strength of our study is the consideration of
body size, bone area, and other important covariates, enabling
differential associations to be observed. Additionally, the BMC
measures made around skeletal maturity, as well as the narrow
age range of the study participants, minimizes the influence of
differences that may occur during the pubertal period. Nonethe-
less, although we adjusted for important covariates typically
considered in other bone and physical activity research, studying
the pathway of influence on the etiology of bone development of
these covariates was beyond the scope of this study; ie, whether
they were mediators or moderators or both was not considered.
The mechanistic pathways for these variables was not thefocus of
this work; rather, we were interested in the contribution that
longitudinal patterns of TV viewing behavior could have on bone
development. The complex and potentially time-varying inter-
actions of various influences is a topic for ongoing research. The
findingspresented inthis study could have been strengthenedby
the use of objective monitoring of sedentary time and physical
activity as well as assessment of the pattern of sedentary
exposure. The inherent limitations, such as overestimation and
underestimation and recall bias, of self-report questionnaires
must also be considered. It is unlikelythat the change from parent
to child report influenced the trajectories, because findings were
consistent using either parent-report (data not shown) or child-
report data at 14 years. Also, the use of site-specific DXA scans and
the inclusion of pQCT measurements (which are now able to

 comment on the associations of exposure to these variables and
bone mass during childhood and adolescence. Although there
are very high rates of follow-up for the Raine cohort, the potential
for selection bias in those participants who have remained in the
Raine Study must also be considered. There is a trend toward
greater participation in the year 20 follow-up in those who are
female and of higher socioeconomic status compared to the
participants seen at the year 20 follow-up, but for whom full data
sets were not available. Because our study used an observational
design, we cannot assume that the relationship between TV
watching and BMC is causal; intervention studies examining the
long-term impact of changes in TV watching would be
informative, but challenging to carry out.
In
summary,
these
community-based
findings
provide
evidence that young male and female adults with a history of
consistently watching TV for more than 14 hours per week have
a peak bone mass which is lower than for young adults who
spent less time than this watching TV. Achieving an optimal peak
bone mass remains the best way of offsetting the risks of
osteoporotic fracture in later life; therefore, a reduction in
sedentary time in children is an important public health
message because prolonged sedentary time may have long-
term negative impact on skeletal health.
