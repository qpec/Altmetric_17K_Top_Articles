 INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer 
deaths, with an estimated 1.8 million 
new diagnoses worldwide and 1.6 million 
deaths each year (2012).1 In 2012, there 
were 449 000 new cases of lung cancer and 
388 000 lung cancer deaths in the World 
Health Organization (WHO) Europe region. 
Lung cancer survival is different across 
countries, even when they have equally 
well-resourced healthcare systems. The 
UK and Denmark have the worst survival. 
Only 9.0% of people with a diagnosis of lung 
cancer in England survived for ≥5 years in 
2005–2009, although this improved to 12.9% 
in 2010–2012.2 In Denmark, survival is 
marginally better
. However, 5-year relative 
survival in Sweden and Canada exceeds 
15%.3,4 Both England and Denmark have 
a primary care-based healthcare system 
whose gatekeeper role may contribute to 
diagnostic delay.5 There is also evidence that 
some of this survival difference is explained 
by early deaths. This has led to a focus on 
early diagnosis to improve outcomes.6–8 
Lung cancer outcomes are so poor 
mainly because around 70% of patients first 
present to specialist care with advanced 
disease, at which point current treatment 
has little effect on mortality. This applies 
across all age groups and in all countries. 
Curative treatments for lung cancer are only 
available for those with cancers diagnosed 
in the early stages.
In England, the ‘Be Clear on Cancer’ 
campaign increased awareness of lung 
cancer symptoms and encouraged early 
presentation.9 The issue for primary care is 
how to approach the problem of recognising 
those most at risk. Merely doing more chest 
X-rays may not be the whole answer
. One 
study showed that practices with higher 
use of chest X-rays identified more patients 
who died within 90 days.10 What is needed is 
a way to recognise at-risk patients earlier, 
and investigate appropriately. The latest 
National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) guidance attempts to 
do this by recommending chest X-ray for 
people aged >40 years with two warning 
symptoms, or a history of smoking and 
one warning symptom.11 Although this 
approach may help, it has been suggested 
that multivariate risk prediction tools may 
be more accurate and cost-effective.12
The aim of this study was to conduct a 
systematic review of risk prediction tools 
for use in patients presenting in primary 
care with symptoms that may indicate 
lung cancer
. Throughout this article, the 
authors refer to models when considering 
the multivariate equations and their 
performance characteristics, and tools 
when considering the format aimed at 
clinical usage.
METHOD
The study was conducted in accordance 
with the methods outlined by the Cochrane 
Collaboration (Box 1).

Abstract
Background
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer 
deaths. Around 70% of patients first presenting 
to specialist care have advanced disease, at 
which point current treatments have little effect 
on survival. The issue for primary care is how 
to recognise patients earlier and investigate 
appropriately. This requires an assessment of the 
risk of lung cancer
. 
Aim
The aim of this study was to systematically review 
the existing risk prediction tools for patients 
presenting in primary care with symptoms that 
may indicate lung cancer
Design and setting
Systematic review of primary care data.
Method
Medline, PreMedline, Embase, the Cochrane 
Library, Web of Science, and ISI Proceedings 
(1980 to March 2016) were searched. The final list 
of included studies was agreed between two of 
the authors, who also appraised and summarised 
them.
Results
Seven studies with between 1482 and 2 406 127 
patients were included. The tools were all 
based on UK primary care data, but differed 
in complexity of development, number/type 
of variables examined/included, and outcome 
time frame. There were four multivariable 
tools with internal validation area under the 
curves between 0.88 and 0.92. The tools all had 
a number of limitations, and none have been 
externally validated, or had their clinical and 
cost impact examined.
Conclusion 
There is insufficient evidence for the 
recommendation of any one of the available risk 
prediction tools. However, some multivariable 
tools showed promising discrimination. What is 
needed to guide clinical practice is both external 
validation of the existing tools and a comparative 
study, so that the best tools can be incorporated 
into clinical decision tools used in primary care.

Lung cancer in symptomatic patients 
presenting in primary care: 
a systematic review of risk prediction tools
e396  British Journal of General Practice, June 2017
 RESULTS
The search of all the databases identified 
10 866 (before de-duplication) possibly 
relevant articles, with two further identified 
through contact with reviewers, of which 
10 821 articles were excluded based on 
title/abstract, and 46 were obtained for full-
text review. Seven studies reported in nine 
articles were included in this review,12–20 
while 38 were excluded for the following 
reasons: 
• review (n = 6); 
• patients, setting, or outcomes did not 
meet the inclusion criteria (n =25); 
• guideline (n = 2); 
• letter (n =1); 
• no original data (n =1); and 
• because not enough information could be 
extracted to include the study/ascertain 
relevance (n = 3).
The studies were all conducted in the 
UK, using either the databases from all 
21 general practices in Devon,13–15 the 
QResearch® database,16–18 The Health 
Improvement Network (THIN) database,12 
or 
the 
General 
Practice 
Research 
Database,19,20 and were either case-
control studies,12–15,20 or prospective16–18 or 
retrospective cohort studies.19 The sample 
sizes are shown in Table 1 with the number 
of cases ranging from 23920 to 12 074,12 and 
controls from 123513,15 to 2 402 342.16 Two of 
the studies only included patients aged ≥40 
years,12–15 with another two studies including 
patients aged 25–89 years,17,18 while one 
study included each of the following 
ages: 30–84 years,16 15–100 years,19 and 
≥50 years.20 Further study details are 
shown in Table 1, and Table 2 details the 
risk prediction tools reported by the studies. 
Further information on the studies is also 
available from the authors on request.
Although Hamilton et al included all 
patients with a lung cancer diagnosis in 
Exeter in the study period (except for 13 (5%) 
whose records could not be traced), the 
sample may not be wholly representative 
of the whole of the UK lung cancer patient 
population in terms of tumour pathological 
subtype, because the small-cell lung cancer 
rate in the study was double that in the UK as 
a whole (21% versus 10%).14,15 Histological 
confirmation was available for 237 of the 
247 cases. Small-cell lung cancer is a more 
aggressive tumour and more likely to be 
associated with systemic manifestations 
and extensive disease at presentation. 
Moreover, the sample size (247 events) is 
likely to be inadequate, considering the high 
number of variables examined in univariate 
(n = 225) and multivariate (n = 97) analyses. 
In addition, data were not available for all of 
the patients: platelet count was available in 
32% of controls and 52% of cases. This gave 
thrombocytosis rates of 4.8% and 26% for 
controls and cases, respectively. Ades et al 
performed further analyses on the tool data 
and found that ‘any two symptoms within 
3 months’ was the most discriminating 
criterion (between cases and controls), with 
a sensitivity of 80.6%, and a false positive 
How this fits in
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer 
deaths, with most patients having advanced 
disease at diagnosis. It would be better 
to recognise at-risk patients earlier and 
investigate appropriately. In a systematic 
review of all existing risk prediction tools 
for patients presenting in primary care 
with symptoms of possible lung cancer, 
the authors found five promising tools. 
However, none of them has been fully 
validated or compared to each other
. 
Presently, there is insufficient evidence 
for the recommendation of any one of the 
available risk prediction tools.
Box 1. Study methods
Criteria for considering studies for this review
The target studies for inclusion were any studies (retrospective, prospective) reporting on risk prediction 
tools or clinical decision tools for use in patients presenting to primary care with symptoms that may 
indicate lung cancer
. The authors defined such tools as analyses that examined the risk of lung cancer 
associated with one or more factors, such as smoking, family history, age, or comorbidity, in combination 
with one or more symptoms in patients presenting in primary care for whom follow-up data were available. 
Studies reporting on the risk of lung cancer associated with single symptoms were not included, and 
neither were studies on asymptomatic or non-presenting patients (for example, screening).
Search methods for identification of studies
The authors searched Medline, Premedline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science (SCI & SSCI), 
and ISI Proceedings from 1980 to 7 March 2016 using the search strategy outlined in the Appendix. One of 
the authors performed the search and screened the initial search results, excluding all obviously irrelevant 
studies. A second author then screened the titles and abstracts of the remaining records, excluding 
irrelevant studies and examining the full text of all potentially relevant studies. The final lists of included and 
excluded studies were agreed in consensus between three of the authors.
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction and quality assessment of the included studies was performed by two authors. For each 
included study, the following characteristics were extracted: 
• study design 
• inclusion/exclusion criteria 
• setting 
•  
patient characteristics (number, age, sex, country, any other relevant characteristics reported, such as 
relevant history or comorbidities) 
• definition of symptom(s) 
• method of verification of diagnosis (outcome) 
• predictor variables 
• missing data handling 
• presentation and availability of the tool 
• details about validation and evaluation of the tool; and
• any other relevant details reported in the studies.

 rate of 23.2%. However, beyond these 
analyses the tool has not been internally or 
externally validated.13
Despite the lack of validation, the impact 
of the tool has been examined in a before-
and-after study investigating the utility 
and acceptability of the tool (which along 
with another tool for colorectal cancer 
was displayed on mousemats and desktop 
flipcharts) in 614 GPs.21 The study found 
that new lung cancer diagnoses increased 
from 127 (in the 6 months preceding the 
use of the tool) to 174 during the study, 
and that stage I–II cancers increased from 
26 to 31 during the same time period. 
Hamilton et al further reported that the GPs’ 
referral thresholds and decision making 
were affected to varying extent, with GPs 
reporting that they used the tool to support 
a referral decision already made, to urge 
a decision to refer that may otherwise not 
have been made, and to confirm a decision 
not to refer
.21 Generally, using the tool 
seemed to lead to some change in practice 
and to be perceived positively, although not 
to override clinical judgement or supersede 
other guidance. Although these results are 
encouraging, they need to be replicated in 
an appropriate randomised controlled trial 
design, because the current study design 
precludes the assignment of causality, with 
time (or season) being a serious confounding 
variable in the quantitative comparisons 
of additional cancers diagnosed and their 
stages, because positive predictive values 
vary with season.
Green et al reported further qualitative 
results from a subgroup of the Hamilton 
study,21 showing that the majority of 
GPs reported finding the tool useful in 
consultations, heightening their awareness 
of potential cancer symptoms, reminding 
them of potential cancer risks, and affecting 
their referral thresholds, although not all 
of the participating GPs found the tool a 
valuable addition to their practice.22 Similar 
results were reported by Dikomitis et al; 
a qualitative study that examined 23 GPs’ 
experiences of using an electronic version 
of the tool (one for smokers and one for 
non-smokers) in addition to their practices’ 
clinical software package.23 The GPs in the 
study by Dikomitis et al reported that the 
tool raised their awareness of the potential 
for cancer as the cause of the symptoms, 
and that their referral rates were affected to 
varying degrees, but the authors of the study 
undertook no quantitative measurements 
of actual impact; for example, referral rates, 
new cancers diagnosed, or stage of new 
cancers diagnosed. 
The sample used in the Hippisley-Cox 
and Coupland studies,16–18 drawn from 
the QResearch database, appears to be 
representative of the UK primary care 
population, and the sample sizes also 
appear to be adequate for the evaluation 
of the original variables in the tools. In 
separate, non-overlapping samples from 
the QResearch database, randomly chosen 
for the validation cohort, the authors 
undertook internal validation of the tools 
and found excellent discrimination between 
new cases of lung cancer and non-cases 
(area under the curves [AUCs] = 0.91 to 
0.92),16–18 with one of the studies reporting 
a highest sensitivity of 77.3% found in the 
top 10% risk score group (relative to the 
top 5%, 1%, and 0.5%, with sensitivities of 
62.7%, 36.2%, and 27.4%, respectively).16 
The other two studies reported sensitivities, 
specificities, positive predictive values, and 
negative predictive values in the top 10% 
risk groups of 72.1%, 90.1%, 1.2%, and 
99.9%, respectively, in females,18 and of 
71.5%, 90.2%, 1.9%, and 99.9%, respectively, 
in males.17 Calibration was assessed 
by comparing observed versus mean 
predicted risk within each tenth of predicted 
risk over 2 years,16–18 while taking account 
of competing risks in the calculation of 
observed risks.16 This assessment showed 
excellent calibration overall for two of the 
tools,17,18 which was also the case for the 
other two tools at the lower risk levels, but 
as the risk increased these tools began to 
increasingly overestimate the expected risk, 
especially in males.16 
Including all incident cases of lung 
cancer in the study period in patients 
aged ≥40 years along with 10 randomly 
selected matched controls ensures that the 
sample used by Iyen-Omofoman et al is 
representative of the general UK primary 
care population, and that the sample size 
is adequate (12 074 events with 18 predictor 
variables analysed at two time intervals).12 
However, it should be noted, as Tammemägi 
also points out, that the intercept of the tool 
presented, due to the case-control design 
‘reflects the proportion of cases sampled 
and not the general population proportion of 
disease’.24 However, the population studied 
represented more than 15% of the total 
English population so it is unlikely that this 
is a significant source of error
. A unique 
aspect of this study was that the model was 
developed using data from between 12 and 
4 months prior to diagnosis. This was done 
to avoid ascertainment bias. The authors 
noted that at 4 months the chest X-ray 
rate rose in lung cancer cases compared 
with controls, indicating that this is when 
GPs suspect cancer, and is the time when

 there may be ascertainment bias in that 
symptoms are preferentially recorded in 
cases.
Iyen-Omofoman et al also assessed the 
tool’s performance in a validation cohort, 
also from the THIN database, consisting 
of 1 826 293 patients with a total of 1728 
incident cases of lung cancer during 
the 1-year follow up, and reported a 
maximum tool sensitivity of 93.98% at a 
cut-off value of –3, with an accompanying 
specificity of 59.67%. Discrimination of the 
tool, as assessed by receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve and AUC 
analysis, was shown to be excellent, with 
AUC 0.88, but no calibration of the tool was 
reported.12 
Although the sample in Jones et al can be 
considered to be representative of the UK 
primary care population, and the sample 
size is adequate relative to the number of 
predictors examined, the tool does not take 
account of a number of other confounding 
variables, most notably smoking.19 Any tool 
not taking into account the effect of smoking 
on lung cancer risk is of limited utility for 
the practising GP considering the risk of 
lung cancer in a symptomatic patient. 
The sample used by Jordan et al can 
be considered to be representative of the 
general population presenting to general 
practice in the UK. However, the study 
is underpowered, especially for neck, 
shoulder, and hip pain.20 Moreover, the 
utility of the tool for the practising GP is 
limited due to the non-reporting of the 
actual effects of the adjusting variables, 
which is also impossible to assess by 
independent investigators. 
Finally, it should be noted that all 
database studies using routinely collected 
consultation data underreport symptoms: 
some symptoms are unvoiced, some are 
unrecorded, and some are recorded in 
irretrievable form. The latter may give rise to 
biased estimates, as GPs appear to record 
data preferentially in retrievable form when 
the patient has cancer
.25 It is important that 
ascertainment bias is avoided when such 
tools are used because this does not reflect 
the way in which they were developed. The 
Iyen-Omofoman study design minimises 
this effect.
DISCUSSION
Summary
The authors identified five risk prediction 
tools developed for primary care in 
patients presenting with symptoms that 
may indicate lung cancer
. The studies were 
all based on UK primary care data, but 
differed in complexity of development, in the 
number and type of variables examined and 
included, and in their outcome time frame, 
which varied from lung cancer diagnosis 
within 1 year to diagnosis within 6–10 years, 
although the majority of the studies aimed 
to predict lung cancer within 1–2 years. 
The tools were all subject to a number of 
limitations that compromise their results to 
varying degrees, such as representativeness 
of sample,13–15 power,13–15,20 availability of 
data underlying the tools,12,16–18,20 and the 
inclusion of important confounders, such as 
smoking.19 Moreover, only few of the studies 
clearly reported how they handled missing 
data,16–18 although this quality criterion was 
arguably not applicable to one of the other 
studies given the nature of their only three 
predictors.19
To date, none of the tools have been 
externally validated, which is a critical 
criterion that must be met on the way 
towards their widespread implementation in 
general practice, and only four of them have 
been internally validated.12,16–18 This internal 
validation showed excellent discrimination 
between new lung cancer cases and non-
cases by the tools, but also that some of the 
Hippisley-Cox and Coupland tools tended 
to overestimate risk of lung cancer at the 
higher risk levels.16 Iyen-Omofoman et al 
did not report calibration results for their 
tool, so it is unclear how well lung cancer 
risk predicted by the tool corresponds to 
the observed risk in their internal validation 
cohort.
Similarly, 
the 
clinical 
and 
cost-
effectiveness of the different tools in 
general practice have yet to be evaluated 
in appropriately designed randomised 
controlled trials, as none of them have 
so far been thus examined. However, one 
study21 was found that suggests that the 
Hamilton tool14,15 is promising in terms of 
increasing the number of new lung cancers 
diagnosed at an early, potentially curative 
stage, although, as already mentioned, 
these results await replication in a more 
robust study design.
Strengths and limitations
This systematic review was conducted in 
accordance with the best practice methods 
as outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration. 
Moreover, the authors aimed to be very 
inclusive and therefore included both 
simple and complex tools, although they 
did not search for grey or unpublished 
literature. The study may therefore be 
at risk of publication bias. However, the 
authors believe this risk to be negligible as 
any large, properly conducted relevant study 
is likely to have been published because of 
Funding
None.

 the number of variables and type of analysis 
typically seen in such studies.
Implications for research and practice 
Although there are limitations in the 
tools reviewed, in particular the lack of 
external validation and evaluation in 
clinical practice, there is a pressing need 
to improve early diagnosis of lung cancer to 
improve mortality. Four of the multivariate 
tools are, not unexpectedly, somewhat 
similar in terms of the risk factors and 
their relative contribution to the overall 
risk (Table 2).12,16–18 Thus, although tools 
can be refined, there is sufficient merit 
to proceed with evaluation owing to their 
promising discrimination. Future evaluation 
of the latest NICE guidelines on recognition 
and referral of lung cancer in primary 
care,11 which used data from the included 
tools, may provide some such information 
for some of the tools. Moreover, the 
Hamilton tool is currently being evaluated 
in an implementation project supported 
by Macmillan. The QCancer® tools16–18 are 
available and being used in some practices. 
There is, however, no prospect with this 
approach to determine which tool is best 
at bringing forward the diagnosis. A tool 
such as that described by Iyen-Omofoman, 
based on factors recorded up to 4 months 
prior to diagnosis may be more accurate 
in this regard, because the data on which 
it is based are unlikely to be influenced by 
ascertainment bias. However, this tool is 
not currently being used or evaluated to see 
if it has any effect on the point at which a 
diagnosis is made. What is needed to guide 
clinical practice is a comparative study so 
that the best tools can be incorporated into 
clinical decision tools used in primary care. 
At present, the evidence is therefore not 
at a stage where any one of the available 
lung cancer risk prediction tools can be 
clearly recommended above and beyond 
the others.
