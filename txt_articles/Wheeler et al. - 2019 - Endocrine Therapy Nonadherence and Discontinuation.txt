Abstract
Background: Differential use of endocrine therapy (ET) by race may contribute to breast cancer outcome disparities, but racial
differences in ET behaviors are poorly understood.
Methods: Women aged 20–74 years with a first primary, stage I–III, hormone receptor–positive (HRþ) breast cancer were in-
cluded. At 2 years postdiagnosis, we assessed nonadherence, defined as not taking ET every day or missing more than two
pills in the past 14 days, discontinuation, and a composite measure of underuse, defined as either missing pills or discontinu-
ing completely. Using logistic regression, we evaluated the relationship between race and nonadherence, discontinuation,
and overall underuse in unadjusted, clinically adjusted, and socioeconomically adjusted models.
Results: A total of 1280 women were included; 43.2% self-identified as black. Compared to white women, black women more
often reported nonadherence (13.7% vs 5.2%) but not discontinuation (10.0% vs 10.7%). Black women also more often reported
the following: hot flashes, night sweats, breast sensitivity, and joint pain; believing that their recurrence risk would not
change if they stopped ET; forgetting to take ET; and cost-related barriers. In multivariable analysis, black race remained sta-
tistically significantly associated with nonadherence after adjusting for clinical characteristics (adjusted odds ratio ¼ 2.72,
95% confidence interval ¼ 1.75 to 4.24) and after adding socioeconomic to clinical characteristics (adjusted odds ratio ¼ 2.44,
95% confidence interval ¼ 1.50 to 3.97) but was not independently associated with discontinuation after adjustment. Low re-
currence risk perception and lack of a shared decision making were strongly predictive of ET underuse across races.
Conclusions: Our results highlight important racial differences in ET-adherence behaviors, perceptions of benefits/harms,
and shared decision making that may be targeted with culturally tailored interventions.
Nationally, breast cancer mortality is 41.5% higher among black
women compared with white women, despite a historically
lower incidence rate (1). Racial differences in screening, stage at
diagnosis, insurance status, and tumor biology explain some,
but not all, of this disparity (2,3). Although breast cancer in
black women is characterized by higher estrogen receptor nega-
tivity, higher grade, and histological differences (4–10), studies
suggest that black women have worse prognoses regardless of
subtype and biologic profile of disease (11,12). In fact, the largest
racial disparity in outcomes occurs within the biologically
similar hormone receptor–positive (HRþ), HER-2-negative sub-
types, suggesting that treatment differences and other nonbio-
logical factors may explain these racial differences (11).
Failure to receive appropriate treatment (13–16) is an impor-
tant cause of observed racial disparities in breast cancer mortal-
ity (17,18). Black women are less likely to receive timely and
guideline-recommended
surgery,
radiation,
and
endocrine
therapy (ET) (19). Importantly, however, black and white women
with clinically similar disease profiles can achieve similar out-
comes under similar treatment modalities (20,21).

 Oral adjuvant ET is an important part of treatment for HRþ
cancer, the majority of all breast cancer cases. Evidence sug-
gests that taking ET for up to 10 years reduces the risk of recur-
rence
and
cancer-specific
mortality
(22,23).
However,
between 15% and 49% of women with HRþ disease never initi-
ate ET (24–27), and more than half do not take ET as recom-
mended (28,29), with black women having lower medication
usage (including taking medication as prescribed [adherence]
and
continuing
to
take
medication
at
all
[continuation])
(30).
Reasons
for
nonadherence
and
discontinuation
may
differ by race. Beliefs about medication efficacy, patient–
provider relationship, and level of social support have all been
associated with ET underuse, but it is unknown if modifiable
factors such as these are experienced differently by black and
white women or whether correlates of nonadherence and dis-
continuation differ (31).
The social-contextual framework considers the ways in which
both health and health behaviors are influenced by one’s social
context, including access to care, material hardship, and social
support (32). It is essential to understand the complex social con-
textual predictors of ET nonadherence and discontinuation if we
are to develop culturally sensitive interventions to reduce dispar-
ities in breast cancer outcomes. Existing literature provides snap-
shots of reasons for ET underuse, but fails to elucidate racial
differences in associations (27,33,34). We sought to extend this lit-
erature by examining to what extent ET-related side effects, per-
ceptions of recurrence risk, and shared decision making explain
black/white differences in nonadherence and discontinuation.
Our analysis from a large, minority-enriched, longitudinal cohort
study provides novel insights into ET adherence behavior by race
and points to potential reasons why black women with HRþ dis-
ease may experience higher mortality.
Methods
Data
The Carolina Breast Cancer Study phase III (CBCS-III) data are
unusually rich, spanning a state with substantial racial diversity
and including patients from a wide range of economic strata, in-
surance providers, and care settings, allowing broad generaliz-
ability of findings. Notably, CBCS oversampled black women
and women younger than age 50 years, with approximately half
of participants in each of these categories, allowing inferences
about racial and age-related differences with adequate statisti-
cal power.
CBCS-III recruited women between 2008 and 2013 through rapid
case ascertainment in collaboration with the NC Central Cancer
Registry.
Those
who
provided
written
informed
consent
completed a baseline questionnaire regarding sociodemographics,
insurance, access to care, health behaviors, and health-related
quality of life. Patients’ medical records and tumor and blood sam-
ples
also
were
obtained.
Tumor
characteristics
(eg,
stage,
grade, HRþ status) were ascertained from pathology laboratory
reports. Additional patient-reported data were collected via tele-
phone
and
mailed
questionnaire
at
approximately
2 years postdiagnosis, with ongoing follow-up planned through
10years postdiagnosis, and updated medical records obtained at
multiple time points. Incentives of $75 were offered for completion
of the initial baseline data collection and $10 for completion of
each of the follow-up surveys.
As part of the 2-year follow-up questionnaire, we collected
health-related quality of life data and ET-related symptom data
using
the
Functional
Assessment
of
Cancer
Therapy
for
Breast
Cancer
(FACT-B)
and
FACT-Breast-Endocrine
Symptoms (FACT-B-ES) scales, respectively. In addition, we de-
veloped a medication usage questionnaire to understand both ex-
tent of ET use and reason-specific underuse, based upon reviews
of the literature (35–38) and input from clinical and health behav-
ior experts. This questionnaire includes a multi-item measure of
self-reported ET usage behavior as well as questions about recur-
rence risk perception, shared decision making, and overall as-
sessment of ET (Table 1). After initial development, we pretested
the questionnaire with a clinic-based sample of breast cancer
patients, conducted cognitive interviews, and refined the ques-
tionnaire based upon response patterns and feedback regarding
usability and content. This study was approved by the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board.
Inclusion Criteria
The parent study recruited women aged 20–74 years who
were diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer be-
tween May 2008 and July 2013 and who resided in one
of 44 study counties. A total of 2328 women in the CBCS-III co-
hort were sent a 2-year follow-up survey containing ET-related
questions, which 2015 completed (87%) (Supplementary Figure
1, available online).
Among follow-up survey respondents, 1392 reported initiat-
ing or being recommended to take ET. We excluded women
who reported race other than black or white (n ¼ 41), had stage
IV disease (n ¼ 35), did not receive cancer-directed surgery
(n ¼ 4), and experienced recurrence prior to the 2-year follow-up
survey (n ¼ 32).
Primary Outcome Measure
Nonadherence was defined based on responses to two survey
items: 1) a respondent reported not taking ET as prescribed and
2) a respondent reported missing more than two pills in the
past two weeks (Figure 1). These items correlated but did not
completely
overlap
(r ¼ .71);
therefore,
indication
of
non-
adherence from either item was combined to create a more sen-
sitive measure. Sensitivity analyses using each single-item
adherence
measure
were
not
substantively
different.
Discontinuation was defined by self-report as stopping ET
completely. We also created a composite endpoint of underuse,
including both nonadherence and discontinuation behaviors,
where underuse reflects lower than 80% adherence, because all
levels of adherence below this threshold have been linked to
decrements in survival (28,39).
Primary Exposure Measure
Race was defined by a self-reported indicator of black or
white status at baseline questionnaire. In a separate question,
12 white women and 2 black women identified as Hispanic.
Because of small numbers, we did not control for Hispanic eth-
nicity in our analysis.
Covariates/Other Variables
We examined factors expected to influence a person’s motiva-
tion and self-efficacy to take ET as prescribed, using a model de-
scribed by Adamian et al. (40). Treatment-related side effects

 included cancer stage at diagnosis and treatments received
(from medical records), health insurance coverage, age, educa-
tion,
marital/cohabitating
status,
and
household
income.
Although we had access to some information about meno-
pausal status, it was highly correlated with age. Because we
conceptualize age as related also to unmeasured comorbidity,
medication use, and beliefs about risk/benefit trade-offs, we
opted to include age rather than menopause in our models.
Multiple specifications of age resulted in similar findings.
Analysis of variance inflation factors (VIF) was performed on fi-
nal covariates to confirm acceptably low multicollinearity
(VIF < 10).
Statistical Analysis
We first examined bivariable predictors of ET underuse. We
then used multivariable logistic regression to assess the role of
clinical factors, including age, stage, treatments, and endocrine
symptoms as well as individual mediating factors (risk percep-
tion) and social mediating factors (shared decision making), in
contributing to ET underuse. In the primary model, we consid-
ered race as a social construct without controlling separately for
socioeconomic status, as suggested by the Institute of Medicine
(42). As a secondary analysis, we added social-contextual varia-
bles (marital status, income, education, insurance status) to as-
sess the role of these factors in a model estimating the residual
direct effect of race (42).
These models assume the relationships between indepen-
dent and dependent variables are the same for black and white
women and thus report average effects across races. To assess
possible effect modification of the relationship between predic-
tors and underuse, we ran models stratified by race and con-
ducted Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, an increasingly common
approach
for
evaluating
disparities
(43,44).

Many women who have had breast cancer take endocrine therapy pills, also known as hormonal therapy or an�-estrogen 
therapy, to help keep breast cancer from coming back. Specific names of these drugs are Tamoxifen, Femara (or Letrozole),

 by race-specific relationships (eg, the relationship between age
and underuse is different for black vs white women) (45).
Missingness was 5% or less for all variables. Multiple
imputation
was
performed
for
missing
variables
using
SAS Studio (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to create, analyze, and com-
bine 50 imputed datasets as described by Rubin (46,47). Results
are presented as estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) and P values. A statistical significance
level of 5% was used for all analyses. All statistical tests were
two-sided.
Results
Overall, 1280 women reported being prescribed ET and were in-
cluded in our sample; of these, 43.2% self-identified as black,
and mean age at diagnosis was 53 years (Table 1). Overall, black
women more often presented with advanced stage disease,
greater financial vulnerability, lower education, and public in-
surance or uninsured status (Supplementary Table 1, available
online). For black women, 23.7% reported underuse of ET, com-
pared to 15.9% of white women (P < .001) (Table 1). Compared
with white women, black women more often reported non-
adherence (13.7% vs 5.2%, P < .001) but not discontinuation
(10.0% vs 10.7%, P ¼ .65). Younger women were more often
underusing ET (P ¼ .003), as were those women insured by
Medicaid (P < .001) and those making less than $50 000/y
(P ¼ .03). Additionally, women who did not describe their deci-
sion to start ET as a shared decision-making process with their
provider were more often underusing ET (P < .001) (Table 1).
Women prescribed tamoxifen were more often underusing ET
(P < .001), as were those who changed ET type one or more times
(P ¼ .008).
A
statistically
significantly
higher
proportion
of
black
women reported the following: forgetting to take ET when trav-
eling away from home (26.2% vs 19.5%, P < .001); sticking to
their ET treatment plan was hard or very hard (27.5% vs 14.0%,
P < .001); trouble remembering to take their ET pills (27.2%
vs 13.2%, P < .001); missing pills due to cost (17.1% vs 6.7%,
P < .001); and severe side effects that led to skipping ET pills
(25.0% vs 16.3%, P < .001) (Table 2). Black women also reported
less often that the “good of taking ET outweighed the bad”
(72.1% vs 79.8%, P < .001) (Table 2). Black women more often
reported that they believed their risk of breast cancer recurrence
was very low if medication was completed but were also twice
as likely to say that their recurrence risk would not change if
they stopped taking ET (Figure 2). Differences in perceived risk
of recurrence by race were not explained by stage at diagnosis
in bivariable analyses (results not shown).
Compared with white women, black women more often
reported hot flashes (57.5% vs 42.5%), night sweats (42.5%
vs 27.7%), breast sensitivity (24.3% vs 15.9%), and joint pain
(46.2% vs 36.3%), as well as almost all other ET-related symp-
toms in the past 7 days (all P < .001) (Figure 3). However, black
women were less likely to report some sexual side effects in-
cluding vaginal dryness (18.7% vs 24.1%, P ¼ .02) and painful sex
(11.5% vs 18.9% P ¼ .001) compared with white women.
In multivariable models (Table 3), black race was statistically
significantly associated with overall underuse in a model
adjusting only for clinical characteristics and patient percep-
tions of decision making and recurrence risk (adjusted OR ¼
1.44, 95% CI ¼ 1.05 to 1.99), but the association was no longer
statistically
significant
once
socioeconomic
variables
were
added
to
the
model.
In
multivariable
models
predicting
nonadherence specifically, black race was a statistically signifi-
cant predictor after clinical adjustment (adjusted OR ¼ 2.72, 95%
CI ¼ 1.75 to 4.24), and remained statistically significant after fur-
ther adjustment for socioeconomic factors (adjusted OR ¼ 2.44,
95% CI ¼ 1.50 to 3.97). Black race was not statistically signifi-
cantly associated with discontinuation.
The
strongest
predictor
of
overall
ET
underuse,
non-
adherence, and discontinuation in fully adjusted models was
believing that recurrence risk does not change if ET is not taken
as prescribed (adjusted OR for underuse ¼ 8.35, 95% CI ¼ 5.34 to
13.1; adjusted OR for nonadherence ¼ 4.07, 95% CI ¼ 2.28 to 7.26;
adjusted OR for discontinuation ¼ 17.63, 95% CI ¼ 9.28 to 33.49)
(Table 3).
Other statistically significant predictors of ET nonadherence
in fully adjusted models included older age and baseline recur-
rence risk perception (P < .05) (Table 3). Statistically significant
predictors of ET discontinuation in fully adjusted models in-
cluded: taking tamoxifen vs aromatase inhibitors (adjusted OR
¼ 1.66, 95% CI ¼ 1.00 to 2.73); reporting a patient-led (adjusted
OR ¼ 3.44, 95% CI ¼ 2.07 to 5.75) or passive (adjusted OR ¼ 2.59,
95% CI ¼ 1.17 to 5.72), rather than shared, decision-making pro-
cess to begin ET; perceiving that recurrence risk increased only
a little if ET was discontinued (adjusted OR ¼ 3.71, 95% CI ¼ 2.05
to 6.74); and having Medicaid insurance relative to private insur-
ance (adjusted OR ¼ 2.27, 95% CI ¼ 1.06 to 2.88).
Finally, relaxing the assumption that covariates behave
identically for black and white women, we estimated race-
stratified models, which suggested racial relationships in terms
of the magnitude and statistical significance for several key pre-
dictors of underuse (Supplementary Table 2, available online)
To compare the relative importance of these coefficient differ-
ences vs differences in underlying cohort characteristics, we
conducted Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, comparing expected
ET usage for black and white samples with matched character-
istics. We find that characteristic differences between black and
white patients could not fully explain the disparity in ET use.
Characteristic differences account for only 38.6% (95% CI ¼
18.6% to 59.0%) of the racial difference, with the majority of this
variation explained by differences in recurrence risk perception
if pills are discontinued (Table 4). The remainder of the varia-
tion in ET underuse was attributable to differences in model
coefficients and intercepts by race.
Discussion
In a large, racially enriched prospective cohort, we found that
black women with HRþ breast cancer were statistically signifi-
cantly more likely to be nonadherent to ET, but not more likely
to discontinue, and we identified major modifiable predictors of
nonadherence, including differential risk perceptions and a lack
of shared treatment decision making. Our study provides excep-
tional detail on reasons for nonadherence and differences in
the ET experience by race, including risk perception, shared
decision making, and side effect burden. In general, the burden
of self-reported ET-related side effects was worse among black
women, but side effect burden was not correlated with ET ad-
herence. This latter finding may reflect timing of side effect
questions (past 7 days), development of coping strategies, or the
larger impact of psychological rather than physiological factors.
Given the scarcity of literature on ET experiences by race, it
is difficult to compare our results with previous studies.

 effects, comorbidities, and medication cost (28,48–53). Women
have
reported
confusion
about
the
hormonal
nature
of
tamoxifen and distress related to ET side effects such as hot
flashes, weight gain, and loss of fertility (54). We add to this lit-
erature by identifying several adherence barriers that are differ-
ential by race. Notably, racial differences in risk perception
appear to be driving a substantial portion of the increased non-
adherence among black women.
Existing ET interventions have focused on the provision of
educational materials with little benefit (55). Our results suggest
that multifaceted interventions may better address the numer-
ous barriers to improving ET-related risk perception, shared de-
cision making, and medication-taking habits, as opposed to
simply attending to burdensome side effects. To ensure equity,
interventions should consider racial differences in the ET expe-
rience. For example, we find that white women report more sex-
ual side effects, but black women experience numerous other
side effects more often; supportive side effect management can
likely be improved. It may also be important to address cost bar-
riers and concerns about medication use—both more common
among black women. Motivational interviewing counseling is
one example of a multifaceted behavioral intervention success-
ful in improving medication adherence in non-ET contexts
among diverse patients (56,57). Motivational interviewing is in-
herently patient directed and can enable patients to assess
treatment and health goals, identify barriers and facilitators to
healthy behavior, solve problems, and improve self-efficacy
(58,59).
Our study has several limitations. First, our sample is drawn
from Black and White women diagnosed in North Carolina,
which may limit generalizability to women of other races and
ethnicities as well as those in other states. However, CBCS rep-
resents an intentionally sampled cohort of women with breast
cancer in a large, racially and socioeconomically diverse state
with substantial racial disparities in cancer outcomes. Second,
although
our
questionnaire
included
previously
validated
instruments (35–37), it has not yet been compared to alternative
adherence measures such as electronic pill counters or phar-
macy refill data. Finally, although the cohort was followed pro-
spectively, ET questions were only asked at one time point. This
creates temporal challenges in interpreting risk perceptions and
side effects causally, as women’s responses may be influenced
by their current medication-taking behaviors. Future work
should seek to examine ET-related perceptions and behaviors
with
more
frequent
data
collection
to
capture
temporal
granularity.
Strengths of our study include the oversampling of black
women and women younger than age 50 years, the use of rapid
case ascertainment to recruit patients near the time of diagno-
sis, and the longitudinal engagement of patients. We also used
patient-reported instruments to measure medication behaviors
and side effects. Notably, there is no “gold standard” for mea-
suring medication adherence.
However,
collecting patient-
reported data on medication use enables a deeper understand-
ing of patient experiences (as opposed to using claims or clinical

 data), and therefore plays an important role in adherence
research.
Data from our minority-enriched sample suggest that patient-
reported reasons for ET underuse, such as lack of belief in treat-
ment efficacy, poor awareness of benefits, and poor communication
with providers, are more prevalent in black women. Each of these rep-
resents a potentially modifiable barrier where opportunities exist to
intervene to improve ET use. Our work provides much-needed, timely
information to fill large gaps in the understanding of ET behaviors
among minority women with breast cancer. Recognition of racial dif-
ferences and attention to the needs of minority women during inter-
vention development will help to ensure they are not left behind in
our efforts to improve ET use.
Effective behavioral interventions to improve ET continuation
and adherence that are relevant, feasible, acceptable, and scal-
able within racially diverse populations are needed. Motivational
interviewing counseling is one such intervention that has been
successful in improving medication adherence in other settings
and may be suitable in this context (40,56,57). In turn, optimizing
the delivery of ET will eventually lead to less breast cancer recur-
rence and greater improvements in mortality, with potentially
the greatest impact on minority women with breast cancer.
