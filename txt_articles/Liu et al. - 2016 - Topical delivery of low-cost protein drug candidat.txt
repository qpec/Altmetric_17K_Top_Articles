Abstract
Protein drugs (PD) are minimally utilized in dental medicine due to high cost and invasive surgical 
delivery. There is limited clinical advancement in disrupting virulent oral biofilms, despite their 
high prevalence in causing dental caries. Poor efficacy of antimicrobials following topical 
treatments or to penetrate and disrupt formed biofilms is a major challenge. We report an exciting 
low-cost approach using plant-made antimicrobial peptides (PMAMPs) retrocyclin or protegrin 
with complex secondary structures (cyclic/hairpin) for topical use to control biofilms. The 
PMAMPs rapidly killed the pathogen Streptococcus mutans and impaired biofilm formation 
following a single topical application of tooth-mimetic surface. Furthermore, we developed a 
synergistic approach using PMAMPs combined with matrix-degrading enzymes to facilitate their 
access into biofilms and kill the embedded bacteria. In addition, we identified a novel role for 
PMAMPs in delivering drugs to periodontal and gingival cells, 13–48 folds more efficiently than 
any other tested cell penetrating peptides. Therefore, PDs fused with protegrin expressed in plant 
cells could potentially play a dual role in delivering therapeutic proteins to gum tissues while 
killing pathogenic bacteria when delivered as topical oral formulations or in chewing gums. 
Recent FDA approval of plant-produced PDs augurs well for clinical advancement of this novel 
concept.

 Introduction
Biopharmaceuticals produced in current systems are prohibitively expensive for a large 
majority of the global population. The cost of protein drugs ($140 billion in 2013) exceeds 
GDP of >75% of countries around the globe [1], making them unaffordable. One third of 
global population earns <$2 per day or the low socio-economic/underprivileged in the US 
can’t afford protein drugs. Such high costs are associated with their production in 
prohibitively expensive fermenters, purification, cold transportation/storage, short shelf life 
and sterile delivery methods [2,3]. In order to address these concerns, low cost PDs can be 
made in plant cells for their topical [4] or oral delivery [2,3,5].
Many infectious diseases in humans are caused by biofilms, including those occurring in the 
mouth [6,7]. For example, dental caries continues to be the single most prevalent biofilm-
associated oral disease, afflicting mostly underprivileged children and adults in the US and 
worldwide, resulting in expenditures of >$40 billion annually [8–10]. Caries-causing 
(cariogenic) biofilms develop when bacteria interact with dietary sugars and accumulate on 
tooth surface, forming organized clusters that are firmly adherent and enmeshed in an 
extracellular matrix of polymeric substances such as exopolysaccharides (EPS) [9]. 
Streptococcus mutans is one of the major pathogens causing dental caries, although 
additional organisms may be involved [6,8–10]. This bacterium expresses multiple 
exoenzymes (glucosyltransferases) that make it a primary EPS producer in oral cavity, while 
it is also highly acidogenic and aciduric [9]. Current topical antimicrobial modalities for 
controlling cariogenic biofilms are limited. Chlorhexidine (CHX) is considered the ‘gold 
standard’ for oral antimicrobial therapy, but has adverse side effects including tooth staining 
and calculus formation, and is not recommended for daily therapeutic use [11]. As an 
alternative, several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged with potential antibiofilm 
effects against caries-causing oral pathogens, including S. mutans [12,13].
When compared with conventional antibiotics, AMPs provide additional advantages for oral 
antimicrobial therapy. For example, AMPs not only possess bactericidal activity but also 
have other biological functions like immunomodulation by activating mast cells and wound 
healing [14], while playing a critical role in angiogenesis [15]. Furthermore, they are 
potently active against bacteria (particularly Gram-positive), fungi and viruses and can be 
tailored to target specific pathogens by fusion with their surface antigens [14,16,17]. AMPs 
can kill and restrict microbial infection by multiple mechanisms, including altered cell 
surface charge, disruption of membrane integrity and pore formation while also neutralizing 
lipopolysaccharides-induced endotoxin shock [14,16–19]. Although development of 
resistance is less likely with AMPs, previous studies have shown that resistance mechanisms 
can be developed by pathogens, including up-regulation of proteolytic activity, release of 
scavenging anionic compounds such as EPS and glycosaminoglycan, as well as amidation 
and related surface conjugations of membrane lipids and/or peptidoglycan [18,19]. However, 
AMP structure and bioactivity varies greatly.
Linear AMPs have poor stability or antimicrobial activity when compared to AMPs with 
complex secondary structures. For example, retrocyclin (RC101) and protegrin-1 (PG1) have

 high antimicrobial activity or stability when cyclized [20] or form hairpin structure [21] with 
formation of disulfide bonds. RC101 is highly stable at pH 3, 4, 7 and temperature 25°C to 
37°C as well as in human vaginal fluid for 48 hours [22], while the antimicrobial activity 
was maintained for up to six months [23]. Likewise, PG1 is highly stable in salt or human 
fluids [24,25] but potency is lost when linearized. Furthermore, AMPs displaying cyclic or 
secondary structures have increased penetrability through the microbial membranes 
compared to linear peptides [26]. These intriguing characteristics of antimicrobial peptides 
with complex secondary structures may facilitate development of novel therapeutics. 
However, the high cost of producing sufficient amounts of antimicrobial peptides is a major 
barrier for their clinical development and commercialization. Therefore, we have produced 
several low cost antimicrobial peptides (magainin, retrocyclin, protegrin) in plant 
chloroplasts [14,16,17].
Clinical therapy of biofilm-associated infections faces yet another challenging problem. 
Antimicrobial drugs often fail to kill the clusters of microbes that are protected by their 
extracellular matrix in formed biofilms [27–29]. Therefore, EPS-matrix degrading enzymes 
from fungi (like dextranase or mutanase) have been explored to disrupt biofilm and prevent 
dental caries [30–33] but with limited success [34,35]. However, a synergistic approach of 
combining antimicrobial agents with EPS-matrix degrading enzymes has not yet been 
developed. In order to address the cost of enzymes, we have developed a low cost strategy 
by producing them in plant chloroplasts [36,37]. Most importantly, plant cells expressing 
high levels of therapeutic proteins can be lyophilized and stored at room temperature for 
several years [2,3,38,39].
Apart from treating oral biofilm, protein therapy is minimally utilized in dental medicine 
because of invasive surgical delivery. However, there is a great need for delivery of growth 
hormones or other bioactives to enhance cell adhesion, stimulate osteogenesis, bone 
regeneration, differentiation of osteoblasts or endothelial cells. In addition to minimal 
patient compliance, injectable protein drugs often do not contain essential information to 
reach their target cells or cell penetrating capabilities. Therefore, localized targeting and 
delivery to cells including osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, gingival epithelial cells or 
fibroblasts is essential to advance oral health. When delivered orally, protein drugs 
synthesized in plant cells can be released by mechanical grinding (chewing). Therefore, in 
this study, we investigate the specificity or capability of cyclic or acyclic plant-made AMPs 
(PMAMPs) fused with green fluorescent protein to target various human periodontal or 
gingival cells and evaluate their efficacy in protein drug delivery. In parallel, we evaluated 
the potency of PMAMPs to prevent biofilm formation following a topical treatment and their 
synergistic activities with matrix degrading enzymes for disruption of formed biofilms. 
Thus, this study reports a new cost-effective approach for production of protein drugs to 
prevent or treat biofilm-associated oral diseases and deliver PDs to human oral tissues for 
enhancing oral health.

 Materials and Methods
Microorganisms and EPS degrading enzymes
Streptococcus mutans UA159 serotype c (ATCC 700610), Streptococcus gordonii DL-1 and 
Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104 were used in present study. The strains tested in this 
research were selected because S. mutans is a well-established virulent cariogenic bacteria 
[40]. S. gordonii is an early colonizer and considered an accessory pathogen (that could 
enhance virulence of periodontopathogens) [41]. A. naeslundii is also detected during the 
early stages of biofilm formation and may be associated with development of dental root 
caries [42]. All these strains were grown in ultra-filtered (10 kDa molecular-weight cut-off 
membrane; Prep/Scale, Millipore, MA) buffered tryptone-yeast extract broth (UFTYE; 2.5% 
tryptone and 1.5% yeast extract, pH 7.0) with 1% glucose to mid-exponential phase (37°C, 
5% CO2) prior to use. The EPS-degrading enzymes dextranase and mutanase are capable of 
hydrolyzing α-1,6 glucosidic linkages and α-1,3 glucosidic linkages present in the EPS 
glucans derived from S. mutans [43]. Dextranase produced from Penicillium sp. was 
commercially purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and mutanase produced from 
Trichoderma harzianum was kindly provided by Dr. William H. Bowen (Center for Oral 
Biology, University of Rochester Medical Center).
Purification of tag-fused GFP proteins
The transplastomic plants expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused with Cholera 
Toxin B subunit (CTB), Protein Transduction Domain (PTD), retrocyclin and protegrin were 
created as described in previous studies [16,38,44,45]. Purification of GFP-fused PG1 or 
RC101 from transplastomic tobacco was done from 0.2–1 gm of lyophilized plant material. 
Subsequent downstream processing was done based on protocols established previously 
[14,16,44] (also see Supplementary Figure S1). The lyophilized material was reconstituted 
in 10–20 ml of plant extraction buffer (0.2 M Tris HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M EDTA, 
0.4 M sucrose, 0.2% Triton X supplemented with 2% phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) 
and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). The resuspension was incubated in ice for 1 h with 
vortex homogenization every 15 min. The homogenates were then sonicated (Misonix 
sonicator 3000) and spun down at 75,000 g at 4°C for 1 h (Beckman LE-80K optima 
ultracentrifuge) to obtain the clarified lysate. The lysate was subjected to pretreatment with 
70% saturated ammonium sulfate and 1/4th volume of 100% ethanol, followed by vigorous 
shaking for 2 min. The treated solution was spun down at 2,100 g for 3 min. The upper 
ethanol phase was collected and the process was repeated with 1/16th volume of 100% 
ethanol. The pooled ethanol phases were further treated with 1/3rd volume of 5 M NaCl and 
1/4th volume of 1-butanol, homogenized vigorously for 2 min and spun down at 2,100 g for 
3 min. The lowermost phase was collected and loaded onto a 7 kDa MWCO zeba spin 
desalting column (Thermo scientific). The desalted extract was injected into a Toyopearl 
butyl – 650S hydrophobic interaction column (Tosoh bioscience) which was run on a FPLC 
unit (Pharmacia LKB-FPLC system). The column was equilibrated with 2.3 column 
volumes of salted buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA and 50% saturated ammonium 
sulfate) and unsalted buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA) to a final 20% salt saturation 
to facilitate binding of GFP fusions onto the resin. This was followed by a column wash with 
5.8 column volumes of salted and unsalted buffer mix and then eluted with unsalted buffer.

 The GFP fraction was identified and collected based on the peaks observed in the 
chromatogram and dialyzed three times in 4°C. The purified proteins were finally 
lyophilized (labconco freezone 2.5) and then resuspended in sterile 1X PBS for all 
experiments.
Quantification of purified GFP fusions
Purified GFP-fused RC101 or PG1 were quantified by running on a 12% SDS gel followed 
by western blot (denatured conditions) or native GFP fluorescence. The western blots were 
probed using mouse Anti-GFP antibody (Millipore) at 1:3000 dilution followed by 
secondary probing with 1:4000 dilution of HRP conjugated Goat-Anti Mouse antibody 
(Southern biotech). GFP fluorescence data was obtained by preparing and running GFP-
fusion samples under non-denaturing conditions. The native gels were fluoresced under UV 
light (Ultraviolet products Inc) and photographed. Commercial GFP standards (Vector labs) 
were used to quantify GFP fusions by both methods through densitometry using ImageJ 
software to determine GFP concentration, expression level and yield. Expression level was 
calculated from GFP concentrations relative to total protein values in plant crude extracts. 
Yield was determined by multiplying GFP concentration with recovered volume after 
purification. Individual peptide yield was determined by dividing GFP yield with molar 
factor 14 (ratio of GFP MW to peptide MW). Total protein was determined by Bradford 
method.
Evaluation of antibacterial activity of plant-made antimicrobial peptides (PMAMPs)
The antibacterial activity and killing kinetics of PMAMPs (GFP-PG1 and GFP-RC101) 
against S. mutans were analyzed by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) as well as time-lapse killing assays 
as described previously [46]. S. mutans were grown to log phase (105 CFU/ml), and GFP-
PG1 and GFP-RC101 were added to the growth medium at concentrations ranging from 1.25 
to 160 μg/ml (two-fold dilution), respectively. At 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h, aliquots of bacterial 
suspensions were serially diluted and plated on agar plates using an automated Eddy Jet 
spiral plater, and the colony forming units (CFU) colonies were counted. Absorbance at 600 
nm was also checked at each time point to measure growth rate. Antibacterial activity 
against S. gordonii and A. naeslundii was also determined to compare killing efficacy (vs. S. 
mutans). Time-lapsed confocal fluorescence imaging was also performed to assess the 
dynamics of S. mutans killing at single cell level. GFP-PG1 was added to actively growing 
(log-phase) S. mutans (105 CFU/ml) at concentrations of 10 μg/ml in the presence of 2.5 μM 
propidium iodide-PI (Molecular Probe Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) for labeling dead cells. 
Confocal images were acquired in the same field of view at 0, 10, 30, and 60 min using 
Leica SP5-FLIM inverted single photon laser scanning microscope with a 100X (numerical 
aperture, 1.4) oil immersion objective. The excitation wavelengths were 488 nm and 543 nm 
for GFP and PI, respectively. The emission filter for GFP was a 495/540 OlyMPFC1 filter, 
while PI was a 598/628 OlyMPFC2 filter. Images were analyzed by ImageJ 1.44 [47].
In parallel, morphological observations of S. mutans treated with PMAMPs (as described 
above) were also examined by scanning electron microcopy. Actively growing S. mutans 
cells were prepared as described above, and mixed with GFP-PG1 (final concentration of 10

 μg/ml) for up to 1 h at 37°C. After treatment, the bacterial cells were collected by filtration 
(0.4 μm Millipore filter), and then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.0% paraformaldehyde 
in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature and processed for SEM 
(Quanta FEG 250, FEI, Hillsboro, OR) observation. Bacteria treated with buffer only served 
as control.
Evaluation of anti-biofilm activity of GFP-PG1
S. mutans biofilms were formed on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) disc surfaces as 
detailed previously [47,48]. Hydroxyapatite discs (1.25 cm in diameter, surface area of 2.7 
± 0.2 cm2, Clarkson, Chromatography Products, Inc., South Williamsport, PA) were coated 
with filter-sterilized, clarified human whole saliva (sHA) [47]. S. mutans was grown in 
UFTYE medium with 1% (w/v) glucose to mid-exponential phase (37°C, 5% CO2). Before 
inoculum, sHA discs were topically treated with GFP-PG1 solution (10 μg/ml) or buffer 
only (vehicle-control) for 30 min. Chlorhexidine was used as positive control at the same 
concentration. Then, each of the treated sHA discs were inoculated with 105 CFU of actively 
growing S. mutans cells per ml in UFTYE medium containing 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 
inoculated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 19 h. EPS was labeled using 2.5 μM Alexa Fluor 647-
labeled dextran conjugate (10 kDa; 647/668 nm; Molecular Probes Inc.), while the bacteria 
cells were stained with 2.5 μM SYTO9 (485/498 nm; Molecular Probes Inc.). The imaging 
was performed using multi-photon Leica SP5 confocal microscope with 20X (numerical 
aperture, 1.00) water immersion objective. The excitation wavelength was 780 nm, and the 
emission wavelength filter for SYTO 9 was a 495/540 OlyMPFEC1 filter, while the filter for 
Alexa Fluor 647 was a HQ655/40M-2P filter. The confocal image series were generated by 
optical sectioning at each selected positions and step size of z-series scanning was 2 μm 
[47]. Amira 5.4.1 software (Visage Imaging, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to create 3D 
renderings of biofilm architecture [47,48].
We also examined the effects of PG1, alone or in combination with EPS-degrading enzymes, 
on pre-formed biofilms. Briefly, S. mutans biofilms were allowed to accumulate on 
untreated sHA discs for 19 h. Then, the biofilms were treated with: 1) vehicle-control, 2) 
EPS-degrading enzymes only, 3) PG1 only, or 4) PG1 + EPS-degrading enzymes for up to 
60 min. A mixture of 100 U dextranase with 20 U mutanase (ratio of 5:1) was used based on 
optimal enzyme amounts to degrade the EPS-matrix without killing the cells or disturbing 
the integrity of the biofilm 3D architecture as determined experimental in this study 
(Supplementary Fig S2) and our previous publication [43]. Alexa Fluor 647-labeled dextran 
conjugate was used to label the EPS-matrix, while SYTO 9 and PI were used to label live 
cells and dead cells [47]. Fluorescence images were taken at 0, 10, 30 and 60 min. The 
biofilm 3D architecture was rendered using AMIRA, and total biomass of EPS, live and 
dead cells were quantified using COMSTAT and ImageJ. The ratio of live to the total 
bacteria at each time point was calculated, and the survival rate of live cells (relative to live 
cells at 0 min) was plotted as described previously [47]. The initial number of viable cells at 
time point 0 min was considered to be 100%. The percent-survival rate was determined by 
comparing to time point 0 min [47]. Chlorhexidine at the same concentration was used as a 
positive control.

 To complement the confocal imaging analysis, we also quantified the number of viable cells 
in each of the biofilms via standard culturing and propidium monoazide (PMA) combined 
with quantitative PCR (PMA-qPCR) method. At selected time point (19 h), biofilms were 
removed, homogenized via sonication and subject to microbiological analyses as detailed 
previously [47–49]; our sonication procedure does not kill bacteria cells while providing 
optimum dispersal and maximum recoverable counts. Aliquots of biofilm suspensions were 
serially diluted and plated on blood agar plates using an antomated Eddy Jet Spiral Plater 
(IUL, SA, Barcelona, Spain). The combination of PMA and qPCR will quantify only cells 
with intact membrane (i.e. viable cells) because PMA cross-link the DNA of dead cells and 
extracellular DNA, thereby preventing PCR amplification of DNA from these sources [49]. 
Briefly, biofilm pellets were resuspended with 500 μl TE (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, pH 
8.0). Using a pipette, the biofilm suspensions were transferred to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge 
tubes; then mixed with PMA. 1.5 μl PMA (20 mM in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide; Biotium, 
Hayward, CA) was added to the biofilm suspensions. The tubes were incubated in the dark 
for 5 min, at room temperature, with occasional mixing. Next, the samples were exposed to 
light for 3 min (600-W halogen light source). After photo-induced cross-linking, the biofilm 
suspensions were centrifuged (13,000 g/10 min/4°C) and the supernatant was discarded. The 
pellet was resuspended with 100 μl TE, following by incubation with 10.9 μl lysozyme (100 
mg/ml stock) and 5 μl mutanylysin (5 U/μl stock) (37°C/30 min). Genomic DNA was then 
isolated using the MasterPure DNA purification kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI). 
Ten pictograms of genomic DNA per sample and negative controls (without DNA) were 
amplified by MyiQ real-time PCR detection system with iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-
Rad Laboratories Inc., CA) and S. mutans specific primer (16S rRNA) as detailed by Klein 
et al. [49].
Uptake of purified tag-fused GFP proteins and PMAMPs by human oral cell lines
As previously described [44] uptake of GFP fused with CTB, PTD, PG1 and RC101 was 
studied in human periodontal ligament stem cells (HPDLS), maxilla mesenchymal stem 
cells (MMS), human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCC-1), gingiva-derived 
mesenchymal stromal cells (GMSC), adult gingival keratinocytes (AGK) and mouse 
osteoblast cells (OBC). Briefly, 2×104 of each cell line were incubated with purified GFP 
fusion tags in 100 μl PBS/1% FBS at 37°C for 1 h. After fixing with 2% paraformaldehyde 
and stained with DAPI (Vector laboratories, Inc), all cells were imaged using confocal 
microscopy. The images were observed under 100X objective, and at least 10–15 GFP-
positive cells or images were recorded for each cell line in three independent analysis. 
Furthermore, the level of fluorescence intensity was determined using ImageJ and at least 
five area of GFP positive cells were selected to measure the mean GFP density value. The 
normalized GFP intensity was calculated by dividing the values (mean fluorescence density 
readings) from GFP fusion proteins by the values from GFP only. To determine the relative 
GFP fusion tags uptake efficiency by gingiva-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (GMSC) 
and adult gingival keratinocytes (AGK), GMSC and AGK were cultured in chamber slides at 
37°C overnight, followed by incubation with purified GFP fusion proteins at 37°C for 1 h. 
The level of fluorescence intensity was determined using ImageJ and at least five area of 
GFP positive cells were selected to measure the mean GFP density value. The normalized

 GFP intensity was calculated by dividing the values (mean fluorescence density readings) 
from GFP fusion proteins by the values from GFP only.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). All the assays were performed in 
duplicate in at least two distinct experiments. Pair-wise comparisons were made between test 
and control using Student’s t-test. The chosen level of significance for all statistical tests in 
present study was P<0.05.
Results
Expression and purification of GFP fused antimicrobial peptides from transplastomic 
plants
Leaves expressing GFP fused antimicrobial peptides RC101 and PG1 (PMAMPs) were 
harvested from greenhouse and subsequently lyophilized for long-term storage, protein 
extraction and purification. Expression levels of AMPs were similar to what was reported 
previously [14,16]. Purification of GFP fused to different antimicrobial peptides (RC101 and 
PG1) was done in order to test their microbicidal activity against both planktonic and 
biofilm forming S. mutans. Lyophilized leaves expressing different GFP fusions were used 
for extractions and subsequent downstream processing (Supplementary Fig. S1) to obtain 
enriched or purified proteins. Quantitation of purified GFP-RC101 and GFP-PG1 by both 
western blot and native GFP fluorescence gel methods showed high yield of GFP-RC101 
(1624 μg of GFP, 116 μg of RC101) per gm of lyophilized leaf (Fig. 1A and 1B). In GFP-
PG1 both methods showed lower levels of yield (Fig. 1C and 1D), probably due to unique 
secondary structures in addition to lower level of expression. The western blots also showed 
GFP standards at 27 kDa which corresponds to the monomer along with a 54 kDa GFP 
dimer. In GFP-RC101 western blots, 29 kDa and 58 kDa polypeptides are clearly visible 
which correspond to the monomer and dimer forms of the fusion (Fig. 1A). This could be 
attributed to the ability of GFP to form dimers [50]. Native fluorescence of GFP-RC101 and 
GFP-PG1 (Fig. 1B and 1D) and western blots showed multimeric bands with some of them 
visible below the 27 kDa GFP standard size which could be because of GFP fusion to 
cationic peptides causing a electrophoretic mobility shift as described in previous studies 
[16].
Antibacterial Activity of PMAMPs
We first examined the antimicrobial activity of PMAMPs using dose-response studies. The 
MIC and MBC values of GFP-PG1 for S. mutans were 1.25–2.5 μg/ml and 5–10 μg/ml, 
while for GFP-RC101 the MIC and MBC were 10–20 μg/ml and 80–160 μg/ml. 
Furthermore, GFP-PG1 displays potent antibacterial activity (similar to synthetic PG1) 
against S. mutans, a proven biofilm-forming and caries-causing pathogen, rapidly killing the 
bacterial cells within 1 h at low concentrations (Fig. 2A and 2B). GFP-RC101 was less 
efficient in killing S. mutans than GFP-PG1 at similar concentrations, probably due to 
impact of GFP fusion on cyclization of retrocyclin (Fig. 2C and 2D). GFP-PG1 also killed 
other oral bacteria including S. gordonii (that could enhance virulence of periodontal 
pathogens) and A. naeslundii (associated with dental root caries) (Fig. 2E). Time-lapse

 confocal imaging shows that S. mutans viability is affected as early as 10 min as shown in 
Fig. 3A. SEM imaging revealed disruption of S. mutans membrane surface, causing irregular 
cell morphology as well as extrusion of the intracellular content, while untreated bacteria 
showed intact and smooth surfaces without any visible cell lysis or debris (Fig. 3B). Having 
shown potent antimicrobial activity of GFP-PG1 against S. mutans, we examined the 
potential of this PMAMP to prevent biofilm formation or disrupt pre-formed biofilms.
Inhibition of Biofilm Initiation by PMAMP PG1
Preventing the formation of pathogenic oral biofilms is challenging because drugs need to 
exert therapeutic effects following topical applications. To determine whether GFP-PG1 can 
disrupt the initiation of biofilm, we treated saliva coated apatitic (sHA) surface (tooth 
surrogate) with a single topical treatment of GFP-PG1 for 30 min, and then incubated with 
actively growing S. mutans cells in cariogenic (sucrose-rich) conditions. We observed 
substantial impairment of biofilm formation by S. mutans with minimal accumulation of 
EPS-matrix on the GFP-PG1 treated sHA surface (Fig. 4). The few adherent cell clusters 
were mostly non-viable compared to control (Supplementary Fig. S3), demonstrating potent 
effects of GFP-PG1 on biofilm initiation despite topical, short-term exposure. In addition, 
the inhibition of biofilm formation by PG1 was comparable to equivalent concentration of 
chlorhexidine (CHX).
Disruption of pre-formed biofilm by PMAMP with or without EPS-degrading enzymes
Cariogenic biofilms already formed on tooth surfaces are notoriously difficult to treat 
because drugs often fail to reach clusters of pathogenic bacteria (such as S. mutans) that are 
surrounded and enmeshed by an exopolysaccharides (EPS)-rich matrix, protecting them 
against antimicrobials [9]. EPS-degrading enzymes such as dextranase and mutanase could 
help digest the matrix of cariogenic biofilms. We first optimized the units of dextranase 
and/or mutanase required for EPS-matrix disruption (Supplementary Fig. S2), which were 
devoid of antibacterial effects. As shown in Fig. 5A, the combination of dextranase and 
mutanase can digest the EPS (in red) and ‘open space’ (see arrows) between the bacterial 
cell clusters (in green) and ‘uncover’ cells (see arrows). Thus, the combination of PG1 and 
EPS-degrading enzymes could potentiate the overall antibiofilm effects.
To explore this concept, S. mutans biofilms were pre-formed on sHA surface, and treated 
topically with PG1 and EPS-degrading enzymes (Dex/Mut) either alone or in combination. 
Time-lapsed confocal imaging and quantitative computational analyses were conducted to 
analyze EPS-matrix degradation and live/dead bacterial cells within biofilms (Fig. 5B and 
5C). The enzymes-peptide combination resulted in more than 60% degradation of the EPS-
matrix, while increasing the bacterial killing when compared to either PG1 or Dex/Mut 
alone. These findings were further validated via standard culturing assays by determining 
colony forming units. The antibacterial activity of PG1 against S. mutans biofilms combined 
with Dex/Mut was significantly enhanced than either one alone (Fig. 5D). Topical exposure 
of Dex/Mut alone showed no effects on biofilm cell viability, whereas PG1 alone showed 
some killing activity (Fig. 5C and 5D). Together, the data demonstrate potential of this 
combined approach to significantly enhance antimicrobial efficacy of PG1 against

 established biofilms. Furthermore, this approach was as effective as chlorhexidine combined 
with EPS-degrading enzymes (Fig. 5D)
Uptake of GFP fused proteins and PMAMPs by human periodontal and gingival cells
Purified GFP fusion proteins or PMAMPs when incubated with human cultured cells, 
including human periodontal ligament stem cells (HPDLS), Maxilla mesenchymal stem cells 
(MMS), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCC), gingiva-derived mesenchymal 
stromal cells (GMSC), adult gingival keratinocytes (AGK) and mouse osteoblast cell (OBC) 
revealed very interesting results. Although only one representative image of each cell line is 
presented, uptake studies were performed in triplicate and at least 10–15 images were 
recorded under confocal microscopy (Fig. 6A–F). Without a fusion tag, GFP did not enter 
any tested human cell line. Both CTB-GFP and PTD-GFP effectively penetrated all tested 
cell types, although their localization patterns differed. Upon incubation with CTB-GFP, 
GFP signals localized primarily to the periphery of HPDLSC and MMSC, with small 
cytoplasmic puncta in SSC-1, AGK, OBC and large cytoplasmic foci in GMSC. PTD-GFP 
was observed as small cytoplasmic foci in MMSC, variably sized cytoplasmic puncta in 
HPDLSC, GMSC, AGK, OBC and both the cytoplasm and the periphery of SCC-1 cells. 
GFP-PG1 is the most efficient tag in penetrating all tested human cells because GFP uptake 
in GMSC is 30-fold higher than CTB, 17-fold higher than PTD and 48-fold higher than 
RC101. Likewise, in AGK cells GFP-PG1 GFP accumulation is 28-fold higher than CTB, 
13-fold higher than PTD and 40-fold higher than RC101 (Fig. 6G–H). GFP-PG1 showed 
exclusively cytoplasmic localization in HPDLSC, SCC-1, GMSC and AGK cells and was 
localized in both the periphery and cytosol in MMSC, but it is only localized in the 
periphery of OBC. GFP-RC101 entered SCC-1, GMSC, AGK and OBC, but its localization 
in HPDLSC was negligible and was undetectable in MMSC cells.
Discussion
Development of new therapies against biofilm-related oral diseases and maintenance of oral 
health has been limited by enormous economical and drug efficacy hurdles. Therapeutic 
agents need to be effective following topical applications to either prevent biofilm formation 
or disrupt formed biofilms. Furthermore, it needs to be affordable and readily accessible for 
majority of the population affected by oral diseases, especially in lower socio-economic 
communities [7,8]. Here, we report a novel therapeutic concept for controlling oral biofilms 
formed by a model cariogenic pathogen and drug delivery to oral cells using chloroplast 
technology for low-cost production of plant-made antimicrobial peptides (PMAMPs). In 
cariogenic biofilms, S. mutans can rapidly accumulate on tooth surface through EPS 
production, and help to acidify the local microenvironment promoting the growth of an 
acidogenic microbiota that eventually leads to the onset of dental caries [6,10,28,51]. 
Although other acidogenic bacteria contribute to caries pathogenesis, S. mutans is a key 
mediator by assembling an insoluble and diffusion-limiting biofilm EPS matrix [9,51]. Our 
data reveal that PMAMPs, particularly PG1, can efficiently kill S. mutans apparently 
through bacterial membrane disruption.

 The mechanisms of action of PG1 have been explored suggesting bacterial killing by 
permeabilizing their membranes via pore formation [12]. Indeed, we observed that 
propidium iodide (PI), a cell-impermeant molecule that only enters cells with damaged 
membranes, rapidly gain intracellular access following PG1 exposure, while SEM images of 
PG1 treated bacteria provide further evidence of membrane structure disruption. However, 
the membrane-destabilizing mechanisms needs further elucidation, which may involve 
complex surface charge alterations, penetration through lipid bilayer of the membrane and 
PG1 interactions with negatively charged molecules such as teichoic and lipoteichoic acid 
[52]. Further studies using ellipsometry, electrochemistry, and neutron reflectometry 
combined with atomic force microscopy or NMR shall elucidate both the molecular targets 
and structural changes associated with membrane disruption [53–56]. In addition, the 
observed selectivity between microbial and mammalian cells is based on the amphipathic 
nature of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a common denominator for AMPs. Mammalian 
cells contain neutrally charged phosphatidylcholine on the outer cell surface and negatively 
charged phosphatidyl glycerol in the inner cytoplasmic surface. In contrast, outer surface of 
bacteria contain negatively charged lipids phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidylglycerol as 
well as lipopolysaccharides [16, 52]. In gram positive bacteria (lipo)teichoic acids also 
contribute towards the net negative surface charge hence making bacterial cells more anionic 
than mammalian cells [16, 52].
Protegrin has been tested in clinical studies to treat oral mucositis in patients receiving 
chemotherapy in phase II, III clinical studies and lack of toxicity against normal oral cells 
has been well documented [57,58]. The range of concentrations used in this study (<10 
μg/ml) is several-fold less than that used in previous clinical trials and toxicity studies. 
Furthermore, all human cell lines tested remain morphologically intact after treatment with 
different GFP-fused peptides as clearly observed in the confocal images, suggesting lack of 
deleterious cellular effects at the tested concentrations. Plant cells are routinely consumed 
and therefore impurities in plant cell extracts have no negative impact [59] but this approach 
significantly reduces the cost by elimination of the expensive purification processes. Plant-
made PG1 is highly bioactive with similar efficacy as the synthetic peptide (which cost ~
$650,000/gram [14]), demonstrating low cost potential of PMAMPs for biofilm inhibition. 
Currently there are no reports of successful production of functional protegrin or retrocyclin 
in any biological system. They are either chemically synthesized and refolded or expressed 
as linear or fusion proteins, purified and refolded in vitro. Ability to make fully functional 
PMAMPs facilitates their use in topical oral formulations or in chewing gums, thereby 
eliminating the purification process and reducing cost.
Although AMPs have demonstrated great potential as antimicrobial agents, there are 
considerable challenges for their clinical application, including stability of the peptides and 
their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. Previous studies have shown that cyclization 
of linear peptides enhances stability to proteases [60], while PG1 has been also shown to 
inhibit viral proteases [61]. Furthermore, we found that the presence of saliva (which 
contains both mammalian and bacterial-derived proteolytic enzymes) did not affect the 
antibacterial effects of PMAMPs (data not shown), suggesting that the peptides were not 
degraded and the bioactivity unaffected by the salivary proteases.

 The main objective here is to develop a proof of concept that we could use PMAMPs to 
impair biofilm formation mediated by S. mutans using topical treatment akin to clinical 
situation. Currently, chlorhexidine (CHX) is the most effective antimicrobial agent for 
topical use despite its adverse effects [6,10,11]. We observed that PG1 was as potent as 
CHX, causing substantial impairment of biofilm formation with a single topical treatment of 
a tooth-surrogate surface. Similar to CHX, PG1 is highly cationic which could promote 
effective binding onto saliva-coated apatitic surfaces, and thereby perform antibacterial 
activity in situ. Several chemically synthesized antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been 
tested against oral bacteria [12], including peptides with enhanced specificity to S. mutans 
[13]. However, their antibiofilm efficacy has been mostly determined using continuous, 
prolonged exposure to AMPs (several hours) rather than topical exposure and without 
growing biofilms under cariogenic conditions. Furthermore, synthetic AMPs are mostly 
linear and expensive to produce while being less stable (vs. cyclic/hairpin), which provide 
barriers for product development and storage [20–25]. In this study, we show that PMAMPs 
with complex secondary structure (PG1) is an effective inhibitor of biofilm initiation. 
However, similar to CHX [47,62,63], PMAMPs alone was less effective against developed 
S. mutans biofilms, which remains one of the major therapeutic challenges.
Cariogenic biofilms are characterized by bacteria forming cluster (microcolonies) that are 
embedded in EPS matrix, making biofilm treatment and removal extremely difficult 
[9,28,51,62]. This ultimately promotes microbial adhesion and creates a highly cohesive 
biofilm that shelters resident organisms from antimicrobials while ensuring firm attachment 
on tooth surfaces [27–29]. Thus, EPS synthesis makes S. mutans a formidable opponent to 
oral health. Here, we developed a novel synergistic concept of PMAMPs and EPS matrix-
degrading enzymes combination to disrupt pre-formed biofilms and kill embedded S. mutans 
cells. The EPS from S. mutans are comprised primarily of insoluble (with high content of 
α1,3 linked glucose) and soluble (mostly α1,6 linked glucose) glucans [9]. 
Glucanohydrolases, dextranase (α1,6 glucanase) or mutanase (α1,3 glucanase), have been 
explored to disrupt biofilm and prevent dental caries. However, topical applications of 
enzymes alone have generated moderate anti-biofilm/anti-caries effects clinically, in part due 
to lack of antibacterial actions [34,64].
Results presented here show that dextranase and mutanase can effectively digest the EPS 
covering and surrounding the bacterial clusters, significantly enhancing S. mutans killing by 
PMAMPs (~10-fold increase). The glucanohydrolases alone had minimal effects against 
bacterial viability supporting previous observations [34,64]. Conversely, PMAMPs exhibit 
no matrix degrading activity. We infer that matrix structure degradation, especially the α1,3 
and α1,6-linked glucan backbone and the branch points 3,4- and 3,6-linked glucose that are 
optimally digested with mutanase and dextranase [43], facilitated PMAMPs access and 
killing of the exposed bacterial clusters. However, further studies using time-lapse super-
resolution 3D microscopy are required to determine the dynamics of matrix degradation and 
PMAMPs penetration across the biofilm structure. Because PMAMPs fused with GFP is 
retaining potent antimicrobial activity, it should facilitate their fusion with EPS digesting 
enzymes in plant cells for their synergistic activities in degrading the biofilm matrix and 
killing embedded bacteria. This topical antibiofilm approach based on plant-derived PDs 
could drastically enhance disruption of virulent biofilms by targeting both the scaffold and

 bacterial viability, and advance to the clinic as pioneered by Guy’s plant monoclonal 
antibody for human immunotherapy [4].
Retention of high level antimicrobial activity by protegrin along with GFP fusion opens the 
door for a number of clinical applications to enhance oral health, beyond disruption of 
biofilms. Several challenges associated with the high cost and invasive surgical delivery of 
protein drugs in oral health can be addressed. In addition to biofilm disruption, enhancing 
wound healing in the gum tissues is an important clinical need. We recently reported that 
both protegrin and retrocyclin can enter human mast cells and induce degranulation, an 
important step in the wound healing process [14]. Therefore, antimicrobial peptides 
protegrin and retrocyclin could play an important role in killing bacteria in biofilms and 
initiate wound healing through degranulation of mast cells. In addition, it is important to 
effectively deliver growth hormones or other bioactive proteins to enhance cell adhesion, 
stimulate osteogenesis, and differentiation of osteoblasts or endothelial cells. Delivery 
efficacy of GFP fused with each tag, independently, was investigated. CTB is used as an 
ideal transmucosal carrier for oral drug delivery because it enters all human cell types via 
GM1 receptors Protein transduction domain (PTDs) are small cationic peptides that function 
as macromolecular transporters by receptor independent, fluid-phase macropinocytosis (a 
special type of endocytosis) [59]. Therefore, we used both CTB and PTD fusion tags as 
positive controls to evaluate the efficiency of antimicrobial peptides penetrating human 
periodontal and gingival cells. GFP-PG1 is the most efficient tag in entering periodontal or 
gingival human cells because GFP signal could be detected even at 40–48 fold lower 
concentrations than GFP-RC101 in GMSC and AGK cells. Indeed, protegrin is more 
efficient in delivering fusion proteins to human cell lines than any other cell penetrating 
peptide tested so far. Although there were some variations in intracellular localization, GFP-
PG1 effectively entered HPDLSC, SCC-1, GMSC, AGK, MMSC and OBC. In contrast 
GFP-RC101 entered SCC-1, GMSC, AGK and OBC but its localization in HPDLSC and 
MMSC cells were poor or undetectable. Therefore, this study has identified a novel role for 
protegrin in delivering drugs to osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, gingival epithelial 
cells or fibroblasts. It is feasible to release protein drugs synthesized in plant cells by 
mechanical grinding and protein drugs bioencapsulated in lyophilized plant cells embedded 
in chewing gums could be an ideal mode of drug delivery for their slow and sustained 
release for longer duration. This provides an alternative to current oral rinse formulations-
short duration of contact of antimicrobials on the gum/dental surface. However, further in 
vivo and clinical studies are required to evaluate the anti-biofilm/anti-caries efficacy as well 
as targeted, sustained drug-delivery in the oral cavity. Comprehensive in vivo studies are 
underway to demonstrate that PMAMPs can be delivered to gum tissue without cytotoxicity 
and control biofilm formation/dental caries using appropriate human intra-oral models.
Beyond topical application, protein drugs fused with protegrin expressed in plant cells has 
the potential to be orally delivered to gum tissues in a non-invasive manner and increase 
patient compliance. Protein drugs bioencapsulated in plants can be stored for many years at 
room temperature without losing their efficacy [3,65]. The high cost of current protein drugs 
is due to their production in prohibitively expensive fermenters, purification, cold 
transportation/storage, short shelf life and sterile delivery methods. All these challenges 
could be eliminated using this novel drug delivery concept to prevent biofilm-related

protein drugs [1] augurs well for clinical advancement of this novel concept.

 Fig. 3. Bacterial killing by GFP-PG1 as determined via confocal fluorescence (A) and SEM 
imaging (B)
(A) Time-lapse killing of S. mutans treated with GFP-PG1 at 10 μg/ml. The control group 
consisted of S. mutans cells treated with buffer only. Propidium iodide (PI) (in red) was used 
with confocal microscopy to determine the bacterial viability over time at single-cell level. 
PI is cell-impermeant and only enters cells with damaged membranes; in dying and dead 
cells a bright red fluorescence is generated upon binding of PI to DNA. GFP-PG1 is shown 
in green. (B) Morphological observations of S. mutans subjected to GFP-PG1 at a 
concentration of 10 μg/ml for 1 h using scanning electron microscopy. Red arrows show 
dimpled membrane and extrusion of intracellular content.

 Fig. 4. Inhibition of biofilm formation by a single topical treatment of GFP-PG1
This figure displays representative images of three-dimensional (3D) rendering of S. mutans 
biofilm. Bacterial cells were stained with SYTO 9 (in green) and EPS were labeled with 
Alexa Fluor 647 (in red). Saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) disc surface was treated with a 
single topical treatment of GFP-PG1 or chlorhexidine with a short-term 30 min exposure. 
The control group was treated with buffer only. Then, the treated sHA disc was transferred 
to culture medium containing 1% (w/v) sucrose and actively growing S. mutans cells (105 
CFU/ml) and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 19 h. After biofilm growth, the biofilms were 
analyzed by two photon confocal microscopy.

Bacterial cells were stained with SYTO 9 (in green) and EPS were labeled with Alexa Fluor 
647 (in red). The white arrows show ‘opening’ of spaces between the bacterial cell clusters 
and ‘uncovering’ cells following enzymatic degradation of EPS. (B) Time-lapse 
quantification of EPS degradation within intact biofilms using COMSTAT. (C) The viability 
of S. mutans biofilm treated with synthetic PG1 and EPS-degrading enzymes (Dex/Mut) 
either alone or in combination by ImageJ. (D) Antibiofilm activity of synthetic PG1 or 
chlorhexidine was enhanced by EPS-degrading enzymes (Dex/Mut). Asterisks indicate that 
the values for different experimental groups are significantly different from each other 
(P<0.05).
