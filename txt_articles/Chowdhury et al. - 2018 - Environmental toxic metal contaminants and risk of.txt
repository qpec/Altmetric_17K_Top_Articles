ABSTRACT
Objective
To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
epidemiological studies investigating the association 
of arsenic, lead, cadmium, mercury, and copper with 
cardiovascular disease.
DeSiGN
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data SOurceS
PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science searched up to 
December 2017.
review methODS
Studies reporting risk estimates for total 
cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, 
and stroke for levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium, 
mercury, or copper were included. Two investigators 
independently extracted information on study 
characteristics and outcomes in accordance with 
PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Relative risks were 
standardised to a common scale and pooled across 
studies for each marker using random effects meta-
analyses.
reSultS
The review identified 37 unique studies comprising 
348 259 non-overlapping participants, with 13 033 
coronary heart disease, 4205 stroke, and 15 274 
cardiovascular disease outcomes in aggregate. 
Comparing top versus bottom thirds of baseline 
levels, pooled relative risks for arsenic and lead were 
1.30 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.63) and 
1.43 (1.16 to 1.76) for cardiovascular disease, 1.23 
(1.04 to 1.45) and 1.85 (1.27 to 2.69) for coronary 
heart disease, and 1.15 (0.92 to 1.43) and 1.63 (1.14 
to 2.34) for stroke. Relative risks for cadmium and 
copper were 1.33 (1.09 to 1.64) and 1.81 (1.05 to 
3.11) for cardiovascular disease, 1.29 (0.98 to 1.71) 
and 2.22 (1.31 to 3.74) for coronary heart disease, 
and 1.72 (1.29 to 2.28) and 1.29 (0.77 to 2.17) for 
stroke. Mercury had no distinctive association with 
cardiovascular outcomes. There was a linear dose-
response relation for arsenic, lead, and cadmium with 
cardiovascular disease outcomes.
cONcluSiONS
Exposure to arsenic, lead, cadmium, and copper is 
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease and coronary heart disease. Mercury is not 
associated with cardiovascular risk. These findings 
reinforce the importance of environmental toxic 
metals in cardiovascular risk, beyond the roles of 
conventional behavioural risk factors.
Introduction
In recent decades, exposures to environmental toxic 
metals of hydrogeological origin (eg, arsenic, lead, 
cadmium, mercury, and copper) have become a 
global public health concern owing to their potential 
deleterious health effects in humans.1-5 For example, 
according to the World Health Organization and the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer, arsenic 
and cadmium are group I human carcinogens and 
arsenic is the world’s second leading water-borne 
cause of mortality.6 7Metalloids such as arsenic often 
fall into the category of heavy metals due to similarity 
in properties.8 Chronic exposure to high levels of 
arsenic, cadmium, and other toxic metals has also 
been associated with higher risk of cancers of the 
bladder, kidney, liver, lung, and skin.9 Emerging 
evidence suggests that these toxic metals may have 
adverse effects on these outcomes even at lower 
concentrations,5 which might be prevalent in many 
parts of the world.
Additionally, there are increasing suggestions that 
exposure to arsenic and other (often co-occurring) 
toxic metals may be an independent risk factor 
for cardiovascular disease.10 11 However, despite 
their well established role as immunotoxicants and 
carcinogens, the associations between environmental 
toxic metals and risk of clinical cardiovascular disease 
outcomes remain less well characterised. Although 
there are several individual reports published on the 
topic, they vary greatly in sufficient detail (eg, on 
associations with diverse cardiovascular outcomes) 
and in study design (eg, ecological versus individual-
level associations). Interpretation of the earlier reviews 
is difficult, as they were mostly systematic reviews 
without quantitative synthesis of estimates,12 13 
and focused typically on a single toxic metal,14-16 or 
combined estimates from ecological study designs 
(which are prone to suffer from substantial bias and 
confounding).17 Additionally, whether a detrimental 
association with cardiovascular disease exists in low

or medium levels of exposure (ie, typical for many 
global regions) remains unclear. Therefore, given 
the global nature of the toxic metal contamination, 
accurate characterisation of the associations between 
these environmental contaminants and cardiovascular 
disease is essential to understand the aetiology of 
cardiovascular disease, and critically, to inform public 
health efforts to reduce toxic metal exposure.
To help clarify the evidence, we aimed to summarise 
the available population based epidemiological 
studies in a comprehensive systematic review and 
meta-analysis to determine the associations of selected 
metal contaminants (measured at individual level) 
with the risk of first-ever cardiovascular outcomes 
(including cardiovascular disease, coronary heart 
disease, and stroke), and quantify any dose-response 
relation. For the current study, we focus primarily on 
five major toxic metals or metalloids, owing to their 
global public health relevance. We have included 
arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury, which have 
been included in the World Health Organization’s list 
of “Ten chemicals of major public health concern” and 
have potential mechanistic links to cardiovascular 
diseases.18 19 In addition, we have included copper as 
it appears to promote atherosclerosis by enhancing the 
oxidation of LDL-cholesterol and may increase the risk 
of clinical cardiovascular disease outcomes.20-23
Methods
Search strategy
This study was conducted in accordance with 
the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines (see fig 1 
and 
supplementary 
materials, 
table 
S1). 
We 
comprehensively searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and 
Web of Science electronic databases to identify studies 
published until 5 December 2017 (date of last search), 
which examined the association between arsenic, lead, 
cadmium, mercury, and copper with primary outcomes 
of interest. The primary outcomes were coronary heart 
disease (defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, 
angina, coronary revascularisation (ie, percutaneous 
transluminal 
coronary 
angioplasty 
or 
coronary 
artery bypass surgery, or coronary heart disease 
death), stroke (defined as fatal or nonfatal stroke), 
and composite cardiovascular disease (comprised 
of coronary heart disease and stroke). The computer 
based searches combined search terms related to the 
toxic metal exposures (eg, arsenic*, lead*, mercury*, 
etc) and outcomes of interest (eg, cardiovascular 
disease*, myocardial infarction*, stroke*, etc), without 
any language restriction. Further studies were sought 
by manually searching reference lists of the relevant 
articles. When relevant information was unavailable, 
efforts were made to contact corresponding authors. 
Details of the search strategy are presented in 
supplementary materials, appendix 1.
Selection criteria
We included studies if they met the following initial 
search criteria: were prospective cohort, case-control, 
or nested case-control in design; had sampled from 
healthy (ie, participants or referents, where appropriate, 
were based on initially healthy participants) or general 
populations (ie, populations with both healthy and 
prevalent cases of cardiovascular disease at baseline); 
assessed toxic metal exposure at individual level rather 
than aggregate level (eg, individual-level exposure to 
arsenic in drinking water); or reported risk estimates 
for cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, 
or stroke, for at least one toxic metal. We excluded 
studies for the following reasons: they only reported 
on mean levels and standard deviations of toxic metals 
in cases and non-cases; they only assessed exposure 
to toxic metals using a self reported dietary measure; 
or were cross-sectional or ecological in design. Two 
independent reviewers screened the search results 
to assess conformity with selection criteria, with 
disagreement resolved with a third reviewer. In cases 
of multiple publications from a single study, we used 
the most up to date information.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data on the following characteristics were extracted 
independently by two investigators using standardised 
protocols: sample size; study design; sampling 
population; location (defined as Europe, North 
America, and the Asia-Pacific region); year of baseline 
survey; study design; age range of participants 
at baseline; sex; mean levels of environmental 
contaminants at baseline; sample type (serum, 
plasma, or adipose tissue), storage temperature, assay 
methods; duration of follow-up; numbers of disease 
outcomes of interest and reported effect estimates with

each marker for each outcome; and degree of statistical 
adjustment used (defined as ‘+’ when relative risks were 
adjusted for age and sex only; ‘++’ when adjusted for 
established vascular risk factors (eg, age, sex, smoking 
status, lipids, hypertension, history of cardiometabolic 
disease); and ‘+++’ when adjusted other additional 
factors (eg, social status)). Adequate adjustments for 
these factors are essential to control for the potential 
confounding effect by these factors in influencing both 
levels of toxic metals and the risk of cardiovascular 
disease, resulting in a spurious association. Two 
independent reviewers used the Newcastle-Ottawa 
scale to assess the quality of the included studies.24 
This scale uses a star system (with a maximum of nine 
stars) to assess the quality of a study in three domains: 
selection of participants; comparability of study 
groups; and the ascertainment of outcomes of interest. 
Studies that scored nine stars were considered to be of 
high quality, studies that scored seven or eight stars 
were considered to be of medium quality, and studies 
that scored less than seven stars were considered to be 
of low quality.
Data synthesis and analysis
To enable a consistent approach to meta-analysis 
and interpretation of findings in this review, 
relative risk estimates for the association of toxic 
metals and cardiovascular disease, coronary heart 
disease, and stroke were transformed to consistently 
correspond to the comparison of the top versus 
bottom third of the distribution in each study, using 
methods previously described.25 Briefly, log risk 
estimates were transformed assuming a normal 
distribution, with the comparison between top and 
bottom thirds being equivalent to 2.18 times the 
log relative risk for a 1 standard deviation increase 
(or equivalently, as 2.18/2.54 times the log relative 
risk for a comparison of extreme quarters). Standard 
errors of the log relative risks were calculated using 
published confidence limits and were transformed in 
the same way. For example, the study by Kromhout 
et al reported a relative risk of cardiovascular 
disease of 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.47 to 
2.37) comparing the top versus bottom quartile 
of lead exposure, corresponding to a log relative 
risk of 0.058 and standard errors (log relative risk) 
of 0.41.26 The conversion of risk estimates to top 
versus bottom third exposure of lead in this study
is performed as follows: log relative risk(top v bottom third)
=(2.18/2.54)*0.058=0.05 and standard errors log 
relative risk(top v bottom third)=(2.18/2.54)*0.41=0.35.
We calculated summary relative risks by pooling the 
study-specific estimates using a random- effects model 
that included between study heterogeneity (parallel 
analyses used fixed-effect models). We assessed the 
consistency of findings across individual studies by 
standard χ2 tests and the Ι2 statistic.27 We assessed 
heterogeneity between observational cohorts by 
comparing results from studies grouped according to 
prespecified study level characteristics (such as study 
design, location, year of baseline survey, duration of 
follow-up, numbers of outcomes recorded, outcome 
definition, degree of statistical adjustment used, and 
sample type) using meta-regression. In particular, 
for studies investigating the association of arsenic 
with cardiovascular disease outcomes, the impact of 
the measurement source (biomarker v water) on risk 
estimates was assessed in subgroup analyses. We 
assessed evidence of publication bias across studies 
using funnel plots and Egger test for outcomes where 
at least three studies were available.28
We performed dose-response meta-analyses using 
generalised least-squares trend estimation (GLST) 
analysis as described by Greenland and Longnecker.29 
We estimated study-specific slopes (linear trends) 
from the correlated natural logs of the relative risks 
across toxic metal exposure categories. Only studies 
that reported the number of cases, non-cases, person 
years of follow-up, and the relative risks with the 
variance estimates for at least three quantitative 
exposure categories were included. The median or 
mean level of the toxic metal in the original scale 
was assigned to the corresponding relative risk for 
each exposure category. If data were not available, 
we estimated the median using the midpoint of each 
category. When the highest or lowest category was 
open, we assumed it to be of the same amplitude as the 
adjacent category. Potential nonlinear dose-response 
relations were examined by modelling levels of toxic 
metals using restricted cubic splines.30 A P value 
for nonlinearity was calculated by testing the null 
hypothesis that the coefficient of the second spline is 
equal to zero. All statistical tests were two sided and 
used a significance level of P<0.05. We performed all 
analyses using Stata version 12 (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX).

Results
Study level characteristics
A total of 37 unique studies reporting on 348 259 
distinct patients were identified, including relevant 
available data on arsenic (12 studies), lead (11), 
cadmium (8), mercury (9), and copper (6) (see table 1, 
fig 1, and supplementary material, table S3).
Overall, 12 of these studies were based in North 
America, 17 in Europe, and 8 in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Thirty three studies were prospective (26 cohorts and 
7 nested case-control (ie, case-control study nested 
in a cohort study) or case-cohort studies) and four 
studies were case-control studies. Environmental 
contaminant measurement methods used in each 
study are detailed in supplementary materials, table 
S4. Primary sources of measurement for arsenic were 
individual-level drinking water (6 studies), urine (4), 
and toenails (2). Lead and copper levels in blood were 
measured in all studies. Cadmium levels in urine were 
reported in three studies, in blood in four studies, 
and in toenails in one study. Exposure to mercury 
levels was measured in hair (2 studies), blood (4), or 
toenail (3) samples (supplementary material, table 
S4). Average baseline levels of contaminants in studies 
reporting baseline exposure ranged from 3.7 μg/L to 
4.9 μg/L for arsenic in urine and 0.7 μg/L to 131.1 
μg/L for arsenic in drinking water, whereas baseline 
levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, and copper in blood 
ranged from 2.6 μg/dL to 44.3 μg/dL, 0.44 μg/L to 1.3 
μg/L, 0.004 μg/L to 3.5 μg/L, and 0.96 mg/L to 1.27 
mg/L respectively. Table 2 and table 3 show that study 
quality assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale 
varied. Most studies were of medium to high quality 
(score ≥7). Twelve studies (10 cohort, 2 case-control) 
were of low quality. 
associations between environmental contaminants 
and the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes
Thirty five studies were included in the meta-analysis 
of environmental contaminants and cardiovascular 
disease outcomes. Six studies (one reporting on 
arsenic, two on cadmium, three on mercury) which 
did not use an appropriate assessment of heavy metal 
exposure (ie, use of cadmium levels in toenails) or 
did not adjust for important confounders of heavy 
metal exposure (eg, smoking for cadmium or seafood 
intake for mercury) were excluded from the analysis 
(table 1). In total, 14 706, 12 033, and 3613 cases of 
cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and 
stroke, respectively, across 35 contributing studies 
were included in the meta-analysis. The total follow-up 
duration ranged from five to 36 years in the prospective 
studies. Twenty three studies adjusted for conventional 
risk factors for cardiovascular disease including 
age, sex, and sociodemographic factors (ethnicity, 
education, income) as well as additional risk factors 
such as smoking status, blood pressure, lipids, and 
medical history. Thirteen studies adjusted for age, sex, 
and sociodemographic factors. Three studies adjusted 
for age and sex only. Figure 2 shows the summary plot 
for cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, 
and stroke comparing participants in the top third with 
those in the bottom third of various environmental 
contaminants. Figure 3, figure 4, and figure 5 show the 
forest plots for each separate outcome.
Arsenic, 
lead, 
cadmium, 
and 
copper 
were 
significantly associated with the risk of coronary heart 
disease, with respective relative risks of 1.23 (95% 
confidence interval 1.04 to 1.45), 1.85 (1.27 to 2.69), 
1.29 (0.98 to 1.71), and 2.22 (1.31 to 3.74). There was 
no association of mercury levels with coronary heart 
disease, relative risk of 0.99 (0.65 to 1.49). There was 
evidence of heterogeneity in coronary heart disease 
estimates across studies for most environmental 
contaminants (I2=78%, P<0.001 for arsenic; I2=66%, 
P=0.005 for lead; I2=52%, P=0.08 for cadmium; 
I2=85%, P<0.001 for mercury; and I2=67%, P=0.03 for 
copper;).
Similar to the risk of coronary heart disease, arsenic, 
lead, cadmium, and copper levels were also associated 
with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease 
(respective relative risks of 1.30, 95% confidence

risks of 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 2.34 and 
1.72, 1.29 to 2.28) with no evidence of heterogeneity 
across studies (I2=0%, P=0.76 and I2=10%, P=0.33). 
There was no evidence of an association of arsenic 
with risk of stroke, with little to no evidence of 
heterogeneity in stroke estimates across studies for 
either contaminant (I2=56%, P=0.08).
Dose-response meta-analyses
The dose-response relations between levels of toxic 
metals and cardiovascular outcomes, based on 
available relevant data are shown in supplementary 
materials, figure S1. Only two studies reporting on 
exposure to arsenic in drinking water, three studies 
reporting on exposure to cadmium, and four studies 
reporting on exposure to lead, provided sufficient 
information to perform the dose-response analysis. In 
summary, for baseline arsenic levels in well water and 
risk of cardiovascular disease, there was evidence of a 
linear association across the full spectrum of arsenic 
levels (0 μg/L to 369.5 μg/L, P=0.31 for nonlinearity; 
see supplementary material, fig S1A). Similarly, 
there was evidence of a linear association between 
lead levels in blood and the risk of coronary heart 
disease (P=0.677 for nonlinearity; see supplementary 
material, fig S1B), with a pooled relative risk for risk 
of coronary heart disease per 5 μg/dL increment in 
lead levels being 1.07 (95% confidence interval 1.04 
to 1.10). By contrast, for the association between 
cadmium levels in urine and the risk of cardiovascular 
disease, an initial steep increase in risk (within 
urine cadmium levels of 0.11 μg/g to 1.41 μg/g) was 
followed by a weaker increase in risk beyond 1.41 
μg/g. The relative risk of cardiovascular disease for 
each 0.75 μg/g increment of cadmium was 1.21 
(95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.33, P=0.656 for 
nonlinearity; see supplementary materials, fig S1C). 
There was a significant linear association between 
cadmium levels in urine and the risk of coronary heart 
disease (P=0.865 for nonlinearity; see supplementary 
materials, fig S1D).
Subgroup analyses and assessment of 
publication bias
Little of the variation in risk estimates across 
contaminants was explained by any of the recorded 
study level characteristics (P>0.05 for most factors 
investigated; see supplementary materials, fig S2-
S6). For example, there was no significant difference 
in relative risks for cardiovascular disease across 
the types of individual exposures (eg, blood v other 
measurement sources; P>0.05). Additionally, pooled 
relative risks were all generally similar regardless 
of the level of adjustment for possible confounding 
factors considered in the included studies, by 
geographical location, baseline health, or size of the 
studies. In analyses investigating the effect of arsenic 
measurement source (urine and toenails v water) on 
risk estimates of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart 
disease, and stroke, risk estimates were comparable 
between studies with no evidence of significant 
heterogeneity between studies measuring arsenic in 
drinking water versus biomarkers (see supplementary 
materials, fig S7). Subgroup analyses comparing the 
risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, 
and stroke in never-smokers compared to current and 
former smokers produced similar results for arsenic 
and cadmium exposure (see supplementary materials, 
fig S8 and S9). Funnel plots (see supplementary 
materials, fig S10-S14) and tests for publication bias 
for other markers and outcomes were non-significant 
for most contaminants (P>0.05), however, there was

discussion
Principal findings
We have conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis, using non-overlapping data from 
approximately 350 000 participants from 37 studies, 
to help clarify available evidence on the associations 
of environmental toxic elements with the risk of 
cardiovascular disease. Overall, our results indicate 
that exposures to arsenic, lead, cadmium, and copper 
are each positively and importantly associated with 
cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease, 
cardiovascular disease and stroke, or all cardiovascular 
outcomes. By contrast, mercury was not significantly 
associated with cardiovascular risk. Additionally, based 
on relevant available data, the shape of associations 
for levels of arsenic, lead, and cadmium with 
cardiovascular outcomes was approximately linear.

comparison with other studies
Findings observed in this review may have several 
potential explanations. We found a positive association 
of arsenic, an environmental toxic metal found in large 
quantities in rice and groundwater in many parts of 
the world, with the risk of coronary heart disease.76 
77 Arsenic exposure has been reported to accelerate 
and exacerbate atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein 
E-knockout mice.78 79 Clinical and experimental 
studies of arsenic exposure have reported the 
production of reactive oxygen species in endothelial 
cells,80 up regulation of inflammatory signals,81 and 
higher blood pressure.82-84 These findings extend 
several previous epidemiological studies that reported 
striking associations with Blackfoot disease (a severe 
peripheral vascular disease) in people exposed to 
extremely high cumulative doses of arsenic.85 86
Although circulating levels of lead seem to be in 
decline in the developed world,87 owing principally 
to the concomitant decrease in the usage of leaded 
gasoline and leaded paint, lead exposure remains 
considerably high in many areas.5 88 The strong 
positive association found in our review between lead 
and the risk of cardiovascular disease, reinforces lead

exposure as a major public health concern.89 Two key 
pathways by which lead has been implicated in the 
risk of cardiovascular disease are mediation through 
accelerated systolic blood pressure and damage to 
renal function.90 Previous studies have also suggested 
an association of lead with atherosclerosis as a result 
of lead-induced oxidative stress and inflammation 
after exposure.11 15
The present review also shows a positive association 
of copper with cardiovascular disease, as suggested in 
previous studies.91 92 While copper is an essential trace 
element, excess copper can induce oxidative stress 
by generation of reactive oxygen species.11 Copper-
mediated lipid peroxidation has been demonstrated in 
several in vivo and in vitro studies.21 Another possible 
mechanism for the potential deleterious effects of 
copper is through a copper-homocystein complex 
which have been suggested to induce endothelial 
dysfunction and vascular injury.93 For both arsenic and 
copper, albeit based on limited data, the potentially 
linear dose-response relation that we have observed 
indicates that even at lower average exposure levels 
(common in many global regions), these toxic metals 
may have a detrimental impact on vascular health.
We also observed a positive association between 
levels of cadmium and cardiovascular disease, 
which was independent of several potential risk of 
cardiovascular disease factors (including smoking 
status). Cadmium’s adverse effects on the vascular 
system are thought to be mediated by oxidative stress, 
inflammation, and endothelial cell damage, which can 
result in atherosclerosis. This is important as cadmium 
is widely prevalent in groundwater and common plant-
based foods (eg, rice and vegetables).94
Conversely, mercury, a potentially toxic trace metal 
that humans are exposed to primarily through fish 
consumption,95 was not significantly associated with 
the risk of cardiovascular disease in the current review. 
Although some individual studies have observed 
inverse relations between mercury levels and the risk 
of cardiovascular disease,62 66 there is currently no 
accepted biological explanation that supports such a 
link.66
Strengths and limitations of the study
Strengths and limitations of this work merit careful 
consideration. This is the first comprehensive meta-
analysis of several key environmental toxic metals 
in relation to the risk of cardiovascular disease. We 
have focused solely on individual-level assessments of 
exposure to toxic metals, and performed our analyses 
based primarily on toxic metals measured directly using 
an objective biomarker or well established measures of 
individual level exposure such as arsenic in drinking 
water. However, it should be noted that the biological

ability to reflect long term exposure may differ across 
various biomarkers.96 Therefore, to ensure consistent 
long term exposure assessment, the use of repeated 
measurements over time that accounts for any potential 
individual variation in levels (ie, regression dilution)97 
should be considered in future studies.55 Furthermore, 
most studies that measured arsenic and cadmium 
levels in urine were based on spot or first morning void 
samples, which might be limited by the fact that they 
reflect the hydration status of the individual at the time 
of collection, and therefore, may differ markedly in 
dilution owing to differences in urinary flow rate,98 and 
differences in stability and reproducibility of metals 
measured in them. Additionally, although over half the 
risk estimates for urinary arsenic and cadmium from 
all included studies were creatinine adjusted, some 
were unadjusted for any marker of urinary dilution. 
While this review is limited to published findings, 
the use of individual participant data, in future large-
scale primary studies, would allow a more detailed 
and specific assessment of the association between 
the considered environmental toxic metals and 
cardiovascular disease, including: assessing the role of 
routes of exposure (eg, environmental v occupational); 
a standardised adjustment for confounders (eg, 
smoking status); reduce heterogeneity resulting from 
meta-analysis of diverse study populations; and a 
more consistent characterisation of any potential 
dose-response 
relation. 
Such 
comprehensive 
assessments are currently underway.99 100 Equally, 
our review was solely based on observational data 
which might be affected by unmeasured confounders 
– making a causal inference difficult. In this regard, 
an earlier randomised trial, based on people with 
pre-existing cardiovascular disease, suggested that 
moderate reduction of cardiovascular events occured 
after intravenous chelation therapy (which facilitates 
urinary excretion of heavy metals)101 compared with 
placebo. However, further conclusive trials, especially 
those involving general populations, are needed. 
Additionally, the identification of polymorphisms 
influencing circulating levels of these toxic metals 
which can be used as proxies for circulating levels 
(such as polymorphisms near AS3MT, MT1A/B),102-104 
may also allow future investigations of potential causal 
associations with disease using instrumental variable 
analysis (ie, mendelian randomisation analyses).105
implications for clinicians and policy makers
Our findings may have important policy and scientific 
implications. 
Firstly, 
these 
findings 
highlight 
the importance of environmental toxic metals in 
enhancing cardiovascular risk, beyond the roles of 
conventional behavioural risk factors (such as tobacco 
use and unhealthy diet). These results may have 
a key policy implication given that current global 
noncommunicable disease prevention strategies (eg, 
WHO 2018 Report)106 are focused primarily on tackling 
behavioural determinants. Recognising environmental 
factors (such as toxic metals) as additional priorities, 
therefore, will help gain wider sociopolitical support 
for setting up appropriate legislation, preventive 
strategies and standards, and investment to tackle 
these major global determinants of cardiovascular 
diseases. 
Secondly, 
the 
observed 
associations 
appeared approximately linear for arsenic, lead, and 
cadmium levels with cardiovascular disease outcomes, 
indicating the risk of adverse health consequences 
even at a relatively low exposure of these toxic metals. 
Nonetheless, these current findings warrant further 
detailed research to reliably quantify suboptimal levels 
to define individuals at risk and to trigger appropriate 
clinical action. Presently, in clinical practice, toxicity 
for these metals, if suspected, are established through 
a range of diagnostic investigations including blood 
and 24-hour urinary analyses and typically involving 
an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 
analytical technique for elemental determinations.107 
Treatment options for heavy metal toxicity include 
various antidotes and chelating agents (which 
enhance the elimination of metals from the body) such 
as succimer (DMSA), unithiol (DMPS), sodium calcium 
edetate, and dimercaprol.108 However, since efficacy 
and response of these therapies vary greatly,109 
primary prevention, by developing evidence based 
public health guidelines and innovative low cost, 
scalable interventions to reduce human exposure to 
these contaminants, should be prioritised.
conclusion
Results of this meta-analysis indicate that exposure 
to arsenic, lead, cadmium, and copper is associated 
with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and 
coronary heart disease. By contrast, mercury was not 
associated with cardiovascular risk. These findings 
reinforce the (often under-recognised) importance 
of environmental toxic metals in cardiovascular risk, 
beyond the roles of conventional behavioural risk 
factors. Further detailed work, however, to better 
characterise these associations and to assess causality, 
is needed.
