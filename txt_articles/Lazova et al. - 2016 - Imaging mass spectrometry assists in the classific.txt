Introduction
Histopathological examination is currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
melanocytic lesions. However, distinguishing Spitz nevi (SN) from Spitzoid melanomas 
(SM) using current histopathological criteria may be very challenging and is one the most 
difficult areas in Dermatopathology.1-4 Some problematic cases may show overlapping 
features of both SN and SM and are often termed Atypical Spitzoid Neoplasms (ASN). It 
has been demonstrated in a number of studies that it can be difficult to predict the clinical 
behavior of ASN from assessment of histopathological features and the interobserver 
reproducibility of pathologists for the diagnosis of these tumors is generally poor.1-5
Previously, we highlighted proteomic differences between the melanocytic tumor cells of SN 
and SM and identified a molecular signature of five peptides that could correctly classify the 
tumors.6 In this study, we sought to determine whether Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) 
could assist in the diagnosis and risk stratification of ASN by performing IMS in a large 
series of cases with known clinical follow-up, by comparing in each case the diagnosis 
rendered by IMS with the histopathological diagnosis and also correlating the diagnoses 
with clinical outcome.
Materials and Methods
Sample and Clinical Data Collection
We defined ASNs as melanocytic lesions with architectural and cytologic features shared by 
both Spitz nevi and Spitzoid melanomas, for which a definitive histopathological diagnosis 
of either SN or SM could not be confidently rendered by an experienced 
dermatopathologist.4, 7-9 In our opinion, ASN is the most appropriate term for these lesions, 
since they are truly “neoplasms” and can be either benign or malignant, and “Spitzoid” 
describes the cytologic and architectural resemblance to Spitz nevus.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study of ASNs performed to date. A total of 
252 ASN cases were contributed by centers from 11 countries throughout the world and 11 
centers from the US including the Yale Spitzoid Neoplasm Repository. All cases had some 
degree of ambiguity that prompted an original diagnosis of ASN. Although in some cases 
either Spitz nevus or Spitzoid melanoma was favored, such diagnoses were considered by no 
means reasonably certain by the experienced dermatopathologists who reviewed the cases. 
The entire cohort of ASN cases consisted of difficult ambiguous lesions in the gray/
borderline area. All submitted cases were reviewed by a minimum of three experienced 
dermatopathologists who agreed on the classification of ASN. The cases of ASN were

 originally diagnosed as such by the dermatopathologist(s) who contributed the case to the 
study. These cases were reviewed at intradepartmental consensus conference and only cases 
with diagnostic uncertainty were included in the study. In addition, the first author re-
reviewed all cases before they entered the study. Histopathological criteria used in the 
evaluation and classification of a lesion as an ASN included (but were not limited to) the 
following: asymmetry, sheet-like growth pattern, expansile nodular growth, lack of 
maturation, ulceration of the epidermis, presence of mitotic figures, deep or atypical mitotic 
figures, deep extension into the subcutis, or large size (>1 cm). Initial inclusion criteria were 
a histopathological diagnosis of ASN and the availability of clinical follow-up information. 
A total of 252 ASN cases were initially included. Due to lack of follow-up, insufficient 
melanocytic component to perform the analysis, or technical difficulties 150 ASN cases 
were subsequently excluded.
A total of 102 cases meeting all of the above criteria were identified. Clinical and 
histopathological parameters were recorded for all cases including patient age, gender, 
tumor thickness, primary tumor anatomical location, presence or absence of ulceration, and 
mitotic rate in accordance with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).10 We 
adopted the clinical classification used by Gerami et al11 in their study of ASNs – the cases 
were categorized into 4 clinical groups on the basis of their clinical behavior (Table 1).
Of the total cohort of 102 cases, 94 cases were in Group 1, which was further subdivided 
into 3 subgroups: 1a (58 cases), 1b (26 cases), and 1c (10 cases). There were 4 cases in 
Group 2, 1 case in Group 3, and 3 cases in Group 4. Groups 2, 3 and 4 included patients 
with poor clinical outcome defined as either recurrence of disease, metastasis in non-sentinel 
lymph node(s) and/or distant metastases and death of disease (Table 2).
Imaging Mass Spectrometry
IMS was performed on all ASN cases using a previously published methodology in which 
IMS was employed to discriminate between SN and SM.6 In brief, 5μm-thick formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were used from each case after de-paraffinization. 
On average, twenty areas of interest from the melanocytic component, each measuring 300 
μm in diameter, were mapped on each slide representing a single case. The mass spectral 
profile was acquired for each one of these areas of interest. The resultant spectra were 
compared to a proteomic signature composed of 5 proteins and each area of interest was 
designated as either consistent with SN or consistent with SM. For each case to be 
diagnosed as SN or SM, an overwhelming number of the areas of interest (>66%) had to be 
designated by the instrument as such. A detailed description of this method and the 
instruments used can be found elsewhere.6, 12 In this study we used the very same algorithm, 
classification method and criteria that we did in our original study.6 A diagnosis of either SN 
or SM was rendered by IMS, which was then correlated with various clinicopathologic 
features and compared with the histopathological diagnosis and clinical outcome.
Statistical analysis
Fisher's exact test was used to compare the frequency of cases diagnosed as SM by IMS 
between Group 1 versus Groups 2, 3 and 4. The same analysis was also performed

 comparing Groups 1 and 2 versus Groups 3 and 4 and P-values were calculated. Possible 
associations were examined by using logistic regression analyses with the AJCC prognostic 
factors (patient age, gender, primary tumor anatomical location, tumor thickness, ulceration 
status, and mitotic rate), considered separately as predictors of clinical category (Group 1 
versus groups to 2-4). The association of histopathological diagnosis and clinical outcome 
was also assessed using Fisher's exact test.
Results
A total of 102 ASNs with sufficient clinical follow-up data were included in the study and 
analyzed by IMS. The patients’ ages ranged from 2 to 83 years (average 32.6). There were 
53 women and 49 men. The most common primary tumor anatomical location was the lower 
extremity (41 cases) followed by the trunk (28 cases), the upper extremity (16 cases), and 
the head and neck region (16 cases). The anatomical site of one case was unknown. The 
tumor thickness ranged from 0.4 mm to 5.5 mm (mean 2.1). The follow-up ranged from 0.5 
to 25 years (mean 7.7).
The patients were categorized in 4 clinical groups. Group 1 comprised 94 patients and 
included 3 categories - a, b, and c. Group 1a comprised 58 cases, in which the patients had 
no evidence of disease after re-excision and in which SLN biopsy was not performed. Of 
these 2/58 (3.4%) cases were diagnosed as SM by IMS and the rest of the cases, 56/58 
(96.6%) were diagnosed as SN. In case #9, diagnosed as SM by IMS, a diagnosis of SM 
with depth of 3.0 mm was also favored histopathologically. The patient was alive with no 
evidence of disease (ANED) 15 years after the initial diagnosis.
Group 1b included 26 cases with no evidence of disease after re-excision and negative SLN 
biopsy. Of those 2/26 (7.7%) cases (#39 and #40) were diagnosed as SM by IMS and 24 
(92.3%) cases were diagnosed as SN. In the 2 cases diagnosed as SM by IMS, a diagnosis of 
SM was also favored histopathologically. The lesions were 1.0 and 4.2 mm thick, 
respectively, and both patients were ANED at 3 and 2 years, respectively. There were 10 
cases in Group 1c, which consisted of patients with positive SLN(s) but no evidence of 
disease after re-excision. Four cases (40%), (#41, 100, 145 and 146), were diagnosed as SM 
by IMS and a diagnosis of SM was favored histopathologically. The depth in these cases 
ranged between 1.65 and 2.45 mm (mean 2.0). All patients were ANED at 3, 1, 3 and 3 
years of follow-up, respectively. The other 6/10 cases in Group 1c (#47, 106, 108, 96, 112, 
148) were diagnosed as SN by IMS. Three of these patients (#47, 106 and 108) had a 
histopathological diagnosis favoring SM with thickness ranging between 3.25 and 3.7 mm 
(mean 3.5). The follow-up interval ranged between 2.5 and 13 years (mean 7.2). Patient 
#106, who was 12-years-old at the time of the initial histopathological diagnosis favoring 
SM with thickness of 3.7 mm, was ANED for 6 years until he was killed in a car accident at 
the age of 18.13 Patient #108 with a histopathological diagnosis favoring SM with thickness 
of 3.25 mm had 2 positive SLNs and FISH results showing 3 out of 4 genetic abnormalities 
in favor of melanoma. The patient was ANED 2.5 years after the initial diagnosis. The other 
3 cases from clinical Group 1c (#148, 96 and 112), diagnosed as SN by IMS, had a 
histopathological diagnosis of ASN with tumor thicknesses of 1.75, 4.0 and 5.0 mm,

 respectively (mean 3.58). The follow-up period ranged between 4 and 10 years (mean 7.2) 
and the patients were ANED.
Clinical Group 2 included 4 patients with locoregional disease in non-sentinel lymph nodes 
(#33, 35, 36 and 93). Two of them, cases #33 and #36, were diagnosed as SM by IMS. A 
diagnosis of SM for these cases was also favored histopathologically. Patient #36, diagnosed 
as SM by IMS, had a follow-up of 16 years and was ANED after a single recurrence at the 
same site 8 years following the original diagnosis. The other 2 patients (#35 and 93) were 
diagnosed as SN by IMS. Patient #35, a 58-year-old man, whose lesion from the ear (depth 
4.25 mm) was originally diagnosed favoring SN histopathologically, was also diagnosed as 
SN by IMS. This lesion was completely excised but 15 years later there was a recurrence at 
the site of the primary lesion, which was also excised and diagnosed histopathologically as 
favoring recurrent SN. A subsequent follow-up for another 10 years (25 years total) did not 
show any further recurrences or metastases.
Clinical Group 3 comprised 1 patient with distant metastases, case #94. A diagnosis of SM 
was rendered by IMS and favored histopathologically (depth 2.25 mm). The patient was 
alive with disease but was lost to follow-up 1 year after the initial diagnosis. In clinical 
Group 4 were 3 patients with distant metastases and death of disease, cases # 12, 38, 131. 
All cases were diagnosed as SM by IMS, and a diagnosis of SM was also favored 
histopathologically. The patient characteristics of the 102 cases together with the IMS 
diagnosis and clinical outcome are summarized in Table 3.
The p-value comparing the frequency of IMS SM diagnosis in Group 1 versus Groups 2-4 
by the Fisher's exact test was p<0.0001, indicating a very strong association between the 
IMS diagnosis of SM and poor clinical outcome based on clinical follow-up. We also 
compared the cases in Groups 1 and 2 against those in Groups 3 and 4. The Fisher's exact 
test showed statistically significant difference with p=0.0002. In this comparison there was 
also a strong association between the IMS diagnosis of SM and clinical category. For 
comparison, the association of histopathological diagnosis of SM and the clinical category 
was also statistically significant but not as strong (p=0.001 for the comparison of Group 1 
vs. Groups 2-4, p=0.02 for the comparison of Groups 1 and 2 vs. Groups 3 and 4).
In 13 cases, SM was the diagnosis rendered by IMS and favored on histopathological 
analysis (Table 3). In 10 out of these 13 cases (77%), there were adverse events including 
SLN metastasis, positive non-sentinel lymph nodes, recurrence, distant metastases and/or 
death (Figure 1). In 24 cases, while the histopathological examination favored SM, the IMS 
diagnosis was SN and the patients had no adverse clinical outcome (Figure 2). In 38 cases 
the histopathological diagnosis was ASN (without favoring either SN or SM) while the IMS 
diagnosis was SN. The clinical behavior in all these cases was benign (Figure 3). In 26 
cases, SN was favored histopathologically and a diagnosis of SN was also rendered by IMS 
and all of these patients were ANED (Figure 4).

 Discussion
The ‘gray’ category of ASNs is artificial and relatively broad category.2-4,14-17 Currently, 
based on histopathological examination and using the available histopathological criteria, we 
cannot categorize these cases with certainty and thus predict their behavior.1,8,11,18-22 IMS is 
a bio-analytical method for identifying the nature and spatial distribution of metabolites, 
peptides and proteins, DNA segments and lipids from tissue samples. It has been used to 
clarify the molecular signatures of various types of cancer and other diseases.23-26 Molecular 
signatures usually present as a unique combination of 5-20 proteins and enable a specific 
diagnosis.26 Protein and peptide analysis is superior to gene expression analysis, as it 
represents the actual functional state of the disease/tumor rather than the potential risk of 
developing it. Furthermore, post-translational modification is thus also taken into account. In 
a recent IMS study, we identified differences on proteomic level between SN and SM.6 Five 
peptides, comprising a specific proteomic signature, were differentially expressed by the 
melanocytic component of SN and SM in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples.
In this study we have analyzed 102 ASNs, for some of which the original pathologist(s) 
favored SM histopathologically, while in others SN was favored. In a third group neither SN 
nor SM was favored histopathologically and the diagnosis remained as ASN. Clinical 
Groups 2, 3 and 4 included patients with “adverse” clinical outcome. All 4 patients with 
advanced locoregional disease, distant metastases, and/or death (in Groups 3 and 4) were 
correctly diagnosed as SM by IMS. The patients in Group 4 were dead of disease and the 
patient in Group 3 was alive with disease but lost to follow-up 1 year after diagnosis. In 
clinical Group 1c, 6/10 cases were diagnosed as SN by IMS. Three of these patients had a 
histopathological diagnosis favoring SM and the other 3 of ASN. The lesions had tumor 
thicknesses between 1.75 and 5.0 mm (mean 3.5 mm). The patients were ANED at a follow-
up ranging between 2.5 and 13 years (mean 7.2). In comparison, patients with melanoma 
with similar thicknesses would have had a predicted lesser survival rate and disease free 
interval. This suggests that there may be some characteristics on molecular level that are 
detected by mass spectrometry but are “invisible” to standard histopathology, thus a better 
predictor of clinical behavior.10
In 13 cases SM was favored on histopathological assessment and a diagnosis of SM was 
rendered by IMS. All of these patients with the exception of 3 patients had either a positive 
SLN, positive nodes in completion lymphadenectomy, recurrence, distant metastases and/or 
death. In 24 cases, in which SM was favored histopathologically, IMS rendered a diagnosis 
of SN, which correlated well with their benign clinical behavior. In additional 38 cases, 
diagnosed histopathologically as ASN, IMS rendered a diagnosis of SN and the clinical 
outcome was also benign. In these 62 cases in total, the histopathological diagnosis was 
either inconclusive or favored SM while IMS classified the lesions as benign SN. All of 
these cases had benign clinical behavior with a mean follow-up of 7.6 years. IMS appeared 
to be more accurate in predicting the benign character of ASNs than histopathology and 
correlated better with their clinical behavior. Histopathology appeared to have a tendency to 
overdiagnose either atypical features or malignancy. In the final group of 26 patients, in 
which SN was favored histopathologically, the same diagnosis was rendered by IMS. All 
patients were ANED with a follow-up between 5 and 16 years.

 We found a strong association between the diagnosis of SM by IMS and an adverse clinical 
outcome when clinical Group 1 was compared to Groups 2, 3 and 4. Of different melanoma 
prognostic factors that we compared, only older age and greater tumor thickness were 
strongly associated with adverse clinical behavior and poorer outcome. IMS diagnosis 
showed stronger association with clinical outcome than did the histopathological diagnosis 
by Fisher's exact test. In addition, the diagnosis of SM by IMS was statistically strongly 
associated with adverse clinical behavior. IMS analysis using a proteomic signature may be 
able to provide reliable diagnosis as well as clinically useful and statistically significant risk 
assessment of ASNs, beyond the information provided by histology and other ancillary 
techniques.

 Capsule summary
•
Spitzoid lesions may be very challenging and represent one of the most 
difficult areas in Dermatopathology
•
There is a strong association between the diagnosis of Spitzoid 
melanoma by Imaging Mass Spectrometry and adverse clinical 
outcome
•
Imaging Mass Spectrometry analysis may be helpful in the diagnosis of 
difficult Atypical Spitzoid Neoplasms

 FIGURE 1. 
Spitzoid melanoma. Patient #12, a 57-year-old man with a lesion from the left ear, which 
was diagnosed histopathologically as SM with 3.0 mm tumor thickness, was also classified 
as SM by IMS. This patient (clinical Group 4) had distant metastases and was dead of 
disease 5 years after the diagnosis.
a) Low magnification microphotograph showing a large asymmetric lesion. b) There is an 
expansile proliferation of melanocytes with pushing borders, involving the reticular dermis 
and extending close to the subcutaneous fat. c) Sheet-like growth pattern of the melanocytes

pleomorphic and with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are easily identified 
(arrow). e) A scanned image of the specimen containing areas marked for Imaging Mass 
Spectrometry analysis. f) Average spectrum of the selected m/z range 965-1075. Two peaks

 FIGURE 2. 
Atypical Spitzoid Neoplasm diagnosed as Spitzoid melanoma by histopathological 
examination and as Spitz nevus by IMS. Patient #106, a 12-year-old boy with a nodule on 
the left lower leg, was rendered a histopathological diagnosis of SM with a tumor thickness 
of 3.7 mm. The lesion was ulcerated and there were 3 mitotic figures per mm2. This lesion 
was classified as SN by IMS. This patient (clinical Group 1c) had 1/1 SLN positive and no 
positive lymph nodes on completion lymphadenectomy. The patient was alive and free of 
disease 6 years after the diagnosis. He died in a car accident at the age of 18. a) Large

 nodular and poorly defined melanocytic lesion. b) There is mostly intradermal melanocytic 
proliferation with only focal junctional component. The epidermis is hyperplastic and shows 
hypergranulosis and hyperkeratosis. c) The proliferation is dense, forming sheets of 
melanocytes. d) The melanocytes are large, pleomorphic, with vesicular nuclei, prominent 
purple nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are noted throughout 
the lesion (arrow). e) A scanned image of the specimen containing areas marked for Imaging 
Mass Spectrometry analysis. f) Average spectrum of the selected m/z range 965-1075. Two

Atypical Spitzoid Neoplasm with a diagnosis of ASN by histopathological examination and 
of Spitz nevus by IMS. Patient #97 is a 48-year-old woman with a lesion from the right volar 
forearm diagnosed histopathologically as ASN with tumor thickness of 2.25 mm and 1 
mitosis per mm2. The lesion was classified as SN by IMS. This patient (clinical Group 1a) 
was alive and free of disease 5.5 years after the diagnosis. a) Broad and asymmetric 
proliferation of melanocytes. b) The epidermis is hyperplastic and shows hypergranulosis 
and hyperkeratosis. The majority of the lesion is intradermal and shows nests and fascicles

 of melanocytes. c) There are irregular nests of melanocytes in the epidermis, which vary in 
size and shape and are not equidistant from one another. Melanocytic nests are also seen 
down adnexal epithelium and in the dermis. d) The melanocytes are large, pleomorphic, 
some with hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm. Two mitotic figures are 
designated by arrows. e) A scanned image of the specimen containing areas marked for 
Imaging Mass Spectrometry analysis. f) Average spectrum of the selected m/z range 
965-1075. Two peaks at m/z 976.5 and m/z 1060.2, which are part of the classifier, are

 FIGURE 4. 
Atypical Spitzoid Neoplasm diagnosed as Spitz nevus by both, histopathological 
examination and IMS. Patient #35 (clinical Group 2), a 58-year-old man, with a lesion from 
the ear diagnosed as favoring SN on histopathological assessment, was also diagnosed as SN 
by IMS. This lesion was completely excised. Fifteen years later there was a recurrence at the 
site of the primary lesion, which was also excised and diagnosed histopathologically as 
favoring a recurrent SN. Subsequent follow-up for another 10 years (25 years total) did not 
show any further recurrences or metastases. a) Large, asymmetric and somewhat multi-

 lobular melanocytic lesion. b) Very dense, sheet – like proliferation of melanocytes in the 
dermis. c) Single large melanocytes are seen at the dermal epidermal junction. In the 
underlying dermis there are large pleomorphic melanocytes with vesicular nuclei and 
abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, focally forming small nests. d) An aCGH analysis shows 
loss of chromosome 3 (red arrow) and partial loss of chromosome 11p (long black arrow) 
and 17p (short black arrow), findings not entirely sufficient to support the diagnosis of 
melanoma. e) A scanned image of the specimen containing areas marked for Imaging Mass 
Spectrometry analysis. f) Average spectrum of the selected m/z range 965-1075. Two peaks 
at m/z 976.5 and m/z 1060.2, which are part of the classifier, are marked by *.
