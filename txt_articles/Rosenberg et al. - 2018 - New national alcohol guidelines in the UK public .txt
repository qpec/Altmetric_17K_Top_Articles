ABSTRACT
Background Alcohol consumption places a significant burden on the NHS and is an important risk factor for cancer, associated with 12 800
UK cases/year. New alcohol guidelines were published in 2016, taking into account the increasing evidence of the health harms of alcohol.
Methods A survey of the UK drinker population (n = 972) was conducted 1 week before and 1 month after the release of the guidelines to
capture drinking habits, guideline awareness and intended behaviour change.
Results Overall, 71% were aware of the new alcohol guidelines, however, just 8% knew what the recommended limits were. Higher
socioeconomic groups were more likely to know these limits (ABC1 = 9% versus C2DE = 4%, P = 0.009). Participants who recognized the
message that alcohol causes cancer were more likely to correctly identify the new guidelines (message recognition = 12% versus no recognition =
6%, P = 0.004); and were more likely to self-report an intention to reduce their alcohol consumption (message recognition = 10% versus no
recognition = 6%, P = 0.01).
Conclusion The majority of the population knew the guidelines had been updated, however, communication of the new limits needs to be
improved. Raising awareness of the links between alcohol and cancer may improve understanding of alcohol guidelines and could prompt
behaviour change for those motivated to reduce their alcohol consumption.
Keywords alcohol consumption, cancer, socioeconomics factors
Introduction
Globally, alcohol accounts for 5.9% of deaths and 5.1% of
disability-adjusted life years, and is linked to over 200 health
conditions, including, heart disease, stroke, diabetes1 and
seven types of cancer.2 Those from lower socioeconomic
groups consume the least amount of alcohol,3 however,
prevalence rates for disease and mortality due to alcohol
harm is highest in these groups,4 often because of clustering
of other health behaviours (smoking, poor diet and excess
weight) and heavy episodic drinking.5 Between 2012 and
2013 in the UK, alcohol was responsible for over 330 000
hospital admissions, as estimated from attributable fractions,
with 21% of these were due to cancer.6 In 2012 it was esti-
mated that alcohol causes 5.5% of cancer cases and 5.8%
cancer deaths in the UK. However, previous research has
shown there to be poor public awareness of alcohol as a risk
factor for cancer.7,8 The latest research in England found
only 13% of the adult population knew alcohol consumption
increases the risk of cancer when asked an unprompted
question.9
Guidelines on low risk drinking exist in at least 37 coun-
tries.10 In the UK prior to 2016, these guidelines were last
revised in 1995 where there was a shift from a weekly to a
daily guideline. The 1995 guidance stated that men should

 not exceed 3–4 units per day; women should not exceed 2–3
units per day and to allow an alcohol-free 48 h period fol-
lowing a heavy drinking session to allow tissue to recover.11
The latest national Alcohol Strategy (2012) emphasized the
need to support people in making healthier choices. A mech-
anism for achieving this included a review of lower risk drink-
ing guidelines by the four UK Chief Medical Officers (CMO)
from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.12 The
rationale behind the new guidelines was that everybody has a
right to accurate information regarding health risks associated
with alcohol consumption and it is the government’s responsi-
bility to provide such information so the public can make
informed choices about their drinking.13
An expert group reviewed all of the evidence since the last
guidelines were updated in 1995. The group considered both
long-term health risks (e.g cases and mortality for diseases
such as heart disease, stroke and cancer) and short-term
health impacts (e.g deaths caused by accidents and injuries).
The new guidelines recommend:13
• Men and women who drink regularly are safest not to
drink more than 14 units per week.
• It is best to spread the 14 units over a period of 3 days or
more.
• The safest approach for women who are pregnant is not
to drink at all.
In addition to the recommendations, several health messages
are included within the guidelines document,13 for example:
• Alcohol guidelines do not represent an absolutely safe
amount to drink; they are intended to keep a person’s
health risks from alcohol to a minimum.
• The risk associated with regularly drinking 14 units per
week is similar to the harms of other routine activities,
such as driving a car.
• If you wish to cut down the amount you’re drinking, a good
way to achieve this is to have several drink-free days a week.
• Drinking alcohol regularly is linked to long-term risks
such as cancer.
The publication of the new CMO alcohol guidelines on 6
January 2016 attracted media coverage in the UK and else-
where. The message that drinking any amount of alcohol
increases the risk of cancer generated widespread discussion.
There has been no national campaign to promote the new
guidelines, however, a consultation was held to discuss how
the messaging of the guidelines should best be communicated.
Internationally, previous research has shown that knowl-
edge of low risk drinking guidelines and the health harms of
alcohol is low.14–16 The limited evidence on the impact of the
promotion of alcohol guidelines in different countries sug-
gests that while they may raise awareness and knowledge of
the recommended drinking limits, communicating guidelines
does not in and of itself reduce alcohol consumption.17–20
The aim of this study was to investigate awareness of the
revised UK lower risk drinking guidelines amongst adults in
the UK who consume alcohol; the accompanying health
messaging; and how these are associated with intentions
regarding future drinking behaviour.
Methods
Data came from two surveys for which data were collected
2 weeks before and 1 month after the revised guidelines.
Although the same individuals were surveyed at both time
points, different questions were used in the two surveys so
longitudinal analyses was not possible. Instead, the data were
analysed cross-sectionally and only those responding to both
surveys were included in the analysis.
Sampling
Data collection was carried out via a self-administered online
survey in two waves by YouGov, a market research company.
The sample population was recruited by YouGov from their
online panel, a base sample from across the UK. Automated
sampling with regional quotas for England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland was applied to ensure a generally representa-
tive sample of the UK population. Participants were invited by
email to fill in the questionnaire online. The population of inter-
est for this study was adults in the UK who drank alcohol as
this was the target group for the alcohol guidelines. As such,
participants were screened using the question ‘Do you ever
drink alcohol nowadays, including drinks you brew or make at
home?’ to exclude non-drinkers. In total, 1197 participants were
sampled at baseline and of these, the 972 respondents who par-
ticipated at follow up (retention rate = 81%) form the analytical
sample here. There were no differences in retention rates by
age, gender, social grade or geographic location.
Measures
The survey tool was based on previous research.9 Additional
items were incorporated from other survey tools and
adapted where necessary to be relevant to the new alcohol
guidelines. Where no existing tools could be found, new
questions were developed and tested using a patient panel
group for clarity, content and style of questions.
In the baseline survey demographic information (gender,
age, education, geographical location and household income)

 and typical alcohol use were collected. Where complete data
were available, the National Readership Survey (NRS) sys-
tem was used to group the respondents into two social
grades: ABC1 (higher, intermediate, supervisory, clerical and
junior managerial, administrative and professional occupa-
tions) and C2DE (skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled manual
occupations, unemployed and lowest grade occupations).
Typical alcohol use was tested using the 3-item short-form of
the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C).21
Where complete data were available, two drinker categories
were created: lower risk (AUDIT-C score = 1–4); and
increasing risk (AUDIT-C score = 5+).
In the second wave, the same respondents were asked about
awareness of the new alcohol guidelines, their views regarding
health messaging (i.e. links between alcohol and cancer) sur-
rounding the guidelines and any intended behaviour change.
Wording of the health messages were taken directly from the
publicity from the CMO surrounding the release of the
guidelines. See Supplementary information for full survey details.
Participants were asked if they were aware of the new guidelines
with a Yes/No question. Knowledge of the guidelines was
assessed by first asking whether the guidelines had a weekly or a
daily limit, followed by the specific limit, in units, recommended
for women and then for men. Governmental responsibility was
recorded using a 5-point Likert scale from strong agreement to
strong disagreement. Message recognition was assessed using the
question ‘Do you recall hearing any of the following messages…’.
Health message agreement was recorded using a 5-point Likert
scale from strong agreement to strong disagreement. These
questions were asked to all respondents, with wording of the
questions altered where required for those who were and were
not aware of the new drinking guidelines (see Supplementary
information for more detail).
To investigate intended behaviour change due to the new
guidelines, the following question were asked to those who were
aware of the new guidelines. Intended guideline use was recorded
using a 5-point Likert scale of from always to never. Intention to
change drinking habits was recorded using the question ‘Which
of the following best describes you?: I am planning to cut down
my drinking following the release of the new alcohol guidelines; I
think I should cut down my drinking following the release of the
new alcohol guidelines but I probably won’t; I am not planning
to cut down my drinking following the release of the new alcohol
guidelines.’ A don’t know option was included in these questions,
and those answering don’t know were excluded from the analysis.
Data analysis
Data were analysed using Stata
® Statistical Software: Release
13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Sample weights
were applied to gender, region and age to adjust for the under
sampling of males and older people relative to the UK alco-
hol drinking population. Results are displayed using weighted
data are presented, unless specified. Univariate binary logistic
regression was used to explore factors associated with guide-
line awareness and guideline knowledge. Univariate ordinal
logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with
governmental responsibility and intended behaviour change.
Significant factors were then were then entered into a multi-
variable logistic regression, with step-wise elimination of non-
significant variables to determine independent predictors. The
association of guideline awareness and message recognition
was analysed using chi squared tests.
Results
Sample characteristics can be seen in Table 1. There was
complete information from 918/972 participants to charac-
terize their drinking risk levels using the AUDIT-C tool.
Within this sub-sample, just under half (46%) were classified
as ‘increasing risk’ drinkers, with the rest as ‘low risk’.
Nearly three quarters (71%) of the sample were aware that
there were new alcohol guidelines one month after they had
been released. However, knowledge of the recommended drink-
ing limits in the new guidelines (14 units per week for men and
women) across the UK drinking population was very low (8%).
Knowledge of the general themes of the new guidelines were
also low. Even for those who were aware that there were new
guidelines, only 30% knew that the guidelines had a weekly and
not a daily limit; 35% knew that the guidelines had the same
limit for men and women; whilst 41% knew the limit for men
was now below 21 units per week (data not shown).
Nearly two-thirds (63%) of people surveyed strongly agreed
or agreed that the government has a responsibility to release
this guidance on how drinkers can minimize health risks. The
most recognized health messages that surrounded the release
of the new guidelines were that there is no safe limit for drink-
ing (42%) and that alcohol is linked to cancer (24%). Only 7%
of respondents were intending to reduce their alcohol con-
sumption following the release of the new alcohol guidelines,
whilst one-third (33%) planned to always, often or sometimes
use the new guidelines to keep track of their own drinking.
Predictors of guideline awareness, knowledge and
attitudes
Greater awareness of the new guidelines was independently
associated with being male, older and from a higher socio-
economic background (Table 2). The most common place
that people encountered the new guidelines during the

 month of January were on TV or the radio (73%) followed
by in print media (29%) and then online (15%). Only 4%
had come across the new guidelines in a healthcare setting
(data not shown). Correct knowledge of the guidelines was
approximately double in men versus women, ABC1 versus
C2DE and increasing risk versus low risk drinkers (Table 2).
Multivariate analysis revealed that socioeconomic back-
ground and recognition of the message that alcohol is linked
to cancer were independent predictors of correct guideline
knowledge.
Agreement that the government should be releasing
guidelines on alcohol consumption was independently asso-
ciated with being female, older, from a higher socioeconomic
background, and a lower risk drinker (Table 2). Recognition
of the alcohol and cancer message was also associated with
a greater level of agreement in the release of government
guidance.
Predictors of intended behaviour change
Following the release of the alcohol guidelines, only 7% self-
reported
an
intention
to
cut
down
their
drinking.
Multivariate analysis identified the following independent
predictors of intended behaviour change (Table 3): higher
risk drinkers were three times more likely; people who
recognized the alcohol and cancer message were twice as

 likely; and those aged 46–55 are three times more likely than
those aged 18–25 to report an intention to cut down.
Around one-third reported that they planned to use the
guidelines to keep track of their drinking, even though only
8% actually knew what the new guidelines were. Of those
who could correctly identify the content of the guidelines
were 1.7 times more likely to intend to use the guidelines to
monitor consumption than those who could not (Table 3).
However, higher risk drinkers were 1.6 times less likely to
plan on using the guidelines than low risk drinkers. The other
factor independently associated with using the guidelines to
keep track of alcohol consumption was being female.
Health messaging surrounding the new alcohol
guidelines
Recognition of alcohol health messaging in the media was
explored for the whole study population, regardless of
whether
the
participant
was
aware
that
new
alcohol
guidelines had been released. Those who were aware of the
new guidelines were approximately three times as likely to
recognize these health messages as compared to those who
were unaware (Fig. 1). This was seen for the three messages
that there is no safe level of drinking; alcohol causes cancer;
and alcohol does not protect against heart disease.
Overall, there was a high level of agreement with the con-
tent of the health messages surrounding the guidelines
(Supplementary information). Almost 9 in 10 people (87%)
agreed that it was safest not to drink at all during or when
planning a pregnancy, with just over 70% agreeing that hav-
ing drink-free days is a good way to cut down on drinking
and that there is no safe level of drinking. The link between
regular drinking and long-term cancer risk was agreed with
by 61% of people. The one message that did not show
agreement was with the explanation that the risks of exceed-
ing the limits in the guidelines was similar to that of driving
a car, even though this form a key justification for the
guidelines that was used during their publication.
Discussion
Main findings of this study
There was a high level of awareness of the UK’s new low risk
drinking guidelines one month after their publication. This
almost certainly reflects the media coverage of the guidelines in
broadcast, print and online outlets at the time. This coverage was

AWARENESS OF NEW NATIONAL ALCOHOL GUIDELINES IN THE UK

 prompted by a government press release and comments from
health charities and other relevant stakeholders. Higher aware-
ness amongst men may reflect the fact that recommended levels
of consumption were significantly reduced for males but not
females. However, awareness was lower in amongst less affluent
groups. As alcohol harms are more frequently experienced by
these groups this suggests that targeted communication is
needed in order to address inequalities that may arise from this
type of health information. Greater alcohol harms amongst these
groups can be experienced due to co-morbidities or clustering of
more harmful health behaviours such as smoking, poor diet and
excess weight.5 This may merit a more comprehensive approach
to risk communication, including in healthcare settings such as
primary care, to raise awareness of both alcohol and other
behavioural risk factors for cancer and other chronic diseases.
A quarter of the study population recognized the message
that alcohol causes cancer. People who recognized the alcohol
and cancer link were on average twice as likely to correctly
identify the new recommended drinking limits in the guid-
ance. This is consistent with previous research in both
Australia8 and the UK22 that found that individuals who cor-
rectly identified alcohol as a risk factor for cancer were more
supportive of measures to reduce alcohol consumption or the
harms from alcohol in the population, including the provision
of accurate information about alcohol and health.
In addition, respondents who recognized the link between
alcohol and cancer were more likely than most other groups
to report that they might reduce their drinking following the
release of the guidelines. Behavioural intentions are weak
measures of actual behaviour change, however, and further

 research23 is now underway to identify whether communica-
tion of the new guidelines has resulted in a shift in patterns
of alcohol consumption in the UK.
What is already known on this topic
UK low risk drinking guidelines were updated in January 2016
to reflect new evidence in alcohol health harms, including the
association between alcohol and cancer.13 The limited evidence
available from other countries suggest that while promotion of
alcohol guidelines might raise awareness of the recommended
drinking limits, it does not reduce alcohol consumption.17–20,24
What our study adds
To date this is the first study investigating the impact of the UK’s
new guidelines on alcohol health knowledge and intended drink-
ing behaviours. Our survey also found that the general public
believed that government had a role in communicating health
messages to the population and that the guidelines provided an
appropriate platform for health messaging. In particular, the
prominence of the evidence linking alcohol consumption to can-
cer risk in the communication of the guidelines is important. This
suggests that this type of health messaging, which links recom-
mendations to disease specific evidence, may improve the salience
and understanding of government advice on health behaviours.
Limitations of this study
Limitations of the study include the short time frame involved
which only captured immediate (within one month) responses to
the new guidelines. It is likely that recall will diminish over time
without sustained communication of guideline content. In add-
ition, the cross-sectional nature of the data collected means that
the relationships observed between the characteristics of respon-
dents and their awareness and understanding of the guidelines
(and intentions around behaviour change) may be explained by
other factors not covered by the survey. A priority for future
research should be the impact of revised low risk drinking
guidelines on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm in
the population, alongside assessing whether awareness of the
content of the guidelines is sustained in the UK population
through time.
