Abstract: The ketogenic diet, originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy in non-responder
children, is spreading to be used in the treatment of many diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease.
The main activity of the ketogenic diet has been related to improved mitochondrial function and
decreased oxidative stress. B-Hydroxybutyrate, the most studied ketone body, has been shown
to reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), improving mitochondrial respiration:
it stimulates the cellular endogenous antioxidant system with the activation of nuclear factor
erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), it modulates the ratio between the oxidized and reduced
forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) and it increases the efficiency of
electron transport chain through the expression of uncoupling proteins. Furthermore, the ketogenic
diet performs anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing
family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome as well as inhibiting histone deacetylases
(HDACs), improving memory encoding. The underlying mechanisms and the perspectives for the
treatment of Alzheimer’s disease are discussed.
Keywords: Ketogenic diet; Alzheimer’s disease; neuroprotection; inflammation; oxidative stress
1. Introduction
According to the World Alzheimer Report 2016, there are 47 million people worldwide suffering
from dementia, and this number will rise to 131 million by 2050 due to population aging. This data
also implies a great economic impact, which is expected to be one billion dollars worldwide by 2018.
Despite of recent progress in understanding the neurobiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), no resolutive pharmacological treatments but only a few symptomatic drugs are currently
available to patients. Based on this consideration, much effort is aimed at the development of effective
prevention lines: so far many non-pharmacological treatments have been proposed, including lifestyle
interventions such as targeted nutritional protocols, caloric restriction and exercise, as well as mental
challenges and socialization [1].
Moreover, although the effects of diet in aging and neurodegeneration is becoming well-
established, the evidence regarding the effect of diet on cognition in neurological disorders has
not been proved yet. This is surprising because preservation of cognition is often a predominant
concern for patients with neurological disorders, perhaps due to the substantial impact on occupation,
social relationships, activities of daily living, and quality of life [2].

Alzheimer’s disease etiopathogenesis has been linked to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation,
mitochondrial impairment, hypometabolism and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption [3–6].
The proved effectiveness of the ketogenic diet in childhood refractory epilepsy and the early
metabolic dysfunction observed in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which usually precedes the onset
of AD, paved the way to evaluate the possible therapeutic role of dietary metabolic approaches to AD
and other neurodegenerative diseases. The brain hypometabolism was associated to a reduced glucose
utilization, detected by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), but several
alteration in amino acids and lipids metabolic pathways have been recently identified through modern
metabolomics techniques [7–11].
Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are considered two key factors in the development
of Alzheimer’s disease, underlying neurotoxic mechanisms leading to neuronal death occurring in
the brain areas responsible for memory and cognitive processes [12]. A bulk of studies have shown
that the blood-brain barrier is impaired in Alzheimer’s disease resulting in an altered expression of
some transporters, including the down-regulation of glucose transporter. The primary fuel for the
brain is glucose that must be taken from the blood and transported across the BBB by the specific
glucose transporters (GLUTs) due to the inability of neurons to synthesize or store it. When there is
a decreased expression of these transporters, as it has been shown in AD, Ketone Bodies (KBs) become
the alternative energy source to glucose for the brain due to their ability to cross the BBB carried by
specific transporters that are not down-regulated during AD. For all these reasons many studies have
been performed to verify if the induction of a mild ketosis may favor the trophism of neuronal cells in
the course of AD.
In the last few years the number of publications about the ketogenic diet (KD) and neurological
disease have been progressively increasing.
The beneficial effects of these diets for enhancing
cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function, inducing a shift in energy metabolism, have been
described in more detail, although the specific effects on cognition have not been analyzed in such
depth [13,14]. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence regarding KD and AD
with specific reference to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, as well as their effects on
cognitive processes.
2. Ketone Bodies as Alternative Fuel for the Brain
The adult brain represents about 2% of body weight, but it consumes about 20–23% of whole-body
energy expenditure, mostly in the form of glucose. Indeed, during episodic period of starvation
or low-carbohydrates intake, the KBs metabolism becomes the main source of alternative energy
as a results of carbohydrate deficiency and increased availability of fatty acids from lipolysis [15].
β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) can replace glucose in the brain, whereas acetone,
produced by spontaneous decarboxylation of AcAc, is rapidly eliminated through urine and lungs.
Under human physiological condition plasma KBs concentration fluctuate between 100 and 250 mM,
increased to ~1 mM after prolonged exercise or 24 h of fasting and to 6–8 mM during a prolonged fast
without giving rise to clinically hazardous acidosis. In diabetic ketoacidosis, plasma concentration of
KBs can exceed 20 mM [16,17]. The human liver produces up to 300 g of ketone bodies per day which
contribute between 5% and 20% of total energy expenditure in fed, fasted, and starved states [15].
3. Ketogenic Diets
The classic KD was designed in 1923 for the treatment of epilepsy by Dr. Russell Wilder at the
Mayo Clinic. Ketogenic diets are composed of high amount of fat and low carbohydrates, typically at
a macronutrient ratio of fat to protein plus carbs equal to 3–4:1 (4 grams of fat to 1 gram of protein and
carbohydrate combined) which approximately results in 90% of total calories intake from fat, 6% from
protein, and 4% from carb (because fat has 9 calories per gram, while both protein and carb have just
4 calories per gram). The moderate protein intake avoids amino acids induced gluconeogenesis and
promotes KBs formation. The resulting metabolic profile is characterized by a slight reduction of blood
 Antioxidants 2018, 7, 63

glucose concentration with increasing KBs and mimics the fasting state with the brain beginning to
use KBs to generate cellular energy. The very low carbohydrate intake of classic KD is difficult to
maintain and consequently at least five main variants of the KD were published in medical literature
as treatments for diseases that have an underlying metabolic dysregulation, such as epilepsy, cancer,
and Alzheimer’s disease. All KDs are a variation of the classic KD, the main difference being the
macronutrient ratio: the Modified Ketogenic Diet (2:1–1:1), the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD; 1:1), and
more recently the Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) oil diet (1.9:1), Low Glycemic Index Treatment
(LGIT) and Intermittent Fasting [2,6]. Usually, fat type and chain length are not specified, but typically
a ketogenic diet includes mostly saturated fats, which have 16–20 carbon atoms. In the last few
years the alternative medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet was developed, comprising
about 60% octanoic acid (an eight-carbon fatty acid) and about 40% decanoic acid (a ten-carbon fatty
acid). The quick metabolism of the shorter fatty acids results in more efficient generation of ketone
bodies allowing to assume a greater proportion of carbohydrates with only about 45% of lipid energy
intake [2,6].
A key issue is the potential occurrence of adverse effects in course of KD treatment. The incidence
of adverse effects is primarily associated with the KD model applied, with the classic KD (4:1 ratio)
burdened by a lower tolerance when compared with the 3:1 ratio KD or MAD, and it is significantly
reduced by the current availability of specific dietary supplements or formulas. The most common
adverse events are the gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, constipation and diarrhea;
moreover, weight loss and hyperlipidemia are potential side effects whereas the major adverse events
(dehydration, electrolyte alteration, arrythmias) are uncommon. During the first few days and weeks
after KD initiation, mild side effects such as headaches, fatigue, can occur. The pathological ketoacidosis
due to a lack of insulin in type 1 diabetes is not possible as result of dietary changes alone. The frequency
evaluation of KD side effects in patients with AD is difficult due to the small number of available
clinical trials and the heterogeneity of KD model applied [18–21].
Although several clinical trials were carried out on childhood refractory epilepsy, adverse events
have not been consistently reported [22]. As well as children, elderly people subjected to long-term
KD treatment require a close monitoring for adverse events by a neurologist, nutritionist and dietitian,
and they should be subjected to a periodic dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) screening for
body composition health (bone, fat free mass, muscle mass and fat mass).
4. Mechanisms Underlying the Beneficial Effects of Ketogenic Diet on Neurological
Despite the poor number of clinical trials experimenting on the effectiveness of different types
of ketogenic diets on Alzheimer’s cognitive impairment (summarized in Table 1), a growing body of
biological mechanisms potentially able to explain the observed clinical effects have been proven in
in vitro or in animal model studies.
The therapy of AD was primarily addressed to the prevention of the specific histological injures
(amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles) but the lack of success moved the focus of research to
functional dysregulation of brain metabolism, mitochondrial homeostasis and excitatory and inhibitory
neuronal signaling, laying the foundation for the development of a “metabolic therapy”.
Before describing more extensively the activity of ketogenic diet associated to the decrease of the
oxidative damage and to the modulation of inflammatory status, the main mechanisms reported in the
scientific literature are briefly summarized.
The putative neuroprotective effects of ketone bodies have been associated with the following
mechanisms:
•
increasing intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) availability;
•
reducing ROS generation by mitochondrial complex I;
•
inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition;
•
stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting in stabilized synaptic function;
•
altering metabolism of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid
(GABA);
•
activating energy-sensing signaling pathways such as the peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor (PPAR), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and adenosine monophosphate-
(AMP)-activated kinase (AMPK) pathways.

ketone levels were positively correlated
with memory performance (p = 0.04); the
primary finding indicated improved
secondary memory performances for the
low carbohydrate subjects; there was no
effect of the intervention on the Trail
Making Test part B and Geriatric
Depression Scale; there were significant
changes in anthropometric and
metabolic values and in dietary
parameters; after the intervention,
weight, waist circumference, fasting
glucose and insulin value were lower for
the low carbohydrate but not high
carbohydrate group.
these preliminary data provide
evidence that dietary ketosis by
means of carbohydrate restriction
can provide neurocognitive benefit
for older adults with early memory
decline and increased risk for
neurodegeneration.
Correction of hyperinsulinemia
and other mechanisms associated
with ketosis such as reduced
inflammation and enhanced energy
metabolism also may have
contributed to improved
neurocognitive function; a
prominent issue will be duration of
the effects and whether there is
persistence of benefit beyond the
period of active intervention.

months using an indurating, four-step
dose-titration method (from 10 to 40 g
per day) for 7 days before the trial, and
examined the tolerance and adverse
effects of this intervention; blood tests
included: haemogram, alanine
aminotransferase and aspartate
aminotransferase, creatinine and urea
nitrogen, glucose, glycohaemoglobin
A1C, low-density lipoprotein and
high-density lipoprotein, triacylglycerol,
albumin, and total protein, and sodium,
chloride, and potassium; serum total
ketone bodies (acetoacetic acid and
β-hydroxybutyric acid); the effect on
cognitive function was assessed using
the MMSE and Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment Scale (ADAS) cognitive
subscale, Japanese version (ADAS-Jcog);
ApoE genotypes were determined.
the tolerance of Axona was good,
without severe gastrointestinal adverse
effects; Axona did not improve cognitive
function in our sample of AD patients,
even in those patients without the
ApoE4 allele; however, some
ApoE4-negative patients with baseline
MMSE score ≥14 showed improvement
in their cognitive functions.
the modified dose-titration method,
starting with a low dose of Axona,
decreased gastrointestinal adverse
effects in Japanese patients. Axona
might be effective for some
relatively mildly affected patients
with AD (with cognitive function

The primary objective of Ketogenic
Diet Retention and Feasibility Trial
(KDRAFT) was to address the
feasibility of implementing a very
high-fat ketogenic diet (VHF-KD)
intervention in AD participants;
secondary objectives included
evaluating the effects of a VHF-KD
on cognition.
15 participants with AD.
Individuals were eligible to the
study if they had a clinical
dementia rating (CDR) of very
mild AD (CDR 0.5), mild AD
(CDR 1), or moderate AD (CDR
2).
single-arm, pilot clinical study enrolled
15 participants with AD and required
participants to maintain an
MCT-supplemented KD for 3 months
and then to resume a normal diet for 1
month (washout period).
KD included 70% of energy as fat
(including the MCT), 20% as protein, and
carbohydrate less than 10% of energy;
ketogenic ratio (lipid grams to non lipid
grams) of 1:1 or better. MCT oil
supplement (Now Foods, USA)
contained a combination of C8:0 and
C10:0 fatty acids; participants
self-monitored urine ketones daily;
serum electrolytes, renal function tests,
liver function tests, and glucose levels
were measured at the baseline and
month 3 visits. Serum
β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and insulin
levels were measured at baseline, month
1, month 2, month 3, and washout,

were calculated; Dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry was used to assess body
composition; MMSE, to identify
cognitive impairment, and ADAS-cog, to
measure changes in memory, language,
praxis, and attention, were administered
at baseline, at the end of the intervention
(month 3), and after the 1-month
washout.
7 CDR0.5, 4 CDR1, and 4 CDR2
participants were enrolled; 10 completers
achieved ketosis; among the completers,
the mean of the Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale
score improved by 4.1 points during the
diet (P 5.02) and reverted to baseline
after the washout. Only one participant’s
ADAS-cog score declined while
following the diet protocol.
Serum βHB levels were significantly
elevated at months 1, 2, and 3 compared
with that of baseline and returned to the
normal range at the end of thewashout
period (0.12 mmol/L).
Because of small sample size and
single-arm design, any
interpretationp of this study’s
cognitive performance data
requires caution; the pilot trial
justifies KD studies in mild
Alzheimer’s disease.

The advances in understanding of the mechanisms of action of medium-chain fatty acids
(e.g., decanoic acid and octanoic acid) have more recently shifted attention away from ketone bodies
to the direct role of fatty acids as a therapeutic effectors, paving the way for novel dietary and drug
therapies for epilepsy and other disorders, as comprehensively described in Augustin’s recent review.
According to this review medium-chain fatty acids are able to cross the blood–brain barrier reaching in
the brain a concentrations more than 50% greater than the plasma one, providing an alternative energy
source for brain neurons and astrocytes. Octanoic acid seems to undergo β-oxidation in astrocytes
more easily than decanoic acid and readily produces ketone bodies; decanoic acid instead stimulates
glycolysis producing lactate available as fuel for the brain cells [6].
5. The Antioxidant Activity of the Ketogenic Diet: An Insight into Molecular Mechanism
Mitochondria are the main source of energy in the cell, implicated in ATP production through
oxidative phosphorylation. They play a key role in apoptosis and production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) as a result of escape of electrons during the transfer along the electron transport chain (ETC).
Accumulation of ROS, primarily derived from mitochondrial complexes I and III [30,31], damages
proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Oxidative stress causes mitochondrial dysfunction which enhances
ROS production in a pathological positive feedback loop.
KBs metabolism reduces oxidative stress compared to glycolysis, hypothesizing a further
neuroprotective mechanism carried out by these compounds [32].
β-Hydroxybutyrate (β-HOB), the most studied KB, has been shown to reduce the production of
ROS improving mitochondrial respiration and bypassing the complex I dysfunction [33,34].
(a)
The ketogenic diet (KD) stimulates the cellular endogenous antioxidant system with the activation
of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the major inducer of
detoxification genes.
Nrf2 is a member of the cap “n” collar (Cnc) family of transcription factors, a 605 amino acid
protein, with six functional domains termed Nrf2-erythroid-derived cap’n’collar homolog (ECH)
homologues (Neh). Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered and inhibited in the cytoplasm
by kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) interacting with Neh2 domains of Nrf2 [35,36]. Keap 1 is
a substrate adaptor for different ubiquitin ligase systems, Cullin 3 (Cul3) RING-box 1 (RBX1) E3
ubiquitin ligase complex being the most studied [37]. They constantly ubiquitinate Nrf2 which is then
degraded by the proteasome [38,39].
Nrf2-Keap 1 can be considered a sensor of cellular redox status since Keap 1 is a cysteine-rich
protein. When distinct cysteine residues (Cys273 and Cys288) are oxidized, a conformational change
takes place in Keap1 and so Nrf2 is able to translocate to the nucleus [40,41]. The translocation of Nrf2
is also possible if protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) phosphorylates Ser40 on Nrf2 and if Cys151 on Keap1 gets
oxidized [42].
Once into the nucleus Nrf2 constitutes a heterodimer with small Mafs [43] and binds to the
antioxidant responsive element (ARE) [44,45]. ARE is an enhancer element in the promoter region of
cytoprotective genes such as proteins with thiol (-SH) group like glutathione (GSH), thioredoxin (TXN)
and piroxiredoxin (PRDN) or detoxification enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase,
hem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutamate cysteine ligase (CGL) ([46–48].
Nrf2 is able to induce
glutathione reductase, thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin, fundamental enzymes implicated in the
regeneration of active form of endogenous antioxidants [49].
Moreover, β-HB is an endogenous inhibitor of class I and class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs).
The inhibition of HDACs (1–5,7,8,9) upregulates the transcription of detoxifying genes including
catalase, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (mn-SOD) and metallothionein 2 in order to counteract
oxidative stress [50,51].
Hippocampus of rats fed a KD for up 3 week showed Nrf2 activation and nuclear
translocation [52,53]. CGL subunits (GCLC and CGLM) have antioxidant-response elements (ARE)-like
 Antioxidants 2018, 7, 63
8 of 16
sequences: in this work CGL biosynthesis increases as well as glutathione but there is a decrease in the
mitochondrial level of ROS. How KD activates the Nrf2-ARE pathway is not completely understood,
Milder et al. [53] have showed that in hippocampal mitochondria of KD-fed rats there is an acute
increase of H2O2 level after only 1 day. The first boost of H2O2 production is in contrast with the
reduction of its level after 3 week of diet. Probably H2O2 acts as a redox signal which initiates signaling
cascade. Interestingly H2O2 enhances DNA binding of Nrf2 to the ARE [54]. Nrf2 activation is assisted
by lipid peroxidation: for example arachidonic and linolenic acid during mitochondrial dysfunction
may react with reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and ROS to produce 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE),
an α, β-unsaturated aldehyde. Acute increase of H2O2 and 4-HNE during the first days of diet activates
the release of Nrf2 from Keap 1 to produce an adaptive antioxidant response [52,55].
(b)
A further mechanism explaining the protective activity of the ketogenic diets against oxidative
stress is the intracellular modulation of the NAD+/NADH ratio. An increased NAD+/NADH
ratio protects against ROS and plays an important role in cellular respiration, mitochondrial
biogenesis and redox reactions [56]. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) presents two
forms: the oxidized form (NAD+) and the reduced form (NADH). During the glycolytic pathway
glucose reduces 4 molecules of NAD+, while, on the contrary, the complete mitochondrial
oxidation of β-HOB and acetoacetate (AcAc) reduces respectively 1 and none molecule of
NAD+ [57]. In hippocampus and cerebral cortex of KD-fed rats a significant increase in the
NAD+/NADH ratio was detected not only after 3 weeks but also after 2 days [58]. The fully
oxidation of KBs and its product ATP inhibits glycolytic pathway which leads to a further
accumulation of NAD+. A high NAD+/NADH ratio may influence gene expression through
Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a type 3 histone deacetylase [59]. SIRT1 is a 747 amino acid NAD+ dependent
enzyme with a globular highly conserved catalytic domain [60], it also possess a nuclear export
signals and may translocate between the nucleus and the cytoplasm [61]. Tumor suppressor
hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) together with C term binding protein (CtBP) can suppress
SIRT1 gene expression. This suppressor complex dissociates when the glycolytic pathway is
inhibited and NAD+/NADH ratio heightens (interestingly similar condition occurs during KD).
When it happens, SIRT1 protein levels increase [62]. Even DNA damage, forkhead transcription
factor (FOXO3A) [63], starvation with the cAMP response-element-binding protein (CREB)
activation [64] might enhance the transcription of SIRT1. SIRT1 is implicated in many biological
processes deacetylating histone and non-histone targets [65] and many of them seem to be
associated with antioxidant properties of KD. Additionally, SIRT1 might exercise other functions
to limit oxidative stress, such as improving synthesis of heat shock proteins, increasing antioxidant
defenses, promoting DNA repairing activity of p53 and FOXO factors [66,67] and deacetylating
Nrf2 [68].
(c)
Ketone metabolism increases the efficiency of electron transport chain (ETC) through the
expression of uncoupling proteins (UCP) [69]. UCP reduces the mitochondrial membrane
potential and diminishes the production of ROS and reactive oxygen nitrogen species
(RONS) [70,71]. UCP4 and UCP5 are increased in brains of ketone ester-supplemented rats [72].
The KD inductive effect on UCP2, 4 and 5 expression could be a consequence of SIRT1
activation [73].
(d)
SIRT1 activation, mediated by KD, could offset mitochondrial dysfunction enhancing
mitochondrial biogenesis [74]. In the cell there is a constant balance between the mitophagy of
damaged mitochondria and the biogenesis to renew mitochondria population [75]. The major
regulator of the biogenesis process is the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Gamma
Coactivator-1α (PCG-1α) whose transcription is triggered by Nrf2 [76,77]. SIRT1 plays a key
role in deacetylase PCG-1α [78] which co-activates the transcription of Nuclear Respiratory
Factor (NRF). NRF 1 and NRF 2 lead to the transcription of mitochondrial transcription
factor A (TFAM), subsequently TFAM drives the replication of mitochondrial DNA and the
mitochondrial biogenesis [79].

(e)
At last, ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) can also open the mitochondrial permeability
transition pore (mPTP). mPTP releases cytochrome c (Cytc) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF)
which activate caspases 3 and 9 that finally initiate the apoptotic pathway [80–82]. Mitochondrial
ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoKATP channels) in the inner mitochondrial membrane
are implicated in modulation of ETC and calcium buffering through enhancing K+ efflux [83].
During oxidative stress KBs can activate mitoKATP channels, improving the efficiency of ETC [84]
and inhibiting mPT [85–87].
6. The Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Ketogenic Diet: An Insight into Molecular Mechanism
Several neurodegenerative diseases are interconnected by shared neurotoxic mechanisms related
to inflammatory mechanisms such as cytokine release, neurotrophin synthesis inhibition, release of
NO and CO, which are potentially harmful to surrounding tissues, and so on. Against this the cells
provide endogenous mechanisms tending to neutralize the molecules responsible for inflammatory
damage [12].
A winning strategy to attempt to block neuroinflammation may consist in the enhancement of
endogenous anti-inflammatory programs. One of the most promising approaches seems to be the
ketogenic diet that was set up in the first decade of the last century to treat refractory epilepsy and
then applied with success to treat other neurological diseases [88].
A great interest has been focusing on the use of KD in the treatment of AD for two main reasons:
(i) KD was shown to decrease the production of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and therefore
the βamyloid peptide; and (ii) KD was related to the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma (PPARγ) and then to the decrease of systemic inflammation [89,90].
βHB, one of the main KB detected in the blood after the supply of a ketogenic diet, is able to cross
the BBB thanks to the specific expression of its transporter MCT1 on endothelial cells. But after its
entrance into the brain, β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) not only provides energy but activates the receptor
hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), lowering neuroinflammation [91].
HCA2, a G-protein coupled receptor, is expressed on macrophages, dendritic cells and
microglia [92].
βHB which is the main endogenous ligand of HCA2, activates human HCA2
with an half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of about 700 mM, a concentration attained
only after feeding a ketogenic diet [91]. HCA2 may elicit anti-inflammatory effects through the
inhibition of NF-kB activation [93]. HCA2 activation induces a neuroprotective macrophage phenotype
related to Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) production by Cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1), that helps to resolve
inflammation [94] and has neuroprotective effects [95]. A metabolite of PGD2 inhibits the main
activator of NF-kB which is IKB kinase (IKK). As a consequence HCA2 activation inhibits NF-kB in
macrophages [93]. The activation of HCA2 by ketogenic diet was shown to induce a neuroprotective
phenotype in bone-marrow derived macrophages that infiltrate the brain [92].
HDACs are a group of proteins that are able to regulate gene expression by deacetylating lysine
residues on histone proteins. It is known that hyperacetylation of histones is associated with the
activation of gene expression and therefore HDACs with their action on histone proteins may suppress
gene expression. Some studies in animal models have highlighted the role of HDACs inhibitors in
enhancing mnesic processes suggesting their potential use in the treatment of cognitive diseases.
HDAC plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD by altering chromatin structure
and accessibility [96]. βHB inhibits HDACs 1, 3 and 4 (class I and IIa) in vitro [97]. Reducing
HDAC2 in a mouse model for amyloid deposition via RNA interference was able to improve memory
function and synaptic plasticity [98]. HDAC3 negatively regulates spatial memory in APP/Presenilin
1 (PS1) mice and HDAC3 inhibition might represent a potential therapy for the treatment of AD [99].
Reducing HDAC6 levels is mechanistically linked to tubulin-acetylation and improved mitochondria
transport [100].
βHB mediated the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated
human monocytes leading to a reduced production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-18
 Antioxidants 2018, 7, 63
10 of 16
(IL-18) without significantly affecting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels [101].
βHB dose-dependently inhibited IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion blocking NLRP3 inflammasome
activation by limiting K+ efflux from cells [101]. Several experiments have ruled out a hypothetic role
for mitochondrial ROS in the effects of ketone bodies on the inflammasome.
Since 2008 it has become clear that a low carbohydrate diet causes an increase of KB serum levels,
paralleled by a reduction in several inflammatory parameters [102], and that KD allows neuroprotection
for brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases [103].
A randomized controlled dietary intervention trial was done on 40 overweight subjects aged
18–55 years, fed with a diet very low in carbohydrate or an isocaloric diet low in fat for 12 weeks.
Subjects fed with KD developed a mild ketosis and showed weight loss, decreased adiposity, and
an improved glycemic control as well as an improved insulin sensitivity. Both diets significantly
decreased the concentration of several serum inflammatory markers, but there was an overall
greater anti-inflammatory effect associated with KD: a larger reduction was observed in TNF-alpha,
interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1), E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), while these markers showed a little
change in the subjects fed with a low fat diet, suggesting that it is the macronutrient composition,
not the weight loss or the caloric reduction the real responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity [102].
Basic research provides evidence that KD play a neuroprotective role in some acute or chronic
neurodegenerative diseases. Rats fed a KD for 3–4 weeks showed a reduced peripheral inflammatory
response after the injection of Freund’s complete adjuvant in their paw, compared to animal fed
a standard diet. Ketone metabolism results in decreased production of reactive oxygen species,
known to contribute to inflammation. Moreover polyunsaturated polyunsaturated fatty acids activate
PPAR which inhibit NF-kB and AP-1 [104].
KD neuroprotective activity has been analyzed previously, based on its anti-inflammatory effects.
In a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis KD reverted the increased expression
of inflammatory cytokines, as well as the production of reactive oxygene species [105].
In a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease, where substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons
dysfunction is induced by mPTP treatment, KD was shown to inhibit the proinflammatory activation
induced by mPTP [106]. Activated microglia produce relevant proinflammatory citokines, including
IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha which were associated to dying or damaged dopaminergic neurons [107].
In the study by Yang et al. [106] KD was able to decrease the activation of microglia and its products
IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, sparing at the same time tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in
substantia nigra, compared to control animals fed a standard diet. Moreover, the deficit of motor
function induced by mPTP was partially but significantly recovered by KD pre-treatment. A study
focused on Parkinson’s disease patients showed that a KD supplied for 28 days induced a significant
improvement in symptoms [108].
7. Conclusions
The results obtained so far by applying the ketogenic diet to the treatment of several neurological
diseases seem to be particularly interesting for the recovery of cognitive functions, although they are
numerically limited. Different studies conducted on animal models have proposed a causal role for KD,
although they do not always reflect with precision the pathogenesis underlying the development of
neurological diseases. The few studies conducted on humans available so far are based on a pre/post
design but without a reference control group and without randomization. Of particular interest were
the RCTs that correlated the introduction of KD to an improvement of verbal receptive vocabulary and
of reaction time in children affected by epilepsy, as well as an improvement in attention and memory
in patients affected by multiple sclerosis. The results demonstrated causal evidence and stressed the
need to increase the number of studies to demonstrate that 4:1 KD induces a cognitive improvement in
neurological diseases.

The metabolomics techniques and the network-based integration methodologies will allow us to
investigate the interaction among multiple genes, epigenetics and environmental factors, in order to
better understand the pathogenesis of AD, to study and to monitor the activity and the efficacy of new
therapeutic approaches such as KD and, finally, to develop a personalized management of the disease.
