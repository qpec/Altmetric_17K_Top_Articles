Abstract
Purpose Uptake of preventive therapy for women at increased breast cancer risk in England is unknown following the intro-
duction of UK clinical guidelines in 2013. Preventive therapy could create socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence 
if it is more readily accepted by particular socio-demographic groups. In this multicentre study, we investigated uptake of 
tamoxifen and evaluated socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with initiation. We explored women’s experiences 
of treatment decision-making using qualitative interview data.
Methods Between September 2015 and December 2016, women (n = 732) attending an appointment at one of 20 centres in 
England to discuss breast cancer risk were approached to complete a survey containing socio-demographic details and nul-
liparity. Of the baseline survey respondents (n = 408/732, 55.7% response rate), self-reported uptake of tamoxifen at 3-month 
follow-up was reported in 258 (63.2%). Sixteen women participated in semi-structured interviews.
Results One in seven (38/258 = 14.7%) women initiated tamoxifen. Women who had children were more likely to report use 
of tamoxifen than those without children (OR = 5.26; 95%CI: 1.13–24.49, p = 0.035). Interview data suggested that women 
weigh up risks and benefits of tamoxifen within the context of familial commitments, with exposure to significant other’s 
beliefs and experiences of cancer and medication a basis for their decision.
Conclusions Uptake of tamoxifen is low in clinical practice. There were no socio-demographic differences in uptake, sug-
gesting that the introduction of breast cancer preventive therapy is unlikely to create socioeconomic inequalities in cancer 
incidence. Women’s decision-making was influenced by familial priorities, particularly having children.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common female cancer in the UK 
[1], and incidence is projected to rise over the next 20 years 
[2]. A meta-analysis of nine randomised trials of selective 
estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) indicated women at 
increased risk of breast cancer had at least a 30% lower risk 
of the disease if they were allocated to the treatment arm 
compared with placebo [3]. These trials informed the UK 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
clinical guideline for familial breast cancer (CG164) which 
recommended offering preventive therapy (tamoxifen or 
raloxifene) to women at increased risk of breast cancer [4, 
5]. Optimal therapeutic benefit depends on adequate uptake 
and adherence to the recommended course of therapy. How-
ever, uptake can be low and long-term persistence problem-
atic [6–8].

Patient’s decision-making about preventive therapy is 
complex and emotionally charged. Women may be reluctant 
to initiate tamoxifen if they have concerns about side effects 
and perceive uncertain treatment efficacy and low personal 
risk [9–12]. Family and friends’ experiences of cancer and 
side effects of medicines may shape women’s beliefs and 
perceptions about their risk and preventive therapy [13]. 
There is research to suggest that the decision to undergo pro-
phylactic surgery is influenced by the presence and number 
of children within the family [14–16] and marital status [17]. 
Familial networks may influence women’s decision-making 
regarding preventive therapy use.
Women in the least deprived socioeconomic groups 
have a higher breast cancer incidence, but lower mortality 
[1]. Differences in incidence may partly be explained by 
higher screening uptake among more affluent groups [18, 
19]. However, incidence appears to be increasing among 
ethnic minorities [20]. If preventive therapy is more read-
ily accepted by particular population groups, its introduc-
tion could inadvertently create or exacerbate inequalities in 
breast cancer incidence. Uptake of preventive therapy across 
different socio-demographic groups should be monitored 
closely.
The objectives of this mixed-methods study were to (1) 
assess the uptake of tamoxifen following the introduction of 
clinical guidelines [4]; (2) evaluate socio-demographic and 
clinical factors associated with tamoxifen initiation; and (3) 
undertake an in-depth exploration of women’s experiences 
of treatment decision-making using qualitative interview 
data.
Methods
Recruitment
In the UK, women present to their primary care physician 
(general practitioner) to discuss their personal risk of breast 
cancer, and are referred to secondary care if they are likely 
to meet breast cancer risk criteria [4, 5]. The type of clinic 
they are referred to depends on local protocol and strength 
of their family history. While local variation exists, clinical 
genetics centres see women at high risk of breast cancer 
(≥ 30% lifetime risk) where they are counselled about their 
risk and their eligibility for genetic screening for the breast 
cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Family history clinics 
provide breast screening and risk assessment for women 
who are at increased risk but not BRCA carriers. Breast 
clinics who routinely investigate women with suspicious 
breast lesions may also manage women with a family his-
tory. Women with family histories that indicate a moderately 
high risk (17–30% lifetime risk) will be managed within 
family history clinics and breast clinics.
In the survey study, women were approached following 
their appointment at one of the following clinic types; family 
history clinics (n = 12), breast clinics (n = 4), clinical genetic 
centres (n = 3) and a family history clinic with genetics sup-
port (n = 1). Research nurses or clinicians at twenty sites 
across England recruited participants between September, 
2015 and December, 2016. Following verbal consent, par-
ticipant data were made available to the research team via 
a secure online portal. Data included: patient age; address 
and postcode; email address; and risk classification [mod-
erately high risk or high risk]. Participants were assigned a 
unique study identification code, which was linked to the 
baseline survey. Participants were invited to complete a 
baseline survey and return it to the research team using a 
freepost envelope. Women who did not respond were sent 
a reminder postcard after 2 weeks, and a full study pack at 
4 weeks. Respondents to the baseline questionnaire were 
sent a follow-up survey at 3 months, and the same approach 
to reminders was used. In the interview study, women were 
approached following an appointment at one of two family 
history clinics.
Eligibility criteria
Women were eligible to participate in the survey and/or 
qualitative interviews if they were aged ≥ 18 years, spoke 
English, had a discussion with a healthcare professional 
within their appointment about preventive therapy, were 
classified as having a moderately high or high risk of breast 
cancer by NICE guidelines, and had no known contraindica-
tions for tamoxifen use. Women were excluded if they were 
unable to consent, read English or had a previous diagnosis 
of breast cancer.
Measures
The baseline survey contained the following measures, 
some of which were dichotomised for analysis: marital 
status (married/cohabiting vs. single/divorced/separated/
widowed); ethnicity (White groups vs. others); education 
(≥ degree level vs. < degree level); employment (full/part-
time vs. all other employment types); and self-reported 
health (poor, fair, good, excellent). Nulliparity was assessed 
by the following item: ‘Do you have any children? If so, how 
many?’ Women were classified as having children or not.
Age was calculated from date of birth provided from NHS 
records entered onto the secure portal. Women were coded 
as ≤ 35 years; 36–49 years; and ≥ 50 years. Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD) scores were calculated from the partici-
pant’s postcode, and women were classified into tertiles [21].
Breast cancer risk category (moderately high or high), as 
outlined by NICE guidelines, was provided by clinic staff 
[4].

Uptake of tamoxifen was assessed in the 3-month follow-
up questionnaire. Women were asked to indicate which of 
the following 7 statements applied to them: (1) ‘I decided 
immediately that I did not want to take tamoxifen’; (2) 
‘After some thought, I decided that I did not want to take 
tamoxifen’; (3) ‘I am still deciding if I want to take tamox-
ifen’; (4) ‘I met with my GP to talk about tamoxifen, and 
I decided against taking it’; (5) ‘I met with my GP to talk 
about tamoxifen, but they would not prescribe it’; (6) ‘I have 
a prescription for tamoxifen from my GP’; and (7) ‘I am cur-
rently taking tamoxifen’. Women were classified as initiating 
tamoxifen if they reported either of the latter two responses.
Data analysis
The quantitative analyses were pre-registered [22]. Differ-
ences in socio-demographic and clinical factors between 
responders and non-responders to the baseline questionnaire, 
and between those who completed the baseline survey and 
women who returned both a baseline and follow-up survey 
were analysed using Pearson’s Chi-square (Χ2) tests.
Among women providing outcome data on tamoxifen ini-
tiation, Pearson’s x2 tests were used to compare uptake by 
participant characteristics. A multivariable logistic regres-
sion compared the role of nulliparity on uptake, adjusting 
for participant characteristics. Clinic type was not included 
in our analyses due to multicollinearity with breast cancer 
risk category; those attending clinical genetics centres are 
likely to have a higher risk of breast cancer. Analysis was 
undertaken in SPSS v24.0. Statistical significance was set 
at a 2-sided p < 0.05.
During January 2014 to November 2016, face-to-face 
interviews were conducted to explore women’s breast can-
cer prevention decision-making. Interviews were digitally 
recorded, transcribed verbatim, and anonymised. Inter-
view transcripts were coded using the method of constant 
comparison, whereby data are compared systematically for 
similarities and differences and coded accordingly [23]. The 
analysis allowed patterns and relationships between themes 
to emerge. Overarching themes were developed, which were 
iteratively refined over the course of analysis. NVivo10 sup-
ported the analysis.
Results
Survey data
In total, 732 women were invited to complete a survey. 
Baseline surveys were returned by 408 women (55.7%). 
Among the 408 respondents, 275 surveys (67.4%) were 
returned by women attending family history clinics, 59 
surveys (14.5%) were from a combined family history and 
genetic centre; 49 surveys (12%) were from breast clinics 
and 25 (6.1%) from clinical genetic centres. There were no 
differences between responders and non-responders with 
regard to clinical risk (p = 0.62), socioeconomic status 
(p = 0.054) or age group (p = 0.086) (Table S1). Data on 
the decision to initiate chemoprevention were provided 
by 258 (63.2%) of previous respondents at least 3 months 
after the initial appointment. Women were more likely to 
provide follow-up data if they were from a higher socio-
economic status group (p < 0.001). There were no other 
socio-demographic differences between women who pro-
vided baseline data only and those who returned a 3-month 
survey (Table S2).
Women providing data at both time points (n = 258) 
are described in Table 1. The mean age was 45.4 years 
(SD = 7.89); 10.1% were aged ≤ 35 years old; 65.1% were 
aged 36–49 years; and 24.8% were ≥ 50 years old. The 
majority of women had children (79.5%), were white 
(96.5%), educated below degree level (54.7%), married 
or cohabiting (77.0%) and were in full-time employment 
(85.7%). Most women reported having either ‘good’ (59.0%) 
or ‘excellent’ (18.4%) health. There were more women at 
moderately high risk of breast cancer (61.6%) than high risk 
(37.6%).
Uptake of chemoprevention was 14.7%. Women who 
had children were more likely to initiate chemoprevention 
than those without children (17.6% vs. 3.8%, respectively). 
Differences in uptake did not vary between other socio-
demographic groups. In a multivariable model adjusting for 
participant characteristics, women who had children were 
significantly more likely to have initiated chemoprevention 
than those without children, although confidence intervals 
were wide (OR = 5.26, 95% CI = 1.13, 24.49, p = 0.035) 
(Table 1). No other factors affected uptake of chemopre-
vention in the multivariable model. Uptake of chemopre-
vention by age group was 3.8% for women aged ≤ 35 years; 
17.3% for women aged 36–49 years; and 12.5% for women 
aged ≥ 50 years. Age was not entered into the regression 
model, due to the small number of women aged ≤ 35 years 
initiating chemoprevention. Quantitative observations were 
explored in the qualitative analysis.
Interview data
In total, 18 women returned consent forms and 16 completed 
a semi-structured interview (Table 2). Average interview 
length was 35 min (range 20–53 min).
The interviews confirmed that the decision to initiate pre-
ventive therapy is affected by a multitude of psychological 
and social factors. Decision-making was heavily influenced 
by family and close friends. The following themes were 
important to the decision-making process.

Theme 1: Considering children in making 
decisions
For some women, having children had a major influence on 
their consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of 
taking tamoxifen. The women described how they thought 
of their children, and not just themselves, when considering 
cancer prevention and risk.
…If it reduces my chances of developing breast can-
cer, I am healthier for [my children], I am around for 
them… So I feel that it just makes me more secure as a 
parent…All of a sudden, my health is more important 
because it affects them as well as me. (JP, 35 years, 
married, 2 children).
These women were aware of the possible side effects 
of tamoxifen, but consideration of their children weighed 
stronger. Consequently they were more willing to consider 
taking tamoxifen.
I’m not necessarily going to get breast cancer, but if 
it can prevent it, I would be willing to take it, defi-
nitely. Obviously I’ve got young children to think 
about now. I would be happy to start taking it, but 
yes, I do look at the side effects. (JB, 38 years, mar-
ried, 2 children).
However, one woman felt the immediate impact on her 
quality of life would have consequences for her family and 
children. YN was concerned about how side effects would 
impinge on her ability to care for her parents and children, 
and therefore did not feel like she could cope with any addi-
tional burden in the short-term.
I have huge responsibilities to the point where I’ve had 
to stop working, and so I need to try and be as healthy 
as I can and function as best I can. If I’m going to go 
on a medication… which okay maybe in the long term 
might be beneficial, possibly…but in the short term I 
just can’t cope…I’ve weighed up the pros and cons

and…don’t want to go down that route. (YN, 59 years, 
cohabiting, 2 children).
Theme 2: Impact of others’ on beliefs 
about medication
Familial networks influenced women’s attitudes and beliefs 
towards taking medication in general. A culture of stoi-
cism and distrust of medications within the family resulted 
in more negative attitudes and beliefs towards tamoxifen 
uptake.
I come from a family of people who don’t take tablets, 
and who definitely don’t take tablets on a regular basis. 
“They’re bad”, that’s the general feeling about tablets. 
There’s something about willpower in it as well, “you 
don’t need to take a tablet. You just need to grit your 
teeth and get through it”. (LL, 47 years, married, 0 
children).
Women who reported negative attitudes towards medi-
cation within their social networks felt their family would 
hold strong views about tamoxifen use. This impacted their 
likelihood of communicating with family members around 
taking tamoxifen.
I don’t know exactly the amount of cancer within the 
family because in those days as well what you’ve got 
to remember is it was the c word…I haven’t really dis-
cussed [tamoxifen] with anybody to be honest. (LM, 
53 years, cohabiting, 0 children).
These women were also more likely to maintain a stoical 
attitude, discussing their reluctance to take medications in 
general on a regular basis.
I don’t like taking medication. I will avoid taking med-
ications because I think that’s part of my philosophy. 
I’m not an interventionist, I think I have a fear that tak-
ing medications may impact on your body in negative 
ways…we don’t always understand all of the impact 
that chemicals may have on our body. (MC, 60 years, 
married, 2 children).
Women who witnessed significant others adhering to 
daily medication regimens for other conditions had more 
positive attitudes and beliefs towards tamoxifen than those 
without these social models.
My dad is on quite a lot of medication for high blood 
pressure, and diabetes. I’ve grown up with him always 
being on it, so it doesn’t really feel any different…
to have someone who’s on medication…It wouldn’t 
impact my life, but it would be a different routine to 
have to get used to. (RF, 26 years, single, 0 children).
Many women did not associate tamoxifen with cancer 
prevention. Instead, they considered it as a cancer treatment, 
which evoked fear and painful memories about significant 
others.
She used the word “tamoxifen” and I think that fright-
ened me. I knew what that word meant. That word 
meant cancer, not chemoprevention. (LL, 47 years, 
married, 0 children).

All women sought the opinion of significant others, par-
ticularly female family members, who had experience of 
taking tamoxifen as an adjuvant treatment. Male partners 
were rarely consulted. These discussions often negatively 
influenced women’s attitudes towards initiating preventive 
therapy, particularly with regard to side effects.
I spoke to my best friend about it actually and she 
said, “No way because maybe it’d give you the meno-
pause”. She said she wouldn’t take it herself but she 
said, “No don’t take it either because what would you 
want to give yourself that for? (TT, 49 years, single, 
0 children).
Women questioned the value of taking preventive therapy 
if it had not been effective for a close family member taking 
tamoxifen as part of their treatment for breast cancer.
Another thing that has swung my decision around not 
taking tamoxifen is that when my mother had breast 
cancer she was prescribed tamoxifen at one point…and 
it didn’t have any effect for her at all…If your mother’s 
cancer didn’t respond to it, then I would expect that I 
wouldn’t respond either and therefore it may not give 
me any additional protection. (MC, 60 years, married, 
2 children).
Theme 3: Emotional response to risk
Following their consultation, some women were confronted 
with feelings of fear, anxiety and denial. They reported a 
lack of control over their cancer risk, and the options avail-
able to them. For many, their upbringing and significant oth-
ers were the driver of these emotions.
Cancer, the actual word cancer wasn’t even used, my 
mum came from a very Irish farm background where 
things like that were not discussed. (LM, 53 years, 
cohabiting, 0 children).
Some women felt they were predestined to develop can-
cer, due to multiple family members developing and dying 
from cancer. They expressed a diminished sense of respon-
sibility, where they had little control over their breast cancer 
risk. This negatively influenced decisions about tamoxifen 
uptake.
I always felt…I would develop breast cancer. I was 
eight when [my mother] died…It’s very magical think-
ing about, well, if I’m going to get it, I’m going to get 
it, and it doesn’t matter what I do. That it’s kind of 
written in the stars…that it’s my fate. So, what then 
would have been the point of any breast cancer preven-
tion…? (LL, 47 years, married, 0 children).
Discussion
In this multicentre study investigating uptake of tamoxifen 
following the introduction of UK clinical guidelines [4], only 
one in seven women at increased risk of breast cancer initi-
ated preventive therapy. There were no socio-demographic 
differences in uptake, indicating inequalities are unlikely to 
be created or exacerbated by the introduction of preventive 
therapy into routine clinical practice. However, this obser-
vation does not preclude the potential for inequalities to be 
occurring at a different point in the clinical pathway, such 
as presentation to primary care for risk assessment refer-
ral. There is evidence that people from an ethnic minority 
background are less likely to access cancer genetic services 
[24]. The low level of uptake reported here is comparable 
with previous meta-analyses reporting 9% [7] and 15% [25] 
of women accepting preventive therapies in non-trial set-
tings. Similar data were reported in a UK single centre study 
undertaken in the months preceding the release of NICE 
guideline CG164 [13]. The factors influencing uptake of 
preventive therapy are poorly understood, which hampers 
our ability to support informed patient decision-making and 
optimise therapeutic benefit [7]. We demonstrated that the 
complex decision to initiate tamoxifen does not occur in iso-
lation; choosing to initiate a medication is considered within 
the context of social, work and family commitments [26, 27].
Perceptions of personal need for medication and concerns 
about its negative effects are key to decision-making [28, 
29]. Having children increased the perceived need for pre-
ventive therapy; women were more likely to initiate tamox-
ifen if they had children because a reduction in risk meant 
they would be healthier for longer and thereby more able to 
care for their families. As a result, having children weighed 
stronger than experiencing side effects of medications. 
However, the decision to initiate tamoxifen remained unre-
solved if women expressed strong concerns about preventive 
therapies. Some women decided not to initiate tamoxifen 
because of concern about the impact possible side effects 
would have on their caregiving roles. Preventive therapy 
decision-making should be considered within the context 
of women’s short- and long-term goals and priorities, such 
as family, social or work commitments [30].
Distrust of medicines and a culture of stoicism within the 
family influenced women’s beliefs towards taking regular 
medication and reduced the likelihood of discussing tamox-
ifen with family members. This demonstrates how family 
and friend’s experiences contribute to women’s beliefs 
towards their breast cancer risk and the use of preventive 
therapies. Although individuals’ beliefs about disease and 
treatment are amenable to change within a healthcare setting 
[31], it is important to recognise that beliefs and feelings are 
constructed and embedded within the social context.

This study had limitations. As with most observational 
studies there is a risk of selection bias in response and reten-
tion rates. Confidence intervals were wide for the association 
between having children and tamoxifen uptake. Although 
tamoxifen was the most commonly offered preventive ther-
apy, raloxifene may have been discussed in some centres. 
This did not appear to influence uptake in those centres. 
All women were given three months to decide whether they 
would like to initiate tamoxifen, however, some women 
may not have made a decision at the time of returning the 
survey. Higher uptake may be seen with longer follow-up. 
These data were from surveys which are reliant on accurate 
self-reporting.
In conclusion, uptake of tamoxifen in women at increased 
risk of breast cancer is low in routine clinical practice. There 
were no socio-demographic differences in uptake, which 
is encouraging for the future adoption of other preventive 
therapy strategies. However, this observation does not pre-
clude other potential sources of inequality, such as primary 
care presentation. Women weigh up the risks and benefits 
of preventive therapies within the context of other commit-
ments and priorities, including their family and children. 
Encouraging women to discuss their beliefs and perceptions 
about preventive therapies within the consultation may help 
support informed decision-making.
