Currently, noninvasive glucose monitoring is not widely appreciated because of its uncertain measurement accuracy,
weak blood glucose correlation, and inability to detect hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia during sleep. We present a
strategy to design and fabricate a skin-like biosensor system for noninvasive, in situ, and highly accurate intravascular
blood glucose monitoring. The system integrates an ultrathin skin-like biosensor with paper battery–powered
electrochemical twin channels (ETCs). The designed subcutaneous ETCs drive intravascular blood glucose out
of the vessel and transport it to the skin surface. The ultrathin (~3 mm) nanostructured biosensor, with high sensi-
tivity (130.4 mA/mM), fully absorbs and measures the glucose, owing to its extreme conformability. We conducted in
vivo human clinical trials. The noninvasive measurement results for intravascular blood glucose showed a high cor-
relation (>0.9) with clinically measured blood glucose levels. The system opens up new prospects for clinical-grade
noninvasive continuous glucose monitoring.
INTRODUCTION
Diabetes is a worldwide chronic disease that threatens human health
and lives (1, 2). The World Health Organization has reported that near-
ly 422 million adults were diagnosed with diabetes in 2014. Millions of
people have lost their lives because of poorly controlled blood glucose.
Regulated and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) of diabetes pa-
tients can provide better monitoring and control of blood glucose and
prevent complications (fig. S1). Glucose monitoring with commercially
available products relies on invasive lancet approaches. Repeated finger
pricksnotonly hinderpatientcompliancebecause of pain but also result
in skin irritation and bacterial infections.
Researchers have performed numerous studies regarding non-
invasive glucose monitoring (3–5). Optical measurements such as infra-
red spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, and fluorescence (6–8)
are easily affected by interference from confounding factors. Indirect
measurements using metabolic heat, Raman spectroscopy, impedance,
and polarization changes (9–11) lack specificity for glucose. Body fluids
such as sweat, saliva, and tears are potential candidates for direct glucose
measurement (12–18). However, the density of glucose in those fluids is
only 1 to 10% of that in the blood. Thus, the correlation with blood glu-
cose levels cannot be guaranteed. In addition, body fluid glucose mea-
surement accuracy decreases because of water evaporation, seasonal
fluid volume changes, and other internal components. Repeated and
forced “sampling”(forinstance,sweating) isnot suitable forcontinuous,
long-term, and during-sleep monitoring. As compared with the above
methods, measuring the glucose in interstitial fluid (ISF) is more
promising. The methods for sampling ISF are ultrasound, laser technol-
ogy, and reverse iontophoresis (19–21). Although reverse iontophoresis
is the most prevalent among these methods, it is scarcely recognized by
physicians before the blood glucose correlations are further improved.
In addition, the use of a high-density current and a long warm-up time
often induces skin irritation and pain in users (22–24).
RESULTS
Noninvasive intravascular glucose measuring principle and
the skin-like biosensors
Here, we present a strategy for a fully noninvasive biosensor system for
intravascular blood glucose monitoring. The system consists of a flexible
biocompatible paperbatteryandultrathinskin-likebiosensors.Thepaper
battery (Fig. 1B) is first attached to the skin to generate subcutaneous
electrochemical twin channels (ETCs) (Fig. 1A and fig. S2). The ETCs
act through hyaluronic acid (HA) penetration into the ISF (anode
channel), intravascular blood glucose refiltration from vessels, and glucose
reverse iontophoresis to the skin surface (cathode channel) (Fig. 1A).
Under the paper battery anode, high-density positively charged HA is
transdermally repelled into the ISF. Extra HA increases the ISF osmotic
pressure and breaks the balance between ISF filtration andreabsorption,
thus promoting intravascular blood glucose refiltration at the arterial
ends and reducing the reabsorption at the venous ends. A higher mo-
lar glucose concentration in the ISF also increases the flux of reverse
iontophoresis in low-current occasions (25). As a result, more intra-
vascular blood glucose is driven out of the vessel and is transported
to the skin surface (fig. S3). The measurement of “real” blood glucose
(that is, the glucose previously existed in the blood together with the
glucose previously in the ISF) greatly improves the blood glucose
correlation.
Next, the ultrathin skin-like biosensors completely conform to the
skin and measure the outward-transported glucose driven by ETCs.
These biosensors are multilayered with “sand dune” nanostructures,
which exhibit better electrochemical properties and higher sensitivity
(Fig. 1C and fig. S4). The layers of the biosensor, from bottom to top,
are polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (80 nm), polyimide (PI) (1.6 mm),
a nanostructured deposited gold thin film (100 nm), an electrochemically
deposited nanometer transducer layer (51.8 nm), and a transfer/glucose
oxidase (GOx) immobilization layer (~1 mm). We first fabricate the
biosensors on the silicon wafers with various shapes (fig. S5) and
then transfer-printed (26–28) them by bionic “capillary grabbing.” The
transfer-printed biosensors are ultrathin, skin-like, and flexible (Fig. 1D,
left). The total thickness of the multilayer biosensor is approximately
3 mm so that the biosensor fully conforms to the skin with intimate con-
tact (Fig. 1D, right). The conformal contact with dermal ridges increases
the contact areas between the biosensor and outward-transported

 glucose on the skin (29). A larger surface energy reinforces the absorp-
tion of glucose on the biosensor surface. As a result, we can collect
more glucose and measure it by such biosensors, thereby improving
the measurement accuracy and signal-to-noise ratio of in vivo mea-
surements (30).
Electrochemical and mechanical characterization of
the device
We designed the biosensor as a “two-electrode system” (a working elec-
trode and a counter electrode) in the in vivo measurements. The very
small reaction current measurement condition could guarantee the
electrochemical measurement accuracy. The dual electrodes were fab-
ricated and patterned simultaneously but modified selectively via the
insulation across the two electrodes. For the Prussian blue (PB) trans-
ducer layer electrochemical deposition (ECD) on the deposited nano-
meter gold electrode, a shorter deposition time yields a thinner PB thin
film, which is more flexible (fig. S6) and has a lower ion diffusion
resistance. However, the PB thin film that was electrochemically
deposited on the original gold electrode (O-PB) (Fig. 2A, left) cracked
easily during short (for example, 15 s) deposition (Fig. 2A, right, and
fig. S7), thus showing that the thin film was fragile and the adhesion to
the electrode was weak (fig. S8). To obtain nanometer-thick and high-
quality PB thin films, we fabricated the sand dune nanostructures on
the surface of the gold electrode before ECD (Fig.2B, left). The PB
thin film deposited on the nanostructured gold electrode (N-PB) was
uniform and complete (Fig. 2B, right) with a thickness of approximately
51.8 nm (fig. S9).
Nanostructured gold (N-Au) is better for nano-PB deposition than
original gold (O-Au) because of the greater number of defects and larger
surface area, which facilitate particle deposition and thin film growth.
Using numerical simulations, we further studied otheradvantages of the
nanostructures. The consumption of solutes during deposition formed
an ion density gradient in the microreaction pool, inducing inner flow
and ion transfer over the electrode surface (Fig. 2C, left, and fig. S8). As
shown in the results of fluid mechanics simulations, surface nanostruc-
tures largely increase the flow velocity over the electrode (Fig. 2C, right,
top). A higher flow rate facilitates ion replenishment during deposition,
increasing the deposition rate. The thin film growth rate is higher on
nanostructured surfaces in the simulation of the ECD (Fig. 2C, right,
bottom). In the ECD of PB, the deposition current of N-Au was nearly
three timeslargerthan that of O-Au (Fig. 2D) for the same experimental
parameters. In the cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan, O-PB and N-PB had
similar redox voltages, whereas the redox current of N-PB (Fig. 2E) was
more than five times higher than that of O-PB (Fig. 2E, inset), thus in-
dicating better redox performance. Moreover, the N-PB exhibited excel-
lent stability after 20 scan cycles (fig. S10). In an electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, N-PB demonstrated lower dif-
fusion resistance than O-PB, owing to its larger active surface areas
(Fig. 2F and fig. S11). Besides nanostructures, the resistance was fur-
ther decreased in thinner N-PB. Three N-PB thin films with different
thicknesses (deposition times: 15 s, 90 s, and 10 min) were compared
for the response to the same density of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The
response of the thinner N-PB thin film was greater and faster (Fig. 2G).
In time stability tests, the CV properties of N-PB did not change after
2 months of storage at room temperature (Fig. 2H and fig. S12).
We characterized the mechanical properties of O-PB and N-PB by
nanoindenters (fig. S13). The Young’s modulus and hardness of N-PB
were smaller than those of O-PB (Fig. 2I), thus indicating that the form-
er has smaller grain sizes, fewer defects, and lesser lattice distortion even
for a higher deposition speed and with a shorter deposition time. The
grain stress concentration largely decreased, thus making the nano-
meter N-PB thin film firm and unbreakable.

 Bionic transfer printing and glucose
measurement calibration
To achieve perfect skin conformability and higher measurement accu-
racy, thinner biosensors are desirable. PI is spin-coated and cured on the
silicon wafer as the substrate before the electrode fabrication and PB
deposition. Compared with ready-made commercial polymer thin
films, this coating has a smaller thickness (1.6 mm), higher fabrication
accuracy (0.7 mm), and better surface conditions. After ECD, the
greatest challenge is how to pick up the ultrathin but fragile biosensor
from the substrate while retaining both the shape and function.
Inspired by the “Rose of Bethlehem” in the Israeli desert, we used
bionic “ROSE” (rising oriented stickiness evaporation) for the biosensor
transfer printing. We performed the ROSE by using only drops of chi-
tosan solution containing GOx (Fig. 3A). Thus, we achieved the transfer
printing and enzyme immobilization process simultaneously. The
transfer began with dropping the sticky solution on the surface of the
on-wafer fabricated device. As the solvent evaporated, the drop became
smaller while the drop’s edges remained fixed. When the drop started to
form a thin film, the resulting capillary force grabbed and rose up bio-
sensor edges. The delamination of the biosensor from the wafer spread
inwardly, eventually picking up the entire biosensor thin film from the
wafer (movie S1). With the help of ROSE, biosensors with different
patterns can be automatically transferred (Fig. 3B). After the biosensor
was ROSE-transferred, we performed a CV scan for comparison with
the results before transfer printing (Fig. 3C). The redox voltages and
currents differed only slightly from the pretransfer test values, thus
showing that the PB transducer layer and the gold electrode were still
complete and functional.
After transfer printing and enzyme immobilization, we character-
ized the biosensor’s responses to different glucose densities (Fig. 3, D
and E). The glucose biosensing sensitivity of the low-density range (5 to
35 mM) was 130.4 mA/mM (Fig. 3D, inset), that of the moderate-density
range (50 to 100 mM) was 158.0 mA/mM (Fig. 3E, inset), and that of
the high-density range is 196.3 mA/mM (fig. S14). The biosensor’s re-
sponses and CV characterizations remained stable in repeated ex-
periments (Fig. 3F and fig. S15). The biosensor was more selective for
glucose than other skin interference components (Fig. 3G). Although
temperature and pH changes affected the biosensor response (fig. S16),
the interference induced by water evaporation and residuals can be
minimized because we used the ISF instead of other fluids (for example,
sweat and tears) for the measurement. Generally, the skin surface tem-
perature fluctuates by approximately 0.3°C at room temperature in a
20-min period of time (fig. S17), thus causing a measurement drift as
small as 9 nA/cm2.
Errors can be fully compensated by correcting the result with real-
time and in situ skin temperature measurement. The nondeposited gold
electrode acts as a linear resistance temperature sensor, with a tempera-
ture coefficient of resistance of 0.001/°C (Fig. 3H).

 In vivo clinical trials on human subjects
In in vivo clinical trials, we removed the paper battery after 20 min of
ETC HA penetration and reverse iontophoresis process (Fig. 4A).
Then, we firmly attached the ultrathin skin-like biosensor to the
cathode-contacting area for skin surface glucose measurement
(Fig. 1D, right). The biosensor response was shown by amperometric
I-t curves (Fig. 4B).
The transport of the glucose in the reverse iontophoresis process is
dominated by electroosmosis. The molar flux of the glucose is
determined by the potential gradient across the skin and the molar con-
centration of the initial solute (25).
To verify the effect of ETCs, we performed an in vivo control test
(with and without ETC HA penetration). The response of the biosensor
with ETC HA penetration was much higher than that of the other bio-
sensor, thus indicating that more glucose was transported from the ves-
sel and ISF during the test (Fig. 4C). According to the theoretical
analysis(Supplementary Text), the glucose density in the ISFwas largely
increased because of the HA-induced blood glucose filtration.
At the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force General Hospital
(China), we recruited three volunteers (one male and two females aged
24, 37, and 62 years) to participate in the in vivo clinical trials. None of
thesubjectshadamedicalhistoryofheartdisease.Subject1(male,24years
old) andsubject 2 (female,37 years old) were healthy,whereas subject 3
(female, 62 years old) had type 2 diabetes. All the subjects were fully
informed of the possible risks and provided with informed consent.
Subject 1 measured his capillary blood glucose with finger-prick gluco-
meter (Fig. 4D, left). Subjects 2 and 3 each underwent an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT). With sampling through vein detained
needles (Fig. 4D, right), the vein plasma blood levels of subjects 2
and 3 were measured with blood tests. All the subjects underwent
noninvasive in vivo measurement with our ETC wearable devices at
the same time as the blood sampling. During a 1-day period, subject
1’s blood glucose was measured hourly with a clinically approved gluco-
meter (ACCU-CHEK Performa, Roche) and the device during the
time period 10:00 to 23:00. The results showed that the device mea-
surement results (blue squares) matched well with the glucometer
results (red dots), with a 1-hour time lag (Fig. 4E). The time lag was
due to the ~20- to 30-min intrinsic density time lag (between glucose
in ISF and blood) and the ~25-min measurement operation time.
Increasing the reverse iontophoresis voltage and adjusting the
correlated model could decrease the time lag. The statistical analysis
showed that the two data groups had a high correlation coefficient of
0.915 (P < 0.001). For 5-day continuous monitoring, subject 1’s blood
glucose was measured daily at 08:00, 09:00, and 10:00 with the gluco-
meter and the device (Fig. 4F). Considering the time lag, the gluco-
meter measurement results were compared with the results from
the device 1 hour earlier. The device measurement results correlated
well with the glucometer results, with a high correlation coefficient of
0.900 (P < 0.05). For the OGTT, the correlation between the device
measurement results and the blood test results was confirmed to have

 higher correlation coefficients of 0.9846 (P < 0.02) (subject 2) and
0.9997 (P < 0.07) (subject 3) (Fig. 4G). There were no signs or reports
of irritation, pain, or inflammation on the skin surface for any of the
subjects during and after the ETC device measurement (fig. S18).
DISCUSSION
The skin-like noninvasive blood glucose monitoring system measures
the intravascular blood glucose and the glucose in ISF. The ETCs greatly
improve the correlation between the noninvasive measurement results
and the real blood glucose level. With proper calibration, the system is
potentially suitable for medical-grade CGM and insulin therapy when
working with micro-insulin pumps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fabrication of the biosensor
Preparation of the silicon wafer
The silicon wafer was cleaned with acetone, deionized (DI) water, and
isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The IPA was blown off with nitrogen. The sil-
icon wafer was heated and dried using a heater at 120°C for 5 min.
Film making
A layer of PMMA (MicroChem) was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 10 s
and 3000 rpm for 30 s, and the PMMA film was cured at 180°C for 10 s.
A layer of PI (PI-5J, Yidun) was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 10 s and
3000 rpm for 30 s, and the PI film was cured at 80°C for 1 hour, 120°C
for 1 hour, and 140°C for 1 hour.
Metal deposition and patterning
A layer of 10-nm Cr and 100-nm Au was deposited on the surface of the
curedPIfilmwithanelectronbeam.Thesiliconwaferwascutinto1cm×
1 cm pieces. Au and Cr were photolithographed and etched into
patterns such as interdigital and serpentine shapes.
Fabrication of gold surface nanostructure
The silicon wafer was dipped into the gold etchant (KI + I + H2O) with
the gold side down horizontally for 8 s. The gold surface was cleaned
with DI water and blown dry.
Selective deposition of PB film on dual electrodes
The ECD aqueous solution was composed of with DI water, 2.5 ×
10−3 M FeCl3, 2.5 × 10−3M K3[Fe(CN)6], 0.1 M KCl, and 0.1 M HCl.
The buffer aqueous solution was composed of DI water, 0.05 M
KH2PO4, 0.05 M K2HPO4, and 0.1 M KCl. ECD was done in three-
electrode system (fabricated working electrode, Ag/AgCl reference
electrode, and Pt counter electrode) in a micro-electrochemical reac-
tion pool (fig. S8). Deposition was done with potentiostatic polariza-
tion at 0.4 V versus reference electrode for 15 s by electrochemical
workstation (CS300H, CorrTest Instruments).
Electrochemical characterization of the electrode
All the electrochemical characterizations were done on the electro-
chemical workstation. Voltage was set at −0.05 to 0.35 V versus reference

 electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV/s in CV scans (Figs. 2, E and H, and
3C and figs. S10, S15, and S16B). EIS tests were swept from 1 × 10−2 to
1 × 104 Hz (Fig. 2F and fig. S11). Response time test to H2O2 was done
in I-t measurement with voltage set as 0 V versus reference electrode
(Fig. 2G).
Mechanical characterization of the electrode
The mechanical property test was done on TriboIndenter (Ti-950,
Hysitron). The indenter was pressed into the PB film to set the depth,
and the load-displacement curve was recorded. The Young’s modulus
and hardness of the film were calculated from the curve.
Bionic ROSE transfer printing and enzyme immobilization
Preparing chitosan solution
An aqueous solution of 2% chitosan was prepared by dissolving chitosan
powder into 2% acetic acid solution. The solution wasstirredandheated
to 80°C until chitosan completely dissolved. Glycerol (0.8%) was added
and stirred evenly. The solution was placed at room temperature until it
became clear without air bubbles.
Preparing GOx solution
GOxwas resolved in DI waterto prepare an aqueousenzyme solution of
34 mg/ml. The solution was placed at room temperature until it became
clear without air bubbles.
Preparing the transfer print sticky solution
The chitosan solution was mixed with a GOx solution at a ratio of 1:1.
The solutionwasstirred andplacedat room temperature untilitbecame
clear without air bubbles.
Transferring and immobilization
Drops of sticky solution were dripped onto the surface of the wafer-
based deposited PB and gold electrode before they flew out of the
wafer. The device was placed horizontally at room temperature for
4 to 5 hours.
Electrochemical characterization of transferred PB
The transferred thin film device was coated on the silicon wafer, and CV
scan (−0.05 to 0.35 V versus reference electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV/s)
was performed in the buffer solution.
Calibration of glucose measurement
The device was measured in the buffer solution as working elec-
trode, with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and Pt as the counter
electrode. The device was calibrated with glucose solution density
of three ranges. Low density ranges from 5 to 40 mM at a step of 5 mM
every 100 s. Moderated density ranges from 50 to 100 mM at a step of
10 mM every 100 s. High density ranges from 150 to 225 mM at a step
of 25 mM every 100 s. The response was recorded by amperometric
I-t curve (0 V versus reference electrode). The fitting result of the
current response as a function of glucose density was calculated by
the current density increment (relative current change) of every
glucose adding step.
pH and temperature influence test
The influence of the pH value of the buffer solution was tested with
the buffer solution of different pH values (by adjusting the ratio of
KH2PO4 and K2HPO4). Glucose response tests at 30, 35, and 40 mM
were done in the buffer solution of pH 5.0, 5.68, and 6.18. Tempera-
ture influence test was done with a water bath. The device’s response
to the same density glucose was recorded in different temperature
solutions.
Selectivity tests to other interferences
40 mM AA, 40 mM HA, 40 mM UA, 40 mM LA, and 40 mM glucose were
added to the buffer solution in order twice. The amperometric I-t curve
was recorded during the test (0 V versus reference electrode).
Temperature calibration of the temperature sensor
The device was placed in a water bath. The water bath was heated,
and the water temperature was recorded with a Pt temperature sen-
sor. The resistance of the gold temperature sensor in the device was
recorded using a resistance meter (TH2515, Tonghui Electronic).
ETC measurement process
Preparation of the skin to be measured
Scrub scream was smeared to the skin surface and rubbed to remove
dead skin on the epidermal layer. The scream and dead skin were
washed with DI water. The waterwaswiped out and blown dry. Medical
alcohol (75%) was used for sterilization. We waited until the alcohol
evaporated completely.
Preparation of the paper battery to be used
The voltage of the paper battery (nominal voltage, 3 V; Power Paper
Ltd.) was measured and checked to ensure that it is at the nominal
voltage. The anode and cathode surface was cleaned with DI water,
and the water was wiped out. High-density HA was dropped on the
anode of the paper battery and spread evenly. The paper battery was
attached to the prepared skin surface, covered, and fixed with
waterproof and biocompatible film dressing (OPSITE FLEXIGRID,
Smith & Nephew).
Glucose measurement with the biosensor
After 20 min, the film dressing and paper battery were removed from
the skin surface. We firmly attached the biosensor to the cathode area
for glucose measurement.
After-test treatment
The skin surface was washed with DI water and medical alcohol.
The anode and cathode surface of the paper battery was washed
with DI water.
In vivo glucose measurement experiment
Invasive glucose measurement was done using a commercial gluco-
meter (ACCU-CHEK Performa, Roche) and vein detained needles.
Ethical approval for in vivo experiments
The in vivo experiments were done under the guidance and supervision
of the PLA Air Force General Hospital. All procedures followed the
guidelines of the International Review Board and were approved by
the PLA Air Force General Hospital Medical Ethics Committee.
