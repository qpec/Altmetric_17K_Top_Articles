IMPORTANCE The literature suggests that hospitals with better nursing work environments
provide better quality of care. Less is known about value (cost vs quality).
OBJECTIVES To test whether hospitals with better nursing work environments displayed
better value than those with worse nursing environments and to determine patient risk
groups associated with the greatest value.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective matched-cohort design, comparing the
outcomes and cost of patients at focal hospitals recognized nationally as having good nurse
working environments and nurse-to-bed ratios of 1 or greater with patients at control group
hospitals without such recognition and with nurse-to-bed ratios less than 1. This study
included 25 752 elderly Medicare general surgery patients treated at focal hospitals and
62 882 patients treated at control hospitals during 2004-2006 in Illinois, New York, and
Texas. The study was conducted between January 1, 2004, and November 30, 2006; this
analysis was conducted from April to August 2015.
EXPOSURES Focal vs control hospitals (better vs worse nursing environment).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thirty-day mortality and costs reflecting resource
utilization.
RESULTS This study was conducted at 35 focal hospitals (mean nurse-to-bed ratio, 1.51) and
293 control hospitals (mean nurse-to-bed ratio, 0.69). Focal hospitals were larger and more
teaching and technology intensive than control hospitals. Thirty-day mortality in focal
hospitals was 4.8% vs 5.8% in control hospitals (P < .001), while the cost per patient was
similar: the focal-control was −$163 (95% CI = −$542 to $215; P = .40), suggesting better
value in the focal group. For the focal vs control hospitals, the greatest mortality benefit
(17.3% vs 19.9%; P < .001) occurred in patients in the highest risk quintile, with a
nonsignificant cost difference of $941 per patient ($53 701 vs $52 760; P = .25). The greatest
difference in value between focal and control hospitals appeared in patients in the
second-highest risk quintile, with mortality of 4.2% vs 5.8% (P < .001), with a nonsignificant
cost difference of −$862 ($33 513 vs $34 375; P = .12).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hospitals with better nursing environments and
above-average staffing levels were associated with better value (lower mortality with similar
costs) compared with hospitals without nursing environment recognition and with
below-average staffing, especially for higher-risk patients. These results do not suggest that
improving any specific hospital’
s nursing environment will necessarily improve its value, but
they do show that patients undergoing general surgery at hospitals with better nursing
environments generally receive care of higher value.

P
ast studies have shown that hospitals with excellent
nursing environments, as confirmed in a national peer-
assessed recognition program, have lower mortality1-5
andlowerfailure-to-rescuerates,6yetothershavereportedun-
clear patient cost and revenue benefits associated with hos-
pitals known to have good nursing work environments.7,8
This study asks whether selecting hospitals based solely
onexcellentnursingenvironments(definedbyhavingbothna-
tionalpeer-assessedrecognitionandabove-averagenursestaff-
ing) identifies a set of hospitals that display better outcomes
and value, a question most relevant to a patient seeking ad-
vice on where to go for care. Our approach was different from
previous studies. We did not ask whether a specific hospital
wouldbenefitfromimprovingitsnursingenvironment,aques-
tion relevant to an administrator capable of changing the en-
vironment of the hospital. Therefore, we purposely did not
match on individual hospital characteristics, instead seeking
to compare 2 groups of hospitals with very different nursing
environmentsbutverysimilarpatientsandallowingotherhos-
pital characteristics to vary naturally with the 2 groups.
Furthermore, by closely matching pairs of patients from
hospitals with better and worse nursing environments, we ex-
plored whether better nursing environments especially ben-
efit patients of higher initial risk.
Methods
Study Population
The data set comprised Medicare fee-for-service claims for el-
derlypatientsadmittedforgeneralsurgeryinIllinois,NewYork,
andTexasfrom2004-2006.Weacquiredthefollowingfiles:the
Master Beneficiary Summary File, inpatient claims, outpa-
tient claims, and Carrier/Part B bills. The study was conducted
between January 1, 2004, and November 30, 2006; this analy-
siswasconductedfromApriltoAugust2015.Thisresearchpro-
tocol was reviewed by the Children’
s Hospital of Philadelphia
institutional review board and judged to be non–human sub-
jects research, and informed consent was not required.
Patient Characteristics
Patient characteristics were defined using the index admis-
sion and a 90-day look-back in all utilization files. Variables
included patient age, year of admission, sex, race, emergency
department admission status, transfer-in status, and 31 co-
morbidities (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). Patient prob-
ability of 30-day death was estimated by a model fit to an ex-
ternal data set that was not used for matching (eAppendix 2
in the Supplement). We estimated a propensity score using all
of the matching covariates9,10 for attending a hospital with a
good work environment. We also required an exact match
within pairs on all 4-digit principal procedure codes (N = 130;
see eAppendix 3 in the Supplement for the complete list).
Hospital Characteristics
Wedefinedeachhospital’
snursingenvironmentusingthe2007
list of a national voluntary accreditation program for nursing
environment excellence that has been found by many stud-
ies to identify hospitals with significantly better nursing
environments.2,11Eachhospital’
snurse-to-bed(NTB)ratio,resi-
dent-to-bed ratio, nurse mix, technology level, and number of
beds were determined using the Medicare Provider of Ser-
vice file. The NTB ratio was defined by dividing the number
of full-time–equivalent registered nurses and licensed practi-
cal nurses by the number of total beds. Likewise, the resident-
to-bed ratio was defined by dividing the number of residents
by the number of total beds. Nurse mix was the proportion of
registered nurses among the total number of registered nurses
and licensed practical nurses. Technology level was consid-
eredhighbythepresenceofaburnunitortheprovisionofcoro-
nary artery bypass graft surgery or organ transplantation.12,13
Outcomes
Thirty-day mortality was our primary quality-related out-
come. We also report in-hospital mortality, in-hospital and 30-
day complications (38 common complications that occur af-
ter surgery, as defined in previous work; eAppendix 4 in the
Supplement),14-17 in-hospital and 30-day failure to rescue,14,18
all-cause readmissions within 30 days of discharge, length of
stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) use.
We used 2 approaches to assess economic performance:
costs and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
payments. Our primary metric was 30-day cost. We calcu-
lated each patient’
s in-hospital and in-hospital plus 30-day
costs (hereafter referred to as 30-day costs) based on re-
source utilization.15,19 As in previous studies,15,16 in-hospital
costs accounted for any resources used for the patient’
s care
during the period of the index hospitalization. Thirty-day costs
included in-hospital costs, plus any emergency department,
outpatient visit, or office visit costs, as well as any costs aris-
ing from a rehospitalization that began within 30 days of the
index admission date (counting all costs from the entirety of
the readmission, including beyond 30 days). Our costing func-
tion was based on data available in Medicare claims. Cost was
a function of days in the hospital and level of care (ICU vs floor)
foreachday,totalrelativevalueunitsdeterminedfromallbills,
all procedures for which a bill was identified and charged to
CMS (including operating room cost and anesthesia), and any
bill observed using the description provided here. Finally, we
added an estimate of costs directly associated with above- or
below-average NTB ratio. The costing algorithm used salary
datafromtheBureauofLaborandStatistics,adjustedforfringe
benefits20tocreateadjustedcostsreflectingthehospital’
sposi-
tive or negative deviation from the average NTB ratio, and as-
signed to each patient an additional cost or cost reduction re-
flecting the extra or reduced nursing costs per day multiplied
by days spent on the general floor (eAppendix 5 in the Supple-
ment). We also report a second cost metric (cost without NTB
adjustment) that did not include adjustments to cost based on
differing NTB ratios.
Another approach to evaluating value was through Medi-
care payments associated with the hospital admission (eAp-
pendix 5 and eAppendix 6 in the Supplement). We report pay-
ments using 2 definitions. One included all the payments
provided by CMS. A second definition omitted the geography
adjustment (because we did not want possibly different pric-

Statistical Analysis
Matching Algorithm
Each focal patient was treated at a hospital recognized nation-
ally as having a good nurse working environment and an NTB
ratioof1orgreaterandwasmatchedtoacontrolpatienttreated
at a hospital without such recognition and with an NTB ratio
less than 1. The optimal match21 was calculated using the
ASSIGN procedure in SAS (SAS Institute).22 Our algorithm ex-
actly matched 1 of 130 procedures inside each pair and then at-
temptedtobalance42patientcovariatesbyminimizingtheMa-
halanobis distance15,23-26 between cases and control patients,
including age, year of admission, sex, race, emergency admis-
sion status, transfer-in status, the propensity score, the risk
score, and 31 comorbidities (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement).
Matches were performed first without viewing
outcomes.27,28 We aimed to attain standardized differences
in covariate means below 0.1. We also assessed balance using
Fisherexacttestforbinarycovariates29andWilcoxonranksum
test for continuous ones.30
Comparing Outcomes
Outcomes were compared using paired methods: for binary
outcomes, McNemar test31; for continuous outcomes,
m-statistics,32-35 including the permutational t test.32,33,36 We
also used the jackknife procedure to explore the potential ef-
fect of hospital-level clustering on reported P values.37,38
Analyzing Outcomes by Patient Risk Level
Usingadatasetnotoverlappingwithourmatchedsample(eAp-
pendix 2 in the Supplement), we constructed a 30-day mor-
tality model to calculate each study patient’
s mortality prob-
ability. After matching, we ranked each matched pair by its
average risk of mortality, forming quintiles of increasing risk,
and compared outcomes between focal and control patients
inside each quintile. Graphs of focal-control outcome differ-
ences by risk level were produced using LOWESS in R,39 its

Results
Final Patient and Hospital Sample
We identified 172 225 patients who underwent general sur-
geryinthe3statesin606short-term,acute-carehospitals.The
focal group had 25 752 patients in 35 hospitals recognized na-
tionally as having both good nurse working environments and
NTB ratios of 1 or greater (mean NTB ratio, 1.51). Matched con-
trols were drawn from a cohort of 62 882 patients treated at
298 nonrecognized hospitals with NTB ratios below 1 (mean
NTB ratio, 0.69).
Focal hospitals with excellent nursing environments dif-
fered from controls in many ways, as seen in Table 1. For
example, 21.5% of patients (n = 5400) in the focal group
attended hospitals that were major teaching hospitals with
resident-to-bed ratios above 0.25 compared with 5.7% of
matched control patients (n = 1420). More focal patients
attended hospitals that had high-level technology available
(21 823 patients [87.0%] vs 14 827 [59.1%]), and more focal
patients attended large hospitals, as measured by bed size
greater than 250 patients (22 286 patients [88.9%] vs 15 934
[63.5%]) (see eAppendix 7 in the Supplement for the charac-
teristics of the hospitals where focal and control patients
were treated).
Quality of the Patient Matches
Using the 25 752 general surgery patients treated in the 35 fo-
cal hospitals, we formed 25 076 pairs matched exactly for the
130 surgical procedures (97.4% of the available focal pa-
tients), with 293 of the 298 available control hospitals repre-
sentedinthematch.Table2displayssomeofthevariablesused
in the match. All 130 principal procedures were matched ex-
actly, and all other patient covariates (n = 42) were balanced,
withnostandardizeddifferenceaftermatchingexceeding0.05
SD. See eAppendix 8 in the Supplement for complete details
of this extremely balanced match, including frequencies of
principal procedure codes.
Outcomes
Table 3 compares outcomes of focal patients and matched
control patients. Focal patients had lower 30-day mortality
rates than control patients (4.8% vs 5.8%; odds ratio [OR],
0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.86; P < .001; clustered P value = .005)

(see eAppendix 9 in the Supplement for jackknife results;
see eAppendix 10 in the Supplement for sensitivity analysis
results). Focal patients also had lower 30-day failure-to-
rescue rates (7.5% vs 8.9%; OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90;
P < .001) and were in the ICU less often (32.9% vs 42.9%;
OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.52-0.57; P < .001). Length of stay was
slightly shorter among focal patients than matched control
patients (m-estimate, 8.4 vs 8.6 days; paired difference,
−0.1; 95% CI, −0.3 to −0.0; P = .01). Results for in-hospital
outcomes were generally similar to 30-day results (eAppen-
dix 11 in the Supplement).
Did better quality cost more? As measured by resource uti-
lization, focal patients had similar in-hospital and 30-day costs
per patient as their controls. Thirty-day cost per patient was
$27 131 vs $27 292 (focal vs control), a difference of −$163 per
patient pair (95% CI, −$542 to $215; P = .40). If we take away
the NTB adjustment, we see a focal-control difference of
−$2038 per patient pair (P < .001; clustered P value < .001).
Payments from Medicare were higher in focal patients. Es-
timated 30-day payments for focal patients were $26 091 per

direct medical expenditure payments were removed, 30-day

CI, −$1113 to −$589; P < .001; clustered P value = .03). In-
hospital payment results were similar to the 30-day results

Analyzing Outcomes by Hospital Characteristics
The central question of this study asks whether value differ-
ences exist across hospitals selected for better or worse nurs-
ing environments and NTB ratio, but a different question is
the extent to which the nurses themselves are the cause of
the value differences. An explanatory variable of interest is
teaching status, and all hospital characteristics associated
with teaching status. We divided the 25 076 matched pairs
into 4 possible combinations of teaching status of hospitals
attended by each of the 2 patients in each matched pair (fo-
cal vs control): teaching vs teaching, nonteaching vs non-
teaching, teaching vs nonteaching, and nonteaching vs
teaching. The resulting outcome differences can be seen in
Table 4. For 30-day mortality, the focal patient advantage
was maintained in all comparison combinations except
when the focal patient attended a nonteaching hospital and
the control attended a teaching hospital—when the odds of
mortality become similar. Thirty-day costs were generally
similar in the focal hospitals and controls for all 4 compari-
sons. Intensive care unit use was consistently less in focal vs
control patients, with a very large and significant reduction
in the odds of using the ICU compared with matched control
patients. To verify the stability of these findings, we
repeated the analysis excluding any pairs in which either
patient attended a major teaching hospital (resident-to-bed

ratio >0.25); as can be seen on the right side of Table 4, the
results were similar.
Stratifying the patient pairs by hospital size or technol-
ogy generally yielded results similar to those of the teaching
analysis (eAppendix 12 in the Supplement).
Influence of Patient Risk
Overall, focal patients had better outcomes with costs simi-
lar to those of control patients. Do some types of patients
benefit more than others? The right side of Table 5 divides
the matched pairs into quintiles based on the predicted risk
of 30-day mortality, that is, the risk score that was closely
matched in each pair. Focal patients had lower mortality
than control patients in all risk quintiles, but the difference
was larger and statistically significant among higher-risk
patients. In the second-highest risk quintile, mortality was
1.6% lower at focal hospitals than at control hospitals (4.2%
vs 5.8%; P < .001), and in the highest-risk quintile, mortality
was 2.6% lower at focal hospitals (17.3% vs 19.9%; P < .001).
This trend was statistically significant (P < .001). Focal
patients had 30-day cost similar to that of controls in all risk
quintiles (second-highest quintile: $33 513 vs $34 375 [differ-
ence of −$862]; P = .12; highest quintile: $53 701 vs $52 760
[difference of $941]; P = .25), as well as similar lengths of
stay. Costs without NTB adjustment were lower at focal hos-
pitals, and ICU use was far lower across all risk quintiles.
Figure 1 displays the difference between focal and control
matched pairs plotted against the initial risk of each
matched pair. For 30-day mortality, focal patients are consis-
tently below the line of equivalence that denotes a 0 differ-
ence between the focal minus control patient outcome
(Figure 1A). For cost, it appears there is very little difference
between groups (Figure 1B). Not adjusting for NTB differ-
ences, costs appear lower in the focal group, with savings
increasing with risk (Figure 1C).
Comparing Value Across Nursing Environment
by Patient Risk
In Figure 2, we compare value in the matched pairs of
patients in the control (worse) and focal (better) nursing
environments by patient risk. The x-axis represents the con-
trol minus focal paired difference in 30-day costs for each
matched pair. The y-axis represents the control minus focal
difference in 30-day mortality. The ellipses on these graphs
represent the 95% joint confidence region for cost and qual-
ity mean differences.
We display 6 ellipses: 5 numbered ones including about
5015 matched sets of patients by risk quintile, and a central

ellipse with a centered dot, which is based on all patients
(N = 25 076) (see Appendix 13 in the Supplement for further
explanation of the size of the ellipses). Ellipses crossing the
horizontal axis at 0 suggest no difference in quality. Ellipses
crossing the vertical axis at 0 suggest no difference in cost.
For Figure 2A, most ellipses are above the horizontal line,
suggesting better quality at the focal hospitals (lower mortal-
ity than matched controls). At the same time, most ellipses
also cross the vertical axis, suggesting no difference in cost.
Together, there is a strong case for better value (similar cost
with lower mortality) in the focal group compared with the
matched controls. In Figure 2B, we see a somewhat different
pattern. When we did not adjust for different NTB ratios, the
second-highest risk group displayed both significantly better
quality and significantly lower resource utilization.
Timing of Nursing Environment Recognition
and Outcomes
In this study, we defined a hospital with recognized excellent
nursing environments if this recognition was achieved either
before or including 2007 because it reflects conditions in the
hospital in the recent past, as our patients were admitted be-
tween2004and2006.Toexaminethisdefinitionmoreclosely,
we performed an analysis that excluded the subset of focal pa-
tients whose admissions occurred in hospitals that would be
certified by 2007 but had not yet been certified by the year the
patient was admitted. That is, for a patient to be included in
the new analysis, his or her hospital had to be certified by the
year the patient was admitted. Our results were unchanged.
After exclusions, there were 18 212 matched pairs. The origi-
nal 30-day mortality OR was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86; P < .001;
Table 3); after exclusions, the OR was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-
0.88; P < .001). For 30-day cost, we previously found a differ-
ence of −$163 (95% CI, −$542 to $215; P = .40); after exclu-
sions,thedifferencewas−$138(95%CI,−$584to$307;P = .54).
For ICU use, the previous OR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.52-0.57;
P < .001); after exclusions, the OR was also 0.55 (95% CI, 0.52-
0.57; P < .001).
Discussion
While there is considerable evidence that a better nursing
work environment is associated with better outcomes,1-7 the
question of value has remained uncertain. In this study, we
asked whether 2 large groups of hospitals, defined only by
different nursing environments and NTB ratios, displayed
different value. We chose to examine certified hospitals
with good NTB ratios because these were 2 well-known
and important factors identified with better nursing
environment—the accreditation of the hospital with respect
to nursing environment and the most common and funda-
mental nurse staffing variable. Patients and referring physi-
cians can easily observe such characteristics. When examin-
ing 30-day mortality and cost, we found that focal patients
treated in better nursing environments and NTB ratios
greater than or equal to 1 displayed a clear-cut advantage in
value over patients treated at control hospitals. Focal

The x-axis represents the average risk of each individual matched pair; y-axis, the
difference in outcome (focal-control) inside each matched pair. A point falling
on the horizontal line at 0 represents no difference between outcomes of the
2 patients in the matched pair; a point falling below the line, a better outcome for
the focal vs control patient. LOWESS confidence bands for the central tendency
line were produced using the bootstrap method. The box plots describe the
distribution of predicted risk from the fifth to the 95th percentiles. A, The
mortality advantage from attending a focal hospital increases with escalating
patient risk. OR indicates odds ratio. B, Only small and mostly insignificant cost
differences are seen between focal and control hospitals. DIF indicates difference.
C, The focal patients have lower costs when differences in the nurse-to-bed (NTB)
ratio are not included in the costing formula. DIF indicates difference.

patients have lower mortality with similar costs and, there-
fore, better value.
We also found that while all patients may benefit from hos-
pitals that have a good nursing environment, sicker patients
benefit more. Patients in the highest quintile of risk have the
largest reduction in mortality rates, but not lower costs, con-
firming that improved outcomes are possible for high-risk pa-
tients but expensive. Patients in the second-highest quintile
of risk have substantial reduction in mortality and the largest
reduction in cost, producing the highest value.
FocalhospitalsalsohaddramaticallylowerratesofICUuse.
This finding could be consistent with better nursing care on
the floor, acting as a substitute for ICU care or other resource
utilization for some patients, possibly leading to lower over-
all resource utilization and contributing to the business case
for improving nursing environments.7,8
Our analysis of value based on 30-day mortality and Medi-
care payments displayed results generally similar to those of
the cost analyses. We observed that the 1% improvement in ab-
solute mortality in the focal vs control population (4.8% vs
5.8%) was associated with a statistically significant CMS pay-
mentincreaseofabout$1000($26 091vs$25 067),stillastrong
argument for excellent value.
Because our study asked whether a better nursing envi-
ronmentasdefinedbynationalrecognitionandNTBratiocould
identify hospitals with better value, we purposely did not
match on hospital characteristics. We found that using these
2 variables associated with the nursing environment pro-
duced 2 sets of hospitals with very different characteristics.
Had we asked a different question related to whether a hos-
pital administrator should improve a hospital’
s nursing envi-
ronment, as other studies have asked, then a different match-
ing algorithm using both patient and hospital characteristics
as well as a propensity score for being a recognized hospital
could be used.
A limitation of our study was the use of a voluntary pro-
gram of accreditation for good nursing environments as an in-
dicator of hospital nursing work environment. Although hos-
pitals with formal accreditation have been shown, on average,
to have significantly better work environments than those
without accreditation, there is known overlap in measured en-
vironments between hospitals with and without formal
accreditation.2,11 However, our study did not use formal ac-
creditation alone to define different nursing environments but
also separated hospitals by their NTB ratio, thereby helping to
reducing this overlap.
Conclusions
Patients who undergo surgery in hospitals with better nursing
environments typically display lower mortality, with similar

The x-axis represents the difference between the control minus focal patient
matched pair for 30-day costs (A) or 30-day costs without adjusting for
nurse-to-bed (NTB) differences across hospitals(B). The y-axis represents the
difference between control minus focal matched pairs for 30-day mortality. The
ellipses on these graphs represent the 95% joint confidence region for cost and
quality. For each plot, we display 6 ellipses: 5 numbered ones including about
the same number of patients (n = 5015 or 5016), and a central ellipse with a
centered dot that is based on all patients (N = 25 076) (see Appendix 13 in the
Supplement for further explanation of the size of the ellipses). The ellipses in
A and B are identical with respect to value but differ in cost differences between
focal and control patients. A, The second-highest risk group (ellipse 4) is
completely above the horizontal line at y = 0, suggesting a significant
advantage in quality for the focal group, while the intersection with the vertical
line at x = 0 suggests that the increased costs in the focal group vs the control
group did not reach statistical significance. B, This same risk group displays
lower cost with better quality in the focal group compared with the matched
controls. For the risk strata, avg indicates average.

Invited Commentary
Revisiting Nursing’s Effect
on Surgical Quality and Cost
Amir A. Ghaferi, MD, MS; Christopher R. Friese, PhD, RN, AOCN
Improvements in surgical safety remain an important focus
of hospitals and clinicians. With nearly 100 000 patients dy-
ing per year in the United States after undergoing elective
surgery and mortality rates
varying from 2-fold to 10-
fold across hospitals,1-3 ex-
cess surgical mortality qualifies as a significant public health
problem. Unfortunately, the precise means to improve surgi-
cal safety remain elusive.
While several hypotheses have been proposed to explain
the variation in postoperative mortality, failure to rescue—
death following a major complication—ranks among them as
the most popular, intuitive, and actionable theory.4 Yet res-
cuing patients from surgical complications requires substan-
tial human and financial resources. Increased cost pressures
places “rescue” at odds with current hospital priorities.
In this issue of JAMA Surgery, Silber and colleagues5 evalu-
ate the “value” of improved nursing environments in surgi-
calpatients.Theyevaluatedifferencesinpatientoutcomesand
cost between hospitals with better nursing work environ-
ments, determined by Magnet status and higher nurse-to-
bedratios,andmatchedcontrols.Thisstudyusesalargesample
of Medicare patients with exquisite attention paid to compar-
ing similar populations using rigorous statistical matching
methods.
Two key findings emerge. First, hospitals with better nurs-
ing environments (termed focal hospitals) have a nearly 20%
lower failure-to-rescue rate than control hospitals. Interest-
ingly, even larger benefits were observed in the sickest pa-
tient group. While causation cannot be assumed, the quality
and quantity of nursing care likely enables early recognition
and management of these complex patients. Further, the in-
tensive care unit length of stay was markedly lower in the fo-
cal hospitals, another potential signal of successful rescues as-
sociated with better nursing environments.
Second, the overall value of care delivered at focal hospi-
tals was superior to that of control hospitals. Specifically, fo-
cal hospitals achieved similar costs with decreased mortality,
thereby tipping the value scale. However, care associated with
the sickest patients in focal hospitals was not consistently as-
sociated with lower cost. The survival benefit was offset by
increased spending in this highest risk cohort.
Whilewedonotfullyunderstandhowhospitalsrescuesur-
gicalpatients,6successfulrescuelikelyrequiresteamwork,com-
munication, and leadership skills from front-line nurses. Yet
these attributes are hard to measure, and researchers con-
tinue to work toward gathering pertinent and reliable data in
theseimportantdomains.Executivesmayalsowonderwhether
they should improve nurse staffing, improve working condi-
tions, or both. Despite Silber and colleagues’evidence of the
value of better nurse staffing and hospital recognition for nurs-
ing excellence, safety cultures cannot be changed quickly. For
example, our group has shown that hospitals transitioning to
Magnetstatusdonotimprovetheiroutcomesafterrecognition.7
Committed efforts to understand the context in which res-
cue occurs successfully are needed to provide clinicians and
executives with actionable targets. Armed with such data,
implementation science can help us disseminate promising or-
ganizational strategies to improve patient outcomes while
spending resources judiciously. Surgery is a team sport and the
thoughtful coordination of all the “players” will no doubt im-
prove patient safety.
