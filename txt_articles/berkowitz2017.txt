IMPORTANCE Food insecurity is associated with high health care expenditures, but the
effectiveness of food insecurity interventions on health care costs is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),
which addresses food insecurity, can reduce health care expenditures.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a retrospective cohort study of 4447
noninstitutionalized adults with income below 200% of the federal poverty threshold who
participated in the 2011 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 2012-2013 Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).
EXPOSURES Self-reported SNAP participation in 2011.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total health care expenditures (all paid claims and
out-of-pocket costs) in the 2012-2013 period. To test whether SNAP participation was
associated with lower subsequent health care expenditures, we used generalized linear
modeling (gamma distribution, log link, with survey design information), adjusting for
demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), socioeconomic factors (income, education, Social
Security Disability Insurance disability, urban/rural), census region, health insurance, and
self-reported medical conditions. We also conducted sensitivity analyses as a robustness
check for these modeling assumptions.
RESULTS A total of 4447 participants (2567 women and 1880 men) were enrolled in the
study, mean (SE) age, 42.7 (0.5) years; 1889 were SNAP participants, and 2558 were not.
Compared with other low-income adults, SNAP participants were younger (mean [SE] age,
40.3 [0.6] vs 44.1 [0.7] years), more likely to have public insurance or be uninsured (84.9% vs
67.7%), and more likely to be disabled (24.2% vs 10.6%) (P < .001 for all). In age- and
gender-adjusted models, health care expenditures between those who did and did not
participate in SNAP were similar (difference, $34; 95% CI, −$1097 to $1165). In fully adjusted
models, SNAP was associated with lower estimated annual health care expenditures
(−$1409; 95% CI, −$2694 to −$125). Sensitivity analyses were consistent with these results,
also indicating that SNAP participation was associated with significantly lower estimated
expenditures.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE SNAP enrollment is associated with reduced health care
spending among low-income American adults, a finding consistent across several analytic
approaches. Encouraging SNAP enrollment among eligible adults may help reduce health care
costs in the United States.

mid ever-increasing pressure to control societal health
care costs, Americans with lower socioeconomic sta-
tus consistently have worse health, and, often, higher
healthcareexpenditures.1-3Whilethereasonsforthisarelikely
complex, an emerging body of research suggests that food in-
security, or the inability to consistently access nutritious food
owing to cost, is one important reason.4-27 Conceptually, food
insecurity may reduce dietary quality, force trade-offs be-
tween food and medical care, increase household stress, and
sap cognitive “bandwidth” (the mental resources needed for
complex chronic disease management).28
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is
the nation’
s largest anti–food insecurity program, serving ap-
proximately1in7Americans.29 SNAPprovidesamonthlynear-
cash benefit to participants that supplements household bud-
gets by allowing food purchases, with some restrictions (for
example, SNAP cannot be used for alcohol). SNAP eligibility is
setfederally,butenrollmentpoliciesvarybystate,andthesepoli-
cies can make it easier or harder to enroll, thus subtly encour-
aging or discouraging participation.30,31 SNAP is proven to re-
duceboththedurationandseverityoffoodinsecurityepisodes.32
Though SNAP is not a health program, there is growing interest
among policy makers and clinicians about whether social pro-
grams such as SNAP may offer benefits in the health care sec-
tor. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices’Accountable Health Communities intervention program
will evaluate whether linking those with food insecurity to re-
sources such as SNAP will affect health care expenditures.33
The conceptual model of the relationship between food in-
security and health28 suggests several ways that programs to
address food insecurity might reduce health care costs. In the
long term, alleviating food insecurity may help reduce the in-
cidenceofchronicdiet-sensitiveconditionssuchasobesityand
diabetes, and thus reduce their attendant effects on morbid-
ity and mortality. In the short term, however, the prevalence
of diabetes, obesity, coronary heart disease, and other chronic
conditions is much greater than their incidence. Therefore, in
the short-term, SNAP is most likely to improve health care ex-
penditures by enhancing disease self-management, for ex-
ample by off-loading food budgets to make available finan-
cialresourcesthatcanbespentonmedications,reducingstress
over subsistence needs, and freeing up cognitive bandwidth.
In this study, we sought to determine the relationship be-
tween SNAP program participation and health care costs over
a 2-year period, accounting for factors that may influence the
likelihoodofparticipatinginSNAP.WehypothesizedthatSNAP
participation would be associated with lower subsequent
health care expenditures.
Methods
Data Source and Study Sample
We used data from the 2011 National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS)34,35 linked to Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
2012-2013 data.36 The NHIS is conducted by the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics34 as a nationally representative epide-
miologic surveillance survey. Each year, the Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality generates a new cohort of MEPS
participantsfromasubsetofpreviousNHISparticipantstogather
health care expenditure data over a 2-year period.36 Trained in-
terviewersconductedthesurveysinEnglishorSpanish.34,36Self-
reported expenditure data are both verified and supplemented
using data from clinicians and payers. All adult (age ≥18 years)
NHIS-MEPS participants were eligible for this study. Because
SNAP is a means-tested program based on monthly income,
which can fluctuate over the year, and similar to prior SNAP
studies,31,37 we included participants as potentially eligible for
SNAP if their annual income in the 2011 NHIS was below 200%
of the federal poverty threshold for that year.
The Human Research Committee at Partners Healthcare
exempted this analysis of deidentified data from human par-
ticipants review.
Key Variables
SNAP Participation
The primary indicator of SNAP participation in this study was
the following 2011 NHIS item: “At any time during the last cal-
endar year, did you or any family members living here re-
ceive SNAP or food stamp benefits?” Those who responded af-
firmatively were categorized as participating in SNAP. Owing
to limitations in duration of participation data, our analyses
did not include duration or amount of benefits received.
Health Care Expenditures
The primary outcome for this study was total health care ex-
penditures over the 2-year MEPS period (2012 through 2013).
To aid understanding, we present annualized results in 2015
US dollars (using the Consumer Price Index, available at https:
//data.bls.gov:443/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl).InMEPS,totalhealthcare
expenditures are the actual amount of money either paid on
behalf of the individual by a third party (costs, not charges) or
spent by an individual as out-of-pocket costs.36
Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Clinical Variables
We considered several factors that could confound the rela-
tionship between SNAP participation and health care expen-
ditures. From the NHIS data, we extracted information on age
(modeledwithbothalinearandquadraticterm17)gender,race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, His-
panic,andAsian/multiracial/other),householdincomeasaper-
centage of the federal poverty level, educational attainment

Question Does Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP) participation reduce subsequent health care expenditures?
Findings Using data from 4447 low-income adults who
participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and
the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), we found that
participation in SNAP was associated with lower health care
expenditures by approximately $1400 per year.

 than high school diploma), and whether one had applied for
disability status.38,39 We categorized health insurance as pri-
vate, Medicare (not including Medicare-Medicaid “dual eli-
gibles”), other public (including Medicaid, dual eligibles, and
Department of Veterans Affairs), and uninsured. To account
for area variation in health care spending,40 we also included
variables for census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, or
West), and rural or urban location.
Because our conceptual model posited that the short-
term effect, if any, of SNAP on health care expenditures could
relate to disease management, we also included, from MEPS,
self-reported presence or absence of several clinical condi-
tions: obesity (body mass index >30), hypertension, coro-
nary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, arthritis, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Finally, we included
an indicator of death during the study period.
Statistical Analysis
We first conducted descriptive statistics. Then we sought to
determine the relationship between SNAP participation and
subsequent health care expenditures. To do this, we adjusted
for the observed covariates listed above. Because health care
expenditure data generally contain many observations with-
out any expenditures, but also observations with very high ex-
penditures, we followed the approach proposed by Manning
and Mullahy41 to determine the appropriate functional form
for regression analysis, using a modified Park test. This led to
selecting generalized linear regression with a gamma distri-
bution and log link. For these analyses, we used the survey
strata and sampling weights for NHIS-MEPS.
While standard regression can adjust for measured con-
founders, there may be unobserved characteristics that affect
SNAP participation and health care expenditures. As a sensi-
tivity analysis to address potential confounding by unre-
corded factors, we used a technique called near/far matching
(unpublished data, J.R., Michael Baiocchi, PhD, and S.B.; Au-
gust 2017).42,43 A more detailed description of this approach
is contained in the eAppendix in the Supplement, but in gen-
eral, near/far matching can be thought of as filtering a cohort
to find its most informative pairs—those who are very similar
on measured characteristics (near) but are dissimilar (far) on
the values of an instrumental variable (IV). An IV is one that,
in some way, allocates treatment independently of the likeli-
hood of experiencing the outcome, and thus is analogous to a
randomized clinical trial. Finally, as an alternative to the IV-
based analysis, we conducted an analysis using augmented in-
verse probability weighting (AIPW) (see the eAppendix in the
Supplement for more detail).44
For interpretation, we expressed results as the difference
in US dollars spent per year, using the postestimation predic-
tive margins command in Stata. To investigate factors that may
confound the relationship between SNAP participation and
health care expenditures, we created nested models to exam-
ine changes in the association seen by adjusting for different
factors. To help understand policy implications of changing
SNAP enrollment, we also evaluated the difference in expen-
ditures between SNAP participation and nonparticipation for
2 groups who receive special emphasis in state budgets: those
who are disabled and those who receive non-Medicare public
health insurance, such as Medicaid. To determine whether
therewassupportforourconceptualmodel,whichpositedthat
the short-term effects of SNAP participation would result from
making illnesses easier to manage, we examined marginal pre-
dicted differences in health care expenditures for hyperten-
sion and coronary heart disease. These are 2 conditions where
SNAP participation is particularly likely to affect manage-
mentthroughdietarymodificationandmakingresourcesavail-
able for medications. We expected that differences between
thosewhodidanddidnotparticipateinSNAPwouldbegreater
for these conditions.

 did not report participation (difference, $34; 95% CI, −$1097
to $1165; P = .95) (Table 2).
In generalized linear regression analyses adjusted for ob-
served factors, SNAP participation was associated with a sig-
nificant decrease in estimated expenditures: −$1409 per year
in those who did, vs did not, report SNAP participation (95%
CI, −$2694 to −$125; P = .03). The full model is detailed in
eTable 3 in the Supplement. In sensitivity analyses, the re-
sults from both the near/far matching and AIPW techniques
were qualitatively similar to the results from the generalized
linear model, and both analyses found statistically signifi-
cant differences in favor of SNAP (eTables 2-7 in the Supple-
ment). Figure 2 presents a comparison of the effect estimates
from the different analytic strategies.
We next looked at differences by subgroup. By conduct-
ing a series of nested models, we found that age, insurance,
disability, and comorbidity were likely important confound-
ers of the relationship between SNAP participation and health
care expenditures (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). In specific
subgroups, estimated differences in health care expendi-
tures between those who did and did not participate in SNAP
were notably large in those who receive non-Medicare public
health insurance such as Medicaid (−$2544; 95% CI, −5032
to −$56), those who are disabled (−$3958; 95% CI, −$7796 to
−$107), those with hypertension (−$2654; 95% CI, −$5104
to −$205), and those with coronary heart disease (−$4109;
95% CI, −$7971 to −$247) (Figure 3).

 expenditures in low-income adults. This represents approxi-
mately 30% of the unadjusted average annual expenditure in
the study. Though the estimated amount saved varied some-
what by analytic approach, the finding of reduced health care
expenditures associated with SNAP participation was robust
across several different strategies, which made different mod-
eling assumptions, and was estimated to be greater for par-
ticipants with diet-sensitive conditions previously linked to
food insecurity.24 For comparison, the average per-person
SNAP benefit across the United States is $129 per month, or
$1548 over a 12-month period.45
This study is consistent with and expands our knowledge
regarding the impact of SNAP on health and health care ex-
penditures. The adjusted results reveal that unadjusted esti-
matesarelikelyconfoundedbymeasurablefactorssuchasage,
insurancestatus,disability,andcomorbidity.Priorstudieshave
shown that food insecurity is associated with greater health
care expenditures,46 and that SNAP participants are sicker and
poorer than income-eligible nonparticipants,32 but it was un-
clear if food insecurity interventions could reduce health care
costs. Furthermore, an emerging body of evidence suggests
that interventions targeting food insecurity can improve car-
diometabolic risk factors, which supports a potential mecha-
nism (improved clinical control of chronic disease) for the ob-
served findings.47,48
The results of this study have several policy indications.
Prioritizing ways to make it easier for eligible Americans to en-
roll in SNAP is likely to be a feasible way to help reduce health
care costs. This may be of particular interest to states because
of differences in the funding source between SNAP and health
care costs. As an entitlement program, SNAP benefits are paid
for by the federal government, while Medicaid, which would
likely see some of the savings if health care costs are reduced,

 ispaidforjointlybystatesandthefederalgovernment.49There-
fore, state policies regarding SNAP enrollment may help off-
load state Medicaid budgets. Though not directly addressed
here, the study’
s findings also have implications for ongoing
discussions about modifying SNAP, including eligibility re-
strictions, funding structure, and changes in benefit levels.
Although this study focused on health care expendi-
tures, SNAP is a food insecurity and nutrition program, not a
health care program. SNAP’
s purpose is not to reduce health
care expenditures, and we are of the opinion that its funding
justification does not depend on affecting health care costs.
This study helps answer whether SNAP is associated with
short-term changes in health care expenditures. Neverthe-
less, several questions remain unanswered, and represent
promising directions for future work. Examining the trajec-
tory of expenditures in the period before and after SNAP en-
rollment would add important detail to our understanding of
SNAP effects. It is also important to develop a deeper under-
standing of the mechanism by which SNAP, and other food in-
security assistance programs, could lead to changes in health
and health care expenditures. It is important to evaluate
whether there is a “dose-response” relationship between du-
ration of SNAP participation and expenditures, whether ef-
fects persist over longer periods of time, and whether longer
evaluation periods can detect clinical changes, such as re-
duced incidence of diabetes or cardiovascular events. Fi-
nally, determining the health status of those who are eligible,
butnotenrolledinSNAP,willhelpdeterminewhatpopulation-
leveleffectexpandedSNAPenrollmentwouldbelikelytohave.
Limitations
The results of this study should be interpreted in light of sev-
eral limitations. The data source did not have sufficient inci-
dent SNAP participants to permit a comparison of expendi-
tures before and after SNAP enrollment or to allow for a
difference-in-differences design. SNAP assessment occurred
at a single point in time. Since low-income households often
cycle on and off SNAP, this may have resulted in misclassifi-
cation,eitherforthosewholaterparticipatedinSNAP,or,given
lack of data on participation length, those who were only en-
rolled for a very brief period. Other sources of misclassifica-
tion could include lack of information on eligibility criteria
other than income (such as immigration status or assets), not
reporting SNAP participation owing to stigma, or, for partici-
pants in California where SNAP is combined with Supplemen-
tal Security Income payments, not recognizing the source of
theirbenefits.Thesetypesofmisclassificationwouldlikelybias
estimates to the null.
The methods used as sensitivity analyses have important
limitations that are worth noting. While standard tests of the
instruments we used were consistent with their validity, ulti-
mately IV approaches rely on assumptions that cannot be em-
pirically tested. The generalizability of the findings in the near/
far analysis may have been limited because we were unable
to incorporate survey design information into these analy-
ses.However,sincethematchingprocessbreaksthegeographi-
cal link this may not be a significant issue. Though the esti-
matesacrossthemethodsarequalitativelysimilar,thequantity
estimated by the IV analysis is different from the standard re-
gression analysis. The IV analyses do not estimate population-
level effects50 but rather a local average treatment effect, or
thechangeinoutcomeinthoseforwhomtheinstrumentmade
the difference in receipt of SNAP. Finally, the AIPW analyses
are statistically less efficient than the maximum likelihood es-
timates from the standard regression. These limitations are,
however, balanced by key strengths: the data are longitudi-

Conclusions
Across several analytic approaches, including an IV
approach that accounts for unmeasured confounding, SNAP
participation was associated with lower subsequent health
care expenditures for low-income adults. Helping to address
food insecurity by making SNAP enrollment easier may be
an important way to contain health care costs for vulnerable
Americans.
