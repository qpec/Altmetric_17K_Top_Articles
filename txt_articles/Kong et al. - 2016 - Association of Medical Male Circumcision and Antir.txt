Abstract
Importance—Medical male circumcision (MMC) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are proven 
HIV prevention interventions, but there are limited data on the population-level effect of scale-up 
of these interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. Such evaluation is important for planning and 
resource allocation.
Objective—To examine whether increasing community MMC and ART coverage was associated 
with reduced community HIV incidence in Rakai District, Uganda.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Using person-level data from population-based surveys 
conducted between 1999–2013 in 45 rural Rakai communities, community-level ART and MMC 
coverage, sociodemographics, sexual behaviors, and HIV prevalence and incidence was estimated 
in three time periods: prior to the availability of ART/MMC (1999–2004), during early availability 
of ART/MMC (2004–07), and during mature program scale-up (2007–13).

 Exposures—Community MMC coverage in men and ART coverage in HIV-positive persons of 
the opposite sex based on self-reported MMC status and ART use.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Adjusted incidence rate ratios (adjIRRs) for sex-specific 
community HIV incidence estimated using multivariable Poisson regression with generalized 
estimating equations.
Results—From 1999–2013, 44,688 persons participated one or more surveys (mean age at the 
first survey 24.6 [range 15–49] years; 56.5 % female; and mean survey participation rate 92.6% 
[95% CI: 92.4–92.7%]). Median community MMC coverage increased from 19% to 39%, and 
median community ART coverage rose from 0 to 21% in men and from 0 to 26% in women. 
Median community HIV incidence declined from 1.25 to 0.84 per 100-person-years (PYs) in men, 
and from 1.25 to 0.99 per 100-PYs in women. Among males, each 10% increase in community 
MMC coverage was associated with an adjIRR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.82–0.93). Comparing 
communities with MMC coverage >40% (mean male community incidence=1.03 per-100-PYs) to 
communities with coverage ≤10% (mean male incidence=1.69 per 100-PYs), the adjIRR was 0.61 
(95% CI 0.43–0.88). For each 10% increase in female self-reported ART coverage, there was no 
significant reduction in male HIV incidence (adj IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81–1.13). Comparing 
communities with female ART coverage >20% (mean male incidence=0.87 per 100-PYs) to 
communities with female ART coverage ≤20% (mean male incidence=1.17 per 100-PYs), the 
adjIRR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.61–0.98). Neither MMC nor male ART coverage was associated with 
lower female community HIV incidence.
Conclusions and Relevance—In Rakai, Uganda, increasing community MMC and female 
ART coverage was associated with lower community HIV incidence in men. If similar 
associations are found elsewhere, this would support further scale-up of MMC and ART for HIV 
prevention in sub-Saharan Africa.
INTRODUCTION
Randomized trials have shown that medical male circumcision (MMC) reduces male HIV 
acquisition by 50–60%1–3, and that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces 
HIV transmission by over 90% in HIV-discordant couples4. Mathematical modeling 
suggests that these interventions could mitigate the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, 5–7 
but there is limited empirical evidence for the population-level effects of these interventions 
on HIV incidence in real-world programs.
MMC provides direct protection against male HIV acquisition by removing the foreskin 
which is rich in HIV target cells.8–10 The potential effect of MMC on population-level HIV 
incidence depends on this biologic effect, the level of MMC coverage, risk profiles of men 
accepting MMC, and whether behavioral disinhibition occurs following circumcision.
ART indirectly protects an HIV-negative partner by reducing the viral load of the HIV-
positive person.4, 11 The effects of ART on population-level incidence depends on the 
proportion of HIV-positive persons on ART which is contingent on the guidelines for ART 
initiation, the proportion of eligible persons who initiate treatment, the proportion of persons 
on treatment who are virologically suppressed, and the likelihood that an HIV-uninfected 
person has relationships with a virologically suppressed HIV-positive partner. Early ART

 initiation was highly efficacious in reducing HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples 
who disclosed their HIV results, 4 but in general populations, the effects of ART on HIV 
incidence are likely to be lower, since rates of HIV disclosure, ART coverage, and exposures 
to HIV-positive partners on ART are likely to be more variable.
A community-based study was conducted to assess the associations between MMC and ART 
coverage and community HIV incidence in Rakai, Uganda, using longitudinal population-
based data prior to the availability of MMC and ART, and following the scale-up of these 
interventions.
METHODS
The Rakai Health Sciences Program conducts HIV-related surveillance and provides HIV 
prevention and clinical services in rural Rakai district, south-central Uganda. The area has 
had a generalized heterosexual HIV epidemic since 1970’s. Data for this analysis are derived 
from the 1999–2013 Rakai Community Cohort Study, a longitudinal open cohort of persons 
aged 15–49 years. The study has been described in detail elsewhere.12 In brief, population-
based surveys were conducted approximately every 12–18 months. A census preceded each 
survey to identify eligible community residents for survey participation. Written informed 
consent was obtained at cohort enrollment and follow-up visits. Each participant received a 
permanent identification number used to link data between databases. Experienced same-sex 
interviewers used structured questionnaires to collect information on sociodemographics, 
sexual behaviors, general health, male circumcision status, and long-term medication use 
including ART. Venous blood was collected for HIV testing.
The study was approved by the Scientific and Ethics Committee of the Uganda Virus 
Research Institute, the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, the Committee 
for Human Research at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, and 
Western Institutional Review Board (Olympia, WA).
HIV was detected using two enzyme immunoassays (Murex HIV1.2.0 and Vironostika 
HIV-1/2Plus O), with confirmation of discordant EIA results and of seroconversions by 
Western blot (BioMerieux Vitek) and/or polymerase chain reaction (Abbott RealTime HIV-1 
PCR). Rapid tests were introduced in 2009 using Determine and Stat Pak run in parallel with 
Unigold as a tie breaker, and results were confirmed by enzyme immunoassays for all 
seroconverters, with Western blot or PCR as needed.
Free HIV counseling and testing was offered to all participants, and HIV-positive persons 
were linked to care. ART became available in 2004, supported by the President’s Emergency 
Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The criteria for ART initiation evolved from CD4 < 250 
cells/mm3 (2004 to mid-2011) to CD4 <350 cells/mm3 (mid-2011–2013). Approximately 
15% of the male population are Muslims and practice infant circumcision, and prior to 2004, 
only 5% of non-Muslim men were circumcised. During 2004–2006, a randomized trial of 
MMC for HIV prevention enrolled 4,996 HIV-negative men from the Rakai district (the 
majority were from outside the cohort study communities), half of whom received 
immediate MMC after randomization3. After trial completion, control participants were

 offered circumcision. In late 2007, free MMC services were scaled up with PEPFAR funding 
via fixed facilities and mobile surgical camps throughout Rakai.
Statistical analyses
This analysis was confined to 45 Rakai communities under surveillance since 1999, 
including 15 communities surveyed until 2011 and 30 communities surveyed until 2013. The 
communities were defined in 1994 by local council administrative areas and were separated 
by distance or natural obstacles. They remain separate administrative units despite 
expansions in recent years. Availability of MMC and ART services varied over time, and the 
data were divided into three periods: Period 1 (mid-1999 to mid-2004) prior to the 
availability of ART or MMC, Period 2 (mid-2004 to late-2007) when MMC was provided 
via trial and post-trial services, and the ART program was initiated, and Period 3 (late 2007 
to mid-2013) when scale-up of both services matured. The surveys occurred continuously 
throughout the year, with communities surveyed in the same order during each survey round. 
The survey in a given round provides the endpoints and person time for the preceding 
interval, as well as the baseline observations and start of person time measurement for the 
succeeding interval of observation. Therefore, the end of a time period also serves as the 
beginning of the next period, and there are no fixed dates for the beginning and end of the 
time periods used.
For each community, sex-specific HIV incidence was calculated as the number of incident 
cases divided by the total person-years (PYs) at risk during each time period. PYs for 
incident cases were estimated from the date of the first HIV-negative visit and the date of 
infection (estimated as the midpoint between the last seronegative and first seropositive test 
dates). PYs for persistently HIV-negative persons were estimated from the first and last visit 
dates during each time period. Community incidence was estimated over each time period 
rather than in each inter-survey interval, in part to reflect the changes in ART and MMC 
coverage, and because of the limited number of incident events during an inter-survey 
interval in low-risk communities.
The primary exposures were community-level MMC coverage in men and ART coverage 
among HIV-positive persons of the opposite sex in each time period. Self-reported MMC 
status and ART use were used to estimate coverage in each survey, and were then 
summarized into community-level exposures by time periods (See supplement methods for 
details). Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between 
community MMC coverage in men and ART coverage among HIV-positive persons of each 
sex.
To adjust for potential confounding by community characteristics, for each time period sex-
specific community-level age distributions, proportions reporting multiple sex partners, and 
proportions of sexually active persons reporting non-use (i.e. never-use) of condoms in the 
past year were assessed. Community HIV prevalence in the opposite sex was included as a 
measure of community HIV exposure. Additionally, to adjust for temporal changes not 
captured by the aforementioned factors, an indicator variable for time periods was used as a 
surrogate of unmeasured societal change over study periods. (See Supplement methods.)

 Poisson log-linear models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of community-
level sex-specific HIV incidence associated with the exposures: the logarithm of the 
community HIV incidence rate for a time period was modeled as a linear function of the 
exposures. Robust variance estimates based on generalized estimating equations were used 
to account for correlation between repeated observations in the same communities. The 
primary exposure variables of MMC and ART coverage were analyzed as continuous 
variables to estimate the IRRs associated with each 10% increment in coverage on 
community HIV incidence. Additionally, MMC coverage was modeled as a categorical 
variable (≤10%, >10 to ≤20%, >20 to ≤30%, >30 to ≤40%, and >40%); and ART coverage 
was categorized as ≤20% vs >20% upon considering the variable’s distribution (a cutoff of 
15% was also explored). The associations between community-level exposures and HIV 
incidence were estimated in bivariable models, followed by multivariable models including 
variables significant at p≤0.10 in bivariable analyses. All main multivariable analyses 
included both the primary exposures of MMC and ART coverage. Additionally, the potential 
multiplicative associations of MMC and ART coverage with HIV incidence were explored 
via a multivariable model including both the main terms of the primary exposure variables 
and their interaction term.
Since MMC and ART coverage were correlated over time, to avoid collinearity, sensitivity 
analyses were also conducted using multivariable models which included only MMC or 
ART coverage while adjusting for other confounders. Another sensitivity analysis was 
performed using data from the 30 communities consistently observed from 1999 to 2013. 
Additionally, further sensitivity analyses were conducted using ART coverage estimated 
from the Rakai Health Sciences Program’s clinic records (See Supplement methods).
Model diagnostics were based on aggregated residuals13. SAS 9.3 was used for the 
regression modeling, and p-values were based on two-sided Wald tests with significance 
level of 0.05.
RESULTS
Ten survey rounds were conducted between 1999 and 2013: 44,688 persons participated one 
or more surveys (mean age at the first survey 24.6 [range 15–49] years ; 56.5 % female). The 
mean participation rate was 92.6% (95% CI: 92.4–92.7%) among age eligible residents 
present at time of survey; and among these participants, 94.7% provided a blood sample for 
HIV testing, and 62.6% participated in at least one follow-up survey.
Figure 1 presents distributions of MMC and ART coverage and HIV incidence in the 45 
communities, by sex and by the three time periods. It shows substantial variability in 
coverage and incidence across communities. Both MMC and ART coverage increased over 
time, and were correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient of MMC with female ART 
coverage r=0.53, 95% CI: 0.40–0.64, p<0.001, and MMC with male ART coverage r= 0.48, 
95% CI: 0.34–0.60, p<0.001).
Table 1 left panel summarizes the distributions of community-level exposures for men by

 range [IQR] 12.5–27.3%) in period 1 to 38.5% (IQR 31.9–47.2%) in period 3, and median 
ART coverage in HIV-positive men increased from 0% (IQR 0–0, range 0–2.1%) to 20.7% 
(IQR 15.6–30.2%). The proportions of men aged 20–24 and 25–29 years decreased, whereas 
the proportions aged 35–39 and 40–49 increased over time. In period 3, the proportion of 
men reporting multiple sex partners declined, but the proportion of sexually active men 
reporting non-use of condoms increased. Median male community HIV prevalence was ~9–
10% in all time periods, whereas median male community HIV incidence declined by 32.8% 
from 1.25 (IQR 0.81–1.77) per 100-PYs to 0.84 (IQR 0.48–1.26) per 100-PYs from period 1 
to 3.
Median community ART coverage in HIV-positive women increased from 0% (IQR 0-0, 
range 0–2.0%) in period 1 to 26.3% (IQR 22.0–31.9%) in period 3 (Table 1 right panel). The 
proportion of women aged 20–24 years declined, and the proportions aged 30–34 and 35–39 
years increased over time. The proportion of female self-reported multiple partnerships did 
not vary over time, but the median proportion of sexually active women reporting non-use of 
condoms declined from 74.2% (IQR 69.8–77.9%) to 68.4% (IQR 64.7–71.5%) between 
periods 1 to 3. Female median community HIV prevalence remained relatively stable (~13–
14%), and female community HIV incidence declined by 20.8% from 1.25 (IQR 0.86–1.67) 
per 100-PYs in period 1 to 0.99 (IQR 0.71–1.31) per-100PYs in period 3.
Table 2 presents the unadjusted IRR and adjusted IRR (adjIRR) for male community HIV 
incidence. Each 10% increase in MMC coverage was associated with an adjIRR of 0.87 
(95% CI 0.82–0.93, p <0.001). When modeled as a categorical variable, the observed mean 
community HIV incidence rate was 1.03 per 100-PYs in communities with MMC coverage 
>40% and 1.69 per 100-PYs in communities with MMC coverage ≤10%, and the adjIRR 
was 0.61 (95% CI 0.43–0.88, p=0.007). Each 10% increase in female self-reported ART 
coverage was associated with reduced male HIV incidence in bivariable analysis, but this 
was not statistically significant after adjustment (adjIRR=0.95, 95% CI 0.81–1.13, p=0.58). 
However, when modeled as a categorical variable, the observed mean male incidence rate 
was 0.87 per 100-PYs in communities with female ART coverage >20% and 1.17 per 100-
PY in communities with female ART coverage ≤20% (adjIRR =0.77, 95% CI 0.61–0.98, 
p=0.03). Each 10% increase in female community HIV prevalence was associated with 
increased male incidence (adjIRR=1.44, 95% CI 1.17–1.77). Changes in community male 
age composition and increase in the proportion of men reporting multiple sex partners were 
not significantly associated with male incidence after adjustment. Time periods were 
significantly associated with HIV incidence in bivariable analysis, but the association was 
not significant after adjustment. The model including the interaction between MMC and 
female ART coverage showed no significant multiplicative associations (interaction p=0.36). 
Since MMC and female ART coverage were correlated over time, they were also modeled 
separately in a sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Table 1) which yielded similar results on 
the adjIRRs for MMC and ART coverage.
Table 3 presents the IRRs for female community HIV incidence. Each 10% increase in male 
MMC coverage was associated with lower female incidence in bivariable analysis, but there 
was no significant association after adjustment (adjIRR=1.00, 95% CI 0.93–1.06). 
Categorized MMC coverage was not associated with lower female incidence. Each 10%

 increment in male ART coverage was significantly associated with lower female incidence 
in bivariable analysis, but this was not significant after adjustment (adjIRR=0.98, 95% CI 
0.89–1.08, p=0.67). Categorized male ART coverage >20% compared to ≤20% was not 
significantly associated with lower female incidence (adjIRR=0.86, 95% CI 0.72–1.03, 
p=0.11). Each 10% increase in male community HIV prevalence was associated with higher 
female incidence (adjIRR=1.30, 95% CI: 1.01–1.67), and a higher proportion of women 
reporting multiple sexual partners was strongly associated with higher female community 
incidence (adjIRR= 1.96, 95% CI 1.25–3.06). Community female age composition, non-use 
of condoms and time periods were not associated with female incidence after adjustment. 
The model including the interaction between MMC and male ART coverage showed no 
significant multiplicative associations (interaction p=0.21). The sensitivity analysis that 
modeled ART or MMC coverage separately yielded similar adjIRRs for ART and MMC 
coverage with female community incidence.
Results from the sensitivity analysis of the 30 communities observed continuously from 
1999–2013 were similar to those reported above (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Results 
based on ART coverage estimated from clinic records (Supplementary Tables 5 to 8) did not 
affect most findings, but using the 45 communities and ART coverage estimated from clinic-
records, categorized male ART coverage >20% compared to ≤20% was associated with 
lower female incidence (adjIRR=0.80, 95% CI 0.65–0.98, p=0.03, Supplementary Table 6). 
Supplementary Table 9 summarizes the distributions of community-level characteristics for 
the 30 communities observed continuously from 1999–2013. Supplementary Figure 1 shows 
the comparison between self-reported and clinic-based community ART coverage estimates.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to concurrently assess the associations of 
community ART and MMC coverage with population-level HIV incidence. Increasing 
community-level coverage of MMC was associated with significant reductions in male 
community HIV incidence. For example, in communities with MMC >40%, male HIV 
incidence was 0.66 per 100-PY lower than in communities with MMC coverage ≤10%. This 
difference is substantial to these communities and suggests that increasing MMC coverage 
over 40% could reduce male incidence by ~39% at a population-level. This is comparable to 
the estimated reduction in individual HIV acquisition risk associated with comparable ART 
coverage in South Africa.14 Since MMC provides direct protection against male HIV 
acquisition, this association is plausible and consistent with the estimated associations of 
increasing MMC coverage with male HIV prevalence from cross-sectional analyses in South 
Africa15. Female community HIV incidence was not significantly associated with male 
MMC coverage during the study time period, consistent with mathematical models 
suggesting that the HIV prevention benefits of MMC to women accrue over longer time 
periods.7
In adjusted analyses, ART coverage >20% in the opposite sex was significantly associated 
with lower community HIV incidence in men, but not in women. This potentially reflects the 
higher ART coverage in women than in men (Figure 1 and Table 1), as reported elsewhere in 
Sub-Saharan Africa.16 Additionally, men initiate ART at later stage of disease than

 women,16 potentially increasing the duration of female exposure to infectious partners. The 
ART coverage achieved during this study was modest: even in the latest time period (2007–
13), the median community ART coverage among HIV-infected persons was only 20.7% in 
men and 26.3% in women. This partly reflects the World Health Organization (WHO) 
guidelines for ART initiation during the study time: for example, only 32% of HIV+ persons 
had CD4 counts <350 cells/mm3 in 2011–2013, and some delayed ART initiation for 
personal and social reasons.17, 18
A South African study assessed the associations between ART coverage among HIV-
infected persons within 3 km of a HIV-negative individual and the individual-level risk of 
HIV acquisition.14 Significant associations were only observed with ART coverage >30% 
which is higher than the median coverage in Rakai communities during the study period. 
Additionally, only 26–46% of the eligible South African participants contacted provided a 
blood sample for HIV testing, which may have affected estimates of the associations 
between ART coverage and incidence.19 The Mombasa female sex workers study in Kenya 
reported that each 10% increase in ART coverage among all HIV-infected persons in the 
region was associated with a 23% reduction of HIV acquisition risk in female sex workers , 
but such regional coverage may not accurately reflect exposure among the male partners of 
the sex workers.20 Neither the South African nor the Mombasa study assessed the 
associations of MMC coverage with HIV incidence.
This community-based ecologic analysis is subject to “ecologic fallacy” whereby 
associations observed at a population level may not hold at an individual level. However, the 
efficacy of MMC and ART on individual-level HIV risk was established by earlier clinical 
trials.1–4 The objective of this study was to assess the associations of these interventions 
with HIV incidence at a population-level. As Smith et al. noted, ecologic studies “are the 
first of many steps in the path from science to policy.”21 Strengths of this study include that 
the data were derived from an established cohort with high participation rates, and reflected 
a wide range of service coverages. Few programs in sub-Saharan Africa have population 
based data on service coverages and HIV incidence, which are critical for the empirical 
evaluation of the effect of HIV prevention programs under real-world settings. Additionally, 
ART coverage based on self-reports provided similar estimates to those validated from 
clinical records.
This study has limitations. First, it is an observational study, and potential unmeasured 
confounding may lead to biased estimates of the associations. Second, sexual networks in 
Rakai are wider than the community of residence, thus use of community-level MMC and 
ART coverage may underestimate associations. However, prior Rakai studies suggest that 
over 60% of HIV infections are from relationships within the community,22 and community 
HIV prevalence in the opposite sex was predictive of community incidence in both men and 
women, suggesting that community-based measures reflect the predominant HIV exposures. 
Third, study power was limited by the use of 45 communities as the units of observation; 
however, statistically significant findings for MMC did not change in the sensitivity analysis 
using the subset of 30 communities. Fourth, MMC and ART coverage was estimated from 
self-reports which may introduce misclassification bias. However, a prior study indicated 
high accuracy of men’s self-reported MMC status; 23 and sensitivity analysis showed similar

 results when using ART coverage estimated from clinical records. Additionally, this study 
considered heterosexual transmission as the predominant mode of HIV transmission. 
Transmissions due to homosexual intercourse or contaminated injections could not be 
evaluated, although these are less common in rural Rakai.
Findings from this study have public health implications. WHO estimates that 9.1 million 
men have been circumcised between 2007–2014 in the 14 priority countries. MMC coverage 
in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be around 44%,24 which, based on the findings from 
this study, is likely to have had an effect on male HIV incidence. There are approximately 
25.8 million people living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa, of whom approximately 41% 
were on ART in 2014.25 However, there are wide variations in MMC and ART 
coverage,24, 25 and both fall short of UNAIDS targets. Economic modeling indicates the 
potential cost-effectiveness of jointly scaling up MMC and ART for HIV prevention,5 but 
international resources for treatment and prevention have remained relatively flat since 
2008. 26
CONCLUSIONS
In Rakai, Uganda, increasing community MMC and female ART coverage was associated 
with lower community HIV incidence in men. If similar associations are found elsewhere, 
this would support further scale-up of MMC and ART for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan 
Africa.

 Figure 1. 
Boxplots showing the distributions of community level MMC coverage in men and HIV 
incidence and ART coverage by sex in the 45 communities (including 15 communities 
surveyed from 1999–2011 and 30 communities surveyed from 1999–2013) in Rakai, 
Uganda over the three time periods. In each boxplot, the lower and upper boundary of the 
box represents the first quartile (i.e. 25th percentile) and the third quartile (i.e. 75th 
percentile) of the data,respectively; the horizontal black line in the box is the median; the 
black diamond is the mean; the lower and upper whiskers are the lowest and highest values 
of the data that are not outliers. Any circle outside the whiskers is an outlier, i.e. the data 
value is greater than 1.5 interquartile ranges away from the first and third quartiles. (The 
three time periods include period 1: mid-1999 to mid-2004; period 2: mid-2004 to late-2007; 
and period 3: late 2007 to mid-2013. Surveys occurred continuously throughout the year, 
with communities surveyed in the same order during each survey round. The survey in a 
given round provides the endpoints and person time for the preceding interval, as well as the 
baseline observations and start of person time measurement for the succeeding interval of 
observation. Therefore, the end of a time period also serves as the beginning of the next 
period, and there are no fixed dates for the beginning and end of the time periods used.)
A). Distribution of community MMC coverage over the three time periods. For each period, 
distribution of data for 45 communities is shown by the boxplot (for period 3, data for 15 
communities were from surveys conducted up to 2011, and data for the other 30 
communities were from surveys conducted up to 2013).
B). Distribution of community ART coverage among HIV-positive persons by sex over the 
three time periods. For each period, distribution of data for 45 communities is shown by the 
boxplot (for period 3, data for 15 communities were from surveys conducted up to 2011, and 
data for the other 30 communities were from surveys conducted up to 2013). ART initiation 
criteria evolved from CD4<250 cells/mm3 during 2004–2011 to CD4<350 cells/mm3 during 
2011–2013.
C). Distribution of community HIV incidence by sex over the three time periods. For each 
period, distribution of data for 45 communities is shown by the boxplot (for period 3, data

*: MMC scale-up was mainly targeted on non-Muslim men as Muslims practice infant circumcision. The composition of Muslims and non-Muslims was stable in Rakai: non-Muslim men constituted 85.1%, 84.3% and 84.5% of the male population in Period 1, 2 and 3, 
respectively.
**: The number of men/women for a community during a time period was the sum of the number of men or women in all survey rounds in the period. Overall, there were 11,409 men and 15,166 women who participated in at least one survey round in period 1, 9,376 men and 
12,076 women who participated in at least one survey in period 2, and 12,068 men and 15,149 women who participated in at least one survey in period 3.

MMC: medical male circumcision. IRR: incidence rate ratio. Adj IRR: adjusted IRR. CI: confidence interval. NA: not applicable in the multivariable model because p-value >0.10 in bivariable model.
#The surveys occurred continuously throughout the year, with communities surveyed in the same order during each survey round. The survey in a given round provides the endpoints and person time for the 
preceding interval, as well as the baseline observations and start of person time measurement for the succeeding interval of observation. Therefore, the end of a time period also serves as the beginning of 
the next period, and there are no fixed dates for the beginning and end of the time periods used.
*The full multivariate model included the primary exposures of MMC coverage in men and ART coverage in HIV-positive men, as well as covariates of community HIV prevalence in men, proportions of 
women in age groups of 20–24, 30–34, 35–39 and 40–49, proportion of women reporting multiple sex partnership, and the indicator variable for time period.
##When ART coverage in men was categorized as >15% vs. <=15%, the adjIRR=0.98 (95% CI 0.79–1.20, p=0.82).
