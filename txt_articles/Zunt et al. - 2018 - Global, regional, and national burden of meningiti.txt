Global, regional, and national burden of meningitis, 
1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Meningitis Collaborators*
Summary
Background Acute meningitis has a high case-fatality rate and survivors can have severe lifelong disability. We aimed 
to provide a comprehensive assessment of the levels and trends of global meningitis burden that could help to guide 
introduction, continuation, and ongoing development of vaccines and treatment programmes.
Methods The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2016 study estimated meningitis burden 
due to one of four types of cause: pneumococcal, meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and a residual 
category of other causes. Cause-specific mortality estimates were generated via cause of death ensemble modelling of 
vital registration and verbal autopsy data that were subject to standardised data processing algorithms. Deaths were 
multiplied by the GBD standard life expectancy at age of death to estimate years of life lost, the mortality component 
of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). A systematic analysis of relevant publications and hospital and claims data 
was used to estimate meningitis incidence via a Bayesian meta-regression tool. Meningitis deaths and cases were split 
between causes with meta-regressions of aetiological proportions of mortality and incidence, respectively. Probabilities 
of long-term impairment by cause of meningitis were applied to survivors and used to estimate years of life lived with 
disability (YLDs). We assessed the relationship between burden metrics and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a 
composite measure of development based on fertility, income, and education.
Findings Global meningitis deaths decreased by 21·0% from 1990 to 2016, from 403 012 (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 319 426–458 514) to 318 400 (265 218–408 705). Incident cases globally increased from 2·50 million (95% UI 
2·19–2·91) in 1990 to 2·82 million (2·46–3·31) in 2016. Meningitis mortality and incidence were closely related to 
SDI. The highest mortality rates and incidence rates were found in the peri-Sahelian countries that comprise the 
African meningitis belt, with six of the ten countries with the largest number of cases and deaths being located 
within this region. Haemophilus influenzae type b was the most common cause of incident meningitis in 1990, at 
780 070 cases (95% UI 613 585–978 219) globally, but decreased the most (–49·1%) to become the least common 
cause in 2016, with 397 297 cases (291 076–533 662). Meningococcus was the leading cause of meningitis mortality in 
1990 (192 833 deaths [95% UI 153 358–221 503] globally), whereas other meningitis was the leading cause for both 
deaths (136 423 [112 682–178 022]) and incident cases (1·25 million [1·06–1·49]) in 2016. Pneumococcus caused the 
largest number of YLDs (634 458 [444 787–839 749]) in 2016, owing to its more severe long-term effects on survivors. 
Globally in 2016, 1·48 million (1·04—1·96) YLDs were due to meningitis compared with 21·87 million 
(18·20—28·28) DALYs, indicating that the contribution of mortality to meningitis burden is far greater than the 
contribution of disabling outcomes.
Interpretation Meningitis burden remains high and progress lags substantially behind that of other vaccine-
preventable diseases. Particular attention should be given to developing vaccines with broader coverage against the 
causes of meningitis, making these vaccines affordable in the most affected countries, improving vaccine uptake, 
improving access to low-cost diagnostics and therapeutics, and improving support for disabled survivors. Substantial 
uncertainty remains around pathogenic causes and risk factors for meningitis. Ongoing, active cause-specific 
surveillance of meningitis is crucial to continue and to improve monitoring of meningitis burdens and trends 
throughout the world.

Introduction
Meningitis is an inflammatory condition involving the 
membranes (meninges) covering the brain and spinal 
cord. It can have infectious causes, such as bacteria, 
mycobacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, or be associated 
with autoimmunity, cancer, or reactions to medication. 
Risk factors that predispose individuals to meningitis 
and epidemics include malnutrition,1 household over­
crowding,2 HIV infection,3 absence of immunisation, 
indoor air pollution,4 and sickle cell disease.5 Most deaths

due to meningitis have infectious causes, but the clinical 
severity of disease varies with the causative organism.6 
Bacterial meningitis can rapidly become fatal and lead to 
severe disability in those who survive. Survivors might 
have complications, such as cognitive impairment, 
behavioural problems, hearing loss, motor weakness, 
paralysis, in 
coordination, or seizure disorder; although 
few data are available from low­resource settings,7 one 
study found as many as a quarter of survivors of bacterial 
meningitis had neuropsychological sequelae 3–60 months 
after hospital discharge.7,8 Both bacterial and viral 
meningitides can place a substantial burden upon 
families, communities, and societies.9–11 Although bacterial 
meningitis has often been associated with persistent 
intellectual impairment, some viral pathogens, such as 
parechovirus, have also been associated with impaired 
developmental attainment.12
Immunisation programmes targeting the major 
bacterial pathogens—Haemophilus influenzae type b, 
Neisseria menin 
gitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae—
have successfully reduced cases of meningitis in Africa, 
the Americas, Asia, Australasia, and Europe.10,13,14 The 
H influenzae type b vaccine is now part of immunisation 
programmes across 19 countries and the pneumococcal 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Meningitis is a disease with a high case-fatality rate that is 
known to occur in epidemics, requires timely and appropriate 
diagnosis and treatment to avoid death, and can lead to 
lifelong disability among survivors. In addition to previous 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors (GBD) 
studies, some studies have investigated the causes and 
outcomes of meningitis in large cities and countries, but not 
comprehensive reporting on meningitis burden by cause, age, 
geography, or over time across continents. We searched 
PubMed without language restrictions for five components of 
epidemiology information related to meningitis: (1) incidence 
of all meningitis (from database inception to December, 2013), 
(2) the proportion of meningitis deaths (from database 
inception to November, 2016) and cases (from database 
inception to December, 2013) due to each of its four causes 
(as classified in GBD), (3) case-fatality ratio and long-term 
mortality experience of survivors with chronic complications of 
meningitis (from database inception to December, 2013), (4) 
the proportion of survivors with long-term complications, 
along with the nature and distribution of those complications 
(from database inception to December, 2013), and (5) the 
distribution of sequela severity by type of long-term outcome 
(from database inception to December, 2013). The following 
search string was used in PubMed: (((“Meningitis”[MeSH] OR 
“Meningitis, pneumococcal”[MeSH] OR “Meningitis, 
Haemophilus”[MeSH] OR “Meningitis, Meningococcal”[MeSH] 
OR “Meningitis, viral”[MeSH] OR “Meningitis”[Title/Abstract])

Added value of this study
This study reports on incidence, mortality, and disability of 
overall meningitis and its subtypes for each of 195 countries, 
23 age groups, and both sexes from 1990 to 2016. It leverages 
the strength of the overall GBD 2016 study to generate 
estimates of disease burden that are internally consistent 
within each cause and across all causes, contextualises them 
within the sociodemographic development spectrum, and 
reveals the populations with the greatest need for improved 
meningitis prevention and treatment. Global burden from 
meningitis has reduced, but substantial disparities across 
geographic regions and age groups persist. Cause-specific 
estimates allowed for examination of trends in specific 
infections and their relationship to vaccine programmes. By 
quantifying long-term disability, this study also highlights the 
importance of health systems and societies being prepared to 
support survivors of meningitis.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study estimates that the largest concentration of meningitis 
mortality remains in the meningitis belt, which includes 
26 countries across sub-Saharan Africa—from Senegal in the 
west to Ethiopia in the east—but many other countries also 
continue to have a high burden of meningitis. Vaccine coverage 
should be increased and existing vaccination schedules 
optimised to maximise population protection. Incorporating 
meningitis vaccines into routine vaccination schedules and 
ensuring these vaccines are available and administered in more 
countries should also be considered. Development of new 
vaccines and reinvestment in existing vaccines will be important 
to address the potential of serotype replacement in 
pneumococcal meningitis, to deal with epidemics, and to 
combat forms of meningitis that are not currently preventable. 
In particular, use of pneumococcal conjugate or polysaccharide 
vaccine in more adults and use of available or broader valency 
meningococcal vaccines could result in marked reductions in the 
burden of meningitis. Enhanced availability of appropriate 
antibiotics and health-care services, and low-cost diagnostics at 
the point of care or point of surveillance, are paramount for 
detecting meningitis, improving survival, and reducing 
disability—especially in low-resource settings where the burden 
of meningitis is greatest. Increased ability to detect antibiotic 
resistance will also become more relevant as antibiotic use and 
resistance continue to rise. More robust vaccine coverage and 
cause-specific surveillance data are crucial to improve the 
geographical and temporal resolution of meningitis estimates 
going forward.

vaccine is part of immunisation programmes across 
134 countries.15 The MenAfriVac mass vaccination 
campaign delivered over 270 million doses of menin­ 
gococcal A protein­polysaccharide conjugate (MenA) 
vaccine to children and young adults in 21 of the 
26 countries of the meningitis belt between 2010 and 
2018, which resulted in a marked decline in cases of 
disease;14 the meningitis belt was first defined as a “region 
south of the Sahara between latitudes 4 and 16⁰N” and 
was later expanded to include the Sahelian parts of Benin, 
Cameroon, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Mali, and 
Senegal (appendix).16 However, maintaining control of 
MenA epidemics in the long term depends on these 
countries implementing the vaccine routinely—a strategy 
taken up by only seven countries within the meningitis 
belt to date.14,17
Contemporary information on country­specific in­
cidence, mortality, and long­term disease burden of 
meningitis by cause is needed by governments and 
funders to identify areas of improvement and stagnation, 
strengthen screening and treatment programmes, and 
adequately plan to support the ongoing needs of 
survivors. Such data can help determine country­specific 
immunisation needs, and countries eligible for funding 
can use it to prioritise needs and assist with applications 
for support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, 
and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, among others.
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors (GBD) 2016 study, generated comprehensive 
estimates of meningitis burden by cause at the national, 
regional, and global level from 1990 to 2016. This report 
details the approach, methods, and results of the GBD 
2016 analysis of the global meningitis burden to highlight 
levels and trends by age and geography, over time, and 
with respect to sociodemographic development status. 
The aim is to increase awareness and understanding of 
these estimates for stakeholders who play various roles in 
the identification, management, and prevention of 
meningitis, from researchers and clinicians to policy 
makers, advocates, and planners of neurological services. 
This report also aims to highlight some limitations and 
gaps in the data, with a goal of catalysing collaboration to 
improve future global estimates for meningitis through 
improved data collection, timeliness, and implementation 
of evidence­based policies to reduce the burden of 
meningitis globally.
Methods
Overview
The GBD 2016 estimation strategy for both mortality 
(deaths and years of life lost [YLLs]) and non­fatal health 
outcomes (prevalence, incidence, and years of life lived 
with disability [YLDs]), began with estimation of 
the epidemiology of total acute meningitis and then 
apportioning of that total to four sub­causes. Three specific 
pathogens were considered separately given their relevance 
to public health policy, availability of effective vaccines, 
and comparatively robust data sources: S pneumonia 
(pneumococcal), N meningitides (meningococcal), and 
H influenzae type b. The remaining pathogens (eg, 
bacteria, fungi, and viruses) were grouped together as 
other meningitis; future analyses will consider specific 
pathogens for disaggregation from this category. Complete 
descriptions of GBD 2016 methods and inputs are available 
in corresponding summary publications.18,19 A detailed 
description of methods, including an analytic flowchart, 
data source search and extraction criteria, and model 
development details with respect to meningitis, is available 
in the appendix.
Demographics, definitions, and Socio-demographic Index
The overall goal of GBD estimation methods is to 
combine all available data into an internally consistent 
analytic framework for describing death and disability 
due to each cause of disease or injury. This methodological 
approach was applied to each of the 195 countries and 
territories (11 of which were analysed at the first 
subnational administrative level [eg, states in the USA 
and provinces in China]), 23 age groups, both sexes, and 
for each year from 1990 to 2016 (inclusive). In addition to 
deriving specific estimates for each age group, location, 
sex, and year, GBD 2016 updated the method for 
describing epidemiological transition that is based on the 
Socio­demographic Index (SDI), a composite metric 
based on total fertility rate, education, and per­capita 
income, that is designed to be a summary measure of 
societal development and is scaled between 0 and 100. All 
GBD locations were grouped into SDI quintiles.
Cause-specific mortality
We estimated mortality using vital registration and verbal 
autopsy data that were extracted from all sources available 
at the time of the study and we processed the data using a 
set of standardised algorithms that were used across 
GBD 2016 to account for incompleteness, misclassifica­
tion, and stochastic variability (appendix). International 
Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision (ICD­9) and 
tenth Revision (ICD­10) codes used as the case definition 
for meningitis were 036–036·9/A39–A39·9 (menin­ 
gococcal meningitis), 320·0/G00·0 (H influenzae type b 
meningitis), 320·1/G00·1 (pneumococcal meningitis), 
and 047–049/320·2–322·9 (other meningitis). We then 
modelled all available data using cause of death ensemble 
modelling (CODEm) with ten candidate covariates: (1) the 
proportion of population living in meningitis belt, (2) 
proportion of children younger than 5 years who are 
underweight (≤2 weight­for­age Z scores), (3) proportion 
of households with improved water, (4) the Healthcare 
Access and Quality Index,20 (5) health system access, a 
composite of vaccine coverage and pregnancy services, (6) 
diphtheria­tetanus­pertussis vaccine coverage, (7) lag 
distributed income (in international dollars per capita), (8) 
MenAfriVac vaccine coverage from 2010 to 2012, (9)

hygienically separate human excretia from contact with 
humans), and (10) maternal education (years per capita). 
We chose the CODEm models with the highest out­of­
sample predictive validity and then combined them with 
estimates from all other specific causes of death to ensure 
the sum matched total all­cause mortality for each age 
group, sex, location, and year. We then assigned meningitis 
cause mortality in a mutually exclusive and collectively 
exhaustive fashion using a separate set of models of the 
proportion of meningitis deaths due to each cause. 
These models were informed by a combination of vital 
registration and scientific literature data identified via 
systematic review. YLLs were calculated by multiplying 
age­specific deaths and remaining global life expectancy at 
age of death, which was estimated by GBD 2016 to be 
86·6 years at birth.18
Non-fatal health outcomes
Non­fatal health outcomes were informed by a series of 
complementary data sources and models. First, we gen­
erated internally consistent estimates of overall meningi 
tis 
incidence, prevalence, remission, and mortality using 
DisMod­MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta­regression tool developed 
for GBD. This model was informed by published literature 
identified via systematic review and supplemented with 
inpatient hospital and claims data that were corrected for 
readmission rates and ICD code position (primary vs non­
primary) at discharge. ICD­coded hospital data served 
as the reference category. We then apportioned overall 
prevalence and incidence to underlying causes using a 
second set of DisMod­MR 2.1 proportion models informed 
by scientific literature and surveillance data reporting on 
specific infectious causes. We derived viral meningitis 
estimates by multiplying total meningitis and the ratio of 
viral­to­total meningitis from inpatient hospital sources. 
We calculated the incidence of each long­term cause­
impairment combination by age group, sex, location, and 
year by multiplying the cause­specific case­fatality ratio by 
cause­specific incidence estimates, then applying post­
discharge proportions of health consequences by cause, 
both of which were derived from a meta­analysis.21 We 
paired these data with corresponding long­term mortality 
data to derive prevalence estimates of long­term meningitis 
complications for each population. We then paired and 
multiplied final prevalence estimates with corresponding 
disability weights from the GBD Disability Weights Survey22 
to calculate YLDs, which we then processed through a 
microsimulation framework to account for comorbidity 
between diseases.19 Long­term complications of meningitis 
included intellectual disa­ 
bility, motor impairment, vision 
problems, hearing loss, epilepsy, and behavioural problems. 
The sum of YLLs and YLDs is disability­adjusted life­years 
(DALYs), a composite measure of overall burden.
Risk factor attribution
We calculated attributable burden of meningitis to the 
risk factors low birthweight and short gestation—the 
only two risk factors of the 84 risk factors that met 
GBD 2016 causal criteria for inclusion—but only for the 
early and late neonatal periods as these were the only age 
groups for which evidence was sufficient. We quantified 
the population attributable fractions of low birthweight 
and short gestation by pairing the estimated exposure to 
each component with the corresponding relative risk of 
mortality. Details on low birthweight and short gestation 
estimation are in the GBD 2016 Comparative Risk 
Assessment paper.23
Uncertainty
We captured and propagated uncertainty through all 
calculations by sampling 1000 values (called draws) for 
each prevalence, death, YLL, YLD, or DALY estimate and 
summing draws across age, cause, and location for all 
intermediate calculations. 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UIs) were defined by the ordinal 25th and 975th draw 
values. We calculated change statistics on the mean 
values and at the draw level to derive UIs; significant 
increases and decreases were defined as 975 or more of 
the 1000 draws having a positive or negative value, 
respectively.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or the 
writing of the report. All authors had full access to the 
data in the study and final responsibility for the decision 
to submit for publication.
Results
Summary results for meningitis burden are presented 
here. Complete results for GBD 2016 by age, sex, 
geography, year, and cause, including further detail not 
provided in this manuscript, are available in a set of 
interactive online visualisations called GBD Compare 
 
and are available for download from the GBD Results 
Tool at the Global Health Data Exchange.
3268 unique data sources were used for cause­specific 
mortality and 1348 unique sources for the estimation 
of non­fatal health outcomes from meningitis. More 
geographical and causal detail on dataset coverage for 
each component of estimation is shown in the appendix. 
All input sources and citations for each component are 
available from the GBD Input Data Sources Tool. The 
information on all the DisMod­MR 2.1 models, includ­
ing input data and model performance, are explorable

available.
Incident cases of meningitis globally increased from 
2·50 million (2·19–2·91) in 1990 to 2·82 million 
(2·46–3·31) in 2016. Age­standardised incidence was 
highest in the meningitis belt—ie, the peri­Sahelian 
countries of sub­Saharan Africa stretching from Senegal 
through South Sudan and Ethiopia (figure 1). Overall 
incidence in 2016 varied over 350 times, from a high

of 207·4 (95% UI 183·9–233·9) per 100 000 population in 
South Sudan to a low of 0·5 (0·4–0·7) per 100 000 population 
in Australia. Much of central and western sub­Saharan 
Africa continues to have a high burden of meningitis, with 
few locations showing signs of sustained improvement 
and several countries in particular—Gabon, Equatorial 
Guinea, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zambia—having much 
higher meningitis death rates than would be expected on 
the basis of their SDI.
The global number of meningitis deaths was estimated 
to have decreased by 21·0% from 403 012 (95% UI 
319 426—458 514) in 1990 to 318 400 (265 218–408 705) in 
2016 (table). Most (269 422 [84·6%] of 318 400) of these 
deaths occurred in countries in the low SDI (134 983 
[95% UI 108 808–183 517]) and low­middle SDI (134 439 
[109 866–171 733]) quintiles in 2016. The highest mortality 
rates were estimated for countries in the meningitis belt 
(table). However, of the top ten countries with the greatest 
absolute number of meningitis deaths—India, Nigeria, 
Ethiopia, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Uganda, Tanzania, Niger, Afghanistan, and China—four 
are located outside the meningitis belt (India, Pakistan, 
Afghanistan, China). Of the countries with at least 
1000 meningitis deaths, in 2016 the countries with the 
largest declines were, in descending order, Brazil, China, 
Sudan, USA, Nepal, Haiti, Egypt, Indonesia, Myanmar, 
Niger, and India, all of which saw age­standardised 
declines in meningitis mortality of at least 50% between 
1990 and 2016. Of these 11 countries, only Sudan and 
Niger are in the meningitis belt. Only Zimbabwe was 
estimated to have a significant increase in age­
standardised meningitis mortality rate from 1990 to 2016 
(table).
Of the causes of incident meningitis, Haemophilus 
influenzae type b decreased the most (–49·1%), 
from 780 070 cases (95% UI  613 585–978 219) globally 
in 1990 to 397 297 cases (291 076–533 662) in 2016. 
Meningococcus was the leading cause of meningitis 
mortality in 1990 (192 833 deaths [95% UI 153 358–
221 503] globally) but by 2016, the other causes category 
was the leading cause for both deaths (136 423 [112 682–
178 022]) and incident cases (1·25 million [1·06–1·49]). 
Globally in 2016, 1·48 million (1·04–1·96) YLDs were 
due to meningitis compared with 21·87 million (18·20—
28·28) DALYs, indicating that the contribution of 
mortality to meningitis burden is far greater than the 
contribution of disabling outcomes. Pneumococcus 
caused the largest number of YLDs (95% UI 634 458 
[444 787–839 749]) in 2016, owing to its more severe long­
term effects on survivors.
Trends in deaths, incidence, and YLDs for causes of 
meningitis showed distinct patterns with respect to

Table: Deaths, incidence, and DALYs for meningitis in 2016 and the percentage change of age-standardised rates by location 
 Article

www.thelancet.com/neurology   Vol 17   December 2018
proportion of burden by age (figure 2), rates by age 
(figure 3), and changes in age­standardised rates from 
1990 to 2016 (figure 4). In younger ages, meningococcal 
meningitis 
and 
other 
meningitis 
were 
the 
predominant cause categories in incident cases and 
deaths. Death rate and incidence increased, as did 
YLD rates, in the oldest age groups, with other 
meningitis and mening 
ococcal meningitis causing 
most of the burden in people 80 years and older. 
Global mortality decreased the most for meningococcal 
meningitis between 1990 and 2016 to the extent that, 
by 2016, the proportion of meningitis deaths in the 
other cause category (eg, due to Listeria, Staphylococcus, 
Gram­negative bacteria, fungal, and viral infections) 
was slightly higher in cause fraction to meningococcus. 
The time trend of incidence and YLDs was less stark. 
With decreasing incidence and YLD rates of 
H influenzae type b and pneumococcal meningitis, we 
estimated increasing rates of other meningitis, a 
trend that started around 2005. Although 54·0% 
(1·53 million [1·23–1·95]) of incident cases and 46·0% 
(146 322 [114 583–216 388]) of all deaths occurred in 
children younger than 5 years and risk of neurological 
disability was highest under 1 year of age, the 
accumulated disability burden was estimated to be 
highest in adolescents and young adults, with 
sequelae such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, vision 
impair 
ment, and motor impairment.
Increasing SDI was consistently associated with lower 
age­standardised DALY rates due to meningitis 
(figure 5). Sub­Saharan Africa, without exception, had 
higher 
than 
expected 
age­standardised 
rates 
of 
meningitis DALYs, along with the Caribbean, north 
Africa, and the Middle East. Central Asia, southeast 
Asia, and eastern Europe all had rates in the 1990s that 
were higher than expected but improved compared with 
expectation by 2016. East Asia, high­income Asia Pacific, 
Andean Latin America, and central Latin America were 
the only regions with age­standardised meningitis DALY 
rates that were consistently lower than expected on the 
basis of SDI.
5·8% (4·5–7·0) of total meningitis DALYs were 
attributable to low birthweight and short gestation in 
2016, with the highest rates of attributable DALYs 
occurring in the meningitis belt countries, Burundi, 
Malawi, Somalia, Zambia, and Afghanistan (appendix). 
All attributable burden was in neonates younger than 
28 days, as described in the methods section.

Discussion
Global mortality from meningitis has declined, but 
substantial disparities in geographical distribution and 
age groups persist. In 2016, nearly 0·6% of all­ages 
deaths and close to 3% of the total in children younger 
than 5 years were due to meningitis (figure 3A). The 
estimates indicate that, while most incident cases are 
now due to infections in the other meningitis category, 
meningococcal infections continue to be a major cause 
of meningitis mortality, and most long­term disability is 
due to the after­effects of pneumococcal infection. The 
peak age of incident meningitis is during the neonatal 
period, deaths are highest in children younger than 
5 years, and meningitis death rates are highest in many 
of the same locations where overall younger than 5 years 
mortality is highest.24 Rates of disability among survivors 
are highest in the youngest children, with a peak of 
prevalent disability therefore accumulating in adolescents 
and young adults.
On the one hand, the overall figures provided by 
GBD 2016 are encouraging. Age­standardised death rates 
due to meningitis are estimated to have dropped globally 
by 21·0% from 1990 to 2016. On the other hand, the 
corresponding figures for other vaccine­responsive and 
preventable pathogen­based diseases have declined (eg, 
measles by 93·0%, tetanus by 90·7%, and syndrome­based 
diseases such as diarrhoea due to rotavirus by 57·9%),18 
suggesting that progress in meningitis could be 
substantially faster. The need for accelerated action on 
meningitis across the globe was recognised in a high­level 
meeting in May, 2017, of more than 50 global experts, led 
by the Meningitis Research Foundation in collaboration 
with WHO, resulting in a commitment to formulate a 
global roadmap to defeat meningitis by 2030—a plan that 
required broad global commitments to strengthen systems 
for prevention, treatment, and surveillance.25
Vaccination is a successful intervention for preventing 
meningitis. H influenzae type b meningitis has historically 
been a common cause of childhood hearing loss and 
neurological disability, affecting 15%–30% of infected 
children, but widespread vaccination has virtually 
eliminated H influenzae type b in many high­income 
countries26 and has significantly reduced its incidence in 
many low­income countries.27 Widespread pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccination has also resulted in significant 
declines in invasive pneumococcal disease beyond the age 
groups targeted for vaccination, although post­licensure 
studies have detected an absence of efficacy against

serotype 3.28 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine generates 
herd protection by preventing nasopharyngeal carriage of 
bacteria targeted by the vaccine in people who are 
immunised, although corresponding increases in nasal 
carriage and infection by pneumococcal serotypes that are 
not covered has also been widely documented,29 suggesting 
that continued progress will require new and improved, 
higher­valency vaccines or vaccines that provide universal 
coverage against all pneumococcal strains.
Epidemics remain a persistent threat in the meningitis 
belt countries of sub­Saharan Africa. Six of the ten countries 
with the highest number of meningitis deaths are in the 
meningitis belt, where a high incidence of meningococcal 
meningitis in particular has been linked to climatic 
factors—low humidity, dry winds, and high levels of dust 
in the air.30 Mass vaccination for MenA with MenAfriVac 
across the belt led to steep declines in incidence of 
meningococcal meningitis, but epidemics due to MenC, 
MenW, MenX, and pneumococcus still occur. Nearly 
18 000 cases of MenC were reported in Niger and Nigeria 
in 2017, the largest recorded epidemic.17 As affordable 
MenC polysaccharide conjugate vaccines used to control 
epidemics are being phased out of production31 and 
the potential remains high for epidemics from other 
serogroups, development of an affordable multivalent 
meningococcal vaccine is needed for mass vaccination 
campaigns and introduction into routine vaccination 
schedules.
Meningitis burden continues to be highest in resource­
poor settings, which is not surprising given the con­
fluence of factors predisposing to infections, epidemics, 
and poor outcomes. The proportion of survivors 
experiencing neurological disability is also estimated to 
be higher in people living in low­resource settings,21 
owing to poorer access to acute syndromic care and fewer 
resources available for support of survivors with 
neurological sequelae. Even for people who can access 
services, out­of­pocket costs are the largest source of 
health expenditures in many low­income and middle­
income countries; meningitis can lead to catastrophic 
health expenditures for poor households, which can lead 
to delays in seeking treatment or failure to seek treatment 
at all.2,4,5,11,30
In many areas of the world, especially rural areas, the 
capacity to do traditional diagnostic assays such as culture 
or PCR on CSF or blood samples is limited or non­existent. 
Limitations in capacity can be especially problematic in 
places where other infections, such as cerebral malaria,32

are common and can lead to delayed or missed diagnosis 
of bacterial or viral meningitis with resulting mis 
classi­
fication of deaths and under­representation of meningitis 
burden.33,34 Additionally, diagnosis of meningitis in 
children, especially neonates, is difficult; the symptoms of 
meningitis in neonates are often subtle and mirror those 
seen in neonates with sepsis or other infections, resulting 
in potential under­reporting.35 Current assays also have 
important limitations: sensitivity to detect pathogens 
varies by pathogen; no assay is able to detect or characterise 
N meningitidis serogroup X; latex agglutination tests can be 
expensive and at times unreliable; and the widely used 
Pastorex agglutination test, although able to detect antigens 
from H influenzae type b, S pneumoniae, and N meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, Y, W, B, and group B Streptococcus, 
requires cold­chain storage.36 Country­specific regulations 
that allow only already overburdened medically­trained 
providers to do lumbar punctures should be reconsidered 
because such policies can delay needed care.37 Efforts 
should be made to enhance training for other providers to 
search comprehensively for the source of severe acute 
infections and do lumbar punctures as needed. To facilitate 
such a change in practice, development and deployment of 
an affordable, sensitive, and specific rapid diagnostic test 
for the main bacterial meningitis pathogens—one that 
does not require specialised laboratory equipment or 
refrigeration—is urgently needed.
Acceleration of declines in meningitis burden will 
require improved disease surveillance and more attention 
to the long­term implications and impairments for 
survivors. Enhanced national and regional surveillance 
would mean that countries can monitor meningitis 
locally and in turn improve the precision of global 
estimates. Although high­quality surveillance data are 
largely unavailable for most countries in sub­Saharan 
Africa,38 MenAfriNet is a counterpoint that can serve as a 
model for other countries. Comprising Mali, Niger, 
Burkina Faso, and Togo—four meningitis belt countries—
MenAfriNet is a network that began doing high­quality 
case­based surveillance after MenA vaccine introduction.39 
As MenAfriNet looks to expand, data sharing is crucial 
both to improve estimates and to show other countries 
how effective and accurate surveillance can be done. 
Improved awareness of the disease by populations and 
governments is also key, as is improved support for 
survivors and their families.29

meningitis estimates are available across all age groups.

WHO estimated only 141 deaths (95% CI 119–150) 
globally for meningitis in neonates younger than 28 
days, 45 064 deaths (35 854–54 523) in infants aged 
1–11 months, and 37 573 deaths (29 690–43 857) in 
children aged 1–4 years compared with GBD 2016, which 
estimated 8911 deaths (6074–12 348) in infants aged 
0–6 days, 10 157 deaths (7812–15 141) in infants aged 
7–27 days, 70 841 deaths (55 018–104 486) in infants 
aged 1–11 months, and 56 412 deaths (42 274–88 597) in 
children aged 1–4 years (see GBD Compare). The total 
number of all ages meningitis deaths estimated by 
WHO in 2016 (278 812 [226 461–323 217]), was also 
substantially lower than GBD 2016 (318 400 [95% UI 
265 218–408 705]), although cause fractions were in closer 
agreement (0·49% for WHO in 2016; 0·58% [95% UI 
 
0·48–0·75] for GBD 2016). Other publications reporting 
on meningitis epidemiology for particular pathogens or 
locations revealed some differences from the present 
analysis. First, in neonates, GBD 2016 estimated more 
meningococcus and less other meningitis than two 
studies that found most meningitis cases were due to 
group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli, along with 
Listeria (in the high­income setting) or S pneumonia and 
Klebsiella (in the low­income and middle­income 
setting).41,42 Second, combining mortality and non­fatal 
results to derive case­fatality ratios, GBD 2016 also 
estimated meningococcal meningitis to have a higher

sociodemographic development, as measured by the SDI. The average, or expected, rate of meningitis DALYs for a 
given level of SDI (black line) is calculated as the average meningitis DALY rate by age group, across all GBD 
estimation locations with that level of SDI. The observed values for each region for each year between 1990 and 
2016 were aggregated from country results (coloured points). All points above the black line had higher meningitis

expected at that level of SDI. DALY=disability-adjusted life-years. GBD=Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk

case­fatality rate than pneumococcal meningitis, a 
finding that contrasts with several studies that suggest 
lower case­fatality rate in meningococcal meningitis,43,44 
except occasionally in the setting of epidemics.45 These 
inconsistencies suggest that although case­fatality rate 
might be higher for meningococcal meningitis overall, 
case­fatality rate might vary by pathogen across specific 
age groups and geographic settings. It is important to 
note the comparatively high uncertainty of cause­specific 
meningitis estimates and to acknowledge the need to 
ensure all available evidence on mortality is used to 
inform non­fatal estimates and vice versa.
This study has several limitations. First, it shares the 
same limitations as the overall GBD 2016 study, which are 
detailed elsewhere.23,46–49 A major limitation is the relative 
paucity of data on distribution and severity of long­term 
sequelae in survivors, which for meningitis is especially 
notable given the high rates of neurological disability 
that can follow neonatal meningitis.50 Learning­related 
disabilities have not been included in GBD, potentially 
leading to burden underestimation in conditions such as 
meningitis. GBD criteria for risk­outcome pair criteria, 
which assess causal links from the perspective of risks 
rather than outcomes, are not ideal for assessing 
comparatively rare outcomes like meningitis. Second, 
cause­specific meningitis estimates have a high degree of 
uncertainty owing to a relative paucity of pathogen­specific 
data. Although surveillance data can be extremely variable 
in quality, comprehensiveness, and completeness, if 
methods could be developed to identify and incorporate 
high­quality surveillance data into GBD modelling, such 
data could further improve the temporal and geographical 
precision of overall and pathogen­specific estimates. Third, 
because GBD 2016 provides estimates for only three of the 
major bacterial causes of meningitis, important neonatal 
and infant pathogens, such as group B Streptococcus, 
Listeria, Staphylococcus, and E coli, are all grouped together; 
we aim to generate separate estimates for additional 
pathogens in future analyses. With release of a group B 
Streptococcus vaccine on the horizon, it will become crucial 
to obtain country­specific burden estimates to guide 
countries in planning and implementing vaccine strate­
gies.51 Meningitis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 
HIV­associated opportunistic infections were not included 
because GBD classifies them with the underlying diseases. 
Fourth, although SDI is a useful tool for exploring 
epidemiologic transition, it is incomplete because it does 
not capture important aspects of societal function, such as 
political stability, gender equity, urbanicity, technology 
penetrance, or infrastructure, which are important social 
determinants of health.
Meningitis burden remains unacceptably high in 2016, 
despite evidence that population­level vaccination 
campaigns can effectively prevent many causes of 
meningitis. Detailed country­specific meningitis burden 
estimates are crucial advocacy tools, empowering 
patients, caregivers, and civil society organisations to ask 
more from governments and funders to help target 
improved vaccination rates, to foster development of—
and improve access to—rapid diagnostic tests, and to 
ensure that appropriate antibiotics for the most common 
causes of meningitis are included in the list of essential 
medicines. High rates of meningitis disability shine a 
spotlight on the need to strengthen health systems to 
provide additional educational support, aids and therapy 
for vision and hearing problems, and adaptation of the 
built environment for those with mobility issues. The 
inclusion of reliable surveillance data as inputs into GBD 
modelling will improve future meningitis estimates and 
will help prevent more people from dying from or having 
to live with the sequelae of meningitis.
