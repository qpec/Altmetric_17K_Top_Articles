Sustained enjoyment of life and mortality at older ages:  
analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing
Paola Zaninotto, Jane Wardle, Andrew Steptoe
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To test whether the number of reports of enjoyment of 
life over a four year period is quantitatively associated 
with all cause mortality, and with death from 
cardiovascular disease and from other causes.
Design anD setting
Longitudinal observational population study using the 
English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), a 
nationally representative sample of older men and 
women living in England.
PartiCiPants
9365 men and women aged 50 years or older (mean 
63, standard deviation 9.3) at recruitment.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Time to death, based on mortality between the third 
phase of data collection (wave 3 in 2006) and March 
2013 (up to seven years). 
results
Subjective wellbeing with measures of enjoyment of 
life were assessed in 2002 (wave 1), 2004 (wave 2), 
and 2006 (wave 3). 2264 (24%) respondents reported 
no enjoyment of life on any assessment, with 1833 
(20%) reporting high enjoyment on one report of high 
enjoyment of life, 2063 (22%) on two reports, and 3205 
(34%) on all three occasions. 1310 deaths were 
recorded during follow-up. Mortality was inversely 
associated with the number of occasions on which 
participants reported high enjoyment of life. Compared 
with the no high enjoyment group, the hazard ratio for 
all cause mortality was 0.83 (95% confidence interval 
0.70 to 0.99) for two reports of enjoyment of life, and 
0.76 (0.64 to 0.89) for three reports, after adjustment 
for demographic factors, baseline health, mobility 
impairment, and depressive symptoms. The same 
association was observed after deaths occurring 
within two years of the third enjoyment measure were 
excluded (0.90 (0.85 to 0.95) for every additional 
report of enjoyment), and in the complete case 
analysis (0.90 (0.83 to 0.96)).
COnClusiOns
This is an observational study, so causal conclusions 
cannot be drawn. Nonetheless, the results add a new 
dimension to understanding the significance of 
subjective wellbeing for health outcomes by 
documenting the importance of sustained wellbeing 
over time.
Introduction
There is growing evidence that subjective wellbeing is 
associated with reduced risk of all cause mortality and 
the incidence of specific conditions such as coronary 
heart disease (CHD).1 
2  A meta-analysis of longitudinal 
observational studies published before 2008 indicated 
that greater wellbeing was associated with lower all 
cause mortality in initially healthy population cohorts 
(adjusted hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 
0.76 to 0.89), although there were indications of publi-
cation bias.3  Subsequently, several studies have docu-
mented protective associations between various 
measures of subjective wellbeing and mortality,4-10 
 
albeit with some exceptions.11  In an earlier analysis of 
the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), we 
found that a one-off assessment of a four item measure 
of enjoyment of life was associated with reduced mor-
tality over an average of 7
.3 years. This association was 
independent of demographic factors, baseline illness, 
depressive symptoms, and health behaviours such as 
smoking and physical activity.12 Associations were 
maintained after the exclusion of people who died 
within two years of assessment, arguing against reverse 
causality, or terminal decline leading to reduced enjoy-
ment of life and early mortality.
To date, studies have assessed subjective wellbeing 
on one occasion. But another aspect of exposure might 
be important, namely the duration of the experience. 
Evidence of time dependent exposure effects would 
increase confidence in a potential causal association. 
In the present analysis, we tested the notion that 
repeated reports over several years would have a stron-
ger association with mortality than a single occurrence. 
We used measures of enjoyment of life taken three 
times at two year intervals between 2002 and 2006, and 
analysed associations with mortality up to 2013, pre-
dicting that a temporal dose-response association 
would be apparent. We adjusted statistically for a wide 
range of demographic, health, functional, emotional, 
and behavioural confounders; used multiple imputa-
tion to account for item non-response and attrition 
throughout the study; and tested associations with all 
cause mortality, deaths from cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), and deaths from other causes.
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Subjective wellbeing (feelings of enjoyment and satisfaction with life) has been 
associated with greater longevity in longitudinal population studies
Previous studies have measured wellbeing on a single occasion, and the 
importance of sustained wellbeing is not known
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
In the present study, a dose-response association was seen between sustained 
positive wellbeing over several years and all cause mortality
These effects remained significant after adjusting statistically not only for 
demographic and health status, but also adjusting for physical functional 
impairment and depressive symptoms

Methods
Participants
The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) is a 
panel study of men and women aged 50 and older living 
in England.13 The study began in 2002 (first phase of 
data collection referred to as wave 1) with 11 391 individ-
uals who had previously taken part in the Health Survey 
for England. Comparisons of the sociodemographic 
characteristics of participants with national census 
data show that the sample is representative of the 
English population aged 50 and over. We excluded from 
the analysis proxy interviewees (n=330), those who did 
not provide a response to all items on the measure of 
enjoyment of life at wave 1 in 2002 (n=860), and those 
who had died between wave 1 and wave 3 of data collec-
tion in 2006 (n=836), resulting in an analytical sample 
of 9365. Participants were tracked for mortality from 
wave 3 of ELSA (2006) until March 2013, an average of 
6.5 years (maximum follow-up seven years), during 
which there were 1310 deaths. For sensitivity analyses, 
we used wave 1 as the baseline, so the maximum fol-
low-up was 11 years.
Measures
Enjoyment of life was indexed with four items from the 
CASP-19 quality of life instrument, as described previ-
ously.12 14 This was administered in waves 1 (2002), 2 
(2004) and 3 (2006). Each item (“I enjoy the things that I 
do”; “I enjoy being in the company of others”; “On bal-
ance, I look back on my life with a sense of happiness”; 
“I feel full of energy these days”) was assessed on a four 
point scale, from 0 (“never”) to 3 (“often”), and was sub-
sequently coded as 0 (“never or rarely”) and 1 (“some-
times and often”). The four binary items were summed 
to generate the number of items for which enjoyment 
was reported, with scores ranging from 0 to 4. 
We then generated a variable for enjoyment, defining 
no enjoyment as scores from 0 to 2, and high enjoyment 
if scores were 3 or 4 (meaning that the individual 
reported enjoyment on 3 or 4 of the items). Socioeco-
nomic status was indexed by total household wealth, 
including financial wealth (savings and investments), 
the value of any home and other property (less mort-
gage), the value of any business assets, and physical 
wealth such as artwork and jewellery, net of debt. Edu-
cation was based on the highest qualification achieved 
and categorised into lower (no qualifications), interme-
diate (qualifications below college degree level), and 
higher (college degree or higher). We also included 
information on age, sex, ethnicity (white European v 
other ethnicity), marital status (cohabiting or not with a 
partner), and employment status (in paid employment 
or not in paid employment). 
Baseline health was assessed with a combination of 
general and disease specific measures. Participants 
rated their health on a standard five point self-assess-
ment scale from excellent to poor15 ; ratings of fair or 
poor were categorised as impaired self-rated health. 
We also asked if participants had any longstanding 
illnesses, and if the illnesses limited their daily 
 
activities; responses were combined to form a 
 
dichotomous variable, classifying participants as 
having a limiting longstanding illness or not. Partici-
pants were asked whether they had been given a doc-
tor diagnosis of coronary heart disease, cancer, 
diabetes, stroke, arthritis, chronic lung disease 
(asthma, bronchitis, and chronic lung disease), and 
depression. Depressive symptoms were measured at 
baseline using the eight item Centre for Epidemio-
logic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and a score of 
at least 4 indicated elevated depressive  
symptoms.16 
We considered mobility to be impaired if participants 
reported difficulties with one or more of 10 items con-
cerning mobility or fine motor function (eg, climbing 
one flight of stairs without resting, picking up a small 
coin from a table), or impairment of one or more of six 
activities of daily living (eg, getting in or out of bed). 
Current smoking, vigorous or moderate activity at 
least once per week, and drinking alcohol at least 
daily at baseline were also recorded.
Mortality data were obtained from the National 
Health Service central data registry. We analysed data 
on all cause mortality until March 2013, together with 
deaths resulting from cardiovascular disease, as 
defined at chapter level by ICD-10 (international classi-
fication of diseases, 10th revision; myocardial infarc-
tion, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and 
other cardiovascular diseases), and deaths from 
non-cardiovascular causes.
statistical analysis
We generated a sustained enjoyment variable by sum-
ming the number of reports of high enjoyment of life 
between 2002 and 2006; scores could range from none 
to three reports for each individual. Having ascertained 
that the proportional hazards assumption had not been 
violated, Cox proportional hazards regression models 
were used to estimate hazard ratios of death and 95% 
confidence intervals in relation to number of reports of 
high enjoyment, with the reference group being those 
with no reports of high enjoyment on any occasion. Sur-
vival time was measured in months from date of inter-
view (wave 3 in main analyses and wave 1 in sensitivity 
analysis 3) to date of death, or to follow-up in March 
2013. 
Five models were tested in the analyses of all cause 
mortality. Model 1 was adjusted for age (categorised as 
50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years) and sex. Demo-
graphic factors (wealth, education, ethnicity, marital 
status, and employment status) were added in model 
2, while model 3 added baseline health indicators 
(poor self-rated health, limiting longstanding illness, 
cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, 
arthritis, and chronic lung disease, impaired mobility, 
and impaired activities of daily living) to model 1. In 
model 4,  
depressive illness and depressive symptoms 
were added to model 1 to establish whether associa-
tions between enjoyment of life and mortality were 
independent of negative emotional states. The fully 
adjusted analysis in model 5 was adjusted for all the 
variables mentioned above. Separate regression anal-
yses were carried out of non-cardiovascular deaths

and deaths from cardiovascular disease. In addition, 
we modelled enjoyment of life as a continuous score 
(0, 1, 2, 3) where the hazard ratios represent (in the last 
column of each table) a one report increase of enjoy-
ment of life.
Data on enjoyment of life and covariates at all waves 
were available for 5262 people. We imputed missing 
data due to attrition and item non-response using mul-
tiple imputation by chained equations, which included 
all variables (including the survival outcome) in the 
prediction model to generate 10 imputed datasets (each 
had a final n=9365). With imputations, all individuals in 
the initial sample had a measure of enjoyment at all 
three waves. In order to strengthen the missing at ran-
dom assumption, we included in the imputation model 
two auxiliary variables known to be predictive of 
non-response (year of Health Survey for England inter-
view, household size). Owing to the greater precision 
offered, we present the analyses from the imputed data-
sets in this paper.
We carried out four sensitivity analyses. Firstly, we 
ran our analysis on the complete case sample of 5262 
participants without any missing data across all waves. 
Secondly, we examined all permutations of the timing 
of enjoyment ratings, to investigate different patterns in 
the high enjoyment reports (eg, one wave was wave 1 
only, or wave 2 only or wave 3 only; two waves were 
waves 1 and 2, waves 2 and 3, or waves 1 and 3), and 
included deaths that occurred during the assessment of 
enjoyment of life (results available on request). Thirdly, 
we repeated the analyses excluding deaths that 
occurred within two years of the third assessment of 
enjoyment of life (deaths before 2008) as a check for 
reverse causality. Finally, to exclude the possibility of 
selection bias, we repeated the main analyses by 
including deaths that occurred between 2002 and 2006. 
All analyses were carried out with Stata version 14.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community.
Results
We found that 2264 (24%) participants reported no 
high levels of enjoyment of life on any occasion, with 
1833 (20%) having one, 2063 (22%) having two, and 
3205 (34%) having three reports of high enjoyment. 
The number of reports of high enjoyment of life was 
greater in women, and in participants who were mar-
ried or cohabiting, well educated, wealthier, younger, 
and currently employed (table 1). There was no asso-
ciation with white European ethnicity, although the 
proportion of non-white participants in ELSA is 
small. Baseline health profiles were more favourable 
in those who reported more sustained enjoyment of 
life, with better self-rated health; less limiting 
 
longstanding illness; fewer diagnoses of coronary 
heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, stroke, or chronic 
lung disease; and less impaired mobility and 
impaired activities of daily living. We also found 
associations with a history of depressive illness and 
current depressive symptoms.
There were 1310 deaths over the average 6.5 year fol-
low-up period, and the proportion people who died 
was 30% in those with no reports of high enjoyment of 
life, 23% in those with one report, 22% in those with 
two reports, and 25% in those with three reports. Cox 
regression confirmed that the number of reports of 
high enjoyment of life showed a graded inverse associ-
ation with mortality (table 2 ). Compared with no 
reports of high enjoyment, the hazard ratio adjusted 
for age and sex was 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.73 
to 1.03) for one report, 0.73 (0.62 to 0.87) for two, and 
0.60 (0.51 to 0.70) for three reports. The hazard ratio for 
every unit increase in reported enjoyment of life was 
0.84 (0.80 to 0.89). These associations were somewhat 
attenuated with adjustment for covariates, particularly 
pre-existing health issues (model 3). Nevertheless, in 
the final model including all covariates, the adjusted 
hazard ratio was 0.83 (0.70 to 0.99) for two reports of 
enjoyment and 0.76 (0.64 to 0.89) for three reports, and 
the hazard ratio for every additional report of high 
enjoyment of life was 0.91 (0.86 to 0.96). Additional 
variables that were independently associated with all 
cause mortality in the fully adjusted model included 
older age, male sex, lower wealth, not being in paid 
employment, poorer self-rated health, a baseline diag-
nosis of coronary heart disease, cancer, chronic lung 
disease, and impaired activities of daily living. Figure 1 
shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all cause 
mortality.
There were 410 deaths attributed to cardiovascular 
disease, and 905 non-cardiovascular deaths. The 
results for non-cardiovascular deaths were similar to 
those for all cause mortality (table 3 ), with a fully 
adjusted hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 
0.74 to 0.86) for every additional report of high enjoy-
ment of life. The pattern of results was weaker for car-
diovascular deaths, possibly because of the reduced 
power in this analysis (table 4).
The first sensitivity analysis limited the sample to 
participants with complete data (n=5262) instead of 
using the imputed datasets. The results led to similar 
conclusions as the main analysis, with a fully adjusted 
hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.83 to 
0.96) for every additional report of high enjoyment 
(table 5). The second sensitivity analysis explored 
whether different patterns of enjoyment over time were 
important in relation to mortality. Hazard ratios were 
comparable whether high enjoyment was reported on 
consecutive waves (eg, waves 1 and 2, or waves 2 and 3) 
or non-consecutive waves (eg, waves 1 and 3), and 
whether a single report of high enjoyment occurred on 
waves 1, 2, or 3 (results available on request).
Thirdly, we excluded deaths that occurred within 
two years of the third and final assessment of enjoy-
ment in 2006, leaving 1179 deaths between 2008 and 
 on 1 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

2013. Compared with individuals who experienced no 
episodes of high enjoyment of life, the fully adjusted 
hazard ratio was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 
0.86) among those experiencing three episodes, with 
a hazard of 0.90 (0.85 to 0.95) for every additional 
report of

sustained enjoyment of life was stronger than in the 
main analyses, with a hazard ratio of 0.73 (95% confi-
dence interval 0.70 to 0.76) for every additional report 
of high enjoyment.
discussion
Our results indicate that the maintenance of positive 
wellbeing over a four year period is systematically 
related to subsequent mortality. A graded effect was 
apparent, with progressively higher mortality among 
people with fewer reports of high enjoyment. In the 
fully adjusted model, the hazard was reduced by 17% 
among people giving two reports of high enjoyment of 
life, and by 24% in those giving three reports. Findings 
for all cause mortality were replicated in separate anal-
yses of deaths from causes other than cardiovascular 
disease, after adjusting for multiple demographic, 
health, and emotional factors. Associations also per-
sisted after deaths within two years of the last measure 
of enjoyment of life were excluded, arguing against 
reverse causality or the effect of terminal decline in 
wellbeing.17

states is important. Previous research has docu-
mented associations between intensity of positive 
wellbeing at a single measurement point and sur-
vival, but not how often wellbeing is experienced, and 
studies with repeated assessments of positive wellbe-
ing are rare.18 Our observation that multiple reports of 
high enjoyment of life show stronger associations 
with mortality than a single episode adds to the plau-
sibility that subjective wellbeing might causally influ-
ence health outcomes. Single reports of enjoyment of 
life could be affected by current circumstances or 
fleeting experiences, while persistent subjective well-
being might influence longer term determinants of 
health.
Secondly, we took account of a wide range of poten-
tial confounders in these analyses. Previous studies 
have included controls for demographics and baseline 
prevalence of serious illness,3 
4 
10 
19  but not disability or 
mobility impairment. Impaired mobility is an 
 
independent predictor of mortality,20  and is associated 
with reduced enjoyment of life.14  We also measured 
self-rated health and limiting longstanding illness as 
indicators of less tangible health problems that might 
confound associations between positive wellbeing and 
mortality, and assessments of depressive symptoms to 
account for the presence of negative affective states. An 
analysis of the Million Women Study showed no associ-
ation between a simple four point rating of frequency of 
happiness and survival, due in large part to a substan-
tial overlap of the happiness ratings with self-rated 
health.11  The number of reports of enjoyment was also 
associated with good self-rated health in the present 
study (table 1). Nevertheless, our observation that mul-
tiple reports of high enjoyment remained independent 
predictors of mortality when this and other factors had 
been included in the analytical models increases our 
confidence that associations are robust.
Thirdly, we have documented associations between 
sustained wellbeing and death from non-cardiovascu-
lar causes as well as all cause mortality. Previous work 
has documented links between lower subjective wellbe-
ing and cardiovascular disease incidence and longer 
survival.4 21 22 However, cardiovascular disease 
accounted for only around a third of deaths in this 
study, limiting statistical power to detect associations. 
The findings for deaths from non-cardiovascular causes 
suggest that subjective wellbeing has a more general 
association with survival.
This was an observational study, so we are not able to 
interpret the associations between enjoyment of life 
and survival as causal. Although we controlled for a 
wide range of potential confounders, other unmea-
sured factors could be important. Our assessment of 
initial health was not complete, even though we 
included general measures such as self-rated health as 
well as serious diagnosed conditions. A substantial pro-
portion of participants in ELSA did not complete all 
three assessments of enjoyment of life, either because 
they died during the four year measurement period or 
because they dropped out of the study temporarily or 
permanently. However, analyses of participants who 
completed all assessments showed results comparable 
to the multiply imputed datasets, indicating that attri-
tion during the measurement period does not explain 
our findings.
Subjective wellbeing has many facets, including 
hedonic wellbeing (feelings of happiness and joy), 
evaluative wellbeing (life satisfaction), and eude-
monic wellbeing (judgments about meaning and pur-
pose in life).23  Our measure of enjoyment of life

includes  
components of hedonic wellbeing, social 
engagement, and vitality, all of which might be 
important for sustained health.22  A limitation of this 
analysis was that we only assessed enjoyment of life 
every two years, and do not know whether it fluctuated 
between measurement points.18  We also do not know 
about the pattern of enjoyment of participants’ lives 
before they enrolled in the study. The proportion of 
ethnic minority participants in ELSA was very small, 
and our results might not generalise to other cultures. 
Baseline health status was measured by self-report, 
but this has been shown to be quite comparable with 
physician examination in studies of adults of compa-
rable age.24 25 In defining covariates, we relied on base-
line data rather than data from all three waves, 
because imputation of covariates at subsequent waves 
would increase uncertainty in multivariable adjusted 
effect estimates.
Mechanisms and implications
It is possible that the pattern of deaths results from 
reverse causality. Serious illness and terminal decline 
undoubtedly impair enjoyment of life, which could lead 
to an association between lack of enjoyment and mor-
tality.26 We therefore carried out a sensitivity analysis 
restricted to deaths at least two years after the last mea-
surement point, reasoning that if reverse causality was 
responsible, the mortality effect should be attenuated. 
The fact that the associations in this analysis were sim-
ilar to the main findings argues against reverse causal-
ity as a primary explanation.
If the findings do reflect causal processes, two broad 
sets of factors might be involved. Firstly, enjoyment of 
life might exert an influence through associations with 
healthy lifestyle. Physical activity, not smoking, and 
healthy diet have been related to positive wellbeing,27-29 
 
while healthcare and self-care behaviours (such as 
screening uptake, appropriate help seeking, and adher-
ence to medical advice) might also be relevant.30 Sus-
tained enjoyment of life over many years could be 
linked with healthier behavioural choices, promoting 
longevity.
Secondly, there could be direct biological correlates 
of positive wellbeing modulated through corticolimbic 
pathways that contribute to protective associations. 
Subjective wellbeing has been correlated with low con-
centrations of cortisol in everyday life,31  with low levels 
of inflammatory markers in some studies,32  and with 
changes in expression of genes regulating inflamma-
tion and antibody synthesis.33  Aspects of subjective 
wellbeing has been associated with reduced incident 
hypertension and cardiometabolic disease,34 35  slower 
decline in physical functional capacity,14  and better 
sleep,36 all of which might reduce risk of life threatening 
illness if sustained over time. These processes might 
contribute to a broad range of health outcomes.
Conclusions
These results add a new dimension to understanding 
the significance of subjective wellbeing for physical 
health outcomes by documenting a dose-response 
association with sustained wellbeing. This comple-
ments previous findings on wellbeing intensity, and 
demonstrating significant effects after controlling for a 
wide range of potential confounders. The findings high-
light the need to study biological and behavioural 
mediators in order to establish the mechanisms through 
which subjective wellbeing is associated with health 
outcomes.
