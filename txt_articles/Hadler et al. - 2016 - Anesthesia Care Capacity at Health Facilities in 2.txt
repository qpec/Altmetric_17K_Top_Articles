Abstract
Background—Globally, an estimated 2 billion people lack access to surgical and anesthesia 
care. We sought to pool results of anesthesia care capacity assessments in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) to identify patterns of deficits and provide useful targets for advocacy and 
intervention.
Methods—A systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and 
Google Scholar identified reports that documented anesthesia care capacity from LMICs. When 
multiple assessments from one country were identified, only the study with the most facilities 
assessed was included. Patterns of availability or deficit were described.
Results—We identified 22 LMICs (15 low- and 8 middle-income countries) with anesthesia care 
capacity assessments (614 facilities assessed). Anesthesia care resources were often unavailable, 
including relatively low-cost ones (e.g., oxygen and airway supplies). Capacity varied markedly 
between and within countries, regardless of the national income. The availability of fundamental

 resources for safe anesthesia, such as airway supplies and functional pulse oximeters, was often 
not reported (72 and 36 % of hospitals assessed, respectively). Anesthesia machines and the 
capability to perform general anesthesia were unavailable in 43 % (132/307 hospitals) and 56 % 
(202/361) of hospitals, respectively.
Conclusion—We identified a pattern of critical deficiencies in anesthesia care capacity in 
LMICs, including some low-cost, high-value added resources. The global health community 
should advocate for improvements in anesthesia care capacity and the potential benefits of doing 
so to health system planners. In addition, better quality data on anesthesia care capacity can 
improve advocacy, as well as the monitoring and evaluation of changes over time and the impact 
of capacity improvement interventions.
Introduction
Over the past decades, the global health community has begun to appreciate the large burden 
of conditions that require essential surgical and trauma care [1]. In response, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) created the Global Initiative for Essential and Emergency 
Surgical Care (GIEESC) to frame ways in which this burden might be addressed [2]. This 
initiative provided an outline for assessing, planning, and organizing surgical and anesthesia 
care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and became the impetus for a number of 
surgical and anesthesia care capacity assessments.
In 2008, poor-expenditure countries (i.e., countries that spend less than USD 100 on health 
care per capita per annum) accounted for only 3.5 % of the worldwide surgical caseload 
despite accounting for 35 % of the global population, suggesting significant unmet needs for 
surgical and anesthetic care [3]. Over the same time period, the WHO and World Federation 
of Societies of Anaesthesiologists developed a series of recommendations for anesthesia 
resource allocation by hospital type [4]. The availability of the resources discussed in these 
guidelines has not been assessed in a multi-country, income-stratified format, which can be 
used to identify specific patterns of good and poor availability of anesthesia resources.
To address this gap, and in lieu of better data, we pooled data from individual anesthesia 
care capacity assessments in LMICs to create an overall picture of the anesthesia care 
capacity worldwide. By doing so, the findings might highlight gaps in anesthesia resources 
and patterns of availability.
Methods
Search strategy
A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews, and Google Scholar. Keywords that represented ‘surgery’ and ‘anesthesia’ were 
combined with terms that represented ‘capacity’ and ‘assessment’ in a database-specific 
manner (Appendix).
We included all reports that assessed anesthesia care capacity in a LMIC published before 
June 1st, 2015. The World Bank’s World Development Report was used to define LMICs for

 the review. If multiple studies from a single country were found, only the study with the 
most facilities was included.
Assessment tools
Three assessment tools were used by retrieved reports: WHO Tool for Situational Analysis 
to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care; PIPES Surgical Assessment Tool; and the 
Harvard Humanitarian Initiative Assessment Tool.
The WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care 
was developed in 2007 by members of the GIEESC. [5, 6] It includes a 256-item 
questionnaire that assesses four areas: (i) infrastructure, (ii) human resources, (iii) types of 
surgical procedures performed, and (iv) available equipment.
The PIPES Surgical Assessment tool is a modification of the WHO tool that was designed to 
capture binary data based on the four WHO resource areas to improve both ease of analysis 
and comparison between countries [7]. PIPES is significantly shorter than the WHO tool 
(105 items), and excludes many of the explanatory questions clarifying why certain 
procedures were not performed in given hospitals. The PIPES tool has been validated in a 
number of countries; [8, 9] however, given the ubiquity of the WHO tool, we only used 
PIPES results when WHO results from the same country were not available (e.g., Nigeria, 
Sierra Leone).
Results from Guyana and Ethiopia were collected via a modified WHO survey developed by 
the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. [10, 11] Results from one country, Uganda, were 
gathered by a unique survey tool developed specifically for that country [12].
Data management
Three reviewers (RAH, MCM, and SSC) screened all reports; a third reviewer (ALK) 
evaluated the report if there was any disagreement. Two reviewers (RAH, SSC) 
independently extracted the data.
To determine the overall availability of anesthesia resources, we extracted assessment results 
from each report for a list of specific resources. In some cases, availability of resources was 
expressed in percentages and in some cases in raw numbers; to provide comparable results, 
we converted percentages into number of facilities assessed and calculated means based on 
the total number of resources available divided by hospitals assessed per resource.
Data analysis
Proportions of hospitals with each resource in each country assessment were pooled using a 
fixed-effect model with Stata v13 (StataCorp, TX, USA). Weights were applied based on the 
capacity assessment sample size. Confidence intervals were calculated with a binomial 
distribution. Estimates of heterogeneity were calculated from the inverse-variance fixed-
effect model. Significant intra-group heterogeneity was identified (i.e., I2 was >75 % with 
corresponding p values <0.05). To explore this further, we calculated pooled estimates by 
subgroup (i.e., low-income and middle-income countries) using a random effects model. 
Despite these efforts, the I2 measure demonstrated substantial intra-group and inter-group

 heterogeneity. Thus, pooled estimates are not reported. Instead, we present a narrative 
synthesis of the resources’ availability as per recommendations offered by The Cochrane 
Collaboration. [13]
Specifically, Forest plots without the pooled estimates are presented for electricity, oxygen 
supply, pulse oximeter, and anesthesia machine to demonstrate the variability of resource 
availability between assessments. A fixed continuity correction was added for assessments 
that had either no hospital with the resource available or all hospitals with the resource 
available to allow the use of nonnegative constants. The availability of these four resources 
that span the continuum of anesthesia care development give useful information about the 
respective national capacity more broadly. For these resources and the remainder of 
resources that were reported less frequently, percentages of hospitals with the available 
resource are provided in the text and are accompanied by the number of hospitals with the 
resource and the number of hospitals that had the resource assessed.
Results
Search results
The systematic search returned 82 records (Fig. 1). Of these, 11 (13 %) were duplicates and 
were removed. The remaining 71 records were screened for relevance. Thirty-five full-text 
reports were evaluated. After excluding reports without anesthesia care capacity assessment, 
22 reports were included (27 % of all records retrieved) that described anesthesia care 
capacity in 614 hospitals in 22 LMICs (Fig. 2). However, the number of and specific 
anesthesia resources reported per assessment varied markedly (median 7 resources, range 3–
10) (Table 1).
Infrastructure and equipment capacity
Only 50 % of hospitals assessed (234/467 hospitals) had consistent electricity. This ranged 
from no hospitals assessed in Sierra Leone to all hospitals assessed in Nicaragua and 
Ethiopia (Fig. 3). Sixty-one percent of hospitals had continuous supply of oxygen in the 
operating room (345/561 hospitals). Sierra Leone and Malawi reported that no hospital 
assessed had continuous oxygen supply (Fig. 4).
Although not reliably reported (12 countries), functional pulse oximeters were present in 
51 % of the hospitals assessed (201/394 hospitals), ranging from 12 % of hospitals in 
Tanzania to 100 % of hospitals in Guyana (Fig. 5). Similarly, only 13 countries reported 
functional anesthesia machine availability (Fig. 6). Of those, only 43 % of hospitals had at 
least one functioning anesthesia machine (132/307 hospitals).
Anesthesia capability
Of the 361 hospitals that reported capacity for anesthesia type (59 % of assessed hospitals), 
56 % (202 hospitals) reported having the capacity to perform general anesthesia, 66 % could 
provide spinal, and 57 % regional anesthesia.

 Only 327 hospitals reported capacity for anesthetic techniques more specifically. Of these, 
ketamine was the anesthetic most frequently employed (73 % of hospitals surveyed; 124/171 
hospitals).
Other anesthesia capabilities
Only 170 hospitals in Africa and Asia reported on surgical airway capabilities and other 
airway supplies. Of these, 22 % reported having equipment to perform a cricothyroidotomy 
(37/170 hospitals); 48 % (51/109) reported a consistent supply of adult endotracheal tubes; 
and 42 % reported a consistent supply of pediatric endotracheal tubes (71/170).
Discussion
Large deficiencies exist in anesthesia capacity in LMICs. Despite limitations in the reporting 
of data by various groups using various assessment tools, we described anesthesia care 
capacity in LMICs to document patterns in anesthesia resource deficiencies and consider 
ways in which they might be overcome. We documented generally low and variable 
availability of anesthesia resources both between and within countries. Between 30 and 
50 % of the hospitals surveyed reported not having continuous oxygen supply and/or 
continuous electricity. Around half of the hospitals had the resources and training required 
for definitive airway management and/or general anesthesia. Fewer still had functional 
anesthesia machines or pulse oximeters, and less than half reported consistent supply of 
basic equipment for airway management.
Many of the resources aforementioned are relatively low cost and provide significant added 
value to healthcare regardless of the context (e.g., airway supplies, oxygen, and electricity). 
Thus, health system planners should consider these resources as essential for the health of 
their population and prioritize their availability over more advanced equipment and supplies 
(e.g., anesthesia machines and advanced diagnostic imaging). Improving these resources 
might require dedicated financing streams, as have been done for HIV and maternal health, 
as well as improving the supply chain for non-drug consumables (e.g., airway supplies) [14]. 
Additionally, anesthesia training must be improved in concert with improvements in 
equipment and supply availability to avoid wasteful mismatch of human and physical 
resources [15]. Such initiatives might significantly improve the safety and availability of 
essential surgical care, which will have considerable benefits for population health [16].
Although the capacity assessments did not often describe the anesthesia workforce, other 
reports have documented insufficient numbers of adequately trained personnel who can 
provide safe anesthesia [17]. Thus, the paucity of anesthesia care capacity is even more 
striking when this is considered [18]. Many countries rely upon nurse anesthetists to provide 
safe anesthesia; however, anesthesia care in LMICs or in remote areas is often provided by 
technicians and/or nurses with highly variable on-the-job training [19–21]. With anesthesia 
care provided by an insufficient workforce who are equipped with less than a bare minimum 
of essential anesthesia resources, the safety of anesthesia care in LMICs is concerning and 
requires close evaluation. Efforts to do so could be improved by routine data collection of 
indicators (e.g., perioperative mortality rate and day of surgery mortality rate) and quality 
improvement programs (e.g., morbidity and mortality conferences and perioperative death

 reviews). Further, the availability of other standard monitors as defined in the American 
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Standards for Basic Anesthesia Monitoring [22], such as 
continuous electrocardiogram and capnographic monitoring, should be incorporated into 
future assessments of anesthesia care resource availability. Capacity assessments have 
proven useful if done serially to monitor changes over time or evaluate the impact of an 
intervention [23, 24].
Though useful in providing a snapshot of the magnitude of the problem, this study has 
multiple significant limitations. Most significant is the lack of consistently reported 
anesthesia care resources between reports, varying reporting mechanisms, and differences in 
overall methodologies (e.g., sampling strategy). In addition, only data from 22 countries 
were available. The data reported varied extensively between and within countries and 
various assessment tools were used. However, we were able to identify important patterns, 
such as the lack of electricity and oxygen, particularly in low-income countries. Also, a 
different survey team performed each assessment. While this may have resulted in some 
degree of unreliability within the survey responses, the tools have been validated for multi-
country use. Lastly, given the paucity of available data, different reporting schemes, and 
markedly varied results, we were unable to provide a pooled estimate.
Despite these limitations, the findings from this review allow reasonable conclusions to be 
drawn about the critical deficiencies in anesthesia resources in LMICs. Although one must 
be careful in extrapolating data, the results will not be surprising to those providing 
anesthesia in a LMIC who are in urgent need of improved infrastructure, equipment, and 
supplies. Future assessments targeted more specifically at the availability of anesthesia 
resources, anesthesia training, and anesthesia safety which are needed to further characterize 
anesthesia capacity in these settings. We hope that future studies will be more consistent in 
their reporting and allow for greater generalizability.
Conclusion
This review combined data from anesthesia capacity assessments in 22 LMICs with a goal 
of describing deficiencies and considering ways in which anesthesia capacity might be 
improved. We discovered that anesthesia resources are often not available when needed. 
However, detailed description and analysis of specific resources was not possible given the 
differences in assessments. As the importance of surgical and anesthesia in global health has 
been established, international organizations and individual countries must increase focus 
and funding directed toward the provision of safe perioperative care in LMICs. This should 
include the reliable provision of essential anesthesia resources, training of new and current 
anesthesia care providers, and monitoring and evaluation of anesthesia care.
