Background. The efficacy of ceftazidime-avibactam—a cephalosporin–β-lactamase inhibitor combination with in vitro activity 
against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase–producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)—compared with colistin 
remains unknown.
Methods. Patients initially treated with either ceftazidime-avibactam or colistin for CRE infections were selected from the 
Consortium on Resistance Against Carbapenems in Klebsiella and other Enterobacteriaceae (CRACKLE), a prospective, multicenter, 
observational study. Efficacy, safety, and benefit-risk analyses were performed using intent-to-treat analyses with partial credit and 
the desirability of outcome ranking approaches. The ordinal efficacy outcome was based on disposition at day 30 after starting treat-
ment (home vs not home but not observed to die in the hospital vs hospital death). All analyses were adjusted for confounding using 
inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).
Results. Thirty-eight patients were treated first with ceftazidime-avibactam and 99 with colistin. Most patients received add-
itional anti-CRE agents as part of their treatment. Bloodstream (n = 63; 46%) and respiratory (n = 30; 22%) infections were most 
common. In patients treated with ceftazidime-avibactam versus colistin, IPTW-adjusted all-cause hospital mortality 30 days after 
starting treatment was 9% versus 32%, respectively (difference, 23%; 95% bootstrap confidence interval, 9%–35%; P = .001). In an 
analysis of disposition at 30 days, patients treated with ceftazidime-avibactam, compared with those treated within colistin, had an 
IPTW-adjusted probability of a better outcome of 64% (95% confidence interval, 57%-71%). Partial credit analyses indicated uni-
form superiority of ceftazidime-avibactam to colistin.
Conclusions. Ceftazidime-avibactam may be a reasonable alternative to colistin in the treatment of K. pneumoniae carbapene-
mase–producing CRE infections. These findings require confirmation in a randomized controlled trial.
Keywords. carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae; Klebsiella pneumoniae; colistin; ceftazidime-avibactam; benefit-risk. 
The global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
(CRE) is an important threat to vulnerable patient popula-
tions worldwide [1–5]. Treatment options for CRE infections 
include polymyxins such as colistin and polymyxin B [6]. 
Concerns about polymyxins include toxicity, limited efficacy, 
dosing uncertainties and resistance, including worrisome mcr-
1–mediated resistance [7–9]. Recently, ceftazidime-avibactam 
was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration 
[10]. Avibactam is a non–β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor that 
has activity against Ambler class A and class D serine carbapen-
emases, including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) 
and OXA-48–like carbapenemases. In contrast, avibactam 
does not inhibit metallo-β-lactamase enzymes. Uncontrolled 
case series have shown variable outcomes in patients with CRE 
infections treated with ceftazidime-avibactam [11, 12]. Data 
comparing the use of ceftazidime-avibactam versus polymyxins 
in the treatment of CRE infections are limited.
The importance of patient-centered outcomes that go be-
yond mortality rates is increasingly recognized. Recently, several 
states of health were deemed by patients to be even worse than 
death, suggesting that patient-centered quality-of-life outcomes 
are important to measure [13]. Furthermore, when selecting 
an antibiotic strategy, issues of efficacy and safety should both

be considered. In the current study, we analyzed the outcomes 
in patients initially treated with ceftazidime-avibactam versus 
colistin for CRE infections. We evaluated combined benefits 
and risks to estimate patient-level differences between ceftazi-
dime-avibactam and colistin. The Consortium on Resistance 
Against Carbapenems in Klebsiella and Other Enterobacteriaceae 
(CRACKLE) study offered a unique opportunity to address these 
questions, because ceftazidime-avibactam was introduced into 
clinical practice while the study was ongoing.
METHODS
CRACKLE Study
CRACKLE is a prospective, observational study involving 
18 hospitals that are a part of 8 healthcare systems predomi-
nantly located in the Great Lakes region of the United States, 
as described elsewhere (see Supplementary Table S1 for rela-
tive contributions of each hospital) [14–16]. All hospitalized 
patients who have a culture from which CRE is isolated are 
included. From 24 December 2011 until 1 January 2015, only 
data on patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumo-
niae were collected. From 1 January 2015 onward, all patients 
with any CRE were included. Clinical data on these patients 
were entered into a central, standardized database. Data collec-
tion methods did not change during the study period.
Patients and Clinical Data
In the study period from 24 December 2011 to 1 May 2016, all 
patients who started ceftazidime-avibactam or colistin treat-
ment for a documented CRE infection were included (see 
Supplementary Table S2 for colistin dosing recommendations 
in place during the study period). Seven patients who started 
both colistin and ceftazidime-avibactam within a 24-hour win-
dow were excluded (See Supplementary Table S3). Standardized 
a priori definitions of infections were used, as described else-
where [14]. Patients whose culture episode did not meet criteria 
for infection were excluded. 
Patients with bacteremia were analyzed as such regardless of 
the primary source. Each patient was included once at the time of 
the most recent treated CRE infection. The Pitt bacteremia score 
based on the day of the index culture was calculated, and patients 
with a score ≥4 were considered critically ill [17]. The Charlson 
comorbidity index was determined at admission [18]. Renal fail-
ure was defined as a serum creatinine level ≥2 mg/dL and/or the 
use of renal replacement therapy. The study was approved by the 
institutional review boards of all study sites. Because CRACKLE 
is an observational study, treatment of CRE infections was at 
the discretion of the treating physician. Only patients who were 
treated with colistin or ceftazidime-avibactam were included in 
the study. Before the approval date of ceftazidime-avibactam, 81 
patients (82% of the total colistin-first cohort) were included in 
the colistin-first group. After the approval date, an additional 
18 patients (18% of the total colistin-first cohort) were included 
in the colistin-first group. Of note, no significant difference in 
unadjusted 30-day mortality was observed between these 2 
groups (25 of 81 [31%] vs 8 of 18 [44%]; P = .28).
Microbiology
Guidelines from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards 
Institute were used to define CRE [19]. Bacterial identifica-
tion and routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing was per-
formed with MicroScan (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) or 
Vitek2 (bioMerieux), supplemented by GN4F Sensititre tray 
(Thermo Fisher) or Etest (bioMerieux), as indicated. On avail-
able isolates, detection of carbapenemase genes and repetitive 
extragenic palindromic (rep)–polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
strain typing was performed as described elsewhere [14]. Briefly, 
PCR amplification of blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, and blaOXA-48 
genes was conducted using established primers and methods; 
amplicons were sequenced at a commercial sequencing facil-
ity (MCLAB), and analyzed [20, 21]. rep-PCR was performed 
using the DiversiLab Strain typing system (Bacterial BarCodes; 
bioMerieux). Isolates with ≥ 95% similarity were considered of 
the same rep-PCR type.
Statistical Methods
Intention-to-treat analyses were used to compare strategies of 
initiating ceftazidime-avibactam versus colistin for the initial 
treatment of CRE infection, in the presence of routine add-
itional clinical care and consequential downstream adjustments 
to therapy. There were 3 analysis foci: efficacy, safety, and ben-
efit-risk. Efficacy analyses were conducted using the efficacy 
analysis set (n = 137). Safety and benefit-risk analyses were 
conducted using the safety/benefit-risk analysis set consisting 
of the patients in the efficacy analysis without renal failure at 
treatment initiation (n = 72), because patients with renal fail-
ure at treatment initiation were not at risk for the major safety 
outcome of incident renal failure. 
Analyses focused on ordinal outcomes (Table 1) constructed 
from benefits and harms experienced during the “patient 
journey” that have an important impact on patients. Ordinal

 AColistin vs Ceftazidime-Avibactam in CRE Infections • CID 2018:66 (15 January) • 165
outcomes have pragmatic advantages compared with separate 
analyses of the different outcomes [22]. Adjustment for con-
founding by indication was performed using inverse probability 
of treatment weighting (IPTW) [23, 24]. Covariates included 
in the model for the decision between ceftazidime-avibactam 
and colistin were Pitt score (dichotomized as <4 or ≥4), type 
of infection (bloodstream infection vs urinary tract infection 
vs other), and (in the main sensitivity analysis) creatinine level 
≥2 mg/dL at the time of first positive culture.
The primary efficacy analysis was an IPTW-adjusted dispos-
ition plot displaying the probability of disposition outcomes over 
time. The probability of hospital mortality in the first 30 days 
was compared between treatment groups adjusting for potential 
confounding by indication through IPTW. This analysis relies on 
correct specification of the treatment initiation model. In a sen-
sitivity analysis, the primary outcome was evaluated by using the 
standardized risks, conditioning on the same confounders using 
a logistic regression model for the probabilities of the different 
outcome categories. This sensitivity analysis relies on correct 
specification of the logistic regression models for the outcomes 
in both treatment groups. In another sensitivity analysis for the 
primary outcome, we added Charlson score, age, and race to the 
list of confounders in the treatment initiation model.
Efficacy, safety, and benefit-risk were also analyzed using the 
desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR), resulting in estimates 
of the probability that a randomly selected patient initially 
treated with ceftazidime-avibactam would have a better overall 
outcome than a randomly selected patient initially treated with 
colistin (with half credit given for tied ranks) [22, 25]. Estimates 
were adjusted using IPTW.
The ordinal outcomes for safety and benefit-risk were also 
analyzed using the partial credit strategy, which provides a 
score of 1 (100%) to the most desirable category of the ordi-
nal outcome, 0 (0%) to the least desirable, and partial credit 
to the intermediate categories [26]. For safety, the following 
scoring was implemented: the category “not observed to die, 
no renal failure” was scored as 1, the category “not observed 
to die, with renal failure” was given a partial credit of x, and 
the category “died in the hospital” was scored as 0. Analyses 
display the contrast between ceftazidime-avibactam and 
colistin as x varies, allowing for personalized patient-clini-
cian team decision making. 
For the benefit-risk analysis, the following scoring was imple-
mented: the category “died in the hospital” was scored as 0; the 
category “alive in the hospital or discharged not to home with 
renal failure” was given a partial credit of x1, with 0 ≤ x1 ≤ 1; the 
category “alive in the hospital or discharged not to home with-
out renal failure” was given a partial credit of x2 with x1 ≤ x2 ≤1; 
and the category “discharged home” was scored as 1. Analyses 
display the contrast between ceftazidime-avibactam and colis-
tin as x1 and x2 vary. Estimates were adjusted using IPTW. The 
nonparametric bootstrap with 5000 replicates was implemented 
to obtain all confidence intervals (CIs) using Efron’s percentile 
method, and CIs were inverted to obtain P values.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
During the study period, 137 patients within the CRACKLE 
study met criteria for CRE infection and started on treatment 
with ceftazidime-avibactam or colistin. Of the 137 patients, 38 
(28%) received ceftazidime-avibactam first, and 99 (72%) colis-
tin first. The baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 
2 (IPTW-adjusted characteristics are in Supplementary Table 
S4). Patients tended to be both chronically and acutely ill, with 
a median Charlson comorbidity score of 3 (interquartile range 
[IQR], 1–5) and a median Pitt bacteremia score of 4 (2–6).
Almost half of patients (n = 63; 46%) presented with 
CRE bloodstream infection (sources are summarized in 
Supplementary Table S5). Other common infection types 
included respiratory tract infections in 30 patient (22%) 
and urinary tract infection in 19 (14%) (Table 2). Almost all 
patients (n = 133; 97%) were infected with K. pneumoniae; the 
other 4 (3%) were infected with Enterobacter spp. A total of 98 
CRE isolates were tested to determine colistin susceptibility. 
Patients treated first with ceftazidime-avibactam were less likely 
to have colistin-susceptible isolates (23 of 30; 77% of tested) 
than patients treated with colistin first (63 of 68; 93% of tested; 
P = .04). Of the 24 isolates on which ceftazidime-avibactam 
susceptibility testing was performed, 23 (96%) were reported 
as susceptible. The single isolate that tested resistant was in the 
ceftazidime-avibactam–first treatment group. In 54 carbapen-
em-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, the presence or absence of 
carbapenemase genes was tested; 28 (52%) and 24 (44%) were 
positive for blaKPC-2 and blaKPC-3, respectively. In 2 of 54 iso-
lates (4%), no carbapenemase genes were found. None of the 
tested isolates was positive for blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, or blaOXA-48. 
ST258A (18 of 54; 33%) and ST258B (23 of 54; 43%) were the 
most commonly encountered clades of carbapenem-resistant 
K. pneumoniae.
Efficacy, Safety, and Benefit-Risk
Efficacy
Efficacy was evaluated using the efficacy analysis set (n = 137). 
All-cause in-hospital mortality 30 days after the start of treat-
ment was 3 of 38 (8%) in the ceftazidime-avibactam group 
versus 33 of 99 (33%) in the colistin group. After IPTW adjust-
ment, the estimated adjusted percentages were 9% and 32%, 
respectively, resulting in a difference of 23% (95% CI, 9%–35%; 
P = .001; Table 3). Figure 1 displays the IPTW-adjusted dis-
position over time for patients initially treated with ceftazi-
dime-avibactam (Figure 1A) versus those initially treated with 
colistin (Figure 1B). Patients treated with ceftazidime-avibac-
tam were less likely to die and more likely to be discharged 
home during the first 30 days after starting treatment. DOOR

analyses indicated that the IPTW-adjusted probability of a bet-
ter outcome on ceftazidime-avibactam compared with colistin 
is 64% (95% CI, 57%–71%; Table 3).
Safety
Safety was evaluated using the safety/benefit-risk analysis set 
 
(n = 72; 26 initially treated with ceftazidime-avibactam and 46 ini-
tially treated with colistin; see Supplementary Table S6 for IPTW-
adjusted characteristics), which excludes the patients with renal 
failure at treatment initiation, that is, those not at risk for incident 
renal failure. Figure 2 displays the IPTW-adjusted safety outcome 
over time for patients initially treated with ceftazidime-avibac-
tam (Figure 2A) versus those initially treated with colistin (Figure 
2B). The IPTW-adjusted estimates for (1) hospital death, (2) not 
observed to die with incident renal failure, and (3) not observed to 
die without incident renal failure were 9%, 5%, and 86% for ceftazi-
dime-avibactam, respectively, and 25%, 13%, and 62% for colis-
tin (Table 3). DOOR analyses indicated that the IPTW-adjusted

 AColistin vs Ceftazidime-Avibactam in CRE Infections • CID 2018:66 (15 January) • 167
probability of a better outcome with ceftazidime-avibactam than 
with colistin is 62% (95% CI, 52%– 72%; Table 3).
The estimated IPTW-adjusted between-treatment difference 
(ceftazidime-avibactam minus colistin) in mean scores (and 
associated 95% CIs) is displayed as a function of the partial 
credit assigned to those not observed to die with renal failure in 
Figure 3A. Analyses are based on patients without renal failure 
at treatment initiation. Being not observed to die without renal 
failure is assigned a credit of 1 and hospital death a credit of 
0. Partial credit for being not observed to die with renal failure 
is assigned x (on the horizontal axis), with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. Results are 
plotted as the partial credit x varies to allow visualization of the 
impact on the estimated treatment effect. 
Positive differences indicate favorable results for cef-
tazidime-avibactam. For example, point A assigns a partial 
credit of 1 to patients not observed to die with renal fail-
ure, implying that renal failure is irrelevant and only survival 
matters, resulting in an estimated difference of 0.16 (95% 
CI, −.02 to .32), equivalent to a binary end point of hospital 
death. As another extreme example, point B assigns a partial 
credit of 0 to patients not observed to die with renal fail-
ure implying that incident renal failure is as poor an out-
come as death, resulting in an estimated difference of 0.24 
(95% CI, .04–.43). This is equivalent to a binary end point of 
not observed to die without renal failure. Point C assigns a 
partial credit of 0.8 (selected by the authors) to patients not 
observed to die with renal failure, resulting in an estimated 
difference of 0.18 (95% CI, 0–.34).
Benefit-Risk Analysis
Benefit-risk was evaluated using the safety/benefit-risk ana-
lysis set (n = 72). The IPTW-adjusted estimates for (1) hospital 
death, (2) alive in the hospital or discharged not to home with 
incident renal failure, (3) alive in the hospital or discharged 
not to home without incident renal failure, and (4) discharged 
home were 9%, 5%, 65%, and 20% for ceftazidime-avibactam 
respectively, and 25%, 11%, 56%, and 8% for colistin (Table 3). 
DOOR analyses indicated that the IPTW-adjusted probability 
of a better outcome with ceftazidime-avibactam than with colis-
tin is 64% (95% CI, 53%–75%; Table 3).
The estimated between-treatment difference (ceftazi-
dime-avibactam minus colistin) is displayed as a function of 
the partial credits assigned to (1) being alive in the hospital 
or discharged not to home with incident renal failure and (2) 
alive in the hospital or discharged not to home without inci-
dent renal failure, in Figure 3B. Estimates are adjusted using 
IPTW. Analyses are based on patients without renal failure at 
treatment initiation. Hospital death is assigned a credit of 0, and 
being discharged home a credit of 1. Partial credit is given for 
(1) being alive in the hospital or discharged not to home with

incident renal failure (x1, with 0 ≤ x1 ≤ 1) and (2) being alive in 
the hospital or discharged not to home without incident renal 
failure (x2, with x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1). Results are plotted as partial credits 
vary to allow visualization of the impact on the estimated treat-
ment effect. 
Positive differences indicate favorable results for ceftazi-
dime-avibactam. For example, point A in Figure 3B is the 
extreme example of both x1 and x2 being assigned a partial 
credit of 1. This is equivalent to analysis of a hospital death 
resulting in an estimated difference of 0.16 (95% CI, −.02 
to .32). Point B is another extreme example of both x1 and 
x2 being assigned a partial credit of 0. This is equivalent to 
analysis of being discharged home resulting in an estimated 
difference of 0.13 (95% CI, −.04 to .31]). Point C is another 
extreme example where x1 is assigned a partial credit of 0 and 
x2 a partial credit of 1. This is equivalent to analysis of a bin-
ary end point (being discharged home or alive in hospital or 
discharged not to home without incident renal failure versus 
other), resulting in an estimated difference of 0.22 (95% CI, 
.02–.41). As an example of a value judgment in which both 
disposition and development of renal failure are thought to be 
important, point D on the graph indicates assigned values of 
0.6 for x1 and 0.8 for x2, resulting in an estimated difference of 
0.17 (95% CI, .02–.30).
Antimicrobial Treatment
Anti-CRE directed treatment characteristics are outlined in 
Table 4 and Supplementary Table S7. The median time from 
collection of the index culture until starting ceftazidime-avibac-
tam or colistin was similar in the 2 groups: 3 (IQR, 2–4) versus 
2 (1–4) days, respectively, in the ceftazidime-avibactam and 
colistin groups (P = .22). The median durations of treatment 
were also similar: 10 (IQR, 5–26) versus 10 (4–18) days, respec-
tively. The use of other antibiotics directed against CRE was 
common and included tigecycline (n = 72; 53%), aminoglyco-
sides (n = 60; 44%), and carbapenems (n = 70; 51%), among

others (Table 4). Of note, fewer patients (n = 24; 63%) in the 
ceftazidime-avibactam–first group received additional CRE-
active antibiotics than in the colistin-first group (n = 93; 94%), 
P < .001. One patient in the ceftazidime-avibactam–first group 
received colistin later and 5 patients in the colistin-first group 
received ceftazidime-avibactam later in their treatment course.
DISCUSSION
We compared the use of colistin versus ceftazidime-avibactam in 
the treatment of CRE infections. Clinical outcomes were better 
in the patients who were treated first with ceftazidime-avibactam 
rather than colistin. Specifically, all-cause 30-day hospital mor-
tality was substantially decreased in the ceftazidime-avibactam 
group. A previous recent report of 3 cases of CRE bloodstream 
infection treated with ceftazidime-avibactam similarly reported 
good outcomes in these patients [11]. A larger retrospective study 
of 37 patients with CRE infections reported a 30-day survival of 
76%, and clinical success in 59% [12]. However, of concern was 
the observed resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam that occurred 
in 3 of 10 patients with microbiologic failure [12]. In addition to

minus colistin) in mean scores and associated 95% confidence bands, as a function of the partial credit assigned to those not observed to die with renal failure (more details 
in Section 5.25–5.45). B, Benefit-risk: estimated between-treatment difference (ceftazidime-avibactam minus colistin) in mean scores as a function of the partial credits 
assigned to those alive in the hospital or discharged not to home, with or without incident renal failure (more details in Section 5.85–6.45).

treatment-emergent resistance, another important unanswered 
question is the impact of combination therapy in CRE infec-
tions when ceftazidime-avibactam is used. In the INCREMENT 
study, which did not include any patients treated with ceftazi-
dime-avibactam, combination therapy tended to have the most 
benefit in more severely ill patients [27]. However, whether the 
same effect will be observed in patients treated with regimens 
containing ceftazidime-avibactam is unclear. In our cohort, cef-
tazidime-avibactam was used as monotherapy in 37% of patients.
Based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ceftazi-
dime-avibactam was recently approved for complicated urinary 
tract infection and complicated intra-abdominal infections 
[10]. Another trial focused on ceftazidime-resistant pathogens 
in an open-label comparison with best-available therapy [28]. 
Nonetheless, an important unanswered question is how cef-
tazidime-avibactam performs overall in the treatment of CRE 
infections. Ideally, this question will be answered through an 
RCT. Unfortunately, results from any potential CRE-specific 
RCT are not imminently expected for ceftazidime-avibactam, 
although several carbapenem-resistant pathogen-specific RCT 
evaluating other novel therapeutic agents with in vitro activity 
against CRE are currently ongoing; examples include studies 
involving imipenem-relebactam (NCT02452047), meropen-
em-vaborbactam (NCT02168946), and cefiderocol (S-649266, 
NCT02714595).
The introduction of ceftazidime-avibactam during the study 
period of CRACKLE posed a unique opportunity to compare 
outcomes in patients treated with ceftazidime-avibactam versus 
colistin. Although important sources of bias remained, all data 
were collected in the same standardized, prospective manner. The 
relatively short study period decreases the likelihood that support-
ive, nonantibiotic treatment measures changed dramatically over 
the course of this study. For these reasons, this observational study 
represents a reasonable opportunity to inform the medical commu-
nity about the relative efficacy and toxicity of ceftazidime-avibac-
tam compared with colistin, while awaiting definitive RCT data.
Novel statistical methods such as DOOR and partial credit 
analyses were applied using ordinal outcomes. Ordinal outcomes 
allow for a more synthesized evaluation of benefits and harms, 
providing information on the overall effects on patients align-
ing with needs of clinicians when making treatment decisions 
and the priorities of patients. This is in contrast to segmented 
evaluation of treatment effects on outcomes where associations 
between component outcomes can be missed and competing 
risks can confound interpretation. This is particularly important 
when treatments have toxic effects that affect patient function 
and quality of life. Partial credit analyses allow for individual 
patient-clinician teams to apply their own values or preferences 
(ie, their own partial credit) regarding outcomes to obtain per-
sonalized estimates of treatment effects to guide decisions. Here, 
we observed that for all possible values of partial credit, ceftazi-
dime-avibactam performed better than colistin. However, we 
included only disposition and renal failure in these analyses. 
Other potential adverse events associated with antibiotics, such 
as Clostridium difficile infection, rash, or hypersensitivity reac-
tions, should be included in future studies.
Our study has several limitations. First, it was an observa-
tional study in which treatment was not randomly assigned. 
Confounding by indication is therefore a potential issue [29]. 
We have addressed this issue by applying IPTW. However, 
any confounding adjustment method can adjust only for 
measured variables and relies on correct specification of the 
adjustment models. Unmeasured variables associated with 
the outcomes of interest may have been unevenly distributed 
between patient groups, and, given the available sample, we 
could not adjust for all measured potential confounders. An 
indicator of lack of randomization of treatment allocation is 
the higher proportion of colistin-resistant CRE in the ceftazi-
dime-avibactam group. Nonetheless, sensitivity analyses led 
to findings very similar to the ones presented here. Second, 
detailed data on dosing of colistin were not available for these 
patients. It is possible that the observed differences may in 
part be a consequence of relative underdosing of colistin. 
Third, the number of patients included in this study is rela-
tively small. Nonetheless, this is the largest comparative study 
to date to address this question.
In summary, we report here evidence for superiority of cef-
tazidime-avibactam over colistin in the initial treatment of 
infections caused by K. pneumoniae carbapenemase–produc-
ing CRE. The use of ceftazidime-avibactam was associated with 
improved clinical outcomes, especially decreased all-cause hos-
pital mortality rate and improved benefit-risk outcomes.
