IMPORTANCE Genes may work by modulating the way individuals respond to environmental
variation, and these discrete and differential genes vs environmental interactions may not be
readily captured in simple association studies.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether children carrying the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene
living under adverse economic conditions have worse-than-average fat intake compared with
those living in a healthy environment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from an established prospective birth cohort
(Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability, and Neurodevelopment) were used to study 4-year-old
children from Montreal, Quebec, Canada and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A total of 190
children (94 girls and 96 boys) had height and weight measured and complete food diaries
and were therefore eligible for the study. The study is derived from a birth cohort started in
June 2003 and still ongoing. The last age of follow-up was at 6 years.
EXPOSURES Social environment was characterized based on the gross family income, and
DNA was genotyped for the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fat intake.
RESULTS The 5 steps to distinguish the differential susceptibility from other types of
interaction were followed, and the study confirms that differential susceptibility is a relevant
model to address the association between the 7-repeat allele of DRD4 and food choices in
girls. Of the 190 children, 112 did not have the DRD4 7-repeat allele and 78 did. Baseline
characteristics did not differ in these 2 groups. Although not different in several confounders,
such as maternal educational level, maternal smoking during gestation, birth weight, and
breastfeeding duration, girls carrying the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene and living in
adverse socioeconomic conditions have increased fat intake compared with girls who are
noncarriers (DRD4 7+ mean, 33.95% of calories derived from fat; 95% CI, 28.76%-39.13%;
DRD4 7− mean, 28.76%; 95% CI, 26.77%-30.83%). However, girls carrying the 7-repeat allele
of the same gene and living in better socioeconomic conditions have decreased fat intake
compared with noncarriers (DRD4 7+ mean, 29.03% of calories derived from fat; 95% CI,
26.69%-31.51%; DRD4 7− mean, 31.88%; 95% CI, 30.28%-33.58%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Alleles previously considered to be obesity risk alleles might
in fact function as plasticity alleles, determining openness to environmental modification
and/or intervention, as seen in the girls in this study. This finding has important implications
for obesity prevention and social pediatrics.

G
enome-wide association studies1,2 have been success-
ful in identifying several genes associated with obe-
sity. However, genes may work by modulating the way
individuals respond to environmental variation, and these dis-
crete and differential genes vs environmental interactions may
not be readily captured in simple association studies. In ad-
dition, to date, most of these studies focused on body mass
index (not food intake or energy expenditure) as the out-
come, which may not be informative in terms of identifying
vulnerability and proposing preventive measures.
The differential susceptibility hypothesis3,4 suggests an al-
ternativeapproachtogeneticassociationstudiesthatmayhave
particular utility for common, complex diseases, such as obe-
sity. From an evolutionary perspective, the genetic differen-
tial susceptibility hypothesis proposes that, as a form of bet-
hedging against an uncertain future, natural selection has
maintained genes for both conditional (shaped by the envi-
ronment) and alternative (fixed) health strategies.5 In other
words, individual variations in the magnitude of biological re-
sponses regulate openness or susceptibility to environmen-
tal influences, ranging from particularly harmful under unfa-
vorable conditions to especially responsive to favorable
environments.4
Research on the differential susceptibility hypothesis has
thusfaralmostexclusivelyfocusedonsocioemotionalandcog-
nitive-developmental outcomes, indicating that plasticity
genes vary in relation to how much carriers (compared with
noncarriers) are negatively affected by environmental ad-
verse events6,7 and how much they benefit from support.3,4,8,9
A recent study10 found an association between the social en-
vironment and telomere length, moderated by genetic varia-
tion within the serotonin and dopamine pathways. Of inter-
est, at the same time that dopamine-related genes form one
of the main groups of genes that influence neurocognitive out-
comes, they also underlie motivated behaviors and decision-
making processes, which are known to be involved in eating
choices.

Methods
Weuseddatafromanestablishedprospectivebirthcohort(Ma-
ternal Adversity, Vulnerability, and Neurodevelopment Study
[MAVAN]).16,17 The study sample included 4-year-old children
fromMontreal,Quebec,Canada,andHamilton,Ontario,Canada.
Children came to the laboratory for various food-related mea-
sures and had their standing height, without shoes, measured
(tothenearest0.1cm)withastadiometer(PE-AIM-101;Perspec-
tive Enterprises). Body weight, with participants in light cloth-
ing,wasmeasured(tothenearest0.1kg)withadigitalfloorscale
(TanitaBodyFatMonitorBF-625;Tanita).Bodymassindexwas
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared.
Approval for the MAVAN project was obtained from ob-
stetricianswhoperformeddeliveriesatthestudyhospitalsand
by the ethics committees and university affiliates (McGill Uni-
versity and Université de Montréal, the Royal Victoria Hospi-
tal, Jewish General Hospital, Centre hospitalier de l’
Université
de Montréal, and Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemount) and St
Joseph’
s Hospital and McMaster University, Hamilton,
Ontario, Canada. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
A total of 190 children (94 girls and 96 boys) had com-
plete food frequency questionnaires for analysis, valid for the
local population.18 The study is derived from a birth cohort
started in 2003 and still ongoing. The last age of follow-up was
at 6 years. On the basis of these questionnaires, the quantita-
tive analysis of total caloric and macronutrient intake is de-
rived using NutriBase software, version NB7 (CyberSoft Inc).
In this data analysis, we studied the percentage of calories de-
rived from fat reported on the questionnaires. The social en-
vironment was characterized based on the gross family in-
come, categorized according to the low income cutoff Index
(LICO)19 into below or above the LICO.
Saliva samples were collected, and genotyping of the DNA
was performed masked to the children’
s behavior and pheno-
type. The 48–base pair variable number of tandem repeats re-
gion in the third exon of DRD4 was amplified with poly-
merase chain reaction techniques with primers and conditions
previouslydescribed.20Statisticalanalysisofthebaselinechar-
acteristics was performed using the t test for continuous data
and the χ2 test for categorical variables.
The genetic model was driven by the biological function
because the 7-repeat allele is markedly hypofunctional rela-
tive to all other alleles. Thus, it is presence or absence of this
allele that affects the phenotype (dominant model).21 On the
basis of the genotype (7-repeat allele present or absent) and
the income categories (above or below LICO), analysis of co-
variance was performed adjusting for body mass index as a co-
variate. The χ2 test of interaction and association between the
genotypeandincomewasalsoperformed.Totestforthespeci-
ficity of the model, we also repeated the analysis using differ-
ent susceptibility factors, such as low birth weight, maternal
Key Points
Question: Does the 7-repeat allele of DRD4 that is associated with
maladaptive eating exhibit differential susceptibility effects under
adverse vs healthy environments?
Findings: The study confirms that the differential susceptibility is a
relevant model to address the association between the 7-repeat
allele of DRD4 and food choices in girls.
Meaning: The results underscore the possibility of going beyond
the one-size-fits-all approach to childhood obesity prevention and
moving toward better targeted approaches that focus on
populations that are particularly genetically vulnerable to a
disadvantaged social environment and more responsive to
interventions that foster more favorable conditions.

centage of protein consumed). Data were analyzed using SPSS

Results
Children with or without the 7-repeat genotype did not differ
in many confounders (Table), such as maternal educational
level, maternal smoking during gestation, birth weight, and
breastfeeding duration. However, girls carrying the 7-repeat
allele of the DRD4 gene and living in adverse socioeconomic
conditions have increased fat intake compared with girls who
arenoncarriers(DRD47+mean,33.95%ofcaloriesderivedfrom
fat; 95% CI, 28.76%-39.13%; DRD4 7− mean, 28.76%; 95% CI,
26.77%-30.83%). Girls carrying the 7-repeat allele of the same
gene and living in better socioeconomic conditions have de-
creased fat intake compared with noncarriers (DRD4 7+ mean,
29.03% of calories derived from fat; 95% CI, 26.69%-31.51%;
DRD4 7− mean, 31.88%; 95% CI, 30.28%-33.58%).
To test our hypothesis, we followed the model proposed
by Belsky et al.11 According to this model, there are 5 steps to
distinguishing true differential susceptibility from other types
of interaction.24 Step 1 consists of the application of conven-
tional statistical criteria for evaluating genuine moderation
(crossover interaction). In our data, an initial 3-way analysis
of variance revealed an interaction among sex, DRD4 geno-
type, and income on fat intake (for those raised in poorer con-
ditions: boys: DRD4 7+ mean, 776.82 calories derived from fat;
95% CI, 536.38-1017.26; DRD4 7− mean, 709.59; 95% CI,
453.64-965.54; girls: DRD4 7+ mean, 973.42 calories derived
from fat, 95% CI, 538.7-1408.1; DRD4 7− mean, 624.34; 95%
CI, 519.34-729.34; for those raised in better conditions: boys:
DRD47+mean,647.21caloriesderivedfromfat;95%CI,555.27-
739.15; DRD4 7− mean, 595.82; 95% CI, 527.00-664.64; girls:
DRD47+mean,548.1caloriesderivedfromfat;95%CI,476.29-
619.85; DRD4 7− mean, 647.40; 95% CI, 574.95-719.86;
(P = .01). Following up on this analysis, we see that although
no effect is seen in boys (P = .78), there is an interaction be-
tweentheDRD4genotypeandtheincomecategories(P = .005)
on the percentage of intake of calories derived from fat in girls
(Figure 1).
In step 2, the aim is to distinguish differential susceptibil-
ity from other gene-environment correlations that may reflect
rearing experiences evoked by the genotypes to show that the
susceptibility factor (income) and the predictor (DRD4 geno-
type) are independent. Indeed, in our data, a nonsignificant χ2
at P = .58 demonstrates that these variables are independent.
In step 3, a test of the association between the suscepti-
bility factor and the outcome should be performed; if the as-
sociation is nonzero, there is no support for differential sus-
ceptibility. In our findings, the Phi and Cramer’
s V tests are
equal to 0, supporting the differential susceptibility.
Step 4 is a comparison of the regression plot with the pro-
totypical graphic representing differential susceptibility. As
seen in Figure 2, the plot from the preliminary data is similar
to the prototypical graphic representing differential
susceptibility.11
Finally, in step 5, the specificity of the model should be
tested by replacing susceptibility factors and outcomes. In-
deed, changing the susceptibility factor to being born with in-
trauterinegrowthrestriction(interactionP = .18),amotherwho
smoked during gestation (interaction P = .77), or a mother re-
portinglowparentalbonding(interactionP = .93),cannotelicit
the differential susceptibility findings regarding DRD4 geno-
type and fat intake. Changing the outcome to consumption of
sugars (interaction P = .35) or percentage of calories derived
from protein (interaction P = .46) similarly does not elicit the
differential susceptibility findings regarding DRD4 genotype,
suggesting that the differential susceptibility model for DRD4
genotypes (7+ or 7−) and income variation on the percentage
of fat consumed at 4 years of age in girls is specific.
Discussion
The 5 steps proposed by Belsky et al11 to distinguish the dif-
ferentialsusceptibilityfromothertypesofinteractionwerefol-
lowed, and the study confirms that the differential suscepti-
bility is a relevant model to address the association between

words, the previously considered obesity risk alleles might in

more impactful and better targeted intervention to improve
developmental and health outcomes to the individuals who
are also the most vulnerable. We focused on the DRD4 poly-
morphism for the association of this gene variant with obe-
sity risk, which has been extensively studied by our
group,13,14,25 and for the evidence that DRD4 could function
as a plasticity gene in neurocognitive outcomes.8,26 Further
studies may explore the effect of other dopamine polymor-
phisms in these aspects.
Of interest, the effect is exclusively found in girls. The
reported gene vs environment interaction could be adap-
tively more important for females, especially considering
reproductive strategies in adverse environments. Alterna-
tively, it is possible that at this age the effect is not seen in
boys because growth in general and specifically the adipos-
ity rebound occur at different ages according to sex,27 and
these events influence appetite.28,29 The sex-specific neu-
rodevelopmental course or adaptive strategy could make
girls more prone to show systematically greater biological
sensitivity at different ages and to a variety of social con-
texts. Finally, considering the literature reporting differ-
ences in the brain processing and behavioral responses to
feelings of hunger and satiation,30,31 as well as food
preferences,32 in females vs males, such gene vs environ-
mental interactions may as well be sex specific, especially at
this age.33,34 Another study35 reported sex differences in the
differential susceptibility findings. Although future research
is needed to elicit further genetic differential susceptibility
in both sexes, the present results of maladaptive eating in
girls before obesity has taken place may inform obesity pre-
vention and primary pediatric care.
Our study has some limitations, such as the sample size;
these results should be replicated in larger samples. In addi-
tion, our study was performed in a country where there is not
a large variation in terms of socioeconomic status. Replica-
tion in places of extreme socioeconomic inequalities will be
informative.
There are large disparities in the nutritional quality of the
food environment between individuals and neighborhoods
from low and high socioeconomic statuses. Food-related mar-
keting activities,36 convenience stores,37 and fast-food outlet
availability near schools38 are more prevalent in neighbor-
hoods with low compared with high socioeconomic statuses.
Considering that poor diet and obesity are critical risk factors
fordiabetesmellitus,cardiovasculardisease,andotherchronic
diseases that make up the greatest share of health care
expenses,39 this may render ever more pressing the recom-
mendation for society to prioritize human capital investment
in fighting poverty earlier rather than later in life.40

Conclusions
The results of this study underscore the possibility of
going beyond the present one-size-fits-all approach to
childhood obesity prevention and moving toward better
targeted approaches that focus on populations that are
particularly genetically vulnerable to disadvantaged social
environments and more responsive to interventions
that foster more favorable conditions, be they environ-
mental or individual. Efforts have been made to test this
possibility and find support for the genetic moderation of
intervention efficacy in a manner consistent with the dif-
ferential susceptibility concept.41,42 By studying socio-
economic status within a framework that accounts for the
complex interplay among human brain, biology, and soci-
ety, we hope to inform rational and targeted design of
intervention.
