Chronic Sinusitis and Risk of Head and Neck Cancer
in the US Elderly Population
Daniel C. Beachler, PhD, MHS; Eric A. Engels, MD, MPH
A
cute sinusitis is a common inflammatory condition of-
ten caused by viral or bacterial infections. The condi-
tion is considered chronic when the episode persists
longerthan12weeks.Chronicsinusitiscanbeattributedtovari-
ous infectious or noninfectious agents.1 Individuals with
chronic sinusitis may have an increased risk of head and neck
cancer (HNC) due to local inflammatory damage caused by si-
nusitis. Alternatively, sinusitis may be a marker of a local im-
munodeficiency. Thus, whereas the infectious agents that
cause sinusitis are unlikely to directly induce cell transforma-
tion, individuals with chronic sinusitis may be prone to other
chronic oncogenic viruses. For example, sinusitis may mark
an increased susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which
can cause nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC); and oral human
papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause oropharyngeal
cancer (HPV-OPC).
Whereas the risk of most cancer types among people with
chronic sinusitis has not been extensively examined, 2 recent
studies from Taiwan observed a more than 2-fold higher risk
of NPC in individuals with chronic sinusitis.2,3 In addition, a
recent cross-sectional study found that women with self-
reported chronic sinusitis were 3 times more likely to have an
oral HPV infection, even after adjusting for tobacco use and
sexual behavior.4 To our knowledge, associations between
IMPORTANCE Chronic sinusitis may be involved in the etiology of certain head and neck
cancers (HNCs), due to immunodeficiency or inflammation. However, the risk of specific
HNCs among people with chronic sinusitis is largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the associations of chronic sinusitis with subsequent HNC, including
nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), human papillomavirus–related oropharyngeal cancer
(HPV-OPC), and nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancer (NCPSC), in an elderly US population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER)-Medicare database to conduct a case-cohort study of US individuals aged 65
years or older during 2004 through 2011. The study included 483 546 Medicare beneficiaries
from SEER areas in a 5% random subcohort, and 826 436 from the entire source population
who developed cancer (including 21 716 with HNC).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of HNCs including NPC, HPV-OPC, and NCPSC.
RESULTS Most individuals were female (57.7%), and the mean (SD) age at entry was 72.6
(8.0) years. Chronic sinusitis was associated with risk of developing HNC (adjusted hazard
ratio [aHR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.27-1.48), particularly NPC (aHR, 3.71; 95% CI, 2.75-5.02), HPV-OPC
(aHR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57), and NCPSC (aHR, 5.49; 95% CI, 4.56-6.62). Most of this
increased risk was limited to risk within 1 year of the chronic sinusitis diagnosis, as
associations were largely attenuated 1 year or more after chronic sinusitis (NPC: aHR, 1.60;
95% CI, 0.96-2.65; HPV-OPC: aHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.86-1.32; NCPSC: aHR, 2.47; 95% CI,
1.84-3.31). All 3 HNC subtypes had cumulative incidence of less than 0.07% 8 years after
chronic sinusitis diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Chronic sinusitis is associated with certain HNCs, particularly
NPC and NCPSC. These HNCs are rare, and most of the increased HNC risk is limited to within
1 year of chronic sinusitis diagnosis, consistent with surveillance or detection bias. The
associations were weaker over longer intervals, suggesting at most a modest role for
sinusitis-related inflammation and/or immunodeficiency.

chronic sinusitis and HPV-OPC (or most other cancers) have
not been assessed longitudinally. If immunosuppression re-
lated to sinusitis plays an etiologic role, HNCs may be ex-
pectedtooccuryearsafterindicationsofchronicsinusitis,given
that cancers develop many years after EBV or HPV acquisi-
tion and persistence. Distinguishing between short-term and
long-term associations is important because a number of ar-
tifacts are likely to induce short-term associations between
chronic sinusitis and HNCs, whereas longer-term associa-
tions may better reflect the chronic effects of sinusitis related
to inflammation or immunosuppression.
Therefore, we examined the risks of HNCs in individuals
with and without chronic sinusitis using the Surveillance, Epi-
demiology,andEndResults(SEER)-Medicarelinkeddatabase.5,6
SEER-Medicare is a large longitudinal database of US individu-
als older than 65 years, a group of interest because more than
40% of HNC diagnoses occur after age 65 years.7 The inclusion
of cancer registry data in SEER-Medicare provides the ability to
evaluate uncommon cancer outcomes.
Methods
Study Population and Design
This study used the SEER-Medicare database, which links US
Medicare claims with data from SEER cancer registries.6
Medicare is a government insurance program that provides
hospital, medical, and surgical benefits for almost all US citi-
zens aged 65 years or older.5 SEER is composed of 18 cancer
registries that cover roughly 28% of the US population and has
reliable and detailed ascertainment of cancer diagnoses.5,6,8
ThisstudyusesdeidentifieddataprovidedintheNationalCan-
cer Institute’
s SEER-Medicare database. The National Insti-
tute of Health’
s Office of Human Subjects Research Protec-
tionsconsidersthisresearchnottoinvolvehumansubjectsand
that it is therefore exempt from human subjects review.
This study’
s source population comprised approximately
9.4 million Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older and
living in SEER areas between 2004 and 2011. The SEER-
Medicare database includes Medicare claims data for 100% of
cancer cases in this source population, identified by SEER, as
well as a random 5% sample of the entire source population.
We used these data to conduct a case-cohort study,9 which
maximally uses the available data as described previously.10,11
Exposure and Outcome Definitions
Chronic sinusitis was identified using International Classifi-
cationofDiseases,9thRevision,ClinicalModification(ICD-9-CM)
diagnosis codes 473.0 to 473.9 in hospital, physician, and out-
patient claims. We required at least 1 hospital or 2 physician
or outpatient claims at least 30 days apart to define chronic si-
nusitis to increase the measure’
s positive predictive value.
Other procedures or medical conditions of interest were de-
fined using the following ICD-9-CM and Current Procedural
Terminology, 4th Edition (CPT-4), codes: nasal/sinus endos-
copy (CPT-4: 31231-31297, 31299), otitis media (ICD-9-CM:
381.X, or 382.X), tonsillitis (ICD-9-CM: 463, 474.00, or 474.02),
and pharyngitis (ICD-9-CM: 462, 472.1).
Cancers were categorized by anatomic site using the SEER
site recode variable. We identified HPV-OPCs by using the fol-
lowing ICD-Oncology (version 3) topographic codes: base of
tongue(C01.9),tonsil(C02.4,C09.0-9.9),ororopharynx(C10.0,
10.2-10.9, 14.0, 14.2).12 Recent estimates suggest that
roughly 70% of these OPCs are HPV positive, although HPV
prevalence may be modestly lower in older adults with OPC.13
We categorized cancers of the nasal cavity, accessory si-
nuses, and middle ear as nasal cavity and paranasal sinus can-
cers (NCPSCs: C30.0, 30.1, 31.0-31.9), and NPCs were selected
using nasopharynx codes (C11.0-11.9). Based on limited evi-
dence, roughly 80% of NPCs are attributable to EBV in low-
incidence areas such as the United States.14 We also exam-
ined overall cancer, the 5 most common individual cancers in
the United States, and other cancers with an infectious and/or
immune-related etiology (cervix, anus, liver, stomach, non-
Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL, including lymphocytic leukemia],
Hodgkin lymphoma [HL], and Kaposi sarcoma).
Statistical Analyses
Characteristics of individuals in the 5% subcohort, with and
withoutchronicsinusitisduring2004through2011,werecom-
pared using χ2 tests and t tests. Follow-up time for these analy-
ses started at the latest of the following: an individual’
s 65th
birthday; January 1, 2004; first date living in a SEER area; start
of cancer registry coverage; beginning of Medicare part A and
B coverage outside of a health maintenance organization (be-
cause health maintenance organizations do not provide claims
to Medicare); and the first Medicare claim. Chronic sinusitis
was evaluated as a time-dependent exposure, as we updated
the chronic sinusitis status if a person developed chronic si-
nusitis during follow-up. However, once an individual re-
ceived a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis, he or she was consid-
ered “exposed” for the rest of follow-up. Individuals were
followed up until they developed a cancer of interest, mi-
gratedoutofaSEERarea,discontinuedMedicarePartsA/Bcov-
erage or entered a health maintenance organization, died, or
survived through the end of follow-up on December 31, 2011.
We considered risk for overall and specific types of HNC,
along with cancer overall and other individual cancer types.
In our analysis of overall cancer risk, we counted only a per-
son’
s first cancer diagnosis during follow-up. People who had
a cancer diagnosed prior to the start of follow-up were in-
cluded in this analysis because they were still at risk for other
Key Points
Question Is chronic sinusitis involved in the etiology of head and
neck cancer?
Findings This study of SEER-Medicare data found that chronic
sinusitis was associated with subsequent nasopharyngeal cancer,
human papillomavirus–related oropharyngeal cancer, and nasal
cavity and paranasal sinus cancer, but the strength of these
associations became attenuated with longer follow-up time.
Meaning Sinusitis-related inflammation and/or
immunodeficiency may contribute to the etiology of head and
neck cancer, but this effect is at most modest.

cancer types. However, in analyses for specific cancer types,
individuals with the cancer of interest diagnosed prior to base-
line were excluded, and the remaining individuals were fol-
lowed for each specific cancer type without censoring for other
types of cancer.
Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression
(SURVEYPHREG procedure, SAS 9.3) was used to estimate
hazard ratios (HRs) assessing the association between
chronic sinusitis and cancer risk. The weights incorporated
the case-cohort sampling fractions (ie, weight = 1 for cancer
cases because 100% were sampled, and weight = 20 for
cancer-free individuals in the subcohort because 5% were
sampled).15 Regression models were adjusted for age at study
entry, sex, race, and calendar year at start of follow-up.
The relationship between chronic sinusitis and HNC risk
may be prone to surveillance bias (ie, people with sinusitis may
be evaluated closely for other related conditions, leading to a
diagnosis of cancer), reverse causation (ie, an early HNC could
cause sinusitis), or HNC symptoms may be initially misdiag-
nosed as sinusitis. These potential biases could increase the
association of sinusitis and HNC over short time intervals.
Therefore, we assessed Cox models in which HRs were esti-
mated for different intervals following chronic sinusitis diag-
nosis.Wecategorizedtimeintolessthan1yearor1yearormore
after chronic sinusitis diagnosis, and divided follow-up at least
1yearafterchronicsinusitisintoperiods1to2years,2to3years,
or 3 to 8 years after chronic sinusitis in further analyses. We
also conducted sensitivity analyses examining the risk of cer-
tainHNCs(NPC,HPV-OPC,andNCPSC)amongindividualswith
other upper airway conditions (otitis media, pharyngitis, and
tonsillitis), and among individuals who received a nasal
endoscopy at or after their diagnosis of chronic sinusitis.
Cumulative incidence curves were used to depict the ab-
solute risk of subtypes of HNC among individuals with chronic
sinusitis, as a function of time since chronic sinusitis diagno-
sis. The cumulative incidence analyses accounted for compet-
ing risks of death,10,16(pp1-8) and all analyses used a 2-sided α
of .05 for significance.

cases of cancer (ie, cases both within and outside the 5%
subcohort),including21 716HNCs(eFigureintheSupplement).
Chronic Sinusitis and Risk of HNC
Risk of HNC was modestly elevated among individuals with
prior chronic sinusitis compared with people without chronic
sinusitis in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses (adjusted
HR [aHR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.27-1.48) (Table 2). Chronic sinusitis
was specifically associated with infection-related HNCs: NPC
(aHR, 3.71; 95% CI, 2.75-5.02) and HPV-OPC (aHR, 1.33; 95%
CI, 1.13-1.57), and some non–infection-related HNCs, includ-
ingNCPSC(aHR,5.49;95%CI,4.56-6.62)andlarynx(aHR,1.54;
95%CI,1.35-1.76).OtherHNCsincludinglip,tongue,andmouth
cancer were not associated with chronic sinusitis (Table 2).
We further examined 3 HNC types of interest (NPC, HPV-
OPC, and NCPSC) given our a priori hypotheses and/or their
strong associations in adjusted analyses (Table 3). The asso-
ciations with these 3 cancers were largely driven by associa-
tions within 1 year following chronic sinusitis diagnosis
(Table 3). Specifically, incidence of both NPC and HPV-OPCs
were significantly increased in the 1-year period after chronic
sinusitis diagnosis (NPC: aHR, 8.88; 95% CI, 6.30-12.50; OPC:
aHR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.56-2.53), but not 1 or more years after
chronic sinusitis diagnosis (NPC: aHR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.96-
2.65; HPV-OPC: aHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.86-1.32). There was also
a stronger association for NCPSC when restricted to less than
1 year compared with more than 1 year after chronic sinusitis
diagnosis(<1year:aHR,12.53;95%CI,10.15-15.48;≥1year:aHR,
2.47; 95% CI, 1.84-3.31).
The cumulative incidence of NPC, HPV-OPC, and NCPSC
among people with chronic sinusitis is shown in the Figure.
Within 1 year after chronic sinusitis diagnosis, approximately
0.01% of individuals had a diagnosis of NPC; 0.02%, HPV-OPC;

and 0.03%, NCPSC. Thereafter, each of these cancers devel-
oped at a rate of less than 0.02% per year, and the cumulative
incidence of each was less than 0.07% after 8 years of fol-
low-up (Figure).
Additional Analyses
In additional analyses, we examined the risk of the 3 selected
HNC subtypes among individuals who received a nasal endos-
copy at the time of or after their chronic sinusitis diagnosis.
Results were similar to the main results, although the asso-
ciations were particularly stronger for NCPSC (aHR, 11.39; 95%
CI, 8.29-15.66) (eTable in the Supplement). With respect to
other upper airway conditions, otitis media was significantly
associated with an increased risk of HPV-OPC, NCPSC, and par-
ticularly NPC (aHR, 11.96; 95% CI, 9.46-15.12), whereas phar-
yngitis and tonsillitis were significantly associated only with
an increased risk of HPV-OPC (eTable in the Supplement).
We also examined associations between chronic sinusitis
and other cancers. The risk of any cancer type was 8% higher
in people with chronic sinusitis than in individuals without
chronic sinusitis (aHR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10). The most com-
mon cancers were not strongly associated with chronic sinus-
itis (aHRs between 1.14 and 0.86) (Table 2), although the posi-
tiveassociationswithlungandprostatecancersandtheinverse
association with colorectal cancer were statistically signifi-
cant (Table 2). Cancers with an infectious and/or immune-
related etiology were not positively associated with chronic
sinusitis, except for NHL (aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.26-1.39) and HL
(aHR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.26-2.00).
Discussion
In this large longitudinal population-based study, chronic
sinusitis was strongly associated with certain HNCs, particu-
larly NPC and NCPSC. In addition, this is the first study to sug-
gest that chronic sinusitis is modestly associated with subse-
quent risk of HPV-OPC. Much of the increased risk for these
cancers was limited to a short time interval after chronic
sinusitis diagnosis (ie, the elevation was greatest within 1 year
following the diagnosis of chronic sinusitis). In contrast, the
associationsoverlongerintervalswereweaker,suggestingthat
sinusitis-related inflammation and/or immunodeficiency play,
at most, a minor role in the development of these cancers.

The HNC type with the strongest association with chronic
sinusitis was NCPSC, which is not known to have an infection-
related etiology. Notably, we found that most of the in-
creased risk for NCPSC (as well as for NPC and HPV-OPC) ap-
pears to occur within 1 year of diagnosis of chronic sinusitis,
which may reflect several artifacts. For example, an indi-
vidual who receives a chronic sinusitis diagnosis may be more
likely to undergo medical evaluation of the head and neck, in-
cluding diagnostic imaging, which would increase the prob-
abilityofidentifyinganindolentHNCtumor(surveillancebias).
It is also possible that an undiagnosed HNC could be initially
misdiagnosed as chronic sinusitis or cause chronic sinusitis
(reversecausation).Symptomssuchasnasalobstructionand/or
congestion, rhinorrhea, and facial pressure commonly occur
in both chronic sinusitis and HNC. Patients with HNC might
receive a diagnosis of and be treated provisionally for sinus-
itispriortoundergoingimagingtoidentifytheneoplasm,given
the higher incidence of chronic sinusitis. These artifacts would
be most likely to explain HNCs diagnosed soon after chronic
sinusitis. For NCPSC (but not for the other HNCs), we still ob-
served a significant association up to 3 years after chronic
sinusitis diagnosis. One possibility is that chronic sinusitis,
especially if present over an extended period, could induce

immunodeficiency syndromes, such as low IgG or IgA levels,17
and they may respond inadequately to vaccination against
pneumococcal infection.18 These observations suggest that
chronic sinusitis may be a marker of an immunodeficiency. If
so, the potential effect of an immunodeficiency would be ex-
pected to become evident years after the diagnosis of chronic
sinusitis, particularly for infection-related HNCs, which de-
velop decades after HPV or EBV acquisition and persistence.
Because our study found only modest and nonsignificant as-
sociationswiththeinfection-relatedHNCs(HPV-OPCandNPC)
over intervals longer than 1 year, our results suggest that si-
nusitis-related inflammation and immunodeficiency does not
play a large role in promoting the early or intermediate carci-
nogenic stages of infection-related HNC.
The association that we observed between chronic sinus-
itis and NPC in this study is similar to that reported in 2
recent studies from Taiwan.2,3 However, both Taiwanese stud-
ies found an association between chronic sinusitis and NPC
over intervals longer than 1 year. Our study suggests that there
could be a modestly elevated NPC risk more than 1 year after
chronic sinusitis, but the risk was not significant (aHR, 1.60;
95% CI, 0.96-2.65). Some geographic factors could explain
thesedifferences.AsiancountriessuchasTaiwanhaveahigher
incidence of NPC than seen in the United States.19 Further-
more, NPCs in Asia may be more strongly linked to EBV infec-
tionthanNPCsintheUnitedStates,14andchronicsinusitismay
have a stronger effect on EBV-related cases.
We found similar associations between chronic sinusitis
and the selected HNCs among individuals who received a na-
sal endoscopy at the time of or after their chronic sinusitis di-
agnosis. Nasal endoscopies are often performed on patients
withpersistentchronicsinusitistoconfirmtheirdiagnosis,and
the presence of claims for this procedure thus should reduce
misclassification of chronic sinusitis. Conversely, because na-
sal endoscopy would facilitate a diagnosis of HNC, the strong
associationscouldreflecttheaforementionedsurveillancebias.
In addition to chronic sinusitis, we found that other up-
per airway conditions were associated with elevated risk of
HNCs. Otitis media was associated with all 3 examined HNC
subtypes, while pharyngitis and tonsillitis were only associ-
ated with HPV-OPC. These associations are prone to and may
reflect similar biases (such as surveillance bias) as seen for
chronic sinusitis. Otitis media in particular was most strongly
associated with NPC; this association could be due to reverse
causation, as NPCs can impinge on the middle ear.
Wealsoexaminedtheassociationsofchronicsinusitiswith
common cancers and other cancers known to have an infec-
tion and/or immune-related etiology. Chronic sinusitis was not
stronglyassociatedwithanycommoncancertype,althoughwe
observed modest positive associations with lung and prostate
cancer and an inverse association with colon cancer. We were
abletoobservetheseassociationsgiventhelargesampleofthis
study, and these weak associations could be attributable to
multiple factors including confounding by smoking. While
chronicsinusitiswasnotassociatedwitheveryinfectionand/or
immune-related cancer, it was associated with increased risk
of both NHL and HL. This mirrors what has been seen in a pre-
vious study20 and could potentially be related to the presence
of immunodeficiency prior to lymphoma diagnosis.
The strengths of this study include its large sample size,
population-based design, and use of validated cancer out-
comes from SEER cancer registries, which have high stan-
dardsforcompletenessandaccuracy.6Theresultsofouranaly-
ses of Medicare beneficiaries are likely generalizable to the US
elderly population. In addition, the longitudinal nature of this
study allowed for assessment of HNC risk according to time
since chronic sinusitis diagnosis and for calculations of the
cumulative incidence of HNC in this population.
We also acknowledge several limitations. First, we lacked
data on tobacco use, which may be associated with the risk of
developing chronic sinusitis (with relative risks of ~1.1-1.9).21,22
However, chronic sinusitis was not strongly associated with
tobacco-related cancers (eg, lung and bladder cancers) in our
study,suggestingthattheassociationswithHNCswerelikelynot
substantiallyconfoundedbyunmeasuredtobaccouse.Wewere
alsolimitedbythelackofdataonthedurationofchronicsinus-
itis and on the viral status of HNCs. We considered all cases of
HPV-OPCandNPCtobevirusrelated,butassumingthatchronic
sinusitismayplayaroleonlyincasesactuallycausedbyHPVor
EBV, our associations could be attenuated. Because OPC cases
linked to HPV tend to occur in younger individuals than HPV-
unrelated cases, the lack of middle-aged adults in our study is
alimitation.23Also,wecouldnotassesstheassociationofchronic
sinusitis with inverted papilloma of the nose and paranasal
sinuses, which also occurs more commonly at younger ages.24
Despite the fact that people with chronic sinusitis have an
increased risk for certain subtypes of HNCs, the absolute risk
of these cancers is low. The cumulative incidence of NPC,
HPV-OPC, and NCPSC was less than 0.10% after 8 years of
follow-up after a chronic sinusitis diagnosis. There are cur-
rently no general US guidelines for HNC screening, but given
the low absolute risk, our findings do not support a need for
HNC screening in individuals with chronic sinusitis.
Conclusions
This is one of the first studies to demonstrate associations of
chronic sinusitis with HPV-OPC, NPC, and NCPSCs. The HNC
risks within 1 year of chronic sinusitis diagnosis support that
theseassociationscanbeexplainedinlargepartbyartifactssuch
as surveillance bias, reverse causation, or diagnostic confu-
sion. Whereas an etiologic contribution of sinusitis-related
inflammation or immunodeficiency to HNC cannot be ex-
cluded, this study suggests that they do not play a large role in
promotingtheearlyorintermediatecarcinogenicstagesofHNC.
