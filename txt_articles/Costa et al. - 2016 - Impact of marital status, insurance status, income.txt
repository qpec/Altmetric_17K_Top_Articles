BACKGROUND: Recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) have been associated with improved survival, predomi-
nantly among young and white patients. The authors hypothesized that sociodemographic factors, adjusted for race/ethnicity, influ-
ence the survival of younger patients with MM. METHODS: Overall survival (OS) data were obtained for individuals included in the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER-18) program who were diagnosed with MM before the age of 65 years between
2007 and 2012. The sociodemographic variables addressed were marital status, insurance status, median household income, and edu-
cational achievement in the county of residence. Race/ethnicity was defined as a self-reported construct including Hispanic (regard-
less of race), non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and other. RESULTS: There were 10,161 cases of MM included with a median
follow-up of 27 months (range, 0-71 months; 22,179 person-years). Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, SEER regis-
try; age; male sex; and 3 sociodemographic factors including marital status (other than married), insurance status (uninsured or Med-
icaid), and county-level income (lowest 2 quartiles), but not race/ethnicity, were found to be associated with an increased risk of
death. The 4-year estimated OS rate was 71.1%, 63.2%, 53.4%, and 46.5% (P<.001), respectively, for patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 adverse
sociodemographic factors. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black individuals were found to have more adverse sociodemographic factors
and worse OS. However, when the population was stratified by the cumulative number of sociodemographic factors, no consistent as-
sociation between race/ethnicity and OS was observed after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic factors
that potentially affect care, but not race/ethnicity, were found to influence the survival of younger patients with MM. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the United States, with 30,330 new
cases expected in 2016.1 Although MM is a rare malignancy, the mortality rate is high, with a 5-year survival rate of
46.6%.2 In addition, MM most frequently occurs among black individuals, and the incidence increases with age, with the
majority of patients being aged >65 years3; however, approximately 38% of new cases are diagnosed in individuals aged
<65 years.
Response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) of patients with MM have improved substantially
in the last 20 years due to the broader use of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplan-
tation4 and, more recently, the availability of immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors.5-7 Improvements in
OS have been observed predominantly among younger patients8-10 and more recently in older patients,11,12 albeit to a
lesser extent. Moreover, improvements in OS have been greater in white individuals compared with patient populations of
ethnic minorities.13,14
Factors affecting the OS of patients newly diagnosed with MM include disease stage; chromosome abnormali-
ties15,16; gene expression patterns in clonal myeloma plasma cells17; the presence of elevated lactic dehydrogenase16,18;
and host factors including age, race, comorbidities, performance status, and ultimately response to treatment.19 Recent
advances in treatment options have facilitated improvements in OS. However, because of the complexity, length of

 duration, and high cost of these treatments,20,21 we hy-
pothesized that sociodemographic factors, including in-
surance status, marital status, income, and educational
level, may contribute to the OS observed in patients with
MM irrespective of race/ethnicity. Although sociodemo-
graphic factors have been evaluated extensively in the
more commonly occurring solid tumors,22-25 to the best
of our knowledge the combined effects of sociodemo-
graphic factors on the OS observed in patients with MM
remains unclear, particularly among those diagnosed be-
fore age 65 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
We obtained OS data from individuals included in 18
registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) registry program to characterize the inde-
pendent and joint contributions of select sociodemo-
graphic factors on the OS of patients with MM diagnosed
at age <65 years. The SEER-18 includes population-
based cancer populations reported in the Atlanta, Con-
necticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, San
Francisco-Oakland, Seattle-Puget Sound, Utah, Los
Angeles, San Jose-Monterey, Rural Georgia, Alaska Na-
tive, Greater California, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jer-
sey, and Greater Georgia registries, constituting 27.8% of
the US population.
Case Definition
Cases were newly diagnosed with MM (International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition [ICD-
O-3] codes 9732/3) in the time period between 2007 (the
year when insurance information became available) and
2012 (the most recent year for which data were available),
and were aged <65 years at the time of diagnosis. Cases
for whom data regarding marital status (796 cases), insur-
ance status (625 cases), or race/ethnicity (112 cases) were
missing or for whom the sole source of information was
death certificate or autopsy (51 cases) were excluded from
the analysis. Follow-up information was available through
2012. For the current analysis, we considered early mor-
tality as death occurring within the first 12 months after
diagnosis.26 Some factors expected to affect survival in-
cluding disease stage, chromosome abnormalities, and
treatment were not captured in SEER and therefore were
not included in the current analysis.
Definition of Sociodemographic Factors
For each case we included age at the time of diagnosis
(continuous), sex, race (white, black, and other) and
ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic), SEER registry,
marital status (married, divorced, single, or widowed), in-
surance status (Medicaid, insured, or uninsured), median
household income (in quartiles) within the county of resi-
dence at the time of diagnosis (categorical), percentage of
adult individuals with at least a Bachelor’s degree within

 and other) in analyses not stratified by these variables.
Variables were chosen using a stepwise backward process
with a probability of entry of .05 and a probability of re-
moval of .10. Statistical significance, based on multivari-
able
models,
was
calculated
using
the
maximum
likelihood chi-square test, and differences between strata
were determined using the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square
test for homogeneity. Formal testing revealed that predic-
tors included in Cox proportional hazards models satis-
fied the assumption of proportionality. Survival plots
were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A 2-
sided P value �.05 was considered to be statistically sig-
nificant. All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical
software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
As shown in Table 1, a total of 10,161 cases of MM
reported to the SEER-18 registry during the reporting pe-
riod for 2007 through 2012 were included in the current
analysis. The median follow-up was 27 months (range, 0-
71 months; 22,179 person-years).
Sociodemographic Characteristics and Survival
In the crude analysis, SEER registry, age, male sex, race/
ethnicity, marital status, insurance status, county-level
median household income, and county-level education
were associated with OS (Fig. 1) (Table 2). However, in
the Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for SEER
registry, age, and sex, only marital status, insurance status,
and county-level income, but not race/ethnicity, were
found to significantly influence OS. County-level educa-
tion did not appear to significantly contribute to the fit of
this model. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that mari-
tal status, insurance status, and county-level education,
but not county-level income, affected early mortality (ie,
death occurring within the first year after diagnosis) (see
Supporting Information Table 1).
The cumulative effect of sociodemographic factors
associated with shorter survival in the multivariable analy-
sis (ie, marital status other than married, insurance status
other than “insured,” and residence in a county within the
lowest 2 quartiles of income) is shown in Figure 2. The
4-year estimated OS rate for the 2985 patients with no ad-
verse sociodemographic factors (29.4%) was 71.1% (95%
CI, 68.9%-73.3%), in contrast to a 4-year OS rate of
63.2% (95% CI, 61.2%-65.1%) for the 4124 patients
with 1 adverse sociodemographic factor (40.6%), 53.4%
(95% CI, 50.7%-56.1) for the 2254 patients with 2 ad-
verse sociodemographic factors (22.2%), and 46.5%
(95% CI, 41.6%-51.4%) for the 798 patients with
3 adverse sociodemographic factors (7.9%). When adjust-
ed for SEER registry, age, and sex, the presence of 1 adverse
sociodemographic factor (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28-1.57),
2 adverse sociodemographic factors (HR, 2.15; 95% CI,
1.91-2.41), and 3 adverse sociodemographic factors (HR,
2.81; 95% CI, 2.42-3.26) were found to be associated
with a gradually higher risk of death when compared with
individuals with no adverse sociodemographic factors.
Subsequently, we wanted to exclude the theory that
competing causes of death were biasing the main analysis
by estimating the relative survival for the main groups of
interest. Relative survival is the rate between the actual
and expected survival and is an indicator of the lethality of
a condition not affected by the limitations in cause-of-
death attribution. We verified that marital status, insur-
ance status, and county-level income also were predictive
of relative survival (see Supporting Information Table 2).

 Race/Ethnicity and Survival
In the crude analysis, Hispanic and NHB individuals were
found to have a higher risk of death compared with
NHW individuals, despite their earlier age at the time of
diagnosis (Table 2). However, after adjusting for marital
status, insurance status, county-level household income,
sex, and age, race/ethnicity was found to no longer signifi-
cantly influence survival, suggesting that the apparent im-
pact of race/ethnicity on OS may be due to the disparate
distribution of sociodemographic factors observed among
the different races/ethnicities (Table 3) rather than the
race/ethnicity construct itself.
To further understand the impact of race/ethnicity
on OS and its interaction with sociodemographic factors,
we stratified the sample according to the cumulative num-
ber of adverse sociodemographic factors as identified in
the main analysis (ie, marital status other than married,
insurance status other than “insured,” and residence in a
county within the lowest 2 quartiles of income). We sub-
sequently analyzed the impact of race/ethnicity within
each stratum, adjusting for age, male sex, and SEER regis-
try (Table 4). Although NHB individuals were found to
have a higher risk of death compared with NHW individ-
uals in the stratum with no adverse sociodemographic fac-
tors, there was no consistent trend of association noted
between race/ethnicity and OS across the remaining
strata.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the larg-
est study to date assessing the impact of sociodemographic
variables on the survival of patients with MM diagnosed
before age 65 years. We found a higher risk of death asso-
ciated with a lack of health insurance or being a Medicaid
beneficiary; being single, widowed, or divorced; and resid-
ing in a county within the lower 2 quartiles of median

 household income, after adjusting for age, male sex, and
SEER registry.
A very extensive SEER-based analysis in more com-
mon cancers demonstrated that married patients were less
likely to present with metastatic disease, more likely to re-
ceive definitive therapy, and less likely to die of their can-
cer compared with unmarried patients, indicating that
being married may greatly affect how patients with cancer
access health care.25 The treatment of MM has become
prolonged, expensive, and complex. It is conceivable that
patients who are not married and have low income have a
more fragile support network with which to cope with the
challenges of MM treatment, which ultimately may influ-
ence access to novel therapies, hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation, and the adequate management of recur-
rent disease. Yet another possibility is that patients with
unfavorable sociodemographic factors also have more seri-
ous comorbidities affecting their ability to fully benefit
from therapy. Because comorbidities are not captured in
the SEER database, this possibility could not be explored
in the current study.
An interesting observation was that being a Medic-
aid beneficiary carries a similarly increased risk of death as
not having health insurance. This finding should not be
interpreted as an assessment of the value of Medicaid serv-
ices in light of the fact that there are multiple possible con-
founding factors, including the possibility of Medicaid
beneficiaries having more or worse comorbidities than un-
insured
patients,
which
could
contribute
to
this
association.
The current analysis has important limitations. Due
to the nature of these data, we did not have information
regarding disease-specific factors (such as chromosome
abnormalities, disease staging, or other clinicopathologic
features) that are known to influence survival. It is con-
ceivable that more disadvantaged patients have delayed ac-
cess to care and present with a more advanced stage of
disease or with life-threatening complications. This possi-
bility is supported further by the finding that marital sta-
tus, insurance status, and county-level education also
affected early mortality. We also could not describe or an-
alyze treatment and treatment response. Finally, income
and education were reported at the county level, not at the
individual level, thereby preventing further refinement of
the analysis.
Race and ethnicity have been described as affecting
access to treatment and outcomes among patients with
MM.13,14,27 Biological differences also have been recog-
nized between black and white patients with MM.28 The
results of the current study suggest that the effect of race

 and ethnicity on outcome is largely a reflection of sociode-
mographic factors potentially affecting access to care. In
fact, as MM treatment became more effective but also
more sophisticated and costly, a greater improvement in
outcomes was observed among white patients compared
with patients who were ethnic minorities.13,14 It is con-
cerning that the recent approval of novel proteasome
inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, and monoclonal
antibodies may increase the cost of care further and accen-
tuate these disparities.
The strong effect of variables other than disease char-
acteristics on the survival of young patients with MM
highlights the impact of social determinants of health, de-
fined by the World Health Organization as the conditions
in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and
the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions
of daily life. In the United States, social determinants of
health are believed to account for a substantial percentage
of deaths in general.29 Those potentially avoidable deter-
minants indicate new opportunities for improving out-
comes among patients with MM. In addition to the
pursuit of a deeper understanding of the disease biology
and the development of new effective therapies, strategies
to identify and address barriers to access to care are likely
to result in improvements in myeloma-related outcomes.
With the recent emphasis on comparative effectiveness in
oncology,30 it becomes crucial that all variables affecting
outcomes,
including
sociodemographic
factors,
are
accounted for when comparisons between different thera-
peutic approaches and health care systems are made.
