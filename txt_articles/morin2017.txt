ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The burden of medications near the end of life has recently come under scrutiny, because
several studies suggested that people with life-limiting illness receive potentially futile treatments.
METHODS: We identified 511,843 older adults (>65 years) who died in Sweden between 2007 and 2013
and reconstructed their drug prescription history for each of the last 12 months of life through the Swedish
Prescribed Drug Register. Decedents’ characteristics at time of death were assessed through record
linkage with the National Patient Register, the Social Services Register, and the Swedish Education
Register.
RESULTS: Over the course of the final year before death, the proportion of individuals exposed to �10
different drugs rose from 30.3% to 47.2% (P <.001 for trend). Although older adults who died from
cancer had the largest increase in the number of drugs (mean difference, 3.37; 95% confidence interval,
3.35 to 3.40), living in an institution was independently associated with a slower escalation (b ¼ �0.90,
95% confidence interval, �0.92 to �0.87). During the final month before death, analgesics (60.8%), anti-
throm-botic agents (53.8%), diuretics (53.1%), psycholeptics (51.2%), and b-blocking agents (41.1%)
were the 5 most commonly used drug classes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins were
used by, respectively, 21.4% and 15.8% of all individuals during their final month of life.
CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy increases throughout the last year of life of older adults, fueled not only by
symptomatic medications but also by long-term preventive treatments of questionable benefit. Clinical
guidelines are needed to support physicians in their decision to continue or discontinue medications near the
end of life.

CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDY
 Under the combined effect of increased longevity, chronic
multimorbidity, and single-disease clinical guidelines, the
concomitant use of multiple medications has become
commonplace among older adults.1 Polypharmacy increases
inappropriate drug use and drugedrug interactions and ex-
poses older adults to serious adverse effects.2 Yet, it is
estimated that 25% to 40% of
adults aged 65 years or older are
prescribed at least 5 medications.3
When considering older people
near the end of life, poly-pharmacy
poses 2 problems. First, as death
approaches,
age-related
physio-
logic changes are amplified by the
changing metabolism, the decline
of renal and hepatic functions, and
the loss of body mass. As a result,
pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-
dynamics are altered, making older
adults with life-limiting illness
particularly
vulnerable
to
the
harmful side effects of medica-
tions.4 Second, the accumulation
of prescriptions in the context of
limited
life
expectancy
raises
questions about the intended or expected benefit of the
treatments.5
The burden of medications near the end of life has
recently come under scrutiny, because several studies have
shown that people with specific life-limiting diseases are
prescribed medications whose benefit is unlikely to be
achieved within their remaining lifespan.6 However, these
studies have all been conducted in selected samples of in-
dividuals who shared a common disease7-10 or care
setting11-14 or were recruited for a clinical trial.15 Future
research and clinical guidelines need to be informed by
findings that are generalizable beyond a specific illness or
care setting.
This study aimed to measure the change in the prevalence
of polypharmacy and to identify the most commonly used
medications over the course of the last year of life of older
people, using data with national coverage in Sweden.
METHODS
Study Design and Population
We conducted a nationwide, follow-back cohort study of all
older adults who died at age >65 years in Sweden between
January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2013. Individuals were
excluded from the study population if they had no reported
cause of death or had no prescription data available during the
final 3 months before the date of death (Supplementary
Figure 1, available online). Death certificate data were ob-
tainedfromtheSwedishNationalBoardofHealthandWelfare
and were linked at the individual level to several other regis-
tries with national coverage: the Swedish Prescribed Drug
Register, Social Services Register, National Patient Register,
and Swedish Education Register. Data were anonymized, and
the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm approved
the study (no. 2013/1941-31/3 and 2015/1319-32).
Assessment of
Polypharmacy and Drug
Exposure
Polypharmacy was considered as
the primary outcome. Although
there is no consensual definition,
studies conducted in the general
geriatric population typically use a
threshold of �4 or �5 medica-
tions
to
characterize
poly-
pharmacy and �9 or �10 to
describe
“excessive
poly-
pharmacy.”16-18 In light of the
considerable burden of chronic
diseases and symptoms near the
end of life,19 we opted for the
latter, more conservative cut-off.
Hence polypharmacy was here-
after
defined
as
the
monthly
exposure to 10 or more prescription drugs, that is, distinct
substances according to the fifth level of the Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.
Prescription drug data were derived from the Swedish
Prescribed Drug Register to evaluate the total number of
medications during each of the final 12 months before death.
In Sweden, drug prescriptions cover a maximum period of
90 days. Drug exposure was estimated according to 1) the
date of dispensing, 2) the total amount dispensed to the
patient, and 3) the prescribed daily dose, as described in
Supplementary Figure 2 (available online).20,21 In addition,
we calculated the prevalence of the 20 most common indi-
vidual drug classes for the 12th, 6th, and final months before
death. As recommended by the World Health Organization,
drugs were classified by ATC code.
Descriptive Variables
Sex and age at time of death were both extracted from death
certificates. International Classification of Diseases, 10th
revision diagnosis codes for all contributing causes of death
were categorized into 4 distinct “illness trajectories” indic-
ative of the potential timeframe of care needs near the end of
life: cancer, organ failure, prolonged dwindling, and sudden
death.22,23 Individuals were assigned a single illness tra-
jectory using a modified version of the protocol developed
by Lunney et al24 (Supplementary Table 1, available on-
line). When multiple causes of death indicated more than 1
illness trajectory, we applied a predefined hierarchy (ie,
from cancer to prolonged dwindling to organ failure to
sudden death).25 In addition, we used a multimorbidity
assessment tool recently validated in the general elderly
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
� The burden of medications increases
near the end of life (47.2% of older
adults receive �10 prescription drugs
during their last month of life).
� Polypharmacy is fueled not only by
symptomatic medications but also by
long-term
preventive
treatments
of
questionable benefit.
� Guidelines are needed to support physi-
cians in their decision to continue or
discontinue drug treatments near the
end of life.

 population26 to provide a comprehensive account of the
burden of disease near the end of life (Supplementary
Table 2, available online). In brief, a total of 60 chronic
diseases were identified through the National Cause of
Death Register (all causes of death), the National Patient
Register (inpatient and specialized outpatient diagnoses re-
ported during the last 24 months before death), and the
Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (use of specific medica-
tions in the last 24 months before death). Living arrange-
ment of the individuals during the final year of life was
categorized as “community-dwelling” or “institutionalized,”
using data from the Social Services Register. Level of ed-
ucation was used as a measure of socioeconomic position
and operationalized as “primary education,” “secondary
education,” and “tertiary education.”
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analysis was performed by calculating the pro-
portion
and
means
of
the
decedents’
characteristics
according to their living arrangement. Statistical differences
were tested with Pearson’s c2 for categorical variables and
median test for continuous variables, with P <.001. The
proportion of individuals receiving �10 drugs was reported
together with the mean number of prescription drugs
throughout the final year of life. Results comparing
community-dwelling and institutionalized individuals were
standardized for both sex and age by using the total popu-
lation as reference.
We investigated trends in polypharmacy and in the
number of prescribed drugs between the 12th month and the
final month before death. Unadjusted logistic regression
models were computed to calculate the odds of being
exposed to polypharmacy during the final month before
death compared with 12 months before, using clustered
robust standard error to account for intra-individual corre-
lation. We also identified factors independently associated
with change in the number of prescribed drugs over time by
means of generalized estimating equation models with

 unstructured correlation. The number of distinct medications
was considered as a continuous dependent variable, whereas
sex, age, living arrangement, number of chronic diseases,
illness trajectory, and level of education were entered as
independent variables. Results are presented as adjusted b
coefficients with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In
sensitivity analyses the same models were computed by
removing analgesics (ATC code N02) from the total number
of prescription drugs, because this class of medications is
used for specific purposes near the end of life. Finally,
changes in the prevalence of individual drug classes were
assessed with variation rates (with 95% CI) from the 12th to
the final month before death. Bivariate logistic regressions
were used to assess P for trend (2-sided a ¼ .01). All an-
alyses were performed with SAS JMP 12.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and Stata 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)
software.
RESULTS
Study Population
Of all 545,212 older adults who died in Sweden between
2007 and 2013, 511,843 (93.9%) met our eligibility criteria.
Table

shows
the
decedents’
main
characteristics.
Compared
with
community
dwellers,
institutionalized
individuals were more often women, died at older age,
and were more likely to follow a trajectory of prolonged
dwindling. Overall, 51% of individuals had 5 or more
diagnosed chronic conditions at time of death. The most
common chronic illnesses were ischemic heart diseases
(42%),
hypertension
(40%),
congestive
heart
failure
(38%),
cancer
(31%),
atrial
fibrillation
(27%),
and
cerebrovascular diseases (26%).
Change in the Prevalence of Polypharmacy
The prevalence of polypharmacy increased significantly
throughout the last year of life (Figure). Between the 12th
and the final month before death, the proportion of
individuals exposed to �10 different drugs rose from
30.3% to 47.2% (P <.001 for trend), and the mean
(standard
deviation)
number
of
prescription
drugs
increased from 7.6 (4.4) to 9.6 (4.7). Older adults living in
institutions were found to receive a greater number of
medications than those living in the community (P <.001
for each of the final 12 months of life). These trends
remained after excluding analgesics from the total count
of prescription drugs (Supplementary Figure 3, available
online). However, we found significant differences across
age groups and illness trajectories (Supplementary Figure 4,
available online).
Factors Associated with Change in the Number
of Prescription Drugs
The magnitude of the increase in polypharmacy over the
course of the last year of life varied significantly ac-
cording
to
the
decedents’
characteristics
(Table
2).
Hence,
the
likelihood
of
being
exposed
to
polypharmacy during the final month of life compared
with 12 months before death was greater for individuals
who died from cancer (odds ratio 3.34; 95% CI, 3.29-
3.39) than for those who died from dementia or other
neurodegenerative disorders (odds ratio 1.74; 95% CI,

at
time
of
death,
and
institutionalization
were
independently associated with a slower increase in the
average number of medications over time. Older adults
who died from cancer had the greatest increase in the
number of prescription drugs (mean difference 3.37;
95% CI, 3.35-3.40). These associations were only partly
attenuated when analgesics were excluded from the total
count
of
prescribed
drugs
(Supplementary
Tables
3
and 4, available online).
Most Commonly Used Drug Classes
Antithrombotic agents, diuretics, analgesics, psycholeptics,
and b-blocking agents were found to be the 5 most common
prescription drug classes during the last year of life
(Table 4). Agents acting on the renineangiotensin system,
antianemic preparations, antidepressants, and drugs for
acid-related disorders were also highly prevalent, with
more than 30% of decedents exposed to these drugs during
the final month before death. The pattern of prescription
drug use changed over the course of the last 12 months of
life, with a notable increase in the exposure to opioids
(þ120.7%),
antimicrobials
(þ74.3%),
anxiolytics
(þ59.5%), drugs for constipation (þ57.8%), and antipsy-
chotics (þ47.3%). We found only a modest decrease in the
use of preventive drugs. Hence, during their last month of
life, a significant share of older adults used b-blockers
(41.1%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (21.4%),
vasodilators
(17.4%),
lipid-lowering
agents
(16.3%),

 calcium channel blockers (15.4%), or potassium-sparing
agents (12.1%). The prevalence of preventive medication
was found to be higher among younger individuals
(Supplementary Table 5, available online).
DISCUSSION
Our study has two main findings. First, the proportion of
older adults exposed to �10 different prescription drugs
increases over the course of the last year before death, and
approximately half of individuals experience polypharmacy
during their last month of life. Second, polypharmacy is
fueled not only by an increased use of medications directed
toward symptom management but also by the frequent
continuation of long-term preventive treatments and disease-
targeted drugs.
These results compare to earlier studies. McNeil et al15
recently reported that patients with a life-limiting disease
took on average 10.7 medications at time of death, with
69% of patients using 9 or more different drugs (excluding
statins). In a retrospective cohort study of 100 patients
who died from advanced cancer, researchers found a me-
dian of 11 prescribed medications 9 days before death.27
Despite a considerable heterogeneity in study designs
and populations, other studies investigating drug use near
the end of life have reported comparable results.6,28 These
findings
demonstrate
the
challenge
of
managing
the
accumulation of health problems in older adults with life-
limiting illness.29

Medications near the End of Life
7
 symptoms
(eg,
analgesics,
loop-diuretics,
anxiolytics)
compose the first of these 5 categories. This is expected,
because the need for comfort care and symptom manage-
ment increases sharply as death approaches.19 The second
category includes drug regimens used in the long-term
prevention of chronic diseases that pose no immediate
danger. Hence we found that statins were rarely dis-
continued and were still prescribed to 16% of older adults
during their last month of life. Although this figure is
consistent
with
previous
reports,8,30
it
raises
serious
concern: the clinical benefit of treatments drugs aiming at
preventing cardiovascular diseases during the final month of
life is at the very least questionable.31,32 Medications used to
control the evolution of potentially life-threatening or
disabling comorbidities form a third distinct group of pre-
scriptions (eg, oral antidiabetics, platelet aggregation in-
hibitors, thyroid therapy, antidementia drugs, and cardiac
stimulants). The fourth group is drugs prescribed in an
attempt to cure or slow the progression of the main life-
limiting illness (eg, chemotherapy, immunosuppressants).
Finally, drugs administered to counteract the current or
anticipated adverse effects of other medications constitute a
fifth group of prescriptions. The widespread use of potas-
sium supplementation, proton-pump inhibitors, and laxa-
tives close to death may reflect a “prescribing cascade” (ie,
prescriptions prompted by the onset of symptoms induced
by other medications rather than by the disease itself).33
To help clinicians assess the value and the appropriate-
ness of drug treatments in a context of limited life expec-
tancy, Holmes et al34 recommended that 2 key questions be
taken into account. First, is the patient’s life expectancy
longer than the time needed for the medication to achieve its
benefit? Second, are the objectives of the prescribed medi-
cation in keeping with the goals of care that the physician
and the patient discussed and agreed upon? This prescribing
model relies on the idea that drug treatments should be
adapted to mirror the course of the disease as the remaining
life expectancy diminishes. In other words, physicians
should consider discontinuing drugs that may be effective
and otherwise appropriate but whose potential harms
outweigh the benefits that patients can reasonably expect
before death occurs. The process of deprescribing (ie,
withdrawing medications with the aim of improving health
outcomes35,36) is now supported by a growing body of ev-
idence.37 In a recent randomized, controlled trial including
patients with �12 months of estimated life expectancy, re-
searchers found no significant survival difference according
to statin continuation/discontinuation and showed that
quality of life was significantly improved in the group of
patients that discontinued statins.38 Whether this conclusion
is applicable to other drug classes remains uncertain,
because data regarding the safety of discontinuing preven-
tative medications in the context of end-of-life care remain
scarce.39 One should also balance the potential lack of
benefit of a certain drug with the possible collateral effects
of its discontinuation. For instance, although there is
considerable uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of
antidementia agents in older adults reaching the end of
life,40 the discontinuation of these medications may have
indirect negative consequences, such as an increased risk of
institutionalization.41
At the end of life, the challenge of deprescribing drug
treatments is amplified by the uncertainty inherent to sur-
vival predictions42 and by the natural tendency of healthcare
professionals and patients to believe that medical in-
terventions are more effective than they actually are (a
phenomenon described as the “therapeutic illusion”43). The
frequent continuation of potentially futile treatments may
also be the consequence both of a lack of communication
and of insufficient shared decision making between patients
and prescribers, out of fear that discussing issues sur-
rounding the end of life would be perceived as a failure or
that it would amount to “giving up.”44,45 To overcome this
predicament, the process of deprescribing requires timely
patientefamilyephysician dialogue about the risk/benefit
ratio of medications, and close monitoring of symptoms
during the following weeks. As the situation worsens, the
goals of care should be frequently reassessed to ensure that
the treatment target remains concordant with the patient’s
preferences. It is also essential that patients and their rela-
tives receive clear information about their options in terms
of palliative care, to counter the feeling of abandonment that
they may experience when disease-directed treatments are
withdrawn.29,46
Our study should be interpreted with caution, considering
the following limitations. First, the Swedish Prescribed
Drug Register only records prescription drugs dispensed at
pharmacies. Over-the-counter medications and medications
administered in hospitals or from drug store rooms in
nursing homes are not reported in the register, leading to a
potential underestimation of the actual drug exposure.
However, approximately 86% of defined daily doses
dispensed to the Swedish population annually are prescrip-
tion drugs delivered through pharmacies and are therefore
covered by the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Second,
we could only estimate drug exposure with the assumption
that patients use the dispensed medications at the prescribed
rate; we could therefore not account for nonadherence to
treatment. Additionally, we did not investigate whether
drugs that were continued until the final month of life were
deintensified in terms of dosage, which could correspond to
a shift toward a palliative approach. Notwithstanding these
methodologic restrictions, it is the first study investigating
the burden of medications near the end of life in an entire
population (ie, irrespective of the underlying disease or care
setting).
CONCLUSIONS
Polypharmacy increases sharply throughout the last year of
life of older adults. To reduce the burden of medications of
questionable benefit in older adults with life-limiting illness,
robust evidence about the benefit and safety of deprescribing
is needed. Following the example set by Kutner et al38 with
8
The American Journal of Medicine, Vol -, No -, - 2017
 the statin discontinuation trial, future clinical trials should be
conducted to evaluate the effects of withdrawing preventive
medications in people with advanced illness. These findings
should then be embedded into clinical guidelines, in the
same manner that new evidence regarding the benefit and
safety of initiating drug therapy is incorporated into current
practice guidelines. However, because end-of-life situations
are shaped by different disease trajectories, symptoms, and
personal preferences, the goals of care vary considerably
from one person to another. Future clinical practice guide-
lines should thus foster personalized decision making rather
than promote the systematic discontinuation of medications
according to a one-size-fits-all set of criteria.

*Variation rates indicate the relative change in prevalence of polypharmacy (�10 prescription drugs excluding analgesics) between the 12th month and
the final month before death.
†Odds ratio computed by the mean of logistic regression models including polypharmacy (�10 prescription drugs excluding analgesics) as a binary
dependent variable and time (last month before death vs 12th month before death) as sole independent variable. Clustered standard errors at the individual
level were used to account for correlation of observations within groups.
‡Missing values for level of education: 24,319 (4.7% of the total cohort).
§Illness trajectories were constructed using all the diagnoses mentioned on the death certificates (ie, both underlying and contributing causes of
death).
