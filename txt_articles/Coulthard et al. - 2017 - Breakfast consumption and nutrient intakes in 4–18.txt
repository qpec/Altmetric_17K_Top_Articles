Abstract
Although breakfast consumption is widely considered to be an important component of a healthy lifestyle, few UK studies have examined
differences in nutrient intakes between breakfast consumers and breakfast skippers among children and adolescents. We investigated associations
between breakfast skipping in 4–18-year-olds and their nutrient intakes using data from the UK’s National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling
Programme. Dietary data were derived from 4-d estimated food diaries of 802 children aged 4–10 years and 884 children aged 11–18 years (1686 in
total). Daily nutrient intakes of children with different breakfast habits were compared by one-way ANCOVA adjusting for relevant covariates
(sex, age, ethnicity, equivalised household income and BMI). Within-person analysis was carried out on children with an irregular breakfast habit
(n 879) comparing nutrient intakes on breakfast days with those on non-breakfast days using repeated measures ANCOVA. We observed that the
overall nutritional profile of the children in terms of fibre and micronutrient intake was superior in frequent breakfast consumers (micronutrients:
folate, Ca, Fe and I (P < 0·01)) and, for the 4–10 years age group, on breakfast days (micronutrients: folate, vitamin C, Ca and I (P < 0·01)). Also,
significantly higher proportions of breakfast-consuming children met their reference nutrient intakes of folate, vitamin C, Ca, Fe and I compared
with breakfast skippers (χ2 analysis, P < 0·001). Our study adds to the body of data linking breakfast consumption with higher quality dietary intake
in school-age children, supporting the promotion of breakfast as an important element of a healthy dietary pattern in children.
Key words: Children: Dietary patterns: Breakfast: Nutrient intakes: National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme
Breakfast is widely considered to be an important component of
a healthy lifestyle for both adults and children. Its consumption is
promoted by the UK Government’s Change4Life public health
campaign in England(1). One of the suggested benefits of
breakfast for children and adolescents is that eating breakfast
regularly protects against overweight and obesity. To date,
evidence for this consists largely of epidemiological studies(2–9)
and intervention studies have so far failed to demonstrate a
causal relationship between breakfast habit and adiposity(10–13).
Another proposed benefit of breakfast consumption in children
and adolescents is that it improves overall nutrient intakes(2).
Previous studies have been carried out into variations in
nutritional intakes dependent on child breakfast habits, but
many of these focus on consumption of a specific type of
breakfast, for example breakfast cereal(14–16) or a ‘good-quality’
breakfast(17). Some have examined overall differences in
nutritional profile between children who eat breakfast and
those that do not, including recent studies involving North
American, Mexican and Australian populations(18–22), and
have reported that breakfast consumption compared with
breakfast skipping was associated with improved nutrient
intakes(18,20–30). However, the authors are not aware of any
recent studies of UK or other European children examining
differences in nutrient intakes between breakfast consumers
and breakfast skippers. Therefore, our main aim in this study
was to investigate associations between breakfast skipping in
4–18-year-olds and their nutrient intakes using data from the
UK’s National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme
(NDNS RP). We compared daily nutrient intakes between
children with different breakfast habits and also carried out a
within-person analysis, comparing intakes of children on
breakfast days with their intakes on non-breakfast days. This
latter approach was adopted in order to minimise the impact of
residual confounding inherent in cross-sectional studies.

 Many epidemiological studies comparing the characteristics
of individuals with different breakfast habits ask participants
(or their parents) how frequently they (or their children) consume
breakfast, but do not include a definition of this meal(4,27,31,32).
Where breakfast is defined, this definition varies widely(2,33,34).
Some studies classify any energy intake within a specified time
period as breakfast(19,21), others include only solid foods and not
beverages in the definition, regardless of the energy content of
the latter(34). We employed an objective definition of breakfast,
based on a minimum energy intake within a specified time period.
We hypothesised that intakes of micronutrients of public health
interest, which have a key role in children’s healthy development
and growth, may be particularly affected by breakfast skipping, as
many breakfast items consumed widely by UK children, such as
breakfast cereals, fruit juice and dairy products, are important
sources of micronutrients for this age group(35).
Methods
Population
The data analysed in this study were collected between 2008
and 2012 as part of the NDNS RP(36). Each year the NDNS RP
gathers dietary and nutritional data from approximately 1000
randomly sampled individuals living in private UK households,
comprising equal numbers of adults (aged 19 years and over)
and children (aged 1·5–18 years)(35). These individuals are
sampled using The Royal Mail’s Postcode Address File, com-
prising all UK addresses, to randomly select addresses. Where
there is more than one household at a selected address, one of
these households is randomly selected. At each selected
household either one adult and one child (if present) are
selected, or one child, resulting in roughly equal numbers of
adults and children in the final sample. Chapter 2 of the report
on the NDNS RP results from years 1–4 (combined)(35) gives
fuller details of its methodology. This study focused on the sub-
population of children in the NDNS RP 2008–2012 sample aged
4–18 years, consisting of 802 children aged 4–10 years and 884
children aged 11–18 years (1686 in total). Ethics approval for
the NDNS RP was obtained from Oxfordshire A Research Ethics
Committee(35).
Dietary assessment
Each survey participant was visited in their home by a survey
interviewer, who placed a 4-d estimated (unweighed) food
diary (with written instructions) to be completed on 4 con-
secutive days by the participant, or their parent for those aged
11 years and under(37,38). Follow-up checks were made by the
interviewer to optimise completeness of record keeping in the
diary(35). Within the sample analysed for years 2008 to 2012 of
the NDNS RP 1686 children aged 4–18 years completed at least
3 diary days (98·2 % of these completed the full 4 diary days).
Home visits were carried out continuously throughout each
year, from February 2008 to August 2012, thus allowing for
seasonal variations in diet(39).
The diary entries were then recorded and analysed by a
dietary assessment system using food composition data from
the Department of Health’s NDNS Nutrient Databank to esti-
mate energy and nutrient intakes(37). The NDNS Nutrient
Databank is based on data from McCance and Widdowson’s
The Composition of Foods series(37,40). Non-milk extrinsic sugars
(NMES) were defined as comprising all free sugars (added
monosaccharides and disaccharides, together with naturally
occurring sugars in honey, syrups and fruit juices) and 50 % of
fruit sugars from stewed, dried or canned fruit(41). Dietary fibre
intakes were of NSP, defined by the Englyst method(42). Mean
daily energy intakes were expressed as a percentage of the
estimated average requirement (EAR) for each child, as speci-
fied by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition(43). Mean
daily intakes of the micronutrients folate, vitamin C, Ca, Fe and I
were compared with dietary reference values (DRV) (reference
nutrient intakes (RNI) and lower reference nutrient intakes
(LRNI)) for each child, as set by the Committee on Medical
Aspects of Food Policy(44). The results of the above analysis of
the diary entries form part of the published core sample data for
the NDNS RP 2008–2012(36) and were further analysed in this
study as described below.
For each day the food diary entries had been split into seven
different time periods: 06.00–08.59, 09.00–11.59, 12.00–13.59,
14.00–16.49, 17.00–19.59, 20.00–21.59 and 22.00–05.59 hours.
Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 (version 14.4.6) and IBM SPSS
Statistics (version 23) were used to calculate the total energy
intake for each diary day between 06.00 and 08.59 hours and
identify those days on which at least 418 kJ (100 kcal) were
consumed between 06.00 and 08.59 hours (breakfast days) and
those on which <418 kJ (<100 kcal) were consumed (non-
breakfast days). The threshold of 418 kJ (100 kcal) was chosen
to allow for consumption of a milky drink which was not
considered sufficient to be classed as breakfast(45). Using these
data, the children were split into three categories: those con-
suming breakfast every diary day, those consuming breakfast
on at least one but not all diary days, and those not consuming
breakfast on any diary day. A subset of the group of children
with an irregular breakfast habit, that is who consumed break-
fast on at least one but not all diary days, was created by
eliminating all diary days that comprised a Saturday or a Sunday
and then identifying all children who still had an irregular
breakfast habit based on weekday diary days alone. This was to
correct for a possible shift to later breakfast time and/or a dif-
ferent pattern in nutrient intakes at the weekend. For each child
with an irregular breakfast habit mean daily nutrient intakes for
breakfast days and non-breakfast days, respectively, were
calculated.
The nutrients selected for analysis in this study were the
macronutrients protein, fat and carbohydrate plus a selection of
other nutrients linked with an unhealthy (NMES and Na) or a
healthy diet (dietary fibre). We also analysed intakes of a
selection of micronutrients that Public Health England has
identified as being of particular interest to public health,
namely: folate, Fe, vitamin C and Ca(35). To this list we added I:
there is some evidence of I deficiency in UK adolescent girls
giving rise to public health concerns due to its vital role in fetal
neurodevelopment(46). The mean daily nutrient intake values
were expressed as a percentage of total energy intake for
protein, fat, carbohydrate and NMES and as mean intakes per
Breakfast and nutrient intakes in children

 4184 kJ (1000 kcal) of energy intake for the remaining nutrients.
This was to allow for possible differences in daily energy
intakes between breakfast and non-breakfast eaters.
Other measures
During the home visit, the interviewer measured the weight and
height of the participant so that their BMI could be calculated
(weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in
metres)(35). The calculated BMI and the British 1990 growth
reference (UK90) charts(47) were used to categorise the children
as normal weight, overweight (85th centile cut-off) or obese
(95th centile cut-off). The interviewer also conducted a
computer-assisted personal interview to collect further data on
the individual and their household, including age, ethnicity (five
main categories: white, mixed, black or black British, Asian or
Asian British, and other), whether the individual was currently
dieting to lose weight (a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response, years 3 and 4 of
the NDNS RP, for individuals 11 years and older) and household
income (choice of thirteen income bands, ranging from under
£5000 to £100 000 or more)(48).
Statistical analysis
The energy-adjusted daily nutrient intake, equivalised house-
hold income (equivalised for different household sizes and
composition using the McClements equivalence scale(35)) and
BMI variables were checked for normality by inspecting
frequency distribution histograms and skew and kurtosis values
and transformed as necessary. The differences between the
children grouped by three categories of breakfast habit
(consumption of breakfast on every, some or no diary days)
with respect to sex, age, ethnicity, weight status and equivalised
household income were assessed by χ2 analysis and ANOVA.
χ2 analysis was carried out on the dieting variable and used to
examine the proportions of children meeting the RNI and LRNI
for daily intakes of the selected micronutrients. χ2 analysis
was also used to compare the characteristics of children with
missing BMI and/or income data to assess whether the rela-
tively high incidence of missing data (n 270, 16 % of sample)
might affect the results adjusted for these variables.
Daily nutrient intakes for the three groups of children with
different breakfast habits were compared by one-way ANOVA
and then ANCOVA, with adjustments made for the following
covariates: sex, age, ethnicity, equivalised household income
and BMI. Energy intake for this analysis was expressed as a
proportion of EAR, to allow for variations in energy intake with
age and sex. To investigate the potential effect of under-
or over-reporting of dietary intakes a sensitivity analysis was
carried out, rerunning the χ2 analysis of children meeting the
DRV
and
the
ANCOVA
analysis
of
energy
intake
after
eliminating those children with energy intake as a proportion of
EAR more than 2 SD from 100 % (as described by McCrory
et al.(49)). This was not considered necessary for the nutrient
intakes, as these were all expressed as a proportion of energy
intake. Due to inequality of variance (assessed using Levene’s
test) for three of the nutrient variables: protein, NMES and Na,
which can lead to an increase in type 1 error rate(50), the
ANOVA and ANCOVA analyses for these variables were carried
out after equalising the numbers in the three groups of children
by random sampling, to create three equal groups of 245 cases
each (for large sample sizes and modest levels of variance
heterogeneity ANOVA is generally robust to inequality of
variances if group sizes are equal(50)).
Within-person analysis was carried out on the children with
an irregular breakfast habit (n 879), comparing their mean
energy-adjusted nutrient intakes for days on which they had
consumed breakfast with those for days on which they had not.
It was assumed that any degree of mis-reporting of dietary
intakes by an individual would be similar across the diary days
and would therefore not have a significant effect on the within-
person analysis. Paired sample t tests were conducted, followed
by repeated measures ANOVA, the latter adjusted for the cov-
ariates sex, age, BMI, ethnicity and equivalised household
income. These tests were also carried out on the sample split
into two age groups: 4–10 years (n 384) and 11–18 years
(n 495) and on the subset of 4–18-year-olds with an irregular
breakfast habit after removal of weekend diary days. Due to
collinearity of nutrient variables, for all the tests carried out a
P value of <0·01 was considered as statistically significant to
allow for multiple testing, rather than using the potentially
overly conservative Bonferroni method of adjustment(51). We
did not apply the weighting as provided with the NDNS 2008–
2012 RP data set, as the calibration weights may not reflect the
characteristics of the subsample of children that we analysed,
which may not be representative of the UK population.
Results
Description of population
The characteristics of the children, split by breakfast habit, are set
out in Table 1. There was a significant variation in breakfast habit
between girls and boys (P=0·001), with 19·9% of girls skipping
breakfast every diary day compared with 14·5% of boys. At 6·5%,
the proportion of the 4–10-year-olds skipping breakfast every diary
day was less than a quarter of the proportion of 11–18-year-olds
(26·8%), and the proportion in the younger age group consuming
breakfast every day was 45·6%, more than twice that of the older
age group (P<0·001). Mean equivalised household income varied
significantly with breakfast habit (P=0·001), with a mean house-
hold income of £28194 (SD £18349) for those children consuming
breakfast every diary day compared with a mean household
income of £23587 (SD £16374) for those children skipping
breakfast every diary day. There was no significant difference in
breakfast habits based on ethnicity or weight status. Data on
whether or not the children were dieting during the diary period
were only available for 11–18-year-olds in years 3 and 4 of the
NDNS RP. A significantly higher percentage of girls were dieting
than boys (10·7 v. 3·4%, P=0·003, n 430), but no significant
variation in breakfast habit with dieting behaviour was observed
for the children as a whole (P=0·456), or for the girls alone
(P=0·419, n 224) (the χ2 analysis was invalid for the boys as
more than 20% of the expected cell values were <5). There were
no significant differences found in sex (P=0·457), age group
(P=0·470) or breakfast habit (P=0·844) for children with missing
BMI and/or income data compared with those with complete data.

 Breakfast habits and micronutrient Dietary Reference Values
Significant increases (P < 0·001) were noted in the proportion of
children meeting their RNI for each of the micronutrients folate,
vitamin C, Ca, Fe and I as breakfast frequency increased
(Table 2). The same trend was observed in the proportion of
children meeting the LRNI for folate, Ca, Fe and I (P < 0·001).
No children who consumed breakfast daily had a folate intake
below their LRNI, compared with 7·3 % of those who did not eat
breakfast on any diary day. The proportions of children not
meeting their LRNI of Ca, Fe and I in the daily breakfast group
were 2·9, 4·4 and 3·3 %, respectively, compared with 19·0, 31·5
and 21·5 %, respectively, in the breakfast skipping group.
Similar results were obtained for the sensitivity analysis
including only plausible reporters of energy intake (n 1505)
(invalid LRNI χ2 results for folate and vitamin C as more than
20 % of cells had expected count of <5).
Breakfast habits and nutrient intakes
After
adjustment
for
covariates,
we
observed
significant
increases in mean intakes of energy (as a percentage of EAR)
(P = 0·009) and carbohydrates (as a percentage of energy)
(P = 0·01) and decreases in mean intakes of fat (as a percentage
of energy) (P = 0·005), with increasing number of breakfast
days (Table 3). However, after eliminating implausible reporters
of energy intakes (energy intake as a percentage of EAR more
than two SD from 100 % (i.e. outside the range 54–146 %)),
the
increases
in
energy
intakes
became
non-significant
(P = 0·088, n 1271). The percentage of plausible reporters in
the sample was 89 %, with a significantly higher proportion of
plausible reporters within the 4–10-year-olds than 11–18-year-
olds (97 v. 83 %, P < 0·001).
In the ANCOVA analysis we observed no statistically
significant variations in intakes of protein, NMES, vitamin C or
Na, but energy-adjusted intakes of fibre, folate, Ca, Fe and I all
increased significantly with increasing frequency of breakfast
consumption (P < 0·001).
Within-person comparison of nutrient intakes on breakfast
days v. non-breakfast days
For 4–18-year-olds, after adjustment for covariates, we observed
significantly higher mean intakes of energy, carbohydrate, folate,
Ca and I and significantly lower mean intakes of protein and Na
for days on which breakfast was consumed compared with days
on which it was not eaten (Table 4(a)). The mean energy intake
for days on which breakfast was consumed was 364kJ (87kcal)
higher than for days on which it was not consumed (95% CI 218,
506 kJ (52, 121 kcal); P< 0·001). No significant differences were
observed when comparing breakfast with non-breakfast days for
mean intakes of fat, NMES, fibre, vitamin C or Fe.
For 4–10-year-olds there was no significant difference between
mean energy intake on days on which breakfast was eaten and
mean intake on non-breakfast days (Table 4(b)). In comparison, in
the older age group (11–18-year-olds), after adjustment for covari-
ates, energy intake was significantly higher on breakfast days
(494 (95 % CI 276, 707) kJ (118 (95 % CI 66, 169) kcal); P<0·001)
(Table 4(c)). For both age groups carbohydrate intake was sig-
nificantly higher on breakfast days compared with non-breakfast
days. There was a significant decrease in protein intake on

 breakfast days compared with non-breakfast days for the older
but not the younger age group. For 4–10-year-olds mean energy-
adjusted intakes of fibre, folate, vitamin C, Ca and I were
significantly higher on days on which breakfast was eaten, but for
11–18-year-olds out of these five nutrients a significant increase
was only observed for Ca intakes. Whereas for the 4–10 years age
group there was no significant difference in mean Na intakes
comparing breakfast with non-breakfast days, Na intake was sig-
nificantly lower for the 11–18 years age group on breakfast days.
For 4–18-year-olds with an irregular breakfast habit after
removal of weekend diary days, there were significantly higher
intakes of energy (661 (95 % CI 389, 933) kJ (158 (95 % CI 93,
223) kcal)), folate, Ca and I for days on which breakfast was
consumed compared with days on which it was not (Table 5).
In contrast to the analysis of all diary days, no significant dif-
ferences in intakes of any of the macronutrients (protein, fat or
carbohydrate) were observed and there was no significant dif-
ference in Na intake.
Discussion
Our findings suggest that the overall nutritional profile of the
children in terms of fibre and micronutrient intake was superior
in regular breakfast consumers, for whom higher energy-
adjusted intakes of fibre, folate, Ca, Fe and I were observed
compared with breakfast skippers. These findings are supported
by our observation that significantly higher proportions of
breakfast-consuming children met their RNI of folate, vitamin C,
Ca, Fe and I compared with breakfast skippers.
In accordance with previous studies(21,23,25), for both the
between and within-person analyses and both age groups a
lack of breakfast was associated with lower Ca intakes. A recent
Mexican study of breakfast dietary patterns among 4–13-year-
old children (n 3760) found that the differences in overall daily
nutrient intake profile between breakfast consumers and
skippers varied with the type of breakfast consumed, but all
breakfast types were associated with a higher daily intake of Ca
than breakfast skipping(22). This is a particularly important

 finding given that Ca is a vital nutrient for bone growth and
needs in childhood are high due to rapid growth and bone mass
accretion(52). In the within-person analysis, higher intakes of
fibre, folate, vitamin C and I were observed on the days that the
4–10-year-olds ate breakfast, but no significant difference in
intakes of these micronutrients was noted for the 11–18-year-
olds. This suggests that more foods rich in these micronutrients
(e.g. fortified cereals, milk and fruit juice) are consumed for
breakfast in the younger compared with the older age group,
possibly due to greater parental supervision of the younger
children’s meals. A Spanish study of 8–17-year-old children
(n 4332) evaluating the utility of a breakfast quality index, in
which points were awarded for the consumption of cereals,
fruits, vegetables and dairy products at breakfast, found that the
score decreased with age (P = 0·001)(53). For the within-person
analyses including all diary days, intakes of Na are significantly
higher on no breakfast days for 4–18-year-olds and 11–18-year-
olds, but not 4–10-year-olds, suggesting that the older age group
may compensate for the lack of breakfast by the consumption of
salty snacks later in the day (protein intakes are also higher on
non-breakfast days for the older but not the younger group).
However this association was no longer significant when week-
end diary days were removed from the within-person analysis
(and is not present in the between-person analysis), so may
simply be a reflection of a different dietary pattern at weekends
(e.g. late or no breakfast with greater daily amounts of protein
rich and salty foods) in the older age group.
We did not find any evidence to support the oft-quoted
hypothesis that breakfast skipping leads to increased overall
daily energy intake due to compensatory overeating later in the
day(9,54). On the contrary, in our analyses we observed that
breakfast skipping was associated with either no difference or a
significantly lower daily energy intake. These results are in
accordance with those of most (but not all) recent observational
studies of children(9,18,20–22). Similarly, small cross-over trials in
children have reported no significant differences in overall daily
energy intakes on breakfast and non-breakfast days(55,56). The
findings on energy intake in this and other studies might sug-
gest caution when recommending breakfast consumption as a
weight management tool in children, despite the large body of
epidemiological evidence linking breakfast skipping and excess
weight in children. Also, they undermine the argument for a
causal link between breakfast skipping and overweight and
obesity based on excess energy intake. Interestingly, a large,
longitudinal US study of breakfast habits and weight gain in
9–14-year-olds found that, although breakfast skipping was
associated with higher BMI overall, overweight breakfast skip-
pers tended to lose weight over the study period compared with
overweight breakfast eaters, whereas the reverse was true for
normal weight breakfast skippers compared with normal
weight breakfast eaters(57). Alternative theories for the link
observed between adiposity and breakfast skipping include the
presence of confounding factors such as sleep duration and
circadian rhythms(12), and lower physical activity levels in
breakfast skippers(4,58,59).
The results of previous studies of children investigating the
effect on overall macronutrient profile of breakfast habit
vary(23). In this study small but statistically significant variations
in macronutrient profile were noted, with the proportion
of carbohydrate consumed generally higher for breakfast con-
sumers (for the between-person analysis) and on breakfast days
(for the within-person analysis), at the expense of either protein
or fat intake. However, no significant variations in macro-
nutrient profile when comparing intakes on breakfast days with
those on non-breakfast days were found for the within-person
analysis after weekend diary days had been removed from the
analysis. This may be due to a different dietary pattern for the
children at the weekend. In studies that have analysed breakfast
habit by type of breakfast consumed, different overall daily
nutrient intake profiles have been associated with different
breakfast types(20,22). For example, in a large US cross-sectional
study of breakfast consumption in 9–18-year-olds (n 9659),
consumers of ready-to-eat cereals had higher intakes of
carbohydrate and lower intakes of fat than breakfast skippers,
but for consumers of other types of breakfast there was no
significant difference in intakes of these macronutrients com-
pared with breakfast skippers(18).
No link was observed between overall NMES intake (as a
percentage of energy) and breakfast consumption. In the within-
person analysis we observed no significant difference in the
proportion of fat or NMES consumed between breakfast and non-
breakfast days, suggesting that intermittent breakfast skipping did
not lead to an increase in consumption of poor quality, high sugar
and high fat foods and beverages on non-breakfast days in this
study population, as has been postulated elsewhere(54).
In our analysis of the characteristics of the children in the
sample we found no significant differences in the proportion of
normal weight, overweight and obese children in each break-
fast habit category, which is at odds with the findings of some
but not all cross-sectional studies(4–7) in children. In line with
other studies in children(9,23,60,61), we observed higher levels of
breakfast skipping in girls and older children and lower mean
household incomes for breakfast skippers. There is evidence
that frequency of breakfast skipping in teenagers is related to
dieting and other weight-control behaviours(9), which may
explain its greater incidence in girls(62). A cross-sectional study
of UK 11–16-year-olds (n 1019) found that almost twice as
many girls reported dieting and those girls that were dieting
were three times more likely to skip breakfast than non-
dieters(63). In our study a significantly higher proportion of girls
in the 11–18-year-old age group stated that they were currently
dieting than boys. However, reported dieting behaviour did not
vary significantly with breakfast habit for the girls in our sample,
but this could be due to the smaller sample size (n 224)
resulting in lower statistical power (dieting data were only
available for the last 2 years of the NDNS RP 2008–2012).
The greater level of breakfast skipping among older children
may be influenced by a reduction in parental control enforcing
a ‘healthy’ breakfast habit. It may also reflect the shift in circa-
dian rhythms in adolescence to a later wake/sleep cycle(64).
During puberty an individual’s chronotype, that is their pre-
ference for an early or late wake/sleep cycle, shifts from early to
late, with sleep schedules moving progressively later between
the ages of 10 and 20 years(65). During the school week chil-
dren’s wake/sleep cycle is dictated by the school routine but at
the weekend the wake/sleep cycle is generally less restricted.
Breakfast and nutrient intakes in children

 A study of food logs of German adolescents (n 152, mean age
13·23 years) found that wake times at the weekend were on
average 2 h 40 min later, which translated to later breakfast
times: the average breakfast time on weekdays was 06.36 hours,
compared with 09.15 hours at weekends(66). Wake time data
were not available for the study sample, so in our analysis we
have defined breakfast in relation to a specific, fixed time
period, namely 06.00–08.59 hours, rather than relate it to intake
within a certain time of waking. However, because of this
weekend shift in breakfast times a meal eaten shortly after
waking may not fall within this fixed time period. To address
this issue, a separate within-person analysis was carried out
after removing weekend diary days.
Chronotype not only varies with age but it also depends on
genetic and environmental factors(65,67). Chronotype may be an
important confounding factor in the between-person analysis in
this and other studies. There is evidence that not only are
adolescents with later chronotypes more likely to skip break-
fast, they are also more likely to have poorer overall diets(66)
and lower levels of physical activity(68). The impact of chrono-
type and other possible residual confounding factors, which are
always an issue in cross-sectional studies, should be less of a
factor in the within- compared with the between-person
analysis. Adjustments have been made in the ANOVA for age,
sex, BMI, ethnicity and equivalised household income, how-
ever we were not able to adjust for physical activity level due to
lack of complete and consistent data across all ages(35).
We relied on data from 4-d estimated food diaries and an
objective definition of breakfast to categorise children by their
breakfast habit, rather than on responses to an eating habits
questionnaire. This avoids issues resulting from inconsistent
personal definitions of breakfast. Nevertheless, it is recognised
that the 418 kJ (100 kcal) threshold chosen for our definition of
breakfast is, to some extent, arbitrary. Also, the fixed time frame
we used to define breakfast may result in a late weekend
breakfast not being captured by the definition, however this
was allowed for in the within-person analysis by removing
weekend diary days.
In common with other dietary surveys, there is a possibility of
mis-reporting of dietary intakes. Doubly labelled water techni-
ques used in the NDNS RP to validate energy intakes for a
sample of survey participants suggest that under-reporting may
have been more prevalent for the children in the 11–18 years
age group, who completed their own food diaries, in contrast to
children in the younger age group, whose diaries were com-
pleted by their parents(69). The results of our sensitivity analysis
suggest that there were higher levels of mis-reporting in the
older age group. Where appropriate, to assess the impact of
mis-reporting we reran analyses omitting implausible reporters.
Many different methods of dietary data collection have been
used in previous studies of breakfast habits in children(23), with
varying degree of reliability. Strengths of our study include the
large sample size and the method of dietary assessment used,
namely a 4-d estimated food diary. In other recent cross-
sectional surveys of children’s breakfast habits and nutrient
intakes(18–22), the 24-h recall method was used, which relies
heavily on the accuracy of the child’s or their parent’s memory.
We are aware of two small cross-over studies involving US
children which report on the impact of breakfast skipping on
overall daily energy intake(55,56) but, to our knowledge, there
has not yet been a randomised, controlled trial assessing the
impact of breakfast consumption in children on intakes
of individual macro- and micronutrients. The approach we
adopted of approximating a cross-over study design (thereby
reducing residual confounding) in free living individuals by
conducting a within-person analysis of subjects with an irre-
gular breakfast habit has been carried out previously in
adults(70), but not children.
In our study we examined how macro- and micronutrient
intakes, plus energy intake, varied with children’s breakfast
habit. A possible topic for future research would be to look at
associations in UK children between breakfast habit and daily
intakes of specific foods, incorporating a diet quality index(71) to
further investigate associations between breakfast habit and
overall diet quality. It would also be interesting to investigate
how the quality of the breakfast foods consumed by UK chil-
dren varies with age, to ascertain if the differences we noted
between the two age groups in our within-person analysis
might be attributed to lower quality breakfasts in the older age
group. Work has already been carried out on developing
breakfast quality indices for use in relation to children and
adolescents in a Mediterranean setting(16,53,71); further work is
required to adapt these for use in a UK population.
In conclusion, the connection between the consumption of
breakfast and good health appears to involve many different
factors, and is still some way from being fully elucidated.
A causal link with obesity is, as yet, unsupported by the avail-
able evidence(72). However, this study adds to the existing body
of data linking breakfast consumption with higher quality
dietary intake in school-age children, particularly the 4–10 years
age group, supporting the promotion of breakfast as an
important element of a healthy dietary pattern in children.
