Postaxial type B polydactyly is the presence of a supernumerary digit
attached by soft tissue in a pedunculated fashion to the fifth digit. In the
present case, a newborn with bilateral postaxial type B polydactyly under-
went suture ligation to remove the supernumerary digit, but multiple ligation
attempts were required. Ultimately, residual tissue remained bilaterally, but it
did not seem to be painful. A comprehensive review of the literature revealed
no clear recommendation on treatment options for patients with postaxial
polydactyly. Although suture ligation has been common practice, surgical
excision is an acceptable option that can be performed in the neonatal unit
and may result in fewer complications than suture ligation.

P
ostaxial polydactyly is the duplication of the fifth digit and includes supernumer-
ary digits that are fully developed with bone and neural tissue (type A) or that are
attached only by soft tissue (type B).1 Supernumerary digits should be evaluated
with electromagnetic radiography as part of the initial step in the diagnosis of polydactyly.2
Although the exact incidence is not known, to our knowledge, a study suggests that poly-
dactyly is present in 1 in 1000 births in the general population, with a higher incidence of 1
in 150 births in the black population.3,4 Eighty-five percent of cases have a positive family
history, and 75% are bilateral.4 Physicians overseeing a neonatal unit will likely encounter
polydactyly and be challenged with the task of deciding on a treatment option. This report
describes the case of a newborn with bilateral postaxial type B polydactyly and provides a
short literature review of treatment options for patients with postaxial polydactyly.
Report of Case
A black male was born to a 34-year-old gravida 5 para 3 mother via spontaneous vaginal
delivery at 39 weeks’ gestational age. The pregnancy and delivery were unremarkable, with
Apgar scores of 9 at both 1 and 5 minutes. On examination in the neonatal unit, postaxial
type B polydactyly was discovered on both of the newborn’s hands. The mother reported
that she was born with the same condition and underwent suture ligation as a newborn. She
reported that she was left with approximately 2 mm of residual tissue bilaterally, which she
denied as bothering her cosmetically or physically. Four days after birth, the newborn under-
went suture ligation of both supernumerary digits at the recommendation of the orthopedic
surgeon. At a follow-up appointment 1 week later, the left digit had fully necrosed, but the

 right digit had not. The right digit was ligated again and
fell off 9 days later. At a follow-up appointment at age
2 months, the patient was found to have residual tissue
bilaterally (approximately 2 mm), which did not appear
to cause any discomfort.
Discussion of Treatment Options
When treating patients with postaxial type B polydac-
tyly, goals include complete removal of excess tissue,
prevention of neuroma, minimization of cosmetically
displeasing residual tissue, and avoidance of common
adverse outcomes (eg, infection, bleeding, complications
caused by anesthesia).5 We believe optimization of out-
comes requires proper classification of polydactyly into
subgroups for which an optimal treatment has been iden-
tified. Few studies have documented outcomes of the
various treatments for type B polydactyly, and no defini-
tive clinical guidelines have been provided by a major
organization. Although suture ligation has been com-
monly taught to primary care physicians, no evidence-
based standard of care for management of type B poly-
dactyly and no clear evidence that suture ligation is the
most effective treatment exists, to our knowledge.
A PubMed literature review using the combination of
terms “neonate,” “supernumerary digit,” and “treatment”
was conducted. References of relevant articles were also
reviewed for potentially important literature. This search
revealed 6 cohort studies discussing various treatment
modalities for postaxial type B polydactyly, including
excision under topical or general anesthesia, suture liga-
tion, and surgical clip ligation.
The most common treatment for patients with postax-
ial type B polydactyly is suture ligation, which is typic-
ally done in the neonatal unit.1 However, suture ligation
may not always be the best management option. One
cohort study4 screened 21 newborns (37 supernumerary
digits) with postaxial type B polydactyly who underwent
suture ligation at the base of the pedicle. This treatment
was unsuccessful in 1 newborn, whose digit failed to
necrose properly. Twenty-one of the 37 sites (43%) that
were reexamined at an average age of 20 months were
found to have residual tissue.4 Although suture ligation
has been touted as simple, safe, and effective,2,6 limited
evidence shows that it can lead to a greater likelihood of
incomplete
amputation
than
surgical
excision.4
Furthermore, suture ligation may be more likely to lead
to painful neuromas than surgical excision; Leber and
Gosain5 suggest that the incidence of painful neuroma
caused by suture ligation may be higher than previously
thought, resulting from underreporting by patients or
their guardians. These unsatisfactory outcomes affect
quality of life and require additional, more elaborate pro-
cedures to resolve. Incomplete amputation with ligation
is more likely when the base of the supernumerary digit
is greater than 2 mm.7
Surgical excision for patients with type B polydactyly
is another option for the removal of supernumerary
digits. Research has shown that this treatment option
can be more advantageous than suture ligation in the
neonatal unit. A prospective study evaluated the results
of surgical excision of supernumerary digits in patients
with postaxial type B polydactyly using topical anesthe-
sia in 11 consecutive infants (15 supernumerary digits)
2 to 3 days after birth. No complications were reported,
and the site of excision was “barely seen” 1 year after
the procedure.1 A retrospective study8 examined 32
patients (53 supernumerary digits) with type A or type
B polydactyly who underwent oval excision with
general anesthesia at an average age of 8.6 months
(range 0-10 years). Of the 32 patients, minor complica-
tions developed in 4 patients (ie, hypertrophic scar and
superficial wound infection), and 1 patient had a painful
neuroma that needed a revision 3 years later. Of the 20
patients seen at follow-up (a mean of 4.9 years after the
excision), 18 (90%) had a flat scar and 2 (10%) had
painful residual tissue.8 Overall satisfaction was 89 out
of 100 (100 being the most satisfied).8 A case series7
examined 10 patients (13 supernumerary digits) ranging
in age from 1 week to 13 years who had previously
undergone suture ligation that resulted in complications,
including painful neuromas and incomplete excisions.
All patients were successfully treated with amputation
of the residual tissue and proximal ligation of the

 supernumerary digit nerve. Another case series5 divided
patients with postaxial type B polydactyly into 2 groups
to be treated for supernumerary digits or their sequelae.
One group was made up of 3 patients with traumatic
amputation neuromas (5 traumatic amputation neuromas
combined) caused by suture ligation of accessory digits
in infancy, and the second group consisted of 6 patients
(12 supernumerary digits) presenting with untreated
postaxial type B polydactyly. Both groups underwent
elliptical surgical excision under general anesthesia, and
at a 6-year follow-up, no complications occurred in
either of the patient groups.
Mullick and Borschel7 stated that surgical excision
was preferable over suture ligation in any digit with a
bony or ligamentous attachment or presence of a wide
base to prevent incomplete amputation or painful
neuroma. This procedure can be done in the neonatal
unit under topical or local anesthesia, but they recom-
mend that infants older than 3 months be referred for
excision using general anesthesia.7 Katz and Linder1
also recommend surgical excision using topical anesthe-
sia rather than suture ligation. Leber and Gosain5 argued
for surgical excision to prevent painful neuromas,
describing a more complex procedure using general
anesthesia. In 1995, Frieden et al9 argued that there is
little evidence to support the rationale behind suture liga-
tion and that it should be abandoned because of variation
in supernumerary digit size, possible presence of bone,
and the increased risk of infection, scarring, and incom-
plete removal. They recommended that supernumerary
digits be infiltrated with a local anesthetic at the base,
and the lesion should be surgically excised via sterile
scissors, which would minimize the potential for infec-
tion, ongoing inflammation, pain, and slow healing that
may occur after suture ligation.9
Another option for removing supernumerary digits in
patients with postaxial polydactyly is surgical clip ligation,
which is similar to suture ligation. A retrospective study10
that examined 132 infants with extra digits with a flat base
(<6 mm) who underwent surgical clip ligation found no
immediate complications; however, 7% of patients had
painful neuromas that required surgical revision.
Conclusion
Surgical excision using local or topical anesthesia is
often preferable to suture ligation for the removal of
supernumerary digits with a base between 2 mm and 6
mm. Suture ligation is as effective as surgical excision
on lesions smaller than 2 mm. Contraindications to
treatment by primary care physicians in the neonatal
unit include wide-based, bony, or ligamentous attach-
ments. Additional prospective studies comparing treat-
ment techniques for patients with postaxial polydactyly
are needed.
