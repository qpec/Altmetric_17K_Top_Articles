Background-—Individuals who exhibit large-magnitude blood pressure (BP) reactions to acute psychological stressors are at risk for
hypertension and premature death by cardiovascular disease. This study tested whether a multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked
brain activity could reliably predict individual differences in BP reactivity, providing novel evidence for a candidate
neurophysiological source of stress-related cardiovascular risk.
Methods and Results-—Community-dwelling adults (N=310; 30–51 years; 153 women) underwent functional magnetic resonance
imaging with concurrent BP monitoring while completing a standardized battery of stressor tasks. Across individuals, the battery
evoked an increase systolic and diastolic BP relative to a nonstressor baseline period (M Δsystolic BP/Δdiastolic BP=4.3/
1.9 mm Hg [95% confidence interval=3.7–5.0/1.4–2.3 mm Hg]). Using cross-validation and machine learning approaches,
including dimensionality reduction and linear shrinkage models, a multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked functional magnetic
resonance imaging activity was identified in a training subsample (N=206). This multivariate pattern reliably predicted both systolic
BP (r=0.32; P<0.005) and diastolic BP (r=0.25; P<0.01) reactivity in an independent subsample used for testing and replication
(N=104). Brain areas encompassed by the pattern that were strongly predictive included those implicated in psychological stressor
processing and cardiovascular responding through autonomic pathways, including the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate
cortex, and insula.
Conclusions-—A novel multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked brain activity may comprise a phenotype that partly accounts for
individual differences in BP reactivity, a stress-related cardiovascular risk factor. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e006053. DOI: 10.

Key Words: cardiovascular reactivity • functional magnetic resonance imaging • machine learning • mental stress • psychology
and behavior • stress
A
cute psychological stressors evoke rapid cardiovascular
reactions, including rises in heart rate (HR) and blood
pressure (BP). These stressor-evoked reactions provide pre-
sumptive hemodynamic and metabolic support for adaptive
and
defensive
behavioral
action
(eg,
fight-or-flight).1
Individuals differ, however, in the extent to which they exhibit
stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity. Some have a reli-
able tendency to exhibit large-magnitude, or “exaggerated,”
stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactions that disproportion-
ately exceed the metabolic demands engendered by a given
psychological stressor.2–4 Compared with their less reactive
counterparts, individuals exhibiting a phenotype for exagger-
ated stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity—especially BP
reactivity—are at greater risk for future hypertension, an
accelerated progression of preclinical atherosclerosis, and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.5–7 Moreover, the risk
conferred by stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity is
unaccounted for by conventional risk factors for CVD.5
Accordingly, understanding the sources of stressor-evoked
cardiovascular reactivity is relevant for determining the
mechanisms of stress-related CVD risk.
Acute stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactions arise from
proximal changes in autonomic nervous system outflow to the
heart and vasculature, typified by increases in the activity of
the sympathetic limb and decreases in the parasympathetic
limb of the autonomic nervous system.8 These autonomic
changes are generated and regulated by evolutionarily

 conserved brain areas.9–11 Collectively, these areas are
referred to as a “central autonomic network” or, more
inclusively, as brain areas for visceral control.12–14 Based on
human functional neuroimaging research, animal models, and
patient lesion studies, brain areas for visceral control
encompass cell groups within the medial and orbital pre-
frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, hippocampus,
extended amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal
gray, pons, and medulla.13,15–19 Distributed patterns of neural
signaling among these brain areas regulate autonomic
nervous system activity to coordinate hemodynamic function
with behavior across a range of contexts and experiences,
especially those that are appraised by individuals as psycho-
logically stressful.13 In this regard, brain areas for visceral
control may provide a substrate for centrally orchestrating
behavioral and stress-related influences on CVD risk through
autonomic and hemodynamic mechanisms. An expanding
corpus of research supports this possibility: Patterns of
functional activity within brain areas for visceral control have
been related in meta-analyses of human neuroimaging studies
to stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity, as well as
indicators of autonomic cardiovascular control and other
systemic physiological markers of CVD risk.12,13,18,19 Thus,
individual differences in the functionality of brain areas for
visceral control may correspond to a central nervous system
source of variability in stressor-evoked cardiovascular reac-
tivity and possible vulnerability to stress-related CVD risk.
At
present,
however,
there
are
several
problematic
features of existing human neuroimaging studies on the
putative central nervous system (brain) bases of individual
differences in stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity (eg,
BP reactivity). These features not only limit our understanding
of the brain mechanisms of stressor-evoked cardiovascular
reactivity, but also the broader clinical and translational use of
functional neuroimaging methods in stress-related CVD
research. Specifically, neuroimaging methods, particularly
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are well suited
for testing whether variability in stressor-evoked cardiovas-
cular reactivity is predicted by variability in brain activation to
psychological stressors. Precisely determining this “brain-
body” or “brain-physiology” relationship, however, requires
moving beyond standard neuroimaging analysis approaches.
First and foremost, typical fMRI analysis approaches test the
degree to which a location in the brain (eg, a voxel) is active,
given that a particular feature variable is present (eg, the
likelihood of a voxel changing in activity given the presence of
a stressor).20 This approach, however, suffers from 2 critical
problems: First, the analysis is typically implemented on a
voxel-by-voxel basis, resulting in a massive multiple statistical
testing problem when applied to all voxels in the brain.
Second, in the context of predicting a given response (eg, BP
reactivity) from brain activity, the direction of the statistical
problem needs to be reversed: Hence, the analysis must
determine the likelihood of a response variable, such as BP
reactivity, given a collection of voxel activity patterns
distributed across the brain. Critically, this reversal dramat-
ically increases the dimensionality of the problem, because
the number of voxels measured in the brain (ie, predictor
variables) is much larger than the typical number of partic-
ipants in most fMRI studies. Another limitation of conven-
tional fMRI analytics is that they rarely test the predictive
utility of a given model on an independent test sample. This
undermines the ability to determine whether an observed
brain-physiology association will generalize to different groups
of people, which, in turn, constrains inferences about
reliability, generalizability, and the magnitude of effect sizes
across contexts.21,22 Overcoming these limitations in con-
ventional fMRI analysis with multivariate and cross-validation
methods, however, allows for identifying generalizable “brain
phenotypes” for stressor-evoked BP reactivity that could be
broadly applied and tested in future translational research on
at-risk individuals and clinical patient samples.
In the present study, we thus used a whole-brain and
pattern-based machine learning approach in a sample of over
300 midlife adults who completed a standardized stressor
battery during neuroimaging by fMRI with simultaneous BP
monitoring. Using a cross-validation approach, we first
derived a multivariate model that was trained to predict BP
reactivity from stressor-evoked fMRI activity across the entire
brain in a subsample of 206 participants. This approach
combined principal component analysis and a least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to
accommodate the high dimensionality of the prediction
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• People with a tendency to exhibit exaggerated (metaboli-
cally excessive) blood pressure reactions to psychological
stressors are at risk for hypertension, adverse clinical
cardiovascular
events,
and
premature
cardiovascular
mortality.
• Exaggerated blood pressure reactions to psychological
stressors may be determined, in part, by a “brain pheno-
type” that is characterized by reliable neural activity
changes in brain areas that regulate cardiovascular physi-
ology during stressful experiences.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Brain phenotypes determined by neuroimaging methodolo-
gies could be used in translational efforts to better monitor,
predict, and possibly reduce stress-related risk for cardio-
vascular disease.

 problem (ie, a large number of predictors relative to the
sample size). This LASSO/principal components regression
approach produced a unique multivariate brain pattern, a
brain phenotype map, that reflected each voxel’s multivariate
and weighted contribution to predicting BP reactivity. To test
for generalizability, reliability, and accuracy of the trained
model, the multivariate brain pattern was then used to predict
BP reactivity in a separate subsample of 104 participants who
were not used for training. Finally, we tested the performance
of the multivariate pattern to explicitly predict BP reactivity
and not other (eg, behavioral, self-report) dimensions of acute
stress reactivity. To our awareness, this is the largest
neurophysiological study of stressor-evoked BP reactivity
and the first to apply cross-validation methods to characterize
a putative brain phenotype for this particular stress-related
predictor of CVD risk.
Methods
Participants
Participants were 331 men (N=165) and women (N=166)
aged 30 to 51 years from the Pittsburgh Imaging Project
(PIP), an ongoing longitudinal study of the neurophysiological
correlates of CVD risk. Here we report results from planned (a
priori) tests of baseline associations between fMRI activity
and stressor-evoked BP reactivity. Future planned reports will
focus on fMRI activity and the longitudinal progression of
preclinical CVD risk factors. Exclusionary criteria included: (1)
any history of clinical CVD or a CVD event (including stage II
hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart
failure, or arrhythmia); (2) cardiovascular surgery; (3) cancer, a
chronic kidney or liver condition, type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus,
or any pulmonary or respiratory disease; (4) current or past
psychiatric diagnoses of substance abuse or mood disorders;
(5) cerebrovascular trauma; (6) neurosurgery or any neuro-
logical condition; (7) pregnancy (verified by urine test in
females); (8) color-blindness; (9) claustrophobia; (10) ferro-
magnetic implants; or (11) any use of psychotropic, lipid-
lowering, weight loss, insulin, glucocorticoid, hypoglycemic, or
cardiovascular medications. All participants provided their
informed consent to complete study protocols, which were
approved by the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA)
Institutional Review Board.
Recruitment and Missing Data
Mass mailings were used to recruit community-dwelling adults
residing in southwestern Pennsylvania from August 2008 to
October 2014, and data collection for measures in the current
report spanned this time period. Initial phone screening of
those responding to the mailings yielded 754 potentially
eligible respondents, of whom 460 appeared for in-person
screening. Of these, 129 were ineligible, declined to partic-
ipate before consenting, or withdrew because of de novo
ineligibility or personal reasons (eg, pregnancy, residential
relocation, etc). This resulted in a final sample of 331
individuals who completed all baseline assessment protocols.
After quality-control review, 157 men and 153 women were
determined to have complete and useable data, for an
effective analytic sample of N=310 in the current report.
Reasons for exclusion included unusable fMRI imaging data
(eg, because of excessive movement artifacts), failure to
comply with study protocols, and data acquisition failure
during cardiovascular monitoring. There were no statistically
significant differences in the demographic composition (ie,
age, sex, race, and self-reported ethnicity) of those comprising
the analytical sample (N=310) and those with missing data
(N=21). Table provides summary characteristics of the
analytical study sample.
MRI Protocol
Participants refrained from eating, exercising, and consuming
caffeinated and tobacco products, as well as drinking
alcoholic beverages, for at least 8 hours before MRI testing
in the morning (7:00 to 11:00 AM). At testing, they underwent
a medical history and screening interview, followed by a blood
draw to assess fasting serum markers of CVD risk (ie, glucose,
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein levels, and triglyc-
eride concentrations), as well as anthropometric measures
(eg, height, weight, and waist circumference), demographic
and psychosocial information, and seated BP (see Table for
descriptive statistics). Thereafter, participants were provided
with instructions about the MRI tasks described below, and
they practiced these tasks before MRI. For MRI, participants
were first fitted with a BP cuff matched to arm size, inserted
into the MRI scanner, and asked to rest for �20 minutes.
Participants then completed 2 stressor tasks with concurrent
functional MRI (fMRI) and BP monitoring (see below).
MRI Data Acquisition
MRI data were acquired on a 3 Tesla Trio TIM whole-body
scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), equipped with a
12-channel head coil. Functional blood-oxygen-level–depen-
dent (BOLD) images were acquired with a gradient echo-planar
imaging sequence by these parameters: time to repetition/
time to echo=2000/28 ms; matrix resolution=64964; field of
view=2059250 mm; slice thickness=3 mm (no gap); and flip
angle=90°. For anatomical coregistration of fMRI images and
assessments of brain morphology, T1-weighted 3-dimensional
magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo neuroanatomical
images were acquired by these parameters: time to repetition/

 time to echo=2100/3.29 ms; time to inversion=1100 ms;
matrix resolution=2569208; field of view=2569208 mm;
slice thickness=1 mm (no gap); flip angle=8°. Resting cerebral
blood flow (CBF) images were acquired with a pulsed arterial
spin-labeling sequence using a flow-sensitive alternating inver-
sion recovery method,23 specifically applying a saturation pulse
700 ms after an inversion pulse. To reduce transit artifacts, a
1000-ms delay separated the end of the labeling pulse and the
time of image acquisition. Resting cerebral blood flow

acquisition
parameters
were:
field
of
view=2409240 mm; matrix size=64964; time to repeti-
tion=4 seconds; time to echo=18 ms; and flip angle=90°.
Twenty-one slices (5 mm thick, 1 mm gap) were acquired
sequentially in an inferior-to-superior direction, yielding 80 total
CBF images (40 labeled, 40 unlabeled; 2 initial discarded
images allowing for magnetic equilibration).
fMRI Stressor Battery
The stressor battery is publically available at http://bnl.
pitt.edu/resources.html and has been detailed.24 The battery
includes a Stroop task and a modified Multi-Source Interfer-
ence Task (MSIT). Both entail conflict, negative feedback, and
responding under time pressure to unpredictable and uncon-
trollable stimuli, modeling canonical elements of a stressful
experience.13 Briefly, participants completed 4, 52- to 60-
second blocks of trials in both tasks defining a congruent
condition, which were interleaved with 4, 52- to 60-second
blocks of trials defining an incongruent condition. Conditions
were preceded by a 10- to 17-second fixation period. In the
Stroop, participants selected colors of target words by
choosing 1 of 4 identifier words using buttons on a glove
that matched identifier words on the screen (eg, thumb button
1=word on left, etc). For congruent trials: (1) targets were in
colors congruent with target words, and (2) identifiers were in
the same colors as targets. For incongruent trials: (1) targets

 were in colors incongruent with targets, and (2) identifiers
were in colors incongruent with colors that the identifiers
name. In the MSIT, participants selected a number that
differed from 2 others by pressing 1 of 3 buttons on the glove
that matched a number on the screen (thumb button
1=number 1, etc). For congruent trials, target positions were
compatible with their glove positions. For incongruent trials,
target positions were incompatible with their glove positions.
In incongruent conditions of both tasks, accuracy was titrated
by altering intertrial intervals to control for individual differ-
ences in task engagement. Thus, consecutive accurate
choices shortened intertrial intervals. To control for motor
response differences between conditions, the number of trials
in the congruent condition was yoked to total completed in
the incongruent condition. For yoking, (1) an incongruent
block was run first and (2) congruent condition trials appeared
at the mean intertrial interval of the previous incongruent
block. During the practice protocol before MRI, there was no
performance titration or yoking implemented for either task to
reduce the likelihood of habituation. We have previously
established that this battery evokes reliable individual differ-
ences in cardiovascular, self-report, and functional neural
responding over a period of �88 days, with test-retest
reliability coefficients of 0.57 to 0.87 across domains of
stressor responding.24
Stressor Battery Performance and Subjective
Ratings
Task performance (accuracy) during the battery was com-
puted as the percentage of trials correctly completed. Post
hoc, we confirmed the successful titration of accuracy: Mean
accuracy during the incongruent condition of the tasks was
titrated across participants to 56.1% (�9.1% SD), and mean
accuracy increased by 31.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]
=30.7–33.1) during the congruent condition (see Table for
descriptive statistics for each task). In this way, individual
differences in task performance were experimentally con-
trolled.
In
conjunction
with
titration-induced
accuracy
changes, mean response times to trials delivered during the
incongruent condition compared with the congruent condition
of each task were slowed by an average of 106 ms (95%
CI=86.6–125.6). To assess ratings of valence (1=very pleas-
ant; 9=very unpleasant) and arousal (1=very calm; 9=very
aroused), participants completed a modified Self-Assessment
Manikin scale25 after the resting (prestressor) period and
each task. As a manipulation check, we verified that
participants reported feeling less pleasant and more aroused
during the tasks (paired t test t-values ranged from 10.3 to
19.4; Ps≤0.001). For ancillary analyses, participants also
completed psychosocial inventories to assess suspected
correlates of CVD risk, namely: depressive symptoms by the
Beck Depression Inventory-II26; dispositional anxiety by the
State-Trait Anxiety Index27; and hostility by the Cook-Medley
Hostility Inventory.28,29
Cardiovascular Monitoring and BP
Participants’ average seated resting BP was systolic BP/
diastolic
BP
(SBP/DBP)=120.6/72.4 mm Hg
(�9.8/
8.5 mm Hg SD), as determined by the mean of the last 2
BP readings obtained on 2 separate testing visits with an
oscillometric device (Critikon Dinamap 8100; Johnson &
Johnson, Tampa, FL) and taken 2 minutes apart after a 20-
minute acclimation period (BP cuffs matched to arm size).
During MRI, participants’ BP and HR were measured during
the resting (prestressor) and stressor battery periods from the
brachial artery of the arm that was not used for task
responding. All participants used their right hand to complete
the tasks and provide ratings. There were 3 participants who
were identified as left-handed, as verified by the Edinburgh
Handedness Questionnaire.30 Before testing, these partici-
pants reported that they were able to use the right-hand
response glove for the task protocol. For protocol consistency
across participants, they were allowed to do so, and we
recorded BP from their left arm. By independent-samples
t tests, their task performance (accuracy, reaction time) and
cardiovascular (SBP, DBP, and HR) reactivity did not differ
significantly from the rest of the sample (all Ps>0.423). BP
measurements were obtained with an oscillometric device
(Multigas 9500; MedRad Inc., Warrendale, PA), set to inflate
every 2.5 minutes during the prestressor period and once
during each condition of the Stroop task and MSIT. To
compute prestressor BP and HR, the final 3 measurements
from the prestressor period were averaged. The incongruent
condition—minus—resting BP/HR change scores (DBP, DHR)
were used to compute cardiovascular reactivity to match our
previous work.31,32 These change (reactivity) scores averaged
over the Stroop and MSIT tasks were used in analyses given
the high correlations between task reactivity scores (Fig-
ure 1).
MRI Data Processing
BOLD fMRI data from the Stroop and MSIT tasks were
processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) soft-
ware, version 8 (SPM8; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).
For each task, the time series of 280 volumes of BOLD
images were realigned to the first image, corrected for
motion distortion, and normalized to Montreal Neurological
Institute space. Normalized images were rescaled (2-mm
isotropic voxels) and smoothed with a 6-mm full width at half
maximum Gaussian kernel. At the individual level, incongru-
ent versus congruent condition task effects on fMRI signal

 changes were estimated by general linear modeling, in which
the conditions were modeled by boxcar functions convolved
with the default hemodynamic response function. Motion
parameters generated from realignment were also included
as covariates at the individual level to account for nuisance
variance in the BOLD signal attributable to head movement.
Before general linear modelings, a high-pass filter of 187
seconds was applied to the fMRI BOLD signal time series to
filter low-frequency artifacts. All images were screened using
the Artifact Detection Toolbox (ART; http://web.mit.edu/
swg/software.htm), including screening for movement arti-
fact and signal loss. Covariation between task conditions and
movement parameters was also tested to ensure that
condition effects were not confounded with movement: We
observed no statistically significant correlations (all Ps>0.30).
Finally, to minimize the contribution of any extreme values in
the fMRI BOLD signal time series, we implemented the
weighted
least-squares
algorithm
using
the
RobustWLS
toolbox in SPM8.33
Stressor-evoked brain activation was estimated by the
statistical contrast of BOLD signal activity during the incon-
gruent versus congruent condition in each task of the stressor
battery. Resulting contrast maps were then averaged over the
2 tasks to conform with previous work, match the cardiovas-
cular reactivity computation approach described above,
minimize
measurement
error,
and
increase
reliability.24
Accordingly, we verified the spatial similarity of the Stroop
and MSIT contrast maps by the Dice coefficient, as well as the
correlation of BOLD signal values from the 2 contrast maps.
Before statistical analysis, individual-level and task-averaged
contrast maps were masked by the SPM 25% gray matter
probability map.
Multivariate Analysis of fMRI Data
We used machine learning to test the predictive association
between stressor-evoked brain activity changes and stressor-
evoked BP reactivity. In this approach, stressor-evoked brain
activity in all gray matter voxels from the task-averaged
contrast maps served as a multivariate predictor, with
stressor-evoked SBP reactivity (DSBP) as the primary depen-
dent variable. SBP reactivity was selected because of evidence
that it is the parameter of cardiovascular stress reactivity most
strongly related to CVD risk.7,34 Conventionally, the predictive
model would be as follows: Yn91=Xn9mbm91+en91, where en91
is a random error of N (0, r2In91), Yn91 is the dependent
variable (ΔSBP), and Xn9m is the matrix of concatenated
incongruent versus congruent contrast maps of n participants
with m voxels. In this model, bm91 corresponds to a whole-brain
weight map of the effect of brain activity change in each voxel
on the dependent variable (ΔSBP). This weight map would then
be used to predict observations of the dependent variable in a
new sample, ^
Ynew ¼ Xnew^
b. However, because the sample size,
n, is appreciably smaller than the number of predictors (voxels
across the brain), v, the model engenders overfitting and
limited accuracy in prediction because of high dimensional-
ity.35 In addition, predictors (eg, neighboring voxel-by-voxel
stressor-evoked brain activity changes) may be correlated,
resulting in multicollinearity. Given these limitations, we used
a LASSO/principal components regression approach specifi-
cally designed for high-dimensional prediction problems along
with cross-validation36 to develop and train an initial multi-
variate model (multivariate brain pattern) and then test the
performance of the pattern in a separate hold-out group (test
sample) of participants (see Figure S1).

 By this approach, two thirds of the participants (N=206)
were randomly selected with stratification over the ΔSBP
distribution for initial training and cross-validation of the
multivariate brain pattern. Data from remaining participants
(N=104) who were not used for training were subsequently
used for testing prediction performance (ie, the test sample).
The training and test samples did not differ significantly in any
of the demographic, anthropometric, biological, psychosocial,
or task-related variables reported in Table (all Ps>0.14 by
independent-sample t tests and chi-square analyses). The
training and test samples also did not differ significantly in
stressor-evoked SBP, DBP, or HR reactivity (all Ps>0.31 by
independent-sample t tests). Table S1 provides comparisons
of the 2 samples.
In application of LASSO/principal components regression,
the multivariate predictor matrix X was created in the training
subsample, and it was then decomposed into 3 matrices,
X ¼ U P V0
by singular value decomposition. Matrix V
contains the orthonormal eigenvectors of the covariance
matrix, X0X, that form the orthogonal basis. The principal
components here correspond to the projection of X on the
eigenvector space, namely, P=XV, which preserves the
variance of X and reduces dimensionality. We then regressed
Y on P using LASSO with a regularization (shrinkage)
parameter, k. Specifically, we applied the least-angle regres-
sion algorithm37,38 to find the value of b that minimizes the
cost function, f ¼ jjY � Pbjj2
2 þ kjjbjj1. The regularization
parameter, k, controls the selection of variables (ie, principal
components) in the regression model, wherein a larger k
forces more coefficients in the regression model to be 0 and
reduces (shrinks) the number of predictor variables.
During training, we applied 10-fold cross-validation to
select the best k and hence the principal components, P*,
that yielded the smallest root mean square error. The root
mean square error for each k was calculated from the residual
sum of squares of the 10 validation data sets (each with
Ns=20 or 21) in the 10 training models (each with Ns=185 or
186). Once the variables (principal components), P*, were
selected, the coefficients of the selected principal compo-
nents, ^
b�
n�1, were estimated by a linear least square
regression of stressor-evoked SBP reactivity (ΔSBP) on the
selected principal components using the training sample
(N=206).
The best fitting model in principal components space, ^
b�
n�1,
was then projected back into voxel space using the unitary
matrix, V, such that ^
bm�1 ¼ Vm�n^
b�
n�1. Here, ^
b represents a
weight map of the entire brain (multivariate brain pattern)
reflecting how activity changes in individual voxels simulta-
neously contribute to the prediction of SBP reactivity. Thus, in
order to predict stressor-evoked SBP reactivity in the hold-out
test sample, we multiplied ^
b by Xtest, which is an mxv matrix
of stressor-evoked fMRI activity changes, where m=104. The
resulting ^
Ytest vector provides a blind prediction of SBP
reactivity for all m participants in the hold-out test sample.
The predictive utility of the multivariate brain pattern (^
b) was
then determined as the correlation between observed and
predicted SBP reactivity in the hold-out test sample.
In addition to predicting individual differences in stressor-
evoked SBP reactivity, we computed receiver operation curve
metrics to test the performance of the multivariate brain
pattern (^
b) in detecting “cut-off” or threshold SBP reactivity
values. This enabled us to evaluate the sensitivity and
specificity of predicting different levels of SBP reactivity
across individuals. In a set of additional tests, we examined
whether the whole-brain, multivariate pattern, ^
b, would
predict individual differences in self-reported affective or
arousal changes, as well as behavioral task performance.
Finally, we tested whether ^
b would outperform another widely
used multivariate brain pattern developed for the prediction of
an aversive behavioral state plausibly related to the experi-
ence of stress; namely, pain.39 If our multivariate brain
pattern, but not 1 for pain, predicts SBP reactivity, then this
would provide a line of discriminative evidence that our
multivariate brain pattern uniquely accounts for individual
differences in a dimension of cardiovascular stress reactivity.
Ancillary Analyses
In a series of ancillary analyses, we examined the extent to
which stressor-evoked BP reactivity was associated with
individual differences in psychosocial and demographic fac-
tors, as well as possible fMRI confounders or interindividual
variation in putative brain correlates of CVD risk: CBF and
brain morphology. Total CBF (mL/100 g per minute) was
computed according to previously detailed methods by our
group40 from arterial spin-labeling MRI data. Total volumes of
gray matter, white matter, and cerebral spinal fluid compart-
ments were computed from structural T1-weighted MRI data
using the FreeSurfer 5.3.0 software package (http://surfer.
nmr.mgh.harvard.edu).
Statistical Significance
A statistical significance threshold of P<0.05 was adopted
and 95% CIs were applied, where applicable.

CI=2.89–4.08/0.91–1.85]). The incongruent condition of the
2 tasks also increased average HR (M Stroop ΔHR=8.11 bpm
[95% CI=7.43–8.82] and M MSIT ΔHR=6.16 bpm [95%
CI=5.59–6.74]). As shown in Figure 1, there were individual
differences in reactivity (changes from baseline) for both BP
and HR; however, these individual differences in reactivity
were strongly correlated across the 2 tasks (rs=0.78, 0.72,
and 0.78 for ΔSBP, ΔDBP, and ΔHR, respectively; all
Ps<0.001). We thus averaged reactivity estimates across
tasks for subsequent analyses to minimize error and better
estimate stable (phenotypic) individual differences in stressor-
evoked cardiovascular reactivity.41
Stressor-Evoked Functional Neural Activity
The Stroop task and MSIT engaged spatially overlapping
(comparable) brain areas, as revealed by the incongruent
versus congruent condition contrasts of BOLD signal activity
(Dice coefficient for spatial similarity=0.80; see Figure 2). We
note that the directions of BOLD signal changes (positive and
negative) revealed by the incongruent versus congruent
condition contrasts agree with those observed in other
cognitively demanding fMRI stressors cf.,42 including BOLD
signal changes in areas that have been implicated in stressor
processing and cardiovascular control by autonomic pathways
(ie, medial and orbital prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate
cortex, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, periaque-
ductal gray, and pons; see Table S2).13 In parallel to findings
for cardiovascular reactivity estimates above, voxel-wise fMRI
BOLD signal changes for the incongruent versus congruent
condition contrasts were strongly correlated across individu-
als
(voxel-by-voxel
r
across
tasks=0.88;
P<0.0001).
Accordingly, and consistent with previous work, task-aver-
aged incongruent versus congruent condition contrast maps
were used in subsequent analyses (see Figure 2C).
A Multivariate Brain Pattern (Phenotype) for SBP
Reactivity
In a training sample (N=206), a 10-fold, cross-validation
procedure yielded a multivariate (voxel-wise) brain pattern (^
b)
of stressor-evoked brain activity (incongruent versus congru-
ent activity change) that predicted individual differences in
SBP reactivity (ΔSBP; k=0.33; root mean square error=5.58;
70 principal components retained after training). Figure 3A
shows the whole-brain, predictive pattern learned on the
training sample. In cross-validation, the ability of this multi-
variate brain pattern to predict stressor-evoked SBP reactivity
was then determined by using the pattern to predict ΔSBP in
the test sample (N=104). In this independent test sample, the
brain pattern accounted for �9% of the variance in stressor-
evoked SBP reactivity across individuals (r=0.32; P<0.005;
Figure 3B). For illustration purposes, Figure 4 provides sur-
face projections of brain areas along the medial wall and insula
within the whole-brain multivariate pattern (which was used
for prediction) that exhibited relatively stronger associations
with ΔSBP across individuals, as determined by nonparametric
permutation testing (see Tables S3 and S4 for detailed listing
of areas). Again, we note that the whole-brain pattern was
used for prediction and cross-validation testing.
To demonstrate that the prediction results were not
sensitive to the particular individuals comprising the training
and test samples, we repeated the LASSO/principal compo-
nents regression analyses such that every individual was
included in the test sample at least once (5-folds; training
Figure 2. The Stroop task and Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT) evoked comparable changes in brain activity (voxel-wise r of blood
oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal change=0.88; P<0.001; Dice coefficient for spatial overlap=0.80). Color-scaled t-statistic maps of brain
areas exhibiting significant BOLD signal changes (incongruent vs congruent condition changes) are shown for the Stroop task (A) and MSIT (B).
Maps in (A) and (B) correspond to statistical parametric t-statistic maps, shown at a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05 to control for multiple
statistical testing. The color-scaled BOLD signal change map in (C) corresponds to the average of the Stroop and MSIT BOLD signal change
maps. Task-averaged BOLD signal change maps across participants were used to generate a final and whole-brain multivariate brain pattern to
predict task-averaged stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity.

 data set N=248 per fold; test data set N=62 per fold). The
95% CIs of the predicted versus observed correlation values in
the test sample did not include zero across all 5-folds
(rs=0.31�0.16, 0.35�0.18, 0.35�0.24, 0.36�0.24, and
0.30�0.23). These effect sizes were comparable to that
illustrated in Figure 3B. Thus, the final cross-validation
(replication) results we observed in the hold-out test sample
do not appear to be sensitive to the particular individuals
included in the training and test samples. Moreover, there
appears to be stability in the magnitude (effect size) of the
predictive association between the multivariate brain pattern
and ΔSBP regardless of sample composition. Adding sex
(male, female), age, and baseline (prestressor) levels of BP as
covariates did not alter the direction, statistical significance,
or effect sizes observed. In addition, we observed no
statistically significant differences between men and women
in stressor-evoked reactivity in the entire analytic sample
(N=310; P>0.25). Finally, we tested whether the learned
multivariate pattern might differentially predict stressor-
evoked SBP reactivity among men and women. In a sex-
stratified analysis in the hold-out test sample (N=104; 57
men, 47 women), the magnitude of the association between
predicted and observed stressor-evoked SBP reactivity (illus-
trated for the entire test sample in Figure 3B) did not differ
significantly between men and women (rmen=0.39 versus
rwomen=0.24; z=0.83; P=0.41). Accordingly, sex, age, and
baseline BP were omitted from further analyses.
The receiver operation curve curve in Figure 3C illustrates
sensitivity and specificity values for our multivariate brain
pattern to predict different “cut offs” or “thresholds” of
stressor-evoked ΔSBP (labeled with a “c” in the figure). At the
approximate midpoint of this curve, for example, the true-
positive rate (sensitivity) for detecting ΔSBP ≥4 mm Hg is
�0.6, the false-positive rate (1�specificity) is �0.4, and the
overall accuracy is �0.6. This midpoint value approximates
the mean ΔSBP evoked by the tasks and reported above. At
increasingly larger ΔSBP thresholds, detection sensitivity
decreases, whereas specificity increases (eg, for predicting
ΔSBP ≥5 mm Hg, sensitivity is �0.5, specificity is �0.7, and
overall accuracy is �0.6). At increasingly greater levels of
ΔSBP, however, the predictive accuracy of the multivariate
pattern declines. Conversely, at smaller ΔSBP thresholds,
sensitivity increases, whereas specificity decreases.

 physiology (ΔDBP, ΔHR) obtained during the fMRI stressor
battery. We found that the brain pattern for ΔSBP did not
reliably predict individual differences in stressor-evoked
changes in affect (ratings of feeling pleasant versus unpleas-
ant) or arousal measured by the Self-Assessment Manikin
scale (r=0.04, P>0.66 for affect and r=�0.10, P>0.31 for
arousal); nor did it reliably predict mean reaction time
differences between the congruent and incongruent condition
of the 2 stressor tasks (r=�0.01; P>0.95). The brain pattern
for ΔSBP did, however, predict individual differences in
stressor-evoked DBP and HR reactivity (rs=0.25 and 0.28,
respectively; Ps<0.01). The latter results are likely attributed
to the correlation between stressor-evoked SBP reactivity
with these variables (rs=0.39–0.53; Ps<0.001), given that the
multivariate brain pattern was not specifically trained to
predict these other dimensions of cardiovascular reactivity.
Finally, we note that the brain pattern for ΔSBP did not
significantly predict resting SBP across individuals (r=0.09;
P>0.36), suggesting specificity for stress-related SBP changes
and not tonic (basal) levels of arterial pressure. In view of
these results, the multivariate brain pattern appears to predict
correlated
parameters
of
stressor-evoked
cardiovascular
physiology (BP, HR), but not self-reported or behavioral
measures of stressor responding.
In a final test of discriminative performance, a multivariate
brain pattern developed for the prediction of self-reported
pain, the neurological pain signature,39 did not significantly
predict DSBP across individuals (r=0.08; P>0.38). This
indicates that the multivariate brain pattern derived from
our training sample and evaluated in our test sample is
comparatively unique in its prediction of individual differences
in stressor-evoked SBP reactivity.
Ancillary Analyses
In a final series of ancillary analyses, we tested whether
stressor-evoked SBP reactivity was associated with individual
differences in depressive symptoms, hostility, anxiety, years
of schooling, and body mass index, as well as possible
confounders or putative brain or cerebrovascular correlates of
CVD risk: total CBF and volumes of gray matter, white matter,
and cerebral spinal fluid. We found that stressor-evoked SBP

 reactivity did not significantly correlate with any of these
factors (all Ps>0.30). This suggests that the individual
differences in stressor-evoked SBP reactivity that were
predicted by our multivariate brain pattern are unlikely to be
attributable to, or confounded by, these psychosocial, demo-
graphic, anthropometric, and cerebrovascular or brain mor-
phology factors in this otherwise healthy and unmedicated
sample.
Discussion
The main novel finding of the present study is that a whole-
brain and multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked activity was
reliably associated with individual differences in stressor-
evoked SBP reactivity, a predictor of future hypertension,
premature CVD, and CVD mortality.5,6 This multivariate
pattern, henceforth referred to as a brain phenotype for
ΔSBP, was derived from the largest neuroimaging study of
individual differences in cardiovascular stress reactivity to
date, which integrated the use of a standardized stressor
battery, cross-validation testing, and machine learning meth-
ods.35,36,43 The brain phenotype for ΔSBP accounted for
around 9% of the variance in individual differences in stressor-
evoked SBP reactivity (our primary dependent variable), with
overall accuracies in predicting normative SBP changes
ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 (Figure 3C). Moreover, the brain
phenotype exhibited discriminant performance in predicting
stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity, insofar as it pre-
dicted correlated changes in DBP and HR reactivity, but not
self-reported emotionality, arousal, or task performance
changes evoked by the stressor paradigm. Finally, a different
multivariate brain pattern that has been developed to predict
pain,39 an aversive behavioral state that is plausibly related to
the experience of stress, did not predict individual differences
in cardiovascular reactivity. The latter finding suggests some
specificity for the brain pattern identified here, wherein the
neural networks involved in predicting stressor-evoked car-
diovascular reactivity are likely independent of those involved
in both physical and subjective experiences of stress or pain.
Importantly, the brain areas that were especially predictive of
individual differences in stressor-evoked cardiovascular reac-
tivity included those that are implicated in appraising
psychological stressors and regulating the cardiovascular
system through autonomic pathways.12,13,44 Among other
areas, these included forebrain cortical areas within the
medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula
(Figure 4; Tables S3 and S4), as well as areas of the basal
ganglia, extended amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain, and
cerebellum. Again, however, we emphasize that a whole-brain
pattern with positive and negative weights across voxels was
used for prediction and cross-validation, as opposed to
individual areas. In aggregate, the present findings thus
extend previous work by providing the first evidence for a
candidate multivariate brain phenotype that encompasses
areas across the entire brain, which generalizes to account, in
part, for individual differences in stressor-evoked cardiovas-
cular reactivity. In aggregate, these findings may have
implications for understanding the neurophysiological mech-
anisms involved in linking psychological stress to CVD risk
and stress-related clinical cardiovascular events.
Individual differences in stressor-evoked cardiovascular
reactivity, particularly BP reactivity, have long been implicated
in risk for CVD.4,45 These individual differences are stable over
time (ie, they show high repeatability) and are moderately
generalizable from laboratory to daily life contexts, suggesting
a trait-like phenotypic dimension of stress sensitivity and
related CVD vulnerability.41 There is now cumulative epidemi-
ological evidence that stressor-evoked BP reactivity relates to
increased prospective risk for a range of adverse cardiovas-
cular outcomes independently of conventional cardiovascular
risk factors, albeit with associations of modest effect size.5 To
better understand the mechanisms that may contribute to
individual differences in stressor-evoked cardiovascular reac-
tivity, this epidemiological work has been extended recently to
neuroimaging studies that have attempted to characterize the
intermediary brain systems and circuits that may link or
transduce the processing (eg, appraisal) of psychological
stressors to autonomic and neuroendocrine signaling along
effector pathways that regulate the cardiovascular system.
These studies have identified a number of brain areas that are
capable of centrally orchestrating behavioral influences on
CVD risk through peripheral physiological mechanisms.13
Among the brain areas most consistently related in previous
work to stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity—as well as
some markers of autonomic cardiovascular control, inflam-
mation, and arterial markers of preclinical vascular disease—
are areas within the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior
cingulate cortex, insula, extended amygdala, hippocampus,
and hindbrain and brainstem cell groups.1,13,16 It has been
proposed that signaling patterns between these areas may
serve to calibrate the magnitude of physiological (eg,
cardiovascular) reactions to anticipated self-relevant demands
(eg, stressors) to support contextually adaptive behavioral
coping processes.13,46,47 Moreover, an individual’s propensity
to exhibit “mis-calibrations” between brain and physiological
activity may reflect a dimension of individual difference that
underlies the expression of “exaggerated” (metabolically
excessive or pathophysiological) autonomic, inflammatory,
and cardiovascular reactions, including stressor-evoked BP
reactions that have been linked to preclinical CVD.46–48 In
speculation, such “mis-calibrations” or “cardiovascular-meta-
bolic uncoupling” may be reflected on the individual (person)
level by a stronger expression of activity within the multivari-
ate pattern identified in the present study.

 In agreement with previous work, several so-called visceral
control areas were encompassed by our multivariate brain
pattern and were especially predictive of stressor-evoked
cardiovascular reactivity, particularly areas within the medial
prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula (see
Figure 4; Tables S3 and S4). For example, Wager et al
demonstrated that coordinated patterns of stressor-evoked
activation in visceral control areas, including the medial
prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, accounted for
concurrent HR reactions evoked by a threatening social
evaluative stressor.49,50 This study was extended recently in a
reanalysis of data from 18 people, showing that cross-
validated and multivariate brain patterns evoked by the social
evaluative stressor reliably predicted concurrent HR and skin
conductance changes.51 Here, it is noteworthy that the
particular multivariate brain pattern that predicted HR reac-
tivity to social evaluative threat at the group level in that
recent report accounted for �10% of the variance in HR
reactivity across individuals (r=0.32�0.07). This effect size
approximates that observed for the predictive association
between the multivariate brain pattern derived in the present
study and stressor-evoked BP reactivity (see Figure 3B).
Moreover, several of the areas within the multivariate brain
pattern that were predictive of HR reactivity to social threat
encompassed core limbic areas for visceral control and
stressor processing that were also observed to predict BP
reactivity to cognitive stressors in the present study, including
regions within the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior
cingulate cortex. An important next step will be to determine
the extent to which there is similarity or dissimilarity in
multivariate brain patterns that predict different parameters
of cardiovascular physiology that are evoked by cognitive
stressors (used here) versus social evaluative tasks used in
other stress testing paradigms.
In addition to canonical visceral control areas, our findings
revealed other areas across the entire brain that were
predictive of stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity (eg,
within the cerebellum, motor cortex, and basal ganglia; see
Figure 4; Tables S3 and S4), which is consistent with growing
recognition that complex and brain-based processes are not
reliably localizable to single areas, but to distributed circuits
whose properties are arguably best quantified by multivariate
or network-based methods.52 In these regards, the present
findings agree with, and extend extant results from, meta-
analytic neuroimaging reviews of human autonomic and
cardiovascular control.12,18,19
What are presently unclear, however, are the intermediate
physiological mechanisms that might link stressor-evoked
activity patterns in brain systems for autonomic and visceral
control with acute changes in BP and other parameters of
cardiovascular function. One such mechanism may involve
acute changes in the operating characteristics of the
baroreflex.1,13,48,53 The baroreflex is a homeostatic control
mechanism that constrains variability in BP on a beat-to-beat
basis by adjusting parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow
to the heart and vasculature by viscerosensory and viscero-
motor pathways that are subject to influence by areas within
the forebrain, midbrain, and brainstem.11 The autonomic
adjustments that are induced by transient increases or
decreases in BP lead to compensatory changes in HR, cardiac
contractility, and vasoconstriction to alter subsequent levels
of BP toward a homeostatic set point. Acute psychological
stressors may alter or possibly “over-ride” the functioning of
some components of the baroreflex, as evidenced most
consistently by reductions in the gain or slope that defines the
relationship between spontaneous and beat-to-beat changes
in BP and “compensatory” changes in HR (ie, the cardiovagal
baroreflex sensitivity).13,48,54 A reduction in the sensitivity of
this component of the baroreflex is thought to partly enable
the simultaneous rise of BP with HR that is usually evoked by
acute stressful experiences.48,53 Psychological stressors may
also affect other parameters of the baroreflex, including
resetting effects on sympathetic vasomotor control over a
higher operating range of BP,1 but such effects have been less
well studied in humans. Notably, it has been reported that
individuals who exhibit greater stressor-evoked activation in
forebrain, midbrain, and brainstem systems for autonomic and
visceral control also exhibit a greater stressor-evoked reduc-
tion in cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity.55 Moreover, several
of the areas previously reported to associate with stressor-
evoked reductions in baroreflex sensitivity overlap with those
that were predictive of stressor-evoked BP reactivity within
the multivariate pattern (illustrated in Figure 4), including the
dorsal and perigenual areas of the anterior cingulate cortex,
ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and insula.
As supported by nonhuman animal evidence and findings
from neuroimaging studies in humans, the anterior cingulate
cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and insula, as well as
other anatomically networked regions of the forebrain,
midbrain, and brainstem, appear capable of altering vis-
cerosensory and visceromotor control mechanisms of the
baroreflex through their bidirectional communication with
preautonomic cell groups.1,13,16,54 Thus, it is possible that the
predictive associations between activity changes in several
brain areas encompassed within our multivariate pattern and
stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity are mediated, in
part, by centrally mediated influences on physiological control
mechanisms, such as the baroreflex. However, an important
next step will be determine whether relative activity increases
or decreases in suspected brain systems for autonomic and
visceral control relate to excitatory versus inhibitory neural
processes that, in turn, affect intermediate physiological
mechanisms that alter cardiovascular function. For instance,
it has been suggested that activity increases in areas of the

 ventromedial prefrontal cortex may be more consistently
associated with increased parasympathetic cardiovascular
control, whereas activity increases in areas of the perigenual
and dorsal anterior cingulate may be more consistently
associated with increased sympathetic cardiovascular con-
trol.13,14,54 These suggestions appear compatible with the
present observations that multivariate stressor-evoked activ-
ity weights in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex were
negatively associated with BP reactivity, whereas those in
the perigenual and dorsal portions of the anterior cingulate
cortex were positively associated with BP reactivity (Figure 4).
Such patterns of association could be attributable to the
effects of decreased parasympathetic and increased sympa-
thetic outflow to the heart and vasculature.
In addition to areas of the medial prefrontal cortex and
anterior cingulate cortex, stressor-evoked activity changes in
the insula were also predictive of BP reactivity (Figure 4;
Tables S3 and S4). The latter observations accord with a
corpus of nonhuman animal and human evidence for insular
involvement in autonomic cardiovascular regulation through
visceromotor and viscerosensory pathways (eg, involving
baroreflex modulation), as well as the integration and
coordination of peripheral physiology with cognitive and
affective processes.14,16,56 The functional neuroanatomy of
the insula has been extensively reviewed, particularly with
respect to its involvement in stress-related cardiovascular
pathophysiology and clinical outcomes (eg, Takotsubo car-
diomyopathy).16,57 Based on existing evidence, it has been
proposed that areas within the left insula may exhibit a
stronger association with parasympathetic cardiovascular
control, whereas areas in the right insula may exhibit a
stronger association with sympathetic cardiovascular con-
trol.16,19,58 Such autonomic control influences are enabled by
dense insula connectivity with areas of the prefrontal cortex,
anterior cingulate, hypothalamus, thalamus, medial temporal
lobe (eg, amygdala, hippocampus), and cell groups within the
midbrain and brainstem.16 In these regards, specific obser-
vations from the present study appear consistent with
proposed autonomic control functions ascribed to the left
and right insula, wherein greater stressor-evoked BP reactivity
was negatively associated with multivariate activity weights
located in left insula and positively with those in right insula.
The latter patterns of associations again could be explained by
stressor-evoked and coordinated changes in networked
forebrain areas that relate to decreases in parasympathetic
and increases in sympathetic cardiovascular control. As noted
above, more-precise measures of efferent (visceromotor) and
afferent (viscerosensory) sympathetic and parasympathetic
activity concurrent with fMRI and cardiovascular monitoring
will help to determine these possibilities. Again, we empha-
size, however, that both positive and negative predictive
weights were distributed throughout the entire brain within
the multivariate pattern, including putative areas for auto-
nomic and visceral control (see Figure 3A). Thus, there is
likely to be an intermixing of physiological (eg, sympathetic,
parasympathetic) functions influenced by particular activity
patterns within and across such networked areas.
Our findings are novel insofar as we have identified a
multivariate pattern across the whole brain that may identify
individuals exhibiting relatively greater stress sensitivity.
Moreover, the methodological approach that was used to
identify the whole-brain pattern may prove useful in other
contexts to predict other dimensions of physiological stress
responding and possibly clinical events. Hence, future studies
may be able to identify individuals who more strongly exhibit a
multivariate brain pattern that predicts clinically meaningful
outcomes (eg, disease progression, new events, etc).52 In a
recent and foundational illustration of the plausibility of such a
brain-based approach to predict CVD risk, Tawakol et al59
demonstrated that elevated levels of basal metabolic activity
within the amygdala predicted future CVD events above and
beyond conventional CVD risk factors. An open question is
whether multivariate and network-based approaches used in
the present study would add to the predictive value of such
single-region–based approaches and complement conven-
tional CVD risk-prediction approaches. Moreover, it will be
important to test whether adjunctive stress management
interventions that are designed to protect against CVD risk60
affect particular multivariate patterns of stress-related brain
activity (brain biomarkers) linked to physiological mediators of
CVD risk, including cardiovascular reactivity. If so, this would
suggest the possible utility of surrogate brain biomarkers for
use (eg, monitoring, intervention refinement, etc) in novel and
neurobiologically informed intervention or prevention efforts
in cardiovascular behavioral medicine.
We note that we used a standardized psychological
stressor battery that was modeled after batteries used in
epidemiological studies of stress-related CVD risk.7 This
stressor-battery controls for individual differences in task
engagement and motor responding through performance
titration procedures. We have also found, in previous work,
that cardiovascular and behavioral responding to tasks of this
battery is reliable across neuroimaging and laboratory-based
testing contexts.31 Accordingly, it may be appropriate for
developing stress reactivity norms across a variety of
populations. However, although the task may entail core
dimensions of stressful experiences, including time pressure,
loss of control, negative feedback, uncertainty, and conflict, it
may lack direct correspondence to daily life stressors of
personal or social relevance. Accordingly, future work in this
area should use a range of stressors to test whether the brain
pattern identified here is sensitive to diverse stressors or
predicts other (eg, neuroendocrine) parameters of stress
physiology across stressor contexts. In addition, clinical

 cardiovascular events (eg, arrhythmia, ischemia) are also
common under conditions of acute psychological stress,61,62
and future work should determine whether the brain pattern
identified here could, in part, account for the expression of
clinical events through autonomic pathways.
We appreciate that the current sample consisted of an
otherwise healthy group of midlife individuals who were mostly
white, not on medications that could affect the cardiovascular
system, and without a history of clinical CVD or other chronic
illnesses, possibly limiting generalizability. In this regard, an
important direction will be to determine whether the brain
pattern identified here also predicts aspects of stress reactivity
in diverse clinical and demographic samples across a range of
contexts. We further appreciate that stress-related psychiatric
disorders are highly comorbid with CVD and confer risk for
future CVD events.63 Thus, it may be possible to test whether
individuals with these disorders more strongly exhibit the
stress-related brain pattern identified here or whether an
entirely different brain phenotype among these individuals
accounts for some of the comorbidity between such psychiatric
and cardiovascular outcomes. Finally, we note that there was
appreciable variance in stressor-evoked cardiovascular reac-
tivity that was unaccounted for by the multivariate brain
pattern, and there was a decline in the accuracy of the pattern
to predict increasingly greater levels of stressor-evoked
cardiovascular reactivity. These observations underscore the
need for model refinement in future work. Moreover, it will be
important for future studies to simultaneously account for other
possible sources of individual differences in cardiovascular
reactivity, including genetic influences and individual differ-
ences in peripheral receptor sensitivity to autonomic and
neuroendocrine outflow to the heart and vasculature.2
The present findings provide new evidence for a multivari-
ate brain pattern that predicts individual differences in
stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity. This suggests the
possibility of an identifiable brain phenotype
or brain
biomarker that reflects stress-related CVD risk. This possibil-
ity agrees with recent findings demonstrating that brain
activity linked to psychological stress forecasts clinical CVD
events.59 Accordingly, the present findings are relevant not
only for furthering the understanding the neural bases of
individual differences in cardiovascular stress physiology, but
also for understanding the neural pathways that mechanisti-
cally link stressful experiences and CVD in at risk and clinical
populations.
