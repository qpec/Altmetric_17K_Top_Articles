The 2014 western Africa Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic was un-
precedented in magnitude, infecting over 28,000 and causing over
11,000 deaths. During this outbreak, multiple instances of EBOV
sexual transmission were reported, including cases where the
infectious individual had recovered from EBOV disease months
before transmission. Potential human host factors in EBOV sexual
transmission remain unstudied. Several basic seminal amyloids,
most notably semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI),
enhance in vitro infection by HIV and several other viruses. To test
the ability of these peptides to enhance EBOV infection, viruses
bearing the EBOV glycoprotein (EboGP) were preincubated with
physiological concentrations of SEVI before infection of physio-
logically relevant cell lines and primary cells. Preincubation with
SEVI significantly increased EboGP-mediated infectivity and repli-
cation in epithelium- and monocyte-derived cell lines. This en-
hancement was dependent upon amyloidogenesis and positive
charge, and infection results were observed with both viruses
carrying EboGP and authentic EBOV as well as with semen. SEVI
enhanced binding of virus to cells and markedly increased its
subsequent internalization. SEVI also stimulated uptake of a fluid
phase marker by macropinocytosis, a critical mechanism by which
cells internalize EBOV. We report a previously unrecognized ability
of SEVI and semen to significantly alter viral physical properties
critical for transmissibility by increasing the stability of EboGP-
bearing recombinant viruses during incubation at elevated tem-
perature and providing resistance to desiccation. Given the
potential for EBOV sexual transmission to spark new transmission
chains, these findings represent an important interrogation of
factors potentially important for this EBOV transmission route.

T
he 2014–2016 western Africa Ebola outbreak was the largest
Ebola outbreak on record, causing more than 28,652 cases
and killing 11,325 (1). Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) is
primarily spread by contact with fluids of an infected individual
or body. Months after recovery from EVD, EBOV remains de-
tectable in some individuals, including in semen (2). Cohort
studies of male EVD survivors demonstrated that infectious
EBOV could be isolated from semen up to 82 d after EBOV
onset (3, 4). The maximum recorded persistence of EBOV RNA
in semen is 965 d, although the concordance between persistent
RNA and infectious virus is unclear (5). During the 2014–2016
EBOV outbreak, multiple cases of sexual transmission—some
sparking new transmission chains—were reported in case reports
supported by epidemiological and molecular evidence (6–10).
Transmission was reported from a male survivor 470 d after his EVD
onset (9). An epidemiological model of EBOV sexual transmission
in Sierra Leone predicted that even a 3-mo infectious period would
extend the length of the outbreak by an average of 83 d (11).
EBOV tropism is broad (12, 13) and histological studies report
a wide variety of cell types infected in vivo during infection (12,
14–16). It has been suggested that monocytes, macrophages, and
dendritic cells in particular are important early targets for in-
fection (12, 16–19). EBOV entry into cells is enhanced by inter-
actions between the virion and cellular attachment factors,
including C-type lectins (e.g., DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR) (20–24),
Tyro3 family members (e.g., Axl) (25), and phosphatidylserine-
binding molecule TIM-1 (26). EBOV requires macropinocytosis
as an uptake mechanism (27–29), resulting in its trafficking to
acidified endosomes where the glycoprotein is processed by ca-
thepsin B/L proteases (30). After processing, the glycoprotein in-
teracts with its receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) to effect fusion
between the viral and endosomal membranes (31–33).
Screening of protein/peptide libraries derived from human
semen identified peptides that dramatically enhance viral in-
fection (34). The most well studied of these is PAP248–286, a
highly basic 39-amino acid cleavage product of prostatic acid
phosphatase (PAP) (35). While having no impact on HIV-1 in-
fection as a soluble peptide, PAP248–286 assembles into amyloid
fibrils termed semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI)
that greatly increase HIV-1 infectivity (35). Subsequent analyses
have identified other amyloid fibrils in semen that enhance HIV-
1 infection, including another cleavage product of PAP (PAP85–
120) (36) and fragments of semenogelin-1 (SEM1) and -2
(SEM2), components of the seminal coagulum (37). Both posi-
tive charge and amyloid character are important for enhance-
ment of HIV-1 infection by SEVI, as modified peptides without
positive residues form amyloid fibrils with greatly diminished
enhancement ability (38). Anionic polymers such as dextran
sulfate (38) and molecular tweezers that bind positively charged
amino acids (39) inhibit SEVI’s enhancement effect, highlighting
the importance of charge. Subsequent reports have identified
Significance
During the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak, multiple instances of
male-to-female sexual transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) were
reported. While relatively uncommon, EBOV sexual trans-
mission presents a major public health concern, as these
transmission events occurred months after recovery. Further,
sexual transmission was linked to a resurgence of EBOV dis-
ease in Guinea, which had previously been declared Ebola-free.
However, the role of host factors involved in sexual trans-
mission remains unknown. We find that seminal amyloids and
semen greatly enhance EBOV infection and alter the virion
physical properties, stabilizing viral infectivity and protecting
the virus from drying. These results promote seminal amyloids
as possible targets for intervention to prevent EBOV sexual
transmission and seeding new infection chains that reignite
an outbreak.

 enhancement roles for these fibrils for infection by simian im-
munodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus
(40–42).
A leading model of SEVI enhancement of infection posits that
the highly positive charge of the amyloid fibrils reduces elec-
trostatic repulsion between the negative charges of the virion and
cellular membranes. For HIV-1, an increase in virus attachment
to the cell surface was detected upon pretreatment of the virus
with SEVI relative to virus alone (35). SEVI fibrils are endocy-
tosed by cellular protrusions, but the role this plays in en-
hancement of viral infection is not known (35).
The ability of sexual transmission to reignite an outbreak
warrants examination of factors affecting EBOV sexual trans-
mission. In this study, we addressed whether seminal amyloids
enhanced EBOV infection in vitro. Our results indicate that
SEVI, other seminal amyloid fibrils, and semen greatly enhanced
infection mediated by the EBOV glycoprotein using both non-
pathogenic EBOV surrogates and authentic EBOV. This en-
hanced infection retained requirements for EBOV infection
including macropinocytic uptake and cathepsin processing. In
addition, we identify a potential role for seminal amyloid fibrils
in enhancing viral stability after extended incubation at elevated
temperature or upon desiccation.
Materials and Methods
For full materials and methods, please see SI Appendix.
Viruses and Cells. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) expressing the
EBOV glycoprotein and mCherry (rVSV-EboGP-mCherry) has been previously
described (43, 44). EBOV/“Zaire 1995” (EBOV/H.sap-tc/COD/95/Kik-9510621)
was used in authentic virus studies (45). HeLa, A549, THP1, and Vero CCL81
cell lines and macrophages differentiated from blood monocytes were used
for infections. Deidentified seminal plasma was obtained by centrifugation
of pooled semen from four donors; seminal plasma filtrate was produced by
filtering seminal plasma through an Amicon Ultra 100-kDa cutoff filter unit.
Monocytes and semen were collected with informed consent under proto-
cols approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.
Use of primary monocytes and seminal plasma is considered to be a sec-
ondary use of deidentified human specimens and are exempt via Title 55
Part 46, Subpart A of 46.101 (b) of the Code of Federal Regulations.
Peptides and Fibrils. SEVI, SEVI-Ala, PAP85–120, SEM1, and SEM2 fibrils were
generated by dissolving peptides (Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory,
Yale University) in PBS, filtering through a 0.2-μm filter, seeding with 1%
preformed amyloid, and incubating at 37 °C with shaking at 1,400 rpm (35–
37). Amyloid formation was confirmed by assessing thioflavin T fluorescence.
Peptide sequences are available in SI Appendix, Table S1. α-Synuclein fibrils
were provided by Kelvin Luk, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia,
generated as previously described (46).
Infection Assays. rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was diluted into DMEM-10, supple-
mented with amyloid fibrils or soluble peptides, and incubated at 37 °C for 15
min. Cells were infected with the mixture and infection was assessed by flow
cytometry. Infection by authentic EBOV was done similarly and quantified by
automated fluorescence microscopy after immunostaining.
Binding/Internalization Assays. rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was pretreated with or
without SEVI, then bound to HeLa cells on ice and either lysed in 1% Triton
after 1 h (binding) or warmed to 37 °C for an additional 1 h to allow in-
ternalization, then washed, trypsinized, and lysed (internalization). Lysates
were analyzed by quantitative Western blotting (Li-Cor) by comparing
VSV M signal to GAPDH signal.
Dextran Uptake Assay. HeLa cells were pretreated with different concen-
trations of SEVI, then incubated with 70 kDa dextran-FITC. Mean fluorescence
intensity of internalized FITC was determined by flow cytometry.
Virus Stability Analysis. rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was diluted in artificial semen
simulant with or without SEVI fibrils, SEVI-Ala fibrils, or PAP248–286 peptide
or alternatively, seminal plasma in PBS. After incubation at 37 °C or room
temperature with laminar flow, samples were titered by tissue culture in-
fectious dose 50 (TCID50) and normalized to the 0-h time point.
Results
Seminal Amyloids Enhance rVSV-EboGP-mCherry Infection. The
enhancement ability of seminal amyloids on EBOV glycoprotein-
mediated infection was first assessed with a recombinant vesic-
ular stomatitis virus expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (rVSV-
EboGP-mCherry, Fig. 1A). Recombinant or pseudotyped VSV
systems have been used to explore the interactions of the EBOV
glycoprotein and viral membrane with cells during entry due to
faithful mimicry of the EBOV infection process in a BSL-2 en-
vironment (30, 31, 47, 48). SEVI is the best studied of the
seminal amyloids, having been the first characterized and having
variants available to explore mechanistic details (35, 38). SEVI
amyloid fibrils were assembled from chemically synthesized pep-
tides. After preincubation with SEVI, rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was
added to cell lines representing potential target cell types during
EBOV sexual transmission, including epithelium-derived HeLa
and A549 cells and monocyte-derived THP1 cells. Percent in-
fection was measured by flow cytometry for the mCherry reporter.
Preincubation of rVSV-EboGP-mCherry with SEVI resulted in a
striking increase in infectivity by 16.9- to 20.5-fold for the cell lines
analyzed at 35 μg/mL, the concentration of SEVI reported in
human semen (35) (Fig. 1 B and C). A 4.3-fold increase in output
virus titer was observed in primary monocyte-derived macro-
phages, indicating that the enhancement effect was not limited to
cell lines (Fig. 1D). These experiments were done at low multi-
plicity of infection (MOI), when enhancement by SEVI has been
characterized as greatest (35). However, due to concerns of re-
producibility with such low initial percent infection, most future
studies were done at higher MOI, with a concomitant decrease in
fold enhancement.
Other amyloidogenic peptides derived from the seminal pro-
teins prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP85–120), SEM1, and
SEM2 have been reported to enhance viral infection (36, 37, 41).
To determine whether these other amyloid fibrils enhance in-
fection mediated by the EBOV glycoprotein, rVSV-EboGP-
mCherry was preincubated with physiological concentrations of
SEVI fibrils, PAP85–120 fibrils, representative SEM1 fibrils, or
representative SEM2 fibrils at physiological concentrations be-
fore infection of HeLa cells (MOI 3). Because of background for
these other peptides in the mCherry channel (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1), infection was quantified by flow cytometry after staining for
VSV M protein. We observed that all four amyloid peptides
significantly increased infection by rVSV-EboGP-mCherry, with
the SEM1 amyloid fibrils exhibiting the highest fold increase of
20.3-fold (Fig. 1E). The SEM2 and PAP85–120 peptides also
significantly enhanced infection by the recombinant virus by 9.2-
and 4.2-fold, respectively. A combinatorial infection using low
(5 μg/mL) concentrations of each peptide showed no additional
infection beyond that of the greatest fold increase (SEM1) alone,
suggesting that under these conditions SEM1 may mask the ef-
fects of the other amyloids (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). These results
demonstrate that rVSV-EboGP-mCherry infection is enhanced
by the four amyloid fibrils present in human semen.
SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection is dependent
upon the charge and amyloid character of the peptides (35, 38).
To determine whether SEVI-mediated enhancement of rVSV-
EboGP-mCherry maintains similar requirements, rVSV-EboGP-
mCherry was pretreated with equal masses of SEVI fibrils, fibrils
in which the positively charged amino acids have been replaced
with alanine (SEVI-Ala) (38), or freshly dissolved PAP248–286.
HeLa cells were infected with the virus-peptide mixtures (MOI
3) and infection was analyzed by flow cytometry for mCherry
expression. Unlike SEVI, which effected a 7.5-fold enhancement
of rVSV-EboGP-mCherry infection, infection in the presence of
SEVI-Ala- or soluble PAP248–286-treated virus did not differ
from rVSV-EboGP-mCherry alone (Fig. 1F). These results in-
dicate that like enhancement of HIV-1 infection, positive charge
and amyloid character are both critical for rVSV-EboGP-mCherry
enhancement.
To confirm that infection is enhanced by endogenous peptides
present in semen in addition to chemically synthesized peptides,

MICROBIOLOGY
 rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was incubated with 10% seminal plasma
for 5 min before infection of HeLa cells. Low concentrations of
seminal plasma must be used to avoid cytotoxic effects (35), al-
though this leads to a concomitant dilution of the amyloids
present. A three- to fourfold increase in infectivity was observed
under these conditions, an increase which was significantly di-
minished when the seminal plasma was filtered through a 100-kDa
filter unit to remove large molecular weight species such as am-
yloids (Fig. 1G). While this cutoff has been previously used for
amyloid studies (49), it may be possible that smaller oligomeric
amyloid species may be present and lead to the observed in-
complete abrogation of enhancement. These results, however,
confirm the ability of semen to enhance infection of a virus
bearing the EBOV glycoprotein.
SEVI Enhances EBOV VLP Binding and Internalization. To characterize
the mechanism of SEVI-mediated enhancement of EBOV
glycoprotein-mediated infection, binding and internalization ex-
periments were performed. rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was pre-
incubated with SEVI before binding to HeLa cells on ice for 1 h.
Afterward, the cells were either immediately lysed (binding) or
shifted to 37 °C for an additional hour to permit internalization.
The internalization cells were then washed, trypsinized to
remove bound but uninternalized virus, and lysed. Lysates were
analyzed by quantitative Western blotting, and signal in the
presence of SEVI was compared with rVSV-EboGP-mCherry
binding/internalization in the absence of SEVI. A modest in-
crease in binding (∼1.5-fold) was observed in the presence of
SEVI at physiological concentrations (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the
internalization assay demonstrated a linear (R2 = 0.9894) dose-
dependent relationship between SEVI preincubation concentration
and internalization, with physiological concentrations of SEVI
resulting in an ∼10-fold increase in internalization of rVSV-EboGP-
mCherry after background subtraction (Fig. 2B). Further, if rVSV-
EboGP-mCherry was bound to HeLa cells on ice in the absence of
SEVI, then incubated for 1 h in media containing SEVI, a 10-fold
increase in internalization was observed (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). This
suggests the increase in internalization may, to some extent, be able
to occur in trans in addition to in cis. These findings were further
confirmed by binding and internalization assays using EBOV
virus-like particles carrying enzymatic or fluorescent reporters
(SI Appendix, Figs. S4 and S5).
The ability of SEVI to enhance viral internalization has not
been previously reported. Previous reports have shown micro-
graphs of SEVI within cells, raising the possibility it may induce
endocytosis (35). To explore the ability of SEVI to modulate
macropinocytosis in a virus-free environment, HeLa cells were
incubated at 37 °C with different concentrations of SEVI for
20 min before the addition of a macropinocytic marker molecule
FITC-dextran for 10 min. The cells were treated with PBS pH 4.9
to bleach uninternalized FITC fluorescence, trypsinized, and
geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) was determined by
flow cytometry. A linear relationship (R2 = 0.9799) was observed
between SEVI concentration and gMFI, with the highest con-
centrations of SEVI leading to a 3.7-fold increase in macro-
pinocytic uptake (Fig. 2C). This increase in fluorescent intensity
was ablated in the presence of the macropinocytosis inhibitor 5-(N-
ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), indicating efficient bleaching
of bound FITC signal and a specificity of macropinocytosis for

 uptake (Fig. 2C). The enhanced FITC-dextran internalization
depended upon the charge and amyloid character of the SEVI
peptide, as SEVI-Ala and soluble PAP248–286 peptide treatment
showed no increase in dextran uptake (Fig. 2D). These results
provide evidence for the ability of SEVI to promote macro-
pinocytic uptake to increase internalization of EBOV particles.
SEVI-Mediated Enhancement Maintains EBOV Entry Requirements.
Following binding of the virus to the cell, EBOV particles are
endocytosed into cells by macropinocytosis and traffic through
the endosomal system where cellular cathepsins process the
glycoprotein, enabling an interaction of the glycoprotein with its
receptor to initiate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes
and infection (50). To determine whether the fibril-enhanced
infection diverges from the canonical EBOV entry pathway,
cells were infected with rVSV-EboGP-mCherry in the presence
or absence of inhibitors of macropinocytosis or cathepsin activ-
ity, with or without SEVI. No cytotoxic effects were observed
with any of these inhibitors (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). To inhibit
macropinocytosis, HeLa cells were treated with EIPA, cytocha-
lasin D, 17β-hydroxywortmannin (HWT), or LY294002 for 1 h
before and 1 h during infection (MOI 5). While infection by
rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was enhanced by SEVI in this experi-
ment in the absence of inhibitor, all macropinocytosis inhibitors
equally reduced infection by 5- to 10-fold in both the absence and
presence of SEVI. These results indicate that macropinocytic
entry is not bypassed in the presence of SEVI and that infection
maintains this cellular requirement for EBOV glycoprotein-
dependent infection (Fig. 2E). Similarly, inhibitors of cathepsin
activity, including ammonium chloride, E64, Z-FF-FMK, leu-
peptin, or MDL28170, abrogated infection of HeLa cells by 10-
to 20-fold in the presence and absence of physiological levels of
SEVI (Fig. 2F). These results imply that while SEVI enhances
infection, it does not permit the virus to bypass critical cellular
requirements for rVSV-EboGP-mCherry entry.
SEVI Alters rVSV-EboGP-mCherry Physical Characteristics. We next
hypothesized that seminal amyloid fibrils could affect the phys-
ical characteristics of the virus, which may impact trans-
missibility. To determine if the interaction of viral particles with
amyloid fibrils alters the physical characteristics of the virus, we
analyzed the effects of thermal and osmotic stresses on viral
infectivity. Whether SEVI pretreatment impacts rVSV-EboGP-
mCherry stability over time was assessed by incubation of rVSV-
EboGP-mCherry with or without physiologic SEVI concentra-
tions in artificial semen simulant (51) for various lengths of time
at 37 °C. Artificial semen simulant is designed to mimic the
chemical composition of semen and contains 5 mg/mL BSA,
making any nonspecific effects of additional protein in the form
of peptides to the mixture unlikely. At each time point, the titer
of virus was determined by TCID50 on Vero cells. Values were
normalized to the starting titer for each condition, log trans-
formed, and analyzed by nonlinear regression. Strikingly, the
presence of SEVI promoted increased viral viability relative to
virus alone (P = 0.0029). The normalized titer of virus incubated
in the presence of SEVI was ∼17-fold higher than that of virus
incubated in semen simulant alone after 36 h (Fig. 3A). This
enhancement in stability required the positive charge and amy-
loid character of SEVI, as SEVI-Ala and PAP248–286 had no
effect on stability (Fig. 3A). Further, addition of SEVI immedi-
ately before titration after incubation without SEVI was unable
to rescue the effect, suggesting that SEVI exerts its stabilizing
effects during the incubation itself independently from its in-
fection enhancement ability (Fig. 3A, 0 μg/mL SEVI + 35 μg/mL
SEVI). Similar results were observed when rVSV-EboGP-
mCherry was incubated with seminal plasma or seminal plasma
filtered through a 100-kDa filter to deplete amyloid fibrils. Oc-
curring over a shorter timescale than observed with synthesized
peptides in semen simulant, viral stability was enhanced in 10%
seminal plasma compared with 10% seminal plasma filtrate (Fig.
3B). The increase in stability of ∼3-fold by 12 h was significant
(P = 0.0225) but likely diminished due to the diluted amyloid
concentration in 10% plasma.
Lastly, we assessed whether the presence of SEVI fibrils could
improve desiccation tolerance; as enveloped viruses, EBOV and
rVSV-EboGP-mCherry are sensitive to drying. rVSV-EboGP-
mCherry was diluted in artificial semen simulant in the presence
or absence of physiological concentrations of SEVI. Samples
were maintained in bulk liquid or spotted into 96-well plates
(10 μL) and allowed to air dry. Samples were taken immediately
(0 h) or after varying lengths of time drying under laminar flow at
room temperature. Dried samples were rehydrated with 200 μL
of DMEM and infectivity was quantified by TCID50. Samples
were also taken at 6 h from bulk liquid kept within a sealed tube
to assess independently any effects of incubation at room tem-
perature. TCID50/mL measurements were normalized to the
initial time point for each and fitted to a plateau-one phase
decay model, which reflects the lag in viral decay until after the
liquid has evaporated. After 6 h of incubation, the normalized
titer of virus desiccated in the presence of SEVI was ∼10-fold
higher than in its absence (Fig. 3C). Notably, there was no dif-
ference in relative viral titer between virus incubated in the
presence or absence of SEVI in the bulk liquid protected from
desiccation (P = 0.10) (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Again, addition of
SEVI immediately before titration after desiccation in its ab-
sence had no effect on desiccation kinetics (Fig. 3C, 0 μg/mL
SEVI + 35 μg/mL SEVI). This result indicates that SEVI pro-
motes viral viability after desiccation and rehydration. To better
understand the mechanism of SEVI-mediated desiccation tol-
erance, rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was also incubated with SEVI-
Ala and PAP248–286. While the nonamyloid PAP248–286 had
no effect on desiccation tolerance, SEVI-Ala unexpectedly in-
creased viral stability to the same extent as SEVI under these
conditions. To determine if the presence of any amyloid could
have this effect, rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was dried for 6 h in the
presence of an equivalent mass of α-synuclein fibrils, which play
a role in Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis (52). However, no
stabilizing effect was seen over incubation in semen simulant
alone, suggesting that not all amyloids have this property (SI
Appendix, Fig. S8). To confirm that this phenomenon occurs in
semen as well, rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was diluted into 10%
seminal plasma or 10% seminal plasma filtrate and desiccated as
Fig. 3.
SEVI alters rVSV-EboGP-mCherry physical characteristics. (A) rVSV-
EboGP-mCherry was incubated at 37 °C in artificial semen simulant with or
without 35 μg/mL SEVI fibrils, SEVI-Ala fibrils, or PAP248–286 peptide and
titered by TCID50 on Vero cells. In the 0 μg/mL + 35 μg/mL SEVI condition,
SEVI was added immediately before titration after incubation without SEVI;
n = 3, mean ± SEM. (B) rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was incubated at 37 °C in 10%
seminal plasma or seminal plasma filtrate, then titered by TCID50 on Vero
cells; n = 3, mean ± SEM. (C) rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was diluted in artificial
semen simulant with or without 35 μg/mL SEVI fibrils and dried under lam-
inar flow before rehydration and titration by TCID50 on Vero cells; n = 3,
mean ± SEM. (D) rVSV-EboGP-mCherry was diluted in 10% seminal plasma or
seminal plasma filtrate and dried under laminar flow before rehydration and

 above. A significant decrease in stability (P = 0.0022) was ob-
served in the filtrate depleted of amyloid fibrils relative to seminal
plasma alone, reaching ∼16-fold by 6 h (Fig. 3D). Overall, these
results indicate a previously unreported ability of seminal amyloid
fibrils to stabilize viral infectivity, even after incubation at elevated
temperatures over time or desiccation.
Seminal Amyloids Enhance Infection by Authentic EBOV. To confirm
that the SEVI enhancement of rVSV-EboGP-mCherry faithfully
mimics infection by authentic EBOV, HeLa cells were infected
with EBOV after preincubation with various concentrations of
SEVI fibrils. Preincubation of EBOV with SEVI led to a dose-
dependent enhancement of infection similar to that observed
with rVSV-EBOV-mCherry, resulting in a 28.9-fold increase in
infection after 24 h at the physiologic concentration of SEVI
(MOI 0.2) (Fig. 4A). As with EboGP-mediated VSV infection,
the EBOV infection enhancement was dependent upon the
charge and amyloid nature of the fibrils. In contrast to a 22.8-
fold increase in infection observed in the presence of SEVI fibrils
in this experiment, EBOV infection (MOI 2) was not enhanced
by SEVI-Ala fibrils or soluble PAP248–286 (Fig. 4B). Pre-
incubation of EBOV with the other seminal peptides also en-
hanced infection at 24 h by 37.2-fold for PAP85–120 fibrils, 34.3-
fold for SEM1 fibrils, and 41.3-fold for SEM2 fibrils (all 35 μg/mL,
MOI 2), in agreement with the results observed for rVSV-EBOV-
mCherry (Figs. 1E and 4C).
Discussion
Reports of EBOV sexual transmission during the West Africa
Ebola epidemic, although rare, are backed by epidemiological
and/or molecular evidence (6–10). Male-to-female transmission
of persistent virus has been linked to resurgence of EBOV, but
factors potentially involved in EBOV sexual transmission have
not been characterized. This report provides evidence that
seminal amyloid fibrils, a ubiquitous component of semen in
healthy individuals, enhance in vitro infection by both an EBOV
surrogate system and authentic EBOV. These fibrils, act in a
conformation- and charge-dependent manner to increase in-
fection by increasing virion binding to host cells and enhancing
macropinocytotic uptake. We find that these fibrils act to
protect virions from stresses encountered during transmission,
including thermal degradation and desiccation. We further
have replicated these results in seminal plasma containing en-
dogenous seminal amyloids.
Ebola sexual transmission presented a significant and novel
public health problem during and following the West Africa Ebola
epidemic. Although rare and likely mitigated by public health
agencies’ safe sex education initiatives, it has become apparent that
semen of individuals with persistent EBOV is a potentially impor-
tant vehicle to consider for EBOV transmission. For a successful
male-to-female sexual transmission event, EBOV present in semen
must either infect or cross the vaginal epithelium. Recent studies
demonstrate that EBOV is able to infect the vaginal epithelium in
guinea pig models (53). Notably, the amount of infectious virus in
semen has been difficult to determine, but at late time points is
likely much lower than that in bodily fluids during acute illness.
Prior studies on HIV indicate that the enhancement effect of SEVI
is greatest with very low viral inoculums (35); therefore the effect of
SEVI may be disproportionately important in EBOV sexual trans-
mission, especially as seminal viral titers wane. Animal models have
suggested that macrophages and dendritic cells are early targets of
the virus (12, 16–19). Our results indicate that seminal amyloids
enhance infection of epithelial and monocytic cells and subsequent
viral replication and thus could impact early events in sexual
transmission. These cells express numerous attachment factors, in-
cluding DC-SIGN, which increase the efficiency of infection by
EBOV. Whether SEVI permits EBOV to bypass this dependence
upon attachment factors or synergistically enhances attachment is
not known and worth further study.
In addition, our results demonstrate that amyloids impart
resistance of the virus to potentially relevant environmental
stresses, including extended incubations at physiological tem-
peratures and desiccation. The ability of environmental factors
to affect virion properties and infectivity is seen in other systems.
As an example, recent studies have found that bacterial lipo-
polysaccharide (LPS) induces a conformational change in the
poliovirus capsid, increasing virus binding to its cellular receptor
and enhancing the stability of the virion under thermal and oxi-
dative stress (54). These data are similar to those we now report on
the interaction of an enveloped virus and seminal amyloid fibrils.
Unlike the poliovirus and LPS interaction, however, we did not
observe an enhancement in rVSV-EboGP-mCherry tolerance to
oxidative stress in the presence of SEVI (SI Appendix, Fig. S9).
After binding to SEVI, rVSV-EboGP-mCherry binding, internali-
zation, and tolerance to environmental stresses increase. The
mechanism for this enhanced environmental resistance is unclear,
but could involve retention of water molecules by the large amy-
loid fibrils to create a microenvironment surrounding the virions
that is relatively resistant to changes in the larger-scale environ-
ment. The exact characteristics necessary for desiccation tolerance
are unclear, given the unexpected ability of SEVI and SEVI-Ala to
enhance tolerance, while another amyloid did not. Future exper-
iments may involve exploration of the enhancement properties of
a wider array of amyloids, as well as testing other viruses such as
HIV-1. Resistance to environmental factors may be important to
consider when assessing the ability of semen to remain infective
over time. Moreover, the seminal amyloids may represent pro-
phylactic drug targets, as strategies to disassemble the amyloids
have been investigated (34). Finally, the potential role of amyloid
fibrils in viral infection or stability in other physiologic settings
such as the gut should be investigated.
Since the identification of seminal amyloid fibrils as enhancers
of HIV-1 infection in 2007, infection by several viruses with
sexual transmission routes have been found to also be enhanced
by SEVI. Mechanistically, enhancement by seminal amyloids has
been proposed to enhance binding of the virus to the cell by
alleviating repulsive interactions between the viral and cell
membranes. Overall, our results suggest a model in which the
effect on binding is modest, but that SEVI stimulates macro-
pinocytosis to increase viral internalization in addition to
changing the physical properties of the virion (Fig. 4D). The
enhancement of infection of primary monocyte-derived macro-
phages as well as the striking increases in macropinocytosis ob-
served in this study are reminiscent of a recent report in which

 clearance of sperm cells by macrophages is suggested to be en-
hanced by seminal amyloids (55). Parallels between the clear-
ance of spermatocytes by macrophages stimulated to engulf the
cells by phagocytosis, and internalization of EBOV by phagocytic
cells via a similar uptake mechanism are particularly intriguing.
An important limitation of the present study is the inability to
study this phenomenon in an in vivo model, as no model for
EBOV sexual transmission of persistent virus exists, and the chal-
lenges associated with developing one are considerable. However,
seminal fibrils may represent an intriguing prophylactic target since
agents that affect fibril stability or formation may reduce this in-
creased infectivity at a cellular level as well as enhanced viral
stability ex vivo. Altogether, these findings represent analysis of
molecular factors potentially involved in EBOV sexual transmission
and may promote further study of this transmission route of an
important human pathogen.
