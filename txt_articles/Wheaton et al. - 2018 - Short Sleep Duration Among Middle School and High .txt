Short Sleep Duration Among Middle School and High School Students — 
United States, 2015
Anne G. Wheaton, PhD1; Sherry Everett Jones, PhD2; Adina C. Cooper, MA, MEd1; Janet B. Croft, PhD1
Insufficient sleep among children and adolescents is associ-
ated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, injuries, poor 
mental health, attention and behavior problems, and poor 
academic performance (1–4). The American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine has recommended that, for optimal health, children 
aged 6–12 years should regularly sleep 9–12 hours per 24 hours 
and teens aged 13–18 years should sleep 8–10 hours per 24 
hours (1). CDC analyzed data from the 2015 national, state, 
and large urban school district Youth Risk Behavior Surveys 
(YRBSs) to determine the prevalence of short sleep duration 
(<9 hours for children aged 6–12 years and <8 hours for teens 
aged 13–18 years) on school nights among middle school and 
high school students in the United States. In nine states that 
conducted the middle school YRBS and included a question 
about sleep duration in their questionnaire, the prevalence of 
short sleep duration among middle school students was 57.8%, 
with state-level estimates ranging from 50.2% (New Mexico) 
to 64.7% (Kentucky). The prevalence of short sleep duration 
among high school students in the national YRBS was 72.7%. 
State-level estimates of short sleep duration for the 30 states 
that conducted the high school YRBS and included a ques-
tion about sleep duration in their questionnaire ranged from 
61.8% (South Dakota) to 82.5% (West Virginia). The large 
percentage of middle school and high school students who 
do not get enough sleep on school nights suggests a need for 
promoting sleep health in schools and at home and delaying 
school start times to permit students adequate time for sleep.
The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System was designed 
to estimate the prevalence of health risk behaviors among 
students that contribute to the leading causes of death and 
disability in the United States at the national, state, territorial, 
tribal, and large urban school district levels.* Students complete

high school YRBS is conducted by CDC. It uses a three-stage 
cluster sample design to obtain a nationally representative 
sample of students in public and private schools in grades 9–12 
(5). In 2015, the student sample size was 15,624.† The school 
and student response rates were 69% and 86%, respectively, 
resulting in an overall response rate of 60%.§

departments using a two-stage cluster sample designed to pro-
duce representative samples of students in each jurisdiction (5). 
These surveys are independent of CDC’s national YRBS and, 
unlike the national YRBS, are representative of only public 
school students, except in one state. To be included in this report, 
states and large urban school districts had to 1) have at least a 
60% overall response rate, 2) include a question on sleep dura-
tion, and 3) provide permission for CDC to include their data. 
Thirty states and 16 large urban school districts administered 
a high school YRBS and met these criteria. Across these states, 
the student sample sizes ranged from 1,313 (South Dakota) 
to 55,596 (Maryland).¶ The median overall response rate was 
66.5% and ranged from 60% (Indiana and North Carolina) to 
84% (Virginia). Across these large urban school districts, the 
high school student sample sizes ranged from 1,413 (Broward 
County, Florida) to 10,419 (District of Columbia). The median 
overall response rate was 76.5% and ranged from 64% (District 
of Columbia) to 88% (San Diego, California).
Nine states and seven large urban school districts admin-
istered a middle school YRBS and met these criteria. Across 
these states, the student sample sizes ranged from 1,640 
(Kentucky) to 27,104 (Maryland). The median overall response 
rate was 76% and ranged from 68% (Maine) to 85% (Hawaii 
and Virginia). Across these large urban school districts, 
the middle school student sample sizes ranged from 1,333 
¶ https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/2015/ss6506_updated.pdf.
(Los Angeles, California) to 4,533 (Duval County, Florida). 
The median overall response rate was 81% and ranged from 
68% (San Francisco, California) to 86% (Orange County, 
Florida). All data sets were weighted to be representative of 
students in the jurisdiction.
All students in the national, state, and large urban school 
district surveys were asked to respond to this question about 
sleep duration: “On an average school night, how many hours 
of sleep do you get?” Possible responses were 4 or less hours, 
5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, and 10 or more 
hours. Short sleep duration was defined as <9 hours for students 
aged 6–12 years and <8 hours for those aged 13–18 years. The 
analytic samples were composed of students who responded 
to both the sleep duration question and the age question.**
Prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of short 
sleep duration on an average school night were calculated 
overall and by sex, grade, and race/ethnicity for the national 
high school YRBS and for a combined data set composed of 
data from the nine states that included the sleep duration ques-
tion in a middle school YRBS. This combined data set is not 
nationally representative. The overall prevalence and 95% CI 
 
** In response to the question “How old are you?” middle school students could 
select from “10 years old or younger, 11 years old, 12 years old, 13 years old, 
14 years old, 15 years old, or 16 years old or older”; high school students could 
select from “12 years old or younger, 13 years old, 14 years old, 15 years old, 
16 years old, 17 years old, or 18 years old or older.” High school students who 
reported being “18 years old or older” were considered to have a short sleep 
duration if they reported <8 hours of sleep on an average school night.

of short sleep duration also were calculated separately for each 
state and large urban school district at both middle school and 
high school levels. Pairwise differences in short sleep duration 
prevalence among sex, grade, and race/ethnicity subgroups 
were determined using t-tests; differences among estimates 
were considered statistically significant if the t-test p-value was 
<0.05. Analyses accounted for the weighting of the data and 
for the complex sampling designs.
The overall prevalence of short sleep duration among 
middle school students in the nine states combined was 57.8% 
(Table 1). The distribution of sleep duration was 5.9% for 
≤4 hours, 6.0% for 5 hours, 11.0% for 6 hours, 20.0% for 
7 hours, 29.9% for 8 hours, 17.2% for 9 hours, and 10.0% for 
≥10 hours. The prevalence of short sleep duration in this com-
bined sample was higher among female students (59.6%) than 
among male students (56.0%). The prevalence of short sleep 
duration also was highest among students in grade 6 (61.3%), 
lowest among students in grade 8 (53.1%), and higher among 
black (61.1%) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (64.2%) 
students than among white (56.6%), Hispanic (57.3%), 
and Asian (55.5%) students. State-specific estimates of short 
sleep duration ranged from 50.2% (New Mexico) to 64.7% 
(Kentucky). Prevalence estimates for the seven large urban 
school districts ranged from 50.2% (San Francisco, California) 
to 61.8% (Miami-Dade County, Florida).
At the high school level, nationwide, the prevalence of short 
sleep duration was 72.7% (Table 2). The distribution of sleep 
duration was 7.5% for ≤4 hours, 12.6% for 5 hours, 22.9% 
for 6 hours, 29.7% for 7 hours, 20.6% for 8 hours, 5.0% for 
9 hours, and 1.7% for ≥10 hours. The prevalence of short 
sleep duration was higher among female students (75.6%) 
than among male students (69.9%), lower among students in 
grade 9 (65.6%) than in other grades (71.7%–77.6%), and 
higher among black (76.5%) and Asian (79.3%) students than 
white (72.0%) and Hispanic (70.2%) students. State-level 
estimates of short sleep duration for the 30 states ranged from 
61.8% (South Dakota) to 82.5% (West Virginia) (Table 2) 
(Figure). Prevalence estimates for the 16 large urban school 
districts ranged from 69.9% (Los Angeles, California) to 85.6% 
(Broward County, Florida).
Discussion
Children and adolescents who do not get the recommended 
amount of sleep for their age are at increased risk for chronic 
conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and poor mental health, 
as well as injuries, attention and behavioral problems, and 
poor academic performance (1–4). In addition, short sleep 
duration has been found to be associated with engaging in 
health- and injury-related risk behaviors among high school 
students (6,7). The national high school YRBS has included a 
question about sleep duration since 2007, and it is used to track 
the progress of the Healthy People 2020 sleep objective for this 
population (Sleep Health Objective 3: Increase the proportion

of students in grades 9 through 12 who get sufficient sleep).†† 
Nationally, no progress has been made toward this objective: 
the percentage of high school students who get sufficient sleep 
has substantially decreased from 30.9% in 2009, the baseline 
year for this objective, to 27.3% in 2015, the latest year of 
available data.§§ A question about sleep duration was included 
for the first time in 2015 in the standard middle school and 
high school YRBS questionnaires used as the starting point for 
the state and large urban school district YRBS questionnaires. 
As a result, evidence now exists that short sleep duration is 
prevalent among middle school students as well as high school 
students. In addition, at both middle and high school levels, 
in every state and large urban school district with YRBS data 
about sleep duration, a majority of students reported getting 
less than the recommended amount of sleep.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, sleep duration was obtained by self-report and was 
not verified by objective measures such as actigraphy (sensor 
measurement of motor activity) or polysomnography (sleep 
study). Second, a national YRBS is not conducted among 
middle school students. The middle school findings from the 
combined data set cannot be generalized to the entire United

States. Third, at both middle and high school levels, state-level 
data are not available for states that did not administer the 
YRBS, did not include a question about sleep duration on their 
YRBS, or did not achieve a high enough overall response rate 
to obtain weighted data. Finally, YRBS data are representative 
only of students enrolled in school; in 2015, less than 5% of 
children aged 7–17 years were not enrolled in school.¶¶
To ensure their children get enough sleep, parents can sup-
port the practice of good sleep habits. One important habit 
is maintaining a consistent sleep schedule during the school 
week and weekends. Parent-set bedtimes have been linked to 
getting enough sleep among adolescents (8). Evening light 
exposure and technology use are also associated with less sleep 
among adolescents (9). Parents can limit children’s permitted 
use of electronic devices in terms of time (e.g., only before a 
specific time, sometimes referred to as a “media curfew”) and 
place (e.g., not in their child’s bedroom) Other tips for better 
sleep are available at https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/
sleep_hygiene.html. One meta-analysis of school-based sleep 
education programs found that they produced significantly 
longer weekday and weekend total sleep time immediately 
after completion, but that these improvements were not main-
tained at follow-up (10). Researchers designing such programs 
might consider incorporating refresher sessions to maintain 
improvements in sleep duration and sleep hygiene (i.e., habits 
that support good sleep). School districts can also support 
adequate sleep among students by implementing delayed 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Insufficient sleep among children and adolescents is associ-
ated with an increased risk for obesity, diabetes, injuries, poor 
mental health, attention and behavior problems, and poor 
academic performance. Nationwide, approximately two thirds 
of U.S. high school students report sleeping <8 hours per 
night on school nights.
What is added by this report?
This is the first report to provide state-level estimates of short 
sleep duration among middle school and high school students 
using age-specific recommendations from the American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine. A majority of both middle school 
and high school students in states and large urban school 
districts included in this report get less than the recommended 
amount of sleep, putting them at an increased risk for several 
chronic conditions.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The finding that a large percentage of middle school and high 
school students who do not get enough sleep on school nights 
provides an opportunity for promoting sleep health in schools, 
including addition of sleep health to curricula and delaying 
school start times to permit students adequate time for sleep.
school start times as recommended by the American Academy 
of Pediatrics,*** the American Medical Association,††† and the 
American Academy of Sleep Medicine.§§§
