n Alberta, primary care networks were established in 2005 to 
help facilitate both access to primary care and adoption of 
the Patient Medical Home model of care, which focuses on 
chronic disease management, health maintenance and preven-
tion.1,2 Although there is no one structure for primary care net-
works (varying from one co-located clinic to several offices in a 
geographic area), Alberta Health Services provides funding to 
each network ($50 per patient in 2008; $62 per patient in 2017 in 
addition to the usual fee-for-service payments to the physicians) 
 
for the hire of nonphysician health care providers to help provide 
coordinated primary health care to a roster of patients. This 
additional funding cannot be used to support the implementa-
tion of electronic medical records — that is the remit of other 
programs in Alberta that are not tied into participating in primary 
care networks. Primary care networks vary in the deployment of 
their nonphysician funding and the frequency with which non-
physician providers see patients. Further details are available 
at www.health.alberta.ca/services/primary-care-networks.html 
(last accessed Aug. 31, 2017). Primary care network involvement 
is voluntary; in 2017, more than 80% of primary care physicians 
in Alberta were affiliated with a primary care network.
The impact of primary care teams on health care utilization is 
uncertain, with published reports showing benefits that range 
from negligible3–9 to very modest.1,2,10–13 An early evaluation of the 
first wave of Alberta primary care networks reported that individ-
uals with newly diagnosed diabetes had better glycemic control and 
lower rates of emergency department visits or hospital admissions 
for hyper- or hypoglycemia in 2007 if treated in 1 of the 18 primary 
care networks at that time.1 However, the benefits were small: gly-
cated hemoglobin (HbA1C) was 0.07 lower and the absolute reduc-
tion in emergency department visits or hospital admissions was 
0.7 per 1000 patient-months. It is unknown whether benefits would 
accrue for patients with other chronic diseases managed within pri-
mary care networks or whether the improvements would be seen 
when the primary care networks rolled out beyond the early adopt-
ers (who may well practise differently than others).

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Primary care networks 
are designed to facilitate access to inter-
professional, team-based care. We com-
pared health outcomes associated with 
primary care networks versus conven-
tional primary care.
METHODS: We obtained data on all 
adult residents of Alberta who visited a 
primary care physician during fiscal 
years 2008 and 2009 and classified them 
as affiliated with a primary care network 
or not, based on the physician most 
involved in their care. The primary out-
come was an emergency department 
visit or nonelective hospital admission 
for a Patient Medical Home indicator 
condition (asthma, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, heart failure, cor-
onary disease, hypertension and diabe-
tes) within 12 months.
RESULTS: Adults receiving care within a 
primary care network (n = 1 502 916) were 
older and had higher comorbidity bur-
dens than those receiving conventional 
primary care (n = 1 109 941). Patients in a 
primary care network were less likely to 
visit the emergency department for an 
indicator condition (1.4% v. 1.7%, mean 
0.031 v. 0.035 per patient, adjusted risk 
ratio [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.96–0.99) or for any cause (25.5% v. 
30.5%, mean 0.55 v. 0.72 per patient, 
adjusted RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.93–0.94), but 
were more likely to be admitted to hospi-
tal for an indicator condition (0.6% v. 
0.6%, mean 0.018 v. 0.017 per patient, 
adjusted RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.11) or 
all-cause (9.3% v. 9.1%, mean 0.25 v. 0.23 
per patient, adjusted RR 1.08, 95% CI 
1.07–1.09). Patients in a primary care net-
work had 169 fewer all-cause emergency 
department visits and 86 fewer days in 
hospital (owing to shorter lengths of 
stay) per 1000 patient-years.
INTERPRETATION: Care within a primary 
care network was associated with fewer 
emergency department visits and fewer 
hospital days.

We designed this study to examine whether patients of pri-
mary care networks had fewer visits to the emergency depart-
ment and acute care hospital admissions than patients cared for 
by primary care physicians who are not affiliated with a primary 
care network (“conventional primary care”). We explored all-
cause visits or hospital admissions, but also focused on those 
conditions where primary care is felt to have potentially the 
greatest impact on patients’ health status: asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, coronary disease, 
hypertension and diabetes (hereafter referred to as Patient Med-
ical Home indicator conditions).14
Methods
Design and setting
Alberta has a government-funded health care system that pro-
vides more than 4.4 million people with universal access to hos-
pital, emergency department and physician services and is free 
at the point of care. In this prospective cohort study, we focused 
on the fiscal years 2008 and 2009, being the period when approx-
imately half of Alberta primary care physicians were affiliated 
with primary care networks.
Data sources
This study used the Discharge Abstract Database, which records 
the admission date, discharge date, most responsible diagnosis 
and up to 24 other diagnoses for all acute care hospital admis-
sions; the Ambulatory Care Database, which records all patient 
visits to the offices of hospital-based physicians or to emergency 
departments, with coding for of up to 10 conditions, including 
the most responsible diagnosis; the Physician Claims Database, 
which tracks all physician claims for outpatient services and 
includes up to 3 diagnoses per encounter; and the Alberta Health 
Care Insurance Registry.
Study cohort and identification of exposure
We identified all Albertans aged 20 years or older who were 
seen by a primary care physician at least once in fiscal years 
2008 or 2009. We stratified them into affiliation with a primary 
care network or not, based on the physician who provided most 
of their outpatient primary care in the 2 years of the study. 
Alberta Health renews its list of physicians affiliated with a pri-
mary care network each fiscal year. We assigned each patient 
an index date (their first visit to a primary care physician during 
the study period) and analyzed all events in the first year after 
the index date.
Covariates
We used International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision 
(ICD-9) and 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes from the Discharge 
Abstract Database for any hospital admissions, any emergency 
department visits and any outpatient visits in the 2 years before 
the index visit, to identify comorbidities. The validity of diagno-
ses captured in these data sets using 2 hits in the outpatient or 
emergency department records or 1 hit in the Discharge Abstract 
Database has been established in Alberta.15,16
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients having an 
emergency department visit or hospital admission for nonelective 
acute care for a most responsible diagnosis linked to any of the 
Patient Medical Home indicator conditions (Appendix 1, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170385/-/DC1) — 
these are the same as the Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions 
defined by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, but do 
not include epilepsy. Secondary outcomes included the proportion 
of patients with an all-cause emergency department visit or hospi-
tal admission, the individual components of the primary outcome, 
hospital length of stay for those hospitalized, 30-day readmission 
rates after hospital discharge and 30-day repeat emergency depart-
ment visits, using previously published definitions.17 All events for 
each patient were counted, but visits to the emergency department 
that resulted in a hospital admission during the same encounter or 
transfers between emergency departments or hospitals in the 
same episode of care were counted as only 1 event. 
In order to further explore rates of readmission to hospital, 
emergency department visits, or death for patients who were 
recently admitted to hospital and who were actively engaged 
with their primary care physician, we conducted a sensitivity 
analysis for those patients who had been discharged within 
90 days of their index visit to a physician as an outpatient. This 
cohort was divided into 3 risk groups based on their comorbidity 
level (a summary score based on clinical risk groupings for all 
hospital admissions in the previous year). Low-risk groups are 
defined as those with a total comorbidity factor of 0%–24%; 
moderate-risk groups with comorbidity scores of 25%–50%; and 
high-risk groups as those with > 50% comorbidity levels in the 
Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract 
Database file.
Statistical analyses
We compared patient baseline characteristics and examined the 
association between care through a primary care network and 
outcomes using a series of zero-inflated Poisson models with 
total emergency department utilization and hospital admission 
for Patient Medical Home indicator conditions and all causes. 
Additionally, we created a series of logistic regression models for 
the individual indicator conditions. In the first set of models for 
each analysis, the covariates we adjusted for included age, sex 
and all of the clinical comorbidities listed in Table 1. In the second 
set of models, we included health system factors including the 
number of visits with a primary care physician, the geographic 
zone in which the primary care network was situated (the prov-
ince is divided into 5 zones within Alberta Health Services) and 
socioeconomic factors (whether the patient had a rural or urban 
residence and the postal code–based Pampalon material and 
social deprivation index: www.cihi.ca/en/deprivation -in 
-canadian-cities-an-analytical-tool, last accessed Aug. 31, 2017).18 
We accounted for clustering within primary care networks by 
incorporating the primary care network identification number as 
a random-effect variable. We also conducted a sensitivity analy-
sis in which we included only patients with at least 2 visits to a 
primary care physician in the previous year and we compared

results in the 2 cohorts (primary care network v. conventional 
primary care) matched by age, sex and geographic zone and 
Charlson Comorbidity Index score. As we did not have informa-
tion on date of death (only whether a patient was alive or not 
during each fiscal year), we explored the impact of mortality as a 
competing risk by conducting a sensitivity analysis that excluded 
any patients who had died or emigrated during the study period.
Ethics approval
This retrospective cohort study received ethics approval from the 
University of Alberta (Pro00048445) with a waiver of informed 
consent because we were using de-identified data.
Results
In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, there were 30 primary care net-
works in Alberta involving 1709 physicians with 2 257 111 
patients on their rosters: 1 502 916 Albertan adults received out-
patient care from a primary care physician affiliated with a pri-
mary care network, and 1 109 941 received conventional primary 
care. Patients in a primary care network were older (46 v. 44 yr), 
had more chronic conditions, had higher comorbidity burdens 
and saw their primary care physician more frequently (Table 1).
Patients receiving outpatient care from physicians affiliated 
with a primary care network were less likely to present to an 
emergency department for any cause (25.5% v. 30.5%, absolute 
risk difference 5.0%, number needed to treat 20; mean emer-
gency department visits 0.55 v. 0.72 per patient; both p < 0.001) 
or for an indicator condition (1.4% v. 1.7%, mean emergency 
department visits 0.03 v. 0.04 per patient, both p < 0.001). 
Adjusting for socioeconomic status and health system fac-
tors (frequency of visits, rural or urban residence, health author-
ity zone) in the Poisson models (in addition to patient demo-
graphics and clinical covariates) resulted in less pronounced but 
still significant associations between primary care network affili-
ation and lower risk of emergency department visits for any 
cause or for indicator conditions (Table 2). Similar significant 
associations were also seen in the matched cohort analysis. 
Including “outpatient visits with an internal medicine specialist” 
did not alter the magnitude of the associations (data not 
shown). The association between receiving care from a physi-
cian affiliated with a primary care network and lower rates of 
visits to emergency departments  or hospital admissions was 
significant for 4 of the indicator conditions in the multivariable 
model adjusting for demographics and clinical comorbidities, 
but in only 2 (lower for hypertension, higher for coronary artery 
disease) after also adjusting for health system use and socioeco-
nomic status (Figure 1).
Hospital admissions were more likely for patients in a primary 
care network, both for indicator conditions (0.6% v. 0.6%, and 
mean 0.018 v. 0.017 per patient, adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.07, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.11) and for any cause (9.3% v. 
9.1%, mean 0.25 v. 0.23 per patient, adjusted RR 1.08, 95% CI 
1.07–1.09). This excess risk persisted even after excluding

(adjusted RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.10–1.12) remained significantly 
higher for patients in a primary care network, and all-cause 
emergency department visits remained significantly lower 
(adjusted RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95–0.96).
The number of days in hospital (986 v. 1072, p < 0.0001) and 
the number of emergency department visits (552 v. 721, 
p < 0.0001) per 1000 patient-years were significantly lower for 
patients in a primary care network. Mean length of stay for 
patients in hospital (6.99 v. 7.52 d, p = 0.001), mean inpatient cost 
per patient ($1102 v. $1254, p = 0.001), 30-day readmissions 
(7.8% v. 9.0%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.83–8.88]), 
and repeat emergency department visits within 30 days (24.5% v. 
29.1%, adjusted OR 0.79 [0.78–0.80]) were all lower for patients in 
a primary care network. Restricting this analysis to only those 
patients who had been admitted to hospital within 90 days of 
their index visit to primary care as an outpatient confirmed that 
30-day rates of readmission or mortality (4.1% v. 6.3%, adjusted 
OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.60–0.68) or emergency department visits 
(43.3% v. 46.8%, adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.92–0.97) were lower 
for patients actively engaged with a primary care network, with 
the magnitude of difference being greatest for patients with 
more comorbidities (Table 3).
Of the emergency department visits, most (56.7% for patients 
in a primary care network and 55.9% for patients in conven-
tional primary care) occurred outside of normal working hours 
(08:00–17:00 Monday to Friday). The association between affilia-
tion with a primary care network and lower emergency depart-
ment visit rates was similar whether looking at after-office hours 
(RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.79–0.80) or during-office hours (RR 0.78, 95% 
CI 0.77–0.78).
Interpretation
We found that patients who received outpatient care from physi-
cians affiliated with primary care networks were significantly less 
likely to present to an emergency department for any reason or 
for Patient Medical Home indicator conditions, suggesting 
improved access to primary care. Although patients of physicians 
affiliated with primary care networks were slightly more likely to 
be admitted to hospital for nonelective causes, lengths of stay 
were shorter, such that patients affiliated with a primary care 
network spent 86 fewer days in hospital per 1000 patient-years.

were fewer emergency department visits or hospital admissions 
for hypertension, but more for chronic coronary disease (not 
acute coronary syndromes). We suspect this reflects increased 
frequency of contact (allowing more frequent checks of blood 
pressure and thus better hypertension control v. more frequent 
contact, which increases the likelihood of a patient reporting 
chest pain, leading to a recommendation to attend an emer-
gency department), but it may also just be chance. Moreover, 
30-day readmission rates and repeat emergency department vis-
its were all significantly lower after hospital discharge in patients 
affiliated with primary care networks.
Comparison with other studies
Another Canadian province, Ontario, has taken a different tack in 
its efforts at primary care reform. Its analysis of family health 
teams (akin to Alberta primary care networks with interprofes-
sional teams and blended capitation physician payments) 
reported no statistically significant differences in emergency 
department visits or hospital admission rates for chronic condi-
tions compared with 4 other primary care models in the same 
province between 2004 and 2012.19 Further research that focuses 
on process differences between Ontario family health teams and 
Alberta primary care networks is needed to explore the reasons 
for these differential effects.
On the other hand, our findings are similar to those reported 
by Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, where team-based care was 
associated with significantly lower rates of all-cause emergency 
department visits (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.74–0.80) 
and ambulatory care–sensitive emergency department visits or 
hospital admissions (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.70–0.85) compared with 
traditional primary care practices, with similar absolute differences 
to those we observed (5.4% absolute reduction in emergency 
department visits).10 However, unlike in our study, they found that 
the rate of all-cause hospital admissions was significantly lower

(IRR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85–0.94, absolute risk difference 1.2 per 100 
person-years). Although this may be attributable to the substan-
tial clinical decision support technology and standardized chronic 
disease management pathways in their system, it may also be 
because they had a higher proportion of hospital admissions 
owing to Patient Medical Home indicator conditions than we did 
(one-sixth v. one-sixteenth in our cohort). Our proportion of 
admissions that are related to Patient Medical Home indicator 
conditions is closer to that reported by the Seattle Group Health 
Cooperative,12 which found no significant difference in all-cause 
hospital admissions (but a 29% relative reduction in all-cause 
emergency department visits) with a team-based primary care 
model similar to Alberta’s Primary Care Networks.
Although the Utah,10 Seattle13 and Ontario20 groups reported 
higher rates of some quality-of-care measures in team-based 
practices, it is important to note that not all process measures 
were improved in any of the settings — for example, blood pres-
sure control rates were lower with team-based care in Utah and 
cancer screening rates were lower in Ontario. We were unable to 
examine quality of care in this study, although such an evalua-
tion is currently ongoing in Alberta.
It is unclear to what extent our findings may be a result of better 
continuity of care in primary care networks. Primary care studies in 
multiple settings (including Europe, the United Kingdom, the United 
States and Australia) have shown that patients with greater phys-
ician continuity are less likely to use emergency departments or 
require hospital admissions, especially patients with chronic condi-
tions or multiple comorbidities.21–24 Future studies should evaluate 
continuity metrics for patients treated in primary care networks, 
particularly in light of studies suggesting that older patients see a 
median of 2 primary care physicians and 5 specialists per year.25
Limitations
Although we were able to analyze all health care interactions for 
an entire Canadian province, there are some limitations to our 
study. Most importantly, we cannot infer causation, as unmea-
sured confounders (including patient health behaviours and pro-
vider demographics) may have differed between patients treated 
in primary care networks and conventional primary care. Sec-
ond, although the amount of nonphysician team care provided 
likely differed between primary care networks, we do not have 
data on the frequency of visits to nonphysician health care pro-
viders and thus cannot comment on the incremental benefits of 
particular care elements. Third, we were unable to evaluate 
timeliness of access or patient satisfaction, and without access 
to actual laboratory values or physical measures, we cannot 
comment on the quality of care delivered to this cohort of 
patients. Fourth, we have no information on whether physicians 
affiliated with a primary care network were more likely to have 
electronic medical records; nor do we have any data on the qual-
ity of communication or coordination between different mem-
bers of the health care team in primary care network practices. 
Finally, as the data were provided to us by Alberta Health in de-
identified fashion, with the primary care network designation 
assigned to the patient file without details of their specific 
provider(s), we cannot create propensity scores for provider fac-
tors or adjust for potential clustering at the level of individual 
physicians, or the length of time particular physicians have been 
practising in a primary care network.
Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that a province-wide program to promote 
team-based primary care is a feasible and effective way to reduce 
use of emergency departments for Patient Medical Home indica-
tor conditions or for any cause (a potential marker of improved 
access to care). Although physician pay for performance is often 
emphasized in efforts to reform primary care,26 the potential 
impact on the population seen with the Alberta primary care net-
work natural experiment (169 fewer emergency department visits 
and 86 fewer hospital days per 1000 patient-years) is larger than 
has been seen with incentive payments for primary care physi-
cians in various settings.27–29 Although the primary care network 
model holds substantial promise, a similar model in Ontario was 
not associated with similar effects. Thus, further research is 
required to explore the variation in implementation and process 
between Ontario family health teams and Alberta primary care 
networks, which may account for these differences.
