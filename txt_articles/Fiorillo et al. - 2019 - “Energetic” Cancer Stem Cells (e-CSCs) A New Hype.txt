Here, we provide the necessary evidence that mitochondrial metabolism drives the
anchorage-independent proliferation of CSCs. Two human breast cancer cell lines,
MCF7 [ER(+)] and MDA-MB-468 (triple-negative), were used as model systems. To
directly address the issue of metabolic heterogeneity in cancer, we purified a new
distinct sub-population of CSCs, based solely on their energetic profile. We propose
the term “energetic” cancer stem cells (e-CSCs), to better describe this novel cellular
phenotype. In a single step, we first isolated an auto-fluorescent cell sub-population,
based on their high flavin-content, using flow-cytometry. Then, these cells were further
subjected to a detailed phenotypic characterization. More specifically, e-CSCs were more
glycolytic, with higher mitochondrial mass and showed significantly elevated oxidative
metabolism. e-CSCs also demonstrated an increased capacity to undergo cell cycle
progression, as well as enhanced anchorage-independent growth and ALDH-positivity.
Most importantly, these e-CSCs could be effectively targeted by treatments with
either (i) OXPHOS inhibitors (DPI) or (ii) a CDK4/6 inhibitor (Ribociclib). Finally, we
were able to distinguish two distinct phenotypic sub-types of e-CSCs, depending
on whether they were grown as 2D-monolayers or as 3D-spheroids. Remarkably,
under 3D anchorage-independent growth conditions, e-CSCs were strictly dependent
on oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Unbiased proteomics analysis demonstrated
the up-regulation of gene products specifically related to the anti-oxidant response,
mitochondrial energy production, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Therefore, mitochondrial
inhibitors should be further developed as promising anti-cancer agents, to directly target
and eliminate the “fittest” e-CSCs. Our results have important implications for using
e-CSCs, especially those derived from 3D-spheroids, (i) in tumor tissue bio-banking and
(ii) as a new cellular platform for drug development.

“Energetic” Cancer Stem Cells (e-CSCs)
INTRODUCTION
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are tumor-initiating cells (TICs)
which are resistant to conventional cancer therapies, such as
chemo-therapy and radiation treatment. As a consequence,
CSCs are responsible for (i) tumor recurrence and (ii) distant
metastasis, driving treatment failure, and poor clinical outcomes
in cancer patients (1, 2). Therefore, innovative approaches are
necessary to understand how to tackle the problem of CSCs.
Mechanistically, this may be related to the ability of CSCs
to survive and thrive under harsh conditions and different
micro-environments (1–4). Since CSCs are an especially small
sub-set of the tumor cell population, their metabolic and
phenotypic properties have remained largely uncharacterized,
until recently.
Moreover, CSCs are strikingly resilient and highly resistant
to cellular stress, which allows them to undergo anchorage-
independent growth, especially under conditions of low-
attachment (1, 2). As a consequence, they form 3D spheroids,
which retain the properties of CSCs and stem cell progenitors. In
contrast, when subjected to growth in suspension, most “bulk”
cancer cells die, via anoikis—a specialized type of apoptosis.
As such, the clonal propagation of a single CSC results in the
production of a 3D spheroid and does not involve the self-
aggregation of cancer cells. Therefore, 3D spheroid formation is
a functional read-out for stemness in epithelial cancer cells and
allows one to enrich for a population of epithelioid cells with
a stem-like phenotype. These 3D spheroids are also known as
mammospheres when they are prepared using breast cancer cells,
such as MCF7, among others.
Previously, we generated 3D spheroids from 2 distinct ER(+)
cells lines (MCF7 and T47D) and scaled-up their preparation so
that they could be subjected to unbiased label-free proteomics
analysis (5). This approach was taken to begin to decipher the
phenotypic behavior of CSCs at a molecular level. 3D spheroids
were directly compared with monolayers of these cell lines
and processed in parallel. This allowed us to determine the
proteomic features that are characteristic of the CSC phenotype
in 3D spheroids, relative to monolayers. Based on this molecular
analysis, we observed that mammospheres are significantly
enriched in mitochondrial proteins. These mitochondrial-
related proteins included molecules involved in beta-oxidation
and ketone metabolism/re-utilization, mitochondrial biogenesis,
electron transport, ADP/ATP exchange/transport, CoQ synthesis
and ROS production, as well as the suppression of mitophagy.
As such, increased mitochondrial protein synthesis or decreased
mitophagy could allow the accumulation of mitochondrial mass
in CSCs. As a consequence, we proposed that CSCs might
become resistant to conventional therapies, by “boosting” ATP
production using elevated mitochondrial OXPHOS metabolism.
Consistent with this view, a variety of mitochondrial
inhibitors successfully blocked 3D tumor sphere formation,
including (i) FDA-approved antibiotics (doxycycline, tigecycline,
azithromycin, pyrvinium pamoate, atovaquone, bedaquiline), (ii)
natural compounds (actinonin, CAPE, berberine, brutieridin,
and melitidin), as well as (iii) experimental compounds
[oligomycin and AR- C155858 (an MCT1/2 inhibitor)] (6).
Taken together, all of these findings prompted us to
employ mitochondrial mass as a new metabolic biomarker to
purify CSCs. Using this overall approach, we observed that
it was possible to significantly enrich CSC activity using only
MitoTracker, as a single marker for both ER(+) (MCF7) and
ER(–) (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines. Remarkably,
the MitoTracker-high cells were chemo-resistant to Paclitaxel,
exhibiting resistance to the Paclitaxel-induced DNA-damage
response (7).
One emerging idea is that there is diverse metabolic
heterogeneity in the CSC population (3, 4). To test this
hypothesis, here we used a flow-cytometry approach to
metabolically fractionate the cancer cell population into “low-
energy” and “high-energy” cell sub-populations. For this
purpose, we used auto-fluorescence as an endogenous marker
of their energetic state. In this context, we focused on auto-
fluorescence attributed to the endogenous flavin-containing
metabolites, such as FAD, FMN and riboflavin (Vitamin B2)
(8–16). Most importantly, we investigated if their growth in a
2D or 3D micro-environment affected their metabolic rate and
stem-like properties.
Our current results provide novel evidence for the existence of
an “energetic” CSC phenotype, which may represent the “fittest”
CSCs. Remarkably, these e-CSCs are both (i) metabolically-active
and (ii) hyper-proliferative, as well as (iii) critically-dependent on
a 3D micro-environment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Breast Cancer Cell Models and Other
Reagents
Human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 [ER(+)] and MDA-
MB-468 (triple-negative), were obtained commercially from the
ATCC. Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM; GIBCO), supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% Glutamax, and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin. All cell lines were
maintained at 37◦C in 5% CO2. Diphenyleneiodonium chloride
(DPI) and Ribociclib were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.
Cell Sorting: Flow-Cytometry and
Collection of Auto-Fluorescent Cells
MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells were first grown either as a 2D-
monolayer or as 3D-spheroids (8, 14, 16, 17). Then, they were
collected and dissociated into a single-cell suspension, prior to
analysis or sorting by flow-cytometry with the SONY SH800 Cell
Sorter. Briefly, auto-fluorescent cells were excited with a 488 nm
blue laser and selected at the intersection with filters 525/50
and 585/30. The “Low” and “High” auto-fluorescent cell sub-
populations were selected by gating, within the auto-fluorescence
signal. Only cells with the least (bottom 5%) or the most (top
5%) auto-fluorescence signal were collected. The cells outside
the gates were discarded during sorting, due to the gate settings.
However, such settings are required, to ensure high-purity during
sorting. To better characterize the auto-fluorescent cell sub-
populations, the following flow-cytometry markers were used:

“Energetic” Cancer Stem Cells (e-CSCs)
and MitoTracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Hoescht
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for cell cycle analysis. Data
were analyzed with FlowJo 10.1 software.
Preparing Cells for Auto-Fluorescent Cell
Sorting by Flow-Cytometry
We used the following protocol to acquire and sort auto-
fluorescent cells from 2D-monolayers or 3D-spheroid cell
suspensions. For 2D-monolayers, we seeded MCF7 and MDA-
MB-468 in a 225 cm2 flask and when ∼70% confluence was
reached, 5 ml of 0.025% trypsin was added to the flasks and
incubated at 37◦C for 5 min. After that the cells were re-
suspended in media and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. After
centrifugation, the cell pellets were adjusted to a concentration of
106 cells/ml in in PBS Ca/Mg for acquisition or in sorting buffer
[1× PBS containing 3% (v/v) FBS and 2 mM EDTA] for FACS.
For 3D-spheroid suspensions, after 5 days of growth under
low-attachment condition, the spheres were collected from
six 225 cm2 flasks pre-coated with poly-HEMA and gently
centrifuged at 100 g for 5 min. After centrifugation, we added
1 ml of 0.025% of trypsin to the “sphere-pellet” and incubated
them at 37◦C for 5 min. Using a 25-gauge needle, we passed
the sphere-suspension through the syringe 4 times. The sphere
suspension was then centrifuged again at 100 g for 5 min, and the
sphere-pellet was re-suspended in (i) PBS Ca/Mg for acquisition
or (ii) in sorting buffer [1× PBS containing 3% (v/v) FBS and
2 mM EDTA] for FACS and we “syringed” the suspension again 4
times.
After creating these single-cell suspensions, we subjected them
to standard flow-cytometry (using the SONY SH800 Cell Sorter)
to isolate the auto-fluorescent cell sub-populations, as indicated
above. Examples of flow-cytometry plots are included in the
figures, and the gating strategy is shown.
Mammosphere Formation Assay (for
Generating 3D-Spheroids)
A single-cell suspension was prepared using enzymatic, and
manual disaggregation (25 gauge needle) (18). Then, cells were
plated at a density of 500 cells/cm2 in mammosphere medium
(DMEM-F12 + B27 + 20 ng/ml EGF + PenStrep) under
non-adherent conditions, in culture dishes pre-coated with (2-
hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (poly-HEMA, Sigma, #P3932), called
“mammosphere plates.” Cells were grown for 5 days and
maintained in a humidified incubator at 37◦C. After 5 days
of culture, 3D-spheres >50 µm were counted using an eye
piece (“graticule”), and the percentage of cells plated which
formed spheres was calculated and is referred to as percent
mammosphere formation, and was normalized to one (1 = 100%
MFE). Mammosphere formation efficiency was analyzed in both
the “low” and “high” sub-populations of auto-fluorescent cells,
generated from either 2D-monolayers (M-L vs. M-H) or 3D-
spheroids (S-L vs. S-H). All mammosphere experiments were
performed in triplicate, at least 3 times independently.
ALDEFLUOR Assay
The level of ALDH activity was assessed, by using the fluorescent
reagent
ALDEFLUOR.
The
ALDEFLUOR
kit
(StemCell
technologies, Durham, NC, USA) was used to detect the cell sub-
populations with various amounts of ALDH enzymatic activity
by FACS (Attune NxT Flow Cytometer). Briefly, 1 × 105 cells
were incubated in 1 ml ALDEFLUOR assay buffer containing
ALDH substrate (5 µl/ml) for 40 min at 37◦C. In each experiment
a sample of cells was stained under identical conditions with
30 µM of diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), a specific ALDH
inhibitor, as a negative control The ALDH-positive population
was established, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and was evaluated using 50,000 cells. All the ALDH experiments
were performed three times independently.
Seahorse XFe96 Metabolic Flux Analysis
Real-time oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) and extracellular
acidification
rates
(ECAR)
rates
were
determined
using
the Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XFe96) analyzer (Seahorse
Bioscience, USA) (19–21). Briefly, 2 × 104 cells per well were
seeded into XFe96 well cell culture plates after sorting, and
incubated for 12 h to allow cell attachment. After 12 h of
incubation, cells were washed in pre-warmed XF assay media
(or for OCR measurement, XF assay media supplemented with
10 mM glucose, 1 mM Pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, and adjusted
at 7.4 pH). Cells were then maintained in 175 µL/well of XF
assay media at 37◦C, in a non-CO2 incubator for 1 h. During
the incubation time, we loaded 25 µL of 80 mM glucose, 9 µM
oligomycin, and 1M 2-deoxyglucose (for ECAR measurement)
or 10 µM oligomycin, 9 µM FCCP, 10 µM rotenone, 10 µM
antimycin A (for OCR measurement), in XF assay media into
the injection ports in the XFe96 sensor cartridge (20, 21).
Measurements were normalized by protein content (SRB assay)
and Hoechst 33342 content. Data sets were analyzed using XFe96
software and GraphPad Prism software, using one-way ANOVA
and Student’s t-test calculations. All experiments were performed
in quintuplicate, three times independently.
Vital Mitochondrial Staining
Cells were trypsinized and re-suspended into a 1 × 106 cell/ml
solution in PBS. MitoTracker Deep-Red (10 nM; Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was added for 30 min at 37◦C before centrifugation
and re-suspension in PBS Ca/Mg for FACS analysis (ATTUNE
NxT) or Cell Sorting (SONY SH 800). All subsequent steps were
performed in the dark. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo
software.
Cell Cycle Analysis
We performed cell-cycle analysis on the auto-fluorescent cell
sub-populations, by FACS analysis using the SONY Cell
Sorter. Briefly, after trypsinization, the re-suspended cells were
incubated with 10 ng/ml of Hoescht solution (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 40 min at 37◦C under dark conditions. Following
a 40 min period, the cells were washed and re-suspended in PBS
Ca/Mg for acquisition or in sorting buffer [1× PBS containing
3% (v/v) FBS and 2 mM EDTA] for FACS. We analyzed 50,000
events per condition Gated cells were manually-categorized into
cell-cycle stages.

Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6. Data were
represented as mean ± SD (or ± SEM where indicated). All
experiments were conducted at least 3 times independently, with
>3 technical replicates for each experimental condition tested
(unless stated otherwise, e.g., when representative data is shown).
Statistically significant differences were determined using the
Student’s t-test or the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. For
the comparison among multiple groups, one-way ANOVA were
used to determine statistical significance. P ≤ 0.05 was considered
significant and all statistical tests were two-sided.
Proteomics Analysis
Label-free unbiased proteomics and Ingenuity pathway analysis
(IPA) were carried out, essentially as previously described, using
standard protocols, with relatively minor modifications (5, 22–
25).
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
Unbiased interrogation and analysis of our proteomic data sets
was carried out by employing a bioinformatics platform, known
as IPA (Ingenuity systems, http://www.ingenuity.com). IPA
assists with data interpretation, via the grouping of differentially
expressed genes or proteins into known functions and pathways.
Pathways with a z score of > +2 were considered as significantly
activated, while pathways with a z score of <-2 were considered
as significantly inhibited.
Clinical Relevance of e-CSC Marker Proteins
To validate the clinical relevance of our findings, we first assessed
whether the e-CSC targets that we identified in MCF7 cells
were also transcriptionally upregulated in human breast cancer
cells in vivo. For this purpose, we employed a published clinical
data set of N = 28 breast cancer patients in which their tumor
samples were subjected to laser-capture micro-dissection (5, 26),
to physically separate epithelial cancer cells from their adjacent
tumor stroma.
Kaplan-Meier (K-M) Analyses
To perform K-M analysis on mRNA transcripts, we used an
open-access online survival analysis tool to interrogate publically
available microarray data from up to 3,455 breast cancer patients.
This allowed us to determine their prognostic value (27). For
this purpose, we primarily analyzed data from ER(+) patients
that were LN(+) at diagnosis and were of the luminal A sub-
type, that were primarily treated with tamoxifen and not other
chemotherapy (N = 150 patients). In this group, 100% the
patients received some form of hormonal therapy and ∼95%
of them received tamoxifen. Biased and outlier array data were
excluded from the analysis. This allowed us to identify metabolic
gene transcripts, with significant prognostic value. Hazard-ratios
were calculated, at the best auto-selected cut-off, and p-values
were calculated using the log-rank test and plotted in R.
K-M curves were also generated online using the K-M-plotter
(as high-resolution TIFF files), using univariate analysis: http://
kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&cancer=breast.
FIGURE 1 | Mitochondria and CSCs. Here, we propose the testable
hypothesis that mitochondria are the “engines” that drive cell-cycle progression
and proliferation in CSCs, especially under anchorage-independent growth
conditions.
This allowed us to directly perform in silico validation of
these metabolic biomarker candidates. The 2017 version of
the database was utilized for all these analyses, while virtually
identical results were also obtained with the 2014 and 2012
versions.
RESULTS
Dissecting Metabolic Heterogeneity in
CSCs
Here, we used two human breast cancer cell lines (i.e., MCF7
and MDA-MB-468) as model systems, to dissect the role of
metabolic heterogeneity in tumorigenesis. Results with MCF7
cells are shown in the main text Figures 4–11, Tables 1–3 and
Tables S1–S6, while results with MDA-MB-468 cells are included
in Figures S1–S3. MCF7 cells are ER(+), while MDA-MB-
468 cells are triple-negative. Quantitatively similar results were
obtained with both model cell lines.
We hypothesized that mitochondria may function as the
metabolic “engines” to drive cellular hyper-proliferation and,
ultimately, anchorage-independent growth, leading to tumor
recurrence and metastasis (Figure 1). Moreover, we speculated
that at least two different sub-populations of CSCs may exist,
depending on whether the cells are grown as 2D-monolayers or
as 3D-spheroids (Figure 2). To investigate this hypothesis, we
used cell auto-fluorescence as an endogenous marker of cellular
energy metabolism, which directly reflects their content of flavin-
containing compounds [FAD, FMN, and riboflavin (Vitamin
B2)], which are all high-energy cell metabolites (Figure 3).
As a consequence, 2D-monolayers and 3D-spheroids were
first collected and used to prepare single-cell suspensions. These
suspensions were then subjected to flow-cytometry to isolate cells

“Energetic” Cancer Stem Cells (e-CSCs)
FIGURE 2 | Metabolic heterogeneity in CSCs. We hypothesized that different
sub-types or sub-classes of CSCs may exist and that they may differ in their
energetic phenotype, based on whether they are physically grown as either
2D-monolayers or 3D-spheroids. We speculated that the transition from a 2D
environment to a 3D format would involve an epithelial mesenchymal transition
(EMT). Due to the stress of the transition from 2D to 3D growth, it could require
additional energy production, possibly afforded by mitochondrial metabolism.
FIGURE 3 | Detecting and purifying “energetic” CSCs (e-CSCs). In order to
isolate CSCs, single cell suspensions of MCF7 cells were first subjected to
metabolic fractionation by flow cytometry, based on the endogenous
auto-fluorescence (AF) of FAD/FMN, high-energy metabolites. The high (H) and
low (L) sub-populations of AF cells were then collected from MCF7 cells grown
either as (i) 2D-monolayers or (ii) 3D-spheroids. These “high-energy” AF(+)
cells were then designated as: e-CSCs (2D) and e-CSCs (3D).
based on their auto-fluorescent properties. Briefly, the “Low-
(L)” and “High-(H)” auto-fluorescent cell sub-populations were
selected by gating, within the auto-fluorescence signal. Only cells
with the least (bottom 5%) or the most (top 5%) auto-fluorescent
signal were collected.
Both the “Low” and “High” sub-populations of auto-
fluorescent cells, generated from either 2D-monolayers (M-L
vs. M-H) or 3D-spheroids (S-L vs. S-H) were then subjected
to a detailed phenotypic characterization (Figure 3). The M-
H (“monolayer-high”) and S-H (“spheroid-high”) cell sub-
populations were predicted to be the most energetic, based on
their high (H) flavin-content.
A more detailed technical version of this enrichment work-
flow is briefly summarized in Figure 4A, as accomplished via
flow-cytometry. Based on the forward- and side-scatter analysis
of single cells, highly auto-fluorescent cells (shown in RED)
are clearly larger in size, than cells with low auto-fluorescence
(shown in GREEN) (Figure 4B).
Characterization of the e-CSC Phenotype:
Proliferation, “Stemness” and
Bioenergetics
Proliferation
First, we assessed their capacity for cell proliferation, via cell
cycle progression analysis. Representative cell cycle profiles for
different cell sub-populations of MCF7 are shown in Figure 5.
Interestingly, the M-H cell and S-H cell sub-populations were
exceedingly hyper-proliferative, with a reduction of cells in the
G0/G1-phase and dramatic increases in both the S-phase and
the G2/M-phase. Also, the number of polyploid cells (DNA
>2N) was increased considerably in both the M-H and S-H
populations. Overall, S-H cells were the most hyper-proliferative,
with >40% of the cells in S-phase and/or G2/M, and <40% of the
cells in the G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle. S-H cells also had the
largest number of polyploid cells, reaching ∼12–17%, probably
due to mitotic catastrophe.
In contrast, M-L cells had the highest number of cells in the
G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle (∼80%) and the lowest number
of polyploid cells (∼3–5%). Also, M-L cells showed the lowest
number of cells in S-phase (∼3–4%).
These hyper-proliferative results with MCF7 cells (Table 1;
Figure 5) and MDA-MB-468 cells (See Table 2; Figure S1) are
also consistent with a high-energy phenotype. Therefore, they
were designated as “energetic” CSCs.
Stem Cell Characteristic(s)
To carefully monitor the progressive enrichment of CSCs,
we first used ALDH as a marker of “stemness” activity.
Figures 6A,B clearly shows that relative to the cells with the
least flavin (M-L), all the other cells showed the progressive
enrichment of ALDH activity. Remarkably, M-H cells and S-H
cells showed a 2-fold and a near 9-fold enrichment of ALDH-
activity, respectively (Table 3). Their stem-like phenotype was
further validated by using the mammosphere assay to measure
anchorage-independent growth and by quantitatively measuring
their mitochondrial mass, with a vital dye (namely, MitoTracker
Deep Red).
Figure 6C illustrates that relative to control cells, the M-H and
S-H cell sub-populations formed mammospheres with greater
efficiency, ∼1.6- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Figure 6D shows their
mitochondrial status. Relative to M-L cells, M-H cells showed a
clear ∼1.45-fold increase in mitochondrial mass. Interestingly,

FIGURE 4 | Technical scheme for isolating e-CSCs, via flow-cytometry. (A) See “Experimental Procedures” for a more detailed explanation. Briefly, single-cell
suspensions were prepared from 2D-monolayers or 3D-spheroid cell cultures. Then, these single-cell suspensions were subjected to flow-cytometry, using the SONY
SH800 cell sorter. This allowed us to select the flavin-specific auto-fluorescent (AF) cell population by gating. First, only live cells were selected; then, only singlet cells
were selected, by using the forward- and side-scatter parameters. Ultimately, the “AF-high” (top 5%) and the “AF-low” (bottom 5%) sub-populations were selected, by
plotting the signal from the 488(535/30) nm laser vs. the 488 (585/50) nm laser. (B) Plotting forward scatter vs. side scatter gives an estimate of relative cell size. Note
that AF-high cells are considerably larger than AF-low cells. This may also reflect their increased metabolic activity.
FIGURE 5 | e-CSCs demonstrate increased cell cycle progression. Note that MCF7 cells with the highest flavin-content, have the highest rates of cell cycle
progression and polyploidy. For example, M-H cells (from 2D-monolayers) and S-H cells (from 3D-spheroids) are hyper-proliferative and show the highest rates of cell
cycle progression, as compared to the M-L and S-L sub-populations. Virtually identical results were also obtained when measuring the polyploidy of the various cell
sub-populations; S-H had the highest numbers of polyploid cells. (A) Quantitation of cell cycle progression is shown as bar graphs, with the mean ± SD.

relative to S-L cells, S-H cells demonstrated a remarkable ∼4-fold
increase in mitochondrial mass.
Therefore, e-CSCs derived from 3D-spheroids were the (i)
most hyper-proliferative and showed the (ii) largest increases
in stemness characteristics (ALDH activity and anchorage-
independent growth), as well as the (iii) highest mitochondrial
mass. These phenotypic changes are highly suggestive of

mitochondrial metabolism.
Bioenergetics
To begin to characterize the bioenergetic phenotype of e-CSCs,
they were subjected to metabolic flux analysis, using the Seahorse
XFe96. We measured the mitochondrial oxygen consumption

Figure 7A shows that M-H cells are highly oxidative, with
a near 2-fold increase in OCR, mitochondrial respiration and
ATP-production. However, the largest changes were in their
glycolytic phenotype, with an ∼4-fold increase in glycolytic
activity (Figure 8A). As such, M-H cells are highly glycolytic, but
with enhanced mitochondrial metabolism.
In contrast, S-H cells demonstrated the highest increases
in OCR, with a near 3-fold increase in basal respiration and
a 4-fold increase in ATP production (Figure 7B). However,
their basal glycolytic rate remained unchanged, suggestive of
a greater dependence on mitochondrial OXPHOS metabolism
(Figure 8B). As a consequence, S-H cells may be more sensitive to
mitochondrial OXPHOS inhibitors, highlighting a possible weak
point in e-CSCs derived from 3D-spheroids.

those associated with FMN/FAD and mitochondrial complex I
and II (8–10). We have previously demonstrated that DPI inhibits
3D-spheroid formation in MCF7 cells (28). We previously
documented that DPI selectively inhibits mitochondrial function
without any toxic side effects; it did not induce changes
in cell viability or apoptosis, but shifted the cells toward a
more glycolytic phenotype (28). Interestingly, Figure 9 reveals
that M-H cells treated with DPI show significant increases
in their propagation (Figures 9A,B) and mitochondrial mass
(Figure 9C). This is consistent with their high basal glycolytic
rate. In contrast, S-H cells were sensitive to DPI; it inhibited
their anchorage-independent growth and propagation in a dose-
dependent fashion (Figure 10).
Therefore,
e-CSCs
are
metabolically-wired
differently,
depending on if they are proliferating in a 2D-monolayer or a
3D-spheroid micro-environment. Most importantly, e-CSCs
derived from 3D-spheroids are highly oxidative and can be
effectively targeted with an OXPHOS inhibitor.
Ribociclib Treatment
Complementary
experiments
were
also
carried
out
with
Ribociclib, a clinically-approved CDK4/6 inhibitor. Ribociclib
is normally used to treat female breast cancer patients, in
combination with letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) (29–
34). Ribociclib was first developed by Astex Pharmaceuticals
(Cambridge, UK) and Novartis (35). In 2017, Ribociclib was
approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency,
for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced
or metastatic breast cancers (36). The drug’s most common
side-effects are: neutropenia, anemia and GI-distress.

proteomics analysis. As a consequence, we identified 225 proteins
that were significantly up-regulated by >1.5-fold. Conversely,
187 proteins were significantly down-regulated.
For
simplicity,
we
focused
on
the
specific
protein
products that were up-regulated and these are highlighted
in Table S1. Interestingly, 48 of these proteins (representing
∼20% of the total number) were specifically related to
mitochondrial
energy
production
and/or
mitochondrial
biogenesis (See Table S2). This is consistent with our functional
observations that e-CSCs demonstrate a near 4-fold increase
in both (i) mitochondrial mass and (ii) mitochondrial ATP
production.
Table S3, shows further bioinformatics analysis, assembling
the proteins into distinct functional groups. These functional
classes include senescence, the anti-oxidant response, “stemness,”
cytoskeletal
proteins
(suggestive
of
an
EMT),
glutamine
metabolism,
NADH/NADPH
synthesis,
flavin-containing
enzymes,
autophagy/lysosomes,
peroxisomes,
and
various
cellular markers (epithelial, cell surface, S100 family proteins,
RABs, annexins, PARP, calcium signaling).
Interestingly, CDKN1A (p21 WAF), which is a CDK-inhibitor
and senescence marker, is highly up-regulated by 17.22-fold in e-
CSCs. This finding is consistent with the idea that CSCs originate
from senescent cells (37–40).
However, e-CSCs are hyper-proliferative, so they must have
successfully escaped from senescence. We speculate that this
may have occurred through the over-expression of anti-oxidant
enzymes or the over-production of NADH/NADPH. Loss of
glutaredoxin expression is known to be sufficient to induce
a senescence phenotype in cells, in a p21-dependent manner.
Therefore, the observed over-expression of glutaredoxin (by
10.79-fold) may be sufficient to actually overcome senescence,
allowing the creation of e-CSCs.
Importantly,
glutaredoxin
expression
is
known
to
drive mitochondrial biogenesis by directly regulating the
activation state of two key mitochondrial proteins, namely
HSP60 and DJ-1 (Park7) (37). HSP60 is a mitochondrial
chaperone, which facilitates the proper folding of newly
synthesized or imported mitochondrial proteins, while DJ-1
functionally maintains the activity of mitochondrial complex
I and SOD2. As a consequence, glutaredoxin expression
specifically
maintains
the
integrity
of
mitochondria
and
elevates ATP synthesis (37). Glutaredoxin’s ability to regulate
mitochondrial energy production is also linked to cell cycle
progression. As such, glutaredoxin allows cells to successfully
pass through the G1/S transition, in a CDK4-dependent
manner, thereby avoiding the cell-cycle arrest associated with
senescence (37).
The 10.24-fold up-regulation of ALDH3A1 also provides
significant anti-oxidant power, as ALDH isoforms are known
to functionally increase the cellular levels of NADH/NADPH
(41–45). Also, the main isoform up-regulated in e-CSCs, namely
ALDH3A1, is known to be associated with tumorigenesis,
metastasis and drug-resistance (41–45).
Interestingly, IPA of our proteomics data sets indeed confirms
the up-regulation the anti-oxidant response and cell cycle
progression in e-CSCs, as well as the changes in mitochondrial
function (Figure 11). Note the activation of PPARGC-1-
Alpha, also known as PGC-1-Alpha, the major mitochondrial
transcription factor.

and p38 MAPK signaling were all activated/up-regulated in e-CSCs.
e-CSC Proteins Are Transcriptionally
Up-Regulated in Human Breast Cancer
Patients
To determine if e-CSCs proteins were also transcriptionally
up-regulated in human breast cancer cells in vivo, we next
interrogated pre-existing mRNA profiling data, obtained from
the laser-capture analysis of N = 28 human breast cancer patient
tumor samples. In this data set, breast cancer cells were physically
separated from adjacent tumor stromal cells, using laser-captured
mediated micro-dissection.
The results of this intersection are presented in Table S4.
Briefly, our results indicate that out of the 225 proteins that were
up-regulated in e-CSCs, nearly one-third of these gene products
were transcriptionally up-regulated in human breast cancer cells
(70/225 = 31.11%). In addition, many of these gene products that
were shared, included 20 mitochondrial related genes (20/70 =
28.57%).
These results provide genetic evidence to support the potential
clinical relevance of e-CSCs in the study of human breast cancers.
A Short Anti-oxidant Response Signature
in e-CSCs Predicts Poor Clinical Outcome
in Breast Cancer Patients
We next determined if a subset of e-CSCs proteins have
prognostic value in terms of predicting clinical outcome in
human breast cancer patients. For this purpose, we used a well-
defined set of high-risk ER(+) patients (luminal A) that received
hormone-therapy (mostly-tamoxifen), with local Lymph-Node
(LN) metastasis at diagnosis, as well as >150 months (12.5 years)
of follow-up data. In all of these cancer patients, their breast
tumor tissues also underwent genomic transcriptional profiling.
Using
Kaplan-Meier
(K-M)
analysis,
we
specifically
determined if these e-CSCs proteins (listed in Table S4)
had prognostic value by determining their effects on the

Hazard-Ratio (HR), by employing the Log-Rank test to
determine statistical significance. Based on this analysis, we
defined a four-gene signature consisting of members of the anti-
oxidant response and NAD(P)H metabolism, namely NQO1,
ALDH5A1, TXNR, and RRM2 (Table S5). Importantly, the other
66 gene products tested did not show this prognostic ability.
First, these four gene products were tested individually and
all showed a >2-fold increase in the HR. In addition, when
combined into a short signature, this resulted in a HR of nearly
4, with a p-value of 4.1e-05. As a consequence, this anti-oxidant
signature could be used to predict tumor recurrence (RFS) in
patients receiving hormonal therapy (Table S5).
Similarly, we also observed that the transcriptional elevation
of 3 out of 4 of these gene products (ALDH5A1, TXNR and
RRM2) was effectively able to predict distant metastasis (DMFS)
(Table S6), with HRs of 2.86–3.64, and p-values of 0.003–0.00035.
Therefore, the anti-oxidant response in e-CSCs has allowed
us to successfully identify gene products with predictive value,
for anticipating the onset of (i) recurrence and (ii) metastasis
in breast cancer patients that ultimately underwent treatment
failure, in response to hormonal therapy.
K-M curves for larger groups of breast cancer patients are
also shown in Figure S4, which all showed significant prognostic
value. These included patients that were ER(+) (N = 2,780) and
ER(–) (N = 791), as well as all breast cancer sub-types, taken
together (N = 3,571). Therefore, this signature should have broad
applicability in breast cancer and possibly other cancer types.
One explanation for the prognostic value of this compact
gene signature is that an adaptive anti-oxidant response drives
resistance to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cancer
patients (46, 47). In addition, TXNR and RRM2 both are key
enzymes that provide the required precursors for nucleotide
biosynthesis and, hence, cell cycle progression.
We speculate that this anti-oxidant response signature would
also be useful for identifying breast cancer patients that could
benefit from treatment with (i) mitochondrial inhibitors or
(ii) CDK inhibitors, especially in the context of preventing
tumor recurrence. Thus, in the future, it will be interesting
to assess ROS production in e-CSCs, under both 2D and 3D
microenvironmental conditions, to validate that ROS production
is driving this anti-oxidant response signature and contributes to
their overall energetic phenotype.
DISCUSSION
Here, we successfully purified a hyper-proliferative cell sub-
population of breast CSCs, by using an endogenous marker of
energy-metabolism, namely, flavin-derived auto-fluorescence. To
better describe this new cell phenotype, we coined the term
“energetic” CSCs (e-CSCs).
More
specifically,
in

a
hyper-proliferative
phenotype, e-CSCs showed progressive increases in stemness
markers (ALDH activity and mammosphere-forming activity),

e-CSCs were highly energetic, with elevations both in glycolysis and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, e-CSCs showed increased cell cycle
progression, with an enhanced capacity for anchorage-independent growth. More specifically, e-CSCs were enriched in the following three functional biomarkers:
AF(+), ALDH(+), and MitoTracker(+). Interestingly, the propagation of e-CSCs (3D) was halted by treatment with (i) OXPHOS inhibitors (DPI) or (ii) inhibitors of cell cycle
progression (Ribociclib). DPI functionally induces a Vitamin B2 deficiency by targeting flavin-containing enzymes; Ribociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor. AF, auto-fluorescent.

a highly elevated mitochondrial mass, as well as increased
glycolytic and mitochondrial activity. This new CSC phenotype
is summarized schematically in Figure 12. Moreover, we directly
demonstrated that the anchorage-independent propagation of e-
CSCs, derived from 3D-spheroids, could be specifically targeted
with an OXPHOS inhibitor (DPI) or a CDK4/6 inhibitor
(Ribociclib) (Figure 13). Therefore, this 3D sub-type of e-CSCs
is strictly dependent on mitochondria, for cell propagation.
Mechanistically, we propose that there are at least 2 different
classes of e-CSCs, that are metabolically distinct and that this
is dependent on whether they are grown in a 2D-monolayer
or a 3D-spheroid micro-environment. We observed that a
metabolic-switch is occurring, apparently during the transition
from anchorage-dependent to anchorage-independent growth.
This represents a metabolic shift from a glycolytic to a more
oxidative mitochondrial phenotype.
More specifically, in 2D-monolayer cultures, 100 nM DPI
increased the number of M-H cells by ∼7.5-fold over a 5-days
period. In contrast, DPI, at exactly the same concentration,
almost
completely
inhibited
3D-mammosphere
formation,
resulting in a population of anchorage-independent single live
cells that were ∼60% depleted of S-H cells. Therefore, the
same mitochondrial OXPHOS inhibitor (DPI) had completely
opposite effects, depending on the 2D vs. 3D micro-environment
of the e-CSCs.
These results experimentally imply that M-H cell propagation
in 2D-monolayers is driven by glycolysis, while the propagation
of S-H cells in 3D-spheroids is driven by mitochondrial
OXPHOS. Importantly, this would suggest that a critical
metabolic-switch is occurring, between the M-H and S-H CSC
phenotypes, specifically altering their metabolic requirements.
This
so
called
2D-to-3D
transition
or
“epithelial-
mesenchymal-transition (EMT)” is thought to be a more
mesenchymal phenotype. In support of this notion, ALDH
activity was progressively increased and was at its highest levels in
e-CSCs derived from the 3D-spheroids, nearly 9-fold increased,
directly supporting our assertions (Figure 14). Importantly,
ALDH activity is an established functional biomarker of the
FIGURE 14 | A metabolic-switch promotes anchorage-independent growth in
e-CSCs. In 2D-monolayer cultures, e-CSCs are particularly dependent on
glycolysis to maintain a high rate of cell proliferation. Experimentally, their rate
of propagation is increased by an OXPHOS inhibitor (DPI). In striking contrast,
in 3D-spheroid cultures, e-CSCs strictly require mitochondrial OXPHOS to
undergo anchorage-independent growth. This would explain our results with
metabolic flux analysis, using the M-H and S-H cell sub-populations, and their
differential sensitivity to DPI-treatment. Therefore, the development and
implementation of anti-mitochondrial therapies may be a viable strategy for
preventing the onset of tumor metastasis, which involves an
anchorage-independent growth phase as a required step.
EMT and “boosts” the production of energy-rich NAD(P)H
(17, 48–50).
The identification of this unique, energy-driven, cancer cell
sub-population will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for
(i) bio-banking and (ii) new drug screening, as well as (iii) the
identification of novel metabolic targets, for the prevention of
tumor recurrence and inhibiting the spread of metastatic disease.
It has long remained a mystery, what is the exact nature
of the cancer cell of origin (51–55). While this still remains a
mystery, we would like to speculate that our current findings,
which are based on functional and operational definitions, will
help to provide an additional practical framework for studying
CSCs, more from a proliferative and energetic perspective.
