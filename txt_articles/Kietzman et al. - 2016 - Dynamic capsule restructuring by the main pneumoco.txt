Dynamic capsule restructuring by the main
pneumococcal autolysin LytA in response to
the epithelium
Colin C. Kietzman1, Geli Gao1, Beth Mann1, Lance Myers1 & Elaine I. Tuomanen1
Bacterial pathogens produce complex carbohydrate capsules to protect against bactericidal
immune molecules. Paradoxically, the pneumococcal capsule sensitizes the bacterium to
antimicrobial peptides found on epithelial surfaces. Here we show that upon interaction with
antimicrobial peptides, encapsulated pneumococci survive by removing capsule from the cell
surface within minutes in a process dependent on the suicidal amidase autolysin LytA. In
contrast to classical bacterial autolysis, during capsule shedding, LytA promotes bacterial
survival and is dispersed circumferentially around the cell. However, both autolysis
and capsule shedding depend on the cell wall hydrolytic activity of LytA. Capsule
shedding drastically increases invasion of epithelial cells and is the main pathway by which
pneumococci reduce surface bound capsule during early acute lung infection of mice. The
previously unrecognized role of LytA in removing capsule to combat antimicrobial peptides
may explain why nearly all clinical isolates of pneumococci conserve this enzyme despite the
lethal selective pressure of antibiotics.

acterial pathogens produce complex carbohydrate capsules
that dominate surface chemistry, inhibit phagocytosis
and
induce
immunological
responses
by
the
host.
The pneumococcus, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, produces over
90 chemically distinct capsule types and the inability to produce
capsule renders the bacterium severely attenuated. As with most
Gram-positive pathogens, the pneumococcal capsule is thought to
be covalently linked to the peptidoglycan of the cell wall in
most strains, though the specific nature of the attachment has
remained elusive1; however, it is clear that in different host
tissues, such as epithelial surfaces, the pneumococcus can rapidly
reduce encapsulation through unknown mechanisms2. Reduced
encapsulation
promotes
intimate
adherence
to
host
cells
and increases the ability to invade epithelial and endothelial
barriers, a prerequisite of systemic disease3. Surprisingly nothing
is known about how the pneumococcus removes capsule from its
surface once it is covalently attached. We hypothesized that
tissue-specific signals in the host direct the pneumococcus to
modulate the amount of surface attached capsule through
activation of a removal pathway.
Immediately upon interaction with colonizing or infecting
organisms,
the
respiratory
epithelium
controls
microbial
populations through several innate defenses. Amongst these,
cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) are one of a relative few
epithelial surface molecules with direct microbicidal activity. In
humans, airway epithelia produce a limited spectrum of CAMPs,
mainly members of the b-defensins and the cathelcidin-derived
LL-37 (refs 4–6). Despite a paucity of studies, data suggests that in
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid LL-37 is the most abundant
CAMP, compared with b-defensins 1 and 2, that are also present
in detectable amounts7. Recent studies have confirmed that
LL-37 plays a role in defense against respiratory pathogens,
including both viral and bacterial infections6,8–10. In the specific
case of the pneumococcus, CAMPs play a crucial role in
bactericidal
control
of
pneumococcal
infections.
Within
high-performance liquid chromatography-separated fractions of
human neutrophils, pneumococcal killing was observed mainly in
fractions containing the CAMPs human neutrophil proteins 1–3
(ref. 11). Further it has been shown that adding purified
pneumococcal capsule can protect unrelated, unencapsulated
bacteria
from
the
bactericidal
effects
of
human
CAMPs
presumably by acting as a scavenger of unbound peptides12.
While purified pneumococcal capsule is thought to act as a
decoy for CAMPs, the production of surface-associated capsule
has been found to adversely affect survival in response to CAMPs.
Genetic inactivation of capsule production in several serotypes
rendered pneumococci more sensitive to killing by CAMPs11.
Capsule therefore has dual roles in the response of pneumococci
to CAMPs, sensitizing those strains that are making capsule to
bactericidal effects, while purified capsule has the ability to
protect unencapsulated strains from unbound antimicrobial
peptide in the environment. Thus we hypothesized that CAMPs
were an important molecule involved in the modulation of
encapsulation of pneumococci. Indeed, we show here that
exposure to CAMPs leads to the accumulation of pneumococcal
capsule in the supernatant of cultures, and that growth in a
CAMP-rich environment can lead to almost complete loss
of surface capsule. This shedding of capsule from the pellet
fraction to the supernatant in response to CAMPs is dependent
upon the pneumococcal autolysin LytA, and occurs during
acute lung infection in both a CAMP- and LytA-dependent
manner. Our results reveal a novel pathway for removal of
surface-associated capsule that is both protective against the
bactericidal effects of CAMPs and provides the first molecular
mechanism for the loss of capsule observed when bacteria contact
epithelial surfaces.
Results
Capsule production and sensitivity to LL-37. To begin to
understand the relationship between capsule and antimicrobial
peptides, we studied the growth of encapsulated and unen-
capsulated pneumococci in the presence of LL-37. We found,
similar to a previous report11, that growth of encapsulated
bacteria was inhibited by LL-37 at 16 and 32 mg ml � 1, whereas a
mutant producing no capsule was not inhibited at these
concentrations (Fig. 1a). This observation raised the question of
whether pneumococci dynamically alter encapsulation to improve
survival when in contact with CAMPs. When we examined the
capsule after pneumococci were treated with LL-37, we found
capsule increased in the supernatant in response to LL-37 in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b). This response was evident in
two commonly utilized strains, TIGR4, which was isolated from a
meningitis case and produces a serotype 4 capsule, and D39,
which is a bacteremia serotype 2 isolate (although the response of
D39 appears to saturate or level off at lower LL37 concentrations
than for TIGR4; Fig. 1b)13. Together, reduced growth by
encapsulated
strains
and
accumulation
of
capsule
in
the
supernatant
after
LL-37
exposure
suggested
that
capsule
shedding was an active response to antimicrobial peptides in
order to reduce the amount of surface-associated capsule.
The
relationship
between
pneumococcal
capsule
and
protection
of
unrelated
unencapsulated
bacterial
from
CAMP-mediated killing suggested that LL-37 may bind primarily
to capsule in encapsulated strains. Using fluorescently labelled
LL-37, the membrane selective dye Mitotracker Green FM,
and anti-capsule antiserum, we observed that LL-37 primarily
co-localized to the bacterial membrane, as has been reported for
the majority of CAMPs (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The localization
of the majority of labelled LL-37 at the membrane was also not
dependent on capsule synthesis as co-localization of membrane
stain and LL-37 was observed in the mutant lacking capsule
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). The lack of co-localization between

 labelled LL-37 and capsule immuno-staining suggests that direct
binding to capsule is either transient, perhaps as a transition
to membrane binding, or, at steady state, occurs at levels
significantly lower than binding to the bacterial membrane.
Encapsulation decreases over time during growth in LL-37. To
determine the rate and degree of shedding at physiological
concentrations of LL-37, that have been measured up to
25 mg ml � 1 in BAL fluid7,14, the amount of cell-associated and
released capsule was measured in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Fig. 2c). At high concentrations of LL-37 (16 mg ml � 1)
after one mass doubling, 60% of capsule in the cell pellet
(cell-associated) was lost compared with capsule in the untreated
pellet, which suggests an active process of removal rather than
simply cessation of capsule synthesis followed by dilution of
remaining capsule to daughter cells. In support of this model, as
cell-associated capsule decreased, there was a marked increase in
the amount of capsule in the supernatant (Fig. 2c). After three
mass
doublings,
wild-type
(WT)
pneumococci
grown
in
16 mg ml � 1 LL-37 lost 95% of the cell-associated capsule
compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2c). Therefore, growth over
time in physiological concentrations of LL-37 can cause the
pneumococcus to become nearly unencapsulated while releasing
at least
a portion of that
capsule
into the surrounding
environment.
The role of LytA in capsule shedding and protection from LL-37.
Since the majority of capsule serotypes are attached to cell wall,
we tested if mutants in predicted carbohydrate-active, cell wall
localized or cell wall-active enzymes-mediated shedding11,15
(Supplementary Table 3). Of the mutants tested, only the major
pneumococcal autolysin, the cell wall amidase LytA, was
necessary for capsule release in response to LL-37 (Fig. 2a);
enzymes linked to other autolytic processes, such as LytC, did not
markedly affect shedding under these conditions. The LytA
autolysin cleaves the amide bond between the peptide stem and
N-acetyl muramic acid residues in peptidoglycan of cell wall.
When activated by antibiotics such as penicillin or vancomycin,
LytA cleaves cell wall to cause cell lysis in a process that, once
triggered, leads irreversibly to death. Unlike LytA-dependent
killing by antibiotics, we observed no lysis or bacterial death
caused by LL-37 addition, even at 16 mg ml � 1, which was several
times higher than was sufficient to cause capsule shedding
(Fig. 2b). Continued viability and even growth in LL-37 suggested
that, unlike antibiotics, the activation of LytA by CAMPs and
subsequent cell wall clipping is not fatal and is most likely actively
controlled, or reversible. In the absence of functional LytA, where
capsule was not shed, pneumococci became up to 2–4-fold more
sensitive to LL-37, and indeed at the highest level tested lost 90%
viability over 3 h (Fig. 2b). This shows for the first time that LytA
is a CAMP resistance factor, and that LytA activation and
subsequent loss of capsule in response to CAMPs is a survival
mechanism for the pneumococcus. In support of this model, after
growth in LL-37 for one or three mass doublings, the LytA
mutant was unable to shed capsule, as indicated by absence of
capsule from the supernatant, and it retained the majority of
cell-associated capsule compared with WT cells grown in
the same conditions (Fig. 2d). Localization of LL-37 to the
bacterial membrane was also observed in the LytA mutant
(Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Complementation of LytA � shedding defect. We sought to
confirm that the amidase activity of LytA underlies capsule
shedding. When expressed from a plasmid, WT LytA was able
to complement a LytA null strain for capsule shedding in the
presence of LL-37 (Fig. 3a). The complemented strain shed higher
amounts of capsule than WT pneumococci probably because of
multi-copy overexpression of LytA (Fig. 3a,b); however, shedding
was still stimulated by the addition of LL-37 suggesting that
endogenously overproduced LytA is still regulated similarly to
LytA produced at normal protein levels. Despite similar levels of
overexpression, a site-directed mutant allele of lytA with altered

 predicted active-site residues, was unable to complement the
shedding defect of the LytA null strain, suggesting that LytA does
not use another enzymatic activity beyond the amidase function
to drive capsule shedding. Supporting a model where it is the
enzymatic activity of LytA that is necessary for capsule shedding
and capsule shedding is the main activity by which LytA acts as a
CAMP resistance factor, resistance to LL-37 was restored by
complementation of WT but not mutant LytA (Fig. 3c).
When
recombinant
full-length
LytA
protein
exogenously
produced in Escherichia coli was added in shedding assays to
the LytA � strain, it was apparent that capsule was shed into the
supernatant regardless of addition of LL-37 (Fig. 3d). Unlike
endogenously produced LytA, this suggests that the normal
regulatory functions evident in shedding assays where LytA is
produced in the cell are unable to control LytA incorporated
from the surrounding milieu. A recombinant LytA with the
choline-binding domains genetically deleted failed to cause either
cell lysis or shedding when added at the same concentrations
as full-length LytA (Supplementary Fig. 2). The unregulated
shedding of LytA added exogenously in the absence of the LL-37
trigger contrasts to LytA driven autolysis, where addition of
purified LytA is insufficient to cause autolysis but requires either
entry into stationary phase or inclusion of autolytic triggers such
as antibiotics or detergents16. Together these findings suggested
that factors other than enzymatic activity distinguished LytA
physiology during autolysis versus shedding.
Capsule shedding by LytA at distinct sites from autolytic LytA.
One physiological function of LytA is to cause autolysis, a
cell density-dependent phenomenon characteristic of major
pathogens,
such
as
pneumococcus,
Haemophilus
and
meningococcus17,18. Importantly, this activity of LytA is triggered
by b-lactam antibiotics and is the main mechanism by which
pneumococci and other autolytic bacteria are killed19,20. Previous
studies have shown LytA involved in autolysis is localized to the
cell wall growth zone; however, secreted LytA is bound to choline
on the cell wall and, thus is, likely distributed around the cell as
teichoic acids migrate away from the septum during growth21. To
test if shedding involved LytA at sites outside the cell wall growth
zone, we utilized a unique facet of pneumococcal biology: the
pneumococcus requires choline for cell wall synthesis and
proteins such as LytA are anchored to cell wall by interaction
with choline. When choline is removed from the growth medium
and ethanolamine is added, the pneumococcus substitutes
ethanolamine into teichoic acids in the geographically restricted
growth zone21. The result of this ethanolamine pulse is newly
synthesized
cell
wall
with
exiguous
choline
and
high
ethanolamine levels only at the septum/cell wall growth zone
(Fig. 4a). Since LytA attaches to cell wall by binding to choline,
these pulses result in a localized band of cell wall depleted of
LytA-binding
sites
(Fig.
4a).
Pneumococci
pulsed
with
ethanolamine showed the expected failure of penicillin to
activate LytA for autolysis, since LytA was reduced at the
growth zone where penicillin-induced triggering occurs (Fig. 4b).
However, capsule shedding occurred regardless of ethanolamine
or choline treatment (Fig. 4c). This indicates that unlike autolysis,
capsule shedding involves activation of LytA that is localized
outside the growth zone. Consistent with this conclusion, when
the autolysis-inducing cell wall antibiotics vancomycin and
penicillin were used at lytic concentrations (Fig. 4e), no capsule
shedding was observed (Fig. 4d). Combined, these results indicate
that capsule shedding and autolysis are separate processes carried
out by geographically distinct populations of LytA. Unlike capsule
shedding, the regulatory functions controlling antibiotic-induced
autolysis affect LytA present at the cell wall growth zone; from
our experiments, activation of LytA through antimicrobial
peptides involves enzyme in areas of cell wall spatially distinct
from autolysis.
Specificity of capsule shedding. The above data illustrate that
pneumococci shed capsule to improve survival when they
encounter LL-37. Humans produce a limited number of CAMPs
with no apparent homology save for overall positive charge22.
However, like LL-37, exposure to the human CAMP b-defensin 3
stimulated
robust
capsule
shedding
at
sub-bactericidal
concentrations (Fig. 5a). Similarly exposure to the bacterially
derived antimicrobial peptides nisin and polymyxin B resulted in
increased capsule in the supernatant (Fig. 5a). Capsule shedding
in response to multiple structurally unrelated CAMPs suggested
that shedding was a response to a shared activity of CAMPs.

 intermediate. Serotype 3 pneumococcal capsule is unique in that
it is synthesized using a phosphatidyl glycerol lipid and therefore
shares
no
intermediate
anchor
molecules
with
cell
wall
synthesis27. However, when exposed to LL-37, a serotype 3
strain also displayed LytA-dependent capsule shedding, similar
to the laboratory strains TIGR4 and D39 tested earlier, and a
non-invasive serotype 6A isolate (Fig. 5b). Thus, it is unlikely that
the signal inducing capsule shedding is sequestration of a
capsular-undecaprenyl phosphate intermediate by antimicrobial
peptides. It remains to be determined how shedding relates to
membrane
poration,
the
main
bactericidal
mechanism
of
CAMPs.
In addition to utilizing an alternate phospholipid for it’s
synthesis, serotype 3 capsule is notable in that it is thought to
be surface-associated in a non-covalent manner1. The finding
that a serotype 3 strain shed capsule suggested that rather
than recognizing a unique capsule/cell wall attachment, capsule
shedding might involve the release of multiple cell wall-associated
molecules. Indeed probing for a teichoic acid-attached protein
and peptidoglycan sorted protein (CbpA and pilus, respectively)
indicated that these molecules increased in the supernatant in a
LytA- and LL-37-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 3).
The presence of proteins attached to alternate sites in the cell
wall in the supernatant after the shedding response suggests
that the LytA response to CAMPs leads to a significant alteration
in the molecules displayed on the pneumococcal surface.
The result of this remodelling is reduced encapsulation and
perhaps a reduction in other pathophysiologically important
surface proteins.
Capsule shedding affects epithelial interactions. It is known that
bacteria are less encapsulated on the mucosa, thereby revealing
surface molecules, such as choline decorated teichoic acids,
involved in bacterial attachment and invasion of the host. When
pneumococci were exposed to LL-37 and then allowed to interact
with a human lung epithelial cell line, we found that invasion was
increased 7–8-fold (Fig. 6c). Thus, capsule shedding significantly
enhanced the interaction of pneumococci with host epithelial cells,
a prerequisite for invasive disease. Once past the mucosal surface,
pneumococci in blood enhance encapsulation to prevent comple-
ment and antibody-mediated killing by phagocytes. CAMPs are
relatively inactive in blood because of sequestration by serum
proteins that prevents their lytic activity on host cells28. Indeed,
inclusion of serum even at low levels (10% v/v) prevented capsule
shedding in our standard assay (Fig. 6d). Perhaps during invasive
disease, when pneumococci circulate in the blood, serum proteins
inactivate residual CAMPs acquired at the epithelium and allows
for the retention of capsule on the bacterial cell surface.
Tissue-specific alteration of encapsulation also occurs during
the process of colony morphotype variation29. Phenotypic
variation between opaque and transparent morphotypes is

pneumococci
from
encapsulated
to
unencapsulated observed at the epithelium is driven by the
capsule shedding response.
Capsule shedding during acute infection. Several studies have
shown
that
pneumococci
alter
encapsulation
or
capsule
production qualitatively in different tissues2,32,33. To test if
LytA-dependent
capsule
shedding
influenced
encapsulation
during infection, we first developed a quantitative method for
measuring encapsulation in complex samples from the host.
Previous microscopic strategies of fluorescent dextran exclusion
and electron microscopy were found to be unsuitable for analysis
of populations of bacteria in complex samples, so we devised a
fluorescence microscopy assay to measure capsule as summarized
in Fig. 6a. Using this technique, microscopic measurement from
in vitro cultures grown in 8 mg ml � 1 LL-37 showed good
agreement of surface bound capsule with capsule blots under
the same conditions (Fig. 6b medium, Fig. 2c left). When WT and
LytA-deficient strains infected WT BALB/c mice in a model of
acute
pneumonia,
WT
pneumococci
lost
60%
of
their
encapsulation at 3 h, while the LytA mutant strain remained
fully encapsulated (Fig. 6b); in Bl/6 mice, 40% of capsule was lost
(Fig. 6b). This shows that at an early time point during acute
infection, the capsule-shedding response driven by LytA is the
main pathway used by pneumococci to reduce encapsulation.
Mice do not produce LL-37, but have an analogous cathelicidin-
derived CAMP named mCRAMP, which is thought to be
functionally similar to LL-37. In mice lacking mCRAMP, it was
apparent that WT pneumococci did not respond during acute
lung infection by losing capsule, retaining 95% encapsulation
(Fig. 6b). Taken together these data indicate that capsule
shedding
in
response
to
cathelicidin-derived
CAMPs
is
responsible
for the majority of capsule
loss observed as
pneumococci move from site to site during acute lung infection.
Discussion
The majority of antibacterial vaccines currently in use rely on
capsular
polysaccharides
as
a
main
immunogen
(that
is,
pneumococcus,
meningococcus
and
Haemophilus)34,35.
The
finding that one of the major roles of LytA is to drive capsule
shedding has profound implications for current treatments and
vaccine strategies. Shedding removes the major imunogen from
the bacterial surface and as such may help pathogens evade anti-
capsular immune responses. In fact, the efficacy of pneumococcal
vaccines
in
preventing
hospitalization
correlates
with
the
encapsulation
of
bacteria
recovered
from
those
tissues;
pneumonia and otitis, diseases of the epithelium, where the
pneumococcus is less encapsulated, are prevented significantly
less well by capsular vaccines compared with bacteremia and
meningitis36. In terms of bacterial physiology, the use of
controlled cell wall clipping to remove capsule means that
chemically diverse capsule serotypes can be swapped into a strain
without the need for co-evolution of serotype-specific removal
strategies. In the case of the pneumococcus, within a few years of
introduction of capsule-specific vaccines, the serotypes included
in the vaccine formulations have been replaced in the population
by non-vaccine capsule types. Recently it has become clear

Briefly, the diameter of the bacterial membrane (stained with Nile Red) is
subtracted from the diameter of the capsule (green). The resulting distance
(green arrows) is directly proportional to the amount of surface bound capsule.

 through genomic analysis that rather than new virulent strains
appearing to take the place of vaccine type strains, some virulent
subtypes have specifically exchanged the capsule biosynthesis
locus. These capsule switch mutants retain important virulence
determinants and differ largely from their parent strains in
capsule chemistry37. Therefore, the onus of diversifying the
capsule locus to evade vaccines is alleviated partially by the ability
of
LytA
to
remove
any
capsule
type
acquired
through
recombination.
The caveat
is
that
this
universal
removal
strategy is also a Trojan horse that maintains the same protein
used by cell wall-active antibiotics to kill the bacteria.
The survival advantage of capsule removal provides an attractive
model to explain why the potentially suicidal LytA is maintained in
the genome of virulent isolates of pneumococci. The use of
constant penicillin prophylaxis in high-risk populations would be
expected to place the spatially restricted regulatory strategies
controlling autolytic LytA activity under evolutionary pressure. In
classical studies, antibiotic exposure has been found to result either
in resistance, where the drug fails to bind to cell wall synthesis
targets, or in tolerance, where the control of triggering of LytA is
altered; in neither case is lytA ever lost38. When we tested a highly
penicillin tolerant strain of pneumococci that harbours LytA but
does not activate it in response to penicillin, we observed
conservation
of
capsule
shedding
(Supplementary
Fig.
3).
Together
this
suggests
that
in
response
to
antibiotics,
pneumococcal evolution will result mainly in mutations altering
LytA activation and control at the growth zone rather than
complete loss of LytA function. It appears that loss of LytA leading
to increased CAMP sensitivity and loss of capsule shedding is not
well tolerated in pneumococci colonizing immune competent hosts.
Autolysis is a curious suicidal characteristic of major bacterial
pathogens of children. LytA null mutants are perfectly viable and
are even able to colonize the nasopharynx in some models39. The
lytic degradation of cell wall has several impacts on the
pneumococcal life cycle including release of inflammatory cell
wall components altering the immune response and release of
extracellular DNA, which is thought to be important in competence
and biofilm formation40–43. However, in these processes the end
result for LytA activation is still bacterial death; thus, the advantage
of maintaining this high-risk property has been a long-standing
conundrum in bacteriology. Even intense selective pressure by
antibiotics has driven the emergence of downregulation of LytA
activation, that is, tolerance, rather than elimination of the
enzyme44. In fact, most penicillin-resistant isolates are tolerant
but preserve lytA (refs 45–47). The majority of autolysin on a
pneumococcal surface does not participate in lysis by antibiotics or
induction of stationary phase lysis by quorum sensing as LytA is
produced throughout growth, but activated only under certain
circumstances48. Our work has identified a new physiological
function for the majority of pneumococcal surface autolysin. LytA
drives rapid capsule shedding in response to encountering CAMPs
in the initial phases of infection of the host. This response increases
bacterial resistance to these microbicidal innate defense molecules
and increases the invasiveness of bacteria at the epithelium. This
supports the hypothesis that pneumococci have a pre-programmed
machinery to rapidly modulate the amount of surface capsule in
response to host-defense signals, such that bearing less capsule
while on the CAMP-rich mucosal surface promotes bacterial
survival together with attachment and invasion, while replenishing
of capsule in the blood protects bacteria from phagocytosis.
Methods
Media and growth conditions. S. pneumoniae strains (Supplementary Table 1)
were routinely grown on tryptic soy agar (EMD Chemicals, NJ) supplemented with
3% sterile sheep blood or in liquid culture in semisynthetic casein liquid medium
supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (C þ Y) (ref. 49) at 37 �C in 5% CO2
unless otherwise noted. Erythromycin was added at 1 mg ml � 1 and kanamycin
at 300 mg ml � 1 for appropriate cultures. The antimicrobial peptides LL-37
(synthesized by St Jude Children’s Research Hospital Hartwell Center), LL-37
5-TAMRA (Innovagen, cat SP-5259-1), Polymyxin B (Sigma, cat 92283), Nisin
(Sigma, cat N5764) or b-defensin 3 (Anaspec, cat AS-60741) were resuspended in
cell culture-grade water (Sigma) before use. Cell culture experiments utilized F12K
medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ATCC).
Optical density for growth curves was measured at l 620 nm in 96 well plate format
on a SpectraMax 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) and in culture tube
format on a Turner Model 340 Spectrophotometer.
Construction of mutant strains and plasmids. Mutants of S. pneumoniae were
constructed using PCR-based overlap extension50, which created a deletion allele
marked with ermB, using primers listed in Supplementary Table 2. Final PCR
constructs were purified after agarose gel electrophoresis using QIAquick Gel
Extraction kit (Qiagen cat # 28706) and transformed into the pneumococcus using
competence stimulating peptide 1 (for D39 and derivatives), competence
stimulating peptide 2 (for TIGR4 and derivatives) or a mixture of both for other
strains. To confirm allelic replacement of target genes genomic DNA from
recovered mutants was screened by PCR. Mutants of lytA in the serotype 3 strain
A66.1 and the serotype 6A strain 6A4 were generated through transformation of
the PCR amplified DlytA::ermB mutant allele from CKB410. To construct pLytA
and its derivatives the lytA gene was amplified from TIGR4 genomic DNA using
primers CK613 and CK614, then digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into
the XhoI/BamHI sites of the streptococcal shuttle vector pABG5 (ref. 51) (gift from
Michael Caparon, Washington University in St Louis) yielding pCK540. Purified
pCK540 was then used as the template for PCR with the 50phosphorylated primers
CK639 and CK640 and the resulting PCR product was self-ligated yielding pLytA
(pABG5:lytA-6xHIS, pCK584). To mutate active-site residues, pLytA was used as a
template for PCR with the 50 phosphorylated primers CK648 and CK649 and the
resulting PCR product was self-ligated yielding pLytA � (pABG5:lytA-
6xHIS[H147A, D149A], pCK624). The fidelity of each plasmid construct was
confirmed by sequencing of the insert portion of the resulting vector.
Purification of LytA. Full-length recombinant LytA was purified from E. coli using
constructs and methods found in ref. 52. A version of LytA with the predicted
choline-binding domains deleted was was amplified from TIGR4 genomic DNA
using primers LytANde and LytABam. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and
BamHI and ligated into prepared pET28a vector. Clones were sequenced and
transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells (Novagen cat# 69450). Overnight
cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 3 h at 37�C. Recombinant protein was
purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and dialysed overnight at 4 �C in PBS.
Western blotting. Unless otherwise specified, logarithmic cultures of pneumococcal
strains grown in C þ Y with appropriate antibiotics were harvested at OD 0.4,
pelleted by centrifugation, washed with PBS, pelleted then resuspended in dPBS with
1 � complete mini protease inhibitor (Roche). The cells were then lysed by two
rounds of mechanical disruption using 0.2 mm silica beads in a Fast Prep machine
(MP Biomedicals) using the following settings: time: 40s speed: 6.5 m s � 1. Samples
were then boiled for 5 min, and insoluble material cleared by centrifugation. Total
protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce-Thermo) and equal
amounts of protein per sample were electrophoresed on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris
gels using manufacturers recommended conditions (Life Technologies). After
transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane blots were probed with LytA poly-
clonal antiserum (1:5,000 dilution)53, pilus polyclonal antiserum (1:5,000 dilution)54
or CbpA polyclonal antiserum (1:5,000 dilution)55 and horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (Bio-Rad cat# 170–6515). Blots
were imaged using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad).
Capsule-shedding assay and capsule blotting. An amount of 1 ml of logarithmic
culture of pneumococci grown in C þ Y or indicated medium was harvested at OD
0.4 by centrifugation. The pellet was then washed with 1 ml buffer SMM
(0.5 M Sucrose, 0.02 M MgCl2, 0.02 M 2-(N-Morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid
(MES) pH 6.5) and resuspended in 1 ml SMM. Either LL-37 (at 4 mg ml � 1 for
standard assays, or the indicated concentration) or antibiotics at the indicated
concentration were then added and the samples were incubated at 37 �C for 30 min
(or indicated time). Samples were then centrifuged 5 min at 414,000g, and the
supernatant removed and kept for analysis (supernatant fraction). The cell pellet
was then resuspended in 975 ml PBS to which 25 ml of 10% (w/v) deoxycholate was
added (for LytA-deficient strains 5 mg of purified LytA was added to allow for bile
salt stimulated lysis) and the cells were allowed to lyse for 30 min at 37 �C (Pellet
fraction). To remove significant proteinaceous cross-reactive species detected by
anti-capsule antisera, before analysis both supernatant and pellet fractions were
treated with 5 ml proteinase K (Sigma, cat# P4850) for 30 min at 37 �C. To properly
visualize the capsule, we adapted an alternate electrophoresis and transfer method.
Past methods of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) resulted in o5% of
capsule entering the resolving portion of the gel, and the low molecular weight
species from bacterial samples that entered PAGE gels were not apparent in
commercially available purified capsular polysaccharides (ATCC, serotype 4 cat

 173-X, serotype 3 cat 169-X, serotype 2 cat 165-X, serotype 6A cat 271-X and
serotype 19F cat 99-X ). Therefore, capsule-containing samples were boiled in
SDS–PAGE sample buffer and 5 ml was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel in
standard 1 � Tris-Acetate running buffer and 3 ml of a 20 mg ml � 1 solution of
purified capsular polysaccharides was included as a standard in all gels. The
majority of bacterial capsule and purified capsule were resolved by this method.
After electrophoresis samples were transferred from the agarose gel to mixed
nitrocellulose ester membranes (HATF, Millipore) via 20 � SSC capillary transfer
overnight. After transfer membranes were rinsed in 6 � SSC, allowed to air dry
and UV crosslinked at 150,000 mJ using a Stratagene UV crosslinker. The
membrane was then blocked with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat
milk for 1 h at room temperature and probed with commercially available
serotype-specific anti-capsular antiserum (Statens Serum Institute, serotype 4 cat
16747, serotype 2 16,745, serotype 3 16,746, serotype 6A cat 16,900 and serotype
19F cat 16,911) at a 1:15,000 dilution. After washing the membrane was then
visualized using secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies
(Bio-Rad cat 170–6515) (1:30,000) and imaged on a ChemiDoc MP imager
(Bio-Rad). For quantitation of relative capsule amounts blot images were analysed
by densitometry using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).
Ethanolamine pulse. Logarithmic cultures of pneumococci growing in C þ Y were
harvested at OD 0.4 by centrifugation and washed three times with C þ Y devoid of
choline then resuspended at OD 0.2 in choline-free C þ Y. Either choline (4mg ml� 1
final concentration) or ethanolamine (20 mg ml � 1 final concentration) was then
added to the appropriate cultures and after one mass doubling (measured by optical
density) the cultures were either harvested for capsule shedding or used directly for
measuring growth after addition of penicillin at the indicated concentration.
Adhesion and invasion. The respiratory epithelial cell line A549 (ATCC cat#
CCL-185) was routinely cultured in F12K medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
For adhesion and invasion assays pneumococci were harvested from logarithmic
culture at OD 0.4 and resuspended in cell culture medium. A total of 1 � 107
pneumococci were added to each well of 12-well tissue culture plates containing
A549 cells that had been treated with tumour necrosis factor a (10 ng ml � 1) for 2 h
before the assay56. For adherence assays, pneumococci were incubated for 1 h with
cells after which wells were washed three times with sterile PBS and cells released
from the plate by trypsinization. Samples and dilutions were grown overnight on
TSA blood agar plates and the resulting colony forming units (CFUs) were counted
as bacteria adherent to cells. For invasion assays pneumococci were incubated with
A549 cells for 2 h, after which wells were washed three times with sterile PBS and
penicillin (10 mg ml � 1) and gentamicin (200 mg ml � 1) were added to the wells for
1 h to kill bacteria that remained extracellular. Wells were again washed three times
with sterile PBS and cells were released from the plate with trypsin and lysed with
cold 0.025% TritonX-100 before samples were removed and plated on blood agar
plates. Resulting CFUs were counted as bacteria that had invaded A549 cells.
Acute lung infection and animal experiments.. Six-week-old female mice from
Jackson labs (Balb/c, Bl/6 or mCRAMP � / � with stock numbers 000651, 000664
and 017799, respectively) were inoculated with 1 � 107 CFUs of exponentially
harvested pneumococci intratracheally via feeding needle essentially as described57.
After 3 h mice were killed, and lungs were lavaged with 2 ml sterile PBS. Each
experimental group consisted of three mice and all experiments were carried out
with three independent replicates. All experiments were done under inhaled
isoflurane anaesthesia and followed protocols approved by St Jude Children’s
Hospital IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee).
Fluorescent microscopy. To measure encapsulation, either bacteria from in vitro
growth or BAL fluid were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold
PBS/paraformaldehyde (4%) (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat 15710) and
allowed to fix on ice for 1 h. After fixation samples were centrifuged and washed
with ice-cold PBS then resuspended in room temperature PBS and incubated with
anti-capsular antibody (1:100) for 30 min. Samples were then washed twice with
sterile PBS, resuspended in PBS and stained with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor
488F(ab’)2 fragment (Life Technologies, cat A-11070) (1:200) for 30 min at room
temperature in the dark. After 30 min Nile Red stain (Life Technologies, cat
N-1142) (0.1 mg ml � 1 in DMSO) was added at 1:100 (v/v) and allowed to stain for
an additional 5 min at room temperature. Samples were then collected by cen-
trifugation, washed twice and resuspended in sterile PBS. For labelled LL-37 and
Mitrotracker Green FM staining, 1 ml of culture grown as for capsule-shedding
assay were incubated with 4 mg ml � 1 LL-37-TAMRA and 200 nM Mitotracker
Green FM (Life Technologies, cat M7514) for 15 min at room temperature.
Samples were then collected by centrifugation, washed with 1 ml buffer SMM and
resuspended in sterile PBS. Samples were mounted for imaging in 1% (w/v, final
concentration) low melting temperature agarose, imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE300
microscope equipped with Sola Light Engine (Lumincor) and Retiga 2000R camera
(Qimaging), using appropriate fluorescent filters and NIS-elements (Nikon)
software. After image acquisition fluorescent channels were over-layered and
fluorescent intensity across a section was measured using ImageJ software. The
distance (in pixels) measured for Nile red stain (membrane) was subtracted from
the distance measured for Alexa Fluor 488 (capsule). For bacteria from in vitro
cultures a minimum of 100 bacteria per condition per replicate were measured, and
for BAL samples a minimum of 50 bacteria per mouse were measured.
Statistics. Differences in the mean between experimental groups were tested for
significance using unpaired t-test and Prism 6.0 (GraphPad) software and the null
hypothesis was rejected when Po0.05.
