extracts inhibit cell growth and induce
apoptosis in cervical cancer cells
Sindiswa T. Lukhele and Lesetja R. Motadi*
Abstract
Background: Cervical cancer remains a global health related issue among females of Sub-Saharan Africa, with over
half a million new cases reported each year. Different therapeutic regimens have been suggested in various regions
of Africa, however, over a quarter of a million women die of cervical cancer, annually. This makes it the most lethal
cancer amongst black women and calls for urgent therapeutic strategies. In this study we compare the anti-proliferative
effects of crude extract of Cannabis sativa and its main compound cannabidiol on different cervical cancer cell lines.
Methods: To achieve our aim, phytochemical screening, MTT assay, cell growth analysis, flow cytometry,
morphology analysis, Western blot, caspase 3/7 assay, and ATP measurement assay were conducted.
Results: Results obtained indicate that both cannabidiol and Cannabis sativa extracts were able to halt cell
proliferation in all cell lines at varying concentrations. They further revealed that apoptosis was induced by cannabidiol
as shown by increased subG0/G1 and apoptosis through annexin V. Apoptosis was confirmed by overexpression of
p53, caspase 3 and bax. Apoptosis induction was further confirmed by morphological changes, an increase in Caspase
3/7 and a decrease in the ATP levels.
Conclusions: In conclusion, these data suggest that cannabidiol rather than Cannabis sativa crude extracts prevent cell
growth and induce cell death in cervical cancer cell lines.

Background
Cannabis sativa is a dioecious plant that belongs to the
Cannabaceae family and it originates from Central and
Eastern Asia [11, 28]. It is widely distributed in countries
including Morocco, South Africa, United States of
America, Brazil, India, and parts of Europe [14, 28].
Cannabis sativa grows annually in tropical and warm
regions around the world [11]. Different ethnic groups
around the world use Cannabis sativa for smoking,
preparing concoctions to treat diseases, and for various
cultural purposes [17]. According to [28], it is composed
of
chemical
constituents
including
cannabinoids,
nitrogenous compounds, flavonoid glycosides, steroids,
terpenes,
hydrocarbons,
non-cannabinoid
phenols,
vitamins, amino acids, proteins, sugars and other related
compounds. Cannabinoids are a family of naturally occur-
ring compounds highly abundant in Cannabis sativa plant
[1, 6, 14, 24]. Screening of Cannabis sativa has led to
isolation of at least 66 types of cannabinoid compounds
[1, 14, 30]. These compounds are almost structurally simi-
lar or possess identical pharmacological activities and offer
various potential applications including the ability to
inhibit cell growth, proliferation and inflammation [22].
One such compound is cannabidiol (CBD), which is
among the top three most widely studied compounds,

 following delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) [14].
It has been found to be effective against a variety of
disorders
including
neurodegerative
disorders,
auto-
immune diseases, and cancer [24, 25]. In a research study
conducted by [26], it was found that CBD inhibited cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis in a series of human
breast cancer cell lines including MCF-10A, MDA-MB-
231, MCF-7, SK-BR- 3, and ZR-7-1 and further studies
found it to possess similar characteristics in PC-3 prostate
cancer cell line [25]. However, to allow us to further our
studies in clinical trials a range of cancers in vitro should
be tested to give us a clear mechanism before we can
proceed. Cannabis sativa in particular cannabidiol, we
propose it plays important role in helping the body fight
cancer through inhibition of pain and cell growth. There-
fore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic
and anti-proliferative properties of Cannabis sativa and
its isolate, cannabidiol in cervical cancer cell lines.
Methods
Materials
An aggressive HeLa, a metastatic ME-180 and a primary
SiHa cell lines were purchased from ATCC (USA, MD).
Camptothecin was supplied by Calbiochem® and canna-
bidiol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as a
standard reference.
Plant collection and preparation of extracts
Fresh leaves, stem and roots of Cannabis sativa were
collected from Nhlazatshe 2, in Mpumalanga province.
Air dried C. sativa plant material was powdered and
soaked for 3 days in n-hexane, ethanol and n-butanol,
separately. Extracts were filtered using Whatman filter
paper and dried. Dimethyl sulfoxide was added to dried
extracts to give a final concentration of a 100 mg/ml.
Different concentrations (50, 100, and 150 μg/ml) of C.
sativa extracts were prepared from the stock and used
in treating cells during MTT assay. HPLC-Mass spectro-
photometry was performed to verify the presence of
cannabidiol in our extracts. The plant was identified by
forensic specialist in a forensic laboratory in Pretoria.
The laboratory number 201213/2009 and the voucher
number is CAS239/02/2009.
Cell culture
HeLa, ME-180 and SiHa were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with
10 % Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Highveld biological,)
and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma, USA). Cells
were maintained at 37 °C under 5 % of carbon dioxide
(CO2) and 95 % relative humidity. After every third day
of the week, old media was removed and replaced with
fresh media, to promote growth until the cells reach a
confluence of ~70–80 %.
Methods
MTT assay
Ninety microlitres of HeLa and SiHa cells were seeded
into 96-well plates at 5×103 cells per well and incubated
overnight at 37 °C under 5 % CO2 and 95 % relative hu-
midity to promote cell attachment at the bottom of the
plate. Media was changed and the cells were treated with
Cannabis sativa plant extracts at various concentrations
(0, 50, 100, and 150 μg/ml (w/v)) for 24 h. After 24 h, the
cells were treated with 10 μl of (5 mg/ml) MTT reagent
(3-[4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) for 4 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO2. Ninety
microlitres of DMSO was added into each well in-
cluding wells containing media only and serves as a
blank, to dissolve formazan crystals. Camptothecin
and DMSO were included as controls. Optical density
was measured using a micro plate reader (Bio-Rad) at
570 nm to determine the percentage of viable cells
and account for cell death induced according to the
outlined equation below:
% Cell viability
¼
Absorbance of treated cells−Absorbance of blank
Absorbance of untreated cells−Absorbance of blank � 100
Cell growth analysis
Before seeding cells, a 100 μl of media was added to the
16 well E-plate and placed in the incubator to record
background readings. A blank with media only was in-
cluded to rule the possibility of media having a negative
effect on the cells. In each well of the E-plate, 1×104
cells were seeded and left in the incubator for 30 min to
allow the cells to adhere to the bottom of the plate. The
E-plate was placed and locked in the RTCA machine
and experiment allowed to run for 22 h prior to the
addition of the test compounds. Cells were treated with
various concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150 μg/ml) of C.
sativa hexane extract. Following treatment, the experi-
ment was allowed to run for a further 22 h. Camptothe-
cin (0.3 μM (v/v)) and DMSO (0.1 % (v/v)) were used as
controls
for
comparative
purposes.
Procedure
was
repeated for C. sativa butanol extract.
Apoptosis assay
Cells were washed twice with 100 μl of cold Biolegend’s
cell staining buffer followed by resuspension in 100 μl of
Annexin V binding buffer. A 100 μl of cell suspension
was transferred into 15 ml falcon tube and 5 μl of FITC
Annexin V and 10 μl of Propidium iodide solution (PI)
were added into untreated and treated cell suspension.
The cells were gently vortexed and incubated at room
temperature (25 °C) in the dark for 15 min. After

 15 min, 400 μl of Annexin V binding buffer was added
to the cells. The stained cells were analysed using FACS-
Calibur (BD Biosciences, USA).
Morphological analysis
Five hundred microliter of 1×104 cells was added onto
a 6-well plate containing coverslips. The plate was incu-
bated overnight to allow the cells to attach. Following
attachment, media was removed and cells were washed
twice with PBS, prior to incubation with IC50 of
Cannabis sativa extracts for 24 h. After 24 h, media was
removed and cells were washed twice with PBS. Four
percent (4 %) was added into each well and the plate
incubated for 20 min at room temperature, to allow
efficient fixation of cells. Cells were washed twice with
PBS and once with 0.1 % BSA wash buffer and further
stained with DAPI and Annexin V/FITC for 5 min.
BX-63 Olympus microscope (Germany) was used to
visualize the cells.
Mitochondrial assay (ATP detection)
Twenty five microlitres of 1×104 cells per well were
plated in a white 96-well luminometer plate overnight.
Cells were treated with 25 μl of IC50 concentrations of
Cannabis sativa crude extracts and cannabidiol dissolved
in a glucose free media supplemented with 10 mM
galactose. The plate was incubated at 37° in a humidified
and CO2-supplemented incubator for a period of 24 h.
Fifty microlitres of ATP detection reagent was added to
each well and the plate further incubated for 30 min.
Luminescence was measured using GLOMAX (Promega,
USA). The assay was conducted in duplicates and ATP
levels were reported as a mean of Relative Light Units
(RLU). The following formula was used to calculate the
ATP levels in RLU:

Caspase 3/7 activity
A hundred microliters of 1×104 cells were plated
overnight on a 96-well luminometer plate and allowed
to attach overnight. The next day, cells were treated
with 0.3 μM camptothecin and the IC50 concentra-
tions of Cannabis sativa crude extracts and further
incubated for a period of 24 h. Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay
was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol
(Promega, USA). Briefly, following treatment, media
was replaced with caspase glo 3/7 reagent mixed with
a substrate at a ratio of 1:1 v/v of DMEM: Caspase-
glo 3/7 reagent and was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were harvested with 2 ml of 0.05 % trypsin-EDTA.
Ten millilitres of media was added to the cells to inacti-
vate trypsin and the cell suspension was centrifuged at
1500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded
and pellet was re-suspended twice in 1 ml PBS. Cell
suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2–5 min
and PBS was discarded. Seven hundred microlitres of
pre-chilled absolute ethanol was added to the cell
suspension followed by storage at −20 °C for 30 min, to
allow efficient permeabilization and fixing of the cells.
After 30 min, cells were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for
5 min to remove ethanol. The pellet was washed twice
with PBS and centrifuged at 5000 rpm to remove PBS.
Five hundred microlitres of FxCycle™ PI/RNase Staining
solution (Life technologies, USA) was added to the cells
and vortexed for 30 s (sec). The cells were analysed with
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, USA).
Western blot
Following 24 h of treatment with IC50 concentrations,
cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % NP-40, 0.1 % SDS, 2 mM
EDTA). Protein content was measured by the BCA
assay and equal amounts were electrophoresed in
SDS polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto
nitrocellulose
membranes.
Membranes
were
subse-
quently immunoblotted with Anti-mouse monoclonal
p53, Bcl-2, Bax, RBBP6, Caspase-3 and -9 antibodies
were used at 1:500–1000 dilutions as primary anti-
bodies, while a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidise-
conjugated horse IgG (Santa Cruz, USA) were used at a
1:2000 dilution as a secondary antibody. The membranes
were developed using Chemiluminescence detection kit
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). The membranes were
imaged using a Biorad ChemiDoc MP.
Data analysis
Experiments were performed in duplicates. Statistical
analysis of the graphical data was expressed as the
mean standard deviation. The p-value was analysed in
comparison to the untreated using Students t-Test
wherein p < 0.05 was considered as significant.

 Results
Effect of Cannabis sativa and cannabidiol on SiHa, HeLa,
and ME-180 cells
To determine half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) for both Cannabis sativa and cannabidiol, MTT
assay was used. Camptothecin, as our positive control,
significantly reduced cell viability in SiHa (40.36 %),
HeLa (47.19 %), and ME-180 cells (32.25 %), respect-
ively. As shown in Fig. 1a and d, the IC50 was cell type
dependent rather than time dependent with SiHa at less
than 50 μg/ml in both butanol (56 %) and hexane (48.9 %).
Similarly IC50 in HeLa was at 100 μg/ml at p < 0.001
(Fig. 1b). while ME-180 cells treated with butanolic extract
exhibited an IC50 of a 100 μg/ml, reducing viability to
48.6 % (Fig. 1c) and hexane extracts IC50 was at 50 μg/ml
with 54 % death (Fig. 1f). This was not the case in cannabi-
diol with SiHa (51 %) and HeLa (50) IC50 at a much lower
dose (3.2 μg\ml) while ME-180 cells (56 %) at 1.5 μg\ml
when compared to Cannabis sativa extracts (p < 0.001)
(Fig. 1g–i). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was included as a
vehicle control and it inhibited between 4 and 11 %.
Whereas ethanol exhibited between 7.3 and 7.8 % since
cannabidiol was alcohol extracted.
Effect of Cannabis sativa extracts and cannabidiol on
cell growth of cervical cancer cells
The IC50 obtained during MTT assay was tested for their
ability to alter cell viability in real time. An impedance
based system was employed to evaluate the effect of Can-
nabis sativa and cannabidiol on SiHa, HeLa, and ME-180.
Cells were seeded in an E-plate and allowed to attach. Cells
were further treated with IC50 for a period of 22–24 h, de-
pending on their doubling time. Continuous changes in
the impedance were measured and displayed as cell index
(CI). Little can be read from xCELLigence except that can-
nabidiol in all cell lines has shown to reduce cell index
while the plant extract had mixed results sometimes show-
ing reduction on the other hand remained unchanged
(Fig. 3). Suggesting that cannabidiol is the most effective
compound.
Cannabis sativa extracts and cannabidiol induce
apoptosis in cervical cancer cells
Flow cytometry revealed a significant increase in SiHa
cells
undergoing
apoptosis
during
treatment
with
butanol (from 2 to 28.5 %) and hexane (from 2 to
17.2 %) as compared to camptothecin with 30.4 %. In

SiHa, HeLa, and ME-180 cells with different doses of butanol extract (a, b, c), hexane extract (d, e, f), and cannabidiol extract (g, h, i) for a period of
24 h. Data was expressed as mean value ± standard deviation (SD). The level of significance was determined using Students t-Test with nsrepresenting

 HeLa cells, apoptosis was increased to 31.9 % in
butanol extract and only 15.3 % in hexane cells
(Fig. 3b). A similar events was observed following
treatment of ME-180 cells with butanol extract were
44.8 % apoptosis was recorded and 43.2 % in hexane
treated cells (Fig. 3c). Cannabidiol was also tested for
its ability to induce apoptosis in all three cell lines.
The results further confirmed that the type of cell
death induced was apoptosis. Figure shows that can-
nabidiol induced early apoptosis in all three cell lines.
Cannabidiol was more effective in inducing apoptosis
In comparison to both extracts of Cannabis sativa. In
SiHa
cells
cannabidiol
induced
51.3
%
apoptosis
(Fig. 3d), 43.3 % in HeLa and 28.6 % in ME-180 cell
lines (Fig. 3f).
Effect of Cannabis sativa extracts and cannabidiol on the
morphology of SiHa and HeLa cells
To characterise the cell death type following treat-
ment with our test compounds, cell were stained
with DAPI and Annixin V to show if apoptosis was
taking place. Treatment of SiHa and HeLa cells with
IC50 of both butanol and hexane extracts confirmed
the type of cell death as apoptosis since they picked a
green colour from Annexin V that bind on phosphotidyl
molecules that appear in early stages of apoptosis. Similar
results were also observed in cannabidiol treated cells.
Another feature that is a representative of cell death is the
change in morphology. Morphological appearance of
live cells displayed a round blue nuclei following
staining with DAPI. Exposure of SiHa and HeLa cells
to IC50 of Cannabis sativa extracts caused a change in
morphology coupled with an uptake of annexin V. Loss
of shape, nuclear fragmentation, reduction in cell size
and blebbing of the cell membrane were among the
observed
morphological
features
implicated
to
be
associated with apoptosis (Fig. 6).
Effect of Cannabis sativa extracts and cannabidiol on the
ATP levels
Since Adenosine 5’-triphosphate acts as a biomarker for
cell proliferation and cell death, an ATP assay was
conducted. This was done in order to determine whether
Cannabis sativa and cannabidiol deplete ATP levels in
Fig. 2 xCELLigence analysis of the cell growth pattern after treatment of cervical cancer cells with Cannabis sativa extracts and cannabidiol. SiHa
(a, d, g), HeLa (b, e, h), and ME-180 (c, f, i) cells were seeded for a period of 22–24 h, followed by treatment with IC50 concentration of butanol
(a, b, c), hexane (d, e, f), and cannabidiol (g, h, i)

 cervical cancer cells. SiHa, HeLa, and ME-180 cells were
treated at different time points, between 2 and 24 h.
ATP levels were first detected after 2 h. In general, ATP
depletion was cell type dependent. In HeLa cells treated
with the crude extracts from butanol and hexane, ATP
was significantly reduced by 74 % (from 627621 to
164208 RLU) and 78 % (from 627621 to 133693 RLU)
respectively. While with SiHa there was reduction of 31 %
(from 4719589 to 3221245 RLU) and 22.5 % (4719589 to
3655730 RLU) respectively (figure). Whereas in ME-180
there was no change between treatments and untreated.
Similar results were observed in cannabidiol treated cells.
At 2 h, treatment with IC50 led to a reduction in ATP
levels by ~ 61 % (from 4704419 to 1802508 RLU), 93 %
(from 627621 to 40371 RLU), and 8 % (from 798688 to
734039 RLU) in SiHa, HeLa, and ME-180 cells respect-
ively (Figure). A prolonged incubation period (24 h) of
cells with IC50 led to a further decrease in the ATP levels
by ~66 % (from 4486150 to 1497648 RLU), 97 % (from
601694 to 13426 RLU), and 8.5 % (from 790757 to 723039
RLU) in SiHa, HeLa, and ME-180 cells respectively. This
could mean that cannabidiol depletes ATP levels more
than Cannabis sativa extracts and might be the main
compound responsible for cell death in cancer cells
treated with Cannabis sativa.
Effect of Cannabis sativa and cannabidiol on caspase 3/7
activity of SiHa, HeLa, and ME-180 cells
As shown in Fig. 8a, b and c, we observed an increase in
caspase 3/7 activity all three cell lines following treat-
ment with 0.3 μM of camptothecin. Similar results were
observed in crude extract treated cells by 25 % (SiHa)
and 40 % (HeLa) in butanol extract and 50 % (SiHa) and
100 % (HeLa) in hexane treated. There was no signifi-
cant change in ME-180 cells (Figure). When cells were
treated with cannabidiol, caspase 3/7 activity increased
in all three cell lines. SiHa cells so an increase from
200000 RLU to 2500000 while HeLa increased to

deviation with ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01 and nsp > 0.05 representing the level of significance in comparison to the untreated

 900000 from 800000 RLU. ME-180 was fairly increased
also to 230000 from 200000 RLU all increase were
significant and in line with other increase in apoptosis as
shown in Annexin V.
Effect of Cannabis sativa extracts and cannabidiol on cell
cycle progression
We further assessed the effects of Cannabis sativa ex-
tracts and cannabidiol on cell cycle progression using
flow cytometry. Flow cytometry showed that in the pres-
ence of Cannabis sativa crude extracts and camptothe-
cin, SiHa cells exhibited a significant increase (p < 0.001)
in sub-G0 population with a decrease in G0/G1, S, and
G2/M phase. In butanol, sub-G0 phase was increased
from 4.2 to 20.1 %, while decreasing the G0/G1 (from
64.0 to 48.7 %), S-phase (from 9.3 to 6.5 %), and G2/M
(from 18.5 to 17 %) in SiHa population (Fig. 9a) while in
hexane treated sub-G0 phase was at 39.1 % compared to
4.2 % in untreated, with a decrease in G0/G1 (from 64.0
to 30.4 %), S (from 9.3 to 6.5 %), and G2/M (from 18.5
to 13.8 %) population (Fig. 9a). In HeLa cells, butanol
extracts reduced G0/G1 to 54.9 % while the S-phase and
G2/M significantly increased to 18.4 and 25.7 % while
with hexane there was increase in the G2/M phase
(20.3 %) and a decrease in the S-phase (8.1 %). In ME-180
there was insignificant increase in all cell cycle stages.
Each cell line responded differently to cannabidiol treat-
ment. Almost 42.2 % of SiHa cells were observed in the
sub-G0 (p < 0.001) while there was reduction in cells in
the G0/G1 phase, from 57.9 to 42.8 % (Fig. 9d). A similar
trend was observed in HeLa cells but much lower sub-G0
(from 5.1 to 17.4 %) and S phase (from 4.8 to 11.2 %)
(Fig. 9e). A similar event was observed during treatment
of ME-180 cells. Cannabidiol significantly increased sub-
G0 in ME-180 cells to 34.3 % (Fig. 9f). From this data, we
can conclude that cannabidiol induced cell death without
cell cycle arrest.
Effect of Cannabis sativa extracts and cannabidiol on the
expression of upstream and downstream target proteins
From the apoptosis experiments conducted, it is clear
that the mode of cell death induced by cannabidiol and
extract
of
Cannabis
Savita
was
that
of
apoptosis.
However, we needed to confirm whether the type of
apoptosis induced is it p53 dependent or independent as
it is well known that p53 is mutated in many cancers.
Protein expression of RBBP6, Bcl-2, Bax and p53were
performed and results recorded. In butanol extract p53

 was significantly increased in SiHa and HeLa cells while
remaining unchanged in ME-180. Similar results were
observed in hexane treated cells. In all cell lines the level
of p53 negative regulator in cancer development was
reduced by all treatment.
Following treatment of cervical cancer cells, Bax pro-
tein was up-modulated and Bcl-2 was down-modulated.
Western blot analysis revealed that cannabidiol effectively
caused an increase in the expression of pro-apoptosis pro-
teins, p53 and Bax, while simultaneously decreasing the
anti-apoptosis proteins, RBBP6 and Bcl-2 in all three cer-
vical cancer cell lines (SiHa, HeLa, and ME-180 cells).
Caspases play an effective role in the execution of apop-
tosis, an effector caspase-9 and executor capsase-3 were
included in our western blot to check if they played a role
in inducing apoptosis. In all Cannabis sativa extracts,
caspase-3 and caspase-9 were upregulated in all cell lines.
Similar results were also observed in cannabidiol treated
cells with upregulation of both caspase-3 and -9.
Discussion
Cervical cancer remains a burden for women of Sub-
Saharan Africa. Half a million new cases of cervical
cancer and a quarter of a million deaths are reported an-
nually due to lack of effective treatment [12]. Currently,
the recommended therapeutic regimens include chemo-
therapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. However, they
present several limitations including side effects or inef-
fectiveness [2]. Therefore, it is important to search for
new novel therapeutic agents that are naturally synthe-
sized and cheaper, but still remain effective. Medicinal
plants have been used for decades for health benefits
and to treat several different diseases [22]. In South
Africa, over 80 % of the population are still dependent

 on medicinal plants to maintain mental and physical
health [27]. However, some of the medicinal plants used
by these individuals are not known to be effective and
their safety is still unclear. It is therefore important to
scientifically evaluate and validate their efficacy and
safety. In the present study, cervical cancer cell lines
(SiHa, HeLa, and ME-180) were exposed to different
concentrations of Cannabis sativa extracts and that of
its compound, cannabidiol, with the aim of investigating
their anti-proliferative activity.
We first determined whether Cannabis sativa extracts
and cannabidiol possess anti-proliferative effects using
MTT assay. MTT assay determines IC50, which repre-
sents the half maximal concentration that induces 50 %
cell death. Cannabis sativa extracts were able to reduce
cell viability and increase cell death in SiHa, HeLa, and
ME-180 cells. These results correlate with the findings
obtained by [23], whereby they reported reduced cell
proliferation in colorectal cancer cell lines following
treatment with Cannabis sativa. According to [7, 24, 25]
Cannabis sativa extracts rich in cannabidiol were able to
induce cell death in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP,
DU145, and PC3 at low doses (20–70 μg/ml). It was sug-
gested that cannabidiol might be responsible for the re-
ported activities. Therefore, in this study, cannabidiol
was included as a reference standard in order to deter-
mine whether the reported pharmacological activities
displayed by Cannabis sativa extracts might have been
due to the presence of this compound. For positive
extract inhibitory activity, Camptothecin was included as

with IC50 of Cannabis sativa and cannabidiol extracts for a period of 24 h. Caspase 3/7 reagent was added to the treated cells for 1 h. Luminescence–was

 a positive control. Camptothecin functions as an inhibitor
of a topoisomerase I enzyme that regulates winding of
DNA strands [19, 20]. This in turn causes DNA strands to
break in the S-phase of the cell cycle [20]. A study con-
ducted by [19], exhibited the ability of camptothecin to be
cytotoxic against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and also in-
duce apoptosis as a mode of cell death at 0.25 μM. We also
observed a similar cytotoxic pattern, whereby camptothecin
induced cell death in HeLa, SiHa, and ME-180 cells, how-
ever, at a much higher concentration.
xCELLigence continuously monitors cell growth, adhe-
sion, and morphology in real-time in the presence of a
toxic substance. Upon treatment of SiHa and HeLa cells
with IC50 of butanol extract, we noted that there was
little to no inhibitory effect observed on cell growth. The
growth curve continued in its exponential growth in all
cells
including
the
treated,
untreated
and

%
DM’SO. However, at a similar IC50 of 100 μg/ml, a
reduction
in
cell
viability
was
observed
following
treatment of HeLa cells with hexane extract. On the
other hand, ME-180 cells responded after a period of
2 h following treatment with the IC50 of butanol and
hexane extract. In comparison to butanol and hexane
extracts, cannabidiol reduced the cell index of ME-
180 cells after 2 h of treatment, signalling growth
inhibition. Differences in the findings could be attrib-
utable to the fact that both methods have different
principles and mechanism of action. MTT assay is an
end-point method that is based on the reduction of
tetrazolium salt into formazan crystals by mitochondrial
succinate dehydrogenase enzyme. Mitochondrial suc-
cinate dehydrogenase is only active in live cells with
an intact metabolism [8, 13]. Induction of cell death
by Cannabis sativa crude extracts decreases the activ-
ity of the enzyme following treatment of HeLa, SiHa,
and ME-180 cervical cancer cell lines. On the other
hand, xCELLigence system is a continuous method
that relies on the use of E-plates engraved with gold
microelectrodes

bottom
of
the
plate.
The

controls for comparative purposes. The level of significance was determined using Students t-Test with ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, and

 possible that dead cells might have been attached at
the bottom of the E-plate after treatment.
Cell death can be characterized by a decrease in the
energy levels as a result of dysfunction of the mitochon-
dria [8]. Therefore, to evaluate the effect of treatment on
the energy content of the cells, we conducted mitochon-
drial assay. We only used IC50 as indicated by MTT
assay only. ATP acts as determinant of both cell death
and cell proliferation [15]. Exposure of SiHa, HeLa, and
ME-180 cells to the IC50 of Cannabis sativa extracts
caused a reduction in the ATP levels. Treatment of cells
with cannabidiol either slightly or severely depleted the
ATP levels. According to [16], a reduction of the ATP
levels compromises the status of cell and often leads to
cell death either by apoptosis or necrosis, while an
increase is indicative of cell proliferation. Therefore, we
concluded that the reduction of ATP might have been as
a result of cell death induction since the cells ATP
production recovered.
Following confirmation that Cannabis sativa and can-
nabidiol have anti-proliferative activity, we had to verify
whether both treatments have the ability to induce cell
cycle arrest in all three cell lines. This method uses a PI
stain and flow cytometry to measure the relative amount
of DNA present in the cells. In this study, propidium
iodide (PI) was used to stain cells. Propidium iodide can
only intercalate into the DNA of fixed and permeabilized
cells with a compromised plasma membrane or cells in
the late stage of apoptosis. Viable cells with an intact
plasma membrane cannot uptake the dye. The intensity
of stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA
within the cells. HeLa, SiHa, and ME-180 cervical cancer
cells were stained with PI and analysed using flow
cytometry. Treatment of SiHa cells with butanol and
hexane extracts led to the accumulation of cells in the
cell death phase (sub-G0 phase), without cell cycle arrest.
When compared to the S-phase and G2/M phase of un-
treated cells, exposure of HeLa cells to Cannabis sativa
butanol extract resulted in the accumulation of cells in
the S-phase of the cell cycle and slight cell death induc-
tion. And thus, according to [3], signals DNA synthesis
and cell cycle proliferation. A decrease in the S-phase

 and an increase in the G2/M phase of HeLa cells follow-
ing treatment with hexane extract, suggests a blockage
of mitosis and an induction of cell cycle arrest. Interest-
ing to note was that, treatment of ME-180 cells with
both extracts led to an increase of cells coupled by an
increase
in
the
S-phase
population
which
favours
replication and duplication of DNA. This was not the
case following treatment of cells with cannabidiol.
Cannabidiol resulted in the accumulation of cells in the
cell death phase of the cell cycle. SiHa, and HeLa, and
ME-180 cells were committed to the cell death phase. In
summary, Cannabis sativa induces cell death with or
without cell cycle arrest while cannabidiol induces cell
death without cell cycle arrest.
Apoptosis plays a major role in determining cell sur-
vival. Annexin V/FITC and PI were used to stain the
cells to be able to distinguish between viable, apoptotic
and necrotic cells. Annexin V/ FITC can only bind to
phosphatidylserine residues exposed on the surface of
the cell membrane while PI intercalates into the nucleus
and binds to the fragmented DNA. Viable cells cannot
uptake both dyes due to the presence of an intact cell
membrane. Since treatment caused the accumulation of
cells in the sub-G0 phase, also known as the cell death
phase, and the severe depletion of ATP levels by
cannabidiol, we further conducted an apoptosis assay.
Treatment of all three cell lines with camptothecin, IC50
of Cannabis sativa and cannabidiol exhibited the type of
induced cell death as apoptosis. Sharma et al. [25] also
showed
a
similar
pattern
of
cell
death,
whereby
treatment of a prostate cancer cell lines with Cannabis
sativa resulted in the induction of apoptosis.

Initiator caspase-9 and effecter caspase-3 were included to elucidate apoptosis induction

 Apoptosis is characterized by morphological changes
and biochemical features which include condensation of
chromatin, convolution of nuclear and cellular outlines,
nuclear fragmentation, formation of apoptotic blebs
within the plasma membrane, cell shrinkage due to the
leakage of organelles in the cytoplasm as well as the
presence of green stained cells at either late or early
apoptosis [5, 17, 28]. Annexin V/FITC and DAPI were
used to visualize the cells under a fluorescence confocal
microscopy. According to [18], an uptake of Annexin V/
FITC suggests the induction of apoptosis, since it can
only bind to externalized PS residues. This also proves
that during cell growth analysis, SiHa and HeLa cells
were undergoing cell death while still attached to the
surface of the flask.
Apoptosis is known to occur via two pathways, the
death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway
[30]. Cannabis sativa isolates including cannabidiol have
been implicated in apoptosis induction via the death re-
ceptor pathway, by binding to Fas receptor or through
an activated of Bax triggered by the synthesis of cer-
amide in the cells [4]. However, not much has been
reported on the induction of apoptosis via activation of
p53 by Cannabis sativa. Our focus in this study was also
to identify downstream molecular effect of extracts. One
such important gene is p53 which acts as a transcription
factor for a number of target genes [29]. Under normal
conditions, p53 levels are maintained through constant
degradation MDM2 and its monomers [29]. RBBP6 is
one of the monomers that helps degrade p53, due the

including caspases. Equal amount of protein (conc) was loaded in each well. Note that the darker the bands increased expression of the gene

 presence of Ring finger domain that promotes the inter-
action of both proteins [14]. In response to stress stimuli
such as DNA damage, hypoxia, UV light, and radiation
light, p53 becomes activated and causes MDM2 expres-
sion to decrease [10]. Mutation of p53, implicated to be
associated with 50 % of all human cancers, promote the
tumorigenesis. Bax and Bcl-2 form part of the proteins
that
regulate
apoptosis
via
the
mitochondria
[21].
Following activation, p53 translocates into the cytosol
and triggers the oligomerization of Bcl-2 with BAD,
resulting in the inhibition of Bcl-2 activity [17]. This in
turn allows Bax protein to be translocated to the mito-
chondria and participate in the release of cytochrome c
through poration of the outer mitochondrial membrane
[9, 17]. An imbalance between Bax and Bcl-2 has been
linked to the development and progression of tumours
through the resistance of apoptosis [17]. It is therefore
crucial to design drugs that would effectively target these
genes involved in the execution of apoptosis via the mito-
chondrial pathway. Camptothecin, hexane extract, and
cannabidiol effectively up-modulated the expression of
p53 in all three cell lines, leading to a decrease in RBBP6
protein expression. Apart from SiHa and HeLa, butanol
extract failed to up-modulate p53 in ME-180 cells.
Interesting to note is that butanol extract reduced the
expression of RBBP6 protein in ME-180 cells. The mech-
anism behind failure of butanol to up-modulate p53 while
down-modulating RBBP6 is unclear. However, we came to
a conclusion that butanol induces apoptosis independently
of p53. We further demonstrated that Cannabis sativa
extracts, cannabidiol, and camptothecin were able to
down-modulate the expression of Bcl-2 protein and up-
modulate Bax expression.
Caspases play an effective role in the execution of
apoptosis either through the extrinsic or intrinsic path-
way [9]. In this study, we wanted to validate whether

 caspase-9 and caspase-3 were involved in the initiation
and execution of apoptosis. We demonstrated the ability
of Cannabis sativa to initiate apoptosis by activating
caspase-9. However, execution of apoptosis was either
with or without the presence of capsase-3, depending on
each cell line. Western blot revealed that Cannabis
sativa hexane extract induced apoptosis via the activa-
tion of caspase-9 and caspase-3 when compared to
untreated cells in all three cell lines. Similar results were
obtained during treatment of all three cell lines with
camptothecin. This was not the case with butanol. Butanol
extracts up-modulated caspase-9 and caspase-3 in SiHa
and HeLa cells only. Caspase-3 was not up-modulated in
ME-180 cells. Caspase 3/7 activity assay revealed the up-
modulation of caspase 3/7 following treatment of cervical
cancer cells. However on the basis of the Western blot
results, wherein butanol extract failed to up-modulate
caspase-3, we can conclude that caspase-7 was responsible
for the reported activity. Cannabidiol effectively up-
modulated caspase-9 and caspase-3 in all three cell lines,
when compared to the untreated and Cannabis sativa
extract. From the results we can conclude that, apoptosis
induction was caspase dependent.
Conclusions
The aim of this study was to evaluate for the anti-growth
effects of Cannabis sativa extracts and to also determine
the mode of cell death following treatment. The activity of
Cannabis sativa extracts was compared to that of canna-
bidiol, in order to verify whether the reported results were
due to the presence of the compound. The study showed
that the activity of one of the extracts might have been
due to the presence of cannabidiol. It further demon-
strated the ability of Cannabis sativa to induce apoptosis
with or without cell cycle arrest and via mitochondrial
pathway. More research needs to be done elucidating the
mechanism between the active ingredients and molecular
targets involved in the regulation of the cell cycle.
