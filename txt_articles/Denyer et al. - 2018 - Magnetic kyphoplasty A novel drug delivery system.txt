Abstract
Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) caused by metastatic malignancies or osteoporosis
are devastating injuries with debilitating outcomes for patients. Minimally invasive kypho-
plasty is a common procedure used for symptomatic amelioration. However, it fails in treat-
ing the underlying etiologies of VCFs. Use of systemic therapy is limited due to low
perfusion to the spinal column and systemic toxicity. Localized delivery of drugs to the verte-
bral column can provide a promising alternative approach. A porcine kyphoplasty model
was developed to study the magnetically guided drug delivery of systemically injected mag-
netic nanoparticles (MNPs). Jamshidi cannulated pedicle needles were placed into the tho-
racic vertebra and, following inflatable bone tamp expansion, magnetic bone cement was
injected to the vertebral body. Histological analysis was performed after intravenous injec-
tion of MNPs. Qualitative analysis of harvested tissues revealed successful placement of
magnetic cement into the vertebral body. Further quantitative analysis of histological sec-
tions of several vertebral bodies demonstrated enhanced accumulation of MNPs to regions
that had magnetic cement injected during kyphoplasty compared to those that did not. By
modifying the kyphoplasty bone cement to include magnets, thereby providing a guidance
stimulus and a localizer, we were successfully able to guide intravenously injected magnetic
nanoparticles to the thoracic vertebra. These results demonstrate an in-vivo proof of con-
cept of a novel drug delivery strategy that has the potential to treat the underlying causes of
VCFs, in addition to providing symptomatic support.
Introduction
Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are devastating injuries that occur when the strength
of the vertebral body is overcome by combined axial and bending forces on the spine [1]. Path-
ological fractures resulting from spinal malignancies [2] and osteoporosis [3] account for the
most common causes of VCFs. Regardless of the etiology, VCFs present with limited mobility

 and chronic, intractable, and possibly debilitating pain. Chronically, VCFs can progress to the
collapse of the vertebral body, resulting in spinal instability and deformity due to kyphosis.
Such abnormal curvature of the spine can lead to loss of height, as well as severe loss of mobil-
ity and immense physical deconditioning due to inactivity that inevitably leads to impaired
social functioning and a significantly reduced quality of life [3].
Minimally invasive kyphoplasty plays a vital role in the management of VCFs. This surgical
procedure involves the insertion of an inflatable bone tamp (IBT) into the vertebral body. sub-
sequent inflation restores the vertebral body back to its proper height, while filling the IBT-cre-
ated cavity with bone cement re-establishes structural support [4]. Thus, kyphoplasty serves as
an effective symptomatic treatment option for VCFs that can significantly improve the quality
of life for patients. However, kyphoplasty alone does not offer patients any treatment for the
underlying causes of their fractures, thus requiring systemic therapeutics for their long-term
disease management. Currently treatments for osteoporosis and spinal malignancies are lim-
ited due to low degree of blood perfusion in the spine [5, 6] and systemic toxicity due to the
accumulation of these drugs in healthy tissue throughout the body [6, 7]. These barriers can be
potentially overcome through targeting strategies that can localize therapeutics to the spinal
column.
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) possess unique chemical and physical properties which
can be harnessed for targeted drug delivery strategies. In addition to being highly responsive
to external magnetic fields, they can be functionalized to carry specific drugs, thereby serving
as versatile platforms [8, 9]. Tethering of folic acid to MNPs has the advantage of increasing
the targeting specificity of chemotherapeutics to cancer cells [10]. Additionally, the ability to
modify drug loaded MNPs to be pH and temperature sensitive allows for chemotherapeutics
to be released only once they are incorporated at the site of tumor growth [11–14]. This ability
decreases the systemic toxicity associated with chemotherapeutics. Indeed, these features of
nanoparticles have been previously used to deliver chemotherapeutics [11, 12, 15, 16] and
nucleic acids [17] to specific tumor sites while demonstrating decreased systemic drug toxicity
and increased treatment efficacy. In addition, drug loaded MNPs demonstrated continued and
sustained drug release, which is important for long term management of chronic etiologies
associated with VCFs. As such, these multipurpose nanoparticles can serve as ideal carrier plat-
forms for targeting drugs to the spinal column. Furthermore, MNPs are biocompatible and
MRI responsive, allowing them to be used therapeutically and monitored by non-invasive
imaging modalities [10, 18].
In this study, we show that MNPs can be effectively localized to the spinal column by modi-
fying the kyphoplasty procedure. By adding magnets to the kyphoplasty bone cement, we cre-
ated a physical stimulus for the localization of the magnetic nanoparticles. This strategy has
the potential to serve as a novel and extremely effective drug delivery system that combines
both symptomatic and disease-modifying treatments for VCFs.
Materials and methods
Experimental design
All experiments involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
(ACUC) of the University of Illinois at Chicago and conducted in accordance with the guide-
lines and regulations of the ACUC. One Landrace-Yorkshire cross pig underwent a kypho-
plasty procedure with Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cement and the placement of 12
stacked (each 1/16" dia. x 1/8" thick) neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets (K&J Magnet-
ics, Inc.) placed in an upper thoracic vertebral body. Additionally, an internal control of
PMMA without magnets was placed two vertebrae levels below the magnet enhanced

 kyphoplasty. Thus, the pig underwent kyphoplasty at two separate vertebral bodies, with the
vertebrae containing magnets being two levels above the PMMA only vertebra.
Kyphoplasty surgical procedure
A mixture of tiletamine with zolazepam (4.4 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.2 mg/kg) was used as pre-
operative anesthetic, and then 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at 1 L/min maintained anesthesia
during surgery. Localization of the proper vertebral bodies was done via C-arm image intensi-
fier X-ray. Once the proper vertebral bodies were identified, the surgical site was prepped and
local anesthesia administered. A Jamshidi cannulated needle was inserted through the pedicle
and into the vertebral body under X-ray guidance. Inflatable tamps were inserted bilaterally
through the injection cannula following removal of the guidewire, and inflated to 200 mmHg,
compacting the surrounding bone. 1.5 cc of PMMA cement (with or without magnet) was
implanted into each vertebral body while being monitored by anteroposterior and lateral
imaging to ensure adequate filling and positioning of the magnets. The PMMA cement was
allowed to harden and set before removal of the injection cannula, followed by approximation
of the incision with #4–0 nylon sutures, and application of compression dressings.
Iron core gold coated nanoparticle synthesis
Magnetic nanoparticles used in this study were synthesized according to a previously pub-
lished technique by Venugopal et al. [19] The magnetic nanoparticle core was synthesized via
coprecipitation of ammonium ferric hydroxide and ammonium ferrous hydroxide in sodium
hydroxide and given a gold coat by reduction of chloroauric acid. Nanoparticles were collected
by first decantation, then thorough washing with nanopure water, followed by 0.2um filtration.
The resulting MNPs were recovered by magnetic decantation, filtered (0.2μm filter) and stored
at 4˚C [20].
Intravenous injection of magnetic nanoparticles
24-hours after completion of the kyphoplasty, a 50 mg/mm2 solution of the MNPs was injected
into the right ear vein over 15 minutes under the guidance of a veterinarian.
Histopathology
24 hours after the nanoparticle injection, the animal was euthanized by intravenous adminis-
tration of 4.4 mg/kg Telazol and 2.2 mg/kg Zylazine. The thoracic vertebral bodies were har-
vested, along with a lumbar vertebral body which was not operated on. The vertebrae were
grossly imaged, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, then prepared for histological processing by
decalcification with hydrochloric acid prior to being embedded in paraffin. Continuous 12 μm
thick sections were prepared and stained with Prussian blue for iron, and counterstained with
nuclear fast red for visualization of structure (IHC world protocol). Ten fields of view at 200x
were taken from tissue samples of each of the vertebral bodies. ImageJ was used to quantify the
Prussian blue staining in terms of number of pixels and percentage of pixels.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7. A one-way ANOVA was used to test for sta-
tistical significance. Differences were considered statistically significant if p<0.05. All data are
presented as mean ± standard deviation.

 Results
Establishing a porcine minimally invasive magnetic kyphoplasty model
To study the novel vertebral drug delivery system, we developed a porcine kyphoplasty model
(Fig 1). First, the Jamshidi cannulated needles are inserted into the vertebral body through the
pedicles bilaterally (Fig 2A), allowing inflatable tamps to be used to compress the surrounding
bone. Following deflation and removal of the tamps, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
cement mixed with neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets were implanted into the tho-
racic vertebral body. Gas ethylene oxide sterilized NdFeB magnets were used, as they are
known to be biocompatible [21]. As an internal control, PMMA without magnets was placed
two vertebrae levels below the magnet enhanced kyphoplasty. Intraoperative X-ray used for
guidance demonstrated that the magnets were successfully inserted into an upper thoracic ver-
tebral body (Fig 2B). The cement mixture was allowed to harden and set, then the incision was
closed, and the pig allowed to recover. As kyphoplasty is minimally invasive and pain manage-
ment was provided, the male pig recovered well from the surgery with no signs of complica-
tion. 24 hours later, a solution of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was infused through the ear
vein without any signs of hyperacute infusion reaction. We hypothesized that the introduction
of the magnet into the vertebral body would provide sufficient localizing magnetic signal for
systemically injected magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs).
The thoracic vertebral bodies that were subjected to kyphoplasty with and without magnets
along with a control (no kyphoplasty) lumbar vertebra were removed from the animal 24
hours after MNP infusion. Close examination of the exterior of the vertebral bodies reveals a
dark spot on one of the bodies indicating the placed magnet during the kyphoplasty (Fig 2C),
confirming the intraoperative X-ray results. Inspection of the lumbar vertebra and the thoracic

a porcine vertebra. Following inflation of the balloon, PMMA cement with or without magnets is injected into the vertebra. 24-hours after surgery, magnetic
nanoparticles (MNPs) are injected systemically via the ear vein. (Image illustrated by Victoria Zakrzewski.).

 vertebra that did not have a magnet placed did not display any similar dark spots. The darker
color of the magnet enhanced kyphoplasty bone marrow resulted from deposition of the
MNPs, whose iron core confers a dark color (Fig 2D).
Localization of MNPs in magnetic kyphoplasty
Histological staining using Prussian blue was used to further visualize the presence or absence
of MNPs. Paraffin embedded, 12μm sections of vertebral bodies were exposed to Prussian blue
and nuclear fast red stains. Prussian blue stain labeled the MNPs, as they have an iron core,
and nuclear fast red allowed for visualization of tissue structure. The magnet-enhanced kypho-
plasty displayed typical bone marrow structure and exhibited large clustering of the Prussian
blue stain in addition to a diffuse spread of Prussian blue labeled particles throughout the tis-
sue (Fig 3A and 3B). Further inspection at higher magnifications revealed that the large MNP
clusters occurred perivascularly, and that the diffuse staining was distributed throughout the
tissue away from the blood vessels (Fig 3A).

 revealed marked differences (Fig 3B). In contrast to the magnetic kyphoplasty vertebrae, the
thoracic control kyphoplasty displayed typical structure and very little, if any, Prussian blue
staining. The lumbar (no surgery) bone marrow appeared very similarly, displaying character-
istic cellular architecture with little to no Prussian blue stain (Fig 3B). Ultimately, the histologi-
cal staining revealed the presence of MNPs in large quantities within the magnet-enhanced
kyphoplasty vertebral body, and relative absence of MNPs within the control kyphoplasty and
non-operated lumbar vertebral bodies. These qualitative observations were further quantified
using pixel analysis of the Prussian blue data. The number of Prussian blue positive pixels were
determined using ImageJ and used to calculate the percentage of pixels which displayed Prus-
sian blue stain. The magnetically enhanced vertebral body had a statistically significant higher
number of Prussian blue positive cells compared to control sample (Fig 3C).
Discussion
Although kyphoplasty can provide symptomatic support, it does not address the underlying
causes of VCF. Here, we provide a proof of concept demonstration of a novel, innovative drug
delivery system for the spinal column that utilizes magnet enhanced kyphoplasty to target

 systemically delivered magnetic nanoparticles to the vertebral body. We successfully developed
the magnetic kyphoplasty procedure, the first of its kind, that combines the palliative care of
kyphoplasty with the ability to target systemically delivered magnetic nanoparticles to the ver-
tebral body. Moreover, our model system was performed in a Landrace-Yorkshire pig, which
demonstrates the ability of our approach to work in large animals. The animal tolerated the
procedure and recovered with no complications. A lack of a hyperacute infusion reaction to
the MNPs further supports the safety of this procedure. In order to demonstrate the ability of
intravertebral magnets to localize MNPs, the thoracic magnet-enhanced vertebra was com-
pared to both the thoracic control kyphoplasty and non-operative lumbar vertebrae after sys-
temic infusion of the MNPs. Both macroscopic and histologic quantification demonstrated
increased ability of magnet-enhanced kyphoplasty to localize magnetic nanoparticles to the
vertebral body compared to standard kyphoplasty. The bone marrow of both vertebral bodies
displayed characteristic structure under microscopy, indicating the addition of magnets during
kyphoplasty does not appear to negatively affect the tissue more than typical kyphoplasty pro-
cedures. The Prussian blue staining pattern displayed large perivascular clusters and diffuse
individual MNPs throughout the bone marrow space, indicating the MNPs can exit the blood
vessel lumen and spread throughout the vertebral body tissue. In their entirety, the results
demonstrate that our novel procedure of magnet-enhanced kyphoplasty can be utilized to suc-
cessfully localize magnetic nanoparticles to the vertebral body. With further development,
magnet-enhanced kyphoplasty has the potential to become an integrated surgical option for
primary and metastatic spinal column tumor patients that combines the spinal stabilization
and pain relief provided by traditional kyphoplasty with targeted chemotherapy delivery.
The results signify that this proof of concept for the localization of MNPs to the vertebral
body via magnet-enhanced kyphoplasty. This novel technique has potential for treatment and
localized drug delivery for spinal fractures in osteoporotic patients as well as spinal column
cancer patients as the magnetic nanoparticles can be loaded with different pharmacological
agents. For instance, magnetic nanoparticles could be loaded with bisphosphonates or bone
morphogenic protein in an attempt to treat the underlying osteoporosis that caused the VCF.
For neoplastic causes of VCFs, the particles could be loaded with the chemotherapeutic of
choice. In addition, MNPs with different pharmacological agents could be used in the same
patient to increase efficacy of treatment and prevent subpopulations of the tumor from devel-
oping chemoresistance. By demonstrating that our novel magnetic kyphoplasty can selectively
deliver MNPs to the vertebral body, efficacy studies of the many therapeutic uses can to be
conducted. However, there are limitations to this study, such as the limited sample size. Also,
although the platform can deliver MNPs to the vertebral body, this experiment did not for-
mally demonstrate that MNPs carrying drug cargos can be delivered to the vertebral body.
Additional animal studies are needed to address the efficacy and long-term effects of our novel
delivery system. Development of an advanced metastatic pig model, such as prostate cancer,
will enable future studies to investigate the ability of our delivery system to treat spinal column
lesions. Regardless of the limitations, this experiment demonstrates that magnet-enhanced
kyphoplasty is able to localize systemically-injected magnetic nanoparticles to specific loca-
tions in the spinal column.
The results from this study propose a novel method that integrates kyphoplasty and a mag-
netically localizable drug delivery system to target drug loaded magnetic nanoparticles to the
spinal column. Investigations for this proposed proof-of-concept were successfully carried out
on a pig model. In a comparison between the experimental vertebral body that received
PMMA and magnets and the control vertebral body that only received PMMA or a lumbar
vertebra, stark differences were observed in the gross and microscopic observations following
intravenous injection of MNPs. Given that both the controls and experimental vertebra of

 interest came from the same pig, the localization of the systemically-injected magnetic nano-
particles to the magnet-enhanced experimental vertebrae provides proof that magnet-
enhanced kyphoplasty can be utilized as a means of localizing magnetic nanoparticles to tar-
geted areas in the spinal column. This novel kyphoplasty procedure has the potential to merge
two separate, extremely effective treatments into one cohesive therapy for patients with VCFs
to provide a means of improving quality of life and long-term prognosis.
