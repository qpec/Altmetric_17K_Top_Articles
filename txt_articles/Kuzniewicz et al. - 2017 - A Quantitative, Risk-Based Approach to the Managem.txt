IMPORTANCE Current algorithms for management of neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) result
in medical intervention for large numbers of uninfected infants. We developed multivariable
prediction models for estimating the risk of EOS among late preterm and term infants based
on objective data available at birth and the newborn’
s clinical status.
OBJECTIVES To examine the effect of neonatal EOS risk prediction models on sepsis
evaluations and antibiotic use and assess their safety in a large integrated health care system.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study cohort includes 204 485 infants born at 35
weeks’gestation or later at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospital from January 1,
2010, through December 31, 2015. The study compared 3 periods when EOS management
was based on (1) national recommended guidelines (baseline period [January 1, 2010,
through November 31, 2012]), (2) multivariable estimates of sepsis risk at birth (learning
period [December 1, 2012, through June 30, 2014]), and (3) the multivariable risk estimate
combined with the infant’
s clinical condition in the first 24 hours after birth (EOS calculator
period [July 1, 2014, through December 31, 2015]).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was antibiotic administration in the
first 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included blood culture use, antibiotic administration
between 24 and 72 hours, clinical outcomes, and readmissions for EOS.
RESULTS The study cohort included 204 485 infants born at 35 weeks’gestation or later:
95 343 in the baseline period (mean [SD] age, 39.4 [1.3] weeks; 46 651 male [51.0%]; 37 007
white, non-Hispanic [38.8%]), 52 881 in the learning period (mean [SD] age, 39.3 [1.3] weeks;
27 067 male [51.2%]; 20 175 white, non-Hispanic [38.2%]), and 56 261 in the EOS calculator
period (mean [SD] age, 39.4 [1.3] weeks; 28 575 male [50.8%]; 20 484 white, non-Hispanic
[36.4%]). In a comparison of the baseline period with the EOS calculator period, blood culture
use decreased from 14.5% to 4.9% (adjusted difference, −7.7%; 95% CI, −13.1% to −2.4%).
Empirical antibiotic administration in the first 24 hours decreased from 5.0% to 2.6%
(adjusted difference, −1.8; 95% CI, −2.4% to −1.3%). No increase in antibiotic use occurred
between 24 and 72 hours after birth; use decreased from 0.5% to 0.4% (adjusted difference,
0.0%; 95% CI, −0.1% to 0.2%). The incidence of culture-confirmed EOS was similar during
the 3 periods (0.3% in the baseline period, 0.3% in the learning period, and 0.2% in the EOS
calculator period). Readmissions for EOS (within 7 days of birth) were rare in all periods (5.2
per 100 000 births in the baseline period, 1.9 per 100 000 births in the learning period, and
5.3 per 100 000 births in the EOS calculator period) and did not differ statistically (P = .70).
Incidence of adverse clinical outcomes, including need for inotropes, mechanical ventilation,
meningitis, and death, was unchanged after introduction of the EOS calculator.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clinical care algorithms based on individual infant estimates
of EOS risk derived from a multivariable risk prediction model reduced the proportion of
newborns undergoing laboratory testing and receiving empirical antibiotic treatment without
apparent adverse effects.

N
eonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) is defined as inva-
sive bacterial infection of the blood and/or cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF) that occurs in the first week after
birth. The pathogenesis is primarily ascending colonization of
the maternal genital tract and uterine compartment with nor-
mal maternal gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract bacte-
rial flora, resulting in subsequent colonization and infection
of the fetus or newborn. Often EOS presents with nonspecific
signs (eg, tachypnea) that are also associated with normal tran-
sition to extrauterine life. In addition, EOS may result in se-
vere systemic illness and even death in 3% to 4% of infected
infants.1,2
TheCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention(CDC),3the
American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,4,5 and
the American Academy of Pediatrics6 provide guidelines for
the prevention of neonatal group B Streptococcus (GBS), in-
cluding recommendations for intrapartum antibiotic prophy-
laxis and algorithms for evaluation and treatment of at-risk in-
fants. These guidelines are based on epidemiologic data
obtained before the widespread obstetric use of intrapartum
antibiotic prophylaxis (when EOS incidence was 5- to 10-fold
higher than currently observed).7-11 These guidelines result in
a large percentage (15%-20%) of term and late preterm in-
fants being evaluated for sepsis, with 5% to 8% receiving em-
pirical antibiotics.12,13 Persistent high rates of evaluation and
treatment contrast with the decreasing incidence of EOS
(0.3-0.8 cases per 1000 births).12-14
UsingaBayesianapproachandabasepopulationof608014
newborns, we developed 2 linked prediction models for EOS.
Thefirstmodelestablishesanewborn’spriorprobabilityofEOS
based on gestational age, highest maternal antepartum tem-
perature, GBS carriage status, duration of rupture of mem-
branes, and the nature and timing of intrapartum antibiotic
administration.15 The second model quantifies how the base-
line risk is modified by the infant’s clinical examination.16
We instantiated these models with an online calculator
(kp.org\eoscalc).13 The key elements of the calculator are sum-
marized in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. We made this calcu-
latoravailabletophysiciansatKaiserPermanenteNorthernCali-
fornia (KPNC), an integrated health care system in Oakland,
California, and instructed clinicians on its use. In this report,

Methods
Study Population and Setting
The study cohort included 204 485 infants born at 35 weeks’
gestation or later at a KPNC hospital from January 1, 2010,
through December 31, 2015. Although we developed predic-
tion models using populations that included infants born at
34 weeks’ gestation, we excluded those infants because they
are routinely admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and
experience a higher level of monitoring. At the KPNC, all in-
patientandoutpatientcareistrackedthroughacommonmedi-
cal record number. If care outside the KPNC was required for
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), we captured
data on repatriation to the KPNC or death. Births occur at 14
hospitals. Infants born at a KPNC hospital are covered under
the mother'
s insurance for a minimum of 30 days, regardless
of the infant’s insurance status. The KPNC Institutional Re-
view Board approved this study and waived informed con-
sent because this was a data-only study.
Intervention and Study Periods
The baseline period was defined as January 1, 2010, through
November31,2012,whenclinicalcarewasinformedbytheCDC
GBS guidelines.3-5 During the learning period (December 1,
2012, through June 30, 2014), the EOS calculator based only
on maternal data was made available for clinical use, but no
guidance was given with respect to incorporation of the new-
born clinical presentation or intervention thresholds, permit-
ting staff to familiarize themselves with the calculator and
probability of EOS at birth. In the EOS calculator period (July
1,2014,throughDecember31,2015),thenewborn’sclinicalpre-
sentation (well, equivocal, and clinically ill) was incorpo-
rated into the risk prediction, and recommendations based on
the probability of EOS were included in the calculator output.
The categories of clinical presentation are defined at http://kp
.org/eoscalc and in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. Blood cul-
tureswererecommendediftheEOSriskwas1ormoreper1000

Outcomes
Our primary outcome was antibiotic administration in the first
24 hours. Secondary outcomes included blood culture use in
the first 24 hours, antibiotic administration between 24 and
72 hours, and number of days of antibiotic use (antibiotic days)
per 100 live births. We obtained data on antibiotics from the
electronic medication administration record and ascertained
blood and CSF cultures from the KPNC laboratory database.
Antibiotic days were tabulated as the number of calendar days
the infant received at least 1 dose of intravenous antibiotics.
To evaluate safety, we assessed readmissions for EOS and clini-
cal outcomes in our EOS cases. We defined EOS as blood or CSF
culture–confirmed infection with a pathogenic bacterial spe-
cies that occurred from birth through 7 days of age. We re-
viewed the medical records of all EOS cases to determine the
Key Points
Question Can the use of a predictive model to estimate risk of
early-onset sepsis safely decrease the proportion of newborns
evaluated by blood culture and empirically treated with
antibiotics?
Findings We compared evaluations by blood culture, antibiotic
administration, and readmissions for early-onset sepsis before and
after clinical implementation of a predictive model for early-onset
sepsis. Evaluations by blood culture and empirical antibiotic
administration decreased significantly without any significant
increase in the rate of readmissions for early-onset sepsis.
Meaning Clinical care based on a predictive model reduces the
proportion of newborns evaluated and empirically treated for
early-onset sepsis without apparent adverse effects.

infant’s clinical presentation, severity of illness, and out-
comes until hospital discharge. We assessed severity of ill-
ness in terms of need for mechanical ventilation or inotrope
medications, the presence of meningitis defined by CSF cul-
ture and/or cell count, or death due to sepsis.
Statistical Analysis
We compared infant and maternal characteristics across the
periodsusingtheχ2,Fisherexact,andanalysisofvariancetests,
asappropriate.Wedisplayedmonthlyratesoftestingandtreat-
ment using statistical process control charts. The baseline pe-
riodwasusedtocalculatethecontrollimits,±3SDsofthemean.
We estimated the effect of the intervention using an inter-
rupted time series design17,18 with segmented regression mod-
elscontrollingforpreinterventionlevels,trends,andothercon-
founders (ie, other events that occurred around the same time
as the intervention and that potentially influenced the out-
come). We measured time in months (from 1 to 72). Seg-
mented regression models fit a least squares regression line to
separate segments of time when certain events took place and
assume a linear association between time and the outcome in
each segment.19 This method is an appropriate means of analy-
sis for this study because we have a clear differentiation of the
baseline, learning, and intervention periods; we have short-
term outcomes that were expected to change relatively quickly
after an intervention is implemented; and sequential mea-
sures of the outcomes are available before and after the inter-
vention. For each outcome, we tested for a possible change in
the intercept and slope in the learning period and EOS calcu-
lator period while controlling for confounding covariates. The
models we fit are described in eFigure 2 in the Supplement.
We explored the effects on time-varying confounders, such as
seasonality and population characteristics, including monthly
percentage of male infants, cesarean delivery, rupture of mem-
branes time of 18 hours or longer, preterm infants, intrapar-
tum antibiotics, GBS positivity, small for gestational age in-
fants, and African American infants. We retained covariates
in the final model if they were significant at a 2-sided P < .05.
Finally, we assessed for autocorrelation in each of the time
series by examining the plot of residuals and the partial
autocorrelation function. We used autoregressive integrated
moving average models to adjust for autocorrelation when it
was present.20 We compared readmissions for culture-
positive sepsis or meningitis, differences in EOS organism,
symptoms, and infant outcomes by using the χ2 or Fisher
exact test, as appropriate.
Results
The study cohort included 204 485 infants born at 35 weeks’
gestation or later: 95 343 in the baseline period (mean [SD] age,
39.4 [1.3] weeks; 46 651 male [51.0%]; 37 007 white, non-
Hispanic[38.8%]),52 881inthelearningperiod(mean[SD]age,
39.3 [1.3] weeks; 27 067 male [51.2%]; 20 175 white, non-

(mean [SD] age, 39.4 [1.3] weeks; 28 575 male [50.8%]; 20 484
white, non-Hispanic [36.4%]). Characteristics of the infants
born in these 3 periods were similar (Table 1), with small but
statisticallysignificantdemographicdifferencesamongthepe-
riods. The incidence of culture-confirmed EOS was not statis-
tically different across periods.

ceiving intravenous antibiotics in the first 24 hours after birth.
In a comparison of the baseline period and the EOS calculator
period, blood culture use decreased from 14.5% to 4.9%; the
adjusted difference (change in level from the interrupted time
series analysis) was −7.7% (95% CI, −13.1% to −2.4%) (Table 2).
Empirical antibiotic administration in the first 24 hours de-
creased from 5.0% to 2.6% (adjusted difference, −1.8%; 95%
CI, −2.4% to −1.3%). There was no evidence of an increase in
antibiotic use between 24 and 72 hours after birth because use
decreasedfrom0.5%to0.4%(adjusteddifference,0.05%;95%
CI, −0.12% to 0.22%). Antibiotic days per 100 births also de-
creased from 16.0 to 8.5 days (adjusted difference, −3.3 days;
95% CI, −6.1 to −0.5 days). The learning period was not statis-
tically different from the baseline period in the segmented re-
gression models. The time trend (slope) during the EOS pe-
riod and learning period did not significantly differ from the
baseline period in any of the final models.
Weaddressed2potentialadverseeffectsofdecreasingrates
of newborn sepsis evaluation and empirical antibiotics: de-
layed treatment of infants with EOS presenting with more se-
vere clinical illness and increases in hospital readmissions for
EOS after hospital discharge. We reviewed all cases of EOS dur-
ing the study. No statistically significant differences existed
among the study periods in the proportion of cases caused by
GBS and Escherichia coli, the timing of case identification, or
the presence of symptoms (Table 3).
Sepsis-associated severity of illness, as assessed by use of
mechanical ventilation, inotrope medications, meningitis, or
death, did not differ among the study periods. The infant who
died during the learning period had pulmonary hypertension
and respiratory failure and underwent immediate treatment
with antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and ECMO. The in-
fant who died during the EOS calculator period was born with
severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and underwent im-
mediate treatment with antibiotics, mechanical ventilation,
inotropic agents, therapeutic hypothermia, and ECMO.
Of the 12 infants with EOS born during the EOS calculator
period, 6 were symptomatic at birth and empirically treated
withantibiotics.Fiveinfantswerewell-appearingatbirth;each
developed symptoms during the birth hospitalization that
prompted evaluation and antibiotic therapy. Only 1 infant
wouldhavemetthecriteriaforsepsisevaluationundertheCDC
guidelines. The infant was born to a mother who was GBS posi-
tive with fever (temperature to 38.0°C) who did not receive an-
tibiotics. The infant was well at birth with an EOS risk of 0.15
per 1000 births but developed tachypnea, prompting a blood
culture at approximately 36 hours of life. The infant’s respi-
ratory rate normalized, and the infant was discharged home.
The blood culture eventually yielded E coli, prompting read-
mission. Blood and CSF culture samples obtained before an-

EOS risk of 2.3 per 1000 births, and per the calculator recom-
mendations, a blood sample was obtained for culture at birth.

Discussion
Although the use of predictive analytics is garnering in-
creased attention in the scientific literature,21,22 use of patient-
specific, multivariable sepsis risk estimates to guide the care
of newborns represents a significant shift from current rec-
ommended practice in neonatology. Our work provides
prospective validation of the efficiency and safety of this
approach.
The CDC EOS recommendations were based on epidemio-
logic findings that preceded widespread implementation of in-
trapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. These recommendations
have been highly effective in reducing the burden of EOS.3,23
The guidelines suggest empirical administration of antibiot-
ics for all newborns with a maternal diagnosis of chorioam-
nionitis, regardless of the infant’s clinical condition. Chorio-
amnionitistechnicallydescribesinflammationofthechorionic
and amniotic fetal membranes but has been widely applied to
any intrapartum temperature of 38.0°C or higher. In our ap-
proach, we use the highest maternal temperature, modeled as
a log-linear relationship with EOS. A recent National Insti-
tutes of Health–sponsored conference of experts in obstetric
and neonatal care highlighted the shortcomings of current ap-
proaches based on a clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis and
urged the use of alternate approaches, including our EOS
calculator.24 Our results indicate that EOS risk can be accu-
rately and safely assessed without using a clinical diagnosis
of chorioamnionitis.
Amulticenteranalysisexaminedwhetherinfantclinicalap-
pearancealonecouldbeusedtoruleoutEOSamonginfantsborn
tomotherswithaclinicaldiagnosisofchorioamnionitis.25 That
analysis found that EOS can occur among infants with initially
reassuring clinical status. Our study found that only 50% of in-
fants with EOS were symptomatic at birth. These findings un-
derscore the importance of our approach, incorporating mul-
tiple risk factors and the evolving clinical status in the first day
of life. The CDC recommends sepsis evaluations for newborns
who are clinically ill (a term that is not defined).3 Our approach
adds clarity by categorizing physiologic disturbances by dura-
tion and severity.
The goal of all existing approaches to neonatal sepsis risk
assessment is newborn safety. In this study, we assessed safety
by measuring the incidence of EOS, use of antibiotics at 24 to
72 hours of age, proportion of infants with EOS who experi-
enced critical illness or death, and incidence of EOS readmis-
sions across the 3 study periods. We were concerned that if
antibioticadministrationimmediatelyafterbirthpreventslow-
level bacteremia from progressing to clinical illness and/or de-
tectable bacteremia, a decrease in early antibiotic use could
result in higher rates of EOS. We did not find any difference in
the overall rate of EOS across the study periods. Another con-
cern was that if the EOS calculator failed to appropriately iden-
tify asymptomatic infants destined to later develop sympto-
matic EOS, infants would become ill later in the birth
hospitalization, have more severe illness, or present with ill-

ness after discharge. We did not find any difference in use of
antibiotics at 24 to 72 hours of age that would indicate a skew
toward later symptomatic EOS. We also did not find any dif-
ference in the proportion of infants with EOS who required in-
tensive care or who died of EOS. Finally, we found no change
in the low baseline rate of readmissions for culture-
confirmedorculture-negativeEOSinthefirst7daysafterbirth.
In the EOS calculator period, antibiotic treatment was ini-
tiated in 2 infants with bacteremia later than the time recom-
mended by the CDC. Neither infant had clinical sepsis, and ad-
ditional blood cultures were sterile before the administration
of antibiotics. A proportion of infants with EOS in each period
were well-appearing at birth and presented with clinical signs
of illness later in the birth hospitalization. Every approach to
EOS risk assessment involves the decision to offer only clini-
cal observation at a certain level of predicted risk. Prior ap-
proaches have not been explicit about this decision. The cal-
culator approach requires clinicians to explicitly identify the
level of predicted risk at which specific actions (clinical ob-
servation, laboratory testing, or empirical antibiotics) will
be taken.13
Limitations
Because newborn safety is of paramount importance, limita-
tions of our study must be emphasized. First, rare serious
events may not be detected: although we report a cohort of
more than 200 000 births, the population incidence of EOS is
low, and the incidence of additional hospitalization for EOS is
another 10-fold lower. Larger studies are warranted to evalu-
ate the safety of delaying antibiotic treatment until infants be-
come symptomatic or a blood culture test result becomes posi-
tive. Nonetheless, in our cohort, no adverse events were seen,
suggesting that even if there is a negative effect, it is uncom-
mon and would need to be weighed against the negative ef-
fectsofsepsisevaluationsandantibioticexposure.Second,not
all cases of EOS can be predicted by any risk factor–based strat-
egy. Previous studies16,26,27 have found that GBS-specific EOS
continuestooccurininfantsborntomotherswhoscreenfalsely
negative for GBS, without other intrapartum risk factors for
EOS, underscoring the need for clinical observation as part of
any EOS strategy. Third, our study was conducted in an inte-
grated health care system with high rates of prenatal care and
comprehensivepostdischargecare.ThepriorprobabilityofEOS
in lower-resource settings may differ from those in the KPNC;
however, the EOS calculator adjusts for this by allowing for the
input of the baseline EOS incidence in the target population
to appropriately increase EOS risk predictions. Although some
birth hospitals may lack the KPNC outpatient follow-up infra-
structure,ourdataindicatethatreadmissionforEOSinthefirst
week of life is rare. Non-KPNC hospitals have adopted varia-
tions of the EOS calculator and have also reported reductions
in antibiotic use.28,29 Fourth, because this study evaluated the
implementation of the EOS calculator in infants born at 35
weeks’ gestation or later, the results are not applicable to
infants born earlier.
Conclusions
Antibiotic treatment has risks and benefits, and the adminis-
trationofantibioticstouninfectedpatientsmeansthattheyonly
assume the risks. As more studies reveal the association be-
tweenearlyantibioticexposureanddiseasesinchildhood,such
as asthma,30-35 autoimmune disorders,36-38 and obesity,39-42 it
is important to improve antibiotic stewardship, limiting un-
necessaryantibioticexposure.Furthermore,noantibiotictreat-
ment is not the same as no care. Our approach substitutes close
clinicalobservation,increasedfrequencyofinfantvitalsignas-
certainment, and parental education for wider use of empiri-
cal antibiotic treatment.13 If adopting our approach, indi-
vidual centers must assess local care structures and resources
and outpatient supports, including the presence of reliable
home caregivers and access to pediatric care. Although our
models account for differences in the local prior probability of
infection, centers with poor prenatal care (and low rates of GBS
screening), lack of pediatric follow-up, and/or poor social sup-
port after discharge may justify setting different risk thresh-
olds for clinical interventions.
Experts in neonatology have questioned the need for high
ratesofempiricalantibiotictreatmentamongtermandlatepre-
term newborns.24,43,44 Our study suggests that antibiotic
stewardship can safely begin at birth.
