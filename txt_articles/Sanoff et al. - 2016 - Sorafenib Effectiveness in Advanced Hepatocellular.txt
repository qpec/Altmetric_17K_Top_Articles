ABSTRACT
Background. Phase III trials show sorafenib improves survival
inadvancedhepatocellularcarcinoma(HCC).Becauseofnarrow
trialeligibility,resultsmaynotbegeneralizabletoabroaderHCC
population. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of initial
sorafenib versus no treatment among Medicare beneficiaries
with advanced HCC.
MaterialsandMethods. PatientswithadvancedHCCdiagnosed
from 2008 to 2011 were identified from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare database. Eligible
patients received initial sorafenib or no therapy and were
covered by Medicare parts A, B, and D. Sorafenib use and
outcomesweredescribedinthispopulation.Usingapropensity
score (PS)-matched sample, we compared the effectiveness of
sorafenib versus no treatment by Cox proportional hazards and
binomial regression, using a landmark requiring all patients to
survive $60 days after diagnosis.
Results. Of1,532patients,27%receivedinitialsorafenib.Median
duration of sorafenib use was 60 days (interquartile range [IQR],
30–107 days), and median survival from first prescription was
3 months (IQR, 1–8 months). In the PS-matched cohort, median
survival was 3 months from the 60-day landmark in sorafenib-
treated (n 5 223) and 2 months in untreated (n 5 223) patients
(adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI),
0.78–1.16]). Sorafenib was associated with a nonsignificant re-
duction in mortality at 3 months (44% versus 51%; adjusted risk
ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.72–1.07]), but no reduction thereafter.
Conclusion. Survival after sorafenib initiation in newly diag-
nosed Medicare beneficiaries with HCC is exceptionally short,
suggesting trial results are not generalizable to all HCC pa-
tients. The downsides of sorafenib use—high drug-related
symptomburdenandhighdrugcost—mustbeconsideredinlight
of this minimal benefit.The Oncologist 2016;21:1113–1120
Implications for Practice: The findings of a median survival of only 3 months in Medicare beneficiaries with HCC prescribed
sorafenib as first-line therapy highlight the questionable value of sorafenib in this population. Patients should be cautioned that
outsideofthe narrowconfines ofrandomizedtrials,their life expectancy maybevery short, and any benefitofsorafenib islikely to
be quitesmall. Given that sorafenib causes considerable adverse effects and offers no symptom palliation, supportive care should
be discussed as a reasonable alternative to sorafenib, particularly for patients who have a poor performance status or advanced
cirrhosis.
INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common
cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. Although less
common in more developed nations, in 2015 liver cancer is
anticipated to be the fifth leading cause of U.S. cancer death
in men and the ninth leading cause in women [2]. With an
increasing incidence rate, HCC will continue to be a major
global health problem for the foreseeable future [3]. HCC
arises almost exclusively in the background of cirrhosis, the
extent of which directly influences the safety of treatment
options and plays a major role in determining the prognosis
of HCC [4]. Unfortunately, most patients with HCC present
with extensive disease not amenable to curative-intent
resection or transplantation; for these patients prognosis is
uniformly poor.
Sorafenib, a multitargeted kinase inhibitor, is the only
drug that has demonstrated a survival benefit over
supportive care in advanced HCC. In the pivotal Sorafenib
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized Pro-
tocol(SHARP)trial,sorafenib-treatedpatientshadamedian
time to progression of 5.5 months and survival of 10.7
months, a 2.8-month absolute improvement in survival
over placebo [5]. This survival benefit was corroborated in

 the Asia-Pacific trial, the second placebo-controlled ran-
domized trial [6]. However, participants in both trials had good
performance status and early, compensated cirrhosis. Given
that the extent of cirrhosis and performance status are critical
featuresofHCCprognosis [4],the external validityofthe SHARP
and Asia-Pacific trial results might be limited.
To assess outcomes of sorafenib in a broader popula-
tion, the international Global Investigation of therapeutic
DEcisions in hepatocellular carcinoma and Of its treatment
with sorafeNib (GIDEON) registry enrolled patients initiating
sorafenib as part of routine care; its preliminary results
suggest patients treated with sorafenib who have compen-
sated, Child-Pugh (CP) class A (CPA) cirrhosis have out-
comes similar to those of patients in the SHARP trial,
whereas survival for patients with CP class B (CPB) and CP
classC(CPC)cirrhosisispoor,4.8and2months,respectively
[7, 8]. Because the GIDEON registry does not include a
comparator arm, whether sorafenib-treated patients did
receive some benefit from the drug despite the short
survival duration is unknown. Thus, we sought to evaluate

Downloaded from 
 the effectiveness of initial sorafenib for advanced HCC in
a population-based cohort of Medicare beneficiaries in
the U.S.
METHODS
TheOffice of HumanResearchEthics attheUniversityofNorth
Carolinadeemedthisanalysisexemptfromreview(#12-1828).
Study Population
The cohort was derived from the Surveillance Epidemiology
and End Results (SEER)–Medicare linkage. SEER collects data
on incident cancers from population-based registries covering
28% of the U.S. population. Linkage of SEER cases to Medicare
claims allows investigation of cancer treatment and outcomes
[9, 10]. The details of cohort selection are described in the
supplemental online Appendix. In brief, we included patients
diagnosed with HCC between 2008 and 2011. Because
sorafenib is indicated for advanced HCC, we restricted our
analysis to patients with multifocal tumors or extrahepatic
spread. Patients with preceding invasive cancer within the
past 5 years were excluded to avoid misclassification of liver
metastases. To ensure availability of complete claims for
analysis, we included only patients with continuous enroll-
ment in Medicare parts A, B, and D and patients not enrolled
in Medicare managed care plans in the 6 months before and
after diagnosis or until death.
Covariates
Patient demographic characteristics and socioeconomic indi-
cators were derived from SEER. The liver collaborative stage
extension variables, which are reported to SEER by the cancer
registrars program, were used to determine cancer extent,
including maximum tumor size, tumor multiplicity, and pres-
ence or absence of invasion into major portal and/or hepatic
vein branches. Diagnosis codes for underlying cause of liver
disease and complications of cirrhosis were used to control
for confounding liver disease [11]. HCC screening behavior
was ascertained by prediagnosis a-fetoprotein (AFP) [12, 13]
because screening is associated with decreased probability of
frailty in older adults [14]. Noncirrhotic comorbidity was
determined by using the Klabunde modification of the Charlson
Comorbidity Index [15], omitting codes for liver disease.
Treatment
Sorafenib use was determined from national drug codes in
Part D files. Because only 200-mg sorafenib pills are
available, we were able to estimate the starting dose of
drug by dividing the number of pills supplied by the
prescription’s recorded days supply. Duration of sorafenib
use was defined as the number of days between the date of
the initial prescription and the date of the final prescription
plus the days supply.
Statistical Analysis
Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate
factors associated with sorafenib receipt. We conducted
two survival analyses: (a) a descriptive analysis of survival
from time of initial sorafenib prescription to death in all
patients taking sorafenib as first-line therapy using Kaplan-
Meier methods and (b) a comparative survival analysis
between treated and untreated patients restricted to
patients who survived at least 60 days from diagnosis (the
landmark). In this restricted group, patients who initiated
sorafenib within 60 days of diagnosis were categorized as
sorafenib users and those who did not initiate before this
landmark were categorized as nonusers. These restrictions
were made to avoid immortal time bias, whereby patients
dying during the exposure window (e.g., within the first

 60 days after diagnosis) have a lower chance of receiving
treatment (and higher chance of being classified as
untreated), thereby artificially increasing the risk for the
outcome in the untreated group [16].
In this restricted cohort, we used propensity score (PS)
matching to evaluate the treatment effect among patients
balanced on key confounders (supplemental online Appendix;
supplemental online Tables 1, 2) [17–21]. Survival by treatment
group was compared using Cox proportional hazards models,
and mortality rates at 3, 6, and 12 months from the 60-day
landmark were then compared by using risk ratios by binomial
regression. To explore the possibility of heterogeneous treat-
ment effect, we calculated risk ratios by strata of key covariates.
To ensure patient confidentiality, all cells containing fewer than
11 patients are suppressed. Analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC, http://www.sas.com).
Sensitivity Analyses
In the descriptive survival analysis, we explored survival among
sorafenib-treated patients after requiring patients to fill two or
moreprescriptions.Becausepatientsreceivingsorafenibasfirst-
line therapy might be expected to be frailer, with more exten-
sive cancer than those who received sorafenib after prior
locoregional therapy, we also described survival from the
initial sorafenib prescription of patients who otherwise met
cohort eligibility but received a different first-line therapy. In
the comparative analysis, we examined the robustness of our
results by changing the 60-day landmark to 30 and 90 days.
RESULTS
A total of 1,532 patients met cohort eligibility criteria (Fig. 1).
Of these, 422 (27%) were treated with initial sorafenib after
diagnosis: 314 (74%) initiated drug within 60 days, 56 (13%)
between days 61 and 90, and 52 (12%) after 90 days. Of
patients initiating before 60 days, 242 survived to that
landmarkandmakeupthesorafenibgroupintheeffectiveness
comparison. The untreated group includes 565 who survived
60 days from diagnosis and did not receive sorafenib before
this landmark (Table 1).
Patterns of Sorafenib Use
The use of initial sorafenib increased during the time period
under study, which began the first full year after U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval for HCC. In the restricted
effectiveness cohort before PS matching (n 5 242), this
increase went from 24% of patients diagnosed in 2008 to 38%
of patients diagnosed in 2011 (odds ratio, 2.04 [95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.25–3.32]) (Table 1). Compared with patients who
received no treatment for their HCC, patients receiving first-line
sorafenibwereyounger,morelikelytobemarried,andmorelikely
to be from a metropolitan area. There was no evidence for
differingsorafenibuse byenrollmentinthePartD cost-sharing
program or with dual Medicaid eligibility.
Amongall patientstreated with sorafenib as initial therapy
(n 5 422), 141 (33%) saw both a gastroenterologist and a
hematologist/oncologist between diagnosis and start of
sorafenib treatment, 135 (32%) saw a hematologist/
oncologist only, 58 (14%) saw a gastroenterologist only, and
88 (21%) did not have a record for a visit with either
subspecialist during that time. Most patients, 322 (76%),
received an initial prescription for 4 pills per day, correspond-
ing to the FDA-approved dose of 400 mg b.i.d. Seventy-eight
(18%) began at a half-dose of 2 pills per day. The median
duration of sorafenib use was 60 days (interquartile range
[IQR], 30–107 days). Because patients may be instructed by
their physicians to take lower doses than is reflected by the
prescribing information, this may underestimate the duration
of sorafenib use. In the effectiveness cohort according to
the 60-day landmark, median duration of sorafenib use was
74 days (IQR, 30–132 days). In both matched and unmatched
cohorts, 29% of patients filled only one prescription.
Survival After Sorafenib Initiation
Among all 422 patients who received initial sorafenib, the
mediansurvivalfromthetimeoftheinitialprescriptionfilldate
was 3 months (IQR, 1–8 months). In sensitivity analysis

 Patients who received sorafenib as a subsequent therapy
(n 5 232) had a better prognosis at the time of diagnosis than
patientsreceivinginitialsorafenib,withlessadvancedcancerand
greater likelihood of prediagnosis AFP screening. In this group
with better prognosis, median survival from first sorafenib pre-
scription fill date was 9 months (IQR, 3–17 months).
Comparative Effectiveness of Sorafenib
In the PS-matched effectiveness cohort, median survival from
the 60-day landmark was 3 months for sorafenib-treated
patients (IQR, 1–8 months) and 2 months for untreated
patients (IQR, 1–8 months) patients (adjusted hazard
ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.78–1.16]) (Fig. 2A). Of note, because all
sorafenib patients began therapy before the landmark, this
median survival is not directly comparable to survival from the
first prescription described for the entire initial sorafenib
cohort (median survival from the initial prescription in this
restricted sorafenib group was 4 months [IQR, 2–9 months]).
By 3 months from the 60-day landmark, 51% of untreated
patients and 44% of sorafenib patients had died (adjusted
risk ratio [aRR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.72–1.07]). No trend toward
sorafenibbenefitwasapparentat6months(aRR,0.97[95%CI,
0.86–1.11]) or 12 months (aRR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.87–1.04])
(Figure2B,Table2).Insensitivityanalyses,varyingthelandmark
between 30 and 90 days and changing the survival anchor from
60-day landmark to the date of diagnosis had no substantive
effect on the findings (supplemental online Tables 3, 4).
Inanexploratorysubgroupanalysislimitedbysmallsample
size, the effectiveness of initial sorafenib appeared greatest in
patients with the lowest burden of disease (multiple tumors
without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread; 3-month
aRR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.51–0.95]); it was least pronounced in
patients age ,65 years (e.g., disabled beneficiaries), and
patients with more liver comorbidity (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
In this cohort of disabled and elderly Medicare beneficiaries, the
use of sorafenib as initial therapy for advanced HCC resulted in a
median survival of only 3 months, well below the 10.7-month
benchmarksetbytheSHARPtrial.Evenwithrestrictiontopatients
filling more than one prescription, which biases the analysis
toward sorafenib benefit by excluding patients dying during that
firstmonthoftherapy,themediansurvivalwasonly5months.We
further found that the survival of sorafenib-treated patients was
not significantly better than that of patients not undergoing HCC
treatment.
Although the median survival of sorafenib-treated
patients was exceptionally short, this short duration is
concordant with previously reported outcomes of patients
with advanced HCC treated outside clinical trials [8, 22].The
limitations of the SEER-Medicare dataset preclude a formal
assessment of survival by CP, performance status, or
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, yet it is likely that the
short survival in this population-based sample can be
explained by having more advanced liver disease on average
than patients treated in clinical trials. Notably, GIDEON registry
participants with CPB and CPC cirrhosis lived only 4.8 and
2 months, respectively, whereas patients who participated in
theSHARPtrialortheCPApatientsenrolledinGIDEONlivedfor
10.7 and 10.3 months, respectively [5, 8].
The inferior survival among these Medicare beneficiaries
treated with initial sorafenib is also likely attributable to a
higher cancer burden within our population than in SHARP or
GIDEON. To estimate the effectiveness of sorafenib versus no
therapy, we could include only patients for whom there is a
reasonable no-treatment control group: patients with newly
diagnosed disease. These patients treated with first-line
sorafenib had more advanced disease at diagnosis than
patients receiving other first-line treatment. Indeed, among
patientswith treatedwithsorafenib afterotherfirst-linetherapy
(65% transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, 19% surgery or
ablation), the observed median survival of 9 months is more
concordant with that of CPA patients in GIDEON and SHARP.The
exploratory subgroup analysis also suggested that those with
earlier-stage disease (e.g., without vascular invasion or extrahe-
patic metastases) were more likely to benefit. We believe
that, taken together, the lack of survival benefit afforded to
a population of newly diagnosed HCC patients with very ad-
vanced disease and the suggestion of benefit in those with
better prognosis reinforce that sorafenib does benefit appro-
priately selected Medicare patients and that its use should be
restrictedtopatientswhoseclinicalcharacteristicsbettermatch
those of patients in whom sorafenib has demonstrated benefit.
There are several key limitations of our estimate of
sorafenib’s effectiveness based on the observational study design,
the most crucial of which is that unmeasured confounding
may be influencing the treatment effect estimate. In the case
of HCC, the extent of cirrhosis and performance status are such
importantprognosticfactorsthattheyareincludedinthemost
widely applied staging system [4]. Frailty is also of major
concern as a possible unmeasured confounder in this study in
older cancer patients. However, as we would anticipate

Sorafenib Effectiveness in Advanced HCC
 by guest on June 4, 2019

Downloaded from 
 patients with more advanced liver disease and frailty would
be less likely to receive sorafenib and to be more likely to
experience early death, we would anticipate that much of the
unmeasuredconfoundingwouldhavebiasedtheresultsinfavor
of better outcomes in the sorafenib group. The data source
also limits the generalizability of our estimate of sorafenib
effectiveness. Although we did include patients eligible for
Medicare on the basis of disability (22% of the cohort was
age,65years),ourresultsmaynotbegeneralizabletoayounger,
privately insured population.
Yet,evenifourresultsdonotapplytoallnewlydiagnosed
patients with HCC, they demonstrate that the results of the
SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials do not describe the experience
of sorafenib in all patients with advanced HCC. The recently
published American Society of Clinical Oncology Value
Framework recommends evaluating the clinical benefit
(a composite of clinical efficacy and toxicity) against the drug
acquisition cost and patient copay [23]. When this exercise is
performed with the data from the SHARP trial (Fig. 4), the
net health benefit of sorafenib is only 12 of 130 possible
points (32 for a 35% improvement in survival, 220 for a
substantially less well-tolerated drug, 0 bonus points). The
Value Framework recommends displaying these 12 net
health benefitpointsalongsidethe drugacquisitioncost,which

 was on average $10,811 for a 30-day supply across Medicare
part D plans in 2014 [24]. So although these Value Framework
worksheets are intended to be subject to individual interpre-
tation regardingthe value ofeven smallnethealth benefit scores,
it is clear that even in the best-case scenario some patients might
reasonably question the value of sorafenib.
CONCLUSION
The lack of treatment alternatives and oral mode of admin-
istration may make it more attractive to prescribe sorafenib
outside the narrow clinical characteristics in which it does in
fact offer survival benefit, yet less fit patients and those with
more advanced liver disease should be cautioned that sorafenib
likely affords them no net health benefit.
