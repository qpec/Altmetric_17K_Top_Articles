vitamin C concentrations in a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
with Ester-C®

Abstract 
Background: Rapid uptake of vitamin C into blood and retention in tissues are important indicators of the efficacy of 
vitamin C supplementation and its immune-supporting role. The objective of this study was to evaluate the bioavail-
ability of vitamin C in plasma (reflective of recent intake) and leukocytes (reflective of tissue stores and influences on 
immune function) from a novel vitamin C formulation, Ester-C®.
Methods: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Thirty-six subjects, 18–60 years of age, 
were randomized to receive placebo (PL, 0 mg vitamin C), ascorbic acid (AA, 1000 mg vitamin C), and Ester-C® (EC, 
1000 mg vitamin C). Plasma and leukocyte vitamin C were measured baseline and at 2, 4, 8 and 24 h postdose.
Results: The concentration and percent change from baseline in plasma were significantly higher with EC at all time 
points when compared to PL. No significant differences between EC and AA were observed in plasma concentration. 
Maximum plasma concentration was higher for EC compared to AA (P = 0.039) and PL (P < 0.001). Plasma area under 
the curve (AUC0–24h) was higher for EC (P < 0.001) compared to PL. The concentration change from baseline in leuko-
cyte vitamin C was increased with EC at 24 h post-dose (P = 0.036) while no significant within-group changes were 
observed in AA or PL at any time point. The percent change in leukocyte vitamin C concentration was higher for EC at 
8 and 24 h compared to AA (P = 0.028 and P = 0.034, respectively) and PL (P = 0.042 and P = 0.036, respectively).
Conclusions: A single dose of EC resulted in favorable percent change in leukocyte vitamin C concentration com-
pared to AA and PL, indicating EC is retained longer within leukocytes.

Background
Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin essential for human 
health. It provides antioxidant protection to plasma lipids 
(American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 1998; 
Hemila 1997; Van Straten and Josling 2002; Biesalski et al. 
2002) and is necessary for immune function (including 
leukocyte phagocytosis and chemotaxis), suppression of 
virus replication, and production of interferon (Hemila 
1997). It has been suggested that a major role of vitamin C 
in immunity is protecting immune cells against oxida-
tive stress generated during infections (Hemila 1997). To 
function as an effective antioxidant, vitamin C must be 
retained in the body at relatively high levels. While many 
mammals can produce vitamin C (Kasa 1983; Institute 
of Medicine 2000), humans do not have gulonolactone 
oxidase, which is the enzyme required for vitamin C bio-
synthesis, and therefore must obtain vitamin C from the 
diet (Nishikimi et al. 1994). Though normally found rich 
in fresh fruits and vegetables, amounts consumed may

be lower than desired due to insufficient intakes and the 
lability of vitamin C with cooking and storage (Levine 
et al. 1999; Schleicher et al. 2009). Furthermore, envi-
ronmental stressors, such as alcohol consumption and 
smoking, also require higher vitamin C consumption 
(Schectman 1993; Gueguen et al. 2003).
Consumption of dietary vitamin C supplements is an 
efficient way to increase vitamin C levels in the body 
when food sources do not meet needs. Previous studies 
have demonstrated that single gram-dose supplements 
produce transient peak plasma concentrations that are 
2–3 fold higher than what is achieved through consum-
ing 200–300 mg vitamin C throughout the day from food; 
in either case, plasma vitamin C concentrations typically 
return to steady state within 24 h after intake (Padayatty 
et al. 2004). Plasma vitamin C levels reflect the amount 
absorbed acutely from the digestive tract, but the efficacy 
of vitamin C largely hinges on whether it is absorbed and 
retained in cells and tissues, such as leukocytes. Both 
plasma and leukocyte vitamin C concentrations have 
been found to correlate with dietary intake of vitamin 
C (Jacob 1990); however, leukocyte vitamin C concen-
tration is considered to be a more accurate indicator of 
tissue vitamin C concentrations (Lee et al. 1982). Leuko-
cytes are able to maintain vitamin C concentrations sev-
eral times higher than plasma vitamin C and leukocytes 
may better reflect long-term dietary intakes of vitamin 
C (Bergsten et al. 1990; Evans et al. 1982). Accurately 
assessing vitamin C levels in leukocytes is important not 
only for determining tissue stores, but also because leu-
kocytes are vital in acute and chronic disease prevention 
and treatment. Phagocytes consume extracellular vita-
min C when activated during an immune challenge, caus-
ing plasma and leukocyte vitamin C concentrations to 
decline rapidly during an infection and/or stress (Stank-
ova et al. 1975). Furthermore, diseased populations, 
including patients with coronary artery disease (Winterg-
erst et al. 2006), type 1 (Ramirez and Flowers 1980) and 
type 2 (Akkus et al. 1996) diabetes mellitus, and asthma 
(Shidfar et al. 2005), have been reported to have reduced 
leukocyte vitamin C concentrations compared to healthy 
populations. Therefore, both plasma and leukocyte vita-
min C concentrations are important when evaluating the 
bioavailability of vitamin C.
Ester-C® (EC, NBTY, Inc., Ronkonkoma, NY, USA) is 
a form of vitamin C that contains calcium ascorbate and 
vitamin C metabolites, including dehydroascorbate, cal-
cium threonate, and 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-fura-
none. Compared to ascorbic acid (AA), the most common 
form of vitamin C, EC can be consumed by a wider range 
of individuals due to its neutralized pH which allows for 
supplementation at high doses with greater tolerability 
for people who are sensitive to acidic foods (Gruenwald 
et al. 2006; Ye et al. 2015). Evidence suggests that EC may 
also have a higher bioavailability. Studies show that pre-
incubation of cells with threonate results in a stimulated 
uptake of vitamin C in a dose-dependent manner (Fay 
et al. 1994; Fay and Verlangieri 1991). In rodents, higher 
plasma concentrations and less rapid excretion (Bush 
and Verlangieri 1987) as well as more available vitamin 
C activities (Verlangieri et al. 1991) have been observed 
in comparison with AA. Human studies comparing vita-
min C levels of EC and AA are not consistent in plasma 
(Moyad et al. 2008; Wright et al. 1990; Johnston and Luo 
1994; Pancorbo et al. 2008), but significantly higher leu-
kocyte vitamin C levels have been constantly observed 
with EC than AA in male subjects (unpublished observa-
tions) (Moyad et al. 2008; Wright and Kirk 1990).
To confirm and expand upon the results from previous 
clinical trials (unpublished observations) (Moyad et al. 
2008), the present study assessed the bioavailability and 
retention of vitamin C in plasma and leukocytes follow-
ing oral administration of AA, EC or placebo (PL) in male 
and female subjects. We hypothesize that vitamin C from 
EC is better retained in plasma and leukocytes compared 
to AA or PL.
Methods
Subjects
Forty subjects (20 male, 20 female) between 18 and 
60 years of age were enrolled in the study. The inclusion 
criteria comprised healthy subjects with a body mass 
index (BMI) of 18–30 kg/m2 who were non-smokers 
or who had stopped smoking for more than a year. Sub-
jects were excluded from the study if they were pregnant, 
breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during 
the course of the trial; had used prescription or over-the-
counter products known to interact with vitamin C within 
72 h of randomization and during the trial, such as aspi-
rin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alu-
minum containing antacids, and iron; had used proton 
pump inhibitors; had used multivitamins or other dietary 
supplements containing vitamin C within 7 days of ran-
domization and during the trial; had gastroesophageal 
reflux disease within the past 3 months; had a history of 
significant gastrointestinal disease or a history of malab-
sorption, or any other condition which, in the Investiga-
tor’s opinion, may have adversely affected the subject’s 
ability to complete the study or its measures or which 
posed significant risk to the subject. Additionally, subjects 
agreed to consume a low-vitamin C diet during the study.
Interventions
The investigational interventions (AA, EC, and PL) 
were stored at the study site in a locked, limited-access 
area at room temperature and were protected from light

until administration. For EC and AA, a single daily dose 
of vitamin C was 1000 mg (two tablets, each tablet con-
tained 500 mg vitamin C). PL tablets contained micro-
crystalline cellulose.
Study design
This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, crossover, 24-h bioavailability study conducted at 
a single site, KGK Synergize Inc., London, Ontario, Can-
ada. The study consisted of three 24-h test periods, each 
preceded by a 7-day washout period (Moyad et al. 2008) 
(Fig. 1). During the Screening Visit (Visit 1), subjects’ 
medical history and concomitant therapies were reviewed 
and eligibility was determined based on the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Height, weight, heart rate, and blood 
pressure were measured and BMI was calculated. For 
measures of general health status, blood samples were 
collected for hematology and clinical chemistry analysis.
This study was reviewed and approved by the Natural 
Health Products Directorate (NHPD), Health Canada, 
Ottawa, Ontario and Institutional Review Board Ser-
vices, Aurora, Ontario, Canada, and was conducted in 
accordance with the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(International Conference on Harmonization [ICH]) and 
ethical principles according to The Declaration of Hel-
sinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each 
subject. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(Identifier NCT01852903).
Subjects returned to the clinic for randomization and 
Test Period 1 (Visit 2). The Investigator was provided 
with two randomization lists (one for male subjects and 
one for female subjects), indicating the order of randomi-
zation to treatment sequence. Each enrolled subject was 
assigned a randomization code according to the respec-
tive randomization list. Each list was prepared using ten 
blocks of two, with subjects randomized to treatment 
sequence (Fig. 2) in a 1:1 ratio. The Investigator was pro-
vided with sealed envelopes for each randomization code, 
which was to remain sealed for the duration of the study 
unless an emergency necessitated unblinding by the 
investigator. Products were packaged for each individual 
subject, coded with a randomization number, labeled 
“Treatment 1, 2 or 3”
, and administered at Visits 2, 4, and 
6, respectively. All tablets were similar in shape, size and 
color to ensure adequate blinding of both subject and 
investigator.
On the first day of each Test Period (Visits 2, 4 and 6), 
fasting blood samples were collected prior to treatment 
administration. Immediately after blood collection and 
just before breakfast, subjects were given two tablets 
according to their sequence allocation (Fig. 1). Treatments 
were administered in the presence of clinic personnel to 
ensure compliance. Subjects remained at the clinic for 
post-dose blood samples taken at 2, 4, and 8 h. Meanwhile, 
subjects were provided with standardized low-vitamin C 
meals (Table 1) for breakfast and lunch during the first 8 h 
of blood sampling, and the food consumed at each meal 
was recorded. Subjects were allowed to leave the clinic 
upon completion of blood sampling. Subjects returned the 
next day for the 24-h blood collection (Visits 3, 5, and 7). 
Subjects were counseled and provided with a list of low-
vitamin C foods to be consumed while away from the 
clinic during Test Periods and during the washout peri-
ods. Subjects completed food records and submitted them 
at Visits 3, 5 and 7 to ensure adherence to a low-vitamin 
C diet. Additionally, each subject was required to record 
their dietary intake for 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day dur-
ing each 7-day washout period. Subjects were also advised 
to refrain from consuming caffeine and alcohol during 
Test Periods. At the end of the study (after Visit 7), sub-
jects were advised to return to their normal diet.
Measurements
Blood samples collected at baseline (0 h) and 2, 4, 8 and 
24 h post-dose were analyzed for the pharmacokinetics of 
plasma and leukocyte vitamin C. Blood was collected in 
a 6 mL sodium heparin tube (BD Vacutainer, Missisagua, 
Ontario) and inverted several times to ensure complete 
mixture of blood and anti-coagulant. The tube was cen-
trifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 3000 rpm to separate the

plasma and buffy coat layers. The following parameters 
were assessed: area under the curve (AUC0–24h), maxi-
mum observed concentration (Cmax), time of maximum 
concentration (Tmax), mean and percent changes of vita-
min C from baseline (0 h) in plasma and leukocytes.
Plasma vitamin C measurements
A 0.5 mL aliquot of plasma was transferred to a stor-
age vial containing an equal amount of 10 % meta-
phosphoric acid with 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid (EDTA), covered with foil, frozen at −40 °C, and 
then stored at ≤−15 °C until analysis. The sample was 
allowed to thaw at room temperature and 100uL plasma 
was added to 100 μL of cold 10 % (1:1; v/v) perchloric 
acid (PCA) containing 1 % mPA (1/v). The mixture was 
vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 
RPM. 500 μL of mobile phase was added, the mixture 
was vortexed and centrifuged again, and 20 μL of the 
supernatant was introduced into high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) for analysis of vitamin C with 
UV absorbance at 245 nm (Rumelin et al. 1999).
Leukocyte vitamin C measurements
The buffy coat layer was transferred to 2 mL cryovials 
and stored at −40 °C until analysis. A 500 µL aliquot was 
taken and 500 µL of 10 % PCA with 1 % metaphosphoric 
acid (MPA) was added. The mixture was vortexed in foil 
for 1 min. 500 µL of mobile phase was added and the 
mixture was vortexed for another minute and centrifuged 
for 10 min at 12,000 RPM. 20 µL supernatant was intro-
duced into HPLC for analysis (Emadi-Konjin et al. 2005).
Statistical analysis
The sample size calculated for this study was based on 
the article by Moyad et al. (2008). With a conservative 
standard deviation of 70 and 20 % attrition rate, 40 sub-
jects were determined necessary for 80 % power at the 
5 % level of significance.

Baseline comparisons among treatment sequences were 
analyzed using Chi square test for categorical variables and 
unpaired t test for continuous variables. AUC0–24h, Cmax 
and mean concentration in plasma and leukocytes were 
corrected from baseline and the comparisons were per-
formed on log-transformed data. To minimize substantial 
variability, outliers in the data set were imputed with the 
mean value for each time point in each study arm. An out-
lier was defined as a number that deviated by three standard 
deviations from the mean. The AUC0–24h, Cmax, Tmax, mean 
and percent changes from baseline were compared among 
groups using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by 
Dunnett’s test to determine differences between EC and 
other treatment groups. Within-group changes were com-
pared using paired t test. SAS Version 9.1 was used to 
perform the statistical analysis and statistically significant 
difference was determined at 0.05. Subjects that were com-
pliant with the protocol were included in the per-protocol 
(PP) analysis, which is presented and discussed here.
Results
Subjects
A total of 60 subjects were screened and 40 eligible sub-
jects were randomized. Of these, 30 were included in the 
PP analysis (Fig. 2). There were no significant differences 
in the demographics and baseline characteristics between 
the two treatment sequences in terms of age, weight, 
BMI, gender and baseline vitamin C status (Table 2). No 
premature unblinding occurred during the study.
Plasma vitamin C
Concentration and percent changes in plasma
The mean concentration and percent changes in plasma 
from baseline were significantly higher with EC at all 
time points (P = 0.007 for percent change at 24 h, all 
others P < 0.001) when compared to the PL condition 
(Fig. 3a, b). Changes from baseline were similar for EC 
and AA in plasma, with the peak change occurring at 4 h; 
and no significant differences between the two groups 
were observed at any time point (Fig. 3c, d). Compared to 
baseline, significant increases (P < 0.001) in mean plasma 
vitamin C concentration and percent change were seen at 
2, 4, 8, and 24 h for EC and AA but not for PL (Fig. 3).
Cmax, AUC0–24h, and Tmax in plasma
Cmax was significantly higher with EC (7.73 ± 3.12 µg/
mL) compared to the PL (1.83 ± 2.07 µg/mL, 
P < 0.001) and AA (6.37 ± 2.26 µg/mL, P = 0.039) 
(Fig. 4a, b). The AUC0–24h was significantly higher 
with EC (85.01 ± 42.39 µg h/mL) compared to PL 
(−5.01 ± 49.47 µg h/mL, P < 0.001) but not when com-
pared to the AA condition (73.15 ± 40.68 µg h/mL) 
(Fig. 4c, d). There were no statistical differences in Tmax 
between groups (Fig. 4e, f).
Leukocyte vitamin C
Concentration and percent changes in leukocytes
The mean concentration change from baseline in leukocyte 
vitamin C was significantly increased with EC at 24 h post-
dose (P = 0.036, Fig. 5a, b). No significant within-group 
changes were observed in PL (Fig. 5a) or AA (Fig. 5b) at 
any time point. The mean changes in leukocyte vitamin C 
were numerically higher with EC at 2, 4, 8 and 24 h com-
pared to PL, and at 8 and 24 h compared to AA but did not 
reach statistical significance (Fig. 5a, b, respectively).
The percent concentration change from baseline in 
leukocyte vitamin C was significantly higher with EC at 
8 and 24 h compared to PL (P = 0.042 and P = 0.036, 
respectively, Fig. 5c) and AA (P = 0.028 and P = 0.034, 
respectively, Fig. 5d). The within-group percent change 
from baseline in leukocyte vitamin C concentration sig-
nificantly increased with EC at 4, 8, and 24 h post dose 
(P = 0.040, P = 0.013, and P = 0.001, respectively) 
(Fig. 5c, d). No significant within-group changes were 
observed with AA or PL.

PL, n = 1). Notably, none of the adverse events were 
assessed to be related to the investigational products.
Discussion
This crossover study examined vitamin C bioavailability 
and retention following a single oral administration of 
1000 mg vitamin C provided by EC or AA as measured 
in plasma and leukocyte vitamin C concentrations. As 
expected, plasma vitamin C increased significantly from 
baseline at all time points when subjects were given EC 
and AA, but not when given PL. There was no significant 
difference in plasma vitamin C change between EC and 
AA, but significantly higher plasma Cmax was observed 
when subjects consumed EC compared to AA. EC lead to 
a sustained retention of leukocyte vitamin C during the 
investigational period, with percent changes from base-
line that were significantly higher at 8 and 24 h post-dose 
compared to AA or PL. In contrast, AA resulted in poor 
leukocyte vitamin C retention, as indicated by a peak at

versus ascorbic acid. Data are mean ± standard error. Significant differences are indicated: *P < 0.001, Ester-C® versus placebo; **P = 0.039, Ester-C®

4 h postdose with a subsequent decline to baseline con-
centrations by 8 h. Additionally, the percent change in 
leukocyte vitamin C from baseline was significant at 
4, 8, and 24 h with EC, while there were no significant 
increases with AA or PL. Area under the leukocyte con-
centration time curve was highest for EC and was 9 times 
higher than AA; however, values did not reach statistical 
significance due to subject variability.
Our study confirms that vitamin C from EC is more 
bioavailable in leukocytes than AA for male and female 
nonsmokers. These results are consistent with previ-
ous studies (unpublished observations) (Moyad et al. 
2008; Wright and Kirk 1990). The most recent clinical 
trial found increased leukocyte vitamin C concentra-
tions following a daily dose of 1000 mg vitamin C from 
EC compared to AA in healthy men (Moyad et al. 2008). 
Another double-blind, crossover trial with the same dose 
reported similar results (unpublished observations). A 
third trial found increased vitamin C leukocyte concen-
tration at 8 and 24 h and also after 7–10 days of continu-
ous ingestion of 3000 mg vitamin C as EC compared to 
AA (Wright and Kirk 1990). All three previous trials were 
done in men. To our knowledge, the present study is the 
first clinical trial comparing leukocyte vitamin C con-
centrations after EC and AA treatment in both male and 
female subjects. With the inclusion of female subjects, 
there is concern for a fluctuation in vitamin C concentra-
tion correlated with changing hormone levels throughout 
the menstrual cycle (Michos et al. 2006). To control for 
this potential variability, the trial was designed so that 
eumenorrheic women had 28 days between Test Periods, 
and vitamin C levels could be measured during the same 
phase of their menstrual cycles. Unexpectedly, only post-
menopausal women were randomized, eliminating con-
cerns about cyclic fluctuations.
Our study results also confirm that plasma vitamin C 
concentrations are tightly regulated; plasma vitamin C 
concentration with EC and AA had similar patterns, with 
an abrupt increase during the first 4 h and a peak at 4 h 
post-dose. Similarly, others have reported no difference 
in plasma vitamin C concentrations after a single dose 
of 1000 mg vitamin C given in the form of EC or AA in 
men (Moyad et al. 2008; Pancorbo et al. 2008). Interest-
ingly, using a three-fold higher dose (3000 mg per day), 
Wright and Kirk (1990) found a higher serum vitamin 
C level when EC was consumed compared to AA, while

Johnston and Luo (1994) reported a lower plasma vita-
min C level when given a much lower EC dose (500 mg 
vitamin C per day). The latter study had a majority of 
female subjects under the age of 42 year with no evidence 
of controlling for vitamin C fluctuations during the men-
strual cycle; in addition, subjects were pre-treated for 
two weeks with 1000 mg of vitamin C per day to saturate 
body stores before they entered the study, while no other 
studies used vitamin-C saturated subjects (Johnston and 
Luo 1994). From the evidence above, a dose–response 
curve may exist—a mega dose of EC, such as 3000 mg, 
may result in greater vitamin C concentration in plasma 
compared to AA, while 1000 mg of EC does not lead to a 
significant difference. Further studies are needed to clar-
ify this dose–response relationship.
Under physiological conditions, vitamin C exists as 
both ascorbate (reduced form) and dehydroascorbate 
(DHA, oxidized form). It has been suggested that vita-
min C is predominantly taken up by leukocytes in the 
form of DHA via a passive, energy-independent, gradi-
ent-driven process (Li and Schellhorn 2007). This gradi-
ent is influenced by the initial oxidation of vitamin C into 
DHA and the subsequent reduction into AA after entry 
into the cell. This allows leukocytes to store vitamin C at 
higher concentrations than those seen in plasma (Paday-
atty et al. 2007), which is important for proper cellular 
function (Bergsten et al. 1990). The vitamin C metabo-
lites found in EC, generated after oxidation to DHA, 
are thought to further stabilize the extracellular oxida-
tion and metabolism of DHA and/or enhance the pas-
sive, facilitated or active transport signaling mechanisms 
required for intracellular access (Moyad et al. 2008). Past 
research has indicated that the metabolites in EC help 
with the transport and utilization of vitamin C (Fay and 
Verlangieri 1991; Fay et al. 1994; Bush and Verlangieri 
1987).
The increased retention of vitamin C in leukocytes 
is conducive to providing maximum cellular concen-
trations of vitamin C for optimum biochemical activ-
ity, including immune function. In a study with two 
groups of non-ascorbate synthesizing rats, EC fed 
animals showed higher vitamin C activity and body 
weight gain compared to the group fed AA (Ver-
langieri et al. 1991). In humans, the fundamental pro-
cesses of leukocytes, especially neutrophil phagocytic 
capacity, can be depressed when leukocytes are low in 
vitamin C, however, repletion with vitamin C can help 
restore these important functions (Jayachandran et al. 
2000). Diminished neutrophil function in subjects 
with furunculosis was improved following supplemen-
tation with 1000 mg vitamin C for 4–6 weeks, includ-
ing increased neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis 
(Levy et al. 1996). Enhancement of neutrophil motility, 
chemotaxis and phagocytosis has been observed 
after the ingestion of 250–3000 mg vitamin C in both 
healthy and diseased adults (Levy et al. 1996; Ander-
son et al. 1980). To our knowledge, only one published 
clinical trial has reported the disease treatment roles 
of EC—the study showed that compared to placebo, 
EC (1000 mg of vitamin C per day) can significantly 
reduce colds and shorten the duration of severe symp-
toms in winter over a 60-day period (Van Straten and 
Josling 2002). Further studies are needed to better 
understand how the level of vitamin C in leukocytes 
affects neutrophil function and is associated with dis-
ease prevention and treatment. The leukocyte vitamin 
C concentrations reported in our study can serve as 
future reference values.
While the current study did not measure urinary excre-
tion of vitamin C, previous research is inconsistent. 
Wright et al. reported less urinary loss with 3000 mg of 
vitamin C from EC in the first 24 h and after 7–10 days 
of continuous ingestion when compared to AA (Wright 
and Kirk 1990). However, these results are not consistent 
with another study which found similar urinary excre-
tion from EC and AA when only 500 mg of vitamin C 
was consumed daily (Johnston and Luo 1994). The latter 
study did not measure vitamin C levels in tissues, so it is 
possible that more vitamin C from EC moved into tissues 
(such as leukocytes) and thus yielded similar urinary loss 
and less plasma vitamin C when compared to AA (John-
ston and Luo 1994).
There are a few limitations to our study. There was 
an observed variability in subjects’ vitamin C levels. 
Baseline plasma and leukocyte vitamin C concentra-
tions showed a large standard deviation between sub-
jects at study entry (Table 2); however, not significantly 
different between groups. This was anticipated as these 
values are dependent on many non-modifiable and modi-
fiable factors (Li and Schellhorn 2007). To address this, 
measures were taken during this study to minimize the 
variability by using a crossover design, enrolling only 
non-smokers, providing meals during test periods and 
intensely counseling subjects to eliminate dietary vita-
min C. The change from baseline and percent change 
from baseline in plasma and leukocyte vitamin C for each 
individual subject provided a more accurate assessment 
of the pharmacokinetics of the treatments. Further, we 
measured vitamin C levels after a single bolus dose. As 
shown in a previous trial, vitamin C concentrations in 
leukocytes were significantly higher at 8 and 24 h when 
treated with EC and the significant difference continued 
after 7–10 days of vitamin C consumption at 3000 mg 
(Wright and Kirk 1990). Future studies should investigate 
a continuous ingestion of various sources of vitamin C at 
a lower daily dose.

Conclusions
In conclusion, EC significantly increased leukocyte vita-
min C levels compared to AA and PL. This may be due 
to the metabolites in EC, which have been shown to 
facilitate absorption and enhance retention. The supe-
rior bioavailability of EC in leukocytes may be beneficial 
to overall immune function since intracellular vitamin C 
levels are vital to the fundamental process of leukocytes. 
More studies are needed to better understand how EC is 
associated with disease prevention and treatment.
