Abstract
Background
Oil and gas development emits known hematological carcinogens, such as benzene, and
increasingly occurs in residential areas. We explored whether residential proximity to oil and
gas development was associated with risk for hematologic cancers using a registry-based
case-control study design.
Methods
Participants were 0–24 years old, living in rural Colorado, and diagnosed with cancer
between 2001–2013. For each child in our study, we calculated inverse distance weighted
(IDW) oil and gas well counts within a 16.1-kilometer radius of residence at cancer diagnosis
for each year in a 10 year latency period to estimate density of oil and gas development.
Logistic regression, adjusted for age, race, gender, income, and elevation was used to esti-
mate associations across IDW well count tertiles for 87 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)
cases and 50 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases, compared to 528 controls with non-
hematologic cancers.
Findings
Overall, ALL cases 0–24 years old were more likely to live in the highest IDW well count ter-
tiles compared to controls, but findings differed substantially by age. For ages 5–24, ALL
cases were 4.3 times as likely to live in the highest tertile, compared to controls (95% CI: 1.1
to 16), with a monotonic increase in risk across tertiles (trend p-value = 0.035). Further
adjustment for year of diagnosis increased the association. No association was found
between ALL for children aged 0–4 years or NHL and IDW well counts. While our study
benefited from the ability to select cases and controls from the same population, use of can-
cer-controls, the limited number of ALL and NHL cases, and aggregation of ages into five
year ranges, may have biased our associations toward the null. In addition, absence of

 information on O&G well activities, meteorology, and topography likely reduced temporal
and spatial specificity in IDW well counts.
Conclusion
Because oil and gas development has potential to expose a large population to known
hematologic carcinogens, further study is clearly needed to substantiate both our positive
and negative findings. Future studies should incorporate information on oil and gas develop-
ment activities and production levels, as well as levels of specific pollutants of interest (e.g.
benzene) near homes, schools, and day care centers; provide age-specific residential histo-
ries; compare cases to controls without cancer; and address other potential confounders,
and environmental stressors.
Introduction
Among U.S. children ages 0–14, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most commonly
diagnosed cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common lymphoma [1].
While ALL and NHL mortality rates in U.S. children are declining due to improved treatment,
ALL and NHL incidence rates have increased by about 1% and 0.6% per year, respectively,
between 2000 and 2010 [2, 3].
A number of factors, including genetic predisposition and susceptibility, as well as environ-
mental factors, come together in the development of childhood cancers through a two step
process, the first of which likely occurs in utero [4]. Environmental factors that may be associ-
ated with ALL include in-utero and postnatal exposures to vehicle exhaust fumes [5, 6], polycy-
clic aromatic hydrocarbons [7,8], and chemicals including benzene and other hydrocarbons
[8–11]. Environmental factors that may be associated with NHL include benzene exposures
[12].
U.S. oil and gas development has grown rapidly over the past 15 years. This industrial activ-
ity, which includes drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and production, has the potential to emit
chemicals that may be associated with childhood ALL and/or NHL, including benzene and
other hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and diesel exhaust, into the air and
water [13–18]. The use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has facilitated extraction
of petroleum reserves from shale and other tight formations, resulting in an extensive de-cen-
tralized dispersion of oil and gas wells and associated facilities across populated areas [19].
This has the potential to expose a large populaton to oil and gas development related pollut-
ants. It is estimated that over 15.3 million Americans now live within 1.6 kilometers of an oil
and gas well drilled since the year 2000 [19]. In Colorado’s most intensive areas of oil and gas
development, there may be hundreds of oil and gas wells within 1.6 kilometers of a home. The
existing literature indicates that populations living in areas with oil and gas development may
be at an increased risk for health effects, including cancers such as ALL and NHL, resulting
from these exposures [20].
Previous ecological studies on the link between childhood cancer and oil and gas develop-
ment are inconclusive because they aggregated cancer outcomes and exposures and did not
consider latency periods and differentiate between types of leukemias [21, 22]. This analysis
addresses these limitations by comparing individual-level residence of incident cancer cases to
geocoded oil and gas well locations over a 10-year latency period using a registry based case-
control approach to explore if children living near oil and gas development may be at higher

 risk for childhood ALL and NHL compared to children diagnosed with non-hematologic
malignancies and to inform the design of more comprehensive studies.
Methods
Study population
Childhood incidence cancer data for children diagnosed with cancer between 2001 and 2013
were obtained from the Colorado Central Cancer Registry (CCCR) [23] held at the Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). Our study population consisted of
975 children in the registry diagnosed with cancer at ages 0–24 years, and residing in rural Col-
orado at the time of diagnosis. Subjects aged 15–24 years were included in the study to account
for a possible 10 year latency period between childhood exposures before the age of 15 and
onset of cancer [24–27]. We restricted analysis to cancers occurring from 2001–2013 to focus
our analysis on growth of hydraulic fracturing and/or directional drilling, which expanded
rapidly in Colorado beginning around the year 2000 [28]. This rapid expansion resulted in a
twofold increase in active oil and gas wells in Colorado between 2000 and 2013; by 2013, Colo-
rado had more than 51,000 oil and gas wells. We restricted the study area to rural areas and
towns with populations of <50,000 in 57 counties to reduce potential for exposure to other
pollution sources, such as traffic, and other industrial sources. Geocoded precise addresses
were not available for 232 children (including 17 and 15 children diagnosed with ALL and
NHL, respectively), so those children were excluded from the study (e.g., addresses not listed,
specified as rural routes, or only as post office boxes). Using the final study group of 743 chil-
dren, we conducted two separate registry-based case control studies to explore associations
between childhood hematologic cancers and density of oil and gas development operations
around the child’s residence. Cases were children with ALL or NHL. Because we only had
access to records in the CCCR for this exploratory study, controls were all children registered
in the CCCR with a non-hematologic cancer, as has been done in previous registry based stud-
ies [29–32].
Exposure to oil and gas wells
We used information available in the publically accessible Colorado Oil and Gas Information
System (COGIS) [33] to build a geocoded dataset with latitude and longitude coordinates of
oil and gas wells in rural Colorado, and determined whether or not each well was active for
each year between 1991 and 2013, as defined by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Com-
mission (COGCC) [28] (see S1 Table). The COGCC considers oil and gas wells to be active
between the spud-in and abandon dates. “Spud-in” is the operation of drilling the first part of
a new well; “abandon” is the permanent plugging of a well [28]. No spud-date is recorded for
28% of oil and gas wells in the COGIS. If a spud-in date was not available for a well, we used
the earliest date available from other oil and gas activities which follow the spud-in (e.g., com-
pletion, first production, and treatment dates) to designate the beginning of the active well
period. We provided this dataset of geocoded well locations to CDPHE staff.
To protect the identity of the children in the study, CDPHE staff linked the well locations in
the dataset we provided to each child’s address in the registry. Geocoded residential addresses
at time of cancer diagnosis were linked to active well locations in the year of diagnosis, as well
as active well locations in each of the 10 years preceding the cancer diagnosis. Distance of each
residence from all active oil and gas wells within a 16.1-kilometer radius was then computed
using spherically-adjusted straight line distances, to account for the Earth’s curvature. Ages
were truncated into five year ranges (0–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, and 20–24 years) to further pro-
tect identity. The CDPHE staff then provided the analyst (LMM) with a de-identified dataset,

 containing subject diagnosis, age group, gender, race/ethnicity, income quintile at zip code
level, residential elevation, maternal smoking history (from linkages with birth certificates),
and distance to each active oil and gas well within a 16.1-kilometer radius.
Because the number of wells is not associated with distance of the nearest well in the
16.1-kilometer radius around a child’s home (Fig 1), we used an inverse distance weighted
(IDW) approach to estimate the density of oil and gas wells surrounding a child’s home. The
IDW approach is commonly used to estimate individual air pollutant exposures from multiple
fixed locations [34–36]. Annual IDW well counts account for the number of active wells within
the 16.1-kilometer radius [36, 37] of the residence in a specific year as well as distance of each
well from the residence, giving greater weight to wells closest to the residence. For example, an
IDW well count of 78.1 wells per kilometer could be computed from 125 wells each located 1.6
kilometers from the maternal residence or 25 wells each located 0.32 kilometers from the
child’s residence.
Based on the latency period between exposure to benzene and diagnosis of leukemia of 1 to
10 years [24–27], we computed weighted average IDW well counts (referred to herein as IDW
well count) over a 10 year period to capture IDW wells counts during the antenatal period and
childhood. Because we had age ranges rather than specific ages, we averaged the annual IDW
well count over a temporal range that would capture the latency period for five age categories as
follows. For children aged 0–4 years, annual IDW well counts for 1–5 years prior to diagnosis

 were averaged over 5 years. For children aged 5–9, 10–14 and 15–19 years, annual IDW well
counts for 1–10 years prior to diagnosis were averaged over 10 years. For young adults 20–24
years, annual IDW well counts 6–10 years prior to diagnosis were averaged over 5 years to
account for childhood exposures (i.e., occurring prior to age fifteen). If no wells existed within
16.1-kilometers of a child’s home during the latency period for each age range, the weighted
average IDW well count was 0. The final distribution of the non-zero IDW well counts was then
divided into tertiles (low, medium, and high) for subsequent logistic regression. Each tertile was
compared to the referent group of an IDW well count of zero.
Analysis
Childhood cancer outcomes considered for analysis were ALL (first primary tumor, includes
Burkitt leukemia) (87 cases), and NHL nodal and extra-nodal (includes Burkitt and lympho-
blastic lymphomas regardless of bone marrow involvement) (50 cases). The number of cases
for other types of leukemia (<15 cases for each type including acute myeloid leukemia, and 26
cases combined) was too small to analyze individually. Cases diagnosed with other leukemia
types (n = 26) and those with Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 52) were excluded from the control
group. Case-control analyses were conducted separately for ALL and NHL. A total of 528 con-
trols for each of these cancer outcomes included all children reported in the CCCR with non-
hematologic cancers, (Table 1).
Statistical analysis
We used logistic regression to study associations between case-control status and IDW well
count tertiles. First, we estimated the crude odds ratio (OR) associated with IDW well counts
tertiles. We further investigated associations by adjusting for potential confounders, as well as
child covariates, based on a priori knowledge of their association with both exposure and out-
come. We conducted tests to evaluate linear trends in binominal proportions with increasing
IDW well count by treating the categorical IDW well count variable as ordinal [38]. Specifi-
cally, covariates in our analysis were age category (0–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–19, and 20–24 years)
[1,4], race/ethnicity (white Hispanic, white non-Hispanic, non-white) [1], and gender [1].
Because the age range 0–4 years and �5 years may respresent two distinct disease etiologies
for ALL [4], we analyzed separately for children ages 0–4 years and � 5 years. We adjusted for
elevation of residence (< 2743 meters, � 2743 meters because residential solar ultraviolet radi-
ation exposure, which increases with elevation [39], may be associcated with ALL [40]. We
also adjusted for socio-economic status by distributing zip-code level median income into
quintiles (0–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 percentiles) [5]. In a second model, we fur-
ther adjusted for year of cancer diagnosis (2001–2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008,
2009–20110, 2011–2013). We did not adjust for maternal smoking during pregnancy in the
primary analyses because information on maternal smoking was missing for 59% of the study
population. We report estimations for each outcome associated with the IDW well count ter-
tile (low, medium, and high) compared to no wells within 16.1-kilometers with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI). We considered both the statistical significance of the association for each
IDW well count category as well as the trend across categories in evaluating results, using a
2-sided alpha of 0.05.
In secondary analyses, we explored reducing IDW well counts to an 8-kilometer buffer
around the maternal residence, as well as analyzing the subset of subjects with information on
maternal smoking and adjusting for maternal smoking during pregnancy. All statistical analy-
ses were conducted using SAS1 software version 9.3 (Cary, NC). To further protect the iden-
tity of study participants we truncated counts of less than 5 to “<5” in result tables. The

 Both crude and adjusted estimates indicate an increase in odds of living near oil and gas
development at the time of cancer diagnosis, as represented by IDW well counts, in children
diagnosed with ALL (Table 4; see S2 and S3 Tables for the full logistic models). Overall, chil-
dren aged 0–24 years diagnosed with ALL were more than 2 times as likely as controls to live
in areas with active oil and gas wells within 16.1-kilometers of their residence during the
latency period (p for trend = 0.22) after adjusting for age, race, gender, income, and elevation
in model 1. Children aged 5–24 years diagnosed with ALL were 4.3 (95% CI: 1.1 to 16) times
as likely as controls to live in the highest IDW well count tertile, and a monotonic increase
across the IDW well count tertiles was observed (p for trend = 0.035) (Table 4). Further adjust-
ment for year of diagnosis in model 2 resulted in slightly larger associations. We observed no
statistically significant association between ALL and proximity to oil and gas development in
our analysis of ALL for children ages 0–4 years in either model.
In secondary analyses using an 8-kilometer radius, results for cases of ALL ages 5–24 years
and ages 0–4 years were similar to the primary analysis (S4 Table). In secondary analyses on
the subset of children for whom information on maternal smoking was available, we observed
similar associations to our primary analysis, with little evidence for confounding by maternal
smoking history (S5 Table).
We observed no statistically significant associations between density of oil and gas develop-
ment and NHL in either model, based on trend analysis across categorical IDW well counts

 (Table 5) (see S6 and S7 Tables for the full logistic models). The observed outcomes for NHL
from the analyses using an 8-kilometer radius or in the subsets of subjects with information on
maternal smoking did not change the inferences drawn from the primary analysis (see S8 and
S9 Tables).
Discussion
In this registry-based case-control study, we found that children aged 5–24 years diagnosed
with ALL were 3–4 times as likely to live in areas with active oil and gas wells as were children
diagnosed with non-hematologic cancers, and the association between ALL and residential
density of oil and gas wells increased monotonically from the lowest to highest IDW well
count categories after adjusting for age, race, gender, socioeconomic status, and elevation. Fur-
ther adjustment for year of cancer diagnosis resulted in a slightly larger association in children
aged 5–24 years. We did not observe an association between ALL and density of active oil and
gas wells in children aged 0–4 years. We found no indication of an association between NHL
and density of active oil and gas wells.
In model 2, we categorized year of cancer diagnosis into six categories each containing two
to three diagnosis years (Table 2). We note that if diagnosis year is not aggregated into six cate-
gories, the association in children aged 5–24 years attenuates to 3.6 (CI: 0.93, 14) and the p-
value for the trend is 0.056 (S10 Table). Aggregating diagnosis year results in 13 categories, sev-
eral of which have <5 observations. In a small data set such as the data set for the 5–24 year
age group, minor changes to subsets of the data with < 5 observations can easily lead to p-val-
ues switching from 0.03 to 0.06 or vice-versa. We selected the model with diagnosis year cate-
gorized into six categories because it is the more robust model.
Our analysis addressed the limitations of previous studies. The case-control design allowed
us to evaluate individual outcomes and IDW well counts; and we considered a 1–10 year
latency period and one specific type of childhood leukemia, rather that grouping all leukemias,
in our analysis. An ecological study on childhood cancer incidence associated with hydraulic
fracturing sites in Pennsylvania found no differences between childhood leukemia incidence
before and after hydraulic fracturing began in several Pennylvania counties [21]. That study
aggregated all leukemia cases at the county level, and did not fully consider a latency period
[41]. An ecological study in Texas aggregated cases at the zip-code level, finding higher child-
hood ALL incidence rates than expected in two zip codes with oil and gas development, but
that difference was not statistically significant with only 11 cases [22].

 It is thought that less than 5% of leukemia is attributed to only inherited genetic predisposi-
tion [4]; that genetic suscectibility and environmental factors combine in the development of
ALL [4]; and that the etiology of infant ALL (<1 year) may differ from that of childhood ALL
[42, 43]. Most infant ALL may develop through a one step process, the intiation of preleukemic
clone involving MLL gene rearrangement at 11q23 in utero [4, 42–44]. Childhood ALL is
thought to develop through a two step process [4, 43, 44], in which the first step also occurs in
utero, with initiation of a preleukemic clone most often involving other gene rearrangments
(e.g., TEL_AML rearrangements) [4, 42, 45]. The role played by chance versus other factors in
the generation of in-utero preleukmeic clones in both infant and childhood ALL is unclear [4].
The second step for childhood ALL, which possibly involves an interaction between genetic
suscectibiltiy and environmental factors post-utero, converts the preleukemic clone to leuke-
mia [4,42, 46]. This two step process may partially explain why we observed stronger associa-
tions between ALL and density of oil and gas development when we evaluated children ages 5
to 24 years than among those ages 0–4 years, which includes infant ALL.
One possible environmental risk factor for childhood ALL that is associated with oil and
gas development is exposure to benzene and other petroleum hydrocarbons. Ambient air ben-
zene levels in Colorado areas with active oil and gas development ranged from 0.03–22 parts
per billion by volume (ppbv). Median benzene concentrations ranged from 0.212–0.757 ppbv
which are greater than the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) risk based screening
level (RBSL) of 0.102 ppbv for benzene in residential air [18, 20, 47–50]. Benzene concentra-
tions in groundwater samples collected at oil and gas development sites in northeastern Colo-
rado associated with surface spills range from less than 1–12,000 parts per billion (ppb), with a
median of 1.5 ppb [16], which is greater than EPA’s RBSL of 0.45 ppb for benzene in tap water
[50]. It is important to note that EPA’s RBSLs for benzene are based on cancer concerns.
Benzene is a well established cause of acute myeloid leukemia in adults [51]. Studies of ben-
zene exposures and acute leukemias in children are limited and less conclusive. An ecological
study in Texas reported that census tracts with the highest benzene levels (1.6 ppbv) had ele-
vated rates of childhood ALL [11]. A case-control study in France reported that children aged
0–14 years living in a home adjoining to a gas station or repair garage were at increased odds
of ALL [10]. Another case-control study in California reported elevated odds of ALL in chil-
dren aged 0–5 years exposed to ambient levels of benzene and xylenes in the their third trimes-
ter of pregnancy [8]. However, a recent study in France found no assocation between benzene
emissions from heavy traffic and ALL [52].
Our study benefited from the ability to select cases and controls from the same population.
Because all our data were obtained from the CCCR, neither recall bias nor measurement bias
affected our results. The possibility of random errors does exist in the CCCR, but in our judg-
ment these are unlikely to affect our findings.
Geocoded addresses were missing for 27% of our study population, with a higher propor-
tion of missing addresses for white Hispanics and young adults aged 19–24 years, as well as
controls. These groups are more likely to include migrant workers, college students, and
undocumented residents, so our results may not be representative of these groups.
Because ALL and NHL are rare diseases, there were only a small number of ALL and NHL
cases in rural Colorado between 2001 and 2013. This limited number of cases affected the sta-
bility of our associations, as evidenced by wide confidence intervals, particularly for ALL in the
5–24 year and 0–4 year subsets and in the NHL analyses. Our controls were children diagnosed
with a non-hematologic cancer, which may share some risk factors with NHL and ALL,
including exposure to hazardous air pollutants associated with oil and gas development. This
may have biased our associations toward the null [29, 53]. We note that between 2000 and
2013: (1) in rural Colorado counties, the mean annual incidence of ALL increased more

 rapidly than the total cancer incidence with an annual mean increase of 2.9% per year com-
pared to 0.51% per year; and (2) in urban Colorado counties, the mean annual incidence of
ALL decreased by 0.5% [23]. In addition, our observed 5.9% proportion of ALL to other can-
cers in the unexposed group (no wells within 16.1 km) is similar to rural population propor-
tions populations in the neighboring states of Nebraska (6.1% and Utah (4.6%) [54]. Finally,
82% of the children in the 0–4 year age group resided in a home within one of the IDW well
count tertiles (one or more active oil and gas wells in a 16.1-kilometer radius) compared to
71% of children in the 5–24 year age groups.
Data on covariates obtained from the CCCR were limited to basic demographic informa-
tion and median incomes at the zip code level. Our inability to adjust for early common infec-
tions, nutrition, family history of neoplasms, water source, proximity to other pollutants, and
daycare attendance, as well as individual income, may have resulted in residual confounding.
Meta analyses indicate that children with ALL and NHL are 10% and 22%, respectively, more
likely than controls to have a mother who smoked during pregnancy [55, 56]. We also per-
formed secondary analyses on the small subset of children with data on maternal smoking dur-
ing pregnancy. It did not indicate substantial confounding in our ALL results, though we had
limited power. Our inability to adjust for maternal smoking during pregnancy also may have
resulted in residual confounding.
Because we did not have complete residential histories, we assumed that address at time of diag-
nosis represented a child’s residence over the entire exposure period, so residential mobility during
the exposure period may have obscured our results. A California study on residential mobility in
children with leukemia found that 66% of children moved between birth and diagnosis, urban/
rural status changed for 20%, and neighborhood SES changed for 35% [57]. The lack of informa-
tion on residence across the entire exposure period prior to diagnosis likely introduced exposure
misclassification for both controls and cases, most likely biasing our estimates toward the null.
Using IDW well counts in absence of information on O&G well activities, meteorology,
and topography likely reduced temporal and spatial specificity in IDW well counts [36]. The
overall effect of the resulting exposure misclassification is unknown, but it would most likely
have biased our associations toward the null [58, 59]. The subset of oil and gas wells for which
a spud-in date was not available, and for which we instead used the earliest available date of
activity, may have resulted in an underestimate of IDW well counts for both cases and con-
trols, and thus may have biased our results towards the null [60]. However, this bias is likely
minimal: in the 72% of wells with spud dates, the median number of days between spud date
and the next well activity is 13 days.
Conclusion
In this exploratory study, children aged 5–24 years diagnosed with ALL were more likely than
children diagnosed with a non-hematologic cancer to live within 16.1-kilometers of an active
oil and gas well, while children aged 0–4 years diagnosed with ALL were not more likely than
children diagnosed with a non-hematologic cancer to live with within 16.1-kilometers of an
active oil and gas well. Children aged 0–24 years diagnosed with NHL were no more likely to
live in areas with active oil and gas development than children diagnosed with a non-hemato-
logic cancer. Because oil and gas development has potential to expose a large population to
known hematologic carcinogens, such as benzene, further study is clearly needed to substanti-
ate both our positive and negative findings. Future studies should incorporate information on
oil and gas development activities and production levels near homes, schools, and day care
centers; provide age-specific residential histories; compare cases to controls without cancer;
and address other potential confounders, and environmental stressors.
