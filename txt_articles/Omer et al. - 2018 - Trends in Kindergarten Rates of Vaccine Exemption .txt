Background. Kindergarten-entry vaccination requirements have played an important role in controlling vaccine-preventable dis-
eases in the United States. Forty-eight states and the District of Colombia offer nonmedical exemptions to vaccines, ranging in stringency.
Methods. We analyzed state-level exemption data from 2011 to 2012 through 2015 to 2016 school years. States were categorized 
by exemption ease and type of exemption allowed. We calculated nonmedical exemption rates for each year in the sample and strat-
ified by exemption ease, type, and 2 trend categories: 2011–12 through 2012–13 and 2013–14 through 2015–16 school years. Using 
generalized estimating equations, we created regression models estimating (1) the average annual change in nonmedical exemption 
rates and (2) relative differences in rates by state classification.
Results. The nonmedical exemption rate was higher during the 2013–2014 through 2015–2016 period (2.25%) compared to 
2011–2012 through 2012–2013 (1.75%); more importantly, the average annual change in the latter period plateaued. The nonmedical 
exemption rate in states allowing philosophical and religious exemptions was 2.41 times as high as in states allowing only religious 
exemptions (incidence rate ratio = 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–3.41).
Conclusions. There was an increase in nonmedical exemption rates through the 2012–2013 school year; however, rates stabi-
lized through the 2015–2016 school year, showing an important shift in trend.
Keywords. epidemiology; vaccination; vaccine exemption; vaccine hesitancy. 
School entry vaccine mandates have played an important role 
in controlling childhood communicable diseases in the United 
States [1]. Moreover, data on exemptions to these mandates are 
collected at least once a year in schools and reported to state 
health departments throughout the country, hence providing a 
direct annual measure of vaccine refusal [2].
Since the late 1990s, there has been an increase in nonmed-
ical exemptions [3, 4]. Although this increase is likely to have 
multiple causes, it was preceded by substantial declines in vac-
cine-preventable diseases and coincided with publication of 
a now retracted case series linking the measles, mumps, and 
rubella (MMR) vaccine with autism [5]. The study was subse-
quently found to be fraudulent, and the lead author was deprived 
of his medical license by the UK General Medical Council [6].
High rates of nonmedical exemptions have been associated 
with higher rates of vaccine-preventable diseases [3, 7]. Local clus-
ters of vaccine exemptions geographically overlap with outbreaks 
of pertussis [7, 8]. Moreover, nonmedical vaccine exemptions 
have played an important role in measles outbreaks after elimin-
ation of endemic measles transmission in the United States [9]. 
Recently, a large measles outbreak—first identified among visitors 
to Disneyland California—was associated with a large proportion 
of cases among individuals with nonmedical exemptions [10].
There have been 2 multiyear assessments of longitudinal 
trends in nonmedical exemption rates in the United States. Both 
of these analyses—which included data from 1993 through 
2004 [3] and 2006 through 2011 [4]—found an increase in non-
medical exemptions. In fact, the rate of increase was higher in 
the 2006 through 2011 period compared to the 1993 through 
2004 period [3, 4]. Moreover, there was an association between 
the administrative ease of obtaining nonmedical exemptions 
and rates on nonmedical exemptions and pertussis [3].
In recent years, the efforts to address the increase in nonmed-
ical exemptions have intensified. Professional medical associa-
tions such as American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers of 
Disease Control Prevention and Control, and state and local 
health departments have developed and disseminated resources 
to address vaccine hesitancy and refusal. The 2014–2015 measles 
outbreak that started in California, the so-called “Disneyland 
outbreak,” received considerable media attention, focusing on the 
individual and community risk of vaccine refusal [10]. Moreover, 
several states have enacted legislation to increase administrative 
scrutiny of requests to obtain nonmedical exemptions.
Although there have been a few recent reports of nonmed-
ical exemption rates in various states, we are not aware of a 
longitudinal analysis of recent national trends in nonmedical

exemption rates accounting for administrative ease of nonmed-
ical exemptions. In this study, we evaluated secular trends in 
nonmedical exemptions in the United States between the 2011–
2012 and 2015–2016 school years (inclusive) and evaluated the 
association between exemption rates and ease of obtaining non-
medical exemptions and types of exemptions permitted.
METHODS
In the United States, during the 2011–2012 through 2015–2016 
school years, 48 states (excluding West Virginia and Mississippi) 
and the District of Colombia (DC) permitted nonmedical 
exemptions to vaccination requirements for school entry to kin-
dergarten (California passed a law in 2016 removing all nonmed-
ical exemptions, which went into effect after the study period). 
These state-level laws vary by administrative ease of obtaining 
nonmedical exemptions. For this analysis, we obtained data com-
piled yearly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) on the number of exemptions filed for incoming kinder-
garteners [11–15]. We used publicly available documentation 
on state-level vaccine policies for this analysis [16]. A secondary 
reviewer verified each state’s vaccine exemption policy through 
state legislative and health department websites.
We categorized states by the type of nonmedical exemption 
allowed—only religious exemptions or allowing religious and 
philosophical exemptions—in addition to medical exemptions. 
We also categorized states by ease of obtaining a nonmedical 
exemption, using categories easy, medium, and difficult, adapted 
from Omer et al [3] (Table 1). This method of classification was 
chosen because ease of exemption has been shown to be asso-
ciated with higher rates of disease [17]. In addition, we wanted 
our work to be comparable with other studies in this field, which 
have used the Omer et al [3] ease classifications, published in 
2012. After initial analysis of the data by school year, we chose to 
stratify the data into year trend categories: one category includ-
ing years 2011–2012 and 2012–2013, and another category 
including years 2013–2014 through 2015–2016 (Table 2).
Over the course of the study period, 7 notable legislative 
changes went into effect. Each legislative change during the 
study period led to nonmedical exemptions being more difficult 
to obtain (Table 3). All changes in exemption ease classification 
were reflected in the dataset by coding each individual year with 
the corresponding ease classification. California and Vermont 
passed vaccine exemption legislation in 2016: California 
removed all nonmedical exemptions, and Vermont removed 
philosophical exemptions. Both of these bills went into effect 
on July 1, 2016, which fell just outside of our study period.
We calculated nonmedical exemption rates using the number 
of exemptions reported per year by states in the numerator and 
dividing by the total number of reported enrolled kindergarten-
ers per year, by state. We then stratified the sample by type of 
exemption allowed in states per year and ease of exemption cat-
egory in states per year (Figure 1). For the 7 states that enacted 
new legislation in the study period, we changed ease and/or type 
of exemption category for subsequent years to reflect the provi-
sions of the new law. We used t tests to compare mean nonmedi-
cal exemption rates between states by exemption type and policy.
Using generalized estimating equations, we created negative 
binomial regression models to estimate (1) the average annual 
change in nonmedical exemption rates and (2) relative dif-
ferences in rates by state classification (ie, type of exemption 
allowed; difficulty of exemption policy). All estimates were 
generated as incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and they were com-
puted for the full time period as well as stratified into 2 tem-
poral periods of 2011–2012 through 2012–2013 school years 
and 2013–2014 through 2015–2016 school years. The models 
accounted for correlations among repeated state-level meas-
ures during the study period, with state used as the clustering 
term and assumed independence between states. In addition to 
unadjusted models, we generated models adjusted for potential 
confounding variables of income (10 categories), race (9 cat-
egories), education (5 categories), and population density. For 
adjusted models, data for all covariates for each state and year of 
this analysis came from the US Census Bureau [18–23]. All data 
analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).
To estimate the average annual change in nonmedical exemp-
tion rates, we estimated the IRR considering school year as the 
primary predictor. Because we used state-level data in this ana-
lysis, institutional review board approval was not required.
RESULTS
Over the full study period, a total of 245 state-years were 
included in the analysis. From 2011–2012 through 2015–2016, 
29 states and DC allowed for exemptions based on religious 
beliefs, and 19 states allowed for both exemptions based on

religious beliefs and philosophical or personal belief reasons. 
During the study period, 8 states were classified as having easy 
exemption policies, 18 states were classified as having medium 
exemption policies, and 23 states were classified as having dif-
ficult exemption policies during at least 1 year of the analysis 
(Table 1). Over the course of the study period, 10 states enacted 
new legislative changes, leading to the states exemption policy 
to be reclassified. Of these 10 states, all but 1 enacted policy 
changes to make nonmedical exemptions harder to obtain.
From 2011–2012 through 2015–2016, the average non-
medical exemption rate increased to 2.04%, from the average 
of 1.58% reported in a similar analysis conducted in 2011 [4]. 
The nonmedical exemption rate in states allowing philosophi-
cal and religious exemptions was 2.41 times as high as in states

through 2015–2016 compared to 1.75% during 2011–2012 
through 2012–2013), the average annual change in exemption 
rates leveled off to a null change in the later years.
DISCUSSION
Our study shows an increase in nonmedical exemptions through 
the 2012–13 school year, which then plateaued. This is the first 
time since the late 1990s that we have seen such stabilization. 
There are many potential explanations as to why this leveling 
off has occurred, including considerable efforts by medical and 
public health authorities to address vaccine hesitancy and media 
attention focused on outbreaks of disease involving vaccine refus-
als and nonmedical exemptions. The slight increase between 
medium and difficult policy states could be attributed to the lag-
time in enacting new laws to enforcing those laws on the school 
level. However, like other studies evaluating national phenomena, 
this study is not able to directly assess the specific factors that have 
affected changes in exemption rates. The risk of vaccine refusal 
and exemptions remains an important issue in many localities 
where much higher exemption rates are seen. These clusters of 
exemptions have been associated with outbreaks of pertussis and 
remain an important threat to the public’s health [7].
We found that states allowing philosophical and easy-to-ob-
tain exemptions continue to be associated with higher rates of 
exemptions [3, 4, 24]. In the wake of the recent Disneyland mea-
sles outbreak, California eliminated all nonmedical exemptions. 
The impact of this policy, including its implementation, is not 
yet apparent, because it will take many years of data to evalu-
ate postimplementation trends. The majority of states have not 
gone as far as to eliminate exemptions, because there is evidence 
pointing to successes in curbing nonmedical exemptions by 
restricting exemptions rather than fully eliminating them [3, 4]. 
Our study suggests that eliminating philosophical exemptions 
and making the exemption procedures more stringent may be 
useful policy approaches in states that are waiting to learn from 
the California experience of eliminating nonmedical exemp-
tions or where such a policy approach is not politically feasible.
Although ours is the largest recent evaluation of national sec-
ular trends in nonmedical exemptions, there are a few limita-
tions to our study. State exemption rates are based upon school 
reporting, and there is variability among states in how schools 
report exemption rates. For example, in the 2015–16 school 
year, 32 states collected data from all schools, 10 states used a 
random sample, 3 states relied on voluntary response, and 6 
states relied on a mix of sampling methods to obtain exemption 
rates [15]. A breakdown of reporting for each state by year can 
be found in the yearly MMWR [11–15] report that details vac-
cine coverage among children in kindergarten across the United 
States, by school year. In some states, all schools report data 
and there are regular audits. Other states base their exemption 
rates on a random sample of schools. However, 74% of states 
estimate vaccine exemption rates using data from each school 
(and, therefore, from each child). The US Census Bureau data 
indicate that 86% of the US population resides in these states 
[25]. Therefore, we believe our overall results to be generalizable 
to the US population. As already mentioned, we are not able 
to quantitatively explore the causes for changes in exemption 
rates and most particularly the leveling off we have identified. 
However, our comparisons of exemption rates between states 
based upon the type of nonmedical exemption and administra-
tive procedures for granting exemptions provides vaccine pol-
icy approaches that are associated with exemption rates.
CONCLUSIONS
Continued monitoring of exemption rates is critically impor-
tant to ensure that the plateau in rates identified by our study is 
sustained. Improvements can also be made to within-state col-
lection of exemption data to improve this surveillance system 
moving forward. States will be well served by enacting legisla-
tion that changes the balance of convenience in favor of vacci-
nation and away from nonmedical exemptions [26].
