Summary
Background Diarrhoea and growth faltering in early childhood are associated with subsequent adverse outcomes. We 
aimed to assess whether water quality, sanitation, and handwashing interventions alone or combined with nutrition 
interventions reduced diarrhoea or growth faltering. 
Methods The WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster-randomised trial enrolled pregnant women from villages in 
rural Bangladesh and evaluated outcomes at 1-year and 2-years’ follow-up. Pregnant women in geographically 
adjacent clusters were block-randomised to one of seven clusters: chlorinated drinking water (water); upgraded 
sanitation (sanitation); promotion of handwashing with soap (handwashing); combined water, sanitation, and 
handwashing; counselling on appropriate child nutrition plus lipid-based nutrient supplements (nutrition); 
combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition; and control (data collection only). Primary outcomes 
were caregiver-reported  diarrhoea in the past 7 days among children who were in utero or younger than 3 years at 
enrolment and length-for-age Z score among children born to enrolled pregnant women. Masking was not possible 
for data collection, but analyses were masked. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCC01590095.
Findings Between May 31, 2012, and July 7, 2013, 5551 pregnant women in 720 clusters were randomly allocated to 
one of seven groups. 1382 women were assigned to the control group; 698 to water; 696 to sanitation; 688 to 
handwashing; 702 to water, sanitation, and handwashing; 699 to nutrition; and 686 to water, sanitation, 
handwashing, and nutrition. 331 (6%) women were lost to follow-up. Data on diarrhoea at year 1 or year 2 
(combined) were available for 14 425 children (7331 in year 1, 7094 in year 2) and data on length-for-age Z score in 
year 2 were available for 4584 children (92% of living children were measured at year 2). All interventions had high 
adherence. Compared with a prevalence of 5·7% (200 of 3517 child weeks) in the control group, 7-day diarrhoea 
prevalence was lower among index children and children under 3 years at enrolment who received sanitation 
(61 [3·5%] of 1760; prevalence ratio 0·61, 95% CI 0·46–0·81), handwashing (62 [3·5%] of 1795; 0·60, 0·45–0·80), 
combined water, sanitation, and handwashing (74 [3·9%] of 1902; 0·69, 0·53–0·90), nutrition (62 [3·5%] of 1766; 
0·64, 0·49–0·85), and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition (66 [3·5%] of 1861; 0·62, 0·47–0·81); 
diarrhoea prevalence was not significantly lower in children receiving water treatment (90 [4·9%] of 1824; 0·89, 
0·70–1·13). Compared with control (mean length-for-age Z score –1·79), children were taller by year 2 in the 
nutrition group (mean difference 0·25 [95% CI 0·15–0·36]) and in the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, 
and nutrition group (0·13 [0·02–0·24]). The individual water, sanitation, and handwashing groups, and combined 
water, sanitation, and handwashing group had no effect on linear growth.
Interpretation Nutrient supplementation and counselling modestly improved linear growth, but there was no 
benefit to the integration of water, sanitation, and handwashing with nutrition. Adherence was high in all groups 
and diarrhoea prevalence was reduced in all intervention groups except water treatment. Combined water, 
sanitation, and handwashing interventions provided no additive benefit over single interventions.

Introduction
Over 200 million children born in low-income countries 
are at risk of not reaching their development potential.1 
Poor linear growth in early childhood is a marker 
for chronic deprivation that is associated with 
increased mortality, impaired cognitive development, 
and reduced adult income.2 Nutrition-specific inter-
ventions have been shown to improve child growth

but they have only corrected a small part of the total 
growth deficit.3
Environmental enteric dysfunction is an abnormality 
of gut function that might explain why most nutrition 
interventions fail to normalise early childhood growth.4 
Environmental contaminants are thought to induce the 
chronic intestinal inflammation, loss of villous surface 
area, and impaired barrier function that combine to 
impair food and nutrient uptake. Several observational 
studies find that children living in communities where 
most people have access to a toilet are less likely to be 
stunted than are children who live in communities where 
open defecation is more common.5 Intervention trials to 
reduce exposure to human faeces can resolve questions 
of confounding in the relationship between toilet access 
and child growth and evaluate poten 
tial interventions. 
Improvements to drinking water quality, sanitation, and 
handwashing might improve the effectiveness of 
nutrition interventions and there 
by help to tackle a larger 
portion of the observed growth deficit.
In addition to asymptomatic infections and subclinical 
changes to the gut, episodes of symptomatic diarrhoea 
accounted for about 500 000 deaths of children younger 
than 5 years in 2015.6 Approaches to reduce diarrhoea 
include treated drinking water, improved sanitation, and 
increased handwashing with soap. Although funding a 
single intervention for a larger population might improve 
health more than multiple interventions that target 
a smaller population, data to inform such decisions 
are scarce.
Interventions that combine nutrition and water, 
sanitation, and handwashing might provide mul-
tiple benefits to children, but there is little evidence 
that directly compares the effects of individual and 
com 
bined interventions on diarrhoea and growth of 
young children.7,8
We aimed to investigate whether individual water, 
sanitation, handwashing, or nutrition interventions can 
reduce linear growth faltering; to assess whether 
combined water, sanitation, and handwashing inter-
ventions are more effective at reducing diarrhoea than 
individual interventions; and to investigate whether 
the combination of water, sanitation, handwashing, and 
nutrition interventions reduces growth faltering more 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Although malnutrition and diarrhoeal disease in children have 
been known for decades to impair child health and growth, there 
is little evidence on interventions that are successful at improving 
growth and reducing diarrhoea. Several observational analyses 
noted positive associations between improvements in water, 
sanitation, and handwashing conditions and child growth, but at 
the time this study was conceived there were no published 
randomised controlled trials specifically powered to evaluate the 
effect of such interventions on child growth as a primary 
outcome. Subsequent published trials of sanitation interventions 
have reported mixed results. Systematic reviews of 
complementary feeding interventions have reported small but 
significant improvements in child growth. More recent evidence 
from lipid-based nutrient supplementation trials has been mostly 
consistent with these earlier systematic reviews. Chronic enteric 
infection might affect children’s capacity to respond to nutrients; 
however, we found no published studies comparing the effect on 
child growth of nutritional interventions alone versus nutritional 
interventions plus water, sanitation, and handwashing 
interventions. Although many programmatic interventions 
target multiple pathways of enteric pathogen transmission, 
systematic reviews have found no greater reduction in diarrhoea 
with combined versus single water, sanitation, and handwashing 
interventions. There is little direct evidence comparing 
interventions that target a single versus multiple pathways. Only 
three randomised controlled trials compared single versus 
combined interventions in comparable populations at the same 
time. None of these trials found a significant reduction in 
diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years who received 
combined versus the most effective single intervention.
Added value of this study
This trial was designed to compare the effects of individual 
and combined water quality, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrient 
supplementation plus infant and young child feeding 
counselling interventions on diarrhoea and growth when 
given to infants and young children in a setting where child 
growth faltering was common. The trial had high intervention 
adherence, low attrition, and ample statistical power to detect 
small effects. Children receiving interventions with nutritional 
components had small growth benefits compared with those 
in the control cluster. Water quality, sanitation, and 
handwashing interventions did not improve child growth, 
neither when delivered alone nor when combined with the 
nutritional interventions. Children receiving sanitation, 
handwashing, nutrition, and combined interventions had less 
reported diarrhoea. Combined interventions showed no 
additional reduction in diarrhoea beyond single interventions.
Implications of all the available evidence
The modest improvements observed in growth faltering with 
nutritional supplementation and counselling are consistent 
with other trials that report similar levels of efficacy in some 
contexts. By contrast to observational studies that report an 
association between growth faltering and water, sanitation, 
and hygiene assessments, this intervention trial provides no 
evidence that household drinking water quality, sanitation, or 
handwashing interventions consistently improve growth. This 
trial further supports findings from smaller trials that combined 
individual water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions 
are not consistently more effective in the prevention of 
diarrhoea than are single interventions.

than each individual intervention. A companion trial 
in Kenya evaluated the same objectives.9
Methods
Study design
The WASH Benefits Bangladesh study was a cluster-
randomised trial conducted in rural villages in Gazipur, 
Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, and Tangail districts of 
Bangladesh (appendix p 2). We grouped pregnant 
women who lived near enough to each other into a 
cluster to allow delivery of interventions by a single 
community promoter. We hypothesised that the 
interventions would improve the health of the index 
child in each household. Each measure 
ment round 
lasted about 1 year and was balanced across treatment 
arms and geography to minimise seasonal or geo-
graphical confounding when comparing outcomes 
across groups. We chose areas with low groundwater 
iron and arsenic (because these affect chlorine demand) 
and where no major water, sanitation, or nutrition 
programmes were ongoing or planned by the 
government or large non-government organisations. 
The study design and rationale have been published 
previously.10
The latrine component of the sanitation intervention 
was a compound level intervention. The drinking water 
and handwashing interventions were household level 
interventions. 
The 
nutrition 
intervention 
was 
a 
child-specific intervention. We assessed the diarrhoea 
outcome among all children in the compound who were 
younger than 3 years at enrolment, which could 
underestimate the effect of interventions targeted only to 
index households (drinking water, and handwashing) or 
index children (nutrition). After the study results were 
unmasked, we analysed diarrhoea prevalence restricted 
to index children (ie, children directly targeted by each 
intervention).
The study protocol was approved by the Ethical 
Review Committee at The International Centre for 
Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR-11063), the 
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the 
University of California, Berkeley (2011-09-3652), and the 
institutional review board at Stanford University (25863).
Participants
Rural households in Bangladesh are usually organised 
into compounds where patrilineal families share a 
common courtyard and sometimes a pond, water source, 
and latrine. Research assistants visited compounds in 
candidate communities. If compound residents reported 
no iron taste in their drinking water nor iron staining of 
their water storage vessels,11 and if a woman reported 
being in the first two trimesters of pregnancy, research 
assistants recorded the global positioning system 
coordinates of her household. We reviewed maps of 
plotted households and made clusters of eight expectant 
women who lived close enough to each other for a single 
community promoter to readily walk to each compound. 
We used a 1 km buffer around each cluster to reduce the 
potential for spillover between clusters (median buffer 
distance 2·6 km [IQR 1·8–3·7]). Participants gave written 
informed consent before enrolment.
The in utero children of enrolled pregnant women 
(index children) were eligible for inclusion if their 
mother was planning to live in the study village for the 
next 2 years, regardless of where she gave birth. Only 
one pregnant woman was enrolled per compound, but 
if she gave birth to twins, both children were enrolled. 
Children who were younger than 3 years at enrolment 
and lived in the compound were included in diarrhoea 
measurements.
Randomisation and masking
Clusters were randomly allocated to treatment using a 
random number generator by a coinvestigator at 
University of California, Berkeley (BFA). Each of the 
eight geographically adjacent clusters was block-
randomised to the double-sized control arm or one of the 
six interventions (water; sanitation; handwashing; water, 
sanitation, and handwashing; nutrition; or water, 
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition). Geographical 
matching ensured that arms were balanced across 
locations and time of measurement.
Interventions included distinct visible components so 
neither participants nor data collectors were masked to 
intervention assignment, although the data collection 
and intervention teams were different individuals. 
Two investigators (BFA and JBC) did independent, 
masked statistical analyses from raw datasets to generate 
final estimates, with the true group assignment variable 
replaced with a re-randomised uninformative assignment 
variable. The results were unmasked after all analyses 
were replicated.
Procedures
We used the Integrated Behavioural Model for Water 
Sanitation and Hygiene to develop the interventions 
over 2 years of iterative testing and revision.12 This 
model addresses contextual, psychosocial, and techno-
logical factors at the societal, community, interpersonal, 
individual, and habitual levels.
Community promoters delivered the interventions. 
These promoters were women who had completed at 
least 8 years of formal education, lived within walking 
distance of an intervention cluster, and passed a written 
and oral examination. Promoters attended multiple 
training 
sessions, 
including 
quarterly 
refreshers. 
Training addressed technical intervention issues, active 
listening skills, and strategies for the development of 
collaborative solutions with study participants. Promoters 
were instructed to visit intervention households at least 
once weekly in the first 6 months, and then at least once 
every 2 weeks. Promoters who delivered more complex 
interventions received longer formal training (table 1).

After the hardware was installed, household visits 
involved promoters greeting target household members, 
checking for the presence and functionality of hardware 
and signs of use, observing any of the recommended 
practices, and then following a structured plan for that 
visit. For each visit, a promoter’s guide detailed the visit 
objective, the target audience, the specific steps, and 
materials to be used. Discussions, video dramas, 
storytelling, games, songs, and training on hardware 
maintenance were included in different visits. The 
breadth of the curriculum varied by the complexity of the 
intervention. Promoters delivering combined inter-
ventions were expected to spend sufficient time to cover 
all of the behavioural objectives with target households. 
Promoters did not visit control households. Promoters 
received a monthly stipend equivalent to US$20, 
comparable to the local compensation for 5 days of 
agricultural labour.
The water intervention, which was modelled on a 
successful intervention from a previous trial,11 provided 
a 10 L vessel with a lid, tap, and regular supply of sodium 
dichloroisocyanurate tablets (Medentech, Wexford, 
Ireland) to the household of index children. Households 
were encouraged to fill the vessel, add one 33 mg tablet, 
and wait 30 min before drinking the water. All household 
members, but especially children younger than 5 years, 
were encouraged to drink only chlorine-treated water. 
Non-index households in the compound did not receive 
the water intervention.
The latrine component of the sanitation intervention 
targeted all households in the compound. All latrines 
that did not have a slab, a functional water seal, or a 
construction that prevented surface runoff of a faecal 
stream into the community were replaced. If the index 
household did not have their own latrine, the project 
built one. The standard project intervention latrine was a 
double pit latrine with a water seal.13 Each pit had five 
concrete rings that were 0·3 m high. When the initial pit 
filled, the superstructure and slab could be moved to the 
second pit. In the less than 2% of cases where there was 
insufficient space for a second pit or the water table was 
too high for a pit that was 1·5 m deep, the design was 
adapted. Nearly all households (99%) provided labour 
and modest financial contributions towards the cons-
truction of the latrines. All households in sanitation 
intervention compounds also received a sani-scoop, 
which is a hand tool for the removal of faeces from the 
compound,14 and child potties if they had any children 
younger than 3 years.15 Promoters encouraged mothers 
to teach their children to use the potties, to safely dispose 
of faeces in latrines, and to regularly remove animal and 
human faeces from the compound.
The handwashing intervention targeted house

was done 12–15 months after start of intervention; content was based on analysis of reasons for gap between goals for uptake and actual uptake and addressed reasons for low uptake (specific to each 
intervention). †Promoter visits were intended to teach participants how to use technologies and how to use and restock products; arrange for social support; communicate benefits of use and practice and 
changes in social norms; congratulate and encourage; problem-solve as needed; and inspire. Techniques used included counselling via flipcharts and cue cards, onsite demonstrations of technologies and 
products, video dramas, storytelling, games, and songs. Promoter’s guides detailed the visit objective, target audience, and the specific steps and materials to be used.

Data are n (%) or mean (SD). Percentages were estimated from slightly smaller denominators than those shown at the top of the table for the following variables due to missing 
values: mother’s age; father’s education; father works in agriculture; acres of land owned; open defecation; latrine has a concrete slab; latrine has a functional water seal; visible 
stool on latrine slab or floor; ownership of child potty; observed faeces in the house or child’s play area; and handwashing variables. *Households in these communities who do 
not own a latrine typically share a latrine with extended family members who live in the same compound. †Assessed by the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale.

their hands with soapy water before preparing food, 
before eating or feeding a child, after defecating, and 
after cleaning a child who has defected.
We aimed to deploy interventions so that index children 
were born into households with the interventions in place. 
In the combined intervention arms, the sanitation 
intervention was implemented first, followed by hand-
washing and then water treatment.
The nutrition intervention targeted index children. 
Promoters gave study mothers with children aged 
6–24 months two 10 g sachets per day of lipid-based 
nutrient supplement (LNS; Nutriset; Malaunay, France) 
that could be mixed into the child’s food. Each sachet 
provided 118 kcal, 9·6 g fat, 2·6 g protein, 12 vitamins, and 
ten minerals. Promoters explained that LNS should not 
replace breastfeeding or complementary foods and en-
couraged caregivers to exclusively breastfeed their children 
during the first 6 months and to provide a diverse, 
nutrient-dense diet using locally available foods for children 
older than 6 months. Intervention messages were adapted 
from the Alive & Thrive programme in Bangladesh.17
Outcomes
Primary outcomes were caregiver-reported diarrhoea 
among all children who were in utero or younger 
than 3 years at enrolment in the past 7 days (based on all 
data from year 1 and year 2) and length-for-age Z score at 
year 2 in index children. Secondary outcomes included 
length-for-age Z score at year 1; weight-for-length Z score, 
weight-for-age Z score, head circumference-for-age Z 
score at year 1 and year 2; and pre 
valence of moderate 
stunting (length-for-age Z score less than –2), severe 
stunting (length-for-age Z score less than –3) underweight 
(weight-for-age Z score less than –2), and wasting 
(weight-for-age Z score less than –2). All-cause mortality 
among index children was a tertiary outcome.10 Full 
details on exclusion criteria, measurement protocols, and 
outcome definitions are in the appendix (p 21–27).

Outcome and adherence was assessed by a team of 
university graduates who were not involved in the delivery 
or promotion of interventions. They received a minimum 
of 21 days of formal training. The mother of the index child 
answered the interview questions.
We defined diarrhoea as at least three loose or watery 
stools within 24 h or at least one stool with blood.18 We 
assessed diarrhoea in the preceding 7 days among index 
children and among children who lived in enrolled 
compounds and who were younger than 3 years at 
enrolment and so would be expected to remain under 
5 years of age throughout the trial. Diarrhoea was 
assessed at about 16 months and 28 months after 
enrolment. We included caregiver-reported bruising or 
abrasion as a negative control outcome.19
We calculated Z scores for length for age, weight for 
length, weight for age, and head circumference for age 
using the WHO 2006 child growth standards. Child 
mortality was assessed at the two follow-up evaluation 
visits based on caregiver interview. Length-for-age Z scores 
were measured at about 28 months after enrolment when 
index children would average about 24 months of age. 
Trained anthropometrists followed standard protocols20 
and measured recumbent length (to 0·1 cm) and weight 
without clothing in duplicate; if the two values disagreed 
(>0·5 cm for length, 0·1 kg for weight) they repeated the 
measure until replicates fell within the error tolerance. We 
excluded children from Z-score analyses if their 
measurements were outside biologically plausible ranges 
according to WHO recommendations.20
Statistical analyses
Sample size calculations for the two primary outcomes 
were based on a relative risk of diarrhoea of 0·7 or smaller 
(assuming a 7-day prevalence of 10% in the control group21) 
and a minimum detectable effect of 0·15 length-for-age 
Z score for comparisons of any intervention against 
control, accounting for repeated measures within clusters. 
The calculations assumed a type I error (α) of 0·05 and 
power (1–β) of 0·8, a one-sided test for a two-sample 
comparison of means, and 10% loss to follow-up. Sample 
size calculations indicated 90 clusters per group, each with 
eight children. Full details are given in appendix 4 of our 
study protocol.10
We analysed participants according to their randomised 
assignment (intention to treat), regardless of adherence 
to the intervention. Since randomisation was geo-
graphically pair-matched in blocks of eight clusters, we 
estimated unadjusted prevalence differences and ratios 
using a pooled Mantel-Haenszel estimator that stratified 
by matched pair.
We used paired t tests and cluster-level means for 
unadjusted Z score comparisons. For each comparison, 
we calculated two p values (two-sided): one for the test 
that mean differences were different from zero and a 
second to test for any difference between groups in the 
full dis 
tribution using permutation tests with the 
Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic. Secondary adjusted 
analyses control 
led for prespecified, prognostic baseline 
covariates using data-adaptive, targeted maximum 
likelihood estimation. To assess whether interventions 
affected nearby clusters, we estimated the difference in 
primary outcomes between control compounds at 
different distances from intervention compounds. We 
did not adjust for multiple comparisons.22
Analyses were done in R (version 3.2.3). We tested for 
the presence of between-cluster spillover effects using a 
non-parametric method described in the prespecified 
analysis plan.
The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01590095. The International Centre for Diarrhoeal 
Disease Research, Bangladesh convened a data and 
safety monitoring board and oversaw the study.

Fieldworkers identified 13 279 compounds with a 
pregnant woman in her first or second trimester; over 
half were excluded to create 1 km buffer zones between 
intervention areas. Between May 31, 2012, and July 7, 2013,

intervention or the control group (figure 1). Index 
children in 912 (16%) enrolled compounds did not 
complete follow-up, most commonly because they were 
not born alive (361 [7%]) or died before the final 
assessment (220 [4%]). 109 (2%) households moved, 
175 (3%) were absent on repeated follow-up, and 
47 (<1%) withdrew (figure 1). 4667 (93%) of 4999 surviving 
index children were measured at year 2, with 
length-for-age Z scores for 4584 (92%) children.
There were a median of two households (IQR 1–3, 
range 1–11) per compound. Most index households 
(4108 [74%] of 5551) collected drinking water from shallow 
tubewells. At enrolment, about half (2976 [54%] of 5551) 
of households owned their own latrine; most (4979 [90%] 
 
of 5551 households) used a latrine that had a concrete 
slab, and a quarter (1370 [25%] of 5551) had a functional 
water seal. Baseline characteristics of enrolled households 
were similar across groups (table 2). 
Measures of intervention adherence included presence 
of stored drinking water with detectable free chlorine 
(>0·1 mg/L), a latrine with a functional water seal, 
presence of soap at the primary handwashing location, 
and reported consumption of LNS sachets. Intervention-
specific adherence measures were all greater than 75% in 
households assigned to the relevant intervention and 
were substantially higher than practices in the control 
group. Adherence was similar in the single water, 
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition intervention 
groups compared with the two groups that combined 
interventions (table 3). Adherence was similar at 1-year 
and 2-year follow-up.
Diarrhoea prevalence in the control group was 
substantially below the 10% we had anticipated in our 
sample size calculations (table 4). Diarrhoea prevalence 
was particularly low during the first 9 months of 
observations, with evidence of seasonal epidemics in 
the control group during the monsoon seasons 
(appendix p 3).
Compared with the control group, index children and 
children who were younger than 3 years at enrolment 
and living in compounds where an index child 
received any intervention except water treatment had 
significantly decreased prevalence of diarrhoea at 1-year 
and 2-year follow-up (figure 2, table 4). The reductions in 
diarrhoea prevalence in the combined water, sanitation, 
and handwashing group were no larger than in the 
individual water, sanitation, or handwashing groups. 
Secondary adjusted analyses showed similar effect 
estimates of interventions on reported diarrhoea (table 4). 
The effect of intervention was similar among the index 
children in targeted households (appendix p 10–11) 
compared with the analysis that included both index 
children and children younger than 3 years at enrolment 
who lived in the compound (figure 2); however, the point 
estimates of the prevalence ratio suggested that water or 
handwashing interventions did not have a notable effect 
on non-index children (appendix p 10–11).
There was no difference in prevalence of caregiver-
reported bruising or abrasion between children in the 
control group and any of the intervention groups 
(appendix p 4).
After 2 years of intervention (median age 22 months, 
IQR 21–24), mean length-for-age Z score in the control 
group was –1·79 (SD 1·01); children who received the 
nutrition intervention had an average increase of 
0·25 (95% CI 0·15–0·36) in length-for-age Z scores; and 
children who received the water, sanitation, handwashing, 
and nutrition intervention had an average increase of 
0·13 (0·02–0·24) in length-for-age Z scores (figure 3). 
After about 1 year of intervention (median age 9 months, 
IQR 8–10), children in the nutrition only group (but not 
children in the water, sanitation, handwashing, and 
nutrition group) were significantly taller than control 
children (appendix p 5).
Compared with control children, there was no sig 
nif-
icant difference in length-for-age Z scores in children

receiving the water treatment (length-for-age Z score 
difference –0·06 [95% CI –0·18 to 0·05]), sanitation (–0·02 
[–0·14 to 0·09]), handwashing (–0·07 [–0·18 to 0·04]), 
or water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions 
(0·02 [–0·09 to 0·13]; figure 3). Length-for-age Z scores 
were similar for children who received water, sanitation, 
handwashing, and nutrition and those who received 
nutrition only intervention (–0·12 [–0·26 to 0·01]).
After 2 years of intervention, children in the nutrition 
only or the water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition 
intervention had higher Z scores for length for age, 
weight for length, weight for age, and head circumference 
for age than did children in the control group (table 5). 
Children in the water treatment, sanitation, handwashing, 
or combined water, sanitation, and handwashing 
interventions had Z scores for length for age, weight for 
length, weight for age, and head circumference for age 
that were similar to controls (table 5).
Compared with children living in control households, 
children enrolled in the nutrition only intervention were 
less likely to be stunted after 2 years; children enrolled in 
the water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition 
intervention were less likely to be severely stunted, or 
underweight (table 6). The proportion of children who 
were wasted was similar between the intervention and 
control groups.
Prespecified adjusted analyses found similar effect 
estimates on anthropometric outcomes with similar 
efficiency (appendix p 12–15). There was no evidence of 
between-cluster spillover effects (appendix p 8, 9 and 17–20).
In the control group, the cumulative incidence of child 
 
mortality was 4·7% (figure 1). Mortality in the individual 
water, sanitation, and handwashing groups and combined 
water, sanitation, and handwashing group was similar to 
controls. The two groups with a nutrition intervention had 
lower mortality: 3·8% for the nutrition group and 2·9% for 
the water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group; 
this difference was significant for the combined group 
(risk difference water, sanitation, handwashing, and 
nutrition vs control –1·9% [95% CI –3·6 to –0·1]; p=0·0371; 
38% relative reduction; appendix p 16). 
Discussion
In the WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster-randomised 
controlled trial, the linear growth of children whose 
households had a chlorinated drinking water inter-
vention, sanitation improvements, or handwashing 
intervention alone or in combination was no different 
than children in randomly assigned control households 
that received no intervention. Children in the nutrient 
supplement and counselling group grew somewhat taller 
than controls. Children in households that received a 
combination of water, sanitation, handwashing, and 
nutrition had no greater growth benefit than those 
receiving the nutrition-only intervention. Compared 
with control households, caregiver-reported diarrhoea 
prevalence was significantly decreased in households 
that received any of the interventions, except those who 
received only the drinking water treatment.
The trial’s statistical power to detect small effects and 
high adherence to the interventions suggest that the 
absence of improvement in growth with water, sanitation, 
and handwashing interventions was a genuine null 
effect. These results suggest either that the hypothesis 
that exposure to faecal contamination contributes 
importantly to child growth faltering in Bangladesh is 
flawed or that the hypothesis remains valid but the water, 
sanitation, and handwashing interventions used in this 
trial did not reduce exposure to environmental pathogens 
sufficiently to reduce growth faltering. Future articles 
from our group will describe the effects of intervention 
on environmental contamination with faecal indicator 
bacteria and on the prevalence and concentration of

enteric pathogens in stool specimens from children and 
thus provide insight on how effectively the inter-
ventions altered environmental contamination and 
entero 
pathogen transmission.
The effect of the nutrition intervention, which 
corrected one sixth of the growth deficit compared with 
international norms of healthy growth, was consistent 
with other randomised controlled trials of postnatal LNS 
that have reported variable and generally small effects 
on linear growth.23–27 This variation is probably because 
of contextual factors that affect a population’s capacity 
to respond to an intervention. The water, sanitation, 
and handwashing intervention did not affect crucial 
contextual factors to amplify the effect of the nutrition 
interventions in rural Bangladesh. Continued research 
should explore interventions to reduce growth faltering.
Although intervention households generally reported 
less diarrhoea, people who received the intervention might 
have been grateful and, out of courtesy, reported less 
diarrhoea.28 However, compared with control households, 
intervention households reported no reduction in bruising 
or abrasions (negative control outcomes), so there was no 
evidence of systematic under-reporting of all health 
outcomes. It also seems unlikely that courtesy bias would 
affect each of the interventions except the drinking water 
intervention. The nutrition intervention might have led to 
improve 
ments in breastfeeding practices or in essential 
fatty acids or micronutrient status, which could have 
contributed to improved gut epithelial immune response 
and thus less diarrhoea.29
The finding that drinking water treatment intervention 
had no notable effect on diarrhoea contrasts with our 
previous study of the identical intervention done between 
October, 2011, and November, 2012 in nearby communities 
that found a 36% reduction in reported diarrhoea.11 
Restriction of the analysis to WASH Benefits index 
children who were targeted for the drinking water 
intervention led to a stronger treatment effect estimate 
(prevalence ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·60–1·07]). Diarrhoea 
prevalence in the WASH Benefits control group (6%) was 
substantially lower than the 10% prevalence noted in a 
large prior study21 and the 11% prevalence in the control 
group of our previous study.11 Diarrhoeal prevalence 
characteristically varies substantially in nearby locations 
and from year to year.30 Diarrhoea prevalence in the control 
group of this WASH Benefits trial in rural Bangladesh was 
similar to diarrhoea prevalence among cohorts of children 
aged 1–4 years in the USA.31 At the time of the study, 
rotavirus immunisation had not been introduced into the 
Bangladesh national immunisation programme. The 
unexpectedly low diarrhoea prevalence among control 
children suggests decreased transmission of diarrhoea-
causing pathogens during the WASH Benefits trial 
compared with recent evaluations. This low transmission 
provided less opportunity to interrupt transmission and 
less statistical power to show that interruption.
Combining interventions to improve drinking water 
quality, sanitation, and handwashing provided no additive 
benefit for the reduction of diarrhoea over single 
interventions. The unexpectedly low diarrhoea prevalence 
suggests low transmission of enteric pathogens through 
some of the pathways, which might have prevented any 
additive benefit from the combined interventions. 
Combined interventions did not compromise observed 
adherence to recommended practices. If a substantial 
proportion of the reduced diarrhoea was because of

courtesy bias, this bias might mask subtle additive 
benefits. The only previous randomised controlled 
evaluations of multiple interventions versus single 
interventions also found no additive benefit of multiple 
components of water, sanitation, and handwashing on 
reported diarrhoea among children younger than 
5 years.7,32,33 Because transmission pathways of entero-
pathogens vary by time and location, this absence of an 
additive effect with combined interventions is unlikely to 
generalise to all locations. However, these findings suggest 
that focusing resources on a single low-cost high-uptake 
intervention to a larger population might reduce diarrhoea 
prevalence more than would similar spending on more 
comprehensive approaches to smaller populations.
Children who received both the nutrition and the 
combined water, sanitation, and handwashing inter-
vention were 38% less likely to die than children in the 
control group. Mortality was not a primary study 
outcome. Although the confidence limits are broad and 
the p value is borderline (p=0·037), a causal relationship 
from the interventions is plausible, since diarrhoea and 
poor nutrition are risk factors for death among young 
children in this setting. Notably, reduced mortality was 
only seen in the intervention groups that saw improved 
growth (nutrition groups), which were the groups with 
objective indicators of biological effect. Forthcoming 
investigations of the timing and causes of death 
assessed 
by 
verbal 
autopsy, 
distribution 
of 
enteropathogens among intervention groups, and effect 
of interventions on respiratory disease will provide 
additional evidence to assess the biological plausibility 
of a causal relationship between the combined water, 
sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition intervention 
and reduced mortality.
The randomised design, balanced groups, and high 
adherence suggests that the absence of an associ-
ation between water, sanitation, and handwashing 
interventions and growth is internally valid, but 
this intervention was implemented in one socio-
ecological zone (rural Bangladesh) during a time of low 
diarrhoea prevalence. Reducing faecal exposure through 
household water, sanitation, and handwashing inter-
ventions might affect growth in settings with a different 
prevalence of gastrointestinal disease or mix of pathogens.34 
Notably, water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions 
did not prevent growth faltering in this context where 
stunting is a prevalent public health issue and where 
adherence to the interventions was substantially higher 
than in typical programmatic interventions.21,35,36
The objective measures of uptake reflected the 
availability of infrastructure and supplies, but might 
over-represent actual use. Future articles from our group 
will include structured obser 
vation and other measures 
of uptake. Although more intensive interventions could 
lead to even better practices, it seems unlikely that 
large-scale routine programmes could implement 
interventions with such intensity.
Because the sanitation intervention targeted com-
pounds with pregnant women, these interventions only 
reached about 10% of residents in villages where 
interventions were implemented. If a higher threshold of 
sanitation coverage is necessary to achieve herd 
protection, then this study design would preclude the 
detection of this effect. We used compounds as the unit of 
intervention because they enabled us to deliver intensive 
interventions with high adherence for thousands 
of newborn children. In addition, we expected 
compound-level faecal contami 
nation to represent the 
dominant source of exposure for index children because 
of the physical separation of compounds, and because 
children younger than 2 years of age in these communities 
spent nearly all of their time in their own compound.
The combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and 
nutrition intervention had sustained high levels of 
adherence. Although the full range of benefits of these 
successfully integrated interventions are yet to be fully 
elucidated, our findings suggest there might be a 
survival benefit. Forthcoming articles by our group will 
report the effects of intervention on biomarkers of 
environmental enteric dysfunction, soil-transmitted 
helminth infection, enteric pathogen infection, bio-
markers of inflammation and allostatic load, anaemia 
and nutritional biomarkers, and child language, motor 
development, and social skills.
