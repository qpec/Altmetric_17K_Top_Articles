Reporting of financial conflicts of interest in
clinical practice guidelines: a case study
analysis of guidelines from the Canadian
Medical Association Infobase

Abstract
Background: Clinical practice guidelines are widely distributed by medical associations and relied upon by
physicians for the best available clinical evidence. International findings report that financial conflicts of interest
(FCOI) with drug companies may influence drug recommendations and are common among guideline authors.
There is no comparable study on exclusively Canadian guidelines; therefore, we provide a case study of authors’
FCOI declarations in guidelines from the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Infobase. We also assess the financial
relationships between guideline-affiliated organizations and drug companies.
Methods: Using a population approach, we extracted first-line drug recommendations and authors’ FCOI
disclosures in guidelines from the CMA Infobase. We contacted the corresponding authors on guidelines when
FCOI disclosures were missing for some or all authors. We also extracted guideline-affiliated organizations and
searched each of their websites to determine if they had financial relationships with drug companies.
Results: We analyzed 350 authors from 28 guidelines. Authors were named on one, two, or three guidelines,
yielding 400 FCOI statements. In 75.0 % of guidelines at least one author, and in 21.4 % of guidelines all authors,
disclosed FCOI with drug companies. In 54.0 % of guidelines at least one author, and in 28.6 % of guidelines over
half of the authors, disclosed FCOI with manufacturers of drugs that they recommended. Twenty of 48 authors on
multiple guidelines reported different FCOI in their disclosures. Eight guidelines identified affiliated organizations
with financial relationships with manufacturers of drugs recommended in those guidelines.
Conclusions: This is the first study to systematically describe FCOI disclosures by authors of Canadian guidelines
and financial relationships between guideline-affiliated organizations and pharmaceutical companies. These financial
relationships are common. Because authoritative value is assigned to guidelines distributed by medical associations,
we encourage them to develop formal policies to limit the potential influence of FCOI on guideline
recommendations.

 Background
Clinicians rely on clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for
guidance when making treatment decisions for patients.
Although CPGs should be based on critical analysis of
the best available scientific evidence, authors’ recom-
mendations in some guidelines have been based on
lower levels of evidence or expert opinion [1]. Therefore,
recommendations may be vulnerable to biases [2], which
are of particular concern since financial ties are common
among guideline authors, committee members, and drug
companies that manufacture medications recommended
in guidelines [3]. A common finding in the literature
analyzing guideline recommendations is that the pres-
ence of financial conflict of interest (FCOI) relationships
with pharmaceutical companies may have the potential
to influence drug recommendations [4–13]. Further-
more, international literature has demonstrated concern
over underreporting and inconsistencies in FCOI disclo-
sures in guidelines [2, 3, 14–17].
CPGs are widely distributed by professional medical as-
sociations, such as the Canadian Medical Association
(CMA). The CMA Infobase (https://www.cma.ca/En/
Pages/clinical-practice-guidelines.aspx)
lists
guidelines
that meet the following criteria: include information to
help patients and physicians make decisions about appro-
priate health care for specific clinical circumstances; be
produced by an authoritative Canadian organization or if
produced outside of Canada be officially endorsed by such
an organization; have been developed or reviewed in the
last 5 years; and have evidence that a literature search was
performed during guideline development [18].
We present a case study of authors’ FCOI disclosure
statements in guidelines from the CMA Infobase. We de-
termine the prevalence of not only authors’ disclosed
FCOI with drug companies in general, but also their FCOI
disclosures with the manufacturers of the on-patent drugs
that they recommend as first-line treatments in their re-
spective guidelines. Our focus on on-patent drugs rests on
the assumption that recommending an on-patent drug is
directly beneficial to a single manufacturer, as compared
to recommending an off-patent drug, produced by mul-
tiple manufacturers. Finally, we determine the frequency
with which the guideline-affiliated organizations have fi-
nancial relationships with pharmaceutical companies that
are also manufacturers of the drugs recommended as
first-line treatments in those guidelines.
Methods
Using a population approach, we analyzed 1,150 guide-
lines listed in the CMA Infobase. We did not limit our
case study of guidelines by medical specialty or disease
category; however, we limited the eligible guidelines to
the 353 listed on the CMA Infobase [19] that were pub-
lished or most recently reviewed between 01 January
2012 and 06 November 2013, inclusive (see Additional
file 1). We imposed this date restriction because the re-
quirement for FCOI disclosure is a relatively recent
phenomenon
in
guideline
production
[20].
French-
language guidelines and those that could not be accessed
on the web were excluded.
Two pairs of study researchers (AS and MR, JL and
SA) assessed and documented whether guidelines rec-
ommended specific drugs based on recommendation ta-
bles or, in their absence, within the text. We considered
a “recommendation” to have been made when authors
stated that one or more specific medications were ap-
propriate first-line treatments for a particular patient
population. We excluded guidelines that either recom-
mended only drug classes as opposed to specific medica-
tions, or mentioned or acknowledged specific drugs
without making clear first-line recommendations (Fig. 1).
Specific drugs for first-line treatment were recom-
mended in 102 guidelines. Guidelines that provided only
titles of organizations, committees, or associations in
lieu of individually named authors or committee mem-
bers were excluded, leaving 77 guidelines. Forty add-
itional guidelines that provided neither disclosures, nor
corresponding authors’ contact information were ex-
cluded (Fig. 1). Any disagreements or uncertainties were
resolved through discussion.
From the remaining 37 guidelines, we attempted to lo-
cate disclosure statements for the authors. Twenty
guidelines provided FCOI disclosure statements for all
or some of the authors named on the guideline. Disclos-
ure statements were absent in 10 guidelines and seven
guidelines provided links to FCOI disclosure statements
on external websites. We successfully accessed five of
these external webpages (Fig. 2). We contacted the cor-
responding authors on 15 guidelines for one of two rea-
sons: (1) the guideline had no FCOI disclosure section
and there was no indication that all authors were either
free of FCOI or had any conflicts to report (10 guide-
lines), or (2) disclosures were either vague, or missing
for some authors and the guideline did not state that
these authors were free of FCOI (5 guidelines). We re-
ceived responses from 11 of the 15 corresponding au-
thors whom we contacted, but only five provided us
with additional FCOI disclosure statements.
Ultimately, we located FCOI disclosures for all of the
authors on 22 guidelines and some authors on 6 guide-
lines yielding 350 unique authors, of whom 48 were
named on two or three guidelines, resulting in a total of
400 disclosure statements (see Additional file 2). We di-
vided FCOI disclosures with pharmaceutical companies
into two groups – relevant and non-relevant. We con-
sidered FCOI to be “relevant” when they existed between
an author and the manufacturer of a patented drug rec-
ommended for first-line treatment in that guideline.
Shnier et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2016) 16:383 
Page 2 of 8
 “Non-relevant” FCOI were those with a drug company
other than the manufacturer of one of the recommended
drugs [16]. These companies may have produced a drug
that could also be used to treat the condition being dis-
cussed in the guideline but they may also have produced
a drug that was not useful for the condition. We did not
attempt to distinguish between the two situations as that
would have involved analyzing every drug made by the
company and then using expert opinion to decide if one
(or more) of these drugs could have been recommended.
We considered FCOI to include not only financial com-
pensation, but also activities that are generally associated
with gifting, payment, or reimbursement, even if a monet-
ary value was not disclosed. We defined “vague” FCOI dis-
closures as situations when financial ties were present, but
the declaration prevented a clear determination of the
number of pharmaceutical companies with which authors
held FCOI and whether those FCOI could be classified as
relevant or non-relevant. Conflicts with “non-commercial”
organizations were defined as ties that authors disclosed
with not-for-profit organizations such as the Canadian
Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH).
Because of resource limitations, we decided a priori to
extract FCOI disclosure information for a maximum of
25 authors per guideline, including chairs, co-chairs,
principle authors, co-authors, and committee members.
We assumed that all committee members who were
named within the guideline had voted on its recommen-
dations, even if they were not explicitly listed as authors.
We also assumed that anyone who was not identified as
Fig. 1 Guideline exclusion criteria and process of guideline exclusion

Page 3 of 8
 an author or named committee member (i.e., reviewers,
consultants, and liaisons) did not vote on the final recom-
mendations in the guidelines and we excluded them.
When more than 25 authors and/or committee members,
which will hereafter be referred to collectively as authors,
were named on a guideline, we assigned each a random
value using Microsoft Excel [21]. Organized in ascending
numerical order, the top 25, automatically including expli-
citly identified chair(s), co-chair(s), and principal au-
thor(s), were included in our analysis. We included these
groups because we considered that they had the most in-
fluence in the final recommendations and, therefore, the
presence or absence of their FCOI was particularly im-
portant. However, due to their small numbers we did not
analyze chairs, co-chairs and principal authors separately.
We also extracted authors’ demographic information from
the guidelines: names, academic and medical degrees, and
hospital and academic affiliations.
We recorded whether the medications recommended
in the guidelines were on-patent or if there were off-
patent versions available in Canada by consulting the
Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS)
and Health Canada’s Drug Products Database [22–24]
for the years that the guidelines were either published or
reviewed to determine whether authors’ FCOI declara-
tions were relevant or non-relevant.
Finally, we identified the guideline-affiliated organiza-
tions. We visited each of the organizations’ websites to
identify the pharmaceutical companies with which they
disclosed having financial relationships. We did not
examine whether conferences held by these organiza-
tions had pharmaceutical company sponsors.

Results
We obtained FCOI disclosures for authors on 28 guide-
lines. Twelve were most recently reviewed or published
in 2013 and 16 in 2012.
Out of 400 FCOI disclosure statements for 350 unique
authors, 188 (47.0 %) declared FCOI with pharmaceutical
companies. Individual authors declared FCOI with up to
19 drug companies (median: 3, interquartile range [IQR]:
0, 8). Out of these 188 FCOI declarations, 97 were rele-
vant, 65 were non-relevant, and 26 were vague. Two-
hundred and twelve (53.0 %) of the 400 declarations stated
that the authors were either free of FCOI with drug com-
panies or had conflicts with only non-commercial organi-
zations (Table 1).

 two guidelines and two (0.6 %) were each on three
guidelines.
Of the authors on one guideline, 119 (34.0 %) dis-
closed FCOI with drug companies, while 162 (46.3 %)
disclosed that they had either conflicts with non-
commercial organizations or were free of FCOI with
drug companies. Twenty-one (6.0 %) disclosed vague
FCOI with drug companies (Table 2).
Twenty-eight of the 48 authors’ declarations on two or
three guidelines were consistent in their disclosure state-
ments, but 20 disclosed different FCOI in their disclos-
ure statements in two or three guidelines. Authors
whose disclosures differed in their multiple statements
declared a combination of the following disclosure types:
FCOI with different drug companies, vague FCOI with
drug companies, conflicts with only non-commercial or-
ganizations, and no FCOI (Table 2).
Guideline-level analysis
In 21 guidelines (75.0 %) at least one author disclosed
FCOI with drug companies, while in six guidelines
(21.4 %) all authors disclosed FCOI with drug companies
(median: 69.4 %, IQR: 3.0 %, 93.1 %) (Table 1).
In 15 guidelines (54.0 %) at least one author disclosed
relevant FCOI (median: 6.5 %, IQR: 0 %, 66.7 %), while
in one guideline (3.6 %) all authors disclosed relevant
FCOI. In eight guidelines (28.6 %), over half of the au-
thors declared relevant FCOI (Table 1).
The majority of guidelines identified affiliations with
organizations (26/28, 93.0 %). In total, 39 organizations
were found. Nineteen of the 39 organizations (49.0 %)
identified financial relationships with pharmaceutical
companies on their respective websites. In eight guide-
lines (26.0 %), at least one drug recommended for first-
line treatment was manufactured by a pharmaceutical
company listed on the affiliated organizations’ website
(see Additional file 3).
Discussion
In this study of 28 Canadian guidelines produced or re-
vised since the start of 2012, we found that FCOI rela-
tionships between guideline authors and drug companies
are common. Authors disclosed FCOI with drug com-
panies in 21 guidelines (75.0 %). Relevant financial ties
are also common amongst guideline authors, as authors
in 15 guidelines (54.0 %) reported FCOI with manufac-
turers of drugs that they recommend as first-line treat-
ments. Twenty authors on two or three guidelines
disclosed different FCOI in their statements. Eight
guidelines identified affiliated organizations that had fi-
nancial relationships with drug companies that manufac-
tured drugs recommended for first-line treatment.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to systematic-
ally describe FCOI disclosures by authors on Canadian
guidelines, as well as the financial relationships between
the guideline-affiliated organizations and pharmaceutical
companies. We used a population approach to guideline
inclusion and did not exclude guidelines based on med-
ical specialty or disease category.
This study contributes to existing international studies
on FCOI disclosures across medical specialties, which
have produced results similar to our findings. Cosgrove
and colleagues found that in three psychiatry guidelines,
18 of 20 (90 %) authors held FCOI with pharmaceutical
companies and none of these ties were disclosed in the
guideline. On two of the three guidelines assessed,
100 % of the working group members possessed FCOI
[6]. Neuman and colleagues found that in 14 guidelines
on screening and/or treatment for hyperlipidaemia or
diabetes published by national Canadian and American
organizations between 2000 and 2010, 138 out of 288
(48.0 %) panel members reported FCOI [25].
In a study analyzing 17 cardiovascular guidelines,
Mendelson and colleagues found that 277 out of 498
(56.0 %) authors reported FCOI [20]. A 2013 study by
Norris and colleagues found that in 13 guidelines for

 glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus from the
National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC), the percent-
age of authors who disclosed one or more FCOI ranged
from 0 to 94 % [16]. A 2013 Danish study found that
135 out of 254 (53.1 %) authors on 45 guidelines held
FCOI and although FCOI were common, disclosures
were rare [2].
We believe that our results provide a conservative esti-
mate of the prevalence of FCOI disclosed by guideline
authors as we did not conduct external web or publica-
tion searches to determine the completeness of the
FCOI disclosures in the guidelines. Our exclusion of 40
guidelines based on their lack of both FCOI disclosure
sections and corresponding author contact information
reflects findings that guidelines commonly contain no
information about potential FCOI [26].
Finally, consistent with related research [2, 27], 20 au-
thors on two or three guidelines that we assessed dis-
closed
different
FCOI
in
their
disclosures.
These
inconsistencies may be due to five factors: (i) journals in
which these guidelines were published may have had dif-
ferent FCOI disclosure policies and requirements, (ii)
endorsing professional medical societies and associa-
tions, as well as the medical journals in which CPGs are
published, may have had differing policies on FCOI dis-
closure and permitted relationships, (iii) authors may
have engaged in new FCOI relationships in the time be-
tween publishing guidelines, (iv) FCOI declarations may
have been incomplete or missing completely, and (v) re-
liance on voluntary reporting of FCOI by authors may
have resulted in underreporting of these relationships
because of the subjective decisions of individual authors
[2, 28, 29].
Limitations
We excluded guidelines if either authors or committee
members were not explicitly named, limiting the scope
of our analysis. Additionally, our analyses accounted for
neither drugs that were recommended for second- or
third-line treatment, nor the strength of evidence used
to make first-line drug recommendations. We did not
differentiate among the types of FCOI that the authors
disclosed. Finally, we did not consider the funding
source(s) of the guidelines. Our results are preliminary
since our sample size of guidelines is limited.
Conclusions
Our findings support the need for future research to
measure not only the prevalence, but also underreport-
ing of FCOI in guidelines. Our results also suggest a
need for accurate and consistent disclosures. Future re-
search is also necessary to determine whether guideline
authors’ reported FCOI are associated with their drug
treatment guideline recommendations.
After the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in
Germany (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen
Medizinischen
Fachgesellschaften,
AWMF)
instituted
new disclosure rules in 2010, the prevalence of guide-
lines with disclosures increased from 8 to 95 % in 2011.
This reform requires guideline-creating groups to ensure
that both their members’ declarations and the proce-
dures used to declare, document, and the disclosures
themselves are made public [26].
Physicians tend to have confidence in, and attribute
value to, guidelines issued or distributed by official pro-
fessional associations [30]. Therefore, we encourage pro-
fessional associations including the CMA to consider
developing
a
policy
equivalent
to
that
which
was
adopted by the AWMF on FCOI disclosures and we rec-
ommend that the CMA refuse to list any CPGs that do
not conform to these standards.
