Abstract 
This study investigated the impact of raising plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) through ingestion 
of ketone salts on substrate oxidation and performance during cycling exercise. Ten healthy adult males 
(23 ± 3 years, BMI 25 ± 3 kg/m2, VO2peak 45 ± 10 ml/kg/min) were recruited to complete two 
experimental trials. Before enrollment in the experimental conditions, baseline anthropometrics and 
cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) were assessed and familiarization to the study protocol was 
provided. On experimental days, participants reported to the laboratory in the fasted state and 
consumed either 0.3 g/kg β-OHB ketone salts or a flavor-matched placebo 30 minutes prior to 
engaging in cycling exercise. Subjects completed steady-state exercise at 30%, 60%, and 90% 
ventilatory threshold (VT) followed by a 150 kJ cycling time trial. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) 
and total substrate oxidation were derived from indirect calorimetry. Plasma glucose, lactate, and 
ketones were measured at baseline, 30 minutes post-supplement, post-steady-state exercise, and 
immediately following the time trial. Plasma β-OHB was elevated from baseline and throughout the 
entire protocol in the ketone condition (p<0.05). RER was lower at 30% and 60% VT in the ketone 
compared to control condition. Total fat oxidation was greater in the ketone versus control (p=0.05). 
Average time trial power output was ~7% lower (-16 Watts, p=0.029) in the ketone condition. 
Ingestion of ketone salts prior to exercise increases fat oxidation during steady state exercise but 
impairs high-intensity exercise performance.

Introduction 
The recent development of exogenous ketone supplements that can raise blood beta-hydroxybutyrate 
(β-OHB) concentration has garnered considerable attention as an ergogenic aid (Cox et al. 2016; Egan 
and D’agostino, 2016; Pinckaers et al. 2016). β-OHB is the most abundant circulating ketone body that 
can serve, among other things, as a source of energy for skeletal muscle (Cox and Clarke 2014).  
Recently, Cox and colleagues (2016) described the novel effects of exogenous ketone supplements on 
oxidative metabolism during cycling exercise. Specifically, acute elevation of plasma β-OHB after 
ingesting nutritional ketone ester supplements led to apparent ketone oxidation and enhanced 
intramuscular triglyceride utilization, while preserving endogenous glycogen stores during exercise. 
These results demonstrate the potential metabolic benefit of nutritional ketones to provide an 
alternative oxidative fuel source, while simultaneously improving lipid utilization during exercise in 
humans. Mechanistically, the suppression of glycolysis during aerobic exercise after ingestion of 
nutritional ketones was attributed to an increase in acetyl-CoA concentrations, a higher NADH:NAD+ 
ratio from mitochondrial ketone oxidation, and subsequent inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Cox 
et al. 2016). This was evidenced by elevations of skeletal muscle β-OHB and increases in glycolytic 
intermediates seen in skeletal muscle biopsy samples, suggesting that exogenous ketones may have 
promoted a “Randle cycle-like” effect  to impair carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation and/or glycolysis 
during exercise (Randle et al. 1963).  
Given the importance of glycolysis for maintaining skeletal muscle ATP production during 
high-intensity exercise, the group also cautioned about using ketones in certain athletic events: “ketosis 
may not be advantageous in physiological conditions that rely almost solely on anaerobic glycolysis or 
high glycolytic flux for ATP production, such as sprint or short-duration exercise” (Cox et al. 2016). 
The potential for acute nutritional ketosis to inhibit CHO oxidation and affect performance during high 
workloads is currently unclear, although “forcing” muscle towards greater lipid oxidation could 
theoretically reduce performance during high-intensity exercise.

At present, ketone ester supplements are not commercially available. However, β-OHB ketone 
salts are available and are marketed to increase fat oxidation and enhance high-intensity exercise 
performance. We are unaware of any published data on the impact of β-OHB ketone salts on exercise 
metabolism or high-intensity performance. Accordingly, we examined whether β-OHB ketone salts 
influenced substrate utilization during steady-state exercise and assessed their impact on high-intensity 
exercise performance.   
 
Methods 
Participants 
Ten males were recruited and provided written informed consent. All participants were considered 
healthy, recreationally active (exercising at least three times per week but not specifically training for 
endurance sports), and reported no contraindications to exercise. Participants were not currently taking 
medication, following a low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet, or currently consuming nutritional ketone 
supplements. Physical characteristics included; age 23 ± 3 years, BMI 25 ± 3 kg/m2, body mass 83 ± 13 
kg, VO2peak 45 ± 10 ml/kg/min, peak power output 299 ± 60 W. The study was conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the University of British Columbia 
Clinical Research Ethics Board (registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02825823). 
 
Study Design 
A double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design was employed consisting of baseline testing, 
familiarization, and two experimental trials. Subjects completed a maximal oxygen uptake test and 
anthropometrics were measured for baseline characteristics. As not all participants explicitly achieved a 
plateau in VO2, the highest oxygen uptake value was recorded and considered the VO2peak (Howley et 
al. 1995). A familiarization trial was completed on a separate visit from baseline prior to completion of 
the experimental conditions. Familiarization trials were identical to experimental trials except that

 Draft
participants were not fasted and consumed no supplement drink prior to exercise. After familiarization, 
participants then completed two experimental conditions (ketone or placebo), the order of which were 
completed in a randomized and counterbalanced fashion separated by ~7 days (range 4-9). 
 
Baseline Testing 
Upon entrance to the laboratory, height and weight were measured to determine body mass index of 
subject. VO2peak testing was used to assess aerobic capacity and determine ventilator threshold values. 
Participant engaged in a ramped-protocol on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (Lode Ergometer 
Manager, Groningen, The Netherlands). The test began at 50 W for 4 minutes, followed by a 1 W 
increase every 3 seconds (20 W/min) until volitional fatigue. Expired gas was analyzed by a metabolic 
cart (TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Measurement System, Parvo Medic, Murray, United States of America). 
Individual ventilatory threshold (VT) was determined using the V-slope method from the baseline 
VO2peak test. 
 
Supplement 
Ketone salts were acquired from a commercially available ketone supplement (KetoForce®, Prototype 
Nutrition, Urbana, United States of America). The ketone supplement contained 0.3g β-OHB/kg, 0.01g 
Potassium/kg, and 0.01g Sodium/kg. Placebo drink contained 0.01g Potassium/kg, 0.01g Sodium/kg. 
Each drink was mixed with 30 ML of lemon juice and 14 mg stevia lead extract in order to maintain 
blind. Both drinks were consumed in 500 mL of water. 
 
Experimental Trials 
Participants reported fasted on experimental testing days and were given either a commercially 
available ketone supplement or a flavor-matched placebo. Thirty minutes after consumption 
participants completed a three-stage steady-state incremental exercise protocol comprised of five

 Draft
minutes of cycle ergometer exercise at each of 30%, 60%, and 90% of individual ventilatory threshold. 
Metabolic gases were collected throughout each stage using a metabolic cart. Five minutes after 
completion of steady-state exercise, participants completed a simulated 150 kJ time trial. The 
ergometer was set in linear mode and the time trial was equated to a distance of 10 km by the 
associated software program (Lode Ergometer Manager, Groningen, The Netherlands). Participants 
received visual feedback as “distance covered” on a computer monitor. Time to completion and 
average power output were recorded after each test. Coefficient of variation (CV) for time trials in our 
lab is 2.6% based on two tests performed 3-7 days apart (n=6 males). At the end of each trial, 
participants were asked to guess which condition they completed that day (ketone or placebo). 
Participants recorded their diet on the day prior to the first experimental trial and were instructed to 
replicate food intake before the second, which was verified by a research assistant upon arrival at the 
laboratory.  
 
Metabolic Gases 
Gas samples were collected throughout the steady-state cycle. The final two minutes of gas collection 
from each steady-state stage were analyzed. The proportion of CHO and fat fuel oxidation during 
steady-state cycling was calculated from the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), with the assumption that 
protein metabolism was negligible. Substrate oxidation rates were calculated from indirect calorimetry 
measurements (Jeukendrup and Wallis 2005).  
 
Blood Sampling and Analysis 
Blood β-OHB and glucose (Precision Neo, Abbott Laboratories, Witney, UK) and lactate (Lactate Pro, 
Arkray, Kyoto, Japan) were measured in capillary blood. Fingertip capillary samples were collected 
using a lancet following cleaning with alcohol and allowing to air dry. The first blood droplet was 
wiped away with a cotton swab and the subsequent droplets were used for analysis. Blood samples

were measured at baseline, 30 minutes post-supplement ingestion, post steady-state exercise, and at the 
end of the time trial. 
 
Statistical Analysis 
All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v6. Differences between conditions for mean power 
output in the time trial were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA accounting for the order 
effect. Mean power output data were log-transformed prior to analysis to express effects as percentage 
differences between conditions. Effects are presented together with 95% confidence intervals (CI), 
which indicate a range of effects compatible with the data. A priori, we defined thresholds for small, 
moderate, large, and extremely large differences in mean power output as 0.3, 0.9, 1.6, 2.5 and 4.0 × 
the typical within-athlete CV from competition-to-competition, in line with contemporary guidelines 
for analyses of exercise performance data (Hopkins et al. 2009). For road cycling time trials this CV is 
approximately 3.5% (Malcata and Hopkins 2014). Differences between conditions in respiratory 
exchange ratio (RER), β-OHB, glucose, and lactate were analyzed using 2-factor (condition X time) 
repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with significant main effects and/or interactions 
followed by Sidak’s post-hoc test comparing ketone to placebo at each time point. Differences in 
substrate oxidation were analyzed with a paired t-test. Significance was set at p<0.05. Data are reported 
as mean ± SD unless otherwise noted.  
 
Results  
Substrate Utilization  
RER was lower during exercise in the ketone compared to the control condition (main effect of 
condition, p<0.001). Post-hoc tests revealed significantly lower RER at 30% and 60% VT in the ketone 
condition (both p<0.05; Fig 1A). Total fat oxidation was greater (p=0.02), and total CHO oxidation 
lower (p=0.005) during exercise in the ketone condition versus placebo (Fig 1B). Plasma β-OHB

increased from baseline in the ketone condition (condition X time interaction, p<0.001) and levels were 
elevated throughout the entire protocol versus placebo (p<0.05 for all; Fig 2A). Glucose was lowered in 
the ketone condition (main effect of condition, p=0.002) with post-hoc tests indicating that glucose was 
lower immediately post-exercise and post-time trial in the ketone condition compared to placebo (both 
p<0.05; Fig 2B). Blood lactate rose from baseline during exercise (main effect of time, p<0.0001) but 
there were no significant differences seen between conditions at any time point (Fig 2C). Participants 
were accurate at correctly predicting the designated condition (ketone or placebo) 50% of the time, 
indicating that the ketone supplement was adequately masked. 
 
Performance  
It took participants longer to complete the time trial in the ketone condition (711±137 seconds) when 
compared to the control condition (665±120 seconds, p=0.03). Average power output during the time 
trial was 74±8 % power at VO2peak (101±22% VT) in the ketone condition compared to 79±14% 
(107±21% VT) in the placebo (p=0.012). Average power output in the cycling time trial was on 
average ~7% (-16 Watts, p=0.029) lower in the ketone versus placebo condition (95% CI, -12% to -1%, 
Fig 3). The point estimate of 7% represents a large effect with the confidence interval ranging from a 
small to very large decrement in performance.  
 
Discussion 
Our findings provide evidence that ketone salts can alter the metabolic response during steady-state 
exercise. A lower respiratory ratio and greater total fat oxidation during steady-state cycling in the 
nutritional ketone condition compared to placebo suggests the role of β-OHB in promoting lipid 
utilization during aerobic exercise. These findings are in agreement with Cox et al. (2016), who 
observed an increase in intramuscular triglyceride oxidation and reduction in glycolytic intermediates 
during one hour of steady-state cycling at 75% maximal power in elite athletes following consumption

of ketone ester supplements. Mechanistically, β-OHB may provide acetyl-CoA groups and thus 
increase the acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio leading to feedback inhibition of glycolysis (Randle et al. 1963). 
Inhibition of glycolysis necessitates a greater reliance of lipid oxidation to support ATP demand at a 
given exercise intensity. Previous reports using ketone esters in elite athletes provide support for an 
increase in lipid oxidation during sub-maximal cycling exercise (Cox et al. 2016).  
We were unable to directly measure β-OHB oxidation in the present study but the reduction in RER at 
30% VT (from ~0.85 in the placebo condition to ~0.83 in the ketone condition, Fig 1A) support the 
notion that lipid utilization was increased when plasma β-OHB was elevated. The theoretical RER for 
oxidizing β-OHB is 0.89 (Frayn 1983); it would therefore be expected that the RER would be increased 
(“pulled up”) closer to 0.89 at 30% VT in the ketone condition if the increase in circulating β-OHB was 
simply leading to an increase in β-OHB oxidation. However it is currently unknown how provision of 
exogenous ketones might impact substrate oxidation equations, which are theoretically based on CHO 
and lipid substrates. 
In line with the speculation that high-intensity exercise performance could be impaired with 
elevated ketones (Cox et al. 2016; Pinckaers et al. 2017), we observed that average power output 
during the time trial was reduced in the ketone versus placebo condition. A high degree of CHO 
oxidation to support ATP demand is necessary to maintain the workload during the time trial as 
supported by blood lactate values of ~10 mmol/l at the end of the time trial (Fig 1E). Attenuation of 
CHO metabolism during high-intensity exercise by ketone salts is likely to reduce power output during 
heavy workloads as seen here.  
Blood glucose was significantly lower in the ketone condition post steady-state exercise and 
following the time-trial (albeit by a small magnitude of ~0.3-0.7 mmol/l lower than the placebo 
condition). These findings are consistent with reports from Cox et al. (2016) where blood glucose was 
lowered during steady-state cycling exercise after ingestion of ketone ester supplements compared to 
consumption of CHO or fat. Interestingly, these authors did not report an elevation in insulin following

ketone ester supplement ingestion, which is in contrast to some previous experiments showing that 
infused ketones lead to lowered glucose primarily through insulinotropic effects  (Biden and Taylor 
1983; Miles et al. 1981). It is possible that there are differences in responses to ingested ketone 
supplements as opposed to infused ketones. As we did not measure insulin in this study we cannot 
speculate as to the mechanism(s) underlying the reductions in glucose seen following exercise in the 
ketone condition. Nonetheless, reductions in plasma glucose may have influenced performance during 
the time trial as low blood glucose is known to impair exercise performance through limiting 
availability of CHO (Coyle 1999).  
Relatively similar blood lactate values were found in both conditions despite lower CHO 
oxidation in the ketone condition. However, since we did not obtain muscle biopsy samples we cannot 
confirm if ketone salts altered the rate of glycolysis or lactate production directly in muscle, as shown 
by Cox et al. (2016) following ingestion of ketone ester supplements. It is possible that glycolysis was 
impaired, yet blood lactate levels were similar, because skeletal muscle and blood lactate are not 
perfectly correlated (Saltin et al. 1974). Indeed, interpretation of the blood lactate data is limited to the 
overall concentration of circulating lactate, and does not provide any information on  the rate of lactate 
production or clearance by skeletal muscle. Additionally, the measurements do not account for hepatic 
lactate uptake, or the utilization of lactate by other organs (Okorie and Dellinger 2011). Future studies 
employing muscle biopsies will be needed to confirm the impairment in glycolysis seen by Cox et al. 
(2016) following ingestion of exogenous ketone supplements.  
Transport of β-OHB into skeletal muscle is mediated through several monocarboxylic 
transporter (MCT) systems (Newman and Verdin 2014). Previous reports have indicated that β-OHB 
uptake saturation in skeletal muscle occurs at 1-2 mmol/L in the resting state (Mikkelsen et al. 2014). 
In addition, maximal clearance rates of β-OHB begin to occur during exercise at concentrations of ~2 
mmol/L (Fery and Balasse 1986). These findings suggest that a plateau in β-OHB uptake into the 
tissues occurs at relatively low plasma concentrations of β-OHB, similar to those achieved by ingestion

of ketone salts in this study. Given that uptake of plasma lactate is also dependent on MCT1 
(McCullagh et al. 1996), it is possible that elevated circulating β-OHB may influence lactate transport. 
It is therefore plausible that, during exercise, the rate of lactate transport into skeletal muscle is reduced 
in states of ketosis due to competition for MCTs. This may partially explain why circulating lactate was 
not different in the ketone condition despite evidence of altered CHO metabolism.  
 
Previous studies have examined the impact of ketosis on exercise metabolism and performance 
by having participants follow a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (e.g., Fleming et al. 2003; 
Phinney et al. 1983). While such diets are successful in elevating plasma ketones through hepatic 
production, ketogenesis occurs at the expense of depleted intramuscular and liver glycogen. The 
performance effects of this dietary strategy are hotly debated (Burke et al. 2016) as reductions in high-
intensity exercise performance with low CHO availability are well documented (Fleming et al. 2003; 
Langfort et al. 1997). It is important to note that exogenous supplements, such as the β-OHB ketone 
salts used in the present study, increase circulating ketones without a significant reduction in CHO 
storage and therefore creates a metabolic environment in which both CHO and ketone substrates are 
readily available. Accordingly, such an elevation in blood β-OHB induced from exogenous sources as 
in this study may represent a markedly different response to exercise then a state of endogenous ketosis 
brought about by ketogenic diets (Evans et al. 2017). 
 Our investigations were performed in the fasted state and results may be different if CHO were 
consumed prior to or during exercise. Previous dosing strategies using both ketone esters and CHO 
have shown performance benefits during longer duration time trials in elite cyclists (Cox et al. 2016). 
In addition, preliminary data suggests the combination of ketones and CHO may provide a strategy for 
restoring of intramuscular glycogen concentrations (Holdsworth et al. 2017). We utilized ketone salts, 
which provide a racemic mixture of β-OHB and appear to result in lower concentrations of blood β-
OHB (~1-1.2 mM, Fig 1C) than the ketone ester supplements (~3 mM) (Cox et al. 2016).

In conclusion, our data complement the recent study by Cox et al. (2016) and support the 
hypothesis that elevating blood ketones through consumption of oral ketone supplements alters lipid 
and CHO metabolism during exercise in humans. Our findings provide the first evidence that raising β-
OHB through provision of ketone salts may impair high-intensity exercise performance. The 
underlying mechanisms for the performance impairment following ketone salt ingestion is not clear but 
based on lower CHO oxidation during exercise may be relating to inhibition of glycolysis, as postulated 
by others (Cox et al. 2016; Pinckaers et al. 2017). Future research is necessary to directly assess the 
effects of nutritional ketones on metabolism during high-intensity exercise and other situations that 
demand high rates of glycolysis to provide ATP.

Figure Captions 
Figure 1. Nutritional ketone salt supplementation increases fat oxidation and decreases 
carbohydrate oxidation during exercise. Recreationally active males (N=10) participated in two 
experimental trials involving pre-exercise consumption of nutritional ketone salts (0.3 g/kg β-
hydroxybutyrate [OHB]; Ketone) or Placebo. Supplements were consumed in the fasted state 30 
minutes prior to cycling exercise consisting of three 5-minute stages at 30%, 60%, and 90% ventilatory 
threshold (VT). Expired gas was collected throughout and the last two minutes of data were analyzed. 
A) Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was lower at 30% VT and 60% VT in the Ketone condition 
compared to Placebo. B) Total grams of fat oxidized were higher and total grams of carbohydrate 
oxidized were lower in the Ketone condition compared to Placebo. Values are means±SD. *Significant 
difference between Ketone and Placebo conditions (p<0.05).  
 
 
Figure 2. Impact of nutritional ketone salt supplementation on blood β-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, 
and lactate concentration. Recreationally active males (N=10) participated in two experimental trials 
involving pre-exercise consumption of nutritional ketone salts (0.3 g/kg β-hydroxybutyrate [OHB]; 
Ketone) or Placebo. Supplements were consumed in the fasted state 30 minutes prior to cycling 
exercise consisting of three 5-minute stages at 30%, 60%, and 90% ventilatory threshold (VT) followed 
by a 150 kJ cycling time trial. Finger stick blood samples were collected in the fasting state, 30 minutes 
post-supplementation, following the three 5-minute stages, and at the end of the time trial. A) Blood β-
OHB was higher 30 minutes post-supplement and remained elevated throughout exercise in the oral 
ketone condition. B) Blood glucose was lower at the end of steady state cycling exercise and 150 kJ 
time trial in the oral ketone supplement condition versus placebo. C) Blood lactate concentration rose 
during exercise but was not affected by oral ketone supplementation. Values are means±SD. 
*Significant difference between Ketone and Placebo conditions (p<0.05).

Figure 3. Nutritional ketone salt supplementation impairs performance during a 150 kilojoule 
cycling time trial. Recreationally active males (N=10) participated in two experimental trials involving 
pre-exercise consumption of nutritional ketone salts (0.3 g/kg β-hydroxybutyrate [OHB]; Ketone) or 
Placebo. Supplements were consumed in the fasted state 30 minutes prior to cycling exercise consisting 
of three 5-minute stages at 30%, 60%, and 90% ventilatory threshold (VT). Five minutes following 
steady state cycling, participants completed by a 150 kJ cycling time trial. Mean power output was 
significantly lower following consumption of oral ketones versus placebo (individual values are 
connected by lines with means for each conditions shown by bars). Values are means±SD. *Significant 
difference between Ketone and Placebo conditions (p<0.05).
