Results The metabolic risk profile improved only after 
the khorasan intervention period, as measured by a reduc-
tion in total and LDL cholesterol (mean reduction: −3.7 
and −3.4 %, respectively), insulin (−16.3 %) and blood 
glucose (−9.1 %). Similarly, there was a significant reduc-
tion in circulating levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-
1ra, and a significant increase of total antioxidant capacity 
(+6.3 %). No significant differences from baseline were 
noted after the modern control wheat intervention phase. 
The change (from pre- to post-intervention) between the 
two intervention arms was significantly different (p < 0.05) 
for total and LDL-c, insulin and HOMA index.
Conclusions A replacement diet with ancient khorasan 
wheat consumption provided additive protection in reduc-
ing total and LDL cholesterol, insulin, blood glucose, ROS 
production, and some inflammatory risk factors, which are 
all key factors warranting of control in secondary preven-
tion of T2DM compared to a diet with products made with 
modern wheat.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic condition 
characterized by excessive glucose levels, resulting from 
insulin resistance and/or decreased insulin secretion. 
T2DM has risen to epidemic proportions worldwide and 
is estimated to increase even further [1, 2]. A major chal-
lenge to the public health sector resides in the treatment 
Abstract 
Purposes The aim of the present study was to exam-
ine whether a replacement diet with products made with 
organic ancient khorasan wheat could provide additive 
protective effects in reducing glucose, insulin, lipid and 
inflammatory risk factors, and in restoring blood redox bal-
ance in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients compared 
to diet with product made with modern organic wheat.
Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blinded 
crossover trial with two intervention phases on 21 T2DM 
patients (14 females, 7 males). The participants were 
assigned to consume products (bread, pasta, crackers and 
biscuits) made using semi-whole flour from organic wheat 
that was either from ancient khorasan wheat or modern 
control wheat for 8 weeks in a random order. An 8-week 
washout period was implemented between the interven-
tions. Laboratory analyses were performed both at the 
beginning and at the end of each intervention phase.

of T2DM-derived micro- and macrovascular complications 
[1, 3]. This highlights the importance of secondary preven-
tion strategies aimed at minimizing endothelial cell dys-
function in T2DM patients, which is the underlying fac-
tor in vascular complications [1]. Hyperglycemia results 
in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in 
the stimulation of inflammatory marker cascades, which 
induce both endothelial cell dysfunction and insulin resist-
ance, which in turn enhance further hyperglycemia, ROS 
production and inflammation [1, 3]. Hence, lifestyle inter-
ventions aimed at reducing hyperglycemia, ROS produc-
tion and inflammation in T2DM patients are warranting of 
consideration. One such lifestyle intervention relates to the 
role of diet.
Initially, limited experimental evidence has been 
reported on the effectiveness of diet in secondary preven-
tion for diabetic patients [4]. However, in recent years, 
there has been increased impetus in investigating the role of 
diet in T2DM management. In the most recent systematic 
review with meta-analysis [2], the Mediterranean diet was 
shown to be associated with better glycemic control and 
improved cardiovascular risk than control diets.
Given that the present study is based in Italy, the pro-
posed importance of the Mediterranean diet in T2DM man-
agement is of interest. Of particular interest is the cereal 
component, which forms the basis of the Mediterranean 
dietary pyramid. Although carbohydrates (also derived 
from cereals) are generally viewed with some degree of 
trepidation by diabetics, the long-term risks of low carbo-
hydrate diets (usually combined with higher protein intake) 
are well-described and include mineral, vitamin and fiber 
deficiencies, and increased cardiovascular risk and related 
mortality [5]. However, the above-mentioned beneficial 
effects attributable to carbohydrates are dependent on the 
source (wholegrain cereals and not those with added fats, 
sugar and sodium) [5, 6]. Although evidence is inconclu-
sive for an ideal amount of carbohydrate intake for peo-
ple with diabetes [6], the emphasis is on the quality of the 
source. Of particular interest are the positive benefits on 
human health by ancient Triticum varieties and Triticum 
turgidum [7, 8] which could serve as a major carbohydrate 
source in the diet. In our previous study [9], a replacement 
diet with ancient khorasan wheat products on patients with 
acute coronary syndrome was shown to result in a signifi-
cant decrease in lipid and glucose profiles, generation of 
ROS and lipid peroxidation, as well as in some proinflam-
matory cytokines. These positive effects were conferred, 
irrespective of the number and combination of medicinal 
therapies with proven efficacy in secondary prevention.
Given that T2DM patients have an increased cardio-
vascular risk, and both chronic diseases share common 
risk factors, the aim of the present study was to investi-
gate whether a replacement diet with products made from 
ancient khorasan wheat products could provide additive 
protective effects on glycemic control, lipid, oxidative and 
inflammatory risk factors in T2DM patients.
Materials and methods
Study population
The study population was initially composed of 24 T2DM 
patients. Two patients, due to personal reasons (completely 
unrelated to the study), were unable to participate in the 
second phase of the project, and a further patient com-
plained of self-diagnosed wheat-related complications dur-
ing the first phase (notwithstanding the written consent pro-
vided at the outset). These three patients were, therefore, 
excluded from the study. The final study population was 
comprised of 21 T2DM patients (14 men; 7 women). The 
mean age was 64.4 ± 10.9 with a mean body mass index 
(BMI) of 27.9 ± 4.7 (Table 1). All patients were recruited 
on entry to the clinic following consultation at the Unit of 
Clinical Nutrition of the Department of Experimental and 
Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Careggi Univer-
sity Hospital.
T2DM was confirmed if at least one or more of the 
following were reported: (a) HbAc1 ≥6.5 %, (b) fasting 
plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), (c) 2-h plasma 
glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose 
tolerance test, and (d) a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/
dL (11.1 mmol/L) in patients with symptoms of hypergly-
cemia. The above-mentioned criteria were consistent with 
current criteria for the diagnosis of T2DM, according to 
the American Diabetes Association (2014). Exclusion cri-
teria included clinical manifestations of microvascular 
complications (retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy),

macrovascular complications (cardiovascular disease), 
inflammatory bowel disease, and excess alcohol intake, 
celiac disease, gluten-sensitivity and wheat allergies.
Patients were instructed not to alter their dietary or 
lifestyle habits, and written informed consent was then 
obtained from each participant before the start of the trial. 
The institutional review board at the University of Florence 
approved the study protocol.
Data collection and measurements
Patients underwent an interview, according to standardized 
methods, to obtain information about personal medical his-
tory, demographics, medication, and lifestyle habits. All 
information relating to the above-mentioned aspects served 
as descriptive supplementary information pertaining to the 
current study population, but was not used as a basis for 
patient exclusion.
Physicians, using standardized protocols, conducted a 
physical examination, blood pressure measurements, labora-
tory tests and a dietary survey. BMI was calculated as weight 
(kg)/height (m2). Participants that were smoking at the time 
of the physical examination were registered as smokers. If 
physical activity over the preceding 6 months did not meet 
certain criteria (based on duration and intensity), patients 
were then documented as having a sedentary lifestyle. 
Hypertension (raised blood pressure) was defined as systolic 
blood pressure 140 mmHg or more and/or diastolic blood 
pressure 90 mmHg, in accordance with the guidelines of the 
European Society of Cardiology. Dyslipidemia was defined 
according to the Third Report of the National Cholesterol 
Education Program (NCEP-III), or if patients reported taking 
anti-dyslipidemic drugs, as verified by the physician. Adher-
ence to a Mediterranean diet was evaluated from a ques-
tionnaire that included 3 categories of consumption (min 
0 points, max 2 points) for each food group (cereals, fruit, 
vegetables, legumes, olive oil, meat products, dairy products, 
fish and alcohol) representing the major constituents of the 
Mediterranean diet. The questionnaire permitted the assign-
ment of an overall score (min 0 points, max 18 points) to 
each patient, thereby ranking the degree of adherence [10].
Experimental and control wheat
The ancient experimental wheat utilized in the present 
study was organic KAMUT® khorasan wheat (Tritucum 
turgidum subsp. turanicum), provided by Kamut Enter-
prises of Europe (KEE), Belgium (from here on referred 
to as the khorasan wheat). KAMUT® is a registered trade-
mark of Kamut International, Ltd. and Kamut Enterprises 
of Europe, bvba and guarantees the wheat is pure ancient 
khorasan wheat and is organically grown and processed. 
As the control (from here on referred to as the control 
wheat), a mix of organic modern commercial Italian durum 
(T. durum) varieties and soft wheat (T. aestivum) varie-
ties, respectively, were used. Various reported biochemi-
cal parameters of the khorasan and control semolina and 
flour (Table 2) were determined as previously [8]. Given 
that different countries utilize different terminology to clas-
sify the different types of milled flour, we report the ash 
content (positively correlated to the extraction rate) for 
comparative purposes. Khorasan semolina (ash content 
1.10–1.35 %) and flour (ash content 1.0 %) were processed 
by Molino SIMA S.C.A.R.L. (Argenta, Ferrara, Italy). For 
the organic khorasan wheat, different milling procedures 
were employed to produce the granulated semolina (analo-
gous to semi-whole wheat semolina) and flour (analogous 
to semi-whole wheat flour), respectively, thereby resulting 
in differences in ash content. For the control, semi-whole-
wheat granulated semolina (ash content 1.0–1.35 %) and 
semi-whole wheat flour (ash content 0.95 %), respectively, 
were similarly processed by Molino SIMA.

Pastificio Artigiano FABBRI s.a.s. (Strada in Chianti, 
Firenze, Italy) prepared the pasta (with no additives) from 
both the khorasan and control semolina, according to the 
artisan manufacturing procedures. The artisan enterprise 
of Panificio Menchetti Pietro di Santi e Figli s.n.c. (Cesa 
Marciano della Chiana, Arezzo, Italy) prepared the bread, 
biscuits and crackers using the khorasan and control flour. 
Naturally, leavened Tuscan-style sourdough bread was 
prepared. Besides the flour composition, dry crackers con-
tained 20 % extra-virgin olive oil. The biscuits were pre-
pared using 10 % sugar, 5 % butter, and one egg per 100 g 
flour.
Study design
The study was a randomized, double-blinded, crosso-
ver trial aimed at testing whether a replacement diet with 
khorasan wheat products and/or control wheat products 
could provide additive benefits to T2DM patients. For 
this reason, other cereals were excluded from the diet and 
“replaced” by either the khorasan or control products dur-
ing the respective intervention phases. The food products 
were packaged with no labels attached to the packages, 
and patients were informed that all products to be admin-
istered were organic and prepared by artisan methods. The 
patients were randomly divided into two groups (Group A 
and Group B), and a crossover study design with two inter-
vention phases was implemented. The first intervention 
phase was initiated in late January 2015, with Group A and 
B, respectively, initiating the trial with organic khorasan 
and control products. Participants in both groups received 
500 g/week of pasta, 150 g/day of bread, 250 g/week 
of crackers, and 250 g/week of biscuits for a period of 
8 weeks. Patients were advised to eat the products accord-
ing to their normal cereal consumption habits, which were 
documented at baseline. A washout period of 8 weeks was 
then affected, during which patients were permitted to eat 
all foods according to their “normal” dietary habits. The 
second intervention phase of 8 weeks was initiated in 
early May 2015, and Group A and B crossed-over to con-
sume the control and khorasan products, respectively. On 
average, patient’s daily intake of both khorasan and con-
trol semolina was 62 g dry weight, whereas daily intake 
of khorasan or control flour (from all the products con-
sumed) amounted to 140 g dry weight. The energy (kcal) 
provided by semolina and flour was 221 and 501 kcal, 
respectively, making a total of 722 kcal (50–55 % of daily 
energy intake) replaced in this intervention. At baseline 
and after each intervention, all subjects were examined 
between 7:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. after an overnight fasting 
period. Furthermore, subjects were asked not to engage 
in strenuous physical activity during the day before the 
examination.
Laboratory measurements
Venous blood samples were collected into evacuated plastic 
tubes (Vacutainer). Samples were centrifuged at 3000g for 
15 min (4 °C) and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until further 
analysis. Cholesterol subtypes, triglycerides, glucose, insu-
lin, HbA1c, and serum electrolytes were assessed accord-
ing to conventional methods. Pro- and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines were determined by using the Bio-Plex cytokine 
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA), 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Assessment of ROS production and total antioxidant 
capacity
Leukocyte (lymphocyte, monocyte and granulocyte) ROS 
generation was measured as reported previously [8, 9]. 
Similarly, fatty acid peroxidation was determined by meas-
uring malondialdehyde (MDA) using the thiobarbituric 
acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay kit (Oxitek-Zep-
toMetrix Corporation Buffalo, NY, USA). Total antioxi-
dant capacity (TAC), accounting for total hydrophilic ROS 
scavengers, was measured using the ORAC assay (oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity), based on the inhibition of 
the peroxyl-radical-induced oxidation initiated by thermal 
decomposition of azo-compounds, like 2,2-azobis (2-ami-
dinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), was performed as 
previously described [11].
Statistical analysis
The statistical package PASW 20.0 for Macintosh (SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was utilized. Results were 
expressed either as mean ± SD or as median and range. 
One-way ANOVA was used for testing differences between 
khorasan and control flour and semolina. The analyses 
were simplified by calculating the absolute change for each 
variable tested (mean value at baseline subtracted from the 
mean value after intervention for each subject) with inde-
pendent t sample tests. All data were treated as paired sam-
ples from a crossover study. Data that were not normally 
distributed were logarithmically transformed. The two 
interventions were analyzed by taking into account both 
phases in the two groups of subjects at different stages. 
Data were analyzed by using paired t tests for significant 
differences between changes observed during test and con-
trol intervention periods. Moreover, in order to compare 
the effect of organic khorasan products versus baseline 
and versus the control products, a general linear model for 
repeated measurements, after adjustment for age and gen-
der, modifiable risk factors, diet quality, and antidiabetic 
medication was performed. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was con-
sidered to indicate statistical significance.

Results
Study population
Baseline characteristics of the study population, including 
time since the onset of T2DM, traditional cardiovascular 
risk factors, lifestyle habits, medications, and diet quality 
are presented in Table 1. Nearly two-thirds of the popu-
lation was sedentary, and the vast majority consumed 1.5 
portions (200 g) of cereals a day. All the patients were 
under pharmacological treatment for T2DM: 8 (38 %) 
took metformin, 9 (43 %) hypoglycemic, and 4 (19 %) 
DPP-4. The patients reported not having changed either 
medication or lifestyle habits (smoking, physical activity, 
adherence to Mediterranean diet) during the course of the 
study. At the end of the study, there were no significant dif-
ferences (p > 0.05) in body weight change between kho-
rasan and control arms (−0.3 ± 1.8 and −0.6 ± 1.2 kg, 
respectively).
Wheat characteristics
As reported in Table 2, total polyphenol content and anti-
radical power (ARP) were significantly higher in the kho-
rasan flour in comparison with the control flour. Magne-
sium, potassium and phosphorus were significantly higher 
in both the khorasan semolina and flour compared to that 
of the control. Higher levels of manganese and polyphe-
nols were recorded the khorasan semolina than in the con-
trol semolina, whereas higher levels of selenium and pro-
tein were recorded in the khorasan flour compared to the 
control.
Modifications in lipid and metabolic profiles
In order to evaluate the differences in change from pre- to 
post-intervention between khorasan and control groups, 
we applied a general linear model adjusted for age, gen-
der, BMI, hypertension, diet score, and anti-diabetic drugs. 
There were significant differences between study arms 
regarding the absolute changes in total and LDL choles-
terol, insulin, and HOMA index. As reported in Table 3, 
serum levels of total cholesterol (−3.7 %), LDL cholesterol 
(−3.4 %), blood glucose (−9.1 %) and insulin (−16.3 %) 
significantly improved after the consumption of khorasan 
products. On the other hand, no significant effect was 
noted after the consumption of the control diet. Finally, we 
observed a trend for a significant increase of magnesium 
after the period of intervention with khorasan wheat, but 
the result did not reach the statistical significance when 
fully adjusted model was applied.
Modifications in blood redox status
Blood redox status, before and after each respective inter-
vention phase, was tested (Table 4). The difference for 
changes in TAC between the two study arms was statisti-
cally significant, as well as for granulocytes-derived ROS. 
TAC was significantly increased after the consumption of 
the khorasan wheat products and significantly decreased 
after the consumption of modern wheat products, whereas 
ROS production in both circulating granulocytes and 
monocytes was significantly reduced after the khorasan 
wheat replacement diet. No effect was evident after the 
consumption of control wheat products. Lymphocyte 
ROS production and the plasma levels of MDA remained 
unchanged after both the khorasan wheat and control die-
tary interventions.
Modifications in the inflammatory profile
After adjustment for age, gender, BMI, hypertension, diet 
score, and anti-diabetic drugs, significant decreases in only 
VEGF and IL-1ra were evident following the organic kho-
rasan replacement diet (Table 5). A slight but significant 
increase in IL-8 was evident after consumption of the con-
trol. No significant changes were reported for the remain-
ing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
Discussion
The present work is the second study that evaluated the 
functional efficacy of organic ancient khorasan wheat in a 
population with a chronic disease, notwithstanding the use 
of drug therapy. The incentive to investigate the effect of an 
organic ancient khorasan wheat replacement diet on T2DM 
patients was based on the positive benefits shown in our 
previous study on ACS patients [9]. In the current study, 
all patients were on effective glucose lowering therapies, 
with positive albeit variable medication-dependent pleio-
tropic effects reported for cholesterol and inflammatory 
markers [12, 13]. Given that medicinal therapy and lifestyle 
habits (smoking and sedentary lifestyle/physical exercise, 
Mediterranean diet adherence) were maintained constant 
throughout the trial, the study permitted the evaluation of 
beneficial changes attributable to a replacement diet with 
either the organic ancient khorasan or the organic modern 
control wheat. Here, we report a positive impact of kho-
rasan wheat products on blood insulin and glucose. With 
regard to insulin resistance (HOMA index), a reduction 
after the khorasan phase was observed. Moreover, the abso-
lute change between pre- and post-intervention was statis-
tically significant when compared with the change in the

control group. Nevertheless, the imbalance between the 2 
intervention groups in baseline values could bias this result.
Secondary prevention improvements, important in 
reducing the potential risk of vascular complications in 
T2DM patients, were also evident from the significant 
decrease in LDL cholesterol, granulocyte and monocyte 
ROS production (with a simultaneous improvement in 
plasma TAC), and proinflammatory IL-1ra and VEGF. 
Similar benefits were not evident after the consumption of 
the commercial modern wheat control. Given that T2DM 
patients have a considerably higher risk of cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality [14] and LDL is the predominant 
cholesterol risk factor, successful dietary/lifestyle treat-
ments aimed at reducing this parameter are warranting of 
attention in T2DM secondary prevention.
The present study further corroborates previous research 
from our group [8, 9, 15], demonstrating the health-pro-
moting benefits of organic ancient khorasan wheat, not 
evident in the organic modern control wheat. As outlined 
in previous studies, differences in protective effects were 
not attributable to the fact that khorasan wheat was organic 
semi-whole wheat, since the same patients also consumed 
the organic, semi-whole control wheat. Despite the recent 
benefits reported on Mediterranean diet (as a whole) in 
T2DM management [2], the present study demonstrates 
that the potential for further improvement, just by modify-
ing a single food component within the Mediterranean diet, 
namely substituting ancient cereals for modern cereals, is 
worthy of consideration. It is important to highlight that 
the beneficial effects observed in the present study from the 
khorasan wheat were on patients with a diagnosis of T2DM 
for an average of 3.6 years, without vascular complica-
tions and who were taking medication singularly. Whether 
similar benefits could be observed for T2DM patients in 
tertiary prevention on multiple medication remains to be 
investigated.
In line with our previous studies [8, 9, 15], khorasan 
wheat was found to be richer in macro- and microele-
ments, with slight but significantly higher levels of poly-
phenol secondary metabolites, particularly in comparison 
with the control modern soft wheat. The beneficial role 
of polyphenols in T2DM is receiving attention, and these 
benefits include: protection of pancreatic beta-cells against 
glucose toxicity, anti-inflammatory (modulation of NF-Kb, 
activation of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and VEGF) plus antioxidant 
effects, decreased starch digestion, inhibition of advanced 
glycation end product formation, and beneficial effects on 
gut microflora [16].
Control of hyperglycemia is one of the important sec-
ondary prevention strategies in T2DM. HbA1c, which is 
the ADA “gold standard” for glucose management in dia-
betic patients, remained unchanged. Given that HbA1c is 
linked to the life span of red blood cells, it is evident that

the duration of the present trial was too short to accurately 
determine HbA1c. On the other hand, notwithstanding 
effective medicinal therapies taken by all the participants, 
consumption of khorasan affected a significant decrease 
in insulin and glucose levels. It has been shown that low-
GI diets promote significantly improved lipid profiles in 
medium- and longer-term interventions, particularly with 
regard to lowered total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
levels [17–19]. Accordingly, the consumption of khorasan 
wheat products also resulted in a significant decrease in 
LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol. Alterations in lipid 
metabolism in T2DM (associated with IR) do not necessar-
ily affect LDL cholesterol levels, but the risk of LDL oxi-
dation, due to increased ROS and an impaired antioxidant 
scavenging system, is elevated [5, 12, 14].
A significant decrease in ROS production of circulating 
granulocytes and monocytes, after a replacement diet with 
khorasan wheat products, was evident. Moreover, there 
was a slight, but significant, increase in plasma TAC levels. 
This effect was not evident after the replacement diet with 
control products. Both monocytes and neutrophils (main 
constituent of granulocytes) are reported to be defective in 
almost all physiological functions of the diabetic patients, 
and granulocytes have been shown to be particularly vul-
nerable to oxidative stress damage in T2DM patients, not-
withstanding metformin usage [20]. Given that both leuko-
cyte types are sources of proinflammatory cytokines and 
that oxidative stress in T2DM is the common denominator 
for the major pathways involved in the development of dia-
betic complications [1], the efficacy of khorasan wheat in 
reducing ROS production is noteworthy.
In the present study, proinflammatory VEGF decreased 
significantly only after the consumption of khorasan wheat 
products. Circulatory baseline levels of VEGF in the 
T2DM patients of the present study were similar to those 
reported by Lim et al. [21] and were significantly higher 
than the baseline levels of the healthy asymptomatic con-
trols selected in both that study and that of Sofi et al. [8]. 
Interestingly, in our previous study on ACS patients [9], 
baseline VEGF levels were similar to those found in the 
present study, and the consumption of khorasan wheat 
products was also shown to effect a similar mean decrease, 
even if significance was not attained due the greater vari-
ation in VEGF levels. T2DM-induced hyperglycemia and 
resultant oxidative stress stimulate the upregulation of 
VEGF, thereby redirecting the physiological role of VEGF 
toward that of a pathological nature resulting in exces-
sive angiogenesis [3]. Overexpressed VEGF is a proven 
causative agent in increased permeability of endothelial 
cells (leakage), and in regulating subsequent inflamma-
tory responses, resulting in the progression of vascular 
diabetic complications [3]. Hence, strategies aimed at 
reducing VEGF levels are considered to have therapeutic 
significance in the secondary prevention care of diabetes 
[3]. Hence, the consumption of healthy food products, 
such as those made from khorasan wheat, may provide 
some relief as healthy alternative risk management in 
reducing VEGF levels.
The present study was subjected to limitations. The size 
of the patient population was small, and the study will have 
to be conducted on a larger population to verify results. 
Furthermore, blood pressure variations were not taken into 
account. However, the advantage was there was a range of 
response for traditional risk factors for vascular compli-
cations in this small T2DM population, and despite this 
variation, there were overall significant changes in various 
parameters, which could then be independently attributed 
to the replacement diet. Body weight did not change signif-
icantly after the trial showing that patients adhered to their 
normal consumption of carbohydrates and that the benefi-
cial effects were not associated with weight loss, but with 
the type of grain consumed.
In conclusion, a replacement diet with organic ancient 
khorasan wheat products was effective in improving total 
and LDL cholesterol, blood insulin, HOMA index, ROS 
production (with a simultaneous improvement in plasma 
TAC), and proinflammatory IL-1ra and VEGF. Despite the 
pleiotropic effects of the medication, organic ancient kho-
rasan consumption within an already beneficial Mediter-
ranean diet provides additive protection in reducing hyper-
glycemia, ROS production and inflammation in T2DM, 
which are key areas warranting of control in secondary 
prevention.
