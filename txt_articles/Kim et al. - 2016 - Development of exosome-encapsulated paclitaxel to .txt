Abstract
Exosomes have recently come into focus as “natural nanoparticles” for use as drug delivery 
vehicles. Our objective was to assess the feasibility of an exosome-based drug delivery platform 
for a potent chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel (PTX), to treat MDR cancer. Herein, we developed 
and compared different methods of loading exosomes released by macrophages with PTX 
(exoPTX), and characterized their size, stability, drug release, and in vitro antitumor efficacy. 
Reformation of the exosomal membrane upon sonication resulted in high loading efficiency and 
sustained drug release. Importantly, incorporation of PTX into exosomes increased cytotoxicity 
more than 50 times in drug resistant MDCKMDR1 (Pgp+) cells. Next, our studies demonstrated a 
nearly complete co-localization of airway-delivered exosomes with cancer cells in a model of 
murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma pulmonary metastases, and a potent anticancer effect in this mouse 
model. We conclude that exoPTX holds significant potential for the delivery of various 
chemotherapeutics to treat drug resistant cancers.

Exosomes released by autologous macrophages were loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) upon 
ultrasound treatment. The obtained formulation (exoPTX) showed a high loading capacity, 
sustained drug release, profound ability to accumulate in resistant cancer cells, and increased 
cytotoxicity compared to PTX in vitro and in vivo.

BACKGROUND
The recently emerged field of nanotechnology holds great promise for developing drug 
delivery systems with targeting and controlled-release characteristics for cancer treatment; 
there have been many new advances and innovations made in this field during the past 
decade (1). A large proportion of chemotherapeutic drugs have low aqueous solubility, 
consequently requiring the use of specialized delivery vehicles (liposome, polymeric 
nanoparticles, etc.) for parenteral administration. Regrettably, many of these synthetic drug 
delivery vehicles cause severe side effects, including organ toxicity and/or immune 
response.
Another factor that considerably limits the efficacy of chemotherapeutics is multiple drug 
resistance (MDR), which may be intrinsic or acquired (2, 3), and is mediated by different 
mechanisms, in particular, the overexpression of the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein 
(Pgp). As a result, the response rate following treatment remains very low for many types of 
malignancies, including, malignant gliomas, metastatic breast cancer, etc. (2-4). To date, 
there has been limited success in overcoming drug resistance in cancers through the use of 
novel small molecule chemotherapeutics (5, 6), or nanoformulations of existing 
chemotherapeutics (7-9). These efforts did result in improved patient outcomes; however, 
the non-specific inhibition of Pgp frequently increased drug toxicity due to alteration of drug 
elimination pathways in the liver, kidney, etc. (10).
Exosomes are membrane-derived vesicles ~40 - 200 nm in diameter (11) that can be found 
in extracellular bodily fluids (e.g. urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid) and in conditioned cell 
culture media (12). They are formed in multivesicular bodies (MVB) inside the cells (5, 12). 
Exosomes naturally function as intercellular messengers, carrying RNA and proteins (13). 
Recently, exosomes have begun to be explored for use as drug delivery vehicles for nucleic 
acids (14-19), gene delivery (20), and small molecule drugs, such as curcumin (12, 21, 22), 
and doxorubicin (23). It was demonstrated that exosomes have the exceptional ability to 
interact with cellular membranes, and deliver their payload to target cells (24, 25). Several 
studies indicate that exosomes may have a specific cell tropism, according to their 
characteristics and origin, which can be used to target them to disease tissues and/or organs 
(26). Furthermore, collected from patients’ tissues or blood-born immunocytes, allogenic 
exosomes may have an immune privileged status, which allows for decreased drug clearance 
and immune responce compared to PEGylated nanoformulations (27). Thus, exosomes may 
function as an “invisibility cloak” for incorporated therapeutic agents, diminishing clearance

 by the mononuclear phagocyte system and concurrently increasing drug transport to target 
tissues. Thus, exosomes may comprise advantages of both synthetic nanocarriers and cell-
mediated drug delivery, avoiding the rapid clearance and toxicity associated with synthetic 
vehicles, as well as the complexity in utilizing cell-mediated drug delivery systems in clinic. 
These unique features make exosomes an attractive option for use as a drug delivery vehicle 
for cancer treatment.
Herein, we have developed a new exosome-based formulation of PTX, a commonly used 
chemotherapeutic agent. The main objectives of this study were: (i) prepare and characterize 
a new formulation of exosomes loaded with PTX (exoPTX), (ii) assess the feasibility of 
using exoPTX for MDR-related anticancer therapy, and (iii) identify mechanisms underlying 
the effects of exoPTX in MDR cancer cells. Our results indicate that exosomes may 
represent a promising novel delivery platform for treatment of MDR neoplasms.
METHODS
Reagents
PTX and Doxorubicin (DOX) was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). 
Lipophilic fluorescent dyes, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindo-carbocyanine 
perchlorate (DIL), and 2-decanoyl-1-(O-(11-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-
s-indacene-3-propionyl-amino)undecyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (BODIPY-PC), were 
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA,) and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), 
respectively. Rhodamine 123 (R123), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride 
(DAPI), and Triton X-100 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,). Cell culture 
medium and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Gibco Life Technologies, 
(Grand Island, NY). Fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (Fluoro-Max G100) were 
obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). ExoQuick-TC™ Exosome 
Precipitation Solution was obtained from System Biosciences (Mountain View, CA).
Cells
RAW 264.7 macrophages, Madin-Darby canine kidney MDCKWT and MDCKMDR1 cells 
were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s 
medium (DMEM) high glucose (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin and 
streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2. Murine Lewis lung carcinoma cell subline (3LL-M27), a 
highly metastatic lung clone, was a generous gift from Dr. L. Pelletier (CHUL, Laval 
University, QC, Canada).
Pgp protein levels in sensitive and resistant cancer cells were determined by western blot as 
previously reported (28) using monoclonal antibodies to Pgp, C219 (Dako Corp., 
Carpinteria, CA; at dilution 1:100), and secondary horseradish peroxide donkey anti-mouse 
IgG antibodies (Amersham Life Sciences, Cleveland, OH; at dilution 1:1500). To correct for 
loading differences, the Pgp levels were normalized to the constitutively expressed β-actin 
stained with anti-β-1-chicken integrin (Sigma Chemical Co., at dilution 1:200). Specific 
bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

 Characterization of Exosomes
Exosomes were harvested from the conditioned media of RAW 264.7 cells cultured in 
exosome-depleted media using the ExoQuick-TC™ Kit (System BioSciences; Mountain 
View, CA) and characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), Dynamic Light 
Scattering (DLS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Western Blot Analysis as described 
previously (29).
BODIPY-PC was used as a probe to examine the fluidic properties of exosomal membranes 
as described earlier (30). Briefly, 30 μL exosomes with a concentration of 4×1011 
particles/mL were mixed with 20 μL BODIPY-PC (0.03 mg/ml) (31) and supplemented with 
70 μL deionized water; the mixture was incubated for 45 min at 37°C in the dark. Unbound 
label was removed using a ZebaTM column (Life Technologies).
Drug Loading into Exosomes
For PTX and DOX loading into exosomes, purified exosomes (~1011 exosomes) were first 
mixed with PTX or DOX in 1 mL PBS. Different methods of drug loading were 
investigated: incubation at room temperature (RT), electroporation, and sonication. For the 
incubation method, the admixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with shaking. For the 
electroporation method, exosomes were mixed with PTX and added to a chilled 4 mm 
electroporation cuvette. The mixture was then electroporated using an Eppendorf Eporator 
(Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 1000 kV for 5 ms, and then incubated at 37°C for 
30 min to allow for recovery of the exosomal membrane. For the sonication method, the 
PTX-exosome or DOX-exosome mixture was sonicated using a Model 505 Sonic 
Dismembrator with .25” tip with the following settings: 20% amplitude, 6 cycles of 30 s 
on/off for three minutes with a two minute cooling period between each cycle. After 
sonication, exoPTX or exoDOX solution were incubated at 37°C for 60 min to allow for 
recovery of the exosomal membrane. Excess free drug was separated from exoPTX or 
exoDOX by size exclusion chromatography using a NAP-10 Sephadex G25 column (GE 
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).
The amount of PTX loaded into exosomes was measured by a high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) method. Briefly, exoPTX (1010 exosomes/0.1mL) in a 
microcentrifuge tube was placed on a heating block set to 75°C to evaporate solvent. Then, 
an equal volume of acetonitrile was added and the mixture was vortexed, sonicated and then 
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (Thermo Legend Micro 21) for 10 min. Following centrifugation, 
the supernatant was taken and filtered through a Corning Regenerated Cellulose .2 μm 
syringe filter and transferred into HPLC autosampler vials. 20 μL aliquots were injected into 
the HPLC system (Agilent 1200, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). All analyses were 
performed using a C18 column (Supelco Nucleosil C18, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, 100 Å, 
Sigma-Aldrich,) with a mobile phase of H2O:acetonitrile (45:55, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 
mL/min at 30°C. Absorbance was measured at 227 nm to monitor the elution of PTX.
To measure PTX release, freshly prepared exoPTX were placed in a 300K MWCO Float-A-
Lyzer G2 device (Spectrum Laboratories, Houston, TX). The device was then placed in PBS 
under sink conditions at RT with stirring. Samples were taken at time points from inside the

 dialysis tube and were analyzed by HPLC as described above. The amount of PTX released 
from exoPTX was expressed as a percentage of total PTX and plotted as a function of time.
Accumulation of Exosomes and Exosome-incorporated PTX in Cancer Cells
To quantify the amount of exosomes taken up by cells, exosomes were stained with a 
lipophilic fluorescent dye, DIL as described previously (29). Then, DIL-labeled exosomes, 
or fluorescently-labeled liposomes, or polystyrene nanoparticles (NPs, Fluoro-Max G100, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific), were added in equal numbers (~108 particles/well) and incubated 
with 3LL-M27 cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 for various times. After each time point, the media 
was removed and cells were washed 3x with PBS and fixed by incubating with Formal-Fixx 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), and examined by confocal microscopy or using a Shimadzu 
RF5000 fluorescent spectrophotometer. In case of exoPTX or Taxol, drugs were added in 
equimolar amounts to the MDCKWT, or MDCKMDR1 cells and incubated for 72h. The cell 
suspension was then lysed and analyzed for PTX content by HPLC as described above.
In vitro Cytotoxicity Assay
The in vitro antitumor efficacy of exoPTX was assessed using a standard MTT (3-(4,5-
dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazoliumbromide) assay with three cancer cell 
lines, and compared to Taxol as described earlier (32). Briefly, cancer cells (MDCKMDR1, 
MDCKwt, and 3LL-M27) were seeded at 5,000 cells/well in 100 μL of media in 96-well 
plates overnight. Various concentrations of exosomes isolated from macrophages 
conditioned media and loaded with PTX by sonication, or empty sonicated exosomes, or 
Taxol, or PTX were added to cancer cells for 48 hours at 37C, 5% CO2. Following the 
incubation, the cells were washed and incubated with MTT reagent as described in (33). The 
cytotoxic activity of PTX was then evaluated using a standard MTT assay (34). The 
absorbance at 570nm was measured using a Shimadzu RF5000 fluorescent 
spectrophotometer. The survival values were determined in relation to control cells cultured 
in drug-free media. All experiments were repeated at least three times. SEM values were 
less than 10%.
Production of a Lentiviral Vector (LV) and Transduction of LLC cells
Lentiviral vector encoding a fusion between the optical reporter mCherry (GBM8FlmC, red) 
and firefly luciferase (FLuc) were created by PCR amplification of the cDNA sequences for 
mCherry and FLuc from pEmCherry (Clontech) and pcDNA-Luciferase (Addgene) with 
restriction enzyme sequences that were engineered into the primers. To create the final 
constructs, mCherry was digested with BamHI/EcoV and FLuc was digested with EcoV/
XhoI. The digested fragments were ligated into the BamHI/XhoI digested pTK402 LV 
transfer vector (a kind gift from Dr. Tal Kafri, The University of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill). LV-mCherryFLuc viral vectors were packaged in 3LL-M27 cells by transient 
transfection using the psPAX2 and pMD2.G (Addgene) packaging plasmids and following 
previously described protocols (35).
To utilize bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging, 3LL-M27 cells were transduced with 
lentiviral vectors encoding an mCherry and Renilla luciferase (mC-RL) fusion protein. The 
viral construct also encoded for a puromycin resistance gene downstream of mCherry which

 was introduced to enable for selection of nearly 100% positively transduced cells. A robust 
expression of both the fluorescent and bioluminescent markers was observed, and no 
difference in proliferation was detected between modified and unmodified cells. These cells 
(8FlmC-FLuc-3LL-M27) were used for biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy studies.
Biodistribution of Exosomes in Mice with Pulmonary Metastases
The experiments were performed with female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, 
Durham, NC) eight weeks of age in strict accordance with the recommendations in the 
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The 
animals were kept five per cage with an air filter cover under light- (12-hours light/dark 
cycle) and in a temperature-controlled (22 ± 1° C) environment. All manipulations with the 
animals were performed under a sterilized laminar hood. Food and water were given ad 
libitum.
C57BL/6 mice (n = 4) were injected intra tail vein (i.v.) with 8FlmC-FLuc-3LL-M27 cells 
(5×106 cells/mouse in 100 μL saline) and tumor lung metastases were allowed to establish 
for 10-12 days. Twelve days following cancer cells i.v. injection, DID-labeled exosomes 
isolated from autologous macrophages were administered intranasally (i.n., 107 particles/
10μl × 2) to mice with lung metastases. Four hours later, mice were sacrificed, perfused, 
lungs were extracted and sectioned on a microtome at a thickness of 20 μm; nuclei were 
stained with DAPI (300 mM, 5 min). The images of lung sections were examined by a 
confocal fluorescence microscopic system ACAS-570 and corresponding filter set, and 
processed using ImageJ software.
In another experiment, mice with established GBM8FlmC-metastases were injected i.n. with 
non-labeled exosomes loaded with Dox by sonication as described above (107 particles/
10μL × 2). Four hours later mice were sacrificed, perfused; lungs were extracted, sectioned, 
and co-localization of Dox with pulmonary metastases was visualized by confocal 
microscopy.
Therapeutic Efficacy of exoPTX against Pulmonary Metastases
The antineoplastic effects of exoPTX were evaluated in a mouse model of pulmonary 
metastases. For this purpose, C57BL/6 mice were i.v. injected with 8FlmC-FLuc-3LL-M27 
cancer cells (5×106 cells/100 μL/ mouse). Forty eight hours later, mice were treated i.n. with 
exoPTX (107 particles/10 μl × 2), or Taxol (50 mg/kg/mouse), or saline as a control (n = 7) 
every other day with a total of seven treatments. Tumor progression was monitored by 
luminescence using the IVIS system as described in (36). The animals were imaged at 
various time points (1 – 22 days) post-treatment as described (36). The chemoluminescent 
signal was quantified by Living Image® 2.50 software. To assess the amount of cancer 
metastases at day 22, mice were sacrificed, perfused, and lung slides obtained on microtome 
(Thermo Scientific) were examined by confocal microscopy.
Statistical Analysis
For the all experiments, data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. Tests for significant

software, San Diego, CA). A minimum p value of 0.05 was chosen as the significance level.
RESULTS
Manufacture and characterization of exosomal formulations of PTX (exoPTX)
Exosomes collected from the conditioned media of RAW 264.7 macrophages were 
characterized by size, charge, protein content, and morphology (Fig. 1A, B, and D). 
Exosomes showed elevated expression of exosome-associated proteins (Alix, TSG101, and 
Flotillin) as compared to cell lysate, which displayed greater levels of β-actin (Fig. 1B). 
Naïve empty exosomes had a narrow size distribution, with an average particle diameter of 
110.4 ± 4.2 nm and 70.8 ± 2.8 nm as revealed by NTA and DLS, respectively (Fig. 1 A); 
and a round morphology as shown by AFM imaging (Fig. 1 D).
PTX was incorporated into exosomes using three methods: a) incubation at room 
temperature (RT), b) electroporation, and c) mild sonication. The obtained exoPTX 
formulations were purified from the non-incorporated drug by size-exclusion 
chromatography and analyzed by HPLC to determine the loading capacity (LC). The typical 
HPLC profiles for PTX extracted from exosomes (B) and PTX standards (A) are shown on 
Supplemental Fig. 1. The amount of PTX loaded into exosomes increased as follows: 
incubation at RT < electroporation << sonication (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, DLS studies 
revealed that the size of exoPTX nanoformulations increased similarly, with the smaller 
being exoPTX nanoparticles obtained by electroporation or incubation at RT, and the larger 
being exosomes loaded with PTX by sonication (Fig. 1A). These data were confirmed by 
NTA analysis. Exosomes sonicated in the absence of PTX were even larger than those 
sonicated with PTX (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized this may be due to the stabilization of 
exosomal membranes by the incorporated drug. We suggested that a reorganization of 
exosomal membranes under sonication may enable PTX diffusion across relatively tight 
lipid bilayers. Indeed, fluorescence polarization measurements revealed significant 
decreases (more than two times) in membrane microviscosity upon sonication (Fig. 1C). To 
address a concern about possible loosing of exosome-bound proteins, we examined the 
levels of Alix, TSG101, and Flotillin in exosomes before and after sonication using western 
blot technique (Fig. 1B). The data indicate that the mild sonication utilized for PTX loading 
with six cycles, and intermediate time out for cooling down and restoration, did not 
significantly affect the protein content of exosomes. It is known that the anionic 
phospholipid phosphatidylserine is abundant on cell membranes and contributes to the 
surface charge of individual cellular membranes. To this end, all loading procedures did not 
significantly alter the zeta potential of the nanocarriers (Fig. 1A), suggesting that there were 
also no major alterations of the lipid content of exosomal membranes. Finally, a complete 
restoration of membrane microviscosity was observed after a one hour incubation at 37C 
following sonication procedure (Fig. 1C). Retention of shape and round morphology of 
exosomes (Fig. 1D) confirmed this hypothesis.
Next, exoPTX showed burst release within the first three hours, and then displayed a 
sustained release profile thereafter (Fig. 1E). The high stability of exosomes in an aqueous

 solution was demonstrated at three temperatures: 4°C, RT, and 37°C over a period of one 
month (Supplemental Fig. 2). Overall, the mild sonication procedure provided the highest 
amount of drug loading; the obtained LC of 28.29 ± 1.38% (Fig. 1A) was much higher than 
the LC of commercially available formulations of PTX, Taxol (~1% LC), or Abraxane 
(~10% LC). Therefore, exoPTX obtained by sonication was selected for further experiments.
Accumulation and therapeutic efficacy of exoPTX in target cancer cells in vitro
The ability to deliver the drug payload into target cells was studied with fluorescently-
labeled exosomes in 3LL-M27 cells, and compared to the commonly used nanocarriers, 
liposomes and polystyrene nanoparticles (NPs) (37) with the same size and level of 
fluorescence (Fig. 2). Liposomes were prepared by a reverse phase evaporation method as 
described previously (29). Confocal images revealed a profound accumulation of exosomes 
in cancer cells and limited uptake of liposomes and NPs (Fig. 2A). This result was further 
confirmed and quantitated in accumulation studies (Fig. 2B). Exosomes were taken up about 
30 times better than the synthetic nanoparticles, suggesting that PTX loaded into exosomes 
can be efficiently delivered to cancer cells in therapeutically sufficient quantities. These 
results clearly show the advantages of exosome-based drug delivery systems over common 
synthetic nanocarriers and confirmed our previous report regarding the profound 
accumulation of exosomes in neuronal PC12 cells (29).
The anticancer effects of exoPTX were evaluated in a resistant MDR cells expressing the 
drug efflux transporter, Pgp (MDCKMDR1), and their sensitive counterparts (MDCKWT). 
The loading of PTX into exosomes significantly increased drug cytotoxicity as compared to 
PTX alone, or Taxol in both sensitive MDCKWT and resistant MDCKMDR1 cancer cells 
(Table 1). These results are consistent with earlier reports regarding increased cytotoxicity 
of another anticancer agent, Dox in cancer cells (23). The most intriguing observation was 
made, when the effects of various PTX formulations were compared in sensitive and 
resistant cancer cells. For this purpose, the increased cytotoxicity of the drug was expressed 
in the form of a “Resistance Reversion Index” (RRI), i.e. ratio of IC50 of PTX alone, and in 
nanoformulation (e.g. IC50,PTX/IC50,exoPTX, or IC50,PTX/IC50,taxol). Both PTX formulations 
caused significant sensitization of MDR cells with respect to PTX (Table 1). In particular, 
RRI for exoPTX in MDCKMDR1 and MDCKWT was 53.33 and 18.38, respectively. In 
contrast, RRI for Taxol in both resistant and sensitive cancer cells was c.a. 6 (Table 1). 
Noteworthy, empty sonicated exosomes did not show any cytotoxicity in all studied cell 
lines (Supplemental Fig. 3). Thus, the increase in PTX cytotoxicity afforded by exoPTX 
was greater in Pgp-overexpressing cells than their sensitive counterparts (Table 1).
Mechanistic studies of exoPTX cytotoxic effects
We hypothesized that exoPTX may alter drug intracellular trafficking and bypass the drug 
efflux system more efficiently than Taxol (in particular, exoPTX may facilitate endosomal 
release of PTX from exosomes in cancer cells). To prove this hypothesis, we examined the 
accumulation levels of a fluorescent probe and Pgp substrate, Dox, incorporated into 
exosomes (exoDox) in MDCKMDR1 and MDCKWT cells. First, elevated Pgp expression 
levels in MDCKMDR1 cells, and low, if any, Pgp levels in MDCKWT cells were confirmed 
by western blot (Fig. 3A). Next, the uptake of free Dox and exosome-incorporated drug,

 exoDox, was compared in the presence/absence of a Pgp inhibitor, verapamil. As expected, 
the incorporation of Dox into exosomes significantly increased drug accumulation levels in 
both sensitive and resistant cancer cells (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of Pgp-mediated drug efflux by 
verapamil increased accumulation of free Dox in resistant MDCKMDR1 cells, but did not 
alter drug accumulation in their sensitive counterparts. Remarkably, verapamil treatment did 
not affect exoDox accumulation in resistant MDCKMDR1 cells, indicating that drug 
incorporation into exosomes allowed it to bypass this resistance mechanism (Fig. 3B).
We demonstrated earlier that the incorporation of Pgp substrates, such as R123 or Dox, into 
block-copolymer-based nanocarriers, i.e. Pluronic micelles, increased drug accumulation in 
resistant cancer cells due to the inhibition of Pgp efflux transporter by Pluronic 
macromolecules incorporated into the membranes of resistant cancer cells (28, 38-40). To 
exclude the possibility that exosomes may inhibit Pgp-mediated efflux by their fusion with 
cellular membranes, accumulation of R123 in both resistant and sensitive MDCK cancer 
cells was assessed. R123 does not incorporate into exosomes upon incubation at RT, as was 
confirmed in our preliminary studies (Supplemental Fig. 4). For this purpose, MDCKWT 
and MDCKMDR1 cell monolayers were pretreated with a Pgp inhibitor, verapamil (positive 
control), or empty exosomes, or media (negative control), and then were treated with R123 
solutions for two hours (Supplemental Fig. 5). R123 accumulation levels in resistant 
MDCKMDR1 cells were increased almost five times in verapamil pre-treated cells. In 
contrast, treatment with empty exosomes did not affect R123 accumulation in MDCKMDR1 
cells (Supplemental Fig. 5). As expected, neither treatment with verapamil, nor with empty 
exosomes, altered R123 accumulation levels in sensitive MDCKWT cells. This indicates that 
exosomes themselves do not appear to have any inhibitory effect on Pgp-mediated efflux; 
they allow incorporated drugs to bypass the Pgp efflux protein perhaps, through 
endocytosis-mediated transport and/or fusion with plasma membranes.
Co-localization of Airway-delivered Exosomes with Pulmonary Metastases in Lewis Lung 
Carcinoma (LLC) mouse model
To establish an in vivo model of pulmonary metastases, C57BL/6 mice were injected intra-
tail vein (5×106 cells/100 μL) with 3LL-M27 cells. Important, this model is particularly 
relevant to the present investigation, as it was demonstrated that 3LL-M27 tumor cells have 
high expression levels of the MDR1 gene and Pgp expression in vivo (32). Twenty days 
later, mice were sacrificed, perfused, and lungs were isolated, sectioned, and stained with 
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). Multiple metastases were detected in whole lungs 
(Supplemental Fig. 6A). Histological evaluations revealed that the structure of alveoli in 
tumor-bearing lungs was disrupted by tumor cells (Supplemental Fig. 6B). Next, mice were 
injected with 8FlmC-FLuc-3LL-M27 (red, Fig. 4) intra-tail vein as described in Materials 
and Methods section. 22 days later, autologous exosomes stained with a fluorescent dye, 
DiD (green), were i.n. administered to mice with pulmonary metastases. Four hours later, 
mice were sacrificed, perfused; lungs were sectioned on microtome and examined by 
confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue, Fig. 4). Confocal images 
revealed 97.9 ± 2.0% of exosomes were co-localized with lung metastases (Fig.4), 
indicating efficient targeting of exoPTX in vivo. A similar experiment was performed with 
exoDox formulation in order to visualize drug delivery to pulmonary metastases

 (Supplemental Fig. 7). Non-labeled exosomes loaded with Dox (green, Supplemental Fig. 
7B) were i.n. administered to mice with established 8FlmC-FLuc-3LL-M27 metastases (red, 
Supplemental Fig. 7A). Confocal images revealed a substantial amount of DOX in the 
lungs co-localized with cancer cells (yellow, Supplemental Fig. 7C). These results indicate 
that airway-administered exosomes reached pulmonary metastases and delivered their drug 
payload to target cancer cells.
PTX-loaded exosomes produce strong antineoplastic effect in mice with lung metastases
To provide insight into the potential of exosome-based therapeutic delivery, the 
antineoplastic effects of exoPTX were evaluated in an LLC mouse model. For this purpose, 
C57BL/6 mice were i.v. injected with 8FlmC-FLuc-3LL-M27 cells as described above. 48 
hours later, mice were i.n. administered exoPTX (107 particles/10 μl × 2,), or Taxol, or 
saline as a control every other day totally, seven times. The progression of pulmonary 
metastases in treated mice was monitored using IVIS by observing the luminescence of 
transduced cancer cells in living animals (Fig. 5A). Representative images of dorsal planes 
of the injected animals at day 22 are shown on (Fig. 5A). A significant (p < 0.05) inhibition 
of metastases growth by exoPTX treatment was demonstrated (Fig. 5C). Taxol treatment 
was shown to inhibit metastases growth as compared to non-treated controls (saline), 
although to a lesser extent than exoPTX treatment. At the end point of the experiment (day 
22), the lung sections were visualized using confocal microscopy (Fig. 5B). A marked 
number of fluorescent transduced cancer cells (red) were detected in the lungs of animals 
treated with Taxol (Fig. 5C), while only a few cancer cells were observed in the lungs of 
exoPTX treated animals. Noteworthy, sonicated empty exosomes showed no significant 
inhibition on pulmonary metastases growth (Fig. 5A, B). This confirms the superior 
antineoplastic efficacy of exoPTX as compared to Taxol.
DISCUSSION
Exosomal carriers can provide advantages of both cell-based drug delivery and 
nanotechnology for efficient drug transport capable of overcoming various biological 
barriers. However, several limitations need to be addressed before their use in the clinic. 
One of the difficulties is the efficient loading exosomes with a therapeutic agent without 
significant changes in the structure and content of exosomal membranes. In the present 
study, we utilized various methods for PTX incorporation into exosomes: incubation at RT, 
electroporation, and mild sonication. The mild sonication of exosomes in the presence of 
PTX provided the greatest loading capacity. PTX, a highly hydrophobic compound is likely 
to be incorporated into the hydrophobic inner region of the lipid bilayers of exosomes. We 
hypothesized that the high rigidity of exosomal membranes may be decreased upon 
sonication and would thus allow for PTX incorporation into lipid bilayers resulting in a high 
loading capacity. This hypothesis was confirmed by significant decreases in microviscosity 
of exosomal membranes upon sonication. Nevertheless, we do not exclude a possibility that 
a considerable amount of PTX may also be adhered to the surface of exosomes that may 
account for the burst release from exoPTX observed in the first 3-4 hours. It is worth noting 
that ~30% of loaded drug was still associated with exosomes after one week in an aqueous 
solution. Importantly, drug located in the inner bilayer of exosomes may also be available

 for use: as the exosomal membrane fuses with the cell or endosomal membrane, its 
intraluminal cargo may be released into the cytosol of a target cell. Next, the aggregation 
stability of exoPTX formulations is imperative for their use in clinic. We report here that the 
obtained exoPTX formulation was stable at various conditions for over a month, which 
confirms previous reports about the long-term stability of exosomes (41). In addition, 
exosomes may be lyophilized and reconstituted, while retaining their morphology and other 
characteristics (29). This provides a clinical link for exosome-based drug formulations, 
suggesting that multiple lots of exoPTX may be prepared and stored prior to treatment.
Exosomes possess an extraordinary ability to interact with and accumulate in target cancer 
cells. The obtained data indicates exosomes are taken up in considerably greater numbers 
than liposomes or polystyrene NPs. In addition, the incorporation of PTX into exosomes 
may not only increase its solubility, but also allow for overcoming of Pgp-mediated drug 
efflux. We demonstrated here that incorporation of a Pgp substrate, Dox, into exosomes 
significantly increased drug accumulation in MDR cells as compared to free DOX, or even 
to Dox in the presence of a Pgp-inhibitor, verapamil. Next, the increase in cytotoxicity 
afforded by the exosomal formulation of PTX was considerably greater in resistant cells 
(RRI > 53.33) than sensitive cells (RRI = 18.35), while Taxol showed almost no difference 
in resistant (RRI > 5.85) vs. sensitive cancer cells (RRI = 6.17). This effect may be attributed 
to the difference in route of internalization of exoPTX, as compared to Taxol. Exosomes and 
micelles, such as those found in Taxol, are taken up by endocytosis, but exosomes have 
superior uptake due to the presence of adhesion proteins, tetraspanins, integrins, 
immunoglobulins, proteoglycans, and lectins (42), which are not found on artificial 
nanoparticles. Furthermore, exosomes consist of cellular membranes that may fuse with the 
plasma and/or endocytic membranes and deliver their cargo, bypassing Pgp-mediated efflux. 
Noteworthy, exosomes themselves did not inhibit Pgp, as the pre-treatment with empty 
exosomes did not increase accumulation of the Pgp substrate, R123, in resistant cancer cells.
Interestingly, it was suggested that the MDR efflux transporters are likely contribute to the 
production of drug-loaded exosomes during their biogenesis in resistant cancer cells (43). In 
addition, Pgp may be also involved in the increased drug sequestration in lysosomes and 
MVB (44). Thus, Pgp associated with the endosomal membrane excretes the internalized 
drug into the endosomal lumen, where newly formed cancer exosomes are literally 
incubated with the drug and become “drug-loaded” before being released from the cell. The 
same effect was reported with PTX in Pgp-overexpressing bone marrow mesenchymal 
stromal cells (SR4987) (45). We hypothesized that exoPTX accumulated in the MDR cancer 
cells may bypass not only efflux by Pgp transporter located on plasma membrane, but also 
avoid accumulation in lysosomes and MVB of cancer cells, and therefore, reduce drug 
elimination and increase its therapeutic efficacy in resistant tumors. The investigations 
regarding this hypothesis are underway in our laboratory.
Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of exoPTX formulation against pulmonary metastases was 
demonstrated in an LLC mouse model. Intriguingly, airway-delivered exosomes showed 
near complete co-localization with cancer metastases in this model. The results were 
confirmed by the significant co-localization of Dox incorporated into exosomes with cancer 
cells. We speculated that macrophage-released exosomes are likely to have specific proteins

 on their surface, which might allow for their preferential accumulation in cancer cells. 
Furthermore, it is known that exosome-mediated cell-to-cell communication is key in the 
battle between cancer and the immune system (46). Thus, Parolini et al. (47) showed that 
exosome fusion with target cells occurs more efficiently under acidic conditions, implying 
that exosomes may be taken up preferentially by tumors (which have an acidic 
microenvironment) rather than the surrounding healthy tissue. Our results show that exoPTX 
demonstrated superior inhibition of pulmonary metastases growth in LLC mouse model. All 
three mechanisms mentioned here are likely to have significant impact on exoPTX 
anticancer activity, i.e.: (i) preferential accumulation in cancer cells, (ii) efficient delivery of 
incorporated cargo into target cancer cells, and (iii) by-passing Pgp-mediated drug efflux in 
resistant cancer cells. Indeed, further investigations are necessary to uncover this 
mechanism.

 Figure 1. Characterization of PTX exosomal formulations
Exosomes were collected from conditioned media of RAW 264.7 macrophages, and loaded 
with PTX by various methods: co-incubation at RT; electroporation, and sonication. The 
size of exoPTX was measured by NTA and DLS (A). The loading with PTX increased the 
size of exosomes, but did not significantly altered their surface charge. The loading 
efficiency of exosomes with PTX increased in a row: incubation at RT < electroporation << 
sonication. The exosome protein content was confirmed by western blot (B). Significant 
amount of exosome-associated proteins, Alix, TSG101, and Flotillin was detected in naïve 
(2) and sonicated exosomes (3), but not in the cells (1). Effect of sonication on fluidity of 
exosomal membranes labeled with BODIPY-PC was examined by fluorescence polarization 
measurements (C). The microviscosity of exosomal membranes was significantly decreased 
by six cycles of ultrasound treatment (3) compared to naïve exosomes (1), or exosomes 
subjected to one sonication cycle (2). The microviscosity of sonicated exosomes was 
completely restored following one hour incubation period at 37 (5), but not after 30 min 
incubation (4). The morphology of drug-loaded exosomes was examined by AFM (D). 
Images revealed small spherical naïve exosomes as well as PTX-loaded exosomes. The bar: 
200 nm. A release PTX profile from pre-loaded exosomes was evaluated for the exoPTX 
formulation obtained by sonication (E). Values are means ± SEM (n = 4). Symbols indicate 
the relative level of significance compared with naïve exosomes (p < 0.05)

 Figure 3. Effect of Pgp inhibition on Dox accumulation in MDR and sensitive cancer cells
The accumulation of free Dox or exoDox in MDCKMDR1 and MDCKWT cells was studied 
in cell lysates. The Dox incorporation into exosomes significantly increased accumulation in 
sensitive and resistant cells, while no effect of verapamil on exoDOX accumulation was 
found in both cell lines.

 Figure 4. Co-localization of airway-delivered exosomes with pulmonary metastases
Exosomes were isolated from macrophages conditioned media, and labeled with fluorescent 
dye, DID (green). C57BL/6 mice were i.v. injected with 3LL-M27 cells transduced with 
lentiviral vectors encoding the optical reporter mCherry (8FlmC) fluorescent protein. 21 
days later, the mice with established pulmonary metastases (red) were i.n. injected with 
DID-labeled exosomes (green). 4 hours later, mice were euthanized, perfused, lungs were 
sectioned, and stained with DAPI (blue). The confocal images revealed near complete co-
localization of exosomes with metastases (yellow). Images were obtained with ×10 (A), and 
×60 (B) magnification. Bar: 50 μm.

 Figure 5. The inhibition of metastases growth in mouse lungs upon exoPTX treatment
C57Bl/6 mice were i.v. injected with 8FlmC-FLuc-3LL-M27 (red) cells to establish 
pulmonary metastases. 48 hour later mice were treated with exoPTX, or Taxol, or saline, or 
empty sonicated exosomes as a control, and the treatment was repeated every other day, 
totally seven times. Representative IVIS images were taken at day 21 (A). Statistical 
significance of metastases levels from IVIS images in lungs of treated animals compared to 
control mice is shown by asterisk (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.005) (B). At the endpoint, 21 days 
later, mice were sacrificed, perfused, and lung slides were examined by confocal microscopy 
(C). The bar: 10 μm.
