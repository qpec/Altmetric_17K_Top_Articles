Abstract
Problem/Condition: Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vectorborne disease in the United States but is geographically 
focal. The majority of Lyme disease cases occur in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and upper Midwest regions. Lyme disease can 
cause varied clinical manifestations, including erythema migrans, arthritis, facial palsy, and carditis. Lyme disease occurs most 
commonly among children and older adults, with a slight predominance among males.
Reporting Period: 2008–2015.
Description of System: Lyme disease has been a nationally notifiable condition in the United States since 1991. Possible Lyme 
disease cases are reported to local and state health departments by clinicians and laboratories. Health department staff conduct case 
investigations to classify cases according to the national surveillance case definition. Those that qualify as confirmed or probable 
cases of Lyme disease are reported to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. States with an average 
annual incidence during this reporting period of ≥10 confirmed Lyme disease cases per 100,000 population were classified as 
high incidence. States that share a border with those states or that are located between areas of high incidence were classified as 
neighboring states. All other states were classified as low incidence.
Results: During 2008–2015, a total of 275,589 cases of Lyme disease were reported to CDC (208,834 confirmed and 66,755 
probable). Although most cases continue to be reported from states with high incidence in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and upper 
Midwest regions, case counts in most of these states have remained stable or decreased during the reporting period. In contrast, 
case counts have increased in states that neighbor those with high incidence. Overall, demographic characteristics associated with 
confirmed cases were similar to those described previously, with a slight predominance among males and a bimodal age distribution 
with peaks among young children and older adults. Yet, among the subset of cases reported from states with low incidence, infection 
occurred more commonly among females and older adults. In addition, probable cases occurred more commonly among females 
and with a higher modal age than confirmed cases.
Interpretation: Lyme disease continues to be the most commonly reported vectorborne disease in the United States. Although 
concentrated in historically high-incidence areas, the geographic distribution is expanding into neighboring states. The trend of 
stable to decreasing case counts in many states with high incidence could be a result of multiple factors, including actual stabilization 
of disease incidence or artifact due to modifications in reporting practices employed by some states to curtail the resource burden 
associated with Lyme disease surveillance.
Public Health Action: This report highlights the continuing public health challenge of Lyme disease in states with high incidence 
and demonstrates its emergence in neighboring states that previously experienced few cases. Educational efforts should be directed 
accordingly to facilitate prevention, early diagnosis, and appropriate treatment. As Lyme disease emerges in neighboring states, 
clinical suspicion of Lyme disease in a patient should be based on local experience rather than incidence cutoffs used for surveillance 
purposes. A diagnosis of Lyme disease should be considered in patients with compatible clinical signs and a history of potential 
exposure to infected ticks, not only in states with high incidence but also in areas where Lyme disease is known to be emerging. 
These findings underscore the ongoing need to implement personal prevention practices routinely (e.g., application of insect 
repellent and inspection for and removal of ticks) and to develop other effective interventions.
Introduction
Lyme disease, a tickborne zoonosis caused by spirochetes in 
the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, can affect multiple 
human organ systems (1). B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is 
responsible for most infections in the United States, although

B. mayonii also has been shown to cause human illness in the 
upper Midwest (2). Typical signs and symptoms in the days 
to weeks following a bite from an infected tick can include 
erythema migrans, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, 
myalgia, fatigue, and headache (1,3,4). The organism can infect 
the nervous system, causing facial palsy, and the cardiovascular 
system, causing carditis with atrioventricular heart block, a 
rare condition that can be fatal (1,4,5). Untreated infection 
might result in mono- or oligoarticular arthritis in large joints 
or, more rarely, encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy 
(4). Patients with Lyme disease treated early with appropriate 
antibiotics usually experience a full recovery (4).
In the United States, human Lyme disease cases occur 
primarily in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and upper Midwest 
regions, but also in certain areas of the Pacific Coast (6,7). 
In all of these locations, competent vector ticks and infected 
reservoirs, such as small mammals and birds, are at sufficient 
density to support the enzootic cycle (1,6,8). The blacklegged 
tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the vector of Lyme disease in the 
eastern and upper midwestern United States; the western 
blacklegged tick, I. pacificus, is the vector of Lyme disease on 
the Pacific Coast (1,6). Commonly, larval blacklegged ticks 
infected during feeding transmit the bacteria to other hosts, 
including humans, during subsequent nymphal and adult 
stage blood meals (1).
Lyme disease has been a nationally notifiable condition 
in the United States since 1991 (7,9). Notable revisions to 
the case definition occurred in 1996 and 2008; the 2008 
revision added reporting of cases meeting the probable case 
definition and narrowed the laboratory criteria for evidence 
of infection (10). The most recent summary of Lyme disease 
surveillance incorporated data collected during 1992–2006 
(7). This report updates information acquired through national 
surveillance on the epidemiology of Lyme disease.
Methods
Data Source and Surveillance 
Case Definition
Public health agencies voluntarily transmit information on 
Lyme disease cases to CDC through the National Notifiable 
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) (11). Variables 
transmitted include age, sex, race, ethnicity, and date of onset or 
of laboratory report. State health departments also can submit 
supplemental information on Lyme disease cases, including 
clinical manifestations of illness. Completeness of data specific 
to Lyme disease varies by state and over time. Cases are reported 
according to the patient’s state and county of residence rather 
than state and county of exposure. As a result, an infection 
could be acquired while visiting a state with high incidence 
but reported by a state with low incidence.
State and local health jurisdictions receive reports of 
potential Lyme disease cases from laboratories and clinicians. 
Per the surveillance case definition, laboratory reports 
require follow-up investigation to obtain clinical information 
necessary for appropriate case classification. As part of this 
system, states are responsible for classifying potential cases 
as confirmed or probable on the basis of criteria set forth in 
the case definition developed and approved by the Council 
of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE). Since 
2008, a confirmed case of Lyme disease is defined as either 
1) erythema migrans in a person who had possible exposure to 
tick habitat in an area where Lyme disease is endemic or who 
had laboratory evidence of infection or 2) at least one other 
defined clinical manifestation of Lyme disease in a person 
and laboratory evidence of infection (10). A probable case of 
Lyme disease is defined as laboratory evidence of infection in 
a person who had Lyme disease diagnosed by a clinician but 
with accompanying clinical information that does not meet 
the clinical criteria for a confirmed case. The 2008 surveillance 
case definition strengthened the specificity for laboratory 
evidence of infection. In the 2008 definition, sufficient 
laboratory evidence of infection for surveillance purposes was 
1) a positive culture for B. burgdorferi and 2) a positive two-
tier IgM or IgG serologic test (enzyme immunoassay followed 
by reflex immunoblot) interpreted using established criteria 
or a single-tier positive IgG immunoblot (10). Acute onset of 
specific neurologic, musculoskeletal, or cardiovascular signs 
and symptoms satisfy the criteria for clinical manifestations 
of confirmed Lyme disease (10). Beginning in 2011, the case 
definition reflected formatting changes in which text of the 
laboratory evidence of infection was modified to explicitly state 
that IgM two-tier serologic testing should only be interpreted in 
the first 30 days of illness onset, rather than solely referencing 
another document that outlined this criterion. Because the 
most recent surveillance summary (7) encompassed data 
collected during 1992–2006 and this report includes data 
collected following a notable case definition change in 2008 
(e.g., reporting of probable cases and narrowing of laboratory 
criteria), data from 2007 are not included but are publicly 
available (12).
Analysis
Data on Lyme disease cases reported to CDC during 
2008–2015 were included. Annual incidence rates per 100,000 
population were calculated by state using U.S. Census Bureau 
estimates from July 1 of each year (https://www.census.gov/).

For this report, states were classified for surveillance purposes 
(state surveillance categories) as high incidence, low incidence, 
and neighboring. States with an average annual incidence 
during this reporting period of ≥10 confirmed Lyme disease 
cases per 100,000 population were classified as high incidence. 
States that share a border with those states or that are located 
between areas of high incidence were classified as neighboring 
states. All other states were classified as low incidence. 
Characteristics associated with cases reported from states in 
these three categories were compared. Percentage change in 
the number of reported cases between subsequent years was 
calculated for states with high incidence and neighboring states. 
The median annual percentage change in case counts over the 
reporting period was determined by selecting the median of 
each 1-year percentage change value for each state. Seasonality 
analysis was restricted to cases with illness onset dates no more 
than 1 year before the reporting year. Week of illness onset 
was calculated with each week beginning on Sunday. Week 1 
of a year was the first week of the year that had at least 4 days 
in the calendar year; therefore, weeks 1 and 53 sometimes 
contained days from the preceding or subsequent year. Analysis 
of reported clinical signs and symptoms was restricted to only 
those records indicating at least one confirmatory sign or 
symptom and according to variables transmitted to CDC. All 
analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
Results
During 2008–2015, a total 275,589 cases of Lyme disease 
were reported to CDC (208,834 confirmed and 66,755 
probable) (Figure 1). The combined annual total of confirmed 
and probable cases ranged from 38,468 in 2009 to 30,158 in 
2010. The highest number of confirmed cases was reported in 
2009 (29,959) and the lowest was reported in 2012 (22,014). 
Confirmed cases were reported from 48 states and the District 
of Columbia. On average, 8,344 probable cases were reported 
each year (range: 6,277 in 2008 to 9,616 in 2015). In 2008, 
a total of 35 states and the District of Columbia reported at 
least one probable case of Lyme disease; in 2015, a total of 
41 states and the District of Columbia reported at least one 
probable case.
Fourteen states, all located in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, 
and upper Midwest regions, met the criteria for classification 
as states with high incidence (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, 
Virginia, and Wisconsin) (Table 1) (Figure 2). During 
2008–2015, these states accounted for 95.2% of all reported 
cases and 95.7% of confirmed cases reported in the United 
States. Confirmed cases accounted for 76.2% of the total 
cases reported from states with high incidence. Despite 
the high number of reported cases, overall median annual 
percentage change in number of confirmed cases among these 
states was -0.29% (range: -18.8% to 20.1%). Seven of the 
14 states displayed an overall decreasing trend in the number 
of confirmed cases, as indicated by negative median annual 
percentage changes.
Eleven states and the District of Columbia were classified as 
neighboring states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, 
North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, 
Tennessee, and West Virginia) (Figure 2). During 2008–2015, 
confirmed cases accounted for 71.0% of the total cases 
reported from neighboring states. The overall median annual 
percentage change in number of confirmed cases reported 
by neighboring states was 6.6% (range: -16.7% to 31.3%). 
In contrast to states with high incidence, the majority (eight 
of 11) of neighboring states displayed an overall increasing 
trend in the number of confirmed cases reported. Among the 
remaining 25 states, all classified as states with low incidence, 
confirmed cases accounted for a lower percentage of total cases 
reported (62.5%).
Seasonality
Information on date of illness onset was available for 200,108 
(72.6%) cases. For all years, the first week in July was the peak 
week of illness onset for confirmed and probable cases (Figure 3).
Demographics
Information on sex was available for 269,973 (98.0%) 
cases (97.7% of confirmed cases; 98.7% of probable cases); 
a majority of cases was among males (56.7%) (Table 2). 
Information on race was available for 62.1% of cases (129,129 
confirmed; 41,883 probable). Most confirmed and probable 
cases were among white patients (89.7%), followed by other 
race (6.8%), black (1.6%), Asian/Pacific Islander (1.5%), and 
American Indian/Alaska Native (<1.0%) patients. A smaller 
number of case records included information on ethnicity 
(114,465; 41.5%); of these, 95.9% occurred among non-
Hispanic patients.
Patient age was available for 246,840 (89.6%) records. The 
age distribution of patients with confirmed and probable Lyme 
disease was bimodal with peaks among those aged 5–9 years 
and 50–55 years (Figure 4). Overall modal age was 8 years, 
whereas modal age was 8 years among patients with confirmed 
Lyme disease and 56 years among patients with probable Lyme 
disease (Table 2).

† State surveillance categories were determined using three classifications: high incidence, neighboring, and low incidence. States with an average annual incidence 
≥10 confirmed Lyme disease cases per 100,000 population were classified as high incidence, states that share a border with those states or are located between 
states with high incidence were classified as neighboring, and all other states were classified as low incidence.
§ Arrows indicate notable changes in case definitions. The case definition was revised in 1996 to recommend a two-step testing method and in 2008 to increase 
specificity of laboratory evidence of infection and to include provision for report of probable cases.
Demographic characteristics differed among cases reported 
from states with high incidence, neighboring states, and states 
with low incidence (Figure 4) (Table 2). In states with high 
incidence, overall modal age was 8 years, and males accounted 
for the majority of patients (146,380; 57.0%). In contrast, 
overall modal age in states with low incidence was 51 years, and 
males accounted for 44.8% (2,058) of patients (Table 2). In 
neighboring states, the proportional distribution among males 
and females was similar to that of states with high incidence; 
however, modal age was slightly older (9 years) (Table 2).
Clinical Manifestations
Information on at least one defined clinical manifestation 
was available for 60.2% of confirmed cases from 35 states. 
Approximately three fourths (72.2%) of patients had 
erythema migrans; 27.5% had arthritis; and 1.5% had carditis, 
defined for surveillance purposes as acute second- or third-
degree atrioventricular block. Approximately 12.5% had a 
neurologic manifestation: 8.4% had facial palsy, 3.8% had 
radiculoneuropathy, 1.3% had lymphocytic meningitis, and 
<1.0% had encephalitis. Although the proportion of confirmed 
case records with indication of erythema migrans was similar 
between states with high incidence and neighboring states 
(72.3% [88,090] and 70.6% [2,089], respectively), a lower 
proportion of records from states with low incidence indicated 
erythema migrans (581; 64.7%). Neurologic manifestations 
were more common among patients from neighboring states 
(731; 24.7%) and states with low incidence (180; 20.0%)

compared with states with high incidence (14,823; 12.2%). 
The proportion of case records with indication of carditis was 
consistent among all state surveillance categories.
Differences Among Demographic Groups
Among different clinical manifestations, distribution of 
confirmed cases varied with respect to patient age but appeared 
similar among patients in older age groups (>44 years) (Figure 5). 
Age distributions among patients with erythema migrans and 
arthritis were bimodal. In contrast, age distributions among 
patients with carditis and neurologic manifestations were more 
uniform but still peaked among patients aged 50–55 years 
(Figure 5). Carditis disproportionately affected patients 
aged 20–40 years. Although erythema migrans was the most 
commonly reported clinical sign among all age groups, it was 
least frequently reported among patients aged 10–14 years 
(5,143; 60.6%), whereas across all age groups, arthritis was 
most common among patients aged 10–14 years (2,992; 
35.2%). The proportion of male patients with erythema 
migrans was consistent with the overall sex distribution 
(50,464; 56.0%); however, among those with carditis, 70.3% 
(1,279) were male. In addition, black patients comprised a 
larger proportion of reported cases with carditis (27; 2.3%) 
when compared with the overall frequency of black patients 
in the data set (Table 3).
Differences in Seasonality
The spring and summer seasonal peak of illness onset among 
confirmed cases was consistent across clinical manifestations 
(Figure 6). Erythema migrans was the most commonly 
reported clinical sign among patients with illness onset during 
April–November, followed by arthritis (data not shown). Among

March), arthritis was the most common clinical sign.
Discussion
This report updates available information on the 
epidemiology of reported Lyme disease cases. For many states 
with high incidence, the number of case reports appears 
to have stabilized or declined recently. The decrease in 
reported cases among many states with high incidence could 
be attributable to several different factors, including actual 
stabilization of disease incidence or an artifact from changes 
in case verification practices designed to minimize the resource 
demands of conducting Lyme disease surveillance. In contrast, 
during 2008–2015 the number of cases reported from many 
of the neighboring states increased. Geographic expansion 
of areas with substantial occurrence of human Lyme disease 
is supported by a documented increase in the number of 
counties in the United States with established I. scapularis tick 
populations (13,14).
Although the overall demographic and clinical characteristics 
among reported cases are similar to those detailed in previous 
reports (7,15), this report reveals distinct differences in the 
demographics associated with confirmed and probable cases 
from states in all surveillance categories. Confirmed cases in 
states with high incidence and neighboring states occurred 
most commonly among males and with a modal age in young 
children. In contrast, confirmed cases from states with low 
incidence were associated with a substantially higher modal 
age and occurred more commonly among females. Overall, 
probable cases reflected an older patient population than that of 
confirmed cases. Although probable cases from states with high 
incidence still occurred more commonly among males, probable 
cases from neighboring states and states with low incidence 
occurred more commonly among females. Demographic

* State surveillance categories were determined using three classifications: high incidence, neighboring, and low incidence. States with an average annual incidence 
≥10 confirmed Lyme disease cases per 100,000 population were classified as high incidence, states sharing a border with those states or located between states 
with high incidence were classified as neighboring, and all other states were classified as low incidence.
† Sex: N = 269,973; age: N = 246,840.
differences among cases reported from states with high and 
low incidence have been previously documented (16,17) and 
might reflect lack of specificity of erythema migrans in locations 
where southern tick-associated rash illness occurs (18) as well 
as higher potential for false positive serologic results stemming 
from lower positive predictive value of those tests in settings 
with low incidence (19,20). Many confirmed cases in states with 
low incidence likely reflect travel to states with high incidence 
(16). In contrast, probable cases reported from neighboring 
states and states with low incidence appear to reflect a different 
patient population, thereby suggesting decreased specificity of 
the probable case definition in those states.
Approximately 75% of all confirmed case reports that 
included clinical data had indication of erythema migrans. 
Infections with illness onset outside the peak season of 
transmission (spring and summer) might sometimes be 
considered a result of infection that was acquired during the 
spring and summer months but did not clinically manifest 
until months later. Arthritis, the most common disseminated 
manifestation of Lyme disease, was the most common clinical 
finding among patients with reported illness onset during the 
coldest months in the temperate United States. Nevertheless, 
erythema migrans was the most commonly reported sign of 
infection among patients with illness onset not only in the 
peak spring and summer months but for two thirds of the year 
(April–November) (data not shown). This seasonal pattern 
underscores that adult ticks that seek blood meal hosts during 
the fall months have a proportional role in human illness and 
that prevention messages should not be focused only during 
the spring and summer season when nymphal ticks seek hosts.
The usefulness of Lyme disease surveillance differs across 
jurisdictions. High numbers of possible Lyme disease cases that 
require clinical follow-up have taxed public health resources 
in states with high incidence to an unsustainable level (21). 
Solutions vary, with some states investigating cases as resources 
allow, which at times means curtailing surveillance activities. 
Other states have begun to employ statistical methodology to 
estimate the number of cases each year. For example, several 
counties in New York have implemented a system in which 
20% of positive laboratory reports are sampled and investigated 
to determine what proportion can be confirmed; these results 
are extrapolated to the remaining unsampled laboratory reports 
to arrive at an estimate of Lyme disease case counts in those 
counties (22). Several states are considering adopting similar 
methodologies to better manage public health surveillance for 
Lyme disease (23). In line with historical case-based surveillance 
systems, case estimates are not reported to CDC through 
NNDSS, one of several factors that contribute to underreporting 
of cases nationally. In areas where Lyme disease incidence has 
remained high for years, expensive, ongoing surveillance does 
not yield new information about the magnitude or geographic 
distribution of the disease and potentially diverts limited public 
health resources that might be spent on prevention. Taken 
together, these points suggest the need for a paradigm shift in 
states with high incidence that would minimize personnel and 
resource costs while still maintaining awareness of the disease. 
In contrast, public health surveillance in states where Lyme 
disease is emerging can serve to increase knowledge of local 
disease incidence and spread, which can in turn be used to target 
educational measures for health care providers and the public.
To improve specificity of reported cases in areas with low 
incidence and areas where Lyme disease is emerging, CSTE 
voted to modify the Lyme disease surveillance case definition 
effective in 2017 (24). Confirmation of infection acquired 
in states outside those with high incidence now requires 
laboratory evidence of infection. As Lyme disease emerges 
in neighboring states, clinical suspicion of Lyme disease in 
a patient should be based on local experience rather than 
incidence cutoffs used for surveillance purposes.
Identification of effective methods to prevent Lyme disease 
has proven challenging. Measures aimed at reducing tick 
populations on residential properties have not proven effective in

decreasing the number of human Lyme disease infections (25). 
Long recommended behavioral interventions, such as wearing 
permethrin-treated clothing or using repellent containing DEET, 
have not been adequate to control Lyme disease on a population 
scale (26,27). In addition, adherence to recommendations 
aimed at preventing Lyme disease has been poor, even in areas 
of high risk (28,29). New approaches are needed to reduce the 
incidence and spread of Lyme disease, including exploration of 
a second-generation human vaccine (28).
Limitations
Because systematic interpretation of Lyme disease 
surveillance data has been and continues to be complicated 
by several factors, this report is subject to at least three 
limitations. First, recent estimates of underreporting to the 
public health system suggest that the actual incidence in the 
United States might be tenfold higher than final reported 
cases (30–32). At the same time, Lyme disease is subject to 
misdiagnosis (specifically false positive diagnosis), especially 
in areas where the disease is rare and false positive test results 
are more likely (32). Shifts in annual case counts in a state 
might not reflect actual changes in disease incidence but might 
often be linked to changes in surveillance practices within 
that state or to competing public health priorities, such as the 
H1N1 influenza epidemic or the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West 
Africa, that tap limited public health personnel. Because of 
the resources required to conduct Lyme disease surveillance, 
many jurisdictions with high incidence have implemented 
modifications to methods of case ascertainment and 
verification. The resulting heterogeneous nature of surveillance 
data limits interpretability over time and across jurisdictions. 
Second, the classification of neighboring state used for this 
report was based on administrative boundaries, and these

states do not exhibit uniform risk for Lyme disease or patterns 
of associated disease emergence. For example, although 
Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee are all classified as 
neighboring states in this analysis, risk for Lyme disease is 
clear in specific areas of Iowa and Illinois but negligible in 
Kentucky and Tennessee, which have limited numbers of 
infected host-seeking vector ticks. Furthermore, Lyme disease 
is endemic in certain areas of the Pacific Coast that support 
the enzootic cycle, and although risk is documented in those 
areas, no states outside of the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, or 
upper Midwest regions met the criteria for high incidence. 
Finally, in many states with low incidence, cases likely reflect 
travel of persons and acquisition of infection in states with 
high incidence rather than local transmission (16).
Conclusion
This summary provides an updated description of the 
epidemiology of Lyme disease in the United States. During 
2008–2015, similar to previous periods, the number of Lyme 
disease cases fluctuated from year to year; however, the total 
number of reported cases remained above 30,000 each year, 
making Lyme disease the most commonly reported vectorborne 
disease in the country (12,33). Overall, regions with highest 
risk for Lyme disease and populations in which most cases 
occur remain similar to those previously described (7), although 
expansion into neighboring states is evident. Reported cases 
exhibited a bimodal age distribution and occurred more 
commonly among males and during the early summer months 
when the nymphal stage Ixodes spp. vector ticks are seeking 
blood meal hosts in North America. Probable cases display 
more uniform age and sex distributions than confirmed cases. 
Unlike the predominance among males and a bimodal age 
distribution apparent when looking at trends among all cases, 
cases in states with low incidence are more common among 
women aged 15–59 years.
Lyme disease surveillance is not meant to document every 
case but rather to indicate disease trends over time, define high-
risk groups, and describe the geographic distribution of the 
condition. Lyme disease surveillance is challenging, and Lyme 
disease continues to present a major public health problem in 
multiple regions of the United States.
