and Northern Ireland

Summary
Background Tuberculosis elimination in countries with a low incidence of the disease necessitates multiple interventions, 
including innovations in migrant screening. We examined a cohort of migrants screened for tuberculosis before entry 
to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland and tracked the development of disease in this group after arrival.
Methods As part of a pilot pre-entry screening programme for tuberculosis in 15 countries with a high incidence of 
the disease, the International Organization for Migration screened all applicants for UK visas aged 11 years or older 
who intended to stay for more than 6 months. Applicants underwent a chest radiograph, and any with results 
suggestive of tuberculosis underwent sputum testing and culture testing (when available). We tracked the development 
of tuberculosis in those who tested negative for the disease and subsequently migrated to England, Wales, and 
Northern Ireland with the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system. Primary outcomes were cases of all forms of 
tuberculosis (including clinically diagnosed cases), and bacteriologically confi
 rmed pulmonary tuberculosis.
Findings Our study cohort was 519 955 migrants who were screened for tuberculosis before entry to the UK between 
Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2012. Cases notifi
 ed on the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system between Jan 1, 2006, 
and Dec 31, 2013, were included. 1873 incident cases of all forms of tuberculosis were identifi
 ed, and, on the basis of 
data for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the estimated incidence of all forms of tuberculosis in migrants 
screened before entry was 147 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 140–154). The estimated incidence of bacteriologically 
confi
 rmed pulmonary tuberculosis in migrants screened before entry was 49 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 45–53). 
Migrants whose chest radiographs were compatible with active tuberculosis but with negative pre-entry microbiological 
results were at increased risk of tuberculosis compared with those with no radiographic abnormalities (incidence rate 
ratio 3·2, 95% CI 2·8–3·7; p<0·0001). Incidence of tuberculosis after migration increased signifi
 cantly with 
increasing WHO-estimated prevalence of tuberculosis in migrants’ countries of origin. 35 of 318 983 pre-entry 
screened migrants included in a secondary analysis with typing data were assumed index cases. Estimates of the rate 
of assumed reactivation tuberculosis ranged from 46 (95% CI 42–52) to 91 (82–102) per 100 000 population.
Interpretation Migrants from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis screened before being granted entry to 
low-incidence countries pose a negligible risk of onward transmission but are at increased risk of tuberculosis, which 
could potentially be prevented through identifi
 cation and treatment of latent infection in close collaboration with a 
pre-entry screening programme.

Introduction
Several countries have achieved low tuberculosis 
incidence while having large populations of migrants 
from countries with high tuberculosis burdens.1–3 In 
many of these countries with low burdens of tuberculosis, 
a large proportion of disease now occurs in individuals 
born outside the country.4,5 Elimination of tuberculosis in 
countries with low incidence of the disease is expected to 
require multiple interventions, including, but not limited 
to, innovation in screening of migrants.
A systematic review6 published in 2014 showed that, 
in pre-entry screening of migrants before travel to 
low-incidence countries, the largest number of cases was 
detected when screening was done in high-incidence 
countries. One-off
  pre-entry screening for active 
tuberculosis in migrants will detect only disease prevalent 
at the time of screening. Few linked data are available for 
incident tuberculosis after migration to low-incidence 
countries in populations screened before entry, and even 
fewer data are available for risk factors for subsequent

development of disease in this screened population. 
Investigators in previous studies focused on prevalent 
cases detected during pre-entry screening,6 used national 
tuberculosis notifi
 cation data alone with no linkage to 
pre-entry screening records,7 or followed up a selected 
cohort of individuals from a few countries or 
subnationally after arrival.8–10 Thus, the most eff
 ective 
approach to reduction of the disease burden in migrants 
from high-incidence to low-incidence countries—
including latent tuberculosis screening and treatment, 
active case fi
 nding, and improvement of health-care 
access—is uncertain.
A UK pilot programme of pre-entry screening was 
done in 15 countries from 2005, and subsequently rolled 
out to 101 countries between May, 2012, and March 31, 
2014  (fi
 gure 1).11 We use data from this pilot programme 
to create the largest cohort so far of migrants screened 
for active tuberculosis before entering a country with 
low incidence of tuberculosis, generate national 
estimates of incidence after migration, and identify risk 
factors for subsequent development of disease. We used 
strain typing data to identify tuberculosis cases that 
were probably due to reactivation of imported latent 
infection rather than acquisition in England, Wales, or 
Northern Ireland. We also identifi
 ed index cases for 
clusters of disease, and ascertained the characteristics 
of such cases. 
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a population-based cohort study of migrants to 
the UK screened before entry for active tuberculosis. 
Screening occurred between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 
2012, and was done by the International Organization for 
Migration (IOM) as part of a pilot pre-entry screening 
programme in 15 countries with a high incidence of 
tuberculosis—Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, 
Côte d’Ivoire, Eritrea, Ghana, Kenya, Laos, Niger, 
Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Thailand, and Togo 
(fi
 gure 1). All visa applicants from these countries who 
were 11 years or older and intended to stay for more than 
6 months were included in this study.
All participants were screened for active tuberculosis 
at specifi
 ed health centres (when such health centres 
were unavailable in the country of origin, participants 
had to travel to other countries for screening).12 Briefl
 y, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We updated our recent systematic review of pre-entry 
screening for tuberculosis to include new articles published 
until Nov 19, 2015. In our original search, we searched for 
reports published after Jan 1, 1980, in MEDLINE, Embase, 
LILACS, Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized 
Register, Cochrane Library, Conference Proceedings Citation 
Index—Science, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index—
Social Science & Humanities. Search terms covered the 
populations of interest (migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, 
new entrants, undocumented migrants), the intervention 
(pre-entry screening), and standard terms for tuberculosis. 
Reference lists of included studies were hand searched to 
identify further relevant work. In the updated search, we used 
our original search terms, including “migrants”, “pre-entry 
screening”, and standard terms for tuberculosis. The updated 
search was done in MEDLINE and Embase. The prevalence of 
culture-confi
 rmed cases of tuberculosis detected before entry 
to countries with a low burden of tuberculosis increased with 
increased prevalence in the country of origin, but we found 
little evidence of systematic follow-up of migrants after arrival 
at a national level, and no comprehensive studies that included 
molecular epidemiological data to examine reactivation and 
transmission after arrival.
Added value of this study
In our study we systematically estimate the incidence of, and 
risk factors for, all forms of tuberculosis and bacteriologically 
confi
 rmed pulmonary tuberculosis (ie, those cases that could 
transmit infection) in migrants screened before entry and in 
whom disease was diagnosed after arrival in a country with a 
low incidence of tuberculosis. Risk of active tuberculosis (all 
forms) diagnosed after arrival increased with incidence in the 
country of origin and was higher in migrants with chest 
radiographs compatible with active tuberculosis, but in whom 
disease was not necessarily bacteriologically confi
 rmed. 
Our analysis included comprehensive molecular typing data 
for culture-confi
 rmed cases since 2010, and showed that 
migrants with chest radiographs compatible with active 
tuberculosis, but not diagnosed with tuberculosis before 
entry, were at increased risk of disease assumed to be a result 
of reactivation. The incidence of assumed index cases was 
low, suggesting that migrants screened before entry to 
low-incidence countries pose a negligible public health risk in 
terms of transmission. The introduction of culture testing on 
sputum samples to the pre-entry protocol was associated 
with a decreased risk of tuberculosis notifi
 cation after 
migration, supporting changes by the UK and US 
programmes.
Implications of all the available evidence
Migrants screened for tuberculosis before entry to the UK have 
a continuing risk of developing disease, much of which could 
plausibly be prevented through identifi
 cation and treatment of 
latent infection. Given that incidence peaks in the fourth year 
after arrival, migrants from countries with a high incidence of 
tuberculosis could be included in a catch-up screening 
programme for latent tuberculosis. Improved testing and 
treatment of latent infection could mitigate some of the health 
impact of tuberculosis in migrant groups.

they underwent a standard chest radiograph, and any 
with radiological fi
 ndings compatible with tuberculosis 
(appendix) were required to undergo sputum testing for 
tuberculosis. All testing was done by IOM staff
 . Culture 
testing for those with radiological evidence of disease 
was phased in gradually across sites from 2007, but 
became a requirement at all sites from 2013. Applicants 
without 
radiological 
changes 
compatible 
with 
tuberculosis, and those with radiological change 
suggesting tuberculosis but negative sputum smears 
and cultures, were provided with medical clearance 
certifi
 cates. Those diagnosed with active tuberculosis in 
their country of origin were denied a medical clearance 
certifi
 cate (necessary to obtain a visa) and required to 
complete treatment before repeat screening. We have 
previously 
reported 
fi
 ndings 
about 
participants 
diagnosed in their country of origin.11 In this Article, we 
focus on participants who tested negative for tuberculosis 
at pre-entry screening, but were subsequently diagnosed 
with the disease after arrival in England, Wales, or 
Northern Ireland. Data for all migrants screened before 
entry during the study period were used to link records 
to the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance (ETS) 
system13 to identify subsequent cases of tuberculosis 
notifi
 ed in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland. The 
ETS contains data for all tuberculosis cases notifi
 ed in 
England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, including both 
microbiologically 
confi
 rmed 
cases 
and 
clinically 
diagnosed cases being treated with a full course of 
tuberculosis drugs.
Ethical approval was received for this analysis from 
the University College London research ethics 
committee (3294/002). Data were stored and analysed 
at Public Health England, which has authority under 
the UK Health and Social Care Act 2012 to hold 
and analyse national surveillance data (including 
tuberculosis pre-entry screening programme data) for 
public health and research purposes. As part of the 
screening process, migrants consented for their data 
to be used by Public Health England and NHS 
England. 
Outcomes
Our primary outcomes were cases of all forms of 
tuberculosis (including clinically diagnosed cases), and 
bacteriologically confi
 rmed pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Defi
 nitions and cases for the primary outcomes were 
taken from the ETS.
Secondary outcomes were cases of tuberculosis assumed 
to be due to reactivation on the basis of molecular typing 
data (subsequently referred to as assumed reactivation 
cases or reactivation cases), and cases assumed to have led 
to transmission in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland 
because they were the fi
 rst tuberculosis case in a molecular 
strain typing cluster (subsequently referred to as assumed 
index cases or index cases). Reactivation cases represent 
disease that is potentially preventable through treatment of 
latent infection in migrants, and index cases lead to 
transmission that is potentially preventable. Individuals 
classifi
 ed as index cases and reactivation cases were culture 
confi
 rmed and had mycobacterial interspersed repetitive 
units and variable number tandem repeat (MIRU–VNTR) 
profi
 les, with at least 23 complete loci notifi
 ed in the ETS 
between Jan 1, 2010 (when strain-typing data began to be 
systematically collected), and Dec 31, 2013.14 The index 
cases were identifi
 ed by recorded date of notifi
 cation and 
had a unique 23 MIRU–VNTR strain type compared with 
all previously notifi
 ed cases, but shared their strain type 
with one or more subsequently notifi
 ed cases, suggesting 
possible transmission. Reactivation cases were defi
 ned as 
all cases with a unique 23 MIRU–VNTR strain type. No 
country of birth or geographical restrictions were placed

on ETS data (ie, people from the UK and migrants from 
countries other than the 15 pilot sites were also included). 
All migrants screened by IOM between Jan 1, 2009, and 
Dec 31, 2012, were included in the analysis of secondary 
outcomes. Patients screened before 2009 were excluded to 
reduce potential biases.
Statistical analysis
A full description of the data sources of variables, methods 
of assessment, and details of subgroups chosen for the 
analysis are presented in the appendix. We used a validated 
probabilistic linkage software program,15 Enhanced 
Matching System, to identify active tuberculosis cases 
notifi
 ed in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in the 
migrant cohort by linking the IOM database of migrants 
screened before entry between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2012, 
to ETS-notifi
 ed cases between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2013. 
Cases notifi
 ed in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland 
within 90 days of the issue of a medical certifi
 cate of 
clearance were assumed to be prevalent (not incident) 
tuberculosis missed by pre-entry screening (ie, missed 
prevalent cases), and were excluded from incidence rate 
analyses. Duplicate records were also removed (appendix).
Individuals in our cohort were at risk of tuberculosis 
notifi
 cation from the time they were given a certifi
 cate of 
clearance until the fi
 rst of tuberculosis notifi
 cation, death, 
emigration, or the end of the follow-up period (ie, Dec 31, 
2013). Because data were unavailable to indicate 
immigration to Scotland (although a full UK dataset was 
used, migrants living in Scotland who were diagnosed 
with tuberculosis were not detected by our probabilistic 
linkage software because we did not have their personal 
identifi
 able variables), these events were accounted for 
probabilistically by multiple imputation. Data for long-
term international migration suggested that 7·3% of 
migrants entering the UK between 2006 and 2012 would 
reside in Scotland.16 Therefore, each imputation model 
was programmed to randomly select 92·7% of migrants 
issued with a medical certifi
 cate of clearance to enter the 
cohort as a resident in England, Wales, or Northern 
Ireland.
We also used imputation models to account for dates of 
death and emigration out of the UK to create ten imputed 
datasets, each of which we analysed separately. Mortality 
data for England and Wales from 2009 were used in the 
models for dates of death, and data for UK entry clearance 
visas, which detailed length of stay by type of visa and year 
of issue, were used in the models for emigration from the 
UK (appendix). Analyses of the ten imputed datasets were 
combined by Rubin’s rules17 to account for uncertainty in 
the imputed information (appendix). 
Each imputed dataset was analysed as follows. We used 
univariable and multivariable Poisson regression models 
to identify risk factors for the primary and secondary 
outcomes. Multivariable results were adjusted for 
clustering by individual to take into account repeated 
entries by migrants into the cohort (as a result of 
migrants entering, leaving, and entering again with a 
new visa). In a further analysis, data were stratifi
 ed by 
years since entry to examine incidence over time. We 
present our results as incidence per 100 000 person-years 
and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), with 95% CIs and two-
sided p values.
We did several sensitivity analyses to examine the rules 
used in imputation, deduplication, the period used for 
the defi
 nition of prevalent cases, and that used for strain 
typing data. To create a crude upper bound of reactivation 
incidence, we assumed that the proportion of cases with 
a unique strain type in untyped cases was similar to that 
in typed cases. These sensitivity analyses and the results 
are described in full in the appendix. We used Stata 
(version 13.1) for all statistical analyses.

Results
Between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2012, the IOM screened 
640 808 visa applicants before entry (fi
 gure 2), whose 
records were probabilistically matched to the ETS to 
identify tuberculosis cases with dates of illness onset 
between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2013. After duplicates 
(79 331) and missed prevalent cases (41) were excluded, 
561 436 migrants were left. Assuming that 7·3% of 
migrants moved to Scotland, 519 955 migrant entries to 
England, Wales, and Northern Ireland comprised the 
study cohort, representing 514 968 individual migrants. 
The total length of follow-up for the cohort was 
1 275 569 person-years, with a mean follow-up of 2·45 years

per person. Of the 41 missed prevalent cases identifi
 ed in 
the 90 days after migration, 15 (37%) had pre-entry chest 
radiographs compatible with active tuberculosis (but had 
bacteriologically 
negative 
results 
before 
entry). 
1873 incident cases of all forms of tuberculosis were 
identifi
 ed (ie, diagnosed after migration), a crude incidence 
rate of 147 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 140–154). The 
estimated 
incidence 
of 
bacteriologically 
confi
 rmed 
pulmonary tuberculosis in migrants screened before entry 
was 49 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 45–53).
In a multivariable risk factor analysis adjusted for age 
and sex (table 1), self-report of close or household contact 
with a case of tuberculosis (IRR 3·0, 95% CI 1·8–5·1; 
p<0·0001) and having a screening chest radiograph 
compatible with active tuberculosis but negative 
microbiology results at the time of screening (3·2, 
2·8–3·7; p<0·0001) were strongly associated with 
increased risk of all forms of tuberculosis notifi
 ed in 
England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Migrants from 
countries with WHO-estimated tuberculosis prevalences 
of 40–149 per 100 000 people (0·3, 0·2–0·4; p<0·0001) and 
those from countries with prevalences of 150–349 per 
100 000 people (0·6, 0·5–0·6; p<0·0001) were at lower risk 
of developing tuberculosis than were migrants from 
countries with prevalences greater than 350 per 100 000. 
Visa category and being screened at a site where culture 
testing of sputum samples was done were also signifi
 cantly 
associated with tuberculosis risk (table 1).

Data for screening before entry are for Jan 1, 2006, to Dec 31, 2012; those for the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system are for Jan 1, 2006, to Dec 31, 2013. The overall rate among all notifi
 ed cases of 
tuberculosis was 147 (95% CI 140–154) per 100 000 person-years; among cases of bacteriologically confi
 rmed tuberculosis it was 49 (45–53) per 100 000 person-years. Data for incidence of tuberculosis include 
all forms of disease, including clinically diagnosed cases. Rows in which the IRRs=1·0 are the reference data. IRR=incidence rate ratio.

When all 2353 cases of tuberculosis detected both 
before entry and after migration were considered, most 
 
(1873 [79·6%]) were incident cases notifi
 ed in England, 
Wales, and Northern Ireland, with fewer pre-entry 
prevalent cases (439 [18·7%]) and some missed prevalent 
cases noted with 90 days of migration (41 [1·7%]; 
fi
 gure 3A). The total number of tuberculosis cases in 
migrants declined each year since migration when 
prevalent cases detected at pre-entry screening (who 
were excluded from the cohort because they were 
declined medical certifi
 cates of clearance) and missed 
prevalent cases detected after entry were included 
(fi
 gure 3). Accounting for person time at risk within the 
cohort (and excluding pre-entry and post-entry prevalent 
cases) the incidence of all forms of tuberculosis was 
lowest in the fi
 rst 12 months after migration (61 per 
100 000 person-years, 95% CI 54–69), peaked in the 
fourth year (222, 198–249), and then gradually fell 
(fi
 gure 3B).
318 983 
migrants 
screened 
before 
entry 
with 
648 385 person-years’ follow-up within the cohort formed 
the basis of our examination of assumed reactivation and 
index cases. 650 (68·3%) of 952 notifi
 ed cases of disease 
in this cohort were culture confi
 rmed, and strain typing 
results were available for 529 (81·4%) of the 650. 
301 cases of assumed reactivation were noted, with crude 
estimated incidence of 46 per 100 000 person-years 
(95% CI 42–52). A crude upper bound of reactivation, 
assuming that the proportion of cases with a unique 
strain type in untyped cases was similar to that in typed 
cases, provided an estimate of 91 per 100 000 person-
years (95% CI 82–102). After adjustment for age and sex 
(table 2), compared with migrants from countries with 
tuberculosis 
prevalences 
greater 
than 
350 
per 
100 000 people, those from countries with a prevalence of 
40–149 per 100 000 were at lower risk of reactivation 
(IRR 0·2, 95% CI 0·1–0·9; p=0·034), as were those from 
countries with a prevalence of 150–349 per 100 000 (0·3, 
0·2–0·6; p<0·0001; table 2). Migrants with a chest 
radiograph classifi
 ed as compatible with tuberculosis 
(but that was not bacteriologically confi
 rmed at the time 
of screening) were at increased risk of reactivation (3·9, 
2·7–5·5; p<0·0001; table 2).
35 migrants were assumed index cases for onward 
transmission, resulting in an estimated crude rate of fi
 ve 
per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 4–8). The crude 
incidence rate for index cases was highest in those with 
chest radiographs suggestive of active tuberculosis but 
with negative bacteriology at the time of screening 
(36, 95% CI 19–68); this group had increased risk 
(IRR 9·6, 95% CI 4·4–20·7; p<0·0001) compared with 
those with no abnormalities, after adjustment for age 
and sex.
The results of our analyses were stable across a range 
of sensitivity analyses done to test the data and key 
assumptions in the imputation—full results are 
presented and discussed in the appendix.
Discussion
We present data from an analysis of a cohort of more 
than half a million migrants screened for tuberculosis 
from 15 high-incidence countries between Jan 1, 2006, 
and Dec 31, 2012. Our data suggest that migrants 
screened before entry pose a negligible risk in terms of 
onwards transmission within the host country, but their 
individual risk remains increased, which presents risk to 
their own health.
Our results show that individuals with chest radiographs 
classifi
 ed as compatible with active tuberculosis (but not 
diagnosed as tuberculosis before entry) and those 
reporting a history of close or household contact with a 
case of tuberculosis before migration were associated 
with increased risk of tuberculosis (all forms) and 
bacteriologically confi
 rmed pulmonary disease. Migrants 
who were screened at locations where sputum samples 
were culture tested had a lower risk of developing all 
forms of tuberculosis after arrival in England, Wales, and 
Northern Ireland than those who were not. Incidence of 
all forms of tuberculosis was lowest in the fi
 rst year after 
arrival and peaked in the fourth year, before gradually 
declining, although 95% CIs for estimates in later years 
were wide because of decreasing cohort size. Rates of 
assumed index cases were low, with only 35 cases 
identifi
 ed in total.
All visa applicants from the 15 countries taking part 
in the pre-entry screening pilot were included in 
our analysis, and therefore our results are highly 
representative of migrants from these locations applying 
to stay for 6 months or longer. We identifi
 ed migrants 
screened before entry, not only those self-reporting birth 
outside the UK, and as a result we provide the fi
 rst

national estimates of, and risk factors for, incident 
tuberculosis in migrants screened before entry.
We also provide the fi
 rst national description of strain 
typing data in migrants screened for active tuberculosis 
in the pre-entry programme, based on MIRU–VNTR. 
Compared 
with 
restriction 
fragment 
length 
polymorphism, MIRU–VNTR analysis does not require 
large quantities of DNA (it is a PCR-based method), is 
quicker, and provides a result that can be digitised and 
exchanged between national tuberculosis control 
programmes more easily. Spoligotyping, another PCR-
based method, has less discriminatory power than 
restriction fragment length polymorphism, whereas 
MIRU–VNTR analysis has equivalent or improved 
power compared with analysis of restriction fragment 
length polymorphisms. Additionally, MIRU–VNTR 
analysis is now used by most national tuberculosis 
control programmes that routinely do molecular testing 
of cases.18
Our study has some limitations. The data are highly 
representative of migrants to the UK intending to stay 
for more than 6 months, but do not include those 
intending shorter stays or undocumented migrants and 
asylum seekers.19 However, although undocumented 
migrants and asylum seekers are a particularly 
vulnerable group, their comparatively small numbers 
mean they account for low numbers of notifi
 ed cases. 
Several risk factors for tuberculosis were included in this 
analysis, but no data were available for socioeconomic 
status, relevant clinical conditions (eg, HIV), lifestyle

and behavioural risk factors (eg, smoking, problem drug 
and alcohol use), or history of imprisonment, all of 
which are associated with an increased risk of 
tuberculosis in the UK.20–26
Although there is a high level of certainty that 
individuals who receive an entry visa for the UK 
migrate,27–29 when and whether these individuals leave 
after their visa expires is less sure. We account for the 
uncertain duration of stay and death rates through 
imputation based on data for visa length and national 
death rates. Several sensitivity analyses of the impact of 
these 
assumptions 
were 
stable, 
which 
provides 
reassurance that these data and results are robust.
The strain typing data used in this analysis have several 
important limitations. Firstly, only 68·3% of notifi
 ed 
cases were culture confi
 rmed, 81·4% of which had strain 
typing results in the UK. Cases without a strain type were 
not classifi
 ed with this approach. Furthermore, many of 
the cases that were not culture confi
 rmed are also 
probably  due to reactivation. As a result, there is under-
ascertainment of assumed reactivation cases, making the 
estimates presented here lower bounds of true rates, 
although our estimated upper bound provides a likely 
ceiling to this estimate.25 Secondly, assumed index cases 
might have been underestimated because a unique strain 
might be involved in a cluster with another case that has 
not yet been reported. The sensitivity analysis examining 
clustering by time provides us with some confi
 dence 
that, within this dataset of 4 years of data, this issue 
should be minimal.
Finally, whole-genome sequencing has shown that 
MIRU–VNTR strain typing does not provide a very high 
level of resolution, and that cases with identical strain 
types as identifi
 ed by this process might not be part of 
the same transmission chain,30 which would lead to an 
overestimate in the number of index cases and further 
underestimation of the number of reactivation cases. 
Again, such a scenario is likely to have only a small 
impact on index case rates.30–33 Overall, we believe that, as 
a result of these limitations, the incidence estimates for 
reactivation presented here are probably lower than the 
true values, and the magnitude of bias in assumed index 
cases is expected to be small.
Among people screened before entry, several groups 
are at higher risk of tuberculosis after migration, 
including those on family reunion visas, those from 
especially high-incidence countries, those with positive 
chest radiograph fi
 ndings, and those reporting close or 
household contact with a case of tuberculosis before 
migration (table 1). For these groups, eff
 orts should be 
made to facilitate access to health services, including 
access to latent tuberculosis screening, to reduce the 
risks of poorer health outcomes and transmission to 
others. Improved integration of pre-entry screening 
programmes and health services in the destination 
country will benefi
 t migrants and local populations and 
improve targeted post-entry latent tuberculosis screening 
eff
 orts. A cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis of these data and 
those from previous studies should also be done for 
active pre-entry screening to help to refi
 ne targeting 
screening programmes further.6,11
Our results support continuation of pre-entry 
radiographic screening and culture-based investigation 
of people whose radiographs are consistent with 
tuberculosis. Screening for latent infection could be 
targeted at those from high-incidence countries and 
those with chest radiographs compatible with active 
tuberculosis but negative bacteriological results on initial 
screening. Screening for latent tuberculosis infection 
could be done alongside pre-entry screening or after 
migration. Uptake of such screening is likely to be higher 
if done alongside pre-entry screening, but uptake of 
treatment might be higher if screening is done after 
migration, when migrants are linked into health services. 
Given that incidence peaks 4 years after arrival, people 
who have migrated in the past 5 years from countries 
with very high incidences of tuberculosis might be 
targeted 
in 
a 
catch-up 
programme. 
Screening 
programmes for latent tuberculosis infection should be 
assessed 
and 
their 
cost-eff
 ectiveness 
should 
be 
determined; delivery models should then be adapted in 
light of the fi
 ndings. The data-linkage approach we have 
developed could be used to support such assessments 
and to investigate broader health issues in migrant 
populations.
The fact that only 35 of more than 300 000 migrants 
screened before entry to England, Wales, and Northern 
Ireland were identifi
 ed as assumed index cases suggests 
that, after screening, migrants pose a negligible public 
health risk in terms of transmission. Our study provides 
the basis for several evidence-based improvements to pre-
entry screening of migrants, which, if implemented, will 
contribute to the target of tuberculosis elimination in low-
incidence countries and improving the health of migrants.
