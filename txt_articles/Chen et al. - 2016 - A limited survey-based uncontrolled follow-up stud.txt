Abstract
Experimental ooplasmic transplantation from donor to recipient oocyte took place between 1996 and 2001 at Saint Barnabas
Medical Center, USA. Indication for 33 patients was repeated implantation failure. Thirteen couples had 17 babies. One patient de-
livered twins from mixed ooplasmic and donor egg embryos. A limited survey-based follow-up study on the children is reported: 12
out of 13 parents completed a questionnaire on pregnancy, birth, health, academic performance and disclosure. Parents of a qua-
druplet did not participate. Prenatal development and delivery were uneventful. School grades ranged from good to excellent. Chil-
dren were of good health. Body mass index (BMI) was normal in 12 out of 13 children. One child had chronic migraine headaches,
two mild asthma, three minor vision and three minor skin problems. One boy from a boy/girl twin was diagnosed with borderline
pervasive developmental disorder – not otherwise specified at age 18 months, but with no later symptoms. One couple disclosed the
use of egg donor to their child. One reported intention to disclose; six were undecided and four reported they would not disclose.
This limited follow-up strategy presents a high risk of bias. Parents may not assent to standardized clinical analysis owing to lack of
disclosure to their children.

 Introduction
An experimental study was conducted at Saint Barnabas
Medical Center, Livingston, New Jersey, USA, between 1996
and 2001. The study aimed to improve embryonic develop-
ment after the insertion of ooplasm from oocytes of fertile
donors into oocytes of patients who had experienced re-
peated implantation failure and poor embryo development.
The ooplasmic transfer procedures were carried out in 33 se-
lected couples suffering from infertility and repeated failure
of implantation during several cycles of IVF. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Saint Barnabas
Medical Center in 1996. In the mid 1990s, IVF was moder-
ately successful, but, in many instances, implantation failed
even after transfer of multiple embryos. The relationship
between oocyte aneuploidy and age has been described, but
the incidence of aneuploidy in in-vitro derived embryos was
still largely unknown (Lee et al., 2015; Munné et al., 1995).
Because repeated failure of implantation in this group of pa-
tients was also associated with repeated poor embryonic de-
velopment in vitro, it was hypothesized that the failure could
be caused by cytoplasmic deficiency rather than nuclear/
chromosome abnormalities.
At the same time, nuclear transplantation experiments
in murine models had demonstrated feasibility of altering
the ooplasm using oocytes, zygotes or blastomeres as a
source of cytoplasm (Levron et al., 1995, 1996; Pratt and
Muggleton-Harris, 1988). A preliminary experimental study in
three couples who had previously experienced failed IVF at-
tempts due to abnormal embryo development was con-
ducted and involved methodologies typically used during
nuclear transplantation. This included the use of membrane
relaxants and electro-fusion of small anucleate donor egg
cytoplasts with a mature recipient oocyte. Fertilization rate
was normal, but at least one-half of the zygotes showed ab-
normal development patterns (Cohen et al., 1998). Similar
abnormalities were recently described after transfer of meta-
phase spindles into enucleated oocytes using electrofusion,
to avoid transmission of mitochondrial disease (Richardson
et al., 2015; Tachibana et al., 2009). Ooplasmic transfer by
cytoplast fusion was abandoned after the experimental
electro-fusion attempts failed, and an intra-cytoplasmic in-
jection approach was chosen instead (Cohen et al., 1997,
1998). This technique was selected because of its relative ease
and success when used for injection of a single sperm into an
oocyte for alleviation of male infertility (Palermo et al., 1992).
At the time of the first ooplasmic donation attempt, it was
estimated that more than 20,000 babies had been born after
intracytoplaismic sperm injection (ICSI). A small sample of cy-
toplasm was extracted from anonymous donor eggs and in-
jected into each of the patient’s eggs along with her partner’s
sperm. Ooplasmic transplantation patients were counselled
about the experimental nature of the procedure. The study
was offered to over 100 patients during the 4-year period of
investigation. Only a minority agreed to participate. Four-
teen out of the 33 patients (37 attempts) became pregnant,
three with twin pregnancies and one with a quadruplet preg-
nancy. One singleton pregnancy was lost before a fetal heart-
beat could be detected and testing of the products of
conception showed an XO karyotype (Barritt et al., 2001a).
One twin pregnancy was the result of a mixed embryo transfer
from cytoplasmic transfer and an intact donor egg. One fetus
from another twin pregnancy was also diagnosed as XO and
was selectively terminated. The other female fetus was de-
livered normally. The XO karyotypes were unexpected and
were considered potential adverse effects of the proce-
dure. In total, 13 couples delivered 18 babies who appeared
to be healthy at the time of delivery. Seventeen of these chil-
dren were from the cytoplasmic transfer procedure, and one
baby was from egg donation without cytoplasmic transfer. A
boy from a boy/girl twin was diagnosed with borderline per-
vasive developmental disorder of non-specific origin at 18
months of age (Barritt et al., 2001a).
As cytoplasm contains mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) from the donors were also transferred into the re-
cipient eggs. Embryos that were not suitable for transfer or
cryopreservation were therefore tested for the presence of
donor-derived mtDNA using a fingerprinting approach,
analysing nucleotide sequences of the hyper-variable region
in the D-loop of mtDNA (Brenner et al., 2000). About one-
half of 4-day-old developmentally arrested embryos con-
tained donor-derived mtDNA. Buccal smears from eight
children were checked after birth (Barritt et al., 2001b). Two
of the babies had mtDNA derived from the donor. Mitochon-
drial DNA, unlike nuclear DNA, does not determine pheno-
typic characteristics like eye colour, skin colour or height. As
a third person (the egg donor), however, was involved in the
assisted reproduction process, the popular press referred to
these children as ‘three parent babies’, a provocative but in-
accurate reference (Cohen and Alikani, 2013). The publica-
tion of the finding that two of the eight tested children
retained some mtDNA from the egg donors generated further
controversy and concern in the scientific community. These
concerns led to a number of investigations in animal models
to study the physiological effects of mitochondrial transfer
from one animal to another (Acton et al., 2007; Cheng et al.,
2009; Liang et al., 2009).
In 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration exerted ju-
risdiction over this technology by requiring that an Investi-
gational New Drug application be filed in order to continue
offering this procedure to patients. Saint Barnabas Medical
Center began the application process and continued for 2
years, but abandoned it after loss of funding. No ooplasmic
transplantation procedures were conducted after June 2001.
Our ultimate aim is to discover whether donor mitochon-
dria have persisted in the children and to ascertain the general
health and cognitive abilities of these children. This commu-
nication relays the limited findings of the first phase of our
case series follow-up investigation in which the parents of the
children participated in an online questionnaire about the
health and development of their children. The Institutional
Review Board requested that we conduct a survey study first.
It was argued that the findings would provide insight into how
many, if any, parents would participate in a more standard-
ized and involved second phase study. The age of the chil-
dren ranged from 13–18 years at the time of the study. The
findings must be considered limited, because of the subjec-
tive nature of the survey, the lack of a standardized clinical
follow-up and the broad age range. The information, however,
is nonetheless important and may be of interest to the as-
sisted reproduction technique community, particularly in view
of current discussions surrounding mitochondrial replace-
ment therapies.

 Materials and methods
The current survey was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Saint Barnabas Medical Center (Protocol 13–11; 17
December, 2013). Thirteen parent couples were contacted
by phone, email, or both, to request their participation in the
study. Once consent was obtained, patients were asked to
complete an online questionnaire (QuestionPro software) for
each child that resulted from cytoplasmic donation. The
parents of the quadruplets did not respond to repeated re-
quests. Twelve parents completed surveys for 14 children, as
one couple had dizygotic twins from the procedure and another
patient delivered twins after transferring one embryo from
cytoplasmic transfer and one from egg donation. The survey
asked a series of questions designed with the purpose of as-
sessing physical, emotional, mental and cognitive health and
well-being of the child.
A standard matrix scorecard was part of the survey, and
included 32 questions to assess incidence of childhood dis-
eases, diagnosis of pulmonary, cardiac, liver and kidney dys-
function as well as physical, emotional and learning disabilities.
In two instances, the parents were assisted by an indepen-
dent study coordinator when their answers were incom-
plete or ambiguous. When participants completed the
programme before correcting errors such as gender, the study
coordinator allowed them re-entry to the survey during an
online consultation. Answers were tallied and validated by the
software tool provided by QuestionPro. A second request for
information went out to the parents in response to Repro-
ductive Biomedicine Online’s editorial review process. Par-
ticipants were asked to provide grade point average (GPA) and
current height and weight. The Child and teen calculator, pro-
vided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was
used to calculate BMI (https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/
calculator.aspx).
Results
The period between first participation request and last com-
pleted survey lasted 22 months. Reminder emails and re-
peated phone calls were necessary to remind patients to
complete the surveys. In one case, a survey was started 6
months before it was completed; however, in most cases, once
the survey was started, it was usually completed in less than
1 h. Information of patients with delivery after cytoplasmic
transfer is provided in Table 1. The patient with quadru-
plets (patient 9 in Table 1) did not respond to repeated in-
vitations. The survey questions are outlined in Tables 2 and
3. One set of twins are girls from mixed procedure origin
(Patient 16 in Table 4). As maternal origin was not deter-
mined, information on both girls is included in Table 3 and
Table 4. Shortly after birth, the mother had considered fin-
gerprinting to determine which twin was from egg dona-
tion. Once the children became older, she decided against
testing because one girl’s features were strikingly similar to
the mother. We studied multiple photographs, including those
of the mother when she was a teenager, and although we
agreed that there was a strong resemblance between the
mother and one twin, we concluded that this method was not
full proof and therefore data on both girls were collected and
presented. The first child listed in Table 4 from patient 16
is presumed to be the cytoplasmic transfer child. As a result,
the group of children studied here consisted of nine girls and
five boys; however, only 13 are from cytoplasmic transfer.

Follow up of children after ooplasmic transplantation
 pregnancy, but two used medications for depression and
anxiety, chronic migraine headaches or for asthma. Nine of
the 12 deliveries were vaginal and three were by caesarean
section. The length of labour varied from 5 to 34 h for the
vaginal deliveries. All parents were white. All mothers had
a university degree and three had a postgraduate degree. All
fathers had a university degree and seven had a postgradu-
ate degree. The mean household income was greater than or
equal $100,000 per annum. Two of the 12 couples were di-
vorced at the time of the survey.
Birth weight ranged between 1975 to 4281 g (Table 4). Birth
height ranged from 43.2 to 57.2 cm, but two values were
unknown. Those with assessed APGAR score had normal results
(n = 12). Seven of the babies were born at term (40 weeks).
All others were born between 36 and 40 weeks. No addi-
tional neonatal care was necessary, but one baby spent ad-
ditional days in the neonatal intensive care unit because of
jaundice.
Some contact with the parents of the quadruplets was
maintained until 22 months after delivery but they declined
participation in the survey. The babies were born at 32 weeks.
Two male babies weighed 1446 and 1814 g. Two female babies
weighed 1758 and 1985 g. The children are alive and are at-
tending high school, but other information is currently
unavailable.
Disclosure of egg donor role by parents to children
Only parents of one child had disclosed the use of an egg donor
to their child (Table 2). Possible inheritance of mtDNA was
also disclosed by these parents. Four couples reported having
decided not to disclose treatment information. One re-
ported intending to disclose in the future and the remaining
six couples said they were undecided. The parents who re-
ported that they would disclose egg donation at a future time
answered that they were undecided about disclosure of cy-
toplasmic transfer. Six of the 12 couples disclosed the use of
an egg donor to individuals other than their children. Three
of the six who had not disclosed to anyone were undecided
about disclosure in the future.
Perceived cognitive abilities and academic
performance on record
The parent with boy/girl twins was concerned about the emo-
tional wellbeing of her son and his ability to live indepen-
dently and be a productive person. None of the parents were
concerned about the cognitive development of their chil-
dren. Three parents were concerned about the attention span
of their children. School grades are reported in Table 4. All
attended schools in the USA, hence grades provided in Table 4
represent the US grading system which assigns letter grades
A (4.0 points) to F (0 points) and GPA is calculated based on
the points earned. The grades of the children in the study
ranged from good (B) to excellent (A–A+). Most of the chil-
dren (11/13) had excellent grades. Conversion to grades of
other countries can be found using a conversion formula from
the World Education Services on http://www.wes.org/
gradeconversionguide/index.asp. No child ever repeated a
grade.
Health of children
All parents considered their children to be in good health at
the time of the survey; however, one child was reported to

Follow up of children after ooplasmic transplantation
 suffer from chronic migraine headaches. Accidents or inju-
ries were reported for six children. Two children were hos-
pitalized, one for Norwalk virus and one for a shoulder muscle
tear. Three children had minor surgical procedures. Seven had
allergies. Two children had been diagnosed with mild asthma,
three had minor vision problems, three had minor skin prob-
lems. No liver, kidney, cardiac, lung or neurologic disorders
were reported. No eating disorders or dental problems were
reported; however, this information may be subjective. Height
and weight measurements were used to calculate BMI
(Table 4). Among male children, BMI ranged from 12–77 per-
centile, and in female children from 7–95 percentile. One
female child is obese, but a family history of obesity exists.
One male child from the male/female twin was diagnosed with
borderline attention deficit disorder. He received special edu-
cation for the pre-school year only. He also has had epi-
sodes of depression. A family history of depression was
reported.
Willingness to participate in a second follow-up
study
Three couples have stated their willingness to provide saliva
samples for further studies. One couple has refused to par-
ticipate in future studies, whereas eight were still unde-
cided. Only two couples would allow an in-person clinical
assessment of their children.
Discussion
On the basis of study size and design, the results of this survey
must be considered to be descriptive only. Delivery ap-
peared uneventful in the patients who responded to the
survey. One early miscarriage before fetal heartbeat detec-
tion, however, was diagnosed as XO and another fetus was
also diagnosed with XO. This fetus was selectively reduced
in a twin pregnancy. Both pregnancies were reported previ-
ously (Barritt et al., 2001a). Non-disjunction events arise com-
monly during anaphase of the two maternal meiotic divisions
(Hassold and Hunt, 2009). The two monosomies may have
arisen by the lack of segregation of the sister chromatid pair
during meiosis I or II. The micromanipulation procedure was
only carried out on oocytes with a clear first polar body and
hence if there is an association between the procedure and
loss of a sex chromosome, it could have only occurred in ana-
phase II. As far as we know, this association does not exist
after ICSI for assisted fertilization. Clinically relevant aneu-
ploidies in humans are more commonly associated with events
during maternal meiosis I (Hassold and Hunt, 2009; Nagaoka
et al., 2012).
The grades reported by the parents show that the chil-
dren are doing well in school; however, the parents from the
quadruplet delivery did not respond to repeated requests for
participation. This study is limited because the information
from the quadruplet delivery is essential for providing firm
conclusions. Initial follow-up with the quadruplet family after
birth proceeded for nearly 2 years, but subsequently the
parents did not respond to further contact. Participation or
response rates vary between 31 and 77% in follow-up studies
(Hammarberg et al., 2001 [response rate 55%]; Johansson
et al., 2010; [response rate 55%]; Leiblum et al., 1998 [re-
sponse rate 31%]; Hjelmstedt et al. 2003 [response rate 68%];
McMahon et al., 2003 [response rate 69–77%]; Sundby et al.,
2007 [response rate 42%]). A large group (n = 899) of parents
with children ranging from 4–6 years of age responded to a
survey request by a German team after ICSI (Ludwig et al.,
2008). The response rate was 55.7%. The participation rate
in the current study was 92% (12/13) and compares favourably
to other studies.
None of the parents who completed the survey had any con-
cerns about the physical health of their children. One should,
however, be cautious about possible perception bias. When
asked about the weight of their children, all parents re-
sponded that weight was within normal range. Upon further
request for height and weight information, one female teen-
ager had an elevated BMI at 95th percentile and one girl was
borderline underweight at 7th percentile. Although these fre-
quencies are within normal range (Skinner et al., 2016), it is
known that obesity can be under-reported by parents,
paediatricians and family doctors (Chaimovitz et al., 2008;
Eckstein et al., 2006).
One female child was diagnosed with an unspecified learn-
ing disability reported by the parent. As a result, she re-
ceives extra time when taking tests; however, her reported
GPA indicates excellent performance. There may be a pa-
rental perception bias. Her twin brother was diagnosed with
borderline attention deficit disorder. He was also tested at
18 months, when he was diagnosed with borderline perva-
sive development disorder – not otherwise specified; however,
this initial diagnosis was not confirmed and, reportedly, no
symptoms persist. The child excels in school subjects in which
he has an interest, but achieves average or below average
scores when he is not interested according to his mother. His
reported grades, however, average A. The diagnosis of per-
vasive development disorder – not otherwise specified in chil-
dren before age 3 years is not always confirmed later in life
(Chawarska et al., 2007). Although short-term stability of the
diagnosis is high, there are frequent exceptions, particu-
larly when the first diagnosis is before age 3 years. It is pos-
sible that the male twin falls into the latter category.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, about 11% of children aged between 4 and 17 years (6.4
million) have been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder
in the USA as of 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/
data.html). The incidence of this disorder is within the ex-
pected frequency in this small group of children from cyto-
plasmic donation.
Only one out of 12 parents disclosed the use of donor egg
cytoplasm for IVF to their children. This incidence may be
lower than the disclosure rate to children after the use of stan-
dard egg donation. Recommendations to recipients to dis-
close the use of gamete donation to their offspring has been
long standing as per national and practice guidelines (ESHRE
Task Force on Ethics and Law, 2002; American Society for
Reproductive Medicine, 2004). For parents of children con-
ceived through gamete donation, disclosure is a difficult de-
cision (Klock and Greenfeld, 2004). An earlier study indicated
that nearly 60% of parents disclose or plan to disclose whereas
40% plan not to disclose or are undecided (Greenfeld and Klock,
2004). This finding, however, was contradicted most re-
cently by Isaksson et al. (2012) who reported 94% planning

 to disclose, suggesting that these technologies are becom-
ing more widely accepted and more openly discussed. The lack
of disclosure after ooplasmic transplantation in this group of
patients does not seem to have followed the recent trend.
The underlying reason is unclear, but parental decisions may
have been related to the fact that nuclear DNA is not inher-
ited from donor eggs after cytoplasmic donation. For this
reason, a direct comparison with egg donation cycles may not
be appropriate. It is also possible that the use of an experi-
mental procedure has had an effect on disclosure rate.
The effects of cytoplasmic transfer on embryonic and fetal
development have been modelled experimentally in the
mouse. Significant aberrations of development were re-
ported (Acton et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2009; Liang et al.,
2009). The clinical procedure could not be duplicated in the
mouse model, because cytoplasmic injection is technically dif-
ficult in mouse eggs. The studies involved transferring cyto-
plasm using electro-fusion, a technique that causes egg
activation and may have affected development because of pre-
mature onset of the final stages of meiosis. All studies used
inbred mouse strains, which were used to distinguish between
recipient oocytes and cytoplasmic donor oocytes. Inbred strains
are derived after dozens of sister–brother mating. Exposing
the nucleus of an inbred mouse egg to mitochondria of another
inbred strain is not an appropriate model for human repro-
duction as inbreeding in the human is both rare and unex-
pected. The current clinical findings contradict observations
in animal models (Acton et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2009; Liang
et al., 2009).
In conclusion, we were not able to discern an effect of oo-
plasmic transplantation on children aged between 13 and 18
years, but the power of the investigation was low. The find-
ings in this study are based on subjective assessment crite-
ria and no standardized instruments were used. Given the low
disclosure rate to children, only a limited survey could have
provided an acceptable participation rate. It may be deduced
that long-term follow-up of children undergoing mitochon-
drial replacement therapies to avoid mitochondrial disease
may be of concern even when patients promise to partici-
pate before onset of treatment (Richardson et al., 2015; Wolf
et al., 2015). On the basis of our findings, prolonged medical
follow-up of children from experimental investigations is not
a given even when parents are instructed or requested, agree
to participate, or both. During the years after the first series
of experimental preimplantation genetic screening and pre-
implantation genetic diagnosis, patients consented to undergo
chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, and signed a
consent form stating their approval. They agreed with this
procedure at the time of IVF, but many patients refused to
undergo the test once they became pregnant after their initial
consent. Patients can change their mind within a time-span
of 3–5 months (unpublished observations). US Institutional
Review Boards require that language is added to the consent
form stating that participants may withdraw at any time
without consequences to their standard of care. This lan-
guage was used in the consenting process of ooplasmic trans-
plantation patients. They cannot be legally (or ethically) bound
to the letter of the consent even though this may be disap-
pointing to the investigators. The information presented here
may be of interest to the assisted reproduction technique com-
munity, particularly in view of current discussions surround-
ing mitochondrial replacement therapies.
