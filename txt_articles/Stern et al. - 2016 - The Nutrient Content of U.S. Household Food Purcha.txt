Abstract
Introduction—Little is known about where households shop for packaged foods, what foods and 
beverages they purchase, and the nutrient content of these purchases. The objectives are to 
describe volume trends and nutrient content (food groups and nutrient profiles) of household 
packaged foods purchases (PFP) by store-type.
Methods—Cross-sectional analysis of US households’ food purchases (Nielsen Homescan) from 
2000 to 2012 (n=652,023 household-year observations) with survey weights used for national 
representativeness. Household PFP trends (% volume) by store-type, household purchases of key 
food and beverage groups based on caloric contribution by store-type, and mean caloric and 
nutrient densities (sugars, saturated fat and sodium) of household PFP by store-type are analyzed. 
Data were collected from 2000–2012. Analyses were conducted in 2014–2015.
Results—The proportion of total volume of household PFP significantly increased from 2000 to 
2012 for mass-merchandisers (13.1 to 23.9%), convenience-stores (3.6 to 5.9%) and warehouse-
club (6.2 to 9.8%), and significantly decreased for grocery-chains (58.5 to 46.3%) and non-chain 
grocerys (10.3 to 5.2%). Top common sources of calories (%) from household PFP by food/
beverage group include: savory snacks, grain-based desserts and regular soft-drinks. The energy, 
total sugar, sodium and saturated fat densities of household PFP from mass-merchandisers, 
warehouse-club and convenience-stores were higher, compared to grocery-stores.

 Conclusions—PFP from stores with poorer nutrient density (more energy, total sugar, sodium 
and saturated fat-dense), such as warehouse-club, mass-merchandisers and convenience-stores are 
growing, representing a potential US public health concern.
INTRODUCTION
State and national programs and policies 1–4 focus on building grocery-stores or 
supermarkets in food deserts to improve household food purchases, dietary quality, and 
reduce health disparities. A major concern is that people living in food deserts have limited 
access to healthy foods and relatively easier access to unhealthy foods, diminishing the 
nutritional quality of foods purchased, and ultimately, increasing the risk of obesity and 
nutrition-related chronic diseases. 5 These strategies rely on the assumption that people 
shopping at larger retail stores, e.g., supermarkets, have a better nutrient profile of food 
purchases because supermarkets sell more variety of foods with higher nutritional quality at 
lower prices than other stores (e.g., convenience-stores) and because larger stores have more 
capacity to handle perishables safely and efficiently. 6 Yet, a clear understanding of the 
types of stores where people actually shop for food, the foods they purchase and the nutrient 
profile of their purchases is lacking. Furthermore, we have no literature on how store 
selection for food shopping changes over time.
Most studies looking at associations of the food environment with diet and health lack data 
on where people shop for food, what they actually purchase, or information on the nutrient 
profile of these purchases. 7–10 Studies on where people shop for food rely on the presence 
of stores located within people’s residential food environment 11, 12 or the location of 
people’s principal food store source.13, 14 These studies make inferences about the types of 
stores where people shop for food and associations with diet or health without directly 
linking foods consumed to the stores where foods were purchased.15 Additionally, these 
studies fail to capture all the possible stores where people may shop. The few food purchase 
studies use small samples 16–18 and have focused on specific food groups, ignoring the 
entire set of purchases made at the store. 19, 20 Moreover, studies have collected data on a 
limited number of days of purchases, 21 failing to capture usual shopping habits.
To address these gaps, we utilized the Nielsen Homescan dataset, a nationally representative 
sample of US households. Homescan is unique for studying packaged food purchases (PFP - 
foods and beverages with a barcode) across stores since households’ record the store source 
and all packaged foods and beverages purchased from every shopping occasion over one or 
more years. Improving our food environment includes a key focus on PFP, which accounts 
for 78% of store-based food expenditures. 22 This analysis focuses on three research 
questions: (1) at what types of stores do US households shop for food?; (2) does store-type 
shopping change over time?; and (3) does nutrient profile and types of foods/beverages 
purchased by US households vary by store-type?

 METHODS
Study design and population
We used PFP (i.e., all foods and beverages with a barcode) data from the US Homescan 
Consumer Panel dataset from 2000–2012. 23 Participating households receive barcode 
scanners, and are instructed to scan barcodes on all purchased items and report the outlet’s 
name upon returning home after every shopping trip. Scanning occurred continuously 
through the year and included products purchased from all outlet channels. For inclusion in 
the panel, households needed to report ≥10 months of purchases. Demographic 
characteristics and household size were collected by questionnaire. Homescan uses direct 
mailing (targeting low-income and racial-ethnic minority groups) and Internet to recruit 
households. Homescan uses an open cohort study design. Households may exit any time, 
and new households are enrolled to replace dropouts based on demographic and geographic 
targets. 24 Households were sampled from 76 markets, (52 metropolitan and 24 non-
metropolitan areas), and were weighted to be nationally representative.
This study included all households from 2000 to 2012 (n=670,782 household-year 
observations). We conducted cross-sectional analysis, treating each survey year as an 
independent nationally representative sample of US households. To ensure we capture usual 
purchases, we excluded household-quarter observations deemed unreliable (<$135 worth of 
PFP in four week period for ≥2 member household and <$45 for single-member household) 
and household-year observations including >1 unreliable quarter. This excluded 2.1% of 
household-year observations. The final analytical sample included 652,023 household-year 
observations. Analyses were conducted in 2014–2015.
Nutrient content of PFP
To determine the nutritional content of household PFP, each uniquely barcoded product 
captured in Homescan was linked with Nutrition Facts Panel data. Methodology for this 
process has been described elsewhere. 25, 26 Non-packaged foods were not included (e.g. 
many produce, meats, breads, prepared foods, etc.) because products without barcodes 
cannot be scanned. However, produce and meats that are packaged are included (e.g., bag of 
apples, frozen meats, etc.).
Store categorization
For every shopping occasion made over a year, each household reported the name of the 
store where they shopped for food. To define store-type, we used Nielsen’s store 
categorization based on the size, annual sales/revenue and proportion of items in stock. 
Consequently, some of the industry categorizations, such as the supermarkets/grocery-store 
sector, represent a heterogeneous group of stores. Therefore, we used the name of the store 
and Internet searches to further classify the supermarkets/grocery-store sector into 
corporate-owned grocery-chains (≥10 stores); non-chain grocery (<10 stores); ethnic-stores; 
and specialty-stores, using 2012 information. Based on the mean proportion of volume of 
PFP from each store-type, we combined ethnic with specialty-stores, and convenience with 
dollar and drug stores. Finally, we classified stores into 7 mutually exclusive categories: 1) 
warehouse-club (e.g., Costco, Sam’s); 2) mass-merchandisers-supercenters, hereafter mass-

 merchandisers (e.g., Walmart, Super-Target); 3) grocery-chains (≥10 units; e.g., Kroger, 
Safeway); 4) non-chain grocery (<10 units); 5) convenience-drug-dollar, hereafter 
convenience-stores (e.g., Seven Eleven, CVS, Dollar General); 6) ethnic-specialty; and 7) 
others (e.g., department stores, book stores). Our analyses focused on the first six store-types 
because “others” represented a heterogeneous group.
PFP by store-type
To fully capture usual shopping habits, we conducted all analyses at the household-year 
level. To understand at what store-types US households shop and whether store-type 
shopping changed over time, we calculated the proportion of volume purchases by store-
type. We selected volume because it captures low-caloric and non-caloric foods and 
beverages possibly missed in the calorie trends.
To understand whether the nutrient profile and types of foods/beverages purchased by US 
households vary by store-type, we calculated four measures: (1) caloric and nutrient 
densities (g of total sugar, g of saturated fat and mg of sodium) per 100 g of household PFP 
by store-type; (2) grams of PFP per-household per-day by store-type; (3) percentage of 
store-type proportion of calories and volume by food and beverage group (Appendix 1); and 
(4) per-household per-day absolute number of calories and volume by food and beverage 
group by store-type. We used nutrient densities since households purchased different 
amounts of packaged foods/beverages by store-types and used the absolute volumes to put 
density measures in context.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using Stata 13 (StataCorp LP) using survey commands to 
generate nationally representative estimates, incorporating Nielsen annual household 
sampling weights while accounting for repeated observations and market-level clustering.27
We calculated the contribution of each store-type as a percentage of total volume purchased. 
We regressed percent volume on indicator variables for store-type, year and store-type year 
interactions. We used margins– command in Stata to predict weighted unadjusted mean 
percentage volume from each store-type across all households from 2000 to 2012. We used 
regression models to test linear trends. Pairwise comparisons were used to test differences 
between stores at a given year, using grocery-chains as the referent group. A two-sided 
p<0.001 denotes statistical significance, accommodating multiple comparisons and the large 
sample size.
To explore nutrient profile differences by store-type, we calculated weighted unadjusted 
mean caloric and nutrient densities of household PFP in 2000, 2006, and 2012. Analyses 
were performed separately for each store-type. Only households with PFP from a given 
store-type were included in the analysis, therefore we cannot perform statistical testing. 
Densities reflect what households are actually purchasing at each store-type and are driven 
by what each store-type offers and what customers decide to buy.
To identify top contributors to each store-type, we separately ranked food groups and 
beverage groups purchased by households using weighted unadjusted mean proportion and

 absolute number of calories (and volume) in 2000, 2006 and 2012. Analyses were performed 
separately for each store-type. Only households that purchased foods/beverages from a 
given store-type were included in the analysis, therefore we cannot perform statistical tests.
Sensitivity analysis
The nutrient profile of household purchases by store-type may vary due to purchases from 
products without barcodes or Nutrition Facts Panel information, especially if households 
purchase different amounts of such products from different store-types. While we do not 
have nutrient data, we have information on household expenditures on non-packaged foods 
for a Homescan subsample from 2007–2011. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
determine whether the proportion of non-packaged foods and non-packaged food groups 
varied by store-type or time. We estimated: (1) mean proportion of household expenditures 
on non-packaged vs. packaged foods by store-type among the total sample and; (2) mean 
proportion of household expenditures by non-packaged food groups by store-type among 
non-packaged food consumers. Analyses were performed separately for each store-type.
RESULTS
Sociodemographic and household characteristics for selected years are shown in Appendix 
2, and sample characteristics by store-type are shown in Appendix 3. Homescan had a 
higher proportion of white-non Hispanics, households with some college education, middle 
income and multiperson households with children, regardless of survey year. The proportion 
of Hispanics, black-non Hispanics, and households with college and post college graduates 
increased over time.
Figure 1 shows trends in annual volume (%) from household PFP by store-type from 2000–
2012. Volume from grocery-chains and non-chain grocery’s significantly decreased over 
time, while volume from warehouse-club, mass-merchandisers and convenience-stores 
significantly increased over time. Regardless of year, grocery-chains represented the biggest 
contributor to total volume from household PFP. Trends in calories (%) were similar to 
trends in volume.
Figure 2 shows the caloric and nutrient profile of household PFP and the absolute number of 
mean grams per-household per-day from PFP by store-type in 2000, 2006, and 2012. The 
caloric, total sugar and saturated fat densities of household PFP from mass-merchandisers, 
warehouse-club and convenience-stores decreased over time, but remained higher than the 
other store-types in 2012. The caloric, total sugar and saturated fat densities of household 
PFP from grocery-chains, non-grocery chains and ethnic-specialty stores remained stable 
over time. The sodium density of household PFP from all store-types, besides non-grocery 
chains, decreased from 2000 to 2006, but rose again in 2012. Household PFP from non-
grocery chains, warehouse-club stores, and convenience-stores had the highest sodium 
density in 2012. Grocery-chains consistently had the lowest caloric and better nutrient 
densities.

contribution to total calories purchased by store-type in 2000, 2006 and 2012. The biggest

 differences are not in the top sources of calories, but rather the proportion of total calories 
purchases by store-type. Top common sources of calories (%) from household PFP by food 
group across store-types in all years include: savory snacks and grain-based desserts. One 
major difference is convenience-stores – more than 35% of calories purchased there come 
from candy and gum in all years. For the top common sources of beverage calories (%), 
households purchased about a third of beverage calories from regular soft drinks and from 
fruit drinks/juices at convenience-stores and mass-merchandisers, respectively in all years. 
Overall, all other store-types had fresh milk as the dominant beverage. Volume estimates are 
available in Appendix 4.
Sensitivity analysis
For a given store-type, the mean proportion of dollars spent by households on non-packaged 
foods/food groups did not vary over time. However, we observed differences in mean 
proportion of dollars spent on non-packaged foods across store-types. For example, in 2011, 
household expenditures on non-packaged foods was higher in ethnic-specialty (36.5%) and 
non-grocery chains (38.9%), compared to convenience-stores (5.3%) and mass-
merchandisers (9.1%) (Appendix 5.)
DISCUSSION
There has been a rapid transformation of the food retail sector. 28 In this sample, shopping at 
grocery-chains decreased over time, while shopping at mass-merchandisers, warehouse-club 
and convenience-stores rose over time. However, grocery-chains still account for the 
majority of household PFP. Our results agree with a marketing report showing that shoppers 
are increasingly shopping at mass-merchandisers and warehouse-clubs. 29 In addition to 
increasing shopping at non-grocery stores, purchases at these store-types are of lower 
nutritional quality. While energy-dense diets have been associated with obesity, elevated 
insulin levels and metabolic syndrome in US adults, 30, 31 the results here are on purchases, 
not diets. Relating household PFP to individual intake is challenging considering consumer-
level food waste associated with households PFP. 32 Further, no US recommendations for 
the nutrient content of purchases exist. Future studies should determine whether differences 
in nutrient densities by store-type translate to higher total energy intake, poor dietary quality, 
or weight gain at the individual level.
Literature on the relationship between food environment and its association to diet has paid 
insufficient attention to the types of stores where people shop for food, what they actually 
purchase and the nutrient profile of those purchases. 33 Our study demonstrates that food 
and beverage groups such as savory snacks, grain-based desserts, fruit drinks/juices, fresh 
plain milk, and regular soft-drinks were the top sources of calorie purchases by US 
households across all types of stores, regardless of time. Our results are consistent with 
studies of food group intake by US children and adults, where energy-dense and nutrient-
poor foods such as SSB, salty snacks and grain-based desserts were major contributors to 
dietary energy intake. 34–36 These food/beverage groups are major sources of added sugars, 
saturated fat and sodium. Our study shows that households are purchasing these products 
across all store-types suggesting that both, small and large stores, stock large quantities of

 low-nutrient foods that might contribute to weight gain and affect health. Much of the 
literature focuses on the relationship between store-type availability with diet and health. 
However, it may not only be store-type availability that matters, but the fact that unhealthy 
foods/beverages are ubiquitous and households are purchasing them everywhere. 
Additionally, more should be done to encourage non-grocery retailers to stock and promote 
purchases of healthier products at better prices relative to less-healthy foods. 37
Important strengths of this study are that we know the types of store where households 
shopped, what foods and beverages they actually purchased and we have linked nutrient data 
to those purchases. Moreover, we were able to study PFP trends over a period of 13 years. 
Additionally, to avoid bias from dietary self-reported assessment methods, purchase data 
were collected by objective scanning of barcodes for PFP. Lastly, we collected data for PFP 
during the course of an entire year, reflecting households’ usual purchases.
Limitations
A key limitation is that our study does not account for the role of individual choice on where 
households shop, which is a complex decision affected by many factors. The four P’s of 
marketing: product, price, promotion, and placement, influence food purchasing 
decisions 38–41 along with individual food preferences, 5 transportation, and time. 42, 43 Our 
results are a combination of where households choose to shop and what the store offers.
Additionally, we are unable to verify whether all household PFP from all store-types and 
trips were scanned. Systematic underreporting is possible if households are less likely to 
scan purchases that occurred “on-the-go” and never made it home, especially from 
convenience-stores. Our results could underestimate the nutrient profile of purchases from 
convenience-stores; however, we found that purchases from convenience-stores already 
have one of the “worst” nutrient profiles. Another limitation is our lack of non-packaged 
food purchase detailed data, as extensive public health efforts are placed on increasing 
produce purchases. While unpackaged produce are excluded, purchases from food 
categories such as frozen, canned and barcoded produce are included, as are most whole 
grains and legumes. Sensitivity analysis of expenditure of non-packaged foods showed that 
dollars spent on non-packaged foods/non-packaged foods categories remained stable over 
time at each store-type. Conversely, we observed differences in non-packaged food 
expenditures between store-types. This may reflect availability of these types of food at the 
different store-types as well as individual preferences. Differences in non-packaged foods 
between store-types may influence the nutrient profile of total purchases, especially if non-
packaged foods purchased are of better nutrient quality at certain store-types. It is important 
to recognize that not all non-packaged food purchases are produce or “healthy.” Many of the 
non-packaged food purchases are deli meats, cheeses or prepared foods, however no nutrient 
data are available for these items. Additionally, Homescan does not capture away-from-
home purchases. The lack of data on non-store sources of food (e.g., food service, schools), 
or non-packaged foods means we are unable to describe overall nutrient profile of total food 
purchases.
Although sampling weights were used, studies have questioned whether household 
characteristics of Homescan match the sociodemographic characteristics of the US

 population. 44 However, validation studies found that the accuracy of the Homescan data at 
measuring purchases at the national level was comparable to other widely used economic 
datasets. 45 Moreover, elsewhere we showed that trends in Homescan purchase data mirror 
trends in NHANES food intake from stores. 46
Conclusions
We found that grocery-chains account for the majority of household PFP. However, growing 
volume trends of household PFP from store-types with poorer nutrient density (more energy, 
total sugar, sodium and saturated fat-dense), such as warehouse-club, mass-merchandisers, 
and convenience-stores, could pose a potential US public health concern. Additionally, less 
healthy food/beverage groups such as grain-based desserts, salty snacks, fruit drinks/juices 
and regular soft-drinks are top calorie contributors to household purchases from all types of 
stores. The results of this study lead to an important policy question: should policy 
initiatives rely on increasing physical access to stores and helping stores sell different food 
groups to encourage healthier purchases, or are those efforts negated by people choosing to 
shop at stores that offer foods in line with their dietary preference? Our results suggest that 
the same food/beverage groups would be purchased at any store-type; however, people may 
buy relatively unhealthier food/beverage products at selected store-types. Future research is 
needed to account for selection of store-types where households shop and how different 
race-ethnic and sociodemographic groups are associated with the nutrient quality of PFP by 
store-type.

 Figure 1. Trends in the proportion of annual volume from household PFP by store-type, 
Homescan 2000–2012
Values represent unadjusted means using survey weighted linear regression models. * 
Denotes significant linear trends in the contribution of a given store-type to purchases (% 
volume). For all years, comparisons were made between stores, using grocery-chains as the 
referent group. All comparisons between stores were significantly different at a p<0.001 to 
account for multiple comparisons and sample size. Data comes from the 2000–2012 Nielsen 
Homescan panel of household packaged food purchases. All values are weighted to be 
nationally representative. Percentages labeled within the graph represent estimates in 2000, 
2006, and 2012. Number of household-year level observations: n=652,023. University of 
North Carolina calculation based in part on data reported by Nielsen through its Homescan 
Services for all food categories, including beverages and alcohol for the 2000–2012 
periods, for the U.S. market. Copyright © 2014, The Nielsen Company.

 Figure 2. Caloric, total sugar, sodium and saturated fat densities from household PFP by store-
type, Homescan 2000, 2006, and 2012
(A) caloric density (kcal/100g); (B) sugar density (g/100g); (C) sodium density (mg/100g); 
(D) saturated fat density (g/100g). Values represent weighted unadjusted means. Values 
above bars in panel (A) indicate the mean absolute number of grams households purchased 
per-day by store-type for 2000, 2006 and 2012 (top, middle, and bottom, respectively). 
Analyses were performed separately for each store-type. Our statistical testing focused on 
the trends analysis. For these analyses, we could not statistically compare across store-types 
due to differences in samples for each store-type. Data comes from the 2000, 2006 and 2012 
Nielsen Homescan panel of household packaged food purchases. All values are weighted to 
be nationally representative. University of North Carolina calculation based in part on data 
reported by Nielsen through its Homescan Services for all food categories, including 
beverages and alcohol for the 2000–2012 periods, for the U.S. market. Copyright © 2014,

aPercentages and means have been weighted to be nationally representative. Data comes from the 2012 Nielsen Homescan panel of household packaged food purchases. An observation represents all purchases made by a single household over a period of ≥10–12 months. The 
number of year-household observations by store are not mutually exclusive as some households might have purchased foods at different store-types. Our statistical testing focused on the trends analysis. For these analyses, we could not statistically compare across store-types due 
to different samples for each store-type.
Fruit drinks and juice (includes fruit and vegetable drinks and juice); Tea (bags, loose, ready-to-drink); Dairy drinks (refrigerated sweetened); Concentrates (Beverage powder and concentrates); Soft drinks, regular (>20 kcal/100g); Soft drinks, diet (≤ 20 kcal/100g).
University of North Carolina calculation based in part on data reported by Nielsen through its Homescan Services for all food categories, including beverages and alcohol for the 2000–2012 periods, for the U.S. market. Copyright © 2014, The Nielsen Company.
