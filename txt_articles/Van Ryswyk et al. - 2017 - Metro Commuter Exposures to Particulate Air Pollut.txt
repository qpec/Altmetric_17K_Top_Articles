ABSTRACT: System-representative commuter air pollution exposure data
were collected for the metro systems of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver,
Canada. Pollutants measured included PM2.5 (PM = particulate matter),
PM10, ultrafine particles, black carbon, and the elemental composition of
PM2.5. Sampling over three weeks was conducted in summer and winter for
each city and covered each system on a daily basis. Mixed-effect linear
regression models were used to identify system features related to
particulate exposures. Ambient levels of PM2.5 and its elemental components
were compared to those of the metro in each city. A microenvironmental
exposure model was used to estimate the contribution of a 70 min metro
commute to daily mean exposure to PM2.5 elemental and mass
concentrations. Time spent in the metro was estimated to contribute the
majority of daily exposure to several metallic elements of PM2.5 and 21.2%,
11.3% and 11.5% of daily PM2.5 exposure in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, respectively. Findings suggest that particle air
pollutant levels in Canadian metros are substantially impacted by the systems themselves, are highly enriched in steel-based
elements, and can contribute a large portion of PM2.5 and its elemental components to a metro commuter’s daily exposure.
■ INTRODUCTION
Few studies have examined air pollution exposure in Canadian
transportation environments.1,2 However, existing evidence
suggests that metro environments may be associated with
elevated levels of air pollutants including fine (PM2.5, where PM
= particulate matter) and coarse (PM2.5−10) particulate air
pollution and PM-associated elements such as heavy metals.3−8
In consideration of this, the activity of commuting may
represent a significant proportion of daily exposure to these
pollutants for metro commuters.9−11
The Urban Transportation Exposure Study (UTES) was
conducted from 2010 to 2013 to characterize air pollution
exposures in major transit modes (private vehicles, metro
systems, and buses) in Canadian metropolitan centers. The
results of the private vehicle monitoring campaign were
reported previously.12 This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of metro commuting exposures in Toronto, Montreal,
and Vancouver which are all rail-based, predominantly grade-
separated (underground or elevated) systems designed to
provide rapid transit across large geographic areas. Metro
commuting in Canada is significant by North American
standards, with Montreal’s 1.24M (M = millions), Toronto’s
1.09M, and Vancouver’s 0.39M daily ridership figures
representing the third, fourth, and tenth highest in North
America, respectively.13
The objectives of this study were to characterize exposures to
particulate air pollutants in Canadian metro systems, evaluate
system features as determinants of these exposures, compare
metro PM2.5 mass and elemental concentrations to that of
ambient air, and estimate the proportion of daily PM2.5 mass
and elemental exposure that can originate from time spent in
the metro environment. This study is the first to investigate PM
and PM-associated elemental exposures in Canadian metro
systems and, to our knowledge, the first to assess metro
exposures system-wide.

 subway, the Montreal, Quebec Metro, and the SkyTrain of
Vancouver, British Columbia. These systems represent the
three largest rail-based commuter systems in Canada. They are
similar in length at approximately 68 km but vary in other
design features (summarized in Table 1). The main system
design differences between the metro systems of these cities
deal with their wheel design and the proportion of each system
which is below-grade. The Toronto and Vancouver metros use
steel wheels rolling on steel track, while the Montreal metro
features rubber wheels on concrete rollways. The Vancouver
metro is largely at-grade and elevated outdoors (10 of 47
stations are below-grade), while the Toronto metro is
predominantly below-grade (55 of 69 stations are below-
grade), and the Montreal metro is entirely below-grade.
Sampling was conducted in each metro system for three
consecutive weeks in the summer and winter seasons (Toronto
and Montreal: summer 2010 and winter 2011; Vancouver:
winter and summer 2013). In each city, three technicians
carried personal sampling backpacks (Figure S1) and were
assigned to one of three separate segments of the system. Each
segment was approximately equal in their number of stations
and length. Together, they constituted all stations and rail
segments of the system with the exception of the Montreal
metro where the “yellow line” (consisting of an additional two
stations) was excluded for logistical reasons. Technicians
sampled on weekday mornings (7−10 AM) and evenings
(3−6 PM) and followed a pattern of boarding and
disembarking at each station in their segment. Upon
encountering the end of a line, they switched directions. This
could be done inside a station and required no interruption of
data collection. Each 3 h sampling session began at the station
at which sampling ended in the preceding 3 h sampling session.
Personal exposures measured while the technicians were
waiting on the platform are referred to as “waiting” exposures,
while those measured on the train are referred to as “riding”
exposures. Waiting exposures were sampled at the middle of
each platform, and riding exposures were sampled at the middle
of each train.
Continuous Air Pollution Monitoring. Continuous
monitoring was carried out for PM2.5 (TSI DustTrak 8520),
ultrafine particles (UFP) (CPC, TSI model 3007), and black
carbon (BC) (AethLabs MicroAeth-51). Geographic location
data were collected using a global position recorder (GlobalSat
DG-100). Digital voice recordings (DVR) were used to identify
periods of riding and waiting and to record station names.
Sampling inlets for the air pollution monitors were connected
to shoulder straps to sample the technicians’ breathing zones.
All continuous instruments were factory calibrated before each
seasonal sampling campaign. Ultrafine particle concentrations
over 100 000 pts/cm3 were corrected for bias.14 Further detail
on continuous data quality assurance, control, and management
are provided in the Supporting Information.
Integrated Air Pollution Sampling. Technicians col-
lected integrated samples of PM2.5 and PM10 mass concen-
trations using the PM2.5 and PM10 personal environmental
monitors (PEMs) of the Chempass system (Chempass System
R&P/Thermo).15 A personal sampling pump (SKC Leland)
was connected to two PEMs (one PM2.5 and the other PM10)
providing each with 4.0 L per minute of air flow. Integrated
samples reflected 1 week periods (ten 3 h sessions, 30 h total)
to ensure detectable levels of PM-associated elements. This
resulted in the collection of 18 samples per city for each size
fraction. Filters were analyzed gravimetrically following EPA
guidelines. Inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) was used to determine elemental concentrations of
PM. Further detail on integrated sampling is provided in the
Supporting Information.
Relating Metro Exposures to System Features. Metro
levels of PM2.5 and UFP were analyzed as a function of system
features while controlling for meteorology. Factors of depth,
elevation, percent coverage, distance to outside, and section age
were selected for evaluation as determinants of exposure on
account of their potential relationship with metro ventilation.
“Depth” represented the below-grade distance from the ground
surface to the rail segment or platform. Independent of “depth”,
“elevation” represented the ground level height above sea level.
“Percent coverage” was defined as the proportion of a platform
or rail segment covered or below grade, while “distance to
outside” represented the distance to the closest above-grade
section of the system. The section age was calculated for each
station and rail segment and is based on the year of
construction and the time of sampling. Further detail on the
nature and derivation of system feature information is provided
in the Supporting Information. Analyses relating system
features to measured exposures were conducted while
controlling for the effect of meteorology and ambient PM2.5
levels. Meteorological data including temperature, relative
humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric pressure
were obtained from monitoring stations operated by Environ-
ment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Hourly central
site ambient PM2.5 data were downloaded from ECCC’s
National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network Web site.
For each city, continuous data concurrent with metro sampling
were downloaded from NAPS sites employing tapered element
oscillating microbalance monitors (TEOMs) or synchronized
hybrid ambient real-time particulate monitors (SHARPs). Data
from multiple stations (4 in Toronto, 14 in Montreal, 17 in
Vancouver) were downloaded and averaged on an hourly basis
to one regional value.
Multivariate mixed-effects linear regression models were used
to examine the effect of system features on the levels of PM2.5
and UFPs, while controlling for meteorology. Regional PM2.5
levels were also controlled for in PM2.5 models. Separate
models were examined for data representing below-grade
sections and above-grade sections (Toronto and Vancouver
only, as the Montreal metro is completely below grade).

 exposure levels were calculated using the “proc mixed”
procedure in SAS EG 5.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). PM2.5 and UFP exposures were modeled with a
generalized linear mixed model with an autoregressive
covariance structure (AR1) to account for the lack of
independence between repeated weekly measurements as well
as clustering by each rail segment/station and season (eq 1).

were assessed by calculating Cook’s distances. Residual plots
were assessed for normality using the Shapiro−Wilk statistic.
Predictor parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals
were exponentiated to provide estimates of percent change in
exposure per unit increase.
Metro versus Ambient PM2.5. In each city, the
concentration and elemental composition of PM2.5 between
the metro and ambient environments were compared. As each
city’s metro environment was represented by the 18 PM2.5
samples collected in the study, ambient levels were
characterized by the concurrent gravimetric PM2.5 data
collected by the ECCC NAPS network. The ECCC conducts
the routine collection of 24 h gravimetric PM2.5 for several
stations across Canada every 3 days. Ambient gravimetric PM2.5
mass and elemental concentration data was available for one
NAPS station in each city. NAPS data collected during and
within 2 weeks of each three-week metro sampling period was
downloaded to represent ambient levels of PM2.5 and its
elemental composition.
The NAPS network employs the dichotomous air sampler
(R&P/Thermo Scientific) for the collection of gravimetric
PM2.5 data. The dichotomous air sampler is listed as an
“equivalent method” by the US EPA.16 The PM2.5 PEM of the
Chempass system has been shown to have excellent agreement
with the PM2.5 measures of dichotomous sampler (R2 = 97%)
with a median positive bias of 11%.17 For the purpose of
comparing metro PM2.5 to that of ambient, all metro PM2.5
mass and elemental concentrations were adjusted for this 11%
bias. Both metro and NAPS gravimetric PM2.5 samples were
analyzed for elemental content using ICPMS. Abundance ratios
for metro and ambient PM2.5 were calculated (eq 2).

Contribution of Metro Commute to Daily PM2.5
Exposures. Microenvironmental models were developed to
estimate the contribution of metro commuting to overall daily
exposures of PM2.5 mass and elemental concentrations. The
elements included in this analysis were all those which (i) were
considerably higher in metro versus ambient, (ii) are known to
be related to metro steel and brake composition, and (iii) were
measured to be above detection for >50% of samples in both
the metro and ambient environments.
A key factor in these estimates is the amount of time spent in
the metro. Measures of daily time spent in rail-based
transportation, including train, subway, or rapid transit, were
quantified in the Canadian Human Activity Pattern Survey 2
(CHAPS2).18 Based on this survey, collected from a
representative sample of people living in Edmonton, Montreal,
Vancouver, Toronto, and Halifax, an average of 70 min per day
was determined for those that use the metro for transportation
(Dr. Carlyn J. Matz, personal communication).
The formula for calculating the contribution of metro
commuting to overall daily PM2.5-elemental components is
presented in eq 3. GmetroPM2.5jk represents the estimated
contribution of a typical 70 min metro commute to daily
PM2.5 exposure for element j in city k, XmetroPM2.5jk represents
the mean PM2.5 concentration of element j sampled in metro of
city k, XAmbientPM2.5jk is the mean PM2.5 concentration of element
j sampled in city k, and APEM:Dichot represents the correction
factor for the 11% positive bias of the PEM, relative to the
dichotomous sampler.17

In the calculation of the proportion of daily PM2.5
attributable to time spent in the metro, metro PM2.5 was
calculated as a weighted average between time spent on
platforms (10 minbased on train frequencies during rush
hour) and time spent in trains (60 min). PM2.5 exposures
specific to these two microenvironments were taken from
averaged continuous data collected by the DustTrak which was
found to be in excellent agreement with the gravimetric method
of this study (Figure S2). In eq 4, the formula for calculating
the contribution of metro commuting to overall daily PM2.5 is
presented where GmetroPM2.5j represents the estimated contribu-
tion of a typical 70 min metro commute to daily PM2.5 exposure
for city j, XplatformPM2.5j represents the mean PM2.5 platform
exposure for city j, XridingPM2.5j represents the mean PM2.5 riding
exposure for city j, XAmbient PM2.5j is the mean ambient PM2.5

correction factor for the 11% positive bias of the PEM, relative
to the dichotomous sampler.17

Preliminary data analyses included descriptive statistics,
distribution plots, and interpollutant correlations (Pearson’s
R, Spearman’s ρ). Statistical tests of difference were applied at
the 5% significance level via the nonparametric Kruskal−Wallis
test. Statistical analyses and graphics were carried out using SAS
EG 5.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Pollutant maps
were created using ArcGIS 10 (ESRI 2011, ArcGIS Desktop:
Release 10, Redlands, CA: Environmental Systems Research

 ■ RESULTS
Air Pollution Exposures. Median PM2.5 exposures were
markedly higher in Toronto (95 μg/m3) than in Montreal (35
μg/m3) and Vancouver (19 μg/m3) (Table 2). Median PM10
exposures trended similarly, with Toronto levels (272 μg/m3)
nearly three times higher than Montreal (104 μg/m3) and over
five times higher than Vancouver (50 μg/m3).
Continuously monitored PM2.5 data agreed well with
gravimetric samples (Figure S2). Between-city differences in
UFP exposures were less dramatic than for PM2.5 with mean
UFP exposures highest in Montreal (19.5 × 103 pts/cm3)
followed by Vancouver (12.6 × 103pts/cm3) and Toronto (10.5
× 103 pts/cm3) (Table 3). BC showed the same intercity trend
as PM2.5 with mean levels highest in Toronto (7.8 μg/m3),
followed by Montreal (4.6 μg/m3) and Vancouver (2.8 μg/m3).
Exposure Trends by Season, Platform/Train, and
Above/Below-Grade. Median metro exposures by season
(winter/summer) and commuting activity (waiting/riding) are
shown in Figures S3−S5 for PM2.5, UFP, and BC, respectively.
Statistics for these comparisons are presented in Table S3 with
the comparison of above-grade/below-grade sections included
for Toronto and Vancouver metros. PM2.5 showed seasonality
in all three metros: higher winter levels for Montreal (winter,
46.9 μg/m3; summer, 26.3 μg/m3) and Vancouver (winter, 24.4
μg/m3; summer, 11.3 μg/m3); higher summer levels in
Toronto (winter, 82.3 μg/m3; summer, 119.6 μg/m3). UFP
levels were significantly higher in winter in all three metros with
the most pronounced difference in Vancouver (winter, 18.3 ×
103 pts/cm3; summer, 3.8 × 103 pts/cm3). The seasonality of
BC reflected PM2.5 seasonal trends.
In Toronto, waiting (platforms) PM2.5 exposures were
significantly higher than riding (trains) exposures (waiting:
140.0 μg/m3, riding: 80.8 μg/m3). Waiting and riding PM2.5
were similar in Montreal and Vancouver (nearly equal medians
and interquartile ranges). Platform UFP exposures tended to be
higher than train levels in Toronto (waiting, 11.0 × 103 pts/
cm3; riding, 6.7 × 103 pts/cm3) and Vancouver (waiting: 8.3 ×
103 pts/cm3; train: 6.0 × 103 pts/cm3); Montreal UFP levels

 were similar on platform and train. BC platform/train patterns
reflected those of PM2.5 and were higher on the platform only
in Toronto.
Toronto and Vancouver metro systems run above or below
grade for various portions of their routes; approximately 20% of
the Toronto system and 80% of the Vancouver system is above-
grade. Median below-grade PM2.5 exposures were more than
twice above-grade levels (Toronto: 106.4 μg/m3 below-grade,
46.7 μg/m3, above-grade; Vancouver: 39.7 μg/m3 below-grade,
15.1 μg/m3 above-grade). Differences were less dramatic for
UFPs, but median UFP exposures in Toronto were higher
above-grade (12.0 × 103 pts/cm3) than below-grade (8.8 × 103
pts/cm3). Conversely, median UFP levels in Vancouver were
higher below-grade (11.0 × 103 pts/cm3) than above-grade (6.8
× 103 pts/cm3). BC patterns were higher below-grade in both
Toronto and Vancouver.
System Features and Commuter Exposures. Multi-
variate models evaluating system design features as determi-
nants of commuter exposures are presented for below-grade
and above-grade metro routes in Tables 4 and 5. In the below-
grade analysis (Table 4), exposures were higher waiting on
platforms versus riding for PM2.5 and UFP for Toronto and
Vancouver. Platform versus train was not a determinant of
exposures in Montreal. System features found to relate to
increased PM2.5 exposures included: distance to outside air
(Toronto = 6.3%/km, Vancouver = 8.6%/km), depth
(Vancouver = 32.7%/10 m), and elevation (Toronto =
−3.4%/10 m, Vancouver = −8.0%/10 m). System features
related to increased UFP exposures included depth (Montreal
=12.3%/10 m) and elevation (Toronto = 2.5%/10m). Section
age was also related to PM2.5 exposure (Toronto = 8.5%/
decade, Montreal = −2.8%/decade) and UFP (approximately
10%/decade in all three cities).
Table 5 presents the multivariate analysis for the above grade
portions of the Toronto and Vancouver metro. The inverse
relationship between elevation and all three pollutants was still
present in the Toronto system but only for PM2.5 in Vancouver.
Platform levels were higher than riding levels for both PM2.5
and UFPs in the above-grade portion of the Vancouver system.
PM-Elemental Composition Analysis. Fourteen elemen-
tal components of PM2.5 were compared between metro and
ambient environments. Metro PM2.5 was found to be highly
enriched in several elements including Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, and Ba
(Table S4). The most abundant of the sampled elements in
Toronto and Vancouver was Fe. In these cities, Fe was at least 2
orders of magnitude more abundant in the metro (Toronto,
54%; Vancouver, 17%) than outdoors (Toronto, 0.02%;
Vancouver, 0.12%). Mn was also notably more abundant in
the metro (2 orders of magnitude higher in Toronto, one order
higher in Vancouver). In comparison, Fe was only 1 order of
magnitude more abundant in the Montreal metro (4.3%) than
ambient (0.11%), and Mn metro abundance was comparable to
outdoors. Other metallic elements with increased abundance
ratios (greater than 1 order of magnitude) were Cr, Cu, and Ni,
noted in all three systems.
Contribution of Metro Commuting to Estimated Daily
PM2.5-Associated Element Exposures. Assuming a 70 min
metro commute and 1370 min of ambient exposure, a metro
commute was estimated to contribute the majority of daily
exposure for several elements (Table 6). Of particular note was
exposure to barium (96%) and manganese (93%) in Toronto,
copper in Montreal (97%), molybdenum in Vancouver (91%),
and iron in all three cities (99%, 80%, and 95%, respectively).
The estimated 4.9% of time spent in the metro contributed
21.2%, 11.3%, and 11.5% of daily PM2.5 exposure in Toronto,
Montreal, and Vancouver, respectively (Table 7).
■ DISCUSSION
This exposure assessment and analysis of Canadian metro
exposures has revealed substantial differences in exposure
between systems related to differences in wheel and brake
design. As well, differences in exposure were revealed within
systems between platform and train environments and below
and above grade sections of a system. Further, these metro

 environments are characterized as having concentrations of
fine-fraction, steel-related elemental exposures which surpass
ambient levels by one or more orders of magnitude. In all cities,
a typical 70 min commute, which constitutes 4.9% of the day,
was estimated to contribute over 50% of the estimated daily
exposure to several PM2.5 metals (Fe, Mn, Mo, Cu, and Ni) and
21% of daily PM2.5 exposure in Toronto, 11% in Montreal, and
12% in Vancouver. Considering the combined daily ridership of
these three metro systems (Table 1), a significant portion of
Canada’s population is being exposed to these particulates on a
daily basis.
Overall, PM2.5 levels were found to be highest in the Toronto
metro, a system that is largely below-grade and using a
traditional steel wheel-steel rail rolling stock design. Steel
wheel-steel rail metro design has been noted to generate PM
“rail dust”.5,19−23 This environment is also subject to the regular
resuspension of particles due to the piston effect of train
movement. The piston effect has been suggested by the
examination of temporal variability in metro PM levels which
coincide with a sharp rise in wind speed/turbulence and the
motion of a train.21,24 Montreal is also a below-grade system,
but the much lower sampled PM2.5 levels may be due to the use
of rubber wheels and concrete rollways compared to a
conventional steel wheel-steel rail design. Vancouver shares
Toronto’s steel wheel−steel rail design, but the low PM2.5 levels
sampled are consistent with its predominantly above-grade and
elevated system, open to ambient environment, and thus
permitting greater dispersion of system-generated PM. The
higher levels of PM associated with these metro features (steel
wheel−steel rail interface, below-grade versus above-grade)
have also been reported in other studies.25,26
While BC levels are frequently attributed to fresh
combustion emissions, by exploring their relationship with
UFPs (primarily sourced by fresh diesel emissions), we found
evidence suggesting that BC levels monitored in below-grade
metro environments are unlikely due primarily to vehicle
exhaust emissions. Spearman’s rank correlations between UFP
and BC were very low in the below-grade sections of all three
metros (Toronto, 0.2; Montreal, 0.09; Vancouver, 0.11; Table
S5), and BC correlated strongly with UFP only in the above-
grade portion of the Vancouver metro (0.59, Table S6). In
addition, below-grade BC levels were more correlated with
PM2.5 than with UFP. While high BC levels in metro systems
have been hypothesized to be partly due to diesel-burning
maintenance units,27 these would have operated during
nighttime hours outside the sampling period. The graphite
connections between the third rail and the train could also be a
source of BC in these systems.23 Taken together, our findings
suggest that sampled BC levels could be representing a
component of metro system-related PM rather than infiltrated
vehicle traffic or in-metro diesel combustion emissions.
UFPs were higher in winter in all metros, resembling the
seasonality in other studies sampling UFPs,28,29. As well, a 5-
year study of particle count exposures in Toronto found winter
UFP levels to be significantly higher than summer levels for
particles ranging from 8 to 50 nm in size.30
In the below-grade sections of the Toronto and Vancouver
metro systems, platform levels were substantially higher than
those in trains (∼60% higher on platforms in both systems).
This could be on account of train ventilation systems providing
particle deposition and filtration. Some metro studies have
shown PM2.5 platform levels to be notably higher than train
levels.9,31 In the case of Toronto and Vancouver, time spent
waiting on the station platform may contribute a substantial
proportion of total commuter exposure. Conversely, platform
exposures were similar to train exposures in the Montreal
metro, as seen in some other international metros.25,26,32 UFP
levels also showed significant differences in above- and below-
grade sections, but concentrations were generally low (Table
S3). For example, on-road UFP concentrations measured in the
private vehicle commuting component of this study were 2−4
times higher than in subways.12
The PM2.5 and BC exposures in the below-grade sections of
the Toronto and Vancouver metros were notably higher than in
the above-grade sections (see Table S3). As well, in the below-
grade sections of these two systems, these two pollutants were
found to increase with distance to an above-ground segment of
the system (positive association with “distance to outside”).
Combined, these two factors provide an indication of the
capacity by which access to open air dilutes PM2.5 and BC
levels. The sections of the below-grade portions of these two
systems located on low-lying land (low elevation) were also
found to have higher levels of PM2.5 (inverse association with
“elevation”). The mechanism behind this association may be
related to the finding that a high proportion of metro PM is
sourced from the system itself through frictional forces. These
frictional forces such as braking and grinding between wheels
and rails may be higher at lower parts of the system where
grade changes are sharper and braking forces need to be
increased.
PM2.5 Composition and Estimated Metro Contribu-
tions to Daily Exposures. Iron was the most abundant of the
sampled elements in Toronto and Vancouver and the second
most abundant in Montreal (second to copper) (Table S4).
High enrichments of iron have also been seen in other metro
sampling studies.3−5,10,23,24,33 Metro PM was much more
enriched in iron and manganese than ambient PM, indicating
the presence of an Fe-rich and Mn-rich source within the metro
environments. In the cases of Toronto and Vancouver, this is
likely the result of the conventional steel wheel−steel rail
interface known to generate steel “rail dust” through friction.19
This is not the case in Montreal where rubber wheels and
concrete rollways are used. However, the iron and manganese
enrichments still suggest a significant steel source in the metro.
This may be explained by the existence of redundant steel
wheels installed on the bogies in behind the rubber wheels.
Their purpose is to provide a surface for the wooden brake pads
as well as flanges that run along a steel rail guidance track.
The ratio of Mn/Fe further suggests the source to be steel
abrasion. In all three metros, the Mn/Fe ratio was
approximately 0.01 (see Figure S9−11), consistent with
composition of rail steel.5,10,19 Other metallic elements found

 to be enriched in metro PM were Cr, Cu, Mo and Ni, which are
all associated with train-related friction processes (e.g., abrasion
of steel rail, brake pads, electrification rail).5,19−23 Ba, which is a
useful marker of wear from friction brake pads,23,24 is used to
supplement the regenerative braking systems and was found in
highest levels in Toronto and Vancouver. Conversely, Ba levels
were much lower in Montreal, suggesting a system design
difference and which is likely associated with Montreal’s use of
wooden brake pads instead of conventional metallic brake pads.
Exposures measured in this study may overestimate typical
metro exposures experienced outside of rush hour as sampling
was conducted exclusively during peak hours. Indeed, train
activity has been linked to exposure levels34 and it is therefore
likely that levels are lower during off-peak hours. As well, it is
important to note that PM2.5-based elemental exposures
represented each metro as a whole; exposures for above and
below grade sections of the Toronto and Vancouver metros are
likely different for fine fraction metals, as observed with the
continuously sampled PM2.5 data. As well, sampling represented
more time on platforms in comparison to that of an actual
commute where most time is spent riding. This may have
resulted in higher measured elemental concentrations of PM2.5
elemental levels than may be experienced by a typical
commuter for metros where platform PM2.5 levels are higher
than train levels; however, a sensitivity analysis assuming a
more typical commute of 14% platform exposure time and 86%
train exposure time was found to result in a less than two
percent difference in estimated metro contributions to
elemental PM2.5 daily exposures. Finally, in our micro-
environmental models, we assumed that all PM2.5 mass and
elemental concentration exposures outside the metro commute
were represented by central site ambient monitoring data. This
assumption has been made by the large body of research
investigating the health effects of PM2.5 which use central site
data to represent personal exposures. Indeed, the results of this
paper represent an estimate of the exposure misclassification
which can result from this assumption. As well, several studies
have suggested metro commuting to be a dominant source of
PM2.5 elemental exposures. Research investigating changes in
personal elemental exposures related to the introduction of the
fuel additive MMT (methylcyclopentadienyl manganese
tricarbonyl) has found time spent in the metro to contribute
substantially to personal exposures of fine fraction metals
related to steel. A study assessing personal exposures of a
representative sample of Torontonians found time spent in the
subway to be the most important predictor of PM2.5 Mn. This
was supported by subsequent sampling of six metro platforms
which found mean concentrations of PM2.5 (158 μg/m3) PM2.5
Mn (0.428 μg/m3).35,36 These levels are remarkably similar to
the levels of this study. A comparison of the personal exposures
of taxi cab drivers and office workers in London revealed the
highest levels of PM2.5 Mn to be among the subjects within the
office worker group who commuted via the metro.35,36 The
contribution of subway commuting to personal PM2.5 levels is
likely shared for other metal related elemental exposures. In
New York City, an exposure study of metro-commuting
teenagers revealed personal exposures to be higher than
exposures outdoors and indoors at home for Cr, Mn, and Fe.10
In general, findings suggest that particulate air pollution
exposures may be significantly increased in metro environments
relative to outdoors, particularly for some metallic elements.
Moreover, our results suggest that metro system features can
significantly influence PM2.5. These findings may be used to
guide decision-making processes by transportation planners in
Canada and elsewhere to help reduce PM exposures for the
commuting public. For existing subway infrastructure experi-
encing high particulate matter concentrations, interventions to
improve metro air quality should be considered, for example
improved ventilation, in car filtration or conducting rail dust
cleaning. Future proposed exposure sampling work will explore
source types contributing to the unique element-rich PM2.5
composition found in the metro microenvironment as well as
the evaluation of interventions designed to improve metro air
quality.
