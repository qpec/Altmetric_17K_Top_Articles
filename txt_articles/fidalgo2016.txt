Background and Objectives: Studies have highlighted psychosocial
factors associated with drug use among adolescents. Association of
specific psychiatric comorbidity with substance use has not been
properly established in Brazil. This study aimed to investigate alcohol,
tobacco, and marijuana use by 15–18-year-old high school Brazilian
students and to estimate associations with psychiatric symptoms.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 4,034 students from 128 public
and private schools in S~
ao Paulo State was carried out using a two-
step probability sample. Data were collected through self-report
standardized questionnaires including questions on substance use
patterns and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Key
outcome variables were past-month use and past-month frequent use
of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana. Questionnaires with missing
information were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 2,532
adolescents. Weighted data was analyzed through logistic regres-
sions, adjusted by gender and by socio-economic status (SES).
Results: Regarding SDQ total score, 43.6% of students had no
psychiatric symptoms, 7.9% had subclinical symptoms and 48.5%
presented clinically significant symptoms. Respondents with a
clinically significant SDQ score were more likely to be past month
alcohol (aOR ¼ 1.51; 95%CI 1.22–1.88), tobacco (aOR ¼ 1.82; 95%
CI 1.25–2.66), and marijuana (aOR ¼ 1.79; 95%CI 1.21–2.64) users
as compared to those with no symptomatology.
Discussion and Conclusions: Psychopathological symptoms were
associated with alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use by 15–18-year-
old adolescents. These associations should also be considered when
planning public policies of mental health promotion.
Scientific Significance: This study discusses the importance of the
association between psychopathological symptoms and substance
use in a middle-income country, with high level of social inequalities,
in a state representative sample. (Am J Addict 2016;25:416–425)
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of substance use tends to have a wide
variation worldwide among high school students.1–7 Sub-
stance use among adolescents has been associated with mental
health disorders or mental health symptoms.6,7 According to
community studies of adolescent substance use and substance
use disorders and psychiatric comorbidity, 60% of youths with
substance
use, abuse or dependence
had a comorbid
diagnosis.8 For example, conduct disorder (CD) and opposi-
tional defiant disorder were most commonly associated with
substance use, abuse or dependence, followed by depression.8
Other studies have corroborated the association between early
onset of CD, and/or depressive symptoms with alcohol and
illegal drug use during adolescence,9 especially among boys,
who also seem to be more vulnerable to peer pressure and to be
less able to self-monitor their emotions than girls.8,9
Studies
to
determine
which
specific
mental
health
symptoms are associated with substance use among adoles-
cents in different settings are crucial, so that proper public
health policies can be enacted. This is particularly important in
developing countries such as Brazil; where a wide gap of
social inequalities is observed. Although it is the eighth
wealthiest country in the world, it has important social
discrepancies. S~
ao Paulo state accounts for 22% of Brazilian
population (around 44 million inhabitants). Despite being the
richest state in Brazil, social inequality is similar to that
observed in a national level (with a Gini Indexa of .474 in
201310), the 14th most unequal state out of Brazilian 26 states
and the Federal District. Our study focuses on high school
students in S~
ao Paulo state, since previous studies have already
established that socioeconomic status (SES) and neighbor-
hood conditions have a major impact on mental health and
substance use outcomes of adolescents.7

 In Brazil, the prevalence of current alcohol use (past-
month) ranges from 23.0% to 67.7%, among adolescents of
10–19 years old. The prevalence of current tobacco use (past
month) ranges from 2.4% to 22.0%.11 Pinsky et al. found that
frequent drinking (at least once a week) occurs in 9.1% of the
Brazilian adolescent (14–17 years old) population. Binge
drinking occurred in 52.9% of the boys and in 37.6% of the
girls.12 Data from the I Brazilian National Alcohol Survey13
revealed a prevalence of cannabis use among Brazilian
adolescents (12–17 years old) of 2.1%. In a Brazilian national
survey, Madruga et al. found that 2.8% of adolescents (14–19
years old) had used at least one illicit drug in the year before
the survey.14 The most used illicit substances were marijuana
(1.6%), solvents (1.1%), and crack/cocaine (.5%). However,
the association of psychiatric comorbidity among adolescents
with past month and frequent alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana
use has not been properly established in Brazil since most
studies have only focused on examining prevalence estimates
but not testing for associations.
METHODS
The main purpose of this study was to estimate associations
of past-month frequent alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use
with concurrent mental health symptoms.
Sample
Data came from a representative sample of students at both
public and private schools in S~
ao Paulo State, Brazil, with a
classroom survey data collected from September 2013 to
December 2013. The study’s target population was designed
as a representative sample of middle and high school students
(from 6th to 12th grade). A two-step probability sample
selection was used. In the first stage, schools were randomly
drawn by strata in each one of the 15 administrative areas of
the state. In the second stage, the sample was cluster
randomized (classrooms). All students in sampled classrooms
were invited to participate.
The sample size was set for a maximum 10% relative error
and a 95% confidence interval (CI). S~
ao Paulo State has 9,028
schools, 176 schools were contacted, 115 public schools, and
61 private schools. These numbers guaranteed that we kept the
same ratio of public and private schools in the state in our study
(1.88:1). Of this total, 128 agreed to participate in the survey
(73% school acceptance rate). Eleven public schools and 37
private schools refused to participate. This discrepancy was
considered in the complex survey design.
Among the 9,411 students invited, 99.1% agreed to
participate and the process generated a final sample of
9,326 students. In this paper, we focused on high-school
students (10th to 12th grade) aged between 15 and 18 years
old, comprising 4,034 students. Thirty-four subjects of the age
range sample included in this study were excluded, as they
positively answered the question about having ever used a
fictitious drug. Sensitivity analyses were performed, investi-
gating whether missing data on gender, SES and Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) total and subscales scores
would affect the final regression models. As there was no
influence on results, we opted for excluding all questionnaires
with missing values in any of these variables included in the
model, resulting in a final sample of 2,532 adolescents.
Data Collection and Instruments
Anonymous standardized paper-and-pencil self-reported
questionnaire data were gathered by a trained team of field
researchers. They explained research objectives, anonymity,
confidentiality and volunteering to the students and then
distributed questionnaires. Data collection was conducted
without a teacher or school member present in the classroom.
In average, it took 45 minutes to complete the questionnaire. It
was used a self-reported questionnaire with closed answers
based on a World Health Organization instrument adapted to
the Brazilian culture15,16 and the SDQ.17
Measures
The instruments included questions about alcohol, tobacco,
and marijuana use, considering past month use (30 days prior
to the research). Past month use was categorized in 1–5 days
(low use), 6–19 days (frequent use), and 20 days or more
(frequent use), as firstly defined by Smart et al.15 The
instrument included questions about SES using a standardized
survey assessment, known as the ABEP index.18 This index is
based upon the possession of various types of household
goods, the educational level of the head of the household, and
number of housekeepers. Participants can be sorted to eight
subgroups, according to their score, from A to E (where A1 is
the highest economic strata).
In order to assess adolescent probable psychopathology in
the past 6 months, the SDQ was used.17 This is a 25-item
screening measure of emotional and behavioral difficulties. It
was designed for 3–17-year-old children/adolescents. The
SDQ
comprises
five
subscales:
Emotional
Symptoms,
Conduct Problems, Inattention–Hyperactivity Symptoms,
Peer Problems, and Prosocial Behavior. Its total score is
achieved through the sum of all subscales scores, but Prosocial
Behavior Subscale.
SDQ scores classify individuals as symptom-free (no
psychopathology symptoms), subclinical (subclinical psycho-
pathology symptoms) and clinical (clinically relevant psycho-
pathology symptoms). The cut-off of each sub-scale used was:
Emotional Symptoms (0–2, normal; 3, subclinical; 4–10,
clinical), Conduct Problems (0–1, normal; 2, subclinical; 3–10,
clinical); Inattention–Hyperactivity Symptoms (0–4, normal;
5–6, subclinical, 7–10, clinical); Peer Problems (0–1, normal;
2–10, clinical) and Prosocial Behavior (8–10, normal; 5–7,
subclinical; 0–4, clinical), according to Kovacs and Sharp19
aGini index measures the extent to which the distribution of
income among individuals or households within an economy deviates
from a perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents
perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.

 recommendation. The Total Difficulties Score cut-off was as
follows: 0–11, normal; 12, subclinical; and 13–40, clinical.
Although the translated version of the SDQ has not yet been
validated to the Brazilian context, it has been used in several
studies with good results.20–23 A recent study24 has evaluated
different cutoffs for the Brazilian version of the SDQ (different
from the ones used in the analyses for this manuscript). The
authors state that using higher cutoffs increases the specificity
of the instrument, with little loss of its sensitivity. These higher
cutoffs are better suitable for contexts of care that require more
precise and faster procedures for diagnosis in which a clinician
evaluation is not available. For screening purposes, as done in
our study, the authors state that the usual cutoffs are reliable.24
Key Outcome Variables
The key response variables in this study were past-month
use and past-month frequent use of alcohol, tobacco and
marijuana.
Covariates Under Study
The predictors of central interest were the SDQ total score
and the SDQ subscales score as described above. Two main
logistic regression models were tested for each outcome
variable: one model including the SDQ total score and a
second model using SDQ subscales score separately. Gender
and SES were included as control variables in all models.
Due to the inequality of distribution of Brazilian income,
we defined four ranks of SES based upon the ABEP scale: A
(A1 and A2), B (B1 and B2), C (C1 and C2), D/E (D and E).
Due to small sample size, classes D and E were combined as a
single category (see footnoteb).
Data Analysis
First, we conducted exploratory analyses through basic
contingency tables with Chi-square tests, followed by logistic
regression for complex samples. We described the students’
general sociodemographic variables, drug use and psychiatric
symptomatology characteristics by weighted proportions. To
estimate the association between the SDQ total and subscales
scores and past-month use and frequent use of alcohol, tobacco
and marijuana, we ran separate weighted logistic regression
models in the overall sample for each substance use outcome
of interest, adjusting for gender and SES.
Data were weighted to correct for unequal probabilities of
selection into the sample. The complex survey design took into
account the stratum (administrative region of the State in
which schools were located), primary sampling unit (schools),
clusters (classroom), the expansion weight, and the probability
of drawing the student who answered the questionnaire.
Analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 and Stata 13.0,
with the complex sample procedures to address variance
estimation under the complex sample design in these
regression models and in estimation of all 95% CI. Results
are presented via weighted proportions (wgt%), adjusted Odds
Ratios (aORs) and 95% CI.
Ethical Aspects
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Uni-
versidade Federal de S~
ao Paulo Research Ethics Committee
(Protocol 192.052). The questionnaire did not include any
information that could be used to identify the students.
Participants
could
participate
anonymously,
decline
to
participate, leave questions unanswered, and interrupt their
participation at any time.
RESULTS
Descriptive
Among the 2,532 students included in this study, most of
them were girls; and from public schools. Past-month alcohol
use rate was of 38.2%. Frequent alcohol use rate was of 2.3%.
Tobacco use rates were of 8.8% and of 2.0% for past-month
and frequent use, respectively. As for marijuana, use rates
were of 7.2% and of 1.5%. Regarding the SDQ total score,
43.6% of the students had no psychiatric symptoms; 7.9% had
subclinical symptoms and 48.5% presented clinically signifi-
cant symptoms. Detailed information is on Table 1.
Table 2 describes past month and frequent alcohol, tobacco,
and marijuana use according to SDQ total and subscales scores
in the study’s sample. Positive SDQ Total Score and positive
SDQ Conduct, Hyperactivity, Prosocial, and Peer subscales
scores were statistically significantly associated with past
month alcohol use. Positive SDQ Total Score and SDQ
Conduct, Hyperactivity and Prosocial subscales scores were
statistically significantly associated with past month tobacco
use. Positive Conduct and Prosocial subscale score was
statistically significantly associated with frequent tobacco use.
Positive Conduct, Hyperactivity and Prosocial subscales
scores were significantly associated with past month mari-
juana use. Positive Conduct, Hyperactivity, Prosocial and Peer
subscales scores were significantly associated with frequent
marijuana use.
Total SDQ Score
Respondents with a clinically significant SDQ score were
more likely to be past month alcohol users, past month tobacco
users and past month marijuana users as compared to those
with no symptomatology. Detailed information is on Table 3.
SDQ Subscores
Reporting a clinical-level score in the SDQ Emotional
subscale was significantly associated with infrequent tobacco
use and with no past-month marijuana use. Having a subclinical
score in the SDQ Conduct subscale was significantly associated
bABEP provides eight different social economic strata (A1, A2,
B1, B2, C, D, and E, where A1 is the highest). When data was
collected annual family income ranges were as follows (average
income): A1: U$ 5875,00 or higher; A2: U$ 3826,00; B1: U$
2008,00; B2: 1165,00; C1: U$ 700,00; C2: U$ 465,00; D: U$ 324,00;

a clinical score in the SDQ Conduct subscale was significantly
associated with past-month alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use
and with frequent tobacco use. Having a subclinical score in the
SDQ Hyperactivity subscale was associated with past-month
marijuana use.Havinga clinicalscoreintheSDQHyperactivity
subscale was associated with past-month alcohol, tobacco, and
marijuana use and with heavy marijuana use. Having a clinical
score in the SDQ Prosocial subscale were associated with past-
month and frequent tobacco use. Lastly, having a clinical score
in the SDQ Peer subscale were associated with frequent
marijuana use. Detailed information is on Table 4.
DISCUSSION
Two substantive findings emerge from our analyses: 1)
respondents with a clinically significant SDQ scores were
more likely to be past month alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana
users as compared to those without symptomatology; 2)
different SDQ subscales scores were associated with different
patterns of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. These results
emphasize the importance of psychopathological symptoms
associated with substance use.
Alcohol Use
The relationship between alcohol use and psychopathology
is widely known. In an Icelandic study with more than 10,000
adolescents aged 14–16 years old, 5.4% of the sample met
screening criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD). After controlling for gender and school grade,
ADHD symptoms (but not ADHD diagnosis) were associated
with alcohol use independent of other psychiatric symptoms.25
In an American cohort, 178 adolescents (113 with ADHD)
were followed-up for 2 years, and the ones with ADHD, when
compared with controls, were more likely to initiate alcohol
use at early ages.26 This is a major concern, as the earlier the
age of onset of alcohol use, the higher the risk of alcohol
misuse in adolescence and adulthood, especially binge
drinking patterns. In addition, it is already well established
that the earlier the onset of alcohol use, the higher the risk of
other drug use.16
The relationship between CD symptomatology and alcohol
use has clinical significance as adolescent-onset alcohol abuse
exacerbates the influence of childhood CD on late adolescent
and early adult antisocial behavior. Those with co-occurring
CD with early-onset alcohol abuse, compared with those
showing only CD, showed more violence in their criminal
history and greater recreational drug use.27 The severity of
lifetime alcohol-related and childhood-CD problems have also
shown to be predictor variables of antisocial behavior.28 This
association may also have impact on the formulation of
preventive strategies, as treating CD, especially in its early
stages, might be effective for alcohol use prevention.29
Data from 2000 to 2004, of a US-national representative
sample of 2,517 individuals aged 12–15 years old reported that
individuals with ADHD and CD, diagnosed based on
caregiver responses to the Diagnostic Interview Schedule
for Children, had an increased likelihood of alcohol use.30 In
our sample, positive scores on the Conduct and Hyperactivity

Psychiatric Symptoms, Alcohol, Tobacco, and Marijuana Use
August 2016
 SDQ subscales were also significantly associated with an
increased likelihood of past-month alcohol use. Brinkman
et al. reported that ADHD alone and CD alone did not increase
the risk of alcohol or tobacco use.30 In our sample, however,
these two clusters of symptoms were, by themselves,
independently associated with alcohol and tobacco use. A
mediating role of CD in the association between ADHD and
alcohol use disorder has already been explored by others, thus,
suggesting a developmental pathway from ADHD to CD and
subsequent alcohol use disorders.31 In this line, early
interventions in children with ADHD may prevent CD and
subsequent onset of alcohol use.32
Tobacco Use
Concerning tobacco use and associated psychopathology,
ADHD symptoms have been linked to greater rates of both
lifetime
and
current
smoking
and
early
initiation
of
smoking.33–35 On the cohort of 178 individuals above
mentioned,32 individuals with more ADHD symptoms were
more likely to try cigarettes and 4–5 times more likely than
controls to escalate to frequent cigarette use after trying
tobacco. The Icelandic study25 also found an association
between ADHD symptoms and tobacco use, independently of
other psychiatric symptoms. Inattention and impulsivity seem
to be the most important domains of ADHD on the
establishment of this comorbid relationship.36 CD, once again,
seems to be a mediate factor on the development of tobacco use
during adolescence among those with ADHD symptoms.37
Data from a US-national representative sample of 2,517
individuals aged 12–15 years old showed that individuals with
ADHD and CD had an increased likelihood of tobacco use.30
Finally, a positive score on SDQ Emotional subscale was
associated with infrequent tobacco use. The role of emotional
symptoms on tobacco use has already been explored. Low
emotional self-efficacy has already been associated to tobacco
use, in a sample of more than two thousand high school
students.38 The association between psychosocial problems
and smoking is clearer for the onset of regularly smoking and
less clear for the onset of tobacco use.39 Another study found
that adolescents with lifetime alcohol/drug use with comorbid
tobacco use had higher generalized anxiety symptoms and
distress, and those with lifetime alcohol/drug use without
comorbid tobacco use had higher panic disorder symptoms
and
anhedonia.
Therefore,
tobacco
role
on
emotional
symptoms remains a target for further investigation.40
Marijuana Use
The association between early marijuana use and subsequent
problems, such as severe substance use disorders, cognitive
impairment and poor social relationships has been widely
studied.41–44 Ina prospective, longitudinalstudyconducted with
1,088 adolescents, it was reported that conduct problems in
childhood and early adolescence made a small but significant
contribution to the risk for marijuana use 8 years later.45 In

Psychiatric Symptoms, Alcohol, Tobacco, and Marijuana Use
August 2016
 survey reported adolescents’ depressive symptoms potentiate
the relation of conduct problems to marijuana use.46 This is
consistent with ourfinding that clinical and subclinical scores on
SDQ Conduct subscale are associated to marijuana use. This has
direct impact on policy formulations, as substance use
prevention efforts should target both depressive symptoms
and conduct problems.46 However, our findings concerning the
SDQ Emotional subscale score is in the other direction, as we
have found this to be a protective factor for past-month
marijuana use. Previous study has found that marijuana use and
temperament interact complexly in predicting risk for anxiety
and depression. Authors discuss that this complex interaction
may explain controversial findings concerning marijuana and
emotional symptoms.47 As for the association of marijuana use
and hyperactivity symptoms, it is known hyperactivity-
impulsivity symptoms are associated with higher rates of early
adult binge drinking and marijuana use. Therefore, this pattern
may reflect a developmental course of vulnerability to elevated
substance use in early adulthood.48 This also has impact on
prevention policies, as among adolescents with ADHD,
treatment with stimulant therapy has been shown to decrease
risk for later marijuana abuse.49,50
Subclinical Findings
It is interesting that even subclinical positive scores on the
SDQ were associated with some past-month and frequent
substance use. This specific population of individuals with
subclinical scores may be a potential target for clinical
interventions, even though their clinical score is not positive
yet. We speculate that their current substance use might be
masking their actual mental health status.51 Moreover, both
subclinical and clinical positive scores were associated to past-
month use, but not to frequent use. This specific population
may be a potential target for clinical interventions, even
though their substance use is not frequent. In this case, we
speculate that improving their mental health status can avoid
them from frequent substance use. We conclude, then, that
mental health policies should focus on these populations, as
promoting mental health and providing early treatment for
psychiatric symptoms may have a direct impact on mental
health prevalence and its costs among adults.
The Brazilian Context and International Implications
These findings regarding the association of past-month and
frequent alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use with psychopatho-
logicalsymptomsamongadolescentsgainmorerelevancewhen
in perspective of the Brazilian health and social context. In a
country with high levels of social inequalities, access to public
health system may be limited. Mental health services, especially
child and adolescence psychiatric facilities, are scarce and
unequally distributed across the country.52 In addition to that,
according to a recent survey, only a small proportion of children
and adolescents with psychiatric disorders had been seen by a
mental health specialist in the previous 12 months.52
Asimilarsituationmaybefoundinotherlow-middle-income
countries.53,54 Highlevels of unplanned chaotic urbanization are
a phenomena observed not only in S~
ao Paulo city and state, but
also in other important cities and metropolitan regions in Latin
America and in Asia.55 These regions usually concentrate high
levels of social inequalities, which is a recognized risk factor for
mental health symptoms. Better understanding the relationship
between these inequalities and mental health and substance use
rates of adolescents in low-middle-income countries is
mandatory to better address mental needs of this population.
Despite that, research focusing on these comorbidities are still
scarce in these countries.
Limitations
Limitations are noted. Due to the fact that a self-report
questionnaire was used, the questions were subject to
interpretation by the participants and to a possible informa-
tion bias. However, the anonymous nature of the survey and
the absence of the teacher in the classroom could have
helped to promote response validity. In addition, we
included a question about a fictitious drug that allowed us
to drop the questionnaires with proved bias information.
Thirty-four subjects of the studied age range sample were
excluded, as they positively answered the question about
having ever used a fictitious drug. Some degree of non-
participation (especially because of absence on the day of the
survey) excluded some students from the analysis. However,
the levels of participation were larger than those in the US
Monitoring the Future study,56 considering that almost all
the students that were invited agreed to participated. Data
missingness may also have influenced the results, although
no difference was found in sensitive analysis. In addition, as
this is a retrospective survey, we must consider the problems
associated with recall bias. Nevertheless, the participants
were still adolescents so the first use of alcohol was fairly
recent. Lastly, it is important to note that as it is a cross
sectional survey, as such, association does not imply
causation.
Especially
concerning
the
SDQ
Emotional
subscale it is hard to understand why having a clinical
score is negatively associated with heavy tobacco use and of
marijuana use.
CONCLUSION
In summary, we set out to investigate whether there would
be an association of specific psychopathological symptoms
(evaluated by SDQ) and past-month and frequent alcohol,
tobacco and marijuana use in a S~
ao Paulo state representative
sample of 15–18-year-old adolescents. Positive scores on
different SDQ subscales were associated with different use
patterns of these substances. These associations should also be
considered when planning public policies for mental health
promotion, and prevention of mental health problems and of
heavy substance use in adolescents.
