 Payback time? Influence of having children
on mortality in old age
K Modig,1 M Talbäck,1 J Torssander,2 A Ahlbom1
ABSTRACT
Background It is known that parents have lower
mortality than childless individuals. Support from adult
children to ageing parents may be of importance for
parental health and longevity. The aim of this study was
to estimate the association between having a child and
the risk of death, and to examine whether the
association increased at older ages when health starts to
deteriorate and the need of support from a family
member increases.
Methods In this nationwide study, all men and women
(born between 1911 and 1925 and residing in Sweden),
as well as their children, were identified in population
registers and followed over time. Age-specific death risks
were calculated for each calendar year for individuals
having at least one child and for individuals without
children. Adjusted risk differences and risk ratios were
estimated.
Results Men and women having at least one child
experienced lower death risks than childless men and
women. At 60 years of age, the difference in life
expectancy was 2 years for men and 1.5 years for
women. The absolute differences in death risks increased
with parents’ age and were somewhat larger for men
than for women. The association persisted when the
potential confounding effect of having a partner was
taken into account. The gender of the child did not
matter for the association between parenthood and
mortality.
Conclusions Having children is associated with
increased longevity, particularly in an absolute sense in
old age. That the association increased with parents’
age and was somewhat stronger for the non-married
may suggest that social support is a possible
explanation.
INTRODUCTION
It is well established that parents live longer than
non-parents,1–4 but the underlying mechanisms are
unclear and it is not known how the association
changes over the life course. In Sweden and the
other Nordic countries,5 there is an overall trend of
increasing
levels
of
childlessness
across
birth
cohorts. It may therefore be valuable to improve
our understanding of how childlessness is linked to
health and survival chances in old age. In the latest
decades in Sweden, there has also been a shift from
older people living in institutions to living at home
with assistance, and the proportion of elderly
people in Sweden that receives care from their chil-
dren or other close persons has increased.6
7
Therefore, to further investigate health and survival
consequences for childless older individuals is of
importance. W
e hypothesise that support from
adult children to their ageing parents may be of
importance
for
parental
health
and
longevity.
However, there are of course several alternative
explanations. For example, the timing and number
of children could affect the mortality risk of
women through biological pathways, particularly in
organs that are sensitive to hormonal stimuli such
as breast, uterus and ovary.8 9 Still, a protective
effect of parenthood has been found for mothers
and fathers,3 4 10 which may suggest that the bio-
logical mechanisms that apply to women is not the
only explanation to the association, and other
factors matter as well. One such factor could be
various types of support from adult children to
their ageing parents,4 such as informational, emo-
tional and social support. In addition, parents have
on average more healthful behaviours than childless
individuals.11 It is also possible that the survival
advantage of parents over non-parents is due to
confounding from biological or social factors influ-
encing the chances of having children and the risk
of death. Health-related selection may be important
at any phase during the life course, but it seems
reasonable that the influence would not increase
when parents become very old, but rather being
more significant before average life expectancy (LE)
as frailer individuals tend to die off. The need for
social support from family members may, on the
other hand, increase when parents age because ill
health becomes more common with increasing age
and the ability of self-care may decrease.
How the mortality advantage of parents over
non-parents changes over the life span, is not
known. Previous studies have mainly examined
associations between parity and subsequent mortal-
ity from 40 years of age up to around 60 years of
age,1 3 8 9 and a few studies have investigated the
association in older ages.2 4 12 Only in two of these
studies, the association between having children
and parental mortality was presented over age, and
was shown to be strongest at the age of 60 and
thereafter decrease.2
12 However, the association
was measured as relative risks. If the aim is to
explore whether the presence of children is more
important in older ages than in younger ages, we
believe that absolute risk differences are more
informative. This is because death risk increases
with age and the effect of children on parental
mortality (among all other risk factors) is relatively
small, and thus, the risk ratios will consequently
decrease with age even if the absolute effect of chil-
dren on mortality increases.
At old age, the stress of parenthood is likely to
be lower and instead, parents can benefit from
social support from their children. Such support
has in earlier research indicated health advan-
tages.13–15 It has also been shown that childless

 older individuals receive less social support than parents do: In
a review, one of the major findings was that old childless people
who were in poor health and lived alone faced potential
support deficits.16
Related to the hypothesis of a greater need of social support
in old age and the help from children for such needs, is the role
of the gender of the child for parental mortality. Having a
daughter has been shown to be associated with increased
chances of regular social contact and with receiving help if
needed,16
17 something that we hypothesise becomes more
important later in life. The role of daughters versus sons for
parental mortality has been the topic of a few previous studies,
but the results are inconsistent. Some studies found no associ-
ation with the gender of the child,18 19 while other found that
daughters are more favourable,20 sometimes for fathers only.13
In a study on Swedish data, the protective effect of having a
daughter was detected only among one-child parents, but not
for parents with several children,14 which is in line with a
Norwegian study.15 However, none of these studies followed
individuals into ages above average LE.
This study closely examines the association between parent-
hood and longevity, with specific focus on the strength of the
association in old age, and with absolute and relative measures.
More specifically, we investigate; (1) the association between
having a child alive in old age and the risks of death among
Swedish men and women, (2) whether the association increases
with age of the parent and (3) whether the association persists
when stratifying for marital status (taking into account the pos-
sible confounding effect of having a partner cohabiting). W
e
further conduct sensitivity analyses in order to increase the
insight of the possible explanations to the survival advantage of
parents over non-parents: whether the association differed by
gender of the child, how the educational level affects the associ-
ation and if geographical distance between parent and child
interacts with the relationship between having children and mor-
tality in old age.
METHODS
Sweden, together with the other Nordic countries, has a system
of population-based registers where individual-level data can be
linked through personal identity numbers, that is, a unique iden-
tifier assigned to all persons registered in Sweden. First, we used
the Register of the Total Population (TPR) to identify all men
and women born between 1911 and 1925 and residing in
Sweden from the age of 60 or earlier (index persons). Second,
the children of these index persons were identified in the
Multigeneration Register, which includes children of parents
born 1932 and onwards.21 This means that, for the first birth
cohorts, any children born before the parents were 21 years of
age may be missed. However, as children born later are
included, and the majority of parents give birth after the age of
21, we consider this a minor problem not likely to considerably
affect our results. Third, to the index persons, we added infor-
mation on educational level from the Population and Housing
Censuses in 1970, which was available for 96.5% of the indivi-
duals. Further, annual information on marital status was col-
lected from the TPR. Finally, we added date of death from the
Cause of Death Register (1971–2014), which includes all deaths
occurring within and outside Sweden for individuals registered
in Sweden.
The index persons were followed from the calendar year of
their 60th birthday to death, emigration or end of follow-up
(31 December 2014), whichever came first. This means that
individuals were between 89 and 103 years of age at the end of
follow-up.
Marital status and children were treated as time-varying cov-
ariates. Information on if the individual had a child that was
alive and living in Sweden was based on whether the child was
registered in the TPR 1st of January each year, or not. Thus, the
definition of the presence of children was equal to having at
least one child residing in Sweden (based on the hypothesis of
social support). Marital status was defined as married or not
married the 31st of December each year. The category of not
married included never married, divorced or widowed indivi-
duals. These subcategories were collapsed based on the hypoth-
esis that all of them signify lack of support from a cohabiting
partner, and, in addition, because the small numbers made it
difficult to analyse them as three separate groups. Educational
level (basic, upper secondary or tertiary) was regarded as a fixed
constant as all individuals were between 45 and 59 years in
1970 when information on education was collected, and it
seems likely that the vast majority of the persons had reached
their final educational level in that age. Adjustments were
further made for geographical region and for urban versus rural
region.
T
o investigate whether the gender of the child had any impact
on the effect on parental mortality, subgroup analysis was per-
formed for parents with one girl or one boy only. This was
done in order not to confound any gender comparison with
parity.
T
o investigate how any association between having children
and mortality in old age varied with geographical distance
between parents and children, we used information on where
the children and parents lived on an annual basis during the
follow-up period. W
e compared the effect of having children
versus not having children on parental mortality for those
parents who lived closer than 50 km from their child (or any of
their children) versus parents who lived at least 50 km away
from the (closest residing) child.
One year age-specific and gender-specific death risks were cal-
culated by dividing the number of deaths during 1 year by the
number of individuals alive at the beginning of that year. Even
though absolute risk differences were our primary interest, we
also computed risk ratios to highlight the relation between these
measures and to simplify comparisons with previous studies.
Death risks, death risk differences and death risk ratios were all
estimated with a generalised linear model using a binomial dis-
tribution with the number of deaths as the dependent variable
and person-years under risk as the number of exposed for each
covariate pattern. A log-link was used to estimate the death risks
and risk ratios and an identity link to estimate the risk differ-
ences. All modelled estimates were smoothed with restricted
cubic splines. Four knots were used to model age and three
knots were used to model the age-dependent effect of having/
not having children and age. Educational level and marital
status were entered into the respective models as categorical
variables. Finally, the remaining life expectancies at age 60 and
age 80 were estimated for men and women with and without
children using smoothed death risks up to the age of 100. All
analyses were done independently for men and women.
The analyses were done using the statistical software STATA
V
.13.1 (College Station, T
exas, USA).
RESULTS
W
e identified 704 481 men and 725 290 women born between
1911 and 1925, living in Sweden at the age of 60. The total

 years for women. The vast majority of men and women had no
more than basic education, were married and had at least one
child, see table 1.
Figure 1 presents death risks by age for men and women with
at least one child versus no children. The death risks increased
with age in a similar trajectory for both groups and for men and
women, although men had higher absolute risks of death as
compared with women. For men and women, the death risks
were lower among individuals with a child as compared with
childless individuals, but more so for men than for women.
Figure 2 demonstrates death risk differences and risk ratios by
age for individuals with and without children, respectively,
adjusted for educational level (dots are unadjusted estimates and
smoothed lines adjusted). The differences in death risk increased
with age for men and women. The risk ratios, on the other
hand, decreased with age. The relative risks between having a
child and having no children decreased from around 1.4 among
60-year-olds to below 1.1 at the age of 95. Table 2 shows the
death risk differences adjusted for educational level and marital
status, and the estimates for 60-year-old men were 0.06% (95%
CI 0.02 to 0.10) and for women 0.16% (95% CI 0.13 to 0.19).
The corresponding figures for 90-year-olds were 1.47% (95%
CI 1.35 to 1.60) for men and 1.10% (95% CI 0.99 to 1.22) for
women. Additional adjustments were made for geographical
region and for urban/rural area, but none of these variables had
any effect on the associations.
The remaining LE at the age of 60 for men with children was
20.2 years, whereas men without children were expected to live
18.4 years, that is, a difference of close to 2 years. The corre-
sponding figures for women at age 60 were 24.6 and 23.1,
respectively, a difference of 1.5 years. At 80 years of age, the
remaining LE for men with children was 7.7 and men without
children 7.0. For women, the corresponding figures were 9.5
and 8.9 years.
The analyses showed that the association between having chil-
dren and mortality was found among married and unmarried but
was stronger among non-married, at least for men (see figure 3).
For example, for 85-year-old men, the death risk differences
between men with at least one child and childless men were
1.2% among unmarried men and 0.6% among married men.
The corresponding figures for women were 0.9% and 0.8%.
To find out whether the gender of the child had any impact
on parental mortality, analyses were run investigating whether
mothers and fathers with a daughter had a lower death risk than

 mothers and fathers with a son. The results showed no differ-
ences depending on the gender of the child (results not shown
but available on request).
Finally, to investigate how the geographical distance between
parents and their children was associated with the risk of dying,
we conducted separate analyses for parents and children living
more than 50 km apart and other parents (ie, <51 km), and
compared these death risks to childless individuals. The results
showed that the death risk differences between parents and non-
parents were greater if the parents lived far away from their chil-
dren, while smaller differences in death rates were found when
comparing parents living close to their children and non-
parents, see figure 4. This pattern was, however, clearer for
women than for men.
DISCUSSION
This study found an inverse association between having a child
and death risks in old age, and, importantly, that the death risk
differences between parents and non-parents increased with age
of the parent, among men and women. Further, the differences
in death risks between individuals with and without children
were somewhat larger for men than for women. The finding of
a stronger association for men than for women is in line with a
previous study where contact with children was associated with
better health among parents, and more so for men than for
women.22 Our finding that the association grew stronger when
parents became older is further in agreement with research sug-
gesting that childless people face support deficits only towards
the end of life.16 However, selective elements and alternative
explanations, for example, that parents have more healthy beha-
viours than non-parents,11 are not ruled out.
The association between having children and mortality per-
sisted when stratifying for marital status, taking into account the

ence of children is reflecting possible effects of cohabitation.
The association was also stronger among the non-married than
among the married, particularly among men, perhaps because
the married also gain advantages of having a partner in terms of
care and support, whereas the non-married and widowed would
be more exclusively dependent on their adult children. Notably,
the difference between the married and the non-married was
clearly more pronounced among men than among women,

 be more beneficial to men’s survival than to women’s survival.23
Another possible explanation to the greater mortality difference
among men may be that childless men are generally lower edu-
cated than men with children, whereas the opposite is true for
women. Even if we control for education, the composition of
childless male and female groups may differ across other socio-
economic dimensions that were not taken into consideration,
and early life influences as well as later behavioural factors con-
nected to such circumstances may affect our results.
T
wo of our findings may be interpreted as working against the
hypothesis about the importance of social support in older ages:
the lack of a stronger mortality association for parents whose
children lived fairly close, and the insignificant results for the
gender of the child. As for the first finding, the construction of
the geographical variable was rather crude. The intention was,
however, not to investigate in detail how distance affected the
association, but rather to perform sensitivity analyses that could
give some insights to the mechanisms. The fact that the associ-
ation was stronger for those living further away from their chil-
dren, however, seems contradictory to the hypothesis of social
support. Our results were not adjusted for the educational level
of the child (only the parent), but previous studies have shown
that highly educated children are more likely to live further away
from their parents24 and that parents may benefit, in terms of sur-
vival chances, of having a well-educated child,14 25 which may
alter the associations found in the present study. In addition, the
complete socioeconomic conditions of the individuals were not
included.
As for the findings that death risks of parents did not differ
depending on the gender of their child, there are known health
benefits from increased social participation and the ability to
draw on social support from children.22
26–28 In general,
women tend to have more social ties than men, and older
childless individuals, particularly men, appear to have less
social interactions than older parents and there is evidence that
having a daughter is associated with increased chances of
regular social contacts and with receiving help if needed.16 17
W
e found some support for the difference between mothers
and fathers, but no support for the hypothesis regarding a
beneficial effect of a daughter. There are several possible expla-
nations to this. First, gender of the child has mainly been con-
sidered in the context of social contact/support in previous
research while more specific types of support may matter most
for preventing mortality. In a country like Sweden, where
healthcare is almost free of charge and in theory equally avail-
able for everyone, perhaps the role of support in navigating the
healthcare sector, finding the right caregiver, arguing for better
and/or earlier treatment, etc is of particular importance and,
perhaps, daughters and sons are equally active in this type of
support. Furthermore, although previous studies have shown
that daughters have more regular contact with their parents
than
sons
have,
daughters-in-law
may
engage
in
their
parents-in-law, and reduce any initial differences in social
support between parents with a daughter and parents with a
son. It may also be that the selection of one-child parents for
this comparison is not representable for all families. Perhaps
being the only child is related to a greater responsibility of
parents, reducing the difference in the amount of help given by
sons and daughters. Thus, sons may take more responsibility
for their ageing parents when no other sibling is present.

 In addition, a previous Swedish study has found that the educa-
tional level of the parents matter for the amount of help they
receive from daughters and sons, respectively. Among older
well-educated individuals, there was no difference in the pro-
portion of help received by sons or daughters, yet, among the
less well educated it was more common to receive help from
daughters than from sons.6 Even if our results were adjusted
for education, they do not reveal the variation between educa-
tional groups. Finally, if the finding of no gender difference is
not explained by any of the suggestions above, health selection
rather than social support could explain the finding.
What is already known on this subject
It is well established that parents live longer than non-parents,
but the underlying mechanisms are less clear and it is further
not known how the association changes over the life course,
especially in old age.
What this study adds
▸ Parents live longer than non-parents, and this effect persists
to the highest ages.
▸ The death risk differences between parents and non-parents
increased with the age of the parent but was not associated
with the gender of the child.
▸ That the association became more evident by parents’ age
and was somewhat stronger for the non-married may
suggest that social support is one possible explanation.
