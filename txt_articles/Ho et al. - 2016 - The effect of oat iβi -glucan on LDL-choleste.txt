Abstract
Oats are a rich source of β-glucan, a viscous, soluble fibre recognised for its cholesterol-lowering properties, and are associated with reduced
risk of CVD. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials (RCT) investigating the
cholesterol-lowering potential of oat β-glucan on LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB for the risk reduction of CVD. MEDLINE,
Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched. We included RCT of ≥3 weeks of follow-up, assessing the effect of diets enriched
with oat β-glucan compared with controlled diets on LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol or apoB. Two independent reviewers extracted
data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. Data were pooled using the generic inverse-variance method with random effects models and
expressed as mean differences with 95 % CI. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran’s Q statistic and quantified by the I 2-statistic. In total,
fifty-eight trials (n 3974) were included. A median dose of 3·5 g/d of oat β-glucan significantly lowered LDL-cholesterol (−0·19; 95 % CI −0·23,
−0·14 mmol/l, P < 0·00001), non-HDL-cholesterol (−0·20; 95 % CI −0·26, −0·15 mmol/l, P < 0·00001) and apoB (−0·03; 95 % CI −0·05, −0·02 g/l,
P < 0·0001) compared with control interventions. There was evidence for considerable unexplained heterogeneity in the analysis of
LDL-cholesterol (I 2 = 79 %) and non-HDL-cholesterol (I 2 = 99 %). Pooled analyses showed that oat β-glucan has a lowering effect on
LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB. Inclusion of oat-containing foods may be a strategy for achieving targets in CVD reduction.
Key words: Oats: β-Glucan: Cholesterol-lowering properties: CVD: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
Oats are a rich source of β-glucan, a viscous, soluble fibre
recognised
for
its
cholesterol-lowering
properties.
The
attenuation of blood cholesterol levels by oats was first reported
in 1963 in a study that substituted white bread for oat bread
containing 140 g of rolled oats(1). Since then, a large number of
studies have been conducted to assess the effects of oats on
cholesterol levels, especially LDL-cholesterol, for the reduction
of CVD risk. On the basis of the extensive evidence relating
an inverse association between β-glucan intake and LDL-
cholesterol, several countries have currently approved health
claims of oat β-glucan and its LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect or
CVD risk reduction(2–6).
At present, the primary lipid target for CVD risk reduction is
LDL-cholesterol,
with
non-HDL-cholesterol
and
apoB
as
alternate targets. However, it has been suggested that non-
HDL-cholesterol and apoB may be more relevant targets as
non-HDL-cholesterol contains all atherogenic cholesterol and
there is one apoB on all atherogenic lipoprotein particles.
Furthermore, both non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB have been
shown to be highly correlated with CVD risk, especially when
LDL-cholesterol appears to be within the normal range(7), and
have been added to the Third Report of the National Cholesterol
Education Program – Adult Treatment Panel and the Canadian
Cardiovascular Society (CCS) lipid guidelines as alternate lipid
targets for CVD risk reduction(8,9).
In contrast to the established relationship between oat
β-glucan and LDL-cholesterol, there is currently little under-
standing of the relationship between oat β-glucan and alternate
markers of CVD risk – that is, non-HDL-cholesterol and
apoB. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic
review and meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials (RCT)
to analyse the evidence of the effect of oat β-glucan on

Methods
Protocol and registration
The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven-
tions was used to plan and conduct this meta-analysis(10).
Results were reported in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis
guidelines(11). The review protocol is available online at
ClinicalTrials.gov (registration no. NCT02068248).
Search strategy and data sources
MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials were searched, using the search strategy
presented in the online Supplementary Table S1, through
5 November 2015, to identify RCT investigating the effects of
oat β-glucan on LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol or apoB.
Manual searches of references supplemented the electronic
search. One unpublished trial from our group was included in
the analysis(12). No language restrictions were imposed.
Study eligibility
All titles and abstracts were initially assessed according to
inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the online Supple-
mentary Table S2. In brief, only RCT that investigated the
effects of supplementing β-glucan from oat products on LDL-
cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and/or apoB were included
in the analysis(13,14). Trials that did not report non-HDL-
cholesterol but provided enough information to permit the
calculation of non-HDL-cholesterol (total cholesterol (TC) −
HDL-cholesterol) were also considered. Included trials involved
any population, had a minimum follow-up period of 3 weeks,
as per the United States Food and Drug Administration (US
FDA)(13,15), administered any dose of β-glucan and provided
enough information to calculate a treatment effect.
Data extraction and quality assessment
H. V. T. H. and A. Z. independently reviewed all studies that
passed the initial assessment. A standardised proforma was
used to extract relevant data including sample size, subject
characteristics (health status, sex, age, weight, etc.), study
setting
(inpatient/outpatient),
study
design
(parallel/cross-
over), follow-up duration, β-glucan dose, comparator, back-
ground diet, energy balance and funding source. If the β-glucan
content was not reported, oat bran and whole oats were
estimated at 6·9 and 5·0 %(16,17) β-glucan, respectively, and oat
soluble fibre was estimated at 92·5 % β-glucan(18). The mean
and standard deviation values were extracted for LDL-choles-
terol, non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB at baseline and follow-up
for both control and intervention groups. When standard
deviation values were not reported, they were derived from
available data (95 % CI, P-values, t or F statistics, SEM) using
standard formulae(10). If available, mean change from baseline
and standard deviation values for both groups, mean end
difference and standard deviation values, and/or mean change
from baseline difference and standard deviation values between
groups were also extracted.
The Heyland Methodological Quality Score (MQS) was used
to assess study quality(19). Points were given on the basis of
methods
(randomisation,
blinding
and
analysis),
sample
(selection,
comparibility
and
follow-up)
and
intervention
(protocol, co-intervention and cross-overs) and a maximum of
13 points could be received. Trials that received scores of
≥8 were considered to be of higher quality.
The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the study
risk of bias(10). Domains of bias assessed were sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding, outcome data and
outcome reporting. Trials were considered high risk when
methodological flaws were likely to have affected the true
outcome, low risk if the flaw was deemed inconsequential and
unclear risk when insufficient information was provided to
permit judgement. Authors were contacted for additional
information where necessary. All disagreements on the MQS
and Risk of Bias Tool were resolved by consensus.
Data management and analysis
Data were analysed using Review Manager (RevMan), version
5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration),
for primary analyses. The difference between the change from
baseline values for the intervention and the control arms was
derived from each trial for the end points of LDL-cholesterol,
non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB. When non-HDL-cholesterol
was not reported, it was calculated from aggregate data by
subtracting HDL-cholesterol from TC. A previously developed
formula was used to calculate
SD for calculated values of
non-HDL-cholesterol(20). If change from baseline values were
not available, end-of-treatment values were used. For trials
containing multiple intervention or control arms, a weighted
average was applied to combine them in order to create a single
pair-wise comparison and to mitigate the unit-of-analysis
error(10). Paired analyses were conducted for all cross-over
studies(21). Where necessary, a pooled correlation coefficient
was derived and used for calculation of an imputed SD for the
between-treatment difference. Correlation coefficients between
baseline and end-of-treatment values within each individual
cross-over trial were derived from the reported within- and
between-treatment
SD according to a published formula(21).
These correlation coefficients were transformed into z-scores
and
SD, meta-analysed using inverse-variance weighing and
back-transformed to derive the pooled correlation coefficient.
For end points, when a pooled correlation coefficient for
imputing missing SD could not be derived, a value of 0·50 was
assumed, as it is a conservative estimate for an expected range
of 0–1. The values derived from each trial were pooled and
analysed for LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB
using the generic inverse-variance method with random effects
models, which were used even in the absence of statistically
significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more
conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of

 residual heterogeneity. Data are expressed as mean differences
(MD)
with
95 %
CI.
Furthermore,
results
are
presented
separately according to individual study inclusion criteria.
The hypercholesterolic group included studies that recruited
participants
who
were
hypercholesterolaemic,
and
the
unclassified group included studies that did not specify
that participants had to be hypercholesterolaemic. A two-sided
P-value <0·05
was
set
as
the
level
of
significance
for
comparisons of MD.
Inter-study heterogeneity was tested using Cochran’s Q statistic
and quantified using the I 2-statistic with a significance level set at
P< 0·10. I 2 values <50, ≥50 to <75 and ≥75 % were considered
to be evidence for ‘moderate,’ ‘substantial’ and ‘considerable’
heterogeneity, respectively(10). Sources of heterogeneity were
explored using sensitivity and subgroup analyses. To determine
whether a single trial exerted undue influence on the overall
results, sensitivity analyses were performed in which each indi-
vidual trial was removed from the meta-analysis and the effect
size was re-calculated with the remaining trials. Sensitivity ana-
lyses were also undertaken using correlation coefficients of 0·25,
0·50 and 0·75 to determine whether the overall results were
robust to the use of different derived correlation coefficients in
paired analyses of cross-over trials. A priori subgroup analyses
(continuous and categorical) were conducted for baseline values
of LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB within the
intervention arm, dose, design, follow-up and study quality. Meta-
regression was performed to assess the significance of subgroup
effects with STATA software, version 13 (StataCorp LP), with a
significance level set at P < 0·05.
Publication bias was investigated by visual inspection of funnel
plots and quantitatively assessed using Egger’s and Begg’s tests,
where P < 0·05 was considered evidence for small study effects.
Funnel plots were used to display the relative treatment effect
and its 95 % CI for each trial and dose amount and for the
overall random-effects meta-analyses.
Results
Search results
The search strategy initially yielded 8190 publications, of which
269 were reviewed in full and fifty-eight (n 3974) were included
in the final meta-analysis (Fig. 1). In total, fifty-six trials reported
data on LDL-cholesterol (n 3745) and seventeen on apoB
(n 1070). Only one trial reported data on non-HDL-cholesterol;
however, fifty-six other trials reported enough information to
calculate non-HDL-cholesterol (n 3926).
Trial characteristics
The characteristics of the included trials are summarised in
Table 1. Trials were conducted in both in-patient and out-
patient settings with twenty-five in North American (nineteen in
USA, five in Canada and one in Mexico), nineteen in Europe
(six in Sweden, four in England, three in the Netherlands, two in
France and one each in Denmark, Finland, Germany and
Greece), eight in Australia and New Zealand, three in Asia
(two in China and one in Thailand), one in South America
(Venezuela) and one in the Middle East (Iran). All trials were
randomised, with 66 % (thirty-eight trials) utilising a parallel
design and 34 % (twenty trials) utilising a cross-over design.
Participants were generally middle aged (median age = 50·6
(range: 10–67) years) with an approximately equal number of
men and women. Participants were slightly overweight (median
BMI = 26·8 (range: 22·8–32·2) kg/m2), despite only 4 four trials
recruiting on the basis of overweight/obese. Two-thirds of the
trials (thirty-nine trials) were conducted in hypercholester-
olaemic individuals. The dose of oat β-glucan ranged from
0·9 to 10·3 g/d with a median dose of 3·5 g/d. Treatment
duration ranged from 3 to 12 weeks with the median length
being 6 weeks for trials reporting LDL-cholesterol and non-
HDL-cholesterol and 5 weeks for trials reporting apoB.
Very few studies (nine trials, 16 %) were considered to be
of higher quality (MQS ≥ 8). Lack of or poor description of
randomisation, patient selection, protocol analysis and absence
of
double-blinding
contributed
to
lower
scores
(online
Supplementary Table S3). The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool
(online Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S4) showed that
seventeen trials (29 %) had low risk of bias and forty-two trials
(71 %) had unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation.
A total of thirteen trials (22 %) had low risk of bias, and forty-six
trials (78 %) were unclear for allocation concealment. Moreover,
thirty trials (50 %) had high risk of bias, twenty-one trials (36 %)
had low risk of bias and eight trials (14 %) had unclear perfor-
mance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); five trials
(8 %) has high risk of bias, forty-nine trials (84 %) had low risk of
bias and five trials (8 %) had unclear risk of bias for attrition
bias. The majority of trials (93 %) had low risk of bias for
reporting bias, whereas the remainder of the trials (7 %) had
unclear risk of bias for these items. Funding of trials included
agency (26 %), agency-industry (16 %), industry (34 %) sources
or were not reported (24 %).
Effect on LDL-cholesterol
The effect of oat β-glucan on LDL-cholesterol is shown in Fig. 2.
Overall, a significant LDL-cholesterol reduction was observed
with a median dose of 3·5 g/d for a median duration of 6 weeks
(MD = − 0·19 mmol/l;
95 %
CI
−0·23,
−0·14;
P < 0·00001).
However, substantial evidence of inter-study heterogeneity
was present in the overall analysis (I 2 = 79 %; P < 0·00001).
Systematic removal of individual trials did not alter the results.
Categorical a priori subgroup analyses revealed that the
LDL-cholesterol lowering effect of oat β-glucan was modified by
both study design (between-group MD=0·09mmol/l; 95% CI
0·01, 0·17; P=0·03) – studies that utilised a cross-over design
demonstrated an MD of −0·25mmol/l (95% CI −0·31, −0·18),
whereas studies that utilised a parallel design showed an MD of
−0·16mmol/l (95% CI −0·20, −0·11) – and study duration
(between-group MD=0·09mmol/l; 95% CI 0·02, 0·17; P=0·03) –
studies where oat β-glucan was administered for <6 weeks
demonstrated an MD of −0·24mmol/l (95% CI −0·29, −0·18),
whereas studies that administered oat β-glucan for 6 weeks or
more showed an MD of −0·15mmol/l (95% CI −0·20, −0·09),
(online Supplementary Fig. S2). Continuous meta-regression
analyses demonstrated an inverse association between baseline
Oat β-glucan and lipids for CVD risk reduction

 LDL-cholesterol and treatment differences for LDL-cholesterol
(β=−0·09mmol/l;
95%
CI
−0·15,
−0·03;
P=0·004)
(online
Supplementary Table S5). Heterogeneity remained significant, and
could not be explained by subgroup analyses.
Effect on non-HDL-cholesterol
The effect of oat β-glucan on non-HDL-cholesterol is shown in
Fig. 3. Overall, non-HDL-cholesterol was significantly reduced
by −0·20 mmol/l (95 % CI −0·26, −0·15), P < 0·00001, with a
median dose of 3·5 g/d for a median duration of 6 weeks.
Considerable evidence of inter-study heterogeneity was present
in the overall analysis (I 2 = 99 %; P < 0·00001). Systematic
removal of individual trials did not alter the results.
Categorical a priori subgroup analyses revealed that the non-
HDL-cholesterol lowering was not modified by dose, study
duration, study design, MQS scores or baseline non-HDL-
cholesterol levels (online Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore,
continuous meta-regression analyses did not reveal associations
between dose, treatment duration or baseline non-HDL-
cholesterol levels (online Supplementary Table S5).
Effect on apoB
The effect of oat β-glucan on apoB is shown in Fig. 4. Overall,
there was evidence of a significant lowering of apoB with
a median dose of 3·5 g/d for a median duration of 5 weeks
(MD = − 0·03 g/l;
95 %
CI
−0·05,
−0·02;
P < 0·0001)
with
moderate
evidence
of
heterogeneity
(I 2 = 38 %;
P = 0·06).
Systematic removal of individual trials did not alter the results.
Categorical a priori subgroup analyses revealed that the
apoB lowering by oat β-glucan was not modified by dose,
study duration, study design, MQS scores or baseline apoB
levels (online Supplementary Fig. S4). Furthermore, continuous
meta-regression analyses did not reveal associations between
dose, treatment duration or baseline apoB levels (online
Supplementary Table S5).
Publication bias
Funnel plots for LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and
apoB are shown in Fig. 5. Visual inspection of funnel plots
suggested minor asymmetry in the LDL-cholesterol and non-
HDL-cholesterol analyses, with tendencies for the publication of
small and/or imprecise trials favouring oat β-glucan for both.
This was confirmed by Begg’s tests (P = 0·061) for LDL-
cholesterol; however, neither Egger’s (P = 0·381) nor Begg’s
(P = 0·528) test was significant for non-HDL-cholesterol.
Discussion
The present systematic review and meta-analysis of fifty-eight
trials involving 3974 participants assessed the effects of oat
β-glucan on clinical lipid targets for CVD risk reduction (LDL-
cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB). Diets enriched
with a median dose of 3·5 g/d of β-glucan were found
to
modestly
improve
LDL-cholesterol
(−4·2 %),
non-HDL-
cholesterol
(−4·8 %)
and
apoB
(−2·3 %),
compared
with
control diets.
Brown et al.(79) were the first to undertake a comprehensive
meta-analysis of all viscous, soluble fibre types on cholesterol.
Although the main objective was to study the cholesterol-
lowering effect of all viscous, soluble fibre types, it was,
nevertheless,
the
first
to
consolidate
data
on
oats

 LDL-cholesterol levels. In total, twenty-five studies investigating
the cholesterol-lowering effect of oats were included in a sub-
group analysis, and the authors reported a significant overall
LDL-cholesterol reduction of −0·037 mmol/l (95 % CI − 0·047,
−0·017) per g of oat fibre. This is approximately equivalent to
−0·13 mmol/l per 3·5 g, 30 % less than what was observed in
our current study (Fig. 2). However, as the results from this
meta-analysis were reported as mmol/l of LDL-cholesterol
reduction per gram of soluble fibre, they cannot be directly
compared with the results of the current study.
In the most recent meta-analysis of oat β-glucan and
LDL-cholesterol(18), the authors included twenty-eight RCT and
reported an LDL-cholesterol reduction of −0·25 mmol/l (−6 %),
whereas this study demonstrated a reduction of −0·19 mmol/l
(−4·2 %). This discrepancy could be due to differences in study
selection criteria. Whitehead et al. only included RCT that
administered ≥3 g/d of oat β-glucan, which resulted in a median
daily dose of 5·1 g, whereas the current meta-analysis included
studies of all doses and observed a median dose of 3·5 g/d. When
the results were examined on a per gram basis, LDL-cholesterol
reductions were on par (Whitehead et al.: −0·050 mmol/l v., our
study: −0·054 mmol/l per g of oat β-glucan) despite the
differences in dose. Interestingly, our meta-regression analysis
indicated a significant inverse association between dose and
LDL-cholesterol levels (online Supplementary Table S4). Fur-
thermore, when dose was categorised according to Health
Canada and US FDA recommendations (<3·0 v. ≥3·0 g/d), there
was a trend towards treatment modification by dose (P = 0·051),
such that LDL-cholesterol reduction was almost double in trials
that administered ≥3·0 g/d of oat β-glucan compared with those
that administered <3·0 g/d (online Supplementary Fig. S2). These
results further support the health claims set by Health Canada
and US FDA that cholesterol lowering can be achieved with
a minimum of 3 g/d of oat β-glucan.
This is the first meta-analysis of RCT yielding information on
the effect of oat β-glucan on non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB.
These markers have been added to clinical practice guide-
lines(8,9) on the basis that they are more highly associated with
CVD risk than LDL-cholesterol(7). Furthermore, the appreciation
of these markers for CVD risk is especially important in
adults with the metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes as LDL-
cholesterol is not typically elevated in this population. Pooled
analyses demonstrated significant reductions of non-HDL-
cholesterol (−0·20 mmol/l (95 % CI −0·26, −0·15)) and apoB
(−0·03 g/l (95 % CI −0·05, −0·02)); however, the results are
compromised
by
considerable
unexplained
heterogeneity.
Interestingly, when trials were classified into the hypercholes-
terolaemic or unclassified group, of which more than a quarter
of the studies were conducted in type 2 diabetes mellitus, both
categories demonstrated significant reductions in non-HDL-
cholesterol and apoB. This is an important finding, considering
that type 2 diabetes mellitus is generally not associated with
increased LDL-cholesterol. Therefore, focusing on interventions
that reduce non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB may be more
practical and reliable for addressing the increased risk of CVD
in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Effect modification by baseline cholesterol levels has been
previously
described,
such
that
cholesterol
lowering
by
β-glucan is generally greater in those with hypercholester-
olaemia(9). This was confirmed by our meta-regression analysis
demonstrating a significant inverse association between base-
line LDL-cholesterol levels and the extent of LDL-cholesterol
reduction (online Supplementary Table S4). However, higher
baseline levels of non-HDL-cholesterol or apoB were not sig-
nificantly associated with greater reductions.
There are several limitations to the present meta-analysis that
complicate the interpretation of the results. The first one being
that the β-glucan content of oats was estimated for the majority
of trials as it was not routinely analysed and reported. As
β-glucan content varies significantly depending on genetics
and environmental growing conditions(80,81), it is difficult to
precisely measure the treatment effect when the majority of
trials did not conduct a chemical analysis of the β-glucan
content of their study products.
Second, the considerable heterogeneity that was observed in
LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol was not explained
by any of the a priori subgroup analyses. Nevertheless,
considering the large number of studies included in this meta-
analysis, high heterogeneity is inevitable. The studies included a
wide range of food matrices that were used to administer oat
β-glucan, several different processing and storage methods,
varying molecular levels of β-glucan, etc., all of which are
interrelated and significantly impact viscosity of the β-glucan,
and thus its cholesterol-lowering potency. Furthermore, nutri-
tion studies have not yet incorporated non-HDL-cholesterol into
their primary analysis, despite the simple calculation. Therefore,
in addition to all the previously mentioned sources of hetero-
geneity, the entire set of non-HDL-cholesterol data was
mathematically imputed, which may have contributed to the
increased heterogeneity.
Irrespective of the large heterogeneity associated with
including studies that were conducted in a wide range of par-
ticipants, in numerous countries, and used various common
food products to administer the oat β-glucan, the results can
be considered largely generalisable and indicative that the
cholesterol-lowering benefits can be achieved by supple-
menting oat β-glucan into commonly consumed foods.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis
supports the dose-dependent intake of oat β-glucan for the
reduction of LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB in
middle-aged participants. Because of considerable unexplained
heterogeneity, caution should be taken when interpreting the
results. There is a need for larger, longer, high-quality RCT on
the effect of oat β-glucan on blood cholesterol levels, especially
non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB end points, and in participants
with different metabolic phenotypes. Special attention should
be paid to β-glucan molecular weight and content in these trials
to allow for a more accurate assessment of the cholesterol-
lowering properties of β-glucan.
