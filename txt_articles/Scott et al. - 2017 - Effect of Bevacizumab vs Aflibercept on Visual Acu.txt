IMPORTANCE Studies have established the efficacy and safety of aflibercept for the treatment
of macular edema due to central retinal vein occlusion. Bevacizumab is used off-label to treat
this condition despite the absence of supporting data.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether bevacizumab is noninferior to aflibercept for the
treatment of macular edema secondary to central retinal or hemiretinal vein occlusion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The SCORE2 randomized noninferiority clinical trial was
conducted at 66 private practice or academic centers in the United States, and included 362
patients with macular edema due to central retinal or hemiretinal vein occlusion who were
randomized 1:1 to receive aflibercept or bevacizumab. The first participant was randomized
on September 17, 2014, and the last month 6 visit occurred on May 6, 2016. Analyses included
data available as of December 30, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Eyes were randomized to receive intravitreal injection of bevacizumab
(1.25 mg; n = 182) or aflibercept (2.0 mg; n = 180) every 4 weeks through month 6.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was mean change in visual acuity
(VA) letter score (VALS) from the randomization visit to the 6-month follow-up visit, based on
the best-corrected electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study VALS (scores range
from 0-100; higher scores indicate better VA). The noninferiority margin was 5 letters, and
statistical testing for noninferiority was based on a 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval.
RESULTS Among 362 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 69 [12] years; 157 [43.4%]
women; mean [SD] VALS at baseline, 50.3 [15.2] [approximate Snellen VA 20/100]), 348
(96.1%) completed the month 6 follow-up visit. At month 6, the mean VALS was 69.3
(a mean increase from baseline of 18.6) in the bevacizumab group and 69.3 (a mean increase
from baseline of 18.9) in the aflibercept group (model-based estimate of between-group
difference, −0.14; 97.5% CI, −3.07 to �; P = .001 for noninferiority), meeting criteria for
noninferiority. Ocular adverse events in the aflibercept group included 4 participants with
intraocular pressure (IOP) more than 10 mm Hg greater than baseline; ocular adverse events
in the bevacizumab group included 1 participant with endophthalmitis (culture negative),
9 with IOP more than 10 mm Hg greater than baseline, 2 with IOP higher than 35 mm Hg,
and 1 with angle-closure glaucoma not attributed to the study drug or procedure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with macular edema due to central retinal
or hemiretinal vein occlusion, intravitreal bevacizumab was noninferior to aflibercept with
respect to visual acuity after 6 months of treatment.

etinal vein occlusion is the most common reti-
nal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy, with
population-based prevalence estimates in individuals
aged 40 years or older of 0.4% in a German cohort,1 0.6%
in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin,2 and 1.6% in an Australian
cohort.3 Analysis across 15 population-based studies from the
UnitedStates,Europe,Asia,andAustraliaestimatedtheworld-
wide prevalence of retinal vein occlusion at 16 million adults.4
There are 3 general types of retinal vein occlusion based on
obstruction site: branch retinal vein occlusion, central retinal
veinocclusion,andhemiretinalveinocclusion.Macularedema
(central retinal swelling) is the most frequent cause of vision
loss in retinal vein occlusion.5
Aflibercept is approved by the US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration for macular edema due to central retinal
vein occlusion.6,7 Off-label use of bevacizumab8,9 for this
indication is widespread because its efficacy and safety have
been demonstrated for other retinal diseases (age-related
macular degeneration [AMD]10 and diabetic macular edema
[DME]11) and its cost (approximately $60/dose)12 is much
less than the cost of aflibercept ($1850/dose).13 This in-
vestigation, the Study of Comparative Treatments for Ret-
inal Vein Occlusion 2 (SCORE2) trial, investigated whether
bevacizumab was noninferior to aflibercept for treatment
of macular edema due to central retinal or hemiretinal
vein occlusion.
Methods
Study Conduct and Oversight
The SCORE2 trial was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial
and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.14
The protocol and informed consent were approved by either
a site-specific institutional review board or centralized
institutional review board and by a National Eye Institute–
appointed data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC).
Study participants provided written informed consent.
Study Population
The full trial protocol is shown in the Supplement. Partici-
pants had a best-corrected electronic Early Treatment
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (E-ETDRS) visual acuity (VA)
letter score (VALS) between 19 and 73 (possible range is
0-100 letters; higher scores indicate better VA), center-
involved macular edema due to central retinal or hemireti-
nal vein occlusion on clinical examination, and central reti-
nal thickness on spectral-domain optical coherence
tomography (SD-OCT), defined as central subfield thickness
of 300 μm or greater if measured with a Carl Zeiss Meditec
Cirrus OCT machine or 320 μm or greater if measured with a
Heidelberg Spectralis OCT machine (Figure 1). Patients
with hemiretinal vein occlusion have been reported to be
similar to patients with branch and central retinal vein
occlusion with respect to demographic characteristics,
with fundus findings of hemiretinal vein occlusion interme-
diate between those of branch and central retinal vein oc-
clusion.15 For the results of this trial to be as generalizable as
possible, eligibility criteria permitted inclusion of patients
with hemiretinal vein occlusion to a maximum of 25% of
the total study sample.
A history of intravitreal corticosteroid use was allowed if
it was more than 4 months before randomization, and prior
intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
use was allowed if it was more than 2 months before random-
ization. Each participant’
s eligibility was determined by the
site’
s principal investigator or coinvestigator. Race and eth-
nicity were collected per requirements of the National Insti-
tutes of Health, they were determined by the participant, and
data collection instruments had fixed categories; for race,
there was an option to specify free text if the fixed categories
were not relevant.
Interventions
Study eyes were randomized 1:1 to intravitreal bevacizumab
(1.25 mg) every 4 weeks for 6 months vs intravitreal afliber-
cept (2.0 mg) every 4 weeks for 6 months. Bevacizumab was
purchased with trial funding and repackaged into single-use
vials by the University of Pennsylvania Investigational
Drug Service. Aflibercept was provided by Regeneron in
single-use vials.
Another US Food and Drug Administration–approved
drug for macular edema due to central retinal vein oc-
clusion,16 ranibizumab, was not investigated in this trial.
Although similar efficacy and safety of ranibizumab com-
pared with bevacizumab have been demonstrated in AMD
and DME,11 the cost of ranibizumab ($1950/dose) is much
higher than the cost of bevacizumab,13 and its target specific-
ity is similar to that of bevacizumab (both drugs inhibit
VEGF-A). In contrast, aflibercept has a broader mechanism of
action (inhibits VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth fac-
tor) and a higher in vitro binding affinity than bevacizumab
and ranibizumab17 and was associated with visual outcomes
superior to those associated with bevacizumab and ranibi-
zumab at 12 months in a clinical trial for DME.11
Randomization to intravitreal bevacizumab or intravit-
real aflibercept was performed centrally through a web-
based data entry system maintained at the data coordinating
Key Points
Question Is bevacizumab, a commonly used off-label
treatment, noninferior to aflibercept, a US Food and Drug
Administration–approved treatment, for visual acuity in eyes
with macular edema due to central retinal or hemiretinal
vein occlusion?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 362
patients, the mean visual acuity letter score increase from baseline
was 18.6 in the bevacizumab group and 18.9 in the aflibercept
group (model-based estimate of mean difference, −0.14, meeting
criteria for noninferiority).
Meaning Among patients with macular edema secondary to
central retinal or hemiretinal vein occlusion, intravitreal
bevacizumab was noninferior to aflibercept for visual acuity
after 6 months of treatment.

 center (The Emmes Corporation) using a permuted block de-
sign with random block sizes of 4 and 8, stratified into 1 of 3
baseline screening VA groups in the same manner as in the
SCORE Study18: good (VALS of 73-59 [approximate Snellen VA
20/40 to 20/63]), moderate (VALS of 58-49 [approximate
Snellen VA 20/80 to 20/100]), and poor (VALS of 48-19
[approximate Snellen VA 20/125 to 20/400]).
Study visits were scheduled every 4 weeks for 6
months. Following primary outcome assessment at month
6, participants were followed through month 12 according
to a protocol-defined treatment strategy based on response at
month 6. Eyes with a protocol-defined good response
at month 6 were randomized to continue treatment with
the originally assigned drug on either a monthly or treat-
and-extend schedule. Eyes with a protocol-defined poor
response at month 6 were switched to an alternative treat-
ment; eyes in the bevacizumab group with a poor response at
month 6 were to receive aflibercept treatment, and eyes in
the aflibercept group with a poor response at month 6 were
to receive intravitreal dexamethasone implant treatment.
This article focuses on the first 6 months of follow-up. At
each study follow-up visit, both eyes had VA assessed by the
E-ETDRS method,19 intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement,
and slitlamp and dilated ophthalmoscopic examinations.
Images from SD-OCT were obtained monthly. Fundus photo-
graphs and (at selected sites) ultra–wide-field fluorescein
angiograms were obtained at baseline and month 6. Study
participants were masked to treatment assignment through
month 6. At month 6, VA examiners and SD-OCT technicians
were masked to treatment assignments.
Outcomes
The prespecified primary outcome was change in best-
corrected E-ETDRS VALS from baseline to month 6, with the
noninferiority margin set at 5 letters. The noninferiority
margin was selected in part because it was the same margin

 used in prior trials evaluating anti-VEGF agents for retinal
disease.10,20 Further, it has been reported that a true differ-
ence exceeding 5 letters represents a clinically important
difference.21 Secondary outcomes include mean change from
baseline in VALS at other time points, percentage of partici-
pants with a VALS decrease from baseline of at least 15, per-
centage of participants with a VALS gain from baseline of at
least 15, and mean change from baseline in central subfield
thickness. Post hoc outcomes include the proportion of eyes
with a VALS of 70 or better and the proportion of eyes with
resolution of macular edema (defined as central subfield
thickness <300 μm, no subretinal or intraretinal fluid, and no
cystoid spaces within the ETDRS grid based on reading center
evaluation). The secondary VA outcomes were selected
because a VALS gain or decrease of at least 15 and meeting a
VALS of 70 represent clinically meaningful outcomes to the
patient. The SD-OCT secondary outcomes of mean change
before and after treatment as well as the proportion of eyes
with resolution of macular edema were included because
they are important measures used by ophthalmologists in
assessing treatment response and need for additional treat-
ment in patients with macular edema.
The statistical analysis plan (Supplement) describes
other secondary efficacy outcomes not included in this
article. These other secondary outcomes include VA cat-
egorized into improved, stable, and worse, overall and
within baseline VA strata; SD-OCT outcomes of center point
thickness, macular volume, measurement of photoreceptor
length, outer segment length, integrity of the photoreceptor
inner segment–outer segment junction, and percentage
change from baseline in calculated retinal thickness at
the center of the macula; fundus photography outcome
of area of retinal hemorrhage; ultra–wide-field fluorescein
angiography outcome of area of peripheral retinal non-
perfusion and leakage; and vision-related quality of life as
measured by the National Eye Institute 25-Item Visual
Function Questionnaire. These outcomes, including data
from the analyses at 12 months, will be included in subse-
quent reports.
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities coding of ad-
verse events was used to select events specified by the
Antiplatelet Trialists’Collaboration.22
Statistical Analysis
The target sample size of 360 study eyes, calculated to attain
at least 80% power, was based on testing noninferiority of
bevacizumab to aflibercept using a VALS margin of 5 and a
1-tailed type I error of .025, assuming an SD of 16 letters for
change from baseline in VALS (based on a prior study16) and
10% attrition by month 6. Interim efficacy testing was car-
ried out using the Lan-DeMets23 interim monitoring bound-
ary with a 1-tailed level .025 O’
Brien-Fleming–type spending
function, adapted for noninferiority testing. The DSMC
reviewed outcome data by treatment group, but no formal
statistical tests were examined by the DSMC until the sample
size reestimation was performed. The DSMC recommended
no modification to this trial’
s sample size or early stopping
due to efficacy based on these analyses.
The noninferiority analysis for the primary outcome was
performed based on the treatment group to which study par-
ticipants were randomized, consistent with intention-to-treat
principles. The noninferiority test modeled baseline and
6-month VALS as a 2-step time series in which each 6-month
outcome is correlated with its corresponding baseline mea-
sure. Sensitivity analysis used multiple imputation modified
to explore missing-at-random and missing-not-at-random
hypotheses to assess the effect of missing data on the pri-
mary outcome finding. The multiple imputation technique
was used based on a model that imputed missing month 6
VALS, based on treatment assignment and nonmissing VALS
from baseline through month 5, and central subfield thick-
ness values from baseline through month 6. To assess the
potential influence of conflict of interest on the primary out-
come findings, a secondary analysis of the primary outcome
was performed that included a covariate to identify patients
from sites with investigators who reported a financial conflict
of interest.
Confidence intervals were based on t distributions for
means and mean changes and Wald approximation for per-
centages. P values for analysis of baseline VA stratum (good,
moderate, poor), anti-VEGF treatment for macular edema
prior to baseline (yes, no), and disease status (central retinal
or hemiretinal vein occlusion) subgroups were based on
normal-based and logistic regression mixed models in which
month 6 data were regressed on treatment assignment, sub-
group indicator, and treatment-by-subgroup interaction.
Prior anti-VEGF treatment and disease status variables were
not listed in the statistical analysis plan, and analyses of
these variables need to be interpreted as post hoc. In the
monthly analyses, participant-level temporal autocorrelation
is modeled as an autoregressive time series, which included
a time-by-treatment interaction. P values tested the
unweighted average across 6 months of the estimated treat-
ment effect in each month. Controlling for multiple testing of
secondary findings was accomplished by adjusting P values
using the Hochberg sequentially rejective method.24
Adjusted 2-tailed P < .05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant in secondary analyses. Confidence intervals are uncor-
rected for multiple testing and intended only to describe the
uncertainty in the estimates.
SAS statistical software versions 9.3 and 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc) were used to conduct statistical analyses. Analyses
included data available as of December 30, 2016.

ization and month 5 (P = .32).
VA Outcomes
The mean VALS improved from 50.3 at baseline to 64.1 at
month 1 and to 69.3 at month 6 in the aflibercept group, and
improved from 50.4 at baseline to 62.3 at month 1 and to 69.3
at month 6 in the bevacizumab group (Figure 2). At month 6,
bevacizumab was noninferior to aflibercept based on a VALS
margin of 5 (bevacizumab minus aflibercept mean differ-
ence, −0.14; 1-tailed 97.5% CI, −3.07 to �; P for noninferior-
ity = .001; within the noninferiority margin of −5). Missing
month 6 outcomes (5 of 180 participants [2.8%] in the afliber-
cept group; 9 of 182 participants [4.9%] in the bevacizumab
group) were ignored in the primary analysis, consistent
under a maximum likelihood analysis with the missing-at-
random assumption. In the missing-at-random analysis, the
bevacizumab minus aflibercept mean difference was −0.49
(1-tailed 97.5% CI, −3.39 to �; P for noninferiority = .001).
A sensitivity analysis used multiple imputation modified to
explore not-missing-at-random hypotheses and showed that
the primary analysis was robust to moderate departures from
missing at random. In a secondary analysis, after adjusting
for all factors in Table 1, the noninferiority result remained
(bevacizumab minus aflibercept mean difference, −0.72;
1-tailed 97.5% CI, −3.87 to �; P for noninferiority = .01). In
another secondary analysis in which sites were grouped
according to whether an investigator affirmed a financial
conflict of interest or not and in which the primary outcome
analysis was repeated including in the model an indicator
variable for conflict of interest and the conflict-by-treatment
interaction, there was neither a significant effect of conflict
(P = .73) nor a conflict × treatment interaction (P = .99).
In the aflibercept group, 114 eyes (65.1%) had a VALS gain
of at least 15 at month 6 compared with 106 eyes (61.3%) in the
bevacizumab group. The odds of a VALS gain of at least 15 av-
eraged over months 1 to 6 was not significantly different for
afliberceptrelativetobevacizumab(oddsratio[OR] = 0.85;95%
CI, 0.62-1.17; P = .89). Less than 2% in each group had a VALS
decrease of at least 15 at month 6 (3 of 175 eyes [1.7%] in the
aflibercept group; 3 of 173 eyes [1.7%] in the bevacizumab
group). In post hoc analysis, the number of eyes achieving a
VALS of at least 70 (approximate Snellen VA 20/40) at month
6 was 101 (57.7%) in the aflibercept group and 99 (57.2%) in
the bevacizumab group, with the odds of a VALS of at least 70
over months 1 to 6 for the aflibercept group not significantly
differentfromthoseofthebevacizumabgroup(OR = 0.82;95%
CI, 0.59-1.13; P = .89). The treatment effect comparing beva-
cizumab with aflibercept was homogeneous in the identified
subgroups (Table 2).
SD-OCT Outcomes
Both groups showed statistically significant SD-OCT central
subfield thickness decreases from baseline through month 6
(Table 3 and Figure 3). With a mean (SD) baseline central sub-
field thickness of 652 (215) μm in the aflibercept group, there

month 1 and 425 μm (95% CI, −461 to −389 μm) at month 6.
For the bevacizumab group, with a mean (SD) baseline cen-
tral subfield thickness of 678 (233) μm, there was a mean de-
crease of 333 μm (95% CI, −366 to −299 μm) at month 1 and
387 μm (95% CI, −426 to −348 μm) at month 6. The bevaci-
zumab minus aflibercept estimate of the change from base-
line treatment effect averaged over the 6 months was 49.3 μm
(95% CI, 1.93 to 96.74 μm) in favor of aflibercept, a difference
that is not statistically significant (P = .83).
Post hoc analyses showed that at month 6, 92 of 169 eyes
(54.4%) in the aflibercept group had resolution of macular
edema compared with 49 of 172 eyes (28.5%) in the bevaci-
zumab group. The odds of complete resolution of fluid aver-
aged over months 1 to 6 was significantly lower in the bevaci-
zumab group compared with the aflibercept group (OR = 0.28;
95% CI, 0.20 to 0.39; P < .001). The treatment effect compar-
ing bevacizumab with aflibercept was homogeneous in the
identified subgroups (Table 3). An example of both baseline
and month 6 color fundus photographs and SD-OCT scans in
a participant in this trial is shown in Figure 4.
Adverse Events
Most ocular adverse events of interest were rare (Table 4).
One case of endophthalmitis (culture negative) occurred in the
bevacizumab group. Two participants receiving bevaci-
zumab had IOP higher than 35 mm Hg at a monthly visit
through month 6, and 4 participants (2.2%) receiving afliber-
cept and 9 (4.9%) receiving bevacizumab had IOP more than
10 mm Hg greater than baseline, with 1 participant receiving
bevacizumab experiencing angle-closure glaucoma not
attributed to the anti-VEGF agent or procedure. Antiplatelet
Trialists’Collaboration events occurred in 2 participants (1.1%)
receiving aflibercept (including a fatal myocardial infarction)
and 2 participants (1.1%) receiving bevacizumab. Two deaths
(myocardial infarction and metastatic bladder cancer) oc-
curred, 1 in each group, through 6 months.
Discussion
In this study of patients with macular edema due to central
retinal or hemiretinal vein occlusion, intravitreal bevaci-
zumab was noninferior to intravitreal aflibercept for VA after
6 months of treatment, based on a VALS noninferiority mar-
gin of 5. In secondary analyses, there were no significant dif-
ferences between bevacizumab and aflibercept in terms of
VA throughout 6 months of follow-up. The magnitude of im-
provement in mean VALS from baseline to month 6 in the
aflibercept and bevacizumab groups (18.9 and 18.6 letters,
respectively) was comparable with that reported with monthly
ranibizumab injections in the CRUISE Study16 (14.9 letters)
and with monthly aflibercept injections in the COPERNICUS6
(17.3 letters) and GALILEO7 (18.0 letters) trials. The propor-
tion of eyes with a VALS gain of at least 15 from baseline to
month 6 in the aflibercept and bevacizumab groups (65.1% and
61.3%, respectively) is 13% to 17% higher than that reported
in CRUISE (47.7%), and more similar to those with gains re-
ported in both the COPERNICUS (56.1%) and GALILEO (60.2%)
trials. These trials support the favorable effect of anti-VEGF
therapy on vision loss due to macular edema from central reti-
nal vein occlusion. While the COPERNICUS and GALILEO trials
includedonlytreatment-naivepatientswithcentralretinalvein
occlusion,6,7 this trial included both treatment-naive pa-
tients as well as patients who had received prior anti-VEGF
treatment. In this trial, there was no significant difference in
treatment effect between treatment-naive and previously
treated participants.
In Protocol T11 conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy
Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) to evaluate the relative
efficacy and safety of aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibi-
zumab for the treatment of DME, there was a greater treat-
ment effect on VALS at 1 year associated with aflibercept
compared with bevacizumab in the poor VA stratum (20/50
to 20/320) and no difference in treatment effect in the good

 VA stratum (20/32 to 20/40) (P < .0001); the treatment
advantage of aflibercept over bevacizumab among eyes with
worse baseline VA persisted at 2 years.25 The current trial
found no such interaction of treatment effect with baseline
VA. This difference in findings between this trial and Protocol
T may be due to variation in the a priori definition of baseline
VA strata (there were only 38 eyes in this trial with VA of
20/40 or better). Additionally, response to treatment may
vary based on the retinal disease studied.
Both aflibercept and bevacizumab were associated with
significant central subfield thickness reduction, consistent
with previous clinical trials of anti-VEGF therapy for macular
edema due to central retinal vein occlusion.6,7,16 In this trial,
DRCR.net Protocol T,11 and the Comparison of Age-Related
Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT)10 (which
evaluated the relative efficacy and safety of ranibizumab and
bevacizumab for treatment of neovascular AMD), bevaci-
zumab was associated with a significantly lower proportion
of eyes that achieved resolution of macular edema than the
comparative on-label anti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab in
CATT; aflibercept and ranibizumab in Protocol T). In this trial
and CATT, the lower proportion of eyes with resolution of
fluid among eyes treated with bevacizumab did not translate
into poorer VA outcomes at the primary outcome visits of
these 2 clinical trials.10,11 This was also true at 12 months (pri-
mary outcome) in the participants with better baseline VA in
Protocol T.11 Continued follow-up of participants in this trial
will allow evaluation of the cumulative effect of the presence
of fluid on VA in all treatment groups and on the number of
injections administered in participants assigned to the treat-
ment groups not defined by a fixed-dosing schedule.
Baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2
treatment groups except for the shorter time between diag-
nosis of macular edema and randomization in the bevaci-
zumab group. The extent to which baseline characteristics
like duration between diagnosis of macular edema and
randomization may confound the primary results was ex-
amined through a secondary noninferiority analysis that

At baseline, the color fundus photograph of the central 30° of the retina
showed extensive retinal hemorrhages and dilated retinal veins. The optic nerve
was not visible because of retinal edema and blood. Retinal edema was present
throughout the retina and is best seen on optical coherence tomography (OCT),
which provides a cross-sectional image of the retina. The OCT scan shown here
was taken through the center of the retina. The participant’
s visual acuity was
20/400 at baseline. At month 6, the color fundus photograph of the retina in
the same participant showed nearly complete resolution of intraretinal blood
after receiving monthly injections of aflibercept for 6 months. The optic nerve
was visible and appeared normal. The OCT scan showed that retinal edema
resolved and the fovea returned to its normal contour. At month 6,
the participant’
s visual acuity improved to 20/40.

 adjusted for all factors in Table 1. The adjusted secondary
analysis supported the noninferiority conclusion reached in
the primary analysis.
Rates of adverse events in the current study were similar
for both drugs and are consistent with those reported
in other phase 3 trials evaluating anti-VEGF therapy for reti-
nal vein occlusion,6,7,16,26-29 neovascular AMD,10,26 and
DME.11,25,27 Although this trial was not powered to identify
differences between treatment groups in rare adverse events,
new safety concerns associated with anti-VEGF therapy were
not identified. The bevacizumab used in this trial was com-
mercially acquired and repackaged into single-use vials by
the University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Service,
which performed a similar service in CATT10 and DRCR.net
Protocol T.11 The adverse event profile and efficacy associ-
ated with commercially available single-use syringes of
repackaged bevacizumab may differ from the adverse event
profile and efficacy associated with the repackaged bevaci-
zumab study drug evaluated in this trial. However, in a retro-
spective cohort study using medical claims data from ambu-
latory care centers across the United States from 2005
through 2012, the rate of postinjection endophthalmitis was
not significantly different among the 296 565 injections of
compounded bevacizumab packaged into single-use syringes
compared with the 87 245 injections of ranibizumab pack-
aged in single-use glass vials.30

 Cost is one of many factors that may contribute to drug
selection when treating patients. The cost of a single dose of
aflibercept is substantially greater than a single dose of
off-label repackaged bevacizumab, and because most
patients treated with anti-VEGF therapy for macular edema
associated with central retinal or hemiretinal vein occlusion
are treated with multiple doses of anti-VEGF drug, the cost
differential between the 2 drugs has important economic
implications.
Limitations
Limitations of the current trial include lack of a ranibizumab
treatment group, lack of as-needed treatment groups that
were evaluated from baseline, and relatively short follow-
up. Caution should be exercised when extrapolating results
from clinical trials to clinical practice. For instance, findings
of the current trial must be interpreted in light of the high
rate of treatment adherence, with approximately 90% of
study participants receiving all 6 of the monthly anti-VEGF
injections. Cross-trial comparisons include such caveats as
differences among trials in the timing of outcome assess-
ments; for instance, the primary outcome of the current
trial is 6 months, compared with 1 year in CATT10 and
DRCR.net Protocol T.11
Conclusions
Among patients with macular edema secondary to central
retinal or hemiretinal vein occlusion, intravitreal bevaci-
zumab was noninferior to aflibercept with respect to VA
after 6 months of treatment.
