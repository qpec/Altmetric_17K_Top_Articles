SUMMARY
Little is known about the organizational and func-
tional connectivity of the corticospinal (CS) circuits
that are essential for voluntary movement. Here,
we map the connectivity between CS neurons in
the forelimb motor and sensory cortices and various
spinal
interneurons,
demonstrating
that
distinct
CS-interneuron circuits control specific aspects
of skilled movements. CS fibers originating in the
mouse motor cortex directly synapse onto premotor
interneurons, including those expressing Chx10.
Lesions of the motor cortex or silencing of spinal
Chx10+ interneurons produces deficits in skilled
reaching. In contrast, CS neurons in the sensory
cortex do not synapse directly onto premotor inter-
neurons, and they preferentially connect to Vglut3+
spinal interneurons. Lesions to the sensory cortex
or inhibition of Vglut3+ interneurons cause deficits
in food pellet release movements in goal-oriented
tasks. These findings reveal that CS neurons in
the motor and sensory cortices differentially control
skilled movements through distinct CS-spinal inter-
neuron circuits.
INTRODUCTION
Neural circuits originating in the cerebral cortex and traversing
the spinal cord play critical roles in fine motor control (Levine
et al., 2012). Corticospinal (CS) neurons (CSNs), which regulate
voluntary motor control of the body and limbs, are located in
layer V of the cerebral cortex. Their axons pass through the inter-
nal capsule and arrive at the caudal medulla where the majority
decussate to the contralateral side of the spinal cord. Various
axon projections from the cerebral cortex, including the primary
motor (M1), primary somatosensory (S1), and premotor areas,
traverse distinct regions of the spinal cord, suggesting that
CSNs in different cortical areas may have distinct functions dur-
ing multiphasic voluntary movements (Asante and Martin, 2013;
Bareyre et al., 2002; Catsman-Berrevoets and Kuypers, 1976;
Darian-Smith et al., 1996; Dum and Strick, 1991; Lemon, 2008;
Lemon and Griffiths, 2005; Maier et al., 2002; Martin, 1996; Mur-
ray and Coulter, 1981). For instance, even a simple reaching task
involves multiple steps, such as reaching, grasping, retrieving,
and food release, which require the precise integration of sen-
sory and motor information. However, how distinct CSNs partic-
ipate in each behavioral segment remains largely unknown.
In primates, cats, and rats, CS axons from the sensory and
motor cortices exhibit specific projection patterns to innervate
the dorsal and ventral spinal cord, respectively (Bareyre et al.,
2002; Coulter and Jones, 1977; Darian-Smith et al., 1996;
Lemon, 2008; Lemon and Griffiths, 2005; Martin, 1996; Ralston
and Ralston, 1985). Previous studies suggest that CS circuits
directly regulate motor activity through CS motor pathways,
but also indirectly affect motor control by modulating sensory
information during voluntary movements (Moreno-Lo
´ pez et al.,
2016). For example, presynaptic inhibition of sensory afferents
during voluntary behaviors appears to be induced by descend-
ing pathways (likely corticospinal tracts [CSTs]) in primates
(Seki et al., 2003). Other studies indicate that CS axons send
inputs to spinal interneurons (INs) innervated by sensory affer-
ents (Bourane et al., 2015; Hantman and Jessell, 2010). Collec-
tively, these studies suggest that motor and sensory information
is integrated by CS circuits during voluntary movements, but
how their activity is coordinated is unclear.
Monosynaptic connections between CSNs and motor neu-
rons are observed both in higher-order primates and in early
postnatal rodents. These connections are eliminated later during
development in rodents but maintained in adult primates (Gu
et al., 2017a; Lemon, 2008). In contrast, CS terminations onto
spinal INs are well conserved among mammals, suggesting
that basic motor programs directed by CS systems are encoded
in cortico-interneuronal connections (Alstermark and Isa, 2012;
Kinoshita et al., 2012). Indeed, disruptions of CS-IN circuits

 cause deficits in skilled movements in primates, cats, and ro-
dents (Alstermark and Isa, 2012; Starkey et al., 2005; Whishaw
et al., 1993). However, the precise composition of the synaptic
networks linking CSNs to spinal INs that regulate fine motor con-
trol remains poorly understood. It is even unknown whether all, or
only subsets, of CSNs connect to premotor neurons. Although
multiple types of spinal INs are connected to CS axons in the spi-
nal cord (Abraira et al., 2017; Bourane et al., 2015; Chakrabarty
and Martin, 2010; Hantman and Jessell, 2010; Levine et al.,
2014; Russ et al., 2013), it is difficult to compare the strength
of various CS-IN connections across different studies given the
diversity of experimental approaches used to characterize these
pathways. Moreover, the functional importance of these connec-
tions for skilled behaviors has not been clarified. A systematic
analysis to map the connectivity between distinct CS axon pop-
ulations and various spinal IN classes will reveal important as-
pects of the functional organization of mammalian CS circuits.
Here we investigate the organizational and functional logic of
CS circuitry using mouse genetics, viral tools, electrophysiology,
and behavioral assays. Our results reveal that CS projections
originating in the sensory and motor cortices engage distinct
subpopulations of spinal INs to control skilled motor behaviors.
RESULTS
Identification of CSN Subpopulations
To begin mapping CSN-IN connectivity, we used two different
neuronal tracers to determine the prevalence of CSNs that con-
nect to premotor INs: retrobeads, a conventional retrograde
tracer; and trans-synaptic, retrograde pseudorabies viruses
(PRVs) expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP) or GFP (Fig-
ure 1A). Most of rodent CS axons reach the contralateral spinal
gray matter. Accordingly, retrobeads injected into the cervical
spinal cord of wild-type mice labeled layer V neurons mainly
contralateral to the injection site (Figure 1A). In contrast, PRVs
injected into muscles trans-synaptically moved to first-order
motor neurons, second-order premotor INs, then third-order
CSNs (Figure 1A; Gu et al., 2017b). Thus, retrobeads label
most CSNs innervating the spinal cord, irrespective of their post-
synaptic targets, whereas PRVs label only CSNs that connect
with premotor INs. Combining these neuronal tracers enabled
us to assess the degree to which CSNs connect to premotor INs.
We first injected green fluorescent retrobeads into the gray
matter at spinal cord level C5, which contains the motor neurons
that innervate forelimb muscles (Tosolini et al., 2013). PRVs were
then injected into the forelimb biceps muscle. Intriguingly, we
found that, although retrobeads+ CSNs were distributed broadly
in the mediolateral axis of layer V, PRVs labeled only a medial
subset of those cells (Figures 1B–1E). PRV+/retrobeads+ CSNs
were located in the medial area, while PRV�/retrobeads+ CSNs
were located laterally (Figure 1F). Based on anatomical and
physiological features of these cortical areas described in
previous studies (Hira et al., 2013; Manita et al., 2015; Mathis
et al., 2017; Paxinos and Franklin, 2001), the medial and lateral
areas correspond to the forelimb motor and sensory cortices,
respectively.
To further detail the distribution of CS subpopulations in the
cortex, we produced horizontal cortical maps of neurons labeled
with retrobeads and PRVs (Figures 1G–1N). Retrobeads+ CSNs
were observed in the areas mostly rostral to bregma, with two
separate areas in the rostrocaudal axis (Figure 1G), which corre-
lated well with rodent rostral and caudal forelimb motor areas
(RFA and CFA) reported previously (Tennant et al., 2011). We
also found a laterally aligned retrobeads+ area positioned over
2 mm lateral from the midline and spread more caudally (to ante-
roposterior [AP] �1.80 mm from the bregma; blue dotted area in
Figure 1G). In contrast, PRV+ CSNs were found in smaller areas
compared to retrobeads+ areas. The PRV+ neurons traced from
the biceps muscle were distributed in the medial region of the
CFA (AP �0.80 ± 0.00 mm to 1.10 ± 0.00 mm, mediolateral
[ML] 0.71 ± 0.01 mm to 1.98 ± 0.03 mm; n = 2), as well as in
the RFA (AP 1.60 ± 0.10 mm to 2.65 ± 0.05 mm, ML 0.58 ±
0.02 mm to 1.05 ± 0.04 mm; n = 2) (Figure 1H). Notably, we
observed few PRV+ cells in the area greater than 2 mm lateral
from retrobeads+ neurons (blue dotted areas in Figures 1G
and 1H). These patterns persisted when we injected PRVs
into different forelimb/upper body muscles (clavotrapezius,
acromiotrapezius, spinodeltoideus, triceps, palmaris longus,
and extensor carpi radialis; Tosolini et al., 2013) (Figures
1I–1N). Cortical maps traced from these muscles showed
PRV+ patterns similar to those for the biceps muscle (RFA, AP
1.95 ± 0.09 mm to 2.85 ± 0.06 mm, ML 0.55 ± 0.04 mm to
1.19 ± 0.10 mm; CFA, AP �0.73 ± 0.10 mm to 0.98 ± 0.07 mm,
ML 0.70 ± 0.04 mm to 1.90 ± 0.04 mm; n = 6).
Taken together, these data reveal that mouse CSNs consist of
distinct subtypes that differ in cortical position and connectivity:
CSNs in the motor (medial) cortex, but not the sensory (lateral)
cortex, connect with premotor INs.
CSNs in the Sensory and Motor Cortices Project to
Distinct Spinal Cord Regions
To determine whether CSNs from the sensory and motor
cortices differ in axonal projection patterns to the spinal cord,
we injected biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), an anterograde
tracer, into the medial (PRV+/retrobeads+) and lateral (PRV�/
retrobeads+) cortical regions (Figures 2A and 2B). First, we
examined the projection patterns of global CS populations
(which include both sensory and motor CSTs) using fore-
brain-specific
Emx1-Cre;
CAG-lox-stop-lox-tdTomato
mice
(Figure 2C). The tdTomato+ CS axons exhibited substantial in-
nervations in the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes of the spinal
gray matter at C4–7, especially in laminae III–VIII and X (Figure 2I).
Less innervation was observed in laminae I�II and IX.
CS axons traced from the sensory and motor cortices using
BDA showed distinct projection patterns. Axons from the motor
cortex projected medioventrally in laminae IV–X, with particularly
high densities in laminae V and VII (Figures 2D and 2I), while
those from the sensory cortex projected to the dorsal laminae
III–VI, with highest densities observed in laminae IV and V (Fig-
ures 2E and 2I).
We then examined the distribution of CS axon terminals in
the spinal cord by labeling presynaptic terminals using CAG-
lox-stop-lox-Synaptophysin-tdTomato (lsl-Syp-tdTomato) mice,
which express a presynaptic synaptophysin protein fused with
tdTomato in a Cre-dependent manner. Presynaptic terminals
in global CSTs (from Emx1-Cre; lsl-Syp-tdTomato mice) were

 broadly distributed in the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes
of the gray matter at C4–7, especially in laminae III–VIII and X
(Figures 2F and 2J). Fewer terminals were found in laminae I�II
and IX. We then labeled presynaptic terminals of CSNs in either
the medial or lateral cortex by injecting adeno-associated vi-
ruses (AAVs) expressing Cre recombinase into these cortical re-
gions of lsl-Syp-tdTomato mice. CSNs in the motor cortex had
presynaptic sites in the medioventral laminae IV–X of the cervical
cord, with a high number of puncta in laminae V and VII (Figures
2G and 2J). In contrast, sensory cortex neurons showed presyn-
aptic sites in laminae I–VI, with high incidence in laminae III–V
(Figures 2H and 2J). Thus, consistent with axon distribution,
the presynaptic terminals of CSNs originating from the sensory
and motor cortices in mice were concentrated within different
regions of the cervical cord, suggesting that they may connect
with distinct spinal IN populations. These segregated CS projec-
tion patterns are similar to those observed in monkeys, cats, and
rats (Bareyre et al., 2002; Coulter and Jones, 1977; Martin, 1996).
Hereafter, we refer to the CS subpopulations that derive from the
motor and sensory cortices as motor and sensory CSTs, respec-
tively (Bareyre et al., 2002).
To further define CSN subtypes, we injected BDA into
restricted cortical areas (20 locations; Figures S1A–S1C). Similar
to the segregated sensory and motor CST projections, the axons
traced from medial locations of the cortex tended to project into
the intermediate or ventral gray matter, whereas those from
lateral positions projected dorsally. However, CSNs in each
location exhibited more diverse projection patterns than simple
sensory-motor CS segregations (Figure S1D). For instance, mo-
tor CSTs traced from the most medial neurons (ML 1.0 mm) con-
tained ventral projections (D1–3 and 7 in Figure S1D), whereas
neurons located at ML 1.5 mm projected axons to the intermedi-
ate zone (D4, 8, and 12). Sensory CSTs were subdivided into
regional groups that projected axons along the mediolateral
axis (D10, 13, 14, 17, 19, and 20). The rostral RFA population
had ventromedial and bilateral projections along the midline

 (D1 and 2). The medial population caudal to bregma (corre-
sponding to the hindlimb area), sent few axon collaterals into
the cervical cord (D15, 16, and 18). These results support the ex-
istence of multiple classes of CSNs characterized by their axonal
projections into the spinal cord (Figure S1E).
Identities of Spinal INs Connected to CSNs from the
Sensory and Motor Cortices
Segregated projections of sensory and motor CSTs suggest that
they may have different connectivity with spinal INs. Although
spinal INs are classified into dozens of subtypes (e.g., dI1–6
and V0–3 INs) that are defined by specific developmental gene
expression profiles (Alaynick et al., 2011) (Figures S2A and
S2B), their systematic connectivity with descending CS fibers
has never been mapped. We labeled a variety of spinal IN
populations using mouse lines expressing Cre in different IN
subtypes, crossed them with CAG-lox-CAT-lox-EGFP reporter
mice (CC-EGFP) (Figure S2C), and examined the following
different classes of IN populations: Atoh1+ (dI1), Olig3+ (dI13),
Isl1+ (dI3), Ptf1a+ (dI4–dILA), Lmx1b+ (dILB–dI5), Dbx1+ (dI6V0),
Chat+ (V0C), En1+ (V1), Chx10+ (V2a), Nkx2.2+ (V3), and Vglut3+
INs (dorsal INs). We found that each IN subtype was distributed
in specific spatial patterns in the adult mouse spinal cord (Fig-
ures S2D–S2L).
We then examined which IN subtypes connected to CS axons
by injecting AAVs expressing tdTomato into the cerebral cortex
of Cre; CC-EGFP reporter mice (Figures S3A–S4C). Presynaptic
CST terminals were detected using the excitatory presynaptic
marker, Vglut1, and Vglut1+/tdTomato+ puncta were compared
to GFP+ INs to determine anatomical contacts. The ratios of con-
nected INs and numbers of presynaptic puncta revealed that
each IN subtype had varying levels of anatomical connectivity
with the global CSTs, which ranged from 65% (Dbx1+) to
98.9% (Atoh1 (D)+; Figure S3D). Average synapse numbers per
IN ranged from 2.21 (Olig3+) to 6.35 (Vglut3+ (M)) (Figure S3E).
To identify anatomical connections between different INs
and the motor and sensory CSTs, we injected BDA into the
medial or lateral cortical region of each Cre; CC-EGFP line,
and we counted Vglut1+/BDA+ presynaptic puncta on GFP+
INs (Figures 3A–3I). This localized CST labeling revealed some
segregation of spinal connectivity. Motor CS axons connected
mainly with INs in the ventral and intermediate spinal cord re-
gions, whereas few, if any, connections were seen with dorsal
INs (Figures 3A, 3C, 3E–3G, S4F, and S3H). Classes of INs
showing predominant connectivity with motor CS systems
were Atoh1 (V)+, Isl1+, Chat+, En1+, Chx10+, and Nkx2.2+ (Fig-
ure 3J), with the highest connectivity displayed by Chx10+ and
Isl1+ INs (65.2% and 55.6%, respectively). Mid-level ratios
were seen in Atoh1 (V)+ and Chat+ INs, while Nkx2.2+ and En1+
INs exhibited the lowest connectivity with the motor CST. Sen-
sory CS axons, on the other hand, predominantly contacted dor-
sal INs, with virtually no connections observed with ventral IN
populations (Figures 3B, 3D, 3H, 3I, S3G, and S3I). The most
numerous sensory CST contacts were observed in Vglut3 (D) +
and Lmx1b + INs (Figure 3J). In our experiments, the average
numbers of CS presynaptic terminals seemed to correlate with
connection ratios, and IN subtypes with the highest connectivity
ratios also exhibited the highest average number of puncta (Fig-
ure S3J; e.g., Chx10+, 1.85 ± 0.22; Isl1+, 1.65 ± 0.08). Vglut3 (D) +
and Lmx1b + INs had relatively higher numbers of presyn-
aptic contacts with sensory CS fibers (Figure S3J; Vglut3 (D) +,
1.89 ± 0.16; Lmx1b+, 1.84 ± 0.04).
Interestingly, we found that some IN populations received
inputs from both motor and sensory CSTs (Atoh1 (D)+, Olig3+,
Ptf1a+, and Vglut3 (M)+ INs). Inputs were unbalanced, however,
with Atoh1 (D)+ INs exhibiting more inputs from motor CS axons
and Ptf1a+ and Vglut3 (M)+ INs showing biases toward sensory
axons (Figure 3J). These IN populations with convergent inputs
were mainly located in the intermediate dorsal zone of the gray
matter (Figure S2), where motor and sensory CS axons coincide,
particularly in lamina V (Figures 2I and 2J).
We summarized the connectivity of motor and sensory
CSTs with IN subtypes using two measures (Figures 3K, 3L,
and S2B): (1) the percentage of INs connected with CS axons
(Figure 3J), and (2) the mean number of Vglut1+ and BDA+
synapses per IN (Figure S3J). These measures were multiplied
(i.e., percentage of cells receiving CS input 3 mean number
of Vglut1+/BDA+ synapses onto this population) to create a
weighted connectivity map for motor (Figure 3K) and sensory
(Figure 3L) CSTs. These density calculations highlighted the
distinct connectivity of sensory and motor CS systems in the
cervical cord, wherein the INs highly connected to motor CS
axons were Chx10 +, Atoh1+, and Isl1+ subpopulations, while
those showing extensive connectivity to the sensory CS system
were Lmx1b+ and Vglut3+ INs.
Visualization of CS-IN Connectivity by trans-Synaptic
Rabies Viruses
To further examine the connectivity between CS axons and
three representative spinal IN populations (Chx10+, Ptf1a+,
and Vglut3+), we performed monosynaptic retrograde tracing
assays using an EnvA-coated G-deleted rabies virus expressing
mCherry (EnvA-SADDG-mcherry) that infects only the cells
expressing an avian-specific retroviral TVA receptor and moves

 trans-synaptically in a retrograde manner only in the presence
of G proteins (Osakada et al., 2011). We expressed TVA and
G proteins in Chx10+ or Vglut3+ INs by injecting AAVs encoding
both proteins (AAV1-Syn-FLEX-TVA-2A-EGFP-2A-RVG) into the
cervical cords of Chx10- or Vglut3-Cre mice or into Ptf1a+ INs
using
Ptf1a-Cre;
lox-stop-lox-histone
GFP-2A-TVA-2A-RVG
mice (Figure 4A). EnvA-SADDG-mCherry viruses were then in-
jected into the same areas of the cervical cord. Consistent with
our anterograde tracing assay results (Figure 3), the majority of
CSNs connected to Chx10+ INs were located in the medial re-
gion of the cortex, indicating that they are involved in motor CS
circuitry (Figures 4B, 4E, and 4F). CSNs connected to Vglut3+
and Ptf1a+ INs were observed more frequently in the lateral
(sensory) cortex, although some cells were also present in the
medial and mediolateral borders (Figures 4C–4F).
Physiological Connections between CSNs and
Spinal INs
We then examined the functionality of the anatomical connec-
tions between CSNs and Chx10+ and Ptf1a+ INs using a com-
bined optogenetic and electrophysiological approach. We in-
jected AAVs into the cerebral cortex to express ChR2 in the
CST, and we obtained patch-clamp recordings from GFP+ INs
in cervical slices of Chx10-Cre and Ptf1a-Cre; CC-EGFP mice
(Figure 5A). Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were
evoked by blue laser stimulation and classified as monosynaptic
based on the following: (1) the ability to follow repetitive high-
frequency stimulation (10 Hz) with a relatively constant latency
(jitter < 3.5 ms), and (2) an absence of synaptic failures (although
repetitive stimulation often caused a gradual depression of
EPSC amplitudes; Figures 5B and 5C). Among the 18 cells
analyzed from Chx10-Cre; CC-EGFP mice, 50% exhibited either
mono- or polysynaptic EPSCs, and 4 cells showed monosyn-
aptic EPSCs with an average latency of 4.52 ± 0.27 ms (Fig-
ure 5B). From the 20 cells examined from Ptf1a-Cre; CC-EGFP
mice, 10 cells exhibited EPSCs, 3 of which had putative mono-
synaptic EPSCs with an average latency of 5.75 ± 0.19 ms (Fig-
ure 5C). This electrophysiological data strongly suggest that CS
axons synapse directly onto Chx10+ and Ptf1a+ IN populations.
Physiological Connections of Sensory and Motor CSTs
with Muscles
Based on the differences in sensory and motor CST projections
and their connectivity with premotor INs, we also investigated
the physiological connections between the sensory or motor
cortices and muscles. We performed intracortical microstimula-
tion (ICMS) in different mediolateral locations where CSNs reside
(ML 0.5–3.0 mm and AP 0.5–1.0 mm; Figures 1G–1N and 6A),
and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from a forelimb
muscle. Upon stimulation of medial cortical areas encompassing
either the motor cortex (ML 1.0–1.5 mm) or the border between
the sensory and motor cortices (ML 2.0 mm), EMG responses
were clearly evoked in the biceps muscle with relatively low
thresholds (Figures 6B, 6C, and 6E). Although muscle responses
in the biceps were also detected following stimulation of lateral
areas (ML 2.5–3.0 mm), the thresholds to evoke EMGs gradually
increased compared to the medial areas (Figures 6D and 6E).
Furthermore, stimulation of the lateral cortex evoked smaller
EMG responses compared to those produced by medial stimuli
(Figures 6B–6D and 6F). These data suggest that the motor CST

 has stronger functional connections with muscles than the sen-
sory CST.
We also specifically targeted layer V neurons using an alterna-
tive optogenetic approach with Thy1-ChR2 mice, which express
ChR2 only in layer V of the cerebral cortex (Ayling et al., 2009).
We again compared EMG responses from the biceps muscle
when laser stimulation was applied along the mediolateral axis
of the cortex. Clear EMG responses were observed when medial
areas (ML 1.0–2.0 mm) were stimulated (Figure 6G), whereas
stimulation to the lateral cortex (ML 2.5–3.0 mm) evoked re-
sponses only at higher thresholds (Figure 6G). Consistent with
the anatomical data, these two electrophysiological approaches
suggest that the motor CST establishes physiologically func-
tional circuits that efficiently evoke forelimb muscle movements
whereas the sensory CST has weaker connections to those
muscles.
Next, we looked at how INs mediate CST-induced muscle
activation. For this, we focused on Chx10+ spinal INs, which
were one of the major excitatory IN populations connected
with the motor CST (Figure 3). Our PRV assays showed that
over 15% of PRV+ spinal INs (presumably premotor neurons)
traced from the biceps muscle were Chx10+ (Figure S5). We
then tested whether these Chx10+ INs mediated muscle re-
sponses triggered from optogenetic stimulation of CSNs in the
motor cortex. We compared control mice against mice whose
Chx10+ INs were chemogenetically silenced by expressing
an engineered Gi/o-coupled human muscarinic M4 designer re-
ceptor, hM4Di, in Chx10+ neurons, which was accomplished by
injecting AAV8-Syn-DIO-hM4Di-mcherry into the postnatal cer-
vical cords of Thy1-ChR2; Chx10-Cre mice or Thy1-ChR2 con-
trol mice and inactivating the hM4Di-expressing Chx10+ neurons
through administration of the receptor’s pharmacological ligand,
clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). We found that thresholds to evoke
EMGs were significantly higher after CNO injections in Thy1-
ChR2; Chx10-Cre + hM4Di mice, but not in control Thy1-ChR2
mice (Figure 6H), indicating that Chx10+ spinal INs mediate
neuronal signals from the motor cortex to forelimb muscles.
Role of Motor and Sensory CSTs in Skilled Motor
Behaviors
Finally, to explore whether CS circuits from the motor and sen-
sory cortices control skilled movements, we ablated or silenced
cortical neurons and spinal INs involved in the CS circuits, and
we examined the resulting effects on skilled movements (Fig-
ures S6A and S6B). Using high-speed cameras, we monitored
and recorded skilled motor behaviors during a single-pellet
reaching task, a well-established test for rodents (Gu et al.,
2017b; Whishaw, 1996) (Figure S6B). We employed multiple ap-
proaches to inhibit various neuronal components of these CS cir-
cuits: (1) pyramidotomy (CST transection at the pyramid) or che-
mogenetic silencing of layer V neurons for global CST inhibition;
(2) medial (motor) cortex lesioning or chemogenetic silencing of
Chx10+ INs to inhibit the motor CS circuit; and (3) lateral (sen-
sory) cortex lesioning or chemogenetic silencing of Vglut3+ INs
to inhibit the sensory CS circuit. For medial and lateral cortical le-
sions, we induced photothrombotic stroke in restricted areas

 where motor or sensory CSNs were located (Figures S6F–S6J).
In the chemogenetic approach, we introduced hM4Di into spe-
cific neurons, and we administered CNO to block neuronal activ-
ity in the targeted populations. Specifically, we injected AAV8-
Syn-DIO-hM4Di-mcherry into the cortex of layer V-specific
Rbp4-Cre mice to express hM4Di in layer V neurons and into
the C4–7 region of Chx10-Cre and Vglut3-Cre mice to express
hM4Di in Chx10+ and Vglut3+ INs (Figures S6K–S6O). Regard-
less of the approach chosen, success rates in the single-pellet
reaching task were significantly diminished (Figures 7A–7G).
We then took a closer look at individual components of
the affected behaviors in test mice. The single-pellet reach-
ing task involves multiple ordered motions, which are divided
into 10 components for rodents: limb lifting, digits closing,
aiming, advancement, digit extension, pronation, grasping,
supination I, supination II, and food release (Whishaw, 1996).
We determined which motions exhibited defects within this com-
plex behavioral sequence by scoring the deficits in each motion
using frame-by-frame analysis of video recordings (Figure S6C).

After identifying the motion phases that
were commonly affected by neural inhibi-
tion of motor and sensory CS circuits, we
performed detailed kinematic analyses to
evaluate and characterize the behavioral
deficiencies (Figures S6D and S6E).
Our
pyramidotomy

severely
affected skilled movements with defi-
cits arising in limb lifting, advancement,
pronation, grasping, and food release
(Figure 7H; Video S1), as reported previously (Starkey et al.,
2005; Whishaw et al., 1993). In addition, inhibition of layer V neu-
rons using Rbp4-Cre mice induced deficits in advancement,
pronation, grasping, and food release (Figure 7I). Mice in
both groups frequently exhibited shorter reaching distances or
misdirected movements in the advancement phase with less
pronation, and they displayed clumsy digit movements during
the grasping and food release phases, suggesting that these
components correspond to CST-dependent motions.
To specifically inhibit the motor CS circuits, we lesioned
medial cortical neurons by focal stroke. The injured mice showed
aberrant scores particularly in the advancement, pronation, and
grasping phases of the task (Figure 7J). They exhibited shorter
reaching distances and off-target advancement, less pronation,
and clumsy grasping techniques (Video S2).
When Chx10+ INs were inhibited by hM4Di expression and
CNO administration, mice exhibited short reaching during the
advancement phase, but they did not show significant deficits
in other steps (Figure 7K; Video S3). Control mice injected with

 AAV8-Syn-DIO-hM4Di-mcherry and CNO did not show signifi-
cant deficits in those motions (Figures 7G and 7N). These results
corroborated a previous study, which showed that ablation of
Chx10+ INs disrupted skilled reaching (Azim et al., 2014).
Comparison of motions affected by motor cortex lesions
and Chx10+ IN silencing suggests that motor CST-Chx10+ IN cir-
cuits are involved in arm advancement, but not pronation and
grasping (Figures 7O and S6D). Indeed, kinematic analyses re-
vealed shallower final positions of reaching paws and similar pat-
terns of attenuated acceleration (cm/s2) in the advancement step
after medial cortical lesioning and Chx10 neuron inhibition (Fig-
ures 7P, 7Q, 7U, S6P, and S6Q). CST inhibition by pyramidotomy
or layer V silencing also exhibited similar short reaching behav-
iors and decreases in acceleration, further suggesting that
Chx10+ INs contribute to CST-dependent skilled reaching (Fig-
ures 7R, 7S, 7U, S6R, and S6S).
To inhibit sensory CS circuits, we lesioned lateral cortical neu-
rons. These mice showed aberrant movements in advancement
and food release but normal pronation and grasping (Figure 7L).
In the advancement step, the mice sometimes demonstrated
hypometria (underreaching), with reach attempts often stopping
short of the slit followed by grasping behavior, suggesting that
the mice were unable to control the timing of the shift between
reaching and grasping/retraction (Video S4). This acute termina-
tion of arm advancement seems to differ from the smooth ad-
vancements with short reaching distances seen in motor CS
inhibition (Videos S2 and S3), since kinematic analyses of the
lateral cortex-lesioned cohort revealed short reaching distances
with normal acceleration (cm/s2) in arm advancements (Figures
7T, 7U, and S6T). The lateral cortex-lesioned mice also
frequently performed supination II even when they failed to
grasp the pellet, although these behaviors seemed to be CST
independent since no other manipulations caused similar de-
fects (Video S4). If pellets were obtained, the mice often showed
apraxic manipulation and release of pellets during eating (Fig-
ure 7V; Video S5). Chemogenetic silencing of Vglut3+ INs by
hM4Di and CNO also evoked deficits in food release, while
advancement and pronation phases were unaltered (Figure 7M;
Video S6). The comparison of motions affected by sensory
cortex lesioning and silencing of Vglut3+ neurons suggests
that sensory CST-Vglut3 circuits are involved in the food release
step, but not in the global steps of forearm reaching and retrac-
tion (Figures 7O and S6D). We further quantified the timing
of food release during pellet consumption, and we found that
lesions in the lateral cortex and inhibition of Vglut3+ INs both
prolonged release times (Figure 7W). Pyramidotomy or layer V
silencing also increased release times, indicating that pellet
release is a CST-dependent motion (Figure 7W). Vglut3+ INs
were also involved in the grasping phase, as suppression of
those INs sometimes led to delays in the timing of pellet
grasping, though the overall contribution of the sensory CST
to the grasping phase seemed relatively weak (Figures 7L,
7M, and 7O).
Taken together, the correlation of deficits observed by abla-
tion or inhibition of cortical neurons or spinal INs during CST-de-
pendent motor behaviors suggests that the sensory and motor
CSTs play distinct roles in skilled movements through connec-
tions with different IN populations.
DISCUSSION
Prior studies have documented various classes of CS projec-
tions with different cortical origins in mammals, which predict
the existence of multiple compartmentalized CS circuits,
including those involving the motor and sensory cortices
(Lemon, 2008; Lemon and Griffiths, 2005). The dorsal and ventral
projections of the sensory and motor CSTs, respectively, have
been found in monkeys (Coulter and Jones, 1977), cats (Martin,
1996), and rats (Bareyre et al., 2002; Olivares-Moreno et al.,
2017), suggesting that these descending CS pathways have
essential, conserved roles across species. We found that mice
also exhibit dorsal and ventral projections in their sensory and
motor CSTs. In this study, we examined the connectivity and
functions of these two different CS populations.

 The Importance of the Motor CST for Motor Command
Taking advantage of genetic labeling tools, we performed a
comprehensive analysis of CS connections with a variety of spi-
nal INs covering most of the dorsal and ventral populations. One
of the major IN groups connected to the motor CST is the V2a
Chx10+ INs, which function in left-right alternative limb locomo-
tion (Crone et al., 2008) and are essential for skilled reaching
(Azim et al., 2014). More than 30% of Chx10+ INs are propriospi-
nal neurons with dual innervation to motor neurons at cervical
levels and to pre-cerebellar neurons of the lateral reticular nu-
cleus. Ablation of Chx10+ INs caused skilled reaching deficits,
possibly due to the disruption of propriospinal functions as an
internal copy pathway for rapid feedback corrections (Azim
et al., 2014). Our neuronal silencing assay similarly showed
that Chx10+ INs contributed specifically to reaching progression
during a pellet retrieval task. Although it is possible that silencing
Chx10+ INs may have caused skilled reaching deficits through
mechanisms unrelated to CS circuits, the accompanying reduc-
tion in EMG responses to motor cortex stimulation (Figure 6H)
strongly suggest that Chx10+ INs relay CS information to motor
neurons during skilled reaching behaviors.
Our behavioral analyses also suggest that Chx10+ INs relay
commands from CS inputs to motor neurons, since both motor
cortex lesions and Chx10+ IN silencing decelerate the speed of
the reaching arm (Figure S7). However, since motor cortex le-
sioning resulted in additional motor dysfunctions, such as loss
of pronation and clumsy grasping behaviors, other IN popula-
tions likely participate in mediating these different actions. Our
PRV data further support the idea of IN multiplicity, as Chx10+
INs comprised only 15% of the premotor neurons and silencing
Chx10+ INs did not completely abolish EMG responses (Figures
6H and S5).
Other types of INs can also relay complex motor commands
from the motor CST. Our connectivity mapping analyses identi-
fied Atoh1+ (D) and Isl1+ INs as potential premotor candidates,
which comprised 8.81% and 13.2% of PRV+ premotor INs,
respectively (n = 1–2; data not shown). Tcfap2b+ and Satb1/
2+ premotor INs residing in laminae IV and V, where Atoh1+
and Isl1+ INs are located, also receive substantial anatomical
CS inputs (Levine et al., 2014). The degree to which these
distinct, yet potentially overlapping, spinal circuits interact to
guide various skilled motions remains an important topic for
future study.
The Sensory CST and Sensorimotor Integration
Sensory CST projections were previously implicated in sensory
transmission and modulation rather than motor execution during
behavioral tasks (Lemon, 2008; Lemon and Griffiths, 2005). Here
we found that excitatory Vglut3+ INs received abundant inputs
from the sensory CST. Vglut3+ INs are involved in sensory cir-
cuits of the dorsal horn, where they receive low-threshold me-
chanosensory inputs and relay mechanical sensory information
(Peirs et al., 2015). Lesioning of the sensory cortex, or suppres-
sion of Vglut3+ INs, led to similar deficits in pellet-releasing
behaviors, which may be putative sensory compartments within
this motor task. The apraxic manipulations observed in test
mice closely resembled the clumsy digit and hand movements
observed in monkeys following sensory cortex inhibition (Hiko-
saka et al., 1985; Iwamura and Tanaka, 1991). Although we could
not distinguish whether deficits in skilled movements by sensory
cortex lesions were caused by deficiency of bottom-up (from
spinal cord to S1) or top-down (from S1 to spinal cord) signaling,
or both, our comparative behavioral analyses with Vglut3+ IN and
CST inhibition suggest that some of the top-down sensory sig-
nals might function to smooth out the execution of complex
sequential behaviors (Figure S7).
Interestingly, recent studies revealed that activation in the
motor cortex (M2) induces firing of layer V neurons in S1 as
top-down signals and blocking this pathway causes deficits in
sensory perception (Manita et al., 2015). Therefore, signaling
from S1 to the spinal cord may be involved in sensory functions,
such as sensory perception (Manita et al., 2015) or motor adap-
tation (Mathis et al., 2017). Though it is not known how the
descending projections from the sensory cortex to the spinal
cord control particular phases of skilled movements, they may
send efferent copies to provide a predictive gating function
or act as a filtering mechanism for anticipated sensory inputs
generated by movements (Wolpert et al., 2001) (Figure S7).
Concordantly, in our experiments, sensory cortex ablation
produced dysmetric premature transitions from reaching to
grasping/retracting, which may be caused by a loss in sensory
predictive abilities. Since inhibition of Vglut3+ INs did not cause
such defects, other IN populations may mediate this function.
We also observed that Vglut3+ IN inhibition caused aberrant
grasping particularly in paw flexion timing during the pellet
grab, which was not observed in sensory cortex-lesioned
mice. This suggests that Vglut3+ INs control the grasping phase
through a CS circuit-independent manner.
The CSTs are also connected with inhibitory INs, which are
likely involved in top-down sensory modulation and gating.
For example, circuits underlying motor behaviors have a gating
system for sensory information, likely mediated by cortical
descending pathways (Moreno-Lo
´ pez et al., 2013; Seki and
Fetz, 2012; Seki et al., 2003). Recent detailed anatomical clas-
sifications in deep dorsal horn neurons demonstrate diverse
types of neurons receiving inputs from the cortex, including
several inhibitory IN populations (Abraira et al., 2017). In agree-
ment with a previous study (Russ et al., 2013), we found that
Ptf1a+ INs are connected to CSNs. Those Ptf1a+ INs are one
of the major inhibitory IN populations with presynaptic inhibitory
contacts on cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents (Betley
et al., 2009). Gad2+ inhibitory neurons (a group that includes
Ptf1a+ INs) play critical roles in ensuring smooth limb move-
ments by controlling proprioceptive transmissions in a skilled
reaching task (Fink et al., 2014). These INs might be regulated
by the CS system in a top-down manner to control sensory
information during the motor task, especially via suppressive
effects on sensory inputs (Figure S7B).
Other CSN-IN connections might also be involved in sensory-
motor integration. RORa+ INs are connected to both sensory
afferents and CS axons (Bourane et al., 2015). Similarly,
GDNF+ Clarke’s column neurons in the lumbar cord receive
inputs from both proprioceptive afferents and CS axons, and
they have long spinocerebellar projections transmitting proprio-
ceptive information (Hantman and Jessell, 2010) that could be
involved in sending predictive efferent copies of fine motor

 controls. These top-down pathways may also contribute to the
gating of sensory information and convey prediction.
More CS Subtypes and Their Potential Functions
Although we examined the connectivity of sensory and motor
CSTs, focal tracer injections revealed additional subtypes of
CSNs, which are probably formed by both genetic and activity-
dependent programs. CSNs are, therefore, likely to be classified
into many subtypes beyond those proposed in this study. For
example, the rostral population corresponding to the RFA pro-
jects axons ventromedially with bilateral projections. This resem-
bles the projection patterns of CSNs in the premotor and supple-
mentary motor areas in primates (Kuypers and Brinkman, 1970).
Inhibition of the RFA or its CSNs causes specific impairments in
grasping in rodents, which is also seen when the premotor area
is inhibited in primates (Brown and Teskey, 2014; Fogassi et al.,
2001; Wang et al., 2017).
In summary, our study reveals the connectivity between CSNs
and their target INs, and it identifies the functional significance of
these connections, thereby providing a conceptual framework to
guide future investigations into the organizational and functional
logic of motor circuits controlling skilled movements. The present
data not only highlight the neural substrates governing skilled mo-
torcontrolin the CNS but also identify thebasic neuronalarchitec-
ture required to reconstruct appropriate motor circuits, with the
goal of promoting the recovery of motor function following CNS
injuries or in treating diseases affecting motor control.

Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center) (Nakamura et al., 2006), CAG-lox-stop-lox-tdTomato (Ai14, Jackson laboratory),
CAG-lox-stop-lox-synaptophysin-tdTomato (Ai34D, Jackson laboratory), Thy1-ChR2 mice (line 18; gifted from Dr. Guoping Feng,
MIT) (Arenkiel et al., 2007) and lox-stop-lox-histone GFP-2A-TVA-2A-G mice (Bourane et al., 2015). Mice were maintained in a path-
ogen-free environment in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Research Foundation and Niigata University.
METHOD DETAILS
PRV tracing
Bartha strain PRV152 (expressing GFP; 4.9 3 109 pfu/ml) and PRV614 (expressing RFP; 3.9 3 109 pfu/ml; gifts from Dr. Lynn Enquist,
Princeton University) were used as trans-synaptic and retrograde tracers (Gu et al., 2017b; Ueno et al., 2016). Under anesthesia with
isoflurane, a skin incision was made to expose the target right forelimb muscle. PRV was injected into the muscle using a glass capil-
lary (biceps, clavotrapezius, acromiotrapezius, spinodeltoideus, triceps, palmaris longus, or extensor carpi radialis; total 5 ml).
PRV614 was used for double labeling with retrobeads (Figures 1B–1F), while PRV152 was used for other studies (Figures 1H–1N).
Skin was then sutured. Animals were kept for 4 days to label the CSNs, then mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). Brains were processed for histological analyses. To label premotor spinal interneurons, PRV614 (total 2.5 ml) was injected
into the biceps at P14, then animals were perfused 2 days later. In pilot studies, we determined that day 2 is the optimal time-point
for sacrificing mice to observe trans-synaptic PRV infection of 2nd order premotor spinal interneurons, while day 4 is best for
observing 3rd order neuron infection in the adult cerebral cortex (Gu et al., 2017b).
Retrograde tracing
CS and other brain neurons were retrogradely labeled with green retrobeads (Lumafluor) or 2% fluorogold (Fluorochrome), a fluores-
cent retrograde neuronal tracer, 1 week before the mice were sacrificed (Ueno et al., 2012). Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane,
and laminectomy was performed at vertebral level C5. They were then stabilized in a stereotaxic frame and 0.6 mL of tracer was
infused into the right side of the spinal gray matter (0.5 mm lateral, 0.5 mm depth) using a glass capillary. After infusion, muscles
and skin layers were sutured.
Anterograde tracing
Injection of anterograde tracer was performed as described previously (Ueno et al., 2012) with minor modifications. Six week-old
mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed on a stereotaxic frame. Small holes were made in the corresponding sites of in-
jections by using a 27G needle. To label the CST, BDA (MW, 10,000; Invitrogen; 10% in PBS, 0.6 ml/site; 3 injection sites for motor CST
labeling (AP 0.0, ML 1.0 mm; AP 0.5, ML 1.0 mm; AP 0.5, ML 1.5 mm); 2 injection sites for sensory CST labeling (AP 0.5, ML 2.5 mm;

Penn vector core; 0.6 ml/site; AP 0.5, ML 1.5 mm; for broad CST labeling) was injected into the left cortical hemisphere by using a
Hamilton syringe tipped with a glass micropipette (all at a depth of 0.5 mm). After the injections, the scalp was sutured.
To ensure the stringency of the method to label most of the CS fibers by AAV1-CAG-tdTomato, we compared a ratio of contact and
number of tdTomato+ CS synapses on Ptf1a+ INs, with an alternative CST marker PKCg (Russ et al., 2013; Ueno et al., 2012). Overall
the data showed similar values (ratio, 98.8 ± 1.22 versus 92.5%; synapse number, 3.78 ± 0.93 versus 3.16; AAV1-CAG-
tdTomato (n = 2) versus PKCg (n = 1)), suggesting sufficient labeling of CS fibers by AAV. In this study, we used AAV-tdTomato tracers
rather than PKCg staining, since PKCg stains relatively a less amount of CST fibers (95% of the entire CST (Russ et al., 2013)) and
cannot exclude some mixed axons of PKCg+ spinal interneurons in the dorsal horn and midline crossing CS fibers from contralateral
side of the cord (Ueno et al., 2012).
Immunohistochemistry
Animals were perfused transcardially with 4% PFA. Brains and spinal cords were dissected and post-fixed in the same fixatives over-
night at 4�C. The tissues were then cryopreserved in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound
(Sakura Finetek). Fifty mm-thick (for Figures 1, 4, and S2–S6) or 20 mm-thick serial sections (for Figures 2 and S1) were made with a
cryostat and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher).
For immunohistochemical staining, sections were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) / 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h
and then incubated with the following primary antibodies in 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS overnight at 4�C: sheep anti-GFP (1:1000; AbD
Serotec, 4745-1051), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000; Invitrogen, A11122), rat anti-GFP (1:1000; Nacalai, 04404-84), rabbit anti-RFP
(Rockland, 1:1000, 600-401-379), rabbit anti-DsRed (1:500, Clontech, 632496), rabbit anti-PKCg (1:500, Santa cruz, sc-211),
rat anti-Ctip2 (1:500, Abcam, ab18465), and mouse anti-NeuN (1:100, Millipore, MAB377) antibodies. After washing with 0.1%
Tween20 / PBS, sections were incubated with their corresponding secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 donkey
anti-sheep, rabbit, rat, or mouse anti-IgG antibodies (1:1000; Invitrogen) in 0.1% Tween20 / PBS, for 2 h at room temperature.
For BDA staining, the sections were incubated in 0.3% Triton X-100 / PBS for 4 h, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 568
streptavidin (1:400, Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. Nissl staining was performed by immersing sections in 0.1% cresyl violet
solution.
Images were acquired by using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, AXIO IMAGER Z1 or Olympus BX51) or a confocal microscope
(Nikon, A1R+).
For analyses of anatomical connection of spinal INs with the CST (for Figures 3, S2, and S3), we first prepared cervical cords
perfused with 4% PFA and post-immersed in PBS. Spinal cords were then embedded in low melting agarose, and 80 mm-thick serial
sections were made with a vibratome (Leica). Floating sections were blocked with 1% BSA / 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h and
then sections of BDA-injected samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 streptavidin in 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS (1:400, Invitro-
gen) for 3 overnights at 4�C. After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, sections were incubated with the following primary anti-
bodies for 3 overnights at 4�C: rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000; Invitrogen), rat anti-GFP (1:1000; Nacalai), rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland,
1:1000), rabbit anti-PKCg (1:500; Santa cruz), and guinea pig anti-Vglut1 antibodies (1:10000; Millipore, AB5905) in 0.1% BSA /
0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS. After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS, the sections were incubated with their corresponding second-
ary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 donkey anti-rabbit, rat IgG (1:1000; Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 647 guinea pig anti-IgG (1:1000;
Jackson ImmunoResearch) antibodies) in 0.1% BSA/ 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS, for an additional 3 overnights at 4�C. After washing,
sections were mounted on slides and images were acquired with a confocal microscope (Nikon, A1R+) or a fluorescence microscope
(Zeiss, AXIO IMAGER Z1).
Monosynaptic retrograde tracing with rabies virus
To detect presynaptic neurons that synapsed with Chx10+, Ptf1a+, or Vglut3+ spinal INs, monosynaptic retrograde tracing was per-
formed by using modified rabies virus (Osakada et al., 2011). Since Chx10+ and Vglut3+ brainstem neurons also have descending
outputs to the spinal cord (Nakamura et al., 2004) (Figures S4A–S4D), TVA and G protein expression were locally introduced into
the cervical cord by AAVs. In contrast, since Ptf1a+ INs in the brain do not have descending projections to the cervical cord (Figures
S4E–S4G), we used Ptf1a-Cre; lox-stop-lox-histone GFP-TVA-G mice. For Chx10+ and Vglut3+ INs, a P10 Chx10-Cre or Vglut3-Cre
mouse was first anesthetized with isoflurane, and a laminectomy was performed at the C4 and 6 level. AAV1-Syn-FLEX-TVA-2A-
EGFP-2A-RVG (1.4 3 1012 vg/ml; UNC Vector Core) was injected stereotaxically into the cervical cord (0.8 ml/ site; 2 sites 0.6 mm
apart rostrocaudally; 0.4 mm lateral, 0.5 mm in depth for Chx10+ INs; 0.4 mm lateral, 0.4 mm deep for Vglut3+ neurons). At P17,
the mice were again anesthetized and EnvA-coated G-deleted rabies virus expressing mCherry (EnvA-SADDG-mcherry (derived
from SAD-B19 strain); 2.0 3 108 TU/ml; gift from Dr. Edward Callaway and Gene Transfer, Targeting and Therapeutics Core (Salk
Institute)) (Osakada et al., 2011) were injected into approximately the same sites (0.8 ml/ site, 2 sites 0.6–0.8 mm apart rostrocaudally;
0.5 mm lateral, 0.4–0.5 mm in depth). Mice were perfused 7 days later and histological analyses were performed. To visualize the
synaptic connections of Ptf1a+ INs, Ptf1a-Cre; lox-stop-lox-histone GFP-2A-TVA-2A-RVG mice were injected with EnvA-SADDG-
mcherry (0.8 ml/ site, 2 sites 0.6–0.8 mm apart rostrocaudally; 0.5 mm lateral, 0.4 mm in depth) and perfused 7 days later. Postnatal
ages around 2 weeks were selected for rabies virus injection due to the greater transportation efficiency of the SAD-B19 strain in
Cell Reports 23, 1286–1300.e1–e7, May 1, 2018
e3
 postnatal mice and based on developmental stages of establishment of CS projections. Since the SAD-B19 strain has a lower retro-
grade transport capacity, especially through a long axonal tract, the number of labeled presynaptic CSNs would be underestimated.
Positional information of neurons, however, would be critical in this study.
Quantification
Plotting of CSNs on a cortical map (Figures 1 and 4)
Serial 50 mm thick coronal cortical sections were made and images of every other section were acquired with a Zeiss microscope.
The labeled cell positions in the ML and AP axes (0 at midline in ML; 0 at bregma in AP, the position where lateral ventricles begin
to be separated was determined as bregma (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001), were plotted using ImageJ software (Point picker, NIH).
We observed much fewer labeled CSNs in the cortex ipsilateral to the side of retrograde tracer injection and the sensory cortex II,
as previously reported (Ueno et al., 2012). These neurons were excluded from the analyses in this study.
Distribution of CST collaterals and presynaptic terminals in the spinal gray matter (Figure 2)
Images of 10 sections labeled with BDA, tdTomato, or Syp-tdTomato, each at the C4-5 and C6-7 levels, were acquired using a Zeiss
microscope. The distribution of axons and presynaptic puncta were plotted using ImageJ software (NIH). Their distributions were
further calculated in 0.1 mm squares, and heatmaps were generated using Graph-R software (instructed by Dr. Masachika Masujima,
National Research Institute of Fisheries Science). The value in each square was assigned into 20 divisions ordered from high to low
numbers with the squares in the highest division represented in red and the lowest in blue color. The margin of gray matter written in
each heatmap was from one representative image analyzed at the C4–5 and C6–7 levels. Images of 4 sections counterstained with
neuron-specific anti-NeuN antibody were subjected to analyses of lamina distribution by assessing areas of BDA+, tdTomato+ axons,
or presynaptic terminals in spinal laminae of Rexed I�II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X, with ImageJ software (NIH). The borders of
laminae were defined in NeuN-stained sections (Watson et al., 2009).
Spatial distribution of INs (Figure S2)
Images of GFP-labeled spinal INs at levels C4-5 and C6-7 (8-10 sections each) were acquired using a Zeiss microscope. Neuron
positions were plotted by using ImageJ software (Point picker, NIH) with xy coordinates set using the position of the central canal
as the origin (0, 0). Their distributions were further evaluated in 0.1 mm squares and demonstrated in heatmaps using Graph-R soft-
ware. The margin of gray matter presented in each heatmap was from one representative image analyzed at levels C4–5 and C6–7.
Anatomical connections of spinal INs with CST (Figures 3 and S3)
Z stack images of 80 mm thick sections were acquired by confocal microscopy and the numbers of Vglut1+ / BDA+ puncta on GFP+
cells were counted in NIS elements viewer (Nikon). Atoh1-GFP+, Vglut3-GFP+, and Chat-GFP+ INs, which have subpopulations with
different areal positions in the spinal cord, were subdivided as D (dorsal), V (ventral), and M (medial), respectively (Figures S2D, S2H,
and S2K), and calculated separately. Vglut3-GFP+ V neurons located at the ventral midline and Chat-GFP+ D neurons located in the
dorsal horn (Figure S2K) were relatively few in number, and thus excluded from the analyses. Glia-like cells in Olig3-Cre, Dbx1-Cre,
and Nkx2.2-Cre; CC-EGFP samples, which had smaller soma and bushy dendritic structures were also excluded from the analyses.
Since the existence of direct CST inputs on motor neurons is controversial in rodents and beyond the scope of this study, GFP-
labeled motor neurons located in lamina IX of Atoh1-Cre, Isl1-Cre and Chat-Cre; CC-EGFP mice were also omitted from the study.
Four to six sections in C4-5 and C6-7 levels were selected, and percentages of GFP+ cells contacted by Vglut1+ / BDA+ (or Vglut1+ /
tdTomato+) CST presynaptic terminals on cell bodies were counted. Two animals were tested, but if sufficient numbers of GFP+ neu-
rons were not detected, an additional mouse was analyzed. Since the full lengths of dendrites could not be traced confidently in GFP+
cells, Vglut1+ / BDA+ (or Vglut1+ / tdTomato+) puncta on dendrites were not assessed in this study. As CS contacts on dendrites were
excluded from the analyses, the percentages and contact synaptic numbers would underestimate CST inputs onto interneurons. The
number of neurons counted and animals used were: Atoh1+ (D; 141 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 210 cells for sensory CST, n = 2;
111 cells for whole CST, n = 2: V; 94 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 145 cells for sensory CST, n = 2; 62 cells for whole CST, n = 2),
Olig3+ (113 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 144 cells for sensory CST, n = 3; 96 cells for whole CST, n = 2), Isl1+ (241 cells for motor
CST, n = 2; 98 cells for sensory CST, n = 2; 79 cells for whole CST, n = 2), Ptf1a+ (114 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 161 cells for sensory
CST, n = 2; 85 cells for whole CST, n = 2), Lmx1b+ (142 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 196 cells for sensory CST, n = 2; 156 cells for
whole CST, n = 2), Dbx1+ (90 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 190 cells for sensory CST, n = 2; 104 cells for whole CST, n = 2), Chat+
(M; 57 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 102 cells for sensory CST, n = 2; 77 cells for whole CST, n = 2), En1+ (173 cells for motor CST,
n = 3; 102 cells for sensory CST, n = 2; 265 cells for whole CST, n = 2), Chx10+ (98 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 385 cells for sensory
CST, n = 2; 188 cells for whole CST, n = 2), Nkx2.2+ (40 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 33 cells for sensory CST, n = 2; 41 cells for whole
CST, n = 2), and Vglut3+ neurons (D; 130 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 193 cells for sensory CST, n = 2; 206 cells for whole CST, n = 2: M;
58 cells for motor CST, n = 2; 69 cells for sensory CST, n = 2; 79 cells for whole CST, n = 2).
Number of PRV+ INs in the cervical cord
Serial 50 mm thick spinal cord sections of from cervical levels C1–7 were immunostained and images were acquired of every other
transverse section using a Zeiss microscope. The number of PRV-RFP+ and GFP+ cells were then counted. Locations of the cells
were plotted by ImageJ software (Point picker, NIH). The X, Y origin (0, 0) was set to the position of the central canal. The following
numbers of animals were analyzed: Chx10-Cre; CC-EGFP, n = 4; Ptf1a-Cre; CC-EGFP, n = 3; Vglut3-Cre; CC-EGFP, n = 3.

 Area of cortical lesions and hM4Di-mCherry+ neurons
Serial 50 mm thick sections were stained and images of every other cortical section were acquired by an Olympus or Zeiss micro-
scope. Edges of lesions or hM4Di-mCherry+ neurons in layer V were plotted along an XY axis (X = 0 at the midline, and Y = 0 at
the bregma), with ImageJ software (Point picker, NIH). For the mean coordinates of lesion area, the maximum anterior, posterior,
medial, and lateral positions were selected and averaged in 3 animals.
Whole cell patch clamp recordings and optogenetic stimulation to identify CST-to-IN connections
AAV1-CAG-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry (6.0–6.69 3 1012 GC/ml, 0.4 mL / site; Penn vector core) was injected into the cerebral cortex
(0.8 mm lateral, 0 and 1.0 mm rostral, 0.4 mm depth) at P3. P14-16 cervical cords spanning levels C4–7 were then isolated in a dissec-
tion solution (250 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, and 25 mM glucose)
bubbled with 95% O2 / 5% CO2, embedded in 3% low-melting-point agarose (Invitrogen), and cut into transverse slices (300 mm)
using a Vibroslice tissue slicer (Campden Instruments). The slices were then immersed in NMDG-HEPES recovery solution
(92 mM NMDG, 2.5 mM KCl, 30 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 25 mM glucose,
5 mM sodium ascorbate, 2 mM thiourea, and 3 mM sodium pyruvate) for 20 min, and incubated in artificial CSF (125 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 25 mM glucose) for 50 min. Whole-cell patch clamp
recordings were obtained using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and data acquisition system (Digidata 1440A with pClamp 10.4 software;
Molecular Devices). Patch electrodes were filled with an intracellular solution (130 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES,
10 mM Na-phosphocreatine, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na2-GTP, pH 7.2, 295-305 mOsm) and had resistances ranging from 4–6
MU. EPSCs were evoked at a holding potential of �70 mV with a blue laser (473 nm, 400 mm in diameter; �350 mW/mm2; Opto En-
gine) applied onto the slice at 0.5 Hz. As reported in prior studies using electrical (Li and Perl, 1994) or optogenetic (Hachisuka et al.,
2016) stimulation of spinal synapses, EPSCs were classified as monosynaptic based on the ability to follow repetitive stimulation
(10 Hz in the present experiments) with both a stable onset latency (jitter < 3.5 ms in the current study) and an absence of synaptic
failures. However, given that monosynaptic connections are also potentially subject to transmission failure, it should be noted that the
above classification system likely underestimates the prevalence of monosynaptic inputs onto our sampled population.
ICMS and EMG recording
ICMS and EMG recordings were conducted as previously reported (Gu et al., 2017b). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine / xyla-
zine (100 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A region of the skull, approximately 4 mm in diameter, was
opened with a surgical drill, and the sensorimotor region of the cortex was exposed. A tungsten microelectrode (Microprobe; 1–2 mm
tip diameter) was inserted into the forelimb area of the sensorimotor cortex. ICMS was carried out with 45 ms stimuli at 333 Hz
(14 pulses), 0.2 ms biphasic; every 2 s duration, 10–100 mA by using a current stimulator (Model 2100; A-M Systems). Based on
an anatomical map of CSNs (Figures 1G–1N), stimulation sites were decided as AP 0.5 mm, ML 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 mm,
and AP 1.0 mm, ML 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 mm. For EMGs, electrical responses of the biceps muscle contralateral to the cortical
stimulation site were detected by inserting percutaneous Ni-chrome wire electrodes (deinsulated 1 mm from the tip). EMG was
recorded with a differential AC amplifier with low- and high-pass filtration (Model 1700; A-M Systems), and signals were acquired
using an analog-to-digital converter (CED) and processed using Signal software (version 6.03; CED). The lowest current that
produced an EMG response was defined as the threshold. The amplitudes of EMG responses by ICMS at threshold currents
were calculated as mV 3 ms.
Optogenetic cortical stimulation and EMG recording
Thy1-ChR2 mice (line 18) (Arenkiel et al., 2007) were used to stimulate layer V neurons (Ayling et al., 2009). Optical stimulation and
EMG recordings were conducted under anesthesia with ketamine / xylazine (100 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). The skull was opened with a
surgical drill (approximately 4 mm in diameter centered at AP 0, ML 2.0 mm) and the sensorimotor region of the cortex was exposed.
A blue laser (477 nm, 400 mm in diameter, Opto Engine) was applied onto positions where motor and sensory CSNs are located
(ML 0.5–3.0 mm, AP 0.5 and 1.0; Figures 1G–1N). To find the threshold laser intensities required to evoke EMG responses, 10 ms
duration light pulses at 0.5 Hz were applied with incremental increases in laser intensity (changing by 0.1 dial scales of the laser).
The amplitude of the laser at each dial position was measured by an optical power meter (Thorlabs) after each experiment.
We recorded EMG responses of the biceps muscle using 50 mm-diameter Teflon-coated tungsten wires (A-M systems; deinsulated
1 mm from the tip) with a separate ground, in response to stimulation of layer V neurons. Responses were recorded with a Multiclamp
700B amplifier with low- and high-pass filtration and data acquisition system (Digidata 1440A with pClamp 10 software; Molecular
Devices). The lowest current that produced an EMG response was defined as a threshold.
To test the involvement of Chx10+ spinal interneurons in CS–muscle circuits, Thy1-ChR2 mice and Thy1-ChR2; Chx10-Cre mice
were first injected with AAV8-Syn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry; 6.4 3 1012 vg/ml; UNC Vector Core)
into 4 spots at C4–7 (0.8 mL for each spot, 0.4 mm lateral, 0.5 mm depth, 0.6–0.8 mm rostrocaudal distance, right side) at P14. Optical
stimulation and EMG recordings were then performed at 8�weeks old. Following stimulation and recording under control conditions
as described above, CNO (5.0 mg/kg body weight, i.p.; Sigma) was injected and a second set of stimulation and recording was con-
ducted 30 min later. In pilot experiments, we noticed that long duration experiments (with 30 min of waiting time post-injection)
increased the arousal status in mice. To shorten the duration of each experiment, stimulated spots were restricted to 4 locations,
Cell Reports 23, 1286–1300.e1–e7, May 1, 2018
e5
 where strong EMG responses were observed in control experiments (AP 0.5 and 1.0 mm, ML 1.5 and 2.0 mm; Figures 6E–6G). One
tenth of a dose of ketamine / xylazine was additionally injected 7 min after CNO injections, which kept the mice in appropriate anes-
thetic condition during the subsequent recordings.
Single-pellet reaching test
The single-pellet reaching test was performed as previously reported (Gu et al., 2017b) with some modifications. Five weeks-old mice
were food-restricted to maintain 90% of their free feeding weight before the training. The training chamber was made with a clear
Plexiglas with 0.5 cm wide slits on the left, center, and right sides of the front wall. Millet seeds were placed in front of the slit for
mice to reach, grasp, and retrieve through the slit. A one week training period was determined by pilot studies, in which success rates
of the test reached a plateau within 1 week in most of the mice. During the initial 3 days of training, we placed the seeds in front of the
center slit and allowed mice to make approximately 50 reach attempts per day to learn the test. Their preferred forelimb was deter-
mined at that time. The seeds were then placed in front of the left or right slit based on their preferred paw, and we recorded 20 rea-
ches per day for 4 more days. The success rates of the test were then assessed. When the mouse successfully retrieved the seed and
put it into its mouth, the attempt was considered a success.
During the reaching test, �14 videos of 14.0 s duration were acquired with two high-speed digital cameras (200 fps, Grasshopper,
Point Grey), placed diagonally behind and in front of the test slit. The KinemaTracer system was used to acquire and analyze videos,
and the quality of each reach attempt (typically 10�30 reaches) was assessed using Whishaw’s score of reaching with some mod-
ifications (Whishaw, 1996). Each reaching task was subdivided into 10 components of motion, and abnormalities in each motion were
qualified in frame-by-frame analyses of the video (Figure S6C). The 10 behavioral components in a typical reach attempt were defined
as follows. (1) Limb lift: the reaching limb is lifted from the floor and targeted to the slit. (2) Digits close: as the limb is lifted, the digits
are flexed. (3) Aim: during the upper arm movement, the elbow is adducted to the midline while the forearm is aligned along the
midline. (4) Advance: the limb is advanced in a forward direction through the slit to the target pellet. (5) Digits extend: the digits
are extended and opened during the advance. (6) Pronation: the elbow is abducted and the paw pronates when the paw is over
the target. (7) Grasp: as the palm or digits touch the pellet, the digits flex over the pellet and grasp it. (8) Supination I: as the paw
is withdrawn, it supinates in almost 90� through wrist movement and adduction of the elbow. (9) Supination II: once the paw is with-
drawn from the slit, the paw is further supinated to present the food to the mouth. (10) Food release: the digits are opened to release
the pellet to the mouth. Each component was given a score in a 3 points scale, where 0 represented movement appeared normal,
1 represented cases where the movement was incomplete or slightly abnormal, and 2 referred to movements that were either absent
or replaced by other compensatory movements. When an observer felt ambiguity in scoring, an intermediate score (0.5) was given.
To ensure objective scoring, we created a sub-scoring system in movements (1) Limb lift, (4) Advance, and (7) Grasp. (1) Limb lift was
sub-classified into (1-1) Existence of lift (0, present; 1, incomplete or slightly abnormal; 2, absent), (1-2) Initiation (0, smooth; 1, rotating
once; 1.5, rotating twice or more), (1-3) Advance (0, smooth; 1, rotating once; 1.5, rotating twice or more), (1-4) Target to the slit
(0, smooth; 1, stop at the slit; 1.5, stop in front of the slit or hit the wall), and the highest score among them was given in (1) Limb
lift. (4) Advance was subdivided into (4-1) Existence of advance (0, present; 1, incomplete or slightly abnormal; 2, absent), (4-2) Vi-
bration I (0, smooth; 1, slightly move horizontally; 1.5, move horizontally), (4-3) Vibration II (0, smooth; 1, stopped slightly during move-
ment; 1.5, stopped and retracted during advance), (4-4) Reach direction I (0, toward the pellet; 1, slightly misdirected horizontally;
1.5, misdirected horizontally), (4-5) Reach direction II (0, toward the pellet; 1, slightly misdirected upward; 1.5, misdirected upward),
(4-6) Reach distance (0, normal; 1, short; 1.5, very short), (4-7) Reach distance (0, normal; 1, slightly long beyond the pellet; 1.5, long),
and the highest score among them was assigned to (4) Advance. (7) Grasp was subdivided into (7-1) Existence of grasp (0, present;
1, incomplete or slightly abnormal; 2, absent), (7-2) Timing I (0, smooth; 1, slightly late in grasping when touching the pellet; 1.5, late in
grasping), (7-3) Timing II (0, smooth; 1, slightly early in grasping before touching the pellet; 1.5, early in grasping) (7-4) Digits coupling
(0, appeared normal; 1, slightly uncoupled; 1.5, uncoupled), and the highest score was given to (7) Grasp. Because we realized that
precise assessment of (3) Aim required video-recordings from the midline and bottom directions, we excluded the evaluation of this
component from the study.
The releasing time of food was assessed when the reach attempts were successful. Once mice successfully grabbed the seed,
they typically brought it through the slit ((8) Supination I) toward their mouths ((9) Supination II), bit the seed, and quickly released
their paw to adjust the position (Figure 7V). The time from biting to adjusting their paw was defined as the releasing time of food
(Figure 7W).
DREADD experiment
For Chx10-Cre, Vglut3-Cre and control C57BL/6J mice, AAV8-Syn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry (4.6–6.7 3 1012 vg/ml; UNC Vector Core)
was injected into the cervical spinal cords of P14 mice at 4 locations all within levels C4–7 (0.8 mL / location, 0.4 mm lateral,
0.5 mm depth for Chx10-Cre and control, 0.4 mm depth for Vglut3-Cre, 0.6–0.8 mm rostrocaudal distance, right side). Training
of single-pellet reaching test was started at 5 weeks of age for 1 week, and only right-handed mice were used for the following
experiment. At 8 weeks of age, reaching tests were again conducted for 3 days. On the last test day, reaching tests were done before
and 30 min after CNO injections (5.0 mg/kg body weight, i.p.; Sigma).
For Rbp4-Cre mice, reaching test training was also started at 5 weeks of age for 1 week. Then, AAV8-Syn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry
(4.6–6.7 3 1012 vg/ml; UNC Vector Core) was injected into the cortex at 6 weeks of age (0.6 ml/site, AP 0 mm, ML 1.5 mm,

 0.5 mm in depth). The virus was injected into the contralateral cortical side of the preferred forelimb. hM4Di-mcherry was introduced
broadly in layer V neurons of medial and lateral cortical areas (ML 0.37 ± 0.07 – 2.56 ± 0.17 mm, AP 1.50 ± 0.25 – �1.53 ± 0.27 mm,
n = 3, Figures S6K and S6L). Most of the hM4Di-mcherry+ neurons were positive for layer V marker Ctip2 (94.36%), and 85.98% of
CSNs retrogradely labeled with retrobeads were also hM4Di-mcherry+ (Figure S6M). Two weeks later, the tests were again con-
ducted for 3 days. On the last day, reaching tests were done before and 30 min after CNO injections (5.0 mg/kg body weight, i.p.).
Photothrombotic stroke
Male C57BL/6J mice were trained with single-pellet reaching test for 1 week, started at 5 weeks of age. At 8 weeks of age, reaching
tests were again conducted for 3 days. Mice were subsequently subjected to a focal cortical lesion in the medial or lateral cortex by
using a photothrombotic stroke model (Labat-gest and Tomasi, 2013). We selected this lesion model because of its focal accessibility
by light without the tissue damage caused by craniotomies. Mice were placed on a stereotaxic frame under anesthesia with isoflur-
ane, and the skull was exposed with a midline incision of the scalp. A small piece of foil with a square opening targeting the lesion site
was attached on the skull (ML 1.0–2.0 mm, AP �1.0–1.0 mm in square for medial cortex lesion; first exposure in ML 2.25–3.25 mm,
AP 0.0–1.5 mm square and second in ML 2.25–3.25 mm, AP �1.5–0.0 mm, for lateral cortical lesion). Rose bengal solution (5 mg/ml in
saline, 50 mg/kg BW, i.p.) was then injected. Five minutes later, light from a cold light source (KL1500 LCD, Zeiss) was applied to the
exposed area of the skull for 15 min for a medial lesion, or for 12 min + 12 min (anterior and posterior parts, respectively) for lateral
lesions. After the illumination treatment, the scalp was sutured. Reaching tests were again conducted 7 days later.
Pyramidotomy
Five week-old male C57BL/6J mice were trained for the single-pellet reaching test for 1 week, then at 8 weeks of age, reaching tests
were again conducted for an additional 3 days. A CST transection was then performed with a lateral hemisection of the pyramid in the
medulla oblongata (pyramidotomy) (Starkey et al., 2005; Ueno et al., 2012). For the pyramidotomy, the animals were anaesthetized
with isoflurane, placed on their backs, and the skin of the ventral midline between the forelimbs and jaw was incised. The esophagus,
trachea, and muscles were displaced, the ventrocaudal side of the occipital bone was targeted, and the medullary pyramid was
exposed. The dura was first cut, and the pyramidal tract in the contralateral side of the preferred forelimb was transected with a
30-gauge needle and a surgical knife with a width of 0.5 mm and a depth of 0.25 mm. The esophagus, trachea, and muscles
were returned to their original locations and configurations, and the skin was sutured. Reaching tests were again conducted
7 days later.
Kinematic analyses
Kinematic features of forelimb during reaching behaviors were assessed with high-speed cameras and a KinemaTracer system
(Kissei Comtec) (Ueno and Yamashita, 2011). In this system, three-dimensional video recordings were made with two high-speed
digital cameras (200 fps, Grasshopper, Point Grey) placed diagonally behind and front of the test slit, to trace and analyze wrist
movements during each behavior. Recordings were acquired by the KinemaTracer software, and the movements of the back of
the paw were traced manually to determine their coordinates. Before each session, the precise coordinates were calibrated by
recording a cube of known size [5 3 10 3 10 cm (x 3 y 3 z)]. The far distal positions of the reaching paw at the time that grasping
was initiated were plotted and relative positions to the pellet were analyzed in the x-y-z axis. Then their spatial probabilities were
represented in heatmaps (bottom panels in Figures 7P–7T and S6P–S6T). For left-handed mice, the coordinates of x axis were
multiplied by –1.0 so that the inner side of the body was set to the left side of the figure. Since frame by frame analyses of motion
components revealed abnormalities in the advancement step in experimental groups involving lesions of the medial cortex and
inhibition of Chx10+ neurons, various parameters (velocity (cm/s), acceleration (cm/s2), xyz coordinates (cm), etc.) were compared
in 6 representative reaches (3 success + 3 missed reaches) in each control or treated mouse. Average values of acceleration (cm/s2)
between the periods showing minimum and maximum velocities through the slit toward the seed (advancement step) were obtained
(Figure 7U).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All statistical details are described in figure legends. Quantitative data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were
performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). Differences among groups were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s test or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s test. Differences among matched groups were statistically
analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. Normality and equality of variances among the groups were
analyzed with D’Agostino-Pearson normality test and Brown-Forsythe test, respectively. Differences between paired groups
were analyzed with paired t test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Normality was analyzed with D’Agostino-Pearson
normality test or Shapiro-Wilk normality test. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
