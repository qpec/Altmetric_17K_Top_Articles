ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine if breast arterial calcification (BAC) on digital mammography predicts
coronary artery calcification (CAC).
BACKGROUND BAC is frequently noted but the quantitative relationships to CAC and risk factors are unknown.
METHODS A total of 292 women with digital mammography and nongated computed tomography was evaluated.
BAC was quantitatively evaluated (0 to 12) and CAC was measured on computed tomography using a 0 to 12 score;
they were correlated with each other and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and the 2013 Cholesterol Guidelines Pooled
Cohort Equations (PCE).
RESULTS BAC was noted in 42.5% and was associated with increasing age (p < 0.0001), hypertension (p ¼ 0.0007),
and chronic kidney disease (p < 0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy
of BAC >0 for CAC >0 were 63%, 76%, 70%, 69%, and 70%, respectively. All BAC variables were predictive of the CAC
score (p < 0.0001). The multivariable odds ratio for CAC >0 was 3.2 for BAC 4 to 12, 2.0 for age, and 2.2 for hyper-
tension. The agreements of FRS risk categories with CAC and BAC risk categories were 57% for CAC and 55% for BAC; the
agreement was 47% for PCE risk categories for CAC and 54% by BAC. BAC >0 had area under the curve of 0.73 for
identification of women with CAC >0, equivalent to both FRS (0.72) and PCE (0.71). BAC >0 increased the area under the
curve curves for FRS (0.72 to 0.77; p ¼ 0.15) and PCE (0.71 to 0.76; p ¼ 0.11) for the identification of high-risk (4 to 12)
CAC. With the inclusion of 33 women with established CAD, BAC >0 was significantly additive to both FRS (p ¼ 0.02) and
PCE (p ¼ 0.04) for high-risk CAC.
CONCLUSIONS There is a strong quantitative association of BAC with CAC. BAC is superior to standard cardiovascular
risk factors. BAC is equivalent to both the FRS and PCE for the identification of high-risk women and is additive when
women with established CAD are included. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2016;9:350–60) © 2016 by the American College of

reast cancer and cardiovascular disease affect
millions of women; cardiovascular disease is
the leading cause of mortality (1) and breast
cancer is the most feared disease (2). Women are
commonly screened for breast cancer with mammog-
raphy; 47.5% of women between 40 and 49 and 57.2%
of women between 50 and 74 had mammograms
in 2011 (3). However, there is no routine screening
for coronary artery disease (CAD). Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of breast arterial calcification
(BAC) has been correlated with CAD (3–14) and with
the presence or absence of coronary artery calcium
(CAC) in a limited number of studies (7–9,14). This
study was designed to quantitatively evaluate the
relationship between BAC on digital mammography
and
CAC
on
noncontrast
computed
tomography
(CT) scans, and their correlation with the Framing-
ham Risk Score (FRS) (15) and the 2013 Cholesterol
Guidelines Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) (16). A sig-
nificant relationship would provide the opportunity

 for large-scale cardiac risk assessment of peri- and
post-menopausal women undergoing mammography
without additional cost and radiation exposure.
METHODS
Institutional review board approval was obtained for
this HIPAA-compliant study and informed consent
was waived. A search of the radiology department
database was made for all women who had mammo-
grams and noncontrast CT scans of the chest for
routine clinical indications, and complete risk factor
information, within 1 year of each other during the
years of 2011 to 2013. A total of 325 asymptomatic
women were identified; 33 had established CAD by
chart review and were excluded from further anal-
ysis,
leaving
292
subjects
for
primary
analysis.
Selected analyses of the entire cohort of 325 patients
are provided in Online Figure 1 and Online Table 1.
CT
SCAN. Chest CT scans were acquired on the
following scanners: GE VCT 64 slice (General Electric
Medical
Systems,
Milwaukee,
Wisconsin);
and
Siemens Somatom Definition AS-40 slice, Siemens

Cardiac
(Siemens

mA varying according to the patient size.
A chest radiologist with more than 20 years of
experience measured the ordinal CAC score as previ-
ously described (17). Each of the 4 main coronary ar-
teries
was
identified
(left
main,
left
anterior
descending, circumflex, and right) and the extent of
CAC in each artery was categorized as being absent,
mild, moderate, or severe and scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3,
respectively. The extent of CAC was classified as mild
when less than one-third of the length of the entire
artery showed calcification, moderate when one-third
to two-thirds of the artery showed calcification, and
severe when more than two-thirds of the artery
showed calcification. With 4 arteries thus scored,
each participant received a score from 0 to 12. The
CAC
scores
were
divided
into
3
categories
of
increasing severity: 0, 1 to 3, and 4 to 12, which have
been shown to be strongly predictive of cardiac out-
comes in a long-term follow-up of 8,782 patients (17).
DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY. Standard full-field digital
mammograms were acquired in the craniocaudal and
mediolateral oblique positions on either a GE Essen-
tials Unit General Electric (Buc, France) or Hologic
Dimensions Unit (Bedford, Massachusetts). A second
radiologist with more than 20 years of experience in
mammography, blinded to the CAC results, reviewed
the mammograms of the 325 women. All
mammograms were reviewed on standard 5
megapixel
mammography
monitors.
All
standard tools including magnification and
inversion were available for use at the radi-
ologist’s discretion. For those women with
BAC, the number of vessels involved in each
breast was recorded and numerically coded
as 1 to 6; if there were more than 6 BAC, then
6 was coded. The longest length of vessel
involvement was recorded as none (scored as
0), less than one-third (scored as 1), between
one-third and two-thirds (scored as 2), and
greater than two-thirds (scored as 3). The
density
of
calcium
in
the
most
severely
affected
segment
was
recorded
as
none
(scored as 0), mild with clear visualization of
the lumen and/or only 1 vessel wall involved (scored
as 1), moderate with clouding of the lumen and
calcification of both tangential walls (scored as 2), and
severe with no visible lumen (scored as 3) (Figure 1).
Thus each woman received an ordinal BAC score be-
tween 0 and 12 after summing up these 3 numbers for
each breast. As with the CAC score, the BAC results
were divided into 3 categories of increasing severity:
0, 1 to 3, and 4 to 12.
RISK FACTORS. Risk factor history was obtained for
all patients based on chart review and the 10-year FRS
and
PCE
scores
were
calculated.
The
FRS
were
divided into the conventional low (<10%), interme-
diate (10% to 20%), and high (>20%) risk categories.
The PCE were classified as <5% (statins not needed),
5% to 7.4% (reasonable to offer moderate intensity
statins), and $7.5% (should be treated with moderate/
high intensity statins).
STATISTICS. All statistical analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.2 (Statistical Analysis System,
Cary, North Carolina). Frequencies and descriptive
statistics were obtained for all the variables. Quanti-
tative data were compared using chi-square tests,
Fisher
exact tests, and Student
t
tests.
Logistic
regression analysis was used to address the relation-
ship of the prevalence and extent of CAC to BAC
findings while adjusting for the other available risk
factor of age. The age categories in years were <60, 60
to 69, and $70. The extent of CAC was analyzed for
the 3 CAC categories and their relationship to the 3
BAC categories using polytomous logistic regression
analysis. The dose-response relationship of CAC on
the BAC score (using both linear and quadratic terms)
was analyzed using regression analysis and the F
statistic was used to test the significance of the linear
and quadratic terms. Logistic regression analysis was

 used to address the relationship of BAC to CAC while
adjusting for the standard risk factors of age, sex,
diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and hy-
pertension as reported on a background question-
naire. The extent of CAC was analyzed for the
3 categories of CAC (0, 1 to 3, 4 to 12) using ordered
logistic regression analysis adjusting for the other risk
factors of CAC. Discrimination for the outcomes of
any CAC (CAC score exceeding 0) or moderate CAC
(CAC score $4) was examined using receiver-oper-
ating characteristic
(ROC)
curves.
The
respective
C-statistics generated with Framingham risk factors,
Pooled Cohort Risk Equation, and BAC were sepa-
rately calculated and compared among each other.
In addition, the incremental change in the C-statistic
from the addition of BAC to either Framingham or
Pooled Cohort Risk Predictions was calculated.
RESULTS
DEMOGRAPHICS. BAC was found in 42.5% of the
population
(Table
1).
BAC-positive
patients
were
significantly older than BAC-negative patients (p <
0.0001), had more hypertension (p ¼ 0.0007) and
chronic kidney disease (p < 0.0001), and were less
often smokers (p < 0.009). There were no significant
differences in the incidence of hyperlipidemia and
diabetes mellitus. CAC was noted in 47.6% of the total
group. CAC-positive patients were significantly older
than CAC-negative subjects (p < 0.0001), and had more
hypertension (p < 0.0001), chronic kidney disease
(p < 0.001), and diabetes (p ¼ 0.01); there were no dif-
ferences in hyperlipidemia and smoking. Indications
for CT scanning were pulmonary nodule (39%), lung
cancer screening (10%), interstitial lung disease (9%),
dyspnea (9%), abnormal study follow-up (8%), other
cancer (8%), infection (6%), obstructive lung disease
(6%), lung cancer (4%), and miscellaneous (1%).
BAC AND CAC SCORE DISTRIBUTIONS. The mean
BAC score was 2.2 � 2.9 (median 0.0; interquartile
range [IQR]: 0.0 to 4.0) (Table 2). The frequency of
BAC >0 was 27% for women younger than 60 (39 to 59
years of age), increasing to 47% for women 60 to 69
years of age, and to 69% for women 70 to 92 years of
age (p < 0.0001). The mean CAC score was 1.6 � 2.5
(median 0.0; IQR: 0.0 to 2.0). For the 3 age categories,
the presence of CAC increased from 28% to 55% to
79% (p < 0.0001). The frequency distributions of the
number of calcified breast arteries, maximum length
of the vascular calcifications, and maximum density
of the calcifications for the 3 age categories rose with
increasing age (p < 0.0001) as well.

OF
BAC
AND
CAC
SCORES. The
sensitivity,
specificity,
positive
predictive
value,
negative predictive value, and accuracy of BAC >0 for
the presence of CAC >0 were 63%, 76%, 70%, 69%,
and 70%, respectively (Table 3). Sensitivity increased
from 50% to 75% and specificity decreased from 83%

 to 53% with increasing age. In a similar manner, the
positive predictive value increased from 53% to 86 %
and the negative predictive value decreased from 81%
to 36% with increasing age (Table 3). The CAC burden
in patients with and without BAC by age distribution
is shown in Figure 2, revealing the increasing fre-
quency of both BAC and CAC with increasing age and
the increasing percentages of higher CAC in those
with BAC in each age group. The relationships of the
BAC score and the individual BAC findings to the CAC
score are displayed by categories in Table 4 and were
all highly significant (p < 0.0001). The agreement
between BAC and CAC scores was also highly signifi-
cant (p < 0.0001; kappa ¼ 0.26; weighted kappa ¼
0.33). In 76% of the 0 CAC patients, the BAC was also
0; 10% had BAC of 1 to 3 and 14% were 4 to 12. In the
intermediate 1 to 3 CAC category, the BAC was fairly
evenly distributed. In the high-risk 4 to 12 CAC
group, 56% were high risk on BAC; 17% had 1 to 3
BAC and 27% had 0 BAC. The individual BAC vari-
ables were all significantly predictive of the CAC
score (p < 0.0001). Unadjusted and adjusted odds
ratios (ORs) of BAC, age, hypertension, hyperlipid-
emia, smoking, and diabetes mellitus for having CAC
>0 are shown in Table 5. In the unadjusted model,
BAC 4 to 12, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
and
chronic
kidney
disease
were
significant.
In
the multivariable model, only BAC 4 to 12 (OR: 3.2),
age
(OR:
2.0),
and
hypertension
(OR:
2.2)
were
significant.
COMPARISON WITH FRS. The mean 10-year FRS was
4.6
� 4.7%
(median
3.0%;
IQR:
0.0%
to
6.0%)
(Table 6). Most (84.6%) were low risk (<10% FRS);
59% had 0 BAC and 63% had 0 CAC. However, 15%
had intermediate BAC of 1 to 3 and 22% had high-
risk BAC of 4 to 12; 29% had intermediate CAC of
1 to 3 and 13% had high-risk CAC of 4 to 12. In the
small (14.4%) intermediate FRS risk group (10% to
20%), 45% and 12% were intermediate risk by CAC
and BAC, respectively, and 36% and 64% were high
risk by CAC and BAC, respectively. Zero CAC and
BAC were present in 19% and 24%, respectively.
Only 0.6% (3 patients) were high FRS risk (>20%); 2
were high risk by CAC and 1 by BAC. For the entire
patient cohort, the agreements of FRS risk cate-
gories with CAC and BAC risk categories were only
57% for CAC and 55% for BAC.
BAC and FRS were equivalent for the identification
of women with CAC >0 and CAC 4 to 12; the area
under the curve (AUC) was 0.73 and 0.72 (p ¼ 0.83),
respectively, for both CAC >0 and CAC 4 to 12. The
addition of BAC >0 to the FRS increased the area
under the ROC curve for CAC 4 to 12 of 0.72 for FRS to
0.77 but this was not statistically significant (p ¼ 0.15)
(Table 7, Figure 3). Similarly, for the identification of
women with CAC >0, BAC >0 increased the area un-
der the ROC curve for FRS from 0.72 to 0.76 (p ¼ 0.16).
Analysis of the 325-patient cohort, including the 33
with established CAD, revealed significant additive
value of BAC >0 to FRS for the identification of
women with CAC 4 to 12 (AUC: 0.68 vs. 0.76; p ¼ 0.02)
and with CAC >0 (AUC: 0.72 to 0.77; p ¼ 0.02).
All
other
analyses
were
unchanged
from
the
292-patient cohort.
COMPARISON WITH PCE. The mean PCE risk was
11.8 � 12.5% (median 7.2%; IQR: 2.6% to 16.9%) (Ta-
ble 8). In sharp contrast to the FRS, only 42% were in
the lowest risk category, 9.2% were intermediate, and
49%
were
in
the
$7.5%
high-intensity
statin-
requiring group. In the low-risk (<5%) category, 74%
and 76% had 0 CAC and 0 BAC, respectively. How-
ever, in the high-risk (>7.5%) category, only 27% were
high risk by CAC and 43% by BAC; 33% and 40% had
0 CAC and 0 BAC, respectively. In the intermediate-
risk (5% to 7.4%) group, only 33% of CAC and 15% of
BAC had intermediate risk scores of 1 to 3. For the
entire patient cohort, the agreements of PCE risk
categories with CAC and BAC risk categories were
only 47% for CAC and 54% for BAC.

 BAC and PCE were equivalent for the identification
of women with CAC >0 and CAC 4 to 12; the AUC was
0.73 and 0.71 (p ¼ 0.66), respectively, for both CAC
>0 and CAC 4 to 12. The addition of BAC >0 to the PCE
increased the area under the ROC curve for CAC 4 to
12 of 0.71 for PCE to 0.76 (p ¼ 0.11) (Table 7, Figure 3).
The addition of BAC to PCE for the identification of
women with CAC >0 was of borderline significance;
AUC increased from 0.71 to 0.76 (p ¼ 0.08). Analysis
of the 325-patient cohort, including the 33 with
established CAD, revealed significant additive value
of BAC >0 to PCE for the identification of women
with CAC 4 to 12 (AUC: 0.70 vs. 0.76; p ¼ 0.04). All
other analyses were unchanged from the 292-patient
cohort.
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to demonstrate the strong
quantitative association of BAC by digital mammog-
raphy with CAC in a large female cohort, its superi-
ority
to
individual
standard
cardiovascular
risk
factors, and its equivalence to the risk factor–based
paradigms for the identification of women with CAC,
with borderline additive value to the PCE.
PRIOR REPORTS. There are few studies comparing
BAC with CAC. In 2003, Pecchi et al. (7) semi-
quantitatively compared BAC with CAC in 74 post-
menopausal women and found a strong correlation
(0.55 to 0.89 after risk factor adjustment); digital
mammography was not used. In 2007, Maas et al. (8)
reported a significant association of any BAC with
subsequent
CAC
after
9
years
of
follow-up
in
499 women (OR: 3.1); neither the CAC nor BAC were
quantified. Matsumura et al. (9), in 2013, evaluated
98 women with BAC and 104 women without BAC
with CT and found that BAC was an independent
predictor of CAC with an OR of >22; those with
Agatston CAC scores of >400 were more likely to have
BAC (p ¼ 0.006). BAC continued to be associated with
Agatston scores of >400 when adjusted for age, dia-
betes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and family history
(9). Only Agatston scores >400 were considered to be
CAC-positive
and
their
results,
therefore,
are
of
limited value.
Many more reports have evaluated the relationship
between BAC and variably defined CAD in general.
In a 2013 review of data from 25 studies and 35,542
patients (10), 19 studies examined the relationship
between BAC and cardiovascular disease, 13 of which

 reported a statistically significant association of BAC
and CAD; an additional 2 reported that the correlation
was only significant when CAD $50% stenosis was
present. The adjusted ORs were 1.87 to 8.13 for the
relationship between BAC and variably defined CAD,
ranging from angiographically proven CAD to patient
self-reporting. In the most recent review (11), with a
meta-analysis
of
63
studies
chosen
after
critical
appraisal, the adjusted hazard ratios for coronary
disease ranged from 1.32 (95% confidence interval
[CI]: 1.08 to 1.60) to 1.44 (95% CI: 1.02 to 2.05). The
overall
prevalence
of
BAC
was
12.7%.
Diabetes
mellitus (pooled OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.36 to 2.59), parity
as opposed to nulliparity (pooled OR: 3.43; 95% CI:
2.23 to 5.27), and age (pooled OR: 2.98; 95% CI: 2.31 to
3.85 for every 10 years) were associated with an
increased prevalence of BAC. There was no significant
relationship to dyslipidemia, obesity, and hyperten-
sion; smoking had a lower BAC prevalence (pooled
OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.60).
Several studies in symptomatic women undergoing
either invasive coronary angiography or coronary CT
angiography have found no association between BAC
and CAD. In 172 women referred for coronary angi-
ography, no significant correlation was found be-
tween BAC and the degree of coronary stenosis (12).
Obstructive

in
94 symptomatic women did not correlate with the
presence or absence of BAC (13). In 150 patients with
suspected CAD, there was no correlation between
BAC and either CAC or degree of stenosis in coronary

 CT angiography (p ¼ 0.09) (14). However, this was a
symptomatic population; greater numbers may have
yielded significant results.
The use of digital mammography in the current
study may explain the significantly higher prevalence
of BAC compared with prior reports: 45.5% versus
12.7% in the largest meta-analysis (11). As of March
2015, 96% of the mammography units in the United
States were digital (18) and are therefore very sensi-
tive to the presence of calcification. There are not
sufficient details provided in prior studies to assess
the mammography technique or differences in pa-
tient populations that would clearly explain their
lower prevalence.
QUANTITATIVE
RELATIONSHIPS. The data clearly
demonstrate that BAC was significantly and quanti-
tatively associated with CAC. Moreover, it was supe-
rior to conventional risk factors; in a multivariate
analysis adjusted for all risk factors including age,
the OR for BAC 4 to 12 was 3.2 compared with BAC
0 (Table 5). In addition to the significant association
of the total BAC score, each of the 3 components of
the BAC score was quantitatively related to CAC
(Table 2). A significant relationship was present for
age and hypertension in multivariate analysis, and
for diabetes and chronic kidney disease in univariate
analysis alone; there were no significant associations
for smoking and hyperlipidemia.

 CONVENTIONAL RISK SCORES AND AREA UNDER
THE ROC CURVE. The relatively poor agreement of
BAC and CAC risk categories with the FRS and PCE
risk categories parallels the generally poor correlation
of calcified plaque with risk factor–based algorithms.
The striking difference between the mean FRS (5.0%)
and PCE (12.6%) 10-year CAD risk assessments reflects
the well-described overestimation of risk, particularly
in women, that has marred the acceptance of the PCE
(19,20). Of critical importance is the equivalence of
BAC to both risk factor–based paradigms for the
identification of women with CAC, with borderline
additive value to PCE. The substantial differences in
AUC for additive value (0.72 to 0.77 for FRS, and 0.71
to 0.76 for PCE) may have been significant in a larger
cohort including patients with a higher likelihood of
disease, as suggested by the significant additive value
to both FRS and PCE in the 325-patient cohort that
included 33 patients with established CAD by chart
review (Online Figure 1, Online Table 1). There are no
other diagnostic tests (21) or inflammatory markers,
such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (22), that
are comparable or additive to standard risk factor–
based estimates.
MECHANISMS. It is important to realize that the lo-
cations of BAC and CAC are different. BAC is a
manifestation of Mönckeberg arteriosclerosis, and as
indicated by its alternative name, calcific medial
sclerosis, is medial in location, as opposed to the
intimal
location
of
CAC
(23,24).
The
mammary
arteries are branches of the posterior intercostal
arteries, the lateral thoracic and thoracoacromial ar-
teries,
and
perforating
branches
of
the
internal
mammary arteries; these arteries are thought not to
be susceptible to conventional atherosclerosis. There
are some shared associations with risk factors. Prior
studies have demonstrated significant consistent as-
sociations for age, diabetes, chronic kidney disease,
and multiparity, but there are no relationships of BAC
to the conventional CAC risk factors of hyperlipid-
emia and smoking and a variable relationship to
hypertension (4–14). In the current study (Table 1),
BAC was significantly more prevalent in older pa-
tients and those with hypertension and those with
chronic kidney disease but not with hyperlipidemia
and diabetes, and was less prevalent in smokers.
Increased arterial stiffness from medial calcification
may increase risk, but the shared risk factors dis-
cussed previously provide the most likely explana-
tion for the highly significant correlation of BAC and
CAC, which requires further investigation. The OR of
3.2 for BAC 4 to 12 independent of age indicates that
the association with CAC is more than just the aging
process.
ORDINAL CAC AND BAC SCORING. The validity of
this paper is based on comparison of BAC with CAC
ordinal scores derived from nongated CT angiography
scans,
rather
than
conventional
Agatston
scored
gated scans. The prognostic power of ordinal CAC has
been confirmed (17,25), as has the strong correlation
between gated and nongated Agatston scores (26) and
between ordinal scores and nongated Agatston scores
(27). On the basis of the previously mentioned data,
an ordinal CAC of 4 to 12 was designated as high risk
similar to Agatston CAC >400 and an ordinal CAC of
0 was designated as low risk equating to Agatston
0 CAC, with ordinal CAC of 1 to 3 classified as inter-
mediate risk.
The ordinal BAC score was devised to reflect
increasing severity and arbitrarily scaled 0 to 12 to
conform to the CAC ordinal scale. The highly signifi-
cant correlation of increasing BAC with increasing
CAC validates its structure.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE. This study strongly suggests
that BAC warrants further investigation. Pending
confirmation of its predictive power in an outcomes
study, it is reasonable to recommend further risk
assessment of BAC-positive women, preferably with a
gated CAC scan, with subsequent adjustment or
institution of therapy as indicated by the CAC score.
In younger women age 39 to 59, the greatest value
may be the high negative predictive value for CAC of
81%. The sensitivity of 50% and positive predictive
value of 53% in this group, although low, uncovers
one-half of the women who are CAC-positive, almost
all of whom would have been considered low risk by
virtue of their age. Nonetheless, the absence of BAC
cannot be viewed as reassurance of low risk. In the
older age group (70 to 92) the higher sensitivity of

 75% and positive predictive value of 86% confirm the
higher risk status of the BAC-positive women and the
need for further risk assessment by a gated CAC scan
and treatment tailored to the results. In the BAC-
negative older women, the absence of BAC cannot
be reassurance of low risk, with a negative predictive
value of only 36%. In the 60 to 69 age group, the in-
termediate accuracies should be balanced against
their risk factor–based scores (FRS or PCE) to deter-
mine the need for further evaluation. Formal incor-
poration into the cardiac risk assessment of peri- and
post-menopausal women is premature, but in the
meantime, the opportunity to significantly improve
the identification of high-risk women by further
simple analysis of a broadly used screening tool
should be intensively evaluated in larger patient co-
horts. Further refinement of the BAC cutpoints will
likely be necessary to develop clinical algorithms for
recommendations.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Ordinal scoring of nongated CT
scans, rather than conventional Agatston scoring of
gated scans, was used. However, the prognostic value
of ordinal scoring has been well validated, as noted
previously (17,25). This was a retrospective study of
women who had mammography and chest CT scans
within a specified time period, rather than a pro-
spective evaluation of consecutive patients, and is
therefore subject to many selection biases, including
coexisting conditions for which CT evaluation was
requested. Consequently, caution must be exercised
in applying the results to the general population.
Moreover, it is not an event-based outcome study;
rather, CAC was used as a surrogate. Nonetheless, the
strikingly
positive
correlations
and
AUC
equiva-
lencies serve to establish the quantitative relation-
ship between BAC and CAC and set the stage for the
prospective, bias-free outcome trial that is required
before BAC can be routinely incorporated into the
prevention paradigm.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: There is a strong
quantitative association between BAC and CAC, and BAC is su-
perior to standard cardiovascular risk factors for the prediction of
CAC.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Additional studies are needed
to validate the ability of BAC to predict cardiac events in large
prospective population-based studies, similar to CAC. Pending
these studies, consideration may be given to including BAC in
mammography reports.
