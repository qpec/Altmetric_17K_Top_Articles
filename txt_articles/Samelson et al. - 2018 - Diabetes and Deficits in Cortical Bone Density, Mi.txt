ABSTRACT
Older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) tend to have normal or greater areal bone mineral density (aBMD), as measured by DXA, than
those who do not have diabetes (non-T2D). Yet risk of fracture is higher in T2D, including 40% to 50% increased hip fracture risk. We
used HR-pQCT to investigate structural mechanisms underlying skeletal fragility in T2D. We compared cortical and trabecular bone
microarchitecture, density, bone area, and strength in T2D and non-T2D. In secondary analyses we evaluated whether associations
between T2D and bone measures differed according to prior fracture, sex, and obesity. Participants included 1069 members of the
Framingham Study, who attended examinations in 2005 to 2008 and underwent HR-pQCT scanning in 2012 to 2015. Mean age was
64 � 8 years (range, 40 to 87 years), and 12% (n ¼ 129) had T2D. After adjustment for age, sex, weight, and height, T2D had lower
cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD) (p < 0.01), higher cortical porosity (p ¼ 0.02), and smaller cross-sectional area (p ¼ 0.04) at the tibia,
but not radius. Trabecular indices were similar or more favorable in T2D than non-T2D. Associations between T2D and bone
measures did not differ according to sex or obesity status (all interaction p > 0.05); however, associations did differ in those with a
prior fracture and those with no history of fracture. Specifically, cortical vBMD at the tibia and cortical thickness at the radius were
lower in T2D than non-T2D, but only among those individuals with a prior fracture. Cortical porosity at the radius was higher in T2D
than non-T2D, but only among those who did not have a prior fracture. Findings from this large, community-based study of older
adults suggest that modest deterioration in cortical bone and reductions in bone area may characterize diabetic bone disease in
older adults. Evaluation of these deficits as predictors of fracture in T2D is needed to develop prevention strategies in this rapidly
increasing population of older adults. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Introduction
O
steoporotic fractures are a significant public health
problem causing high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare
costs. In the United States, one in two women and one in four
men over age 50 years will sustain a fragility fracture during their
lifetime.(1) Risk of fracture is even greater in adults with type 2
diabetes (T2D),(2–12) including 40% to 50% increased risk of
hip fracture,(4,5,9,13) the most serious of osteoporotic fractures.
Notably, fracture risk is greater in older adults with T2D, even
after accounting for T2D complications known to increase
falls.(3,6,8,12) This increase in hip fracture risk among those
with T2D is significant, because in the general population,
20% of patients with hip fracture die within 1 year. More than
one-half never regain the ability to function independently.(14,15)
Outcomes are even worse in T2D patients with hip fracture,
including greater frequency of postoperative complications,
longer length of stay in the hospital, higher in-hospital mortality,
worse recovery in walking ability and physical function, greater
frequency of pain and depression, and higher likelihood of

 permanent placement in a nursing home, compared to hip
fracture patients without T2D.(16–22)
Over the next 50 years, the largest increase in T2D will be in
those age 75 years and greater, with increases projected as
high as 336% for this oldest age group.(23) Further, the public
health impact of fracture in older adults with T2D will continue
to increase due to the aging of the population and growing
epidemic of T2D.(19) Thus, interventions to prevent fracture in
older adults with T2D are urgently needed. However, a lack of
understanding of the mechanisms of skeletal fragility in T2D
hinders the ability to develop effective clinical strategies.
Despite the substantial fracture risk associated with T2D,
clinicians may not recognize skeletal fragility as a diabetic
complication because individuals with T2D tend to have greater
or normal areal bone mineral density (aBMD), as measured by
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), than those who do not
have diabetes (non-T2D).(13,24) In addition, T2D patients have a
high frequency of obesity, which is also associated with high
aBMD and increased fracture risk at some skeletal sites.(25)
High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomogra-
phy (HR-pQCT) is a 3D imaging technology that evaluates
volumetric bone density, microarchitecture, and geometry
separately for cortical and trabecular compartments. Thus,
HR-pQCT may provide additional insight to the mechanisms
of bone fragility in patients with T2D. A few,(26–29) but not
all,(30,31) studies using HR-pQCT suggest that T2D is associated
with deficits in cortical bone, but preserved trabecular indices.
However, most prior studies used a case-control design,
included small numbers of T2D patients, and were limited
to women. In a small case-control study of postmenopausal
women (n ¼ 19 T2D), Burghardt and colleagues(26) reported
higher cortical pore volume and cortical porosity at the radius in
T2D compared to controls. Patsch and colleagues(27) extended
these findings to show, among T2D, those with prior fracture
had higher pore volume and cortical porosity at the radius than
those with no prior fracture. However, they did not report
differences in bone microstructure by T2D status in those with or
without prior fracture. Findings from the Study of Women Across
the Nation (SWAN) cohort in black women (n ¼ 22 T2D)(28) and
the Hertfordshire Cohort in women and men (n ¼ 29 T2D)(29)
support an association between unfavorable cortical bone
microarchitecture and T2D. In contrast, in the largest study
to date (n ¼ 99 T2D), Nilsson and colleagues(32) found no
differences in cortical indices according to T2D status in women
aged 75 to 80 years in the Gothenburg Study in Sweden. Thus, it
remains uncertain if differences in cortical bone density and
microarchitecture or other skeletal parameters differ by T2D
status in older adults.
We investigated the association between T2D and cortical and
trabecular bone microarchitecture and density, as well as total
bone density, area, and strength. We hypothesized that
individuals with T2D would have lower cortical bone density
and less favorable cortical microarchitecture than non-T2D
individuals. In secondary analyses, we examined whether the
association between T2D and HR-pQCT bone outcomes differed
by obesity status, sex, and history of prior fracture.
Subjects and Methods
Study design and participants
Participants for this study included 1069 members (606 women,
463 men) of the Framingham Offspring Cohort. The Framingham
Offspring Cohort was established in 1971 with enrollment of
5124 adult children and spouses of members of the original
cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, which was enrolled in
1948.(33,34) The original cohort was based on a population-based
sample of two-thirds of the residents living in the town of
Framingham, MA, USA.(35) Participants were predominantly
white, reflecting the race distribution of the source population.
Every 4 years, members of the Offspring Cohort have attended
clinic visits that included physician administered interviews,
physical examinations, and laboratory tests.
The current study included those participants who attended
clinic visits in 2005 to 2008, considered the baseline visit for
this analysis, and completed HR-pQCT scanning and bone
densitometry at the subsequent follow-up visit in 2012 to 2015.
Information on T2D status and covariates was obtained at the
baseline visit (2005 to 2008). This prospective design was used
to ensure that T2D onset preceded evaluation of skeletal
outcomes, performed an average of 7 years after the baseline
visit. Participants provided written informed consent, and the
Institutional Review Board for Human Research at Boston
University and Hebrew SeniorLife approved the study.
HR-pQCT
Volumetric bone density and bone microarchitecture were
assessed
at
the
ultradistal
tibia
and
ultradistal
radius
using HR-pQCT (XtremeCT; Scanco Medical AG, Br€
uttisellen,
Switzerland).(36,37) Scans were acquired with a nominal isotropic
voxel size of 82 mm3. The nondominant forearm and right leg
were scanned, unless a participant reported previous extremity
fracture or had metal in the region of the scan, then the
contralateral extremity was examined (forearm, n ¼ 53 [5%];
tibia, n ¼ 171 [16%]). Anteroposterior scout views were used to
place a reference line on the distal tibial and radial joint surfaces,
as described.(36,37) The scan region (110 slices) was 9 mm in
length and offset proximally to the reference line by 22.5 mm
for the tibia and 9.5 mm for the radius. Scans were evaluated
for motion artifacts and repeated if significant movement
occurred.(38) Scanning of a quality control phantom, containing
rods of hydroxyapatite (HA) (densities of 0, 100, 200, 400, and
800 mg HA/cm3), was performed daily to monitor longitudinal
stability of the system. Each scan was graded using a five-point
movement artifact scale (1 ¼ none, 2 ¼ minor, 3 ¼ moderate,
4 ¼ severe, and 5 ¼ extreme).(38–40) For density measures,
scans with movement artifact rated grades 1 to 4 were retained,
but for microarchitectural measures, only grades 1 to 3 were
retained.(38–40)
We used the standard analysis program (Scanco software,
version V6.0) to assess bone cross-sectional area, total density,
trabecular density, and trabecular microarchitecture. Cortical
densities, thickness, and porosity were evaluated using a
semiautomated cortical bone segmentation technique.(39,41)
We focused on the following indices for bone outcomes:
trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (Tb.BMD, mg
HA/cm3), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), trabecular thickness
(Tb.Th, mm), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm), standard
deviation
of
trabecular
separation
(Tb.Sp.SD,
mm),
total
(integral)
volumetric
bone
mineral
density
(Tt.BMD,

HA/cm3), and total cross-sectional area (Tt.CSA, mm2). The
cortical analysis algorithm wasused to evaluate corticalvolumetric
bone mineral density (Ct.BMD, mg HA/cm3), cortical porosity
(Ct.Po, %), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), cortical area fraction
(Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %), and cortical tissue mineral density (Ct.TMD, mg

with

of 0.3.
Clinical examinations
We used information collected by physical examinations,
laboratory testing, and questionnaires administered at clinic
visits in 2005 to 2008. Hemoglobin A1C (%) and glucose
(mg/dL) levels mIU/mL) were measured from blood samples
drawn after an 8-hour fast using standard methods (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). T2D was defined as individ-
uals with fasting plasma glucose levels greater than 125 mg/dL
(7.0 mmol/dL) or on treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic
agents. Medical histories were reviewed to rule out individuals
with type 1 diabetes.
Height, to the nearest one-quarter inch, and weight, to the
nearest one-half pound, were measured using a stadiometer and
balance beam scale, respectively. Body mass index was calculated
as weight (kilograms [kg]) divided by the square of height (meters
[m]). Information on age, smoking, physical activity (Framingham
Physical Activity Index),(43) alcohol consumption, prior fracture
during adulthood (excluding skull, fingers, toes, and fractures
due to trauma), medication use (bisphosphonates, estrogen
replacement therapy, and calcium and vitamin D supple-
ments), and in women, menopause (cessation of periods for
1 year or more) was obtained by physician-administered
interviews using standardized questionnaires.
Statistical analysis
We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare least-
squares means (�95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for bone
parameters (separately for the radius and tibia) by T2D status,
adjusted for age (years), sex, weight (pounds), and height
(inches). We provided results for bone parameters in their
original units to show distributions in the scale on which each
was measured. In addition, we standardized each bone
parameter to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation (SD) of 1
to show mean differences across bone parameters that are
independent of the original unit of measurement.
In secondary analyses, we examined the association between
T2D and HR-pQCT bone outcomes stratified by history of prior
fracture, obesity, and sex, and tested for interaction. We
considered BMI >30 kg/m2 as obese, as per the definition
used by the World Health Organization.(44) We retained weight
as an adjustment variable to control for residual confounding by
weight within obesity groups. In order to compare our findings
with prior work, we examined prior fracture as a main effect,
stratifying by T2D status.(27)
We performed two sensitivity analyses. To investigate the role
of duration of T2D, we considered a four-level ordinal variable
categorized by duration of T2D as greater than 10 years, 6 to
10 years, less than 5 years, and 0 years (no T2D), and we
performed tests for trend in the association with each bone
measure. These cut-points were selected to assure adequate
numbers of individuals in each group for analysis. We repeated
all the analyses excluding T2D taking thiazolidinediones
(n ¼ 18). Results remained the same, so results are based on
the full sample. We used p < 0.05 as the level of statistical
significance. Analyses were performed using PC-SAS (version
9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
At baseline for the current study, mean age of participants was
64 � 8 years and ranged from 40 to 87 years. Mean duration of
follow-up time from the baseline visit to the follow-up visit with
assessment of bone outcomes was 7.4 � 0.8 years. Mean BMI
was 28 kg/m2, and 31% were obese (Table 1). Eight percent
were current smokers. One-third of individuals reported a prior
fracture. Twelve percent of participants (n ¼ 129) were diag-
nosed with T2D, including 54 women and 75 men. Among those
with T2D, 48% (n ¼ 62) did not use any T2D medications, 33%
(n ¼ 43) used biguanides, 29% (n ¼ 37) used sulfonylureas, 14%
(n ¼ 18) used thiazolidinediones, and 6% (n ¼ 8) used insulin.
Forty percent (n ¼ 51) of T2D were diagnosed in the past 5 years,
36% (n ¼ 46) in the past 6 to 10 years, and 24% (n ¼ 32) in the
past 10 or more years (including 12% [n ¼ 16] in the past 11 to
15 years, 6% [n ¼ 8] in the past 16 to 19 years, 5% [n ¼ 7] in the
past 20 to 25 years, and 1% [n ¼ 1] diagnosed 34 years ago).
Individuals with T2D were older, heavier, taller, and less
physically active than non-T2D. Participants with T2D were
less likely to have used bisphosphonates and calcium/vitamin D
supplements compared to non-T2D. In contrast, menopause
status and estrogen use in women and frequency of prior
fracture and smoking did not differ by T2D status.
Comparison of HR-pQCT parameters by T2D status
Comparison of adjusted means for bone measures between T2D
and non-T2D are shown in original units in Table 2 and SD units
in Fig. 1. Individuals with T2D had lower cortical vBMD (p < 0.01)
and higher cortical porosity at the tibia (p ¼ 0.02), but not the
radius (Ct.BMD, p ¼ 0.69; Ct.Po, p ¼ 0.22), than non-T2D (Table 2,
Fig. 1). Cortical thickness, cortical area fraction, and cortical
tissue mineral density at the tibia and radius did not differ by
T2D status. Trabecular indices (Tb.BMD, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp,
and Tb.Sp.SD) and total BMD (Tt.BMD) at the tibia and radius did
not differ by T2D status or were somewhat more favorable in
T2D than non-T2D (for example, tibia Tb.BMD: 181.17 versus
174.73 g/cm3; p ¼ 0.06). T2D had smaller cross-sectional area
(Tt.CSA) at the tibia (759.30 versus 777.85 mm2, p ¼ 0.04), but the
difference in cross-sectional area was only borderline significant
at the radius (298.58 versus 307.10 mm2, p ¼ 0.06). T2D tended
to have lower FEA-estimated failure load at the tibia (6288
versus 6452, p ¼ 0.07) and radius (2451 versus 2526, p ¼ 0.10)
than non-T2D; however, the differences were not statistically
significant.
Comparison of HR-pQCT parameters by T2D status,
stratified by history of fracture
The association between T2D and tibial cortical vBMD, radius
cortical porosity, and radius cortical thickness differed among
persons with a prior fracture and persons who did not have a
history of fracture; interaction, p < 0.05 (Fig. 2). Specifically,
cortical vBMD at the tibia and cortical thickness at the radius
were lower in T2D than non-T2D, but only among those
with a history of fracture. Cortical porosity at the radius was
higher in T2D, but only among those who did not have a prior
fracture.

 Comparison of HR-pQCT parameters by history of
fracture, stratified by T2D status
To compare our findings with prior work, we compared bone
measures between individuals with prior fracture and those with
no history of fracture, according to T2D status (Supporting
Table 1). Among T2D, prior fracture was associated with worse
cortical indices (lower tibia cortical vBMD, lower tibia cortical
tissue mineral density, lower radius cortical thickness), except
radius cortical porosity, which was lower in those with a history
of fracture. Among T2D, prior fracture was not associated with
trabecular indices at the tibia or radius.
In contrast, among non-T2D, prior fracture was associated
with worse trabecular indices at both the tibia and radius (lower
trabecular vBMD, lower trabecular number, higher trabecular
separation, higher trabecular separation SD; trabecular thick-
ness at radius), and with lower cortical vBMD and cortical tissue
mineral density at the tibia (Supporting Table 1). Prior fracture
was associated with lower FEA failure load at the radius in T2D,
and prior fracture was associated with lower FEA failure load at
both the radius and tibia in non-T2D. Notably, the sample sizes
for these comparisons were smaller for the group of individuals
with T2D (42 with prior fracture versus 87 with no history of
fracture) than the group of non-T2D (307 with prior fracture
versus 633 with no history of fracture).
Comparison of HR-pQCT parameters by T2D status,
stratified by obesity and sex
The associations between T2D and tibia and radius bone
measures did not differ by obesity status (Supporting Fig. 1) or
sex (Supporting Fig. 2), all tests for interaction, p > 0.05. Finally,
we found evidence for a trend between increasing duration of
T2D (non-T2D, T2D �5 years, T2D 6 to 10 years, and T2D >10
years) and decreasing tibia cortical density (812.45, 778.33,
810.83, and 791.68, respectively; trend p ¼ 0.05), increasing
tibial cortical porosity (9.98%, 10.20%, 11.04%, and 10.88%,
respectively; trend p < 0.01), and increasing tibial trabecular
number (2.07, 2.04, 2.17, and 2.17, respectively; trend p ¼ 0.02).
We observed no trends between duration of T2D and any other
tibial or radius parameters.
Discussion
In this large, community-based study of older adults, we found
that individuals with T2D had modest deficits in cortical bone
density and microarchitecture at the tibia, as well as decreased
cross-sectional area at the tibia, compared to those who did not
have T2D. In contrast, trabecular indices did not differ by T2D
status. These findings suggest that modest deterioration in
cortical bone and lower cross-sectional area may characterize

 diabetic bone disease at the weight bearing skeleton in older
adults.
Our results are consistent with previous studies that reported
lower cortical bone density and higher cortical porosity in
postmenopausal women with T2D,(26,28) and in women with T2D
and prior fracture.(27) However, our study extends these previous
findings by including a large, community-based population of
women and men. The case-control studies conducted by
Burghardt and colleagues(26) and Patsch and colleagues(27)
included small, clinically-based samples of postmenopausal
women. Findings from the Hertfordshire Cohort(29) and the
SWAN Cohort(28) are consistent with our study. Notably, the
number of subjects with T2D was also small in these cohort
studies: 11 women and 18 men in the Hertfordshire Cohort(29)
and 22 women in SWAN.(28)
In contrast to prior work,(27) we found that decreased cortical
density at the tibia and increased cortical porosity at the tibia
differentiated between T2D with prior fracture and non-T2D
with prior fracture. Further, there was a suggestion of a trend
between decreasing cortical density and increasing cortical
porosity at the tibia with increasing duration of T2D. However,
T2D duration was not associated with deficits in any other bone
parameters. The Gothenburg Study(32) reported no differences
in cortical indices by T2D status in a cross-sectional study of
women in a population-based cohort (n ¼ 99 T2D). Differences
in results between our studies may be attributable in part to
differences in characteristics of participants or to differences in
study designs. Our prospective study included both women and
men who ranged in age from 40 to 87 years (mean, 64 years),
whereas
the
cross-sectional
Gothenburg
Study
included
only women who were 75 to 80 years old (mean, 77 years). In
addition, 25% of the women with T2D were newly diagnosed at
the time of HR-pQCT assessments in the Gothenburg Study. The
relatively short duration of disease may have obscured potential
differences in bone measures between T2D and non-T2D. The
Gothenburg Study used a more proximal measuring site, which
may be more reliable than the more distal site used in the
present study. The risk of misplacing the endosteal contour is
greater more distally, especially in older individuals who may
have thin cortices.
The reduction in cross-sectional area observed in older adults
with T2D in our study has not been previously reported in
studies using HR-pQCT. In the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
(MrOS) study, Petit and colleagues(45) found men with T2D had
smaller bone area at the distal tibia and radius, evaluated by
pQCT, compared to men without T2D. Reasons for detrimental
impact of T2D on bone cross-sectional area are not readily
apparent. Decreased cross-sectional area has been observed

 with hypogonadism in men with T2D and with insulin resistance
in non-diabetic women.(46) Smaller cross-sectional area could
indicate failure in adaptive responses to increased demands
from mechanical loading or metabolic or other disturbances.
Nevertheless, deficits in bone area may contribute to high
fracture risk in T2D, despite normal or high levels of BMD.
We observed deficits in cortical bone and reduced cross-
sectional area predominately in the tibia; however, results
were similar (but not statistically significant) for the radius.
The stronger association between T2D and skeletal deficits
observed at the tibia may be due to a greater tendency for slight
movement in radius versus tibia scans, which may make it more
difficult to detect subtle differences in bone microarchitecture at
the radius site. Alternatively, the site-specificity may implicate a
role for vascular disease, causing greater damage to peripheral
blood flow in the distal lower extremities. Both animal and
human studies have documented the presence of skeletal
microangiopathy and vascular calcification in the setting of
T2D,(47–49) and there is evidence that vascular dysfunction may
have adverse effects on skeletal health.(50–54)
Results from the current investigation, together with findings
from prior studies, provide compelling evidence that T2D is
characterized by moderately increased cortical porosity and
decreased cross-sectional area. The critical question this study
cannot address is whether these deficits explain the increased
fracture risk observed in older adults with T2D. The differences in
cortical bone density and microarchitecture observed in our
study are likely not large enough to fully explain the increased
risk of fracture observed in T2D. For example, multivariable-
adjusted mean values for tibial cortical porosity were 11% in
T2D versus 10% in non-T2D, representing a difference of 0.22 SD
units. Instead, cortical deficits shown in the present study as well
as others may be a biomarker for other mechanisms responsible
for skeletal fragility in T2D, such as accumulation of advanced
glycation end products (AGEs) or microvascular dysfunction,
which we were not able to consider in this study. Alternatively, it
is also possible that the differences in cortical porosity between
T2D and non-T2D were underestimated in our study because
standard HR-pQCT analyses cannot detect cortical pores less
than 100 mm in diameter. However, the impact of small pores on
whole bone strength remains to be elucidated.(55,56)
One potential limitation of our study protocol was the
acquisition of the HR-pQCT scans at a fixed distance from the
articular joint surface in all subjects, rather than at location that is
relative to the individual’s limb length. Use of a fixed scan
location has been the standard in the field, but may obscure
differences in bone morphology when comparing individuals
with differing limb lengths, even after statistical adjustment for
height and weight.(57,58) In our study, individuals with T2D were
slightly taller than those without T2D, which could have led to

 their scan region being relatively more distal than those without
T2D. The cross-sectional area is one of the outcomes that is
most influenced by the scan region,(57) with cross-sectional
area increasing distally. Thus, potential bias introduced by using
a fixed scan region does not explain the lower cross-sectional
area seen in T2D.
A second limitation of our study is that a single HR-pQCT
scan does not allow characterization of changes over time in
bone microarchitecture in persons with T2D. Accordingly,
the maintenance of trabecular bone in T2D could be due to
preferential trabecularization of the endocortical cortex in T2D
versus non-T2D. However, this is unlikely given the similar
cortical thickness and cortical area fraction in T2D and non-T2D.
Nonetheless, longitudinal evaluation of bone microstructure is
required to describe the evolution of bone microarchitecture
changes in T2D.
As an observational study, this investigation was not able
to definitively determine that T2D causes cortical deficits
and smaller bone area, while preserving trabecular bone.
However, our study provides important evidence to support
this hypothesis. A notable strength of our study was that we
included a large, community-based population of women and
men from a nonclinical population. However, participants
are predominantly white, because the Framingham Study is a
population-based cohort established in 1948 in Framingham,
MA, USA.(35) Thus, our findings may not be fully generalizable to
populations with different race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic
characteristics. Importantly, the paradox of high fracture risk
with high aBMD in T2D is observed in blacks and other race/
ethnic groups.(59) In addition, T2D was associated with deficits in
cortical (but not trabecular) bone in a study of blacks,(28) results
consistent with our findings. Although our sample size of 129
participants with T2D is modest, with few exceptions,(32) prior
studies included 20 to 30 individuals per comparison group.
Nevertheless, our study may have had limited power to detect
associations, particularly in stratified analysis.
The Framingham Study is a well-characterized cohort, and
we were able to control for important confounders. However,
as in all observational studies, there is potential for residual
confounding. Finally, we defined T2D status based on fasting
glucose levels and were able to confirm exclusion of T1D.
It is possible that cohort members may have developed
T2D over the follow-up time. However, this misclassification of
T2D status would have resulted in an underestimation of
associations between T2D and HR-pQCT indices. We were
also able to determine that our findings were not due to
use of T2D medications associated with bone loss because
excluding individuals taking thiazolidinediones did not change
results.
In conclusion, T2D may be deleterious to cortical bone
density, cortical microarchitecture, and bone area, but not
trabecular bone. Prospective studies are highly needed to
determine if these deficits, undetectable by DXA, predict
fracture risk in older adults with T2D. If so, this would support
the development of interventions that target the maintenance
of cortical bone and bone area for fracture prevention in
patients with T2D. Given the exponential growth projected
for
both
T2D
and
osteoporosis,
diabetic

disease
will increasingly become a major clinical and public health
problem. Development of preventive strategies, including
effective imaging modalities for screening, is urgently needed
because current clinical guidelines do not adequately identify
T2D patients at risk of fracture.
