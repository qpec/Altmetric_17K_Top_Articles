ABSTRACT
The 2016 Warwick Agreement on femoroacetabular
impingement (FAI) syndrome was convened to build an
international, multidisciplinary consensus on the
diagnosis and management of patients with FAI
syndrome. 22 panel members and 1 patient from 9
countries and 5 different specialties participated in a
1-day consensus meeting on 29 June 2016. Prior to the
meeting, 6 questions were agreed on, and recent
relevant systematic reviews and seminal literature were
circulated. Panel members gave presentations on the
topics of the agreed questions at Sports Hip 2016, an
open meeting held in the UK on 27–29 June.
Presentations were followed by open discussion. At the
1-day consensus meeting, panel members developed
statements in response to each question through open
discussion; members then scored their level of
agreement with each response on a scale of 0–10.
Substantial agreement (range 9.5–10) was reached for
each of the 6 consensus questions, and the associated
terminology was agreed on. The term ‘femoroacetabular
impingement syndrome’ was introduced to reflect the
central role of patients’ symptoms in the disorder. To
reach a diagnosis, patients should have appropriate
symptoms, positive clinical signs and imaging findings.
Suitable treatments are conservative care, rehabilitation,
and arthroscopic or open surgery. Current understanding
of prognosis and topics for future research were
discussed. The 2016 Warwick Agreement on FAI
syndrome is an international multidisciplinary agreement
on the diagnosis, treatment principles and key
terminology relating to FAI syndrome.
INTRODUCTION
The concept of hip impingement has been appre-
ciated since at least 1936.1 Ganz et al2 discussed
femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in more detail
in 2001, reporting a new surgical approach, and
then presenting a hypothesis linking FAI with osteo-
arthritis in 2003.3 This, and the introduction of an
arthroscopic approach to surgery in the early 2000s,
led to increasing interest in this condition; the
number of patients identified with FAI has risen
rapidly over the past 10 years.4–6 In parallel, there
has been a rapid increase in the number of publica-
tions. In 2012, Clohisy and Kim7 organised a
meeting of predominantly orthopaedic surgeons to
summarise the literature on FAI, develop consensus
and consider how best to design future research.8–13
In recent years, the number of patients being
treated for FAI has risen sharply in many coun-
tries.5 6 14 Clinicians, funders and health systems
are concerned about this rise in a previously unrec-
ognised condition, the costs and uncertainties of
treatment, the lack of clarity of the epidemiology
and the ambiguity of the diagnostic criteria.
To guide patients, clinicians and funders, we con-
vened a consensus meeting. Our aim was to reach
an international multidisciplinary agreement on the
diagnosis and management of FAI syndrome.

 included sport and exercise medicine physicians, physiothera-
pists, orthopaedic surgeons and radiologists, who are most
closely involved in managing these patients. W
e invited people
who were known to have a research interest and clinical practice
in FAI syndrome, and asked professional organisations with a
known interest to nominate suitable people (International
Society for Hip Arthroscopy, International Federation of Sports
Physical Therapy and American Medical Society for Sports
Medicine). W
e aimed to have representation from around the
world, and deliberately chose people who we knew to hold dis-
parate views, representing as wide a spectrum of opinion as pos-
sible. In total, 22 expert clinicians and academics, and 1 patient,
from 9 countries and 5 specialties, participated in the process
and are the authors of this article.
Preliminary work
W
e developed a list of topics and questions that we hoped to
answer, circulating ideas around the panel until there was agree-
ment. W
e searched relevant databases (PubMed and Cochrane
Library), with review filter (PubMed), using the search term
‘femoroacetabular impingement’ from inception to 18 March
2016 for published articles relevant to these topics. A list of arti-
cles consisting of recent systematic reviews and original seminal
research relevant to these topics was prepared; panel members
suggested additional articles where important research had been
omitted. The revised selection of publications was provided to
all panel members along with the following final questions:
▸ What is FAI syndrome?3 15–17
▸ How should FAI syndrome be diagnosed?8 11 18–21
▸ What is the appropriate treatment of FAI syndrome?9 22–28
▸ What is the prognosis of FAI syndrome?13 29
▸ How should someone with an asymptomatic hip with cam or
pincer morphology be managed?30 31
▸ Which outcome measures should be used to assess treatment
for FAI syndrome?32–34
▸ What future research needs to be conducted?
Open meeting
Panel members gave presentations at Sports Hip 2016 (http://
www.sportshipsurgery.org), an open meeting held in the UK on
27–28 June 2016. One hundred and fifty international delegates
from a range of clinical backgrounds (surgeons, radiologists,
physiotherapists and sport and exercise medicine doctors) famil-
iar with managing young adult hip pathology attended the con-
ference. Panel members’ presentations explored each topic with
an emphasis on the highest levels of evidence, from systematic
reviews and randomised controlled trials where available. After
each presentation, DRG chaired an open discussion where all
delegates and the panel members discussed each topic.
Agreement meeting
On 29 June 2016, the panel met at the University of W
arwick
to formulate the agreement statement. The meeting was chaired
by EJD who did not express opinions during the discussion.
For each topic, the chairman facilitated a structured discussion
leading to a proposed wording for consideration. Panel members
then voted on each proposal on a Likert scale of 0–10, where 0
reflected complete disagreement, 5 neither agreement nor dis-
agreement and 10 complete agreement. Levels of agreement were
summarised with mean scores and 95% CIs. Discussions contin-
ued until a mean score of >7.5 was reached, or until the chair-
man deemed that no further compromise could be found.
A different approach was taken when discussing what future
research is needed. Delegates at Sports Hip 2016, including panel
members, were invited to suggest their opinions as to the most
important research questions that need to be answered in order
to improve the management of FAI syndrome. EJD and KB col-
lated responses. W
e used a web-based prioritisation programme
(http://www.1000minds.com) to order these research questions.
This software presented panel members with pairs of research
questions and asked them to choose the more important of the
two. Repeated pairwise comparisons, across all panel members,
led to an ordered list of research questions. During the agreement
meeting, the panel used this ordered list of research questions as
a basis for open discussion and development of research themes.
RESULTS
The results of the consensus process (the W
arwick International
Agreement) are summarised in online supplementary file A. In
the following paragraphs, we present the agreed statements for
each topic or question (in shading), followed by a summary of
the panel’s consensus discussions.
What is FAI syndrome?
FAI syndrome is a motion-related clinical disorder of the hip
with a triad of symptoms, clinical signs and imaging findings.
It represents symptomatic premature contact between the
proximal femur and the acetabulum.
Level of agreement: mean score 9.8 (95% CI 9.6 to 10).
DISCUSSION
FAI was described by Ganz et al3 as a condition of “abnormal
contact that may arise as a result of either abnormal morpho-
logical features…or as a result of subjecting the hip to excessive
and supraphysiological range of motion”. Sankar et al13 further
developed this definition, describing ‘five essential elements’:
▸ Abnormal morphology of the femur and/or acetabulum;
▸ Abnormal contact between these two structures;
▸ Especially vigorous supraphysiological motion that results in
such abnormal contact and collision;
▸ Repetitive motion resulting in the continuous insult;
▸ The presence of soft-tissue damage.
W
e felt that these definitions do not sufficiently emphasise
patients’ symptoms. Ambiguity as to the role of symptoms in
making a diagnosis of FAI has led to the introduction of new
terms such as ‘asymptomatic FAI’ or ‘radiological FAI’,35–37
apparently to describe hip morphologies rather than a clinical
disorder.19 W
e agreed that this creates confusion when trying to
define the clinical disorder.
To make clear the need for symptoms to be present, the panel
proposed the new term ‘femoroacetabular impingement syn-
drome’, or ‘FAI syndrome’.38 W
e considered other terms, for
example, hip impingement syndrome, but preferred FAI syn-
drome as this did not include extra-articular hip impingement
such as ischiofemoral or greater trochanteric impingement. W
e
considered whether ‘syndrome’ might apply a negative label to
patients, but the expert patient member of the panel did not
feel this would be the case.
W
e defined FAI syndrome as a triad of
symptoms, clinical
signs and imaging findings.3 13 This term and its definition build
on the definitions of FAI from Ganz et al and Sankar et al, but
emphasise that symptoms, clinical signs and relevant imaging
findings must all be present for diagnosis
To ensure that there is a distinction between patients with FAI
syndrome and those with cam or pincer morphology but no

 clinical disorder, the panel recommends that certain terminology
be used while we cease to use other terms that were considered
confusing (see table 1).
How should FAI syndrome be diagnosed?
Symptoms, clinical signs and imaging findings must be present
to diagnose FAI syndrome.
Level of agreement: mean score 9.8 (95% CI 9.6 to 10).
Symptoms
The primary symptom of FAI syndrome is motion-related or
position-related pain in the hip or groin. Pain may also be felt in
the back, buttock or thigh. In addition to pain, patients may
also describe clicking, catching, locking, stiffness, restricted
range of motion or giving way.
Level of agreement: mean score 9.8 (95% CI 9.6 to 10).
DISCUSSION
The primary symptom of FAI syndrome is pain.3 However,
there is wide variation in the location, nature, radiation, severity
and precipitating factors that characterise this pain. Most
patients report pain in the groin or hip, but pain is also reported
in the lateral hip, anterior thigh, buttock, knee, lower back,
lateral and posterior thigh.39 Pain in FAI syndrome is typically
motion-related or position-related; we recognised that this
encompasses a wide range of patients, from those who experi-
ence symptoms during or after vigorous activity (eg, football),
to those who have pain with a supraphysiological range of
motion (eg, dance, gymnastics), to those who get symptoms
despite
leading
a
sedentary
lifestyle
(seated
for
long
periods).3 39 40 W
e agreed that mechanical symptoms, such as
clicking, catching, locking, giving way or stiffness are also
reported by many patients with FAI syndrome.39
W
e discussed the common problem of determining whether
pain is really arising from the hip joint or from other structures
in the groin and hip region. W
e agreed that image-guided (X-ray
or ultrasound) local anaesthetic injections are useful in helping
to resolve this situation.41 42 Pain relief following a local anaes-
thetic injection would support a diagnosis of FAI syndrome,
when the other diagnostic criteria are met.43
In most patients who seek treatment for FAI syndrome, symptoms
are not mild or subtle. They are often severe and limiting in every-
day life. The panel felt that this is especially important because
patients are usually young, economically active adults. Symptoms of
FAI syndrome therefore lead to a significant and lasting cost burden
for society as well as being individually debilitating.44
Clinical signs
Diagnosis of FAI syndrome does not depend on a single clinical
sign; many have been described and are used in clinical
practice. Hip impingement tests usually reproduce the patient’s
typical pain; the most commonly used test, flexion adduction
internal rotation (FADIR), is sensitive but not specific. There is
often a limited range of hip motion, typically restricted internal
rotation in flexion.
Level of agreement: mean score 9.9 (95% CI 9.7 to 10).
DISCUSSION
W
e discussed the need for a comprehensive hip and groin exam-
ination, as part of the determination of a diagnosis of FAI
syndrome.45
Many examination techniques and clinical signs for FAI syn-
drome have been described, but we agreed that there are several
problems. Different clinicians apply and interpret clinical tests
differently, with little consistency between professional groups
or among peers.45 46 Even when tests are well defined, they
have often been evaluated in populations with a high likelihood
of a positive test,18 so their performance in a different environ-
ment (such as primary care) is not known. The most well-
known test, the FADIR impingement test, is sensitive (usually
positive when FAI syndrome is present), but not specific (often
positive when FAI syndrome is not the correct diagnosis).18 The
evidence on hip range of motion (ROM) in FAI syndrome is sur-
prisingly contradictory,16 47 but the panel felt that on balance
FAI syndrome is associated with a restricted hip ROM.
W
e also recognised that abnormal movement patterns around
the hip and pelvis are present in patients with FAI syn-
drome.47 48 These movement patterns, associated with FAI syn-
drome, may lead to pain or dysfunction in other regions, such
as
the
spine,
pelvis,
posterior
hip
or
abdominal
wall.47
Furthermore, muscles around the hip are frequently weak in
patients with FAI syndrome.16
The panel concluded that when FAI syndrome is suspected, it
is important to examine gait, single leg control, muscle tender-
ness around the hip and hip ROM including internal rotation in
flexion and the FABER distance (flexion abduction external
rotation). Impingement testing should be performed, and to be
positive it must reproduce the patient’s familiar pain. It is essen-
tial to examine the groin for other structures that can produce
similar pain.
Diagnostic imaging
An anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis and a lateral
femoral neck view of the symptomatic hip should initially be
performed to obtain an overview of the hips, identify cam or
pincer morphologies, and identify other causes of hip pain.
Where further assessment of hip morphology and associated
cartilage and labral lesions is desired, cross-sectional imaging is
appropriate.
Level of agreement: mean score 9.5 (95% CI 9.1 to 9.8).

 DISCUSSION
Morphological assessment of the hip is required in order to
diagnose FAI syndrome, identifying cam or pincer morphology.
Cam morphology refers to a flattening or convexity at the
femoral head neck junction.3 Pincer morphology refers to either
global or focal overcoverage of the femoral head by the acetabu-
lum.3 The panel emphasised that their presence, in the absence
of appropriate symptoms and clinical signs, does not constitute
a diagnosis of FAI syndrome. A substantial proportion of people
in the general population are thought to have cam or pincer
morphology.19 49
W
e agreed that radiological assessment is best achieved ini-
tially with plain radiographs. A pelvic radiograph allows an
overall assessment of the pelvis and hips, and exclusion of other
painful conditions such as fracture, acetabular dysplasia and
osteoarthritis. Ideally, this radiograph should be centred on the
pubic symphysis, without rotation, and with neutral pelvic
tilt.3 50 The shape of the acetabulum can be interpreted from
this radiograph,51 but visualising the shape of the proximal
femur requires an orthogonal view of the femoral neck.
A number of such views have been described such as the cross-
table lateral, Dunn and frog laterals.52
There are some difficulties in interpreting three-dimensional
(3D) shapes from plain radiographs. For example, the spatial
orientation of the acetabulum may be affected by the position
of the pelvis. Posterior tilt increases in standing position and the
parameters that describe anterior and posterior acetabular cover-
age, which are important in describing pincer morphology, may
change.50 53 Also, two orthogonal views of the femoral neck
may not be sufficient to identify all instances of cam morph-
ology.21 In combination, these radiographs are only moderately
sensitive for identifying the typical morphology of FAI syn-
drome, but are specific.21
W
e agreed that morphology can be better characterised
through cross-sectional imaging, either CT or MRI.21 54 This is
particularly important if surgery is being considered. MR
arthrography is usually more accurate than plain MRI to assess
the labrum and articular cartilage.55 56 MRI may also identify
other soft tissue lesions that may result in hip or groin pain.
When performing cross-sectional imaging of the hip in FAI syn-
drome, limited images of the distal femoral condyles allow
assessment of femoral torsion, while 3D reformatting of CT or
radial MRI allows assessment of focal morphological abnormal-
ities, particularly of the proximal femur.57
Many radiographic measures of cam and pincer morphology
have been described including the α angle (cam), cross-over sign
and centre-edge angle (pincer).58–60 Some clinical trials (e.g. UK
FASHIoN) of treatments for FAI syndrome have included patients
with an α angle >55° at any position on the head neck junction
for cam morphology and a positive cross-over sign or a centre
edge angle >39° for pincer morphology
.14 However α angles
cannot accurately discriminate between patients with cam type FAI
syndrome and asymptomatic volunteers, despite changes to the
threshold value.20
The panel was unable to recommend precise diagnostic values
for any of the common measures to define cam or pincer
morphology in routine clinical practice. This is because we
recognised that impingement is the result of a complex inter-
action, during motion, between the acetabulum and femoral
neck. W
e agreed that the depth, orientation and rim of the acet-
abulum, and the head–neck profile, neck angle and torsion of
the proximal femur all vary in the general population. It is
when
a
particularly
unfavourable
combination
of
these
characteristics occur together, along with provocative movement
or position, that a patient may present with FAI syndrome. It
has not been possible to capture all of this in a single measure-
ment or even a simple set of shape criteria.
What is the appropriate treatment of FAI syndrome?
FAI syndrome can be treated by conservative care, rehabilitation
or surgery. Conservative care may involve education, watchful
waiting, lifestyle and activity modification. Physiotherapy-led
rehabilitation aims to improve hip stability, neuromuscular
control, strength, range of motion and movement patterns.
Surgery, either open or arthroscopic, aims to improve the hip
morphology and repair damaged tissue. The good management
of the variety of patients with FAI syndrome requires the
availability of all of these approaches.
Level of agreement: mean score 9.5 (95% CI 9.0 to 10).
DISCUSSION
Treatment strategies for FAI syndrome have included conserva-
tive care, rehabilitation and surgery. The panel agreed that each
of these may have a role in different patients, but that there is
little evidence to compare their effectiveness. Figure 1 is a sug-
gested pathway for the management of FAI syndrome.
There is currently no high-level evidence to support the
choice of a definitive treatment for FAI syndrome.22 23 For any
one patient, the panel agreed that it is appropriate to consider
the different treatment options. This is best done in a shared
decision-making process, supporting the individual patient to
make an informed preference decision on the best treatment
option for them.61 62 W
e agreed that those treating FAI syn-
drome, particularly in secondary and tertiary care, should be
part of a multidisciplinary group with knowledge of, and access
to, all the treatment options.
Conservative care of patients with FAI syndrome is poorly
described but could include patient education, activity and
lifestyle modification, oral analgesia including non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular steroid injection and
watchful waiting.23 There are no reports of what effect such an
approach, in isolation, has on the symptoms of FAI syndrome.
Similar conservative strategies are recommended in other mus-
culoskeletal disorders such as hip osteoarthritis.63 64
Physiotherapist-led rehabilitation aims to reduce patients’ symp-
toms by improving hip stability, neuromuscular control and move-
ment patterns.23 The treatment targets for rehabilitation are
wide-ranging and include improving sagittal and frontal plane hip
range of motion, hip muscle strengthening and lumbopelvic dissoci-
ation.14 47 48 65 However, details of what should be incorporated in
such a programme has not been well tested and it would appear
that different physiotherapists are delivering different treatments.23
Surgery aims to correct hip morphology to achieve impingement-
free motion. Cam morphology can be reshaped and femoral torsion
or neck angle adjusted; the acetabulum can be reorientated or its rim
trimmed. Where there is damage to the labrum or articular cartilage,
this can be resected, repaired or reconstructed. Often, these proce-
dures can be done by either arthroscopic or open surgery
.2 4 An
arthroscopic approach may be preferable in many patients to allow
rapid recovery
, but some of these procedures will require an open
approach. Postoperative physiotherapy protocols have been described
but their value is uncertain.66–68

 What is the prognosis of FAI syndrome?
In patients who are treated for FAI syndrome, symptoms
frequently improve, and they return to full activity, including
sports. Without treatment, symptoms of FAI syndrome will
probably worsen over time. The long-term outlook for patients
with FAI syndrome is unknown. However, it is likely that cam
morphology is associated with hip osteoarthritis. It is currently
unknown whether treatment for FAI syndrome prevents hip
osteoarthritis.
Level of agreement: mean score 9.6 (95% CI 9.3 to 9.8).
DISCUSSION
The panel agreed that patients with FAI syndrome who are not
treated probably experience a gradual deterioration of symp-
toms.69 W
e do not know of any reports of the outcomes of con-
servative care. Physiotherapy-led rehabilitation seems to be
associated with an improvement in symptoms for at least 2
years.23 70 However, the studies supporting this are only a few
observational studies with small sample sizes and important
methodological weaknesses.23 Reports of the results of surgery
are more numerous and describe significant improvement in
symptoms up to 5 years,71 but they suffer similar issues of poor
design and therefore high risk of bias.22 Longer term results
have been reported for open surgery, including improved symp-
toms persisting in most patients for at least 10 years.72
All prospective cohort studies available demonstrate an associ-
ation between cam morphology and osteoarthritis of the hip.73–76
These studies have not found a similar association between pincer
morphology and osteoarthritis. W
e are unable to say whether FAI
syndrome is associated with a higher risk of osteoarthritis than iso-
lated cam morphology
, but the panel thought it was likely. There is
no evidence that treatment for FAI syndrome alters the risk of sub-
sequent osteoarthritis.
How should someone with an asymptomatic hip with cam
or pincer morphology be managed?
It is not known which individuals with cam or pincer morphologies
will develop symptoms and, therefore, FAI syndrome. Preventive
measures may have a role in higher risk populations, but it is rarely
indicated to offer surgery to these individuals.
Level of agreement: mean score 9.6 (95% CI 9.4 to 9.8).
DISCUSSION
There is no evidence that treating people who do not have
pain, but who do have cam or pincer morphology, will alter
the risk of them developing FAI syndrome or osteoarthritis,
and so it is rarely indicated to offer surgery to these people.
Preventative physiotherapy-led rehabilitation and conditioning
strategies may be appropriate in professional athletes where

 professional football teams.77 In exceptional circumstances,
and in a shared decision-making process with a patient,
surgery may occasionally be appropriate for high-risk patients.
An example of such a patient could be an active young adult
who has had surgery for FAI syndrome in one hip and in
whom chondrolabral injury is seen to be developing in the
other (painless) hip.78 In such cases, careful consideration
must be given to the risks of surgery and its unknown long-
term outcome as well as to the uncertain risks of worsening
degeneration and the onset of symptoms.
Which outcome measures should be used to assess
treatment for FAI syndrome?
Specifically designed and well-validated patient-reported
outcome measures should be used to assess treatment for FAI
syndrome. The international Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT), Hip and
Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) and Hip Outcome Score (HOS)
are recommended.
Level of agreement: mean score 9.7 (95% CI 9.4 to 9.9).
DISCUSSION
The iHOT-12 and iHOT-33, HAGOS, and HOS are valid
measures to assess young adults with hip joint pain. W
e recom-
mend
these
instruments
for
use
in
clinical
practice
and
research.33 34 79 80 For FAI syndrome in particular, iHOT and
HAGOS were patient-derived in populations of patients includ-
ing those treated for FAI syndrome, and so can be expected to
perform well in this group. Both have sound psychometric prop-
erties including test-retest reliability, responsiveness, content val-
idity, and construct validity.
In addition to the hip-specific outcome measures, general
quality of life instruments such as the EQ-5D, SF12/36 or
PROMIS are recommended.81–83 These instruments may not be
necessary for routine clinical decision-making and assessment of
FAI syndrome, but they have a role in facilitating economic ana-
lyses and relative comparisons to other conditions and treatments
as part of clinical research and health policy development.
DISCUSSION
The delegates at Sports Hip 2016 proposed 118 research ques-
tions about the diagnosis and management of FAI syndrome.
During the consensus exercise, we identified 23 substantially
different questions, which were ranked in order of priority by
the panel (see online supplementary file B). The panel grouped
the questions into four categories: aetiology, diagnosis, progno-
sis and effect of treatment.
Regarding aetiology, there was considerable interest in how
cam and pincer morphologies develop, whether sporting activity
in childhood may influence this, and why some patients develop
symptoms and others do not.
For diagnosis, we agreed that diagnostic criteria are imprecise
and need to be improved, and that the utility of those we have
is unclear. W
e would benefit considerably from better informa-
tion on the long-term natural history of FAI syndrome, though
the panel recognised that significant resources are needed to
perform the necessary long-term prospective studies. Finally,
there is an urgent need to compare the effectiveness of conser-
vative,
rehabilitation
and
surgical
treatment
strategies.
Fortunately, several such studies are in progress (see table 2),
and results will begin to appear in the next few years.
CONCLUSION
We provide an international, multidisciplinary agreement state-
ment on FAI syndrome. Key messages from this agreement are
summarised in a linked infographic.84 The term ‘FAI syn-
drome’ emphasises the fact that the patients in discussion are
symptomatic, suffering from a clinical disorder that is charac-
terised by a triad of symptoms, clinical signs and radiological
findings.
