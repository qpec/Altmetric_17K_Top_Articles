To inform public health recommendations for adolescent sleep, the amounts of sleep associated with the high-
est levels of academic achievement and mental health were examined. The degree to which daily variability in
sleep duration represents an underappreciated but functionally significant sleep behavior also was tested. A
total of 421 adolescents (Mage = 15.03 years) with Mexican-American backgrounds reported nightly sleep
times for 2 weeks; approximately 80% repeated the same protocol 1 year later. Multilevel modeling indicated
that the amount of sleep associated with the lowest levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms was
more than 1 hr greater than the amount associated with the highest levels of academic performance. Greater
daily variability in sleep duration predicted greater symptomatology and mixed academic outcomes.
Despite
near-universal
professional
agreement
about the critical importance of sleep for adolescent
health and development (Carskadon, 2011; Carska-
don, Acebo, & Jenni, 2004; Dahl & Harvey, 2007;
Gregory & Sadeh, 2012), the empirical basis for
specific public health recommendations for adoles-
cents has been a matter of debate. Historical analy-
ses documenting large changes in recommendations
over time have been seen by some as evidence that
guidelines are based more on shared opinion than
objective evidence, although others have disagreed
(Matricciani, Olds, Blunden, Rigney, & Williams,
2012; Owens, 2012). The use of “free-sleep” studies
that allow small, select samples of youth to sleep as
much as they desire to determine the amount of
sleep that adolescents need has been criticized (Eide
& Showalter, 2012; Matricciani, Blunden, Rigney,
Williams, & Olds, 2013). Observers increasingly
have called for a stronger empirical basis for sleep
recommendations, particularly studies that focus on
functioning by comparing adolescent adjustment
across differing amounts of sleep (Blunden & Gal-
land, 2014; Feinberg, 2013; Feinberg & Campbell,
2012; Matricciani et al., 2013).
Given that both low and high sleep durations
have been linked with compromised functioning
(e.g., lower school performance and higher depres-
sion), some have called for studies of “optimal”
sleep
that
examine
the
nonlinear
associations
between sleep duration and functioning in order to
determine the amount of sleep at which peak func-
tioning is observed (Feinberg, 2013; Matricciani
et al., 2013). Along these lines, Eide and Showalter
(2012) determined that the highest performance on
standardized
tests
among
16-year-olds
was
observed among high school students who aver-
aged
7.02–7.36 hr
of
sleep
per
night—approxi-
mately 1–3 hr less than most commonly promoted
recommendations of 8–10 hr (National Sleep Foun-
dation, 2016).
We endeavored to contribute to the critical dia-
log about sleep guidelines for youth in two distinct
ways. First, we wished to examine “optimal” sleep
simultaneously for two key aspects of adolescent
functioning:
academic
achievement
and
mental
health. The approximately 7 hours of sleep obtained
by the highest achieving students in the study by
Eide and Showalter (2012) may come at a cost to
mental health, which has been consistently linked

 to sleep (Dahl & Harvey, 2007; Gregory & Sadeh,
2012). Therefore, although we predicted to find a
similar curvilinear association between sleep dura-
tion and achievement as reported by Eide and
Schowalter, we expected the “optimal” level of
mental health to be observed among adolescents
who slept more than their highest achieving peers.
Second, we wished to add the concept of sleep vari-
ability—day-to-day
intraindividual
variation
in
sleep duration—to the ongoing discussion on sleep
recommendations for youth. The almost exclusive
focus on sleep duration as the target of clinical
guidelines may lead those concerned with adoles-
cent health to neglect a key aspect of sleep behavior
that could be just as consequential for functioning
(Bei, Wiley, Trinder, & Manber, 2016; Blunden &
Galland, 2014). Frequently shifting the circadian
rhythm and creating continuous gaps between cir-
cadian and sleep–wake cycles have been associated
with several physical and psychological difficulties
(Fuligni & Hardway, 2006; Levandovski et al., 2011;
Wittmann, Dinich, Merrow, & Roenneberg, 2006).
As such, we expected greater day-to-day variability
in sleep duration to be predictive of poorer func-
tioning above and beyond the average amount of
sleep received by youth.
Method
Sample
A total of 421 adolescents (Mage = 15.03 years,
SD = 0.83) were recruited from the 9th and 10th
grades of two high schools in the Los Angeles area
to participate in a study of Mexican-American fami-
lies during the 2009–2010 academic year. The final
sample represented 63% of the adolescents whose
parents were reached by phone and who were
deemed eligible to participate by self-reporting a
Mexican ethnic background. Using contact informa-
tion obtained from participants at the first wave of
the study, youth were recruited to participate in a
second wave of data collection 1 year later. A total
of 341 adolescents took part in the second wave of
the study (81% of the original sample).
The sample of adolescents was balanced accord-
ing to gender (50% female) and the majority of the
parents reported completing at most some high
school education at the first wave of the study (66.7%
less than a high school degree, 7.6% high school
degree only, 5.5% trade or vocational school, and
18.8% at least some college). Most of the parents
were foreign born (82.4%), whereas most of the ado-
lescents were born in the United States (87.2%).
Data from this study were used in a previously
published article on the daily concordance between
parent and adolescent sleep
behaviors
(Fuligni,
Tsai, Krull, & Gonzales, 2015).
Procedures
All procedures were reviewed and approved by
the UCLA Institutional Review Board. Classrooms
were randomly selected for home mailings and vis-
its by research staff at different times across the
school year, followed up by calls to the families to
determine
their
eligibility
(i.e.,
having
Mexican
background) and interest in the study. Once fami-
lies were deemed interested and eligible, interview-
ers
visited
families’
homes
where
adolescents
completed a self-report questionnaire that assessed
various aspects of their adjustment. Primary care-
givers (83% mothers, 13% fathers, and 4% other rel-
atives)
reported
demographic
information
and
provided consent for their adolescents, who in turn
provided their own assent. At the end of each
school year, adolescents’ course grades, standard-
ized
test
scores,
and
attendance
records
were
obtained from their official school records.
Adolescents were provided with a set of 14 daily
checklists to be completed privately and indepen-
dently each night before going to bed at each wave
of the study. Checklists were three pages long, took
5–10 min
to
complete,
and
included
questions
about nightly sleep. Upon completion, participants
folded and sealed the diary checklist, stamping the
seal with an electronic time stamper. Interviewers
called participants during the 2-week period in
order to answer questions and encourage compli-
ance. Diary checklists were picked up from the
home at the end of the 2-week period, when adoles-
cents and parents were given $30 for their partici-
pation. Additionally, participants were told at the
beginning of the study that they would receive an
additional incentive of two free movie passes if
inspection of the data indicated that the participants
had completed the diaries correctly and on time
(i.e., before noon on the following day). Compliance
was high, with adolescents completing an average
of 96% of their potential diaries.
Measures
Sleep
School
night
sleep
duration.
We focused on
school night sleep duration, as that is the time of
greatest restriction of adolescent sleep and is found to
Sleep and Peak Achievement, Mental Health

 be similar to previous studies of “optimal” sleep that
focused on weeknight sleep (Eide & Showalter, 2012).
As described next, we also included a separate mea-
sure of the difference between school night and non-
school night sleep to examine the additive predictive
value of sleep on nonschool nights (e.g., weekend).
Sleep duration was the number of hours adoles-
cents’ gave in response to the following question on
the daily checklist: “How much time did you sleep
last night?” The question is typically used in sleep
diary studies, and responses are moderately corre-
lated with sleep estimates obtained from more
objective methods, such as wrist actigraphy (Gillen-
O’Neel, Huynh, & Fuligni, 2012; Lockley, Skene, &
Arendt, 1999; Wolfson et al., 2003). In order to min-
imize
errors
of
estimation,
adolescents
also
responded to two additional questions: “What time
did you go to bed last night?” and “What time did
you wake up this morning?” Reports to the sleep
duration question (i.e., “How much time did you
sleep last night”) averaged 0.11 and 0.21 hr less
than the reported interval between bed and wake
times for Waves 1 and 2, respectively, suggesting
that youth were reporting the time they believed
they actually were asleep. Any report of sleep dura-
tion that extended beyond the interval between the
reported bed and wake times were recoded to be
equal to the duration between the bed and wake
time, but that was necessary for only small minor-
ity of days (e.g., 10% of days at Wave 1). Sleep
durations at Waves 1 and 2 were significantly asso-
ciated at r = .32, p < .001.
Official school calendars were referenced to cre-
ate a dummy-coded school night/nonschool night
variable (school night = 0, nonschool night = 1),
which was then used to predict nightly sleep in a
multilevel model in which both intercepts and
slopes
were
allowed
to
randomly
vary
across
waves and individuals. Output from this model
was used to calculate the empirical best linear unbi-
ased predictor of “average” school night sleep (i.e.,
the individual-specific intercept at each wave).
School/nonschool night sleep difference.
Output
from the multilevel model referenced above was
also used to calculate the empirical best linear unbi-
ased predictor of the difference between a person’s
“average” school and nonschool night sleep dura-
tion
(i.e.,
the
individual-specific
slope
at
each
wave). More positive scores indicate greater sleep
on nonschool nights. This indicator allowed us to
examine whether additional (or less) sleep on non-
school nights (e.g., weekends) provided additional
predictive ability of adjustment beyond just school
night sleep.
Nightly sleep variability.
Variability of the Level
1 residuals from the multilevel model referenced
above across a maximum 14 days for each adoles-
cent at each wave was calculated to reflect nightly
sleep variability, after accounting for a person’s
school night/nonschool night difference to remove
the effect of that significant structural source of
sleep variability from the nightly variability esti-
mate. The indicator was a squared metric of the
average number of hours of variability for each
adolescent.
Academic Achievement
Grade
point
average.
Official
school
records
were obtained from each school at the end of the aca-
demic year of each wave of data collection. Grades
were coded (F = 0, D = 1, C = 2, B = 3, and A = 4)
and averaged for a composite grade point average
(GPA). A majority of students enrolled in similar aca-
demic levels (e.g., remedial, regular, or AP/honors)
of English, social studies, and science courses (65%–
74% were in the same level of courses, with the
modal enrollment being a regular level). The levels
of mathematics classes varied more across students,
as is typical during the high school years, with the
modal enrollment being regular levels of Algebra I in
9th grade, geometry in 10th grade, and Algebra II in
11th grade. Grades were not weighted or standard-
ized according to course level because students who
enrolled in higher level courses typically earned
higher grades than those in the lower level classes.
GPA showed high stability between Waves 1 and 2
(r = .77, p < .001).
Standardized test scores.
Students’ scores on the
California Standards Test in mathematics and Eng-
lish were obtained from official school records. At
the time of the study, these tests were administered
to all 9th-, 10th-, and 11th-grade students in the
state of California to measure student progress
toward state standards in mathematics and English
language arts. All students at a particular grade
level took the same English test, and students took
mathematics tests in accord with the specific mathe-
matics course in which they were enrolled (predom-
inantly Algebra I in 9th grade, geometry in 10th
grade, and Algebra II in 11th grade). Test scores
were moderately stable across Waves 1 and 2 (Eng-
lish: r = .52, math: r = .46, ps < .001).
Attendance.
The
percent
of
possible
school
days that students officially attended school was
computed from school records. Attendance percent-
ages at Waves 1 and 2 were significantly associated
at r = .56, p < .001.

 Internalizing and Externalizing Symptoms
Adolescents completed the widely used Youth
Self-Report form of the Child Behavior Checklist
(Achenbach, 1991). Responses (0 = not true of me,
1 = somewhat or sometimes true of me, 2 = true or often
true of me) to the 31 items comprising the internaliz-
ing subscale (e.g., “I cry a lot,” “I worry a lot”) and
the 32 items comprising the externalizing subscale
(e.g., “I break rules at home, school, or elsewhere,”
“I get in many fights”) were summed. The total
score, which was a summation of all of the sub-
scales,
also
was
computed.
Symptomatology
showed moderate stability between Waves 1 and 2
(internalizing: r = .58, externalizing: r = .58, total:
r = .62, ps < .001).
Results
Attrition Analyses
Adolescents who participated only in Wave 1
had a lower GPA (M = 1.49, SD = 1.11) and per-
centage of school attendance (M = 92.33, SD = 8.74)
than peers who took part in both waves (Ms = 2.24,
94.29,
SDs = 0.89,
6.00,
respectively),
ts
(426,409) = �2.85, �2.69, ps = .005, .007. Attrition
was not related to the sleep indicators, California
Standards Test scores, or symptomatology.
Analysis Plan
Given that the question of “optimal” sleep gener-
ally centers on contemporaneous associations between
sleep and adolescent functioning (Eide & Showalter,
2012; Matricciani et al., 2013), our analyses focused on
the cross-sectional associations between sleep esti-
mates for a particular year and academic achievement
and mental health during the same year. Our acceler-
ated longitudinal design allowed us to make our esti-
mates across 3 years of high school (9th, 10th, and
11th grades) when sleep restriction increases for ado-
lescents (Carskadon, 2011). Adolescents who began
the study in the 9th grade contributed to the 9th- and
10th-grade estimates, and those who began the study
in the 10th grade contributed to the 10th- and 11th-
grade estimates.
Given the multilevel nature of the data (i.e.,
waves within individuals), SAS PROC MIXED V9.4
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used to estimate
the associations between the outcomes of interest
and the sleep predictors of sleep duration, school
night/nonschool night difference, and within-indivi-
dual
variability.
The
estimation
procedure
accommodates the missing data inherent in repeated
measures designs, allowing for the inclusion of par-
ticipants
with
incomplete
data.
Two-level
(i.e.,
waves nested within individuals) hierarchical mod-
els with random intercepts to accommodate corre-
lated errors were conducted for each outcome.
Because participants were from only two schools,
school was included as a predictor rather than defin-
ing a higher level of aggregation in this model. Each
of the sleep predictors was centered to avoid issues
with multicollinearity and facilitate interpretations.
Descriptive Statistics
Two-level multilevel models with grade and gen-
der were used in order to estimate average levels of
sleep, achievement, and symptomatology pooled
across both waves of the study. As shown in
Table 1, adolescent 9th-grade boys averaged 8.13 hr
of sleep per school night, and this declined in the
10th (8.00 hr) and 11th (7.93 hr) grades. The aver-
age
school
night/nonschool
night
difference
in
sleep was a little more than 1 hr, and this declined
across high school (10th grade: 0.85 hr, 11th grade:
0.60 hr). Taking the square root of the estimate for
individual variability in Table 1 indicates that even
after accounting for the average school night/non-
school night difference, adolescent 9th-grade boys
varied the nightly duration of their sleep an aver-
age of 1.40 hr across the 2-week period, and this
did not differ across grades. No gender differences
were evident in sleep duration and variability.
As shown in Table 2, GPA averaged around the
equivalent of a “C” and average test scores fell
between the state cutoff of 300 for a “Basic” or lim-
ited level of performance and 350 for a “Proficient”

 level of performance. Girls evidenced significantly
higher GPAs (2.41), lower levels of attendance
(92.99%), and higher total (47.49) and internalizing
(14.02) Youth Self-Report scores. The only grade
differences were the significantly lower mathemat-
ics test scores among the 10th- (278.64) and 11th-
grade (266.19) students.
Sleep Duration
We first estimated the linear and nonlinear associ-
ations of sleep duration with achievement and symp-
tomatology. Linear, quadratic, and cubic terms for
sleep duration were used along with gender, grade,
school, and parental education as controls. If higher
order terms (i.e., quadratic, cubic) were not signifi-
cant, the models were reestimated without those
terms. If cubic trends were found significant, quartic
terms were checked, but none were significant. Final
models are reported in Table 3. When significant
nonlinear associations were observed, partial deriva-
tives of the regression equations were obtained and
used to determine the sleep duration values associ-
ated with verified relative maxima or minima. Confi-
dence intervals around these sleep duration values
were constructed using standard errors produced via
delta method approximation of the distribution of
the function for the turning points.
In terms of achievement, results indicated nonlin-
ear associations of sleep duration with GPA and
English test scores (quadratic and cubic, respec-
tively, Columns 1 and 2). No association was evi-
dent for mathematics test scores (Column 3), and a
linear, negative association emerged for attendance
such that greater sleep was associated with lower
attendance (Column 4). Figure 1 displays the non-
linear
associations
in
graphical
form,
with
the
achievement measures converted to standard devia-
tion units to allow for comparisons. Additionally,
the figure includes the point estimates of amount of
sleep at which the highest levels of achievement are
observed for the two nonlinear associations (i.e.,
English test, GPA); these point estimates are also
shown in Table 4. Peak performance was evident at
a little past 7 hr for English test scores and about
7.5 hr for GPA.
The results for symptomatology are shown in
Table 3, Columns 5 through 7. Significant nonlinear
associations were observed for total scores (quadra-
tic) and internalizing (cubic), and a marginally signif-
icant quadratic trend was evident for externalizing.
These results are displayed in Figure 2, with the
symptomatology measures converted to standard
deviation units. Estimates varied slightly across the
indicators, but the amount of sleep associated with
lowest levels of symptomatology ranged from 8.75 to
9 hr per school night (also see Table 4).
To better compare the findings for achievement
and symptomatology, the results for one measure
of each (i.e., GPA and internalizing) are presented
together in Figure 3. The figure demonstrates two
important differences in the implications of sleep
duration for achievement and internalizing symp-
toms. First, the “optimal” sleep for mental health is
more than 1 hr per night than the “optimal” sleep
for achievement. Second, the implications of sleep
for mental health appear greater, with the sleep
duration in Figure 1 accounting for twice the range
between the peak and nadir levels of internalizing
symptoms (approximately 0.5 SDs) as compared to
GPA (approximately 0.2 SDs). As another way to
demonstrate this second point, decreasing sleep
from the optimum level for internalizing to the
optimum level for GPA results in an approximately
0.2 SD rise in internalizing symptoms. In contrast,
increasing sleep from the optimum level for GPA to
the
optimum
level
for
internalizing
results
in
approximately 0.1 SD loss in GPA. Additionally,

 Table 4
demonstrates
how
the
95%
confidence
intervals for GPA and internalizing do not overlap.
Finally, Table 5 shows the percentage of youth
in the sample who reported average sleep durations
that fell within various time ranges of the estimated
optima
for
achievement
and
symptomatology.
Approximately 24%–27% of the sample reported
sleep times that fell within � 30 min of the esti-
mated optimum for achievement outcomes and
32%–38% had sleep durations that fell within the
same range of the optimum for symptomatology.
Follow-up models that included relevant interac-
tion terms indicated that the linear and nonlinear
associations of sleep duration with achievement
and symptomatology did not significantly vary
across gender or grade.
Sleep Variability
The additive predictive ability of sleep variability
above and beyond duration was estimated by add-
ing the linear, quadratic, and cubic terms for daily
sleep variability to the duration models described
above. The difference in duration between school
and nonschool nights was also included in the mod-
els in order to determine whether daily variability
made a difference above and beyond this significant
structural source of variability. As stated earlier, if
higher order terms (i.e., quadratic, cubic) were not
significant, the models were reestimated without
those terms. Initial models included the same predic-
tors as those in the duration models shown in
Table 3, but nonsignificant predictors were trimmed
from the final model that is reported in Table 6.
Sleep
variability
predicted
achievement
and
symptomatology above and beyond sleep duration
for
five
of
the
seven
indicators
(see
Table 6).
Greater daily variability was linearly associated
with higher scores on English tests (Column 2) but
lower rates of attendance (Column 4). Daily vari-
ability also predicted more symptomatology on all
three indicators (Columns 5, 6, and 7). A greater
difference between school and nonschool day sleep
marginally predicted higher mathematics test scores
and significantly predicted better attendance and
higher total scores of symptomatology. None of the
higher order effects of variability were significant
and are not included in the table.
Discussion
Our results indicate that the “optimal” sleep dura-
tion differs for different developmental outcomes,

Sleep and Peak Achievement, Mental Health

 as suggested by recent observers (Blunden & Gal-
land, 2014; Matricciani et al., 2013). Peak levels of
mental health were evident among those averaging
8.75–9 hr per school night, an amount consistent
with commonly promoted existing sleep guidelines
(National Sleep Foundation, 2016). The highest level
of academic performance was evident at sleep dura-
tions (7–7.5 hr) about 1 to 3 hr shorter than the
guidelines, the same durations observed by Eide
and Showalter (2012). Clearly, there are trade offs
in the optimal sleep for different aspects of adoles-
cent health and adjustment (Blunden & Galland,
2014; Matricciani et al., 2013). At the same time, it
is important to note that our results suggest that
reducing sleep for the sake of academic perfor-
mance may result in a greater decline in mental
health than the decline in academic performance

 resulting from increasing sleep for the sake of men-
tal health. The tighter association of sleep with
symptomatology may have been due to both mea-
sures being obtained from the same reporter at
roughly the same period of time, but the findings
suggest mental health may be more sensitive to
variations in sleep duration than academic achieve-
ment.
Daily variability in sleep duration proved to be
consequential for adjustment above and beyond
average sleep duration, consistent with some previ-
ous research (Bei et al., 2016; Fuligni & Hardway,
2006). Greater variation in sleep time across days
predicted greater internalizing and externalizing
symptoms, whereas the implications for achieve-
ment were fewer and more mixed. The fact that
more variable adolescents received
both higher
English test scores and greater symptoms suggests
that these may be high achieving students with
somewhat elevated levels of distress, with negative
implications for their daily school attendance. The
absence of nonlinear associations indicated that
more variability had greater implications for adjust-
ment, with no change in the magnitude or direction
of the association according to the amount of vari-
ability. Findings for the difference between school
night and nonschool night sleep, which may be
considered an indication of “catch up” sleep on
nonschool nights (e.g., weekends), showed similarly
mixed associations with a larger difference being
associated with greater overall symptomatology but
better attendance and marginally higher math test
scores.
It is unclear whether our findings may be limited
to
only
youth
from
Mexican-American
back-
grounds. Some studies have suggested that Mexi-
can-American adolescents may sleep about one
third of an hour more each night than their Euro-
pean-American peers (Fuligni & Hardway, 2006),
but a national study did not observe more or less
sleep among Hispanic youth (Adam, Snell, & Pen-
dry, 2007). Additionally, our findings regarding
achievement closely mirrored those obtained by
Eide and Showalter (2012) in a national sample of
ethnically
diverse
youth.
Nevertheless,
potential
group
differences
in
both
sleep
behaviors
and
indices of adolescent adjustment such as achieve-
ment and symptomatology necessitate the replica-
tion
of
these
analyses
with
adolescents
from
multiple ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.
For example, studies reporting that African Ameri-
can youth obtain significantly less sleep than their
peers raise the possibility that results may differ for
those adolescents (Adam et al., 2007; Matthews,
Hall, & Dahl, 2014).
We did not assess the role of pubertal status,
which is known to be linked with both sleep pat-
terns and mental health (Dahl & Lewin, 2001).
Although we documented official school days, we
did not know whether other scheduled events (e.g.,
medical
appointments,
extracurricular
activities)
may have contributed to the variability in sleep
times across the days. It also would be important to
determine whether our findings generalize to clini-
cal samples of adolescents, who sometimes show
different patterns and correlates of sleep indices
(Johnson et al., 2007).
We unfortunately did not have actigraphy mea-
sures of sleep and do not know whether our sam-
ple’s diary reports over- or underestimated sleep
duration compared to actigraphy. Previous studies
have suggested moderate correlations between the
two methods during adolescence (e.g., r = .58; Mat-
thews et al., 2014), suggesting similarities in the
rank ordering of youth for the type of predictive
analyses done in this article. Some studies have
suggested that diary reports produce higher sleep
duration estimates (Arora, Broglia, Pushpakumar,
Lodhi, & Taheri, 2013; Matthews et al., 2014; Short,
Gradisar, Lack, Wright, & Carskadon, 2012). The
difference may be due to higher wake-after-sleep
onset (WASO) estimates from actigraphy, which
can be difficult for adolescents to report themselves.
Yet, the difference also may be due to an overesti-
mation of WASO by actigraphy, even when com-
pared
to
polysomnography,
due
to
greater
movement
during
sleep
among
adolescents

 (Johnson et al., 2007; Short et al., 2012). Therefore,
the degree to which a lower sleep duration estimate
obtained from actigraphy is definitively more accu-
rate than a sleep diary estimate is unclear. This is
particularly true for Mexican-American adolescents,
for whom there has been little, if any, research com-
paring the two methods. Continued research on the
question of optimal sleep needs to encompass mul-
tiple methods of assessment in order to best trian-
gulate on the ranges of sleep durations to inform
public health recommendations.
Our somewhat restricted age range likely pre-
vented us from detecting potential age differences
in optimal sleep, as was found by Eide and Showal-
ter (2012), with their larger, national sample. Never-
theless, our results for the optimal sleep duration
for
achievement
at
this
age
(around
15 years)
among our sample of Mexican-American youth
match those obtained in that national sample. We
also were able to assess a richer array of outcome
measures with strong measurement qualities and
our inclusion of GPA adds to previous findings by
showing the implications of sleep for students’ per-
formance in their actual coursework as well as on
standardized tests. Our use of daily reporting of
sleep for a 14-day period resulted in more represen-
tative measurement of naturalistic sleep duration
and allowed us to estimate daily variability in dura-
tion, the latter of which is generally unavailable in
currently available large-scale surveys. Finally, it
should be noted that the cross-sectional associations
estimated in our study cannot determine the direc-
tion of causality between sleep and adjustment. Yet
our analyses do provide valuable information given
the lack of studies that experimentally vary the
amount of adolescent sleep across a range of dura-
tions.
Studies that respond to the call for examining
nonlinear associations between sleep and function-
ing can strengthen the empirical basis for public
health recommendations for sleep duration during
adolescence (Blunden & Galland, 2014; Feinberg &
Campbell,
2012;
Matricciani
et al.,
2013).
Such
efforts can avoid problematic suggestions that more
sleep is always preferable and attainable, providing
potentially more realistic sleep targets that are
based upon the actual daily lives of youth and their
families. At the same time, no single study such as
ours should be interpreted as being the definitive
source for obtaining an exact amount of optimal
sleep for adolescents. Continued research across
multiple aspects of adjustment, ages, and popula-
tions is necessary before strong conclusions can be
made. We suspect that the collective evidence will

Fuligni, Arruda, Krull, and Gonzales
 be consistent with the emergent trend of recom-
mending ranges of sleep durations rather than exact
targets (National Sleep Foundation, 2016). Such
empirically based ranges could allow adolescents
and their families to set goals that fit their daily
lives and maximize their functioning across multi-
ple facets of health and adjustment.
In conclusion, efforts to develop sleep guidelines
that take into account “optimal” sleep need to con-
sider the possibility that there are trade offs of dif-
ferent
amounts
of
sleep
duration
for
different
developmental outcomes. In particular, reductions
of sleep for the sake of incremental gains in aca-
demic performance could have negative implica-
tions for mental health. Additionally, promoting
healthy sleep behaviors for the sake of improved
mental health should include efforts to minimize
the variation in adolescents’ sleep duration across
their daily life.
