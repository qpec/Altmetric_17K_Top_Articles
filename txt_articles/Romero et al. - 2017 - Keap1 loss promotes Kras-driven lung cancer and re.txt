Abstract
Treating KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge in cancer 
treatment given the difficulties associated with directly inhibiting the KRAS oncoprotein1. One 
approach to addressing this challenge is to define frequently co-occurring mutations with KRAS, 
which themselves may lead to therapeutic vulnerabilities in tumors. Approximately 20% of 
KRAS-mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in Kelch-like ECH-
associated protein 1 (KEAP1)2-4, a negative regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 
(NFE2L2; hereafter NRF2), which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous 
antioxidant response5-10. The high frequency of mutations in KEAP1 suggests an important role 
for the oxidative stress response in lung tumorigenesis. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach in a 
mouse model of Kras-driven LUAD we examined the effects of Keap1 loss in lung cancer 
progression. We show that loss of Keap1 hyper-activates Nrf2 and promotes Kras-driven LUAD. 
Combining CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolomic analyses, we show that 
Keap1/Nrf2-mutant cancers are dependent on increased glutaminolysis, and this property can be 
therapeutically exploited through the pharmacological inhibition of glutaminase. Finally, we 
provide a rationale for sub-stratification of human lung cancer patients with KRAS-KEAP1 or -
NRF2-mutant tumors as likely to respond to glutaminase inhibition.
Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of lung cancer have greatly assisted in the 
functional characterization of genes implicated in human lung cancers. The KrasLSL-G12D/+; 
p53flox/flox (KP) GEMM of human LUAD faithfully mimics human KRAS-driven LUAD, 
displaying similarities at the molecular and histopathological level following intratracheal 
administration of viral vectors expressing Cre-recombinase11. We recently developed a 
CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo genome engineering method to rapidly interrogate putative 
genetic driver events cooperating with oncogenic Kras to promote lung tumorigenesis in the 
KP model12-14.
Based on the fact that KEAP1 is the third most frequently mutated gene in LUAD and on the 
high coincidence of KEAP1 inactivating mutations and KRAS-mutation in human lung 
cancers3, we chose to target this gene in the KP model using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. KP 
mice were intratracheally infected with pSECC lentiviral vectors expressing sgRNAs against 
Keap1 or tdTomato as a control (Supplementary Fig 1a). Mice infected with pSECC vectors 
expressing different sgRNAs targeting Keap1 (hereafter, sgKeap1 mice) had significantly 
increased tumor burden and faster growth kinetics compared to sgTom mice, as determined 
by longitudinal micro-computed tomography (micro-CT; p < 0.05, Fig 1a). Consistent with 
the micro-CT data, histological assessment of tumor burden revealed a significant increase 
in sgKeap1 mice compared to controls (p < 0.05, Fig 1b). This analysis also showed a 
dramatic increase in high-grade tumors in sgKeap1 mice compared to controls (Fig 1c and 
Supplementary Fig 1b, p < 0.0001 for sgKeap1.2 grade 3 and p < 0.001 for sgKeap1.4 grade

 4). Furthermore, sgKeap1 tumors displayed increased proliferation as gauged by an increase 
in mitotic index (phospho-Histone H3; p < 0.05, Fig 1d).
To determine the status of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in sgKeap1 tumors, we performed 
immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses to assess whether loss of Keap1 led to both increased 
nuclear localization of Nrf2 protein and cytoplasmic levels of its target gene Nad(p)h 
dehydrogenase quinone 1 (Nqo1). The majority (60%) of sgKeap1 tumors had increased 
nuclear localization of Nrf2 and dramatically higher levels of Nqo1 as compared to controls 
(p < 0.0001, Fig 1e,f). Importantly, nearly all tumors that stained positively for nuclear Nrf2 
also contained higher levels of Nqo1 (p < 0.0001, Fig 1e). Furthermore, the increased levels 
of Nrf2 in sgKeap1 tumors correlated with significantly lower ROS-dependent oxidation of 
DNA as compared to control sgTom tumors (Fig 1g). High throughput DNA sequencing of 
micro-dissected sgKeap1 tumors (sgKeap1.2 and sgKeap1.4) that stained positively for 
nuclear Nrf2 and Nqo1 revealed that these tumors predominantly contained frameshift LOF 
insertions or deletions (indels) in Keap1, supporting the IHC analysis indicating Nrf2 
pathway activation (Supplementary Fig 1c-e). Additionally, we observed a clonal enrichment 
of such Keap1 LOF alleles in a lymph node metastasis compared to its paired primary 
tumor15,16 (Supplementary Fig 1f-h).
We next asked if NQO1 could act as a marker for NRF2 activated human KEAP1/NRF2 
mutant LUAD tumors. Targeted exome capture (top 50 mutated LUAD genes based on 
TCGA3) of 88 LUAD tumors from the NYU Center for Biospecimen Research and 
Development identified 10 KEAP1 (11%), and 2 NRF2 (2%) mutant tumors, as well as a 
significant correlation between KEAP1/ NRF2 mutations and increased NQO1 staining 
(Figure 1h; p = 0.0002; Supplementary Table 1). These data suggest that NQO1 is a suitable 
biomarker for NRF2 activation in human LUAD.
To determine the role of Nrf2 and Keap1 in regulating proliferation and antioxidant 
pathways in LUAD, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to develop isogenic 
KP-derived lung tumor cell lines with LOF mutations in Nrf2 (KPN), Keap1 (KPK), and 
sgTom controls (KP) (Supplementary Fig 2a,b; n = 2 cell lines per genotype). As expected, 
KPK cells had increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 and increased levels of Nrf2 
transcriptional targets as assessed by both protein analysis (Gclc; Supplementary Fig 2c) and 
gene expression analysis (Nqo1, Hmox1 and Gclc; Supplementary Fig 2d). These changes 
were also observed in KP but not KPN cells upon treatment with Nrf2 activators 
(Supplementary Fig 2e-h). To validate these results, we performed whole transcriptome 
analyses (RNA sequencing) and identified transcriptional signatures that clearly 
distinguished KP from KPK cell lines based on the activation of the Nrf2 transcriptional 
program (Supplementary Fig 2i; Supplementary Table 2).
We next used this panel of genetically-defined cell lines to further explore the role of the 
Nrf2/Keap1 pathway in regulating the antioxidant response program. KPN cells had 
dramatically decreased cell viability in response to multiple agents known to cause oxidative 
stress compared to KP cells. By contrast, KPK cells showed resistance to all agents tested 
(Supplementary Fig 3a-e). These effects correlated with the total levels of the major cellular 
antioxidant glutathione in the different cell lines (Supplementary Fig 3f,g). The loss of

 viability of KPN cells in response to oxidative stress agents was rescued by antioxidant 
treatments (Supplementary Fig 3h) or by ectopic expression of a gain-of-function (GOF) 
allele of Nrf217 (KPN-ix; Supplementary Fig 3i-o). Consistent with these results, both 
mouse and human Keap1/KEAP1-mutant cells displayed markedly lower ROS levels 
compared to wild-type (WT) cells (Supplementary Fig 3p,q). Interestingly, KPK cells grew 
faster than KP cells in vivo but not in vitro (Supplementary Fig 4a-f), suggesting a 
differential requirement of the Nrf2-antioxidant response during tumorigenesis in vivo. In 
addition, loss of Keap1/KEAP1 in tumors and cells with WT p5318 accelerated 
tumorigenesis and growth suggesting that Keap1 is a tumor suppressor in lung cancer 
progression independent of p53 mutation status (Supplementary Fig 5a-p). These data 
indicate that Nrf2 levels dictate the differential antioxidant response to oxidative stress, 
which may provide a selective growth advantage in vivo.
To assess the relevance of these data derived from GEMM studies for human lung cancer, 
we performed an integrative analysis using a dataset of human LUAD patient samples (n = 
548) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)3, published Nrf2 datasets7,19,20 and our 
GEMM-derived Nrf2-driven transcriptional signature. First, we derived a core signature of 
108 high confidence NRF2 target genes (Supplementary Table 3) using published datasets. 
TCGA human LUAD tumors across various disease stages were investigated; the core NRF2 
target genes were significantly upregulated in tumors from advanced stage IV disease (p = 
0.028, Fig 2a). Additionally, patients whose tumors were most associated with the NRF2 
core target signature had significantly worse survival when compared to the rest of the 
TCGA LUAD cohort (p = 0.008, Fig 2b). In order to evaluate the association between 
KEAP1 mutations and NRF2 pathway activation, we used gene expression data from all 
TCGA human LUAD primary tumors to derive a KEAP1-mutant transcriptional signature 
(Supplementary Fig 6a). This signature was enriched in the core NRF2 target genes, 
multiple antioxidant pathways, and the NRF2 oncogenic signature18 (NFE2L2.V2; 
Supplementary Fig 6b,c and Supplementary Table 4). Ranking tumors by the strength of 
their correlation with this signature allowed for stratification of all LUAD TCGA patients 
into two sub-populations (n = 91 most-correlated 20%, n = 367 rest of the cohort). These 
sub-populations exhibited significantly different survival times (p = 0.012, Fig 2c). Similar 
results were observed within the set of KRAS-mutant patients (n = 24 most-correlated 20%, 
n = 99 rest of cohort, p = 0.00013; Supplementary Fig 6d). We did not observe significant 
co-occurrence of KEAP1-mutant and KRAS-mutant patients within the TCGA cohort (p = 
0.418). Additionally, within the top 20% of patients that correlate with our KEAP1-mutant 
signature and exhibit poor survival, we did not observe an enrichment for KRAS-mutant 
patients (p = 0.816) when compared to the background prevalence of KRAS-mutant patients 
in the TCGA cohort. Taken together, these data suggest that the poor survival of patients 
most correlated with the KEAP1-mutant signature cannot be attributed to an over-
representation of KRAS-mutant patients.
Furthermore, high grade tumors (grades III/IV) and late stage tumors (clinical stage IV 
disease) were significantly enriched for the human KEAP1-mutant transcriptional signature 
(Supplementary Fig 6e; grade III/IV: p = 0.02; Fig 2d stage IV: p = 0.038). Importantly, this 
signature was found to be independently prognostic in the TCGA LUAD cohort while 
controlling for other clinical covariates in a Cox proportional hazards model (HR = 1.22; 
Romero et al.

 univariate p = 0.029, multivariable p = 0.04, Supplementary Table 5) where higher 
enrichment for the signature was associated with significantly worse survival. We also did 
not detect an enrichment for TP53 mutated patients in the KEAP1-mutant signature 
correlated cohort. Likewise, we did not observe a significant co-occurrence of KEAP1-
mutant and TP53-mutant patients in the TCGA LUAD cohort (p = 0.115). To assess the 
translational potential of the GEMM results to human LUAD with KEAP1 mutations, we 
performed a cross-species comparison of the Keap1-mutant transcriptional signatures. The 
GEMM Keap1-mutant signature (Supplementary Fig 2i) was significantly enriched in the 
human KEAP1-mutant signature (Supplementary Fig 6f). Furthermore, the GEMM-based 
signature could also stratify human patients with significantly different survival times (with 
correlated patients showing poor survival (p = 0.003, Fig 2e)).
Having established the importance of KEAP1 mutations in mouse and human KRAS-driven 
LUAD, we sought to uncover potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in this genetic subtype of 
lung cancer. To this end, we performed a focused CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen to 
identify synthetic genetic interactions with Keap1 mutations. A pool of lentiviruses 
expressing a focused CRISPR/Cas9 library was engineered to express sgRNAs against a 
panel of Nrf2 transcriptional targets and genes implicated in the Nrf2 antioxidant response 
(17 genes and 3 controls, 3-4 sgRNAs/gene, 65 sgRNAs total, Supplementary Table 6 Fig 3a 
and Supplementary Fig 7a). We infected KP or KPK cell lines (n = 2 per genotype) and 
assessed the relative depletion of sgRNAs after 14 population doublings to identify genes in 
which mutations selectively affected the growth of KPK compared to KP cells in culture 
(average relative depletion score threshold <-0.3). Notably, out of 60 experimental sgRNAs 
across 17 genes, three out of four sgRNAs against solute carrier family 1 member 5 
(Slc1a5), a glutamine transporter21, fell below our threshold values and were depleted in 
KPK but not KP cells, suggesting that Slc1a5 mutation selectively impairs the growth of 
Keap1-mutant cells (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 7a). We next generated Slc1a5-mutant 
derivatives of KPK and human lung cancer cells with KRAS and KEAP1 mutations (A549 
and H2030). These cells displayed markedly decreased growth, while we observed no effect 
in Keap1-WT mouse (KP1, KP2) and human (H2009) cell lines upon mutation of Slc1a5 
(Fig 3b-d and Supplementary Fig 7b). Furthermore, KPK cell lines were more sensitive to 
GPNA, a small molecule inhibitor of Slc1a5, compared to KP cell lines (Fig 3e and 
Supplementary Fig 7c). The selective requirement of Slc1a5 function in KPK cell lines 
suggested a possible metabolic dependency of KPK cells on glutamine. Indeed, decreasing 
glutamine concentration in the media led to a robust suppression of growth in KPK cell lines 
with little effect on KP cell lines (Fig 3f and Supplementary Fig 7d). The dependency of 
KPK cell lines on Slc1a5 and glutamine could be via the fueling of the tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle in the context of an increased glycolytic state22. Consistent with this possibility, 
we found that both KPK cell lines had higher glucose (Supplementary Fig 7e) and glutamine 
consumption (Fig 3g) coupled with a marked increase in lactate excretion compared to KP 
cells (Supplementary Fig 7e). KPK cells also showed increased sensitivity to the glycolysis 
inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; Supplementary Fig 8a,b). In addition, isotopic carbon 
labeled glucose (U13-Glucose) tracing revealed decreased contribution of glucose-derived 
carbons to TCA cycle intermediates in KPK cells compared to KP controls (Supplementary

 Fig 8c-e), which is not due to differences in the expression of pyruvate carboxylase (Pcx) 
and glutamine synthetase (Glul) between KPK and KP cells (Supplementary Data Table 2).
We next investigated whether increased glutamine utilization in KPK cell lines could be 
exploited as a metabolic liability. As glutaminase is the rate-limiting enzyme for glutamine 
utilization in the cell14,23 (Fig 4a), we tested two small molecule inhibitors of glutaminase: 
BPTES and CB-83921, the latter which is currently in phase I clinical trials for KRAS-
mutant lung cancer (Fig 4a,b and Supplementary Fig 9a). KPK cells were markedly more 
sensitive to both drugs compared to KP cells (Fig 4c). In addition, a panel of human lung 
cancer cells containing KEAP1 or GOF-NRF2 mutations were sensitive to glutaminase 
inhibition while KEAP1-WT cells were largely resistant (Fig 4d and Supplementary Fig 9b). 
Interestingly, pretreatment of KPK cells with glutamate, pyruvate or cell permeable alpha-
ketoglutarate, but not the antioxidants Trolox or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), rescued CB-839 
sensitivity (Supplementary Fig 9c-f). These results suggest that glutaminase inhibition 
suppresses cell growth by blocking anaplerosis and not through loss of antioxidant 
production. To determine whether the sensitivity of KPK cells to glutaminase inhibition was 
dependent on hyperactive Nrf2 signaling, we transduced KP cells with lentiviruses 
expressing a GOF-Nrf2 allele (Supplementary Fig 3i-o; Supplementary Fig 10a,b; KP-ix). 
Expression of GOF-Nrf2 in KP cells led to increased sensitivity to CB-839 (Supplementary 
Fig 10c). In addition, genetic complementation of Keap1 in KPK cells reduced Nrf2 protein 
levels, expression of Nrf2 target genes, reversed the in vivo growth advantage of KPK cells, 
and rescued the viability of CB-839 treated KPK cells (Supplementary Fig 10d-g).
To investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting glutaminase in Keap1-mutant tumors in 
vivo, we transplanted KP and KPK cells subcutaneously and orthotopically (lung) in 
immunodeficient animals. Once tumors were established, we initiated treatment with either 
vehicle or CB-839 (Supplementary Fig 11a). Consistent with an earlier study14, we found 
that KP-derived tumors exhibited no response to CB-839 treatment (Fig 4e-g and 
Supplementary Fig 11b,c). By contrast, KPK-derived subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors 
had dramatically decreased growth and established smaller final tumor weights in response 
to CB-839 treatment (Fig 4e-g and Supplementary Fig 11b,c). Furthermore, transplanted 
KP-ix cells exhibited increased growth upon doxycycline-dependent induction of GOF-Nrf2, 
which was suppressed by glutaminase inhibition (Fig 4h and Supplementary Fig 11d). 
Finally, we demonstrated that glutaminase inhibition suppressed the in vivo growth of 
KRAS-driven human LUAD cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts with KEAP1 
mutations, but had no effect on the growth of KEAP1-WT tumors (Figure 4i; Supplementary 
Fig 11e-I; Supplementary Table 7). Taken together, these data suggest that glutaminase or 
other targets within this metabolic pathway are attractive therapeutic targets in Keap1/Nrf2-
mutant LUAD. Furthermore, rational stratification of patients harboring mutations in 
KEAP1 or NRF2 may predict treatment response to glutaminase inhibitors.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that Keap1 mutations activate the Nrf2 antioxidant program 
and cooperate with mutant Kras to drive LUAD progression, supporting the requirement for 
cancer cells to overcome oxidative stress barriers during tumorigenesis24-30. We hypothesize 
that the metabolic requirement for glutaminolysis in KEAP1/NRF2-mutant LUAD tumors 
may also present a therapeutic vulnerability in other cancers with genetic31-36,

 epigenetic37-39 or post-transcriptional17 alterations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway. A recent 
study demonstrated that KEAP1 loss potentiates resistance to multiple targeted therapies in 
EGFR- and RAS-driven cancers, highlighting the importance of our therapeutic strategy 
against KRAS-KEAP1-mutant lung cancer40. Furthermore, our findings provide unique 
insight into the therapeutic potential of targeting metabolic dependencies based on somatic 
variants by combining genetic and metabolic approaches to identify novel targets in 
translational oncology. Collectively, our study presents a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based 
precision medicine platform that can be used to characterize putative cooperating mutations 
and identify genotype-specific vulnerabilities in cancer.

 Figure 1. Loss of Keap1 stabilizes Nrf2 and accelerates lung tumorigenesis
a) Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) quantification of total tumor volume (mm3) of 
tumors from sgKeap1.4 (n = 5) or sgTom (n = 3) infected animals at 4 and 5 months post 
infection. b) Combined quantification of tumor burden (total tumor area/total lung area) in 
KrasLSL-G12D/+; p53fl/fl (KP) animals after infection with pSECC lentiviruses. Left panel: 
tumor burden 21 weeks post infection of animals infected with control sgTom (n = 3) or 
sgKeap1.2 (n = 7). Right panel: tumor burden 21 weeks post infection of animals infected 
with control sgTom (n = 6) or sgKeap1.4 (n = 5). The asterisks indicate statistical 
significance obtained from comparing KP-sgKeap1 samples to KP-sgTom samples. c) 
Distribution of histological tumor grades in KP animals 21 weeks after infection with 
pSECC lentiviruses expressing: control (sgTom, KP; n = 7 mice), sgKeap1.2 (KP; n = 3 
mice). d) Quantification of phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3) positive nuclei per mm2 to assess 
the mitotic index of tumor cells from lung tumors in KP animals 21 weeks after infection 
with pSECC lentiviruses expressing: control (sgTom, n = 14 tumors), or sgKeap1.2 (n = 50 
tumors). e) Contingency tables demonstrating correlation between nuclear Nrf2 expression 
and Nqo1 expression. Top panel: quantified tumors obtained from control sgTom infected 
mice. Bottom panel: quantified tumors obtained from sgKeap1.2 infected mice (two-sided 
Fisher's exact test, ****p < 0.0001). f) Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of serial sections from lung tumors of mice 21 weeks 
after infection with pSECC-sgTom (top panel) or pSECC-sgKeap1.2 (bottom panel). First 
panels: representative overall lung tumor burden. Second panel: higher magnification H&E 
of representative tumors. Third panel: Nuclear Nrf2 IHC. Fourth panel: Nqo1 IHC. Note the 
accumulation of Nrf2 and Nqo1 occurs only in tumors from pSECC-sgKeap1.2 mice. Inset 
represents higher magnification. Scale bars are 100um. g) Oxidative stress index as judged 
by % 8-oxo-dG positive nuclei (n = 10 per genotype). All error bars denote s.e.m. Obtained

 Figure 2. A NRF2 target gene signature and a human derived KEAP1-mutant and predict 
human LUAD patient survival
a) Empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) plot showing correlation of individual 
tumors with the NRF2 core target signature across various clinical stages within the TCGA 
LUAD cohort. Each curve in the plot represents a unique clinical stage as depicted in the 
figure legend. Clinical stage IV tumors (n = 24) are highly correlated with the NRF2 core 
target signature and are significantly different compared to lower stage I tumors (n = 251; p 
= 0.028; KS = Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). b) Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves 
comparing LUAD TCGA patients stratified by their correlation with the NRF2 core target 
signature. Patient tumor samples were binned according to their gene expression correlation 
with the NRF2 signature. The top 15% (n = 68) correlated tumors exhibit significantly 
decreased survival compared to the rest (n = 390) of the TCGA LUAD cohort (p = 0.008, 
log-rank test). c) KM survival curves comparing TCGA LUAD patients stratified by their 
correlation with the KEAP1-mutant signature derived from TCGA patient expression 
profiles. The top 20% correlated patients (n = 91) exhibit decreased survival compared to the 
rest (n = 367) of the TCGA LUAD cohort (p = 0.012, log-rank test). d) Empirical 
cumulative distribution function (CDF) plot showing expression correlation of individual

LUAD cohort. Each curve represents a unique clinical stage as depicted in the figure legend. 
Clinical stage IV tumors (n = 24) are highly correlated with the KEAP1-mutant signature 
and are significantly different compared to stage I tumors (n = 251; p = 0.038, 
KS=Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). e) KM survival curves comparing TCGA LUAD patients 
stratified by their correlation with the murine-derived Keap1-mutant signature. The top 50% 
correlated tumors (n = 229) exhibit significantly decreased survival compared to the rest (n = 
229) of the TCGA LUAD cohort (p < 0.003, log-rank test).
