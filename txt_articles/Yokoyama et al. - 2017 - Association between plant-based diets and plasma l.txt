Association between plant-based diets and plasma lipids:
a systematic review and meta-analysis
Yoko Yokoyama, Susan M. Levin, and Neal D. Barnard
Context: Although a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that
adoption of a vegetarian diet reduces plasma lipids, the association between vegetar-
ian diets and long-term effects on plasma lipids has not been subjected to meta-
analysis. Objective: The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of
observational studies and clinical trials that have examined associations between
plant-based diets and plasma lipids. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for articles published in
English until June 2015. Study Selection: The literature was searched for controlled tri-
als and observational studies that investigated the effects of at least 4 weeks of a vege-
tarian diet on plasma lipids. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted
the study methodology and sample size, the baseline characteristics of the study popu-
lation, and the concentrations and variance measures of plasma lipids. Mean differen-
ces in concentrations of plasma lipids between vegetarian and comparison diet groups
were calculated. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Results: Of the
8385 studies identified, 30 observational studies and 19 clinical trials met the inclusion
criteria (N¼ 1484; mean age, 48.6 years). Consumption of vegetarian diets was associ-
ated with lower mean concentrations of total cholesterol (�29.2 and �12.5mg/dL,
P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (�22.9 and �12.2mg/dL, P < 0.001),
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (�3.6 and �3.4mg/dL, P < 0.001), compared
with consumption of omnivorous diets in observational studies and clinical trials, re-
spectively. Triglyceride differences were �6.5 (P ¼ 0.092) in observational studies and
5.8mg/dL (P ¼ 0.090) in intervention trials. Conclusions: Plant-based diets are associ-
ated with decreased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not with decreased triglycerides. Systematic

INTRODUCTION
Elevated blood concentrations of low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with increased
risk of coronary heart disease. Although lowering LDL-
C concentrations can reduce cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality, hyperlipidemia is underdiagnosed and
undertreated.1 A 10% increase in the prevalence of

 treatment for hyperlipidemia could prevent an esti-
mated 8000 deaths per year.2 It has been further esti-
mated that even modest steps, such as those proposed
by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
Treatment Panel 3 primary prevention guidelines, could
prevent approximately 20 000 heart attacks and 10 000
deaths due to coronary heart disease and save almost $3
billion in heart disease-related medical costs per year.3
Although LDL-C has been the primary lipoprotein of
concern, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides also play roles in
heart disease risk, with TC, LDL-C, and triglycerides
positively associated with risk and HDL-C possibly
playing a protective role.4 Here, “plasma lipids” refers
to the group of lipids including TC, LDL-C, HDL-C,
and triglycerides.
Modifiable factors, including diet, weight, and
exercise, may play significant roles in developing
hyperlipidemia.5 Vegetarian diets are defined as diets
that exclude meats; some vegetarian diets include
dairy products and eggs. Vegetarian diets usually em-
phasize the consumption of fruits, vegetables, beans,
and grains. Previous reviews have suggested that vege-
tarian diets are associated with lower plasma lipid
concentrations.6,7 Although a recent meta-analysis of
randomized controlled trials showed that adoption of
a vegetarian diet reduces plasma lipids, long-term
effects of vegetarian diets were not studied. To the
best of knowledge, the association between vegetarian
diets and long-term effects on plasma lipids has
not been subjected to meta-analysis. Therefore, a
meta-analysis of studies that have examined vegetar-
ian diets’ relationship on plasma lipid concentrations
was performed.
METHODS
Data sources and search strategy
The search strategy is shown in Table S1 in the
Supporting Information online. The electronic data-
bases MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for
English-language articles published from 1946 to June
2015, from 1900 to June 2015, and from 1966 to June
2015, respectively, and containing one or more of the
keywords for vegetarian diets (“plant-based diet” or
“diet,
vegetarian”
or
“vegetarian
diets”
or
“vegetarianism” or “diets vegan” or “vegan diets”) and
for plasma lipids (“hyperlipidemia” or “cholesterol” or
“low-density lipoprotein” or “high-density lipoprotein”
or “triglyceride”). The reference lists of the retrieved
articles were then reviewed to identify additional
articles.
This
review
was
registered
with
the
PROSPERO register of systematic reviews (registration
no. CRD42015023783) and was conducted in accor-
dance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.
Study selection
Two reviewers (Y.Y. and S.M.L.) separately searched
and retrieved abstracts for articles that met the follow-
ing inclusion criteria: (1) participants aged over 20
years; (2) an intervention or exposure consisting of a
vegetarian diet, defined as a diet that included meat less
than once per month; a semivegetarian diet, defined as
a diet that included meat more than once per month,
but less than once per week; a vegan diet, defined as a
diet that excluded all animal products; or a vegetarian
diet that included some animal products as defined by
the terms “lacto” (dairy products), “ovo” (eggs), or
“pesco” (fish); (3) the collection of sufficient data to al-
low calculation of mean differences in total or LDL-C
between participants who consumed a vegetarian diet
and those who consumed a control diet; and (4) the use
of a controlled trial or observational study design. The
following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) article not
an original paper; (2) lack of a comparison diet; (3) lack
of continuous lipid data; (4) use of a duplicate sample;
(5) small sample size (< 10); (6) animal studies; (7) trial
duration of < 4 weeks; (8) article not in English; and
(9) for observational studies, failure to adjust for sex
and
age.

Data extraction and quality assessment
For
each
study,
the
following
information
was
extracted: study methodology and sample size; baseline
characteristics of the study population, including mean
age, sex (proportion of men), use of antihyperlipidemic
drugs, body mass index (BMI); diets examined and du-
ration of their consumption; concentrations and vari-
ance
measures
of
plasma
lipids,
including
those
measured in response to dietary interventions in clinical
trials; adjustment factors for observational studies, and
Jadad score for clinical trials.
Data synthesis and analysis
Mean differences in concentrations of plasma lipids
(TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides) between vegetarian
and comparison diet groups were calculated. For inter-
vention trials, the pooled standard error for the net dif-
ference in lipid concentrations was used or, when it was
not
given,
estimated
using
the
method

 Follmann et al,8 assuming a correlation of 0.50 between
the baseline and final plasma lipids values (parallel
design) or between the intervention and the control
period (crossover design) plasma lipid values. For
studies comparing more than one exposure group or
treatment arm, data were extracted from groups eat-
ing the fewest animal products, as this was deemed
the best means of assessing the effects of vegetarian
diets.
Using a random-effects model, which assigns a
weight to each study on the basis of the study’s inverse
variance, estimates of differences in plasma lipids asso-
ciated with consumption of vegetarian diets were com-
bined. Using the study as the unit of analysis, estimates
were obtained for observational studies and controlled
trials separately. Estimates of plasma lipid differences
were presented as means and 95%CIs. Statistical signifi-
cance was set to 2-sided P values < 0.05. Although tri-
glyceride concentrations typically do not follow a
normal distribution, inverse variances were calculated
from original data because a previous simulation study
showed that results were consistent across a range of
underlying effect size distributions.9
Analyses stratified by type of vegetarian diet, coun-
try, sample size, age, sex, BMI, duration of diet, antihy-
perlipidemic medication use, and baseline lipid status
were conducted separately for controlled trials and ob-
servational studies. A sensitivity analysis to assess the
impact of each study on the combined effect was con-
ducted by performing a 1-study removed analysis. To
assess heterogeneity, calculations of I2 and meta-
regression were done with subgroups, using the study
as the unit of analysis.
To identify publication bias, funnel plots were cre-
ated and examined, and to assess the relationship be-
tween sample size and effect size, Egger’s test was
performed. The “trim and fill” method, which deter-
mines where missing studies are likely to appear, was
used to adjust for publication bias. These analyses were
done separately for controlled trials and observational
studies and were conducted for the main outcomes of
TC and LDL-C. All analyses were performed using

RESULTS
Search results
The search strategy led to the retrieval of 8385 studies,
of which 30 observational studies10–39 and 19 clinical
trials40–58 met the inclusion criteria (Figure 1).
Study characteristics and quality
Observational studies. The 30 observational studies
(Table 240–58) included 10 143 participants (median
sample size, 74.5; range, 13–3424) with a mean age of
40.6 years (range, 23.8–71.8 years). Each of the 30 ob-
servational studies used a cross-sectional design. In 23
of these studies, participants had been following vege-
tarian diets for more than 1 year.10–12,14–19,22–24,26–36,38

Subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Pooled changes
in plasma lipids associated with consumption of vege-
tarian diets in planned strata for observational studies
and clinical trials are summarized in Tables S2 and S3
in the Supporting Information online.
In observational studies, heterogeneity was statisti-
cally
significant
for
TC,
LDL-C,
HDL-C,
and
triglycerides. Subgroup analysis in observational studies
revealed that vegetarian effect size for TC and LDL-C
was statistically larger with vegan than with lacto-ovo
vegetarian diets; in studies conducted in North or South
America; and in younger age groups (< 50 vs > 50
years). Moreover, LDL-C concentrations were lower in
studies with smaller sample sizes (< 100). Meta-
regression in observational studies also revealed that
younger age was associated with lower values for TC
(0.44, P < 0.001) and LDL-C (0.31, P ¼ 0.002). In addi-
tion, TC and LDL-C in vegetarian groups were lower in
studies
with
smaller
sample
sizes
(slope
0.006,
P < 0.001 for TC; slope 0.006, P < 0.001 for LDL-C),
larger percentages of male participants (slope �0.14,
P < 0.001; slope �0.11, P < 0.001), and lower overall
mean plasma lipids for all participants, vegetarian and
nonvegetarian (slope 0.41, P < 0.001 for TC; slope 0.30,
P < 0.001 for LDL-C).
In clinical trials, the reductions of TC and LDL-C
were greater in the BMI subgroup 18.5 to 25 kg/m2 than
in other subgroups. Meta-regression also revealed that
smaller BMI was associated with larger TC (slope 1.49,
P < 0.001) or LDL-C (slope 1.02, P < 0.001) reductions
with vegetarian diets. Participants who did not use

 lipid-lowering medication showed larger reductions in
TC and LDL-C than participants who used them.
Vegan diets were associated with larger LDL-C reduc-
tions than lacto-ovo vegetarian diets. Smaller sample
size was associated with greater LDL-C reductions in
the subgroup analysis and greater reductions of both
TC and LDL-C in meta-regression analysis (slope 0.03,
P ¼ 0.050; and slope 0.03, P ¼ 0.015, respectively).
Sensitivity analysis. In the 1-study removed analysis,
results were largely unchanged, with plasma lipid differ-
ences between vegetarian and comparison groups rang-
ing from �30.0 to �28.0 mg/dL for TC and from
�23.74 to �21.96 mg/dL for LDL-C in observational
studies (P < 0.001 in all cases) and from �13.5 to
�10.4 mg/dL for TC and from �13.2 to �9.2 mg/dL for
LDL-C in clinical trials (all results were P < 0.001).
Publication bias. Funnel plot outcomes revealed that
larger trials reporting large reductions in TC were pos-
sibly overrepresented in observational studies. A few
studies showing a smaller effect size were absent in the
middle right side (see Figure S1A in the Supporting
Information online). Egger’s test could not confirm this
impression (P ¼ 0.133). Trim-and-fill method out-
comes suggested that 7 studies were missing, and their
addition would have changed the overall effect on TC
to �23.8 mg/dL (95%CI, �29.6, �18.0).
Funnel plot outcomes for the clinical trials sug-
gested that smaller trials that reported large reductions
in TC were overrepresented (see Figure S1B in the
Supporting Information online). If publication bias did
not exist, study results would be symmetrically dis-
played about the mean effect size; studies showing
smaller lipid reductions were missing in the bottom
right side. Egger’s test could not confirm this impres-
sion (P ¼ 0.069). Trim-and-fill method outcomes sug-
gested that 4 trials might have been missing, and their
addition would have changed the overall effect on TC
from �12.5 mg/dL to �8.57 mg/dL (95%CI, �14.79,
�2.35).
DISCUSSION
This meta-analysis of 30 observational studies and 19
controlled trials shows that, compared with consump-
tion of omnivorous diets, consumption of vegetarian
diets is associated with lower TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C
concentrations but not with differences in triglyceride
concentrations. The meta-analysis shows overall differ-
ences in TC of �29.2 mg/dL in observational studies
and �12.5 mg/dL in clinical trials and differences in
LDL-C of �22.9 mg/dL in observational studies and
�12.2 mg/dL in clinical trials. High-density lipoprotein

Meta Analysis

Figure 2
(Continued) (C) HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and (D) triglycerides are depicted as squares; error bars indicate
95%CIs. Meta-analysis yielded pooled estimates of TC (229.2mg/dL; 95%CI, 234.6, 223.8; P < 0.001); LDL (222.9mg/dL; 95%CI, 227.9,
217.9; P < 0.001); HDL-C (23.6mg/dL; 95%CI, 24.7, 22.5; P < 0.001); and triglycerides (26.5 mg/dL; 95%CI, 214.0, 1.1; P 5 0.092), which
are depicted as black diamonds. Vegan diets were defined as those that omitted all animal products; vegetarian diets may include some ani-
mal products, as indicated by the terms lacto (dairy products), ovo (eggs), and pesco (fish). Reference numbers of studies are shown in
parentheses.

 cholesterol was also lower in vegetarian groups than in
omnivorous groups, although the degree of difference
was relatively modest (�3.6 mg/dL in observational
studies and �3.4 mg/dL in clinical trials). Subgroup
analysis indicated that younger age (< 50 years), male
sex, lower baseline plasma lipids, and lower BMI were
associated with greater reductions in TC and LDL-C.
The findings of the current study are consistent
with those of previous reviews,6,7 and the present analy-
sis extends these findings to include a meta-analysis of
observational study data. While observational studies
present a higher risk of bias compared with clinical
trials, they also reflect long-term effects of vegetarian
diets on plasma lipids that are not apparent in most
clinical trials. Those who have followed vegetarian die-
tary patterns for longer periods may have healthier
body compositions as well as better adherence to a
vegetarian diet, both of which may have an effect on
blood lipids. In addition, this study presents the raw
mean difference for each endpoint, which is useful
when the measure is meaningful either inherently or
because of widespread use.59
For context, a previous meta-analysis showed that,
on average, statin use reduced LDL-C concentrations

 by 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol), with considerable variation
depending on statin type.60 The results of the present
analysis showed that diet alone reduced LDL-C by
22.9 mg/dL in observational studies and by 12.2 mg/dL
in clinical trials. While dietary changes may not be as
powerful as statins in reducing plasma lipids, dietary
and pharmacologic interventions are not mutually ex-
clusive. They can work together, and, in some cases, di-
etary practices can obviate the need for medications.
Because side effects may interfere with medication
compliance and may preclude statin use for certain
patients,

some
intrinsic
advantages.

 cholesterol were lower in vegetarians than in omnivo-
rous participants, with strict vegetarians having the low-
est intakes of both.61 The subgroup analysis in the
present study showed that a vegan diet had larger effects
on plasma lipids than a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet. The
observed effects of plant-based diets on plasma lipids
are likely to be, in large part, the result of differences in
saturated fatty acid intake and, to a lesser extent, choles-
terol intake.62,63 The role of saturated fat intake in car-
diovascular outcomes has been questioned recently, in
part due to heterogeneity in meta-analyses.64 This issue
is beyond the scope of the present article, which is lim-
ited to the effect of diet on blood lipid concentrations.
The effects of changes in dietary cholesterol on se-
rum cholesterol decline as baseline dietary cholesterol
increases.65 Hopkins’s analysis indicated that hepatic
cholesterol overload may be the primary basis for the
observed weak response to increasing dietary choles-
terol in the context of a high baseline concentration.65
However, according to the subgroup analysis in the pre-
sent study, a lower baseline plasma lipid concentration
was related to a greater reduction of TC and LDL-C in
plasma by vegetarian diets in clinical trials.
This
meta-regression
and
subgroup
analysis
showed that the duration of adherence to a vegetarian
diet did not modulate the observed effects of the diet.
However, younger age was associated with lower TC
and LDL-C, suggesting that an effect of diet duration
may play a role. Additionally, the present analysis
could not adjust for dietary compliance. Further
studies are needed to clarify the relation between
the duration of vegetarian diets and its effect on
plasma lipids.
In this study, HDL-C concentrations were also sig-
nificantly lower in the context of vegetarian diets than
in omnivorous diets. Although some studies have sug-
gested that HDL-C concentrations are inversely associ-
ated with coronary heart disease,66 recent studies have
shown that interventions that increase HDL-C do not
reduce the risk of coronary heart disease67 and that ge-
netic variants that raise HDL-C do not necessarily re-
duce the risk of coronary heart disease.68
Due to their range of health benefits, vegetarian
diets are specifically mentioned in the 2015–2020
Dietary Guidelines for Americans69 as 1 of 3 noteworthy
healthful diet patterns. As demonstrated in this study,
improved lipid profiles are among these benefits.
Moreover, the range of plant-derived foods is enor-
mous, including simple fruits, vegetables, beans, and
whole grains as well as products that are processed and
prepared with a variety of additional ingredients. The
lipid-lowering effect of a plant-based diet can be maxi-
mized by selection of specific foods. In a randomized
trial of a so-called portfolio diet that included foods rich
in soluble fiber, soy protein, plant sterols, and almonds,
an LDL-C reduction of 28.6% was observed in 4
weeks.70 The strengths of the present meta-analysis in-
clude a substantial sample size that lends confidence to
these findings and allowed subgroup analyses in specific
population groups. In addition, the focus of the meta-
analysis on food consumption as opposed to supple-
ments or other artificial interventions makes the
findings applicable to the public.
An important limitation is heterogeneity. Meta-
regression and subgroup analyses showed that sex,
age, baseline plasma lipids, type of vegetarian diets,
sample size, and BMI may be key reasons for this het-
erogeneity. Still, lower TC and LDL-C concentrations
were seen in all subgroups. In addition, all observa-
tional studies used cross-sectional rather than pro-
spective
designs,
a
limitation
that
is
somewhat
alleviated by the inclusion of randomized clinical tri-
als. Lastly, although all observational studies included
in this study adjusted for age and sex, some did not
adjust for other possible confounders such as BMI or
physical activity level. Further studies are needed to
explore the possible mechanisms by which vegetarian
diets influence plasma lipids. The results of this meta-
analysis suggest a strong association between con-
sumption of vegetarian diets and lower plasma lipid
concentrations.
CONCLUSION
Consumption of vegetarian diets, particularly vegan
diets, is associated with lower levels of plasma lipids,
which could offer individuals and healthcare professio-
nals an effective option for reducing the risk of heart
disease or other chronic conditions. Although not all
clinicians have the training or time to confidently guide
patients toward healthful vegetarian diets, registered
dietitians can provide the services necessary to assist
patients in making this transition.
