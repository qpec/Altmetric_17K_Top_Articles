Summary
Background Physical inactivity is a global pandemic responsible for over 5 million deaths annually through its effects 
on multiple non-communicable diseases. We aimed to document how objectively measured attributes of the urban 
environment are related to objectively measured physical activity, in an international sample of adults.
Methods We based our analyses on the International Physical activity and Environment Network (IPEN) adult study, 
which was a coordinated, international, cross-sectional study. Participants were sampled from neighbourhoods with 
varied levels of walkability and socioeconomic status. The present analyses of data from the IPEN adult study included 
6822 adults aged 18–66 years from 14 cities in ten countries on five continents. Indicators of walkability, public 
transport access, and park access were assessed in 1·0 km and 0·5 km street network buffers around each participant’s 
residential address with geographic information systems. Mean daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity 
physical activity were measured with 4–7 days of accelerometer monitoring. Associations between environmental 
attributes and physical activity were estimated using generalised additive mixed models with gamma variance and 
logarithmic link functions.
Results Four of six environmental attributes were significantly, positively, and linearly related to physical activity in the 
single variable models: net residential density (exp[b] 1·006 [95% CI 1·003–1·009]; p=0·001), intersection density 
(1·069 [1·011–1·130]; p=0·019), public transport density (1·037 [1·018–1·056]; p=0·0007), and number of parks 
(1·146 [1·033–1·272]; p=0·010). Mixed land use and distance to nearest public transport point were not related to physical 
activity. The difference in physical activity between participants living in the most and least activity-friendly 
neighbourhoods ranged from 68 min/week to 89 min/week, which represents 45–59% of the 150 min/week 
recommended by guidelines.
Interpretation Design of urban environments has the potential to contribute substantially to physical activity. 
Similarity of findings across cities suggests the promise of engaging urban planning, transportation, and parks 
sectors in efforts to reduce the health burden of the global physical inactivity pandemic.
Funding Funding for coordination of the IPEN adult study, including the present analysis, was provided by the National 
Cancer Institute of National Institutes of Health (CA127296) with studies in each country funded by different sources.
Introduction
Physical inactivity is a global pandemic, responsible for 
more than 5 million deaths per year and is one of the 
UN’s primary targets to reduce non-communicable 
diseases.1–3 Improvements to urban environments to 
facilitate physical activity for transportation and 
recreation is a recommended strategy.4,5
People who live in walkable neighbourhoods that are 
densely populated, have interconnected streets, and are 
close to shops, services, restaurants, public transport, 
and parks, tend to be more physically active than 
residents of less walkable areas.6,7 Studies of built 
environments and physical activity have been criticised 
for being done in only a few countries,6,8,9 not capturing 
all types of urban environment, and relying on self-
reported environmental measures. International studies 
are needed to represent the full range of environmental 
variability. If findings are gen 
erally applicable across 
countries, then built environ 
ment interventions are 
likely to be viewed as relevant to non-communicable 
disease policies inter 
nationally.
The purpose of this 14 city and ten country study was to 
document the strength, shape, and generalisability of 
associations 
between 
neighbourhood 
environment 
attri 
butes and total moderate to vigorous intensity 
physical activity (MVPA). Objective measures of built 
environments and physical activity enhance precision 
and credibility of the findings.
Methods
Study design and neighbourhood selection
The International Physical Activity and Environment 
Network (IPEN) adult study was a multicountry cross-
sectional epidemiological study with the same design 
and similar methods, described in detail elsewhere.10 The 
study included participants from 17 cities in 12 countries: 
Australia (Adelaide), Belgium (Ghent), Brazil (Curitiba), 
Colombia (Bogota), Czech Republic (Olomouc and

The IPEN adult study was designed to maximise variation 
in neighbourhood walkability and socioeconomic status 
(SES) by identifying similar numbers of neighbourhoods 
stratified as having higher walkability and higher SES,11 
higher walkability and lower SES, lower walkability and 
higher SES, and lower walkability and lower SES. 
Neighbourhood walkability index scores were created for 
small 
geographical 
areas 
in 
each 
city 
(termed 
administrative units, equivalent to US Census block 
groups) with geographic information systems (GIS),11 
with some differences by country.10 Net residential 
density, intersection density, and mixed land use 
variables were standardised, and the mean of the three 
z scores was computed as the index.11 The SES indicator 
was usually area-level income, but sometimes it was 
education 
or 
a 
government-created 
composite.10 
Indicators were chosen based on the data available. 
Neighbourhoods that met the criteria for the four 
stratification groups were selected and participants were 
recruited from those neighbourhoods.
Participant recruitment
Households in selected neighbourhoods were identified 
with databases from commercial and government sources 
with various methods used to obtain representative 
samples in each neighbourhood, including recruitment 
by mail or telephone and personal visits.10 In each selected 
household an adult was invited to complete a survey and 
wear an accelerometer to objectively measure physical 
activity. Study dates ranged from 2002 to 2011 across 
countries, with each country typically recruiting over a full 
year. Each country obtained ethics approval from their 
local institutional review boards and all participants 
provided written informed consent.
Participants
The IPEN adult study included 14 222 adults aged 
18–66 years. The present study included 10 008 participants 
also aged 18–66 years from 14 of the 17 cities from 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Evidence is growing that the design of urban environments has 
a role in the pandemic of physical inactivity, which is 
contributing to several non-communicable diseases. Numerous 
reviews have reported evidence that adults tend to be more 
physically active when they live in higher density, mixed-use 
neighbourhoods with destinations such as shops and parks 
within walking distance. However, findings have been 
inconsistent, perhaps due in part to assessments of only 
individual geographical sites with little environmental 
variability, infrequent use of standardised measures, and over-
reliance on self-reported measures. Improvements in the 
evidence about built environments and physical activity are 
important because environments are constantly changing in 
ways that could have positive or negative effects on whole 
populations over many years.
Added value of this study
This analysis of data from a coordinated international study 
was designed to improve the quality of evidence by assessing a 
broad range of built environments across 14 cities in ten 
middle-income and high-income countries on five continents. 
The quality of measures was enhanced by using comparable 
objective measures of built environments (geographic 
information systems) and physical activity (electronic 
accelerometers that recorded motion every minute). Four of 
six environmental attributes were significantly, positively, 
independently, and linearly related to physical activity in the 
single variable models: residential density, intersection density, 
number of public transport stops, and number of parks within 
walking distance. The study provided novel information about 
the important role of access to public transport. In models 
adjusting for all the significant built environment variables, 
adults who lived in the most activity-friendly neighbourhoods 
did 68–89 min more of physical activity per week than those in 
the least activity-friendly neighbourhoods. This difference is 
larger than reported in most other studies. The relation of built 
environments to physical activity was generally similar across 
diverse cities, suggesting changing built environments is a 
solution that could be applied internationally.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study adds strength to previous calls for policy changes in 
the urban planning, transport, and parks and recreation 
sectors. Communities with high residential density also tend to 
have connected streets, shops, and services within walking 
distance. Access to public transport encourages physical 
activity because people walk to and from buses and trains. 
Public parks provide places for recreational physical activity. 
These activity-friendly characteristics can be deemed to be 
design principles that apply across countries. Because the 
associations were linear, every environmental improvement 
can be expected to contribute to increased physical activity, 
irrespective of whether the residents of the city are starting at 
a low or high level. The large differences in physical activity 
between participants living in the most and least activity-
friendly neighbourhoods provide strong justification for public 
health agencies to work with other agencies to create healthier 
cities. Making cities more activity-friendly than at present 
could be a partial but substantial long-term solution to 
international pandemics of physical inactivity and 
non-communicable diseases.

ten countries where objective measures were available. 
Three cities were excluded because either no accelerometer 
data were collected (Adelaide, Australia) or no GIS data 
were available (Pamplona, Spain, and Hradec Kralove, 
Czech Republic). About a quarter (n=2739) of participants 
did not wear an accelerometer, either because they did not 
consent or the investigators could not afford to collect 
accelerometer data for all participants. For cities able to 
collect accelerometer data for all participants, 87–100% 
provided 
complete 
data. 
Characteristics 
of 
the 
6822 participants with 4 or more days of valid accelerometer 
data by city are shown in table 1. Of these participants, 1740 
(26%) were in the higher walkability and higher SES 
quadrant, 1736 (25%) were in the higher walkability and 
lower SES quadrant, 1845 (27%) were in the lower 
walkability and higher SES quandrant, and 1501 (22%) 
were in the lower walkability and lower SES quadrant.
Outcomes
Physical 
activity 
was 
measured 
objectively 
with 
accelerometers, a reliable, valid, and accepted method.12–14 
Participants were instructed to wear accelerometers for 
7 days around the waist, except during sleep, swimming, 
and showering. Except for New Zealand, which used 
Actical devices (Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA, 
USA), all countries used varying models of ActiGraph 
monitors (Pensacola, FL, USA). Only vertical axis data 
were included in the scoring, expressed as counts per 
min (cpm). For Actical data, we developed moderate 
(730–3399 cpm) and vigorous (≥3400 cpm) intensity 
cutpoints to enable comparison with the ActiGraph 
estimates.15 60 s periods were used in data collection and 
non-wear time was defined as 60 consecutive min or 
more with zero cpm. Valid days had 10 h or more of wear 
time. Participants with 4 or more valid days were included 
in analyses. These methods were consistent with 
recommendations and common practices.12,16 Data were 
scored with MeterPlus 4.3 software, with Freedson’s 
cutpoint of 1952 cpm for moderate intensity to derive the 
outcome variable, mean minutes of MVPA per valid day.17
Variables related to built environment were created 
with GIS software. Areas known as buffers within 
0·5 km and 1·0 km of the participants’ homes, reachable 
by the street network, were defined to estimate accessible 
neighbourhood features. Templates were developed to 
guide international teams on constructing comparable 
GIS variables.18 The templates were also used to 
document protocol adherence, which allowed for 
comparability evaluations. A description of GIS methods 
and variables, examples of data sources for each country, 
comparability evaluations, and descriptive results of 
variation in GIS-based environmental variables within 
and across cities has been published.18 The following 
variables were adequately comparable across cities and 
were used in analyses: net residential density, street 
intersection density, retail and civic land use ratio to 
buffer area (access to common destinations), public

transport density, public park density, and distance to 
nearest transport. Table 2 provides definitions of variables 
and key terms. Table 3 presents descriptive findings for 
environmental variables overall and by city.
Covariates included age, sex, education (<12 years or 
high school level, high school graduation, and university 
degree or higher), marital status (married or living with 
partner vs other), employment status (unemployed vs 
employed), city, accelerometer wear time, and SES of 
administrative unit (low vs high).
Statistical analysis
Associations between environmental variables and 
physical activity (min/day) were estimated with 
generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) with 
gamma variance and logarithmic link functions, 
appropriate for the sampling strategy and distributional 
properties of the outcome variable.19,20 These models 
also allowed for the simultaneous estimation of the 
amount of variability in participants’ individual MVPA 
attributable to factors at city level, administrative unit 
level (within city), and individual level. Covariate-
adjusted single environmental variable (SEV) and 
multiple environmental variable (MEV) GAMMs were 
estimated. The MEV GAMM included only statistically 
significant 
(p<0·05) 
buffer-specific 
environmental 
correlates for each buffer size. Environmental variables 
were entered simultaneously in the MEV GAMMs as 
collinearity was not problematic. Curvilinearity of 
relations was assessed with thin-plate spline smooth 
terms.20 Separate GAMMs were run to estimate 
environmental features by study city interaction effects 
to assess whether the associations of environmental 
features with MVPA differed across cities. The 
significance of interactions was assessed by comparison 
of Akaike information criterion values of models with 
and without an interaction term (≥10 difference 
indicated significance).21 To quantify effect sizes of 
significant 
environmental 
correlates 
of 
MVPA, 
covariate-adjusted differences in weekly minutes of 
MVPA were estimated between participants living in 
buffers with the lowest 5% and highest 5% values of 
environmental correlates and between participants 
living in areas with values of environmental correlates 
corresponding to the lowest and highest average city-
level values. We also expressed these differences in 
activity in percentages of the amount needed to comply 
with the WHO physical activity guidelines (ie, 
percentages of 150 min/week of MVPA).22
To 
assess 
built 
environment 
contributions 
to 
differences in physical activity at the city level, 
administrative unit level, and person level, three-level 
GAMMs with random intercepts at the city and 
administrative unit levels adjusted and unadjusted for 
environmental features were estimated, and the 
percentage reductions in residual variances were 
computed. As only 220 (2·2%) of 10 008 cases had

missing data, analyses were only done for complete 
cases. All analyses used R.
Role of the funding source
Funding for coordination of the IPEN adult study was 
provided by the National Cancer Institute of National 
Institutes of Health (CA127296), with studies in each 
country funded by different sources. Funders were not 
involved in planning or executing the study and they 
were not involved in preparing the manuscript. JFS had 
full access to all of the data in the study and had the final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
On average, participants accumulated about 37 min/day 
of MVPA. Baltimore (USA) had the lowest average 
value (29·2 min) and Wellington (New Zealand) had 
the highest average value of MVPA (50·1 min; 
table 1).The standard deviation of MVPA at the city 
level was 6·3 min/day, at the administrative unit level 
was 4·6 min/day, and at the person level was 
24·4 min/day. Higher variability at the person level was 
expected. Four of six environmental variables were

All regression coefficients adjusted for respondents’ age, sex, marital status, 
educational attainment, employment status, administrative-unit socioeconomic 
status, accelerometer wear time, and study city. Units of measurement shown 
after variable name in parentheses. exp(b) is the proportional increase in physical 
activity associated with a 1 unit of measurement increase in the predictor 
(eg, 1000 dwellings/km² is 1 unit of measurement for net residential density). 
Only results for the buffer size (1·0 km or 0·5 km) showing the strongest 
relationships with physical activity are reported. SEV=single environmental 
variable; MEV=multiple environmental variable (only significant environmental 
correlates included); exp(b)=antilogarithm of regression coefficient; exp 
(95% CI)=antilogarithm of confidence intervals. *Adjusted for net residential 
density, intersection density, and transport density.

significantly associated (p<0·05) with MVPA in the 
SEV models (table 3). These four variables explained 
0–11% of MVPA variability at the city level and explained 
7–11% at the administrative unit levels, but virtually no 
variance at the person (within administrative unit) 
level. Net residential density, intersection density, 
public transport density, and number of parks within 
participants’ buffers were linearly and positively related 
with MVPA. Both buffer sizes were tested and with the 
exception of number of parks, stronger relations were 
noted for variables calculated for 1·0 km than for 
0·5 km buffers. Relations for variables calculated for 
the most significant buffers (1·0 km or 0·5 km) are 
reported (table 3).
After we adjusted for other environmental variables in 
the multiple environmental variable (MEV) models, net 
residential density and public transport density remained 
significant, positive, and linear correlates of MVPA for 
both buffer sizes. Additionally, number of parks 
significantly contributed to explaining MVPA in the 
model based on 0·5 km buffers (table 3). The MEV 
models explained 11–12% of the total MVPA variance.
Based on the absence of significant interactions 
between environmental and city features, we can 
conclude that associations were generalisable across 
study cities, with the exception of number of parks in 
0·5 km buffers. Specifically, positive associations between 
parks within 0·5 km buffers and physical activity in the 
SEV model were reported only in Ghent, Belgium 
(exp[b]=1·772; 95% CI 1·177–2·669; p=0·006) and Seattle, 
USA (exp[b]=2·064; 95% CI 1·399–3·045; p<0·001). After 
we adjusted for other environmental variables, the park 
counts by city interaction was no longer significant and a 
significant positive association of park counts with MVPA 
was reported across all cities (table 3). Thus, we noted 
evidence of similar relations of urban environment 
variables and physical activity across diverse cities. 
Analyses examining the shape of associations reported no 
sufficient evidence for curvilinearity of effects. Therefore, 
we concluded that environment associations with 
physical activity were linear.

24 min/week to 89 min/week. This finding corresponded 
to meeting between 16% and 59% of the recommended 
150 min/week of physical activity. The estimated 
differences in minutes per week of MVPA between 
participants living in areas with all significant 
environmental correlates at the lowest and highest 
average city values was 68 min/week when comparing 
the lowest 5% versus highest 5% neighbourhood buffer 
values. A difference of 89 min/week was found when 
comparing the lowest versus highest average city values. 
These differences are equivalent to meeting 45–59% of 
the 150 min/week physical activity guidelines.
Discussion
This multicountry study identified urban environmental 
attributes that accounted for large differences in adults’ 
physical 
activity. 
Combinations 
of 
environmental 
features generally explained more variation in physical 
activity than single variables, suggesting that a 
comprehensive approach is needed to design activity 
supportive 
neighbourhoods. 
When 
we 
compared 
participants living in the 5% most with the 5% least 
activity 
supportive 
neighbourhoods, 
SEV 
models 
accounted for a smaller number of minutes of MVPA 
compared with models including all significant 
environmental variables. When we compared participants 
living in areas similar to the cities with the most versus 
the least activity supportive environments, single 
variables accounted for a difference of 24–89 weekly 
minutes of physical activity, compared with 68–89 min 
for combined variable models. Living in the most activity-
friendly environments could help the average resident to 
achieve 45–59% of the 150 min/week of physical activity 
recommended guidelines.22 These observed effect sizes 
suggest that designing urban environments to be activity-
supportive could have large effects on physical activity 
and those effects can be expected to generally apply to 
adults living in the neighbourhoods. Such widespread 
and long-term effects are in contrast to programmes that 
target individuals and tend to reach small numbers of 
people and produce short-term effects.23
Three 
environmental 
attributes 
had 
significant 
independent associations with total MVPA in the MEV 
and SEV models: net residential density, public transport 
density, and park density. Net residential density’s strong 
associations were consistent with those shown in many 
other studies.24 High residential density is generally 
deemed to be necessary for other components of 
walkability because local patronage is needed to support 
nearby shops and services and enough riders to support 
frequent transport service.25 Density of public transport 
stops was independently related to total activity. Public 
transport density was notably a significant correlate of 
MVPA but distance to nearest transport stop was not 
significant. One interpretation is that having various 
options for transport lines makes residents more likely to 
walk to a transport facility that meets their needs. Public 
transport access has been studied less often in relation to 
physical activity.6,24 Good transport access is a requirement 
for living a less car-dependent lifestyle.26 Particularly in 
the middle-income cities in the sample, car ownership 
was low and in these settings, active transport, such as 
walking and cycling could represent necessity and not 
choice. Thus, research into the role of public transport 
access in car owners and non-owners would be useful. 
The third significant variable in the final model was 
number of parks in the 0·5 km buffer. Park density is a 
relatively consistent correlate of adult physical activity.6,24 
Although parks are usually thought of as supporting 
recreational activities through facilities and aesthetics, 
nearby parks can also be a destination for active 
transportation. 
Thus, 
the 
most 
well 
supported 
environmental variables were probably related to total 
physical activity through their effects on both recreational 
and transportation activities.
All reported associations were linear so we did not note 
a threshold or a point of diminishing returns for 
environmental attributes. Present findings, with probably 
the widest range of environmental variables yet reported, 
support a recommendation that higher levels of 
residential density, public transport access, and local 
parks should be recommended when designing physical 
activity supportive environments.
The measure of mixed land use was not related to 
physical activity in our study, although this factor is one 
of the more consistent correlates of physical activity.6,24 
Proximal (eg, within 1 km buffers) retail shops and 
services provide frequently used destinations that 
stimulate regular walking. Because of the large variation 
in the proportion of retail and civic land use to buffer 
area within and between countries, the non-significant 
results were surprising. One possible explanation is the 
limitations of the GIS-based measure. Because most 
countries only had data for the land area devoted to each 
use, as opposed to building floor area, we were unable to 
tell whether each use was operating on part of the parcel 
or on several floors of a building covering the entire 
parcel. A related limitation was that the data were based 
on number of parcels, not on number of shops or offices, 
which might be more strongly related to frequency of use 
and thus to physical activity. In middle-income cities 
with a high prevalence of walking for transport, many 
shops were not registered, including those in permanent 
buildings as well as informal markets and street vendors. 
These data limitations could have reduced the power to 
detect an association.
Intersection density is an indicator of street connectivity 
that provides direct pathways for pedestrians and 
vehicles. This variable was significant in SEV models, 
but not in the full models, suggesting a confounding 
effect with other variables, such as residential density or 
public transport density.25
An important finding was the strong support for the 
similarity or generalisability of associations between built

environment and physical activity across countries 
diverse in income, culture, and activity supportiveness. 
The diversity of the study cities in climate, demographics,10 
and built environments has been documented in previous 
publications.18 
Present 
results 
suggest 
systematic 
principles of environments that support physical activity 
apply on a global scale.19 Generalisable associations with 
physical activity were also reported in analyses of self-
reported environment measures in the same study.19
Study strengths included the use of objective measures 
of both urban environments and physical activity, 
comparable 
variables 
across 
diverse 
countries, 
assessment of two buffer sizes, and analyses that tested 
for curvilinear effects and generalisability of associations 
across cities. Limitations included a small number of 
environmental variables that could be assessed through 
common environmental measures, likely variations in 
the quality of those measures across countries, scarce 
representation of low-income countries, a modest sample 
size in some cities that reduced power to detect 
differences in associations across cities, and cross-
sectional design. Another limitation is that covariates, 
such as sex and education, might have different 
meanings and functions across countries. Other patterns 
of association might be noted with other age groups and 
built environment correlates are expected to differ by 
physical activity outcome. Absence of adjustment for self-
selection into neighbourhoods is a frequent criticism of 
built environment studies but not all countries in the 
present study included measures that assessed reasons 
for neighbourhood selection.27
Our recommendations for future research are to 
expand the number of countries, especially low-income 
countries, in which associations between urban 
environment and physical activity are assessed; to 
develop objective measures for other environmental 
attributes relevant to physical activity, such as sidewalks, 
pedestrian zones, bicycle facilities, and factors affecting 
intersection quality (eg, crosswalks, pedestrian signals, 
and traffic calming); and to implement prospective 
studies 
and 
quasi-experimental 
evaluations 
of 
improvements in urban environments.
A recommendation for practice is to make the creation 
of activity supportive environments a regular function of 
public health agencies globally through work with sectors 
outside of public health. Regular assessment and 
reporting (ie, surveillance) of the quality of activity 
supportive environments is a vital component of efforts to 
foster creation of these environments. Health department 
staff should seek training, develop collaborations, and 
become advocates for improved policies in city planning, 
transportation, and parks agencies.
Design of urban environments has the potential to 
contribute nearly 90 min/week of physical activity, which 
is 60% of the 150 min/week recommended in physical 
activity guidelines. These potentially large effects of built 
environments were reported to apply similarly across ten 
diverse countries, indicating that urban design should be 
a globally relevant public health priority. Building, 
retrofitting, and maintenance of physical activity 
supportive features in cities worldwide to increase 
residential density, provide good transport service, and 
ensure access to parks would be expected to substantially 
increase physical activity in the population on a permanent 
basis and contribute to meeting the UN’s goals to reduce 
non-communicable diseases.2,3 Our study findings provide 
an impetus for public health proponents to collaborate 
with other sectors, including environmental sustainability 
groups, 
to 
promote 
physical 
activity 
supportive 
develo 
pment as a means to reduce energy consumption, 
greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution,11,28 while 
achieving health and economic benefits.29

In The Lancet, James Sallis and colleagues1 report 
significantly higher physical activity levels among 
residents where the built environment is supportive of 
physical activity. This study is the largest to date and 
includes data from five continents (6822 adults) and 
makes a completely objective assessment of both the 
attributes of the built environment and the physical 
activity outcomes. The following four built environments 
were positively and linearly associated with higher 
physical activity levels in the single environment model: 
more public parks within walking distance (0·5 km) 
from residence, which were free and open to all; higher 
density of public transport such as number of bus, rail, or 
ferry stops and stations divided by the land area; higher 
net residential density; and higher number of street 
intersections that are pedestrian accessible.
Sallis and colleagues’ Article is uniquely different, 
rigorous, and robust, when compared with previous 
published studies. Earlier studies of built environment 
and physical activity2 have struggled with methodological 
shortcomings: single country or continent, small sample 
sizes, and use of self-reported physical activity and 
perception of environment, which do not allow for an 
accurate quantification of either physical activity or 
structural environmental attributes, which increase or 
hinder physical activity.2 Self-reported physical activity 
levels are influenced by age, sex, culture, and recall 
bias. Sallis and colleagues used measurements from 
geographic information systems and accelerometers 
to assess environment and physical activity objectively. 
They noted a difference of 68–89 min of moderate and 
vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week between 
the least and most supportive built environment areas, 
a substantial difference that translates into 45–59% of 
MVPA recommended per week by WHO.3
Lee and colleagues4 estimated in a conservative 
calculation 
that 
physical 
inactivity 
caused 
9% 
of 
premature 
mortality, 
that 
is, 
more 
than 
5·3 million deaths in 2008. A similar percentage of 
non-communicable diseases can be attributed to 
physical inactivity, such as coronary artery disease 
(6%, 95% CI 3·2–7·8), strokes and diabetes (7%, 
3·9–9·6), breast cancer (10%, 5·6–14·1), and colon 
cancer (10%, 5·7–13·8).4 On the basis of the physical 
activity distribution in Sallis and colleagues’ Article, 
almost two-thirds of physically inactive people would 
fulfil international guidelines if they added 10 min of 
MVPA every day (Cerin E, University of Hong Kong, 
personal communication). According to Lee and 
colleagues,4 3·6 million deaths would be prevented 
each year worldwide if two-thirds of inactive people 
increased their activity to the level recommended in 
the guidelines. Given that Sallis and colleagues noted a 
difference of 68–89 min of MVPA per week between the 
least and most supportive built environments and given 
that the current environment of all participants might 
vary across a spectrum of supportive and unsupportive 
of physical activity, we estimate that total health gained 
by changing to optimal activity-friendly environments 
will be close to 2 million fewer deaths and around 3% 
fewer non-communicable diseases (in other words, 
about 50% lower physical activity associated non-
communicable diseases).
Traditionally, some of the most pedestrian-friendly, 
physical activity-friendly, and cycle-friendly cities in 
the world were built or developed not for specific 
physical activity or health considerations, but for larger 
public good, and common civic sense. Wide pedestrian 
pathways (shaded with trees to counter the hot weather 
in tropical countries), cycling or bike lanes, green 
spaces for walking, and parks and community or sports 
centres were constructed many decades ago for public 
good. Delhi and Mumbai in India were such cities: they 
were beautiful pedestrian-friendly cities, but rampant

new construction has undermined their pedestrian 
friendliness and cycling friendliness.5,6 Similarly, the 
well known Danish bike lane system—which enables 
25% of the population to cycle to work7—provides 
substantial health benefits. Mortality is 30% lower in 
cycle commuters compared with those who use passive 
transport.8 Most bike lanes were constructed 50 years 
ago because visionary politicians realised that cyclists 
caused less pollution and less traffic congestion than 
cars, and new cars were taxed 180%.
Large sums of public money are spent on building or 
remodelling roads, cycling, and walking paths for good 
or ill. For example, the contentious so-called bus rapid 
transport in Delhi cost US$22·5 million.9,10 Similarly, the 
small city Førde, in Norway, has assigned $150 million to 
build bike infrastructure with no money for evaluation. 
Well 
planned 
multiperspective 
assessments 
(or 
evaluations) should be done for all new, existing, and 
old urban environment projects.
Historically, town planning and built environments 
have had major impacts on infectious diseases such as 
cholera, rheumatic fever, and tuberculosis.11 Today’s 
reality is that large-scale and rural–urban migration, 
often of people in distress, is leading to unplanned 
overcrowded habitation and poor sanitation in many 
developing countries, contributing to outbreaks of 
infectious diseases and also increasing rates of non-
communicable diseases.6,12,13 Sallis and colleagues 
present clear evidence for the role of the urban built 
environment in enhancing physical activity levels of 
entire populations, across socioeconomic classes and 
cultures, and thereby preventing non-communicable 
disease. This evidence puts greater responsibility 
on town planners. Other vital attributes of the built 
environment that support physical activity and are 
taken for granted in all the countries of Sallis and 
colleagues’ study, might not be noted in many other 
developing countries and need urgent attention—
safety, pedestrian priority, availability of adequately 
wide, usable, unencroached pedestrian pathways, 
convenience and safety in cycling, and adequate 
capacity in public transport.
Ongoing and long-term multiperspective evaluations 
of existing urban built environments should be an 
integral part of urban planning and governance. We 
need interventions to counter the rapidly growly 
inactivity that urbanisation leads to, by providing 
environments that change the way we live our daily 
lives. It is high time that built environments provide the 
quadruple boost towards health, environment, equity 
(or public good), and habitat.
