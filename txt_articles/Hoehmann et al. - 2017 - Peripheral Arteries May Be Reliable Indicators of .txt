ABSTRACT
Atherosclerosis is a stronger predictor for ischemic cardiovascular
events than traditional risk factors such as race, age, sex, history, and
metabolic profile. Previous research had primarily used ultrasound; how-
ever, we performed a study using histopathology to more accurately grade
atherosclerosis development using the American Heart Association’s grad-
ing scale. We cross-sectioned 13 different arteries from 48 cadavers and
placed them into three separate groups based on anatomic location: cen-
tral arteries, peripheral arteries, and carotid arteries. The central artery
group included arteries that are non-palpable and commonly lead to
ischemic diseases when occluded. The peripheral artery group included
arteries that are accessible to palpation. The carotid artery group includ-
ed branches of the carotid artery. We investigated whether a centrally
located atherosclerotic vessel was associated with atherosclerosis of a spe-
cific peripheral artery. We hypothesized a correlation between carotid,
peripheral and central arteries that may point to specific arteries that
are more effective to analyze clinically when assessing cardiovascular
risk. We observed a correlation between pathology in the left coronary
artery and bifurcation of the carotid artery (r 5 0.37 P � 0.016), two arter-
ies known to be implicated in ischemic stroke and ischemic heart disease.
Importantly, our study demonstrates that the radial artery, a peripheral
vessel, exhibited a positive correlation between both the pathologic left
coronary (r 5 0.33 P � 0.041) and bifurcation of the carotid arteries
(r 5 0.34 P � 0.025). Therefore, we propose investigating the radial artery
as a clinically accessible location to monitor with ultrasound when assess-
ing a patient’s risk for ischemic cardiovascular disease. Anat Rec,

Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease and its pathology
varies per individual, which may lead to varying sequel-
ae. As endothelial damage contributes to the develop-
ment of plaque, it is therefore feasible that an artery’s
specific hemodynamic properties and anatomic location
may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis
(Fong, 2015). It is currently unclear whether the disease
manifests itself to a similar degree among all portions of
the circulatory system.
This controversial topic has been of interest since
1967 when the International Project of Atherosclerosis

 demonstrated the severity of atherosclerosis to vary sig-
nificantly between different vascular territories within
each individual (Robertson, 1967). Newer research, how-
ever, has demonstrated mixed results as some studies
confirm or weakly support the original findings, while
others succeed in establishing continuity of atherosclero-
sis and correlations between different vessels.
Research by Dalager et al. (2007) found the distribu-
tion of atherosclerosis to be somewhat predictable as pla-
ques were more commonly found in the bifurcation of
the carotid and left anterior descending arteries. Ebra-
him et al. (1999) recorded a relationship of atherosclero-
sis development between the bifurcation point of the
carotid and the common carotid arteries. Moln�
ar et al.
(2009) demonstrated multiple correlations, most notably
of the external carotid and femoral arteries between the
coronary arteries that were even stronger than the cor-
relation that was found between the coronary and com-
mon carotid arteries. Hulthe et al. (1997) observed a
correlation between the combined thickness of the two
inner tunics of the blood vessel wall (hereafter, intimae-
media thickness). of the carotid bifurcation and coronary
artery disease. While Lekakis et al. (2000) found intima
media thickness of the common femoral artery to be a
better predictor of coronary artery disease than the
bifurcation of the carotid artery.
Atherosclerotic plaque development is represented by
pathological intima-media thickening, which can be fur-
ther distinguished by the formation of lipid pools. In
advanced atherosclerosis, these plaques become infiltrat-
ed by macrophages forming a vulnerable necrotic core
(Finn et al., 2010). The Cardiovascular Health study,
which included approximately 6,000 subjects, concluded
carotid-artery intima–media thickness to be a better pre-
dictor for cardiovascular events than traditional risk fac-
tors such as age, sex, race, history of diabetes, history of
smoking, presence or absence of atrial fibrillation, histo-
ry of hypertension, systolic and diastolic pressure, and
low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol
levels
(O0Leary
et
al.,
1992).
Furthermore,
research by Touboul et al. (2007), which studied over
6,000 subjects, found intima-media thickness to positive-
ly correlate with the Framingham risk score (Mitchell
et al., 2010).
Research investigating intima-media thickness per-
formed via ultrasound has been shown to be limited
when compared to histopathology studies (Ratliff et al.,
1985; Wong et al., 1993; El-Barghouty et al., 1996; Bal-
dassarre et al., 2000; Zambanini et al., 2005; Tang et al.,
2008; Erl€
ov et al., 2016). Finn et al. (2010) described the
inability of ultrasound to investigate the internal or the
bifurcation of the carotid arteries while also noting its
limited ability to differentiate lesions with a necrotic
core. Wong et al. (1993) found ultrasound to measure
near-wall intima-media thickness 20% less accurately
than ascertained histologically. New techniques have
been developed to more accurately visualize plaque
development; nevertheless, even the most promising
techniques are not entirely sensitive or specific when
detecting a vulnerable necrotic core (Erl€
ov et al., 2016).
Ultrasound is a useful tool in the clinical setting; howev-
er for reasons discussed here, the literature suggests
histopathology to be a more appropriate method to grade
atherosclerosis. We hypothesize a correlation between
pathology observed in carotid, peripheral, and central
arteries.
In the present study, we utilize histopathology to con-
firm as well as expand the search for correlations among
arteries compared to other arteries that may associate
with ischemic diseases. In order to investigate the distri-
bution of atherosclerosis in various arteries throughout
the body, we sampled arterial segments from the carotid
arteries and segments from peripheral vessels. We then
compared these vascular segments to clinically relevant
central arteries of the torso. We define carotid arteries
as arteries belonging to the carotid artery system, we
define central arteries as those that cannot be assessed
superficially, and we define arteries as vessels of the
limbs that are superficial enough to be accessible by pal-
pation to clinicians.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Cadavers from the Anatomy Lab at the New York
Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine
(NYITCOM) were used in this study. According to the
Institution Review Board (IRB), IRB approval protocol is
not necessary because the cadavers were donated for the
purpose of education and research. Thus, IRB approval
was not necessary. This study was compliant with the
standards of the Health and Insurance Accountability
Act and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Forty-eight cadavers from the Anatomy Lab at the
New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic
Medicine (NYITCOM) were used in this study. For each
individual, a cross section was taken of 13 arterial seg-
ments (13 3 48 5 624 sections) (Fig. 1). Each artery
belonged to one of three groups: carotid arteries, central
arteries, and peripheral arteries. Carotid artery group
includes:
common
carotid,
internal
carotid,
external
carotid,
and
bifurcation
of
carotid
arteries.
Central
artery group includes: vertebral, left coronary, left ante-
rior descending, and internal thoracic arteries. Peripher-
al
artery
group
includes:
brachial,
radial,
femoral,
posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis arteries.
The cadavers were de-identified but some information
was known. Of the 48 cadavers, the median age was 82
years with a range of 61-97 years. The mean age was
80.7 with a standard deviation of 8.4 present. Twenty-
six of the cadavers were female, while 22 were male.
Each cadaver had no known prior cardiac, carotid or
peripheral stents. Cause of death was varied (Table 1).
No pre-mortem medical information or risk factors was
available.
Histopathologic Studies
All samples were taken from the right side of the
cadaver at specific locations, except for the left coronary
and left anterior descending arteries (Fig. 1). The com-
mon carotid artery section was taken 5 cm inferior to
the bifurcation, while the external and internal carotid
artery sections were taken 5 cm superior to the bifurca-
tion. The vertebral artery section was taken 7 cm superi-
or to its branching point from the subclavian artery. The
left coronary artery was sampled from behind the left
auricle, while the left anterior descending artery was

 sampled 8 cm distal to the coronary ostium. The internal
thoracic was sectioned behind the third rib. The brachial
artery was sampled 5 cm distal to the branch point of
the profunda brachii artery, while the radial artery was
sectioned from the anatomical snuffbox. The superficial
femoral artery was sampled from the center of the femo-
ral triangle. The tibialis posterior was sectioned posteri-
or and 3 cm inferior to the medial malleolus. The
dorsalis pedis was sampled from the dorsum of the foot
distal 3 cm distal to the prominence of the navicular
bone.
All cross sections were placed in cassettes and were
processed in the NYITCOM histology lab. Once speci-
mens were sectioned, they were stained with hematoxy-
lin and eosin. Sections were embedded using paraffin at
5-micron thickness. Histological evaluation was per-
formed using a light microscope (Olympus BX51) in ran-
dom
order

 evaluation was performed by a single observer in order
to negate the potential for subjective differences between
multiple observers. The degree of atherosclerosis was
then evaluated using the American Heart Association
(AHA) recommended classification scheme for athero-
sclerosis histopathology According to AHA guidelines,
arteriosclerosis can be divided into eight grades of vascu-
lar disease (I to VIII; Fig. 2) (Stary et al., 1995; Stary,
2000). A Grade VI lesion is thought to be a temporary
stage (Stary, 2000) and has been criticized as a “poorly
defined category” by Virmani et al. (2000) in a review of
the AHA guidelines. This resulted in a lack of observa-
tions of Grade VI lesions. Grade VIII is an uncommon
pathway for progression of the disease (Stary, 2000) and
was not observed.
Data Analysis
Statistical Analysis was performed with IBM SPSS
version 20.0 for Windows. Correlations were identified
using the grades assigned to each section. Correlation
coefficients were calculated using Spearman’s q. Using
these data we searched for pair-wise correlations among
members of each of the three different groups (carotid,
central and peripheral arteries) (Table 2). Next, we
looked for pair-wise correlations between members of
the different groups (Table 3). The following Spearman q
values were utilized to assess the level of correlation
present: r 5 0.10 (small), r 5 0.30 (medium), and r 5 0.50
(large) and determined that a P-value less than 0.05 was
significant (Cohen, 1988).
RESULTS
Within Groups (Table 2)
Within the group of the carotids, the bifurcation
showed a medium correlation for both internal (r 5 0.30
P � 0.045) and common (r 5 0.46 P � 0.001) arteries but
no correlation was observed for the external.
There was no significant correlation found amongst
any of the members of the central artery group when
assessed in pairs.
We also assessed correlations found between vessels
within the group of peripheral arteries. There was a
medium correlation found between the brachial and dor-
salis pedis arteries (r 5 0.48 P � 0.002). There was a
medium correlation found between the radial and poste-
rior tibial arteries (r 5 0.35 P � 0.024). There was a large
correlation found between the dorsalis pedis and posteri-
or tibial arteries (r 5 0.54 P � 0.000).
Between Groups (Table 3):
When
assessing
between
the
carotid
and
central
groups, there was a medium correlation found between
the bifurcation of the carotid artery and the left coro-
nary artery (a member of the central artery group)
(r 5 0.37 P � 0.016). There was also a medium correla-
tion found between the bifurcation of the carotid artery
and left anterior descending artery (r 5 0.44 P � 0.005)
and a medium correlation found between the common
carotid
artery
and
left
coronary
artery
(r 5 0.41
P � 0.007).
When assessing between the carotid and peripheral
groups, there was a medium correlation found between
the bifurcation of the carotid artery and both the brachi-
al (r 5 0.36 P � 0.015) and radial (r 5 0.34 P � 0.025)
arteries. There was also a correlation found between the
common carotid artery and brachial artery (r 5 0.49
P � 0.000).
When assessing between the peripheral and central
groups, there was a medium correlation found between
the radial and left coronary arteries (r 5 0.33 P � 0.041).
The vertebral artery also showed a medium correlation
with the dorsalis pedis artery (r 5 0.36 P � 0.021).
DISCUSSION
Within the collected data, we believe the findings
regarding the radial, bifurcation of the carotid, and left
coronary arteries to be especially meaningful (Fig. 3).
The positive correlation found between plaque develop-
ment in the bifurcation of the carotid and left coronary
arteries signify an existing and observable relationship
between ischemic stroke and ischemic heart disease, fur-
ther supported by the previous work of Ebrahim et al.
(1999). Meanwhile, plaque development in the radial
artery, a peripheral vessel, showed a positive correlation
between both the bifurcation of the carotid and left coro-
nary arteries. Therefore, the radial artery by itself may
be a useful surrogate indicator for both ischemic heart
disease and ischemic stroke.
Plaque development in the bifurcation of the carotid
artery can lead to thromboembolic stroke because of its
close proximity to the brain. Furthermore, plaque devel-
opment in the left coronary artery can cause ischemic
heart disease due to its anatomic location. Previously,
Ebrahim et al. (1999), found the intima-media thickness
of the bifurcation point of the carotid and the common
carotid arteries to be correlated together, however they
were found to be associated with different diseases.
Thickened bifurcation point intima-media was found to
be associated with ischemic heart disease risk factors
and the prevalence of ischemic heart disease, whereas
thickened common carotid intima-media was found to be
associated with stroke risk factors and the prevalence of
stroke (Ebrahim et al., 1999). Also of note, Dalager et al.
(2007) found that plaques tend to develop in the bifurca-
tion of the carotid and left coronary arteries more fre-
quently than in other locations. A relationship between
these two vessels may provide a mechanism by which
someone at an increased risk of stroke may also be at an
increased risk for ischemic heart disease. This is further
supported by the correlation that existed between the
bifurcation of the carotid artery and the left coronary
artery that was present in our study.

cadavers; they have been chosen to demonstrate the methods used
to assign grades to the sections. Grade I lesion: only isolated macro-
phage foam cells are present (highlighted by the arrow). This is a sec-
tion of the external carotid artery. Grade II: macrophage foam cells are
apparent here in layers, encircled by the elliptical shapes. This is a
section of posterior tibial artery. Grade III: has small pools of extracel-
lular lipids visible, depicted by the rectangle. This is a section of the
vertebral artery. Grade IV: exhibits the presence of a large confluent
extracellular lipid pool, indicated by the rectangle. This is a section of
the femoral artery. Grade V: has apparently thickened fibromuscular
tissue layer, appreciated by the line with brackets. An extracellular lip-
id pool is also present here, indicated by the rectangle. This is a sec-
tion of the internal carotid artery. Grade VII: calcification predominates
the tunica of the vessel wall, indicated by the green asterisk. This is a
section of the radial artery.

HOEHMANN ET AL.
 Assessing plaque development in the bifurcation of
the carotid artery and left coronary artery would be
extremely valuable to a clinician when assessing a
patient’s
risk
for
ischemic
diseases.
Atherosclerotic
development has been determined to be a more clinically
useful parameter when measuring cardiovascular risk
than traditional risk factors such as age, sex, race, histo-
ry, and metabolic profile (O0Leary et al., 1999; Mitchell
et al., 2010). Ultrasound exists as a tool that many clini-
cians have in-office, which may be used to identify such
parameters;
however,
there
are
limitations
when
attempting to directly assess the bifurcation of the carot-
id or left coronary artery. One such limitation is that
when using ultrasound to assess the carotid artery, a
reading is often inadvertently measured in the common
carotid
artery
and
not
the
bifurcation.
This
is

 problematic as advanced plaque development occurs
mainly downstream in the internal or bifurcation of the
carotid artery, which is more predictive of ischemic dis-
ease (Finn et al., 2010). Additionally, the left coronary
artery is too deep a structure to be assessed with
ultrasound.
Therefore,
we
propose
another
option:
the
radial
artery. In our data, plaque development in the radial
artery was shown to have a positive correlation with
both the bifurcation of the carotid artery and the left
coronary artery. Located at the wrist, the radial artery
is readily accessible for measurement via ultrasound.
For this reason, we propose that ultrasound measure-
ment of the radial artery can simultaneously assess the
risk for both ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke
in a powerful way that may be even more useful than a
patient’s history. However, it is currently unclear as to
whether the medium correlation that was found between
the radial artery, carotid arteries, and left coronary
artery is strong enough evidence to warrant the clinical
utility of assessing these vessels with ultrasound tech-
nology. Therefore we recommend further investigation.
Although some meaningful correlations were present
in our study, it is also important to note that uniform
correlations were not present throughout each body. Fur-
thermore, the correlations that were present in our
study were mostly categorized as medium at best. The
present literature is inconclusive as to the degree of

 systemic atherosclerosis that is deposited throughout the
body with some studies finding a lack of homogeneity
and others discovering some correlations. While our
study does suggest some meaningful correlations, it can-
not firmly resolve the literature’s general state of ambi-
guity on this topic; more research is needed.
It is also of note that our study does support the
claims made by Dalager et al. (2007), that vessels locat-
ed in the same arterial territory are more likely have a
similar distribution of atherosclerosis. This is evident in
our study, as there seems to be correlation between most
of the members of the carotid artery group. However, it
is unclear why the external carotid artery did not follow
a similar correlation with the other carotid arteries.
There also lies a correlation between the posterior tibial
and dorsalis pedis arteries, two vessels located in the
distal lower extremity. For this same reason, it is not
surprising that that the members of the central artery
group do not correlate well as they are located in differ-
ent arterial territories.

from a single individual; samples from four individuals are displayed
here. The numbers on the left border of the figure represent the
assigned cadaver number. The numeral on the bottom left corner of
each photo represents the section’s assigned grade, while the number
on the bottom right corner indicates the magnification. Each vertical
column depicts sections of a specific vessel sampled from each
cadaver: the radial, carotid bifurcation, and left coronary arteries. The
radial artery is a peripheral artery, the bifurcation is a carotid artery,
and the left coronary is a central artery. The similar pathology noted in
different vessels of the same individual suggests an underlying rela-
tionship between them.

 LIMITATIONS
A histopathological approach was used because the
current literature has suggested it to be the most accu-
rate way to assess plaque development. An impediment
to this approach was that our sample data consisted of
only deceased individuals, most of which had become
elderly before passing and many of which experienced
advanced atherosclerotic disease. This meant that the
proportion of pathologic samples in our sample data was
greater than that would have been in the general popu-
lation. The lack of healthy samples meant a lack of a
healthy control; therefore, the dominance of pathologic
samples weakened the contrast between pathologic and
healthy vessels in the data. We expect that if we had
access to more healthy samples, we would find more sta-
tistical significance.
It is unclear as to whether these data can be meaning-
fully extrapolated to a larger population due the study’s
limited sample size. Only forty-eight cadavers were
included in this study, nevertheless statistical signifi-
cance was achieved. For reference, a notable study per-
formed
by
Dalager
et
al.
(2007)
that
similarly
investigated
atherosclerosis
by
using
histopathology
included 100 subjects. While a separate vascular histo-
pathology study by Moln�
ar et al. (2009) examined 40
cadavers. It would be interesting to know if the findings
of these studies could be extended to include a larger
sample size.
A ruler was used to measure the distance from local
landmarks and branch points to acquire consistent sam-
ples. However, because of natural variation in anatomic
size and variation for each cadaver, it is possible that
unwanted variation might have occurred in the sam-
pling process. It is unknown as to whether this had any
influence on the analyzed data.
In practice, we found the distinctions between grades
I and II, and II and III to be vague enough to warrant
concern as to whether anyone can consistently assess a
vessel in one of those categories. We assessed the influ-
ence of experience on variation of the observations of the
single observer by reassessing the first 100 specimens a
second time after all sections had been assessed. Varia-
tion between the initial and second assessments of the
first 100 sections was insignificant. Of this variation
between
initial
and
second
assessments,
11%
were
attributable
to
the
difficulty
distinguishing
between
Grades I and II and between Grades II and III. Despite
these limitations, we determined histopathology to be
the
most
accurate
way
to
assess
atherosclerosis
development.
CONCLUSIONS
These data suggest that the radial artery may be a
powerful tool for clinicians to use an adjunct to either
screen for or to monitor ischemic diseases. This is made
evident by the positive correlations that plaque develop-
ment in the radial artery exhibited for plaque develop-
ment in both the bifurcation of the carotid artery and
the left coronary artery; two arteries that have been
implicated
in
ischemic
heart
disease
and
ischemic
stroke. Consequently, by way of these observed correla-
tions, we propose that plaque development in the radial
artery may correlate with these diseases as well. We
believe that while keeping in mind the results of the his-
topathologic correlations
demonstrated in our study,
ultrasound investigation of the radial artery is war-
ranted and could yield crucial clinical insight into the
progression of ischemic diseases. Further investigation
into the correlation between ultrasound findings with
histopathology grades is needed to determine if this can
translate into clinical utility.
