Abstract
Background: There are limited efficacious treatment options for severe osteoarthritis of the knee (OAK). The Low
Molecular Weight Fraction of 5% human serum Albumin (LMWF-5A) is in development to treat severe OAK. This
study evaluated the safety and efficacy of LMWF-5A for the signs and symptoms of OAK.
Methods: This 12-week randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted at thirteen sites across the
United States. Patients with symptomatic, severe OAK (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4 disease) who were fully ambulatory
and had no other conditions interfering with the study knee were randomized to a single 4 ml intra-articular injection
of LMWF-5A or saline, randomized 6:1. The primary endpoint was Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-Osteoarthritis
Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) responder rate (%), examined with a one-sided exact binomial test
compared to a clinically meaningful response rate of 30%. Efficacy of LMWF-5A was also evaluated as controlled
responder (%), defined as 20% improvements in both pain and function, compared to historical saline control
from three previous trials. Safety was examined as the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs). This trial
was registered (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03182686).
Results: In total, 168 patients were randomized; 144 subjects treated with LMWF-5A were analysed. Overall, 71%
(95% CI: 63.4%–78.3%) of subjects treated with LMWF-5A met the OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria, exceeding
the 30% threshold (p < 0.001). There were also significantly more responders at week 12 in the LMWF-5A arm
than historical saline control (65% vs. 43%, p < 0.001). There were no drug-related serious AEs reported and no
deaths or withdrawals due to adverse events.
Conclusion: LMWF-5A provides relief for the signs and symptoms of severe osteoarthritis, and may be an alternative
therapeutic treatment option for patients with severe osteoarthritis of the knee.

 Background
Osteoarthritis (OA) is an incurable and progressive dis-
order of the joints involving degradation of the intra-
articular cartilage, joint lining, ligaments, and bone. OA
affects up to 27 million adults in the US alone [1]. The
incidence of developing osteoarthritis of the knee (OAK)
over a lifetime is approximately 45%, and this number is
expected to grow because OAK is associated with age,
obesity, and diabetes [1]. The primary clinical symptoms
are pain and functional impairment leading to loss of
mobility [2]. The severity of OAK is typically defined in
stages as noted by Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading: Grade
0 (normal knee; no osteophytes or joint space narrowing),
Grade 1 (possible osteophytic lipping and doubtful nar-
rowing of joint space), Grade 2 (definite osteophytes and
possible narrowing of joint space), Grade 3 (moderate
multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of joint space
and some sclerosis, and possible deformity of the bone
ends) and Grade 4 (large osteophytes, marked narrowing
of joint space, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of
bone ends) [3].
Practice guidelines recommend the use of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitors, or acetaminophen for the pharmacologic
management of pain in OAK (all KL grades) [4]. Steroids
and hyaluronic acid injections have been approved for the
treatment of OAK. However, they are not without contro-
versy due to varying evidence of efficacy [4, 5]. Further,
these products received approval for clinical studies where
patients with KL grade 4 disease were excluded, and there
are no published studies examining their use exclusively
in the KL grade 4 population. As such, there is an unmet
therapeutic need for patients with severe OAK who live
with debilitating pain as well as functional and activity
limitations. Patients with severe OAK routinely require a
total knee replacement due to a lack of effective treatment
options. Over 700,000 total knee replacements are per-
formed each year in the United States [6]. This number is
expected to spiral to over 3.5 million procedures by 2030,
in part because the aging patient population and increas-
ing obesity rates have resulted in increasing OA preva-
lence and severity [6].
LMWF-5A, the < 5 kilodalton (kDa) ultrafiltrate of 5%
human serum albumin, is a novel non-steroidal, anti-
inflammatory biologic agent which has been shown to
effectively reduce pain in patients with severe OAK when
administered as a single intra-articular (IA) injection [7, 8].
The molecular components and mechanisms of action of
LMWF-5A have previously been described [9–13].
LMWF-5A is in development to provide relief for the
signs and symptoms of severe OAK. Prior trials evaluat-
ing LMWF-5A were conducted in a population with all
stages of symptomatic OAK (KL grades 2–4), and exam-
ined pain as the primary endpoint. The objective of this
study was to confirm the efficacy of LMWF-5A in a
population of patients with severe OAK (KL grade 4),
evaluating both the signs and symptoms of OAK.
Methods
Design and setting
This was a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
efficacy of a single injection of 4 ml LMWF-5A in
patients with severe OAK (KL grade 4). Patients were ran-
domized 6:1 to LMWF-5A or saline. The trial was per-
formed in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical
Practice guidelines, in compliance with the CONSORT stan-
dards, received institutional review board (IRB) approval
across all thirteen sites, and was registered prior to patient
recruitment (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03182686). Pa-
tients were enrolled at thirteen sites within the United States
between June 19, 2017 and September 15, 2017 with follow-
up and study completion through December 7, 2017. Up-
dates to the study protocol that were made after the study
commenced but prior to study completion, include: changes
to secondary endpoints to include the endpoints listed
below; Inclusion criteria of at least moderate functional
impairment (score > 1.5 Western Ontario and McMaster
Universities Arthritis (WOMAC®) function subscale) to en-
sure patients presented with signs and symptoms of OAK.
Test product
The test product is LMWF-5A, which is the < 5 kilodalton
(kDa) ultrafiltrate of 5% human serum albumin. The start-
ing material, commercial HSA, was subjected to centri-
fugation/ultrafiltration under sterile conditions. The
ultrafiltrate, containing species with a molecular weight
less than 5000 Da, was separated. The ultrafiltrate contains
aspartyl-alanyl diketopiperazine (DA-DKP, approximately
50–200 μM) and the excipients (i.e. sodium caprylate and
sodium acetyltryptophanate). The ultrafiltrate was trans-
ferred for aseptic filling to afford sterile drug product. DA-
DKP has been shown to have multiple anti-inflammatory
and immune modulating effects [9–13], and is believed to
be one of the active ingredients in the pharmacological ef-
fects of commercial HSA.
Participants
Eligible subjects had x-ray findings demonstrating KL
grade 4 OAK, with at least moderate pain and functional
impairment (defined as a score of at least 1.5 on the 5-
point Likert WOMAC osteoarthritis Index 3.1 pain and
function subscales), with the ability to discontinue NSAID
use at screening for the duration of the study, be fully am-
bulatory, have no known clinically significant liver abnor-
mality, and between 40 to 85 years old. Subjects also had
to have minimal or no pain in the contralateral knee
(pain < 1.5 on the 5-point Likert WOMAC pain subscale).

 Exclusion criteria included: a history of allergic reac-
tions to albumin and its excipients; any human albumin
treatment 3 months before randomization; concurrent
arthritic conditions or other conditions interfering with
the free use and evaluation of the index knee (e.g. chon-
dromalacia, presence of tense effusions, acute fractures,
history of aseptic necrosis or joint replacement in the
affected knee, inflammatory or crystal arthropathies);
severe hip OA ipsilateral to the index knee; major sur-
gery within 12 months prior to screening; pregnancy;
any treatment targeting OAK started or changed 4 weeks
before randomization; use of other IA-injected medica-
tions at least 12 weeks (hyaluronic acid) or 4 weeks (ste-
roids) prior to baseline; use of opioids, NSAIDs, topical
treatments, significant anticoagulant therapy, immuno-
suppressants, corticosteroids, or systemic treatments that
may interfere with study assessments.
Randomization and blinding
Randomization was developed and maintained by an in-
dependent statistician. Patients were randomized 6:1 to
receive a single 4 mL intra-articular injection of LMWF-
5A or saline (0.9% sodium chloride) into the knee joint
space (inferior lateral to the patella). Study drugs were
provided in vials labeled with double-panel labels blinded
for drug content. Lidocaine injection was not allowed pre-
ceding the administration of study drug. Acetaminophen
was allowed as pain analgesia during the study as 500 mg
tablets every 4 h, as required. The Sponsor, the investiga-
tors, and all study staff having a role in the day-to-day
conduct of the study remained blinded to treatment.
Assessments and endpoints
The clinical effects of LMWF-5A was evaluated during
in-clinic visits at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks, and telephone
contacts at 2 and 10 weeks, using the WOMAC osteo-
arthritis Index 3.1 5-point Likert score and the Patient’s
Global Assessment of disease severity (PGA). Clinical
benefit was evaluated using the Outcome Measures in
Rheumatology (OMERACT) - Osteoarthritis Research
Society International (OARSI) (OMERACT-OARSI) re-
sponder criteria. The OMERACT-OARSI response uses
the WOMAC and PGA scales as assessed during the
in-office visits and phone contacts.
Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and
concomitant mediations (all follow-up contacts), physical
examination and vital signs (Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12),
and laboratory tests (Screening and Week 12).
The primary endpoint was OMERACT-OARSI response,
defined using scenario D as follows: a) Large improvement
in WOMAC A pain or in WOMAC C function ≥50% and
absolute change of ≥1 points, or b) moderate improve-
ments in at least 2 of 3 response domains: i) WOMAC A
pain ≥20% and absolute change ≥0.5; ii) WOMAC C
function ≥20% and absolute change ≥0.5; iii) PGA ≥ 20%
and absolute change ≥0.5.
Secondary efficacy endpoints included: a) controlled
responder, defined as an improvement in both WOMAC
A pain and WOMAC C function of ≥20% and an abso-
lute change of 0.5 points; b) PGA responder, defined as
a ≥ 20% improvement and absolute change ≥0.5 points
in PGA.
Sample size and comparison groups
Two comparators were used for evaluation of efficacy of
LMWF-5A. First, a 30% response to treatment was con-
sidered demonstration of a meaningful response to treat-
ment of at least minimum efficacy. While the amount of
improvement required may not be definitively established
and is stated to be between 20%–40% based on best avail-
able evidence [14], the 30% threshold was selected based on
Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment
in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations demon-
strating 30% represents moderate improvements in chronic
pain intensity in pain trials [15]. A 20–30% result is ex-
pected in OA when evaluated by the OMERACT-OARSI
scenario D criteria [16]. The American College of Rheuma-
tology (ACR) also uses a 30% response to treatment in the
established ACR30 criteria, which evaluates six core do-
mains including PGA and physical function [17].
The hypotheses were tested as follows: H0: π ≤ π0 versus
HA:π > π0, where the null hypothesis was a 30% response
to treatment (π0). A sample size of 146 patients in the
LMWF-5A arm was calculated to have power greater than
90% when the anticipated proportion of responders under
the alternative hypothesis was 45%.
Second, efficacy of LMWF-5A was evaluated versus a
historical saline-control, defined a priori as all patients
with KL grade 4 disease who were randomized to saline
arm (n = 223) from three previous studies comparing
LMWF-5A and saline when administered as a single in-
jection [8]. The current trial and all previous trials [8]
were identical for selection criteria, treatment arms,
blinding, randomization (1:1), and safety and efficacy as-
sessments. While the study was powered to compare
LMWF-5A to a clinically relevant threshold response,
the comparison to historical saline was used to ensure a
meaningful and quantitative assessment of treatment ef-
fect. The Food and Drug Administration allows com-
parison to historical control in its clinical trial guidance
document [18]. There are currently no approved active
controls (no IA-injected therapies approved in the severe
KL grade 4 OAK population), and no available placebo
controls. While saline has historically been used as a
control in IA trials, recently saline has demonstrated a
pronounced therapeutic effect when administered as an
IA injection into the knee [19–21].

 Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS® software,
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Efficacy endpoints
were analyzed in the intent-to-treat population (as random-
ized). For the primary effectiveness endpoints (WOMAC
A, WOMAC C, and PGA), missing Week 12 values were
imputed using the Worst Observation Carried Forward
(WOCF) method, which is a more conservative approach
to imputation than the last observation carried forward
(LOCF) approach when patients are expected to improve
over time, and is frequently used in analgesia drug trials.
All endpoints were defined a priori.
The efficacy endpoints were tested in a hierarchical
manner, as the primary (OMERACT-OARSI responder),
and then secondary endpoints of controlled responder,
then PGA responder, then controlled responder com-
pared to historical saline. The primary and secondary
efficacy endpoints were reported as proportions (%). A
one-sided exact binomial test was used for comparison
of LMWF-5A to the 30% threshold (OMERACT re-
sponder, controlled responder, PGA responder); statis-
tical significance was set at p value < 0.025. The Fisher’s
exact test was used for comparison of LMWF-5A to his-
torical saline for controlled responders; statistical signifi-
cance was set at p value < 0.05.
Adverse events (AEs) were examined in all patients
who were randomized. Missing or incomplete AE data
was assumed to be a severe, related AE. Adverse events
were tabulated for incidence and severity; severity was
defined as mild (symptom barely noticeable to the sub-
ject), moderate (symptom is of sufficient severity to
make the subject uncomfortable), and severe (symptom
causes severe discomfort, daily activities are significantly
impaired or prevented). Serious adverse events (SAEs)
were defined as untoward medical occurrences resulting
in death, in-patient hospitalization, persistent or signifi-
cant disability/incapacity, or were life-threatening.
Results
Of 168 subjects, 144 subjects were randomized to LMWF-
5A and 24 subjects were randomized to saline (Fig. 1). Pa-
tients were randomized across 13 sites, with no site effect
observed (p = 0.82). All 144 subjects treated with LMWF-
5A were included in the analysis. Missing data accounted
for 2.0% of all efficacy assessments, and 4.2% (n = 7) of pa-
tients had WOCF values imputed for the primary endpoint
at week 12.
Baseline data is shown in Table 1. Just over half of
subjects were female (52%), the average age was 63 years,
and the average baseline pain was 2.5 (0.6) on a 0–4
scale. There were no clinically meaningful imbalances
between LMWF-5A, saline, and historical saline in demo-
graphics or baseline WOMAC subscores.
Primary efficacy endpoint
Overall, 71% (95% CI: 63%–78%) of subjects treated with
LMWF-5A met the OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria,
which exceeded the 30% threshold for clinical benefit
(p < 0.001), Table 2. Responders experienced, on average
a 53% decrease in pain as measured by WOMAC A
and a 50% improvement in function as measured by
WOMAC C and a 45% improvement in quality of life
as measured by PGA. Treatment with LMWF-5A resulted

 in a significant response using OMERACT-OARSI criteria
at all assessed time points (p < 0.001 for all, Table 2).
Secondary efficacy endpoints
The percent of subjects in the LMWF-5A arm that met
the controlled responder criteria was 65% (95% CI: 57%–
72%), which was significantly greater than the threshold of
30% (p < 0.001), Table 2. Further, the proportion of sub-
jects that met controlled responder at weeks 2, 6, 10, 12
was significantly greater than the established threshold, at
all time points (p < 0.001, Table 2).
The percent of subjects treated with LMWF-5A that
were PGA responders was 66% (58%–74%), exceeding
the 30% threshold (p < 0.001), Table 2. The proportion of
subjects that met PGA responder at weeks 2, 6, 10, 12
was significantly greater than the established threshold,
at all time points (p < 0.001 for all, Table 2).
When compared to 223 historical saline controls, the
percent of subjects that met the controlled responder
criteria at week 12 was significantly greater in the
LMWF-5A arm than the historical control arm (65% vs.
43%, p < 0.001). The percent of subjects meeting con-
trolled responder criteria was also significantly greater
for LMWF-5A vs. historical control at week 10 (62% vs.
47%, p = 0.007) and week 6 (58% vs. 43%, p = 0.005), but
was similar at week 2 (54% vs. 49%, p = 0.33).
Safety
Adverse events were reported for 49 (34.0%) LMWF-5A-
treated patients (Table 3). The most commonly occurring
AE was arthralgia, reported in 19 (13.2%) patients treated
with LMWF-5A. The majority of AEs were of minor or
moderate severity and unrelated to treatment. There were
no SAEs. AEs reported in this trial are in line with what
has been reported in previous trials of LMWF-5A of over
2000 patients (Table 3). In both trials the most commonly
occurring AE was arthralgia, which is considered a typical
AE for IA injection trials in patients with OAK.
Discussion
This trial was designed to follow on from the completed
single-injection LMWF-5A studies previously described [8]
and confirmed the efficacy of an IA injection of LMWF-5A.
This trial explored the clinical impact of LMWF-5A on the
signs and symptoms of severe OAK using the criteria devel-
oped by OMERACT-OARSI. Using these established cri-
teria, 71% of patients treated with LMWF-5A responded to
treatment, with clinically meaningful improvements in pain
and function, supported by improvements in overall global
assessment of disease. There were no drug-related serious

 AEs associated with treatment with LMWF-5A. The safety
and tolerability profile of LMWF-5A is consistent with pre-
vious studies. To date, treatment with LMWF-5A has re-
sulted in no reported drug-related SAEs.
Clinical trials that evaluate symptom-modifying effects
of treatment often examine composite endpoints that
incorporate the main symptoms of OAK (pain and func-
tional limitations). One of the most widely established com-
posite endpoints is the OMERACT-OARSI responder [16]
because it addresses clinically important and statistically
significant improvements. In prior trials that reported
OMERACT-OARSI responders, rates were reported to
be 50–70% with active treatment across all severity of
OAK (KL grades 1–4) [22–27]. The favorable responder
rate of 71% observed in this study was in a subset with
KL grade 4 OAK. Patients with severe disease have
been shown to have a lower response to treatment than
patients with less severe OAK [28].
There are limitations. First, patients were randomized
to saline to maintain blinding, but since it is not a true
placebo, [19–21] it was not used as the comparator or
powered to make inference about patients receiving
saline. This trial was designed using FDA guidance to
address the methodological issues in trial design where
there is the absence of a true available control, such as
when there are no licensed or approved active comparators
in this distinct OAK population and where the previously
used placebo control has been shown to be therapeutic.
Second, imaging or biomarker data were not collected, and
all outcomes were based on patient-reported outcome
measures. Third, study participants were followed until
week 12. An open label extension study is currently
being conducted to determine the clinical benefit of
LMWF-5A through 52 weeks (Clinicaltrials.gov identi-
fier: NCT03349645).
Conclusions
LMWF-5A appears to be an alternative therapeutic treat-
ment option for patients with severe OAK, by safely and
effectively reducing the signs and symptoms of this debili-
tating symptomatic disease.
