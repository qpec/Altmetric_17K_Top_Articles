Abstract
Introduction—Expert recommendations differ for colorectal cancer screening in the elderly. 
Recent studies suggest that healthy adults aged >75 years may benefit from screening. This study 
examined screening use and follow-up, and how they varied by health status within age strata, 
among a large cohort of elderly individuals in community settings.
Methods—A population-based, longitudinal cohort study was conducted among health plan 
members aged 65–89 years enrolled during 2011–2012 in three integrated healthcare systems

 participating in the Population-Based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized 
Regimens consortium. Comorbidity measurements used the Charlson index. Analyses, conducted 
in 2015, comprised descriptive statistics and multivariable modeling that estimated age by 
comorbidity–specific percentages of patients for two outcomes: colorectal cancer screening 
uptake, and follow-up of abnormal fecal blood tests.
Results—Among 846,267 patients, 72% were up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening. Of 
patients with a positive fecal blood test, 65% received follow-up colonoscopy within 3 months. 
Likelihood of being up-to-date and receiving timely follow-up was significantly lower for patients 
aged ≥76 years than their younger counterparts (p<0.001). Comorbidity was less influential than 
age, and more strongly related to timely follow-up than being up-to-date. In all age groups, 
considerable numbers of patients with no/low comorbidity were not up-to-date or did not receive 
timely follow-up.
Conclusions—In three integrated healthcare systems, many older, relatively healthy patients 
were not screening up-to-date, and some relatively young, healthy patients did not receive timely 
follow-up. Findings suggest a need for re-evaluating age-based screening guidelines and 
improving screening completion among the elderly.
Introduction
Although expert groups in the U.S. are consistent in recommending colorectal cancer (CRC) 
screening for adults aged 50–75 years as a means of reducing CRC mortality, they vary for 
adults aged >75 years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine 
screening in people aged 76–84 years with adequate prior screening, but indicates that those 
in this age group who have not previously been screened should be evaluated to determine 
whether screening is appropriate for them; it recommends against screening people aged ≥85 
years because the benefits of screening are unlikely to outweigh the harms.1 The U.S. 
Multisociety Task Force's guidelines do not specify an upper age limit,2 whereas the 
American College of Physicians recommends discontinuing screening in adults aged >75 
years and in those with a life expectancy <10 years.3 The American Geriatrics Society 
recommends that screening decisions be individualized rather than set only by age.4 This 
position is reinforced by results from recent studies5–7 indicating that people aged >75 years 
without terminal illnesses may benefit from screening.
Understanding completion of CRC screening in the elderly may help in developing more-
informed screening recommendations. Improved knowledge about this population is 
important given the rapid growth in numbers of people in the U.S. aged ≥65 years8 and 
because CRC is largely a disease of the elderly, with nearly 25% of cases diagnosed among 
those aged 75–84 years.9 There are knowledge gaps about CRC screening in older 
populations, though. Some studies indicated screening use is lower in the elderly and in 
those with comorbid conditions.10–15 Others have found that older patients and those with 
comorbidities are more likely to be up to date with screening, possibly because of their more 
frequent contact with the healthcare system.16–19 There also is lack of understanding of the 
full screening process, as prior studies have focused primarily on uptake, or one-time 
screening, rather than the multiple components of the screening process (uptake, follow-up 
of abnormal results, rescreening, or surveillance).

 It is therefore difficult to determine whether CRC screening is being used appropriately in 
the elderly, especially among those with comorbid conditions. As viewed within the IOM's 
quality of healthcare framework,20 screening people who might not benefit owing to 
advanced age or poor health status is a form of healthcare overuse.20–25 Conversely, older 
adults with excellent health status might benefit from screening, and not offering it solely on 
the basis of their chronological age represents a form of healthcare underuse. Finally, lack of 
follow-up of positive screening tests may reflect system breakdown or, for older patients 
who decline follow-up, a misuse of healthcare resources.26
This study examined the influence of age and comorbidity on CRC screening use and 
follow-up of abnormal tests in a multicenter, community-based cohort of elderly patients. 
An assessment of screening use and follow-up among a large cohort of older patients, and 
how they may vary by health status within age strata, has not previously been undertaken. 
Study findings may help to inform clinical practice and health policy decisions regarding use 
of CRC screening among the elderly.
Methods
Study Setting and Design
This study was conducted within the National Cancer Institute-funded Population-Based 
Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) consortium. 
PROSPR's goal is to conduct multisite, coordinated, transdisciplinary research to evaluate 
and improve cancer screening processes. The ten PROSPR research centers reflect the 
diversity of U.S. delivery system organizations. This study used data derived from three 
integrated healthcare systems studying the CRC screening process within PROSPR.27 Group 
Health provides health coverage and care to approximately 600,000 members in Washington 
State and northern Idaho. Kaiser Permanente, Northern California and Kaiser Permanente, 
Southern California are integrated healthcare plans that serve a combined membership of 
about 7 million people. These systems contributed data on patients aged 65–89 years who 
were enrolled during January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012. For Group Health, the 
patients included in this study were paneled with primary care providers in Group Health 
Medical Centers, because data on these patients are relatively complete. Patient 
demographics, health status, and healthcare utilization data were obtained from the systems’ 
electronic clinical and administrative databases and submitted in standardized, structured 
formats to PROSPR's central data repository. Patients with a history of partial or total 
colectomy or invasive CRC were excluded. Comprehensive patient data for prior screening 
history were retrospectively available in electronic databases to 2006 for Group Health and 
to 1999 for Kaiser Permanente, Northern California and Southern California. Further details 
about PROSPR data, the CRC research centers, and their healthcare systems have been 
published.27
The influence of elderly patients’ age and comorbidity on two outcomes was evaluated:
1.
being up-to-date with CRC screening; and

among those screened with fecal blood tests (i.e., fecal immunochemical 
test or guaiac-based fecal occult blood test), the likelihood of receiving 
follow-up colonoscopy within 3 months after a positive test result.
The term “up-to-date” is used to reflect recency of screening only, and is not a measure of 
guideline compliance. To ensure a sufficient look-back period for ascertaining CRC 
screening status as well as a 1-year look-forward period for assessing follow-up, the cohort 
was restricted to members continuously enrolled with no more than a 90-day enrollment gap 
during calendar year 2011. The final study population included 846,267 elderly individuals. 
All activities were approved by the IRBs at each research center and the PROSPR Statistical 
Coordinating Center.
Measures
Comorbidity was measured with the Charlson index28 by applying a standardized electronic 
algorithm to the ICD-9-CM codes associated with inpatient and outpatient care episodes 
during calendar year 2010. The enhanced ICD-9-CM coding scheme of Quan et al.29 was 
used to identify comorbid conditions and generate a comorbidity score for each patient. 
Patients were grouped into five categories (0, 1, 2, 3, and ≥4), with higher scores 
representing a greater burden of illness, or poorer health status.
Other covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI measured in 2010, type of health 
insurance coverage, and whether the patient had a visit to a primary care physician (PCP) 
and the number of healthcare provider visits in 2011.
Patients’ CRC screening status was measured as up-to-date (or not) as of December 31, 
2011. Patients classified as up-to-date (regardless of age) had completed a fecal blood 
testing kit during the period January 1, 2010–December 31, 2011, sigmoidoscopy during 
January 1, 2007–December 31, 2011, or colonoscopy during January 1, 2002–December 31, 
2011. Patients receiving in-office fecal blood testing (CPT code 82272) were classified as 
not up-to-date.
Information on fecal blood testing completion date and result (positive versus negative) was 
used to calculate the time from the date of a positive test to the date of colonoscopy. For 
patients who completed more than one fecal blood test during January 1, 2010–December 
31, 2011 (n=146,178), the most recent abnormal test was used in assessing timely follow-up. 
Timely follow-up was defined as receipt of colonoscopy within 3 months of the abnormal 
result.30 The length of the follow-up period varied by patient, depending on the date on 
which the test was completed. The minimum follow-up period was 12 months; the 
maximum was 36 months (median, 23 months). Patients who disenrolled, reached age 90 
years, or died within 3 months following an abnormal test were excluded from the timely 
follow-up assessment (n=20).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize elderly patients’ demographics, health status, 
healthcare access/utilization, and CRC screening and follow-up status. Percentages of 
patients up-to-date with screening and having timely follow-up were then calculated by age

 group, adjusting for comorbidity, and by comorbidity group, adjusting for age. Multivariable 
logistic regression models that included age by comorbidity interaction terms were fit to 
assess the joint association of age and comorbidity on the likelihood of:
1.
being up-to-date with screening versus not; and
2.
receiving timely follow-up versus not, adjusting for all demographic (age, 
sex, race/ethnicity), health status (comorbidity, BMI), and healthcare 
access/utilization (health insurance type, recent PCP visit, number of 
healthcare visits, PROSPR site) characteristics in each model.
Model results, shown in the Appendix, were used to estimate age by comorbidity–specific 
percentages (i.e., predictive margins) of patients who were screening up-to-date, or had 
received timely follow-up. The predictive margin for a specific group represents the average 
predicted response if everyone in the study population had been in that group.31,32 Bootstrap 
resampling methods were used to calculate 95% CIs for the predictive margins. Owing to 
large sample sizes, the CI widths were very narrow and therefore are not displayed on the 
graphs in the data presentation. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess whether the 
influence of age and comorbidity on screening up-to-date varied by length of enrollment; 
there were no differences when comparing results for all patients versus restricted to patients 
with ≥10 years (Kaiser Permanente, Northern California and Southern California) or ≥6 
years (Group Health) of enrollment (data not shown).
Analyses were conducted in 2015 using SAS, version 9.4 and R, version 3.2.3.
Results
Sixty-four percent of study members were aged 65–75 years, while 28% were aged 76–84 
years and 8% were aged 85–89 years (Table 1). One half had a Charlson score of 0, 21% had 
a score of 1, 20% had scores of 2 or 3, and 10% had a score of ≥4. Fifty-five percent were 
female and 61% were non-Hispanic white. Ninety percent had both Medicare and 
commercial health insurance coverage. More than 90% had a PCP visit in 2011, whereas 5% 
had no healthcare provider visits in that year. Seventy-two percent had been continuously 
enrolled in the healthcare systems for ≥10 years.
Seventy-two percent of study members were up-to-date with CRC screening (Table 2). This 
ranged from 86% for those aged 70–75 years to 32% for those aged 85–89 years, and from 
73% for individuals with a Charlson score of 0 or 1 to 70% for those with a score of ≥4. Of 
those who were up-to-date, 38% were screened by fecal blood testing only, 36% by 
colonoscopy only, 8% by sigmoidoscopy only, and 18% by a combination of tests. Among 
those aged 65–69 and 70–75 years, screening with fecal blood testing only was most 
common, followed by colonoscopy only (Figure 1A). Among patients aged >75 years, the 
percentages up-to-date by colonoscopy only were similar to those for the younger age 
groups, but lower percentages were up-to-date by fecal blood testing. When examined by 
Charlson score groupings, screening with fecal blood testing only was less common with 
increasing comorbidity (Figure 1B).

 Multivariate-adjusted percentages of patients who were up-to-date with screening are shown 
in Figure 2A. Patients aged 70–75 years with a Charlson score of 0 were the most likely to 
be up-to-date (89%); the likelihood of being up-to-date decreased with greater comorbidity 
to 84% for patients with a Charlson score of ≥4. The percentages of patients who were up-
to-date were slightly lower among those aged 65–69 years, ranging from 88% for those with 
a Charlson score of 0 to 82% for those with a score of ≥4. Significantly lower percentages of 
patients aged 76–84 and 85–89 years were up-to-date. For example, 56% of patients aged 
76–84 years with a Charlson score of 0 were up-to-date, as were 56% of patients in this age 
group with a score of ≥4. Among patients aged 85–89 years, 30% of those with a Charlson 
score of 0 were up-to-date, increasing to 37% for patients with a score of ≥4. All age group 
and comorbidity score pairwise comparisons were statistically significant (p<0.001).
Among patients screened with fecal blood testing, 8.5% had a positive result, and 65% of 
those received timely follow-up (Table 2). Timely follow-up was highest for patients aged 
65–69 years (69%) and lowest for those aged 85–89 years (37%); it was highest for patients 
with a Charlson score of 0 (69%) and lowest for those with a score of ≥4 (53%).
Multivariate-adjusted percentages of patients who received timely follow-up are shown in 
Figure 2B. The percentages of patients receiving timely follow-up were highest for the 
younger age groups and decreased with greater comorbidity. Among patients aged 65–69 
years with a Charlson score of 0, 75% received timely follow-up, compared with 57% of 
those with a score of ≥4. In patients aged 70–75 years, 71% of those with a Charlson score 
of 0 received timely follow-up, decreasing to 54% for patients with a Charlson score of ≥4. 
Among patients aged 76–84 years with a Charlson score of 0, 63% received timely follow-
up, compared with 45% of those with a score of ≥4. In those aged 85–89 years, 43% of 
patients with a Charlson score of 0 received timely follow-up, compared with 29% of those 
with a score of ≥4. All age group and comorbidity score pairwise comparisons were 
statistically significant (p<0.001).
Discussion
Completion of CRC screening—including follow-up of abnormal tests—among the elderly 
is an understudied area that is important for patients, clinicians, policymakers, and 
researchers to consider so that screening resources are directed to those who may benefit 
most. This study used data from a multisite research consortium that is evaluating cancer 
screening processes in community settings to assess how patient age and comorbidity are 
related to CRC screening completion, and found that 72% of all individuals aged 65–89 
years were up-to-date with screening. Of those up-to-date by fecal blood testing and having 
a positive result, 65% received follow-up colonoscopy within 3 months. However, these 
estimates varied by patient age and comorbidity. Age was more strongly related than 
comorbidity to both screening up-to-date and timely follow-up. Comorbidity was more 
strongly related to timely follow-up than to screening up-to-date. In all age groups, 
considerable numbers of patients with no or low comorbidity were not up-to-date with 
screening or did not receive timely follow-up.

 The finding that age has greater influence than comorbidity on CRC screening use in the 
elderly is consistent with practice guidelines that emphasize age cut offs in determining who 
should be screened.1,3 The physicians and health systems represented in this study appear to 
be adhering to age-focused guidelines. Yet, evidence from clinical trials and simulation 
models and some guidelines are evolving to reflect the varied health status of the elderly 
population.33,34 In particular, the concept of “health-adjusted age” has been introduced in 
recognition of healthy seniors who exceed chronological age limits and may benefit from 
screening.6,35 However, the lack of tools to assist clinicians and elderly patients in shared 
decision making about screening that incorporates the patient's age, health status, 
preferences, and ability to tolerate screening tests and interventions presents a significant 
challenge to implementing guidelines that call for more-individualized recommendations. 
Moreover, the quality metrics measuring clinicians’ screening performance in many 
healthcare systems will need to be modified to support individualized as opposed to age-
based screening.33
The finding that the likelihood of receiving timely follow-up after a positive fecal blood test 
decreases with increasing age and comorbidity is especially concerning, because the elderly 
patients in this study were all insured members of integrated healthcare systems with 
comprehensive patient tracking, advice, and proactive scheduling of colonoscopy 
appointments that many small primary care practices lack.36,37 Initiating fecal blood testing 
in elderly patients without ensuring a desire for and receipt of timely follow-up is a potential 
misuse of healthcare resources. The elderly may present special challenges to completing 
timely follow-up because of such issues as mobility limitations, transportation barriers, and 
difficulties with pre-colonoscopy bowel preparation. More in-depth examination of the 
patient, provider, and healthcare system factors that affect follow-up in the elderly is needed.
Of particular note were the elderly patients in all age groups with low or no comorbidity 
who were not screening up-to-date or did not receive timely follow-up. Evidence and some 
expert groups indicate that relatively healthy adults aged >75 years may benefit from 
screening.1,2,4–7 The importance of timely follow-up for anyone undergoing cancer 
screening is also widely acknowledged. Especially because more than 90% of the elderly 
patients in this study had a recent PCP visit, these results point to the need for improved 
communication about and monitoring systems for CRC screening among patients aged ≥65 
years.
Limitations
Study limitations include lack of information on patient preferences for CRC screening, 
functional limitations, and family history of CRC. The measure of screening up-to-date was 
a prevalence outcome ascertained with retrospective data, and true CRC screening status 
may have been underascertained. For some patients, only limited information on CRC 
testing prior to the study period was available, and chart review to determine CRC screening 
status prior to healthcare system enrollment was not conducted. Timely follow-up of positive 
fecal occult blood testing/fecal immunochemical testing may have been slightly 
overestimated because a small proportion of patients (<10%) had more than one positive 
fecal occult blood test/fecal immunochemical test, and the study assessed timely follow-up

 for the most recent as opposed to the first positive test. Differences in CRC screening and 
follow-up policies and practices attributable to clinicians or facilities were not fully 
captured. Comorbidity was measured with the Charlson index, which does not fully 
incorporate disease severity nor some conditions such as depression, arthritis, and 
osteoporosis that are common in the elderly. Finally, although the study did not distinguish 
between procedures done for screening versus diagnostic purposes, including all procedures 
is an acceptable approach when estimating the percent of patients up-to-date with CRC 
screening.38
Conclusions
In the U.S, CRC is a common and costly disease, and its burden is borne largely by the 
elderly.8,39 This study documented underuse of both CRC screening and timely follow-up 
among a large cohort of elderly patients who were members of three integrated healthcare 
systems in the western U.S. Findings support those of a recent study showing low national 
rates of both CRC screening and provider recommendation among U.S. seniors aged 76–84 
years.40 There are many opportunities for improvement in screening completion among the 
elderly. Primary care practices need to develop and integrate systems to support individual 
decision making, including risk assessment tools that consider age and comorbidity in 
estimates of benefits and harms. Information about invasive follow-up tests should be 
presented at the time of initial screening to ascertain patient preferences and willingness to 
complete the entire screening process.41 More research is needed to understand facilitators 
of and barriers to completing CRC screening, including timely follow-up of abnormal tests, 
in the elderly. Multilevel interventions addressing patient-, provider-, and system-level 
factors also are needed to support appropriate use and completion of screening in this 
population.
