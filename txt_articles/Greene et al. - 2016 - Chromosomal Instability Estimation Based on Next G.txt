Abstract
Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer often associated with poor patient outcome and
resistance to targeted therapy. Assessment of genomic instability in bulk tumor or biopsy
can be complicated due to sample availability, surrounding tissue contamination, or tumor
heterogeneity. The Epic Sciences circulating tumor cell (CTC) platform utilizes a non-
enrichment based approach for the detection and characterization of rare tumor cells in
clinical blood samples. Genomic profiling of individual CTCs could provide a portrait of can-
cer heterogeneity, identify clonal and sub-clonal drivers, and monitor disease progression.
To that end, we developed a single cell Copy Number Variation (CNV) Assay to evaluate
genomic instability and CNVs in patient CTCs. For proof of concept, prostate cancer cell
lines, LNCaP, PC3 and VCaP, were spiked into healthy donor blood to create mock patient-
like samples for downstream single cell genomic analysis. In addition, samples from seven
metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients were included to evalu-
ate clinical feasibility. CTCs were enumerated and characterized using the Epic Sciences
CTC Platform. Identified single CTCs were recovered, whole genome amplified, and
sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 500. CTCs were then analyzed for genome-wide
copy number variations, followed by genomic instability analyses. Large-scale state transi-
tions (LSTs) were measured as surrogates of genomic instability. Genomic instability
scores were determined reproducibly for LNCaP, PC3, and VCaP, and were higher than
white blood cell (WBC) controls from healthy donors. A wide range of LST scores were
observed within and among the seven mCRPC patient samples. On the gene level, loss of
the PTEN tumor suppressor was observed in PC3 and 5/7 (71%) patients. Amplification of
the androgen receptor (AR) gene was observed in VCaP cells and 5/7 (71%) mCRPC
patients. Using an in silico down-sampling approach, we determined that DNA copy num-
ber and genomic instability can be detected with as few as 350K sequencing reads. The

 data shown here demonstrate the feasibility of detecting genomic instabilities at the single
cell level using the Epic Sciences CTC Platform. Understanding CTC heterogeneity has
great potential for patient stratification prior to treatment with targeted therapies and for
monitoring disease evolution during treatment.
Introduction
Cancer is a genetic disease. The accumulation of genetic and epigenetic lesions in response to
environmental exposures to carcinogens and/or random cellular events often results in the
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes that play critical roles in the maintenance of cell cycle,
DNA replication and DNA repair [1,2]. Loss or inhibition of cellular DNA repair mechanisms
often results in an increased mutation burden and genomic instability. Genomic instability is
an important driver of sub-clonal heterogeneity and is frequently observedin solid tumors
between different lesions [3,4], within the same tumor [5,6], and even within the same solid
biopsy site [7–9]. The resulting increase in tumor cell heterogeneity and the presence of multi-
ple sub-clonal driver alterations complicate therapeutic intervention with targeted therapies
aimed at inhibiting a single molecular target [5,6].
Copy number variations (CNV) are prevalent across many cancer types [2]. The corre-
sponding gain of oncogenes and/or loss of tumor suppressors are frequent drivers of disease
progression, and are correlated with therapeutic response or resistance [10,11]. For example,
PTEN loss is frequent in many tumor types and is associated with sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors
[12], whereas human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) amplification in breast cancer is
tested for guiding HER2 targeted therapy [13]. In addition to the identification of focal CNV
driver alterations, genome-wide CNV profiles can be used to characterize genomic instability
[14,15], often associated with therapeutic response. Increased frequency of large-scale state
transitions (LST) genome wide (the number of CNV breakpoints >10Mb) and LOH, have
been associated with therapeutic response for both platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP
inhibitors [16–18].
Measurement of copy number alterations is currently most assessable via surgical specimen
or biopsy, although not without complication. The biopsy process can be invasive and prone to
sampling error due to intra-tumor heterogeneity and the state of disease progression [19,20],
and may not reflect the dynamic and heterogeneous tumor cell population. As a result, liquid
biopsy approaches have been developed to understand disease progression in real time from a
non-invasive blood draw, through analysis of either cell-free DNA (cfDNA) or circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) that are present in patients’ blood [21–24].
The detection of focal CNV events from isolated cfDNA samples is possible [11]; however,
this method can only detect gene amplifications or genetic mutations. Detection of tumor sup-
pressor loss and genomic instability from cfDNA are complicated by the relatively small
amount of tumor-derived DNA in cfDNA, by the lack of whole genome coverage and by the
presence of CNV alterations at sub-clonal levels [25].
Recent studies have demonstrated that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) reflect tumor hetero-
geneity and represent the active metastatic population more accurately than archival tumor
biopsy [26]. While other CTC detection methods rely on positive selection based on cell surface
marker expression, or enrichment of CTCs based on size, morphology, or depletion of CD45
+ cells, the Epic Sciences CTC Platform utilizes a non-enrichment approach to detect Cytoker-
atin positive (CK)+, CK-, cluster, and apoptotic CTCs [27–29], and is well-suited for

 characterizing heterogeneous sub-clonal populations of CTCs in metastatic disease. In this
study we analyzed both traditional CD45-/CK+ CTCs and CD45-/CK- CTCs. Previous studies
have shown that DNA from individual CTCs can be whole genome amplified and sequenced
to identify loss of tumor suppressors or gain of oncogenes, and to identify sub-clonal popula-
tions of CTCs within heterogeneous populations [8,10,30,31].
Building on this work, we developed a reproducible genomic assay integrated with the Epic
Sciences CTC Platform to further characterize CTCs for the presence of sub-clonal tumor sup-
pressor loss, oncogene amplification and genomic instability with single cell resolution. Here,
we present an analytical validation of a single-CTC CNV assay on the Epic Sciences CTC Plat-
form and demonstrate its feasibility and clinical relevance in a small cohort of mCRPC patient
samples. The assay demonstrates the technical capability to expand our understanding of sub-
clonal evolution in cancer and can be used to further elucidate the role of genomic instability as
a mechanism of resistance to therapy.
Materials and Methods
Sample Processing
For cell line controls, healthy donor blood was collected in Cell-free DNA BCT™ (Streck) tubes,
spiked with cell line cells, and the slides were prepared and stained as previously described
[27]. For patient samples, peripheral blood samples from seven (7) patients with metastatic cas-
tration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were collected in CellSave tubes (Janssen Diagnos-
tics) and shipped to Epic Sciences (San Diego, CA) at ambient temperature, and processed
onto slides as previously described[26,27]. Briefly, red blood cells were lysed, and all nucleated
cells were deposited onto glass microscopy slides at a density of 3 x 106 cells/slide and stored at
-80°C prior to staining. Three cell lines representative of prostate cancer with known genetic
changes were used: VCaP (ATCC catalog #CRL-2876), LNCaP (ATCC catalog #CRL-1740),
and PC3 (ATCC catalog #CRL-1435).
CTC Enumeration
Slides were stained with a cocktail of CK antibodies to identify CTCs, CD45 to detect white
blood cells (WBCs), DAPI to stain cell nuclei, and Androgen Receptor (AR) antibody to detect
AR protein. Stained slides were scanned using Epic Sciences’ rapid fluorescent scanning
method and analyzed using a multi-parametric digital pathology algorithm to detect CK+/
AR+/-/CD45-/DAPI+ CTC candidates. For patient samples, 2 slides per sample were tested for
CTC enumeration and N-terminal AR expression as describedpreviously [27]. Classification
of the CTC candidates identified by the algorithm was confirmed by trained technicians. After
staining, slides were stored at -80°C before further processing.
Cell Isolation, Amplification, and Next-Generation Sequencing
Individual CTCs were identified by the Epic Sciences’ rapid fluorescent scanning method and
X/Y coordinates for each CTC were recorded. Non-apoptotic CTCs were relocated on the slide
using an inverted fluorescent microscope, and single cells were individually isolated into PCR
tubes using an Eppendorf TransferMan NK4 micromanipulator. For cell line controls, multiple
single cell replicates (8 LNCaP, 8 PC3, 5 VCaP, and 4 WBCs) were processed from each cell
line and WBCs. For patient CNV analysis, 67 individual CTCs from the 7 mCRPC samples
were sequenced. A subset of patient CTCs with diverse phenotypes were selected for sequenc-
ing based on nuclear size, CK expression, and N-term AR expression. Single cells were lysed in
1.5 μL of high pH lysis buffer as describedpreviously [10]. Single cell whole genome

 amplification (WGA) was performed using SeqPlex Enhanced (Sigma), and NGS libraries were
constructed with NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) using 100 ng of
WGA DNA, as per manufacturers’ recommendations, with minor modifications. Library size
distributions were analyzed on a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical), and library con-
centrations were determined by real-time PCR (NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina,
NEB). Libraries were pooled in equinanomolar ratios and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq
500 using a High Output kit in a Paired-End 2x150 format (PE 2x150).
PTEN FISH
PTEN FISH was performed on separate slides containing at least 3 or more enumerated CTCs,
as describedpreviously [26]. Briefly, a Cymogen Dx 2-color probe specific to PTEN and chro-
mosome 10 centromeres (CEP10) was used, and slides were counterstained with DAPI. As an
internal control on every slide, 20 WBCs were evaluated for PTEN, and each CTC was classified
for PTEN loss according to the number of FISH signals: PTEN homozygous (HO) loss
(PTEN = 0 and CEP10 � 1), Hemizygous (HE) loss (PTEN = 1 and CEP10 � 1), or Non-
Deleted (PTEN � 2 and CEP10 � 1), and a PTEN call was made for each sample based upon
the scoring algorithm as previously described[26].
Patient Samples
Blood samples were collected at screening from patients with histologically confirmed mCRPC
with a treatment history of docetaxel-basedchemotherapy (including docetaxel and/or cabazi-
taxel), and who had progressed during treatment with at least one hormonal therapy (luteiniz-
ing hormone-releasing hormone, bicalutamide, etc.), and showed radiographic evidence of
disease progression or showed two rising PSA levels that meet the Prostate Cancer Working
Group 2 (PCWG2) consensus criteria [32] prior to enrollment in the clinical trial
(NCT01485861). The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guide-
lines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients from the following sites participated in this
study: Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, and Pacific
Hematology Oncology Associates. Studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards
(IRB) at Karmanos Cancer Institute, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, and Pacific Hematology
Oncology Associates. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enroll-
ment, in agreement with approved protocols from respective ethics committees at every site.
Patient CTC counts and metrics are summarized in Table 1.
Data Analysis
Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA, http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net) was used to map FASTQ
files to the Hg38 human reference genome (UCSC, http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/
goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/) and alignment (BAM) files were generated. BAM files were filtered
for quality using MAPQ30 as a cutoff and PCR duplicate reads were also removed. The filtered
alignment files were further processed using two separate pipelines (Fig 1). To generate a CNV
analysis control genome from single cell WGA DNA, 15 WBCs were collected from different
human adult male individuals without hematological disease and were used as a universal ref-
erence. For each sample, read counts per bin (window size per bin varies between two pipelines,
see below) were normalized proportionally to bring the total read counts to 1 million. Then
median, mean, and standard deviation (sd) of normalized reads number of these controls were
calculated for each bin for further use.
Analysis pipeline 1 was utilized for genomic instabilities estimation. Approximately 3000
bins of 1 million base pairs each were generated from the Hg38 human reference genome.

 After sequencing, reads were counted within each bin for each sample. For each sample, read
counts per bin were normalized proportionally to make the total read counts to 1 million, fol-
lowed by GC content adjustment for each bin. Sample codes for this analysis have been pub-
lished previously [33,34]. Median values of each bin read counts of WBC controls were used to
exclude low coverage bins from downstream analyses (<100 reads). Ratios between test sam-
ples and WBC controls were calculated and reported after Log2 transformation. Chromosomal
segments were predicted using R Bioconductor package DNAcopy (alpha = 0.05), see the sam-
ple code from the literature [33,34] which determined break points where DNA copy number
changed. LSTs were calculated as number of chromosomal breaks between adjacent regions of
at least 10 Mb. Patterns of whole genome copy number variations were visualized with Circos
[35].
Analysis pipeline 2 was used to calculated copy number alterations for individual genes.
RefSeq gene hg38 coordinates were downloaded from UCSC genome browser. To improve the
specificityof copy number calling for shorter genes (< 100K bp between the start and end posi-
tion of the transcript on the genome), the gene coordinates were equally extended at both 5’
and 3’ ends of locus the to have a final span of 100K bp. Reads were counted within each gene’s
final coordinates, and the counts were normalized to 1 million total and to GC content. Low
coverage bins (<10 reads in WBC controls) were removed from downstream analysis. Ratios
between test samples and WBC controls were calculated and reported after Log2 transforma-
tion. Z scores were calculated for each gene by comparing the test sample and WBC controls,
Z ¼ X� �
X
S , where X is the normalized copy number of the test sample, �
X is the average copy
number from the universal WBC reference, and S is the standard deviation from the universal
reference. The single cell level cut-off for gene amplification is Z score >3; for deletion it is Z
score <-3 [36]. At the patient level, amplification or deletion of a single gene needed to be
observedon at least two CTCs for classification as alteration.
One BAM file from a single cell with the highest number of reads from each cell line
(LNCaP, PC3, and VCaP), was randomly subsampled with SAMtools (e.g. samtools view -s
0.50). New BAM files were generated with 50%, 25%, 10% randomly selected reads. Genomic
instabilities were determined on the subsampled BAM files to estimate the minimal reads
requirement.
Post-sequencing data Quality Control (QC) criteria was developed to measure data quality
and library complexity. The criteria included minimum sequencing reads (>350K) and resid-
ual over reads ratio (>1.9), which was calculated as the ratio of residuals of LOESS fitting (Bio-
conductor LOESS function) over total sequencing reads.
Results
Cell Line Single CTC Identification, Isolation, WGA, and Sequencing
LNCaP, PC3, and VCaP cell lines were selected as representative prostate cancer cell lines with
known genomic aberrations. LNCaP cells are characterized by a heterozygous PTEN deletion,
VCaP cells harbor an amplification of the androgen receptor (AR) on the X chromosome, and
PC3 cells have a homozygous PTEN deletion [37]. Cells were imaged using 4 channels: DAPI,
CK, AR, and CD45. The presence of CK expression and lack of CD45 expression combined
with intact DAPI meets the standard definition of CTC and is consistent with their epithelial
origin [23,38]. The lack of AR protein in PC3 cells, despite an intact AR gene, is consistent with
previously published studies [37,39]. The very high levels of AR protein in VCaP cells is consis-
tent with a previously published AR gene amplification [40]. Representative immunofluores-
cent images from LNCaP, PC3, and VCaP cell lines stained with CK, AR, CD45, and DAPI are
shown (Fig 2A–2C).

 Eight LNCaP cells, 8 PC3 cells, 5 VCaP cells, and 4 WBCs were individually isolated for
WGA and sequencing library preparation. The mean WGA yield was 578 ng (n = 25, with a
range of 227–1190 ng) (Fig 3A). The mean library yield was 581 ng (n = 23, with a range of
397–1216 ng) (Fig 3B). While 100% of the single cells isolated had sufficient WGA DNA con-
centrations, 23/25 (92%) of the NGS libraries passed QC with adequate yield and were further
processed for sequencing. An average of 17 million reads/sample (n = 23, with a range of 13–
22 million) were obtained. 99% of the reads mapped to the reference genome (hg38) with 79%
of the reads mapping with a MAPQ score greater than 30 (Fig 3C).
Single Cell Sequencing Reproducibility in Cell Lines
Whole genome CNV profiles from single cells of LNCaP, PC3, VCaP and WBCs were log2
normalized to visualize areas of amplification or deletion. The copy number profiles from each
of the independent biological replicates from LNCaP, PC3, and VCaP cell lines (S1A–S1C Fig)
demonstrate the reproducibility of the assay in that consistent CNVs are detected in all biologi-
cal replicates within a cell line. Representative copy number profiles from each cell line and the
WBC control are shown in Fig 4A–4D. Correlation coefficientsacross replicates of LNCaP,
PC3, VCaP and WBCs were used to estimate the copy number analysis reproducibility (Fig
4E). Absolute Pearson correlation values from 0–100% within and between cell lines are repre-
sented as a circular diagram using Circos Table Viewer (http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/tableviewer/).

 Each segment is color coded, denoting a cell line replicate. Links connecting each segment are
represented as ribbons, the width of which corresponds proportionally to the degree of correla-
tion. Intra-cell line replicates show thick ribbons connecting with each other, whereas inter-cell
lines show thin ribbons, indicating that the assay is highly reproducible within each cell line. To
further assess the reproducibility of our single cell sequencing, we analyzed single cells, pools of 5
cells, and pools of 10 cells, in replicates of 5 each for the LNCaP, PC3 and VCaP cell lines. Cells
were pooled prior to WGA and analyzed by NGS. Replicate samples were combined for further
analysis by calculating the median value of normalized copy number for each gene. The Pearson
correlation coefficientswere calculated for every pair of samples. The correlation analysis indi-
cated that regardless of the number of cells sequenced, CNV profiles for all replicates correlated
highly within each cell line, but not across cell lines (S1 Table). These data also indicate that copy
number variations that were observedfor each cell line were reproducible by our NGS methods,
supporting our method of determining CNVs and genomic instability in a single cell. Further-
more, to determine the rate of false positives called by our assay, we analyzed the incidence of pri-
vate CNV events as calculated by concordance analysis. The incidence of private CNV events,

 reproducibly for LNCaP, PC3, and VCaP, compared to WBC controls. These data are summa-
rized in Table 2. Given the high mutation rates of these cell lines analyzed in bulk [41,42], our
single cell LST analysis recapitulates these findings.
Cell Line CNV Reproducibility
The normalized AR DNA copy number change on chromosome X corresponding to the AR
gene is consistent with a previously published AR gene amplification in VCaP cells [40] (Fig
4G) and with the high expression of the AR protein (Fig 2C). By CNV analysis, AR gene ampli-
fication was observedin 5/5 VCaP cells, but not in any other cell line analyzed or the WBC
controls (Fig 4G).
The normalized PTEN DNA copy number change on chromosome 10 corresponding to the
PTEN gene is consistent with the known PTEN status in these cell lines: null in PC3 and
reduced in heterozygous LNCaP cells but 2 copies in VCaP cells [43–45] (Fig 4H). Based on
our CNV cutoff (Z score > 3 for amplification, or < -3 for loss), 1/8 LNCaP, 6/7 PC3, and 0/5
VCaP cells were called as PTEN loss. 1/3 WBC cells are were called as PTEN loss. No cells ana-
lyzed in this group were observedto have a PTEN amplification. While we detected a reduction
in normalized copy number for PTEN in the LNCaP cells, it did not reach statistical signifi-
cance for deletion for most of the single cells analyzed. This is likely due to the multiploidy
nature of this cell line, which may compress our sensitivity to identify heterozygous loss. In the
1 PC3 cells where PTEN loss was not observed,this was likely due to isolation of a normal
WBC along with the PC3 cell of interest, leading to detection of the 2 copies of PTEN contrib-
uted by the contaminating WBC.
To address the possibility of detecting false CNVs due to the WGA process, we compared
our NGS results to previously published Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays on the
LNCaP and PC3 cell lines [46]. We were able to recapitulate by NGS a subset of genes found to
either be amplified or deleted by SNP array in both cell lines (S2 Table), indicating that our
method can accurately reproduce known CNVs.
Minimal Sequencing Depth Requirement
We estimated the minimal amount of reads required for reliable determination of single cell
genomic instability and other alterations in silico. Our CNV analysis pipeline was performed
on down sampled (50%, 10%, 5% and 1% reads) single cell data from LNCaP, PC3, and VCaP
cells. We observedconsistent genomic instability scores detected with >~350K reads (S1D
Fig), and less reliable genomic instability scores were observedwith lower coverage. Given this
finding, we are using 350K reads as the minimum number of reads cutoff in our QC.

 Genomic Instability is Heterogeneous in Prostate Cancer CTCs
67 CTCs from 7 mCRPC cancer patients were sequenced, and the average number of CTCs
sequenced per patient was 9.57 with a range of 2–17 CTCs per patient. Observedwithin this
patient cohort is a wide range of CTC/mL counts, percentages of CK positive vs CK negative
CTCs, and percentages of AR N-term positive and AR N-term negative CTCs, both within and
between patients, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease.
The distribution of LSTs was evaluated in patient CTCs. The majority of patients presented
unstable CTC genomes except patients 4 and 5, which had few CTCs (2 and 3 CTCs, respec-
tively) (Fig 5A, S3 Table). For patients with unstable genomes, heterogeneous LST scores were
observedwhen analyzed at the single cell level, as summarized in S3 Table.

 AR Copy Number Concordance in Prostate Cancer CTCs
AR DNA amplification was detected in 5 out of 7 patients (patient IDs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7) (Fig 5B),
where a wide range of AR amplification was observedat the inter- and intra-patient level. Con-
sistent with this finding, expression of AR protein (AR N-term) was detected in the same 5 out
of 7 patients (Fig 5C). Significantly higher AR protein expression was observedwithin individ-
ual CTCs harboring AR copy number gain compared to AR neutral CTCs (p = 0.0025) (Fig
5D), suggesting AR gene amplification directly correlates to AR protein expression.
PTEN Copy Number Concordance in Prostate Cancer CTCs
PTEN loss was observedin 5 out of 7 patients (patient IDs 1, 2, 5, 6, 7) using CNV (Fig 5E,
Table 3). To demonstrate concordance using an orthogonal method, single CTCs from the
same patient cohort were analyzed for PTEN loss by FISH. Two patients have homozygous and
one had hemizygous loss of PTEN confirmed by PTEN FISH, which correlated with NGS
results (patient IDs 1, 6, and 2, respectively), whereas 2 patients were classified as non-deleted
by both FISH and NGS (patient IDs 3 and 4) (Table 3). Representative FISH images from dip-
loid and polyploid CTCs are shown in S2 Fig. Summaries of PTEN status as determined by
FISH are shown in S3 Fig.
Discussion
Here we report the analytical and clinical feasibility of integrating single cell CNV analysis with
the Epic Sciences CTC Platform. Focal CNV events and genomic instability, as measured by
the number of LSTs, were reliably detected. The assay demonstrated intra-cell line reproduc-
ibility and accurately recapitulated known CNV events across the three well-characterized
prostate cancer cell lines. Interestingly, VCaP had a similar number of LSTs compared to PC3.
This suggests that LSTs may represent different mechanisms of genomic instability potentially
driven by the loss of different tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN, or impaired DNA repair
pathways. Further clinical studies are planned to understand the clinical significance of this
observation.
We have developed a post-sequencing data QC criterion comparing the ratio of residuals of
LOESS fitting over total sequencing reads, which allows us to reliably filter out the samples not
suitable for genome wide CNV analysis due to poor library complexity. In silico down sampling
of the reads was performed to estimate the minimal number of reads required for detection of
genomic instability scores. This analysis suggests that as few as 350K reads/cell (0.01x coverage)
are required for reproducible assay performance.
We demonstrated the reproducibility of the assay by interrogating genomic changes such as
AR amplification and PTEN loss in cell line cells, in addition to assessing the extent of genomic
instability as a result of these changes. Both array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)

 based and NGS-based CNV analysis methods detect gains and losses relative to the ploidy level
[46,47]. Because the ploidy levels may vary in tumor genomes, the log2 normalized copy num-
ber was calculated using most of the chromosomes as the baseline within each cell. Detection
of gene gains or losses could be complicated or limited by abnormal ploidy. Comparison of
PTEN FISH and sequencing based CNV results could be even further complicated because for
FISH, PTEN deletion was determined by comparing PTEN copy number with chromosome 10
centromeres regardless of whole genome ploidy. In this study, we did the direct comparison of
PTEN FISH results with sequencing CNV results, and some discordance should be accounted
for due to the aforementioned limitations.
On the patient level, a strong correlation was observedbetween genomic AR amplification
and AR protein expression. Five AR amplification patients had CTCs that express AR protein,
while the two patients with normal AR copy numbers had CTCs that are negative for AR pro-
tein expression. Robinson et al. reported that 62.7% of AR aberrations and 71.3% of AR path-
way aberrations were identified in 150 mCRPC patients [45]. This is consistent with recent
study on a larger cohort that demonstrated the potential contribution of AR amplification to
AR activation [48].
PTEN status was consistent in 5/7 patient samples between CNV and FISH with two dis-
crepancies. Patients 5 and 7 were determined as having PTEN loss in CTCs by CNV analysis,
but not by FISH. There were two potential reasons that may have contributed to the discrep-
ancy: sampling error due to a small number of CTCs available for testing or low percentage of
CTCs carrying PTEN loss, or false detection of gene loss in cells with multi-ploidy genomes.
Patient 5 was determined to be PTEN non-deleted by FISH, with 1/19 CTCs harboring a hemi-
zygous PTEN loss, where the sample did not reach the minimum cutoff of 3 CTCs for hemizy-
gous loss by FISH, however by CNV analysis our criteria determined that 1/3 CTCs were
deleted for PTEN resulting in a call of PTEN loss, suggesting low prevalence of PTEN loss in
this patient. For this patient, the difference between FISH and NGS was not significant by Fish-
er’s exact test (p = 0.2597), suggesting that if we analyzed more CTCs by FISH, more PTEN
hemizygous loss cells would be detected. Patient 7 was given an overall classification of PTEN
loss by CNV with 5/15 cells scored as deleted, however 44/44 CTCs were classified as non-
deleted by FISH, with potential polyploidy. The CTCs sequenced from this patient indicate
that there is a high degree of polyploidy across most chromosomes, possibly contributing to
false CNV calls.
The continual reduction of sequencing costs combined with the relatively low number of
reads required to perform this assay enables the analysis of multiple individual CTCs from a
single patient sample. Using a highly multiplexed system with a low number of reads per sam-
ple required to determine copy number changes, our single cell NGS analysis becomes more
cost-effectivethan comparable methods, such as aCGH or SNP arrays. Additionally, our CNV
methods are more sensitive, are less subject to noise, and require approximately 10-fold less
starting material than array-based methods. With the multiplexed analysis by NGS, our system
is capable of analyzing 96 samples simultaneously, increasing the throughput compared to
array-based methods, which is typically limited to 8 samples per chip. Furthermore, these NGS
methods allow for analysis of samples subjected to fixation, which frequently results in DNA of
poor quality, where array-based methods would not be possible [49]. NGS also has an unlim-
ited potential to detect CNVs in every genomic locus simultaneously, providing a clear advan-
tage over other cytologicalmethods, such as FISH, that that are limited by the number of
probes that can be hybridized in a single reaction. Although it is feasible to use low pass whole
genome sequencing to characterize genomic instability by LSTs, the detection of other genomic
instability markers, such as single nucleotide variation (SNV), LOH and micro-satellite insta-
bility, still require allelic frequency information for their detection. Targeted resequencing

 methods from single cells compatible with the Epic Sciences platform are currently being
developed.
While microarray and sequencing-basedCNV assays have been available for years and are
frequently performed from tumor biopsy samples, these assays are limited by the availability of
sufficient amount of sample, tumor purity, biopsy sampling error and intra-tumor heterogene-
ity. The single CTC CNV assay describedhere enables evaluation of tumor heterogeneity, the
presence of genomic driver alterations and genomic instability events that may potentially
affect patient selection and therapeutic efficacy. Here we observedboth inter- and intra-patient
heterogeneity with respect to LSTs, AR amplification and PTEN loss across CTCs. A broad
range of copy number changes in AR and PTEN were observedin most patients analyzed. The
increased resolution of single cell CNV analysis allows for characterization of sub-clonal driver
alterations, their clustering in sub-clonal populations (i.e., private or public alterations), and
the weighted average of targetable pathways within a single patient. These tools will greatly aid
drug development and stratification of patients for therapeutic combination strategies and clin-
ical trials.
