Abstract. Blood-based biomarkers represent a less invasive and potentially cheaper approach for aiding Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) detection compared with cerebrospinal fluid and some neuroimaging biomarkers. Acknowledging that many in the field
have made great progress, here we review some of the work that our group has pursued to identify and validate blood-based
proteomic biomarkers through both case control and AD pathology endophenotype-based approaches. Our focus is primarily
to identify a minimally invasive and hopefully cost-effective blood-based biomarker to reduce screen failure in clinical trials
where participants have prodromal or even pre-clinical disease. We summarize some of the key findings and approaches
taken in these biomarker studies, while addressing the main challenges, including that of limited replication in the field, and
discuss opportunities for biomarker development.
Keywords: Alzheimer’s disease, blood proteomic biomarkers, endophenotype, replication, validation
INTRODUCTION
The health and economic impact of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is enormous and with a projected
increase in numbers of people living with demen-
tia from over 75 million today to over 135 million
by 2050. It is obvious why finding a therapeutic

intervention has become a major strategic goal for
science in many countries. However, despite substan-
tial advances in our understanding of mechanisms of
disease and progress in pre-clinical and early drug
discovery, a series of major failures at phase III has
dented confidence. The scientific field of neurode-
generation research has become confused; is it our
understandingofdiseasethatiswrongorourdevelop-
ment of drugs that is inadequate? Another view is that

evident long before the phase III failures, it might not
be so much the drugs that are failing but that the clin-
ical trials are inadequate. Most trials of efficacy have
been conducted in people with established dementia
and a few in people with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI). This is despite the evidence that the patho-
logical process that the drugs are designed to halt
initiates a decade or more before clinical symptoms
are apparent. Arguably, we should have been more
surprised by a positive outcome in any of these tri-
als than we are by their failure and for trials to have a
reasonable chance of success they will need to be con-
ducted early in the disease process—in prodromal or
preclinical disease and indeed in people who do actu-
ally have the disease process the drugs are designed to
halt, something not always achieved in clinical trials
that have so depressed the field. But to do such tri-
als in people with evidence of disease before clinical
symptoms necessitates the use of biomarkers.
When we entered this field, a little over a decade
ago, there were three reasonably well-developed
biomarkers for AD, now all firmly established and
increasingly used in clinical trials and in some
cases in clinical practice. Structural neuroimaging
has the advantage of being part of routine clinical
practice, principally for the exclusion of other pathol-
ogy, but measures of regional atrophy combined
with advances in automated analysis have enabled
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a marker
of neurodegeneration. More specific to AD, cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) measures of amyloid-� peptide
(A�), total tau (t-tau), and hyperphosphorylated tau
(p-tau) and molecular imaging of amyloid deposi-
tion using positron emission tomography (PET) have
become widely adopted with improving assays and
ligands. These approaches are now established in
diagnostic criteria for AD in prodromal and pre-
clinical phases [1–3] and progress is being made in
supplementing these approaches with other assays in
CSF and with other PET radioligands including the
very promising tau tracers. However, they are lim-
ited by the relative invasiveness of collecting CSF
samples or the high cost and limited access for PET
studies [4, 5].
In part due to these limitations, increasing num-
bers of studies have attempted to find biomarkers
in blood; a tissue that is easily accessible and suit-
able for repeated measures throughout the disease
course or over the time-frame of an interventional
study[6].Previousreviewshavesummarizedmuchof
this growing research effort [7–14]. In this review, for
an anniversary edition of the Journal of Alzheimer’s
Disease, we focus on our findings, describe our
evolving approach, and address some of the main
challenges of the field, along with the suggestions
to improve the reproducibility of biomarker devel-
opment; acknowledging of course that this work is
just one part of a rapidly evolving body of work from
laboratories around the world seeking biomarkers in
readily accessible tissues for clinical trials and for
clinical practice utility.
EARLY DISCOVERY OF BLOOD-BASED
BIOMARKERS OF ALZHEIMER’S
DISEASE
It is important to note that there is no blood-based
biomarker that has got beyond first base, the dis-
covery phase. It remains entirely possible that no
biomarker from blood will ever progress beyond rig-
orous replication studies and enter the even more
taxing qualification and validation phases. Indeed,
when we initiated our first study using proteomics in
blood [15], our starting point was to address the null
hypothesis—that there would be no protein signal
or signature in blood that reflected disease process.
After all, why would there be such a signature when a
supposedly impenetrable barrier separates brain and
blood? However, in this first study, we were able to
reject the null hypothesis and this, together with the
work of Wyss-Coray et al. published soon after [16],
persuaded us that there is a signal in blood; but the
question remains, can that signal be translated to a
replicable and useful biomarker?
Case-Control Approach
Like almost all other biomarker studies, we started
our work using a case-control study design, and this
remains the predominant study type in the literature,
although as we describe below, we are increas-
ingly moving to other approaches. In Table 1, we
summarize the main case-control studies conducted
within our group. In our first study [15], we used
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) cou-
pled with mass spectrometry (MS) comparing people
with established disease to a group of healthy elderly.
For the discovery stage, we tested 100 subjects and
we found nine proteins showing an increase and four
a decrease in AD. Moreover, we were able to iden-
tify cases from controls with a sensitivity of 56% and
a specificity of 80% based on 2DGE image analysis
alone, using machine learning, making a reasonably
powerful case that a signature of disease was present

in blood. We then replicated two of the predomi-
nant proteins contributing to this signature including
complement factor H (CFH) and �-2-macroglobulin
(�2M) in reasonably large independent cohorts (511
subjects). The combination of CFH and �2M gave
a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 60% to dis-
criminate AD from non-AD controls. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first large study to use an
agnostic proteomics approach to seek biomarkers of
AD in peripheral tissue.
Ten years later, both CFH and �2M remain of con-
siderable interest, both as biomarkers and as possible
participants in disease process. When we published
these findings, we noted that the gene encoding CFH
was strongly associated with age-related macular
degeneration, the only other A�-associated disease,
thus suggesting that complement biology might
be a critical factor in AD pathogenesis. This has
been amply substantiated by subsequent genome-
wide association studies where some of the more
strongly associated susceptibility genes are comple-
ment factors and where pathway analysis identifies
complement as one of only three or four biological
processes in disease etiology [17–19]. The finding of
altered levels of CFH in blood in people with AD was
replicated in some but not other independent studies
but was also, intriguingly, found in blood of trans-
genic mouse models of amyloidopathy [20–23]. The
finding in mice [21] is particularly interesting as one
possible confound of the human case-control stud-
ies is that people with AD are systemically unwell,
have altered diet and a multiplicity of other envi-
ronmental changes that could in themselves alter the
blood proteome. None of these is relevant to a mouse
model where the only disease process is confined to
a relatively small part of the brain and the mice, dis-
appointingly for those intending to develop complete
models of disease, remain in robust health. If there is
a change in blood from these animals, and especially
one that as in the case of CFH is measureable very
early in the model development (3–6 months) then
the signal must have been induced in brain and trans-
ferred to blood. How this occurs should be a matter
of very considerable interest. These findings in mice
suggest a role in the disease process and while the
mechanism underlying such a role is not known, we
findthatinneuronsfrommicelackingtheirequivalent
of the AD susceptibility gene CR1, the levels of CFH
and phosphorylated tau are significantly, and sub-
stantially, decreased [24]. Similarly, �2M, identified
in this first proteomic study, has been largely repli-
cated [23, 25–27], associated with other indicators of
AD [28] and altered in blood from APP/PS1 trans-
genic mice [21]. The recently reported associations
between serum �2M levels and tau phosphorylation
states in the brain as well as its potential role as a
sex-specific inflammatory marker in preclinical AD
have been especially interesting [29].
Contrary to our expectations then, this study using
agnostic proteomics not only suggested a signal in
blood in AD but identified components of that sig-
nal that have been widely, albeit not unequivocally
replicated and powerfully linked to etiopathogene-
sis through genomics, through empirical studies in
vitro, and through in vivo models. Rather than aban-
doning blood-based biomarkers and turning to CSF,
we were instead emboldened to advance these studies
and began to do so using other, more advanced, untar-
geted proteomic technologies. For example, using
isobaric tags (tandem mass tags) labelling to enable
multiplexing mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we
identified gelsolin as a possible marker of AD and
then replicated the finding in independent samples
using western blot analysis [30]. Plasma gelsolin was
associatedwithdiseaseseverity,althoughitsaccuracy
to discriminate AD from non-demented controls was
low (area under the curve, AUC = 0.64). Others have
also found association between levels of lower levels
of gelsolin and AD using both an isobaric tag/MS,
untargeted approach [31] and targeted ELISA [32].
Mass spectrometry based discovery tends to iden-
tify predominantly highly abundant proteins, even
when combined with depletion strategies, resulting
in putative biomarkers such as many we discuss
in this article, including gelsolin, being associated
with multiple unrelated diseases. As an alterna-
tive high dimensionality detection technology not
biased toward abundant proteins, we turned to the
aptamer capture, SOMAscan array, developed by
SomaLogic to test 1001 proteins in blood samples
from 691 subjects [33]. We found that prostate-
specific antigen complexed to a1-antichymotrypsin
and pancreatic prohormone were significantly asso-
ciated with AD diagnosis. Furthermore, a panel
of 13 proteins (placenta growth factor, Interleukin-

Coagulation factor XI) predicted AD with an AUC
of 0.70 with several of these analytes replicating
previous studies, including, for example, pancreatic
prohormone [34] and prolactin [35].

The studies we describe in Table 1 all use
essentially agnostic methods to discover novel
biomarkers—proteomic technologies not predicated
on any a priori hypotheses. Sometimes called unbi-
ased proteomics, the analogy with truly unbiased
genomics is not quite right as proteomic technolo-
gies are some way off from being able to measure
all proteins in complex matrices such as blood and
even further away from measuring all characteristics
of proteins including post-translational modification.
Moreover, the current technologies are all, in some
way, biased; MS toward highly abundant proteins and
the SOMAscan technology toward proteins in certain
classes such as inflammation. The relative inattention
paid to post-translational modification in particular is
likelytobeimportantaswediscussinthecaseofclus-
terin below. An alternative approach to using these
agnostic technologies is to take a targeted approach,
measuring proteins nominated because of a possible
role in disease pathogenesis or some other reason.
As an example, we recently performed a systematic
study of proteins involved in the complement path-
way, measuring five complement proteins and four
activation products in AD, MCI, and controls [36].
Overall, we tested 471 subjects and results showed
that only one complement protein (clusterin) differed
significantly between control and AD groups but that
the combination of clusterin and ApoE status was
 L. Shi et al. / A Decade of Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease Research
1185
able to discriminate AD from controls with an AUC
of 0.78. Moreover, along with clusterin, two other
markers (factor I and terminal complement complex)
were significantly different between MCI individuals
who had converted to dementia one year later com-
pared to non-converters. The combination of the three
biomarkers was able to predict MCI conversion to AD
with an AUC of 0.85.
In another radically different approach to targeted
biomarker discovery, we employed true Big Data
analytics to nominate proteins as putative mark-
ers [37]. We used text mining to interrogate the
vast publically available literature and other datasets,
including structured and unstructured databases such
as Medline, AD research forums, gene expression,
and proteomics and genomics databases, to estab-
lish an Intelligence Network based on a shared
vocabulary or terms. We then interrogated this Intelli-
gence Network using pre-defined axioms. These were
essentially descriptors of what an ideal biomarker
might look like; for example, ‘a protein involved
in AD pathogenesis that is expressed in regions of
the brain vulnerable to AD and is not normally
present in plasma’. With this workflow, we iden-
tified a set of putative biomarkers, interestingly,
some of which such as clusterin and transthyretin
(TTR) were independently nominated as biomark-
ers of AD through agnostic proteomics. As a proof
of concept, we chose to explore further two entirely
unexpected and novel proteins (PLAUR and ChAt)
and in a large series of subjects found the former
to be strongly associated with AD and the latter to
have associations with brain volume on imaging.
This study perhaps signposts a truly innovative and
exciting approach to targeted biomarker discovery
that might be developed in future studies; exploit-
ing as it does the vast amount of information in
biological data sources and not being constrained
by the limitations of protein detection technologies
today.
In summary, the case-control studies we, and of
course many other groups, have performed in the
past decade have compellingly rejected the null
hypothesis that there is no protein biomarker signa-
ture in blood. We have used a range of untargeted and
targeted proteomics, and even big data informatics, to
nominate protein markers and those we have identi-
fied have subsequently frequently been found to have
a role in disease pathogenesis. However, it is equally
clear that the size of the biomarker effect is modest at
best and although some of the biomarkers we nom-
inated have been widely replicated, this replication
is not found in all such studies nor for all nominated
biomarkers. Clearly, another approach was needed.
Endophenotype-based approach
Although these case-control studies were promis-
ing, there is an obvious problem in that a biomarker
of established disease, although a starting point for
many studies, is not the outcome we are looking for.
Diagnosis of established dementia is not difficult;
previously we showed both research assistants using
a simple interview and automated algorithms both
make highly accurate diagnoses [38]. Where diag-
nosis is hard is in the very early stages of disease.
Indeed, in order to conduct clinical trials in pre-
clinical disease then a biomarker identifying potential
participants in the absence of symptoms is the real tar-
get for research. And yet in case-control studies, these
individuals are not in the ‘case’ but in the ‘control’
group. As an alternative approach, we designed stud-
ies using ‘endophenotype discovery’. In this, subjects
are allocated not to disease category but to a grouping
or to a continuous variable based on some other mea-
sure of disease such as brain atrophy measured by
structural MRI, rate of cognitive decline, A� plaque
burden measured by PET, and CSF biomarkers (A�
and tau). Many of these changes are detectable before
dementia onset. A� plaque burden, increased levels
of tau in CSF, and brain atrophy are detected 15 years
before expected symptom onset while global cogni-
tive impairment is detected 5 years before symptom
onset [39, 40], suggesting that such a study design
could be effective in detecting blood-based biomark-
ers for preclinical disease.
In the first study to use such an approach, we
performed gel-based proteomics (2DGE and LC-
MS/MS) in two independent groups of subjects with
mild AD with analysis by the endophenotypes of
cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy [41].
We found that clusterin was associated with both
endophenotypes and then showed that the level of
clusterinwasassociatedwithcognitionandotherphe-
notypesinalargecohortof689subjects(464AD,115
MCI, and 110 controls) by ELISA and in a third inde-
pendent cohort that clusterin levels were associated
with brain amyloid burden determined by PET in cog-
nitively unaffected individuals. Two other findings
are worth noting from this work. First we showed that
in transgenic mice carrying mutant human APP/PS1
genes, clusterin was increased in blood at about the
same time as plaques are produced in brain, a finding
identical to that recently reported by Wang et al. [21].
 1186
L. Shi et al. / A Decade of Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Secondly, the data we presented in the paper of the
2DGE results shows clusterin protein to be present
in multiple different regions on the gel. This sug-
gests different forms of protein and as clusterin is
known to be highly glycosylated we subsequently
developed an assay for this post-translational mod-
ification and demonstrated that a glyosylation site
on the beta subunit of clusterin (beta64N) is sig-
nificantly reduced in subjects with relatively more
cerebral atrophy [42]. This is another example, along-
side tau, where an analysis of post-translational
modification may add to the value of a protein
biomarker.
Soon after we completed this study, two major
genome-wide association studies [18, 19] both
reported that the gene encoding clusterin was the
strongest association with AD after APOE, and the
association between clusterin protein levels in blood
and some aspect of disease was repeated by later
studies from our own group [33, 43–45] as well as
those from others [46, 47]. In addition to clusterin,
this study [41] also found that six proteins (comple-
ment C3, �-fibrinogen, serum albumin, complement
factor-I, �-1-microglobulin, and serum amyloid-P)
were associated with hippocampal atrophy and four
proteins (complement component C4a, complement
C8, ApoA1, and TTR) could discriminate fast from
slow progressing AD groups.
Blood-based biomarkers of brain atrophy and
rate of cognitive decline (Table 2)
Again emboldened by a striking result, we then
embarked on a series of blood-based endophenotype
studies, some of which are ongoing. First we repli-
cated six of the proteins nominated in Thambisetty
et al. [41], in an independent cohort of AD (n = 79),
MCI (n = 88), and control (n = 95) subjects using
ELISA and western blot [48]. Results showed that
five (complement components C3 and C3a, comple-
ment factor-I, �-fibrinogen, and �-1-microglobulin),
together with age and sex, could explain more than
35% of variance in whole brain volume in AD
patients, suggesting that these proteins are likely to
be strong predictors of AD pathology. We then con-
firmed the association of TTR with rate of cognitive
decline [49]. Briefly, we firstly tested the level of TTR
by western blot in 140 subjects, and then replicated
it in a larger independent cohort (270 subjects) by
ELISA. Results confirmed that decreased TTR lev-
els were associated with rapid cognitive decline and
severe cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we com-
pared these two immune-based techniques and a good
correlation was observed between western blot and
ELISA (r2 = 0.65).
As well as using this endophenotype approach to
identify novel biomarkers, we have also employed
it to test previously nominated biomarkers. Using
the SOMAscan array, we found that nine pro-
teins previously nominated in case-control studies
(�-1-antitrypsin, Complement C3, Pancreatic pro-
hormone, Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,
Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2, Clus-
terin, Complement C6, Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor
heavy chain H4, and C-C motif chemokine 18) were
also associated with at least one AD-related phe-
notype; clusterin with cognitive decline and seven
others with brain atrophy [45]. Although promising,
some of these apparent associations are in the oppo-
site direction to that predicted from literature studies
emphasizing again the problem of replication in this
field. The most consistent findings though are that
proteins of inflammatory cascades are altered in dis-
ease [50–53] and so we then analyzed a panel of
27 cytokines in a cohort of 351 subjects and com-
pared them with structural MRI measures and rate of
cognitive decline rate [54]. Results showed that five
inflammatory proteins (IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-�,
and IL-13) were associated with brain atrophy and six
(IL-4, IL-10, G-CSF, IL-2, IFN-�, and PDGF) were
associated with fast cognitive decline within one year
of follow-up.
More recently we have tested protein changes
associated with rate of change and progression to
dementia [55] in 235 subjects including 69 con-
trols, 37 ‘stable’ MCI patients, 39 patients with
MCI converting to AD within a year, and 90 AD
patients. Results showed that twelve proteins were
found to significantly associate with the rate of
progression. They include Complement C2, Serum
amyloid A-1 protein, Complement C9, Mannose-
binding protein C, Serum amyloid P-component,
�2-Antiplasmin, CHK1 (Serine/threonine-protein
kinase Chk1), Interleukin-17A, Eukaryotic trans-
lation initiation factor 5A–1, Hemopexin, CDC37
(C-C motif chemokine 19), and Complement factor
H-related protein 5.
Since these various studies appear to nominate
a moderately large set of proteins associated with
decline, whether measured directly, or indirectly
through neuroimaging, we then set out to see if
we could assemble a panel of proteins that would
predict decline. Briefly, we measured twenty-six
previously identified candidate proteins in 1,148 sub-
jects selected from three independent centers [44].

We found that clusterin, Regulated on Activation,
Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES),
neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and TTR were asso-
ciated with cortical atrophy in the MCI group and
�-1-antitrypsin, NSE, ApoC3, ApoA1, ApoE, and
brain derived neurotrophic factor were associated
with brain atrophy in AD group. Furthermore, ApoE,
CFH, neural cell adhesion molecule, A�40, A-1-acid
glycoprotein, and clusterin were all correlated with
cognitive decline. Among these biomarkers, most
replicated our previous findings, e.g., clusterin, TTR,
�-1-antitrypsin, ApoE, and CFH. We then reanalyzed
the data set for predictive value and showed a panel
of 10 protein biomarkers (TTR, clusterin, cystatin C,
A-1-acid glycoprotein, ICAM1, complement com-
ponent C4, PEDF, �-1-antitrypsin, RANTES, and
ApoC3) along with APOE genotype could predict
the conversion from MCI to AD with an accuracy of
87%. Clearly this finding requires replication and it is
important to emphasize the predictive value applies,
by definition, to individuals with MCI and not people
with no symptoms. Even if replicated there would
be no value of such a panel in predicting dementia
in a general population sample and therefore of no

1189
value for screening. However, a test for population
screening is absolutely not the objective of the stud-
ies described in this review. What we are seeking, and
what the field urgently needs is a biomarker that could
be used in clinical trials for selection of participants.
Blood-based biomarkers of brain amyloid
burden measured by PET (Table 3)
The optimal selection marker for use in clini-
cal trials would identify individuals in prodromal or
preclinical phase with AD pathology that are more
likely to progress over the period of the trial, typ-
ically 1-2 years. Clinical trials are moving toward a
selection strategy that includes people with MCI who
also show significant amyloid pathology using PET
imaging; a combination that is the best approxima-
tion to the optimal selection marker today. However,
identifying such individuals is problematical and the
screen failure rate at PET imaging stage is high.
This is costly, exposes large numbers of people to
PET scans, poses a considerable logistics challenge,
and represents a significant hurdle to effective tri-
als recruitment. If a relatively facile (easily obtained,
fast to analyze) biomarker could be found that would
reduce this screen failure, then the process of clini-
cal trials recruitment would be much enhanced. With
this in mind, we set out to employ the endophenotype
design to identify a biomarker that would contribute
totheidentificationofpeoplemostlikelytobeharbor-
ing amyloid pathology (neocortical amyloid burden;
NAB). Note that such a biomarker need only have
relatively modest positive predictive value to have a
substantial impact on cost and speed of recruitment
to clinical trials.
Using samples from the Baltimore Longitudinal
Study of Aging collected from non-demented older
individuals we employed 2DGE/MS proteomics on
plasma collected 10 years prior to 11C-PiB PET scans
and within ± 1 year of the scan [56]. We found 6
proteins (ApoE, haptoglobin, plasminogen, comple-
ment C3, albumin, and IgG) that could discriminate
subjects with high amyloid burden from those with
low burden. Given the association between the APOE
gene and AD risk, we selected this protein for sub-
sequent studies, confirming the strong association
between plasma ApoE concentration and A� burden
in the medial temporal lobe.
In another study [57], we also used an untar-
geted approach to discover biomarkers but this study
included AD, MCI, and cognitively healthy subjects,
who were dichotomized by high or low NAB. Seven-
teen candidate biomarkers were identified and then
replicated by using immunoassays (ELISA) in both
the same and an independent cohort. The technical
replication in the same cohort validated three pro-
teins including �2M, fibrinogen �-chain (FGG), and
factor H-related protein 1 (FHR-1), while an opposite
trend was observed for FHR-1 between discovery and
validation phase. The independent replication in dif-
ferent cohorts found that only FGG was significantly
associatedwithhighA�burden,predictinghighNAB
with a sensitivity of 59% and specificity of 78%.
We then used the same approach (2DGE and
LC-MS/MS) to conduct a longitudinal study testing
samples over a 12-year period from non-demented
older individuals [58]. Briefly, plasma proteins were
assessed for their relationship with NAB at three
time points: 12 years before amyloid PET imaging,
6 years before imaging, and concurrent to imaging.
Proteins that were consistently associated with NAB
at all three time points were chosen as candidates
and further studied in independent cohorts. For the
discovery study, we found seven proteins associated
with NAB consistently across all three time points:
�2M, apolipoprotein A-I (APO-A1), complement
C3, complement C4B, haptoglobin, Ig kappa chain C
region, and serum albumin. In independent cohorts,
we replicated five of these (�2M, serum albumin,
APO-A1, C3, and haptoglobin). This study demon-
strated that blood-based biomarkers remain stable
and could reflect amyloid burden throughout the
course of disease, from the pre-clinical phase through
to established clinical syndromes. Moreover, this
study replicated several biomarkers from our previ-
ous studies, e.g., �2M [57] and complement C3 [56].
In addition to discovery, we have also conducted
several replication studies. For example, in [59], we
tested the association of 146 plasma analytes with
NAB in 71 subjects. Results showed sixteen pro-
teins were found to associate with NAB, including
two proteins (APOE and complement C3) reported
in our previous study [56]. Among these biomark-
ers, some were also found to associate with other
AD related phenotypes. For example, leptin was also
associated with CSF A�1-42, leptin, �-1-antitrypsin,
and cortisol were related to MRI features, and �-
1-antitrypsin, complement C3, and fibrinogen were
associated with cognitive scores, replicating our pre-
vious results [41, 44, 45, 48]. Given that some
proteins were highly correlated with each other,
we therefore chose a panel of thirteen biomark-
ers including c-peptide, fibrinogen, �-1-antitrypsin,
PPY, complement C3, vitronectin, cortisol, AXL
receptor kinase, interleukin-3, interleukin- 13, matrix

panel, coupled with covariates, could account for
more than 30% of variance of brain amyloid burden,
much higher than the covariate factors alone (4-13%).
Furthermore, this panel could predict A� positive
individuals with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity
of 55%, suggesting that plasma proteins could reflect
the levels of A� burden in the brain. If repeated in
other studies, this panel could substantially facilitate
clinical trials by contributing to rapid and effec-
tive selection of research participants most likely to
have NAB and hence reducing screen failure rates,
reducing cost and time of trial start-up and reducing
exposure of potential participants to PET imaging.

Blood-based biomarkers of CSF Aβ (Table 4)
An analogous approach to the search for blood-
based markers to predict NAB is to use CSF A� and
tau measures as the endophenotype variable. Whether
such an approach will nominate the same markers
as that based on NAB will be interesting; CSF mea-
sures of pathology correlate with NAB as one would
expect, but only imperfectly. They measure different
things and identifying blood-based correlates of both
mighthelptoexplorethisdifference.Wehavebeguna
series of studies using a range of protein technologies
using this study design, as shown in Table 4.
In another study, we have also used MS to iden-
tify blood biomarkers associated with CSF tau/A�42
pathology and performed replication studies in inde-
pendent cohorts by immunocapture, confirming some
of these hits (Baird et al, in preparation).
WHY DO MOST BIOMARKERS FAIL
REPLICATION?
In a decade of studies seeking biomarkers in blood,
we have nominated many and replicated some. In
order to explore this further—to test the commonly
heard dismissal of blood biomarker research that
‘nothing replicates’—we have performed perhaps the
first,andcertainlylargestsystematicreplicationstudy
[45]. Briefly, we performed a systematic review and
from 21 published discovery or large panel (>100
proteins) studies identified 163 candidate proteins,
among which approximately 66% were reported
only in only one study. Then we used the SOMAs-
can platform to test 94 of these 163 candidates in
677 subjects (AD, controls, and MCI). The results
showed that a panel of 13 proteins (pancreatic pro-
hormone, C-C motif chemokine 18, �-1-antitrypsin,
complement C6, insulin-like growth factor-binding
protein 2, angiopoietin-2, C-C motif chemokine 15,
cystatin C, tumor necrosis factor receptor super-
family member 1B, �-2-microglobulin, prolactin,
haptoglobin, and metalloproteinase inhibitor 1) could
discriminate AD from controls with a sensitivity of
0.83 and a specificity of 0.66.
While this study refutes the superficial ‘nothing
replicates’ dismissal, it remains the case that in the
field as a whole, most nominated biomarkers fail
replication posing a substantial challenge to devel-
opment [60]. The reason for such failure might be
caused by the heterogeneity of the disease itself as
well as the complexity of blood. Indeed, the pro-
tein levels in blood span ten orders of magnitude,
making the investigation of lower abundant proteins
extremely challenging. In addition to the reasons
mentioned above, a number of other major factors
could also lead to the failure of replication. They
include pre-analytical processes, analysis of different
blood fractions, use of different analytical platforms,
and inappropriate statistical analysis, which will be
discussed below.
Pre-analytical processing
Pre-analytical processing has a substantial impact
on proteomic results although it is frequently dis-
regarded. For example, Plebani and Carraro [61]
analyzed analytical errors in an emergency laboratory
and found that 68.2% of mistakes were caused by pre-
analytical phases, in contrast to 13.3% and 18.5% for
the intra and post-analytical phases, respectively. In
another review, Bonini et al [62] found that more than
68% of the errors occur in the pre- or post-analytical
phase, whereas only 13–32% could be traced back to
the analytical phase.
 1192
L. Shi et al. / A Decade of Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Various pre-analytical factors affect the quality of
the specimens, including blood collection, e.g., nee-
dle used, the site used for blood withdrawal, and type
of collection tube; blood processing, e.g., the time
from blood-draw to storage, centrifugation parame-
ters, and container type; blood storage, e.g., sample
storage temperature and duration; blood transporta-
tion, etc. Since all these factors could influence the
results, at the very least such parameters should be
recorded and available for study and standardization
of methodologies would be desirable. Currently, an
international working group led by O’Bryant has pro-
vided the initial starting point for such guidelines and
standardized operating procedures [63].
Serum versus plasma
Although we refer in this review to ‘blood’, there
are of course many fractions of this tissue (plasma,
serum, cells) that influence the concentration of pro-
teins. Whole blood includes red blood cells, white
blood cells, platelets, and proteins. Serum is the pro-
tein rich fluid in which these cells are suspended,
obtained following centrifugation, and plasma is
serum collected with methods to preserve fibrino-
gen and clotting factors. Other compartments in
blood include the platelets, erythrocytes, the aggre-
gate of white cells referred to as ‘buffy coat’ and the
individual white cell populations separable by flow
cytometry. Each of these cellular and non-cellular
compartments might be the source of biomarkers and
indeed each has been used in biomarker studies in
AD. In a recent study, Huebinger et al. [64] compared
the concentration of 100 proteins in matched samples
of serum and plasma from 39 AD patients, showing
that 40 proteins were high correlated between blood
fractions while the remaining proteins were only
moderately or weakly correlated, including some of
considerable interest in AD.
Sample size versus biomarkers panel
The ratio between sample size and analytes will
also influence the reproducibility of biomarkers.
Overfitting bias occurs when a multi-marker panel
is inappropriately large with respect to the number
of cases evaluated. Generally, when the ratio of sam-
ples to analytes is less than 10, it is considered of
potential bias [65] suggesting that overfitting of data
is a risk in most agnostic proteomic studies. The
failure to replicate blood biomarker studies in AD
are not unique to unbiased proteomic analyses and
considerations of preanalytical processing, matrix
used, sample size, and statistical analyses are equally
relevant to other ‘omics’ data. The recent discovery
of a panel of lipid metabolites that could predict inci-
dent AD with >90% accuracy is especially relevant
in this context [66]. The ultimate failure to replicate
these findings from a small discovery study in large,
independent cohorts [67–69] again highlights these
critical considerations [70]. Ultimately it is replica-
tion that is the acid test of any study but the biomarker
field in AD research today is arguably in the same
phase as genetic studies were a decade or more ago
with analyte size rapidly increasing but with sample
numbers not keeping up. The field of genetics was
transformed by the huge collaborative studies now
typically including tens of thousands of research par-
ticipants.Biomarkerstudieswillbeabandonedbefore
studies get to this size as a biomarker effect size needs
to be of practical utility and hence larger than the
effect size of most genetic susceptibility factors for
common disease, but they do need to be substantially
larger than most studies are today.
Analytical methods
Using different methods will inevitably lead to dif-
ferent results and this may contribute to why proteins
identified by an untargeted approach (e.g., 2D-
GE/MS) fail in replication using a targeted approach
(e.g., ELISA, western blot). Indeed, proteins exist in
many different isoforms, they are metabolized, have
different biophysical states, are complexed with other
proteins, have altered activities, and have a very large
and variable number of post-translational modifica-
tions. Even very similar targeted analytical methods
are not completely comparable. An ELISA, for exam-
ple, is not actually a measure of a protein but of the
binding of a capture antibody to an epitope. Change
the binding agent, or the epitope and a change in the
result is only to be expected.
Statistical analysis
Different complex statistical analysis also might
result in discrepancy across studies. In one of our
studies [71], we compared our statistical analysis
model with the one used by Burnham et al. [72]
and found that the model we used gave somewhat
improved results. Given that there are no abso-
lutes when it comes to choice of complex statistical
approach, the only viable solution is open access to
raw data as well as transparency of analytical process.

MOVING FROM DISCOVERY TO
TRANSLATION AND FROM PROTEIN
TO MULTI-MODAL MARKERS
Although the majority of published biomarkers
have failed to replicate and perform as a reproducible
classifier for AD, we do observe several proteins
consistently associated with clinical AD or with mul-
tiple indicators of AD pathology in our studies (see
Table 5), many of which are also replicated by other
laboratories. Given the relatively small size of the
studies thus far, these results are highly promising
but clearly need to be replicated in larger studies.
The National Biomarker Development Alliance
(NBDA) proposes that following discovery of a
nominated and replicated biomarker, the subsequent
phase of research is ‘translatable discovery’; the
demonstration that the marker is “accurate and
reproducible within the intended context of use—in
other words, it has evidence-based potential for use
in diagnosis, clinical decision making, or as a clinical
tool (e.g., stratifying patients for trial)” and also that
“the assay will ultimately perform in the real world
of varying sample quality” (http://nbdabiomark
ers.org/about/what-we-do/pipeline-overview/transla
table-discovery). The evidence reviewed here we
believe demonstrates that there are biomarkers in
bloodinADthatshouldnowtransitiontothisphaseof
development. With that in mind, we are now embark-
ing on large scale Translatable Discovery studies
using some of the infrastructures for collaboration
established in Europe over the past few years.
The IMI-European Medical Information Frame-
work (http://www.emif.eu) is a large public private
consortium across multiple countries that enables
data visibility and interoperability to facilitate
research. The data sets included are both large,
real-world and population datasets as well as research
cohorts. We have used the infrastructure and col-
laborations established by EMIF to identify more
than 1500 samples for biomarker studies and are
currently analyzing these samples using endophe-
notype design and both targeted and untargeted
proteomics including explicitly ‘Translatable Dis-
covery’ of the biomarkers described in this review.
As the samples come from multiple cohorts with
somewhat varying sample collection protocols, they
match the NBDA requirement for this phase of
development for demonstrable efficacy in real-
world situations. Very similar to EMIF in some
respects, and reutilizing much of the informatics
infrastructure,
is
the
Dementias
Platform
UK
(DPUK; http://www.dementiasplatform.uk/) which
is also now generating both Early Discovery and
Translatable Discovery biomarker programs in suit-
ably large cohort studies.
Of
other
studies,
the
Alzheimer’s
Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (http://www.adni-
info.org/) has in many ways led the field. First,
because this study established many of the protocols
that have become standard in the field, especially in
imaging. Second because it has gathered and ana-
lyzed large numbers of brain scans, genetic profiles,
and biomarkers in blood and CSF that have been
used to develop methods to assess disease progress
and potentially, effects of treatment. Thirdly, and
arguably most importantly, the ADNI study has been
an ‘open science’ program sharing data with the
scientific community from the outset and in doing
so has made substantial contribution not only to
biomarker research but to the increasingly collab-
orative spirit of research in this area. Through a
collaborative agreement with ADNI, the Australian
Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of

Ageing (AIBL) (https://aibl.csiro.au/) launched in
2006, followed by other ADNI-like studies around
the world. AIBL has established a cohort of over
1,100 people with longitudinal assessments (>4.5
years) and seeks to complement ADNI and other
studies, in identifying biomarkers, cognitive charac-
teristics, and health and lifestyle factors that affect
the subsequent development of symptomatic AD.
Initiatives such as EMIF, ADNI, AIBL, and
DPUK, together with similar drives elsewhere such
as the Accelerating Medicines Partnership–AD in
the USA, bode well for the future development of
biomarkers for AD. We have focused in this review
on our own studies over the past decade but there are
many other groups with promising biomarkers devel-
oped using agnostic proteomics and using targeted
approaches focusing, for example, on neurofilament
light and amyloid (see [5–7] for example). How-
ever, advances in biomarker research from these large
collaborative groups are unlikely to be restricted to
protein biomarkers. A series of studies, including
some from our own laboratories [67, 73–78], are
beginning to nominate metabolite or lipidomic mark-
ers from blood and then there are other genomics
including microRNAs and epigenetic changes, tran-
scriptomics, and other markers. Moreover, there are
markers of functional imaging, electrophysiology,
and the uncharted space of near-continuous measures
using the power of connected devices and wearables.
The challenges of data management and analysis of
any one of these approaches will be considerable but
the real value might emerge when combinatorial anal-
ysis becomes possible. Needless to say, the challenge
is not only technical and computational but logistic
and intrinsic—adding immense depth to biomarker
data without adding to breadth in sample size and
without exacting quality standards will likely add
more noise than signal.
Nonetheless, the opportunities are exciting and
the multiplicity of biomarker technologies becoming
available open new avenues for research. One that
we will be focusing on over coming years is begin-
ning the process to identify not only biomarkers for
trial selection but for trial outcome measures; specif-
ically biomarkers to enable proof of concept studies
in preclinical disease. Here, the challenge is if any-
thing, even greater than that of efficacy studies in
prodromal studies. In an efficacy study in prodromal
disease, the outcome measure is a clinical one, neces-
sitating long and expensive trials and hence the need
for selection markers to identify a participant group
suitable for such studies and to reduce the cost of
screen failure. In contrast, in an early phase proof
of concept study, a measure of change is needed
and with the absence of symptoms, this effectively
precludes trials in preclinical disease, the stage of
disease where proof of concept is most likely to be
demonstrable. In the Deep and Frequent Phenotyping
study, we shall be collecting data for Early Discov-
ery of such markers; utilizing a suite of technologies
ranging from structural and functional imaging of
brain and eye, electrophysiology including MEG and
EEG, connected devices to measure gait, movement,
cognition, and moreover sample collection including
blood, CSF, and urine. These will all be measured
in preclinical and prodromal AD and controls at fre-
quent intervals ranging from three to six times over
the course of a year. This enormously challenging,
complicated but exciting study will share both sam-
ples and data with the scientific community as part of
the drive to Open Science and in the belief that it is
only through co-operation and collaboration that we
will make progress.
