ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors 
(PCSK9i) are a novel class of medications for patients with familial 
hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
requiring additional lipid lowering beyond dietary measures and statin 
use. Because of the drugs’ high cost, rates of prescription approval by 
payers may be low. We aimed to identify payer approval and rejection 
rates for PCSK9i prescriptions and the potential factors influencing these 
rates.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, descriptive cohort study using 
nationwide pharmacy claims linked to electronic medical records from a 
nationwide data warehouse. The data set includes >220 million patients 
from all 50 states and all payer types with 5140 distinct health plans. 
PCSK9i prescriptions were submitted for 51 
466 patients in the pharmacy 
data set. The main outcome was approval or rejection of PCSK9i 
prescription claims. Factors associated with approval and rejection of 
these medications in the United States were assessed.
RESULTS: Among patients who were prescribed a PCSK9i, 47.0% were 
approved for coverage by the payer. Variables that were associated 
with PCSK9i approval included age >65 years (P<0.01), history of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (P<0.01), prescription by a 
cardiologist or nonprimary care provider (P<0.01), statin intolerance 
(P=0.03), longer statin duration (P=0.01), and noncommercial payers 
(P<0.01). Higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were not 
associated with higher approval rates. Commercial third-party payers had 
the lowest approval rates (24.4%) and Medicare had the highest (60.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Rates of approval for PCSK9i therapy are low, even for 
patients who appear to meet labeled indications. Although a combination 
of clinical characteristics increases the likelihood of approval, payer type is 
the most significant factor.

P
roprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 
(PCSK9) is a serine protease that facilitates the 
degradation of receptors for low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (LDL-C) within hepatocytes.1 Gain-of-
function PCSK9 alleles are associated with diminished 
clearance of LDL-C and consequently high circulating 
LDL-C and increased cardiovascular risk,2,3 whereas 
loss-of-function PCSK9 alleles are associated with low 
LDL-C and decreased cardiovascular risk.4 Given the 
proven benefit of LDL-C reduction in lowering rates of 
major cardiovascular events,5 PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) 
have been developed as a novel class of medications 
for use in high-risk populations.6,7 Two monoclonal 
antibodies that inactivate PCSK9, alirocumab and evo-
locumab, have been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for use along with diet and maxi-
mally tolerated statin therapy in patients with familial 
hypercholesterolemia (FH) or clinical atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who require additional 
LDL-C lowering.8,9 Alirocumab and evolocumab reduce 
LDL-C levels by up to 60% and may decrease major 
adverse cardiovascular events.10,11
However, alirocumab and evolocumab are sig-
nificantly more expensive than other lipid-lower-
ing therapies with an average cost of $14 300 per 
year.12 These costs pose a significant challenge to 
healthcare payers, especially in light of the uncer-
tain long-term clinical effectiveness of these drugs.13 
Consensus among professional societies on optimal 
LDL-C targets among those with ASCVD and FH is 
still evolving. Current prescriptions of these medica-
tions therefore typically require prior authorization 
by health insurance companies, leading to either ap-
proval or rejection. This process may raise additional 
barriers in the care of patients who would most ben-
efit from additional LDL-C lowering with new thera-
pies. Beyond small analyses and anecdotal reports, 
the rates of approval and rejection for patients, and 
the characteristics of patients who are successfully 
prescribed PCSK9 inhibitors in current clinical prac-
tice, are unknown.
Our primary objective was to use nationwide phar-
macy claims linked to medical claims and electronic 
medical records to identify the rates of payer approval 
and rejection for patients prescribed PCSK9i therapy. 
We also evaluated the demographic and clinical char-
acteristics of patients who were approved or rejected to 
assess healthcare provider and payer practices in rela-
tion to current FDA-approved indications for PCSK9i. 
We further assessed factors associated with successful 
payer approval and rejection for these medications in 
the United States.
METHODS
Study Design and Data Sources
This retrospective, observational, descriptive cohort study used 
healthcare claims and electronic medical records from the 
Symphony Health nationwide data warehouse. This data set 
includes both Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act and Health Information Technology for Economic and 
Clinical Health compliant patient-level data from all 50 states 
and all payer types, including 5140 distinct health plans. The 
data warehouse includes ≈220 million active, unique patients 
with pharmacy claims, 170 million with medical claims, and 
100 million with ambulatory electronic medical records. The 
data are used for a range of research studies by private and 
public agencies including the FDA and the Scientific Registry 
of Transplant Recipients. These data are focused on observing 
patients across healthcare providers and care sites over time, 
include all insurance types (commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, 
other third-party payers), and are patient centric and health 
plan agnostic.
Drug prescriptions were assessed from outpatient phar-
macy claims, which included National Counsel for Prescription 
Drug Plans–formatted records with a complete life cycle of 
transactions from initial submission to a definitive event of 
approval or rejection per patient. Private practitioner claims 
(CMS1500) and hospital/facility claims (UB04) were used to 
identify patients’ demographics, clinical characteristics, and 
diagnoses. LDL-C levels were extracted from electronic medi-
cal records. All patient-level records were linked across settings 
of care and longitudinally via a Health Insurance Portability 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This is the largest study to date of which we are 
aware to examine payer approvals and rejections of 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibi-
tor therapy and patient characteristics associated 
with successful prescribing for patients, including 
approvals, rejections, medication abandonment 
by patients, out-of-pocket amounts, and time to 
approval or rejection.
• The study presents the corresponding patient clini-
cal characteristics including low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol values and stratification by primary and 
secondary prevention based on observed athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• In this large, national study of proprotein conver-
tase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor prescribing, 
less than half of all prescribed patients received 
payer approval, including patients with a history 
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and those 
with markedly elevated low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels.
• Although a combination of clinical characteristics 
moderately influenced approval rates, the most sig-
nificant factor associated with approval was payer 
type.

and Accountability Act–compliant, deidentified unique 
patient identifier. The data were verified as meeting the dei-
dentified standard under the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act privacy rule Expert Determination 
§164.514(b)(1) by Scheuren Ruffner Consultants with a very 
low statistical risk of reidentification, and the certificate is on 
file at Symphony Health. Therefore, the study was not consid-
ered to be human subject research, and institutional review 
board review was not required. The Beth Israel Deaconess 
Medical Center institutional review board agreed with this 
determination.
Study inclusion criteria were patients ≥18 years of age 
with ≥1 submitted claims for a PCSK9i between July 2015 
and August 2016, ≥1 private practitioner or facility medical 
claims between January 2010 and July 2015, and at least 1 
LDL-C test result (≤400 mg/dL) between July 2015 and the 
patient’s index date (Figure 1). Less than 1% of LDL-C values 
were observed at >400 mg/dL and were believed to poten-
tially represent erroneous data. In total, the study cohort 
was represented by 451 individual health plans and pharma-
ceutical benefit management companies, which themselves 
may manage drug formularies and policies for several hun-
dred health plans. A total of 49 US states and the District of 
Columbia were represented by the included health plans and 
benefit management companies (Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Continuous healthcare data capture of the study popu-
lation during the study period was required as a proxy for 
enrollment, with at least 1 recorded prescription before the 
PCSK9i claim and 1 prescription following that claim between 
January 1, 2010, and the end of the study period.
End Points and Covariates
The primary end point was the percentage of patients approved 
or rejected for PCSK9i prescription therapy. Prescribed therapy 
was analyzed by using National Drug Codes. Medical histories 
were assessed for the identification of patient clinical char-
acteristics using the International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and the International Classification 
of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and Current Procedural 
Terminology from private practitioner medical claims and 
from hospital facility claims submitted between January 2010 
and July 2015. In addition, Diagnostic Related Groupings 
from hospital claims were converted and mapped to ICD-9 
and ICD-10 codes. Clinical ASCVD was defined by ≥1 occur-
rences of any of the following: aortic and other aneurysms, 
cerebrovascular disease, coronary atherosclerosis/angina/
old myocardial infarction, endovascular stent graft, ischemic 
stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, tran-
sient ischemic attack, unstable angina, atherosclerosis of the 
arterial bed, status post–coronary artery bypass grafting/per-
cutaneous coronary intervention, status post–carotid endar-
terectomy, and status post–carotid/vertebral/basilar stenting. 
Patients’ diagnoses were then mapped to ≥1 indications for 
a PCSK9i. LDL-C test results were identified using Logical 
Observation Identifiers Names and Codes, and text queries 
were used as an added quality assurance step.
Statistical Analysis
The primary unit of analysis was the patient, each of whom 
had at least 1 PCSK9i claim submitted for approval. For the 
primary analysis of determining the percentage of patients 
approved or rejected for PCSK9i therapy, patients were 
assigned to 2 major, mutually exclusive groups based on 
their PCSK9i pharmacy submission outcome: approved and 
rejected (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). The 
approved cohort was defined as individuals who had at least 
one PCSK9i approved as a valid and compliant prescription 
(eg, included prior authorization) during the study period. For 
those approved, we additionally determined the subset per-
centage of those who actually purchased and took posses-
sion of the medication (approved/possessed), and those who 
abandoned (per processing terminology), ie, were approved 
but did not purchase or pick up the medication (approved/
abandoned). The rejected cohort was defined as individu-
als whose PCSK9i claims had never been approved by the 
payers during the study period, and subsequently the only 
known claim status was rejected. For those with multiple pay-
ers, all payers must have rejected the claim for the patient 
to be labeled as rejected. A sensitivity analysis excluding all 
new patients submitting their first claim within 60 days of 
the end of the study period was conducted to account for 
prescriptions potentially under continuing review and adjudi-
cation. Patient responsibility amounts for approved/possessed 
and approved/abandoned were also recorded. Variability in 
rejection rates was calculated by payer for the highest-volume 
payers.
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics (eg, 
ASCVD status, statin intolerance as defined previously,14 
and prescriber specialty) between patients with approved 
and rejected claims were assessed for significant differences 
using χ2 or t tests as appropriate, using a significance level of 
Figure 1. Selection of the study cohort. 
Study inclusion criteria were patients ≥18 years of age with 
≥1 submitted claims for a PCSK9i between July 2015 and 
August 2016, ≥1 private practitioner or facility medical 
claims between January 2010 and July 2015, and at least 1 
LDL-C test result (≤400 mg/dL) between July 2015 and the 
patient’s index date. LDL-C indicates low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol; and PCSK9i, proprotein convertase subtilisin/
kexin type 9 inhibitor.

α=0.05. Comparisons were also stratified by ASCVD diagno-
sis (primary or secondary prevention). A secondary analysis 
population consisted of patients who met all criteria, with the 
exception of the requirement for at least 1 test for LDL-C. 
Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression was performed 
to identify patient characteristics and clinical criteria indepen-
dently associated with final approval or rejection of PCSK9i 
therapy, with health plan or benefit management companies 
modeled as a random effect. The model included age, sex, 
physician specialty, history of ASCVD, LDL-C level, ezetimibe 
and statin use, payer type, and an interaction term between 
LDL level and statin use, as well.
RESULTS
Within the final study population of 9357 patients, 
39.6% had no ASCVD diagnosis (primary preventa-
tive measures), and 60.4% had an ASCVD diagnosis 
(secondary preventative measures). Demographic and 
clinical history for all patients and for patients strati-
fied by ASCVD diagnosis are shown in Table 1. In the 
total study population, 4397 (47.0%) were approved 
for PCSK9i therapy and 4960 (53.0%) were rejected 
(Table 2). The results of a sensitivity analysis exclud-
ing patients who submitted their first claim within 60 
days of the end of the study period showed similar re-
sults (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Of 
those approved, 2844 (64.7%) took possession of the 
medication (approved/possessed) and 1553 (35.3%) 
did not purchase or receive the medication (approved/
abandoned). For the highest volume of payers compris-
ing ≈80% of the patients, rejection rates ranged from 
2.4% to 92.7% (Figure II in the online-only Data Sup-
plement). On average, the time from first submission to 
approval was 29 days, whereas time to rejection was 24 
days. For the 451 health plans and pharmaceutical ben-
efit management companies observed, the mean pa-
tient responsibility was $202.87±12.92 for approved/
possessed patients in comparison with $478.83±27.32 
for approved/abandoned patients.
Table 2 shows the demographics and clinical history 
for all patients either approved or rejected for PCSK9i 
therapy. Approved patients were more often older than 
65 years of age, more often had a history of ASCVD, 
and more often were given a prescription by their car-
diologist. Commercial payers and Medicaid had the 
lowest approval rates (24.4% and 31.2%, respectively), 
and Medicare had the highest (60.9%, P<0.01). As 
anticipated, nearly all patients (98.4%) who paid cash 
were approved. Approval rates were no different based 
on use of maximal statin therapy or use of statin/ezeti-
mibe combination therapy.
The distribution of patients with approvals and re-
jections for PSCK9i therapy by LDL-C value proximal to 
the final disposition is shown in Figure 2 for patients 
with an ASCVD diagnosis (Figure 2A) or no ASCVD

diagnosis (Figure 2B). No clear relationship was ob-
served between LDL-C and approval, with more than 
half of claims being rejected at every level of LDL-C. 
Even in cases (n=32) in which LDL-C levels were ≥330 
mg/dL, 59.4% of patients were not approved for PC-
SK9i therapy.
After multivariable adjustment, the strongest fac-
tor associated with PCSK9i approval was payer type, 
with noncommercial (odds ratio [OR], 12.32; 95%

(OR, 245.34; 95% CI, 63.16–952.97), and Medi-
care (OR, 5.37; 95% CI, 4.23–6.80) all having a 
higher likelihood of approval than commercial insur-
ance (P<0.01). The approval rate for Medicaid was

prior ASVCD (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10–1.36; P<0.01),

longer statin duration (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01–1.42

approval (Figure 3). Statin intolerance was associated 
with lower likelihood of claim approval. The adjusted 
model also showed that the most recent LDL-C value 
was not associated with any difference in approval, 
and this was true independent of whether or not pa-
tients were on high-intensity statins.
DISCUSSION
During the study period of July 2015 through August 
2016, representing the first 12 months after FDA ap-
proval of the PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab and evo-
locumab commercial availability, less than half (47.0%) 
of patients who were prescribed PCSK9i therapy were 
approved by healthcare payers. Our analysis included 
both approvals and rejections in conjunction with pa-
tients’ medical and clinical characteristics, and included 
data from 49 states across all payer types. Rates of re-
jection were high for all clinical groups studied includ-
ing those with ASCVD, with high LDL-C, and on statin 
therapy. Coverage by a noncommercial payer was the 
factor most strongly associated with approval, with 
61.8% of these patients being approved, and only 
24.4% of patients covered by commercial payers being

approved. Older age, presence of ASCVD, and prescrip-
tion by a cardiologist or nonprimary care provider were 
also associated with higher rates of PCSK9i therapy ap-
proval.
Published clinical trial data have demonstrated that 
alirocumab and evolocumab significantly reduce LDL-C 
levels.10,11 Meta-analyses suggest that treatment with 
PCSK9 inhibitors may be associated with a reduced 
risk of death from all causes and a reduction in car-
diovascular deaths.15 The recently published results of 
the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Re-
search with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated 
Risk) showed that cholesterol lowering with PCSK9i on 
a background of statin therapy led to reductions in ma-
jor cardiovascular events.16 However, at current prices, 
the cost-effectiveness of these drugs has been called 
into question.17 It remains to be seen how the results 
of recent and ongoing clinical outcomes trials may af-
fect future payer approvals. As scientific and outcomes 
data accumulate, approval processes and criteria be-
come clearer, and other market forces potentially re-
duce direct and indirect costs, payer approval of PCSK9i 
therapy may increase.
Current rates of PCSK9i therapy rejection are high. 
Given that 40% of patients prescribed these medica-
tions do not have ASCVD and over half are not currently 
on statin therapy, the high rates of rejection could be 
driven in part by prescriptions for patients who may not 
meet currently accepted indications. However, rates of 
rejection were high even for groups with very high LDL-
C values who might be expected to benefit from PC-
SK9i. In stratifying the study population for those with 
a history of ASCVD events (secondary prevention), a key 
labeled indication, there was only a 3% increase in ap-
proval in comparison with the total study population. 
In the same group of ASCVD patients, almost 50% of 
patients had an LDL-C test result ≥130 mg/dL proximal 
to their rejection. Because of the limitations of ICD-9 
Figure 3. Forest plot of multivariable logistic regression analysis of factors associated with PCSK9i approval.  
The strongest factor associated with PCSK9i approval was payer type, with noncommercial, cash payment, and Medicare all 
having higher likelihood of approval in comparison with commercial insurance. Age >65 years, prior ASVCD, prescription by 
a cardiologist or nonprimary care provider, and longer statin duration were associated with approval. Statin intolerance was 
associated with lower likelihood of claim approval, and the most recent LDL-C value was not associated with any difference in 
approval. ASCVD indicates atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; FM, family medicine; IM, internal medicine; LDL, low-density

ARTICLE
and ICD-10 diagnosis data, we were unable to accu-
rately identify patients with FH. We found that statin in-
tolerance was associated with a lower approval rate for 
PCSK9i. Because more than half of individual patients 
reporting statin intolerance can be successfully rechal-
lenged with statins before considering PCSK9i, we sus-
pect that payers may require recent rechallenge before 
approving such prescriptions, resulting in lower approval 
rates than prescriptions based on other indications.
Although certain patient clinical variables including 
age >65 years, cardiology and specialty prescribing, 
statin intolerance, longer duration of statin use, and 
LDL-C >130 on statin+ezetimibe had statistically signifi-
cant associations with approval, payer type was much 
more strongly associated with approval. Commercial 
third-party payers had the lowest approval rates. Medi-
care was the dominant payer type for the total study 
population (52.5%) and had a much higher rate of ap-
proval (60.9%) than commercial payers, and Medicaid 
(31.2%), as well. These findings are consistent with 
prior investigations suggesting high rates of coverage 
for drugs and biologics for FDA-approved indications.18 
Future investigations into whether other health plan 
characteristics or geographic factors were associated 
with different rates of approval could add insight into 
understanding the variation observed between plans.
These findings suggest that, although practitioners 
are prescribing PCSK9i therapy based on FDA approval 
and available efficacy data to date, healthcare payers 
are rejecting approval for the therapy perhaps over con-
cerns of high costs and other considerations. When we 
examine the adoption in US health care of other novel, 
highly effective, costly therapies, similar patterns of low 
approval are often seen. As a recent example in a dif-
ferent therapeutic area, ledipasvir-sofosbuvir therapy 
for patients with hepatitis C was more effective than 
other treatment regimens with sustained virological re-
sponses of ≥95%,19 but was more costly.20
In patients who were approved, but ultimately aban-
doned the therapy, ie, did not take possession of the 
approved medication, payment responsibility was likely 
a factor. The mean patient responsibility for patients 
who ultimately abandoned the therapy was more than 
twice that of patients who took possession of the medi-
cation. Other factors such as the injectable formulation 
may also have contributed to this patient cohort (≈35% 
of approved patients).
Although a complete and systematic analysis of 
specific reasons for rejection are beyond the scope of 
the current article, the high rejection rates observed 
indicate a major administrative burden to physicians 
prescribing these medications for their patients. Prior 
authorization forms consisting of multiple pages are 
typically required for approval by the majority of health 
plans. With <10 
000 health plans in the United States, 
there is great variability in payer-required prior authori-
zation forms with many cases of differing requirements 
and definition of terms. The increasing rates of approval 
over time may in part be a reflection of prescribers mov-
ing up the learning curve for satisfactory completion 
of the forms. The forms require substantial time and 
create a direct cost for healthcare providers, and an in-
direct cost for patients repeatedly attempting to receive 
the prescribed medication, as well. Studies on adminis-
trative costs consistently report that 20% to 30% of US 
healthcare expenditures are spent on administration, 
including claims submissions and providers’ time and 
efforts to be reimbursed.21
From the pharmacist perspective, each attempt 
for payer approval of a PCSK9i is typically made up of 
many transmissions and ≥1 submissions, also known as 
claims. Transmissions are a series of electronic entries 
and queries between a pharmacy and the payer. A vari-
ety of transmissions are often required by pharmacists to 
achieve medication approval by adjusting script prescrip-
tion parameters on a specific date including the quantity 
of medication to be dispensed, the primary payer, etc. 
For each patient prescribed a PCSK9i during the study 
period, an average of 4 distinct claims submissions were 
observed with 6 associated electronic transmissions from 
pharmacies. Analyzing the cost of multiple submissions, 
transmissions, prior authorizations, and related activities 
in a future study will help to better understand the nega-
tive direct and indirect economic impact to our society.
There are limitations inherent to retrospective analy-
ses, which can only provide associations and not cau-
sality, and the use of claims data, which are collected 
primarily for reimbursement purposes rather than re-
search. First, although the current indication for pri-
mary preventive PCSK9i therapy is restricted to FH, we 
were unable to assess diagnostic accuracy given the ab-
sence of clinical genetic testing or available clinical his-
tory such as family history. Furthermore, more specific 
ICD-10 codes for FH were not yet operational during 
the study period. Second, based on the necessity of a 
cutoff date to define the end of the study period, it is 
also possible that some rejected patients would eventu-
ally be approved in the future. Our analyses may there-
fore overreport rejected patients to some degree. In 
addition, our analysis may underreport statin duration 
for some patients, because patients with mail orders or 
who are otherwise not represented in the database may 
be missed. In addition, because our data sets do not 
include enrollment information for patients, we used 
the presence of claims as proxies for continuous enroll-
ment, which may further underestimate statin duration 
for some patients. Our exclusion of LDL-C test results 
>400 mg/dL may omit some patients with homozygous 
FH, but this is rare and would represent a small fraction 
of our study population, and it would have little impact 
on the overall findings of the study. Finally, we were un-
able to determine how many cash-paying patients were

uninsured versus paying cash as a deductible or copay, 
but we were able to compare the patient responsibility 
amounts between the approved and rejected cohorts.
Conclusions
In this large, national study of PCSK9i prescribing, less 
than half of all prescribed patients received payer ap-
proval. These results were observed among patients 
with a history of ASCVD and among those with mark-
edly elevated LDL-C levels, as well. Although a combi-
nation of clinical characteristics moderately influenced 
approval rates, the most significant factor associated 
with approval was payer type.
