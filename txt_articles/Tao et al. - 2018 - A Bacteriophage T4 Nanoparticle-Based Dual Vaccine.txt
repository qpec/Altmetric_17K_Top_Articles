ABSTRACT
Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis, the causative agents of anthrax
and plague, respectively, are two of the deadliest pathogenic bacteria that have
been used as biological warfare agents. Although Biothrax is a licensed vaccine
against anthrax, no Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine exists for
plague. Here, we report the development of a dual anthrax-plague nanoparticle vac-
cine employing bacteriophage (phage) T4 as a platform. Using an in vitro assembly
system, the 120- by 86-nm heads (capsids) of phage T4 were arrayed with anthrax
and plague antigens fused to the small outer capsid protein Soc (9 kDa). The anti-
gens included the anthrax protective antigen (PA) (83 kDa) and the mutated (mut)
capsular antigen F1 and the low-calcium-response V antigen of the type 3 secretion
system from Y. pestis (F1mutV) (56 kDa). These viral nanoparticles elicited robust
anthrax- and plague-specific immune responses and provided complete protection
against inhalational anthrax and/or pneumonic plague in three animal challenge
models, namely, mice, rats, and rabbits. Protection was demonstrated even when
the animals were simultaneously challenged with lethal doses of both anthrax lethal
toxin and Y. pestis CO92 bacteria. Unlike the traditional subunit vaccines, the phage
T4 vaccine uses a highly stable nanoparticle scaffold, provides multivalency, requires
no adjuvant, and elicits broad T-helper 1 and 2 immune responses that are essential
for complete clearance of bacteria during infection. Therefore, phage T4 is a unique
nanoparticle platform to formulate multivalent vaccines against high-risk pathogens
for national preparedness against potential bioterror attacks and emerging infec-
tions.
IMPORTANCE Following the deadly anthrax attacks of 2001, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) determined that Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis
that cause anthrax and plague, respectively, are two Tier 1 select agents that pose
the greatest threat to the national security of the United States. Both cause rapid
death, in 3 to 6 days, of exposed individuals. We engineered a virus nanoparticle
vaccine using bacteriophage T4 by incorporating key antigens of both B. anthracis
and Y. pestis into one formulation. Two doses of this vaccine provided complete pro-
tection against both inhalational anthrax and pneumonic plague in animal models.
This dual anthrax-plague vaccine is a strong candidate for stockpiling against a po-
tential bioterror attack involving either one or both of these biothreat agents. Fur-
ther, our results establish the T4 nanoparticle as a novel platform to develop multi-
valent vaccines against pathogens of high public health significance.

accines are one of the most successful medical interventions of the past millen-
nium (1). Millions of lives have been saved by mass administration of vaccines
against deadly pathogens such as smallpox and flu. However, effective vaccines are still
lacking for many pathogens, including biothreat agents such as the Gram-positive
bacterium Bacillus anthracis that causes anthrax and the Gram-negative bacterium
Yersinia pestis that causes plague. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), these two organisms are two of the Tier 1 select agents that pose the
greatest threat to national security (2). Both are highly virulent resulting in mortality (as
high as 100%) of the subjects within 3 to 6 days of infection. The organisms can be
weaponized and transmitted through inhalation of aerosolized droplets and can be
disseminated relatively easily for the purposes of biological warfare or bioterrorism (3,
4). Designing a vaccine that can protect the public against these threats is therefore a
national priority. Additionally, plague is a significant threat to global health. It causes
periodic outbreaks around the world. The latest example is the 2017 Madagascar
outbreak that resulted in 209 deaths (�70% of the cases were pneumonic plague) (5).
Vaccine development historically relied on the whole pathogen containing either
the inactivated (heat- or formalin-killed) organisms or live attenuated (less virulent
mutant) organisms (1). Several such vaccines have been developed against anthrax and
plague in the past. The Biothrax anthrax vaccine (AVA [anthrax vaccine alum-adsorbed])
is derived from the culture filtrate of the attenuated B. anthracis strain V770-NP1-R (6,
7). This strain secretes the anthrax protective antigen (PA), a primary target for anthrax
vaccine design, into the culture medium, but also traces of the other two components
of the tripartite anthrax toxin, the lethal factor (LF) and the edema factor (EF) (6–8). This
vaccine does have untoward side effects, and therefore, new anthrax vaccines are
highly sought. Similarly, plague vaccines were developed using the formalin-killed or
live attenuated Yersinia pestis bacteria (9–11). However, these whole-pathogen vaccines
produce severe side effects such as reactogenicity at the injection site. Hence, these
vaccines have either been discontinued or used only in a limited way to protect at-risk
military and laboratory personnel (6, 10–12).
Subunit vaccines containing only the target antigen(s) of a pathogen are safer
alternatives to whole-pathogen vaccines (13, 14). Numerous recombinant vaccines
against anthrax or plague have been under investigation, but none have yet been
licensed (6, 15–18). The recombinant anthrax vaccines are composed primarily of PA (6,
18), whereas the plague vaccines contain two surface antigens of Y. pestis, the capsular
protein Caf1 (or F1) (15.6 kDa) and the low-calcium-response V antigen LcrV (or V)
(37.2 kDa) (15–17). A bivalent vaccine consisting of all three antigens fused into a single
polyprotein has also been developed (19). However, the subunit vaccines generally are
unstable, may not generate sufficient immune responses for complete protection, and
require the addition of nonspecific “adjuvants” such as aluminum hydroxide or lipo-
somes to enhance immunogenicity and protective efficacy (13, 20–22).
One of the reasons for poor immunogenicity of subunit vaccines is the lack of the
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) observed in whole-pathogen vac-
cines, which are recognized by the host immune system and trigger innate as well as
adaptive immune responses (22, 23). One way to overcome this limitation is to
incorporate the target antigen as part of a virus nanoparticle structure (24–27). Phages,
such as T4, lambda, and M13, have been used as viral nanoparticle platforms to display
antigens (28–30). The antigen molecules so arrayed on the nanoparticle surface would
mimic the PAMPs of a pathogenic virus, potentially leading to stimulation of strong
immune responses (24, 25).
Here, we report the development of a dual viral nanoparticle vaccine against both
anthrax and plague using bacteriophage (phage) T4 (Fig. 1). The 120- by 86-nm-size
phage T4 head (capsid) is decorated with anthrax PA (83 kDa) and plague F1mutV

 (56 kDa) fused to the small outer capsid protein (Soc) (9 kDa). F1mutV is a fusion protein
of a mutant F1 antigen and V antigen. The mutant F1 produces a soluble monomeric
protein, as opposed to the native F1 which polymerizes into heterogeneous aggre-
gates, yet it retains the full immunogenicity of the native protein (17). Since Soc
assembles on phage T4 capsid as a trimer at the quasi-three-fold axes (Fig. 1A) (31, 32),
the PA and F1mutV antigens attached to Soc might be recognized by the host immune
system as repeating structures arranged symmetrically on the nanoparticle (Fig. 1B),
similar to PAMPs. Indeed, our studies demonstrated that such nanoparticles generated
robust antigen-specific immune responses and provided complete protection against
both anthrax and plague in three different animal models, namely, mice, rats, and
rabbits. Furthermore, the T4 nanoparticle vaccine, unlike the traditional subunit vac-
cines, do not require any adjuvant and generated balanced TH1- and TH2-based
antibody responses, which are highly desirable for any vaccine but particularly relevant
for clearance of pathogenic plague bacteria (10, 33). Finally, the T4 nanoparticle vaccine
provided complete protection against simultaneous challenge by both anthrax lethal
toxin (LeTx) and Y. pestis CO92. These results suggest that the phage T4 vaccine might
be a good candidate for stockpiling against a potential bioterror attack involving either
one or both of these biothreat agents. Further, our results establish the T4 nanoparticle
as a novel platform to develop multivalent biodefense vaccines containing additional
biothreat antigens, as well as for engineering vaccines against other emerging patho-
gens of high public health significance.
RESULTS
Preparation of T4 nanoparticles decorated with anthrax and plague antigens.
To develop a phage T4 vaccine against both B. anthracis and Y. pestis, we constructed
three recombinants by fusing the anthrax and plague antigens to phage RB69 Soc. The
three recombinants were F1mutV-Soc-PA (148 kDa), F1mutV-Soc (66 kDa), and Soc-PA
(93 kDa). Our previous studies have shown that both the N and C termini of RB69 Soc
are exposed on the capsid surface, and both can be used to display recombinant
proteins efficiently (34, 35). Phage RB69 is closely related to T4, and its Soc protein binds
to phage T4 capsid as well as the T4 Soc protein does (34). As reported previously (34),
the binding affinity, copy number per capsid, and capsid stabilization by Soc binding
are nearly the same for RB69 Soc as those of T4 Soc. However, we observed that
proteins fused to RB69 Soc showed greater solubility than the proteins fused to T4 Soc
(17). Since such solubility is a significant factor in vaccine manufacture, we used RB69
Soc instead of T4 Soc for antigen display. The choice of the plague antigen F1mutV and
the anthrax antigen PA was based on our previous studies in which these antigens
stimulated protective immune responses in animal models (17, 19, 36–38). The His-
tagged recombinant proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by
immobilized nickel affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatogra-
phy (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The purified proteins were then

 assembled on T4 nanoparticles in three different display formats: (i) display of F1mutV-
Soc-PA, (ii) display of F1mutV-Soc and Soc-PA on the same capsid, and (iii) a 1:1 mixture
of T4 phage particles separately displayed with F1mutV-Soc or Soc-PA. Of these display
formats, the latter produced particles with the highest copy number of antigens per
capsid, whereas F1mutV-Soc-PA produced the lowest copy number. Hence, this for-
mulation, a mixture of T4 nanoparticles displaying either F1mutV-Soc or Soc-PA (ab-
breviated as T4-F1mutV/PA) was selected for immunological studies.
To optimize the copy number for immunization experiments, 2 � 1010 particles of
purified Soc� (and Hoc�) phage were incubated with F1mutV-Soc or Soc-PA proteins
at different ratios of antigen molecules to Soc binding sites (Fig. 1B and 2). Binding
increased with increasing ratio, reaching saturation at �20:1 (Fig. 2). The copy numbers
of antigens displayed per capsid (Bmax) were 650 for the 66-kDa F1mutV-Soc and 361
for the 93-kDa Soc-PA, and the binding concentrations at which half of the capsid
binding sites were occupied (BC50s) were 348 nM and 1,140 nM, respectively (Fig. 2; see
Materials and Methods for details on the determination of Bmax and BC50). Since there
are 870 Soc binding sites per capsid, the percent occupancy values were 75 for
F1mutV-Soc and 41 for Soc-PA. These values represent high occupancies, considering
that both the 83-kDa PA and the 56-kDa F1mutV would encounter steric constraints to
access all the Soc binding sites on the capsid surface, the former more so than the
latter, as reflected in the data.
The T4 nanoparticles decorated with anthrax and plague antigens provide
near-complete protection to mice against anthrax lethal toxin and pneumonic
plague challenges with Y. pestis CO92. BALB/c mice (10 mice per group) were
immunized by the intramuscular (i.m.) route with 25 �g of each of the T4 nanoparticle
preparations containing F1mutV-Soc and Soc-PA and boosted on day 21 (Fig. 3A). Mice

parameters are shown. BC50, half-maximal binding concentration (in nanomolar); Bmax, maximum copy number per phage

 immunized with the T4 phage lacking the antigens served as a control group. A series
of experiments were performed to determine the immunogenicity and protective
efficacy of the T4-delivered antigens. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
showed high levels of both F1V-specific and PA-specific IgG antibodies, up to endpoint
titers of �3 � 106 (Fig. 3B). Anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) neutralization assays demon-
strated that the T4-PA immunized animals also elicited robust LeTx neutralization titers
(the dilution of serum inducing 50% neutralization [EC50] of 4,052 � 281) (Fig. 3C). The
control animals were negative for both types of antibodies (Fig. 3B and C).
The protective efficacy of T4-delivered F1mutV/PA was evaluated by two dual-
challenge models that we have recently developed: (i) sequential challenge (Fig. 3D) in
which the animals were first exposed to one threat agent and the survivors were then
exposed to the second threat agent, and (ii) simultaneous challenge (Fig. 3E) in which
the animals were exposed to both threat agents at the same time. For sequential
challenge, mice (10 mice per group) immunized as described above (Fig. 3A) were
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with one 100% lethal dose (LD100) of LeTx (1:1 mixture
of PA and LF [100 �g each]) on day 42. The immunized group was 80% protected
against LeTx challenge, whereas 100% of the negative-control mice died within 2 days
of challenge (Fig. 3D). Thirty-three days later, the surviving animals were challenged
with 400 50% lethal doses (LD50) of Y. pestis CO92 by intranasal (i.n.) administration to
develop pneumonic plague. The naive mice were used as negative controls. The
T4-F1mutV/PA group showed 100% protection (no death), whereas the naive animals
showed 100% death within 4 days after Y. pestis CO92 challenge (Fig. 3D).
For simultaneous dual challenge, mice (n � 8) immunized by the same scheme
(Fig. 3A) were challenged with both LeTx (1 LD100, i.p. administration) and Y. pestis CO92
(200 LD50, i.n. administration) 23 days after the boost (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3E, all
the control mice died within 2 days of challenge, whereas the T4-delivered F1mutV/PA
provided 88% protection (one death out of eight mice). Furthermore, the survivors
showed clearing of Y. pestis bacteria by 3 days postchallenge (Fig. 3F). The Y. pestis
CO92 strain used in the challenge experiment contained a luciferase (lux) expression
cassette for imaging the bacteria in vivo in real time (39). The immunized animals were

 negative for bioluminescence, whereas the control mice showed bacterial dissemina-
tion throughout the body (Fig. 3F); these data were confirmed by colony count
determination at the termination of the experiment or as the animals succumbed to
infection (data not shown).
The T4 nanoparticles provide complete protection to rats against both anthrax
and plague. The rat is a natural host for Y. pestis infection, which occurs through rat
fleas. Therefore, rats are one of the most reliable models to assess the protective
efficacy of vaccines against plague (40). Likewise, rats are exquisitely sensitive to LeTx
(19). To evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the T4 bivalent vaccine
using this model, Brown Norway rats (n � 9) were immunized using the scheme shown
in Fig. 4A. The T4-delivered immunogens induced high levels of antigen-specific IgG
titers in rats, up to �1.25 � 105 and �6.25 � 105 of F1mutV-specific and PA-specific
IgG, respectively (Fig. 4B). The T4-F1mutV/PA group consistently also generated high
levels of LeTx neutralizing antibodies (EC50 of 4,285 � 409) (Fig. 4C). The control
animals, as expected, were negative for the antigen-specific total IgG and LeTx neu-
tralizing antibodies (Fig. 4B and C).
The protective efficacy of the T4 bivalent vaccine in rats was also tested by our
dual-challenge models (Fig. 4D and E). For sequential challenge, the animals (n � 9)
were first subjected to i.n. challenge with 400 LD50 of Y. pestis CO92. The T4 bivalent
vaccine showed 100% protection, whereas all the rats in the control group died within
2 days postchallenge (Fig. 4D). The surviving rats were then challenged with 1 LD100 of
LeTx (7.5 �g each of PA and LF) by intravenous (i.v.) injection on day 70 after Y. pestis
CO92 challenge. All the rats immunized with T4 dual anthrax-plague vaccines survived
(Fig. 4D), but rats in the control group (negative control) died within 2 h of the LeTx
challenge. This is consistent with previous studies in that rats are highly sensitive to i.v.
administration of LeTx, a challenge regime that results in rapid death (19). In a separate
experiment, the protective efficacy of the T4 vaccine was further evaluated by the
simultaneous dual-challenge model where the rats (n � 6) were immunized as de-
FIG 4 (A) Immunization scheme for rat study. Rats were immunized (i.m.) on days 0 and 21. Sera were collected

Y. pestis CO92 (i.n.) on day 42, followed by i.v. injection of 1 LD100 LeTx (i.v.) on day 111. In a simultaneous challenge
model, rats (in a separate experiment [n � 6]) were immunized as shown in panel A and challenged with 1 LD100

 scribed above and challenged with both LeTx (1 LD100, i.v.) and Y. pestis CO92 (400 LD50,
i.n.) at the same time (Fig. 4E). The T4 dual vaccines once again showed 100%
protection, whereas the control animals succumbed to either the LeTx challenge or to
Y. pestis infection (Fig. 4E).
The T4 nanoparticle vaccine induces high levels of both TH1- and TH2-
dependent antibody responses. Stimulation of both arms of the immune system,
humoral (TH2) and cellular (TH1), is essential for protection against Y. pestis infection
(10), and probably beneficial for protection against B. anthracis infection (41). With this
in mind, we determined the IgG subclass of the induced antibodies (Fig. 5). In mice, the
IgG2a titer represents the TH1 response, whereas the IgG1 titer reflects the TH2
response. Our data showed that the T4-displayed F1mutV/PA group elicited high levels
of both IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies against F1mutV or PA, whereas the control animals
were negative for both types of antibodies (Fig. 5A and B). The IgG subclass specificity
of the antibodies induced in rats exhibited trends similar to those in mice (Fig. 5C and
D). The T4 nanoparticle-displayed F1mutV/PA induced high levels of both IgG1 and
IgG2a antibodies against both F1mutV and PA immunogens (Fig. 5C and D). However,
a bias toward TH1 was even stronger in the case of anti-PA than in the case of
anti-F1mutV (Fig. 5C and D). These results, which were consistently observed in two
animal models, showed that the T4 nanoparticle-delivered antigens stimulated strong
antibody responses derived from both the TH1 cellular system and the TH2 humoral
system (17, 42). In contrast, we and others have previously noted that soluble antigens
(with Alhydrogel as an adjuvant) showed a clear bias toward the TH2 responses (17, 43).
This is also consistent with the clearance of pathogenic Y. pestis lux bacteria in the
challenge experiments described above. However, more studies are needed to directly
examine the TH1 and TH2 responses and to further explore the mechanisms of T4
nanoparticle vaccine-induced protection.
The T4 nanoparticles confer complete protection to rabbits against inhala-
tional anthrax. The T4 dual anthrax-plague vaccine was further evaluated in a New
Zealand White (NZW) rabbit model that is considered to be the best model for
inhalation anthrax. The pathology of rabbits challenged with aerosolized Ames spores
shows remarkable similarity to that in humans infected with encapsulated toxigenic B.
anthracis spores (44, 45). NZW rabbits (10 rabbits per group) were primed on day 0 and
boosted on day 14 by the i.m. injection of the T4 bivalent anthrax-plague vaccine
formation (Fig. 6A). Sera were collected on the schedule shown in Fig. 6A and subjected
to immunological analyses. The data showed that the T4 nanoparticle vaccines induced
FIG 5 Mouse antigen-specific IgG1 (A) and IgG2a (B) antibody titers and rat antigen-specific IgG1 (C) and
IgG2a (D) antibody titers. Animals were immunized (i.m.) according to Fig. 3A and 4A. Sera were collected
and analyzed by ELISA. Values that are significantly different by Student’

 high levels of anti-PA IgG antibodies as well as LeTx neutralizing antibodies on day 20
(Fig. 6B and C). The rabbits also induced high levels of anti-F1mutV antibodies, up to
an endpoint titer of 1.6 � 106 (Fig. 6D). The control group showed no antibodies to
either PA or F1mutV (Fig. 6B to D).
Rabbits were challenged 2 weeks after the boost with 200 LD50 of aerosolized B.
anthracis Ames spores. All the naive control rabbits succumbed to the anthrax disease
2 to 4 days postinfection, while the T4 dual-vaccine-immunized rabbits were 100%
protected (Fig. 6E). Blood samples for bacteremia were drawn before the challenge on
day 27 and on days 29 to 33 (2 to 6 days postexposure) and 42 (15 days postexposure).
Bacteremia was not detected in vaccinated animals, whereas all unvaccinated animals
became positive for bacteremia before they succumbed to the disease. To determine
the bacterial loads of internal organs, postmortem collection of specimens was per-
formed after scheduled euthanasia of surviving animals on study day 42 (T4-F1mutV/PA
group) or after animals died due to the anthrax exposure (control group). All vaccinated
animals had cleared the agent from the lungs and did not have any bacteria in the
brain, liver, or spleen. In contrast, tissue samples collected from control animals were
positive for B. anthracis (except for one rabbit whose liver was negative), indicating
systemic anthrax infection.
DISCUSSION
The deadly anthrax attacks of 2001 using weaponized spores of B. anthracis illus-
trated the enormous dangers posed by biothreat agents in creating chaos and terror
among the public (3, 4). Stockpiling of a biodefense vaccine that can protect people
against multiple biothreat agents would provide an effective countermeasure to mit-
igate such future attacks. Despite intense efforts for nearly 2 decades, no such vaccine
is on the horizon for licensure. We describe here a nanoparticle vaccine delivery
platform using phage T4 that can be engineered to create multivalent biodefense
vaccines against different pathogens. As a proof of principle, a dual anthrax-plague
vaccine is formulated by incorporating three different antigens from two Tier 1 select
agents into phage T4 nanoparticles; protective antigen from B. anthracis and the
capsular protein F1 and the low-calcium-response V antigen from Y. pestis.

 The anthrax and plague antigens were assembled in vitro on the capsid of phage T4
through fusion to the phage outer capsid protein Soc. High-affinity interactions be-
tween Soc and the capsid fixed the antigens at symmetric positions of the capsid
lattice. Recent studies showed that repeat structures of the viral capsid could be
recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) as a PAMP and could lead to the induction of
an innate immune response (46). Therefore, a simple mixture of anthrax and plague
antigen particles, with the displayed antigens resembling the repeat structures or
molecular patterns seen on a natural viral pathogen, might then be presented to the
host immune system.
Strikingly, the T4 nanoparticle vaccine elicited high titers of antigen-specific anti-
bodies against both anthrax and plague antigens. Neither antigenic interference nor
enhancement of antibody responses was evident. Furthermore, the dual vaccine was
highly efficacious in protecting animals against lethal challenges with anthrax and/or
plague agent. This was observed in three different animal models: BALB/c mice, Brown
Norway rats, and New Zealand White rabbits. Indeed, complete protection of vacci-
nated animals was observed even when the animals were simultaneously challenged
with LeTx and the highly virulent Y. pestis CO92 bacteria in the rat model or in an
inhalational anthrax model where the rabbits were challenged with the aerosolized
Ames spores of B. anthracis. These models represent two of the best models available
to assess the efficacy of plague and anthrax vaccines, respectively.
It is significant that the dual anthrax-plague vaccine, unlike the traditional subunit
vaccines, elicited robust immune responses against both antigens in the absence of an
adjuvant. In fact, addition of adjuvants such as Alhydrogel and/or liposomes to the
nanoparticles did not enhance the immune responses (data not shown). We speculate
that this might be because the viral nanoparticles, mimicking the PAMPs of a natural
pathogen, engage with the TLRs and robustly stimulate the innate and adaptive
immune systems of the host and do not need an external adjuvant (46). Consistent with
this hypothesis, the T4 dual vaccine elicited both TH1- and TH2-mediated antibody
responses against both antigens. This seems to be a signature characteristic of the
phage T4 nanoparticle platform, one that is highly desirable for clearance of pathogenic
organisms during natural infection. However, further studies are needed to understand
the mechanisms.
In conclusion, our studies highlight some unique properties of the T4 phage
nanoparticle that are distinct from the traditional subunit vaccines, which could facil-
itate formulation of multivalent vaccines against high-risk pathogens. Potentially, ad-
ditional antigens from other biothreat agents and/or from emerging pathogens could
be incorporated using the same principle, and these formulations can be customized to
address different threats in different geographical regions of the world. Additional
advantages of phage T4 platform include the following: highly stable structure, scal-
ability, cost-effectiveness, safety, and lack of preexisting immunity in humans. Together,
these factors could accelerate the streamlining of clinical trials, manufacture, and
deployment at a much reduced cost, time, and effort. Phage T4, thus, is a good
candidate to develop as a “universal”platform for creating and stockpiling multivalent
vaccines as part of our national preparedness against potential future biothreats and
emerging infections. With some more refinement, this platform may have the most
desirable target product profile for licensure.

 Plasmids, bacterial, and phage T4. The E. coli expression vector pET28b (EMD Biosciences,
Darmstadt, Germany) was used for recombinant plasmid construction. Expression plasmid pET-
F1mutVSoc was constructed previously (17, 48). The pET-Soc-PA plasmid was constructed by replacing
the F1mutV gene of pET-F1mutV-PA (19) with Soc, which was amplified from pET-F1mutVSoc by PCR. The
amplified Soc fragment was doubly digested with NheI and HindIII and cloned into pET-F1mutV-PA,
linearized with the same enzymes, to replace F1mutV. The resulting pET-Soc-PA contains the Soc gene
fused in frame to the N terminus of PA with a short linker (Glu-Ala-Ser-Ala) between the Soc gene and
PA. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. E. coli strains DH5� was used for cloning. E. coli strain
P301 was used to propagate hoc� soc� phage T4 as described previously (49–51). The E. coli BL21-
CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) were used for expression of genes
encoding target proteins.
Purification of proteins. The E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL cells containing either pET-Soc-PA or
pET-F1mutVSoc were induced with 1 mM isopropyl-�-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 2 to 3 h at
28°
C. Recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (17, 48). Briefly, cells were harvested
and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole)
containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, USA, Indianapolis, IN). After the cells were lysed at 19,610
lb/in2 using a French press (Aminco, Urbana, IL), the soluble fractions of cell lysis containing the
His-tagged fusion proteins were isolated by centrifugation. Proteins were purified first by HisTrap column
(AKTA-prime; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) followed by size exclusion chromato-
graphy on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (AKTA-FPLC; GE Healthcare). The proteins were then
quantified and stored at �80°
C until use.
Purification of Hoc� Soc� T4 phage. Hoc� Soc� T4 phages were purified as described previously
(48, 49). Briefly, the propagated T4 phage on E. coli P301 was collected by centrifugation for 45 min at
25,000 � g. The pellet containing T4 phages was resuspended in 40 ml Pi-Mg buffer (26 mM Na2HPO4,
68 mM NaCl, 22 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4 [pH 7.5]) containing 10 �g/ml DNase I and chloroform (0.4 ml)
and incubated at 37°
C for 30 min. The lysate was subjected to low-speed centrifugation (6,000 � g for
10 min) and high-speed centrifugation (35,000 � g for 45 min), and the final phage pellet was resus-
pended in 200 �l of Tris-Mg buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2) and purified
by CsCl density gradient centrifugation.
In vitro binding of antigens to phage T4. In vitro binding of Soc fusion proteins to Hoc� Soc� T4
phage was conducted as previously described (17, 48). The same batch of purified phages was used for
all the animal immunization experiments (below). The proteins and phages used were highly pure, after
going through multiple rounds of purification steps as described above. As previously reported (17), the
endotoxin levels in three different batches of purified proteins ranged from 0.05 to 0.8 endotoxin unit
(EU) per ml, well below the maximum recommended endotoxin levels, 10 and 20 EU/ml, in gene vectors
and subunit vaccines, respectively (52). Moreover, the T4 nanoparticle vaccines used for immunizations
had undergone additional purification during the in vitro binding reaction where the displayed particles
were washed twice with excess phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the unbound antigen and any
other minor contaminants. Briefly, F1mutV-Soc or Soc-PA proteins were incubated with purified Hoc�
Soc� phage at 4°
C for 45 min. The phage particles containing the bound proteins were centrifuged at
34,000 � g for 45 min. After two washes with excess PBS buffer (pH 7.4) to remove unbound proteins,
the final phage pellets containing the bound antigens were resuspended in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Novex 4-20% Tris-Glycine Mini Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
The copy number of displayed antigen per capsid was calculated by quantifying the density of
Coomassie blue-stained Soc fusion bands and the internal control band, T4 gp23*, using the Bio-Rad
ChemiDoc MP imaging system. Each lane was individually quantified to minimize any staining differ-
ences. Since the copy number of the major capsid protein gp23* (molecular weight [MW] of 49 kDa) was
established to be 930 per capsid and that of the tail sheath protein gp18 (MW of 72 kDa) was established
to be 138 per phage and since we used 2 � 1010 particles in 200-�l reaction mixture, we could compute
the copy number of bound antigen per capsid. However, keeping in mind differences in the staining
densities of proteins and quantification of pixel densities, we estimated experimental variation to be
within twofold. Further, the data shown are consistent with the copy numbers determined in previous
studies using phage T4 Soc-PA (35) and samples prepared for many immunization experiments per-
formed as part of this study. For Fig. 2, the copy number is shown on the y axis at each of the ratios used.
The concentration of the free antigen (x axis) was determined by subtracting the capsid-bound antigen
from the total antigen added to the reaction mixture. Saturation binding curves (Fig. 2B and D) were then
generated from these data. The Bmax and BC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis
using GraphPad Prism-7 software (San Diego, CA). BC50, a measure of binding affinity, is defined as the
molar concentration of Soc fusion protein (ligand) at which half the available capsid binding sites are
occupied by the ligand. Bmax is defined as the maximum number of binding sites occupied by the
displayed Soc fusion protein per capsid particle as determined from the saturation binding curve.
Mouse immunizations and challenges. Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice (17 to 20 g)
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) were randomly assigned to groups and allowed
to acclimate for 7 days. Antigens were displayed on T4 as described above. A total of 50 �g antigen
(25 �g of each F1mutV and PA) was injected on days 0 and 21 via the i.m. route. Control mice received
the same amount of T4 but without any antigen. Blood samples were collected from each animal by the
retro-orbital route on day 0 (prebleeds) and day 35 for immunological analyses. Mice were sequentially
or simultaneously challenged with LeTx and Y. pestis CO92 as described previously (19). Briefly, in
sequential challenge, mice were i.p. challenged first with 1 LD100 of LeTx, followed by i.n. challenge with
400 LD50 (1 LD50�100 CFU in BALB/c mice) of Y. pestis CO92 33 days after LeTx challenge. In a separate

 simultaneous challenge experiment, mice were immunized as described above and i.p. challenged with
1 LD100 of LeTx, followed by i.n. challenge with 200 LD50 Y. pestis CO92 on the same day. All animals were
anesthetized by inhalation of 2% to 4% isoflurane (to effect) before challenge. Animals were monitored
twice daily for mortality and other clinical symptoms.
Rat immunizations and challenges. Female Brown Norway rats (50 to 75 g) were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories (New Jersey) and randomly grouped. After 7 days acclimation, rats were
immunized by intramuscular (i.m.) route with T4-displayed antigens prepared as described above.
Twenty-five micrograms of each antigen was used for immunizations as indicated in the figures. The
animals were bled on day 35 by the saphenous vein, and sera were obtained for immunological analyses.
Rats were sequentially challenged on day 42 with �400 LD50 Y. pestis CO92 (i.n.) followed by 1 LD100 LeTx
(7.5 �g of each of the toxin components [LF and PA]) challenge (i.v.). In a separate simultaneous
challenge experiment, rats (six rats per group) were immunized as described above and challenged
simultaneously with 1 LD100 of LeTx and 400 LD50 Y. pestis CO92 3 weeks after boost. All rats were
anesthetized by inhalation of 2% to 4% isoflurane (to effect) before challenge. Rats were monitored twice
a day for morbidity and mortality.
Rabbit immunization and challenge. The rabbit study was conducted by the Southern Research
Institute (study number 13538.01.15; Birmingham, AL). A total of 16 New Zealand White rabbits were
randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 was vaccinated with T4-displayed antigen (50 �g) (10 rabbits,
equal numbers of males and females), while group 2 received the same amount of T4 but without any
antigen (6 rabbits, equal numbers of males and females). Rabbits were immunized on days 0 and 14. Sera
were collected on days 0 (preimmune), 12, 20, and 42 for immunological analyses. For the challenge
experiment, the animals were loaded in the head-out plethysmograph, and a custom designed nose-only
inhalation challenge mask was placed over the snout of each rabbit so that the mouth and nares were
covered. At the start of the challenge period, the nebulizer and liquid impinger were actuated. Animals
received the aerosol challenge until a cumulative inhaled volume of 20 liters had been reached. The
inhalation exposure time was 11.7 to 22.8 min. Animals were challenged with 200 LD50 of aerosolized B.
anthracis Ames spores on day 28 and monitored for morbidity and mortality until day 42. The remaining
animals were then euthanized by an intravenous administration of a barbiturate overdose, and tissues
(brain, liver, lung, and spleen) were collected for B. anthracis detection on the same day. Blood samples
(approximately 0.2 ml) were also collected on days 27, 29 to 33, and 42 for microbiological analysis
(bacteremia).
Determination of IgG and IgG subtype antibodies. Antibody titers were determined by ELISA as
described previously (17, 42). Briefly, each well of a 96-well plate was coated with 100 ng of F1mutV or
PA diluted in coating buffer (0.05 M sodium carbonate-sodium bicarbonate [pH 9.6]) overnight at 4°
C.
The plates were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37°
C. After
1 h of incubation at 37°
C with serially diluted serum samples, plates were washed with PBS-T (PBS with
0.1% Tween 20 [pH 7.4]). For total IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), rabbit anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen), or goat anti-rabbit IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD)
was used as the secondary antibody. For mouse or rat IgG subtypes, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse
or HRP-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG1 or IgG2a secondary antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) were
used. Samples were initially diluted 1:200; serial fivefold dilutions were performed as necessary to ensure
that values reached the endpoint. For rabbit anti-PA IgG titers, plates were coated with PA, and
affinity-purified rabbit anti-PA polyclonal antibody was used to generate a standard curve, from which
the sample anti-PA IgG concentrations (in nanograms per milliliter) were determined. 3,3=,5,5=-
Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) microwell peroxidase substrate kit (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was used for
staining.
Anthrax LeTx neutralization assay. Anthrax lethal-toxin-neutralizing assay was performed as
described previously (53). Briefly, PA and LF were diluted to the final concentration of 200 ng/ml with
Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s medium (DMEM). Serially diluted serum samples were added to the toxin
mixture, incubated for 1 h at 37°
C, and then transferred to RAW264.7 macrophage cells grown to
confluence in 96-well plates and incubated for 5 h. The viability of cells was assessed by incubation with
MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazo-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a final con-
centration of 0.5 mg/ml for 30 min. The medium was aspirated, the insoluble pigment (formazan)
produced by living cells was dissolved by adding a solution containing 0.5% SDS, 25 mM HCl, and 90%
isopropanol, and the optical density (570 nm) was measured to assess viability. The effective serum
concentration inducing 50% neutralization (EC50) was calculated with Graphpad Prism-7 software (San
Diego, CA).
Live-animal imaging. In vivo imaging was performed as described previously (39). Briefly, 3 days
after challenge with Y. pestis CO92-luciferase strain, the animals were imaged by using an IVIS 200
bioluminescence and fluorescence whole-body imaging workstation (Caliper Corp., Alameda, CA) in the
ABSL-3 at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) facility after lightly anesthetizing the animals
with isofluorane.
Statistical analyses. Results are expressed as means � standard deviations (SD). Statistical compar-
isons between groups were evaluated by Student’
s t test. The animal mortality data were analyzed by the
Kaplan-Meier survival estimate. A P value of �0.05 was considered statistically significant.
