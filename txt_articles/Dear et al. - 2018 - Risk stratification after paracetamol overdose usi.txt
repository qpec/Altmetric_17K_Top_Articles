Summary
Background Paracetamol overdose is common but patient stratification is suboptimal. We investigated the usefulness 
of new biomarkers that have either enhanced liver specificity (microRNA-122 [miR-122]) or provide mechanistic 
insights (keratin-18 [K18], high mobility group box-1 [HMGB1], and glutamate dehydrogenase [GLDH]). The use of 
these biomarkers could help stratify patients for their risk of liver injury at hospital presentation.
Methods Using data from two prospective cohort studies, we assessed the potential for biomarkers to stratify patients 
who overdose with paracetamol. We completed two independent prospective studies: a derivation study (MAPP) in 
eight UK hospitals and a validation study (BIOPAR) in ten UK hospitals. Patients in both cohorts were adults 
(≥18 years in England, ≥16 years in Scotland), were diagnosed with paracetamol overdose, and gave written informed 
consent. Patients who needed intravenous acetylcysteine treatment for paracetamol overdose had circulating 
biomarkers measured at hospital presentation. The primary endpoint was acute liver injury indicating need for 
continued acetylcysteine treatment beyond the standard course (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] activity >100 U/L). 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, category-free net reclassification index (cfNRI), and integrated 
discrimination index (IDI) were applied to assess endpoint prediction.
Findings Between June 2, 2010, and May 29, 2014, 1187 patients who required acetylcysteine treatment for paracetamol 
overdose were recruited (985 in the MAPP cohort; 202 in the BIOPAR cohort). In the derivation and validation 
cohorts, acute liver injury was predicted at hospital presentation by miR-122 (derivation cohort ROC–area under the 
curve [AUC] 0·97 [95% CI 0·95–0·98]), HMGB1 (0·95 [0·93–0·98]), and full-length K18 (0·95 [0·92–0·97]). Results 
were similar in the validation cohort (miR-122 AUC 0·97 [95% CI 0·95–0·99], HMGB1 0·98 [0·96–0·99], and 
full-length K18 0·93 [0·86–0·99]). A combined model of miR-122, HMGB1, and K18 predicted acute liver injury 
better than ALT alone (cfNRI 1·95 [95% CI 1·87–2·03], p<0·0001 in the MAPP cohort; 1·54 [1·08–2·00], p<0·0001 in 
the BIOPAR cohort).
Interpretation Personalised treatment pathways could be developed by use of miR-122, HMGB1, and full-length K18 
at hospital presentation for patient stratification. This prospective study supports their use for hepatic safety 
assessment of new medicines.

Introduction
Paracetamol is a safe analgesic drug when taken at 
therapeutic doses. However, in overdose, paracetamol is 
hepatotoxic and is the most common cause of acute liver 
failure in the USA and Europe.1,2 After overdose, the 
metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) is 
generated in excess, which depletes glutathione (GSH) 
and leads to oxidative stress and hepatocyte death, 
predominately by necrosis.3 Cell death releases intra-
cellular molecules into the blood to produce changes in 
circulating protein and RNA.4
The current antidote, acetylcysteine, prevents liver 
injury by replenishing GSH if administered within a few 
hours of overdose.5 The decision to commence treatment 
with acetylcysteine after a single overdose is based on the 
reported dose ingested and a timed blood paracetamol 
concentration, which is interpreted using a binary treat 
or no treat nomogram with the treatment threshold at a 
level of low risk. Even with this conservative approach 
there are patients who develop acute liver injury. Current 
markers, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity 
and paracetamol concentration, lack sensitivity and 
specificity when measured soon after overdose such as at 
initial presentation to hospital.6–8 These limitations are 
further compounded in staggered overdose, for which 
there is an increased acute liver injury risk but for which 
treatment nomograms are not recommended.9,10 Acute 
liver injury results in prolonged hospital admission for 
continued acetylcysteine therapy (with concomitant 
prolonged occupancy of acute hospital beds) and, in

severe cases, might result in acute liver failure and 
even the need for liver transplantation to avoid death 
(fortunately these life-threatening clinical scenarios are 
rare with prompt acetylcysteine treatment). Targeted 
therapies that reduce cell death and inflammation11 and 
aid tissue regeneration12 are in development, but they are 
still some way from routine clinical implementation.
Stratified pathways that selectively target treatments to 
patients who stand to benefit would be ideal. However, 
there is an unmet need for accurate biomarkers that 
predict liver injury that will not be prevented by standard 
acetylcysteine treatment soon after overdose.6–8 These 
biomarkers should also be useful in the context of a 
staggered overdose, a scenario with increased acute liver 
injury risk but for which treatment nomograms are not 
applicable.9,10
Preclinical studies of paracetamol-induced acute liver 
injury have identified the liver-enriched microRNA-122 
(miR-122), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), 
keratin-18 (K18; both caspase-cleaved and full-length), 
and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) as sensitive 
predictors of subsequent hepatotoxicity.13,14 In 129 patients 
who had ingested a single paracetamol overdose (no 
staggered overdoses were included) we showed in a 
proof-of-concept study15 that miR-122, HMGB1, and 
full-length K18 can identify acute liver injury on hospital 
admission at a time when currently used markers of 
liver injury (ie, ALT concentration) were still normal. 
miR-122 provides enhanced hepatic specificity over all 
the current biomarkers.16 HMGB1 is reflective of cell 
necrosis and activated immune cells.11 Inhibition of 
HMGB1 in rodent models attenuates paracetamol toxic 
effects, indicating that it is a mediator of injury.11 Cell 
apoptosis is reported by caspase-cleaved K18, whereas 
full-length K18 reports necrosis.13 GLDH is a marker of 
mitochondrial dysfunction.17 These markers also have 
the potential to aid the process of hepatic safety 
assessment in preclinical and clinical drug development. 
This has been recognised with regulatory support for 
further qualification of miR-122, HMGB1, K18, and 
GLDH being given by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) across the spectrum of drug-induced 
liver injury.18,19
The objective of this study was to explore the ability of 
these new mechanistic biomarkers to stratify patients by 
risk of subsequent liver injury in two prospectively 
recruited cohorts of patients with paracetamol overdose 
who faithfully represented the spectrum of clinical 
presentations.
Methods
Study design and participants
We report the outcomes of two prospective cohort 
studies: Markers and Paracetamol Poisoning (MAPP) and 
Biomarkers of Paracetamol Hepatotoxicity (BIOPAR). 
Both were done in compliance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and 
reported according to the Standards for Reporting 
Diagnostic Accuracy.20,21
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Paracetamol overdose is a common reason for hospital 
admission. The decision to treat with the antidote 
acetylcysteine is based on the reported dose of drug 
ingested, a timed blood paracetamol concentration, and 
whether there is liver injury, which is reported 
predominately by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
activity. We searched PubMed with no restrictions using the 
keywords “biomarker” AND “paracetamol” OR 
“acetaminophen” AND “liver” AND “human” AND “hospital 
admission”, which yielded 101 papers by the end of the search 
on Dec 16, 2016. Review of these papers highlighted an 
unmet need for new treatment pathways that are informed 
by an enhanced ability to identify patients who will develop 
liver injury despite current treatment. The results of this 
search included our 2013 proof-of-concept study, which 
showed that a panel of new biomarkers stratified patients 
with paracetamol overdose by their risk of liver injury at 
hospital presentation. This study included 129 patients who 
had an acute overdose and highlights the need for 
multicentre prospective studies that include all patterns 
of overdose.
Added value of this study
We, and others, have identified sensitive and specific 
biomarkers of paracetamol hepatotoxicity that have either 
enhanced liver specificity (microRNA-122 [miR-122]) or provide 
mechanistic insights (keratin-18 [K18], high mobility group 
box-1 [HMGB1], and glutamate dehydrogenase [GLDH]). 
HMGB1 is a mediator of toxicity and potential drug target. This 
study tested the usefulness of these biomarkers prospectively in 
derivation and validation overdose cohorts. We showed that 
these new biomarkers accurately identify patients who will get 
liver injury despite current guideline-based clinical treatment. 
The performance of the markers is maintained across the 
different paracetamol overdose clinical phenotypes. 
Implications of all the available evidence
With regard to paracetamol overdose, future clinical trials 
should incorporate measurement of miR-122, HMGB1, and K18 
because these markers identify patients, at first attendance to 
hospital, who require additional treatment to prevent liver 
injury. Beyond paracetamol overdose, this study confirms that 
these markers are more sensitive than current liver injury 
markers. They should be added into the assessment of hepatic 
safety for new medicines in early phase clinical trials.

For the MAPP study, adults (≥16 years in Scotland, 
≥18 years in England) were recruited when research 
staff were available and if the patient had capacity to 
provide informed consent as per the study inclusion 
criteria from eight hospitals in the UK. Research 
nurses identified participants on admission to 
hospital. The inclusion criteria were: a history of 
paracetamol overdose that the treating clinician judged 
to warrant treatment with intravenous acetylcysteine 
as per UK guidelines, a first blood sample obtained 
within 24 h of paracetamol ingestion, and for patients 
to have the capacity to consent. All patterns of 
paracetamol overdose were eligible for inclusion (ie, 
early presenting acute overdose or late presenting 
acute and staggered oversode). Staggered overdose 
was defined as ingestion over 2 h or more. The 
exclusion criteria were detention under the Mental 
Health Act; documented cognitive impairment; 
inability to provide informed consent for any reason; 
or an unreliable overdose history. Full written 
informed consent was obtained from every participant, 
and ethical approval was from the South East Scotland 
Research Ethics Committee and the East of Scotland 
Research Ethics Committee via the South East 
Scotland Human Bioresource. 
For the BIOPAR study, adults (≥18 years) were recruited 
by convenience sampling from ten UK hospitals. The 
inclusion criteria were willingness to provide informed 
consent and diagnosis with paracetamol overdose 
(>4 g in 24 h). All patterns of paracetamol overdose were 
eligible for inclusion. Staggered ingestion was defined as 
over 2 h or more. Patients were excluded if they were 
unable to consent or not suitable for participation, as 
determined by the local investigator. Full written 
informed consent was obtained from every participant 
and ethical approval was from the North West Centre of 
Research Ethics Committee.
Procedures
In MAPP and BIOPAR, demographic information was 
recorded for study participants and the blood sample 
taken at first presentation to hospital was stored at 
–80°C as plasma or serum. All blood results from the 
first hospital admission were recorded (paracetamol, 
alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin, 
creatinine, and ALT concentration, prothrombin time, 
and international normalised ratio [INR]). Data were 
also obtained regarding the pattern of overdose, time of 
overdose, and other drugs ingested.
The reference standard of injury was ALT concentration. 
miR-122, HMGB1, caspase-cleaved K18, full-length K18, 
and GLDH were measured in the admission blood 
sample, as previously described,15 with miR-122 measured 
by PCR and other markers measured by ELISA; each 
biomarker was measured in each sample in duplicate. 
miR-122 concentration was expressed with reference 
to the circulating microRNA let-7d as the internal 
microRNA normaliser. Investigators measuring the 
novel biomarkers were masked to the details of patient 
history and other biochemistry results. Assay develop-
ment and validation have been described previously.13,22
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was acute liver injury, predefined 
as ALT greater than 100 U/L (the UK criteria for the 
use of additional acetylcysteine beyond the standard 
21 h course). Secondary endpoints were peak ALT of 
more than 1000 U/L and liver synthetic dysfunction 
(INR>1·5).
Statistical analysis
The recruitment target was 1000 patients for the 
derivation (MAPP) cohort, with 8% of patients 
anticipated to exhibit the primary endpoint.23 On this 
basis, the denominator would be 920 for calculating the 
biomarker negative predictive value and 80 for the 
positive predictive value. Given that the aim of this study 
was to identify the success of these biomarkers and tests 
for the purposes of identifying the primary endpoint, 
the denominator for determining the negative and 
positive predictive values was unknown. However, a 
broad range of denominators was considered based on

what might be clinically plausible considering these 
assumptions. 
This 
included 
between 
750 
and 
950 patients for the negative predictive value and 
between 50 and 250 patients for the positive predictive 
value. Across a broad range of possible negative 
predictive values (50–90%), the 95% CI range for the 
negative predictive value would be ±1·9% to ±3·6%, 
indicating very precise estimation. The 95% CI range 
for the positive predictive value would range from 
±3·7% to ±13·9%, indicating acceptable precision.
Initially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
were derived from values at first presentation. The areas 
under ROC curves (AUCs) were compared between 
biomarkers by the methods developed previously using 
Graphpad Prism version 7
.15 We used R, version 2.1.2.1, for 
multivariable logistic regression analyses and to assess 
the discriminative ability of a combination of biomarkers 
for predicting the primary endpoint. Singular biomarkers 
that were significant in univariable logistic regression 
were entered into forward, backward, and stepwise 
selection processes. The results of these selection 
processes were compared to discern the maximal model.
We investigated the ability of our biomarkers to predict 
the later development of acute liver injury with category-
free net reclassification index (cfNRI) and integrated 
discrimination index (IDI) analyses.24 Because there are 
no established risk thresholds for acute liver injury, 
cfNRI was used as opposed to the standard net 
reclassification index (NRI). To discern improved 
performance, cfNRI or IDI requires a current standard 
model to compare with a proposed maximal model. For 
acute liver injury, the current standard model is the use 
of ALT on presentation to hospital and this was therefore 
compared with the maximal model identified by the 
variable selection processes. To apply cfNRI or IDI, we 
used the Harrell miscellaneous (Hmisc) R package, 
version 4.0-2.

Demographic data and clinical chemistry parameters 
are presented in table 1. No patients died or required 
liver transplantation in either cohort. Alcohol was co-
ingested in 473 (48%) of 985 patients in the MAPP 
cohort and in 105 (52%) of 202 patients in the BIOPAR 
cohort. There were no missing data in either cohort.
There were significant correlations between peak 
hospital stay, activity of ALT, and concentrations of all 
biomarkers on first presentation to hospital in both the 
derivation and validation cohorts (appendix pp 1–2). 
These analyses were also supported by ROC analysis 
showing 
the 
associations 
between 
biomarker 
concentrations at presentation to hospital and peak ALT 
of more than 100 U/L (table 2). In the derivation cohort, 
ROC–AUC values to predict ALT greater than 100 U/L 
were: 0·97 (95% CI 0·95–0·98) for miR-122, 0·95 
(0·93–0·98) for HMGB1, and 0·95 (0·92–0·97) 
for full-length K18. These values were similar for 
the validation cohort (miR-122 0·97 [0·95–0·99], 
HMGB1 0·98 [0·96–0·99], 0·93 [0·86–0·99]). The ROC 
analysis also showed asso 
ciation between biomarker 
concentrations and peak ALT of more than 1000 U/L 
(appendix pp 5–6).
To establish whether the biomarkers had enhanced 
sensitivity we focused on the 875 patients from the 
derivation cohort with a normal ALT activity (<50 U/L) 
and INR (<1·5) at first presentation to hospital (figure). 
miR-122, HMGB1, and both K18 molecular forms were 
measured in all patients and were significantly higher 
in patients who developed subsequent acute liver injury 
(appendix p 3). These biomarkers performed with a 
high degree of sensitivity and specificity in identifying 
subsequent acute liver injury (ie, an increase in ALT 
>100 U/L) in both the derivation and validation cohorts 
(table 3), or an ALT of more than 1000 U/L (appendix 
p 6). For patients with acute overdose, miR-122, 
HMGB1, and K18 maintained sensitivity and specificity 
when patients were censored by time from overdose to 
initiation of acetylcysteine (less than 8 h or 8 h and 
greater) in both the derivation and validation cohorts 
(appendix p 7).
All biomarkers and patient characteristics were 
included in the multivariable logistic regression 
analyses to assess improvement in prognostic ability. 
Forward, backward, and stepwise selection processes all 
confirmed that the maximal prognostic model consisted

of miR-122, HMGB1, full-length K18, and caspase-
cleaved K18 (cfNRI 1·95 [95% CI 1·87–2·03], p<0·0001 
in the MAPP cohort and 1·54 [1·08–2·00], p<0·0001 in 
the BIOPAR cohort; appendix p 8). The added 
prognostic ability of the maximal prognostic model to 
an ALT-only model was supported by the results of 
cfNRI and IDI (appendix p 8). To assess whether the 
maximal prognostic model components could be 
reduced by assessment of the subsequent impact on 
cfNRI and IDI, the biomarkers within the model 
derived from the derivation cohort were ordered by the 
magnitude of their standardised coefficient thus: 
miR-122 (standardised β coefficient 149·7), full-length 
K18 (8·7), caspase-cleaved K18 (8·0), then HMGB1 
(4·3). With miR-122 alone, 45 (90%) of 50 patients in 
the derivation cohort with acute liver injury were 
correctly identified at first presentation. In patients 
without acute liver injury, 735 (89%) of 825 patients in 
the derivation cohort were correctly identified (appendix 
p 9). With the addition of full-length K18, caspase-
cleaved K18, and HMGB1, 49 (98%) of 50 patients with 
acute liver injury were correctly identified at first 
presentation. In patients without acute liver injury, 
824 (99·9%) of 825 patients were correctly identified 
with this combination of biomarkers (appendix p 9). 
When the maximal prognostic model derived from the 
derivation cohort was assessed in the validation cohort 
using cfNRI and IDI, it continued to provide robust 
stratification of patients by risk of subsequent acute 
liver injury. Similar to the derivation cohort, miR-122 
alone identified nine (69%) of 13 patients in the 
validation cohort with subsequent acute liver injury at 
first presentation to hospital. In patients without 
subsequent acute liver injury, all of the 163 patients in 
the validation cohort were correctly identified by 
miR-122 alone (appendix p 9). With the addition of 
full-length K18, caspase-cleaved K18, and HMGB1, 
ten (77%) of 13 patients with subsequent acute liver 
injury were correctly identified at first presentation 
(appendix p 9).
HMGB1 had the highest ROC–AUC, most favourable 
positive and negative predictive values, and the highest 
sensitivity at 95% specificity for the prediction of 
the secondary endpoint hepatic synthetic dysfunction 
(INR >1·5) in both cohorts (table 4). Multivariable logistic 
regression analyses confirmed the maximal prognostic 
model for elevation in INR consisted only of HMGB1 
(appendix p 4). For the analysis of HMGB1 in all patients 
in the derivation cohort who presented to hospital with 
normal liver function tests, 21 (66%) of 32 cases were 
correctly identified as having a subsequent increase in 
INR. In patients who did not develop an increase in INR, 
816 (97%) of 843 patients in the derivation cohort were 
correctly identified. In the validation cohort, three (50%) 
of six patients were correctly identified as having a 
subsequent increase in INR despite normal liver function 
tests at first presentation to hospital. In patients who did 
not develop an increase in INR, 163 (96%) of 170 were 
correctly identified.
After staggered overdose, miR-122, HMGB1, and K18 
were significantly higher in patients who developed acute 
liver injury than those who did not in both the MAPP 
(miR-122 0·16 vs 60·2, HMGB1 1·01 ng/mL vs 
6·98 ng/mL, full-length K18 289·6 U/L vs 851·9 U/L, all 
p<0·0001) and BIOPAR cohorts (miR-122 0·14 vs 28·1, 
p<0·0001; HMGB1 1·07 ng/mL vs 4·9 ng/mL, p<0·0001; 
full-length K18 279·5 U/L vs 698·7 U/L, p=0·082; table 5). 
Again, in both the derivation and validation cohorts, 
ROC analysis showed high sensitivity and specificity 
with regard to identifying acute liver injury at first 
presentation to hospital, with miR-122 and HMGB1 
having ROC–AUC values of 1 (table 5). Finally, in the 
derivation cohort there were 76 patients with an unknown 
pattern of overdose. In these patients, ROC–AUC values 
for miR-122 (0·93, 95% CI 0·85–1·00), HMGB1 (0·89, 
0·75–1·00), and K18 (0·85, 0·59–1·00) showed a high 
sensitivity and specificity for acute liver injury. Only one 
patient had an unknown pattern of oversode in the 
validation cohort, so it was not possible to verify the 
findings in this cohort.

Discussion
In these prospective cohort studies we have shown that a 
panel of novel biomarkers was able to identify patients at 
risk of subsequent liver injury at first presentation to 
hospital. miR-122, HMGB1, and K18 had superior 
sensitivity compared with the current gold standard 
marker (ALT). Furthermore, we have shown that HMGB1 
predicted liver synthetic dysfunction. We propose that this 
combination of biomarkers could be used for stratification 
of patients for their risk of liver injury and therefore 
targeting of preventive novel treatment pathways.
The derivation cohort recruited 985 patients across 
eight hospitals, including a range of paracetamol overdose 
presentations (early presenting, late presenting, and 
staggered ingestions) that faithfully reflect routine clinical 
practice. Importantly, acute alcohol consumption, which is 
common with paracetamol overdose, does not significantly 
affect the circulating concentration of miR-122, HMGB1, 
or K18 and therefore is not a potential confounding factor.25
The best predictive model was composed of miR-122, 
HMGB1, and the K18 isoforms. Addition of GLDH, a 
putative marker of mitochondrial toxicity, all current 
biomarkers (ALT, INR, plasma paracetamol concen-
tration), and all recorded patient clinical characteristics 
(eg, dose ingested and time to treatment) did not improve 
the specificity or sensitivity of the model. When ranked by 
their standardised contribution to the model, miR-122 was 
the best predictor of ALT increase, probably because of the 
enhanced liver specificity of miR-122 compared with ALT, 
its bioanalytical sensitivity of detection, and because 
microRNAs can be actively secreted from dying or stressed 
hepatocytes with their membrane integrity intact.26 
The improved tissue specificity of miR-122 compared with 
ALT is supported by the observation that increases in ALT 
associated with muscle injury are not accompanied by 
concomitant increases in miR-122.27
Despite our findings, the following limitation warrants 
consideration. This study was an observational cohort 
study with the overall event rate of abnormal ALT 
(ie, >100 U/L) being 10·7% in the derivation cohort and 
12·9% in the validation cohort. This low event rate could 
bias model performance. However, the event rate with 
regard to our primary endpoint is consistent with other 
studies28 and is similar to data we obtained from 
auditing all consecutive patients admitted to hospital 
with paracetamol overdose in Edinburgh over 3 years 
(ALT >100 U/L in 164 [10%] of 1641 patients; J W Dear, 
University 
of 
Edinburgh, 
unpublished 
data). 
Furthermore, the number of patients recruited was 
guided by a power calculation that incor 
porated a lower 
event rate than that actually observed (8%). Therefore, 
the data presented in this study are relevant to the 
common clinical challenge of treating an unselected 
population of patients with paracetamol overdose. This 
large population of people who present to the hospital 
and require intervention (about 50 000 per year in the 
UK) predominantly use health service resources by 
needing treatment with acetylcysteine in hospital 
emergency beds rather than by needing escalation to 
critical care. Future studies are needed to define the 
ability of these markers to predict rarer outcomes such 
as liver failure and death.
Our primary endpoint was an increase in ALT to more 
than 100 U/L and is lower than published case definitions 
for drug-induced liver injury.29 However, this cutoff is 
used clinically to indicate the need for further 
acetylcysteine treatment in the UK with concomitant 
prolongation of hospital stay. Additionally, this ALT 
cutoff is evidence based. The increases in ALT 
concentrations that accompany paracetamol overdose 
have been previously described.30 Green and colleagues30 
showed that 91 (97%) of 94 patients with a peak ALT 
concentration of more than 1000 U/L (indicative of 
hepatotoxicity) also had an ALT concentration of more 
than 100 U/L at the end of the standard 21 h acetylcysteine 
treatment. It is therefore unlikely that substantial liver 
injury will occur if ALT is less than 100 U/L, and this 
finding supports the basis of the UK clinical guidance.

Although other countries have different criteria for 
identifying whether or not it is safe to discontinue 
acetylcysteine treatment, multiples of the upper limit of 
normal (50 U/L) of ALT are still used. For example, 
acetylcysteine is continued if ALT is greater than 50 U/L 
in Australia on the basis of literature evidence 
30 that 
substantial liver injury is unlikely if ALT concentrations 
are less than 100 U/L; however, 50 U/L or greater is still 
above the limit of normal, so this conservative approach 
is still used. However, we acknowledge the ALT increase 
to 100 U/L used in our study was modest and did 
not result in life-threatening disease and requires 
investigation in other cohorts worldwide. Additionally, 
our findings show that biomarker performance was also 
maintained in both the derivation and validation cohorts 
when a more substantial increase in ALT activity of more 
than 1000 U/L was assessed. It is also important to note 
that even substantive increases in ALT activity are not 
useful for prognosis in patients with established acute 
liver injury and so ALT is not part of prognostic models 
such as the King’s College Criteria (KCC)31 and MELD.32 
By contrast, INR is established as a biomarker of patient 
prognosis and is a core component of KCC and MELD. 
In our study we also analysed INR increases as a 
secondary endpoint and showed that only HMGB1 at 
first presentation to hospital predicted a subsequent INR 
of more than 1·5. This was shown by ROC analysis 
and multivariable logistic regression analysis in the 
derivation cohort and replicated in the validation cohort. 
Lower patient numbers reached this secondary endpoint; 
however, the ability of HMGB1 to predict an increase in 
INR would be expected to translate into an ability to 
identify patients at risk of adverse outcomes such as 
acute liver failure and death. However, whether HMGB1 
can predict adverse outcomes requires further validation 
in higher-risk populations. We speculate that the 
enhanced prognostic ability of HMGB1 in comparison 
with the other markers reflects its key role in the 
mechanism of injury. HMGB1 links hepatocyte death to 
the activation of an immune response by targeting Toll-
like receptors and the receptor for advanced glycation 
end products.33–35 Blocking the effect of HMGB1 using 
anti-HMGB1 antibodies,36 inhibitory peptides,37 or by 
liver-specific HMGB1 gene ablation11 prevents the toxic 
effects of paracetamol in rodents. Anti-HMGB1 
antibodies are being developed for human use and 
represent novel biological therapies for the treatment of 
acute liver injury.
We propose that miR-122 and HMGB1 offer a 
biomarker combination that is complementary to 
established markers. These new markers offer higher 
liver specificity (miR-122) and prognostic capability 
(HMGB1) that are fundamentally linked to the disease 
mechanism. Although we used continuous variables in 
our analysis, these findings now show the clinical validity 
of these biomarkers and provide a platform to assess the 
usefulness of cutoff values derived from these data in 
further prospective studies. Essential to the further 
development of these biomarkers is the availability of 
rapid and cost-effective clinical assays. Development and 
validation of clinical assays with a rapid turnaround time 
would allow their use for the stratification of patients 
presenting acutely with paracetamol overdose and for 
assessment of liver toxicity with other drugs. With further 
development, the measurement of one or more of these 
assays could be inexpensive and rapid. The protein 
analytes are in relatively high concentration in blood so 
would be amenable to measurement on existing hospital 
biochemistry platforms. With respect to miR-122, a 2017 
report38 describes a rapid assay that can accurately 
diagnose liver toxicity and has a product profile suitable 
for use in the acute setting.
In the context of paracetamol overdose, the key finding 
of this study is that these markers identify patients who 
will require prolonged hospital treatment despite 
receiving acetylcysteine and irrespective of other clinical 
parameters. Therefore, they could facilitate clinical 
development of novel individualised acetylcysteine 
regimens and new therapeutic agents by enriching trials 
for patients who will develop injury. Currently 
acetylcysteine dosing is based solely on bodyweight 
despite multiple studies showing that the conventional 
dose (300 mg/kg) is too low in larger overdoses.39 miR-122 
and HMGB1 could be used to refine patient selection for 
trials of higher acetylcysteine doses. New therapeutic 
agents—that target the unmet need of treating liver injury 
that develops despite acetylcysteine treatment—are in 
clinical development (eg, NCT03177395).40 These studies 
could be galvanised by making use of miR-122 and 
HMGB1, both for patient selection and as drug efficacy 
biomarkers. When effective therapeutic strategies are 
identified, miR-122, HMGB1, or a combination of both 
biomarkers could represent promising complementary 
diagnostics. These bio 
markers might be particularly 
useful in staggered overdoses, where the use of 
acetylcysteine treatment nomograms is not recommended 
for selecting which patients require treatment, and when 
patients are being considered for hospital discharge at the 
end of acetylcysteine treatment. In support of this, we 
have published a proof-of-concept case report of a patient 
who developed clinically significant acute liver injury 
after overdose, but who had been discharged from 
hospital 
without 
acetylcysteine 
treatment 
because 
circulating ALT and paracetamol measurements did not 
indicate the need for treatment (ie, were false negative 
results). miR-122 and HMGB1 were significantly 
increased at first presentation to hospital in this patient 
and, therefore, their measurement in real time would 
have prevented this patient from developing liver injury 
by unequivocally indicating the need for acetylcysteine.41 
Novel, short, acetylcysteine treatment regimens are in 
clinical 
development.28 
Incorporation 
of 
miR-122, 
HMGB1, or K18 measurements into these treatment 
pathways (alongside ALT) has the potential to facilitate

prompt patient discharge at the end of treatment and 
thus reduce hospital bed occupancy. For all these clinical 
indications it will be essential that future studies identify 
whether incorporation of biomarkers is cost-effective. 
Beyond paracetamol overdose, this prospective study 
supports the decision by the FDA and EMA to evaluate 
miR-122 and HMGB1 as tools for safety assessment in 
drug development.
In summary, these multicentre studies have shown the 
clinical validity of a panel of novel mechanism-based 
biomarkers in the context of patient stratification after 
paracetamol overdose. These biomarkers should be 
incor 
porated into future clinical trials to develop new 
therapeutic pathways for paracetamol overdose treat-
ment. Furthermore, these liver injury markers should 
be considered for both retrospective and prospective 
analysis of the mechanistic basis of hepatotoxicity 
resulting from new compounds in development.
