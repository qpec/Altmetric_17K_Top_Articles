Abstract
IMPORTANCE—The natriuretic peptides are biochemical markers of heart failure (HF) severity 
and predictors of adverse outcomes. Smaller studies have evaluated adjusting HF therapy based on 
natriuretic peptide levels (“guided therapy”) with inconsistent results.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether an amino-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-
proBNP)-guided treatment strategy improves clinical outcomes compared to usual care in high-
risk patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS—The GUIDing Evidence Based Therapy Using 
Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure (GUIDE-IT) study was a randomized multi-
center clinical trial conducted between January 16, 2013 and September 20, 2016 at 45 clinical 
sites in the United States and Canada. This study planned to randomize 1,100 patients with HFrEF 
(ejection fraction ≤40%), elevated natriuretic peptide levels within the prior 30 days, and a history 
of a prior HF event (HF hospitalization or equivalent) to either an NT-proBNP-guided strategy or 
usual care.
INTERVENTION—Patients were randomized to either an NT-proBNP-guided strategy or usual 
care. Patients randomized to the guided strategy (n = 446) had HF therapy titrated with the goal of 
achieving a target NT-proBNP <1,000 pg/mL. Patients randomized to usual care (n = 448) had

 heart failure care in accordance with published guidelines, with emphasis on titration of proven 
neurohormonal therapies for heart failure. Serial measurement of NT-proBNP testing was 
discouraged in the usual care group.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary endpoint was the composite of time-to-
first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality. Prespecified secondary endpoints included all-
cause mortality, total hospitalizations for HF, days alive and not hospitalized for cardiovascular 
reasons, the individual components on the primary endpoint, and adverse events.
RESULTS—The Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended stopping the study for futility 
when 894 (median age, 63; 286 (32%) women) of the planned 1,100 patients had been enrolled 
and followed for a median of 15 months. The primary endpoint occurred in 164 patients (37%) in 
the biomarker-guided group and 164 patients (37%) in the usual care group (adjusted hazard 
ratio=0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.79–1.22; p=0.88). Cardiovascular mortality was 12% in the 
biomarker guided group and 13% in the usual care group (hazard ratio=0.94 (95% confidence 
interval 0.65–1.37, p = 0.75). Neither other secondary endpoints nor achieved decreases in NT-
proBNP levels were significantly different between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In high-risk patients with HFrEF, a strategy of NT-
proBNP-guided therapy was not more effective than a usual care strategy in improving outcomes.

Keywords
amino-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; patient 
outcomes
Evidence-based therapies such as targeting neurohormonal activation significantly improve 
outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). Nevertheless, available data suggest that many 
patients in clinical practice are either not treated with these agents or are treated with lower 
than recommended doses.1,2 The natriuretic peptides, specifically B-type natriuretic peptide 
(BNP) and amino-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are biomarkers that 
reflect HF severity and are significantly associated with adverse outcomes in HF.3,4 These 
markers decline in response to the use of guideline-recommended HF therapies, and rising 
levels portend a poor prognosis.5 These observational data have led to the hypothesis that 
serial measurements of natriuretic peptides may be used to guide titration of chronic medical 
therapy in HF.
Previous clinical trials of varying size and design have tested this hypothesis over the last 
two decades, with mixed results.6–11 These studies have generally been limited by their 
small size and also by significant heterogeneity between studies. Several meta-analyses have 
suggested substantial benefits with this approach, but no individual study has been of 
sufficient power to be definitive.12,13 In light of this uncertainly, current guidelines do not 
recommend the use of serial measurements of natriuretic peptides to guide titration of HF 
therapy.14,15 The Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment 
in Heart Failure (GUIDE-IT) multicenter randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate

 the efficacy of a NT-proBNP-guided HF treatment strategy compared to optimal medical 
therapy alone in high-risk patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Methods
Study Design
The details of the rationale and design for this study have been published previously.16 The 
study protocol, including the statistical analysis plan, is provided in the Supplemental 
Material. The study was approved by the institutional review board at each study site, and all 
participants provided written informed consent. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) appointed by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute monitored study 
conduct and patient safety. In order to maximize adherence to the study protocol, an 
adherence committee reviewed episodes in which HF therapy was not titrated despite NT-
proBNP values being above the target and provided general feedback to the Executive 
Committee and the study sites (including study site score cards indicating cumulative site 
performance with regard to protocol adherence) on a regular basis. The adherence 
committee had a stepped approached for sites with consistently poor performance, including 
contact from the coordinating center and escalation to the Executive Committee to reinforce 
study goals and site training.
Study Participants
Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had chronic HFrEF with an ejection fraction of 
40% or less, a history of a prior HF event (hospitalization for HF, emergency department 
visit for HF, or outpatient treatment with intravenous diuretics for HF) within the prior 12 
months, and an NT-proBNP >2,000 pg/mL or BNP >400 pg/mL within the prior 30 days. 
Patients were excluded if they had an acute coronary syndrome or revascularization 
procedure within the prior 30 days, cardiac resynchronization therapy within the prior 3 
months, end-stage renal disease, or anticipated heart transplantation or mechanical cardiac 
support within the next 12 months. In accordance with NIH policy, patient reported race and 
ethnicity information was collected using fixed categories.
Randomization and Treatment Assignments
Enrolled patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion using computer generated random 
numbers using a simple randomization design with no restrictions to either the NT-proBNP-
guided therapy strategy or usual care. Given the nature of the study intervention, treatment 
assignment was not blinded. For patients randomized to the NT-proBNP-guided strategy, 
clinicians were instructed to titrate HF therapy to target an NT-proBNP level <1,000 pg/mL. 
Specific adjustments of therapy for individual patients were at the discretion of the treating 
physician, but sites were encouraged to prioritize titration of neurohormonal antagonists 
over diuretics unless there was clinical evidence of congestion or volume overload. Patients 
randomized to the NT-proBNP-guided group used local laboratory NT-proBNP 
measurements to make decisions about titration of HF therapy. All patients in either group 
also had blinded NT-proBNP concentrations measured in a core laboratory at each study 
visit. For patients in either group, investigators were provided with the most recent 
American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) practice

 guidelines for the management of HF and specific information on target doses of proven 
medical therapies. After an initial visit at 2 and 6 weeks, visits occurred every 3 months 
throughout the remainder of the study. After therapy adjustment for HF (whether driven by 
NT-proBNP levels or clinical reasons), patients had a 2-week follow-up visit for 
reassessment.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of time-to-first HF hospitalization or death from 
cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, total 
hospitalizations for HF, days alive and not hospitalized for cardiovascular reasons, the 
individual components on the primary endpoint, health related quality of life, resource 
utilization, costs, cost effectiveness, and safety. Results of the economic and quality of life 
analyses are not reported in this article. Adjudication of all deaths and hospitalizations was 
carried out by a blinded clinical endpoint committee according to pre-specified criteria. We 
predefined four adverse events of interest that might be anticipated to occur more frequently 
with more aggressive HF treatment: symptomatic hypotension, symptomatic bradycardia, 
hyperkalemia, and worsening renal function.
Statistical Analysis
A total sample size of 1,100 patients (550 per group) was expected to provide approximately 
90% power to detect a difference in the primary endpoint with an assumed type I error rate 
of 0.05 two-sided. We estimated that the annual event rate for the composite endpoint would 
be 40% in the usual care group. We targeted a 20% decrease in the primary endpoint at 12 
months for the biomarker-guided group in the sample size calculation, based on the 
recognition that this treatment effect would be consistent with other effective heart failure 
therapies that have been incorporated into clinical practice.17 According to protocol, all 
patients were to be followed for between 12 and 24 months after randomization (the last 
patient enrolled to be followed for 12 months). For the analysis of the primary endpoint, the 
adjusted hazard ratio would be adjusted for 5 prespecified baseline covariates—age, sex, 
ejection fraction, NT-proBNP level, and the presence of diabetes mellitus—within the Cox 
regression model. For missing baseline categorical variables, we imputed the most common 
value. For missing baseline NT-proBNP values, we utilized the NT-proBNP value from 
screening. For missing baseline ejection fraction values, we imputed the population median. 
We also performed the primary endpoint analysis with site as a random effect as a sensitivity 
analysis. We tested for heterogeneity of effect on the primary endpoint by testing for 
interactions within a number of subgroups defined by demographics and baseline 
characteristics (see Online Supplement). A subgroup analysis based on age (≥ 75 years vs. < 
75 years) was prespecified based on prior data suggesting biomarker guided therapy was 
more effective in younger patients.9 For secondary analyses, inverse probability weighting 
was used to estimate mean days alive out of the hospital using the Bang-Tsiatis partitioned 
estimator.18 The total number of recurrent HF hospitalizations by treatment group was 
modelled using the Andersen-Gill intensity model.19 All analyses were based on the 
principle of intention to treat. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. The threshold for 
statistical significance was 2 sided with a Type 1 error rate of 0.05. There was no adjustment

 performed for multiple comparisons and thus secondary outcomes were considered 
exploratory.
Results
Study Patients
A total of 894 patients were enrolled at 45 sites in the United States and Canada between 
January 2013 and July 2016 (Figure 1). The groups were generally well balanced with 
respect to baseline characteristics (Table 1). The study enrolled patients with high-risk HF, 
as characterized by a low ejection fraction (median 25%), significantly elevated NT-proBNP 
(median 2,653 pg/mL), and a history of prior HF hospitalization (or equivalent) in the past 
year. Most patients were receiving recommended pharmacologic therapy for chronic heart 
failure at baseline. The median-follow up time for all patients was 15 months. Missing data 
for the 5 prespecified adjustment covariates was rare (none for age or sex, 1 for diabetes 
mellitus, 14 for baseline NT-proBNP, and 12 for ejection fraction).
At the regularly scheduled DSMB meeting on July 8, 2016, at which time about 50% of 
planned primary endpoint events had occurred, the study met prespecified inefficacy criteria 
and the DSMB made a recommendation to the NHLBI to discontinue the study due to lack 
of efficacy evidence for the biomarker-guided treatment group compared to usual care. The 
NHLBI accepted this recommendation and enrollment was discontinued after 894 patients 
had been enrolled (81% of planned enrollment). Final study visits for all patients still 
actively participating in the trial were completed prior to database lock.
Medical Treatment by Strategy and Follow-up
Patients randomized to the biomarker-guided strategy had a greater number of study clinic 
visits (median 12 vs. 10, Wilcoxon p=0.002) and more adjustments to HF therapy (median 6 
vs. 4, Wilcoxon p<0.001) compared to patients randomized to usual care. Over the course of 
the study, there was modest intensification of HF therapy in both groups, without statistically 
significant differences between those randomized to NT-proBNP-guided therapy or usual 
care (Table 2).
Study Outcomes
The composite endpoint of first hospitalization for HF or death from a cardiovascular cause 
occurred in 164 patients (37%) in the biomarker-guided group and 164 patients (37%) in the 
usual care group with 12-month Kaplan-Meier event rates of 33.8% and 36.0%, respectively 
and a treatment difference of −2.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] −9.1% to 4.6%). After 
adjustment for prespecified covariates, the adjusted hazard ratio for the primary endpoint 
was 0.98 (95% CI 0.79 – 1.22, p=0.88) (Figure 2). These results were not significantly 
changed by including site as a random effect (HR=0.99, 95% CI 0.79 – 1.23, p=0.92). Data 
for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, HF hospitalization, and all-cause 
hospitalization were also not significantly different between treatment groups (Table 3). 
Death occurred in 66 patients (15%) in the biomarker-guided group and 77 (17%) in the 
usual care group. The 12-month Kaplan-Meier event rates for all-cause mortality were 9.8% 
for biomarker-guided and 14.1% in the usual-care group for a treatment difference of −4.3%

 (95% CI −8.9% to 0.3%). After adjustment for the pre-specified covariates, the adjusted 
hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.86 (95% CI 0.62 – 1.20; p=0.37).
There was generally no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect in a number of 
prespecified and post-hoc subgroups (eFigure 1). Changes in the concentrations of NT-
proBNP (based on blinded central core lab data) decreased over time in both groups and 
were not significantly different between groups; at 12 months, median NT-proBNP had 
decreased from a median of 2,568 to 1,209 pg/mL (53% decrease) in the biomarker-guided 
group, and from a median of 2,678 to 1,397 pg/mL (48% decrease) in the usual care group 
(Figure 3). The proportion of patients in both groups achieving the target value of NT-
proBNP <1,000 pg/mL at 12 months was 46% for biomarker-guided group vs. 40% for usual 
care group (p=0.21).
Adverse Events
The rates of the predefined adverse events of interest (i.e., symptomatic hypotension, 
symptomatic bradycardia, hyperkalemia, and worsening renal function) were generally low 
and similar between the groups (eTable 1).
Discussion
The primary finding of this study is that in high-risk patients with HFrEF, a strategy of 
guiding therapy based on concentrations of NT-proBNP was not more effective than a usual 
care strategy in reducing the composite endpoint of time-to-first HF hospitalization or 
cardiovascular death. Similarly not significantly different results were seen in other clinical 
endpoints. Although there were more adjustments to therapy in the biomarker-guided group, 
neither doses of guideline-directed medical therapy, the achieved NT-proBNP 
concentrations, nor clinical outcomes were significantly different between the treatment 
groups.
These results differ from other data, including a recent comprehensive patient-level meta-
analysis of data from 2,431 patients from 11 trials which showed a reduction in all-cause 
mortality with natriuretic peptide-guided therapy compared to usual care (hazard ratio = 
0.62).13 A consistent feature of other studies in which natriuretic peptide-guided therapy was 
shown to be effective was the differential utilization of neurohormonal therapies as well as a 
separation of achieved natriuretic peptide concentrations between the two study groups. The 
up-titration of medical therapy in the NT-proBNP group in this study was substantially less 
than that seen in some smaller studies of biomarker-guided therapy. For example, a 
randomized study of 278 patients in eight Austrian hospitals achieved 100% of angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) target doses and 
77% of beta-blocker target doses in patients randomized to biomarker-guided therapy, which 
was accompanied by a substantial reduction in HF events.10 Although it is challenging to 
compare across studies, the achieved dosing of these classes of drugs in the NT-proBNP-
guided group was substantially less in this study (55% for ACE/ARB and 48% for beta-
blockers at 12 months, Table 2). Whether the lack of up-titration of medical therapy 
observed in this study was related to patient characteristics (e.g., inability to up-titrate due to 
azotemia or hypotension) or physician behavior (e.g., unwillingness to up-titrate due to

 concern over adverse effects) in not clear from these data. This study enrolled patients with 
high-risk features (elevated natriuretic peptide levels within the prior 30 days and an HF 
event within the prior 12 months) and allowed a broad range of renal function, resulting in a 
study population with relatively advanced HF compared to most other clinical trials in 
ambulatory patients with HFrEF. By way of comparison, the median baseline NT-proBNP 
value in this study (2,607 pg/mL) was 1.6 fold that of patients enrolled in the Prospective 
Comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in 
Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) study of sacubitril/valsartan17 and 3.2 fold that of patients 
enrolled in the Heart Failure and a Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise 
Training (HF-ACTION) study.20 Patients with more severe HF such as those in this study 
may have more limitations to intensification of HF therapy, in particular hypotension and 
azotemia, which may have limited this ability to aggressively up-titrate medical therapy in 
the guided therapy group in response to above target NT-proBNP levels.
Another potential difference between this study and other data may relate to difference in the 
control group. In the single center ProBNP Outpatient Tailored Chronic HF Therapy 
(PROTECT) study, patients randomized to biomarker-guided therapy achieved a 44% 
decrease in the NT-proBNP level over time (compared to a 5% decrease in the usual care 
group), which was associated with a significant improvement in clinical outcomes for those 
patients randomized to the NT-proBNP-guided strategy.8 By contrast, in the current trial, 
both the decrease in NT-proBNP concentrations (Figure 3) and the proportion of patients in 
each group who reached the target NT-proBNP value of <1,000 pg/mL (46% vs. 40%) were 
not significantly different between the groups. This suggests that a key difference between 
this study and PROTECT may be in the usual care group rather than the NT-proBNP-guided 
treatment group. Patients enrolled in the usual care group of the this study had relatively 
frequent study-related clinic visits (median 10 visits over 15 months of follow-up) and 
adjustments to HF therapy (median of 4 adjustments), which represents a greater intensity of 
care (more akin to a disease management program) than would typically occur in routine 
clinical practice. Whether this frequency of clinical contact affected outcomes through 
mechanisms other than medication titration (e.g., by earlier detection and intervention on 
heart failure decompensation) is unknown. Although this study included both academic and 
community sites, the majority of this study sites had substantial focus and expertise in HF 
care which may have tended to lessen differences in the optimization of evidenced-based HF 
therapies between the study groups.
Limitations
This study has several important limitations. First, given the nature of the study intervention, 
the study was unblinded, which could be a potential source of bias. The design was based on 
an objective primary endpoint (cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization) that 
was adjudicated by a clinical events committee blinded to the treatment assignment in order 
to mitigate this bias. Second, although the study protocol discouraged measurement of NT-
proBNP in patients in the usual care group, some patients may have had NT-proBNP levels 
assessed at non-study sites or by non-study clinicians, which may have served to diminish 
the difference between study groups. Finally, patients in both groups had more frequent

 clinical encounters than would typically occur in clinical practice, which may have 
influenced the results.
Conclusions
In high-risk patients with HFrEF, a strategy of NT-proBNP-guided therapy was not more 
effective than a usual care strategy in improving outcomes.

 Key Points
Question
Does a strategy of titrating therapy to a specific NT-proBNP target improve clinical 
outcomes in high-risk patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction?
Findings
In this randomized clinical trial including 894 adults, a strategy of NT-proBNP-guided 
therapy compared with usual care did not significantly improve time to first 
hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98).
Meaning
These findings do not support NT-proBNP-guided therapy for management of heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction.
