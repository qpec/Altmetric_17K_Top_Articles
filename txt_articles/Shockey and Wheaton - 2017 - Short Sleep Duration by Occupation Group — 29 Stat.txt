The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep 
Research Society have determined that adults require ≥7 hours 
of sleep per day to promote optimal health (1). Short sleep 
duration (<7 hours per day) has been linked to adverse health 
outcomes including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, 
depression, and anxiety, as well as safety issues related to drowsy 
driving and injuries (1,2). Additional research has found that 
sleep duration varies by characteristics such as race, education, 
marital status, obesity, and cigarette smoking (3). Work-related 
factors such as job stress, work hours, shift work, and physically 
demanding work have been found to be associated with sleep 
duration and quality (4–6). All of these work factors vary by 
industry and occupation of employment, and the prevalence of 
short sleep duration has been shown to vary by broad industry 
and occupation category (7). To provide updated and more 
detailed information about which occupation groups have the 
highest prevalences of short sleep duration, CDC analyzed 
data from currently employed adults surveyed for the 2013 
and 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 
in 29 states. Among 22 major occupation groups, the highest 
prevalences of short sleep duration were among workers in 
the following five groups: Production (42.9%), Healthcare 
Support (40.1%), Healthcare Practitioners and Technical 
(40.0%), Food Preparation and Serving-Related (39.8%), and 
Protective Service (39.2%). The significant differences among 
occupation groups in the prevalence of short sleep duration 
suggest that work-related factors should be further evaluated 
as they might relate to sleep.
BRFSS is an annual, random-digit–dialed telephone survey 
of noninstitutionalized, U.S. civilian residents aged ≥18 years. 
It is conducted by U.S. states and territories to gather data on 
health-related risk behaviors, chronic illnesses and conditions, 
and use of health-related services.* The BRFSS questionnaire 
is composed of a set of core questions that are asked by all 
states; in addition, states may choose from optional modules 
on specific subjects or include state-added questions. Twenty-
nine states† administered the optional industry and occupation 
module in 2013 or 2014. Response rates for BRFSS are cal-
culated based on American Association of Public Opinion 
Research guidelines. The median response rate for all states, 
territories, and the District of Columbia was 46.4% in 2013 
and 47.0% in 2014, whereas the response rates for states 
included in analyses ranged from 31.1% to 59.2% in 2013 
and from 33.0% to 57.6% in 2014.§
To determine occupation, BRFSS participants who were 
employed for wages, self-employed, or out of work for <1 year 
were asked, “What kind of work do you do?” Participants’ 
responses were recorded as free text and later coded to one of 
the 574 U.S. Bureau of Census (2002) occupation numeric 
codes¶ by an auto-coding system or computer-assisted human 
coders. Because of the difficulty in reporting results for such 
a large number of occupations, and to protect participants’ 
privacy, the 574 Bureau of Census codes were grouped into 93 
two-digit detailed occupation groups used by CDC’s National 
Center for Health Statistics to code occupations for the 
National Health Interview Survey,** and these detailed groups 
were collapsed into the 22 two-digit Standard Occupational 
Classification System major occupation groups created by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics.†† Respondents also were asked, “On 
average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour 
period?” Responses to this question were dichotomized into 
≥7 hours of sleep (sufficient sleep) and <7 hours of sleep (short 
sleep duration).
Among the 412,829 BRFSS participants in 2013 and 2014, 
a total of 207,143 (50.2%) were currently employed for wages, 
self-employed, or out of work for <1 year and were considered 
for analyses. After excluding 523 respondents (0.3%) who 
were on active military duty, 249 (0.1%) who were unpaid or 
retired workers, and 26,750 (12.9%) with insufficient or miss-
ing information necessary for occupational coding, the final 
sample for analyses totaled 179,621 (86.7% of the currently 
employed respondents). Prevalence of short sleep duration 
was calculated by the 22 major and 93 detailed occupation 
groups and adjusted for the following characteristics: age group 
(18–34 years, 35–44 years, 45–54 years, 55–64 years, and 
≥65 years); sex (male or female); race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic

other race or multiracial); marital status (married/member of 
an unmarried couple or divorced/widowed/separated/never 
married); and education level (less than high school diploma, 
graduated high school, some college, or college graduate). 
The adjusted prevalence estimates were obtained using logis-
tic regression. F tests were used as a measure of association to 
determine statistical significance of the variables. All analyses 
were weighted to account for the survey design unless other-
wise noted.
Overall, 36.5% of currently employed adults reported 
short sleep duration. The prevalence of short sleep duration 
among persons in the three youngest age groups was similar 
(18–34 years [37.7%], 35–44 years [37.6%], and 45–54 years 
[37.4%]) and lower among persons in the two oldest age groups 
(45-64 years [33.8%] and ≥65 years [29.2%]). Among persons 
categorized by other characteristics, the highest prevalences 
were reported by men (37.5%), non-Hispanic blacks (48.5%), 
persons with some college education (40.0%), and persons 
who were divorced, widowed, separated or never married 
(39.5%) (Table 1).
Among the 22 major occupation groups, the highest preva-
lences of short sleep duration were among workers in the fol-
lowing five groups: Production (42.9%), Healthcare Support 
(40.1%), Healthcare Practitioners and Technical (40.0%), 
Food Preparation and Serving-Related (39.8%), and Protective 
Service (39.2%). The two major occupation groups with the 
lowest prevalence of short sleep duration were Education, 
Training, and Library and Farming, Fishing, and Forestry 
(both 31.3%) (Table 2).
Within the Protective Service major occupation group, 
the highest prevalence of short sleep duration was reported 
in the detailed group of firefighting and prevention workers 
(45.8%). Within the Healthcare Support major group, the 
highest prevalences were reported in the detailed group of 
nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides (43.3%). Among 
all major occupation groups, the detailed groups with the high-
est prevalences of short sleep duration were communications 
equipment operators (58.2%), other transportation workers 
(54.0%), and rail transportation workers (52.7%). The detailed 
groups with the lowest prevalences of short sleep duration 
were air transportation workers (21.4%) and religious workers 
(22.4%) (Table 2).
For the 29 states, the weighted percentage of currently 
employed adults in any of the five major occupation groups 
with the highest prevalence of short sleep duration also 
was calculated. Among the states, the percentage of cur-
rently employed adults working in any of the five major 
occupation groups with the highest prevalence of short 
sleep duration ranged from 17.6% (Wyoming) to 26.8% 
(Mississippi) (Table 3).
Discussion
This study is the first to evaluate short sleep duration by 93 
detailed occupation groups and at a multistate level. A previ-
ous study using National Health Interview Survey data found 
that within certain industries, production and transportation 
and material moving occupations had among the highest 
prevalences of short sleep duration, a finding that is consistent 
with the results of this study (7). Previous studies have shown 
that shift workers are more likely to experience disturbed sleep 
and excessive sleepiness, and to report a significantly higher 
prevalence of short sleep duration compared with day work-
ers (6,8). Shift work negatively influences health, by affecting 
the natural circadian rhythm, leading to irregularities in the 
sleep-wake cycle (8). The five major occupation groups with 
the highest prevalence of short sleep duration (Production, 
Healthcare Support, Healthcare Practitioners and Technical, 
Food Preparation and Serving-Related, and Protective Service) 
also have some of the highest prevalence rates of alternative 
shift work, ranging from >35% of Healthcare Practitioners and 
Technical workers to >50% of Food Preparation and Serving-
Related workers (9).
Respondents working in detailed occupation groups within 
the major occupation group of Transportation and Material 
Moving reported a wide range in prevalences of short sleep 
duration, from air transportation workers (21%) to other 
transportation workers (54%). In 2011, the Federal Aviation 
Administration overhauled commercial airline pilot schedul-
ing to ensure that pilots are rested before flying; this might 
account for the low prevalence of short sleep duration among 
air transportation workers.§§ In contrast, 53% of rail trans-
portation workers reported short sleep duration. Although 
the Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated 
changes to the limitations on the number of hours railroad 
employees work, compliance with the bill is not required 
until 2018.¶¶ Shift work and existing occupational regula-
tions likely are important factors to consider regarding the 
results of this study.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, because BRFSS data are cross-sectional, it is not 
possible to determine temporal relationships. Second, BRFSS 
data are self-reported, and are therefore subject to recall and 
social desirability biases. Among certain occupations where 
sleep duration has been an issue and hours might be specified 
by regulation (e.g., transportation), there might be a greater 
sensitivity to this question and a bias toward reporting suf-
ficient sleep. Third, because the data came from 29 states, the

results might not be representative of the national currently 
employed population. Finally, misclassification of occupa-
tion by respondents, interviewers or coders, although likely 
rare, is possible.
Short sleep duration among the U.S. working population 
has been estimated to result in a $411 billion dollar annual 
cost to the economy, equivalent to 2.28% of the country’s 
gross domestic product (10). In addition, among employed 
persons, 1.2 million working days are lost in the United

* To determine occupation, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System participants who were employed for wages, self-employed, or out of work for <1 year were asked, “What kind of work 
do you do?” Participants’ responses were recorded as free text and later coded to one of the 574 U.S. Bureau of Census (2002) occupation numeric codes by an auto-coding system or 
computer-assisted human coders. Because of the difficulty in reporting results for such a large number of occupations, and to protect participants’ privacy, the 574 Bureau of Census codes 
were grouped into 93 two-digit detailed occupation groups used by CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics to code occupations for the National Health Interview Survey, and these 
detailed groups were collapsed into the 22 two-digit SOC major occupation groups created by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Respondents also were asked, “On average, how many hours 
of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period?” Responses to this question were dichotomized into ≥7 hours of sleep (sufficient sleep) and <7 hours of sleep (short sleep duration).
† Adjusted by sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, age group, and education level.
§ Estimates were suppressed because they did not meet the statistical reliability standards of BRFSS (i.e., cell size was <50 participants or CV >0.30).

States each year because of sleep deprivation. It is estimated 
that if persons who sleep <6 hours per day began sleeping 
for 6–7 hours per day, approximately $226 billion could be 
added to the U.S. economy (10). A goal of Healthy People 
2020 is to “increase public knowledge of how adequate sleep 
and treatment of sleep disorders improve health, productiv-
ity, wellness, quality of life, and safety on roads and in the 
workplace,” with a specific objective to increase the propor-
tion of adults getting sufficient sleep.***
CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health has developed educational resources on shift work 
and long working hours for managers, workers, and the 
public.††† The materials include interactive training for 
nurses, emergency responders, and truck drivers, as well as 
information for aviation and railroad employees, methods for 
improving shiftwork schedules, and individual coping strate-
gies. Time at work continues to increase, with the United 
States having the longest annual working hours among all 
wealthy industrialized countries (7). Job characteristics, 
such as schedules, stress, and physical output, should be 
evaluated in an effort to improve worker sleep duration and 
overall health.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Shift work and other work factors influence sleep duration and 
sleep quality, which have a direct effect on worker health and 
safety. Previous research has found that workers in production, 
health care, protective service, transportation and material 
moving, and food preparation and serving-related fields are 
more likely to be shift workers. In addition, production and 
transportation and material moving occupations have been 
associated with higher prevalences of short sleep duration.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of 2013 and 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System data conducted to examine 93 detailed occupation groups 
in 29 states found that the prevalence of <7 hours of sleep per day 
(short sleep duration) ranged from 21.4% among air transportation 
workers to 58.2% among communications equipment workers. 
The percentage of workers employed in at least one of the five 
occupations with the highest prevalence of short sleep duration 
ranged from 17.6% in Wyoming to 26.8% in Mississippi.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Significant differences were found in the prevalence of short 
sleep duration among occupation groups. Workers in occupa-
tions with high prevalences of short sleep duration might be 
most at risk for sleep-related accidents and adverse health 
outcomes associated with short sleep duration. Work-related 
factors should be further evaluated in the context of short sleep 
duration to guide prevention efforts.
