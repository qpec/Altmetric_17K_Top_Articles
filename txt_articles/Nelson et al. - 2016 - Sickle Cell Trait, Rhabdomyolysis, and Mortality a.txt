Abstract
Background—Studies have suggested that sickle cell trait elevates the risks of exertional 
rhabdomyolysis and death. We conducted a study of sickle cell trait in relation to these outcomes, 
controlling for known risk factors for exertional rhabdomyolysis, in a large population of active 
persons who had undergone laboratory tests for hemoglobin AS (HbAS) and who were subject to 
exertional-injury precautions.
Methods—We used Cox proportional-hazards models to test whether the risks of exertional 
rhabdomyolysis and death varied according to sickle cell trait status among 47,944 black soldiers 
who had undergone testing for HbAS and who were on active duty in the U.S. Army between 
January 2011 and December 2014. We used the Stanford Military Data Repository, which contains 
comprehensive medical and administrative data on all active-duty soldiers.
Results—There was no significant difference in the risk of death among soldiers with sickle cell 
trait, as compared with those without the trait (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.46 to 2.13; P = 0.97), but the trait was associated with a significantly higher adjusted risk of 
exertional rhabdomyolysis (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.12; P = 0.008). This effect was 
similar in magnitude to that associated with tobacco use, as compared with no use (hazard ratio, 
1.54; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.94; P<0.001), and to that associated with having a body-mass index (BMI; 
the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30.0 or more, as 
compared with a BMI of less than 25.0 (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.86; P = 0.03). The 
effect was less than that associated with recent use of a statin, as compared with no use (hazard

CI, 1.34 to 6.82; P = 0.008).
Conclusions—Sickle cell trait was not associated with a higher risk of death than absence of the 
trait, but it was associated with a significantly higher risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis. (Funded 
by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Uniformed Services University of the 
Health Sciences.)
Exertional rhabdomyolysis is characterized by the severe breakdown of skeletal-muscle 
tissue that is precipitated by strenuous physical exertion, leading to systemic manifestations 
that typically include myoglobinuria. This syndrome has received considerable attention 
because of high-profile deaths involving exertional rhabdomyolysis in athletes and military 
personnel.1-10 A number of such cases have been attributed to sickle cell trait,11-15 a 
condition in which persons are heterozygous for the sickle cell mutation in the beta-globin 
gene. The beta-globin protein forms part of the tetrameric hemoglobin complex; 
heterozygous persons have wild-type hemoglobin A as well as hemoglobin S, hence the term 
hemoglobin AS (HbAS). Sickle cell trait is most prevalent among persons with African 
ancestry. An estimated 7.3% of blacks, 0.7% of Hispanics, and 1.6% of U.S. residents 
overall have sickle cell trait.16
Two previous population-based studies of sickle cell trait and adverse outcomes showed 
substantially higher risks (by a factor of 20 to 30) of sudden, unexplained deaths among 
black military recruits15 and of exertion-related deaths among black football players 
participating on National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 teams.17 
However, these studies did not include the sickle cell trait status of the total population 
studied or the longitudinal capture of participants' health histories. The need for population-
based research on the effect of sickle cell trait in highly physically active groups that have 
been tested for HbAS has long been expressed,18,19 but such research has not been 
conducted because of the lack of suitable databases.
Consequently, many organizations proceed with caution regarding the potential for exertion-
related events among persons with sickle cell trait who are exposed to demanding physical 
training (e.g., military service members and athletes). The NCAA and the U.S. Air Force 
and Navy use universal screening for sickle cell trait.19 However, concerns have been raised 
by the American Society of Hematology and other professional organizations about the 
possibility of stigmatization and discrimination resulting from the mandated screening for 
sickle cell trait.20-23 These concerns warrant consideration, especially given the absence of 
published evidence that such screening is effective in preventing exertion-related events.
The U.S. Army has primarily used screening for sickle cell trait in situations of combat 
deployment and specific occupational specialties involving high altitude.24 At present, there 
is no special recognition or handling of soldiers with sickle cell trait before or during 
physical activity. Instead, the Army uses universal precautions to reduce the risks of 
dehydration and heat-induced and exercise-induced illness among all its soldiers (Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).24,25 
Such measures have been shown to be effective in reducing the rates of exercise-related 
death, regardless of status with respect to sickle cell trait.26

 We conducted an analysis involving HbAS-tested soldiers who served between 2011 and 
2014 to quantify the associations between sickle cell trait and mortality and between sickle 
cell trait and the risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis in the context of mandated exertional-
injury precautions. Because sickle cell trait is most prevalent among persons with African 
ancestry, this analysis focused on black soldiers.
Methods
Study Design
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Stanford Military Data Repository 
(SMDR). The SMDR comprises all digitally recorded health encounters (inpatient and 
outpatient; within military facilities or purchased from civilian institutions) for all active-
duty soldiers in the U.S. Army. These health-encounter data have been combined with 
administrative, health-related, physical-performance, and mortality data from distinct official 
sources (Table 1). All the data were deidentified for research purposes by the Army Office of 
the Surgeon General. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Stanford 
University and by the Human Research Protection Office of the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Health Affairs and the Defense Health Agency.
Study Population
Eligible participants were black soldiers who served on active duty in the U.S. Army for any 
part of the study observation period (January 2011 through December 2014) and who had 
undergone testing for HbAS before or during this period. We obtained test results directly 
from laboratory findings in the electronic health records for the participants. Persons who 
reported their race as “black or African American” were identified from official personnel 
records. Soldiers from the National Guard and the Army Reserve were not included in the 
database. The resulting population consisted of 47,944 persons. Universal precautions, 
including primary and secondary prevention measures, were used throughout the Army 
during this time (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).24,25
Study Outcomes
Exertional rhabdomyolysis and death were the main outcomes of interest. We initially 
identified the first occurrence of exertional rhabdomyolysis by the assignment of the 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) 
code for rhabdomyolysis (728.88) or myoglobinuria (791.3). These diagnoses originated 
from data in the patients' electronic health records, which include information on inpatient or 
outpatient care that was delivered inside or outside the military health system.
To ensure that events during the study period most likely constituted rhabdomyolysis with an 
exertional cause, we excluded cases that were due to a drug-toxicity event or to tissue 
trauma. ICD-9-CM codes for diagnoses of toxic events or of trauma to an extremity or the 
torso (injury and poisoning codes 800–999) that were recorded on the day of the 
rhabdomyolysis event, up to 2 days before, and up to 7 days afterward served as the primary 
exclusion criteria. However, we retained the following conditions in this code range that 
could plausibly occur in conjunction with an exertional event or were unlikely to

 independently precipitate nonexertional rhabdomyolysis: sprains and strains of joints and 
adjacent muscles (ICD-9-CM codes 840–848), superficial injuries (910–919), contusion of 
the eye and ocular adnexa (921), effects of a foreign body entering an orifice (930–939), 
effects of heat and light (992), effects of air pressure (993), effects of thirst (994.3), 
exhaustion due to exposure (994.4), exhaustion due to excessive exertion (994.5), motion 
sickness (994.6), adult emotional or psychological abuse (995.82), and adult sexual abuse 
(995.83).
An additional criterion that we used to rule out cases that were likely to be nonexertional 
cases was the presence of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) standardized 
agreement (STANAG) codes, which may indicate a specific traumatic or toxicity-related 
reason for military health care. However, events with the following specific codes were 
retained as being possibly related to exertional events: athletics and sports including physical 
training (STANAG codes 200–249) and specified environmental factors, including in natural 
and artificial environments (STANAG codes 800–899).
Deaths were determined with the use of data from the Defense Manpower Data Center, 
which maintains official records of deaths among soldiers. Deaths were coded in the original 
data as battle-related or non–battle-related. We modeled against three mortality outcomes: 
overall mortality, battle-related mortality, and non–battle-related mortality.
Independent Variables
The main independent predictor of interest, sickle cell trait, was a binary variable that was 
based on laboratory-confirmed tests of the hemoglobin AS phenotype. We controlled for sex 
and age. A high level of physical fitness, as indicated by a score of 270 or more on the most 
recent Army Physical Fitness Test (with scores ranging from 0 to 300, and higher scores 
indicating better fitness) was included to control for physical conditioning.27
The analysis included the participants' most recent body-mass index category according to 
standard classifications.28 Participants with a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 25.0 to 29.9 were categorized as 
overweight, and those with a BMI of 30.0 or more were categorized as obese. All other 
participants were included in the reference group, which consisted mainly of persons with 
normal BMI (18.5 to <25.0); fewer than 2% of the study participants were underweight 
(BMI, <18.5) or had missing data for BMI.
We also included any self-reported tobacco use during the previous 6 months as a predictor 
for each participant, and this information was updated monthly during each participant's 
time at risk. In addition, three binary covariates indicated the presence of at least one 
dispensed prescription in either the observed or the previous month for statins, antipsychotic 
agents, or stimulants, given their previously reported associations with rhabdomyolysis.29,30 
These factors were also updated throughout each participant's time at risk.
Statistical Analysis
The observational unit for the longitudinal-panel data set was the person-month. For new 
soldiers, the time at risk for exertional rhabdomyolysis began at the initial entry to military

 service during the study period, given that a history of exertional rhabdomyolysis 
disqualifies a person from induction into the armed forces.24
The time at risk for exertional rhabdomyolysis for those soldiers who had entered the Army 
before January 2011 began at the earliest annual physical examination without a diagnosis of 
exertional rhabdomyolysis. Among experienced soldiers with no record of physical 
examinations, time at risk began in June 2011, the sixth observed month. Soldiers were 
excluded if exertional rhabdomyolysis or any notations of duty restrictions that were due to 
exertion-related problems occurred during that initial 6-month period. After the time at risk 
began, data from participants with an outcome during the study were censored at the time of 
the event. Otherwise, data were censored either at the participants' exit from the study 
population due to the end of military service or at the end of the observation period in the 
study.
We used a multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression model to estimate adjusted 
hazard ratios for each covariate. Two sensitivity analyses were performed. In the first, we 
included an interaction term to test whether the association between sickle cell trait and 
exertional rhabdomyolysis varied between new soldiers and those who were more 
experienced. In the second, we tested whether the inclusion of duration of service affected 
the association between sickle cell trait and exertional rhabdomyolysis. All the statistical 
analyses were conducted with the use of Stata software, version 13 (StataCorp).
Results
Associations of Sex and Age with Exertional Rhabdomyolysis
We observed 391 exertional rhabdomyolysis events during the 1.61 million person-months 
contributed by the 47,944 participants (Table 2). Women were at substantially lower risk for 
exertional rhabdomyolysis than were men (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.38 to 0.67; P<0.001) (Table 3). We observed a progressive increase in risk that was 
associated with increasing age, including a 57% higher risk among soldiers 36 years of age 
or older than among those in the lowest age category (hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.06 to 
2.32; P = 0.02).
Associations of Modifiable Risk Factors with Exertional Rhabdomyolysis
With regard to modifiable risk factors, we observed that the risk of exertional 
rhabdomyolysis was significantly higher among obese persons than among persons with in 
the reference BMI category (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.86; P = 0.03) (Table 3). 
Similarly, a report of tobacco use in the previous 6 months was associated with a risk of 
exertional rhabdomyolysis that was 54% higher than that associated with no tobacco use 
(hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.94; P<0.001). Recent use of an antipsychotic 
medication was associated with a tripling of the risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis, as 
compared with no use of antipsychotic medication (hazard ratio, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.34 to 6.82; 
P = 0.008). Recent statin use was associated with a near-tripling of the risk of exertional 
rhabdomyolysis, as compared with no statin use (hazard ratio, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.51 to 5.55; P 
= 0.001).

 Association of Sickle Cell Trait with Exertional Rhabdomyolysis
Participants with sickle cell trait made up 7.4% of the study population and were broadly 
similar to participants without sickle cell trait in terms of demographic characteristics and 
health predictors (Table 2). The presence of sickle cell trait was associated with an adjusted 
risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis that was 54% higher than that associated with the absence 
of the trait (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.12; P = 0.008) (Table 3).
Association of Sickle Cell Trait with Death
We observed 96 deaths from all causes among the study participants (Table 2). There was no 
significant difference in the risk of death among soldiers with sickle cell trait, as compared 
with those without the trait (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.46 to 2.13, P = 0.97) (Table 4). 
Nearly identical hazard ratios were observed for battle-related deaths and non–battle-related 
deaths. Seven deaths occurred among participants with sickle cell trait, one of which was 
classified as battle-related. A review of the records for the six participants with sickle cell 
trait who died from non–battle-related causes indicated diverse medical histories, including 
cancer, substance abuse, mental disorders, heart disease, and postoperative complications. 
One death was observed among the soldiers who had exertional rhabdomyolysis; this death 
occurred in a participant without sickle cell trait.
Discussion
In this population-based study involving black soldiers who had undergone testing for HbAS 
and were subject to exertional-injury precautions, sickle cell trait was not associated with a 
higher overall risk of death, although it was associated with a significantly higher adjusted 
risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis. Other factors were of similar or greater concern in the 
assessments of the risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis. For example, obesity and tobacco use 
were each associated with a significantly higher risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis, and the 
magnitude of the risk was similar to that associated with the presence of sickle cell trait. A 
recent prescription of an antipsychotic or statin medication was associated with an 
approximate tripling of the risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis in this study population, as 
compared with no use of the specified medications.
These findings are compelling because case reports dominate the relevant literature and 
emphasize the presence of sickle cell trait as a risk factor for adverse outcomes, including 
exertional rhabdomyolysis and sudden death.9,11-13,31-35 A large, longitudinal study 
involving a population fully tested for HbAS that has formally investigated the relationship 
between the presence of sickle cell trait and exertional rhabdomyolysis or death while also 
examining other known, major risk factors such as use of medications has been lacking.
One strength of our study is that the hemoglobin type of each participant in the analytic 
study population was confirmed by laboratory results rather than by self-report or medical 
history. The inclusion in our analysis of only participants with verified laboratory results 
enabled the accurate estimation of the risks of exertional rhabdomyolysis and death among 
persons with sickle cell trait and among those without sickle cell trait. By contrast, other 
population-based studies of sickle cell trait in relation to sudden, nontraumatic, or exertion-

 related death attempted to assess the hemoglobin types only of participants with the outcome 
event with certainty.15,17,36,37 Among participants in these studies without the outcomes of 
interest (i.e., sudden, nontraumatic, or exertion-related death), inferences about the expected 
proportion with sickle cell trait were made from population average values.
Additional strengths of our study were the inclusion of a very large number of black 
soldiers, precision with regard to the nature of the exertional rhabdomyolysis outcome, and 
the ability to control for a wide range of confounders. Finally, our data reflect recent 
conditions in the U.S. Army, which has used universal precautions to mitigate heat- and 
exertion-related injuries since at least 2003.24,25
Men in the SMDR study population were found to have an adjusted risk of exertional 
rhabdomyolysis that was twice as high as that among women, a result that was similar to the 
findings of a recent report involving the total military population.38 In contrast to the 
findings of that report, however, the risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis increased with 
increasing age in our study population. This difference probably reflects the adjustments we 
made for other demographic, military, and health-related factors, some of which may be 
associated with both age and the risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis.
One plausible concern about this study was that participants with sickle cell trait who were 
prone to exertional rhabdomyolysis might have been medically discharged, which would 
have produced a selection bias effect. However, a sensitivity analysis showed no significant 
difference in the association between sickle cell trait and exertional rhabdomyolysis between 
new soldiers and those who were more experienced. An additional sensitivity analysis, 
including duration of service in the model to control for potential attrition-related selection 
effects, showed no resulting differences in the effect sizes for exertional rhabdomyolysis or 
death in the association with sickle cell trait. Finally, the age and rank distributions of 
participants with sickle cell trait and those without the trait were very similar (Table 2), 
which argues against any generalized selection effect.
The study has several limitations. First, not all black soldiers in the total Army population 
were tested for sickle cell trait. Testing in the Army takes place for diverse reasons. For 
example, in military-unit-readiness processing, hundreds or thousands of persons are tested 
at once. Testing also occurs at certain physical examinations as mandated by regulation, in 
addition to occurring because of sporadic clinical indications. Our analyses indicate that 
testing has not occurred differentially on the basis of either demographic characteristics or 
health-related factors (data not shown). Thus, there is no reason to expect systematic 
differences in the association between the presence of sickle cell trait and exertional 
rhabdomyolysis among persons who have been tested and those who have not been tested.
An additional limitation derives from the possibility that some soldiers in the study 
population may have had an exertional rhabdomyolysis event before January 2011. However, 
the eligibility criteria and careful selection of the start time for risk calculations were aimed 
at mitigating that concern. It is also possible that some cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis 
during the study observation period were not included in the soldier's electronic health 
record. However, the seriousness of the condition and the fact that the electronic health data

 included care in military and civilian institutions reduce the probability of this scenario. We 
acknowledge the general limitations of ICD-9-CM coding, which may be subject to clinician 
error and bias. We were not able to perform chart audits to examine coding fidelity. Finally, 
we did not explore the potential for alcohol use or other toxic events to compound an effect 
of sickle cell trait on the risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis or death.
In conclusion, we conducted a population-based, longitudinal study of sickle cell trait in 
relation to the risks of exertional rhabdomyolysis and death in a population that is known to 
engage consistently in regular and strenuous exercise while protected by exertional-injury 
precautions. It is not clear to what extent the precautionary measures might have influenced 
the occurrence of exertional rhabdomyolysis events. A significantly higher risk of exertional 
rhabdomyolysis was identified among black U.S. Army soldiers with sickle cell trait than 
among those without the trait. Similarly elevated risks of exertional rhabdomyolysis were 
observed in association with tobacco use and obesity, and stronger effects were observed in 
association with recent use of statins or antipsychotic agents. Mortality — overall, battle-
related, or non–battle-related — was not higher among participants with sickle cell trait than 
among those without the trait.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. The body-mass index (BMI) is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. All 
values that could vary over time were the values that were known for each participant in the last observed month before data censoring.
†Scores on the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) range from 0 to 300, with higher scores indicating better physical performance. A minimum 
score of 180 is ordinarily required to pass. Soldiers who have a score of 90 or greater in each of the three fitness categories (push-ups, sit-ups, and 
cardiovascular endurance) are awarded recognition for high fitness.25
