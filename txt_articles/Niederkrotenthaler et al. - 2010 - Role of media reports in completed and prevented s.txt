 Evidence suggests that there is an increase in suicides following
media reports of suicide, which is frequently referred to as
copycat behaviour or as the Werther effect,1 although the effect
size is smaller than for other psychosocial risk factors for suicide.2
The risk is thought to depend not only on reader characteristics,2,3
but also on media content.3–5 In order to promote safe media
content, the World Health Organization (WHO) and national
agencies have developed guidelines for the reporting of suicides.5,6
The guidelines list reporting characteristics that may either
prevent or trigger suicides, thus serving as educational material
for journalists and editors. But most of the recommendations
put forth in these guidelines have not yet been empirically tested.7
In particular, there is a lack of knowledge about protective
reporting characteristics, although the suicide-protective potential
of reporting of positive coping in adverse circumstances has been
discussed on a theoretical basis.6 Specifically, it has been found
that media items referring to suicidal ideation are associated with
a lower risk of a post-report increase in suicide than other media
items.4
In the present study, we performed a content analysis of
suicide-related media reports. To identify potentially protective
and harmful reporting characteristics we tested associations
between specific components of media reports, and also classes
of reports with similar reporting profiles, and short-term changes
in suicide rates. We hypothesised that changes in suicide rates
following the publication of media items would vary with the
circulation rates of the media items in the population. Based on
Papageno’s overcoming of a suicidal crisis in Mozart’s opera The
Magic Flute, we conceptualised any suicide-protective impact of
media reporting as a Papageno effect. In Mozart’s opera, Papageno
becomes suicidal upon fearing the loss of his beloved Papagena;
however, he refrains from suicide because of three boys who draw
his attention to alternative coping strategies.8,9
Method
Sample of media reports
We obtained all reports from the 11 largest Austrian nationwide
newspapers that included the term suicide between 1 January
and 30 June 2005 from the Austrian Press Agency. Each of these
newspapers has coverage rates exceeding 1% of the population.
Articles using ‘self-murder’ (original search term: selbstmord) or
‘free death’ (freitod) were also included, because of their frequent
use as German synonyms for suicide. The search yielded 1055
articles. We excluded items that used suicide only as a metaphor
(n = 92), were about suicide bombing (n = 381), mentioned
suicide briefly (550% of the article) but were on topics not
related to suicide (n = 113) or were located in the movie or
television listings or in the classified advertisements (n = 58).
The final sample comprised 497 items.
Content analysis of media items
Basic item characteristics
Several media reporting characteristics have previously been
shown to be associated with an increase in suicides. These
characteristics are: quantity of reporting;1,4 main focus of the
item;4 reported suicide method;10–12 prominence of the item;13
and fictionality of the item.14 These codes were conceptualised
as a code family ‘basic item characteristics’
. Each of the codes
comprised several subcodes that were defined in accordance with

Background
Media reporting of suicide has repeatedly been shown to
trigger suicidal behaviour. Few studies have investigated the
associations between specific media content and suicide
rates. Even less is known about the possible preventive
effects of suicide-related media content.
Aims
To test the hypotheses that certain media content is
associated with an increase in suicide, suggesting a so-called
Werther effect, and that other content is associated with a
decrease in suicide, conceptualised as a Papageno effect.
Further, to identify classes of media articles with similar
reporting profiles and to test for associations between these
classes and suicide.
Method
Content analysis and latent class analysis (LCA) of 497
suicide-related print media reports published in Austria
between 1 January and 30 June 2005. Ecological study to
identify associations between media item content and short-
term changes in suicide rates.
Results
Repetitive reporting of the same suicide and the reporting of
suicide myths were positively associated with suicide rates.
Coverage of individual suicidal ideation not accompanied by
suicidal behaviour was negatively associated with suicide
rates. The LCA yielded four classes of media reports, of
which the mastery of crisis class (articles on individuals who
adopted coping strategies other than suicidal behaviour in
adverse circumstances) was negatively associated with
suicide, whereas the expert opinion class and the
epidemiological facts class were positively associated with
suicide.
Conclusions
The impact of suicide reporting may not be restricted to
harmful effects; rather, coverage of positive coping in
adverse circumstances, as covered in media items about
suicidal ideation, may have protective effects.

 the literature (see below). Coding examples are shown to
exemplify the subcodes ‘suicidal ideation’ and ‘suicide attempt’
.
(a) Quantity of reporting:
(i)
repetitive reporting: count of reports on the same event in
the sample;
(ii) density of reporting: count of suicide-related articles on
the day of publication.
(b) Main focus:
(i)
completed suicide: item is on a case of completed suicide;
(ii) attempted suicide: item is on a case of attempted suicide.
Also, a suicidal act stopped by another person immediately
before the act qualifies as an attempted suicide;15
(iii) homicide suicide: item is on a homicide (attempt);
murderer is suicidal;
(iv) suicidal ideation: item is on a case of suicidal ideation not
accompanied by suicide attempt or suicide. Also, an
aborted suicide attempt qualifies as suicidal ideation, in
that it refers to an act in which an individual is one
step away from attempting suicide, but changes her or
his mind immediately before.15
Coding examples (in parentheses: location of the text
segment in the sample):
‘Before [Tom Jones] had his first hit, he thought about suicide . . . and
wanted to jump in front of an Underground train in London . . . In 1965,
before he made the charts with ‘‘It’s not unusual’’, he thought for a
second: ‘‘If I just take a step to the right, then it’ll all be over’’.’ (s–495)
‘J.L. suffered from severe chronic pain for 37 years and was addicted to
painkillers . . . up until 1978. ‘‘At that time . . . I considered the things I could
do, one of them was suicide’’, says the entertainer.’ (s–327).
(v) prevention programme: item is primarily on an initiative
to prevent suicide, not on a case of suicidal behaviour;
(vi) suicide research: item is primarily on suicide-related
research, epidemiology, statistics, not on a case of suicidal
behaviour.
(c) Reported method:
(i)
hanging;
(ii) jumping: jumping in front of moving objects/from great
heights;
(iii) shooting;
(iv) drowning;
(v) poisoning;
(vi) other method.
(d) Prominence:
(i)
front page: item is located on the front page;
(e) Fictionality:
(i)
content is fictional.
Qualitative item characteristics
The main content analysis aimed at identifying consistencies and
inconsistencies between media reports and media recommendations
for suicide reporting. We obtained 15 international guidelines for
reporting on suicide from the WHO and from national agencies,
with guidelines stemming from the USA, Europe, Australia and
Asia (see online supplement). These media recommendations
have previously been compared and judged to be similar.7
Three coders (T.N.,
B.T.,
A.H.) were involved in
the
development of an outline for preliminary categorisation. There
was a broad consensus among the coders about the thematic areas
covered in the guidelines. Each of the recommendations listed as
harmful focused either on the portrayal of the identity of the
suicidal person; the suicidal act; the causes of suicidality; the
effects of suicidality; or on the style and wording of the article.
The recommendations listed as protective all focused on the
reporting
of
background
information
on
suicidality.
We
conceptualised each of these topics as a code prior to exploration
of the media reports and attached subcodes based on each
recommendation
in
the
guidelines
to
that
code.
Only
recommendations listed in more than one of the media guidelines
were conceptualised as distinctive subcodes. Subcodes listed as
harmful were conceptualised as a code family of ‘harmful item
characteristics’ and distinguished from codes listed as protective
(code family: ‘protective item characteristics’).
In an iterative process of coding 100 articles for training
purposes, the media reports were explored and theoretical codes
were brought together with the text. In some cases, the subcodes
turned out not to be relevant to the text on its own, and closely
connected themes were merged. The values used for all codes,
except for article length and sensationalism (see below), were
the presence of a code (1) and its absence (0). The unit of text
analysis was always the complete article. The coders developed a
code book with definitions of the subcodes, along with coding
examples. The following list of distinctive codes and subcodes
was used. For tabulated code definitions and coding examples
see online Table DS1.
Harmful item characteristics
(a) Identity of the suicidal person:
(i)
name reported;
(ii) description of character.
(b) Suicidal act:
(i)
method in headline;
(ii) step-by-step ‘guide’ (i.e. how to use a suicide method);
(iii) suicide location reported;
(iv) suicide pact or mass suicide reported.
(c) Causes of suicidality:
(i)
life event(s) related to suicide reported;
(ii) societal problems reported as having increased;
(iii) monocausality;
(iv) citation from suicide note.
(d) Effects of suicidality:
(i)
effects on bereaved;
(ii) effects of suicidal act on public life;
(iii) immediate death without suffering reported.
(e) Style and wording:
(i)
photograph;
(ii) several independent suicidal acts reported;
(iii) reference to a suicide epidemic;
(iv) headline explicitly on suicide;
(v) public myths reported;
(vi) article length;
(vii)sensationalism (see below).
Protective item characteristics
(a) Background information:
(i)
focus on suicidal ideation;
(ii) focus on prevention programme;
(iii) focus on suicide research;
(iv) expert opinion reported;
(v) mental disorder related to suicide;
(vi) myths debunked;
(vii)contact information for support service; address or
telephone number of a support service reported;
(viii)suicide-related statistical data reported;
(ix) suffering of suicidal person resulting from suicidal act
reported.
A linguistic approach to measuring sensationalism
The recommendations in media guidelines to avoid sensationalism
required a more indirect method of operationalisation than was
235

 Niederkrotenthaler et al
the case for the other qualitative variables. Sensationalism is a
prominent feature of the tabloid media.16 More generally, the
tabloid
media
are
characterised
by
large
amounts
of
emotionality,16 reduction in complexity (as indicated by short
sentences),17 large amounts of dichotomous thinking18 and a lack
of richness of vocabulary.19 Dichotomous thinking and restricted
use of language have also been found in suicidal individuals,20 and
are often jointly referred to as ‘suicidal constriction’. Suicidal
individuals may be confirmed in their constriction by media items
that mimic their own constrictive thinking. The following four
subcodes of sensationalism were developed to measure sentence
length, emotionality, dichotomous thinking, and richness of
vocabulary.
(a) Sentence length: the word count divided by the number of
sentences.
(b) Emotionality: the Affective Dictionary Ulm contains 183
words extracted from German newspapers that were evaluated
as indicating high emotionality21 (e.g. aggression, murder,
pressure, jealousy, hatred, explosion, crisis, pain, scream).
The nouns and corresponding adjectives and verbs were
included as indicator words; any inflected forms were also
considered. To obtain an ‘emotionality score’
, we calculated
the proportion of these indicator words in the total word
count.
(c) Dichotomous thinking: this is characterised by a high amount
of certainty.20 We obtained lists of the most frequent words
expressing
high
certainty
(n = 53;
e.g.
certain,
proven,
undeniable) and low certainty (n = 57; e.g. doubtful, maybe,
potentially,
nearly)
from
the
linguistic
literature20
and
calculated for each item a certainty score, defined as the
number of words indicating high certainty divided by the
count of all words related to certainty.
(d) Standardised type/token ratio: richness of vocabulary was
defined as the average proportion of new words in consecutive
text fragments of 100 words, which is referred to as the
standardised type/token ratio.19
We programmed a MySQL database (MySQL 5.1, Mu
¨nchen,
Sun Microsystems; www.mysql.de) for Windows XP to calculate
the linguistic parameters semi-automatically.
Rating agreement
Intercoder reliability was measured for all qualitative codes. In
total, a sample of 100 items that were not a subset of the full
sample of units to be coded served for informal training and pilot
testing. Codes not reaching the threshold value of 90% agreement
during informal training were discussed among the coders and
refined. Upon reaching a satisfactory agreement level (90%) for
all codes, we repeated this procedure as a pilot test, using a sample
of 30 training text units that were different from the ones used in
the informal test. The time needed for the training process was
about 40 h.
We evaluated intercoder reliability after completion of the text
analysis, using 40 randomly selected text items from the main
sample.
Two
coders
(A.H.
and
B.T.)
coded
these
items
independently of the main coder (T.N.). We used two different
indices,
namely
the
simple
percentage
of
agreement
and
Krippendorff’s a,22 to measure the level of agreement between
coders.
Krippendorff’s
a
coefficient,
which
seemed
most
appropriate because of its applicability to nominal data,22 ranged
from 0.80 to 1, implying a high level of agreement. These values
correspond to agreement percentages exceeding 90%.
Quantitative analysis
The quantitative analysis aimed at measuring associations between
item contents and suicide rates. Statistics Austria (www.statistik.at/)
provided daily data on suicides for each Austrian federal state for
the time period December 2004 to July 2005 as well as data on the
population sizes. The outcome variable (suicide) was defined as
the difference between the suicide rates (suicides per 100 000 total
population) in the week preceding the publication date and in the
week after publication. More specifically, days 714 to 78 (where
day 0 marks the publication date) were defined as the pre-
publication period and days 0 to 6 were the corresponding post-
publication period. We did not use the week immediately
preceding the publication date as the pre-period because of the
possibility that other media (e.g. television or internet) may have
reported the suicidal event slightly earlier than the newspapers.
This, given the corresponding impact of these media, might have
led to contamination of the data. Only suicides that occurred in
the key market of the respective media item, i.e. the area where
more than 10% of the population were exposed to the item, were
used for the calculation of the outcome variable. In total, there
were 18 key markets. Nine out of the 11 newspapers analysed
had just one key market each; the 2 remaining newspapers each
had several overlapping key markets. These newspapers produced
regionally differing editions of their papers. The population sizes
of the key markets ranged from 362 000 to 3 492 000, with each
market comprising one or more of the nine Austrian federal states.
The sociodemographic profile of the population was similar across
the key markets with regard to age and gender.23 The proportion
of people living in urban areas ranged from 51 to 100% for the
different key markets.23
We assigned each media item to its key market, and the change
in the suicide rate was assigned to the item. Seven items (1.4%)
were not published in an area with item coverage of over 10%.
These items were excluded. For an overview of the suicide rates
and article counts in the ten most frequent key markets
(altogether containing 477 items (97.3% of all items)), see Fig. 1.
Data on the circulation rates of newspapers across the country
were obtained from Media Analysis Austria (2005).24 Data on
the local editions including individual items were obtained from
the Austrian Press Agency.
Point-biserial
and
Pearson
correlation
coefficients
were
calculated to quantify the associations between the qualitative
characteristics of the items and suicide rates. The codes in the
family ‘basic item characteristics’ were tested alongside significant
qualitative variables in a multivariate model. This model included
controls for the newspaper in which the item was published,
because local factors relevant to the specific key markets of
newspapers (e.g. degree of urbanisation) may have an impact on
media effects. In addition, we controlled for month of publication,
thus accounting for seasonal variation in suicide rates, which
might also influence media effects.2
To assess whether post-item changes in suicide rates varied
with the circulation rates of the media items we compared the
absolute value of the change in the suicide rate in key markets
with the change in the rate in those parts of the country where
coverage rates were under 10% using an independent groups t-test
for unequal variances (Welch’s test). Data analysis was performed
in SPSS 15 for Windows XP.
Latent class analysis
Potentially protective and harmful item characteristics may form
classes based on the reporting strategy applied in the production
of the report. Latent class analysis (LCA), a method with manifold
applications in psychiatry and related fields,25–27 postulates that
236
 Role of media reports in suicide
associations among a set of observed variables are the result of a
common underlying latent class structure. The goal of LCA is to
identify the smallest number of latent classes that adequately
describes the associations between observed variables, starting
with a one-class model and proceeding to successive models with
increasing
class
numbers.25,27
Information
about
the
class
structure is given by the latent class probabilities, which indicate
the proportion of the sample assigned to each class, and by
response probabilities, which are the proportions of class members
reporting each item characteristic.25,26 In addition to the indicator
variables that define classes, covariates, which control and describe
the classes, can be included in the model. We used all the item
characteristics listed as potentially protective, and also the harmful
characteristics that were significantly associated with suicide rates,
as indicators in the bivariate analyses. As a result of their practical
relevance in describing suicide reports, we controlled for several
basic item characteristics, namely for the quantity of reporting
(variable: ‘repetitive reporting’), for the focus on a completed
suicide, and for article length. Consistent with the literature,27
we utilised two LCA modules in the Latent Gold 4.5 software
for Windows XP, namely latent class cluster analysis and latent
class factor analysis, to identify the best fitting solution.
The latent class cluster algorithm differs from traditional
cluster algorithms, which group cases near each other according
to some definition of distance. It defines one cluster per latent
class, using model-based probabilities to classify cases.26 Latent
class factor analysis treats the latent classes as factors, but avoids
problems inherent in traditional factor analysis, such as having
to rotate factors and having to assume continuous observed
variables.26
The fit statistics served as a tool for model selection. The
observed frequencies of item characteristics were compared with
the expected frequencies predicted by the model by calculating a
likelihood-ratio goodness of fit value.25,26 Because there were
sparse contingency tables, the likelihood-ratio statistic did not
follow a chi-squared distribution; hence, we calculated boot-
strapped P-values. Models were compared using the Bayesian
information criterion and via the percentages of classification
error.25,26 Further, we analysed bivariate residuals between pairs
of
observed
variables.
The
initial
assumption
of
local
independence of pairs of variables with high residuals (43.84)
was relaxed to improve model fit.25,26 Finally, we allowed
for correlations
among
identified
factors.
This
strategy
is
recommended whenever theoretical expectation suggests that
the dimensions of an underlying structure are not completely
mutually independent.28 Based on the most probable class
assignment
of
media
items,
we
calculated
the
correlation
coefficients
of
classes
with
post-report
changes in
suicide
rates.
Results
The frequencies of basic item characteristics and of potentially
harmful and potentially protective characteristics are displayed
in Tables 1–3.
Bivariate analysis
Basic item characteristics
There was a positive association between repetitive reporting and
suicide rates. Reports on suicides by jumping and a main item
focus on suicide research were positively associated with suicide
rates, whereas a main focus on suicidal ideation was negatively
associated with suicide rates (Table 1).
Harmful item characteristics
Media items explicitly stating that societal problems related to
suicide are increasing, items reporting several independent
suicidal acts, language referring to a suicide epidemic, reporting
of public myths and the amount of dichotomous thinking were
all positively associated with suicide rates (Table 2).
Protective item characteristics
Apart from a main item focus on suicidal ideation, none of the
potentially protective item characteristics was associated with a

research, items containing contact information for a public
support service and also the reporting of expert opinions were
all positively associated with suicide rates (Table 3).
The distribution of post-report changes in suicide rates for
different sets of media items is displayed in Fig. 2.
Multivariate analysis
In the multivariate model, repetitive reporting, reports about
suicides by jumping, and reporting on public myths about suicide
predicted post-item increases in suicide rates. Media items with a
main focus on suicidal ideation predicted decreases in suicide
rates.

Analysis of residuals did not indicate any violations of
the assumptions of linear regression, such as non-linearity, non-
normality of error terms, or heteroscedasticity. Autocorrelation
plots (ACF, pACF) and Durbin–Watson tests (DW = 1.89) did
not suggest autocorrelation, and variance inflation factors did
not indicate any multicollinearity problems (largest variance
inflation factors: 3.05).
t-test
Post-item changes in suicide rates were larger in regions with high
circulation rates of the media items (mean 0.22, s.d.= 0.18) than
in regions with low circulation rates (mean 0.09, s.d.= 0.09;
t(710.48) = 14.18, P50.001).
Latent class analysis
The LCA identified a (two-factor) four-class model as the best fit.

included in the final model. The variables ‘pathology reported’,
which showed only weak discrimination, and ‘suffering due to

, which had a very low level of endorsement across
classes, were omitted. The correlation between the two factors was
r = 0.30. Table 6 and Fig. 3 display the endorsement probabilities
for each class.
Class 1 (72.2% of media items), which we conceptualised as
the
suicide
case class,
had low probabilities
of
reporting
potentially protective or harmful item characteristics. Media items
in this class tended to report on a case of completed suicide. As
compared with the other classes, items were more likely reported
repeatedly and in short articles (Table 6, Fig. 3).
Class 2 (8.8% of media items), which we conceptualised as the
mastery of crisis class, tended to report individual suicidal
ideation not accompanied by suicidal behaviour. Repetitive
reporting and long articles were rather uncommon in this class.
Compared with the other classes, members of this class had the
smallest mean number of harmful item characteristics (Table 6,
Fig. 3). This was the only class with a negative mean change in
the suicide rate after publication (Table 7).
Class 3 (7.6% of media items), which we conceptualised as the
epidemiological facts class, comprised media items that tended to
report on suicide research and suicide statistics. The reporting of

Latent class analysis: response probabilities.
Estimated probabilities of showing potentially protective and harmful item characteristics for each of the four latent classes of media items.
a. Continuous variable: the value is the class-specific arithmetic mean mapped onto the interval 0 to 1, where 0 is identified with the lowest and 1 with the highest observed value
across classes.
 Role of media reports in suicide
a suicide epidemic, repetitive reporting and long articles were
rather common in this class (Table 6, Fig. 3). On average, these
articles had the highest number of harmful item characteristics
(Table 7).
Class 4 (11.5% of media items), which we conceptualised as
the expert opinion class, was likely to report on suicide prevention
programmes and expert opinions, to give contact information on
public support services, and to debunk public suicide myths.
Articles in this class tended to include the statement that societal
problems are increasing, and were characterised by a higher degree
of dichotomous thinking. Repetitive reporting was uncommon,
and articles were longer than for the other classes (Table 6,
Fig. 3). On average, articles in this class had the highest number
of potentially protective item characteristics (Table 7, Fig. 3).
Mean posterior assignment probabilities were well over 90%
for all classes (Class 1: 94.8%; Class 2: 95.7%; Class 3: 97.7%; Class
4: 95.5%), indicating high classification certainty.31
Correlations of latent classes with suicide rates
Assignment to the mastery of crisis class correlated negatively with
suicide rates (r = 70.111, n= 490, P= 0.014). Assignments to the
epidemiological facts class (r = 0.124, n= 490, P= 0.006) and the
expert opinion class were positively correlated with suicide rates
(r = 0.095, n = 490, P = 0.035). Assignment to the suicide case class
was not significantly associated with suicide rates (r = 70.084,
n = 490, P= 0.062).
Discussion
Key findings
The possibility of a suicide-protective effect of media items on
positive coping in adverse circumstances, which has been
discussed in the literature on a purely theoretical basis, was
empirically supported by the present findings. Reporting of
individual suicidal ideation (not accompanied by attempted or
completed suicide) was associated with a decrease in suicide rates.
The LCA suggested that media items on suicidal ideation formed a
distinctive class of articles, which had a low probability of
containing potentially harmful item characteristics. By contrast,
media items reporting public suicide myths and repetitive
suicide-related reporting were associated with increases in suicide
rates. Items with a high probability of containing expert opinions
or epidemiological facts were identified as distinctive latent classes
of
media
reports,
which
tended
to
be
intertwined
with
unfavourable,
sensationalist
contents.
These
classes
were
associated with increases in suicide rates.
Meaning of the key findings
The study suggests that prevention of suicidal behaviour by media
reports is possible. It expands the research base on the possible
impact of suicide-related media content on suicide rates to also
include a preventive effect, which we conceptualised as a Papageno
effect. In particular, items with a focus on suicidal ideation not
accompanied by a suicide attempt or completed suicide may have
a protective impact. The reporting strategy underlying these media
items seems to deviate from the general tendency to present
potentially protective suicide-related information together with
potentially harmful item characteristics. Evidence to date suggests
the preventive potential of quantitative reductions in sensationalist
reporting.10,32 To this, the present findings add that the actual re-
porting of suicidal ideation itself may contribute to preventing
suicide. Media items that focus on individual suicidal ideation
may enhance identification with the reported individual and thus
highlight the reported outcome as ‘going on living’
. Health-
promoting activities may be most effective when they encourage
the publication of articles on individuals who refrained from
adopting suicidal plans, and instead adopted positive coping
mechanisms in adverse circumstances.
The framing of media items reporting on epidemiology and
expert opinions with potentially harmful item characteristics, such
as a reference to a suicide epidemic or a statement that suicide-
related societal problems are becoming more pressing, cast some
doubt on the role of these types of information in media
discourse.
Consistent
with
findings
in
the
field
of
mass
communication,33 expert opinions seem to be used as a means
of giving an air of seriousness to reporting, but at the same time
tend to be embedded in an unfavourable, sensationalist context.
Similar conclusions were reached in an analysis of suicide-related
print media reports in Australia concerning statistical media
items, with the researchers noting that, in their opinion, statistical
items were written in a more unfavourable, sensationalist style
than media items on completed suicides.34 More generally, the
tendency to present news in a negative way in the tabloid media
has been assumed to result in a negative world image among
recipients (the so-called ‘scary world hypothesis’).35 The effects
of such ‘mixed messages’ on individuals with suicidal constriction
clearly warrants further scrutiny. The correlations of items in the
expert opinion class and in the epidemiological facts class with
increases in suicide rates suggest that these items may have a
harmful effect.
Other research
Dose–response relationships between the quantity of reporting on
completed suicide and subsequent suicides, as suggested in the
present study, have been repeatedly identified in the literature.1,4
Also, this study replicates the finding that changes in suicide rates
following the publication of media items are more pronounced in
regions where a higher proportion of the population is exposed
rather than in regions with a lower exposure.11 A further finding
in line with the literature is the association of reports on one

particular suicide method (i.e. jumping) with post-item increases
in suicide.10 Of note, suicides by jumping are more likely to be
reported by the print media than suicides by any other method.36
Even after controlling for a range of variables likely to influence
the probability of reporting (e.g. sociodemographic characteristics
of the suicide victim), jumping as a suicide method was found to
predict subsequent suicide reporting in the Austrian print
media.36
Study strengths and limitations
A strength of the present study is its coverage of all print media
items over a period of 6 months that included the word ‘suicide’,
which is likely to have succeeded in the identification of a large
proportion of all suicide reports. Furthermore, the coding system
applied showed high intercoder reliability, thereby demonstrating
high intersubjective analytic consensus. Qualitative approaches are
still sparse in suicide research, but are deemed fruitful, and even
vital, for research progress, because of their potential to generate
new hypotheses.37 Mixed-method (i.e. quantitative–qualitative)
approaches, as implemented here, are increasingly undertaken in
the social sciences and complement each other.38 Further strengths
of the present study are the comparatively large number of media
items analysed qualitatively, the assessment of repetitive reporting
on the same story and the adoption of an ecological study design
to fit variations in the circulation rate of the analysed media items
across the country.
Limitations of the study concern its ecological design, which is
appropriate for identifying associations, but not for establishing
causality. Methodological approaches using individual-level data
are necessary to deal with problems such as the ecological fallacy
(i.e. cross-level bias), and further potential confounders beyond
seasonality (which was accounted for in the multivariate analysis).
Furthermore, the unique contributions of single variables to the
variance
explained
in
the
multivariate
analysis
are,
albeit
nominally significant, small. This may be partly attributable to
the definition of the outcome variable as the difference between
post-item and pre-item suicide rates.29 However, completed
suicide is a rare event per se, and thus even small reductions in
suicide prevalence seem to be relevant to collaborations with the
mass media. Finally, the present study is confined to an analysis
of print media. This appears justified by the high exposure of
the population to the set of newspapers analysed. In 2005,
71.9% of the population were regularly exposed to one or several
of these newspapers.24 A recent meta-analysis found that studies
of print media effects are more likely to find evidence of a post-
report increase in suicide than studies of other media types,3
but did not take into account the internet. Future research should
also focus on this rapidly emerging medium.39
Suggestions for future research
This study is the first, to our knowledge, to use extensive measures
of media item quality. It enabled us to generate more fine-grained
hypotheses regarding the effects of suicide-related reporting.
Research in other countries is needed to assess the generalisability
of the findings. The hypotheses raised should be further examined
in qualitative settings, such as through analyses of interviews and
focus groups with suicide attempters. Furthermore, increases in
suicide rates after the publication of media items have been shown
to peak within 1 week of publication.2 Future research should also
investigate potential patterns of decay in protective media effects,
that is, the time pattern of any suicide-protective effect of media
reporting.
The present findings add a new perspective to internationally
ongoing collaborations between suicide researchers and media
professionals. The traditional print and television media, owing
to their general lack of space or time, sometimes hesitate to report
stories on individuals who adopted coping strategies other than
suicidal behaviour in adverse circumstances. The possible role of
media reports in preventing suicide may make it worthwhile for
journalists of both traditional and online news platforms to follow
media guidelines on the reporting of suicide.
