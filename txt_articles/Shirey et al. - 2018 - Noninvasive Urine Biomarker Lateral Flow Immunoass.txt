ABSTRACT: The parasitic disease onchocerciasis is the
second leading cause of preventable blindness, afflicting
more than 18 million people worldwide. Despite an available
treatment, ivermectin, and control efforts by the World Health
Organization, onchocerciasis remains a burden in many
regions. With an estimated 120 million people living in
areas at risk of infection, efforts are now shifting from
prevention to surveillance and elimination. The lack of a
robust, point-of-care diagnostic for an active Onchocerca
infection has been a limiting factor in these efforts. Previously,
we reported the discovery of the biomarker N-acetyl-tyramine-
O-glucuronide (NATOG) in human urine samples and its
ability to track treatment progression between medicated patients relative to placebo; we also established its capability to
monitor disease burden in a jird model. NATOG is a human-produced metabolite of tyramine, which itself is produced as a
nematode neurotransmitter. The ability of NATOG to distinguish between active and past infection overcomes the limitations
of antibody biomarkers and PCR methodologies. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) diagnostics offer the versatility and
simplicity to be employed in the field and are inexpensive enough to be utilized in large-scale screening efforts. Herein, we
report the development and assessment of a NATOG-based urine LFIA for onchocerciasis, which accurately identified 85% of
analyzed patient samples (N = 27).

O
nchocerciasis, commonly known as “River Blindness”, is
a neglected tropical disease afflicting an estimated 18
million people, and 120 million live in areas at risk.1 This
parasitic disease is endemic to Africa, Central and South
America, and Yemen and is vector-transmitted by Simulium sp.
black flies. The current treatment for onchocerciasis,
ivermectin, eliminates the microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus
and suppresses their production by adult female worms for
months following treatment. However, since this therapy does
not readily eliminate adult worms, ivermectin has to be taken
annually for years to break transmission.2 The World Health
Organization has facilitated mass drug administration of
ivermectin for decades. These efforts to combat onchocerciasis
have been implemented in phases including: the Onchocer-
ciasis Control Programme in West Africa (1974−2002), the
African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (1995−2015),
and now the Expanded Special Project for Elimination of
Neglected Tropical Diseases (2015−present).3−6
Due to the success of these prevention programs, the
campaign has shifted from prevention to surveillance and
elimination.7 However, these objectives depend on the
availability of reliable, inexpensive, and portable diagnostic
methods to monitor active infections in point-of-care areas.
Currently, there are a number of tests for onchocerciasis with
varied utility, sensitivity, and specificity. Most methods detect
microfilariae, including the reference-standard for onchocer-
ciasis diagnosis, a skin biopsy followed by microfilariae
counting under a microscope.8 Alternatively, onchocerciasis
has been diagnosed via a skin patch test based on the
inflammatory response induced by diethylcarbamazine.8,9 In
addition to these visual detection methods is the slit-lamp
examination of the eye. While these diagnostic methods have
excellent specificity, they lack sensitivity especially for
populations undergoing ivermectin treatment which reduces/
eliminates microfilariea.8,9 Methods that monitor adult worms
include nodule palpation and biomarker analysis specific to

 adults. Palpation detects nodules close to the skin surface but
cannot discriminate between nodules containing live or dead
worms.10 Furthermore, deep tissue nodules are missed entirely
by palpation. Host-produced antibodies against Ov-16 are
some of the most sensitive and specific biomarkers and have
even been incorporated into a portable assay.11 Unfortunately,
these tests cannot distinguish between past and current
infections due to the persistence of antibodies for years after
infection. Recently, peptide biomarkers for adult worms have
shown comparable sensitivity and specificity.12−14 Some of
these peptide biomarkers have been incorporated into a lateral
flow immunoassay (LFIA) with good sensitivity (63−98%)
and specificity (99−100%).13 However, the healthy and cross-
reactivity samples used for comparison were not from
onchocerciasis endemic regions meaning further evaluation
of specificity is still required.
An adult worm biomarker assay would overcome many of
the limitations of microfilariae monitoring methods while also
providing a rapid and noninvasive means to track and diagnose
active onchocerciasis. For decades, the efforts to identify
biomarkers with the necessary selectivity and sensitivity have
been largely unsuccessful due to population inconsistencies
and cross-reactivity.8 We have reported upon a biomarker we
have termed, N-acetyltyramine-O-glucuronide (NATOG),
which was uncovered through a metabolomics-mining
approach (Figure 1).15,16 We have posited this urine biomarker
to arise from a combination of metabolic steps in both the
nematode and the host. Thus, tyramine, a nematode
neurotransmitter, is acetylated by the nematode to form the
metabolite N-acetyltyramine, which is glucuronidated by the
host following excretion.16 Not only have we demonstrated
that NATOG values are significantly increased in onchocer-
ciasis patients relative to controls, but also we have established
its disease monitoring potential by tracking doxycycline and
ivermectin treatments relative to placebo.16 Furthermore, the
progression of infection has been observed in a rodent model
monitoring NATOG urine concentrations in jirds infected
with the closely related nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis.17
This capability to track active infection is unique among most
biomarkers for onchocerciasis and could have a significant
impact on surveillance programs.8,12 Moreover, NATOG has
even been shown to be species-specific when compared to
Mansonella perstans and Loa loa infections, two human filarial
nematodes known to be coendemic with O. volvulus. Although
average NATOG concentrations are higher in both L. loa (14.7
± 2.5 μM) and M. perstans (13.6 ± 2.5 μM) than the negative
control (6.4 ± 0.7 μM), they are still significantly reduced in
comparison to O. volvulus positive patients (42.8 ± 3.7 μM).16
Investigations into the stability characteristics of NATOG have
shown it withstands sun exposure, temperature changes, and
pH ranges (4−8), making it ideally suited for use in tropical
settings.18
In order to translate these findings into an operational field
test, we sought to employ NATOG in a semiquantifiable
competitive LFIA. LFIA are inexpensive, portable, and simple
to use making them an ideal screening platform for field work
in neglected regions. These immunoassays utilize three main
materials: a nitrocellulose membrane (platform), colored
nanoparticles (reporter), and antibodies (biomarker selector)
(Figure 2). While success in the LFIA arena requires all three
components to be optimized, it is the biomarker selector that
provides the greatest challenge as obtaining a high affinity/
selective antibody to a carbohydrate conjugate as the antigen is
fraught with uncertainty. Accordingly, monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) were produced by immunization of mice with a unique
keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) hapten conjugate.
Remarkably, even with the high concentration of glucuroni-
dated metabolites in human urine, mAbs selective for NATOG
were identified by competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) against structurally related analogs. With the
biomarker selector difficulty overcome, antibodies were
conjugated with collidal gold nanoparticles and used in the
development of the LFIA. Under optimized conditions, urine
samples spiked with NATOG were tested in triplicate,
analyzed, and found to have a linear NATOG dependency
(R2 = 0.91). Analyses of O. volvulus positive (N = 293) and
negative (N = 255) patient urine samples were used to
generate a distribution of NATOG concentrations for the two
populations. On the basis of this distribution, a cutoff (25 μM)
was selected to allow for 95% confidence in a positive
diagnosis. Patient samples (N = 27) were accessed employing
this cutoff, and 85% was identified accurately.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Hapten and Test Line Conjugate Synthesis. Produc-
tion of mAbs for NATOG detection requires the synthesis of a
small molecule hapten. Due to the number and variety of
glucuronidated compounds present in urine, it was vital to
obtain mAbs with high selectivity for NATOG.19 However, on
the basis of literature precedence, mAbs raised against small
molecule carbohydrates often have low affinity.20 In addition,
the selection of an “immunologically silent” linker becomes
increasingly more difficult to achieve as the size of the
carbohydrate epitope becomes smaller, resulting in immuno-
dominant responses directed toward the tether and not the
compound of interest.20−22 An immunodominant response for
the linker would contribute to preferential binding of the test
line, limiting the sensitivity of the LFIA. To maximize
recognition, our hapten was designed with a simple
modification to the amide to append a thiol linkage site
while maintaining the core NATOG structure (Figure 3).
Furthermore, from this site, an asymmetric maleimide linker
could be conjugated to a carrier protein in order to enhance
the immune response toward the small carbohydrate
hapten.22,23 Therefore, this hapten referred to as DG1 was
synthesized from commercially available tyramine and

 acetobromo-α-D-glucuronic acid methyl ester (Figure 3).
Tyramine was Boc protected in the presence of Boc anhydride
to yield tert-butyl (4-hydroxyphenethyl)carbamate which was
then coupled to the glucuronic acid donor via activation by
silver trifluoromethanesulfonate. Trifluoroacetic acid depro-
tection of the Boc amine followed by EDC coupling with 2-
(triphenylmethylthio)ethanoic acid and base catalyzed depro-
tection of the acyl and methoxy protecting groups afforded the
hapten DG1. Conjugation of DG1 to the carrier protein KLH
was achieved via a maleimide linker, and the hapten−carrier
conjugate was used for mAb procurement. Following the same
procedure, a bovine serum album (BSA)−DG1 hapten−
protein conjugate was also constructed for mAb character-
ization and to serve as the test line portion of our LFIA system.
To explore the possibility that linker effects could alter the
LFIA, a second hapten was synthesized through coupling of
the free amine with diethyl squarate followed by conjugation to
BSA to yield the BSA−SQ1. Due to the amino-selectivity and
its wide use in carbohydrate chemistry, the squaric acid linker
was selected to provide a structurally distinct comparison to
the maleimide linker utilized in DG1 (Figure S1).24,25 With
this additional BSA conjugate, tether specificity could be
evaluated and the test line could be further varied during
optimization of the LFIA.
To ensure consistency between the ELISA, surface plasmon
resonance (SPR), and LFIA optimization experiments, a single
batch of NATOG needed to be synthesized for all
experimentation. However, the previous synthetic route for
NATOG was not amenable to larger scales.15 To achieve a
robust synthetic strategy for NATOG (see Figure S2), the
more sensitive glycosyl bromide was replaced with a glycosyl
trichloroacetimidate and the amide in the donor was converted

 to an inactive azide. With these adjustments, NATOG was
synthesized consistently and could be readily scaled. Starting
from commercially available D-glucurono-6,3-lactone and 4-
hydroxyphenethyl bromide, NATOG was synthesized.
D-
Glucurono-6,3-lactone was converted to the glycosylation
acceptor methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-O-(trichloroacetimidoyl)-
α-D-glucopyranuronate, and 4-hydroxyphenethyl bromide was
converted to the donor 4-(2-azidoethyl)phenol, on the basis of
literature procedures.26,27 This donor/acceptor pair was
coupled in the presence of the activator boron trifluoride
etherate at −78 °C and warmed to room temperature to yield
2-(4-(2-azidoethyl)phenoxy)-6-(methoxycarbonyl)tetrahydro-
2H-pyran-3,4,5-triyl triacetate. NATOG was isolated as a white
powder following azide conversion to the amide in the
presence of thioacetic acid and base catalyzed deprotection of
the acyl and methoxy protecting groups. NATOG produced
through this synthetic route was utilized in competitive ELISA
and SPR experiments as well as in the optimization of our
LFIA.
Monoclonal Antibody Selection. The first phase of mAb
selection focused on the affinity for NATOG. A large panel of
mAbs supernatants was screened using competition ELISA
with BSA−DG1 and free NATOG. On the basis of these initial
findings, a set of 8 antibodies were advanced to the next phase
of selection where NATOG specificity was investigated using
structural analogs of NATOG and compounds containing
various NATOG moieties. Consistent with the literature, the
production of mAbs for a small glycosylated antigen generated
relatively low affinity antibodies. Although antibodies have
been developed for single carbohydrate conjugates, specificity
is often poor and optimal binding usually requires six or more
residues.20,22 In spite of these reports, one mAb, 13F9, was
able to achieve nanomolar affinity for NATOG. In addition to
affinity, obtaining high selectively was crucial for an operational
LFIA due to the significant presence of glucuronidated
compounds in urine. Thus, even a small off target affinity
could obstruct the assay due to the abundance. Surprisingly,
many of the mAbs had several orders of magnitude less affinity
for the structural analogs than NATOG (Table 1). In addition,
the most prevalent analogs in urine, glucose (9.0−143.1 μmol/
mmol creatinine), glucuronic acid (3.0−144.7 μmol/mmol
creatinine), tyramine (0.33−4.296 μmol/mmol creatinine),
and tyrosine (0.72−27.35 μmol/mmol creatinine), exhibited
little to no measurable affinity (average creatinine values for
healthy adults: 5.9−35 000 μm).19,28
When both the NATOG affinity and specificity results are
taken into account, the three most promising mAbs were
chosen for large scale production and purification, character-
ization by SPR, and evaluation in our LFIA system. Antibodies
included one high affinity binding mAb, 13F9, and two
moderate binding mAbs, 8C7 and 15A3, displaying only minor
cross-reactivity. Purified mAbs were reassessed by competition
ELISA and provided results consistent with our initial studies
(Tables 1 and S1). Further binding analysis was performed
using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based competitive
assay which closely mirrors our competitive LFIA format. The
IC50 values demonstrated several orders of magnitude
separation between NATOG and its structural analogs except
for p-nitrophenyl glucuronide (Table 2). Although this cross-
reactivity may be considered a potential liability, p-nitrophenyl
glucuronide is not a natural metabolite and therefore should
not impact our LFIA. To explore whether there was an
immunodominant response directed toward the linker moiety
within the hapten−linker−carrier complex, competition ELISA
experiments were conducted with BSA−SQ1.20−22 Remark-
ably, the mAbs demonstrated marginally higher binding for the
SQ1 variant suggesting that the immune response is primarily
against the NATOG scaffold (Table S2).
Lateral Flow Immunoassay Dipstick Diagnostic for
Onchocerciasis. Due to the relatively small size of the
biomarker, the competitive LFIA format was chosen to detect
NATOG instead of the more traditional sandwich LFIA
(Figure 4).29,30 In a competitive LFIA, a colloidal gold
antibody conjugate that is specific for the biomarker is placed
on the conjugation pad and a biomarker−protein conjugate is
applied to test line. When urine is introduced to the sample
pad, it migrates along the nitrocellulose membrane allowing for
the colloidal gold antibody to competitively bind between the
biomarker in the urine and the biomarker−BSA conjugate on
the test line. As a result, a colored test line is indicative of a

 negative sample, and inversely, a clear test line indicates a
positive sample. When this LFIA is incorporated into a reader,
the intensity of the test line can be used to determine the
concentration of biomarker in a semiquantitative fashion.
A BSA−NATOG (DG1 or SQ1) conjugate was used as the
test line to compete with NATOG in the urine for the binding
of a colloidal gold antibody conjugate. On the basis of affinity/
selectivity, three antibodies, 13F9, 8C7, and 15A3, were
conjugated to colloidal gold nanoparticles for LFIA inves-
tigations. The LFIA strips consisted of a nitrocellulose
membrane with an immobilized BSA−NATOG conjugate
(DG1 or SQ1) on the test line and a gold nanoparticle labeled
antibody on the conjugation pad (13F9, 8C7, 15A3). The
strips were run on a flat surface by applying the urine sample
(35 μL) to the sample pad and were dried before scanning.
The LFIA conditions were screened at two concentrations of
NATOG in urine (0, 30 μM) and with the three antibodies
(13F9, 8C7, 15A3), at three separate volumes of antibody
conjugate (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 μL). In addition, two test line
NATOG−BSA conjugates (DG1, SQ1) were screened at one
volume (0.5 μL) at four concentrations (0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 1.0
mg/mL). Under these screening conditions, the LFIA
produced intensely colored test lines that were not readily
discernible between both NATOG concentrations. However,
by diluting the urine samples with buffer (PBS, HEPES, or
MEPS) at various urine/buffer ratios (1:1, 3:2, 2:1), a clear
distinction was achieved. With optimized conditions (0.35 mg/
mL DG1, 0.5 mL of 13F9, 3:2 urine/PBS), signal intensity
correlated with the NATOG concentration. Furthermore, both
the DG1 and SQ1 test lines were indistinguishable during
optimization, consistent with the ELISA Kdapp values and
further demonstrating mAb selectivity for NATOG rather than
the tether (Table S2).
A linear dependency was established by analyzing six spiked
urine samples (0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, 30, 37.5, 45 μM) in triplicate,
averaging their peak heights, and plotting the results with a
linear fit (R2 = 0.91) (Figure 5). However, because of a limited
dynamic range (10−50 μM) and limit of quantitation (38
μM), the current state of this LFIA is best described as
semiquantitative. To evaluate color stability, tested strips were
stored under ambient condition and exhibited no visual
variation in color intensity even after several months. This is
consistent with other colloidal gold LFIAs that have
demonstrated reliability up to one year.31,32 This stability
allows for strips used at the point-of-care to undergo
reevaluation at a centralized laboratory for quality assurance.
Population Distribution, Cutoff, and Patient Samples.
With the linear relationship established in the spiked urine
samples, authentic patient samples were analyzed to validate
the LFIA. In order to mirror how this diagnostic would
function in the field, a NATOG concentration diagnostic cutoff
was determined by population distribution analysis. O. volvulus
positive patient samples including monoinfections and
coinfections with O. volvulus (Ov/Ll, Ov/Mp, and Ov/Ll/
Mp) were combined with O. volvulus monoinfection values
resulting in a NATOG concentration value of 39.2 ± 2.5 μM
(±SEM; N = 293). All samples without detectable O. volvulus
(O. volvulus negative control, L. loa monoinfection, M. perstans
monoinfection, L. loa/M. perstans coinfection, and Lymphatic
filariasis) were combined and resulted in an average
concentration of c(NATOG) = 9.29 ± 0.95 μM (±SEM; N
= 255). The negative log of NATOG concentration
(p[NATOG]) for patient samples (Npos = 293, Nneg = 255)
was grouped in 0.5p[NATOG] bins (3.5, 4, 4.5, ...) to obtain
frequency (eq S1), and the resulting points were then fit to a
normal distribution to evaluate the population overlap (Figure
6).33 Even though this analysis may contain false negatives due
to misdiagnosed individuals experiencing low intensity
infections, a distinct separation between the groups was
observed. On the basis of this distribution, a cutoff of 25 μM
was set to ensure a 95% confidence in a positive diagnosis.
With a cutoff set, the LFIA was assessed with O. volvulus
positive individuals (N = 14) and O. volvulus negative (N = 13)

 urine samples. To evaluate the LFIA over a wide range of
concentrations for both positive and negative samples, these
patients were selected to be representative of the binned
sample groups (the plotted points) utilized in the distribution
analysis (Figure 6). A correct diagnosis was defined as arriving
at the same conclusion indicated by mass spectroscopy
quantification for the given cutoff (25 μM). Under these
conditions, the LFIA assay was able to correctly diagnose 85%
of the patient samples (Table S3). The 15% incorrectly
diagnosed was likely due to minor errors introduced via
variability in urine composition. Although this sample set is
limited (N = 27), it demonstrates the feasibility of targeting
NATOG in a LFIA.
■ CONCLUSION
In summary, a semiquantitative competitive LFIA for the
biomarker NATOG has been developed utilizing mAbs
produced from immunization with a KLH−NATOG con-
jugate. The mAb selected for the LFIA demonstrated superior
specificity in the presence of similar glucuronidated metabo-
lites and was implemented in the assay by conjugation with
gold nanoparticles. A linear concentration dependency was
observed in urine samples spiked with NATOG, and a
diagnostic NATOG concentration cutoff for onchocerciasis
(25 μM) was determined by the analysis of a large cohort of
authentic patient samples (N = 548). Utilizing the linear
correlation and cutoff value, the LFIA assay was compared to
mass spectrometry data and exhibited 85% accuracy when
diagnosing a subset of patients (N = 27). Our present study
demonstrates that this LFIA has the potential to be the least
invasive diagnostic for onchocerciasis and provide a means to
monitor active infection and treatment progression in the field.
■ METHODS
Reagents. The colloidal gold nanoparticle solution (CG-40
Colloidal Gold 40 nm) was obtained from ABIOX. Sucrose
(CAS: 57-50-1) and Tween-20 (CAS: 9005-64-5) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. KLH (Cat# 77600) and BSA
(Cat# 77110) were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific.
PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM
Na2HPO4, and 2 mM KH2PO4) and borate (pH 9, 50 mM)
were both prepared.
Protein−Hapten Conjugation. DG1−KLH Immuniza-
tion Conjugation. Trityl-protected NATOG hapten (7.8 mg,
12.4 μmol) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (600
μL). Under vigorous stirring at room temperature, first,
trifluoroacetic acid (100 μL) and then trimethylsilane (500
μL) were added to the solution. The solution was stirred at
room temperature for 15 min. The reaction mixture was
transferred into an Eppendorff tube, and the solvent was
removed with a stream of nitrogen. The solid obtained was
dissolved in PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 10 mM) and mixed well to
dissolve all water-soluble components; the mixture was then
separated through centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 min. The
supernatant was then removed and slowly added to the
corresponding amount of preactivated BSA−maleimide
conjugate protein (1−5 mg of deprotected hapten versus 1
mg of protein). The solution was mixed gently for 12 h at 4 °C.
Afterward, the KLH conjugate was purified and/or rebuffered
using the Zeba desalting columns according to the
manufacturer’s manual.
DG1−BSA Test Line Conjugation. To BSA (100 μL, 6.7
mg/mL) in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) was added N-(γ-
maleimidobutyrloxy)succinimide ester (1 mL, 3.82 mg/mL),
and the solution was mixed gently at room temperature for 30
min. The mixture was then transferred to a Zeba spin desalting
column (7K MWCO, 5 mL) and centrifuged for 2 min
(1000g). During this time, the protected hapten (7 mg) was
dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (500 μL), and
trifluoroacetic acid (100 μL) was added followed by
trimethylsilane (500 μL). The solution was stirred at room
temperature for 20 min before the solvent was removed with a
stream of nitrogen. The solid was dissolved in PBS buffer (100
μL) and mixed well; the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm
for 2 min. The supernate was then slowly added to the BSA−
GMBS solution, and the sample was mixed gently for 12 h at 4
°C. The mixture was then dialyzed into PBS buffer (2 × 45
mL) overnight at 4 °C. Conjugation efficiency (18.5 copies)
was calculated by the difference in mass between BSA−GMBS
and BSA−GMBS−hapten by MALDI-TOF.
SQ1 Conjugation. To BSA (300 μL, 1.7 mg/mL) in borate
buffer (pH 9, 50 mM) was added the square amide hapten
(11.91 mg) dissolved in borate buffer (100 μL, pH 9, 50 mM),
and the solution was mixed gently at room temperature for 24
h. The mixture was then dialyzed into PBS buffer (2 × 45 mL)
overnight at 4 °C. Conjugation efficiency (13.7 copies) was
calculated by the difference in mass between BSA and BSA−
hapten by MALDI-TOF.
NATOG Monoclonal Antibody Production. A group of
four mice (A/J, 6 week old) were injected intraperitoneally
with DG1−KLH (100 μg) in PBS which had been premixed
with a Sigma Adjuvant System. After 2 weeks, all mice received
a booster injection identical to the initial immunization
injection. Five weeks later, an injection of DG1−KLH (50
μg) was administered intravenously (tail vein); the animals
were then sacrificed 3 days later, and the spleens removed.
Hybridoma generation followed from this point as per
literature procedure.34
Competition ELISA. The limiting dilution amounts of
NATOG−BSA conjugate and mAb were predetermined for
each antibody and used for competition ELISAs as described.
A 96-well plate (Costar 3690) was coated overnight at 4 °C
with NATOG−BSA and then blocked with 5% skim milk in
PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The blocking buffer was
removed, and an aliquot (15 μL) of serial diluted competing
antigen, NATOG or other small molecule, was added followed
by an equal amount of mAb. After incubation for 1 h at room
temperature, the plate was washed; 30 μL of a 1:10 000
dilution of a donkey-antimouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase
conjugate (Jack ImmunoResearch; code number: 715-035-
151) in 2% BSA−PBS was added, and the sample was
incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following a
washing step, the plate was developed with TMB (3,3′,5,5′-
tetramethylbenzidine) as the chromogenic substrate (Thermo-
Fisher Scientific; #34021) and H2SO4 (2 M) as the stopping
solution. The Kdapp was defined as the concentration of
competing antigen that resulted in one-half of the absorbance
measured in the absence of competing antigen.
Surface Plasmon Resonance. A surface plasmon
resonance (SPR)-based competition assay was performed for
the three lead antibodies, 13F9, 8C7, and 15A3, to assess their
binding affinities toward NATOG and other small molecules.
Measurements were conducted on a Biacore 3000 instrument
(Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in HBS-EP buffer at room

 temperature. The ligand, NATOG−BSA (DG1), was immo-
bilized onto a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare Life Sciences)
through amine coupling using standard NHS/EDC chemistry;
unconjugated BSA was immobilized on the reference flow cell.
The dilution factor for each mAb was standardized such that a
similar response measured in response units (RU) was
achieved with DG1−BSA immobilized on the chip surface.
Samples containing varying concentrations of compound and a
constant concentration of mAb were preincubated at room
temperature prior to injection for 2 min at 30 μL/min. After a
2 min dissociation phase, the chip surface was regenerated with
glycine−HCl (10 mM, pH 1.5). The binding data displayed as
a sensogram plot (RU vs time) for each sample was analyzed,
and an IC50 value for all mAb−compound combinations was
calculated. The RU values in the presence of inhibitor were
normalized to the RU values in the absence of inhibitor, and
the resulting data was fit to the equation log(inhibitor) vs
response−variable slope using GraphPad Prism. The resulting
competitive IC50 value is representative of the antibody Kd
binding constant for small molecule binding.35
Conjugation of Gold Nanoparticles to Antibodies. To
a colloidal gold nanoparticle solution (1.5 mL) was added
aqueous potassium carbonate (30 μL, 0.2 M) followed by the
antibody solution (5 μL, 1.2 mg/mL), and the solution was
mixed for 15 min. A PBS buffered (pH 7.4) 10% BSA solution
(50 μL) was added, and the solution mixed for an additional
15 min. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 12 000 rpm;
supernate was removed, and the pellet was suspended in
conjugate buffer (0.3 mL, 5 mM borate, pH 8, 0.1% BSA,
0.15% Tween-20, and 5% sucrose). The homogeneous red
solution was stored at 5 °C and warmed to room temperature
prior to application.
Clinical Specimens. Human urine from O. volvulus
infected and uninfected volunteers was collected as part of a
European Union Seventh Framework Programme Research
grant, contract 131242 “Enhanced Protective Immunity
Against Filariasis”. Samples consisted of preexisting, deidenti-
fied diagnostic specimens collected with written informed
consent; in cases of illiteracy, a literate witness signed and a
thumbprint was made by the participant. Infected individuals
were diagnosed by palpable nodules or microfilaridermia by
skin snip.5,6 Uninfected individuals were classified as persons
with no palpable nodules and microfilariae negative skin snips.
Both positive and negative samples were obtained from regions
endemic with onchocerciasis. Human urine from volunteers
infected with L. loa, M. perstans, and dual or triple infections
with O. volvulus was collected as part of the RADIO
Consortium supported by a grant to the Institute of
Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, University
Hospital of Bonn from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
(OPP1083888). Infections were confirmed by microscopic
examination of blood-borne microfilariae as previously
described.3,4,36
Preparation of the Test Strips. The LFIA strip was
assembled from a sample pad (Millipore GFCP203080), the
membrane (CN95 Sartorius), the wick pad (EMI 30250), and
the backing card (GL-57312). These components were applied
to the backing card and cut to the dimensions of 3 × 60 mm.
Once assembled, BSA−NATOG conjugate (0.5 μL of 0.35
mg/mL) was applied to position A and Ab−gold conjugate
(0.6 μL) was applied to position B by pipetting; the solutions
dried for an hour at room temperature (Figure 7). The strips
were stored in a desiccator at room temperature prior to use.
General Test Procedure. Urine samples (30 μL) were
diluted 3:2 with PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM
KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, and 2 mM KH2PO4) and applied to
position C by pipetting and run horizontally (Figure 7). The
strips were dried at room temperature prior to scanning.
Quantitation of test line spot intensities was performed on a
Lumos Leelu Benchtop Reader, Lumos Diagnostics, Carlsbad,
CA, USA. The Lumos Leelu reader was set to scan the entire
strip, illuminating with red and green light, with a 4 ms
exposure. Peak identification was centered at 610 pixels with
50 pixel tolerance, and background values were set on the left
side (475−525 pixels) and the right side (700−750 pixels) of
the peak. The peak heights were recorded to approximate
NATOG concentration.
