Purpose:
To assess cerebral microbleed (CMB) prevalence in pa-
tients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated 
syndrome (CIS) and associations with clinical outcomes.
Materials and 
Methods:
CMBs are associated with aging and neurodegenerative 
disorders. The prevalence of CMBs has not previously 
been well established. In this study, 445 patients with MS 
(266 with relapsing-remitting MS, 138 with secondary 
progressive MS, and 41 with primary progressive MS), 45 
patients with CIS, 51 patients with other neurological dis-
eases, and 177 healthy control subjects (HCs) underwent 
3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and clinical exam-
inations. A subset of 168 patients with MS and 50 HCs 
underwent neuropsychological testing. Number of CMBs 
was assessed on susceptibility-weighted minimum inten-
sity projections by using the Microbleed Anatomic Rating 
Scale; volume was calculated by using quantitative suscep-
tibility maps. Differences between groups were analyzed 
with the x2 test, Fisher exact test, Student t test, and 
analysis of variance; associations of CMBs with clinical 
and other MR imaging outcomes were explored with cor-
relation and regression analyses. Because CMB frequency 
increases with age, prevalence was investigated in partici-
pants at least 50 years of age and younger than 50 years.
Results:
Significantly more patients with MS than HCs had CMBs 
(19.8% vs 7.4%, respectively; P = .01) in the group at least 
50 years old. A trend toward greater presence of CMBs 
was found in patients with MS (P = .016) and patients with 
CIS who were younger than 50 years (P = .039) compared 
with HCs. In regression analysis adjusted for age, hyperten-
sion, and normalized brain volume, increased number of 
CMBs was significantly associated with increased physical 
disability in the MS population (R2 = 0.23, P , .0001). In 
correlation analysis, increased number of CMBs was sig-
nificantly associated with deteriorated auditory and verbal 
learning and memory (P = .006) and visual information 
processing speed trends (P = .049) in patients with MS.
Conclusion:
Monitoring CMBs may be relevant in patients with MS 
and CIS at higher risk for developing cognitive and phys-
ical disability.

Zivadinov et al
MS in which 1111 patients with CIS, 
MS, and OND and HCs were enrolled 
at baseline (28,32). The inclusion crite-
ria for this substudy of CMBs were (a) 
having baseline SWI examination data, 
(b) age of 18–75 years, and (c) undergo-
ing MR imaging examination within 30 
days of physical and/or neurological ex-
amination with the standardized study 
protocol. Exclusion criteria were (a) 
presence of relapse and steroid treat-
ment in the 30 days preceding study 
entry for patients with CIS and MS, (b) 
pre-existing medical conditions known 
to be associated with brain pathologic 
processes (eg, cerebrovascular disease, 
history of alcohol abuse), (c) evidence 
of brain ischemic or hemorrhagic in-
farcts on MR images, and (d) preg-
nancy. In total, 445 patients with MS, 
45 patients with CIS, 51 patients with 
OND, and 177 HCs fulfilled inclusion 
and exclusion criteria (Fig E1 [online]). 
The patients with OND were composed 
of neurodegenerative (n = 23), vascu-
lar (n = 8), autoimmune (n = 12), and 
neuromuscular (n = 8) diseases (Fig E1 
[online]). Of 445 patients with MS, 266 
(59.8%) had relapsing-remitting MS, 
differential diagnosis of CMBs observed 
at MR imaging (2,4,8–11,19,20). In-
creased prevalence of CMBs at MR 
imaging has been related to hyperten-
sion (15,21), altered lipid metabolism 
(9,17,22,23), migraines (24), and poor 
microstructural integrity of brain white 
matter (25).
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an im-
mune-mediated demyelinating and neu-
rodegenerative disorder of the central 
nervous system that is characterized 
by blood-brain barrier disruption, le-
sion formation, and development of 
central nervous system atrophy (26). 
MS progression is associated with in-
creased prevalence of cardiovascular 
(CV) comorbidities, including hyperten-
sion, hyperlipidemia, being overweight 
or obese, smoking, diabetes (27–30), 
diffuse white matter and gray matter 
damage (26), and migraine (31), all of 
which are also risk factors for CMBs 
(9,15,21,22,24,25).
Against this background, we hypoth-
esized that the prevalence of CMBs is 
increased in patients with MS and clini-
cally isolated syndrome (CIS), compared 
with the healthy population. We also ex-
plored the association of CMBs with CV 
risk factors and migraine and with clin-
ical outcomes of disease severity in pa-
tients with MS and CIS. The CMB char-
acteristics of patients with MS and CIS 
were compared with those of healthy 
control subjects (HCs) and patients with 
other neurological diseases (OND).

Advances in Knowledge
 
n The prevalence of cerebral micro-
bleeds (CMBs) is increased in 
older patients with multiple sclero-
sis (MS) (19.8%), compared with 
healthy control subjects (HCs, 
7.4%) with similar age and sex 
characteristics (P = .01).
 
n Patients with clinically isolated 
syndrome (CIS) tend to have an 
increased number of CMBs com-
pared with HCs (13.5% vs 3.1%, 
respectively; P = .039).
 
n Increased number of CMBs is 
associated with more severe 
physical (P , .0001) and cogni-
tive (P , .05) outcomes in 
patients with MS.
Implications for Patient Care
 
n Monitoring CMBs may be rele-
vant for identifying patients with 
MS and CIS who are at higher 
risk for developing cognitive and 
physical disability.
 
n Assessment of CMBs is recom-
mended in patients with MS and 
CIS.
C
erebral microbleeds (CMBs) ap-
pear as small, round, or ovoid 
lesions at gradient-recalled-echo 
T2*-weighted 
susceptibility-weighted 
imaging (SWI) or quantitative suscep-
tibility mapping magnetic resonance 
(MR) imaging (1–7).
The presence of CMBs has been 
associated with aging, traumatic brain 
injury, stroke, Alzheimer disease, Par-
kinson disease, cerebral amyloid angiop-
athy, and use of oral contraceptives and 
antithrombotic agents (2,8–17). Because 
CMBs are associated with increased 
vascular mortality, cognitive decline, 
and stroke, they are often investigated 
in studies of stroke risk and age-related 
cognitive impairment (2,4,8,10,12,14). 
The prevalence of CMBs in healthy sam-
ples ranges from 2% to 20% and mark-
edly increases with age (8–11,17).
Histologic studies showed that CMBs 
are manifestations of focal extravascular 
leakage of blood components that con-
tain hemosiderin-laden macrophages 
and abnormal microvessels that show 
fibrohyalinosis (18). A recent histopath-
ologic study in which 7-T postmortem 
MR imaging was used in autopsy cases 
of severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy 
and Alzheimer disease showed hetero-
geneous pathologic substrates of the 
CMBs, including cases of cavernomas 
(19). Therefore, a number of patho-
physiological mechanisms and pathologic 
conditions have to be considered in the

spatial-resolution T1-weighted imaging 
(see details in Appendix E1 [online]).
MR imaging analysts were blinded 
to the participants’ physical and neu-
rological conditions. The CMB analysis 
was performed on SWI minimum inten-
sity projection images and susceptibility 
maps by two experienced neuroimagers 
(R.Z., with 20 years of experience; and 
D.P.R., with 15 years of experience) 
who were also blinded to MR images 
obtained with other sequences. CMBs 
were classified as focal, small, round to 
ovoid punctuate areas of hypointensity 
on SWI minimum intensity projection 
images and areas of hyperintensity on 
susceptibility maps (1,7). Signal voids 
caused by sulcal vessels, calcifications, 
and signal averaging from bone were 
considered mimics of microbleeds. The 
presence and number of definite CMBs 
were determined on SWI minimum 
intensity projection images by using 
the Microbleed Anatomic Rating Scale 
(Figs 1–5, Fig E2 [online]) (39). The 
CMB volume was calculated on suscep-
tibility maps by using a semiautomated 
unit (GE, Milwaukee, Wis) by using 
an eight-channel head and neck coil. 
Data for SWI and quantitative suscep-
tibility maps were acquired by using 
an unaccelerated three-dimensional 
single-echo spoiled gradient-recalled-
echo sequence with first-order flow 
compensation in read and section di-
rections, a matrix of 512 3 192 3 64, 
and a nominal resolution of 0.5 3 1.0 
3 2.0 mm (field of view, 256 3 192 
3 128 mm), flip angle of 12°, repe-
tition time (msec)/echo time (msec) 
of 40/22, bandwidth of 13.89 kHz, 
and acquisition time of 8 minutes 46 
seconds (38). The details of the SWI 
minimum intensity projection and 
quantitative susceptibility mapping re-
constructions are provided in Appen-
dix E1 (online).
Additional sequences included two- 
dimensional T2-weighted and proton 
density–weighted imaging, fluid-atten-
uated 
inversion-recovery 
imaging, 
spin-echo T1-weighted imaging with 
and without gadolinium-based contrast 
 
material, and three-dimensional high- 
138 (31.0%) had secondary progressive 
MS, and 41 (9.2%) had primary pro-
gressive MS. A subset of 168 patients 
with MS (37.8%) and 50 HCs (28.2%) 
also underwent neuropsychological eval-
uation within 30 days of MR imaging 
examination.
All participants were assessed with 
a structured questionnaire (33) and 
underwent physical and neurological 
examinations (32). CV risk factors and 
migraine history were collected from 
all participants, as reported previously 
(28,31). HCs were recruited from hos-
pital personnel, responded to a local 
advertisement, or were spouses of the 
patients with MS and had to meet the 
health screening MR imaging require-
ments and undergo a neurological ex-
amination with normal findings.

authors (R.Z., D.P.R., R.R.H.B., P.P., 
J.H., M.G.D., N. Bergsland, N. Bertoli-
no, B.W.G., C.K., D.H., D.U., E.M.H., 
and F.S.) had control of the data and 
material submitted for publication. The 
study protocol was approved by the 
local institutional review board, and 
all participants gave their written in-
formed consent.
Neuropsychological Testing
Neuropsychological testing was conduct-
ed by using Brief International Cognitive 
Assessment for MS (34) under the su-
pervision of a board-certified neuropsy-
chologist who was blinded to MR imag-
ing findings and other clinical findings 
(R.R.H.B., with 25 year of experience). 
Tests were used to measure processing 
speed, executive function, and memory 
and were as follows: oral administration 
of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (35) 
for visual information processing speed, 
the Total Learning portion of the second 
edition of the California Verbal Learning 
Test (36) for auditory and verbal learn-
ing and memory, and the Total Learning 
portion of the Brief Visuospatial Mem-
ory Test–Revised (37) for visual learn-
ing and memory.

olding technique (38) (Figs 1–5, Fig E2

F.S. (with 10 years of experience).
The MR imaging measures also in-
cluded assessment of lesion volumes on 
T2- and T1-weighted images (38) and 
brain volume measures (38,40) in all 
study participants. Contrast material–
enhanced lesions were only assessed in 
patients with MS and CIS.
Reproducibility of CMB Assessment
Reproducibility for detection of CMB 
number was assessed by two raters 
(D.P.R. and D.H., with 10 years of ex-
perience) who reviewed a set of 19 SWI 
minimum intensity projection images 
twice from five patients with MS, five 
patients with OND, five patients with 
CIS, and four HCs, with a minimum of 2 
weeks in between. Raters were blinded 
to each other’s assessments, as well as 
to their own prior set of assessments. 
Intra- and interrater reproducibility 
were calculated by using the intraclass 
correlation coefficient, k values, and 
relative 95% confidence intervals.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by 
using SPSS version 21.0 software (IBM, 
Armonk, NY). Distributions of the 
data were tested for normality by us-
ing the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences 
in categorical variables between the 
groups were analyzed by using the x2 
and Fisher exact tests. The Student t 
test and analysis of variance were used 
to analyze the differences in continuous 
variables between the groups.
Given that it has been demonstrated 
that prevalence of CMBs increases with 
age (usually after 50 years) (8–11,17), 
the prevalence of CMBs was investi-
gated separately in participants at least 
50 years old or less than 50 years old.
Because the number and volume 
of CMBs were strongly related to each 
other (Spearman r = 0.987), only 
CMB number was used in univariate 
and multivariate analyses. In univar-
iate analysis, by using Spearman r or 
Pearson (r) correlation analyses, we 
determined the association between 
the number of CMBs and demographic 
parameters (age, sex, and education),

significant differences between the pa-
tients with MS and HCs were found 
for frequency of multiple CMBs or the 
mean number and volume of CMBs.
Regional Distribution of the CMBs in the 
Study Groups
Table 3 and Figures 1–5 show regional 
brain distribution of CMBs in study 
participants. The distribution of the 
CMBs was the highest in the infratento-
rial region, followed by lobar and deep 
brain regions in patients with MS, CIS, 
and OND. HCs presented the highest 
frequency of CMBs in deep and lobar 
brain regions. Patients with MS showed 
the highest frequency of CMBs in the 
brainstem, followed by the cerebellum, 
basal ganglia, and occipital lobe.
Associations between CMBs and 
Demographic, CV, Clinical, and MR 
Imaging Characteristics in the Study 
Groups by Using Univariate Analyses
Increased age was associated with in-
creased number of CMBs in patients 
with MS (r = 0.22, P , .001), and there 
was a trend in HCs (r = 0.16, P = .035) 
but not in patients with CIS or OND. 
Sex and education were not related to 
increased number of CMBs in any study 
group. Hypertension was the only CV 
risk factor examined that was related to 
an increased number of CMBs in HCs 
(r = 0.26, P = .003).
In HCs, increased number of CMBs 
was significantly associated with de-
creased 
normalized 
white 
matter 
volume (r = 20.22, P = .004) and in-
creased normalized lateral ventricle 
volume (r = 0.2, P = .009), and there 
was a trend toward decreased normal-
ized brain volume (r = 20.16, P = .031). 
In patients with MS, there was a trend 
toward increased number of CMBs and 
increased normalized lateral ventricle 
volume (r = 0.1, P = .037). No signifi-
cant associations were found in patients 
with CIS and OND between CMBs and 
brain volume measures or between 
CMBs and lesion outcomes in any of the 
study groups.
In patients with MS, increased 
number of CMBs was associated with 
increased Expanded Disability Status 
Scale score (r = 0.26, P , .0001), while 
had secondary progressive MS, and 15 
(8.9%) had primary progressive MS.
CMB Assessment Reproducibility
A high degree of inter- and intrarater 
reproducibility was observed in the de-
tection of CMBs, with strong intraclass 
correlation coefficient values (0.92; P 
, .001; 95% confidence interval: 0.80, 
0.97) and k values (0.87; P , .001; 
95% confidence interval: 0.63, 1.11) 
between the raters.
CMB Characteristics in the Study Groups
Table 2 shows CMB characteristics in 
the study groups. There was a trend 
toward more patients with MS than 
HCs having CMBs (11.5% vs 5.1%, re-
spectively; P = .016). A similar propor-
tion of patients with CIS (13.5%) and 
OND (11.8%) with CMBs was found. 
There were no significant differences 
in the frequency of multiple CMBs be-
tween the different study groups. There 
were no significant differences in the 
frequency of multiple CMBs or the 
mean number and volume of CMBs be-
tween the different study groups.
Table 2 also shows CMB character-
istics in participants at least 50 years of 
age and those younger than 50 years. In 
participants at least 50 years old, signif-
icantly more patients with MS than HCs 
had CMBs (19.8% vs 7.4%, respec-
tively; P = .01). In participants younger 
than 50 years, there was a trend to-
ward more patients with CIS than HCs 
having CMBs (13.5% vs 3.1%, respec-
tively; P = .039) and more patients with 
CIS than HCs showing multiple CMBs 
(P = .038).
In the subgroup of patients who 
presented with migraine, there were 
three patients with MS (3.9%) and two 
patients with OND (14.3%) who had 
CMBs.
In the subgroup of patients who 
underwent 
neuropsychological 
test-
ing, 17 patients with MS (10.1%) had 
CMBs compared with two HCs (4%, 
P = .143). Of these, in participants at 
least 50 years old, 13 had MS (18.6%), 
and one was an HC (5%) (P = .179), 
whereas for participants younger than 
50 years old, four had MS (4.2%), and 
one was an HC (3.3%) (P = .999). No 
CV risk factors (being overweight or 
obese and/or having hypertension, 
heart disease, and/or type 1 diabetes), 
clinical variables (MS disease course, 
disease duration, and physical disabil-
ity), MR imaging variables (lesion out-
comes and brain volumes), and stan-
dardized neuropsychological variables 
(Symbol Digit Modalities Test, second 
edition of the California Verbal Learn-
ing Test, and Brief Visuospatial Mem-
ory Test–Revised). In multivariate lin-
ear backward regression analyses, we 
explored associations of CMBs with 
clinical outcomes. The analyses were 
adjusted for demographic parameters 
(age), CV risk factors (hypertension), 
and MR imaging variables (normal-
ized brain volume), as those resulted 
in significant differences or trending in 
the univariate analyses. Standard diag-
nostic tests for multicollinearity were 
performed.
A nominal P value of up to .01 was 
considered to indicate a statistically sig-
nificant difference, and a P value of up 
to .05 indicated a trend according to 
two-tailed tests.
Results
Demographic, Clinical, and MR Imaging 
Characteristics in the Study Groups
Table 1 shows demographic, clinical, 
and MR imaging characteristics of 
the study participants. Patients with 
MS had lower age at onset (P = .007) 
and longer disease duration (P = .003) 
than patients with OND. Patients with 
CIS had younger age (P , .0001) and 
increased frequency of hypertension 
(P = .002) than HCs. There were sig-
nificant differences in MR imaging le-
sion and brain volumes, with patients 
with MS showing the most severe 
outcomes.
There were no significant differ-
ences for demographic, clinical, and 
MR imaging characteristics in patients 
with MS and HCs who underwent neu-
ropsychological evaluation and those 
who did not (Table E1 [online]). Of 168 
patients with MS who underwent neu-
ropsychological testing, 103 (61.3%) 
had relapsing-remitting MS, 50 (29.8%)

Note.—Data are numbers of participants with percentages in parentheses, unless indicated otherwise. The CMB number and volume were calculated only in participants with CMBs. The mean age for the group at least 50 years of age was 57.1 
years for patients with MS, 59.2 years for patients with OND, 58.6 years for HCs, and 56.9 years for patients with CIS, while the mean age for the group younger than 50 years was 39.5 years for patients with MS, 38.7 years for patients with OND, 
37.7 years for HCs, and 34.1 years for patients with CIS. When participants were divided into groups at least 50 years of age and younger than 50 years, no significant differences for demographic and CV risk factors between patients with MS, 
patients with OND, and HCs were found. However, as expected, there were significant differences between the three groups in MR imaging lesion and brain volumes, with patients with MS at least 50 years of age and younger than 50 years showing 
the most severe outcomes. The differences between the groups were tested by using the x2 or Fisher exact test, when appropriate, and the Student t test. The analyses between patients with MS and OND were performed by using analysis of variance 
adjusted for disease duration and age at onset. NA = not available.

multivariate analyses, greater phys-
ical disability, as measured with the 
Expanded Disability Status Scale, was 
significantly associated with increased 
number of CMBs after adjusting for 
age, hypertension, and whole-brain vol-
ume in the total MS population and in 
the subgroup of patients with MS who 
underwent neuropsychological testing. 
This is indeed an important finding, 
because it suggests that CMBs are in-
dependently associated with increased 
physical disability in patients with MS. 
Although the associations between 
CMBs and cognitive outcomes did not 
reach significance in the multivari-
ate analyses, our findings suggest that 
CMBs may contribute to more severe 
cognitive decline in patients with MS, in 
line with aging studies (11,12,14,15,21).
The prevalence of CMBs has pre-
viously been found to increase signifi-
cantly with age (8–11). In the Rotter-
dam population-based study, the CMB 
prevalence was 17.8% in individuals 
aged 60–69 years, 31.3% in those 70–
79 of age, and 38.3% in those 80–97 
years old (23). When we grouped the 
study participants into those at least 50 
years of age and those younger than 50 
years, we found that patients at least 
the independent variable. Increased 
number of CMBs was significantly as-
sociated with increased Expanded Dis-
ability Status Scale score in the total 
MS populations (R2 = 0.23, b =.94, P 
, .0001), as well as in the subgroup of 
patients with MS who underwent neu-
ropsychological testing (R2 = 0.24, b = 
.94, P , .0001). No significant associ-
ation was detected between cognitive 
outcomes and number of CMBs in mul-
tivariate analyses.
Discussion
In the current study, we found increased 
prevalence of CMBs in patients with MS 
who were at least 50 years old, com-
pared with HCs with similar age and 
sex characteristics; however, the CMB 
prevalence was comparable to that in 
patients with OND. Increased number 
of CMBs was associated with more se-
vere physical and cognitive outcomes 
in patients with MS. There was also a 
tendency toward increased prevalence 
of CMBs in patients with CIS.
We found significant associations 
between number of CMBs and physi-
cal and cognitive outcomes in patients 
with MS in univariate analyses. In 
progressive disease course was also 
associated with increased number of 
CMBs (r = 0.21, P , .0001). No sig-
nificant association of number of CMBs 
was found with disease duration in pa-
tients with MS, CIS, or OND. No sig-
nificant associations between Expanded 
Disability Status Scale scores and CMBs 
were found in patients with CIS.
In the subgroup of patients with 
MS who underwent neuropsychological 
testing, we found a significant associa-
tion between an increased number of 
CMBs and increased Expanded Dis-
ability Status Scale score (r = 0.31, 
 
P , .0001) and decreased second edi-
tion of the California Verbal Learning 
Test score (r = 2022, P = .006), and 
there was a trend between increased 
number of CMBs and decreased Symbol 
Digit Modalities Test score (r = 2016, 
P = .049).
Association between CMBs and Clinical 
Characteristics in the Study Groups by 
Using Multivariate Analyses
In multivariate regression analysis, ad-
justed for age, hypertension, and nor-
malized brain volume, clinical vari-
ables were entered as the dependent 
variable and number of CMBs as

NEURORADIOLOGY: Cerebral Microbleeds in Multiple Sclerosis 
Zivadinov et al
50 years of age with MS had a 2.7-fold 
increase, while patients younger than 
50 years with CIS had a 4.4-times in-
creased likelihood of having CMBs, 
compared with the HCs with similar 
age and sex characteristics.
In large population-based studies, 
investigators have examined the associ-
ation of CMBs with CV and other risk 
factors in aging (9,15,21,22,24,25). Hy-
pertension is one of the most confirmed 
risk factors for increased prevalence of 
CMBs (15,21). In the Karolinska Im-
aging Dementia Study that included 
1504 patients with dementia, hyperten-
sion was the most predictive CV risk 
factor for CMBs, with number of CV 
risks (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and 
diabetes) increasing the likelihood of 
having CMBs (15). Over 2 years, hyper-
tensive patients with higher blood pres-
sure levels at baseline developed more 
CMBs over the follow-up period (41). 
We confirmed a positive association be-
tween increased number of CMBs and 
hypertension only in HCs and not in 
patients with MS. It has been reported 
that altered lipid metabolism has also 
been associated with an increased risk 
of CMBs (9,22,23). No other associ-
ation between increased number of 
CMBs and examined CV risk factors 
was found in patients with MS and CIS 
in the current study, which suggests 
that other possible factors (25) may 
be involved in creation of the CMBs in 
these patients. Because 15%–20% of 
patients with MS present with migraine 
(31), we investigated whether those pa-
tients may be at higher risk of develop-
ing CMBs but found no association of 
migraine with CMBs.
In the population-based Rotterdam 
study that included 4493 individuals, 
increased prevalence of CMBs was as-
sociated with decreased microstruc-
tural white matter integrity (25). In the 
present study, we found that increased 
prevalence of CMBs is associated with 
decreased white matter volume in HCs 
but not in patients with MS or CIS. 
While we did not investigate micro-
structural white matter and gray matter 
integrity in the current study by using 
advanced imaging techniques (26), it 
could be hypothesized that increased 
prevalence of CMBs in patients with 
MS and CIS is related to the severity of 
white matter damage.
Evidence suggests that location of 
CMBs may provide more information 
about the underlying clinical pheno-
type and disease pathologic processes 
(8,9,12,13,42). For example, deep 
brain and lobar CMBs were associ-
ated with cognitive decline in aging 
(9,12,42), while migraine has been 
linked to infratentorial CMBs (24). Our 
findings showed the highest prevalence 
of CMBs in infratentorial regions for 
patients with MS and CIS, while HCs 
showed the highest prevalence in lobar 
and deep brain regions, in line with 
previous studies (8,9,15).
Limitations of this study include 
the cross-sectional nature, in which a 
causal relationship between CMBs and 
MS was not able to be established. 
Another limitation is related to the 
absence of information on the use of 
oral contraceptives and antithrombotic 
agents (2,4). Moreover, this was an ob-
servational study, and given that we did 
not know how many comparisons we 
would make a priori, we did not adjust 
for multiple comparisons in our statis-
tical analyses.
A substantial subset of MS lesions 
in the white matter and gray matter 
have alterations as seen at SWI and 
quantitative susceptibility mapping (es-
pecially on the edges of MS plaques) 
(43–45), which can be caused by pro-
cesses other than the presence of non-
heme iron (such as changes in myelin, 
deoxyhemoglobin, and inflammation). 
Thus, the definition of CMBs has to be 
established according to the proposed 
guidelines (1). In future MS and CIS 
studies, CMBs should be investigated by 
using ultra-high field strength and histo-
pathologic imaging techniques, and the 
association with other nonconventional 
MR imaging measures has to be deter-
mined. A longitudinal 5-year examina-
tion of the present cohort is underway 
in our center to determine the associa-
tion of CMBs and the evolution of MR 
imaging and clinical outcomes.
We conclude that the prevalence 
of CMBs is increased in older patients 
with MS and in patients younger than 
50 years with CIS, compared with HCs. 
CMBs are associated with higher risk 
for developing physical and cognitive 
disability in patients with MS.
