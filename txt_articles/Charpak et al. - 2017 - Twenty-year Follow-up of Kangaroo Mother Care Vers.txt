abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a multifaceted intervention for 
preterm and low birth weight infants and their parents. Short- and mid-term benefits 
of KMC on survival, neurodevelopment, breastfeeding, and the quality of mother–infant 
bonding were documented in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Colombia 
from 1993 to 1996. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the persistence of these 
results in young adulthood.
METHODS: From 2012 to 2014, a total of 494 (69%) of the 716 participants of the original RCT 
known to be alive were identified; 441 (62% of the participants in the original RCT) were 
re-enrolled, and results for the 264 participants weighing ≤1800 g at birth were analyzed. 
The KMC and control groups were compared for health status and neurologic, cognitive, 
and social functioning with the use of neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and behavioral 
tests.
RESULTS: The effects of KMC at 1 year on IQ and home environment were still present 20 years 
later in the most fragile individuals, and KMC parents were more protective and nurturing, 
reflected by reduced school absenteeism and reduced hyperactivity, aggressiveness, 
externalization, and socio-deviant conduct of young adults. Neuroimaging showed larger 
volume of the left caudate nucleus in the KMC group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that KMC had significant, long-lasting social and behavioral 
protective effects 20 years after the intervention. Coverage with this efficient and 
scientifically based health care intervention should be extended to the 18 million infants 
born each year who are candidates for the method.

WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Kangaroo 
mother care (KMC) is an intervention for preterm 
and low birth weight infants. Short- and mid-term 
benefi
 ts of KMC on survival, neurodevelopment, 
and the quality of mother–infant bonding were 
documented in a randomized controlled trial in 
1993–1996.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study indicates 
that KMC had signifi
 cant, long-lasting social and 
behavioral protective effects 20 years after the 
intervention in adolescence and young adulthood. 
Coverage with this effi
 cient, scientifi
 cally based 
health care intervention should be extended.

Low birth weight (defined as weight 
<2500 g) was the direct or associated 
cause of death in 44% of the 
estimated 2 763 000 neonatal deaths 
worldwide in 2013. 
1 According to the 
World Health Organization, 10% of 
all births worldwide are either low 
birth weight or premature (ie, birth 
at <37 weeks of gestational age). 
Preterm survivors more frequently 
exhibit neurologic and behavioral 
impairment, 
 
2 and premature or 
low birth weight infants (LBWI) 
later have cognitive deficits, poor 
academic performance, or attention 
problems. 
3 
–5 At school age, they are 
less socially competent and more 
often victimized than their peers, 
 
6 
and, in adolescence, they are more 
often socially rejected and less 
attentive. 
7
Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a 
human-based technique with well-
established short- and mid-term 
effectiveness and safety, suitable for 
use in all settings. It is based on 3 
components: (1) kangaroo position 
(ie, continuous skin-to-skin contact 
between mother and infant), which 
provides appropriate thermal 
regulation, among other benefits; 
(2) exclusive breastfeeding when 
possible; and (3) timely (early) 
discharge with close follow-up. KMC 
was originally developed in Colombia 
as an outpatient alternative to a 
neonatal minimal care unit, in which 
infants remain in an incubator while 
they gain weight. 
8
In 1993 to 1996, our group 
conducted a randomized clinical 
trial (RCT) to compare the original 
KMC intervention and “traditional” 
inpatient care. The trial showed 
that morbidity, mortality, growth, 
development, and other selected 
health-related outcomes were 
at least as good as or better than 
those obtained with usual care 
when infants reached term and at 
1-year corrected age (CA). The main 
short- and mid-term results have 
been reported in international, peer-
reviewed journals.

The 2 main questions addressed 
in the present study were whether 
the documented 1-year benefits 
persisted up to 20 years and whether 
the KMC intervention had a long-
term protective effect against 
cognitive, social, and academic 
difficulties in a randomized block 
of participants who had weighed 
<1800 g at birth.
METHODS
Population and Sample
We followed up a cohort of former 
LBWI who participated in the RCT 
on KMC 20 years previously. The 
participants were infants who 
weighed ≤2000 g at birth, survived 
the transition to extrauterine life, and 
were eligible for neonatal minimal 
care. They were randomly assigned 
to KMC or to the control group 
according to birth weight (≤1200, 
1201–1500, 1501–1800, and 1801–
2000 g). The present study included 
the randomized sample of infants 
weighing ≤1800 g at birth, who 
comprised >90% preterm infants, 
to allow comparisons with other 
follow-up studies.
The study protocol was approved 
by the ethical committee of the 
Pontificia Universidad Javeriana 
and the Univerité Laval. Participants 
were informed and asked to sign a 
consent form. Anonymity of data was 
guaranteed.
Twenty years after enrollment, 
systematic efforts were made to 
contact and re-enroll all former 
LBWI known to be alive at 1 year 
CA. A survival cohort effect was 
anticipated, and more control infants 
than KMC infants died during the 
first year of follow-up, implying 
a possible imbalance of mortality 
and other potential confounders. 
To assess whether the expected 
imbalance between groups could 
bias comparisons in the re-enrolled 
cohort, a Rasch model 
12 was fitted 
to estimate the overall degree of 
vulnerability (fragility index) due 
to factors present before allocation. 
Fifteen unevenly distributed 
binary indicators were selected 
to represent injuries that might 
have occurred during pregnancy, 
birth, or the neonatal period before 
randomization ( 
Table 1). The wide 
span of discrimination estimates 
confirmed use of a 2-parameter 
model, and the goodness-of-fit 
improved (P < .001). The index is 
based on individual factorial scores, 
on the assumption that a common 
latent variable measures the 
nonspecific personal fragility of an 
infant. The fragility indexes of the 2 
groups were similar ( 
Fig 1).
Between January 18, 2013, and 
December 26, 2014, the same 
social worker who coordinated the 
follow-up visits during the original 
RCT traced the participants using 
multiple sources of information 
and located 494 (69%) of the 716 
participants in the original RCT 
known to be alive at 1 year. Of these, 
3 had died after 1 year of age, 11 
were living outside Bogotá, and 
39 refused to participate. The 222 
former participants who could not 
be located were presumed from 
their civil registry numbers to be 
alive. Of the original 433 infants 
who were randomized to treatment 
and weighed ≤1800 g at birth, 264 
subjects (61% of the participants 
who weighed ≤1800 g at birth) 
agreed to participate and were 
re-enrolled ( 
Tables 2 and  
3).
Descriptive analyses confirmed that 
re-enrollment did not introduce 
bias in the distribution of variables 
in the overall population (n = 433) 
or in the re-enrolled sample (n = 
264), with no significant differences 
in the main baseline demographic 
variables, potential confounders, 
or growth or development indices 
( 
Table 4). Some differences were no 
longer statistically significant in the 
re-enrolled cohort because of loss of 
statistical power due to attrition of 
the cohort.

Equally intense efforts were made to 
track KMC infants and control infants. 
Once the participating families were 
identified, telephone interviews 
were conducted to determine the 
vital status of the former LBWI and 
their availability and willingness to 
participate. A first appointment was 
then fixed.
General Procedures
Before measurements were made, all 
the participants were referred to an 
optometrist and a phonoaudiologist 
to ensure that they could participate 
in all tests; glasses were provided or 
adjusted, as needed. The main outcome 
variables at 20 years 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
24 are listed 
in  
Table 5. In the 3-day evaluation, 
each participant underwent a full 
medical examination and a battery of 
psychological and neuropsychological 
evaluations; neuroanatomical, 
functional, and neurophysiological 
assessments; and house visits, with 
collection of complete education and 
work histories.
The exposure was random 
allocation to KMC or traditional 
care 20 years previously. The 
potential confounders were parents’ 
demographic characteristics, 
education, and socioeconomic 
status at the birth of the child, and 
children’s antenatal and perinatal 
anthropometrics and general 
health at birth and during neonatal 
adaptation before eligibility.
Data Processing and Analysis
Data were recorded in a standard 
format both on paper and online. 
Categorical variables were compared 
by using χ2 or Fisher’s exact tests; 
numerical discrete and continuous 
variables were compared in 
parametric and nonparametric tests, 
as appropriate. Alpha P values <.05 
were considered significant.
Bivariate analyses were conducted to 
compare the distribution of potential 
confounders and effect modifiers 
according to exposure and each 
outcome. Stratified and multivariate

analyses were conducted to assess 
confounding and interaction and to 
compute adjusted unbiased estimates 
of effect for each outcome variable. 
Analyses were conducted by using 
SPSS version 19 (IBM SPSS Statistics, 
IBM Corporation) and R version 
3.02 (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria).
For an integrated view of individual 
and grouped multiple outcomes, 
we developed software that allows

RESULTS
Cumulative Mortality at 20 Years
Overall cumulative mortality after 
entry into the study was 24 (5.5%) 
of 433 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
3.4–7.7), with rates of 8 (3.5%) of 
229 in the KMC group and 16 (7.7%) 
of 204 in the control group (odds 
ratio: 0.42 [95% CI: 0.18–1.02]; 
P = .05). After adjustment for weight 
and gestational age at birth, the 
protective effect of KMC against 
mortality was significant (odds 
ratio: 0.39 [95% CI: 0.16–0.94]; 
P = .04).
Overall IQ at 20 Years
No overall or specific differences in 
mean IQ scores were found between 
the KMC (87.5 ± 13.8) and control 
(88.4 ± 13.9) groups at 20 years. 
Measures at 6 months, 12 months, and 
20 years, however, showed small but 
significant differences in the subgroup 
with transient neurologic examination 
results at 6 months’ CA (used as a 
proxy for the fragility index in the 
original RCT), with higher scores for 
the KMC group ( 
Table 6).
 
Table 7 displays the statistically 
significant links between 
modifications due to KMC in 
anthropometrics, maternal stress, 
and the Home Observation for 
Measurement of the Environment 
(HOME) test at 1 year CA and IQ 
at 20 years.
Overall Health Outcomes
The frequency of chronic conditions 
reported at interviews was 
similar in the 2 groups, except for 
hypothyroidism (6.5% in the KMC 
group, 0.8% in the control group)

( 
Table 8). Hypothyroidism was 
associated with birth via cesarean 
delivery (P = .04), admission to a 
NICU (P = .03), birth weight ≤1200 g 
(P = .02), and gestational age at birth 
≤32 weeks (P = .02). Those with 
hypothyroidism tend to have a higher 
fragility index (0.82) than those 
without (0.17) (P = .22). Neurologic 
examinations identified cerebral palsy 
at the same rate in the 2 groups but 
with more motor functional deficit in 
the control group (38% vs 12% in the 
KMC group). Clinical diagnosis of short 
stature at 20 years was prevalent 
in both groups. Of participants with 
intrauterine growth restriction at 
birth (both preterm and term infants), 
47% were short at 20 years, with no 
difference between groups.
Complete information on distant 
and near visual acuity was available 
for 259 participants: 137 of 139 in 
the KMC group and 122 of 125 in

the control group. In optometrics, 13 
(9.5%) of 137 participants in the 
KMC group and 6 (4.9%) of 122 in 
the control group had poor bilateral 
visual acuity (P = .12). Complete 
data from the auditory evaluation 
were available for 264 participants. 
Eight (4 in each group) patients 
had external hearing aids, and 1 
(in the KMC group) had a cochlear 
implant; 9.8% of the cohort had a 
unilateral or bilateral hearing 
deficit (neurosensory or conductive 
lesion).
Schooling, Productivity, Academic 
Record, and Work History
The KMC group had more years of 
preschool (P = .00), but children 
had the same number of years 
of schooling and the same age at 
completion. Fewer members of the 
KMC group had been temporarily 
absent from school (P = .01), and they 
had higher average hourly wages 
(P = .01) ( 
Table 9).
The control group had a significantly 
higher score on “language” in the 
Colombian national examination 
(P = .02), and they received more 
language therapy (21% vs 14.5% in 
the KMC group) during childhood 
than the KMC group. The mathematics 
scores differed significantly between 
the 2 groups (P = .01); they were 
lower in the KMC cohort, especially 
among boys born at ≤32 weeks’ 
gestational age. Nevertheless, of the 
children who had severe bilateral 
neurosensory disorders who 
passed the national examination, 
6 were in the KMC group (67%) and 3 
in the control group (33%).
Family Environment and Social 
Behavior
More KMC children in the cohort 
lived with their parents (P = .01). We 
constructed a variable to evaluate 
paternal support that includes all 
aspects of the father’s participation 
in the care of the infant during 
the first year of follow-up. This 
variable had a positive impact on the 
home environment at 1 year CA. 
11 
Paternal support in the re-enrolled 
sample was the same in the 2 
groups, but the impact depended 
on whether the father had carried 
the infant in the kangaroo position 
during the neonatal period. Three 
of the HOME inventory subscales 
(family companionship, regulatory 
activity, and learning material 
at 20 years) were significantly 
higher in the group in which the

father had carried the infant in the 
kangaroo position, with a clear 
relation between paternal support 
at 1 year and the stability of the 
family 20 years later (score for 
paternal support in families without 
separated parents: 15.3 vs 14.6 for 
separated families, P = .01).
After control for the father’s support, 
the mean total HOME score at 12 
months’ CA was 0.590 for the KMC 
group and –0.235 for the control 
group, indicating a clear advantage for 
children in KMC families. Moreover, 
the 12-month HOME score was clearly 
related to the score at 20 years 
(β = 0.302). Thus, independently of 
paternal support, the families of KMC 
children were more stimulating and 
protective at 12 months, up to 20 
years. The scores at 12 months and 20 
years of the subgroup with transient 
neurologic status at 6 months’ CA 
were significantly higher in the KMC 
group ( 
Table 6). We concluded that 
KMC families were more dedicated 
to their children and that the effect is 
permanent.
We could not directly link children’s 
behavior to the family environment. 
However, the Conners’ scores for 
aggressiveness and hyperactivity 
and for externalization in the Adult 
Behavior Checklist (ABCL) test were 
consistently lower in the KMC group, 
particularly for less well-educated 
mothers, and these children were 
perceived as having less antisocial 
behavior (Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM]) 
than controls ( 
Table 10).
Neuroimaging Results
KMC participants who weighed 
≤1800 g (n = 264) at birth and 
had good-quality nuclear magnetic 
resonance (n = 195) had significantly 
larger cerebral volumes of total 
gray matter, cerebral cortex, and 
left caudate nucleus than control 
participants ( 
Table 11). In a linear 
regression analysis, the volume of 
the left caudate nucleus was clearly 
related to the fragility index at birth 
(the lower the fragility index, the 
larger the volume), duration in the 
kangaroo position (the longer in the 
position, the larger the volume), and 
the result of the fine motor skills 
test (the better the performance, the 
larger the volume) at 20 years.
DISCUSSION
Numerous data were collected in this 
long-term follow-up study 20 years 
after the initial RCT, and only notable 
overall group differences are presented 
here; others will be explored later.
The KMC group had slightly less severe 
abnormal neurologic results than the 
control group, but we cannot separate 
the effects of stimulation by the family 
from a functional or anatomic effect 
of the intervention on the brain. The 
predictive role of head circumference 
at the end of the first year has been 
described elsewhere 
26, 
 
27 and is 
reflected in  
Table 7, which also shows 
its association with IQ at 20 years.
Sensorial (visual and hearing) and 
motor (cerebral palsy) morbidity 
was comparable between the 
groups at 20 years, indicating that 
KMC did not protect children from 
these conditions, as expected. Our 
evaluation of audition and visual 
performance before application of 
the battery of neuropsychological 
tests showed that as much as 56% of 
the cohort needed glasses, and 6.9% 
had bilateral severe hearing loss. It 
is difficult to find normal values for 
these neurosensory sequelae, as they 
are described only for very LBWI 
in the literature. Severe neonatal 
jaundice, ototoxic drugs, neonatal 
hypoxia, and environmental noise in 
neonatal intensive care are all risk 
factors for neurosensory hearing 
loss in these children, who were 
hospitalized in a neonatal unit in a 
developing country in 1990. In both 
groups, the reduced visual acuity 
was mainly myopia and myopic 
astigmatism related to regressive 
and nonregressive retinopathy of 
prematurity and other factors.

The differences in school achievement 
between KMC infants and control 
infants, for both mathematics and 
language, are difficult to explain.

children resemble those of premature 
cohorts described elsewhere. 
30 Very 
LBWI (<1500 g) had more difficulty in 
mathematics, independently of their 
IQ; the lower scores in the KMC group 
were confined to the most immature 
children, who were more numerous in 
this group than in the control group. 
Lower IQ is regularly found in preterm 
infants, mainly in very preterm or 
LBWI. 
31, 
 
32 A large meta-analysis 
indicated that the effect lasted up to 20 
years. 
3 Our study indicates, however, 
a smaller effect in the KMC group, 
particularly for those who were more 
fragile during the first year.
At 20 years, the young ex-KMC 
participants, especially in the poorest 
families, had less aggressive drive and 
were less impulsive and hyperactive. 
They exhibited less antisocial 
behavior, which might be associated 
with separation from the mother at 
birth. 
33 KMC may change the behavior 
of less well-educated mothers by 
increasing their sensitivity to the 
needs of their children, thus making 
them equivalent to mothers in more 
favorable environments.
One of our hypotheses was that 
changes induced by the KMC 
intervention measured at 1 year are 
sustained by anatomic or functional 
changes in the immature brain during 
the neonatal period. Thus, KMC 
might allow better maturation of 
brain tissues and pathways. Studies 
of brain volume and development 
in preterm children have shown 
that premature transition from the 
intrauterine to the extrauterine 
environment can reduce the 
volume of selected cerebral regions, 
particularly motor regions such as 
the caudate nucleus. 
34 The difference 
between groups in the volume of 
the left caudate nucleus is specific, 
because the periventricular location 
of this structure makes it sensitive 
to prematurity. Our KMC cohort 
of vulnerable survivors might 
have undergone compensation or 
plasticity, helping them to increase 
the volume of this brain structure.
Daily activities in the home 
environment have the most direct 
long-term influence on child 
development. 
35 Family changes are 
an obvious effect of KMC, which 
appears to reduce contextual 
disparities and increases the chance 
that a child will be stimulated 
and exposed to a wide variety 
of experiences. KMC seems to 
motivate families to become more 
child-oriented. KMC mothers take 
their children to preschool earlier 
and provide support, as reflected 
in a lower rate of school dropout. 
Fathers’ participation has long been 
recognized as highly positive in 
infants’ social and cognitive growth. 
36 
KMC promotes paternal involvement 
in neonatal care, which affects not 
only the family structure but also 
the environment in which the child 
grows up. In this long-term study, 
fathers’ involvement changed the 
young adults’ cognitive capacity.
CONCLUSIONS
As neonatal technology becomes 
more accessible worldwide, more 
immature infants are saved, with 
fewer severe sequelae; therefore, 
the detection of “minor” sequelae 
becomes important. Such minor 
effects include mild cognitive 
deficits, lack of fine coordination, 
poor hearing, myopia, or attention 
deficit can affect the lives of families 
but often go undetected, especially 
in developing countries. Our long-
term findings should support the 
decision to introduce KMC to reduce 
medical and psychological disorders 
attributable to prematurity and LBW. 
Bogotá’s KMC program was first 
designed for use in stabilized infants, 
who usually remain in a neonatal 
minimal care unit. This period is 
key for brain maturation and early 
attachment relationship. We suggest 
that both biology and environment 
together might modulate a powerful 
developmental path for these 
children, impacting until adult age. 
Introduction of KMC immediately 
after neonatal intensive care, without 
other developmental programs, 
motivates families to become more 
child-oriented and shortens this 
suboptimal period. We hypothesize 
that the results would be even more 
significant if KMC was introduced as 
soon as the infant could tolerate it, 
even in ICUs.
This new knowledge must be used 
to extend KMC coverage to the 18 
million preterm and LBWI born 
each year, 
 
37 who are candidates for 
KMC. We firmly believe that this is 
a powerful, efficient, scientifically 
based health intervention that can be 
used in all settings.
