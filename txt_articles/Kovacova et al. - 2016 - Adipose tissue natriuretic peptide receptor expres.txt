Objective: Cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) bind to two receptors (NPRA-mediator of signaling; NPRC-
clearance receptor) whose ratio, NPRR (NPRA/NPRC), determines the NP bioactivity. This study investi-
gated the relationship of NP receptor gene expression in adipose tissue and muscle with obesity and glu-
cose intolerance. Prospectively, the study also assessed whether changes in NP receptor expression and
thermogenic gene markers accompanied improvements of insulin sensitivity.
Methods: A cross-sectional study of subjects with a wide range of BMI and glucose tolerance (n 5 50)
was conducted, as well as a randomized 12-week trial of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
treated with pioglitazone (n 5 9) or placebo (n 5 10).
Results: NPRR mRNA was significantly lower in adipose tissue of subjects with obesity when compared
with lean subjects (P � 0.001). NPRR decreased with progression from normal glucose tolerance to
T2DM (P < 0.01) independently of obesity. Treatment of subjects with T2DM with pioglitazone increased
NPRR in adipose tissue (P � 0.01) in conjunction with improvements in insulin sensitivity and increases of
the thermogenic markers PPARc coactivator-1a and uncoupling protein 1 (P � 0.01).
Conclusions: Decreased adipose tissue NPRR was associated with obesity, glucose intolerance, and
insulin resistance. This relationship was not observed for skeletal muscle NPRR. Pharmacological
improvement of insulin sensitivity in subjects with T2DM was tied to improvement in NPRR and increased
expression of genes involved in thermogenic processes.

Introduction
The cardiac peptides atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natri-
uretic peptide (BNP) are best known for their role as key hormones
in cardiorenal homeostasis (1,2). ANP and BNP bind and activate a
membrane receptor, NP receptor A (NPRA), which has intrinsic gua-
nylyl cyclase activity (3,4). The cGMP generated activates protein
kinase G (PKG) resulting in phosphorylation of its targets. Along
with their proteolysis by endopeptidase, one of the physiological path-
ways by which NPs are removed from circulation is via receptor-
mediated internalization by the NP receptor C (NPRC), the so-called
clearance receptor (5). The relative level of NPRA to NPRC is
thought to be a major determinant of NP system activity (6,7).
Almost two decades ago, NP receptors were unexpectedly found to
be expressed in the adipose tissue of both rats (8) and humans (9),
suggesting that there may be a metabolic role for NPs. ANP and
BNP were reported to induce a strong lipolytic effect in cultured
human adipocytes with potency similar to catecholamine activation
of the b-adrenergic receptors (b-AR; ref. 10). Metabolic and cardi-
orenal disorders, often coupled with hypertension, have been associ-
ated with dysregulation of the NP system at the level of the

 circulating peptides (11) and the signaling pathways mediating their
biological effects (12). For example, in large-scale studies of sub-
jects from the Framingham Heart Study, plasma levels of NPs were
lower in subjects with obesity (13) and those with metabolic risk
factors (14).
Recently, we showed that NPs can activate a brown fat gene expres-
sion pattern to increase energy expenditure (15). In human adipocytes
and animal models, similar to the process driven by b-AR agonists,
NPs promote transcriptional regulation of genes involved in mito-
chondrial biogenesis and uncoupled respiration, such as PPARc
coactivator-1a (PGC-1a) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1; ref. 15).
NPs have also been reported to enhance fat oxidation in human skele-
tal muscle myotubes (16). Consistent with these cell culture studies,
mice overexpressing BNP or PKG had increased PGC-1a and PPARc,
mitochondrial biogenesis, and fat oxidation in skeletal muscle and
were resistant to diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance (12).
To translate these findings into humans, we compared the expression
of NPRA and NPRC in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle from sub-
jects with normal weight and subjects with obesity who exhibited a
range of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. We also prospec-
tively investigated whether an intervention that improves insulin sen-
sitivity changed the expression of NP receptors, the NPRA/NPRC
ratio (NPRR), and the expression of thermogenic marker genes.
Methods
Design of clinical studies
Two distinct populations were investigated: 1) a cross-sectional
study of subjects with a wide range of BMI and glucose tolerance,
and 2) a cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
treated
with
pioglitazone
or
placebo
(ClinicalTrials.gov
#NCT00656864). All aspects of the studies were approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of Florida Hospital (study 1) and the
University of Vermont (study 2). All study participants provided
written informed consent prior to participation.
Study 1: Cross-sectional study.
We initially performed a cross-
sectional study of 50 subjects (32 females and 18 males) with a
wide range of BMI (18.3-60.3 kg/m2) who were weight stable (<
3 kg change in the 8 weeks prior to study). Subjects were divided
according to BMI into two groups: 24 subjects with normal weight
(Lean; BMI � 25 kg/m2) and 26 subjects with obesity (Obese;
BMI � 30 kg/m2; Table 1). Subjects were further categorized
according to their glucose tolerance status (based on historical diag-
nosis, glucose tolerance test, and HbA1C) into three groups: normal
glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose metabolism (IGM), and
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Percutaneous needle biopsies of
subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT) and the vastus later-
alis muscle were performed to obtain tissue samples for analysis.
Biopsies of SAAT were performed on the right or left lower quad-
rant using a Mercedes Liposuction needle (Miami Fat Supply, Sun-
rise, FL, USA). Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed on the
right leg using the Bergstrom technique (Millennium Surgical Corp.,
Narbeth,
PA, USA).
Detailed phenotyping of
the
participants
included the following: anthropometric measures (weight, height,
and waist circumference), fasting glucose and lipid profile, body
composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
using a GE Lunar iDXA whole-body scanner (Lunar iDEXA, GE,
Madison, WI, USA), and resting metabolic rate and respiratory quo-
tient measured using a MAX-II metabolic cart with a canopy attach-
ment (AEI Technologies, Pittsburgh PA, USA). On separate days, a
standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an intravenous
glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were performed.
Study 2: Interventional study.
Nineteen subjects (11 females
and
8
males,
BMI 5 34.8 6 8.4)
with
well-controlled
T2DM
(HbA1C < 7%) on diet and exercise (n 5 7) or a stable dose of met-
formin (n 5 12, MET) were recruited for a randomized, double-
blind, and placebo-controlled study. Subjects underwent an OGTT
and SAAT biopsy at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with
placebo (n 5 10) or pioglitazone (45 mg/day; n 5 9) using methods
described for study 1. The primary endpoint was changes in NP
receptor expression (as a ratio of NPRA and NPRC, i.e., NPRR) in
SAAT of subjects with T2DM treated with pioglitazone when com-
pared with controls. With the final sample size of nine subjects in
the active treatment group and ten subjects in the control group, the
study had >90% power to detect 40% difference in NPRR using a
two-sided test.
Blood analyses
Fasting blood samples were collected after an overnight fast in tubes
containing EDTA, and plasma was frozen at 2808C until analyses.
HbA1C was measured on a COBAS INTEGRA 800 (Roche

 Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) automated analyzer, and serum
insulin was measured using the MSD Human Insulin Assay (Meso
Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA). Blood glucose concentra-
tions were measured using YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose and L-Lac-
tate Analyzer (YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA).
Plasma N-terminal fragment of proBNP (NT-proBNP) was measured
by the MSD Human NT-proBNP Assay (Meso Scale Discovery,
Rockville, MD, USA). BNP was measured in plasma samples using
the Alere Triage BNP Test on an Alere TriageV
R MeterPro (Alere,
Waltham, MA, USA). Homeostasis model assessment of the insulin
resistance index (HOMA-IR) was calculated as follows: [(fasting
insulin in mU/l) 3 (fasting glucose in mmol/l)/22.5] (17). Quantita-
tive insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was calculated using
the inverse of the sum of the logarithms of the fasting insulin and
fasting glucose (18). Data from the IVGTT were used to calculate
the insulin sensitivity index (Si) using the Minimal Model method
of Bergman (MINMOD-Millennium,V
C R. Bergman; ref. 19).
Gene expression analysis
Total RNA from adipose tissue was isolated using an RNeasy Lipid
Tissue Mini kit and from skeletal muscle tissue using RNeasy
Fibrous Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthe-
sized with a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and mRNA levels were measured
by quantitative real-time PCR using a ViiATM 7 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems) with TaqManV
R
Gene Expression
Assays (Applied Biosystems; Supporting Information Table SR1).
GAPDH, cyclophilin B, and 18S were used as endogenous controls
for adipose tissue; and GAPDH and RPLPO (large ribosomal pro-
tein) were used for muscle gene expression.
Western blotting
Samples of SAAT (100 mg) from four lean subjects, four subjects
with obesity, and six subjects with T2DM from the cross-sectional
study (study 1) were used to measure NPRA and NPRC proteins.
Adipose tissue was homogenized and sonicated in buffer containing
25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM
EGTA, 5 mM glycerophosphate, 0.9% Triton X-100, 0.1% IGEPAL
CA630, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 10% glycerol, with com-
plete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). A total of 50
mg protein was resolved in 10% Tris-glycine gels, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and incu-
bated overnight at 48C with primary antibodies against NPRA
(#31333; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), NPRC (#31365;
Novus Biologicals), or b-actin (#75186; Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA). Secondary antisera conjugated with either alkaline phospha-
tase or HRP were used for detection. NP receptor quantification nor-
malized to b-actin was performed using ImageJ software.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means 6 SEM. Data were analyzed with Sta-
tistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA) and presented using GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The normality of the distribution of
each variable was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Correlation
analyses were performed by calculating Pearson’s correlation coeffi-
cients, and a step-down Bonferroni procedure was used to control
the familywise error rate. Differences between groups were analyzed
by t-test. One-way ANCOVA with post hoc group comparisons
using the Tukey-Kramer adjustment were used to determine specific
differences across groups. Repeated-measures analyses with post hoc
step-down Sidak adjustment for multiple comparisons were used to
examine main effects and their interactions. Power was calculated
using The POWER Procedure with SAS (SAS Institute) for paired
means. Significant differences were set at P < 0.05.
Results
Study 1: Cross-sectional study
The main clinical characteristics of the subjects are summarized in
Table 1. As expected, subjects with obesity exhibited features of
IGM (higher levels of fasting plasma glucose and insulin) and dys-
lipidemia (higher triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol) and were
more insulin resistant than subjects with normal weight. NPRA gene
expression in SAAT was significantly lower in subjects with obesity
when compared with subjects with normal weight, with the reverse
relationship for NPRC levels (P � 0.0001 and P 5 0.0004, respec-
tively; Figure 1A). There were no differences in the expression levels
of either receptor between males and females or after adjusting for
age. In addition to the BMI, the mRNA levels of both NP receptors
correlated with other measures of adiposity such as body fat distribu-
tion (waist circumference) and body composition (fat mass from
DXA), as well as measures of lipid metabolism (triglycerides and
HDL cholesterol) and glucose metabolism (HbA1C and HOMA-IR;
Table 2). In relation to glucose tolerance, there was a decrease of
NPRA and an increase of NPRC transcripts in adipose tissue of sub-
jects with T2DM when compared with subjects with NGT (Figure
1B). There were no differences in muscle NPRA and NPRC mRNA
levels between the BMI groups (NPRA: 0.81 6 0.08 vs. 0.75 6 0.06;
NPRC: 0.46 6 0.12 vs. 0.56 6 0.22 for LEAN vs. OBESE) or glucose
tolerance groups (NPRA: 0.74 6 0.05, 0.84 6 0.15, and 0.81 6 0.08;
NPRC: 0.63 6 0.25, 0.38 6 0.12, and 0.37 6 0.09 for NGT, IGM, and
T2DM, respectively). To verify the mRNA expression data from adi-
pose tissue, we measured NPRA and NPRC protein levels by Western
blot analysis from lysates of SAAT from the LEAN and OBESE
cohorts with NGT versus individuals with T2DM (Figure 1C). As
shown in Figure 1D, we observed a significant reduction in NPRA
levels in the OBESE and T2DM cohort relative to the LEAN cohort,
whereas NPRC was increased in the OBESE cohort.
The relative ratio of NPRA to NPRC mRNA levels (NPRR), which
determines the strength of NP signaling (6), was significantly lower in
T2DM when compared with NGT and IGM (T2DM vs. NGT,
P 5 0.008; T2DM vs. IGM, P 5 0.003). Irrespective of BMI, levels of
NPRA and NPRC in adipose tissue and their relative ratio were highly
correlated with the insulin Si assessed by the IVGTT (Figure 2A-C).
Within this cohort, the subject with the highest Si (5 15.8) appears to
be an outlier but may represent a small percentage of subjects in the
overall population. Excluding this subject did not change the results
(NPRA: r 5 0.640, P < 0.001; NPRC: r 5 20.383, P 5 0.012; NPRR:
r 5 0.584, P < 0.001; and PGC-1a: r 5 0.613, P < 0.001).
PGC-1a is a transcriptional coregulator that is a master driver of
mitochondrial biogenesis and enriched in tissues with high oxidative
metabolism (20). In response to NP signaling, its expression is
increased in adipocytes (15). We found that independent of age and
gender, PGC-1a mRNA was lower in the adipose tissue of subjects

 with obesity versus normal-weight individuals (P < 0.001). This ratio
was also strongly correlated with insulin sensitivity (Figure 2D) and
remained significant after the adjustment for measures of adiposity
(total body fat mass: r 5 0.376, P 5 0.024; waist circumference:
r 5 0.335, P 5 0.046). PGC-1a transcripts in adipose tissue showed
a significant positive correlation with NPRA mRNA (r 5 0.697,
P < 0.001)
and
a
negative
correlation
with
NPRC
mRNA
(r 5 20.468, P 5 0.0015). These results are consistent with the

BMI groups (LEAN and OBESE) and (B) glucose tolerance groups (NGT, IGM, and T2DM). (C) Lysates of human subcutaneous adipose from four LEAN

 notion that improved NP signaling is accompanied by enhanced
respiratory ability in adipose tissue.
There were no significant differences in plasma levels of BNP or
NT-proBNP between our cohort of LEAN and OBESE (Figure 3A)
or between glucose tolerance groups. This is most likely due to the
small sample size of the current study when compared with prior
studies (11,13,14). However, even with this small number of sub-
jects plasma, BNP levels were negatively correlated with fasting
glucose
(r 5 20.456,
P 5 0.013)
and

(r 5 20.559,
P 5 0.0016) and positively correlated with resting energy expendi-
ture (REE FFM; r 5 0.411, P 5 0.037).
Study 2: Interventional study
The main clinical characteristics of the subjects at baseline and after
treatment with placebo or the PPARc agonist pioglitazone are summar-
ized in Table 3. As expected, treatment with pioglitazone improved
fasting insulin, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and QUICKI, whereas no
significant changes were observed in subjects on placebo. Pioglitazone-
treated subjects gained more weight than those on placebo (P 5 0.007),
as is well established for this therapy (21). Treatment with pioglitazone
was associated with significantly lowered levels of NPRC mRNA in
adipose tissue (P 5 0.046), along with a tendency toward increased
NPRA gene expression (P 5 0.068; Figure 4A and 4B). Together with a
favorable shift in NPRR (P < 0.01; Figure 4C), the pioglitazone-treated
group showed a significantly higher level of PGC-1a mRNA in adipose
tissue (P 5 0.002; Figure 4D) and increased UCP-1 gene expression
(P 5 0.0015; Figure 4E), whereas no such changes were found in the
placebo group. These effects were independent of gender, metformin,
total fat mass, or changes in BMI. Plasma levels of BNP and NT-
proBNP did not change after pioglitazone treatment (Figure 3B).
Discussion
More than a decade ago, ANP was shown to stimulate lipolysis in
human adipocytes in a manner similar to the catecholamines (10).

ured in fasting plasma samples and compared between (A) BMI groups (LEAN and OBESE) in the cross-
sectional study and (B) at baseline (PRE) and after 12 weeks of treatment (POST) with PLACEBO or PIOGLI-
TAZONE in the interventional study.

 Other studies reported increased lipid mobilization and postprandial
fat oxidation when NPs were infused acutely into subjects (22,23).
Recently, and again similar to the catecholamines, we showed that
NPs affect energy balance by stimulating the amount and activity of
brown adipocytes (6). We illustrated the importance of the relative
amounts of NPRA to NPRC in metabolism and obesity in mice lack-
ing one or the other of these receptors. Npra2/2 mice have
increased adiposity, whereas Nprc2/2 mice have reduced fat mass
and express higher levels of brown adipocyte markers (15). Alto-
gether, these findings suggested that the ratio of NPRA to NPRC is
a key component in the ability of NPs to regulate metabolic activity
and energy expenditure (15). These intriguing findings prompted us
to examine NP receptor expression as well as downstream targets in
adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in humans with a range of obesity
and glucose intolerance.
Our results show that in the SAAT of subjects with obesity, the ratio
of NPRA to NPRC was shifted toward reduced NPRA and increased
NPRC expression when compared with that in the lean group. Inter-
estingly, we also found that when subjects were categorized by their
degree of glucose tolerance, there was a decline in adipose tissue
NPRA and an increase in NPRC levels from NGT to T2DM. Con-
sistent with this, our findings also show that NP receptor in adipose
tissue was strongly associated with insulin sensitivity. Notably, 12
weeks of treatment with pioglitazone significantly increased the
NPRA/NPRC ratio in parallel with improvements in insulin sensitiv-
ity in patients with T2DM. Thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone
bind and activate PPARc in adipocytes initiating a series of tran-
scriptional changes that influence insulin sensitivity, adiponectin
secretion, and promote fat deposition (21).
In parallel with the differences in the NPRA/NPRC ratio in both the
cross-sectional and intervention study, we found differences in the
expression of the important transcriptional coregulator PGC-1a in adi-
pose tissue. PGC-1a was lower in adipose tissue of subjects with obe-
sity when compared with subjects with normal weight, similar to find-
ings in adipose tissue of subjects with morbid obesity (24); however,
no difference in PGC-1a gene expression levels was found in muscle
in the two groups. In the subjects with T2DM treated with pioglita-
zone, we found increases in PGC-1a, as well as increased expression
of UCP-1. Although we cannot directly ascribe these changes in
PGC-1a and UCP-1 to changes in NP signaling, they are consistent
with our previous data in human adipocytes and in mouse models
(15) and fit well with the fact that reduced levels of PGC-1a are
related to markers of insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk (25).
Earlier studies with mouse adipocytes reported that insulin dose-
dependently and reciprocally regulated the expression of NP recep-
tors by reducing NPRA expression while increasing NPRC (7), and
it was suggested that this was part of the mechanism by which insu-
lin may efficiently promote lipogenesis in adipocytes and reduce the
lipolytic action of NPs. In humans, insulin levels have been corre-
lated with NPRC expression in the subcutaneous fat of subjects with
obesity (26). In addition, NPRC expression was found to be higher
in adipose tissue of hypertensive subjects with obesity when com-
pared with lean controls (27). In our study, we observed a more pro-
nounced effect of pioglitazone treatment on NPRC levels. However,
at this point, it would be premature to make any conclusions about
the cause and effect between insulin sensitivity and NPRC levels.
The increase in levels of NPRC in adipose tissue in the obese state
has led to speculation that adipose tissue might be a site of NP
clearance and contribute to observed reductions in circulating levels
of NPs in plasma in obesity and impaired NP responses (13,14,28).
Although we did not observe significant differences in either BNP
or NT-proBNP in plasma of subjects within the different BMI

 groups or among the glucose tolerance groups, this is most likely due
to the small sample size of our cohorts, which is a limitation of our
study. For example, in the study by Wang et al. (13), they had �1,000
subjects in each of the lean versus overweight versus obese cohort,
from which they detected a significant difference in BNP levels (18.4
vs. 15.9 vs. 14.8 pg/mL, respectively). Similarly, in another large-
scale study of �1,700 randomly selected subjects from a general popu-
lation, a relative deficiency of circulating NPs with a counter-
regulation by higher aldosterone levels was recognized and associated
with cardiorenal and metabolic disease and increased mortality (11).
Although levels of BNP in our study were not different, the more
important functional consequence in obesity may be the reduced
NPRA/NPRC ratios in adipose tissue. As shown in the case of mice
lacking NPRC (29), there need not be significant changes in circulat-
ing levels to affect activity. Total levels of ANP and BNP between
wild-type and Nprc2/2 mice were not different; instead, the circulat-
ing half-life of ANP in Nprc2/2 mice was significantly longer (29).
Nevertheless, these mice have remarkable increases in brown adipo-
cytes in their white fat depots (15), resist diet-induced obesity, and
retain improved insulin sensitivity (unpublished observations).
We investigated the subcutaneous fat depot, but not other adipose
depots such as intra-abdominal. Adipose tissue depots differ in their
morphology, physiology as well as activity and may have distinct
responses to various stimuli (30) and can differ between species. For
example, in mice, the subcutaneous white adipose depot is more
highly susceptible to “browning” processes in response to conditions
such as cold, b-adrenergic agonists or other hormonal stimuli than a
commonly studied visceral depot in mice such as epididymal (31-
33). Despite this limitation, we found that human subcutaneous adi-
pose tissue exhibits marked changes in components of the NP path-
way with respect to obesity and T2DM, specifically, changes in the
expression levels of the NP receptors and downstream genes that are
regulated by their activation.
In conclusion, our study supports the hypothesis that the cardiac NP
system is dysregulated in obesity, insulin resistance, and T2DM.
Although we do not know whether the reciprocal regulation of
NPRA and NPRC levels in human subcutaneous adipose tissue in
subjects with normal weight and individuals with obesity is a cause
or a consequence of their insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic
status, studies in animal models suggest that activation of the NP
system in adipocytes can directly impact energy metabolism and
insulin sensitivity (15). Thus, the NP receptors and the ability to
convey the NP signal to target cells via NPRA raise the question as
to whether they represent a novel pathway for interventions targeting
metabolic disorders, including obesity and insulin resistance, in
addition to cardiorenal conditions.O
