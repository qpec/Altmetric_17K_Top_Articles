Abstract
Background: Twenty-four hour nursing care involves shift work including 12-h shifts. England is unusual in
deploying a mix of shift patterns. International evidence on the effects of such shifts is growing. A secondary
analysis of data collected in England exploring outcomes with 12-h shifts examined the association between shift
length, job satisfaction, scheduling flexibility, care quality, patient safety, and care left undone.
Methods: Data were collected from a questionnaire survey of nurses in a sample of English hospitals, conducted as
part of the RN4CAST study, an EU 7th Framework funded study. The sample comprised 31 NHS acute hospital Trusts
from 401 wards, in 46 acute hospital sites. Descriptive analysis included frequencies, percentages and mean scores
by shift length, working beyond contracted hours and day or night shift. Multi-level regression models established
statistical associations between shift length and nurse self-reported measures.
Results: Seventy-four percent (1898) of nurses worked a day shift and 26% (670) a night shift. Most Trusts had a
mixture of shifts lengths. Self-reported quality of care was higher amongst nurses working ≤8 h (15.9%) compared
to those working longer hours (20.0 to 21.1%). The odds of poor quality care were 1.64 times higher for nurses
working ≥12 h (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.18–2.28, p = 0.003).
Mean ‘care left undone’ scores varied by shift length: 3.85 (≤8 h), 3.72 (8.01–10.00 h), 3.80 (10.01–11.99 h) and were
highest amongst those working ≥12 h (4.23) (p < 0.001). The rate of care left undone was 1.13 times higher for
nurses working ≥12 h (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06–1.20, p < 0.001).
Job dissatisfaction was higher the longer the shift length: 42.9% (≥12 h (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.17–1.95, p = .001);
35.1% (≤8 h) 45.0% (8.01–10.00 h), 39.5% (10.01–11.99 h).
Conclusions: Our findings add to the growing international body of evidence reporting that ≥12 shifts are associated
with poor ratings of quality of care and higher rates of care left undone. Future research should focus on how 12-h
shifts can be optimised to minimise potential risks.

 Background
This study was a secondary analysis of data collected in
England as part of the RN4Cast study, exploring the risk
of negative outcomes with nurses working 12 h shifts.
Specifically, we sought to establish whether there was an
association between shift length and reported outcomes:
nurse job satisfaction, satisfaction with work flexibility,
care quality, patient safety, and care left undone. This
paper is based on a report published to the research
funder, NHS England [1]. This report is available online
via the web, but was neither peer reviewed nor widely
disseminated and should be viewed as a report to the
funder and not an academic publication.
The provision of 24-h nursing care involves shift work,
including “long days” or 12-h shifts [2, 3]. Historically,
shift patterns were based on three eight-hour shifts per
day [4, 5] but over the past 20 years there has been a
tendency to move towards the 12-h shift [6, 7]. In the
last few decades, an increasing number of NHS hospitals
in England started to utilise 12-h shifts in the belief that
it is a more cost effective way of providing 24-h care,
with fewer overlaps between shifts, offering greater con-
tinuity of staffing over day and night [8]. However,
claims of financial benefits of 12-h shifts by NHS Trust
Boards are made in the absence of economic evaluations.
Furthermore, some nurses prefer to work longer daily
hours with fewer shifts, giving them greater flexibility
and more days away from work [9–11]. As the majority
of the nursing workforce is female, this may also make it
easier to balance work and personal responsibilities but
long days may carry hidden costs for staff and patients
[11, 12].
However, some employers are increasingly concerned
over potential threats to patient safety and quality of care
and are choosing to revert to eight-hour shifts [13, 14].
Although the handover period has been criticised for
being unproductive, with no formal ‘overlap’
, 12-h shifts
can have a negative impact on opportunities for ward
meetings, teaching, mentorship, teambuilding and re-
search [15, 16]. A study by Stimpfel and colleagues
found that nurses who worked shifts of 12-h or longer
were significantly more likely to report poor quality
care and poor patient safety when compared to those
working eight-hour shifts [17]. Furthermore, a study in-
cluding the patients’ perspective reported lower satis-
faction with care in hospitals where staff worked longer
shifts [18]. A recent systematic review of error rates
among nurses found evidence of a higher risk of mis-
takes when working a 12 h shift compared to shorter
shifts (most of the studies used 8 and 12 h as cut-off
points) [19].
The shift length argument has been explored by other
occupational sectors than nursing and experts believe
that fatigue associated with long shifts played a major
role in the unfolding of disasters such as the Chernobyl
nuclear accident, Three Mile Island incident and the
grounding of the Exxon Valdez [20] A systematic review
by Smith and colleagues compared eight and 12-h shifts
across a broad range of industries and concluded that
working longer shifts without sufficient rest between
shifts may increase fatigue and, therefore, pose a threat
to safety [21]. However, research beyond health is
equivocal and some studies have found little differences
in terms of cost or productivity [22] or levels of fatigue
[23] by shift length.
In nursing, Geiger-Brown and Trinkoff collated evi-
dence on 12-h shifts and concluded that long shifts are
unsafe for both patients, in terms of medication errors
and for nurses, who are at greater risk of musculoskeletal
diseases, needle stick injuries and drowsy driving behav-
iour [13]. Estabrooks and colleagues reviewed 12 studies
comparing the effect of eight and 12-h shifts on quality of
care and health care provider outcomes. They found insuf-
ficient evidence to conclude that shift length had an effect
on patient or healthcare outcomes [4].
Two large European cross sectional studies of 31,627
registered nurses concluded that those working shifts of
12 h or longer were more likely to report poor quality of
care, poor patient safety, and higher rates of care left
undone [24] and higher levels of job dissatisfaction,
burnout and intention to leave [25], when compared
with nurses working 8 h or shorter shifts.
Harris et al. reviewed 85 studies published between
1973 and 2014 according to five broad themes: ‘risks to
patients’
, ‘patient experience’
, ‘risks to staff’
, ‘staff experi-
ence’ and ‘impact on organisational work’. The review
concluded that the evidence of any clear effect of 12-h
shifts is inconsistent in outcomes and study design [26].
Dall’Ora et al’s scoping review of the effect of shift
work on employees’ performance and well-being synthe-
sised shift patterns across all sectors, not just nursing.
Although some large scale multicentre studies showed
that 12 h shifts are associated with worse staff and pa-
tient outcomes, the authors concluded that most studies
evaluated one single characteristic and failed to take ac-
count of the many complex facets of shift work. It was
not therefore possible to draw firm conclusions as stud-
ies were often confounded by extraneous variables [27].
Current knowledge shows that widespread variation
exists in shift length across the EU. Recent analysis of data
from 12 EU countries (31,627 nurses in 2170 medical/sur-
gical units within 487 hospitals) explored variation in the
shift length nurses work between and within countries,
and within hospitals [24]. Variation in typical shift length
has been observed, with most countries presenting a clear
8 or 12 h shift pattern; England is unusual in presenting a
mixed economy in shift patterns with 32% of day shifts
and 36% of night shifts lasting 12 h or more making it a

 ‘natural laboratory’ for examining the effect of such vari-
ation on outcomes [24].
Data on nurses’ work patterns, including their working
hours are not routinely collected in the UK. However,
analysis of data collected through a series of cross-
sectional surveys of nurses’ employment in the UK indi-
cate that there has been a steep increase in the prevalence
of nurses working long shifts (12-h plus) in NHS hospitals,
from 31% in 2005 to 52% in 2009 [1].
Methods
We used data from a survey of nurses in a random sample
of English hospitals, conducted as part of the RN4Cast
study, an EU 7th Framework funded study of the nursing
workforce covering 12 EU countries and three inter-
national partner countries beyond Europe [1]. The study
sought to examine the relationship between nursing in-
puts and patient outcomes, whilst controlling for other
potentially confounding factors. The study included a sur-
vey of registered nurses in medical and surgical wards in
England. The sample comprised 31 NHS acute hospital
Trusts (administrative groupings of hospitals) from 400
wards, in 46 acute hospital sites. The questionnaire cov-
ered: practice environment, staffing and patient numbers
on the last shift worked, quality and safety measures,
frequency of adverse events, care left undone, job dis-
satisfaction and working hours (including shift length).
The survey was administered in spring/summer of 2010,
2917 registered nurses responded achieving an estimated
response rate of 39%. Ethical approval for the RN4Cast
study in England was sought and gained from the National
Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 09/H0808/69) and per-
missions acquired for the research to be undertaken at
each hospital. Informed consent was obtained from partic-
ipants by completion of the questionnaire, as approved by
the ethics committee.
Measures
Five self-report measures representing care quality, safety
and job and work schedule flexibility satisfaction were
drawn from the survey. Four were converted into dichot-
omous (binomial) variables: poor quality of care nurse rat-
ing (poor/fair), poor patient safety rating (failing/poor),
not satisfied with job (very dissatisfied/a little dissatisfied)
and not satisfied with work schedule flexibility (very dis-
satisfied/a little dissatisfied). A fifth measure of care left
undone was created from a list of 13 activities where re-
spondents were asked: ‘On your most recent shift, which
of the following activities were necessary but left undone
because you lacked the time to complete them’. The num-
ber of activities left undone was counted to produce a
score out of 13.
Analysis
Descriptive analysis was undertaken, measures were de-
scribed using frequencies, percentages and mean scores
(care left undone with 95% confidence intervals) by shift
length, working beyond contracted hours and day (in-
cluding afternoon and evening) or night shift, and a box
plot of shift length by day or night shift. Multi-level re-
gression models were used to establish whether there
were statistical associations between shift length and a
number of nurse self-reported measures of care quality
and job and work schedule flexibility satisfaction, whilst
accounting for other factors and correcting for cluster-
ing within trusts and wards. The potential predictors
identified were: shift length, working beyond contracted
hours, day/night shift, medical or surgical unit, patients
per nurse (grouped in patient increments of two), pa-
tients per HCA (Quintiles), full or part-time work, age
(in ten year bands), Trust size, high (or not) technology
trust, teaching (or non-teaching) trust.
A multilevel logistic model was fitted to each of the di-
chotomous measures, and a multilevel Poisson model to
the number of activities left undone using IBM SPSS
Version 22 GENLINMIXED. The dependent variables
poor quality of care nurse rating (poor/fair), poor patient
safety rating (failing/poor), not satisfied with job (very
dissatisfied/a little dissatisfied with work schedule) were
modelled assuming the data were generated from a bino-
mial distribution. The care left undone score (thirteen
items range 0–13) was modelled assuming the data were
generated from a Poisson distribution.
Each model included random effects for intercepts at
the ward and trust levels. These random effects help to
establish whether significant residual variation remains
between trusts and wards (within trusts) in the model,
after the inclusion of the predictors, and to enable cor-
rect estimation of standard errors in the presence of
clustering. It was not possible to fit random intercepts at
both trust and ward levels for either poor quality of care
nurse rating or poor patient safety rating. We dropped
the trust level random intercept from the former and
the ward level random intercept from the latter to
achieve model convergence.
Results
A total of 2568 nurses (out of 2917) provided informa-
tion on the length of their last shift and whether it took
place during the day (morning/afternoon/evening) or at
night of whom 74% (1898) had worked a day shift and
26% (670) a night shift (Table 1). Analysis at the ward
level showed a high degree of variation in day shift dura-
tions between wards in the same hospitals; most Trusts
having a mix of eight hour shifts, 12-h shifts, and shifts
of a variety of other lengths. Few Trusts have a single

 shift length in operation across or within the wards stud-
ied (see Fig. 1).
In Table 2 the results from the multi-level regression
models are presented. The odds ratios (or in the case of
care left undone the rate ratios) are given, with 95%
confidence intervals comparing each shift length cat-
egory (8.01–10.00 h, 10.01–11.99 h, ≥12 h) with shift
length ≤ 8 h (reference category) adjusting for all other
predictor variables.
The amount of self-reported poor quality of nursing
care was lower amongst nurses working eight hours or
less (15.9%) compared to those working longer hours
(20.0 to 21.1%). Length of shift was significantly associ-
ated with poor quality of nursing care in the multilevel
model (F[3,2314] = 2.95, p = .031). The odds of poor
quality care was 1.64 times higher for nurses working a
12-h or longer shift compared to those working eight
hours or less (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.18–2.28, p = 0.003).
A similar trend was apparent for safety ratings. A
smaller proportion of those working shifts of eight hours
or less rated patient safety as poor (5.7%) than nurses
working a longer shift (6.7 to 7.3%). However, in the
multi-level model, this relationship was not significant
(F[3,2313] = 0.25, p = .86).
Mean ‘care left undone’ score varied by length of shift:
3.85 (≤8 h), 3.72 (8.01–10.00 h), 3.80 (10.01–11.99 h)
and was highest amongst those working 12 h or over
(4.23). This relationship was significant in the multi-
level model (F[3,2326] = 6.37, p < 0.001). The rate of care
left undone was 1.13 times higher for nurses working a
12 h or longer shift compared to those working eight
hours or less (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06–1.20, p < 0.001).
Nurse dissatisfaction with their job varied with length
of shift: 35.1% (≤8 h shift), 45.0% (8.01–10.00 h), 39.5%
(10.01–11.99 h) and 42.9% (≥12 h). This relationship
was significant in the multilevel model (F[3,2318] = 3.46,

account, the odds of being dissatisfied were 1.51 times
higher for nurses working shifts of 12 h or more com-
pared to those working eight hours or less (OR = 1.51,
95% CI 1.17–1.95, p = .001).
There was no clear pattern of variation in dissatisfaction
with work schedule flexibility by length of shift: 21.8%
(<8 h shift), 29.4% (8.01–10.00 h), 23.5% (10.01–11.99 h)
and 27.0% (≥12 h) reported being dissatisfied. When this
relationship was explored in multilevel model, the rela-
tionship was not significant (F[3,2314] = .1.45, p = .23).
Discussion
England is unusual compared with other European
countries in the diversity of shift lengths worked [24].
Our analysis of data from this cross-sectional study
using multilevel regression models found that the length
of shift worked by nurses was a predictor of care rated
as ‘poor quality’. Working 12-h or longer shifts was sig-
nificantly associated with a higher rate of necessary care
being left undone. Nurses working 12-h shifts or longer
reported higher levels of poor patient safety. However,
when taking into account other factors (most notably
staffing levels and working beyond the scheduled shift),
shift length was not a statistically significant predictor of
the overall patient safety rating of the ward.
Our findings add to the international body of evidence
reporting that working 12 h shifts or longer are associ-
ated with poor ratings of quality of care and higher rates
of care left undone [17, 24, 28, 29]. Some studies have
proposed 12-h shifts as a way to improve efficiency [30],
however our study indicates that these long work hours
may compromise care. The premise that 12-h shifts are
cost effective may be contested, as it is unlikely that a
net increase in efficiency can be obtained while 12 h
shifts are associated with an increase in care left undone
with a consequent decline in care quality.
It may be reassuring to note that in our study there
was no significant reduction in safety ratings, but other
research points to contrasting conclusions, with a recent
review describing evidence of the detrimental effects of
long shifts on safety [25]. Furthermore, a US study of
633 nurses reported that inpatient deaths were signifi-
cantly more likely to occur in hospitals where nurses re-
ported schedules with long work hours [31]. If long
shifts have previously shown to impact on mortality
rates, more research needs to be done before concluding
that 12-h shifts are safe or at least carry comparable risk
to shorter shifts.
Anecdotally, nurses’ views of 12-h shifts are mixed;
many are attracted by 12-h shifts as it compresses the
working week into fewer days, allowing more time off
and reducing travel time and costs, but some describe
such shifts as exhausting and are concerned about the
perceived adverse effect on performance [16, 29, 31, 32].
In our study, nurses working 12-h shifts were, how-
ever, no more or less satisfied with their work schedule
flexibility than those working shorter shifts. However,
our results highlight that when nurses are working 12-h
shifts, they were less likely to express satisfaction with
their jobs when compared to those working less than
12 h. The results reveal that when the samples of nurses
are closely matched (all working in same type of ward in
NHS acute trusts) and differences in the working con-
text of nurses working long shifts are taken into account,
nurses are less satisfied with their jobs compared to
those working shifts of 8 h or less. This is in line with
findings from the study by Dall’Ora et al. which also
concludes that such long shifts are associated with job
dissatisfaction. The authors hypothesise that “total life
satisfaction” and “job satisfaction” are two different con-
cepts and, therefore, even if nurses may find working
fewer days appealing for their work-life balance, this
shift pattern may lead to stress and fatigue on the job
[25]. Individual nurses may hold a range of views on 12-
h shifts including personal efficiency benefits in working
longer shifts whilst nonetheless finding them very tiring
and being concerned about the effects of fatigue on their
ability to deliver good patient care.
Limitations
This study relied on cross sectional and nurse-reported
data, similar to the majority of shift length studies. This
may have led to subjective interpretations of the outcome

 measures, for example some nurses may conceptualise
“good quality of care” in a certain way that may not reflect
the same concept for other nurses. The cross sectional na-
ture of the data prevents us from inferring any cause-
effect relationships between shift length and outcomes.
Furthermore, most of the outcomes were captured by a
single item question (e.g. In general, how would you de-
scribe the quality of nursing care delivered to patients on
your unit/ward?). However, the whole picture is likely to
be much more complex than a mean score can illuminate.
Many different features of working patterns are identified
as having a relationship with job performance [25]. How-
ever, in common with many of the studies in this field, this
research has examined a single dimension - shift length
and overtime– without taking into account other features
such as shift sequences, breaks, rest time between shifts
and control over working hours. More research is needed
to understand how these features relate to one another,
and the potential for positive working practices (such as
sufficient rest times) to off-set the negative relationships
reported here.
Conclusions
The decision to introduce, keep, or remove the 12-h
shift is a challenging one for nurse managers. From an
employer’s point of view, a move to 12-h shifts can ap-
pear to reduce short term costs by reducing the overlap
and enabling a reduction in workforce. But very little is
known about either the long term effects on staff sick-
ness absence and turnover or the effects of removing
this period of overlap, which traditionally was a key time
for learning and mentoring to take place for both staff
and students. If 12-h shifts are associated with increased
fatigue and more missed care then productivity can be
lost. None of the studies reviewed included a review of
these effects or provided economic evidence. More re-
search is required in this area.
A key issue of 12-h shifts is that ‘it depends on how it’s
done’. The question we have sought to address has been
‘what are the effects of working 12-h shifts?’ controlling
for other factors. Future research should focus on how
12-h shifts be optimised to minimise the potential risks.
The analysis of data presented here raises a significant
challenge to the assumption that 12-h shifts can reduce
costs without any deleterious effects. In the absence of a
more complete picture of both the effects and the costs
of 12-h shifts, managers should proceed with caution.
