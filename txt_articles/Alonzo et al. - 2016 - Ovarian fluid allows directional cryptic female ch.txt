Ovarian fluid allows directional cryptic female
choice despite external fertilization
Suzanne H. Alonzo1,2, Kelly A. Stiver1,3 & Susan E. Marsh-Rollo2,4
In species with internal fertilization, females can favour certain males over others, not only
before mating but also within the female’s reproductive tract after mating. Here, we ask
whether such directional post-mating (that is, cryptic) female mate choice can also occur in
species with external fertilization. Using an in vitro sperm competition experiment, we
demonstrate that female ovarian fluid (ovarian fluid) changes the outcome of sperm
competition by decreasing the importance of sperm number thereby increasing the relative
importance of sperm velocity. We further show that ovarian fluid does not differentially affect
sperm from alternative male phenotypes, but generally enhances sperm velocity, motility,
straightness and chemoattraction. Under natural conditions, female ovarian fluid likely
increases the paternity of the preferred parental male phenotype, as these males release
fewer but faster sperm. These results imply females have greater control over fertilization and
potential to exert selection on males in species with external fertilization than previously
thought possible.

emale mate choice is a powerful force, capable of driving the
evolution of male reproductive traits1. In species with
internal fertilization, females are known to choose not only
among potential mates before mating (that is, pre-mating female
mate choice), but also among potential fathers after mating
(that is, post-mating or cryptic female mate choice; defined here
as a female-driven bias in fertilization that occurs after mating or
the release of gametes)2–6. It is often assumed, however, that
females in species with external fertilization are limited to
pre-mating choice because a female cannot influence fertilization
when it happens outside of her body. Paradoxically, it is precisely
in these species—where females have limited control over which
males compete to fertilize their eggs—in which selection is
particularly expected to favour cryptic (or post-mating) female
choice7. The open question is whether mechanisms exist that
allow females to bias the outcome of sperm competition
among conspecific males toward a consistently preferred adult
male phenotype even when fertilization is external.
In recent years, mechanisms at the gametic level have been
identified that reduce hybridization and polyspermy in species
with external fertilization8–14. Recent evidence also suggests that
compounds such as ovarian fluid (ovarian fluid, produced by
females and released with the eggs) and gamete-recognition
proteins can bias fertilization toward genetically compatible
conspecific males in species with external fertilization7,13,15–21. In
general, female ovarian fluid has been found to increase sperm
velocity, motility, longevity and chemoattraction18,22–31. Ovarian
fluid has also been shown to mediate sexual selection in one
species with internal fertilization6, suggesting that it could also
affect sexual selection in species with external fertilization7.
However, none of the mechanisms identified to date allow
directional cryptic female choice in a species with external
fertilization and, therefore, also do not generate directional sexual
selection on males within a species3,7,32.
Here, we ask whether female ovarian fluid provides a
mechanism by which females can exhibit directional cryptic
female mate choice—thus exerting directional sexual selection on
adult male traits—even when fertilization happens outside of her
body. To address this question, we performed a series of
experiments that examine how female ovarian fluid affects the
outcome of sperm competition and sperm characteristics in a
species of fish with external fertilization and intense sperm
competition. In the ocellated wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus), three
distinct
alternative
male
types
occur33–35.
Large
colourful
parental (nesting) males build nests of algae, court females and
care for eggs. Smaller non-parental (sneaker) males join a nesting
male and a female during mating, but do not court females or
provide care. Satellite males are intermediate in size and colour,
court females, chase away sneaker males, join the nesting male
and female when they spawn, but do not help with parental
care34. Sneakers and nesting males represent separate life history
pathways determined by early differences in growth35: a slow-
growing juvenile male will be a sneaker in his first breeding
season and a satellite male in his second; a fast-growing male will
be a satellite in his first breeding season and a nesting male in his
second. While it is clear that these alternative phenotypes are not
the result of a simple genetic polymorphism, the degree to which
differences in early growth are environmentally versus genetically
determined is not known. Our experiments therefore focused on
sperm competition between males on separate life history
pathways (that is, sneakers and nesting males), as they are
known to differ in physiology, behaviour, sperm allocation, age
and early growth34–40, and females exhibit a strong pre-mating
preference for nesting males41. Independent of the degree to
which these alternative phenotypes are genetic or condition-
dependent in origin, female mate choice can generate directional
sexual selection on males that affects their evolution and expre-
ssion41,37. Here, we consider if and how directional cryptic female
mate
choice
affects
selection
on
these
alternative
male
phenotypes.
As in most species with external fertilization, a female ocellated
wrasse can control when and where she releases her eggs, but not
which males contribute sperm that compete to fertilize her eggs.
Spawning is demersal: females release a batch of eggs that stick to
the algae of the nest and males release sperm in quick succession
and close proximity to the eggs33,34. Females of this species
consistently exhibit a strong pre-mating preference for nesting
males41,42. Nesting males are older, grow more quickly as
juveniles, provide parental care and have higher reproductive
success than sneaker males35. If nesting males sire offspring
that are more likely to grow quickly, survive and (if male) become
nesting males, a general (or consensus) pre-mating female
preference for nesting males would be adaptive. Yet, females
cannot avoid sneaker males because fertilization is external38.
Selection would therefore likely also favour, if available, a female-
driven mechanism that allows directional post-mating female
choice that favours the paternity of the nesting male phenotype in
this species. Such directional cryptic female choice would exert
sexual selection on these alternative male phenotypes, potentially
influencing their evolution and expression.
Using a series of experiments on the ocellated wrasse, we
examined whether ovarian fluid provides such a mechanism of
directional cryptic female mate choice and asked how ovarian
fluid affects male sperm characteristics and chemoattraction.
In vitro sperm competition trials were used to isolate post-mating
female choice (driven by ovarian fluid) from other factors
affecting sperm competition and fertilization. The ovarian fluid
was either left untouched, removed, or removed and replaced.
Sperm
from
a
sneaker
and
a
nesting
male
were
then
simultaneously added to the eggs, videotaped to determine sperm
number and characteristics, and parentage assigned. These data
allowed us to ask how the presence or absence of ovarian fluid
affected paternity and the relationship between paternity and
sperm number. We performed two additional experiments to
determine the effect of ovarian fluid on sneaker and nesting male
sperm characteristics and chemoattraction.
These experiments show that female ovarian fluid changes the
outcome of sperm competition by decreasing the importance of
sperm number, thereby increasing the relative importance of
sperm velocity. We therefore demonstrate that female ovarian
fluid provides a mechanism by which females can bias the
outcome of fertilization toward certain male phenotypes, even in
species with external fertilization. Such directional cryptic female
mate choice can exert post-mating sexual selection on male sperm
characteristics and reproductive allocation, and thus shape the
evolution of male phenotypes. We further show that ovarian fluid
does not differentially affect sperm from alternative male
phenotypes, but generally enhances sperm velocity, motility,
straightness and chemoattraction. Under natural conditions,
female ovarian fluid likely increases the paternity of the preferred
parental male phenotype, as nesting males release fewer but faster
sperm than sneaker males. ovarian fluid may therefore also allow
females to exert directional cryptic female choice among male
alternative reproductive types and increase the paternity of
nesting males by decreasing the numbers advantage sneaker
males would otherwise have during sperm competition.

 competition between nesting and sneaker males is simply a
numbers game otherwise known as a fair raffle43). A male-driven
fertilization bias (for example, if one male type produces sperm
more able to fertilize the eggs) would be indicated by a significant
effect of male type either on paternity or on the relationship
between relative sperm number and paternity. In contrast, a
significant effect of ovarian fluid treatment on paternity or a
significant interaction between treatment and relative sperm
number indicates a female effect (through the ovarian fluid) on
the outcome of sperm competition among males. In this
experiment, variation in paternity was best explained by variation
in relative sperm number, relative sperm velocity and the
interaction between ovarian fluid treatment and relative sperm
number (Fig. 1, Table 1). There was, however, no main effect of
ovarian fluid treatment on nesting male paternity (Table 1). We
therefore find no evidence that ovarian fluid directly favours one
male type (for example, nesting males) over the other (for example,
sneaker males). Instead, the effect of sperm number on paternity
was significantly different in the absence of ovarian fluid (ovarian
fluid rinsed) than in either treatment with ovarian fluid present
(ovarian fluid baseline and ovarian fluid replaced; Fig. 1, Table 1).
The presence of ovarian fluid therefore reduced the importance of
sperm number on fertilization success. Relative sperm velocity also
had a significant and positive effect on paternity (Table 1), and
nesting males had higher motility and initial sperm velocity than
sneaker males (Table 2, Fig. 2).
The effect of ovarian fluid on sperm characteristics. Having
identified that female ovarian fluid provides a mechanism by
which females can influence male fertilization success, we per-
formed two additional experiments to determine how ovarian
fluid affects nesting and sneaker male sperm characteristics.
Using a paired design, we first compared the sperm character-
istics from either a nesting or sneaker male sperm in both the
presence and absence of ovarian fluid. While ovarian fluid
enhances sperm velocity, motility, linearity and straightness in
general, we did not detect a differential effect of ovarian fluid on
sneaker versus nesting male sperm (Fig. 3). Next, we used a cell
migration assay to ask whether ovarian fluid affects sperm che-
moattraction. This assay examines chemoattraction of sperm
toward the egg along an ovarian fluid gradient by measuring the
number of sperm that swim across a membrane embedded with
pores that mimic the egg’s micropyle8 (sperm must enter fish eggs
via the micropyle to initiate fertilization44,45). While ovarian fluid
increases sperm chemoattraction in general (Fig. 4), we again
found no evidence that ovarian fluid differentially affects nesting
male sperm relative to sneaker male sperm. Thus, while ovarian
fluid enhances the capacity of sperm to make it to the egg (by
increasing
velocity,
motility,
longevity,
straightness
and
chemoattraction), it does not seem to enhance nesting male
sperm characteristics per se (Figs 3 and 4). Instead, it reduces the
advantage of having more sperm, though releasing more sperm is
still weakly associated with higher paternity (Fig. 1, Table 1).
Discussion
Our results show that females—through their ovarian fluid —can
influence the nature and outcome of sperm competition among
conspecific males, even in a species with external fertilization
such as the ocellated wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus). Our results
provide evidence that female ovarian fluid changes the dynamics
of fertilization at the gametic level and suggest a mechanism by
which this might occur. The presence of female ovarian fluid
changed the relationship between sperm number and paternity in
a way that decreases the fitness advantage of greater sperm
production, and thereby increasing the relative importance of
greater sperm velocity (Fig. 1, Table 1). Nesting males had greater
sperm velocity and motility in general (Fig. 2), sperm character-
istics known to be important for fertilization in a variety of
species with external fertilization46–48. Nesting males thus release
fewer37 but higher quality (Fig. 2) sperm. ovarian fluid further
enhances
sperm
velocity,
motility,
straightness
and
chemoattraction for both sneaker and nesting males, which
causes a shift from sperm number to sperm velocity driving the
‘race’ to find the micropyle and fertilize the egg (Figs 3 and 4).
Taken together, these mechanisms allow directional cryptic
female choice among conspecific males to occur at the gametic
level that likely exerts selection on male sperm allocation and
characteristics through their effect on paternity. The differences
between the male types in sperm characteristics and the effect of
ovarian fluid on male sperm characteristics are likely the result of
male adaptation to selection arising from the environment
provided
by
the
female’s
ovarian
fluid
during
sperm
competition.
Such
directional
cryptic
female
choice
could
generate an evolutionary chase between female ovarian fluid
and male sperm characteristics that would only be detected by
detailed study of the mechanisms underlying fertilization49–51.
Under natural conditions, nesting males release fewer sperm
than sneaker males (sneakers release four million sperm per
spawn, while nesting males release only one million per spawn on
average37). This female-driven effect on fertilization and greater
nesting male sperm velocity may help explain how nesting males
father on average two-third of the young in their nest41, despite
being consistently at a disadvantage in terms of sperm number
and experiencing a high risk and intensity of sperm competition

 from sneaker males37. While we found no direct effect of ovarian
fluid on the relative success of alternative male phenotypes, this
mechanism of cryptic female choice would under natural
conditions in this species reduce the one advantage that
sneakers otherwise have during sperm competition.
This effect of ovarian fluid on sperm competition also provides
a mechanism by which a female trait could favour nesting male
paternity—relative to what it would have been in the absence of
this trait—during sperm competition between nesting and
sneaker males. We know that parental males under natural
conditions find themselves on the left side of the graph shown in
Fig. 1 (because they release less sperm), while sneaker males find
themselves on the right side of this graph (because they release
more sperm). This means that the presence of ovarian fluid
increases the paternity of the less common sperm (which under
natural conditions is the nesting male’s) relative to what it would
have been in the absence of ovarian fluid (that is, on the left the
predicted paternity of the male releasing fewer sperm is higher in
the presence than in the absence of ovarian fluid). Given that this
female-driven fertilization bias decreases the sperm number
advantage that sneakers would otherwise have (and thereby
increasing the relative importance of sperm velocity), this
mechanism has the potential to alter selection not only on sperm
allocation and characteristics, but also drive sexual selection
among alternative male reproductive types because ovarian fluid
favours the paternity of parental males relative to what it would
be in the absence of female ovarian fluid.
In contrast to the results reported here, a recent study on
Chinook salmon found no evidence of directional post-mating
female choice among males13. This is somewhat surprising given

 that a female-driven effect of ovarian fluid on male sperm
characteristics
had
previously
been
documented
in
this
species15,29, and the potential fitness benefits of cryptic female
choice in this species21. Study design could explain this difference
in results. These studies13,15,29 examined whether the presence of
female
ovarian
fluid
drove
female
choice
for
genetic
complementarity
(that
is,
non-directional
cryptic
female
choice32). By comparison, our study considered directional
cryptic female choice between two discrete male phenotypes.
Furthermore, selection for post-mating female choice between
nesting and sneaker males is also likely to be strong in the
ocellated wrasse. Female wrasses exhibit a strong pre-mating
preference for nesting males38,42 but cannot avoid spawning with
sneaker
males
because
fertilization
is
external.
A
female
preference for nesting males may have evolved because nesting
males are both older and faster growing than sneaker males in
this species35. Sneakers and nesting males represent two distinct
life history trajectories, though the heritability of the pathways is
not known35. Nonetheless, female traits that increase the fitness
of one alternative reproductive male phenotype over another will
exert sexual selection on the expression of these alternative male
types even if condition-dependent in origin52,53. Female wrasses
may also prefer nesting males because female fitness depends on
male parental care, and higher siring success could select for
greater levels of paternal care by the nesting males, if males
respond directly to paternity41. Strong selection on females to
have their offspring sired by nesting males could therefore explain
why mechanisms have evolved in this species that could allow
directional cryptic female choice by increasing the paternity of
parental nesting males at the costs of non-parental sneaker males
in the ocellated wrasse.
This study shows that female choice after mating can bias
paternity toward preferred males—and therefore drive sexual
selection on conspecific male phenotypes—even when fertiliza-
tion is happening outside of the body of the female. These results
also suggest the potential for sexually antagonistic selection
arising from sexual conflict between females and sneaker males
over fertilization that drive the co-evolution of not only male and
female gametic traits, but could also result in co-evolution
between female ovarian fluid and non-gametic components of the
male phenotype (such as alternative male types and paternal
care)49,50. It remains to be seen whether post-mating female
choice that drives directional sexual selection on males will be
common enough to play a general role in shaping the diversity of
male traits in species with external fertilization. Here, we also find
that the mechanism of cryptic female choice is relatively simple.
Rather than a complex mechanism that favours a specific aspect
of nesting male sperm, ovarian fluid simply reduces the advantage
of releasing more sperm, and therefore likely favours the paternity
of the preferred parental nesting male under natural conditions
indirectly. In general, these results show that females can choose
among males even after mating when fertilization is happening
outside the female’s body.
Methods
Study species and site. Research was performed at the University of Liege Marine
Station (STARESO) and in the Baie de Revellata in the Mediterranean Sea (near
Calvi, Corsica) using SCUBA. During the breeding season (May–June), mating
occurs throughout the day33. Fertilization is external and sperm competition
high36–38. Females choose among nests, but do not remain on a nesting male’s
territory or provide parental care. Conflict over mating exists between females and
sneaker males, as females prefer to mate with nesting males, but cannot fully
control parentage due to external fertilization. One-third of nesting males desert
their nests without providing care, and nesting males that sire more offspring are
more likely to provide care41. All aspects of this research were consistent with the
legal requirements of the country in which the work was carried out, covered by
animal care protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees of Yale University and the University of California Santa Cruz, and
conform to the American Society for the AB/ABS Guidelines for the Use of
Animals in Research. Females, sneakers and nesting males used in this study were
all collected from actively spawning nests from the Baie de Revellata in the
Mediterranean Sea (near Calvi, Corsica). Fish were not reused either within or
between experiments.
The effect of ovarian fluid on sperm competition. To remove behavioural effects
on paternity, we first performed in vitro sperm competition trials (n ¼ 30, 10 per
treatment). In this first experiment, eggs were stripped from a female into a Petri
dish. The ovarian fluid was either (1) left untouched (ovarian fluid baseline), (2)
removed with a 10 ml micropipette and then the eggs rinsed with fresh seawater
(ovarian fluid removed) or (3) removed but added back to the eggs after rinsing as
a manipulation control (ovarian fluid replaced). We collected 2 ml of milt from one
sneaker and one nesting male per replicate and then simultaneously activated each
sperm sample in 1 ml seawater and added 200 ml of the activated sperm solution
from both the sneaker and nesting male simultaneously to the eggs. Each replicate
was done on a different set of sneaker and nesting males, and males were given an
individual mark before release to avoid accidental recapture and reuse within or
between experiments. A 2 ml subsample of the activated sperm of both males was
then added to two different chambers of a 20 mm, four-chamber Leja slide and
videotaped under � 10 negative-phase contrast using a Motic BA310 light
microscope and 60 Hz EIA monochrome RS-170 camera for later analysis of sperm
characteristics. We determined sperm velocity, motility, linearity and straightness
for each male, using a Hamilton Thorne CEROS CASA system. The remaining
sperm samples were preserved in 3% formalin and the number of sperm in a
subsample counted (at � 400 bright-field illumination) later to determine the
concentration of sperm in the sample.

Figure 4 | Ovarian fluid facilitates sperm chemoattraction by sneaker
and nesting male sperm. Nesting male sperm are represented by red circles,
sneaker male sperm by blue triangles. More sperm pass across the
membrane (moving through the micropyle-sized pores) toward ovarian fluid
than seawater alone. Error bars indicate the s.e.m. There is no significant
effect of male type on the number of sperm that cross the membrane
(n ¼ 60, F(1,55) ¼ 1.798, P ¼ 0.185, two-way ANOVA model sperm
number¼ male type � ovarian fluid treatment, using model aov in R). There
was, however, a significant effect of treatment (ovarian fluid and eggs in
seawater versus seawater only) on the number of sperm found below the
membrane (F(1,55) ¼ 6.758 P ¼ 0.012). The interaction between male type
and ovarian fluid treatment was not significant (F(1,55)¼ 0.574, P¼ 0.452).
Male type also did not have a significant effect on the probability that a sperm
crosses the membrane (relative to the total number in the original sample,
based on a general linear logistic regression model: Pr (the number
of sperm above versus below the membrane)¼ male type þ ovarian
fluid treatment; t ¼ � 1.033, P ¼ 0.3061), while the presence of ovarian
fluid treatment significantly increased the probability that a sperm would
cross the membrane (t ¼ � 2.280, P ¼ 0.026, assuming a quasibinomial
distribution of the errors due to overdispersion of the data, using glm with
family ¼ quasibinomial in R).

 The fertilized eggs were covered with seawater, left for 5 min to ensure
fertilization, rinsed with fresh seawater and then held in aquaria with fresh flowing
seawater in 100 mm Nitex plankton netting. The eggs were allowed to develop for
3–5 days (until pigmented eye development) and then preserved in 80% ethanol for
paternity analyses. Small (2 mm2) fin clips were used to genotype adults. Although
a few eggs showed no sign of early development (based on the absence of cell
division), consistent with a failure to be fertilized (perhaps due to egg inviability),
most eggs that showed signs of fertilization developed normally and were collected
for paternity analyses.
Parentage was assigned to either the nesting or sneaker male using
microsatellite-based genetic paternity assignment. DNA from females, nesting
males and sneakers was extracted using a Qiagen DNAeasy Blood and Tissue
Kit, while DNA from eggs extracted using a magnetic-bead-mediated robotic
extraction, performed using Verde Labs Genomic DNA Extraction Chemistry on a
Biosprint96 Extraction Robot. Samples were amplified using six microsatellite loci
developed for S. ocellatus54 (Soc1017, Soc1063, Soc1109, Soc1198, Soc3121 and
Soc3200, Primer sequences are given in the Supplementary Table 1) and previously
used for paternity assignment41. Primer sets were used in combination in a PCR
reaction (multiplexing55), and amplified using a DNA Engine Tetrad 2 Thermal
Cycler from Biorad, set at the following parameters for both triplex reactions: 94 �C
for 120 s; 15 cycles of 94 �C for 30 s, 60–54 �C for 30 s (starting at 60 �C on first
cycle and decreasing by 0.5 �C for each subsequent cycle), 72 �C for 90 s; 23 cycles
of 94 �C for 30 s, 54 �C for 30 s, 72 �C for 90 s; ending 72 �C for 600 s (10 min). PCR
product was run for fragment analysis on an Applied Biosystem 3,730 DNA
Analyzer, visualized and scored using the standard protocol for Genemarker
software from Softgenetics using a bin-set not previously made. Peaks were
evaluated and scored visually by an observer blind to sample identity.
The number of alleles per locus was 17–37 (mean ¼ 25.0), and expected
heterozygosity ranged from 0.73 to 0.90 (mean ¼ 0.87). Combined non-exclusion
probability for the first parent is 0.00185. Nesting and sneaker males were assigned
as the father based on strict exclusion (if a male did not share an allele at each locus
that could be compared, he was excluded as the father). This method has previously
been compared with assignment allowing one mis-match, and assignment rates do
not substantially differ between methods41. Maternal genotype was used to assign a
father when both males were potential matches, and offspring for whom neither
male could be excluded even when consideration of maternal genotype were
excluded from the analysis.
The effect of ovarian fluid on sperm characteristics. In a second experiment, we
compared the effect of ovarian fluid on sperm characteristics. Sneaker and nesting
males were observed, caught and their gametes collected as described above (n ¼ 16
sneaker males and n ¼ 16 nesting males, males were not used more than once
either within or between experiments). For this study, we collected and activated
3 ml of milt from a single male in 0.5 ml of fresh seawater. In all, 2 ml of the activated
sperm were then mixed with 4 ml of fresh seawater or 2 ml seawater and 2 ml of
ovarian fluid from a single female (yielding two samples—either with or without
ovarian fluid —from each male with the same concentration of milt). Two 2 ml
samples of activated sperm from the same male (one with and one without ovarian
fluid from 16 sneaker males and 16 nesting males) were then loaded into two
adjacent chambers of a 20 mm, four-chamber Leja slide, videotaped simultaneously
and analysed using a Hamilton Thorne CEROS CASA system as described above.
Data collection and analysis were therefore paired within individual male (that is,
the data on sperm characteristics in the presence and absence of ovarian fluid were
paired for an individual male).
The effect of ovarian fluid on sperm chemoattraction. In a third experiment, we
examined the effect of eggs and ovarian fluid on sperm chemoattraction using a cell
migration assay modified from earlier work on salmon8 using Corning Transwell
Polycarbonate Membranes with 8 mm diameter pores at a density of 1 � 105
pores cm � 2. Sneaker and nesting males were observed, caught and their gametes
collected as described above. We compared the number of sperm to cross the
membrane with and without ovarian fluid for sperm collected from either a sneaker
or a nesting male (n ¼ 16 sperm from sneaker males with eggs and ovarian fluid,
n ¼ 15 sperm from a sneaker male without ovarian fluid, n ¼ 15 with sperm from a
nesting male with ovarian fluid and n ¼ 13 sperm from a nesting male with only
seawater). Males were not used more than once either within or between
experiments. For the ovarian fluid treatment, eggs and ovarian fluid were stripped
from a female into the bottom cell of a Transwell plate. We added 1 ml seawater to
first the bottom and then the top chamber of the Transwell. We
then collected 3 ml milt from either a sneaker or nesting male and activated the
sperm in the seawater of the upper chamber. After 5 min, we collected the samples
from the top and bottom of the Transwell, noting their volume. These samples
were preserved in 3% formalin, stained with Rose Bengal and their concen-
tration determined later using DRM-600 CELL-VU Sperm Counting Chambers
(disposable cytometers). These data allowed us to estimate the number of sperm
originally introduced above the membrane as well as the number that passed
through the wrasse egg micropyle-sized pores, and whether it depended on male
type or the presence/absence of ovarian fluid and eggs.
Statistical analyses. All analyses were done in R (version 3.2). To determine the
effect of the presence or absence of ovarian fluid on sperm competition and nesting
male paternity (the first experiment), we ran general linear logistic regression
models (assuming a quasibinomial distribution of the errors due to overdispersion
of the data, see Table 1 for full model structure and results)56. We also performed
hierarchical model comparison and found that the best-fit model based on
comparison of the AIC (using anova and AICctab from library bbmle in R). To
compare the sperm characteristics of the nesting and sneaker male pairs used in the
in vitro fertilization trials, we used between-male repeated measures mixed effects
models fit by maximum likelihood (see Table 2 for full model structure and
results). To examine the effect of ovarian fluid on male sperm characteristics (the
second experiment), we used within male (with and without ovarian fluid) repeated
measures mixed effect models fit by maximum likelihood (see Fig. 3 for full model
details and results). To examine the effect of ovarian fluid on sperm
chemoattraction (the third experiment), we used a two-way ANOVA (male
type � ovarian fluid treatment, see Fig. 4 for full model details and results) on the
number of sperm that migrated to the bottom chamber as well as a general linear
logistic regression to examine the probability sperm would cross the membrane to
the eggs (also see Fig. 4 for full model details and results)56.
Data availability. Data associated with this article (that is from the three
experiments) are available from the Dryad Digital Repository: http://dx.doi.org/
10.5061/dryad.1m056 (ref. 58). For the first experiment, the data are information
on ovarian fluid treatment, the number of offspring genotyped, the number of
offspring assigned to the nesting male, the estimated concentration of sperm in the
sample collected from the sneaker and nesting male involved in each cross and
paired data on the sperm characteristics for both males used in each in vitro cross.
The data from the second experiment include male type (sneaker or nesting male),
ovarian fluid treatment (present or absent) and sperm characteristics for each
replicate. The data for the third experiment are male type, ovarian fluid treatment
and the estimated number of sperm above and below the membrane.
