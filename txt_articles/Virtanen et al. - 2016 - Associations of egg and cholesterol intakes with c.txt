ABSTRACT
Background: In general populations, the effects of dietary choles-
terol on blood cholesterol concentrations are modest. However, the
relation is stronger in those with an e4 allele in the apolipoprotein E
gene (APOE). There is little information on the association between
cholesterol intake and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD)
among those with the ApoE4 phenotype.
Objective: We investigated the associations of intakes of choles-
terol and eggs, a major source of dietary cholesterol, with carotid
intima-media thickness and the risk of incident CAD in middle-
aged and older men from eastern Finland.
Design: The study included 1032 men aged 42–60 y in 1984–1989
at the baseline examinations of the prospective, population-based
Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. Data on com-
mon carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) were avail-
able for 846 men. Dietary intakes were assessed with 4-d food
records. Associations with incident CAD and baseline CCA-IMT
were analyzed by using Cox regression and ANCOVA, respectively.
Results: The ApoE4 phenotype was found in 32.5% of the men. During
the average follow-up of 20.8 y, 230 CAD events occurred. Egg or
cholesterol intakes were not associated with the risk of CAD. Each 1
additional egg (55 g)/d was associated with a multivariable-adjusted HR
of 1.17 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.61) in the ApoE4 noncarriers and an HR of 0.93
(95% CI: 0.50, 1.72) in the ApoE4 carriers (P-interaction = 0.34). Each
100-mg/d higher cholesterol intake was associated with an HR of 1.04
(95% CI: 0.89, 1.22) in the ApoE4 noncarriers and an HR of 0.95 (95%
CI: 0.73, 1.25) in the ApoE4 carriers (P-interaction = 0.81). Egg or
cholesterol intakes were also not associated with increased CCA-IMT.
Conclusion: Egg or cholesterol intakes were not associated with
increased CAD risk, even in ApoE4 carriers (i.e., in highly suscep-
tible individuals).

INTRODUCTION
The fundamental feeding experiments by Hegstedt et al. (1)
and Keys et al. (2) led them to conclude that serum total
cholesterol is dependent on dietary cholesterol intake. This no-
tion remained unchallenged for decades. However, over the past
few years, several organizations and expert panels have con-
cluded that there is insufficient evidence on the relation between
dietary cholesterol intake and the risk of cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs)6 in a general population, and in many dietary recom-
mendations the suggestion to limit cholesterol intake has been
discontinued (3–6).
In a general population, dietary cholesterol intake has only
modest effects on serum total and LDL-cholesterol concentra-
tions or the LDL- to HDL-cholesterol ratio and little effect on the
risk of CVD (7). However, certain genetic factors can influence
the effect of dietary cholesterol on serum lipids (8). One of these
is the presence of the e4 allele in the apolipoprotein E (APOE)
gene, a key regulator in cholesterol and lipid metabolism (9).
The APOE gene has 3 different alleles, e2, e3 and e4, which
encode 3 common isoforms (E2, E3, and E4), so there are 6
different ApoE phenotypes: E2/2, E2/3, E2/4, E3/3, E3/4, and
E4/4. Compared with those with the E3/3 phenotype, those with
an e2 allele have lower and those with an e4 allele have higher
total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations (9). The ApoE pheno-
type has been suggested to be one of the strongest genetic factors
that affect serum lipid and lipoprotein variability (10). It has been
estimated to account for as much as 16% of the genetic variation in
serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations (10). One of the suggested

 mechanisms to explain this is the increased intestinal absorption
of dietary cholesterol (11–14), although not all studies have
observed such an effect (8). Therefore, the limitation of cho-
lesterol intake may be more relevant in populations with higher
ApoE4 frequency. The frequency of the ApoE4 phenotype varies
markedly around the world, but Finland has one of the highest
prevalences (15).
Eggs are a major contributor to cholesterol intake, with w200 mg
cholesterol in 1 medium-sized egg. Despite this, egg intake
has not been associated with CVD risk in general populations
(16, 17). However, little is known about whether an e4 allele in
ApoE modifies the association between egg or cholesterol in-
takes and the risk of CVD. We previously observed no associ-
ation of egg intake with the risk of coronary artery disease
(CAD) or carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a predictor of
CVD risk in this study population (18), but found an inverse
association with the risk of type 2 diabetes in the eastern Finnish
men from the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor
Study (KIHD) (19, 20). ApoE4 phenotype did not modify the
associations of egg or cholesterol intakes with the risk of type 2
diabetes (20). In the current analysis we investigated whether
ApoE4 phenotype could modify the associations of egg and
cholesterol intakes with serum lipid profile, carotid IMT, and the
risk of incident CAD.
METHODS
Study population
The KIHD was designed to investigate risk factors for CVD,
atherosclerosis, and related outcomes in a prospective, pop-
ulation-based, randomly selected sample of men from eastern
Finland (21). The baseline examinations were carried out in
1984–1989. A total of 2682 men aged 42, 48, 54, or 60 y at
baseline (82.9% of those eligible) were recruited in 2 cohorts
(Supplemental Figure 1). The first cohort consisted of 1166
men who were 54 y old, enrolled in 1984–1986; and the second
cohort included 1516 men who were 42, 48, 54, or 60 y old,
enrolled in 1986–1989. The baseline examinations were fol-
lowed by the 4-y examination round in 1991–1993, in which
1038 men from the second cohort (88% of those eligible) par-
ticipated. The baseline characteristics of the entire study population
have been described (22). The KIHD protocol was approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of the University of Kuopio. All
subjects gave written informed consent for participation.
The ApoE phenotype was determined from blood samples of
1033 men who participated in the 4-y examinations and from 307
other men from the baseline examinations, for whom blood
samples for phenotyping were available. Among these 1340 men,
subjects with a history of CAD at baseline (n = 302) or with
missing information on diet (n = 6) were excluded, leaving 1032
men for the analyses with incident CAD. Compared with those
without data on ApoE phenotype, those with data on ApoE
phenotype were, in general, healthier and had a more favorable
lifestyle and dietary habits, although their serum lipid and li-
poprotein profile was less favorable (Supplemental Table 1).
Baseline common carotid artery IMT (CCA-IMT) measure-
ments were available for 846 men. After exclusion of the out-
liers (values outside the mean 6 1.5 times the IQR; n = 34),
there were 812 men in the analyses of carotid atherosclerosis.
Assessment of dietary intakes
The consumption of foods at baseline was assessed with
guided 4-d food records, of which one of the days was a weekend
day, by using household measures. A picture book of common
foods and dishes was used to help in estimation of portion sizes.
The picture book contained 126 of the most common foods and
drinks consumed in Finland, and for each food item the par-
ticipant could choose from 3 to 5 commonly used portion sizes or
describe the portion size in relation to those in the book. To
further improve accuracy, instructions were given and com-
pleted food records were checked by a nutritionist together with
the participant. Nutrient intakes were estimated by using the
NUTRICA 2.5 software (Social Insurance Institution). The
databank of the software is mainly based on Finnish values of the
nutrient composition of foods. The egg consumption variable
represents total egg consumption, including eggs in mixed dishes
and recipes.
Assessment of carotid IMT
The extent and severity of carotid atherosclerosis were
assessed by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonographic examina-
tion of the right and left common carotid arteries (CCAs) in a 1.0-
to 1.5-cm section at the distal end of the CCA, proximal to the
carotid bulb, as described earlier (18). Ultrasonographic exam-
inations were conducted by one physician. All of the examina-
tions were performed with the subject in a supine position. IMT,
calculated as the mean distance between the intima-lumen and
media-adventitia interfaces, was estimated at w100 points in
both the right and left CCAs. For the present study, 2 measures
of IMT were used: 1) the mean IMT, calculated as the mean of
all IMT estimates from the right and left CCAs and considered
an overall measure of the atherosclerotic process, and 2) the
maximal IMT, the average of the points of maximal thickness
from the right and left CCAs and indicative of the depth of
intrusion of IMT into the lumen in this part of the CCA. The
variability of the CCA-IMT measurement in the KIHD has been
shown to be relatively low. The interindividual CV was 10.5%
for the first assessments by 4 observers, and the intrareader
variability, described as the mean of the absolute difference
between the first and third observations, was 8.3% of the mean
IMT (18).
Other measurements
Venous blood samples were collected between 0800 and 1000 h
at the baseline examinations. Subjects were instructed to ab-
stain from ingesting alcohol for 3 d and from smoking and eating
for 12 h before providing the sample. Detailed descriptions of the
determination of serum lipids and lipoproteins (23), assessment
of medical history and medications at baseline (23), family history of
diseases (23), smoking (23), alcohol intake (23), blood pressure (23),
and physical activity (24) have been published. Serum C-reactive
protein (CRP) was measured with an immunometric assay (Immulite
High Sensitivity CRP Assay; Diagnostic Products Corporation).
Education was assessed in years by using a self-administered
questionnaire. The ApoE phenotype was determined from plasma
with isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting techniques. Sub-
jects who had the phenotype 3/4 or 4/4 were included in the
ApoE4 group.

 Ascertainment of follow-up events
Data on fatal and nonfatal CAD events from the beginning of
the study to the end of the year 2012 were obtained by computer
linkage to the national hospital discharge and death certificate
registers. Diagnostic information was collected from hospitals
and classified by using identical diagnostic criteria. Each sus-
pected coronary event (International Classification of Diseases,
9th revision, codes 410–414 and International Classification of
Diseases, 10th revision, codes I20–I25) was classified into 1)
a definite acute myocardial infarction, 2) a probable acute
myocardial infarction, 3) a typical acute chest pain episode of
.20 min indicating CAD, 4) an ischemic cardiac arrest with
successful resuscitation, or 5) no acute coronary event by
a physician using the original patient records. Acute coronary
events that did not lead to death during the following 24 h were
considered as a nonfatal event. If a subject had multiple nonfatal
CAD events during the follow-up or a nonfatal event followed
by a fatal event, the first was considered the endpoint.
Statistical analysis
The univariate relations between egg and cholesterol intakes
and baseline characteristics were assessed by means and linear
regression (for continuous variables) or chi-square tests (for
bivariate relations). Associations with carotid IMT and serum
lipids and lipoproteins were analyzed with ANCOVA and linear
regression. Cox proportional hazards regression models were
used to estimate HRs of incident CAD. The validity of the
proportional hazards assumption was evaluated by using
Schoenfeld residuals. The confounders in the analyses were
selected on the basis of established risk factors for CAD, pre-
viously published associations with CAD in the KIHD, or on
associations with exposures or outcomes in the present analysis.
Model 1 included age (y), examination year, and energy intake
(kcal/d). The multivariable model (model 2) included the vari-
ables in model 1 as well as BMI (kg/m2), diabetes (yes or no),
hypertension (yes or no), family history of CAD (yes or no),
smoking (never smoker, previous smoker, current smoker of
,20 cigarettes/d, and current smoker of $20 cigarettes/d), ed-
ucation years, leisure-time physical activity (kcal/d), and intakes
of alcohol (g/d), PUFAs (% of energy), SFAs (% of energy),
dietary fiber (g/d), and fruit, berries, and vegetables (g/d). In the
analyses of carotid IMT, the technical covariate, focusing depth,
was also included. The cohort mean was used to replace missing
values in covariates (,3%). Significance of the interactions on
a multiplicative scale was assessed by stratified analysis and
likelihood ratio tests with the use of a cross-product term. Tests
of linear trend were conducted by assigning the median values
for each category of exposure variable and treating those as
a single continuous variable. All P values were 2-tailed (a =
0.05). Data were analyzed by using SPSS 21.0 for Windows
(IBM Corporation).
RESULTS
The average egg intake was 33 g/d (SD: 26 g/d; w4 medium-
sized eggs/wk), and the mean cholesterol intake was 398 mg/d (SD:
147 mg/d). Cholesterol intake from eggs (mean 6 SD: 110 6
85 mg/d) accounted for 27.7% of the total cholesterol intake.
Fifteen percent (n = 155) consumed at least 1 medium-sized egg
(55 g)/d. Eight subjects did not consume eggs at all, and 3
subjects reported consuming egg whites only. Men with a higher
egg intake were more physically active and less likely to smoke
and to have diabetes (Table 1). They also had higher intakes of
energy, fiber, and saturated fat and a lower polyunsaturated fat
intake. Those with a higher cholesterol intake were younger, less
physically active, and had a lower educational level. They also
had higher intakes of energy, fiber, saturated fat, and mono-
unsaturated fat and lower intakes of carbohydrates and poly-
unsaturated fat.
Among the men, 28.6% had the ApoE 3/4 phenotype and 3.9%
had the 4/4 phenotype (Table 2). During the average follow-up of
20.8 y (SD: 6.5 y), 230 men (22.3%) experienced a fatal or nonfatal
CAD. Compared with the noncarriers, the ApoE4 carriers had
a less favorable lipid profile (Supplemental Table 2). However,
ApoE4 carriers did not have a higher CAD risk after adjustment
for age and examination year (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.31),
and multivariable adjustments did not change the association
(HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.31). Further adjustment for lipid-
lowering medication use during the follow-up (46.0% in the
ApoE4 carriers and 42.2% in the noncarriers) also did not ap-
preciably affect the associations (HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.36).
There were no differences in the mean CCA-IMT (multivariable-
adjusted difference 6 SEM: 0.003 6 0.08 mm; P = 0.67) or
maximal CCA-IMT (difference 6 SEM: 0.004 6 0.011 mm; P =
0.70) between the ApoE4 carriers and noncarriers.
In a model that adjusted for multiple confounders, egg intake
was associated with a generally more favorable lipid profile in
the ApoE4 noncarriers, whereas no associations were found in
the ApoE4 carriers (Supplemental Table 3). For example, egg
intake was associated with a better total to HDL-cholesterol
ratio and LDL- to HDL-cholesterol ratio in the ApoE4 non-
carriers. Total cholesterol intake was not associated with serum
lipids or lipoproteins, except for a trend toward a direct asso-
ciation with serum HDL cholesterol and a trend toward inverse
associations with the total to HDL-cholesterol ratio and the
LDL- to HDL-cholesterol ratio in the ApoE4 noncarriers
(Supplemental Table 4).
There were no significant associations between either egg or
cholesterol intake and CAD risk in the whole study population or
in the analyses stratified by the ApoE4 phenotype (Table 3).
Evaluated continuously, each 1 additional egg (55 g)/d was as-
sociated with a multivariable-adjusted HR of 1.17 (95% CI:
0.85, 1.61) in the ApoE4 noncarriers and an HR of 0.93 (95%
CI: 0.50, 1.72) in the ApoE4 carriers (P-interaction = 0.34).
Each 100-mg/d higher cholesterol intake was associated with an
HR of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.22) in the ApoE4 noncarriers and
an HR of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.25) in the ApoE4 carriers (P-
interaction = 0.81). Adjustment for the use of lipid-lowering
medication during the follow-up did not change the associations
(data not shown). Egg or cholesterol intakes were also not as-
sociated with increased CCA-IMT (Supplemental Table 5).
Because the long follow-up time may attenuate the associa-
tions with the single-exposure assessment at baseline, in the
sensitivity analyses we restricted the follow-up time to the first 10
y. However, we also did not find significant associations with the
risk of CAD with this shorter follow-up time. For the ApoE4
noncarriers (46 CAD events), each 1-egg/d higher intake was
associated with a multivariable-adjusted HR of 1.01 (95% CI:
0.54, 1.87) and each 100-mg/d higher cholesterol intake with an

 HR of 1.08 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.42). For the ApoE4 carriers (30
events), the respective HRs were 1.05 (95% CI: 0.40, 2.75) for
each 1 additional egg/d and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.47) for each
100-mg/d higher cholesterol intake. We also investigated the
associations of egg and cholesterol intakes with CAD risk in
those who did not start using lipid-lowering medications during
the follow-up (n = 584). The consumption of each 1 egg/d was
associated with a multivariable-adjusted HR of 1.13 (95% CI:
0.75, 1.71) in the ApoE4 noncarriers (100 events, 403 participants)
and with an HR of 1.18 (95% CI: 0.52, 2.66) in the ApoE4 carriers
(44 events, 181 participants). For each 100-mg higher cholesterol
intake the HRs were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.23) in the ApoE4
noncarriers and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.45) in the ApoE4 carriers.
DISCUSSION
In this population-based cohort study in middle-aged and older
men from eastern Finland, we found that higher egg or choles-
terol intakes were not associated with the risk of incident CAD or
with carotid IMT in the whole study population or in the ApoE e4
carriers. There is limited evidence on the association between
dietary cholesterol intake and the risk of CVD (7), and although
egg intake has been associated with a higher risk of CVD in
patients with diabetes, no such association has been found in
generally healthy populations (16, 17). Few epidemiologic
studies have investigated the association between egg or cho-
lesterol intakes and subclinical disease (19, 25–27), and only
one study found increased carotid atherosclerosis with higher
egg intake (25). However, in that study, important confounders,
such as physical activity or other dietary factors besides eggs,
were not accounted for (25), which limits the possibility to draw
conclusions on the independent association of egg intake. In
many study populations higher egg intakes tend to be associated
with unhealthy lifestyle and dietary factors, such as smoking,
lower physical activity, or a higher intake of processed red meat
(28–30), which all are risk factors for CVD. In our study pop-
ulation, such associations were not observed (Table 1). In ran-
domized controlled trials lasting from a few weeks to a few
months, the addition of 2–3 eggs/d to a diet did not affect en-
dothelial function (31–33). Increasing egg intake also improved
several CVD risk factors, such as increased formation of larger
and less dense LDL and HDL particles (34, 35), decreased in-
flammatory markers (36–38), and improved glucose metabolism
(35), although not all trials found improvements in the risk

 factors (31–33, 39). Overall, egg or cholesterol intakes do not
appear to be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in
general populations, and according to the results from our study,
the associations are similar even in hyperresponders to dietary
cholesterol (i.e., ApoE e4 carriers).
In addition to dietary cholesterol, egg yolk is also a major
source of choline (40), which is a source for trimethylamine-N-
oxide (TMAO) production (41). TMAO was recently found to
accelerate atherosclerosis in animal models and to be an in-
dependent risk factor for CVD in humans (41, 42), and increased
egg intake has been shown to increase the production of TMAO
(42, 43). However, higher choline intake has also been inversely
associated with inflammation (44) and, as noted above, egg in-
take has not been associated with CVD in general populations
(16, 17). Eggs are an inexpensive and widely available source
of several beneficial nutrients, such as high-quality protein,
unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. Eggs are also
a good source of other bioactive compounds, such as lutein,
zeaxanthin, and phospholipids, which can have beneficial effects
on inflammation, lipid oxidation, lipid metabolism, and athero-
sclerosis progression (45–48). Therefore, the health effects of
eggs, or any other food, cannot be reliably determined by a single
nutrient in the food, such as cholesterol or choline in eggs. This
emphasizes the need to investigate the impact of whole foods,
rather than individual nutrients or food components, on health.
The strength of our study is the detailed information on dietary
intakes, which were assessed by using a 4-d food record and
which included data on eggs in mixed dishes and recipes. The
proportion of the ApoE e4 carriers was also larger than in most
other populations, which enabled us to investigate the associa-
tions between egg and cholesterol intakes and risk of CVD in
this subpopulation with increased serum lipid response to di-
etary cholesterol. The other strengths were the population-based
recruitment, extensive database of potential confounders, detailed
classification of the CAD events, and virtually no loss to follow-up.

EGG AND CHOLESTEROL INTAKES, APOE, AND CAD RISK

 The potential limitation of the study was the rather small
number of participants, which limited the power to find asso-
ciations with incident CAD. Dietary habits were assessed only at
baseline, which may have attenuated the associations with in-
cident CAD during the long follow-up. Average egg consumption
has remained relatively stable in Finland during the past 40 y
(49), but cholesterol intake has decreased (50). However, egg or
cholesterol intakes were not associated with increased carotid
atherosclerosis at baseline, and the associations with incident
CAD were not appreciably different with a shorter, 10-y follow-
up, which supports the lack of association with incident CAD
during the 21-y follow-up. The results are similar to those in
another study, which found no significant association between
egg intake and the risk of CAD in the analyses that assessed either
the recent intake or cumulatively updated intake during the 8- to
14-y follow-up (28). Because of the limited study size, we were
unable to separately investigate the impact of ApoE e4 homo-
zygosity (ApoE 4/4), which may have the greatest impact on
cholesterol absorption in ApoE phenotypes (13). The median
egg intake in the highest tertile was 52 g/d, w1 medium-sized
egg, so our findings may not be generalizable to higher intakes.
We did not have information on the preparation methods for eggs,
so we were unable to investigate whether the associations would
be similar for boiled and fried eggs. Our study population in-
cluded only a few participants with type 2 diabetes, so we were
unable to investigate whether the associations would be different
in patients with diabetes, as has been suggested (16, 17). Although
those with data on the ApoE phenotype had a less favorable lipid
profile, they were, in general, healthier and had more favorable
lifestyle factors than the rest of the KIHD cohort. Therefore, the
associations may not be generalizable to a more heterogeneous
population. Although increased carotid IMT has been shown to
predict CAD in the KIHD, it may not indicate atherosclerosis
progression, which is more characterized by focal lesions. Finally,
because our study included only middle-aged and older men, the
results may not be generalizable to other age groups or to women.
In conclusion, in the present study we examined the associ-
ation between egg and cholesterol intakes and the risk of CAD
and carotid IMT in a population with an exceptionally high
prevalence of the ApoE e4 allele. We did not find any indications
of the relation of moderate egg consumption (up to 1 egg/d) or
moderate-to-high dietary cholesterol intake with increased CVD
risk, even in these highly susceptible individuals. Hence, al-
though our results are based on a rather small population, the
findings suggest that removal of the recommendation to limit
dietary cholesterol intake (including egg consumption) does not
involve a marked risk for population health.
