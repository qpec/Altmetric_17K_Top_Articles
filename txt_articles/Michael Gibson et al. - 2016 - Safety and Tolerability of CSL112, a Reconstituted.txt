ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Human or recombinant apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) has been 
shown to increase high-density lipoprotein–mediated cholesterol efflux capacity 
and to regress atherosclerotic disease in animal and clinical studies. CSL112 
is an infusible, plasma-derived apoA-I that has been studied in normal subjects 
or those with stable coronary artery disease. This study aimed to characterize 
the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CSL112 in 
patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS: The AEGIS-I trial (Apo-I Event Reducing in Ischemic Syndromes 
I) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging phase 2b trial. Patients with myocardial infarction were stratified 
by renal function and randomized 1:1:1 to CSL112 (2 g apoA-I per dose) 
and high-dose CSL112 (6 g apoA-I per dose), or placebo for 4 consecutive 
weekly infusions. Coprimary safety end points were occurrence of either a 
hepatic safety event (an increase in alanine transaminase >3 times the upper 
limit of normal or an increase in total bilirubin >2 times the upper limit of 
normal) or a renal safety event (an increase in serum creatinine >1.5 times 
the baseline value or a new requirement for renal replacement therapy).
RESUL
TS: A total of 1258 patients were randomized, and 91.2% received 
all 4 infusions. The difference in incidence rates for an increase in alanine 
transaminase or total bilirubin between both CSL112 arms and placebo was 
within the protocol-defined noninferiority margin of 4%. Similarly, the difference 
in incidence rates for an increase in serum creatinine or a new requirement for 
renal replacement therapy was within the protocol-defined noninferiority margin 
of 5%. CSL112 was associated with increases in apoA-I and ex vivo cholesterol 
efflux similar to that achieved in patients with stable coronary artery disease. In 
regard to the secondary efficacy end point, the risk for the composite of major 
adverse cardiovascular events among the groups was similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute myocardial infarction, 4 weekly 
infusions of CSL112 are feasible, well tolerated, and not associated with any 
significant alterations in liver or kidney function or other safety concern. The 
ability of CSL112 to acutely enhance cholesterol efflux was confirmed. The 
potential benefit of CSL112 to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events 
needs to be assessed in an adequately powered phase 3 trial.

espite advances in therapeutic strategies for acute 
myocardial infarction (MI), patients remain at a high 
risk for recurrent ischemic events, particularly in 
the immediate weeks to months after the event.1 Recur-
rent events are most commonly the result of additional 
plaque rupture or erosion and are associated with sig-
nificant morbidity and mortality.2,3 Although they may oc-
cur at the site of the index MI vessel, they are equally 
likely to occur at a different site anywhere in the coro-
nary artery tree.2 Although a low level of high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is a risk factor for major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE end points),4–12 it 
remains unclear whether raising HDL will reduce MACE 
end points because several therapies that raised HDL 
cholesterol were not associated with improved clinical 
outcomes.13–17 These studies may have been limited 
by the failure to enrich for patients with high modifiable 
risk, off-target toxicity, or failure to raise functional HDL. 
Cholesterol efflux capacity, an ex vivo measure of HDL 
function, evaluates the ability of HDL to remove excess 
cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaque for transport 
to the liver. It is a correlate of MACE end points that 
is independent of HDL cholesterol, and it may be more 
viable to improve clinical outcomes by identifying phar-
macotherapies that act rapidly after acute MI to improve 
cholesterol efflux and thereby reduce plaque burden 
and stabilize vulnerable plaque, rather than raising HDL 
alone.18–20 It is important to note that the majority of the 
failed HDL cholesterol–raising trials evaluated long-term 
pharmacotherapy, and therapy was not initiated in the 
immediate post-MI period, a time when cholesterol efflux 
is significantly impaired.21–23
CSL112 is a plasma-derived apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-
I), the primary functional component of HDL, reconstitut-
ed into disk-shaped lipoproteins with phosphatidylcholine 
and stabilized with sucrose.24 Initial studies of CSL112 
have demonstrated a significant dose-dependent in-
crease in plasma apoA-I and a dose-dependent increase 
in total and ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1)–dependent 
cholesterol efflux capacity.25–27 A favorable safety profile 
has been demonstrated in the clinical program to date, 
including in patients with stable atherosclerotic disease, 
although it has not been characterized in patients with 
acute MI.27 A prototype formulation of CSL112 was dis-
continued from development because of the occurrence 
of transient elevations of hepatic enzymes presumed 
to be related to the phosphatidylcholine excipient con-
tent.28,29 Risk of renal toxicity has been described with 
high doses of intravenous sucrose. We therefore as-
sessed both hepatic and renal function after infusion of 
this lower-phosphatidylcholine– and low-sucrose–con-
taining preparation of CSL112 in patients with MI.
The AEGIS-I trial (Apo-I Event Reducing in Ischemic 
Syndromes I) was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-
controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b clinical trial that 
primarily aimed to assess safety and tolerability and 
secondary and exploratory objectives including time to 
first occurrence of MACE end points and the pharma-
cokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 4 weekly adminis-
trations of 2 doses of CSL112 compared with placebo 
among patients with acute MI and either normal renal 
function or mild renal impairment (ClinicalTrials.gov; 
NCT02108262).
METHODS
Study Oversight
AEGIS-I was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
dose-ranging phase 2b trial designed in collaboration between 
the study sponsor (CSL Behring) and members of the executive 
and steering committee (online-only Data Supplement). Statistical 
analyses were conducted independently by the PERFUSE Study 
Group (Perfusion Use in Stroke Evaluation Study) using the Study 
Data Tabulation Model data sets. The executive committee 
drafted all versions of the manuscript and agreed to the content 
of the final version. The sponsor had the opportunity to review 
and comment on the final draft of the manuscript but had no 
editorial authority. The study design was in accordance with the 
1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments and was 
approved by the appropriate national and institutional regulatory 
agencies and ethics committees. An independent data and 
safety monitoring board (online-only Data Supplement) moni-
tored the trial and reviewed unblinded data.
Study Population
Men and women at least 18 years of age with a clinical pre-
sentation consistent with a type I (spontaneous) MI within 
the past 7 days who had either normal renal function or 
mild renal impairment were enrolled. The criteria for MI were 
based on the third universal definition of MI.30 Normal renal 
function was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration 
rate ≥90 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2, and mild renal impairment was 
defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <90 and ≥60 
mL·min−1·1.73 m−2.
 Major exclusion criteria included evidence of current hepa-
tobiliary disease, baseline moderate or severe chronic kidney 
disease, history of contrast-induced acute kidney injury, or 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Among patients with acute myocardial infarction, 4 
weekly infusions of a reconstituted infusible human 
apolipoprotein A-I, CSL112, are associated with a 
dose-dependent elevation of circulating apolipo-
protein A-I and cholesterol efflux capacity without 
adverse hepatic or renal outcomes.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Further studies are warranted to assess the clini-
cal benefit of CSL112 in reducing cardiovascular 
events after acute myocardial infarction.

ongoing hemodynamic instability. Among subjects who under-
went angiography and were administered a contrast agent, 
stable renal function at least 12 hours after contrast adminis-
tration (ie, no increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL from 
the precontrast value) was required for enrollment. A full list 
of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the online-only 
Data Supplement. An institutional review committee approved 
the study, and all subjects were provided written informed con-
sent before enrollment.
Study Protocol
The US Food and Drug Administration mandated a review 
of renal and hepatic safety by the data and safety monitor-
ing board after the first 9 patients were enrolled, and after 
data and safety monitoring board approval, enrollment in the 
main study was initiated. Eligible patients were first strati-
fied by renal function (either normal renal function or mild 
renal impairment) and were then randomly assigned with a 
1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: low-dose CSL112 (2 g 
apoA-I per dose), high-dose CSL112 (6 g apoA-I per dose), or 
placebo. The study drug was administered as a weekly 2-hour 
intravenous infusion for 4 consecutive weeks (on study days 
1, 8, 15, and 22; online-only Data Supplement). The active 
treatment period was defined as the time from the administra-
tion of the first dose of study drug (study day 1) until 1 week 
after the last infusion (study day 29). All patients were to 
complete the safety follow-up period on study day 112 (end 
of study visit).
Patients were routinely evaluated at predetermined inter-
vals from screening until the final follow-up visit. Evaluations 
included physical examinations, serum creatinine, total bili-
rubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspartate 
transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatine, glucose, 
metabolic, cardiovascular and lipid biomarkers, markers of 
immunogenicity, and assessments of infusion site, bleeding, 
and adverse events. The occurrence of MACE end points was 
also monitored for all subjects for up to 1 year after random-
ization or until the last randomized subject completed the 
study day 112 visit.
Plasma concentrations of apoA-I and ex vivo cholesterol 
efflux were measured at several time points. In addition, a phar-
macokinetics/pharmacodynamics substudy was conducted 
among 63 patients. Subjects included in the substudy were 
equally stratified by renal function and were randomly assigned 
with a ratio of 2:3:3 to placebo, low-dose CSL112 (2 g apoA-I 
per dose), or high-dose CSL112 (6 g apoA-I per dose), respec-
tively. The ability of plasma to mediate cholesterol efflux from 
cultured J774 cells was measured as previously described.26 
These assays measure both total cholesterol efflux capacity 
and the efflux that may be attributed to the ABCA1 transporter. 
Both efflux measures are presented as percent of cellular cho-
lesterol content. Additional details of the AEGIS-I trial design 
have previously been published.31
Coprimary Safety End Points
The coprimary safety end points were rates of hepatotoxicity 
and renal toxicity. Hepatotoxicity was defined as the incidence 
of either alanine transaminase >3 times the upper limit of nor-
mal or total bilirubin >2 times the upper limit of normal that was 
confirmed on repeat measurement. Renal toxicity was defined 
as either a serum creatinine ≥1.5 times the baseline value that 
was confirmed on repeat measurement or a new-onset require-
ment for renal replacement therapy. Both hepatic and renal 
safety end points were evaluated from baseline (before the first 
infusion) through the end of the active treatment period (study 
day 29). All measures for the coprimary safety end points were 
based on central laboratory values.
Secondary and Exploratory End Points
Secondary and exploratory efficacy end points were assessed 
in the intent-to-treat population (all patients randomized, includ-
ing those who did not receive study drug) and included the time 
to first occurrence of a MACE, which was defined as the com-
posite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, ischemic stroke, 
or hospitalization for unstable angina, from randomization until 
the last treated subject completed study day 112. An indepen-
dent clinical events committee that was blinded to treatment 
assignment adjudicated all MACE end points.
Bleeding was assessed as a secondary safety end point 
because the majority of subjects were anticipated to be 
treated with dual antiplatelet therapy after MI. Measured and 
baseline-corrected plasma apoA-I concentrations, pharmaco-
dynamic characteristics of CSL112, including changes in total 
and ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux measures (ex vivo), 
and lipid, metabolic, and cardiovascular biomarkers were 
assessed. Additional prespecified end points have previously 
been described.31
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.4. 
All safety end points were evaluated in the safety population, 
which consisted of randomized subjects who received at least 
1 partial dose of the study drug. In the safety population, sub-
jects were classified according to the actual treatment they 
received and their true renal stratum. Efficacy end points were 
evaluated in the intent-to-treat population, which consisted of 
all randomized subjects. In the intent-to-treat population, sub-
jects were classified according to the treatment they were 
randomized to and according to the renal function stratum 
they were randomized from, regardless of actual treatment or 
true renal function stratum. Additional populations such as the 
pharmacokinetics analysis population, pharmacokinetics/phar-
macodynamics analysis population, and biomarker analysis 
population were predefined in the study protocol.
The Newcombe-Wilson score method was used to calculate 
the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals of the difference in rates 
(CSL112 minus placebo) for the coprimary safety end points. 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval was 
specified for testing the coprimary end points, comparing with 
the specified thresholds for hepatic and renal end points for 
the noninferiority assessment. This gives a 1-sided 2.5% type 
I error for each of the hepatic and renal end points and was 
based on an application of the Bonferroni method to control 
the overall type I error at 5%. Noninferiority criteria were pre-
specified to be met for the rate difference if the upper bound of 
the 95% confidence interval was ≤4% in hepatic outcomes and 
≤5% in renal outcomes for a pairwise treatment group com-
parison. Bleeding rates were compared among the 3 groups. 
Adverse events are presented with the use of descriptive sta-
tistics in the online-only Data Supplement.

Although not powered to detect differences in MACE end 
points, secondary and exploratory MACE outcomes were eval-
uated by calculating differences in time to first MACE between 
the treatment groups with a Cox proportional hazards model, 
with treatment assignment and baseline renal function stratum 
as covariates. A 2-sided log-rank test P value was calculated 
for each CSL112 dose versus placebo with stratification by 
renal function. No formal hypothesis testing for MACE end 
points was intended.
RESuLTS
From January 2015 through November 2015, a total of 
1258 patients in 16 countries were randomized, of whom 
1244 (99.6%) received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
1147 (91.2%) received all 4 infusions. A total of 680 pa-
tients (54.1%) were stratified to the normal renal function 
stratum, and 578 (45.9%) were stratified to the mild re-
nal impairment stratum (Figure 1). For the index event, 
61.6% of patients experienced ST-segment–elevation MI 
and 38.4% experienced non–ST-segment–elevation MI. 
The median duration from the index event to randomiza-
tion was 4 days, and although 24 to 34 patients per 
treatment group had 1 year of follow-up, the median du-
ration of follow-up was 7.5 months (interquartile range, 
5.8–9.7 months). Baseline characteristics were well bal-
anced among the 3 treatment groups (Table 1).
Coprimary End Points Results
During the active treatment period, the coprimary safety 
end point of hepatic impairment occurred in 0 patients 
(0.0%) in the placebo group, 4 of 415 patients (1.0%) in 
the 2-g dose group (P=0.12 versus placebo), and 2 of 
416 patients (0.5%) in the 6-g dose group (P=0.50 ver-
sus placebo). Both dose comparisons with placebo were 
not significantly different and were within the prespecified 
margin of ≤4% (Table 2). There were no Hy law cases (ie, 
concomitant elevation of alanine transaminase/aspartate 
transaminase and bilirubin with no other reason to explain 
the combination) in the trial. Results from 2 prespecified 
sensitivity analyses, including patients with elevated base-
line bilirubin and all elevated values regardless of confirma-
tion values, were consistent with the results of the primary 
safety analysis (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
The coprimary safety end point of renal impairment 
occurred in 1 of 413 patients (0.2%) in the placebo 
group, 0 of 415 patients (0.0%) in the 2-g dose group 
(P=0.50 versus placebo), and 3 of 416 patients (0.7%) 
in the 6-g dose group (P=0.62 versus placebo). Both 
dose comparisons with placebo were not significantly 
different and were within the prespecified margin of ≤5% 
(Table 2). Additional prespecified exploratory safety anal-
yses and post hoc analyses are shown in Tables II and III 
in the online-only Data Supplement.
Secondary and Exploratory End Points Results
Through 12 months of follow-up, the risk of the MACE com-
posite secondary end point (cardiovascular death, nonfa-
tal MI, ischemic stroke, and hospitalization for unstable 
angina) with CSL112 therapy compared with placebo was 
similar (low dose [2 g], 27 of 419 [6.4%] versus placebo, 
23 of 418 [5.5%]; hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.67–2.05; P=0.72; and high dose [6 g], 24 of 
421 [5.7%]; hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 
0.57–1.80; P=0.52; Figure 2). Similar risks among treat-
ment groups for the exploratory MACE composite end

points were observed, including in the traditional phase 
3 end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and 
stroke (Figure 3). As for the secondary MACE compos-
ite end point, the majority of additional exploratory MACE 
end points were similar among treatment groups. There 
was a difference in the number of cardiovascular-related 
deaths when CSL112 6-g apoA-I (n=4 [1.0%]; P=0.0477) 
was compared with placebo (n=0 [0.0%]), but this was 
not seen when CSL112 2g apoA-I (n=2 [0.5%]; P=0.32) 
was compared with placebo. However, the number of 
patients experiencing cardiovascular-related deaths was 
low (Table 3). Similarly, a difference in the number of 
heart failure events was observed when CSL112 6-g 
apoA-I (n=4, 1.0%; P=0.2525) was compared with pla-
cebo (n=1, 0.2%) and CSL112 2g apoA-I (n=5, 1.2%; 
P=0.1205) was compared with placebo. The number of 
patients experiencing heart failure was low (Table 3).
The rates of all grades of Bleeding Academic Re-
search Consortium bleeding were low and comparable

CI indicates confidence interval. The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI was specified for testing the coprimary end points, comparing with the specified 
thresholds for hepatic and renal end points for the noninferiority assessment. This gives a 1-sided 2.5% type I error for each of the hepatic and renal end 
points and was based on an application of the Bonferroni method to control the overall type I error at 5%. 
Percentages are based on the number of subjects with data. 
A hepatic end point of interest is defined as any subject recording 1 of the 2 following results: alanine transaminase >3 times the upper limit of 
normal or total bilirubin >2 times the upper limit of normal confirmed by a consecutive repeat test after at least 24 hours but within 1 week of the 
original test. 
A renal event is defined as a serum creatinine increase of ≥1.5 times the baseline value confirmed by a repeat test after at least 24 hours but within 1 
week or the need for renal replacement therapy.
*The 95% CIs of the difference in the subject incidence rates were calculated with the Newcombe-Wilson score method.
†Yes indicates that the noninferiority criterion is met.

both apoA-I and cholesterol efflux capacity (Table 6). The 
2-g dose elevated apoA-I 1.29-fold and total cholesterol 
efflux capacity 1.87-fold, whereas the 6-g dose elevated 
apoA-I 2.06-fold and total cholesterol efflux capacity 
2.45-fold. Consistent with prior findings, the elevation 
of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux capacity (3.67-
fold for the 2-g dose, 4.30-fold for the 6-g dose) was 
substantially greater than the elevation of either apoA-
I or total cholesterol efflux capacity, suggesting that 
CSL112 may increase not only the amount of circulating 
apoA-I but also the activity for ABCA1-dependent efflux 
on a per–apoA-I basis.26 We assessed this “specific activ-
ity” of the circulating apoA-I pool for ABCA1-dependent 
cholesterol efflux capacity by calculating the ABCA1-
dependent cholesterol efflux capacity/apoA-I ratio at the 
end of the infusion. Infusion of CSL112 caused a 2.51-
fold increased ratio for the 2-g dose group (0.05) and a 
1.78-fold increased ratio for the 6-g dose group (0.035) 
compared with the placebo group (0.02).26 The elevation 
in ABCA1-dependent efflux capacity was greater than 
the elevation of apoA-I. Although this ratio is not a vali-
dated measure, it could be speculated that the infusion 
elevates not just the quantity but also the functionality 
of the apoA-I pool. Indeed, the ABCA1-dependent cho-
lesterol efflux capacity/apoA-I ratios were elevated with 
both doses of CSL112 compared with placebo (Table III 
in the online-only Data Supplement)

Infusions of CSL112, a reconstituted plasma-derived 
apoA-I, at both low (2 g) and high (6 g) doses adminis-
tered as 4 weekly infusions beginning within 7 days of 
acute MI were not associated with alterations in either 
liver or kidney function. This was the first study in which 
CSL112 was administered to patients with acute MI and 
the first study in which it was added to acute MI stan-

a time-to-first MACE analysis in the intent-to-treat population. 
Percentages are based on the number of subjects with data. The clinical events committee adjudicated 
all events. 
The HR is based on a proportional hazards model with factors for treatment group and renal function. An HR <1 favors CSL112. A stratified log-rank 
P<0.05 indicates that the time to first MACE in the CSL112 arm is significantly different from that in the placebo arm. MACE composite secondary end 
point consists of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, ischemic stroke, and hospitalization for unstable angina. Exploratory MACE composite end point 1 
consists of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and ischemic stroke. Exploratory MACE composite end point 2 consists of CV death, nonfatal MI, and any 
strokes. Exploratory MACE composite end point 3 consists of nonfatal MI, all-cause mortality, and any strokes. Exploratory MACE composite end point 4 
consists of hospitalization for unstable angina, all-cause mortality, any strokes, heart failure, and coronary revascularization.

acute MI setting was important before the initiation of 
a large-scale phase 3 outcomes trial. The results from 
AEGIS-I suggest that the current formulation of CSL112 
compared with the prototype formulation did not demon-
strate a hepatic safety concern. Furthermore, infusion 
of CSL112 shortly after a contrast load among patients 
with MI was not associated with renal toxicity, demon-
strating the feasibility of administering CSL112 to pa-
tients with MI with normal renal function or mild renal 
impairment shortly after angiography. A study in patients 
with MI with moderate renal impairment is ongoing.
The number of MACE end points overall was low 
(n=74), as was the number of subjects with complete 
follow-up through 1 year (89 of 1258). The statistical 
power to assess the secondary MACE end point was 
very low, ≈8.4% (Table VII in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). MACE rates were generally comparable between 
groups, although cardiovascular mortality was higher in 
the 6-g group compared with the placebo group (4 ver-
sus 0 deaths; P=0.0477). The calculated P value was 
not adjusted for the multiplicity of 32 efficacy compari-
sons. There was no clustering of death in proximity to the 
CSL112 infusion (Table VI and Figure I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). It should be noted that indeterminant 
causes of death were included as cardiovascular death. 
The isolated difference in mortality was inconsistent with 
the overall similarity in MACE rates.
Compared with placebo, CSL112 was also associat-
ed with an improvement in measures of cholesterol ef-
flux capacity. It has been postulated that improvements 
in HDL function, rather than HDL concentration, may 
be more important for the stabilization of atheroscle-
rotic plaque lesions and the reduction of cardiovascular 
events. In the Dallas Heart Study, high cholesterol ef-
flux capacity, a marker of effective reverse cholesterol 
transport, was associated with a 67% lower risk of 
MACE end points compared with low cholesterol efflux 
capacity,18 an association that was independent of HDL 
concentrations. To date, although HDL-raising thera-
pies have indeed increased HDL concentrations, they 
have had a modest or no effect on cholesterol efflux, a 
finding that may explain at least in part why HDL-raising 
therapies have failed to reduce MACE outcomes in the 
past.32–37 In contrast, cholesterol efflux capacity was 
markedly elevated immediately after CSL112 infusion. 
In particular, ABCA1-dependent efflux, a pathway espe-
cially relevant to cholesterol-laden cells in plaque, was 
elevated >3-fold after infusion of CSL112. It is note-
worthy that the elevation in the ABCA1-dependent efflux 
capacity was greater than the elevation of apoA-I, thus 
suggesting that infusion elevates not just the quantity 
but also the functionality of the apoA-I pool. Indeed, the 
ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux capacity/apoA-I 
ratios were elevated with both doses of CSL112 com-
pared with placebo (Table 6). Prior mechanistic stud-
ies38 have shown comparable functional changes and 
have determined that CSL112 elevates ABCA1-depen-
dent efflux by remodeling endogenous HDL to form 
smaller, more functional HDL species with a high ability 
to interact with ABCA1.
The elevation of cholesterol efflux caused by CSL112 
has been shown to be transient and recedes to base-
line with clearance of the apoA-I.26 It is not known how 
a transient enhancement of cholesterol efflux capacity 
immediately after acute MI will affect clinical outcomes 
compared with the sustained or long-term measures of 
cholesterol efflux assessed in the Dallas Heart Study.18 
Although MACE end points were not reduced in AEGIS-I, 
this phase 2b study was designed as a safety trial and 
was not sufficiently powered to assess efficacy (Table 
VII in the online-only Data Supplement). Consistent with 
other phase 2 safety studies, MACE end points were ex-
plored in AEGIS-I to assess the timing and frequency of 
events and to identify subgroups of patients at higher 
risk of events so that an adequately powered phase 3 
study could be planned to definitively assess the effica-
cy. Although these analyses are exploratory, they were 
prespecified so as to focus the analyses for phase 3 
planning.
Limitations
The coprimary safety end points were less frequent than 
anticipated for the noninferiority analysis, but the very 
low frequency of these events suggests that there is 
not a clinically relevant hepatic or renal safety signal.

formed, lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein E were not as-
sessed after infusion.
This phase 2 safety study was underpowered to as-
sess efficacy and was not designed to test for effica-
cy. For the secondary MACE end point, the power was 
8.4% to detect a clinically relevant 15% risk reduction 
assuming a placebo event rate of 5.5% (Table VII in the 
online-only Data Supplement). The statistical power of 
other end points can be found in the online-only Data 
Supplement. As were many phase 2 studies, this trial 
was undertaken primarily to assess safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.
Conclusions
Four weekly infusions of CSL112, a reconstituted plas-
ma-derived apoA-I, at both low (2 g) and high (6 g) doses 
beginning within 7 days of acute MI and in proximity to 
contrast media administration were feasible, were not 
associated with alterations in either liver or kidney func-
tion or other significant safety concern, and were associ-
ated with immediate enhancements in cholesterol efflux 
capacity. Further assessment of the clinical efficacy of 
CSL112 for the reduction of early recurrent cardiovas-
cular events after acute MI is warranted in an adequately 
powered, multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial.
