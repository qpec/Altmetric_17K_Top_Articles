Summary
Background Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes are a high-risk population who are recommended to strive for 
optimal glucose control, but neonatal outcomes attributed to maternal hyperglycaemia remain suboptimal. Our aim 
was to examine the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on maternal glucose control and obstetric 
and neonatal health outcomes.
Methods In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we recruited women aged 18–40 years with type 1 
diabetes for a minimum of 12 months who were receiving intensive insulin therapy. Participants were pregnant 
(≤13 weeks and 6 days’ gestation) or planning pregnancy from 31 hospitals in Canada, England, Scotland, Spain, Italy, 
Ireland, and the USA. We ran two trials in parallel for pregnant participants and for participants planning pregnancy. 
In both trials, participants were randomly assigned to either CGM in addition to capillary glucose monitoring or 
capillary glucose monitoring alone. Randomisation was stratified by insulin delivery (pump or injections) and baseline 
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from randomisation to 34 weeks’ gestation 
in pregnant women and to 24 weeks or conception in women planning pregnancy, and was assessed in all randomised 
participants with baseline assessments. Secondary outcomes included obstetric and neonatal health outcomes, 
assessed with all available data without imputation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01788527.
Findings Between March 25, 2013, and March 22, 2016, we randomly assigned 325 women (215 pregnant, 
110 planning pregnancy) to capillary glucose monitoring with CGM (108 pregnant and 53 planning pregnancy) or 
without (107 pregnant and 57 planning pregnancy). We found a small difference in HbA1c in pregnant women 
using CGM (mean difference −0·19%; 95% CI −0·34 to −0·03; p=0·0207). Pregnant CGM users spent more time 
in target (68% vs 61%; p=0·0034) and less time hyperglycaemic (27% vs 32%; p=0·0279) than did pregnant control 
participants, with comparable severe hypoglycaemia episodes (18 CGM and 21 control) and time spent 
hypoglycaemic (3% vs 4%; p=0·10). Neonatal health outcomes were significantly improved, with lower incidence 
of large for gestational age (odds ratio 0·51, 95% CI 0·28 to 0·90; p=0·0210), fewer neonatal intensive care 
admissions lasting more than 24 h (0·48; 0·26 to 0·86; p=0·0157), fewer incidences of neonatal hypoglycaemia 
(0·45; 0·22 to 0·89; p=0·0250), and 1-day shorter length of hospital stay (p=0·0091). We found no apparent benefit 
of CGM in women planning pregnancy. Adverse events occurred in 51 (48%) of CGM participants and 43 (40%) of 
control participants in the pregnancy trial, and in 12 (27%) of CGM participants and 21 (37%) of control participants 
in the planning pregnancy trial. Serious adverse events occurred in 13 (6%) participants in the pregnancy trial 
(eight [7%] CGM, five [5%] control) and in three (3%) participants in the planning pregnancy trial (two [4%] CGM 
and one [2%] control). The most common adverse events were skin reactions occurring in 49 (48%) of 103 CGM 
participants and eight (8%) of 104 control participants during pregnancy and in 23 (44%) of 52 CGM participants 
and five (9%) of 57 control participants in the planning pregnancy trial. The most common serious adverse events 
were gastrointestinal (nausea and vomiting in four participants during pregnancy and three participants 
planning pregnancy).
Interpretation Use of CGM during pregnancy in patients with type 1 diabetes is associated with improved neonatal 
outcomes, which are likely to be attributed to reduced exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia. CGM should be offered 
to all pregnant women with type 1 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy. This study is the first to indicate potential 
for improvements in non-glycaemic health outcomes from CGM use.

Introduction
Type 1 diabetes increases the risk of adverse pregnancy 
outcomes, including higher rates of pre-eclampsia and 
caesarean section in mothers, and of congenital anomaly, 
preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, large for gestational 
age, and neonatal intensive care admission in infants.1–4 
The evidence that optimal glycaemic control early during 
the first trimester is associated with improved outcomes, 
reduced congenital anomalies and perinatal mortality is 
well established.5,6 Likewise, reduced exposure to ma-
ternal hyperglycaemia during the second and third 
trimesters is associated with reduced pre-eclampsia, 
preterm delivery, large for gestational age, and neonatal 
intensive care admissions.7–9
Thus, clinical care guidelines recommend that women 
with type 1 diabetes strive for optimal glycaemic control 
before and during pregnancy.10 However, this optimal 
glycaemic control is difficult to accomplish given the 
complexity of insulin dose adjustment, gestational 
changes in insulin sensitivity and marked day-to-day 
variability in insulin absorption during late pregnancy.11–13 
Nationwide UK data confirm that only 15% of pregnant 
women achieve target glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
levels during early pregnancy and that despite intensive 
support (2-weekly antenatal clinics and frequent between-
clinic contacts), only 40% of women with type 1 diabetes 
achieve target HbA1c levels after 24 weeks’ gestation.9 Thus 
one in two newborn infants experience complications 
associated with exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia, 
with no improvement in neonatal morbidity in the past 
three to four decades.9 Furthermore, as women strive for 
optimal glucose control, the rates of severe hypoglycaemia, 
particularly during early pregnancy, are five times higher 
than in non-pregnant women.14
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides 
detailed data on the direction and rate of change of 
glucose levels.15. Real-time systems display contem-
poraneous glucose readings, enabling users to respond to 
changes as they occur. Although randomised trials in 
motivated, non-pregnant women suggest that regular use 
of CGM, defined as at least 6 days per week, improves 
glycaemic control,16,17 results in pregnant women have 
been conflicting. Previous studies provided data only for 
intermittent retrospective use or for early generation 
systems that were too inaccurate or uncomfortable for 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published before June 30, 2017, 
without restriction on language or start date. We included the 
search terms (“Diabetes Mellitus” OR “Diabetes”), AND 
“pregnancy”, OR “pregnancy in diabetics”, AND “continuous 
glucose monitoring”, AND (“trial or randomised controlled trial”). 
We identified three randomised trials that used continuous 
glucose monitoring in women with pre-existing diabetes during 
pregnancy, which found conflicting results. Two of the three 
studies included women with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. 
One study found a reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
and macrosomia; however, it used an intermittent, masked 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device so that patients did 
not see the glucose values in real time. Another study used 
intermittent real-time CGM and found no difference in glycaemic 
control or perinatal outcomes. However, only five women in this 
study used real-time CGM continuously. Together, these two 
studies included 225 women of whom 165 had type 1 diabetes. 
A third small pilot study compared continuous and intermittent 
CGM in 25 women with type 1 diabetes, and found no difference 
in glycaemic control or neonatal outcomes; however, the study 
was not powered for these outcomes. A 2017 Cochrane review of 
self-blood glucose monitoring among pregnant women with 
pre-existing diabetes concluded that the evidence is weak 
regarding the efficacy of continuous glucose monitoring and that 
additional evidence from well designed, large randomised trials is 
needed to inform choices of glucose monitoring.
Added value of this study
In our multicentre, international, randomised controlled trial in 
325 women with type 1 diabetes, we randomly assigned 
women during early pregnancy or planning pregnancy to 
receive either real-time CGM or standard capillary glucose 
monitoring. We found a small but significant reduction in HbA1c 
levels at 34 weeks’ gestation, accompanied by an increased 
time in target, reduced hyperglycaemia, and less glycaemic 
variability. This was accompanied by reductions in neonatal 
outcomes in the proportion of infants large for gestational age, 
neonatal hypoglycaemia, admission to neonatal intensive care 
for more than 24 h, and a 1-day shorter hospital stay among 
infants of mothers randomly assigned to CGM during the 
first trimester. The results were generalisable across 
31 international study sites and comparable for women using 
insulin pumps or multiple daily injections, regardless of baseline 
glucose control. By contrast, we found no significant benefit 
from CGM use in women planning pregnancy.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study indicates that the use of CGM during pregnancy in 
women with type 1 diabetes is associated with improved 
neonatal health outcomes attributed to reduced exposure to 
maternal hyperglycaemia. The numbers of pregnant women 
needed to treat with CGM to prevent one newborn 
complication are six for both neonatal intensive care admission 
and large for gestational age, and eight for neonatal 
hypoglycaemia. National and international clinical guideline 
recommendations in type 1 diabetes in pregnancy should be 
revised to recommend offering CGM to pregnant women with 
type 1 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy in the first 
trimester. To our knowledge, this study is the first to indicate 
potential for improvements in non-glycaemic health outcomes 
from CGM use.

regular use.18,19 The role of real-time CGM used throughout 
pregnancy has not been established and no studies have 
included women planning pregnancy. Beyond glucose 
control, no studies, either in pregnant or non-pregnant 
populations, have examined the effect on diabetes 
complications or other health outcomes. Our aim was to 
evaluate the effectiveness of CGM used before and from 
early pregnancy on maternal glucose control obstetric 
outcomes and neonatal health outcomes.
Methods
Study design and participants
This open-label, multicentre, multinational, randomised, 
controlled study included two parallel trials: a pregnancy 
trial and a planning pregnancy trial. Participants 
were recruited from 31 hospitals in Canada, England, 
Scotland, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the USA.
The clinical study protocol was approved by the Health 
Research Authority, East of England Research Ethics 
Committee (12/EE/0310) for all UK sites and at each 
individual centre for all other sites. All participants 
provided written informed consent. Full details of the 
clinical study protocol have been previously published.20
We recruited women aged 18–40 years with type 1 
diabetes for a minimum of 12 months, receiving 
intensive insulin therapy via multiple daily injections or 
an insulin pump, who were pregnant or planning 
pregnancy. Pregnant women were eligible if they had a 
live singleton fetus confirmed by ultrasound, were at 
13 weeks and 6 days’ gestation or less, and had HbA1c 
between 
6·5–10·0% 
(48–86 
mmol/mol). 
Women 
planning for pregnancy were eligible if they had an 
HbA1c level between 7·0–10·0% (53–86 mmol/mol).
Regular CGM users and women with severe nephro-
pathy or medical conditions such as psychiatric illness 
requiring hospitalisation that could prevent them from 
completing the trial were excluded. Women using 
automatic insulin delivery options, such as low glucose 
suspend pumps, were not excluded.
Randomisation and masking
After enrolment, participants had to complete a run-in 
phase with a masked CGM device (iPro2 Professional 
CGM, Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA) before they 
were eligible for randomisation. In the run-in period, 
glucose values were recorded but were not visible to the 
user or clinical team. Eligibility required that participants 
wear the sensor for 6 days, provide at least 96 h of glucose 
values including a minimum of 24 h overnight, and 
obtain at least four capillary glucose tests daily. 
Participants meeting these criteria were randomised to 
receive either CGM in addition to capillary glucose 
monitoring (intervention) or capillary glucose moni-
toring alone (control). Treatments were allocated in a 
1:1 ratio via a web-based system that used a computer-
generated randomisation list with permuted block sizes 
and stratification by method of insulin delivery (pump or 
multiple injections), and baseline HbA1c (<7·5% vs 
≥7·5% or 58 mmol/mol for the pregnancy trial; <8·0% vs 
≥8·0% or 64 mmol/mol for the planning pregnancy 
trial). The randomisation schedule was created by a 
programming manager, encrypted, and maintained in a 
secure database to which the trial coordinating team and 
investigators had no access.
Procedures
Participants in the CGM group were provided with a 
CGM system (Guardian REAL-Time or MiniMed Minilink 
system, both Medtronic, Northridge, CA). They were 
trained to use the study devices and were instructed to 
use them daily by their local diabetes or antenatal clinical 
teams. CGM users were advised to verify the accuracy of 
CGM measurements using their capillary glucose meter 
before insulin dose adjustment, as per the regulatory 
labelling instructions. Participants in the control group 
continued their usual method of capillary glucose 
monitoring. Participants in both groups were advised to 
test capillary glucose levels at least seven times daily 
(before and 1–2 h after meals and before bed) and given 
written instructions for how to use capillary or CGM 
measures for insulin dose adjustment, customised for 
method of insulin delivery. The detailed treatment 
algorithms have been published previously.20 Both groups 
had the same glucose target range of 3·5–7·8 mmol/L 
and same target HbA1c levels of no higher than 6·5% 
(48 mmol/mol) during pregnancy and no higher than 
7·0% (53 mmol/mol) if planning pregnancy.
In the pregnancy trial, study visits were scheduled at 
randomisation (≤13 weeks and 6 days’ gestation), and at 
8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 34, and 36 weeks’ gestation. In the 
planning pregnancy trial, study visits were scheduled at 
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks after randomisation. Women 
who conceived during the trial continued in their same 
randomised group and followed the pregnancy study 
visit schedule. Participants’ weights, blood pressure, 
insulin dose, adverse events, and episodes of severe 
hypoglycaemia (defined as an event requiring third party 
assistance) were recorded at each visit. Additional clinic 
visits or telephone or email contacts would occur if they 
were part of the centres’ usual care protocols or if 
indicated by clinical need. All scheduled and unscheduled 
(telephone or email) contacts were documented in the 
electronic clinical report forms.
HbA1c measures were taken at randomisation, 
24 weeks’ gestation, and 34 weeks’ gestation in the 
pregnancy trial, and at randomisation, 12 weeks, and 
24 weeks in the planning pregnancy trial; if a participant 
conceived before 24 weeks, their final HbA1c measure 
was taken following confirmation of a positive pregnancy 
test. All HbA1c measurements were done using the 
turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay for haemolysed 
whole blood on the Cobas Integra 700 platform (Roche, 
Basel, Switzerland) at a central laboratory (DynaCare, 
Brampton, ON, Canada). The samples were shipped at

the end of the planning pregnancy trial or after delivery 
of the neonate and collection of the cord blood and were 
unavailable to participants and health-care teams during 
the trial. After the visits at 24 and 34 weeks’ gestation in 
the pregnancy trial, and 12 and 24 weeks or follow-
ing confirmation of a positive pregnancy test in the 
planning pregnancy trial, CGM measures were obtained 
using real-time sensors in the CGM group and a masked 
sensor in the control group. These were repeated, 
as required, if fewer than 96 h of glucose values 
were obtained.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was difference in change in HbA1c 
from randomisation to 34 weeks’ gestation in the 
pregnancy trial and to 24 weeks or conception in the 
planning pregnancy trial.
Prespecified secondary glycaemic outcomes for all 
groups were percentage of time spent in, above, and 
below the recommended glucose control target range 
(3·5–7·8 mmol/L); area under the curve for glucose 
levels; episodes of hypoglycaemia; and glucose 
variability measures derived from CGM measures. For 
pregnant women, prespecified health outcomes were 
gestational weight gain, gestational hypertension, pre-
eclampsia, mode of delivery, length of hospital stay, 
insulin dose, and questionnaires relating to fear of 
hypoglycaemia, coping with diabetes, quality of life, and 
satisfaction with monitoring device. Prespecified 
neonatal health out 
comes included preterm delivery, 
neonatal hypoglycaemia requiring intravenous dextrose, 
neonatal intensive care unit admission requiring a 
duration of at least 24 h, cord blood gas pH, total length 
of 
hospital 
stay, 
birthweight, 
and 
macrosomia 
(birthweight ≥4 kg). Because of differ 
ences in gestational 
age at delivery, we prespecified use of customised 
birthweight 
percentiles 
(gestation-related 
optimal 
weight) that adjust for infant sex and gestational age as 
well as maternal height, weight, parity, and ethnicity to 
calculate the birthweight percentile and proportion of 
infants large or small for gestational age (birthweight 
percentile >90th or <tenth).21
We included the following outcomes both as individual 
and as a composite neonatal measure: pregnancy loss 
(miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death), birth injury, 
shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycaemia, hyper 
bili-
rubinaemia, respiratory distress syndrome, or neonatal 
intensive care admission. To capture clinically important 
adverse outcomes, neonatal hypoglycaemia was defined 
as requiring treatment with intravenous dextrose and 
neonatal intensive care unit admission as requiring a 
duration of at least 24 h. We measured fetal hyper-
insulinaemia and infant adiposity with cord blood 
C-peptide, anthropometric measurements, sum of skin-
folds, and neonatal fat mass.22
At baseline and trial completion, participants comp-
leted the following questionnaires: Blood Glucose 
Monitoring System Rating Questionnaire (BGMSRQ),23 
Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID),24 Short-Form-12,25 
and Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey (HFS II).26 At follow-
up, 
CGM 
participants 
completed 
an 
additional 
questionnaire on their satisfaction with CGM and its 
effects on their lifestyle and behaviour.27 Complications, 
including episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis, severe hypo-
glycaemia, hospital admissions for diabetes, and those 
common to pregnancy with type 1 diabetes including 
hospital admissions for obstetric indications and 
adverse preg 
nancy outcomes (congenital anomaly, 
stillbirth, neo 
natal death), were identified and recorded 
as outcomes.
Adverse events were captured throughout the study. 
Reportable adverse events included all serious adverse 
events other than prespecified protocol exceptions. 
Maternal death was considered a serious adverse event 
regardless of whether or not it was caused by severe 
hypoglycaemia.

Statistical analysis
To achieve 90% power at a two-sided 5% significance level, 
we planned a sample size of 214 pregnant participants and 
110 participants planning pregnancy to detect a between-
group difference in HbA1c of 0·5%. We assumed a 
correlation of 0·4 between baseline and follow-up HbA1c, 
with an SD of 1·1 and up to 20% loss to follow-up during 
pregnancy; and an SD of 0·8 and 15% loss to follow-up 
before pregnancy.
The primary analysis used ANCOVA to compare 
treatment arms with adjustment for baseline HbA1c and 
insulin therapy (pump or multiple daily injections). We 
included all randomised women who had a baseline 
assessment, with multiple imputation of missing HbA1c 
values using the mice package in R.28 For binary outcomes, 
we compared the proportions between groups using 
Fisher’s exact test and, where applicable, using regression 
models that allowed for varying lengths of follow-up time 
and the possibility of overdispersion. We used repeated 
measures ANOVA to determine the significance of differ-
ences in total scores for patient-reported outcome 
measures as estimated by main effects for groups (CGM 
vs control) and group × time interaction effects. To avoid 
potential baseline imbalances, we did not include the 
obstetric and neonatal outcomes of women in the 
planning pregnancy trial who conceived with those of the 
pregnancy trial. Analyses of secondary outcomes used all 
available data without imputation. We used a two-sided 
significance level of 5% for primary and secondary 
outcomes without adjustment for multiple comparisons.
We used logistic regression analyses to estimate the odds 
of occurrence of an adverse event with 95% CIs by 
intervention versus control group. We used Poisson 
regression to calculate the rate of occurrence 95% CIs over 
the study period (randomisation until delivery). p values are 
from these models, with baseline HbA1c group and method 
of insulin delivery as covariates.
The trial was overseen by a trial steering committee and 
an independent data safety monitoring board. An interim 
safety review (maternal severe hypoglycaemia and neonatal 
outcomes) was done when 50% of neonates were delivered. 
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. number 
NCT01788527

Role of the funding source
The funders had no role in the trial design, data collection, 
data 
analysis, 
or 
data 
interpretation. 
Medtronic 
(Northridge, CA, USA) provided discounted-price insulin 
pumps and CGM devices. They also had no role in trial 
design, collection, handling, analysis, or interpretation of 
data, or the decision to publish. The National Institute 
for Health Research and Juvenile Diabetes Research 
Foundation reviewed the manuscript prior to submission 
but did not play a part in manuscript preparation or 
revision. DSF and HRM oversaw the conduct of the trial, 
had full access to all the data, and take full responsibility 
for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between March 25, 2013, and March 22, 2016, 
386 participants were assessed for eligibility and 
325 participants were randomised, with 215 pregnant 
and 110 planning pregnancy. In the pregnancy trial, 
108 women were assigned to the CGM intervention and 
107 women were assigned to the control group. One 
CGM 
participant 
withdrew 
before 
the 
baseline 
assessments, leaving 107 in each group (figure 1A). In the 
planning pregnancy trial, 53 women were assigned to the 
intervention and 57 to the control group (figure 1B). Most 
participants 
self-identified 
as 
of 
European 
or 
Mediterranean origin, were college educated, non-
smokers, and had a long duration of type 1 diabetes 
(table 1). Approximately half were overweight or obese. 
Half the women in the pregnancy trial took folic acid 
preconception and slightly more than half used multiple 
daily insulin injections. In the planning pregnancy trial, 
a greater proportion of women used insulin pump

Data are mean (SD), n (%), or n/N (%) where data are missing, except for duration of diabetes, which is median (tenth to 90th percentile). Data were collected at enrolment or 
randomisation (2 weeks after enrolment). CGM=continuous glucose monitoring. HbA1c= glycated haemoglobin. *One CGM participant withdrew immediately after 
randomisation and before baseline assessments, leaving 107 in both planning-pregnancy groups. †One underweight control participant (body-mass index <18·5 kg/m²) was 
planning pregnancy. ‡Locally assessed. §Centrally assessed. Randomisation HbA1c levels were unavailable for nine CGM participants (six lost or not collected, two withdrawals, 
and one pregnancy loss) and 11 control participants (nine lost or not collected, one withdrawal, and one pregnancy loss) in early pregnancy and for seven CGM participants (four 
lost or not collected, two withdrawals, and one pregnant) and five control participants (five lost or not collected) planning pregnancy. All participants had HbA1c levels (local lab) 
at enrolment. ¶25 pregnant participants and seven participants planning pregnancy used pumps with low glucose suspend features. Data regarding the use or frequency of 
insulin suspension is not available. ||Diabetes complications are not mutually exclusive. **Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring third-party assistance.

The proportion of completed scheduled study visits was 
high. Pregnant participants using CGM completed slightly 
more scheduled visits than did the control group (mean 7·2 
[SD 1·1] vs 6·8 [1·4]; p=0·0171), whereas we found no 
between-group differences in participants planning 
pregnancy. Pregnant participants using CGM also had 
more unscheduled contacts (1530 contacts by CGM 
participants vs 1026 contacts by controls; appendix p 3) 
outside of their study and usual care visits. These 
unscheduled contacts were attributed both to sensor issues 
(mean 2·1 [SD 2·8] per participant in the CGM group vs 
0·1 [0·3] per participant in the control group; p<0·0001) 
and to sensor-related diabetes management issues 
(2·6 [5·3] vs 0·2 [SD 0·7]; p<0·0001). We found no 
difference in contacts for general diabetes management or 
contacts for other reasons. We noted similar findings 
among CGM users in the planning pregnancy trial 
(appendix p 3).
The frequency of CGM use was comparable in 
pregnant participants (median 6·1 days per week [IQR 
4·0–6·8]) and participants planning pregnancy (6·2 days 
per week [IQR 5·2–6·9]). Sensor compliance was 
generally high with 70% of pregnant participants and 
77% of participants planning pregnancy using CGM for 
more than 75% of the time. Sensor use was highest in 
later gestation (median 6·5 days [IQR 3·9–7·0] at 
25–34 weeks) in pregnant women and earlier (median 
6·7 days [IQR 5·3–6·9] at 1–12 weeks after randomisation) 
in women planning pregnancy (appendix p 4).
In the primary analysis of the pregnancy trial, we found 
a small but significant between-group difference in the 
change in HbA1c from baseline to 34 weeks’ gestation, 
favouring CGM (mean difference −0·19%, 95% CI 
−0·34 to −0·03; p=0·0207; figure 2, table 2. In the planning 
pregnancy trial, the between-group difference was of a 
similar size but with a wider confidence interval and not

significant (−0·17%, 95% CI −0·43 to 0·09; p=0·20; 
figure 2). Outcomes of the 34 women (17 CGM and 
17 control group) who conceived during the 24-week 
planning pregnancy trial did not differ (figure 2, 
appendix p 5).
We found no evidence of heterogeneity in the CGM 
treatment effect across countries and no heterogeneity 
across differing baseline HbA1c levels or for differing 
methods of insulin delivery (appendix p 6). Adjustment 
for baseline covariates including maternal education, 
smoking, body-mass index, duration of diabetes, and 
episodes of severe hypoglycaemia during the 12 months 
before enrolment also did not change the treatment effect.
Although every effort was made to ensure complete 
HbA1c datasets, this was not achieved because of missing 
samples (~20%) owing to withdrawals, lost samples, or 
participants being unavailable (admissions or preterm 
delivery). For the primary outcome, the patterns of 
change were similar between analyses of imputed and 
available HbA1c data (appendix p 6).
In the pregnancy trial, the women in the CGM group 
spent increased time in the recommended glucose 
control target range of 3·5–7·8 mmol/L and reduced 
time above target compared with those in the control 
group at 34 weeks’ gestation (table 3). Women in the 
CGM group also had reduced glucose SD, lower mean 
amplitude of glucose excursion, and non-significantly 
reduced glucose coefficient of variation, suggesting less 
glycaemic variability (table 3). The improvement in 
glucose control was achieved without increased maternal 
hypo 
glycaemia, gestational weight gain, or total daily 
insulin dose, but with an increase in the rate of change in 
glucose concentrations. Apart from an increase in the 
rate of change in glucose concentrations, we found no 
between-group differences in the secondary glycaemic 
outcomes in the planning pregnancy trial (appendix p 8).
Total incidence of severe hypoglycaemia episodes 
across pregnancy did not differ between groups (table 3). 
CGM measures showed comparable time spent below 
target and comparable biochemical hypoglycaemia 
events at 34 weeks’ gestation (table 3). Overnight and 
daytime CGM measures displayed a similar pattern, with 
increased time in target, and decreased hyperglycaemia 
in women in the CGM group in both the overnight and 
daytime periods (appendix pp 9–10). The CGM measures 
were comparable in insulin pump and injection users 
(appendix pp 11–12).
In the pregnancy trial, we observed no between-group 
differences in hypertensive disorders, pre-eclampsia, 
caesarean delivery, gestational age, or preterm delivery

(table 4). Between-group differences in time in target, 
hyperglycaemia, and glucose variability became apparant 
in late gestation in the pregnancy trial with no differences 
at either timepoint in the pregnancy planning trial 
(appendix pp 13–14).
For neonatal outcomes, we found a decreased proportion 
of large for gestational age (odds ratio 0·51, 95% CI 
0·28–0·90; p=0·0210) in the infants of mothers randomly 
assigned to CGM (figure 3, table 4). Despite substantial 
variation in birthweight across countries, we did not detect 
any differences in the effect of CGM on the proportion of 
infants large for gestational age across countries (likeli-
hood ratio for heterogeneity 0·14; p=0·99; appendix p 25), 
although the trial was not powered to detect anything less 
than substantial heterogeneity.
Infants of mothers randomised to CGM experienced 
fewer neonatal intensive care admissions lasting more 
than 24 h (odds ratio 0·48, 95% CI 0·26–0·86; p=0·0157), 
fewer incidences of neonatal hypoglycaemia requiring 
treatment with intravenous dextrose (0·45, 0·22–0·89; 
p=0·0250), and a reduced total length of hospital stay 
(p=0·0091) than did infants of control participants 
(figure 3, table 4). Therefore, six women would need to be 
treated to prevent one neonatal intensive care unit 
admission over 24 h and one large-for-gestational-age 
infant, and eight women to prevent one neonatal 
hypoglycaemia event. We found no differences in the 
composite fetal outcome, cord blood C-peptide levels, and 
neonatal anthropometric measure 
ments (table 4, appendix 
pp 15–16).
The obstetric and neonatal outcomes of the 34 women 
who conceived during the planning pregnancy trial are 
shown separately (appendix p 17). Their small numbers 
preclude further statistical analyses.
We found no between-group differences in any of the 
patient-reported outcome measures (appendix pp 18–19). 
Significant group × time interaction effects were obtained 
for the BGMSRQ total score (p=0·0431) and the HFS 
Behavior subscale (p=0·0347) during pregnancy. This 
result suggests that pregnant women in both groups 
became more satisfied over time, with satisfaction 
increasing slightly more in women in the CGM group. 
Hypoglycaemia avoidance behaviours decreased over time 
in women in the CGM group, but stayed constant over 
time in those in the control group (appendix p 18). CGM 
satisfaction scores indicated overall favourable ratings 
(mean scores 3·66–3·78 on a 4-point scale) in both trials.
More participants in the CGM groups experienced 
adverse events than in the control groups, with 
recognised CGM frus 
trations affecting more than 80% of 
women (table 5; appendix pp 20, 22). The most common 
adverse events in both groups were skin reactions, 
occurring in 49 (48%) of 103 CGM participants and 
eight (8%) of 104 control participants during pregnancy 
and in 23 (44%) of 52 CGM participants and five (9%) of 
57 control participants in the planning pregnancy trial 
(appendix p 20). During pregnancy the proportion of 
antenatal hos 
pital admissions was comparable between 
both groups (appendix p 21).

Few serious adverse events occurred (15 in the pregnancy 
group and three in the planning pregnancy group), with 
no between-group differences in either the pregnancy or 
planning pregnancy trial (table 5, appendix p 22). The 
most common serious adverse events were gastrointestinal 
(nausea and vomiting in four participants during preg-
nancy and three participants planning pregnancy).
Because of the unexpected difference in unscheduled 
contacts, we did a post-hoc analysis adding the total 
number of unscheduled contacts that were not purely 
sensor-related to the main ANCOVA model. This 
addition had minimal impact on the CGM treatment 
effect estimate which remained significant (p=0·0427, 
appendix p 7). Furthermore, the number of unscheduled 
contacts appeared unrelated to the change in HbA1c 
(appendix p 23).
Discussion
In this multicentre international, randomised controlled 
trial, women with type 1 diabetes randomised to CGM 
during early pregnancy had a small but significantly 
greater reduction in HbA1c levels than did the control 
participants, accompanied by increased time in target, 
reduced hyperglycaemia, and less glycaemic variability at 
34 weeks’ gestation. In these women, we found reductions 
in the proportion of infants large for gestational age, 
neonatal hypoglycaemia, and admission to neonatal 
intensive care, and a 1-day shorter hospital stay among 
their infants. In women who were planning pregnancy, 
the point estimate of glycaemic change with CGM use 
was of a similar magnitude but with greater uncertainty, 
potentially due to smaller sample size or greater variation.
The numbers of pregnant women needed to treat with 
CGM to prevent one complication are six for both 
neonatal intensive care admission and large for 
gestational age, and eight for neonatal hypoglycaemia. 
Further health-economic analyses will be required to 
understand the costs of CGM and its implementation 
into antenatal care, which might be offset by the reduction 
in neonatal intensive care admissions and reduced 
hospital stay.
The mechanisms for the improved neonatal outcomes 
in mothers randomly assigned to CGM during early 
pregnancy are unclear. The reduction in large for 
gestational age was seen both in countries with higher 
(Canada and UK) and with lower (Italy and Spain) 
prevalence. The clinically small improvement in HbA1c 
seems unlikely to be the sole explanation for the observed 
reductions in neonatal complications. We chose HbA1c as 
the primary outcome because of its strong clinical validity, 
but it has well established limitations during pregnancy 
when HbA1c levels are influenced by gestational changes 
in red cell turnover, anaemia, and iron supplementation.29–31 
Pregnant CGM users spent 68% of their time within the 
recommended glycaemic control target range compared 
with 61% for their control counterparts, translating to an 
additional 1·7 h/day in target. Pregnant CGM users also 
spent 27% of their time above 7·8 mmol/L compared 
with 32% for control participants, equivalent to 
approximately 1 h less per day spent hyperglycaemic. 
These direct CGM measures of day-to-day exposure to 
maternal hyperglycaemia might be more relevant for 
neonatal outcomes than are surrogate markers such 
as HbA1c.

In the authors’ clinical experience, women are 
uncomfortable changing treatment modality during 
early pregnancy, and thus starting CGM in women 
planning pregnancy seemed logical. The direct CGM 
measures suggest a lower mean glucose and 5% higher 
time in target (1·2 h/day) but these were not significant 
(appendix p 8). Longer periods of CGM recordings might 
have increased the statistical power of the study. We 
found a similar between-group difference in HbA1c levels, 
but with wide confidence intervals, either due to smaller 
sample size or more variation in the treatment effect. 
The motivation of participants planning pregnancy for 
optimising glucose control might have also been more 
variable than the motivation of pregnant participants, 
although 50% of CGM participants and 40% of control 
group participants in the planning pregnancy trial did 
achieve their glycaemic control target.
During pregnancy, CGM users had slightly more 
frequent scheduled and notably more unscheduled 
contacts. Problems encountered with CGM use were 
commonplace, with more than 80% of women reporting 
frustrations of CGM use, such as connectivity issues, 
alarms, and calibration errors, and almost 50% ex-
periencing skin reactions, such as bleeding, erythema, 
and discomfort. The increased contacts for sensor-related 
diabetes management issues might also reflect the 
heightened anxiety of pregnant women seeing the 
288 daily glucose values in real time, and the initial 
support required to incorporate CGM data into their 
diabetes routines. The increased rate of change of glucose 
concentrations most likely reflects CGM users’ actions 
taken in response to out-of-range glucose levels. Post-hoc 
analysis showed that adjusting for additional contacts did 
not affect treatment effect and was unrelated to changes 
in HbA1c. Furthermore, contact for non-sensor related 
issues did not differ between groups.
It is difficult to make direct comparison with the smaller 
previous studies that included pregnant women with 
both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We found a greater effect 
on neonatal outcomes, which is probably due to our 
larger sample size (compared with 46 and 119 type 1 
diabetes pregnancies in UK and Danish trials18,19), 
advances in sensor technology, and improved CGM 
compliance. The UK study18 of intermittent masked CGM 
achieved a larger between-group difference in maternal 
HbA1c levels, but with less effect on large for ges-
tational age. The direct CGM measures suggested that 
although women achieved lower mean HbA1c (5·8% or 
40 mmol/mol), they spent only 56% of time in target, 
33% above target, and 13% below target.15 The Danish 
trial19 used an earlier CGM technology intermittently with 
one real-time CGM on five occasions for the intervention 
group.19 They reported comparable HbA1c and glucose 
control to the UK study (58% in target, 28% above, and 
14% below target based on capillary glucose levels).
Our pregnant CGM users spent substantially higher 
time in target (68%) compared with previous studies, 
with approximately 10% or 2·4 h/day less hypoglycaemia. 
Of note, 19 (16%) of 119 Danish women had 59 severe 
hypoglycaemia episodes19 compared with 23 (11%) of 
207 women with 39 severe hypoglycaemia episodes in 
our study. This suggests that, over the past decade, the 
burden of severe hypoglycaemia has substantially 
reduced. Only a minority of pregnant women (<20%) 
were using pumps with insulin suspend features, so this 
alone does not explain the reduced incidence of maternal 
hypoglycaemia. However, exposure to hyperglycaemia—
the so-called prandial problem—persists. Post-prandial 
hyperglycaemia was also evident in our recent closed-
loop study in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes,32 
which achieved comparable time in target to the CGM 
users in the present study. These results indicate that 
additional strategies might be required to minimise post-
prandial excursions, such as faster acting insulins or 
adjunctive therapies. Automated insulin delivery options 
might also give women more confidence to administer 
larger pre-meal boluses, especially for the evening meal, 
with less fear of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Notably, 
although women in the CGM group showed a greater 
decrease in hypoglycaemia avoidance behaviour than did 
women in the control group, they did not have less worry, 
suggesting that automated insulin delivery might be 
more effective for reduction in maternal fear of 
hypoglycaemia.
Compared with the landmark Juvenile Diabetes 
Research Foundation study17 in which 90% of adults were 
using pump therapy, the CGM group in our study 
included more than 50% women on multiple daily 
injections.17 These women did just as well in terms of 
their treatment response and had lower absolute HbA1c 
levels compared with women using insulin pump 
therapy. The finding that the treatment effect of CGM is 
comparable between pump and injection users is very 
important for widening access to technology. This result 
is consistent with recent CGM studies outside of 
pregnancy which focused specifically on multiple 
injection users.33,34 These studies using more recent CGM 
technology achieved sensor compliance approaching 
90% use, with another trial35 of a newer flash CGM device 
showing that users in the CGM group accessed their

glucose levels 15 times per day compared with 
5·6 capillary glucose tests.35
We note that even with the improvement obtained with 
CGM use, pregnancy outcomes remained suboptimal, 
with a high proportion of infants large for gestational age 
and high levels of neonatal morbidity. The UK pregnancy 
in diabetes audit, which used the same customised 
birthweight charts, reported a lower proportion of infants 
large for gestational age (46%) despite higher maternal 
HbA1c levels in early and late pregnancy and fewer women 
achieving target HbA1c levels (40% compared with 66% of 
pregnant CGM users).9 These results suggest that, in 
addition to glucose, other nutrients might also be 
important. We also note that pregnant women in our 
study were in the overweight range and weight gain was 
higher than what is recommended by the Institute of 
Medicine.36 In addition to hyperglycaemia, these issues 
will need to be addressed to improve pregnancy outcomes 
in women with type 1 diabetes.
Our trial has several strengths. First, the sample size for 
the pregnancy trial was large enough to provide statistical 
power for a range of clinically relevant maternal and 
neonatal outcomes. Second, our trial has a robust 
randomised controlled design with prior publication of 
the clinical study protocol, CGM treatment algorithms, 
prespecified statistical analyses, central laboratory HbA1c 
assays, and direct CGM measures of glycaemia. Third, it 
has high external validity, including 31 antenatal clinics 
with variable diabetes technology experience and providing 
results that are applicable to pregnant women using 
insulin pumps or multiple daily injections. The data for 
maternal and neonatal health outcomes are more than 
99% complete.
However, our trial also has some limitations. The 
planning pregnancy trial did not have sufficient power to 
detect the magnitude of differences that were significant 
in the pregnancy trial. Although every effort was made to 
ensure complete HbA1c and CGM datasets, this was not 
achieved because of missing or lost samples, withdrawals, 
and pregnancy losses or delivery before 34 weeks. 
However, the percentage of missing data (~20%) fell 
within the prespecified power calculation assumptions 
and the patterns of change were similar in analyses of 
imputed and of available HbA1c data. Women entering the 
trial had to demonstrate willingness to use CGM before 
randomisation. Unfortunately, we do not have data on the 
frequency of capillary glucose monitoring and its 
relationship to glucose control or on the use of insulin 
suspension. We observed more unscheduled contacts for 
women in the CGM group than in the control group. We 
also acknowledge that there are potential differences 
between the CGM data collected using real-time sensors 
in the CGM group and masked sensors in the control 
group, and a large number of statistical tests were 
conducted without adjustment for multiple testing.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to show an effect 
of continuous glucose monitoring on health outcomes 
other than glycaemic outcomes, and with substantial 
reductions in neonatal complications attrib 
uted to 
maternal hyperglycaemia. The results were consistent 
across 31 international study sites and comparable for 
women using insulin pumps or multiple daily injec-
tions, regardless of baseline glucose control. Our data 
indicate a role for offering CGM to all pregnant women 
with type 1 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy in the 
first trimester.
