SUMMARY
The relation between gut microbiota and the host has
been suggested to benefit metabolic homeostasis.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipocytes
facilitate thermogenesis to maintain host core body
temperature during cold exposure. However, the po-
tential impact of gut microbiota on the thermogenic
process is confused. Here, we evaluated how BAT
and white adipose tissue (WAT) responded to temper-
ature challenges in mice lacking gut microbiota. We
found that microbiota depletion via treatment with
different cocktails of antibiotics (ABX) or in germ-
free (GF) mice impaired the thermogenic capacity of
BAT by blunting the increase in the expression of un-
coupling protein 1 (UCP1) and reducing the browning
process of WAT. Gavage of the bacterial metabolite
butyrate increased the thermogenic capacity of
ABX-treated mice, reversing the deficit. Our results
indicate that gut microbiota contributes to upregu-
lated thermogenesis in the cold environment and
that this may be partially mediated via butyrate.
INTRODUCTION
In the last decade, it has been shown that adult humans have
active depots of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and that the size
and activity of such depots is reduced in people with obesity
(Cypess et al., 2009; Guilherme et al., 2008; Nedergaard et al.,
2007; Pfannenberg et al., 2010; Saito et al., 2009). This has refu-
eled speculation that obesity may be caused by lowered BAT
activity (Speakman, 2013), as was originally speculated in the
1970s (Rothwell and Stock, 1979). A diverse microbial commu-
nity resides in the alimentary tracts of all mammalian species,
comprising mainly bacteria but also including fungi, viruses,
archaea, and protozoa. Normally, gut microbiota refers to anaer-
obic bacteria, which are numerically dominant (Maier et al., 2014;
Qin et al., 2010). The host gut provides a suitable habitat for
particular bacterial groups, and in turn, gut microbiota contrib-
utes nutrients and energy to the host (den Besten et al., 2013;
Donohoe et al., 2011; Flint et al., 2012; Seedorf et al., 2014).
Recent reports indicated that the composition of gut microbiota
alters during cold challenge, and the transfer of ‘‘cold micro-
biota’’ increases white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, energy
expenditure, and cold tolerance (Chevalier et al., 2015). The
same group also reported that both antibiotic-treated and
germ-free mice have a browning phenotype in their WAT at
room temperature (22�C) and at thermoneutrality (30�C), sug-
gesting that depleting microbiota enhances thermogenic capac-
ity. They concluded that the elimination of microbiota increased
eosinophil infiltration and enhanced type 2 cytokine signaling
and M2 macrophage polarization in WAT, which drives the
browning process (Sua
´ rez-Zamorano et al., 2015). Most previ-
ous studies have focused on the browning of WAT, but the
impact of microbiota on the interscapular BAT has been less
studied. This is a serious omission because BAT is the major
source of adaptive thermogenic heat production (Cannon and
Nedergaard, 2004). This raises the obvious question of whether
BAT thermogenesis is responsive to microbiota composition and
what impact the microbiota has on both BAT and WAT under
different temperature challenges (Wang et al., 2016). This ques-
tion is made all the more important because recent work has
questioned whether macrophages synthesize catecholamines
and concluded that they do not affect adaptive thermogenesis
(Fischer et al., 2017). However, this was the primary mechanism
previously suggested to link microbiota to adaptive browning.
Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to re-evaluate
the effects of gut microbiota on the adaptive thermogenesis of
mice and to further evaluate the role of type 2 cytokine signaling
in the regulation of brown and beige adipocyte activity. We show
that microbiota depletion does not promote the browning of
WAT at room temperature; conversely, the adaptive thermo-
genic capacity of BAT and WAT under cold challenge is impaired
when the microbiota is depleted.

 RESULTS
Gut Microbiota Depletion Damages Thermoregulation
To explore the effect of gut microbiota depletion on thermogen-
esis in mice, we administered an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) in the
drinking water (Abt et al., 2012; Hill et al., 2012; Sua
´ rez-Zamorano
et al., 2015) for 3–4 weeks. Immediately following antibiotic treat-
ment, body weight dropped and then 1 week later slowly recov-
ered (Figures S1A and S1B). Microbiota depletion significantly
changed the morphology of the small intestine, cecum, and
colon (Figure S1C). These components of the intestines of ABX
mice were significantly longer (2-way ANOVA, F1,21 = 55.43,
p < 0.0001) and the cecum was highly enlarged (2-way ANOVA,
F1,21 = 55.43, p < 0.05) (Figure S1D). The morphology of the fecal
pellets was also significantly changed (Figure S1E). To determine
the impacts on thermogenic function, we conducted a cold-
response experiment. Compared to the specific-pathogen-free
mice housed under conventional conditions (control), ABX mice
had impaired thermoregulation when acutely exposed to an
ambient temperature of 4�C (Figure 1A). Control mice were able
to sustain body temperature at a significantly higher level than
the ABX-treated individuals (2-way ANOVA, F12,72 = 8.863,
p < 0.0001). At room temperature, ABX mice also had significantly
lower core body temperatures (2-tailed Mann-Whitney test,
p = 0.027) (Figure 1B). This was consistent with the Ucp1 gene
expression, which was significantly lower in both BAT (2-way
ANOVA, F1,22 = 54.98, p < 0.0001) and subcutaneous WAT
(scWAT) (2-way ANOVA, F1,22 = 8.938, p = 0.0068) of ABX mice
under cold stimulation for 48 h (Figures 1C and 1D). In contrast
to a previous study (Sua
´ rez-Zamorano et al., 2015), we failed to
observe any effect of ABX treatment on Ucp1 gene expression
in both BAT (2-way ANOVA, F1,37 = 13.18, p > 0.9999) and scWAT
(2-way ANOVA, F1,42 = 8.817, p > 0.9999) at room temperature
(22�C) and thermoneutrality (30�C) (Figures 1E and 1F). Protein
levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) were also not significantly
elevated in scWAT (2-way ANOVA, F1,18 = 0.8266, p = 0.603)
of ABX mice compared to control mice at 22�C (Figures 1G
and 1J). Moreover, the protein levels of UCP1 were significant
lower in ABX mice after cold stimulation in both BAT (2-way
ANOVA, F1,20 = 8.212, p = 0.0037) and scWAT (2-way ANOVA,
F1,18 = 0.8266, p = 0.0079) (Figures 1H and 1K), which is consis-
tent with their impaired ability to maintain body temperature
under cold challenge (Figure 1A). These data indicate that the
depletion of microbiota impairs the adaptive thermogenic capac-
ity of both BAT and scWAT. We also did not observe any differ-
ences in expression of a core set of thermogenic genes in perigo-
nadal visceral adipose tissue (pgVAT) at 22�C and 4�C between
the control and ABX groups (Figure S1F). However, expression
of some genes in pgVAT was higher in ABX at 30�C (Figure S1F).
Consistent with previous reports, the expression levels of Ucp1 in
different tissues indicated that BAT is the key tissue for thermo-
genesis compared to scWAT and pgVAT (Cannon and Neder-
gaard, 2004) (Figure S1G).
Methionine sulfoxide, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Sobrino
et al., 1988), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Hoff-
mann et al., 2015), and pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) levels in
serum were significantly higher in control mice at both 22�C
and 4�C compared to ABX individuals. In contrast, 11b-prosta-
glandin F2awas significantly lower in control mice at both 22�C
and 4�C. A previous study reported that the gut microbiota
may regulate tryptophan metabolism through tryptophan hy-
droxylase and promote serotonin biosynthesis (Yano et al.,
2015). Both germ-free (GF) and ABX mice displayed deficient
peripheral serotonin and higher tryptophan concentrations.
Consistent with previous studies, we also found that tryptophan
was significantly elevated in ABX-treated mice (Figure S1H;
Table S1). Our results suggest that microbiota depletion re-
presses the expression of Ucp1, and UCP1 thus impairs adap-
tive thermogenesis in BAT and scWAT at both 22�C and 4�C.
Gut Microbiota Depletion Reduces the Energy
Metabolism of the Host
Many studies previously reported that gut microbiota may influ-
ence diverse biological phenomena (Flint et al., 2012; Sommer
and Ba
¨ ckhed, 2013; Tremaroli and Ba
¨ ckhed, 2012; Zhao,
2013). To evaluate whether ABX-mediated impairment of ther-
mogenesis of BAT and scWAT contributes to whole-body energy
expenditure, we used indirect calorimetry. At 22�C, ABX mice
had �13% lower oxygen consumption (VO2) (Figures 2A and
2C) compared to control mice (2-way ANOVA, F2,35 = 23.34,
p = 0.0304) without any significant differences in the respiratory
exchange ratio (RER) (2-way ANOVA, F2,31 = 0.1243, p = 0.5681)
(Figures 2D and 2F) or physical activity (2-way ANOVA, F2,29 =
1.333, p > 0.9999) (Figures 2G and 2I). Compared to 22�C,
cold exposure (4�C) enhanced energy expenditure in both con-
trol and ABX mice, which likely reflects the activation of cold-
induced thermogenesis. However, ABX mice had �17% lower
oxygen consumption (Figures 2B and 2C) compared to control
mice at 4�C (2-way ANOVA, F2,35 = 23.34, p < 0.0001), again,
with no impact on the RER (Figures 2E and 2F) (2-way ANOVA,
F2,31 = 0.1243, p = 0.8186) and physical activity (2-way
ANOVA, F2,29 = 1.333, p = 0.7487) (Figures 2H and 2I). At the
same time, ABX mice had smaller metabolic changes in
response to the circadian cycle compared to control mice at
4�C (Figure 2B). To evaluate whether the lower body mass
following the initial antibiotic treatment influenced the thermo-
genesis process (Figures S1A and S1B), we generated a new
mice group that was pair fed (PF) to match the energy absorption
of the ABX group each day. The similar pattern of change in
body weight between ABX and PF mice (Figure S2A) indicated
that this pair feeding was effective. Both ABX and PF groups
had lower body weight compared to control individuals (2-way

 repeated-measures ANOVA, F59,1,593 = 125.9, p < 0.0001) (Fig-
ure S2A) and fat mass from different anatomic sites (Figures
S2E–S2G). Based on the difference in daily energy intake (Fig-
ure S2B) and the fecal energy losses (Figure S2C), ABX mice
had a significantly lower assimilation efficiency (2-way ANOVA,
F17,442 = 8.617, p < 0.0001) (Figure S2D).
At 22�C, there was no significant difference in the oxygen con-
sumption rate between PF and ABX mice (2-way ANOVA, F2,35 =
23.34, p > 0.9999) (Figures 2A and 2C). However, PF mice had a
significantly higher cold-induced energy expenditure (�25%
higher) compared to ABX mice (2-way ANOVA, F2,35 = 23.34,
p < 0.0001) (Figure 2C). During the daytime, the RER of the PF
group was lower (1-way ANOVA, F5,295 = 126, p < 0.0001) than
the control and ABX groups, partly because they ate their ration
of food in the night and hence had no food available in the day.
The physical activity of PF mice also showed increasing food
anticipation behavior at �16:30 h (1-way ANOVA, F5,50 = 11.53,
p < 0.0001), which was 30 min before the feed time of 17:00 h (Fig-
ures 2G and 2H), but total physical activity was not significantly
different (2-way ANOVA, F2,29 = 1.333, p = 0.2794) (Figure 2I).
Furthermore, we compared expression of the core thermo-
genic genes in BAT and scWAT and found that PF mice had a
significantly higher expression of Ucp1 compared to ABX mice
(Figures 2J, 2K, and S2H). These data for PF mice suggested
that energy intake and the temporarily lowered body weight
observed in ABX mice were not the cause of lower energy expen-
diture and thermogenic capacity. Instead, the data on whole-
body energy expenditure (Figures 2A–2C) and UCP1 protein
expression in BAT and scWAT (Figures 1G–1L) supported the
idea that the depletion of microbiota impaired the thermogenesis
of BAT and scWAT.
Alternatively Activated Macrophages Do Not Affect
Energy Metabolism and Thermogenesis in ABX Mice
According to previous studies, type 2 cytokine signaling and
alternative macrophage activation (M2) play a key role in the
browning process of scWAT across the temperature range
from 30�C to 4�C, and these may mediate the impact of micro-
biota on thermoregulation (Nguyen et al., 2011; Sua
´ rez-Zamor-
ano et al., 2015). We therefore measured the gene expression
of M1 and M2 markers (CD274, Nos2, Arg1, Mrc1, Clec10, and
Ccr3), a marker of eosinophils (SiglecF), and the profiles of
some type 2 cytokines (interleukin-4 [IL-4], IL-5, and IL-33) using
qPCR. We observed no significant differences of these genes in
BAT, scWAT, and pgVAT between control and ABX mice at
different environment temperatures (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A).
By using flow cytometry (Figures S3B and S3C), we also found
no evidence for the enhancement of eosinophil and alternative
activated macrophage populations in BAT, scWAT, and pgVAT
of the control mice after cold stimulation (Figures 3C–3E).
Conversely, we noticed that the portion of M2 macrophages in
total immune cells was significantly decreased in BAT (2-way
ANOVA, F1,20 = 0.5253, p = 0.0008) and scWAT (2-way
ANOVA, F1,20 = 0.1078, p < 0.0001) in control mice at 4�C
compared to that at 22�C. However, ABX mice had an increase
of alternative activated macrophages in BAT (2-way ANOVA,
F1,20 = 0.5253, p < 0.0001), scWAT (2-way ANOVA, F1,20 =
0.1078, p = 0.0006), and pgVAT (2-way ANOVA, F1,20 = 0.6391,
p = 0.0168) (Figures 3C–3E) at 4�C compared to 22�C. At
22�C, ABX mice had fewer M2 macrophages in BAT (2-way
ANOVA, F1,20 = 0.5253, p < 0.0001), scWAT (2-way ANOVA,
F1,20 = 0.1078, p < 0.0001), and pgVAT (2-way ANOVA, F1,20 =
36.86, p < 0.0001) compared to control mice (Figures 3C and
3D). Consistent with a previous study (Sua
´ rez-Zamorano et al.,
2015), we found that ABX mice had significantly more eosino-
phils in scWAT (2-way ANOVA, F1,20 = 0.8922, p = 0.0085) and
pgVAT (2-way ANOVA, F1,20 = 16.77, p = 0.0012) compared to
control mice at 22�C (Figures 3D and 3E). After cold exposure,
however, the population of eosinophils in ABX mice decreased
and was significantly lower in BAT compared to control mice
(2-way ANOVA, F1,20 = 3.385, p = 0.0077) (Figures 3D and 3E).
We further measured several type 2 cytokines, including IL-4
(2-way ANOVA, F1,43 = 0.3194, p = 0.5749), IL-5 (2-way
ANOVA, F1,43 = 2.809, p = 0.1010), and IL-33 (2-way ANOVA,
F1,43 = 2.125, p = 0.1524) in scWAT by ELISA, but again, de-
tected no significant difference between the control and the
ABX groups (Figure 3F). To further assess the function of IL-4
on energy metabolism, we evaluated the metabolic effect of
chronic IL-4 treatment in control and ABX mice housed at 23�C
± 1�C. We administered IL-4 (50 mg/kg) daily for 5 days. Mea-
surement of the daily energy expenditure (DEE) during this period
revealed no differential effect caused by IL-4 compared to PBS
either in the control (2-way ANOVA, F3,9 = 2.960, p = 0.7155)
group or in the ABX (2-way ANOVA, F3,9 = 2.960, p = 0.9713)
group (Figure 3H); there was also no influence on RER and phys-
ical activity (Figures S3D and S3E). At the same time, IL-4 could
induce M2 polarization in BAT and scWAT in the control group,
confirming that IL-4 works well but did not increase the expres-
sion of Ucp1 either in BAT or in scWAT from both groups (2-way
ANOVA, F3,30 = 70.75, p > 0.9999) (Figures S3F–S3H). These
results suggest that type 2 immune signaling and alternative
macrophage activation are unlikely to make a direct contribution
to adaptive thermogenesis, which is consistent with another
recent study (Fischer et al., 2017).
To probe whether microbiota depletion induced lower-body
fat mass (Figures S2E–S2G), leading to the impaired release of
free fatty acids (the principal substrate for BAT thermogenesis),
we measured circulating free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride

group).

 (TG) levels. No significant decrease in circulating FFA (2-way
ANOVA, F1,43 = 0.03571, p = 0.8518) and triglyceride (2-way
ANOVA, F1,40 = 0.8681, p = 0.3571) was observed when micro-
biota was depleted (Figure 3I). At the same time, insulin (2-way
ANOVA, F1,17 = 6.463, p = 0.0210) and leptin (2-way ANOVA,
F1,18 = 11.58, p = 0.0032) of ABX mice were significantly lower
than control mice (Figure 3I). It was potentially the case, there-
fore, that microbiota depletion could have impeded the synthesis
of noradrenaline, which is important for lipolysis and thermogen-
esis. We measured the noradrenaline content in scWAT, and
there was no significant difference between control and ABX
mice (2-way ANOVA, F1,17 = 2.674, p = 0.1204) (Figure 3G). In
summary, we failed to demonstrate any significant relation be-
tween thermogenesis and type 2 cytokine signaling and alterna-
tive macrophage activation. Moreover, microbiota depletion did
not promote browning via the enhancement of type 2 cytokine
signaling in scWAT. Even though at 22�C ABX mice had more
eosinophils in scWAT and pgVAT than in control mice, we
observed no difference in Ucp1 expression. Our data are consis-
tent with the recent report that type 2 cytokines have no function
in thermogenesis (Fischer et al., 2017).
The Characteristic Energy Metabolism of GF Mice
To assess whether our results could be explained by antibiotic
toxicity effects on thermogenesis, we used GF mice to further
verify our results. The core results in GF mice were consistent
with the data we obtained from ABX mice. At room temperature,
GF mice had a significantly lower core body temperature
(35.88�C
±
0.25�C)
compared
to
specific-pathogen-free
(SPF) mice (36.83�C ± 0.12�C) (2-tailed Mann-Whitney test,
p = 0.0041) (Figure 4A) without a thermal conductance difference
(1-way ANOVA, F2,10 = 50.15, p = 0.9888) (Figure S4A). Using the
doubly labeled water (DLW) technique (Speakman, 1997), we
measured the energy metabolism of GF mice and found that
GF mice had lower DEEs than SPF mice, despite being substan-
tially heavier (2-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001). Across the
SPF individuals, the body mass averaged 26.22 ± 0.27 g and DEE
averaged 42.50 ± 1.24 kJ/day (n = 16). In the GF mice, the equiv-
alent values were 34.04 ± 1.02 g and 18.61 ± 1.27 kJ/day (n = 12)
(Figure 4B). Furthermore, we observed no beneficial effect of the
absence of microbiota in GF mice on the browning in scWAT by
either qPCR (2-way ANOVA, F1,16 = 17.79, p > 0.9999) or western
blot analysis (2-way ANOVA, F1,16 = 12.55, p = 0.1584) compared
to SPF mice (Figures 4C and 4D). These observations contrast
the previous study, which suggested that GF mice have more
Ucp1 in scWAT (Sua
´ rez-Zamorano et al., 2015). We observed
no significant differences in the expression profiles of markers
of adipocyte differentiation or mitochondrial electron transport-
related genes in the scWAT of GF mice (Figure 4C). Furthermore,
the UCP1 expression in BAT was significantly reduced (�55%)
(2-way ANOVA, F1,16 = 12.55, p = 0.0307), but there was no
change in the hormone-sensitive lipase levels (2-tailed Mann-
Whitney test, p = 0.1508) (Figure 4D). Notably, despite the
significant upregulation of IL-4 (2-tailed Mann-Whitney test,
p = 0.0003), IL-5 (p = 0.0047), and IL-33 (p = 0.003) in the scWAT
of GF mice, there were no differences in the expression of ther-
mogenic genes, suggesting that type 2 cytokines are not the
key drivers of the browning process in the GF model (Figure 4E).
Rather, upregulation of these cytokines may be compensation
for the compromised immune system of GF mice (Arpaia et al.,
2013; Brestoff and Artis, 2013; Hill et al., 2012). Noradrenaline
levels were also higher in the scWAT of GF mice (2-tailed
Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.0648) (Figure 4E). This suggested that
scWAT of GF mice was resistant to noradrenaline-induced
browning. To demonstrate whether this was the case, we admin-
istrated SPF and GF mice with CL-316243 (1 mg/kg) for 2 days.
The dose of CL-316243 that each GF mouse received was
significantly higher than that for SPF mice based on their greater
body weight, but notably, the amount of UCP1 protein in the
scWAT of GF mice post-treatment was significantly lower
(1-way ANOVA F1,6 = 5.98, p = 0.04) (Figure 4F). After CL-
316243 treatment, more multilocular lipid droplets adipocytes
appeared in the scWAT of SPF mice than in GF mice, which is a
classic ‘‘browning’’ phenotype (Figure 4G). The browning of
WAT induced by CL-316243 increases the use of fatty acids as
a metabolic substrate. The weight of scWAT (2-way ANOVA,
F1,20 = 1.092, p = 0.0212) and pgVAT (2-way ANOVA, F1,20 =
1.648, p = 0.0032) significantly decreased in the SPF group
(Figure S4B), and the content of FFA was reduced (2-way
ANOVA, F1,21 = 14.59, p = 0.0003) but not in GF mice (2-way
ANOVA, F1,21 = 14.59, p > 0.9999) (Figures 4H and S4C). Triglyc-
eride decreased in both the SPF group (2-way ANOVA, F1,21 =
103.5, p < 0.0001) and the GF group (2-way ANOVA, F1,21 =
103.5, p = 0.0008). With the decrease in fat mass, leptin content
was also reduced in SPF mice, but adiponectin levels were
unchanged (Figure 4H). These results further support our conclu-
sion that type 2 cytokines cannot promote the browning of
scWAT. Despite higher levels of type 2 cytokines and norepi-
nephrine, microbiota depletion did not promote the browning of
scWAT in GF mice.

 Depletion of the Microbiota by Different ABX Protocols
Have Similar Physiological Effects
We explored whether ABX affected b3-adrenoceptor activation.
Oxygen consumption in response to CL-316243 at room tem-
perature was significantly and rapidly elevated in control mice
compared to PBS treatment (2-way ANOVA, F22,22 = 12.39,
p < 0.0001). However, this induction was severely attenuated
in ABX mice (2-way ANOVA, F22,22 = 12.39, p = 0.2178) (Fig-
ure 5A). There was no difference in the RER (2-way ANOVA,
F22,22 = 1.256, p > 0.9999) (Figure 5B) or physical activity
(2-way ANOVA, F22,22 = 7.588, p > 0.9999) (Figure S5A) between
control and ABX mice under CL-316243 treatment. Never-
theless, control mice gained significantly more UCP1 protein
(2-way ANOVA, F1,20 = 13.37, p < 0.0001) (Figure 5C) and
Ucp1 mRNA (2-way ANOVA, F1,21 = 9.244, p < 0.0001) in scWAT
(Figure 5D) under CL-316243 treatment than ABX mice did.
We next asked whether different ABX formulations could also
suppress thermogenesis. We repeated our ABX experiment
along with another published ABX protocol (referred to here as
ABX-SZ) for 30 days. Both ABX and ABX-SZ demonstrated no
difference in body weight (2-way repeated-measures ANOVA,
F21,588 = 105.1, p = 0.3635) and food intake (2-way repeated-
measures ANOVA, F21,567 = 9.962, p = 0.7) compared to control
mice after 30 days’ treatment (Figures S5B and S5C), and they
demonstrated no difference in tissue mass at different anatomic
sites between ABX and ABX-SZ (Figure S5D). Compared to con-
trol mice, both ABX and ABX-SZ mice had similar Ucp1 gene
expression levels in scWAT at room temperature (2-way
ANOVA, F1,28 = 103.4, p > 0.9999), but Ucp1 gene expression
level was significantly decreased when acutely exposed to an
ambient temperature of 4�C for 48 h (2-way ANOVA, F1,28 =
103.4, p = 0.0010) (Figure 5E). There was no difference between
ABX and ABX-SZ in oxygen consumption (2-way ANOVA, F2,9 =
3.23, p > 0.9999), RER (2-way ANOVA, F2,9 = 2.887, p = 0.1583),
and physical activity (2-way ANOVA, F2,9 = 3.835, p = 0.0784)
before and after CL-316243 treatment at room temperature (Fig-
ures 5F, S5E, and S5F). Compared to control mice, both ABX
and ABX-SZ mice showed lower oxygen consumption (2-way
ANOVA, F2,9 = 13.43, p = 0.0313) after CL-316243 treatment.
There was also no difference in RER (2-way ANOVA, F2,9 =
2.887, p > 0.9999) and physical activity (2-way ANOVA, F2,9 =
3.980, p > 0.9999) in ABX-SZ mice compared to control mice.
To determine the gene expression signatures after different
ABX treatments in fat tissue, we performed RNA-seq analysis
in scWAT and pgVAT from mice at room temperature on treat-
ment day 28. Hierarchical clustering of the differentially ex-
pressed genes among the RNA-seq samples is shown in Figures
5G, S6A, and S6B, and Table S2. The main differences in scWAT
were related to immune pathways, and no difference was found
in pgVAT between ABX and ABX-SZ (Figure S6D). Consistent
with our qPCR results, both ABX and ABX-SZ mice showed no
differences in the gene expression of Ucp1, M2 markers, or
type 2 cytokines compared to control mice. The butyrate recep-
tor Hcar2 (hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2, also known as
Gpr109a) was significantly upregulated in both ABX and ABX-
SZ mice compared to control mice, while the FFA receptors
Ffar2 (also known as Gpr43) and Ffar3 (also known as Gpr41)
showed no difference (Figure S6C). Selected gene expression
was validated by qPCR (Figure 5H). There was no difference in
gene expression pattern between ABX and ABX-SZ in pgVAT
(Table S3). Our data suggested that the depletion of the micro-
biota by different ABX protocols had similar effects and did not
promote elevated DEE and adaptive thermogenesis.
Recolonization Microbiota and Butyrate Partially
Rescue the Thermogenesis of ABX Mice
We assessed 16S rDNA contents per the fecal pellet in control,
ABX, and ABX-SZ mice by qPCR (Thackray et al., 2018). Both
ABX and ABX-SZ treatments reduced bacterial contents to
(5 ± 0.5) 3 104 pg DNA per gram fecal pellet compared to
(2.8 ± 0.2) 3 107 pg/g in control mice. These changes took place
immediately after the ABX and ABX-SZ treatments, suggesting
that both ABX protocols efficiently depleted the majority of gut
microbiota (Figure 6A). Sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons
from the cecum revealed that fewer operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) were detected from ABX and ABX-SZ groups compared
to the control group (Figure 6B). Furthermore, weighted unique
fraction metric (UniFrac) principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA)
illustrated that these 2 different antibiotic protocol treatments
(ABX and ABX-SZ) had similar impacts on the bacterial compo-
sition (Figure 6C). Lachnospiraceae (belonging to the butyrate-
producing bacteria Clostridia) were induced by cold stimulation
in control mice (Figures 6D, 6E, S7A, and S7B). PF individuals
that showed a higher Ucp1 expression level also had signifi-
cantly higher Clostridia. The DNA abundance of Clostridia in
the remaining ABX and ABX-SZ feces contents were significantly
lower than in control mice at 4�C.
We explored whether the repopulation of microbiota in ABX
mice could reverse the negative impact on WAT browning.
Immediately following the withdrawal of antibiotic treatment,
ABX mice were transferred to cages containing the old nests
and dirty bedding of control mice for 5 days. After 5 days of

 microbiota repopulation treatment, these mice were transferred
into an ambient temperature of 4�C for 48 h. We found that the
16S rDNA contents per fecal pellet measured by qPCR (Thack-
ray et al., 2018) and the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels,
including acetate, propionate, and butyrate from the cecum
feces, were significantly restored in the repopulated mice (RO)
compared to the ABX mice (Figures S7C and S7D). RO mice
had a significantly increased expression of Ucp1 (1-way
ANOVA, F2,13 = 8.492, p = 0.0036) in response to cold stimulation
compared to ABX mice (Iida et al., 2013) (Figure S7E). These data
indicated that gut microbiota recolonization benefits adaptive
thermogenesis in scWAT.
A potential mechanism by which microbiota may influence
host metabolism is via metabolites generated during micro-
bial fermentation in the gut. Previous studies reported that
commensal bacterial metabolites SCFAs, especially butyrate,
a typical histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (Candido et al.,
1978; Sealy and Chalkley, 1978), may regulate the expression
of numerous genes through different mechanisms (Arpaia
et al., 2013; Ganal et al., 2012; Kaiko et al., 2016; Marin
˜ o et al.,
2017; Olszak et al., 2012; Walsh et al., 2015). HDAC1 and
HDAC3 have been demonstrated to play a key role in the thermo-
genesis process (Emmett et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016). Most of the
butyrate in the cecum may be used by mitochondria as the en-
ergy substrate in the colon. However, some butyrate could enter
the circulation system and cross the blood-brain barrier via
monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) (Vijay and Morris, 2014).
Recent studies suggested that butyrate could activate BAT via
a direct gut-brain neural circuit (Li et al., 2018). We therefore
assessed whether exogenous butyrate would promote the
adaptive thermogenesis in mice with depleted microbiota.
Both control and ABX mice were administered butyrate sodium
(80 mg/day) for a consecutive 7 days by oral gavage at room
temperature (23�C ± 1�C). We found that the core body temper-
ature of ABX mice increased from 36.34�C ± 0.16�C to 37.07�C
± 0.22�C (2-way ANOVA, F1,26 = 0.5477, p = 0.0165), but there
was no significant effect on control mice (from 36.83�C ±
0.13�C to 36.82�C ± 0.09�C) (Figure 6F). Protein analysis showed
that butyrate treatment significantly increased UCP1 content in
BAT (1-way ANOVA, F1,6 = 5.98, p = 0.017) and scWAT (1-way
ANOVA, F1,6 = 5.98, p = 0.019) of ABX mice compared to control
mice (Figure 6G), but butyrate treatment had no influence on
body weight in control and ABX mice (Figure S7F). A recent study
suggested that butyrate decreases food intake and inhibits
orexigenic neuron activity in the hypothalamus (Li et al., 2018).
We also found that butyrate decreased food intake in the control
group, but not in the ABX-treated group (Figure S7G). The
butyrate level in the cecum feces was significantly decreased
by a factor of �1,000 in ABX (3.4 ± 0.2 mMol/g) and ABX-SZ
(3.2 ± 0.14 mMol/g) individuals. The butyrate gavage treatment
restored an �10% butyrate level (220.2 ± 54.6 mMol/g)
compared to the control group (2,352 ± 206.2 mMol/g) (Fig-
ure 6H). In contrast to the cecum feces, there was no significant
difference between control mice and ABX mice in the serum
butyrate levels after butyrate gavage. This result is consistent
with recent studies that indicated that the suppression of food
intake by butyrate gavage was independent of the circulating
butyrate levels (Chevalier et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018) (Figure S7H;
Table S4). These data suggest that the bacterial metabolite
butyrate
increased
the
energy
expenditure
and
partially
rescued the impaired thermogenesis induced by the depletion
of microbiota.
Isotope Tracing and 13C-Butyrate Metabolic Flux
Analysis In Vivo
The mechanism by which butyrate may regulate body tempera-
ture and UCP1 expression is not clear. One possible mechanism
is that oral-gavaged butyrate could be distributed to peripheral
tissues, such as BAT and WAT, when the microbiota is depleted
and the butyrate plays the role of an energy substrate or an
HDAC inhibitor. An alternative possible mechanism is that the
brain is sensitized to gut butyrate levels after ABX treatment,
and the gavaged butyrate regulates BAT through an activated
gut-brain axis. To explore these different mechanisms, we
measured whether there was a difference in exogenous butyrate
distribution using gavage of 13C-labeled butyrate. We adminis-
trated the same level of butyrate sodium to control and ABX
mice for 6 days and gavage mixed [U13C] and 12C butyrate so-
dium (1:9 ratio) at day 7. Butyrate could be used by mitochondria
after distribution and exhaled as CO2. We therefore carefully
determined the time of sacrifice at 1 h after gavage by measuring
the 13CO2 in control mice (Figure S8A). Since butyrate could
enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle via acetyl-coenzyme A
(CoA), we performed a targeted metabolite analysis for SCFA
and TCA metabolites in several tissues (Figure 7A). The uptake
of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the cecum and colon
were largely limited in ABX individuals, and the butyrate gavage
treatment could selectively restore butyrate levels in the cecum
and colon (Figures 7B, 7C, S8B, and S8C). The 13C:12C ratio of
butyrate in ABX individuals was significantly higher than that in
control individuals in the colon (7.8% ± 1.1% versus 10.5% ±
0.4%) and cecum (7.6% ± 1.1% versus 10.4% ± 0.4%) (Fig-
ure 7F). We found that several m + 2 isotopologues of TCA
metabolites such as citrate, succinate, fumarate, and malate
were significantly enriched in the brains of ABX mice compared
to control mice after butyrate gavage treatment (Figure 7D). More
important, the fractional contribution of [U13C] butyrate to citrate
was substantially higher in the brain (>1:9 ratio) than BAT,
scWAT, colon, and cecum, and the 13C:12C ratio of citrate was
significantly higher in ABX individuals (42.2% ± 4.5%) compared
to control individuals (25.3% ± 3.3%) in the brain (Figure 7F). This
result suggested that there is a selective route for butyrate from
the gut to the brain. Recent studies suggested that the enrich-
ment of succinate could activate thermogenesis in BAT (Mills

 et al., 2018), and we confirmed that the succinate levels were
higher than other TCA metabolites in the cold-stimulated BAT
(Figure 7E). There was no significant enrichment difference in
m + 4 butyrate or m + 2 TCA metabolites in BAT (Figure 7E)
and scWAT (Figures S8D and S8E) between control and ABX
mice after butyrate gavage treatment. These results indicated
that butyrate probably regulates body temperature and UCP1
expression via an activated gut-brain axis, rather than by a direct
interaction between butyrate and the adipose tissues.
DISCUSSION
Increasing numbers of studies have reported relations between
the gut microbiota and physiological states of the host in both

 mice and humans. Although some studies indicated a link be-
tween the gut microbiota and obesity and diabetes (Cani et al.,
2012; Cox and Blaser, 2013; Ley et al., 2005; Turnbaugh et al.,
2006), the impact of the gut microbiota on different adipocytes
is unclear. Since UCP1 plays a vital role in nonshivering thermo-
genesis, we focused on whether the gut microbiota affects
UCP1-dependent thermogenesis. We found that UCP1 was
blunted during an acute cold ambient temperature challenge
and after administration of a b3-adrenoceptor (Adrb3) agonist,
when the gut microbiota was absent. Our work supports the
idea of a link between gut microbiota and UCP1-dependent
thermogenesis of brown and beige (brite) adipocytes. Increasing
evidence suggests that UCP1 is not required in long-term cold
adaptation, and the glucose uptake of BAT under CL-316243
stimulation
(Keipert
et
al.,
2017)
and
UCP1-independent
thermogenic mechanisms such as creatine (Kazak et al.,
2015) or sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2b
(SERCA2b) (Ikeda et al., 2017) cycles in beige adipocytes may
also contribute to whole-body energy homeostasis. Whether
these processes are also impaired in the absence of the gut
microbiota is currently unknown.
GF and ABX mice have been used frequently to study the
impact of gut microbiota on the host (Lundberg et al., 2016;
Sivan et al., 2015; Ve
´ tizou et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017). Here,
we reported some physiological characteristics of ABX and GF
mice, including the measurement of DEE of GF animals using
the DLW technique, and b3-adrenergic-induced thermogenesis.
Many previous studies reported that ABX or GF mice resist high-
fat diet-induced obesity and have improved glucose metabolism
(Ba
¨ ckhed et al., 2004; Chevalier et al., 2015; Zarrinpar et al.,
2018). We found that UCP1 expression and whole-body energy
expenditure were blunted with the depletion of gut microbiota.
This contrasts a previous study (Sua
´ rez-Zamorano et al.,
2015), which suggested that microbiota depletion promotes
browning. The mix of antibiotics that they used differed from
what we used. Accordingly, we replicated our studies using their
antibiotic recipe (ABX-SZ) but did not find that microbiota
depletion facilitated the browning of WAT. In contrast, we found
that antibiotic-treated mice (independent of the cocktail used)
and GF mice had an impaired capacity for UCP1-dependent
thermogenesis. In addition, the downregulated UCP1 expres-
sion we observed may be considered to be inconsistent with
the improved glucose metabolism performance in the ABX
mice. However, the capacity for glucose uptake is not always
positively
correlated
with
UCP1-dependent
thermogenesis
(Olsen et al., 2017). For example, recent studies suggested
that glucose uptake is elevated in Ucp1-knockout (KO) mice
and that brown or beige adipocytes could consume glucose
via the SERCA2b pathway in an UCP1-independent manner
(Ikeda et al., 2017; Olsen et al., 2017).
A healthy gut microbiota community benefits host metabolic
homeostasis, and reciprocally, gut microbiota composition can
be shaped by ambient temperature and macronutrients from
the diet (Chevalier et al., 2015; Dey et al., 2015; Kau et al.,
2011; Turnbaugh et al., 2008; Zie
˛ tak et al., 2016). It has been sug-
gested that SCFA levels are positively associated with enhanced
energy metabolism (Donohoe et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2009; Li
et al., 2018), while other microbiota-derived metabolites such
as trimethylamine and imidazole propionate were suggested to
be negatively linked to host health (Hsiao et al., 2013; Koeth
et al., 2013; Koh et al., 2018). The microbiota-derived metabo-
lites not only play vital roles in host immune education and path-
ogen defense but are also involved in host nutrition status (Blan-
ton et al., 2016; Guglielmi, 2018). Here, we confirmed that the
energy absorption capacity declined in ABX mice; furthermore,
the PF mice results suggested that energy intake and the tempo-
rarily lowered body weight observed in ABX mice were not the
cause for the lower energy expenditure and the dampened ther-
mogenic capacity. The absence of gut microbiota, via antibiotic
treatment or in the GF model, can result in a depletion of metab-
olites generated during microbial fermentation in the gut, thereby
promoting a state of gut metabolite deficiency. Our results are
consistent with previous studies that showed that under ABX
treatment, all types of SCFAs and bile acids almost disappeared
in the cecum. A previous study showed that butyrate-producing
bacteria were increased by cold stimulation (Chevalier et al.,
2015), and we confirmed this phenotype. The expression of
Hcar2, a butyrate receptor (Offermanns, 2017), was dramatically
increased in both ABX and ABX-SZ mice compared to control
mice, while other SCFA receptors Ffar2 and Ffar3 showed no
difference. Several recent studies suggested that exogenous
butyrate could enhance host energy expenditure and promote
UCP1 expression (Gao et al., 2009; Li et al., 2018). In a pilot
study, we also found that exogenous butyrate had larger
effects than acetate and propionate (data not shown). This
led us to assess whether exogenous butyrate could rescue hy-
pothermia and promote UCP1 expression when the gut micro-
biota was absent. Using 13C-butyrate metabolic flux analysis,
we found that butyrate uptake and utilization were faster in brain
than in BAT and WAT once butyrate enters the circulation. This
suggests that butyrate possibly acts in the brain via the gut-
brain axis (Mayer et al., 2015) to regulate food intake and
thermogenesis.
In summary, these data showed that antibiotic-mediated
depletion of microbiota does not promote browning of WAT
through type 2 cytokine signaling and alternatively activated
macrophages, but rather negatively affects adaptive thermogen-
esis mediated via both interscapular BAT and the browning of
scWAT. These effects were confirmed in GF mice and in mice
treated with a different ABX. An intact microbiota may thus be
an essential component of the thermoregulatory response, and
microbial-derived butyrate may be a mediating factor in this role.
LIMITATIONS OF STUDY
Although we found that DEE and UCP1-dependent thermogen-
esis were blunted via two common ABX protocols and in GF
mice (Abt et al., 2012; Sua
´ rez-Zamorano et al., 2015), our work
has several limitations. First, it is inevitable that the background
of gut microbiota composition from our work is distinct from
other studies because of different housing conditions, diet,
sex, age, antibiotic administration route (drinking water or
gavage), and other factors (Ussar et al., 2015). This is a major
challenge for the repeatability in gut microbiota studies. Further-
more, several antibiotics have been reported to be toxic to mito-
chondria (Hangas et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018; Kalghatgi et al.,
Cell Reports 26, 2720–2737, March 5, 2019
2733
 2013; Moullan et al., 2015). It is possible that the mitochondrial
function of the host was affected by the antibiotics, even though
we obtained the same results using two rather different cock-
tails. However, we also successfully replicated some of the
data using GF mice, in which no such antibiotic artifacts would
be present. Nevertheless, a gold standard procedure for anti-
biotic treatment mice is urgently needed for gut microbiota
research. Alternatively, studies should use, as we have, multiple
cocktails of antibiotics to show that the response is not cocktail
dependent.
Second, the gut microbiota composition is complex, and even
multiple combinations of antibiotics are unable to deplete the gut
microbiota completely. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi
remain in the tract under ABX treatment; hence, it is possible
that the imbalance of gut microbiota could influence host energy
homeostasis (Dollive et al., 2013; Lopez et al., 2014; Underhill
and Iliev, 2014). Our study clearly showed that the composition
was changed under cold challenge. However, we were not
able to isolate the impact of the gut microbiome to a single spe-
cies in the microbiota. This may not be a single species effect,
and the details of this mechanism require more study.
Third, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of butyrate
inducing thermogenesis in ABX mice remains unclear. Our data
showed that the butyrate receptor Hcar2 was increased in ABX
mice, suggesting that they may be more sensitive to exogenous
butyrate. Then, the molecular function of butyrate on thermogen-
esis may be related to its role as HDAC inhibitor (Emmett et al.,
2017; Li et al., 2016; Walsh et al., 2015). Using 13C-butyrate
metabolic flux analysis, we showed that the brain uptakes and
uses more butyrate than both BAT and WAT. This is consistent
with a recent report (Li et al., 2018) suggesting that butyrate
could activate BAT through the gut-brain neural circuit. More
work is needed to explore the function of butyrate on the brain.
Lastly, we found that both 3- to 4-week treated ABX and GF
mice showed hypothermia and attenuated energy expenditure
after administering a b3-adrenoceptor agonist. However, we
were unable to perform a cold challenge on GF mice because
of their special housing conditions. Not all experiments are
feasible for GF mice, which is a common drawback of their
use. Despite these limitations, our study still provides the clear
relation between gut microbiota and adaptive thermogenesis
and offers some important insights into future studies using
ABX and GF mouse models to further investigate the mecha-
nisms underpinning the gut-brain axis.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
7-8 week old male wild-type (Control) C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Vital River, Beijing. 11-12 week old male Germ free mice
(GF) and respective C57BL/6J Controls (SPF) were acquired from SLAC laboratory animal, Shanghai. All animal procedures were
approved by the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGDB-CAS) Institutional Review
Board Approval numbers for the various experiments are AP2016026, AP2016029, AP2016030, AP2016031 and AP2016032.
Mice were maintained under SPF facility in 12h:12h day and night cycles at 23 ± 1�C and fed standard chow diet (20% Protein,
70% Carbohydrate and 10% Fat, #D12450B, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Mice were provided with autoclaved drink-
ing water. Antibiotics were administered in the sterile drinking water ad libitum and changed every 3 days, ABX protocol containing
ampicillin (0.5 mg/mL, J&K), neomycin (0.5 mg/mL, J&K), gentamicin (0.5 mg/mL, J&K), metronidazole (0.5 mg/mL, J&K), vancomycin
(0.25 mg/mL, INALCO), and sucralose (4 mg/mL, Splenda, J&K) (Abt et al., 2012). ABX-SZ protocol containing neomycin
(100 mg/mL, Sigma), streptomycin (50 mg/mL, Sigma), penicillin (100 U/mL, Sigma), vancomycin (50 mg/mL, Sigma), metronidazole
(100 mg/mL, Sigma), bacitracin (1 mg/mL, Sigma), ciprofloxacin (125 mg/mL, Sigma), ceftazidime (100 mg/mL, Sigma) and gentamycin
(170 mg/mL, Sigma) (Sua
´ rez-Zamorano et al., 2015). [U13C] butyrate (488380, Sigma) and 12C butyrate (303410, Sigma) were
dissolved in PBS (160 mg/mL). Antibiotic treatment started in 8-9 weeks old animals for 3-4 weeks. For the thermoneutrality
experiments, mice were adapted to 30�C in a laboratory incubator (Jiangnan Instruments) for 3 weeks before manipulation. For
the cold challenge experiments, mice were fed ad libitum and individually housed in cages at 4�C. Tissues, feces contents and serum
were collected at the end of each experiment and quickly snapped in liquid nitrogen then stored in �80�C for further experiments.
For pair feed (PF) experiment, we measured the assimilation efficiency of Control mice and ABX mice every day. We assumed that
the digestive efficiency of PF mice is similar as Control mice, and PF mice were given quota food following the linear relationship
between ABX food intake and ABX body weight.

 METHOD DETAILS
Metabolic phenotype analysis
We used magnetic-resonance whole-body composition analyzer (EchoMRI, Houston, TX) to analyze mice body composition (fat
mass, lean mass and water content). We measured food intake and collected the feces every 24h. The feces were dried at 60�C
for 7 days then subjected to an oxygen bomb calorimeter (Parr, 1281, USA) to measure the calorie excretion of feces. We assessed
energy expenditure and physical activity by using indirect calorimetric system (TSE PhenoMaster, TSE Systems, Bad Homburg,
Germany). Daily energy expenditure (DEE) of GF and SPF mice were measured by the DLW (2H2
18O) technique (Nie et al., 2015).
To assess the effect of b3-adrenergic agonist CL-316243 on the energy expenditure, we treated mice daily for 3 consecutive
days through intraperitoneal administration of either vehicle (PBS) or CL-316243 (1 mg/kg). To assess the effect of IL-4 (50 mg/kg)
on energy expenditure, we treated mice daily for 5 consecutive days through intraperitoneal administration of either vehicle (PBS)
or IL-4. During the whole experimental manipulation, mice were housed in the metabolic chambers of TSE machine.
Quantitative PCR
Tissues were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen) by Bead Ruptor (OMNI). Total RNA was isolated using chloroform/isopropyl alcohol
and 3 mg total RNA was used as the template for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR
kit (TransGen Biotech) and quantitative PCR reaction was carried out in triplicate using 384 well PCR microplate for LightCycler 480 II
(Roche). The relative expression levels of each gene were normalized to housekeeping gene TATA-box binding protein (Tbp), the
specificity of amplified genes was verified by dissociation curves. RNA expression data were analyzed according to the -DDCt
method.
Western blotting
The whole adipose tissue pads were homogenized in tissue protein extraction reagent supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail and 10 mM PMSF and the lysates were chilled on ice for 30 min then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (10 min) to remove cell debris.
The supernatant was collected then the protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein quantification kit.
Equal amounts of protein were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto Immobilon-P PVDF membranes. After blocking
in 5% skim milk in PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 hour at room temperature, membranes were incubated with primary
antibody at 4�C overnight. To visualize the bands, HRP-labeled secondary antibodies and ECL blotting reagents (GE Healthcare)
were used. The bands were quantified with ImageJ 1.50i software. The primary antibodies used for western blot were UCP1
(#ab10983, diluted 1:3,000, Abcam), Total HSL (#4107, diluted 1:2,000, CST), Phospho-HSL (Ser660) (#4126, diluted 1: 2,000,
CST), b-actin (#AB1015T, diluted 1:5,000, AmeriBiophama).
Histology
10 mm paraffin slice of SPF and GF groups were incubated with xylene for 1min then step rehydration from gradient alcohol to PBS.
The slices were incubated with the hematoxylin for 2 min then stained eosin for 2min. The dehydrated slices were sealed by neutral
balsam.
Hormone measurements
The subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) was homogenized in tissue protein extraction reagent. Total protein was extracted and the
concentration was measured using BCA protein quantification kit. The content of cytokines and norepinephrine in local scWAT
were determined by ELISA kits. IL-4 was measured by mouse IL-4 ELISA kit (#431107, BioLegend). IL-5 and IL-33 were measured
by Platinum ELISA (#BMS610, #BMS6025, eBioscience). Norepinephrine was measured by 2-CAT (A-N) Research ELISA
(#BA-E5400, LDN). Circulating Leptin and Insulin were measured by Crystalchem INC and circulating NEFA was measured by
FFA Quantification Colorimetric/Fluorometric Kit (#K612, Biovision). Triglycerides (GPO-PAP method), total cholesterol (CHOD-
PAP method), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (direct method) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (direct method) in circu-
lating were analyzed on the auto clinical chemistry analyzer platform (ZY-330, KHB). Blank Control and quality Controls were added
in every measurement. All the processes were administrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
13C enrichment in breath samples
The technique we have developed for the measurement of butyrate homeostasis using [U13C] butyrate involves oral gavage. The
mice were fasted 8 hours before the experiment and transferred to a small chamber with a constant gas flow after the gavage treat-
ment. The flow is regulated such that the outflow CO2 is around 0.5%. This is 20x higher than the atmospheric CO2 hence incoming
CO2 has only a negligible impact on the measurements. The outflow stream is then sampled at 10-minute intervals by collecting gas
into a standard vacutainer for up to 200 minutes. The air samples were analyzed using an auto-sampler linked to a conventional gas
source isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Microgas uG). [U13C] butyrate in circulation entered cells and then is metabolized appearing
as 13CO2 in the breath. Hence by collecting breath and measuring the 13C:12C ratio in respiratory CO2 this provides an indication of
the rate of butyrate clearance from the body. This provides real time read out of the butyrate in a stress free and more detailed manner
than the standard test provides.

 Quantitative analysis of SCFA and TCA cycle metabolites
Mice were orally administrated [U13C] and 12C butyrate sodium (80mg, 1:10 ratio) and harvested tissue after 1-hour treatment. Sam-
ples were immediately frozen by dry ice before LC–MS analysis. SCFA and TCA cycle metabolite measurement and isotope tracing
were conducted via HPLC-MS/MS at LipidALL Technologies. In brief, SCFAs and TCA cycle metabolites were extracted from various
biological materials (serum, feces, cecum, colon and adipose) using solvent mixtures containing acetonitrile and water. The extract
was then derivatized with 3-nitrophenylhdyrazones and analyzed on a ThermoFisher DGLC-3000 coupled to Sciex QTRAP 6500 Plus
system. Individual metabolites were separated on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (100 3 2.1 mm, 2.6 mm) using 0.1% formic
acid in water as mobile phase A and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase B. The gradient started with 15% B which
increases linearly to 100% over 12 min, followed by a re-equlibration at 15% B over 3 min before the next injection. Octanoic
acid-1-13C1 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was used as an internal standard for quantitation, and molar responses of individual
SCFAs were corrected against that of octanoic acid for accurate quantitation Details of the analysis had been previously published
elsewhere (Han et al., 2013).
Serum metabolites
Serum metabolites were measured and analyzed by GC-TOF-MS at the Biotree corporation. We dried the serum extracts in a
vacuum concentrator without heating. Add 30 mL methoxyamination hydrochloride (20 mg/mL in pyridine), incubation for 30min
at 80�C. Add 40 mL of the BSTFA regent (1% TMCS, v/v) to the sample aliquots, incubated for 2h at 70�C. Add 10 mL FAMEs (Standard
mixture of fatty acid methyl esters, C8-C16: 1mg/mL; C18-C24: 0.5mg/mL in chloroform) to the QC sample it cooling to the room
temperature. GC-TOF-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph system coupled with a Pegasus HT
time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The system utilized a DB-5MS capillary column coated with 5% diphenyl cross-linked with
95% dimethylpolysiloxane (30 m 3 250 mm inner diameter, 0.25 mm film thickness; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). A 1 mL aliquot
of the analyte was injected in splitless mode. Helium was used as the carrier gas, the front inlet purge flow was 3mL min�1, and the
gas flow rate through the column was 1mL min�1. The initial temperature was kept at 50�C for 1 min, then raised to 300�C at a rate of
20�C min�1, then kept for 6.5min at 300�C.The injection, transfer line, and ion source temperatures were 280, 270, and 220�C,
respectively. The energy was �70eV in electron impact mode. The mass spectrometry data were acquired in full-scan mode with
the m/z range of 50–500 at a rate of 20 spectra per second after a solvent delay of 371 s. Chroma TOF 4.3X software of LECO
Corporation and LECO-Fiehn Rtx5 database were used for raw peaks exacting, the data baselines filtering and calibration of the
baseline, peak alignment, deconvolution analysis, peak identification and integration of the peak area (Kind et al., 2009). The RI
(retention time index) method was used in the peak identification, and the RI tolerance was 5000.
RNA-seq and Bioinformatics
Total RNA from fat tissue were extracted by the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s recommendations and
validated by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext� Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for
Illumina� (NEB, USA) and 150 bp paired-end reads were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq Xten platform in CapitalBio technology
corporation (Beijng). Full sequencing data are available online at NCBI GEO (GSE117843). The paired-end clean reads were aligned
to the reference genome (mm10) using STAR and each gene reads numbers were count by HTseq. Differential expression gene (DEG)
analysis was performed by DEseq2 package in which gene length and dispersion bias was corrected. The resulting P values
were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Genes with an adjusted
P value < 0.05 found by DESeq2 were assigned as differentially expressed.
16S rDNA qPCR and Amplicon Sequencing
Fecal pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after collection and stored at �80�C. Fecal nucleic acid was extracted from
fecal pellets using Fecal genomic extraction kit (DP-328, Tiangen technology corporation). SYBR green quantitative PCR for bacterial
16S rRNA genes was performed using primers 515F and 806R. Quantitation of 16S rRNA genes was performed by comparison to a
plasmid standard control of pUC57 containing a 16S rRNA sequence from an uncultured intestinal bacterium from mice (Thackray
et al., 2018). Barcoded PCR primers (341F and 805R) directed at the V3/V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were used to generate
libraries and libraries were validated by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Sequencing were performed with 250 bp paired-end reads on
Illumina Hiseq2500 platform in Annoroad Gene Technology (Beijng). The paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference
genome (SILVA_132) using QIIME2.
Flow cytometry
Primary stromal vascular fractions (SVF) from BAT, scWAT and pgVAT were prepared to FACS analysis. Details of the analysis had
been previously published elsewhere (Li et al., 2017). In brief, tissues were freshly collected, washed by pre-warm PBS at 37�C and
dissociated by scissors and then incubated with DMEM medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 3 mg/mL collagenase I (Sigma)
for 60 min at 37�C. The digested cell suspension was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min to separate stromal-vascular fraction from
adipocytes. The pelleted cells were incubated with 0.25% trypsin-EGTA for 3 min, then re-suspended in 5 mg/mL Dispase and
50 IU/mL DNaseI for 5 min, erythrocytes were removed by red blood cell lysis for 3 min before filtration through a 40-mm
cell mesh to remove large cellular debris. After cell suspension, cells were incubated in FACS buffer (PBS with 5% FBS and 1%

 Penicillin-Streptomycin) in the presence of staining antibody. The following primary antibodies were used: PE-cy7 conjugated anti-
CD45 (eBioscience, Clone 30-F11), Percp-cy5.5 conjugated anti-CD11b (eBioscience, Clone M1/70), FITC conjugated anti-F4/80
(BioLegend, Clone BM8), eFluor450 conjugated anti-CD11c (eBioscience, Clone N418), PE conjugated anti-CD206 (BioLegend,
Clone C068C2), Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated anti-SiglecF (BD PharMingen, Clone E50-2440), Fcg blocker anti-CD16/CD32
(eBioscience, Clone 93). The positive antibody signals were gated based on fluorescence minus one (FMO) Control every time.
Data was acquired on BD FACS Aria II and data analysis was performed using FlowJo v7.6.1 software.
Thermal conductance of pelage
The thermal conductance of pelage was measured as described in our previous study (Corp et al., 1997). In brief, the pelage was
removed by making a longitudinal ventral incision from the throat to the anus and then separating the pelage from the body cavity.
Pelages were stored at 4�C until assayed (1-3 days). We wrapped the pelage around a small bottle filled with water (20 mL) that con-
tained a temperature transmitter (iButton, DS2422, USA), and then attached it to the bottle with contact adhesive. An incubator was
used to heat the bottle of water to 40�C. After reaching 40�C, the bottle was immediately put into another incubator at 20�C, and then
the temperature, decreasing from 40 to 20�C, was monitored every 10 s. Each data point was transformed according to ln(x-20),
where x is the temperature monitored during the temperature decreasing course. The slope calculated for these transformed data
was defined as thermal conductance.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Replicate information is indicated in the figure legends. All results are given as mean ± SEM and analyzed by using statistical tools
