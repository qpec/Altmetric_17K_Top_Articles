Abstract
Background and objectives Relatively smaller kidney donor to recipient size is proposed to result in higher graft
loss due to nephron underdosing and hyperfiltration injury, but the potentially additive effect of sex and weight
mismatch has not been explored in detail. The purpose of this study was to determine if concurrent donor and
recipient absolute weight and sex mismatch was associated with graft loss in a cohort of deceased donor kidney
transplant recipients.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements The association of kidney donor and recipient absolute weight and
sex difference with death-censored graft loss was explored using a cohort of United States deceased donor
recipients between 2000 and 2014 through the Scientific Registry of Transplants Recipients. Donor-recipient sex
pairings (male donor–male recipient; female donor–female recipient; male donor–female recipient; female
donor–male recipient) were further stratified by donor and recipient absolute weight difference (.30 or 10–30 kg
[donor,recipient; donor.recipient] or ,10 kg [donor=recipient]) resulting in 20 weight and sex pairings. Time to
death-censored graft loss for each pairing was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models
adjustingfordonor,immunologic,surgical,andrecipientpredictorsofgraftlosscomparedwiththereferencegroupof
male donor–male recipients with no weight mismatch (,10 kg difference).
Results Of 115,124 kidney transplant recipients, 21,261 developed death-censored graft failure (median graft
survival time was 3.8 years; quartile 1 to 3, 0.0 to 14.8 years). After multivariable adjustment, the highest relative
hazards for graft failure were observed for female recipients of male donor kidneys and male recipients of female
donor kidneys in situations where the recipient was .30 kg larger than donor (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence
interval, 1.32 to 1.70; hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.45, respectively).
Conclusions A concurrent mismatch in donor-recipient weight (donor,recipient) and donor-recipient sex is
associated with a higher risk of death-censored graft loss in kidney transplantation.

Introduction
A number of donor and recipient factors have been
identified that increase the risk of both early and late
adverse outcomes after kidney transplantation. Most
literature has emphasized the importance of immu-
nologic mismatches (1,2), however, earlier studies
have also demonstrated that nonimmunologic factors
may influence graft and patient outcome (2–4). Hy-
perfiltration due to reduced renal mass or nephron
underdosing resulting from kidney size mismatch
between donor and recipient has been proposed as a
potential nonimmunologic contributor to chronic re-
nal graft nephropathy (2). Studies have demonstrated
that a smaller donor size relative to recipient is
associated with a higher risk of graft loss (5–7).
Contrarily, reduced hyperfiltration injury and thereby
reduced immune-mediated rejection and graft loss has
been demonstrated in recipients of kidneys from
relatively larger donors (8,9). A number of earlier
studies have explored the association between donor/
recipient size and the effect on outcomes using donor
kidney weight (6), as well as body mass index (8) or
body surface area (BSA) (7) as a surrogate for nephron
mass. Most studies suggest that increased donor
mass/size relative to recipient is protective against
chronic allograft nephropathy. Interestingly, very few
studies have investigated the outcomes associated with
donor-recipient weight mismatching as determined by
body mass in isolation.
Although findings are contradictory (10), sex mis-
match has also been associated with worse graft
outcomes after kidney transplant. Female kidneys
are generally smaller with fewer total nephrons
(11,12) and as a result, male recipients of female
kidneys appear to be at highest risk of graft loss in
unadjusted analyses; this finding is presumed to be
due to size mismatch and nephron underdosing
(11,13). In addition, female recipients of male kidneys
also appear to have reduced graft survival compared
with sex-matched donors and recipients, albeit to a
lesser extent than in male recipients of female kidneys
(14). This observation is proposed to be immunologic

 in nature. Mismatch between H-Y minor histocompatibility
antigens between sexes (derived from the Y chromosome in
male donors) is suspected to result in increased sensitiza-
tion and subsequent graft rejection and loss (13,14). The
potentially additive effect of size mismatch (with nephron
underdosing in donor,recipient [D,R]) and sex mismatch
(increased H-Y immunogenicity in male donor and female
recipient) has not previously been explored.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the
effect of absolute weight mismatch and sex mismatch on
kidney transplant graft survival after transplantation. We
hypothesized that the combination of a decreased donor-
to-recipient absolute weight and sex mismatch would be
associated with a higher risk of graft failure.
Materials and Methods
Design
We conducted a cohort study of all patients receiving a
solitary deceased kidney transplant in the United States,
identified using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
(SRTR), between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2013. We
excluded living donors, patients ,18 years of age, those
receiving multiple organs, en bloc or sequential transplants,
and patients without a documented donor or recipient weight.
Lastly, donors and recipients with body weights ,30 kg were
excluded, as these were assumed to be miscoded values.
Exposure
The primary exposure was combined donor-recipient
weight and sex mismatch. Sex pairing between donor and
recipient was categorized as female donor to male recipient
(FDMR), female donor to female recipient (FDFR), male
donor to female recipient (MDFR), and male donor to male
recipient (MDMR). Absolute weight difference was cate-
gorized as .30 kg, 10–30 kg (D,R; donor.recipient
[D.R]), or ,10 kg (donor=recipient [D=R]). Absolute
weight difference cut-points were chosen to distribute
the cohort into relatively even categories. Each donor-recipient
sex pairing was subcategorized by absolute weight difference
resulting in 20 possible weight and sex pairings.
Outcome
The outcome of interest was death-censored graft failure.
Graft failure was defined as need for chronic dialysis or
repeat pre-emptive transplantation. Censoring occurred at
losses to follow-up and at the date of last follow-up.
Data Collection
In addition to the primary exposure, known literature
predictors of graft loss including donor and recipient age,
donor and recipient height, race, donor cause of death, cold
ischemia time, recipient ESRD cause, dialysis vintage,
categories of human leukocyte antigen mismatch (0–6),
categories of panel reactive antibody (0–,20%, 20%–80%,
and .80%) (15,16), and medical comorbidities, were also
collected from the SRTR. Missing data were addressed with
multiple imputation using chained equations (17).
Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to report baseline char-
acteristics for all patients enrolled in the study. Means and

 SDs, and medians and interquartile ranges, were used for
continuous normal and continuous non-normally distrib-
uted variables. Baseline donor and recipient characteristics
were reported for all patients in each of the five weight
categories: 10–30 kg (D,R), .30 kg (D,R), 10–30 kg
(D.R), .30 kg (D.R), and the reference range of ,10 kg
absolute difference (D=R). The proportion of patients in each
sex match/mismatch category (stratified by weight mis-
match) was also reported.
The association between donor-recipient sex and weight
mismatch and graft failure was analyzed using a multivari-
able Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for known
predictors of graft failure highlighted above. The reference
group was chosen as MDMR with ,10 kg absolute weight
difference. Relative hazards and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs) were graphically displayed for each donor-
recipient sex/weight pairing compared with the reference
group. Proportionality was assessed using visual exami-
nation of 2ln (2ln[survival]) plots.
In secondary analyses, the unadjusted and adjusted associ-
ation between donor-recipient weight differences and graft loss
and donor-recipient sex pairing and graft loss was analyzed
using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.
In a sensitivity analysis, we re-examined the primary
exposure stratifying sex pairing instead by differences in
BSA, estimated using the Mosteller formula: BSA = square
root (height [centimeters] 3 weight [kilograms]/3600) (18).
Donor/recipient absolute BSA differences were catego-
rized as .0.03 m2 (D,R), 0.01–0.03 m2 (D,R), ,0.01 m2
(D=R), 0.01–0.03 m2 (D.R), and .0.03 m2 (D.R). Cut-
points for absolute BSA differences were also chosen to
distribute the cohort into evenly sized categories.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
version 13.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). Graphics
were created using R. For statistical comparisons, a P,0.05
was deemed the threshold for statistical significance. Institu-
tional ethics approval to conduct this study was given through
the Nova Scotia Health Authority research ethics board.

 Results
Baseline Characteristics
After exclusions, our final study cohort consisted of
115,124 individuals, with 367 donor/recipient pairs
dropped for missing recipient weight and 77 donor/
recipient pairs excluded for weights ,30 kg. No donors
were missing weight measurements. Baseline characteristics
are noted in Table 1. Median donor weight was 79.4 kg
(quartile 1 [Q1] to quartile 3 [Q3], 68.0–92.7 kg), and median
recipient weight was 79.8 kg (Q1 to Q3, 67.6–93.3 kg). The
absolute weight difference between donors and recipients
was normally distributed. Mean and median absolute
weight difference was 0.7627.1 kg, and 0.0 kg (Q1 to Q3,
217.1–17.6 kg), respectively. Of the donors, 59.4% were
men, whereas 61.6% of recipients were men.
Primary Analysis
Of the 115,124 individuals included in this analysis,
death-censored graft failure occurred in 21,261 patients
(18.5% overall). Median follow-up time was 3.8 years (Q1
to Q3, 0.0–14.8 years). The risk of graft failure for each
donor-recipient sex pairing was higher when the weight of
the recipient was greater than that of the donor. In
multivariable analysis, the risk of graft loss was highest
among recipients with .30 kg absolute weight difference
(D,R) who had concurrent sex mismatch (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.50; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.70, for MDFR; and HR, 1.35;
95% CI, 1.25 to 1.45, for FDMR), relative to MDMR with no
weight mismatch. These results are depicted in Figure 1.
Secondary Analysis
In a multivariable analysis of donor-recipient weight
mismatch, the adjusted relative hazard for a .30 kg
absolute weight difference (D,R) relative to no weight
mismatch was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.16 to 1.28; Table 2). In
unadjusted analysis, recipients of kidneys from female
donors were at the highest risk for graft failure (HR, 1.12;
95% CI, 1.08 to 1.16, for FDFR; and HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.18 to
1.27, for FDMR). However, after adjusting for donor,
surgical, immunologic, and recipient factors (including
donor/recipient weight), the adjusted relative hazard was
similar for all sex combinations relative to MDMR (HR’s of
1.08, 1.08, and 1.10 for FDFR, MDFR, and FDMR, re-
spectively, Table 2).
Sensitivity Analysis
The observed trend when BSA was used instead of
absolute weight difference for donor/recipient sex/weight
mismatch was similar to that seen for absolute weight
difference. Specifically, the highest risk of graft failure was
noted among recipients with the most extreme BSA dif-
ferences (.0.03 m2, D,R) who had concurrent sex mis-
match (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.66, for MDFR; and HR,
1.40; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.49, for FDMR; Figure 2), relative to
MDMR with no BSA mismatch (,0.01 m2).
Discussion
In this study we identified an association between the
combined exposure of donor-recipient weight/sex mis-
match and kidney graft loss. The highest risk of graft failure
was observed in the setting of a smaller donor weight
relative to recipient. Specifically, female recipients of male
kidneys (MDFR) with concurrent weight mismatch (.30
kg, D,R) were at the highest overall risk for graft loss. In
isolation, donor-recipient weight mismatch (D,R) and
specific donor/recipient sex pairings (MDFR, FDFR,
FDMR) were associated with a higher risk of graft failure.
Importantly, the risk of graft loss in isolated donor-recipient
weight or sex mismatch was much less pronounced than in
the setting of concurrent weight and sex mismatch.
Earlier studies, using different size metrics, have also
demonstrated a higher risk of kidney graft failure in the
setting of small kidney donors relative to recipients (8,19).
It is hypothesized that reduced renal mass in the donor results
in relative nephron underdosing with hyperfiltration of the

 remaining nephrons (2). This precipitates glomerular hyper-
tension and, over time, chronic allograft nephropathy and
potentially graft loss (20,21). Conversely, larger donor kidney
mass relative to recipient provides an increased number of
glomeruli with less metabolic demand on the transplanted
kidney and thus less hyperfiltration and subsequent related
injury over the long term (8,20). The theory of nephron
underdosing may also be partially responsible for the worse
graft outcomes observed in donor-recipient sex-mismatched
kidney transplantation (12). A number of studies have
demonstrated a reduction in graft survival in male recip-
ients of female kidneys (8,12,13). Female kidneys are
generally smaller with an average of 12%–17% fewer total
nephrons than male kidneys (11,12,22); this finding could
conceivably lead to nephron underdosing in an equally
weighted female donor and male recipient (11,13).
Reduced nephron mass may explain the higher risk of
graft failure we demonstrated for female donors regardless
of recipient sex in unadjusted sex analyses. Conversely,
MDFR has also been shown to have worse graft outcomes
than sex-matched controls, an observation which is pro-
posed to be immunologic in nature (13). Mismatch between
H and Y minor histocompatibility antigens (on the Y
chromosome in male donors) is suspected to result in
increased sensitization, allograft rejection, and subsequent
graft failure in this population (11,13,14,23). This may
account for the relative increase in graft failure for MDFR
after adjusting for factors including donor/recipient
weight. The potential synergistic increase in graft loss we
demonstrated in the setting of combined weight and sex
mismatch (particularly in MDFR) may be due to an added
immunologic strain imposed on a reduced number of
nephrons with exaggerated compensatory hyperfiltration
and subsequent injury (11,13,14,23).
Literature regarding the association between donor and
recipient size discrepancy and kidney transplant outcomes
has been conflicting (5–9,24,25). It is possible that this may
relate to variability in study design (short- versus long-term
outcomes) and exposure definitions. Although isolated kid-
ney mass is a validated predictor of nephron number (22),

 this involves measuring the organ at the time of retrieval in
the operating room, which is likely too late to inform
recipient selection processes. Additionally, donor-recipient
height and BSA comparisons have been studied in this
regard previously, however, these measures are also less
practical for point-of-care decisions at the time of organ
allocation. Interestingly, there are very few studies assess-
ing the association between donor and recipient weight
directly, which is a standardized measure and the easiest
parameter to determine for rapid bedside decision-making.
In addition, early physiology studies have demonstrated
that the process of glomerular hyperfiltration is driven by
body mass and the degree of expected hyperfiltration is
a product of the weight perfused by the kidney, with
increased weight resulting in increased metabolic demands
on the kidney (2). Although we focused on absolute
weight difference, a repeated analysis using combined
donor-recipient sex and BSA difference (instead of
weight difference) showed similar results with increased
graft loss with both sex mismatch (MDFR/FDMR) and
maximal BSA difference (D,R; Figure 2).
Our study is the first large-scale analysis to demonstrate
that worse kidney transplant outcomes associated with
donor and recipient weight mismatch (as determined by
absolute differences in body weight [D,R]), and donor
and recipient sex mismatch are additive. The hazard ratio
for this combined exposure of .30 kg weight mismatch
(D,R) and sex mismatch was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.32 to 1.70) in
MDFR and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.45) in FDMR. This higher
risk is comparable to other immunologic and nonimmu-
nologic risk factors for graft loss which historically influ-
ence organ allocation and were found to be associated
with a higher risk of graft failure in our cohort, including
donor diabetes (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.47 to 1.63), dialysis
vintage .4 years (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.59), and
expanded versus standard criteria donors (HR, 1.81; 95%
CI, 1.75 to 1.88). These results may eventually inform
recipient selection processes directly, or be incorporated
into decisions around donor and recipient matching. For
example, in the case of expanded criteria donors, studies
have shown that younger, healthier patients benefit from
waiting for a more ideal organ rather than accepting
expanded criteria donor organs that are predicted to
have a higher risk of graft loss (26,27). Conversely, given
the higher risk of death on the transplant weight list, older
patients can benefit from accepting the first available
kidney match, even if the organ is from an expanded
criteria donor (26,27). This may also be the case in the
setting of absolute weight mismatch between donor and
recipient especially if there is concurrent sex mismatch.
Any benefit derived from weight and sex matching would
have to offset the potential risk of longer wait times in
heavier recipients.
Our study was conducted using the SRTR, which is a large-
scale, nationally representative cohort of United States
kidney transplant recipients. This database has been used
in numerous earlier studies and is felt to be a robust record of
national transplant outcomes (28,29). However, there are
limitations to our study. Although this is a large population,
donor and recipient data (including weight) may have
been miscoded or misclassified. However, any errors in
weight coding would be expected to be distributed evenly
between weight difference categories and thus would be
unlikely to significantly bias results. Additionally, timing
of donor and recipient weight measures relative to kidney
transplantation was not documented, and thus the
weights included in this analysis were not necessarily
representative of the most current weight for donor or
recipient.
The combination of size and sex mismatch is a clinically
relevant exposure which is easily identifiable and appears
to have a significant effect on graft outcome. This study
provides some suggestion that these factors could be
collectively considered in organ allocation programs with
avoidance of the combination of large weight discrepancy
(D,R) and sex mismatch. Future studies should be tar-
geted at identifying the measure of size mismatch between
donor and recipient that has the highest predictive value
for post-transplant outcomes.
