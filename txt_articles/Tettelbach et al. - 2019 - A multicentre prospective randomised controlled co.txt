The aim of this study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of dehydrated
human umbilical cord allograft (EpiCord) compared with alginate wound dressings
for the treatment of chronic, non-healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). A multicentre,
randomised, controlled, clinical trial was conducted at 11 centres in the United
States. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes pre-
senting with a 1 to 15 cm2 ulcer located below the ankle that had been persisting
for at least 30 days were eligible for the 14-day study run-in phase. After 14 days
of weekly debridement, moist wound therapy, and off-loading, those with ≤30%
wound area reduction post-debridement (n = 155) were randomised in a 2:1 ratio
to receive a weekly application of EpiCord (n = 101) or standardised therapy with
alginate wound dressing, non-adherent silicone dressing, absorbent non-adhesive
hydropolymer secondary dressing, and gauze bandage roll (n = 54). All wounds
continued to have appropriate off-loading during the treatment phase of the study.
Study visits were conducted for 12 weeks. At each weekly visit, the DFU was
cleaned and debrided as necessary, with the wound photographed pre- and post-
debridement and measured before the application of treatment group-specific dress-
ings. A follow-up visit was performed at week 16. The primary study end point
was the percentage of complete closure of the study ulcer within 12 weeks, as
assessed by Silhouette camera. Data for randomised subjects meeting study inclu-
sion criteria were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Additional analysis
was conducted on a group of subjects (n = 134) who completed the study per pro-
tocol (PP) (EpiCord, n = 86, alginate, n = 48) and for those subjects receiving
adequate debridement (EpiCord, n = 67, alginate, n = 40). ITT analysis showed
that DFUs treated with EpiCord were more likely to heal within 12 weeks than
those receiving alginate dressings, 71 of 101 (70%) vs 26 of 54 (48%) for EpiCord
and alginate dressings, respectively, P = 0.0089. Healing rates at 12 weeks for sub-
jects treated PP were 70 of 86 (81%) for EpiCord-treated and 26 of 48 (54%) for
alginate-treated DFUs, P = 0.0013. For those DFUs that received adequate
debridement (n = 107, ITT population), 64 of 67 (96%) of the EpiCord-treated
ulcers healed completely within 12 weeks, compared with 26 of 40 (65%) of ade-
quately debrided alginate-treated ulcers, P < 0.0001. Seventy-five subjects experi-
enced at least one adverse event, with a total of 160 adverse events recorded. There
were no adverse events related to either EpiCord or alginate dressings. These
results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of EpiCord as a treatment for non-
healing DFUs.

INTRODUCTION
Diabetes affects 9.4% of the population in the United States
including approximately 23.1 million people with a known
diagnosis and 7.2 million people who are undiagnosed.1 The
estimated total cost of diagnosed diabetes in the United
States is on the rise, as evidenced by a 41% increase in costs
between 2007 and 2012, with 2012 costs estimated at
$245 billion.2 The development of diabetic foot ulcers
(DFUs) significantly influences costs related to managing a
patient with diabetes. One-quarter to one-third of total
annual expenses related to the care of people with diabetes is
linked to peripheral vascular and neurological complications
associated with DFUs.3 Up to 85% of lower-extremity ampu-
tations are preceded by a chronic DFU, and it is estimated
that 85% of these amputations may be preventable.4 Slow
healing of lower-extremity ulcers increases the risk of infec-
tion and potential for amputation. More than 80 000 amputa-
tions are performed each year on diabetic patients in the
United States.5
Advanced wound therapies are perceived to be costly but
have been shown to decrease long-term costs through the
reduction of foot complications and need for amputation.3,4
It is recognised that, given the high frequency and high costs
associated with treating DFUs, treatment strategies with the
ability to promote more rapid and complete healing are
warranted.6
The refractory nature of chronic DFUs is multifactorial.
Factors contributing to delayed healing include disrupted
signalling cascades that mediate cell recruitment and cross
talk between cells, persistently elevated metalloproteinases
(MMPs) levels, profound disturbances in bacteria-host rela-
tionship, hyperglycaemia, neuropathy, peripheral arterial dis-
ease, and impaired immune function. Foot ulcers persisting
for greater than 30 days are 4.7 times more likely to become
infected compared with acute foot ulcers.7 What makes this
increased risk of infection so impactful is that diabetics
whose ulcers become infected are 56 times at greater risk of
hospitalisation and 155 times more likely to undergo a
lower-extremity
amputation
than
diabetics
without
an
infected foot ulcer.7 Thus, expediting the closure of a
chronic DFU becomes a high priority to avoid these costly
complications.
The therapeutic and regenerative potential of allografts
comprised of Wharton's jelly found in the umbilical cord
(considered a foetal membrane) and amniotic fluid have
recently been recognised in the context of treating diseases
and injuries.8–11 The umbilical cord connects the developing
foetus and the placenta. In humans, the umbilical cord nor-
mally contains two arteries and one vein that carry essential
nourishment and oxygenated blood to and from the mother
and foetus. The outermost lining of the umbilical cord con-
sists of amniotic membrane, while glycosaminoglycan-rich
Wharton's jelly within the umbilical cord protects the arteries
and vein. Consisting of both amniotic epithelium and Whar-
ton's jelly, human umbilical cord contains an extracellular
matrix composed of collagen, proteoglycans, and hyaluronic
acid, which have been shown to provide a protective envi-
ronment for the healing process, and a connective tissue
matrix to replace or supplement damaged or deficient integu-
mental tissue.8 Immunogenicity of placental tissue12 lends
credence to its use as an allograft material for difficult-to-
heal wounds.
A dehydrated human umbilical cord allograft (EpiCord,
MiMedx Group, Inc., Marietta, Georgia) (Figure 1) is pro-
cessed through a patented PURION Plus process. The pur-
pose of the present study is to investigate the efficacy and
safety of using the EpiCord allograft to treat chronic DFUs.
Key Messages
• consisting of both amniotic epithelium and Wharton’s jelly,
the human umbilical cord contains an extracellular matrix
composed of collagen, proteoglycans, and hyaluronic acid,
which have been shown to provide a protective environment
for the healing process and a connective tissue matrix to
replace or supplement damaged or deficient integumental
tissue
• the current study evaluates the safety and efficacy of using a
dehydrated human umbilical cord allograft (EpiCord, MiMedx
Group, Inc., Marietta, Georgia) as a treatment for chronic dia-
betic foot ulcers
• both intent-to-treat and per-protocol participants receiving
weekly EpiCord were significantly more likely to completely
heal than those treated with standard alginate dressings (ITT:
70% vs 48%, P = 0.0089; per-protocol: 81% vs 54%,
P = 0.0013); illustrating the value of debridement, 96% of the
adequately debrided EpiCord-treated ulcers healed completely
within 12 weeks, compared with 65% of adequately debrided
alginate-treated ulcers, P < 0.0001, and no adverse events
related to EpiCord were identified

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We
conducted
an
Institutional
Review
Board
(IRB)-
approved prospective, randomised controlled trial (RCT) at
11 clinical centres in the United States between August,
2016 and March, 2018. The study was conducted under the
guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in accor-
dance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Tissue products used in the study were manufactured, han-
dled, and stored in accordance with applicable Good Tissue
Practices (GTPs). The study was reviewed and approved by
the Chesapeake IRB or a site's local IRB and was pre-
registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02844660). The pur-
pose of the study was to examine healing metrics of DFUs
treated with EpiCord while maintaining a moist wound bed
environment, compared with moist wound therapy with an
alginate wound dressing. The study period was 18 weeks,
consisting of a 2-week run-in phase, 12-week treatment
phase, and 4-week follow-up phase.
At each study site, potentially eligible subjects over the
age of 18 were contacted and encouraged to participate,
regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity. Eligibility was
assessed via inclusion and exclusion criteria. (Table 1) Inclu-
sion criteria included a documented history of Type 1 or
Type 2 diabetes, presence of a DFU of 1 to 15 cm2 (post-
debridement) located below the ankle with a duration of at
least 30 days, and adequate circulation to the affected
extremity. Subjects with an ulcer penetrating down to the
tendon, or bone, or the presence of another DFU within
3 cm of the study ulcer; active Charcot; wound infection; or
DFU present for over 1 year without intermittent healing
were ineligible for inclusion.
Eligible subjects were enrolled in a 14-day run-in period,
and the DFU was treated with moist dressings and offloaded
using an appropriate sponsor-approved device. Subjects
whose DFU area did not reduce by at least 30% from base-
line measurement during the run-in period provided IRB-
approved signed consent prior to randomisation.
Subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a
weekly application of EpiCord in addition to moist dressings
and offloading or to receive standard care with alginate
dressings and offloading. Randomisation to the study assign-
ment was generated via sealed envelope group assignment.
Envelopes containing the random group assignment were
sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed by the study
sponsor prior to being delivered to the study site. At the
point of entering a qualified subject into the study after sig-
nature was obtained acknowledging informed consent, site
staff opened the next envelope in the sequential order indi-
cating the study group assignment. Neither patient nor pro-
vider was blinded to group assignment.
All subjects were seen weekly at the study site. Dress-
ings were changed at a minimum of once per week or as
clinically
indicated.

 during scheduled visits by the investigational site staff. Per
study protocol, sharp debridement of unhealed wounds was
to be performed weekly or as deemed necessary by the site
investigator. In subjects randomised to receive EpiCord, the
EpiCord allograft was applied weekly, post-debridement, on
the wound bed and hydrated with sterile normal saline as
needed, followed by a non-adherent silicone dressing and a
non-adhesive absorbent hydropolymer secondary dressing,
and wrapped with an outer layer of gauze. The standard
care/alginate group had an alginate wound dressing applied
to the debrided wound bed (silver or collagen alginates were
prohibited);
then,
a
non-adherent
silicone
dressing
(ADAPTIC TOUCH Acelity, San Antonio, Texas) was
applied immediately above the alginate wound dressing, and
an absorbent non-adhesive hydropolymer secondary dress-
ing (TIELLE Max, Acelity, San Antonio, Texas) was
applied immediately above the ADAPTIC TOUCH layer.
An outer gauze wrap was applied above the TIELLE Max
layer.
All subjects were instructed on proper dressing care and
the importance of keeping the secondary dressings dry at all
times. Wounds were offloaded using a removable cast
walker, and when a removable walker was unsuitable and/or
not conducive to treatment, a standardised total contact cast
kit was used. The Active Offloading Walker (boot and/or
shoe) or a similar device was used by all subjects throughout
the screening/run-in and treatment phases of the study.
During the weekly visit, wounds were cleaned and deb-
rided as necessary and then photographed (pre- and post-
debridement)
and
measured.
The
Silhouette
camera
(ARANZ Medical, Christchurch, New Zealand), an imaging
device that precisely and consistently measures the area,
depth, and volume of wounds and their healing progress,
was used to obtain wound measurements at all study sites. In
order to insure consistency across study sites, all images
taken before and after debridement with the Silhouette cam-
era were examined at study completion by a group of three
wound care specialists who had not enrolled patients into the
study. These specialists were blinded to group assignment,
study sites, and the treating clinician. The image examina-
tion was performed as a group, and determination of timing
of complete epithelialisation was reached by consensus. The
group also made a judgement on whether the wound had
been adequately debrided during the study visit.

Statistical methods
The PASS 2013 statistical software was used to determine
the sample size needed to detect a difference of 30% between
the two treatment groups in the percentage of healed sub-
jects. Under the above assumption, 20 subjects for treatment
group 1 (alginate controls) and 40 subjects for treatment
group 2 (EpiCord) would be required to meet the Type I
error rate (P-value) of 0.05 with 80% power for a total of
60 subjects for the study, yet we chose to study over
100 subjects.
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomised sub-
jects) was used as the basis for the primary efficacy analysis.
All randomised subjects meeting study inclusion criteria
who received at least one application of EpiCord were used
for the analysis of safety data. Subjects who discontinued
the trial before their wound healed were categorised as treat-
ment failures for the primary efficacy analysis, and their last
observation was carried forward.
Continuous variables were summarised as means and
standard deviations (SDs); medians were also reported for
data with non-normal distribution. Categorical variables
were reported as proportions/percentages. Parametric and
non-parametric tests were used as appropriate. Student's t-
test or the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test for differ-
ences in continuous variables. For categorical variables,
Fisher’s exact tests were performed to test for statistical dif-
ferences. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed. Two-sided
P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. SAS 9.4 (SAS
institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) was used to perform
statistical testing.
The primary efficacy end point examined was the per-
centage of subjects in the ITT population, with complete clo-
sure of the study ulcer within 12 weeks of treatment
initiation. Twelve-week healing rates were also examined in
subjects completing the study per protocol and for only those
wounds determined to have received consistent, adequate
debridement.
Complete healing was defined as 100% epithelialisation
of the wound. Pre-debridement and post-debridement Sil-
houette wound images were evaluated by a team of wound
care specialists at study completion to determine if adequate
debridement had occurred. Adequate debridement was
defined as the exposure of healthy tissue in the ulcer bed,
with no significant eschar, callous, necrotic tissue, or foreign
material present in or around the wound.

RESULTS
Study subjects were enrolled at 11 study sites in the United
States between August 2016 and March 2018. Study sites
were located across the United States, and both hospital-
based and private clinic settings in urban and rural areas
were represented. As indicated in the CONSORT flow dia-
gram (Figure 2), a total of 202 subjects were screened and
met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for entry into the study
for the 2-week run-in period. At the conclusion of the run-in
period, there were 47 patients no longer eligible for study
inclusion because of >30% reduction in wound size
(n = 33), infection (n = 9), wound treated with other prod-
ucts not allowed per study protocol (n = 2), inaccurate base-
line wound measurement (n = 2), or withdrawal of consent
prior to randomization (n = 1). A total of 155 randomised

125
 subjects meeting study inclusion criteria were analysed per
ITT analysis; 101 subjects received EpiCord, and 54 subjects
received alginate dressings. Twenty-one subjects failed to
complete the study; 15 had been receiving EpiCord, and
6 had been receiving alginate dressings, yielding a per-
protocol EpiCord population of n = 86 and alginate popula-
tion of n = 48.
In the overall study population (n = 155), 81.3% were
male, 42.9% were smokers, 63.2% were obese, and 17.4%
had a prior amputation. Demographics of the study groups
are presented in Table 2. Characteristics of the study ulcers
are presented for each study group in Table 3. The two study
groups were well matched for demographic and clinical fac-
tors, as well as location, duration, and size of the study
ulcer.

 completely healed, a significantly greater number of healed
ulcers compared with 48% (26/54) in the alginate group
(P = 0.0089). For those subjects completing the study per
protocol, healing rates at 12 weeks were 81% (70/86) for
those in the EpiCord group and 54% (26/48) for those treated
with alginates (P = 0.0013).
Overall, 69% (107/155) of study ulcers were determined
to have received adequate debridement. Adequate debride-
ment occurred in 67 of 101 (66.3%) and 40 of 54 (74.1%) of
EpiCord
and
alginate-treated
ulcers,
respectively,
P = 0.3653. For those ulcers that received adequate debride-
ment (n = 107), 64 of 67 (96%) of the adequately debrided
and
EpiCord-treated
ulcers
healed
completely
within
12 weeks, compared with 26 of 40 (65%) of adequately deb-
rided and alginate-treated ulcers, P < 0.0001.
The median number of EpiCord allografts applied per
healed wound was 7 (range 2-12). Average cost per
EpiCord-healed ulcer was $3250.99 � $2898.48.

Follow up at 16 weeks
At the 16-week follow-up visit, in the ITT population, 74 of
101 (73%) of EpiCord-treated ulcers were healed, compared
with 29 of 54 (54%) of alginate-treated ulcers, P = 0.0199.
For subjects completing the study per protocol, 73 of
86 (85%) of EpiCord-treated ulcers were healed at 16-week
follow up, compared with 29 of 48 (60%) of ulcers treated
with alginate dressings.
Of the 71 healed ulcers treated with EpiCord during the
12-week treatment phase, 68 of 71 (96%) remained closed at
week 16 follow up, while 22 of the 26 ulcers healed with
alginate dressings (85%) had remained closed.

A Kaplan-Meier plot of time-to-heal within 12 weeks by
study group, demonstrated a superior wound-healing trajec-
tory for EpiCord-treated ulcers compared with ulcers treated
with alginate dressings. The log-rank test of equality of the
healing function over the two study groups produced a χ2
test statistic of 5.89, with a P = 0.0152 (Figure 4).

Adverse events/safety
All 155 subjects randomised were followed for evaluation of
safety. Any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or
disease occurring during study enrolment, even those not
necessarily having a causal relationship with study treat-
ment, were documented as adverse events. An adverse event
was classified as serious if it was determined to be life
threatening or resulted in hospitalisation, prolonged disabil-
ity, or death. An evaluation for adverse events was con-
ducted and documented at each study visit. All adverse
events were reviewed by site investigators and a Clinical
Events Committee, including the study sponsor, to determine
if the event was product or study related. Overall, 75 subjects
experienced at least one adverse event, with a total of
160 adverse events recorded. (Table 4) There were no
adverse
events
related
to
either
EpiCord
or

DISCUSSION
EpiCord is a minimally manipulated, dehydrated, devitalised
cellular umbilical cord allograft commercially available for
homologous use, created through a proprietary PURION
Plus process. The PURION Plus process results in an allo-
graft material that can be stored in ambient conditions for
5 years. The results of the present study show that DFUs
treated with the weekly application of EpiCord had signifi-
cantly greater rates of complete healing within 12 weeks of
treatment initiation than DFUs treated with alginate dress-
ings, which by today's benchmarks are frequently considered
part of the standard of care.
The umbilical cord consists of amniotic epithelium and
Wharton's jelly that contains an extracellular matrix com-
posed of collagen, fibroblasts, macrophages, proteoglycans,
and hyaluronic acid, providing a protective milieu for heal-
ing, and a connective tissue matrix to replace or supplement
damaged or deficient tissue. The ability to obtain mesenchy-
mal stem cells (MSC) from the matrix of fresh umbilical
cord tissue and use these cells in a variety of clinical applica-
tions has generated extensive interest in the development of
regenerative therapies based on umbilical cord tissue.11,13,14
Contemporary
advanced
wound-healing
modalities
are
designed to stimulate angiogenesis and accelerate wound
repair through regenerative mechanisms. A variety of stem
cells may play a role in wound repair, including MSC, adi-
pose stromal cells, and endothelial progenitor cells.15,16 Sol-
uble mediators generated by the wound-healing cascade
mobilise, recruit, and home these cells to sites of injury.
A recent study established that EpiCord possesses bio-
logical properties that stimulate cellular responses important
for soft tissue healing.17 Tissue composition, evaluation of
in vitro cellular response and in vivo bioresorption and tissue
response was performed in a rat model. It was observed that
EpiCord contains collagen I, hyaluronic acid, laminin, and
fibronectin. In addition, 461 regulatory proteins that consist
of growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory modulators, che-
mokines, proteases and inhibitors, adhesion molecules, sig-
nalling receptors, and other membrane-bound and soluble
proteins have been identified in PURION Plus-processed
EpiCord. Cell-based assays demonstrated an increase in
adipose-derived stem cell and MSC proliferation, fibroblast
migration, and endothelial progenitor cell vessel formation
in a dose-dependent manner after stimulation via EpiCord.
In addition, rat subcutaneous implantation demonstrated bio-
compatibility as EpiCord allografts were resorbed without
fibrous encapsulation.17
Although this is the first Level 1 RCT to examine the
efficacy and safety of an allograft derived from umbilical
cord as a treatment for chronic DFUs, our findings are not
completely novel. In 2016, a single-centre, retrospective case
series on the use of a cryopreserved umbilical cord allograft
as a treatment for chronic wounds of varying aetiology was
published.18 The report was not an ITT analysis and
excluded 23 patients, 29% of all patients treated, because of
significant non-compliance with instructions from the princi-
pal investigator, development of an infection resulting in
amputation,
and
patients
lost
to
follow
up.
Overall,
64 wounds were treated with the allograft, and 46 (71.9%)
healed within 12 weeks. Of the 37 DFUs included in the ret-
rospective case series, 29 (78.4%) healed after treatment with
the umbilical cord allograft, although the 12-week healing
rate specifically for DFUs was not reported.18 In the present
randomised controlled study, 86 DFUs were treated with
EpiCord in patients completing the study per protocol, the
group most comparable with those presented in the case
series. Patients treated with EpiCord in the per-protocol
cohort achieved a healing rate of 81% within 12 weeks.
Results of both studies are favourable for the application of
umbilical cord allografts as a treatment for chronic wounds.
In the ITT population, the 12-week healing rate of 70%
reported with EpiCord is comparable with the 12-week DFU
healing rate of 70% achieved with another placental tissue
product consisting of dehydrated human amnion/chorion
membrane (EpiFix, MiMedx Group Inc., Marietta, Geor-
gia).19 Although both products appear to produce similar
healing results, the EpiCord allografts are thicker and more
durable compared with the EpiFix allografts derived from
amnion and chorion membranes, which when dehydrated are
thinner and more brittle in texture until rehydrated into the
wound bed. This variation in handling characteristics
between the EpiCord and EpiFix products allows a clinician
to determine which allograft is most appropriate to use based
on wound type, depth, location, and presentation. A thicker
and more durable allograft such as EpiCord may be a good
choice for implantation into deeper wounds and in situations
where suturing the allograft in place is desired.
Evaluating the benefits of available advanced wound
care products compared with costs is a global challenge
faced by both clinicians and health care policymakers. To
justify the expense of advanced wound care products, they
must be shown to be more effective and heal more wounds
than less-expensive alternatives. The results of this large,
multicentre RCT provide additional Level 1 evidence
regarding the efficacy of EpiCord overall but also illustrate
the importance of wound preparation and debridement,
which is in the hands of clinicians. The role of the clinician

 to select and execute the appropriate procedures to enhance
rates of healing remains paramount to successful wound clo-
sure. Wound debridement has been reported to improve
healing and is considered a vital adjunct in the treatment of
DFUs.20,21 To obtain the highest level of treatment success
and ultimately reduce costs, advanced wound therapy must
be used as an adjunct to, and not in lieu of, good wound care
practices such as adequate debridement and off-loading.
Unfortunately, many wound care specialists have typically
never received hands-on standardised clinical training in sur-
gical wound debridement, and there is often a wide variance
in opinion among clinicians as to what constitutes adequate
debridement and the amount of tissue removed during sharp
debridement. In the current study, a blinded concurrent
review was conducted to apply consistent standards and
evaluate if wounds had been adequately debrided, with
exposure of healthy tissue in the ulcer, with no significant
eschar, callous, necrotic tissue, or foreign material present in
or around the wound. Treatment with EpiCord in addition to
adequate debridement resulted in a healing rate of 96%
within 12 weeks. Adequately debrided wounds treated with
alginate dressings had a healing rate of 65%, which, while
impressive, still remained significantly lower than treatment
with EpiCord, P < 0.0001. The appropriate use of strong
evidence-based products such as EpiCord, in the hands of a
skilled clinician, is likely to provide the most benefits for
patients and be among the most cost-effective forms of
health care expenditure.
The strength of the present study lies in its multicentre,
RCT design, which is the gold standard from the clinical
research paradigm. The RCT design, as well as the ITT anal-
ysis, allows for unbiased comparisons between study groups
but may also reduce the actual treatment effect size through
inclusion of drop-outs and crossovers in their original study
groups. The use of alginate dressings in the control group,
instead of simple wet-to-dry gauze dressings, may have also
reduced the treatment effect compared with EpiCord. A heal-
ing rate of 48% for wounds treated with alginate dressings in
the ITT population compared with expected healing rates of
approximately 24% reported with wet-to-dry dressings
20 years ago22 speaks to the overall advances being made in
treating chronic wounds with contemporary management.
Yet the results of the current study provide strong evidence
that, while healing rates may be improved when more
advanced dressings such as alginates are used, the clinicians
role in adequate wound bed preparation continues to exist.
Although the study groups were well matched for traditional
factors influencing healing, other circumstances, typically
problematic in the diabetic population, that we did not con-
trol for, such as nutrition, comorbidities, and polypharmacy,
may have also influenced healing rates in the current study
population.
DFUs are a major complication of patients with diabetes,
and represent a growing problem in the health care system,
imposing a substantial negative impact on individual's qual-
ity of life and increasing cost to the economy because of
working days lost and upward trending financial burden on
both public and private payers. The results of this first RCT
on the use of EpiCord as a treatment for DFUs provide addi-
tional evidence of the safety and efficacy of dehydrated pla-
cental tissues.
