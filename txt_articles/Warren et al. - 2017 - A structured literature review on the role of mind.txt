Abstract
The role of mindfulness, mindful eating and a newer concept of intuitive eating in modulating eating habits is an area of increasing interest.
In this structured literature review, a summary of the current evidence is presented, together with details of interventions undertaken and the
tools to measure outcomes. It is broad in scope given the emerging evidence base in this area. The review yielded sixty-eight publications:
twenty-three interventions in obese/overweight populations; twenty-nine interventions in normal-weight populations; sixteen observational
studies, three of which were carried out in overweight/obese populations. Mindfulness-based approaches appear most effective in addressing
binge eating, emotional eating and eating in response to external cues. There is a lack of compelling evidence for the effectiveness of
mindfulness and mindful eating in weight management. Mindfulness-based approaches may prevent weight gain. Reduced food intake was
seen in some of the studies in overweight and obese populations, but this was less apparent in the studies in normal-weight populations.
The evidence base for intuitive eating is limited to date and further research is needed to examine its potential in altering eating behaviours.
Mindfulness appears to work by an increased awareness of internal, rather than external, cues to eat. Mindfulness and mindful eating have the
potential to address problematic eating behaviours and the challenges many face with controlling their food intake. Encouraging a mindful
eating approach would seem to be a positive message to be included in general weight management advice to the public.
Key words: Mindful eating: Intuitive eating: Binge eating: Emotional eating: External eating: Obese: Overweight
Introduction
Excessive body weight is one of the most challenging public
health issues of our time(1). Our relationship with food is impor-
tant; a recent UK report on securing a positive ‘Food Future’
indicated that consumers feel a loss of connection with food that
should be preserved(2). Problematic food and eating behaviours,
for example binge and emotional eating, have been characterised
in obesity. In mindfulness, an individual observes their immediate
experience using an open and non-judgemental stance(3). One of
the modern-day pioneers of mindfulness is Jon Kabat Zinn who
developed the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) pro-
gramme which is used in mainstream medicine internationally,
particularly in the management of depression(4). Recent reviews
have examined the evidence for mindfulness in the management
of pain(5,6), depression(7,8) and psychological well-being(9,10).
In relation to eating behaviours, research began into the use
of mindfulness in binge eating with early interventions in the
late 1990s when Kristeller & Hallet(11) undertook a pilot study
among
obese
women
with
binge
eating
disorder
using
Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training (MB-EAT). This
intervention was later developed for obese populations with or
without binge eating disorder(12). In recent years there has been
increased interest in using mindfulness and mindful eating in
obese/overweight and normal-weight populations.
Mindful eating consists of making conscious food choices,
developing an awareness of physical v. psychological hunger
and satiety cues(13), and eating healthfully in response to those
cues(14). It is conceptualised as being aware of the present
moment when one is eating(15), paying close attention to the
effect of the food on the senses, and noting the physical and
emotional sensations in response to eating(16). There is no
universal definition of mindful eating but these principles are
consistent in the literature.
Intuitive eating is a discreet, but complementary term, often
used interchangeably with mindful eating. Intuitive eating was
originally defined by two US Registered Dietitians in 1995(17)
who
described
ten
aspects
of
intuitive
eating

 a rejection of ‘diets’, a discouragement of labelling foods as
‘bad’, an encouragement to honour hunger, and allow satis-
faction with food intake. Both mindful eating and intuitive
eating concentrate on internally focused eating(18); intuitive
eating, however, does not involve meditation(17).
A number of recent systematic reviews have been published
looking at the effectiveness of mindful eating(19), and mind-
fulness interventions(20) in binge eating, and mindfulness-based
interventions for eating disorders and obesity and obesity-
related behaviours(21–23). The three reviews that looked at binge
eating showed a positive effect of mindfulness in reducing
this maladaptive eating behaviour; the effect sizes were
moderate(20). Furthermore, there was evidence of its efficacy in
emotional(20,23) and external(23) eating. The role of mindfulness
in weight management was less apparent(20,21). The high level
of
heterogeneity
between
studies(20)
and
methodological
weakness of many studies(22) were highlighted.
Mindfulness is a key component of interventions based on
dialectical behaviour therapy and Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT), which are both third-wave therapies to promote
awareness, acceptance and distress tolerance(19).
The aim of this paper is to present the results of a structured
literature review looking at the outcomes of mindfulness,
including mindful eating and intuitive eating, in changing eating
behaviours (including binge eating, emotional eating and eating
in response to cues) in healthy populations of any age and
weight status. As this is an emerging area of science, the review
includes both observational and intervention studies to provide
an indication of the direction of future research. The review
provides details of the tools used to measure outcomes and the
interventions themselves including their theoretical basis. The
review also includes a brief summary of potential associated
mechanisms that may explain the observed results.
Methodology
The structured review was carried out combining the following
search terms and within the three parameters: population,
intervention and outcomes. Search terms were combined with
‘or’ within parameters, and combined with ‘and’ across para-
meters. Only peer-reviewed interventions and observational
studies were included.
Population
Search terms were: healthy population or adult or child or
obese or overweight or binge eating or problematic eating or
disordered eating or diabetes or diabetic.
Intervention
Search terms were: mindful eating or mindfulness or mind-
fulness based intervention or meditation or mindfulness based
cognitive behaviour therapy or mindfulness based stress
reduction or acceptance based practices or mindful body scan
or intuitive eating.
These search terms were also searched in combination with
cognitive behaviour/behavior therapy or acceptance and com-
mitment therapy or weight intervention or weight program.
Outcomes
Search terms were: weight or weight related eating behaviour/
behavior or overeating or eating behaviour/behavior or eating
pattern or dietary behaviour/behavior or dietary pattern or
snacking behaviour/behavior or diet quality or energy intake or
energy balance or meal frequency or external eating or self-
regulation or intuitive eating or mindless eating or mindful
eating or distracted eating or appetite awareness or hunger
recognition or emotional eating or self-efficacy for eating
behaviour/behavior or self-efficacy for healthy eating or self-
confidence or wellness or well-being or quality of life.
Databases
The search was conducted using a University search engine
which searched multiple databases: AMED (Alternative MEDi-
cine), ASSIA (Applied Social Sciences Index), BioMed central,
BMJ open, British Nursing Index, CINAHL (Nursing and Allied
Health), Clinical Evidence, Cochrane Library, Conference Pro-
ceedings Citations Index, Ebsco, Medline, NICE, PsycARTICLES,
PsycINFO, PubMed, Sage Journals Online and Science Direct.
Inclusion criteria
Included were papers consistent with the search strategy out-
lined above in the databases listed, and English articles pub-
lished until August 2015.
Exclusion criterion
Excluded were non-English-language papers.
Coding and scoring of results
For both the intervention and observational studies, results
were ‘coded’ and summarised as follows. A ‘positive’ code
indicated the outcome demonstrated a beneficial effect of
mindfulness (for example, decreased binge eating, weight loss,
and reduced energy intake). A ‘neutral’ code indicated that
there was no significant effect from the intervention. A mixed
code indicated that there were some positive and neutral
results. ‘Negative’ codes indicated that the measured outcome
was in an opposite direction to the hypothesis.
Outcomes that were measured in three or more studies were
ascribed a percentage score calculated by giving all positive
codes one point, negative results were given minus one point,
and neutral or mixed codes were given no score. The points
were added per outcome, divided by the total number of
outcomes and expressed as a percentage.
We acknowledge that this is not a conventional way of
summarising the results of the studies and does not account for
effect size. However, it provides an overview of findings in the
wide range of papers included in the review, and gives an
indication of whether or not there is consistency in the
literature.
Search strategy results
The results of the structured literature review are shown in
Fig. 1 and resulted in sixty-eight papers.

 Results – intervention studies
The search yielded twenty-three studies (twenty-four papers) in
overweight/obese subjects(11,13,14,16,24–43) and twenty-nine papers
describing interventions in normal-weight subjects(15,18,34,44–61).
Characteristics of the intervention studies
The majority of interventions have taken place in the last 5 years.
Most of the interventions in obese/overweight populations were
undertaken in female populations, while studies of normal-
weight populations included more men. Many of the interven-
tions had small sample sizes of fifty or fewer subjects: fourteen of
the overweight/obese studies(11,13,24,25,27–29,31–33,37,41,43), and ten
of the studies in normal-weight populations(45,47–49,51,54,58–61).
Three of the studies in the overweight/obese populations were
carried out among children(28,29,40); one of these studies had a
sample size of more than 300 but the results of this study
were not clearly described(40). The majority of the studies(15)
among
normal-weight
populations
were
performed
with
students(15,18,34,46–48,50–53).
Theoretical basis of the interventions in overweight and
obese subjects
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy/mindfulness action-based
cognitive therapy, and mindful eating were the most commonly
used approaches and were both used in four studies. Table 1
outlines the details of the theoretical basis of these studies.
Theoretical basis of the interventions in normal-weight
populations
Mindfulness was the most frequently cited basis in the studies
among normal-weight subjects and was reported in eight
papers which contained thirteen studies(34,46,51,53,56–59). Three
papers
used
mindful
eating(15,48,50)
and
two
intuitive
eating(18,47). One paper which contained three studies used
emotional awareness(55). Cognitive defusion(52) and ACT were
each used in one paper(49).
Intervention length, intensity and scope
The majority of interventions (n 18) in the overweight/obese
populations consisted of sustained weight-management pro-
grammes of medium to high intensity carried out for a medium
length of time, i.e. 6 weeks to 4 months. Two studies lasted
longer than 4 months and two were for a shorter duration with
one study not detailing its intervention length. In many of these
studies mindfulness was the sole focus of the intervention
which often included mindful eating as a key element of the
programme. An example of a mindfulness intervention is the
one developed by Alberts et al. in 2012, a programme with five
core components(25):
(1) Mindful eating;
(2) Awareness of physical sensations;
(3) Awareness of thoughts and feelings related to eating;
(4) Acceptance and non-judgement of sensations, thoughts,
feelings, and body;
(5) Awareness and step-by-step change of daily patterns and
eating habits.
In contrast, many of the interventions in normal-weight
populations were single-day laboratory-based studies such as
completion of food tasks, rating of pleasure in food or observed
food intake after a test meal. Studies often looked only at a
specific practice of mindfulness such as the body scan, or
mindful eating of a raisin and were therefore lower-intensity
interventions than those in obese/overweight individuals.
Summary of the tools/methods used to measure outcomes
in intervention studies
The following two tools were the most frequently used to
measure individuals’ mindfulness state and awareness:
(1) The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire contained thirty-
nine items(27) It: (a) measures trait (rather than state)
mindfulness across five subscales (observing, describing,
acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience
and non-reactivity to inner experience); and (b) reports
internal consistency of 0·87 (as measured by Cronbach’s α).
(2) The Mindfulness Awareness Attention Scale contained
fifteen items(62). It: (a) measures trait or dispositional levels

 of mindfulness; (b) measures each item on a six-point
Likert scale and measures levels of day-to-day awareness,
attention and observation; (c) reports reliability of 0·82
(as measured by Cronbach’s α).
The Mindful Eating Questionnaire contained twenty-eight
items(63) and was the only tool used to measure mindful eating.
It: (a) assesses five domains of mindful eating (disinhibition,
awareness, external cues, emotional response and distraction)
on a four-point Likert scale; and (b) reports reliability of 0·7–0·9
(as measured by Cronbach’s α).
Intuitive eating, when measured, was evaluated using the
Intuitive Eating Scale(64) which contains twenty-one items. It:
(a) assesses each item on a five-point Likert scale; (b) measures
readiness to eat in response to internal cues to determine choice
and quantity of food; eating to satisfy physical rather than
emotional reasons; awareness and trust of internal cues; and
(c) reports internal consistency of >0·70 (as measured by
Cronbach’s α) and test–retest reliability of 0·90 (as measured by
Cronbach’s α).
Tools used to measure eating-related behaviours
Eating behaviours were most frequently assessed using the
Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire(65), the Eating Attitudes
Test(66) and the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire(67).
The studies reviewed used thirty-two measures of eating
behaviour assessing a broad range of eating behaviours, atti-
tudes, cognitions about food and related issues. Some of these
were previously validated tools, others adapted, and others
developed specifically for a study.
Tools used to measure issues related to food consumption
and hunger
The majority of self-report measures involved 24 h recalls which
were translated into energy intakes by the investigator. The
studies applying objective measures involved the investigator
weighing the amount of food consumed, usually within a
controlled laboratory environment. The assessment of hunger
was always via self-report rating scale, either on an analogue or
Likert scale. There were eleven measures of the quantity of food
consumed via self-report and objectively weighed.
Summary of results from intervention studies
The results of the intervention studies are presented with results
in overweight/obese populations being detailed before those in
normal-weight populations. Most intervention effect was seen
in binge eating, emotional eating and external eating and more
emphasis is given to these interventions, alongside the weight-
management interventions in overweight/obese populations.
Overall, the studies in overweight/obese populations were
relatively longer and more intense compared with those carried
out in normal-weight populations. Many of the observational
studies were short, day-long laboratory experiments, and these
are briefly summarised after the intervention studies.
A summary of the results from the intervention studies is
presented in Table 2. In five of the papers in normal-weight
populations, multiple related studies were reported in a single
paper and the results have been collated in Table 2(34,53,55,58,59).
Ten outcomes were given a percentage score as described
previously. In studies that measured weight, binge eating,
emotional eating, food intake (in overweight and obese popula-
tions) and food choice (in normal-weight populations) the score
was 50 % or above, indicating that most of the results were
positive or neutral/mixed. Only two studies had negative results
related to weight gain(54) and an increase of energy intake(18).
Results of physiological health outcomes
Outcomes of weight management interventions. Weight loss
was seen in eight(13,16,28,30,31,37,40,43) of the sixteen studies in
overweight/obese population studies. However, the effect sizes
varied widely with only three studies reporting significant
weight loss(13,16,37); the latter of these reported a mean weight
loss of 12 (SE 4) kg over 6 months. In two studies the weight loss
was minimal(28,30), and in two studies weight was stabilised or
weight gain was less in the intervention group(31,43). In one
study results were not reported(40).
The duration of the eight studies in overweight/obese
populations that resulted in weight loss varied from 6 to
24 weeks and sample sizes varied from ten(13) to 300(40).
Weight-loss interventions. Of the eight studies that reported
weight loss in overweight/obese populations, five of them were
comprehensive
mindfulness
programmes(13,16,30,31,40)
where
mindful eating was a component of the programme, although
details of the intervention were not reported in one of these
studies(40). The rest of these programmes taught the core elements
of mindfulness such as being present in the moment and
self-acceptance of the current state. The study with the greatest
weight loss held group sessions for 24 weeks based on an
acceptance-based behavioural intervention for weight loss; this
was a pilot study, which taught key components of this approach
including values, acceptance and cognitive defusion using
mindfulness(37).
Mindful eating in a restaurant setting was the sole focus of one
of the eight studies(43); the other two studies focused on the reg-
ulation of cues(28) and used an ACT approach where mindfulness
was a core component(37).
There was some variation between interventions but the fol-
lowing were key elements of the mindful eating components:
(1) Mindful eating was taught by a specific exercise such as the
‘mindful raisin’ exercise;
(2) Mindfully attending to the eating experience by noticing
smell, texture and taste of the food;
(3) Reducing the speed of eating;
(4) Guided meditations that focused on awareness of hunger
and satiety;
(5) Mediations to identify eating triggers including emotional
triggers;
(6) Mediations to manage cravings.
An example of how these elements were delivered in a
mindfulness intervention is given in Table 3 from a nine-session
MB-EAT programme for binge eating(16).

 The studies that did not report weight loss or where there was
no intervention effect on weight were more variable in terms of
duration and intensity than the studies above. A couple of the
studies had a mindfulness component as part of an education
programme, with an ACT(42) and MB-EAT(36) basis and were
similar to the studies where weight loss was observed. Other
studies had a narrower focus, for example internal cues(26),
mindful eating(29) and mindful breathing(41), and tended to have
shorter duration of 4–8 weeks.
Weight loss in normal-weight populations. In two of
the three normal population studies that measured weight(34,55),
weight loss was observed although effect sizes were small;
these were short-term experimental studies. In one study

Other objective physiological measures. Three studies mea-
sured other objective physiological measures – with both
improvement and mixed results reported for cardiovascular risk
factors in overweight/obese populations(13,26), and improvement
in glycaemic control in diabetics(14,36). This suggests that mind-
fulness interventions can create changes in physiological mar-
kers, most likely because of mindfulness-induced changes to
eating habits rather than mindfulness per se having a direct effect
on the physiological marker. This is an area of limited research.
Eating behaviours and food-related outcomes
A range of eating behaviours that may be associated with
weight status was measured across the intervention studies
including binge eating, emotional eating, external eating and
cravings. Food intake and choices were also measured in some
studies. A number of the studies showed that mindfulness
enabled participants to become more aware of their internal
states of hunger and satiety alongside the recognition of specific
cues. Other studies showed that mindfulness generated more
overall internal awareness, for example thoughts and feelings
(which could include satiety and hunger). More generic mind-
fulness techniques emerged strongly in the studies. These
included the body scan exercise and mindful breathing
exercises. Acceptance-based exercises were used in a number
of studies connected to recognition of emotions and thoughts.
Eating-related behaviours
Binge eating. Binge eating symptoms were measured in nine
studies in overweight/obese populations. All the studies reported
positive changes in binge eating symptoms over the course of the
study, as evidenced by self-report measures. In four of the studies
binge eating was a specific target of the intervention(11,16,33,39).
The first of these studies was the initial exploratory work with
mindfulness and any eating-related behaviour(11).
Binge eating symptoms were assessed in four studies in
normal-weight populations(45,49,60,61); three were undertaken
in binge-eating-disorder populations. Positive results were seen in
all studies.
Collectively, these results suggest strong evidence for the effi-
cacy of mindfulness in reducing the frequency and intensity of
binge eating symptoms. This is particularly notable given the high
degree of heterogeneity between the studies in terms of design
and intervention.
Binge eating interventions. Specific mindful eating strategies
were included in the majority of studies that measured binge
eating. In many cases, this was complemented with generic
mindfulness meditations such as breathing techniques and body
scans often as part of a mindfulness-based curriculum, for
example, MB-EAT(16), MBSR(39,60) or mindfulness-based cognitive
therapy(27,33). Mindfulness was also sometimes combined with
ACT(42,49) or action-based cognitive therapy(45). Awareness of
internal hunger cues was not as prevalent in these studies. These
findings suggest that in the management of binge eating, the
ability to eat mindfully is a key technique.
Emotional eating. Ten studies measured emotional eating in
overweight/obese populations. Reductions in emotional eating
were reported in seven of these studies(11,25,30,31,33,35,39) and
three studies showed no change(29,42,43). One of the studies
where there was no effect was undertaken among children(29),
another was focused on restaurant eating only(43), and the third
was an ACT-based intervention where mindfulness was not the
sole focus(42). These positive results provide support for the use
of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing emotional
eating in overweight or obese populations.
Only one study measured emotional eating in a normal-weight
population(54) where no impact of the MBSR intervention was
seen; this population of veterans with chronic conditions may
not be generalisable.
External eating. External eating was measured in five of the
studies within an overweight/obese population. Four of these
studies showed a positive change in external eating and were
undertaken in populations suffering from stress eating, pro-
blematic eating, disordered eating attitudes, and children
learning specifically about cues(25,28,31,38). One study, in this
population reported a neutral result(42). This was an ACT
intervention study over 6 months among women. External
eating was measured in one study in a normal-weight popula-
tion suffering from binge eating and the intervention reduced
binge eating episodes.
Taken together, these findings suggest that mindfulness can
be helpful in reducing external eating and reduce the respon-
siveness of individuals to external cues such as food packaging
and time of day. The evidence in normal-weight populations
appears to be limited.
External eating and emotional eating interventions. All
studies that looked at external and emotional eating used
specific mindful eating techniques in their interventions.
Mindfulness techniques such as body scans, breathing exercises
and awareness of bodily sensation were utilised in the studies to
a varying extent. In the studies done in overweight and obese
populations
the
mindful
practice
was
part
of
a
wider
curriculum(11,25,30,31), or sometimes supported by a one-day
workshop(38). This suggests that in order to effect change in
external and emotional eating, it is important to use techniques
that increase awareness of internal states, combined with
acceptance techniques. Combining these with mindful eating
seems to be important.
Cravings. Cravings were measured in one study in an over-
weight/obese population(24), which showed a positive response
to a mindfulness-based intervention, and in three studies in
normal-weight populations, all of which showed mixed/neutral
results(46,56,58). These studies were all laboratory-based studies
and two of them were day-long studies only. Given the limited

 number of studies and their short duration, the role of mind-
fulness in reducing cravings remains to be fully elucidated.
Hunger awareness. Hunger awareness was measured in two
overweight/obese
populations
and
positive
results
were
reported in both studies(11,28). In one of these studies a 12-week
curriculum was developed which focused on ‘Regulation of
Cues’; children in this group had significant reductions in eating
in response to external cues and negative states, and attending
to food responsiveness(28). A study in normal-weight students
which made one focus group concentrate on the sensory
experience of foods showed a lower pre-snack hunger rating
than either of the control groups(48). These results suggest that
mindfulness is effective in increasing hunger awareness,
although this was only measured in three studies, so the finding
should be considered preliminary.
Body dissatisfaction. Two studies measured body dissatisfac-
tion in relation to mindfulness interventions in overweight/
obese populations(38,39). Both of these studies demonstrated
positive results, but this is a limited evidence base from which
to suggest that mindfulness can support improvements in body
dissatisfaction.
Food intake and choice
Food intake was measured in four studies in overweight/obese
populations and three of these reported a reduced energy
intake,
as
measured
by
self-report
via
24 h
recalls
or
FFQ(28,36,43). The first two of these studies were comprehensive
education programmes while the third focused on intake at
lunchtime only. One study did not find a reduction in energy
intake as a result of their intervention among children and their
parents(29).
Food intake was measured in nine studies in normal-weight
populations, with four studies reporting a reduction of food
intake(48,52,53,55), four reporting neutral results(44,51,54,57) and
one reporting negative results(18). One of these studies reported
that higher levels of intuitive eating was associated with
increased food intake in a permissive environment which was
an unexpected finding(18). No change in food intake was seen
in a study among veterans with chronic health problems(54). In
contrast to the studies in overweight/obese populations, in all
but one study(54), food intake was measured in short-duration,
low-intensity experiments in laboratory settings using test meals
or snacks rather than in a free-living situation.
These results suggest that more evidence is needed before it
is possible to say if mindfulness and/or mindful eating can
reduce the quantity of food consumed.
Food choice was measured in one study in overweight/obese
populations which looked at lunches purchased and showed
positive trend in choosing healthier meals(41). Food was
measured in five studies in normal-weight populations. Three
of these studies reported positive food choices(15,53,55) as a
result of mindfulness intervention and two studies reported
mixed/neutral results(50,59). As per food intake, these were low-
intensity, laboratory studies asking participants to make a snack
choice, with the healthier choice being determined as positive.
Results – observational studies
Theoretical basis
Eight papers focused on intuitive eating(18,68–75), five papers
focused on mindfulness(76–80), two papers focused on mindful
eating(81,82) and one paper had a combined mindfulness and
mindful eating approach(83).
Summary of results from observational studies
Sixteen observational studies were identified in the literature
search and a summary of the associations observed are shown in
the Table 4; it should be noted that some studies investigated
more than one association. Many of the observational studies
looked at associations between an aspect of eating or mind-
fulness and related it to an outcome in an existing cohort, for
example level of mindfulness, or intuitive eating and BMI.
Associations were made using the tools and scales already out-
lined in the intervention studies.
Two of the cohorts were substantial, with 1000(72) and 2000(69)
subjects, respectively. The cohort populations were diverse, with
six undertaken among university students(69–71,73,80,82) and two
taken among other young adult populations(68,71). The remaining
cohorts were spread across a wide age spectrum from middle
school(72) to older obese adults(78). Four of the cohorts were
from overweight/obese populations of which two were waiting
for bariatric surgery(76,77).
Intuitive eating was associated with a lower BMI in four
studies(68,70,74,75). Other observations included a decreased
emotional eating with higher levels of mindfulness(76,77,79) and
a higher level of everyday mindfulness was related negatively
to self-report serve size of energy-dense food(83). In one of

 the large cohorts in young adults, there was no difference
in intuitive eating by age or sex(68) while another study
which compared males and females in a young adult pop-
ulation found
higher levels of
anti-dieting and
self-care
subscales of the intuitive eating scale(69). One study found
males trusting their bodies more than females on when to
eat(68) but this was reversed in a second study(72). Another
study looking at associations with intuitive eating showed
that those who consistently overrode fullness feelings were
more likely to use moderate to extreme effort to maintain their
weight(73).
Interoceptive
sensitivity
is
a
measure
of
awareness
of the subject’s bodily state; this was positively related to higher
levels of intuitive eating(71). An online survey in Pakistan
showed
a
significantly
positive
relationship
between
overall mindful eating and mental well-being(81). In one of the
group of bariatric patients, greater mindfulness, particularly
awareness,
was
related
to
fewer
binges
and
emotional
eating(76). Another observation in bariatric patients showed that
mindfulness was positively associated with restrained eating
behaviour(77).
These studies indicate that both mindfulness and intuitive
eating showed promise in positively influencing complex
relationships with food and eating behaviours.
Potential associated mechanisms
The literature search showed a growing evidence base for
mindfulness, mindful eating and intuitive eating, but the papers
retrieved generally did not discuss underlying mechanisms.
Therefore, a further search of the scientific literature was
undertaken to provide potential explanations for the observed
effects. We identified three separate hypothesised mechanisms
that were suggested by functional MRI (fMRI) results; fMRI
measures brain activity by detecting associated changes in
blood flow.
Increased awareness of, and increased responsiveness to,
internal physical cues
Interoception can be measured by an individual’s ability to
report their heart rate. Interoception is connected with the
mindful awareness of an individual’s internal state, especially in
relation to physical factors such as hunger and satiety. Increased
awareness enables individuals to eat in response to these
physical cues of hunger and satiety.
Mindful eating has been shown to slow down consumption
of a meal and allows both registration of feelings of fullness and
greater control over eating(84,85). Additionally, a slower pace of
eating reduces overall energy consumption as individuals feel
full on a smaller quantity of food(86).
One study using fMRI showed a decrease in mid-line cortical
structures associated with interoception during a mindfulness
body scan. This suggests an increased awareness of internal
state(87). In another study, fMRI results showed reduced acti-
vation in the insula(88) which is the part of the cerebral cortex
implicated in self-awareness and perception and hence is
linked with interoceptive awareness.
Increased awareness of, and reduced responsiveness to,
internal emotional cues
Mindfulness trains individuals to notice distressing thoughts,
emotions and sensations. By increasing awareness of these
cues, individuals are then able to tolerate their distress and not
allow these non-physical cues make them eat more(77).
By learning to bring the experience fully into awareness many
types of distress that would have provoked an automatic reaction
can be tolerated. Thus, distress tolerance is increased and auto-
maticity reduced. In relation to emotional eating, mindfulness
reduces misperception of emotions as hunger and therefore
stops increased eating in response to non-physical cues(77).
As defusion-reduced reactivity enhances tolerance to non-
physical
emotional
cues,
the
cultivation
of
mindfulness
becomes self-reinforcing(89). Further, mindfulness increases the
capability to relax when faced with negative events and emo-
tion. This has been found to be especially true in reducing
impulsivity, which is associated with mindless overeating(77).
fMRI studies have shown altered activity levels in the
amygdala related to general emotional arousal/salience fol-
lowing mindfulness training. Decreased activation has been
found in the amygdala, the parahippocampal area and the
insula during perception of negative stimuli in subjects but
these activity levels have been regulated following mindfulness
training(90). Others have used fMRI to show that mindfulness
makes an impact on the neural systems underlying emotional
regulation. It appears to regulate amygdala functioning via
functional connectivity from the medial prefrontal cortex(91).
fMRI studies conducted on individuals practising mindfulness
have found a significant reduction in activity in the anterior cin-
gulated cortex region which plays a role in the processing of
emotion. ‘Findings collectively show that mindfulness meditation
has an overall “quietening” effect on brain regions associated with
subjective and cognitive appraisal of emotions’(87). Significant self-
reported differences in awareness of emotion are unlikely to be
simply due to a blunting of the emotional experience but
‘represent more fundamental change in regulatory response’(88).
Anatomical studies lend further support to changes in the
areas of the brain associated with emotional regulation. Studies
conducted pre- and post-MRI on participants following an
8-week mindfulness programme found an increase in grey
matter concentration in the left hippocampus and posterior
cingulated cortex, temporo-parietal junction, and cerebellum –
areas
associated
with
learning
and
memory
processes,
emotional regulation and self-referential processing(92).
Increased awareness of, and reduced responsiveness to,
external cues
Overeating may reflect a non-mindful reliance on environmental
or external cues (for example, packaging size), so that the cues
destroy the subject’s ability to self-monitor the food they eat(83).
The use of mindfulness is designed to interrupt these automatic,
non-conscious external influences(93). Increasing awareness of
an individual’s reactions to attractive food items, and a recogni-
tion of these reactions as passing mental states rather than real
experiences, reduced the likelihood of individuals initiating

 purchasing and eating behaviours(59). Mindfulness practice(83)
and mindful eating specifically reduced the impact of the
external norms around consumption and enabled individuals to
reduce their food intake(34,94).
fMRI has been used to compare results of subjects who
received an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction course
with those of a control group(95). When asked to pay attention
to the external sounds in the scanner environment, the mind-
fulness group showed increased functional connectivity in
auditory and visual networks and the areas associated with
attentional and self-referential processes.
These observations from fMRI studies are of interest but are
insufficient on their own to explain the mechanism by which
mindfulness exerts its effects. More research is needed to fully
elucidate further mechanisms and these must explain other
influencing behavioural factors.
Discussion
From the papers reviewed there appears to be reasonable
evidence that mindfulness, including mindful eating techniques,
can help to change eating behaviours. The evidence for the
effectiveness of mindfulness and mindful eating in binge eating
disorders appears to be the strongest with consistently positive
results in both overweight/obese populations and those of
normal-weight status. There was also a positive effect on
emotional eating as a result of mindfulness interventions and in
a lesser number of studies a positive result was seen for redu-
cing eating in response to external cues. This is consistent with
the findings of O’Reilly et al. in 2014(23), who examined the role
of mindfulness with obesity-related behaviours and a review
looking at the effectiveness of mindfulness in binge eating(19,23).
Food cravings, eating attitudes and body dissatisfaction were
explored in only a limited number of studies. Although binge
eating and emotional eating are important obesity-related
behaviours, the results for the use of mindfulness in achieving
weight loss in overweight/obese individuals were mixed and
generally effect sizes were small. This is not surprising given the
complex and multifaceted nature of obesity, which requires a
multi-pronged treatment approach. The diversity of the inter-
ventions makes it difficult to identify the effective elements.
With regard to the interventions that did not report weight loss
there were no striking differences from the ones that were
successful, except that a couple of the studies were of lower
intensity and shorter duration. This diverse range of treatments
included mindfulness as part of a third-wave therapy such as
ACT, mindfulness curricula based on established programmes
in other conditions adapted for eating, for example MBSR and
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, through to less intense
interventions which employed mindfulness techniques as
stand-alone interventions. However, the majority of successful
interventions included mindful eating as part of a comprehen-
sive mindfulness programme. These mindfulness programmes
contained core elements of mindfulness including meditation,
awareness and being present. A recent review on the effec-
tiveness of mindfulness in achieving weight loss found that the
majority of studies did result in weight loss but the extent to
which mindfulness could be attributed to the effect was not
apparent(22). This study also noted the wide variation in inter-
ventions and methodological weaknesses.
It is important to recognise that many of the studies in binge
eating and weight loss did not have a non-intervention
control group and did not measure changes in mindfulness.
Furthermore, few of the studies had a follow-up so it is not
possible to determine long-term success. Despite these meth-
odological weaknesses, the use of mindfulness and mindful
eating in weight management and obesity-related behaviours
shows promise and the field warrants further investigation.
In contrast to the intervention studies in overweight/obese stu-
dies, nearly half of the studies in normal-weight populations were
laboratory-based, day-long studies, many of which were carried
out among students. A small number of the studies were medium-
length interventions (i.e. 6–16 weeks’ duration), which highlights
the great variation in intensity of factors in the interventions in
normal-weight subjects. The interventions were diverse and
included teaching intuitive eating, providing mindfulness infor-
mation, a mindfulness group intervention for 4 months, body scan-
guided imagery, mindful eating exercises and mindful awareness.
Furthermore, the outcomes varied widely, so comparison between
studies was not possible. The outcomes included food choices,
food intake, and the following eating behaviours: cravings, binge
eating, internal cues, and the relationship with food. Overall, the
results indicated a positive role for mindfulness and/or mindful
eating on influencing eating behaviours. This avenue of research
also merits further research as this has the potential to be relevant
to public health nutrition messaging regarding food choices.
The observational studies also provide direction for future
research but, by their nature, are evidence of association only. It
is interesting to note that, in these observational studies, the
focus was on intuitive eating whereas only two interven-
tions(26,47) were based on intuitive eating. This indicates that
intuitive eating is an emerging topic and further research is
needed to examine its potential in positively having an impact
on eating behaviours. The findings of the observational studies
were unanimously positive, demonstrating a beneficial asso-
ciation of mindfulness/mindful eating or intuitive eating.
Overall, many studies were limited by small subject numbers
and were also predominately carried out among female popu-
lations, the majority of whom were from Caucasian back-
grounds. Given the importance of weight reduction in the
management of type 2 diabetes and in CVD, it was surprising
not to find more studies in these patient groups. This is likely to
be an area of study in the future.
While research into the mechanisms of action of mindfulness
is ongoing, particularly in relation to mindful eating, con-
comitant psychological and physiological findings have yielded
three key hypotheses about the associated processes involved
in the brain. Results from fMRI studies show that mindfulness is
associated with reduced amygdala activity and may reduce
emotional arousal. Mindfulness possibly works by increasing
inner physical cues to eat (hunger and satiety), and decreasing
the emotional and external cues to eat.
Only two studies reported negative results regarding the
mindfulness or mindful eating intervention (small increases in
weight and food intake), and one of these was in a population
that is not generalisable.

 Strengths and limitations of the present structured review
This structured review provides a literature review about the
potential of mindfulness, mindful eating, and intuitive eating to
make an impact on eating behaviours. It takes a broad
approach, which provides perspective on the state of current
research and direction of future research. It is common in
research for observational studies to precede interventions
where observed associations can be tested in experimental
conditions. The description of the interventions and the tools
used for outcome measures adds a new element to the
systematic reviews undertaken to date in this area.
The review was never intended to be a systematic review and,
as such, cannot make categorical statements on the quality of the
evidence base. Furthermore, a rigorous critical appraisal of the
literature is beyond the scope of this review. ‘Attention’ was not
included in the search terms for the interventions undertaken
and it has since become apparent that this would have been a
relevant search term. Attentive eating is a similar concept to
mindful eating and has been shown to reduce food intake(96,97).
Conclusions
Mindfulness and mindful eating interventions appear to be most
successful in the reduction of binge eating regardless of weight
status. Mindfulness and mindful eating interventions also
reduced emotional eating and eating in response to external
cues which are important behaviours related to obesity.
In overweight individuals, the impact of mindfulness and
mindful eating on reducing body weight was mixed; it might be
that mindfulness and mindful eating have a role to play in the
prevention of weight gain. Mindfulness/mindful eating resulted
in a positive shift in food habits and in the quantities of food
consumed in some studies. There is evidence both for the
efficacy of one-off mindfulness interventions and also for
the benefit of repeated practice on improving outcomes. On the
basis of this review, encouraging a mindful approach to eating
appears to be a positive message to be included in general
weight-management advice to the public.
