Introduction
Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with a range of 
complications and poor reproductive outcomes and can cause 
fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), which are character-
ized by lifelong physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities 
(1–3). The estimated prevalence of FASDs, based on a commu-
nity study of first grade students in the United States, ranges from 
2% to 5% (4). FASDs are completely preventable if a woman 
does not drink alcohol at any time while she is pregnant.
In 2010, the cost of excessive alcohol use in the United States 
was $249 billion, including $5.5 billion in costs related to 
drinking while pregnant (5). Pregnancy-related costs include 
increased health care needs and lost productivity, as well as 
subsequent costs, such as special education for children with 
an FASD (5). Lifetime cost for an infant with fetal alcohol syn-
drome (FAS), a single disorder within the FASD continuum, 
has been estimated to be $2 million (6).
The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend 
that adults who choose to drink should do so in moderation: up 
to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for 
men (7). However, these guidelines also recommend that some 
populations not consume any alcohol, including pregnant women 
and women who might be pregnant, as well as persons younger 
than the legal drinking age of 21 years (7).† In 2005, the U.S. 
Surgeon General released an updated advisory to women to raise 
awareness about FASDs (8). The advisory called for pregnant 
women and women considering pregnancy to abstain from drink-
ing alcohol to reduce their risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. 
Despite these known risks and warnings, a recent CDC study of 
alcohol use among reproductive-aged women found that 10.2% 
of pregnant women reported drinking any amount of alcohol 
during the past month and 3.1% reported that they binge drank 
(consumed four or more drinks on one occasion) (9).
Abstract
Background: Alcohol is a teratogen.* Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a range of adverse reproductive out-
comes and can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) characterized by lifelong physical, behavioral, and intel-
lectual disabilities. FASDs are completely preventable if a woman does not drink alcohol while pregnant.
Methods: CDC analyzed data from the 2011–2013 National Survey of Family Growth to generate U.S. prevalence esti-
mates of risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy for 4,303 nonpregnant, nonsterile women aged 15–44 years, by selected 
demographic and behavioral factors. A woman was considered at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy during the past 
month if she had sex with a male, drank any alcohol, and did not (and her partner did not with her) use contraception 
in the past month; was not sterile; and had a partner (or partners) not known to be sterile.
Results: The weighted prevalence of alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk among U.S. women aged 15–44 years was 7.3%. Dur-
ing a 1-month period, approximately 3.3 million women in the United States were at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Alcohol use in pregnancy is associated with low birthweight, 
preterm birth, birth defects, and developmental disabilities. Women of reproductive age should be informed of the risks of 
alcohol use during pregnancy, and contraception should be recommended, as appropriate, for women who do not want to 
become pregnant. Women wanting a pregnancy should be advised to stop drinking at the same time contraception is discon-
tinued. Health care providers should advise women not to drink at all if they are pregnant or there is any chance they might 
be pregnant. Alcohol misuse screening and behavioral counseling (also known as alcohol screening and brief intervention) 
is recommended for all adults in primary care, including reproductive-aged and pregnant women, as an evidenced-based 
approach to reducing alcohol consumption among persons who consume alcohol in excess of the recommended guidelines.

Approximately half of all pregnancies in the United States 
are unplanned (10), and alcohol-related fetal harm can occur 
in early pregnancy, before a woman recognizes that she is 
pregnant. Therefore, the best time to assess alcohol consump-
tion and inform women about health consequences to them 
and their child is before pregnancy. Multiple organizations 
and groups advise women not to drink if they are or might be 
pregnant (8,11–15). The American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the U.S. Preventive Services 
Task Force both recommend routine alcohol screening and 
brief counseling (intervention) in primary care settings (11,12). 
ACOG also recommends annual alcohol-use screening for all 
women seeking obstetric or gynecologic care and for women 
within the first trimester of pregnancy, as well as provision of 
information about risks of drinking during pregnancy (11). 
CDC analyzed data on female participants in the 2011–2013 
National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to estimate the 
national prevalence of alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk among 
nonpregnant women in the United States and to identify char-
acteristics of women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy.
Methods
NSFG uses a multistage probability-based, nationally 
representative sample of the household population of males 
and females, aged 15–44 years. Data collected from women 
during September 2011–September 2013 were analyzed for 
this report. The response rate for females included in the 
2011–2013 NSFG was 73.4%. Statistical design, interviewing, 
and data processing of the 2011–2013 NSFG were conducted 
by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, 
under a contract with the National Center for Health Statistics, 
in collaboration with the center’s NSFG team.§ Since NSFG 
data were obtained using a complex multistage probability 
cluster sample design, CDC used 2011–2013 NSFG data 
weighted to reflect the female household population of the 
United States in July 2012, the midpoint of data collection.
Prevalence estimates of risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy 
and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated 
for 4,303 nonpregnant, nonsterile women aged 15–44 years, 
stratified by age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, 
number of live births, and smoking status. A woman was 
considered to be at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy if 
she 1) had vaginal sex with a male during the past 4 weeks, 
2) drank alcohol in any amount during the past 30 days, 3) did 
not (and her partner did not with her) use contraception dur-
ing the month before the interview, and 4) was not sterile and 
she did not have a partner (or partners) known to be sterile 
(Figure 1). An additional, weighted analysis was conducted to 
determine whether alcohol consumption differed on the basis 
of pregnancy desire, sexual activity, and contraception status. 
A woman was considered to desire pregnancy if she was having 
sex without using contraception in the month of the interview, 
and she reported that the reason for not using contraception 
was that either she or her partner wanted to become pregnant 
as soon as possible.¶ The prevalence of any alcohol consump-
tion during the past 30 days and 95% CIs were estimated for 
four groups: 1) women wanting to become pregnant as soon 
as possible who had sex with a man without using contracep-
tion, 2) women not wanting to become pregnant as soon as 
possible who had sex with a man without using contraception, 
3) women who had sex using contraception or had a sterile 
partner, and 4) women who did not have sex with a man.
Results
Among nonpregnant, nonsterile U.S. women aged 
15–44 years, the weighted alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk 
prevalence was 7.3% during a 1-month period (Table). The 
risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy differed significantly by age, 
and was highest among women aged 25–29 years (10.4%) and 
lowest among women aged 15–20 years (2.2%). The risk for 
alcohol-exposed pregnancy was also higher among women who 
were married (11.7%) or cohabiting (13.6%), compared with 
single women (2.3%); among women who had one live birth 
(13.6%), compared with women with no live births (5.8%) or 
with two or more live births (6.0%); and among women who 
were current smokers (10.7%), compared with nonsmokers 
(6.0%). The prevalence of alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk 
was positively associated with level of education, but did not 
differ by race/ethnicity.
The prevalence of alcohol use was similar among the three 
subgroups of sexually active women, ranging from 65.9% to 
74.3%, and did not differ by pregnancy desire (Figure 2). 
Women who reported not having sex with a male during the 
preceding 4 weeks had the lowest prevalence of alcohol use 
(50.7%, CI = 45.6–55.8).
Conclusions and Comments
Alcohol is a known teratogen that can cause adverse repro-
ductive outcomes for women, and serious, lifelong problems for 
a person exposed to it prenatally. These risks occur throughout 
pregnancy, including the period before a woman knows that

¶ Pregnancy desire was assessed by the following questions: “Is the reason you 
are not using a method of birth control now because you, yourself, want to 
become pregnant as soon as possible?” (Response options: Yes, No, Refused, 
and Don’t Know); and “Your partner, does he want you to become pregnant 
as soon as possible?” (Response options: Inapplicable, Yes, No, Refused, Don’t 
Know, and No Current Partner [if volunteered]). A woman was desiring 
pregnancy if she reported that either she or her partner wanted to become 
pregnant as soon as possible.

she is pregnant (16). All types of alcohol are harmful. To help 
prevent adverse consequences of alcohol consumption during 
pregnancy, health care providers should discuss and recom-
mend, as appropriate, available contraception methods,** 
including condoms to protect against sexually transmitted 
diseases, to women who are sexually active and drink alcohol.
Reasons for some of the associations found in this study are 
unknown. One possible reason why married or cohabiting 
women were more likely than single women to be at risk for an 
alcohol-exposed pregnancy is that they might be less likely to 
use contraception. The risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy 
was most likely lowest among women with less than a high 
school diploma because most of them were aged <21 years, a 
population less likely to drink. The higher risk for an alcohol-
exposed pregnancy among smokers might be associated, in 
part, with smokers being more likely to drink alcohol. Health 
risk behaviors including excessive alcohol use and cigarette 
smoking can co-occur (17).

The current study found that approximately 3.3 million 
women aged 15–44 years reported drinking alcohol in the past 
month even though they had sex and did not use contracep-
tion, and thus were at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. 
Raising awareness about the dangers of alcohol use among 
reproductive-aged women is important, especially if con-
traception is not being used. This study also reinforces the 
importance of routinely screening women of reproductive age 
for alcohol use, and providing intervention before pregnancy. 
Health care professionals need to advise women who want to 
become pregnant and have discontinued contraception to stop 
drinking alcohol. These efforts might facilitate progress toward 
the Healthy People 2020 objective to increase alcohol absti-
nence among pregnant women from 89.4% to 98.3% (14).
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends alcohol 
misuse screening and behavioral counseling (also known as alco-
hol screening and brief intervention [alcohol SBI]) for all adults 
in primary care, including pregnant women (12). Alcohol SBI 
involves screening for alcohol misuse using a recommended and 
valid instrument or screening question, and then conducting a 
brief (typically 6–15-minute) intervention or counseling session 
if a person screens positive. The brief intervention ascertains 
whether the person wants to reduce their drinking and places 
their behavior in the context of their overall health. Finally, a 
small percentage of persons with indications of alcohol depen-
dence are referred for more specialized treatment (12).
Systematic reviews and a meta-analysis have shown that 
alcohol SBI is effective in reducing alcohol consumption 
among women of childbearing age who were included in stud-
ies of both men and women (18–20), and in studies limited 
to women of childbearing age (21,22). Among women of 
childbearing age specifically, a subanalysis of a Trial for Early 
Alcohol Treatment (Project TrEAT)†† conducted at follow-up 
48 months later found reductions in mean alcohol intake of 
48% (from 14 to 7.5 drinks per week), and reductions in the 
prevalence of binge drinking (from 93% to 68%) and number 
of binge drinking episodes during the previous 30 days (from 
five to three) in the treatment group (n = 103), compared 
with baseline, and a 68% reduction in the number of women 
who drank more than 13 drinks per week, which was more of 
a reduction than in the control group (n = 102) (21). Alcohol 
SBI was found to be significantly associated with maintaining 
abstinence in a sample of 143 pregnant women at high risk; 
86% of women in the intervention group reported continued 
abstinence, compared with 72% in the control group (23).
Although alcohol SBI is routinely recommended in primary 
care and is effective in reducing excessive alcohol use, a previous 
CDC study reported that only one in six U.S. adults reported 
ever talking to a health professional about alcohol (24). This is 
particularly concerning for women of childbearing age, given 
the serious consequences associated with drinking alcohol 
while pregnant.
Behavior change is complex and must occur across multiple 
domains, from the individual to broader systems, to be effective. 
Thus, primary care interventions are necessary, but not adequate 
to change population health (25). CDC has developed a guide 
 
†† Project TrEAT included a large sample of women aged 18–40 years, and was 
conducted in the offices of 64 community-based primary care physicians from 
10 Wisconsin counties. The intervention involved two visits with a primary 
care provider, follow-up phone calls, feedback about health behaviors, and 
other information.

to help clinical practices systematically implement alcohol SBI 
(26). The Affordable Care Act requires coverage of the U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force B-level recommended clinical 
preventive services such as alcohol SBI, without copayment.§§ 
Coupling alcohol SBI with population-based strategies recom-
mended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force to 
reduce excessive alcohol use might have greater impact. These 
recommended population-based strategies include electronic 
SBI (e.g., use of computers, telephones, or mobile devices to 
deliver components of alcohol SBI¶¶) that can occur within 
clinical or other environments, as well as enhanced enforcement 
of laws prohibiting sale of alcohol to minors.***
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, NSFG data are based on self-reporting and are subject 
to respondent recall bias. Second, social desirability bias might 
have resulted in an underestimation of risk for alcohol-exposed 
pregnancy; however, questions on alcohol consumption were 
asked as part of the audio, computer-assisted self-interview, a data 
collection method that can reduce this bias. Finally, the timeframes 
of variables used to define risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy in 
this study did not completely align. Specifically, contraception use 
was measured in the calendar month before the interview but the 
other variables were measured in the 4 weeks or 30 days before 
the interview. Fewer than 6% of nonpregnant, nonsterile women 
changed their contraceptive practices between the month of 
interview and the calendar month before the interview, suggesting 
that the contraception measure used in this study is a reasonable 
approximation of current contraceptive practices, despite the slight 
misalignment in timeframes.
Alcohol SBI by a health care provider, combined with assess-
ment of a woman’s contraceptive needs, can help reduce a 
woman’s risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Some women 
might benefit from extended counseling or an increased 
 §§ The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires that 
nongrandfathered private health plans provide coverage without cost-sharing 
for services that have in effect an “A” or “B” recommendation from the U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Because USPSTF issued a “B” 
recommendation for alcohol SBI in adults aged ≥18 years, this must be 
covered by such plans, Section 1001 of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act, Public Law 111-148, 2010 (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-

interventions (27) might be needed to help them modify their 
drinking or contraception behaviors, or both. A comprehen-
sive approach that greatly increases alcohol SBI, extended 
counseling when needed, and population-based strategies 
should reduce the risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy and the 
concomitant negative health outcomes over time.

Key Points
• Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with a range 
of adverse reproductive outcomes and can cause fetal 
alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by lifelong 
physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities.
• Approximately 3.3 million U.S. women aged 15–44 years 
who were not pregnant and not sterile were at risk for 
an alcohol-exposed pregnancy during 2011–2013.
• Three in four women who wanted to get pregnant as 
soon as possible reported drinking alcohol, putting 
them at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Any 
sexually active woman of reproductive age who is 
drinking alcohol and not using birth control is at risk 
for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy.
• A developing baby can be exposed to alcohol before a 
woman knows she is pregnant. Approximately half of 
all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned. 
Even if a pregnancy is planned, a woman probably will 
not know she is pregnant until she is 4–6 weeks into 
the pregnancy.
• Alcohol screening and brief intervention is 
recommended for all adults, including pregnant 
women. This clinical service is effective, inexpensive, 
and can be accomplished in 6–15 minutes, although 
follow-up sessions might be needed. Health care 
providers should advise women not to drink at all if 
they are pregnant or might be pregnant.
• To help prevent adverse consequences of alcohol 
consumption during pregnancy, health care providers 
should discuss and recommend, as appropriate, 
available contraception methods to women who are 
sexually active and drink alcohol. They should also 
screen them for excessive alcohol use and counsel or 
refer them as needed regarding their overall health.
