Epidemiology of Varicella During the 2-Dose Varicella Vaccination Program — 
United States, 2005–2014
Adriana S. Lopez, MHS1; John Zhang, PhD1; Mona Marin, MD1
Before availability of varicella vaccine in the United States, 
an estimated 4 million varicella cases, 11,000–13,500 varicella-
related hospitalizations, and 100–150 varicella-related deaths 
occurred annually. The varicella vaccination program was 
implemented in the United States in 1996 as a 1-dose routine 
childhood program. Based on data from two varicella active 
surveillance sites, the varicella vaccination program led to 90% 
decline in incidence over the next decade (1). However, because 
of continued varicella outbreaks, a routine 2-dose schedule (at 
ages 12–15 months and 4–6 years) was recommended and has 
been in place since 2006 (2). The declines in incidence (1,3–6) 
made it feasible for states to implement varicella case-based 
surveillance and to report varicella data to CDC through the 
National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). 
State data have become the primary source for monitoring 
trends in varicella incidence nationally (7). Using NNDSS 
data, CDC previously reported nationwide declines in varicella 
incidence of 72% from the end of the 1-dose to the early years 
of the 2-dose varicella vaccination program (2006–2010) (7). 
This report updates varicella incidence trends to include the 
most recent years in the 2-dose varicella vaccination program. 
Between the period 2005–2006 (before the 2-dose recommen-
dation) and 2013–2014, overall varicella incidence declined 
84.6%, with the largest declines reported in children aged 
5–9 years (89.3%) and 10–14 years (84.8%). The availability of 
varicella-specific data varied over time. During the last 2 years 
examined (2013 and 2014), completeness of reporting of two 
critical variables monitored by CDC, vaccination status (receipt 
of at least 1 dose of varicella vaccine) of cases and severity of 
disease based on number of lesions, were 54.2% and 39.1%, 
respectively. State and local health departments, in collabora-
tion with CDC, should continue working to improve reporting 
of cases and completeness of critical varicella-specific variables 
to better monitor impact of the varicella vaccination program.
Demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic data from varicella 
cases reported through passive surveillance from state and local 
health departments are electronically transmitted to CDC via 
NNDSS. CDC analyzed data from all states and the District 
of Columbia (DC) that reported varicella cases, starting with 
the year the state first reported varicella cases to CDC. For 
this report, DC is counted as a state. An earlier report had 
calculated varicella incidence using ad hoc inclusion criteria of 
adequate (incidence of ≥1 case per 100,000 population) and 
consistent (≥3 consecutive years) reporting (7); in this analysis 
these criteria were also examined.
Nationwide age-specific and overall varicella incidence 
rates from passive surveillance data were calculated for each 
year from 2005 to 2014 by dividing the aggregate number of 
confirmed and probable* varicella cases from reporting states 
by the aggregate population of the same states using U.S. 
Census data (https://www.census.gov/popest/data/historical/
index.html). To examine trends between the end of the 1-dose 
varicella vaccination program and the most recent years of the 
2-dose program, incidence rates were averaged for 2005–2006 
and 2013–2014 to account for year-to-year variability.
To evaluate changes in varicella incidence since the varicella 
vaccination program was introduced, incidence trends from 
1993 to 2014, which include data from before the start of 
the U.S. varicella vaccination program, were analyzed for 
four states (Illinois, Michigan, Texas, and West Virginia) that 
have reported varicella cases to CDC every year since before 
implementation of the varicella vaccination program. Poisson 
regression was used to assess all trends over time.
Provisional varicella-specific case-based data from 2013 
and 2014 were analyzed to assess critical variables monitored 
by CDC: vaccination status of cases, disease severity (based 
on number of lesions),† hospitalization, and association with 
outbreaks (defined variably by states as three or more cases or 
as five or more cases).
During 2005–2014, the number of states reporting varicella data 
to CDC through NNDSS increased 48.1%, from 27 in 2005 to 
40 in 2014 (Figure 1). Among the 40 states reporting data in 2014, 
38 have implemented case-based varicella surveillance. The average 
annual varicella incidence declined significantly (84.6%) from 25.4 
per 100,000 population during 2005–2006 to 3.9 per 100,000 
population during 2013–2014 (p<0.001) (Figure 1). Statistically 
significant declines in incidence were reported for all age groups 
during this time (Figure 2), with the largest declines among children 
* A confirmed case of varicella is an illness with acute onset of diffuse (generalized) 
maculopapulovesicular rash without other apparent cause that is laboratory 
confirmed or that meets the clinical case definition and is epidemiologically 
linked to a confirmed or a probable case. A probable case of varicella meets the 
clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, and is not epidemiologically 
linked to another probable or confirmed case.
† Varicella disease is classified as mild (<50 lesions), mild/moderate (50–249 
lesions), moderate (250–499 lesions), or severe (≥500 lesions or any 
complications such as bacterial superinfection, varicella pneumonitis, 
encephalitis, hospitalization, or death). http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/

aged 5–9 years (89.3%) and 10–14 years (84.8%). Fewer states 
contributed adequate (incidence ≥1 case per 100,000 population) 
and consistent (≥3 consecutive years) data (26 in 2005 and 35 in 
2014); however, the decline in varicella incidence, when restricted 
to these states, was similar (80.2%) to that in all reporting states 
and decreased from 27.3 cases per 100,000 population during 
2005–2006 to 5.4 per 100,000 during 2013–2014 (p<0.001).
In the four states (Illinois, Michigan, Texas, and West 
Virginia) that have been reporting varicella cases annually since 
before implementation of the varicella vaccination program, 
incidence declined an average of 97.4% from 1993–1995 to 
2013–2014 (range = 92.9%–97.9%) (Figure 3).
During 2013–2014, completeness of varicella-specific data 
from states that reported to NNDSS varied. Data on vaccina-
tion status of varicella patients was available for 12,784 (59.8%) 
cases; 7,000 (54.8%) of those cases occurred in persons who 
had received at least 1 dose of varicella vaccine. Among these 
reports, the number of doses received was reported for 2,266 
(32.4%) patients, including 921 (39.0%) persons who had 
received 1 dose of varicella vaccine, 1,331 (56.4%) who had 
received 2 doses, and 14 (0.6%) who were reported to have 
received 3 doses. A total of 3,715 (17.4%) reports included 
information about hospitalization. Among these reports, 81 
(2.2%) indicated that the patient was hospitalized. Reports 
from 17 (22.4%) of 76 hospitalized patients with information 
on vaccination status indicated receipt of varicella vaccine, and 
13 vaccinated hospitalized patients had information on num-
ber of doses. Eight patients had received 1 dose, and five had 
received 2 doses. Among the 8,358 (39.1%) case reports with 
data on the number of skin lesions, 4,269 (51.1%) were consid-
ered to have had mild disease and 4,089 (48.9%) had moder-
ate to severe disease. Mild disease occurred significantly more 
frequently among vaccinated patients (76.8%) than among 
unvaccinated patients (23.2%) (p<0.001). Information on 
outbreak association of cases was available for 13,826 (64.6%)

an outbreak. Laboratory testing data were reported for 2,240 
(24.6%) of 9,104 cases for which information about varicella

Discussion
Previous reports have documented significant declines in 
varicella incidence in the United States since the varicella 
vaccination program was implemented in 1996 through the 
early years of the 2-dose program (1,3–8). During 1995–2010, 
data to assess impact of the varicella vaccination program were 
obtained from a varicella active surveillance project, which was 
discontinued in 2010 (3). Since 2000, more states are reporting 
to NNDSS; these data can now be used to assess impact of 
the program (7). NNDSS data documented an 85% decline 
in varicella incidence from the 2-year period 2005–2006 (the 
end of the 1-dose varicella vaccination program) through 
2013–2014, and a 97% decline since the varicella vaccination 
program was implemented. Since recommendation of the 
second varicella vaccine dose, the largest declines in incidence 
have occurred in the age groups more likely to have received 
the second dose (children and adolescents aged 5–14 years). 
During 2013–2014, 55% of all reported varicella cases 
occurred in persons who had received varicella vaccine; this 
finding is not unexpected in a highly vaccinated population, 
in which overall incidence declines, but among cases that still 
occur, a high percentage will be among vaccinated persons.
As varicella incidence continues to decline, more states are 
able to conduct case-based surveillance. Almost 80% of states 
are reporting case-based varicella data to CDC for use in 
national surveillance. However, the completeness of reported 
data varies, and data from critical variables are missing for 
approximately 40% of cases. Continued efforts by states to 
improve reporting and completeness of reported data will be 
valuable for accurately describing trends and epidemiology of 
varicella disease.
Although incidence rates were slightly higher when only 
states with adequate and consistent reporting (7) were included 
in trend analyses, the percentage declines between 2005–2006 
and 2013–2014 were similar. Therefore, removing the 
adequacy and consistency of reporting criteria for calculating 
incidence allows for the inclusion of more states to provide a 
better representation of varicella incidence nationwide.
Varicella surveillance data can also provide information 
about characteristics of cases that result in severe outcomes 
such as hospitalization and death. Analyses of administrative 
(hospital discharge, medical claims, and vital statistics) data

have demonstrated significant declines in hospitalizations 
(86%–93%) and deaths (87%) among all age groups since 
implementation of the varicella vaccination program (9,10). 
However, it is important to understand why severe outcomes 
still occur and whether these outcomes are occurring among vac-
cinated persons. Improvements in completeness of NNDSS data 
will permit evaluation of severe outcomes by vaccination status.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, because data are passively reported and case 
ascertainment is likely incomplete, varicella cases might be 
missed, resulting in an underestimate of incidence. Conversely, 
because varicella disease in vaccinated persons is mild and 
atypical (fewer lesions and predominantly maculopapular rash) 
and increasingly challenging to diagnose clinically, nonvaricella 
cases might be misclassified, resulting in possible overestimates 
of incidence. Second, laboratory testing is still not routinely 
done for varicella diagnosis; only 25% of reported cases had 
available information about testing, although some states 
might not receive laboratory data if results are negative. Finally, 
approximately 40% of data for important varicella-specific 
variables were missing; therefore, the reported findings describ-
ing patient characteristics should be interpreted with caution.
With the reduction in the number of varicella cases, states 
have increased opportunities for improving varicella surveil-
lance to better monitor impact of the vaccination program. 
Starting in 2015, 48 jurisdictions have been funded through 
CDC’s Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity program to 
add a vaccine preventable disease surveillance coordinator to 
help enhance varicella surveillance. Jurisdictions with varicella 
case-based surveillance are working to improve reporting of 
cases and completeness of reporting. In addition, CDC will 
receive data on varicella outbreaks from all funded jurisdictions, 
to allow better assessment of impact of the second dose on 
varicella outbreaks. These efforts will improve the accuracy of 
national data, provide important information for further assess-
ment of varicella vaccination, and inform vaccination policy.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The introduction of a routine childhood dose of varicella 
vaccine in the United States in 1996 led to an approximate 90% 
decline in varicella incidence. However, because of continued 
outbreaks, a second routine childhood dose of varicella vaccine 
was introduced in 2006. Declines in incidence have continued 
during the early years since implementation of the 2-dose 
vaccination recommendation and have made it feasible for 
more states to conduct varicella case-based surveillance, such 
that state data reported to CDC through the National Notifiable 
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) are now used to monitor 
trends in varicella incidence.
What is added by this report?
Among all states that reported varicella data to NNDSS, there 
was an 85% decline in varicella incidence from 2005–2006 (the 
end of the 1-dose varicella vaccination program) to 2013–2014. 
The largest declines occurred among children and adolescents 
aged 5–14 years (those age groups likely to receive a second 
dose). Although the number of states reporting varicella data to 
CDC has increased over time, >40% of reported cases are 
missing data for varicella-specific variables important for 
monitoring the varicella vaccination program.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Further reduction in the number of varicella cases will provide 
states with increased opportunities for enhancing varicella 
surveillance and improving completeness of reporting to 
monitor impact of the vaccination program. These efforts will 
improve the accuracy of national data, provide important 
information for further assessment of varicella vaccination, and 
inform vaccination policy.
