ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors may reduce cardiovascular and heart failure risk in patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to examine the effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular biomarkers in older
patients with T2DM.
METHODS In 666 T2DM patients randomized to receive canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo, the study assessed the
median percent change in serum N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity troponin I
(hsTnI), soluble (s)ST2, and galectin-3 from baseline to 26, 52, and 104 weeks.
RESULTS Both serum NT-proBNP and serum hsTnI levels increased in placebo recipients, but they remained largely
unchanged in those randomized to canagliflozin. Hodges-Lehmann estimates of the difference in median percent change
between pooled canagliflozin and placebo were �15.0%, �16.1%, and �26.8% for NT-proBNP, and �8.3%, �11.9%,
and �10.0% for hsTnI at weeks 26, 52, and 104, respectively (all p < 0.05). Serum sST2 was unchanged with canagli-
flozin and placebo over 104 weeks. Serum galectin-3 modestly increased from baseline with canagliflozin versus placebo,
with significant differences observed at 26 and 52 weeks but not at 104 weeks. These results remained unchanged when
only patients with complete samples were assessed.
CONCLUSIONS Compared with placebo, treatment with canagliflozin delayed the rise in serum NT-proBNP and
hsTnI for over 2 years in older T2DM patients. These cardiac biomarker data provide support for the beneficial
cardiovascular effect of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in T2DM. (A Safety and Efficacy Study of

 S
odium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibi-
tors are a new class of diabetes drugs that lower
blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) through increased urinary excretion
of glucose (1). SGLT2 inhibitors may have other cardi-
ometabolic benefits; they cause natriuresis, a mild os-
motic diuresis, and a net caloric loss that contribute
to reductions in body weight and blood pressure
(BP) (1). Additionally, increased delivery of sodium
to the macula densa helps to restore normal glomer-
ular pressure, which, in turn, results in improved
renal function over the longer term (2).
SGLT2 inhibitors have recently been studied in
large cardiovascular outcomes trials for evaluating
the cardiovascular effects of newer T2DM agents (3).
In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardio-
vascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes
Mellitus Patients) study, treatment with empagli-
flozin resulted in reduction in the risk for major
adverse cardiovascular events (3-point MACE: car-
diovascular
death,
nonfatal
stroke,
and
nonfatal
myocardial infarction) compared with placebo, driven
by a 38% reduction in cardiovascular death; empa-
gliflozin also reduced the risk of hospitalization for
heart failure by 35% relative to placebo (4). These
effects were apparent early after initiating treatment
with empagliflozin, suggesting that acute changes
may be at least partially responsible for the observed
outcomes (4). Hypotheses regarding the mechanism
of
cardiovascular
benefit
for
SGLT2
inhibition
observed in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study have
focused
on
the
multiple
effects
beyond
glucose
lowering, such as diuresis and natriuresis, weight
loss, BP lowering, metabolic effects on the myocar-
dium, favorable hemodynamic changes, and attenu-
ation of cardiac remodeling (5–12); each may result in
improved cardiovascular outcomes (11).
Biomarkers are useful in prognosis determination
and informing the mechanism of benefit provided by
therapeutic agents (13). N-terminal pro–B-type natri-
uretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is recommended for the
diagnosis and management of heart failure, with
potential utility in the prediction of coronary heart
disease and stroke outcomes (14). Similarly, bio-
markers
of
cardiomyocyte
injury
(e.g.,
high-
sensitivity troponin I [hsTnI]) and those involved
in cardiovascular stress/tissue fibrosis (e.g., soluble
[s]ST2, galectin-3) may help elucidate prognosis and
disease progression, with recent data, in particular,
for hsTnI in T2DM (15).
There are very limited data on the effects of SGLT2
inhibitors on cardiovascular biomarkers (16–18). In
this study, we sought to assess the longitu-
dinal
changes
in
the
concentrations
of
NT-proBNP, hsTnI, sST2, and galectin-3 in
older patients with T2DM randomized to
receive canagliflozin or placebo in a 104-week
study (19,20) to gain insights into the mech-
anisms of the potential beneficial cardiovas-
cular effect of SGLT2 inhibitors.
METHODS
PATIENTS. This post hoc, exploratory anal-
ysis
was
conducted
using
stored
serum
samples
from
a
104-week,
randomized,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
study
(NCT01106651) that evaluated the efficacy
and safety of canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg in
older patients with T2DM. Full study design and key
inclusion/exclusion
criteria
have
previously
been
reported (19,20). Briefly, eligible patients were adults
with T2DM who were 55 to 80 years of age, had
glycosylated hemoglobin $7.0% and #10.0% and
estimated
glomerular
filtration
rate
(eGFR)
$50
ml/min/1.73 m2, and were either not on any anti-
hyperglycemic agent or were on a stable regimen of
monotherapy or combination therapy. Patients with a
history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina,
previous coronary revascularization, cerebrovascular
accident within 3 months before screening, history of
New York Heart Association functional class III to IV
symptoms, or uncontrolled hypertension were not
eligible to participate. This study was conducted in
accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki and followed good clinical
practice
and
applicable
regulatory
requirements.
Approval was obtained from institutional review
boards and independent ethics committees for each
participating center. Participants provided informed
written consent before enrollment in the study.
ENDPOINTS/ASSESSMENTS. Serum
samples
were
collected at baseline and at weeks 26, 52, and 104, and
stored at �80�C. NT-proBNP was measured on the
cobas e601 immunoanalyzer using the proBNP II
electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (Roche Di-
agnostics,
Indianapolis,
Indiana),
with
interassay
coefficients of variation (CV) of 2.5% at 137.2 pg/ml
(low-quality
control
concentration)
and
2.3%
at
4,830
pg/ml
(high-quality
control
concentration).
High-sensitivity TnI and galectin-3 were measured on
the Architect i2000SR immunoanalyzer using chemi-
luminescent
microparticle
immunoassays
(Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois). CV were 4.0% at
20.4 ng/l and 3.7% at 15,050 ng/l for hsTnI, and 4.0%
at 9.3 ng/ml and 2.9% at 74.4 ng/ml for galectin-3.

 Soluble ST2 was measured using a sandwich mono-
clonal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Critical
Diagnostics, San Diego, California), and the CV were
7.6% at 28.2 ng/ml and 7.5% at 60.0 ng/ml. For each
assay, all samples were run in a blinded fashion and
in the same period, thereby minimizing interassay
variations.
To understand secular trends in biomarkers as
a function of treatment allocation, absolute and
percent change from baseline in serum levels of
NT-proBNP,
hsTnI,
sST2,
galectin-3,
eGFR,
and
hematocrit were analyzed at each time point for pa-
tients with data at baseline and at any follow-up time
point thereafter. Given the non-normality of these
biomarker data including change and percent change
from visit to visit, the medians of the change and
percent change were analyzed. Data for the 2 cana-
gliflozin doses were pooled after it was determined
that there was no dose response observed on any of
the biomarkers. A sensitivity analysis was also per-
formed to evaluate absolute and percent change from
baseline in biomarkers in the cohort of patients with
complete sets of samples (i.e., data available at all
visits, including baseline and weeks 26, 52, and 104).
STATISTICAL
ANALYSES. Nonparametric
Hodges-
Lehmann estimates of the difference between cana-
gliflozin
and
placebo
in
median
change
and
median percent change from baseline were calculated
for
each
biomarker
at
each
time
point.
The
distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) and nom-
inal p values for the differences in the median change
and
median
percent
change
were
based
on
the
Wilcoxon rank sum test (21). SE for the median and
median percent change at each time point were esti-
mated using the bootstrap technique by simulated
repeated samples for each biomarker and treatment
group. Spearman correlation coefficients between
change from baseline in the specific biomarker and
change from baseline in selected clinical parameters
(i.e.,
glycosylated
hemoglobin,
body
weight,
systolic BP, hemoglobin, hematocrit, eGFR) were
determined within each treatment group at each time
point.
RESULTS
PATIENTS. Of 714 patients in the overall study pop-
ulation, 666 patients (93.3%) had serum samples at
baseline and $1 post-baseline follow-up time point,
and these patients were included in this analysis.
Among patients included in the biomarker assess-
ments, baseline characteristics were balanced be-
tween groups and were generally consistent with the
overall study population (Table 1); 77% had a history
of hypertension and 30% had a history of microvas-
cular disease (i.e., neuropathy, retinopathy, or ne-
phropathy). The majority of patients (74%) were
taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or
angiotensin receptor blocker; 25%, 23%, and 34% of
patients
were
on
beta-blockers,
calcium-channel
blockers, and diuretic agents, respectively (Table 1).
Of those taking diuretic agents, the majority took
thiazides (29.2% in the placebo arm and 28.9% in the
canagliflozin
arm),
whereas
loop
diuretic
agents
(4.6% and 3.6%) or mineralocorticoid receptor antag-
onists (0.5% and 3.1%) were less commonly used.
During the course of the study, no changes in elec-
trocardiographic parameters, such as PR interval, QRS
interval, QT/QTc, or RR intervals, were noted between
treatment groups (data not shown).

 Hodges-Lehmann
estimates
of
the
difference
in
median percent change between canagliflozin and
placebo at weeks 26, 52, and 104 were �15.0%
(95% CI: �27.4% to �3.3%), �16.1% (95% CI: �28.8%
to �3.8%), and �26.8% (95% CI: �42.3% to �10.7%),
respectively. A between-group treatment effect was
observed at 26 weeks and persisted over 104 weeks
(nominal p < 0.05 at weeks 26 and 52, nominal
p < 0.01 at week 104). Considering the relationship
between baseline and 104-week concentrations of
NT-proBNP (Online Figure 1A), a lower slope from
baseline to final measurement was observed in those
treated with canagliflozin.
From a baseline median of approximately 3.3 pg/ml,
serum hsTnI also gradually increased with placebo at
each time point, but was reduced or unchanged with
canagliflozin over 104 weeks (Figure 1B). Hodges-
Lehmann
estimates
of
the
difference
in
median
percent change between canagliflozin and placebo at
weeks 26, 52, and 104 were �8.3% (95% CI: �14.0%
to
�2.5%),
�11.9%
(95%
CI:
�18.0%
to
�5.6%),
and �10.0% (95% CI: �17.3% to �2.6%), respectively.
Differences between canagliflozin and placebo were
significant at each time point (nominal p < 0.01 for
each
between-group
difference).
Considering
the
correlation between baseline and 104-week concen-
trations of hsTnI (Online Figure 1B), a lower slope
from baseline to final measurement was observed in
those treated with canagliflozin.
Baseline serum sST2 concentrations were approxi-
mately 29 ng/ml. In contrast to NT-proBNP and hsTnI,
median sST2 levels were unchanged in both the cana-
gliflozin and placebo groups at each time point
(Hodges-Lehmann estimates of the difference in me-
dian percent change of �0.8% [95% CI: �3.3% to 1.7%],
0.2% [95% CI: �2.6% to 3.0%], and �0.4% [95%
CI: �3.5% to 2.7%] at weeks 26, 52, and 104, respec-
tively; nominal p > 0.05 at each time point) (Figure 1C).
Baseline
serum
galectin-3
concentrations
were
approximately 17 ng/ml. Small increases from baseline
in
median
galectin-3
levels
were
observed
with
canagliflozin relative to placebo at 26 weeks (6.6%
[95% CI: 3.7% to 9.6%]; nominal p < 0.01) and
52 weeks (5.1% [95% CI: 2.0% to 8.3%]; nominal
p < 0.01); by 104 weeks, the difference in galectin-3
was still numerically higher in the canagliflozin arm

 but not statistically significant (3.0% [95% CI: �0.7%
to 6.6%]; nominal p ¼ 0.11) (Figure 1D). It is of note that
similar trends in eGFR were seen as in the galectin-3
data; modest decreases in eGFR were seen at 26 and
52 weeks with canagliflozin compared with placebo,
but by 104 weeks, no difference in change in eGFR was
observed between treatment groups.
With the exception of a negative correlation be-
tween galectin-3 concentrations and eGFR, there
were generally no clinically meaningful correlations
between change in biomarkers and change in selected
physiological parameters at any time point (Online
Table 1).
In a sensitivity analysis among patients who had
biomarker data at baseline and all 3 time points,
changes in cardiovascular biomarkers were consistent
with those seen in the primary analysis (Online
Figures 2A to 2D).
DISCUSSION
In this randomized trial of older patients with T2DM
with biomarker profiles consistent with a generally
higher risk for cardiovascular events, we found that
serum concentrations of NT-proBNP and hsTnI, bio-
markers with proven prognostic value for cardiovas-
cular risk in T2DM (22), rose over a 2-year period in
patients allocated to placebo, whereas canagliflozin
treatment attenuated their rise. In contrast, we found
no obvious effect of treatment with canagliflozin on
concentrations of sST2, with a modest, nonpersistent
rise in galectin-3. The effects on NT-proBNP and
hsTnI seen with canagliflozin versus placebo in this
post hoc analysis are compatible with attenuation
of cardiovascular risk in those treated with SGLT2
inhibitors (Central Illustration). To the extent that it is
unclear whether benefits seen in the EMPA-REG

 OUTCOME study could be expected from treatment
with all SGLT2 inhibitors, our results provide novel
data regarding possible cardiovascular benefits from
canagliflozin treatment.
Numerous theories have emerged to explain how
SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce cardiovascular risk;
however, no consensus exists as to the mechanism of
such risk reduction. The early divergence of survival
curves seen in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study sug-
gests an acute effect in particular on heart failure
outcomes (4). It has been proposed that sodium and
fluid loss, reduction in BP and body weight, attenu-
ation of inflammation and oxidative stress, improve-
ment in arterial stiffness, as well as preservation of
renal function may contribute to the observed cardiac
benefits (7,10,11,23). Interest has also focused on
metabolic
effects
in
the
myocardium,
including
changes in glucagon handling, mitigation of gluco-
toxicity, and shift to fatty acid metabolism, as well as
attenuation of cardiac remodeling (5–9,11). Treatment
with SGLT2 inhibitors has been shown to increase
levels of ketone bodies, which may be a more favor-
able energetic substrate for the heart compared with
glucose or fatty acids (5,6). Additionally, SGLT2 in-
hibitors may inhibit the sodium-hydrogen exchanger,
leading to reduction of intracellular sodium and
calcium
in
a
cariporide-dependent
fashion
(24),
which may foster a cardioprotective effect. Finally, in
a basic science model of heart failure, empagliflozin
treatment or knockdown of the SLC5A2 gene (simu-
lating SGLT2 inhibition) created a phenotype with
improved cardiac function and reduced BNP expres-
sion (25). Our biomarker results help to further the
understanding of how SGLT2 inhibition might exert a
favorable impact on cardiovascular events.
We lack data on biomarker concentrations during
the first 26 weeks of treatment with canagliflozin,
making
it
impossible
to
determine
whether
the
biomarker changes observed in this analysis are
somewhat related to diuretic effects from SGLT2 in-
hibition; studies suggest there is a 10% reduction in
plasma volume after 1 week of treatment with cana-
gliflozin, but the plasma volume nearly returns to
baseline by week 12 (26). An alternative or linked
possibility is to consider that our findings indicate
prevention of rise in NT-proBNP or hsTnI.
Biomarker measurements may help inform the
mechanism of benefit in patients treated with novel
therapies (13), with change over time frequently
imparting
greater
prognostic
information
than
a
single measurement or knowledge of absolute con-
centration. Our results represent the first larger-scale,

Through its beneficial effects on the heart, canagliflozin prevented a rise in N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI).
Possibly through transient reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), galectin-3 increased modestly. Na/H ¼ sodium/proton; SGLT2 ¼ sodium glucose
co-transporter 2.

 placebo-controlled data regarding cardiac biomarkers
in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibition. In a recent
study of 66 patients treated with empagliflozin, but
without placebo control, serum NT-proBNP concen-
trations were unchanged after 4 weeks in patients
with or without T2DM (16). In another small study of
75 patients with T2DM randomized to dapagliflozin,
hydrochlorothiazide, or placebo, no differences in
NT-proBNP were seen over 12 weeks of follow-up (17).
Thus, our results, gathered in much larger numbers
and for a much longer period of time, substantially
extend the understanding of how novel drugs for
T2DM may exert favorable cardiovascular effects.
Concentrations of each biomarker measured in
this exploratory analysis are consistent with those
expected for an older patient study group with
at least a moderate risk for cardiovascular events (27).
Furthermore,
over
time,
placebo-treated
patients
demonstrated
increases
in
both
NT-proBNP
and
hsTnI; such changes, though modest, may be indica-
tive
of
increasing
risk
for
cardiovascular
events
and heart failure (14,27). Our findings indicate that
treatment with canagliflozin was associated with a
blunting of the rise in NT-proBNP and hsTnI over
time. Taken together, these results are compatible
with the early and sustained cardiovascular benefits
seen in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study.
Baseline sST2 concentrations in our study partici-
pants indicate a generally higher-risk patient popu-
lation, with a median value near the 90th percentile
for a normal healthy population (28). We did not
observe any effect on sST2 concentrations with can-
agliflozin. In contrast, relatively smaller, but signifi-
cant
increases
in
galectin-3
concentrations
were
observed at 26 and 52 weeks in patients treated with
canagliflozin; by 104 weeks, galectin-3 concentrations
were still numerically, but not significantly, higher in
the canagliflozin arm. Renal function is a known
confounder of galectin-3, and canagliflozin treatment
is associated with initial reductions in eGFR that
trend back toward baseline with continued treatment
(29). Indeed, modest reductions in eGFR paralleled
the increase in galectin-3, and there was a correlation
between change in galectin-3 and change in eGFR
over time: thus, change in renal function may account
for the declining between-group difference across
time points. It is unknown whether a small early in-
crease in galectin-3 with canagliflozin is clinically
relevant.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Though the current results are
the first larger-scale, placebo-controlled assessment
of multiple cardiovascular biomarkers in patients
with T2DM treated with canagliflozin, there are a few
limitations of this study. First, not all patients had
samples at every time point; however, a sensitivity
analysis using data from patients with samples at
all 3 time points showed consistent results. Also,
exclusion of patients with eGFR <50 ml/min/1.73 m2
might render our data less generalizable to those
with worse renal function; this exclusion criterion
was due to use of metformin in an older patient
population. However, this minimizes confounding
effects
of
worse
renal
function
on
biomarker
concentrations. Differences in the concentrations of
NT-proBNP
and
hsTnI
between
placebo-
and
canagliflozin-treated patients were relatively modest.
However, small changes in both biomarkers may be
substantially
prognostic,
and
consistency
across
multiple time points suggests that these changes for
NT-proBNP and hsTnI are more likely to be robust.
Lastly, we
lack
data on other
novel biomarkers
with prognostic value such as mid-regional pro-
adrenomedullin or growth differentiation factor-15.
Larger studies should confirm our findings, and,
ideally, future outcomes trials should examine links
between biomarker changes and long-term cardio-
vascular disease outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that canagliflozin treatment was
associated with attenuation of biomarkers associated
with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in this study
population of older patients with T2DM. As it is
difficult to know for sure whether the benefits seen in
the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study related to treatment
with empagliflozin can be extrapolated to treatment
with canagliflozin, our results are important, and
might predict similar risk reduction from canagli-
flozin treatment. Results from the CANVAS Program,
including
CANVAS
(CANagliflozin
cardioVascular
Assessment Study [NCT01032629]) and CANVAS-R
(CANagliflozin
cardioVascular
Assessment
Study-
Renal [NCT01989754]), provide direct evidence on the
effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes in
patients with a history or high risk of cardiovascular
disease (30–33).

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Elevated
levels of NT-proBNP and hsTnI are associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular events, including heart
failure and mortality, in older patients with T2DM. SGLT2
inhibitors reduce NT-proBNP and hsTnI concentrations
and lower cardiovascular risk in these patients.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are
needed to understand the mechanisms by which
SGLT2 inhibitors ameliorate myocardial stress and
prevent necrosis in patients with T2DM and to clarify
how biomarkers can be optimally utilized to guide
therapy.
