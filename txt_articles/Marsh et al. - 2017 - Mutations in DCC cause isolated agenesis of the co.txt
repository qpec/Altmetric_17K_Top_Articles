Abstract
Brain malformations involving the corpus callosum are common in children with developmental 
disabilities. We identified DCC mutations in four families and five sporadic individuals with 
isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) without intellectual disability. DCC mutations 
result in variable dominant phenotypes with decreased penetrance, including mirror movements 
and ACC associated with a favorable developmental prognosis. Possible phenotypic modifiers 
include the type and location of mutation and the sex of the individual.
The corpus callosum, the main cerebral commissure in placental mammals, has a key role in 
communication between the brain hemispheres1. Formation of the corpus callosum is a 
complex process involving ligands, such as those in the Netrin, Ephrin, Semaphorin and Slit 
families, and their receptors2. ACC is the complete or partial absence of the corpus 
callosum. This frequent brain malformation affects approximately 1 in 4,000 newborns and 
3–5% of children with intellectual disability (ID)3,4 and is a common cause of late-
pregnancy termination5. Mutations in many genes cause syndromes with ID and ACC, 
whereas the genetics of isolated ACC remain poorly understood3,6,7. The Netrin receptor 
Dcc plays a critical role in corpus callosum development in mice by guiding callosal axons 
at the midline8. Whereas mutations in DCC have been associated with congenital mirror 
movements (MMs) in humans9, they have not been described in individuals with ACC.

 We investigated four multigenerational families with individuals presenting with ACC, MMs 
or both phenotypes segregating as autosomal-dominant traits (Fig. 1a). Neuroimaging and 
clinical studies confirmed that complete or partial ACC was isolated in most cases (Fig. 1b 
and Supplementary Fig. 1) and was associated with a range of intellectual abilities (normal 
to borderline impaired); additionally, specific cognitive impairments, including language 
delay or visuospatial deficits, were documented (Supplementary Table 1). Diffusion MRI 
tractography-based probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution identified decreased 
crossing of descending corticospinal tract projections at the pyramidal decussation in all 
affected individuals in families 2 and 4 with either ACC and MMs (n = 5) or MMs only (n = 
2) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). The tractography results for other commissural fibers, 
including the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles, anterior commissure, 
posterior commissure and optic chiasm, were comparable between the affected individuals 
and controls.
Linkage analysis and exome sequencing of three affected individuals in family 1 identified 
two shared candidate variants in the 16 linkage regions (Supplementary Fig. 3 and 
Supplementary Table 2), including a truncating mutation in DCC (NM_005215.3: c.
925delA, p.Thr309ProfsTer26). For family 2, 48 candidate variants were identified in 28 
linkage regions (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3), including a missense 
variant (c.2378T>G, p.Val793Gly) in DCC. The previously reported nonsense mutation (c.
823C>T, p.Arg275Ter) in DCC segregated with MMs in five individuals of family 3 (ref. 
10). Further investigation identified two additional female mutation carriers with ACC and a 
male carrier with MMs who had a thin rostrum. Direct screening in family 4 identified a 
heterozygous DCC missense variant (c.2414G>A, p.Gly805Glu). All four DCC mutations 
were absent from public databases, including the 1000 Genomes and Exome Aggregation 
Consortium (ExAC) databases, and segregated with ACC and/or MMs in all available 
individuals tested (Fig. 1a). In addition, we sequenced DCC in 70 unrelated individuals with 
ACC, including 46 with normal cognitive development. Five individuals, all with isolated 
complete ACC, had at least one heterozygous missense variant altering a conserved amino 
acid of DCC (Fig. 1d, Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 5). Analysis of all available 
imaging in mutation-positive individuals with complete ACC also showed absence of the 
hippocampal commissure and cingulate gyri, and dysmorphic lateral ventricles (usually 
colpocephaly), as would be expected (details in Online Methods). Apart from these 
observations, no consistent additional brain malformations were seen.
We analyzed the phenotypes of individuals with DCC mutations reported in the literature 
and in this study (Supplementary Table 4) to assess the penetrance of MMs and ACC. Of the 
88 individuals with DCC mutations identified to date, 50 had MMs; among the 39 who had 
brain imaging, 19 exhibited ACC. After exclusion of the index individuals from the analysis, 
the penetrance of MMs was estimated to be 42%, and the penetrance of ACC was estimated 
to be 26% (Supplementary Table 5). Overall, males (n = 31) exhibited MMs more frequently 
than females (n = 19, male/female ratio = 1.8, P = 0.0027, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test; 
Supplementary Table 5), whereas in individuals with truncating DCC variants, ACC was 
more often present in females (n = 7) than males (n = 1, male/female ratio = 0.2). Sex 
differences in corpus callosum anatomy have been associated with testosterone levels during 
prenatal brain development11–13; therefore, we tested the effect of androgens on DCC

 expression. Independent analysis by RNA-seq and RT–qPCR demonstrated a significant 
dose-dependent increase in DCC expression in human neural stem cells treated with 10 nM 
or 100 nM testosterone (Supplementary Fig. 6). Because variants introducing a premature 
stop codon generally result in haploinsufficiency, owing to nonsense-mediated decay of the 
mutant mRNA, it is possible that ACC may occur when the amount of DCC mRNA (and 
DCC protein) falls below a threshold level during corpus callosum development, as would 
occur more frequently in females. However, given the incomplete penetrance observed in 
both sexes, the phenotypic outcome must also be influenced by additional genetic, 
epigenetic and/or environmental factors. Interestingly, families 1 and 3, in which a majority 
of females displayed ACC, are both of North African background, thus supporting the 
hypothesis of genetic modifiers.
In contrast to truncating variants, missense-mutant proteins are usually present in the cell 
and can interfere with the function of the wild-type protein, thus potentially resulting in 
differing phenotypes compared with those associated with haploinsufficiency of the same 
protein. Binding of Netrin-1 to DCC results in intracellular homodimerization or 
heterodimerization with UNC5, another axon-guidance receptor, and is critical for both the 
chemoattractive and chemorepulsive properties of the signaling complexes14,15. The 
Netrin-1-binding region involves the fourth, fifth and sixth fibronectin type III–like domains 
of DCC14,16; therefore, amino acid substitutions in this binding region may compromise 
DCC function. Five of the eight DCC missense variants identified in individuals with ACC 
are located in the Netrin-1-binding region (Fig. 1d), thus representing a considerable 
enrichment compared with missense variants located in this domain in ExAC (5/74, 6.7% 
versus 519/~60,000, 0.86%; P = 5 × 10−4 (all rare variants) or 284/~60,000, 0.47%; P = 3 × 
10−5 (rare variants predicted to be damaging by the SIFT (sorting intolerant from tolerant) 
program, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test; Supplementary Table 6). Given the decreased 
penetrance and mild phenotype of DCC-related ACC, it is possible that some individuals 
described in ExAC have pathogenic DCC mutations and undiagnosed ACC.
Modeling of DCC missense variants showed that the amino acid substitutions in families 2 
and 4, both located within the DCC/Netrin-1 binding interface, are predicted to be most 
disruptive. The p.Val793Gly substitution abolishes a hydrophobic interaction with Thr147 of 
Netrin-1, whereas p.Gly805Glu introduces a highly unfavorable charged moiety within a 
hydrophobic pocket, thus disrupting interaction with Leu113 of Netrin-1 (Supplementary 
Figs. 7 and 8). The predicted effects of the three substitutions within the Netrin-1-binding 
region but outside the binding interface (Supplementary Figs. 9–12) are consistent with 
results from in vitro studies demonstrating that even conservative mutations to residues in 
this binding region can disrupt DCC dimerization, Netrin-1 binding and axon guidance16.
In addition to the effects of sex hormones and the type and location of DCC mutations, 
developmental differences between the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract may also 
contribute to the variable ACC and MM phenotypes. Callosal and subcerebrally projecting 
pyramidal neurons of the cortex are specified at early stages of development, and the 
molecular identity of each population directly affects its axonal connectivity15. Whereas 
corticospinal axons use DCC and Netrin-1 signaling to reach the midline, callosal axons use 
DCC and Netrin-1 chemoattraction to attenuate ROBO1- and SLIT2-mediated

 chemorepulsion to approach and cross the midline17. Therefore, a DCC mutation may 
differentially affect commissural versus subcerebral axon trajectories, thus leading to ACC, 
MMs or both. MMs were consistently associated with decreased crossing of descending 
corticospinal tract projections at the pyramidal decussation in this study as well as in 
individuals with RAD51-related MMs18, thus suggesting that DCC-mediated MMs are 
primarily the result of corticospinal tract decussation abnormalities.
In conclusion, our results provide compelling evidence that DCC mutations cause isolated 
ACC in humans, in addition to the previously reported MM phenotype. The factors 
determining the phenotypic variability are complex and probably include the hormonal 
context during development, the type and location of DCC mutation and the genetic 
background of the individual. Although the spectrum of phenotypes associated with DCC 
mutations remains to be fully characterized, individuals described in this study have an 
intellectual quotient within the normal-to-borderline range. Heterozygous mutations in DCC 
therefore appear to result in isolated ACC with a mild phenotype and favorable cognitive 
outcomes, in contrast with the unfavorable developmental outcomes associated with 
syndromic ACC. Given the high frequency of DCC mutations detected in our cohorts, this 
observation has prenatal diagnostic and parental counseling implications for fetuses with 
ACC, because the condition currently has unclear prognosis. Our data suggest that the 
prenatal detection of isolated ACC related to a pathogenic DCC mutation indicates a lower 
risk of an abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome.

 associated imaging reports for DCC-positive individuals were reviewed by a 
neuroradiologist (S.A.M.) and neurologist (R.J.L.), both of whom have extensive experience 
in imaging features of human brain malformations. The brain MRI scans were reviewed in a 
single session during which consensus was reached. The scans of 18 mutation-positive 
individuals from families 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 were reviewed, including 12 with complete or 
partial ACC, and six with an intact corpus callosum. The imaging was from a mix of studies, 
including 1.5T and 3T MRI, and one individual had a CT only. All available sequences were 
reviewed, which, for the majority, included axial, coronal and sagittal T1 and T2 sequences 
at a minimum. The scans were reviewed systematically to include an assessment of the 
corpus callosum, commissures (anterior, posterior and hippocampal), cerebral cortex, white 
matter, ventricles, hippocampi, cortex, basal ganglia, cerebral and cerebellar peduncles, optic 
chiasm, brainstem, cerebellar vermis and hemispheres, and pituitary gland. All patients with 
complete ACC also had absence of the hippocampal commissure, cingulate gyri and 
dysmorphic lateral ventricles (usually colpocephaly), as expected. Apart from these 
observations, no consistent additional brain malformations were seen.
A systematic neurological exam was performed to assess MMs in these individuals. Specific 
neuropsychological data or a clinical diagnosis regarding the presence or absence of 
intellectual disability were available in all affected individuals from families 1 to 4 and 
probands 5 to 9. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood cells through standard procedures. 
The reference sequences for DCC used were NM_005215.3 (human) and protein sequences 
NP_005206.2 (human), P43146 (human) and P70211 (mouse).
Family 1 originated from North Africa and comprises five female individuals, three with 
complete ACC and two with partial ACC. One of the females with partial ACC also has 
MMs. The proband and her sister have complete ACC, which was fortuitously detected by 
brain MRI after workup for headaches. Isolated complete or partial ACC was later detected 
in the female fetuses by ultrasound during pregnancy. Individuals with ACC in this family 
had mild learning difficulties in school, especially in language and mathematics, but their 
intelligence is within normal range.
Family 2 is an Australian family of European ancestry, including four male children from a 
nonconsanguineous marriage. The mother and three of the four offspring have isolated 
complete ACC and mild clinical sequelae, including MMs, and, according to test results, the 
three children have global behavioral/academic impairments and low-average-to-borderline 
intellectual functioning. In their early years, they attended mainstream schooling.
The clinical features of family 3, also originating from North Africa and comprising five 
individuals presenting with MMs, have previously been reported10. Reassessment of this 
family included a neurological examination and brain imaging in additional family members 
and identified partial ACC in the female index subject, who also had mild MMs, complete 
ACC in a female without MMs, and a thin rostrum in a male carrier with MMs (pedigree in 
Fig. 1a). ACC in the two female individuals was detected prenatally but was previously 
considered to be a phenotype independent of MMs before this study.

 Family 4 is a three-generation nonconsanguineous Australian kindred of European ancestry. 
The mother and both offspring have MMs, and the son has additional features of isolated 
partial ACC (absence of rostrum, genu and anterior body), language disorder, poor memory, 
ataxic-type tremors and borderline intellectual impairment.
Notably, ACC appeared to be more frequent in recent generations, possibly because of an 
ascertainment bias.
We collected the DNA of 46 individuals with complete or partial ACC but no intellectual 
disability, who were recruited in the Trousseau and La Pitié-Salpêtrière hospitals (Paris, 
France) or different French centers. Twenty-six of these individuals had a normal array-CGH 
analysis, and six were screened through next-generation sequencing for mutations in 423 
selected genes involved in ACC in humans or mice (Callosome target enrichment panel, 
performed at the Necker Hospital), but no obvious genetic abnormalities were identified. 
The remaining 20 patients had no genetic analysis before DCC screening. An additional 24 
probands with ACC were recruited from the Royal Children’s Hospital (Melbourne, 
Australia), McGill University and UCSF; the majority had not had genetic analysis 
performed before this study.
Probands 5, 7 and 8 have isolated complete ACC that was detected prenatally by ultrasound 
and was further confirmed by brain MRI; proband 6 has isolated complete ACC that was 
fortuitously detected by brain MRI after a workup for migraine (Supplementary Fig. 1). All 
probands as well as the affected sister of proband 7 have normal intellectual and social 
abilities, although probands 5 and 7, respectively, showed language and learning difficulties 
in school. Proband 9 has ADHD plus social and executive-function deficits. Brain MRI 
confirmed complete ACC. Additional features, which have occasionally been described in 
association with callosal agenesis, included an interhemispheric cyst, complex gray-matter 
heterotopia in the periventricular regions, nodular periventricular gray-matter heterotopia in 
both temporal horns and malrotated, dysmorphic hippocampi (Supplementary Fig. 1). The 
mother is an unaffected carrier who was confirmed to have a normal corpus callosum via 
brain MRI and who has no learning, cognitive or intellectual deficits.
Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography
Diffusion MRI data for families 2 and 4 were collected on Siemens Magnetom Trio 3T 
scanners at the Royal Children’s Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) and the Queensland Brain 
Institute (Brisbane, Australia), respectively, by using identical sequence parameters (b value, 
3,000 s/mm2; repetition time (TR), 8,200 ms; echo time (TE), 112 ms; voxel size, 2.3 × 2.3 
× 2.3 mm3, with 60 diffusion-encoding directions and seven b = 0 s/mm2 volumes). High-
resolution 3D T1-weighted MR images were also acquired for family 2 (Royal Children’s 
Hospital, Magnetom Trio 3T, voxel size, 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 mm3; TR, 2,530 m; multiecho TE, 
7.2, 5.32, 3.51 and 1.77 ms) and family 4 (Queensland Brain Institute, Magnetom 7T, voxel 
size, 0.75 × 0.75 × 0.75 mm3; TR, 5,000 ms; TE, 3.4 ms). Motion and eddy current 
correction was performed with the FMRIB Software Library (FSL v5)19. Reversed phase-
encode blips were acquired for individuals scanned in Melbourne, and inhomogeneity 
distortion correction was performed20,21. Diffusion-weighted images were upsampled by a 
factor of 2, the brain was extracted, and fiber orientation distribution was estimated with

 MRtrix3 through constrained spherical deconvolution22–24 with default processing 
parameters (maximum harmonic order lmax = 8). Fractional anisotropy and color fractional 
anisotropy maps were generated with FSL v5. For medullary pyramid tractography, four 
bilateral ROIs were specified for each individual at the base of the pons, upper medulla, 
lower medulla, and lateral funiculus (Supplementary Fig. 2); in addition, a midline ROI was 
specified at the pyramidal decussation. Ipsilateral projections were found by specifying the 
ipsilateral funiculus and midline decussation ROIs as inclusion and exclusion ROIs, 
respectively. Contralateral projections were found by specifying the contralateral funiculus 
and ipislateral medullary ROIs as inclusion ROIs. Streamlines were seeded from the ROIs 
for the ipsilateral and contralateral base of pons (relative to the lateral funiculus) for 
uncrossed and crossed projections, respectively. All tractography was performed with the 
iFOD2 algorithm in Mrtrix3 with the following parameters: step size, 0.115 mm; curvature, 
90°; maximum number of streamlines, 100,000; FOD cutoff, 0.2. A laterality coefficient was 
generated for the corticospinal tract of each individual by calculating the ratio of the 
difference between the number of crossed and uncrossed streamlines to the total number of 
streamlines. That is, laterality coefficient = (contralateral streamlines − ipsilateral 
streamlines)/(contralateral streamlines + ipsilateral streamlines). Right and left coefficients 
were averaged to determine the laterality coefficient of each individual. Group analysis 
between each family and controls (n = 6, three individuals scanned at each site) was based 
on two-tailed Mann–Whitney U tests, and P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing
Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed on 13 members (five symptomatic 
individuals, three obligate carriers, three at-risk individuals and two spouses) of family 1 by 
using OmniExpress-24 microarrays (Illumina). Illumina microarray experiments were 
performed according to the automated manufacturer’s protocol. Multipoint LOD scores on 
autosomes were calculated with Merlin 1.0 (affected-only analysis, autosomal-dominant 
trait; disease-allele frequency, 0.0001; phenocopy rate, 0.0001). Multipoint LOD scores on 
chromosome X were calculated with the same parameters with minx (Supplementary Fig. 
3).
Exome sequencing was performed for three members of family 1 (IV-1, IV-2 and IV-3) at 
the genotyping and sequencing facility of ICM. Exons were captured from fragmented 
genomic-DNA samples with the SeqCap EZ Exome v3 enrichment protocol (Roche), and 
paired-end 75-base massively parallel sequencing was carried out on an Illumina 
NextSeq500 platform, according to the manufacturers’ protocols. Bioinformatics analyses 
were performed with an in-house pipeline developed by the bioinformatics and biostatistics 
core facility of ICM (iCONICS), as follows: sequencing reads passing quality filtering were 
aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) with Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA)25, 
and GATK26 was used to recalibrate base quality scores, realign around indels and mark 
duplicate reads. Variant filtering was performed with Polyweb (University Paris-Descartes) 
with the following criteria: (i) variant present in the heterozygous state in the three members 
of family 1; (ii) variant present in a positive linkage region; (iii) variant altering the coding 
sequence (nonsense, missense, frameshift or essential splice-site variants); (iv) variant with a 
minor-allele frequency (MAF) <1% in the 1000 Genomes, HapMap and ExAC databases;

 (v) variant present in fewer than two individuals in a local database. Two variants met these 
criteria (Supplementary Table 2). Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the DCC 
variant in all affected family members and several nonmanifesting carriers.
For family 2, WES and linkage analysis was performed on all four affected individuals (II-1, 
III-1, III-2 and III-3), essentially as previously described27. Exons were captured from 
fragmented genomic-DNA samples with the SureSelect Human All Exon, V5+UTRs 
(Agilent), and sequencing was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility with 
100-base paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Reads were aligned to the 
reference human genome (GRch37/hg19) with Novoalign. Variants were called with 
SAMtools 0.1.17 and annotated with ANNOVAR. Genotypes were extracted and processed 
with LINKDATAGEN. Parametric multipoint linkage analysis was subsequently performed 
with MERLIN, specifying a rare dominant disease model (Supplementary Fig. 4). The 
candidate list was filtered to retain rare variants predicted to alter the coding sequence or 
mRNA splicing (minor-allele frequency <0.01) within the linkage regions with public 
databases and an in-house database of 132 unrelated exomes (Supplementary Table 3). 
Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the DCC variant in all affected family 
members. Familial segregation testing also identified the DCC variant in two unaffected 
family members (both in DNA derived from peripheral blood and buccal cells), one of 
whom (I-2) was confirmed through MRI to have a normal corpus callosum.
Amplification and sequencing of the DCC coding region
The entire coding region of the DCC gene (NM_005215.3) was amplified by PCR, as 
previously described28. Purified PCR products were sequenced in both directions with a Big 
Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Sanger 
sequencing was performed on an ABI 3730×l sequencer by GATC Biotech (Constance, 
Germany), and the sequences were analyzed with SeqScape 2.1 (Applied Biosystems).
Brain malformations gene panel
A custom in-house next-generation-sequencing gene panel targeting 287 genes (including 
DCC) associated with brain malformations was developed with the HaloPlexHS target 
enrichment system (Agilent Technology). We used 50 ng of gDNA to prepare the 
sequencing library according to the manufacturer’s instructions and performed 2 × 150-bp 
paired-end sequencing to a median depth of 400× on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). The 
raw data files (fastq.gz) were analyzed with SureCall software (Agilent Technology). Sanger 
sequencing confirmed the presence of the mutation and segregation.
Interpretation of genetic variants
Missense variants were assessed in silico for possible pathogenicity with Alamut 2.3 
(Biointeractive Software), PolyPhen-2 and SIFT. Orthologous sequences of human DCC 
(NP_005206) were retrieved from UniProt and aligned with Clustal Omega (see URLs).
Effect of testosterone treatment on DCC expression
Human neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from the embryonic stem-cell line (ESC, SA001, 
46XY, Cellartis) were obtained from I-Stem. Stability of the hNSCs was monitored by

 karyotype analysis at I-Stem. Morphology, SOX2 expression and the ability to differentiate 
into neurons was verified before the experiments were performed. hNSCs were cultured in 
depleted medium (phenol red–free medium without N2B27) for 48 h before androgen 
treatments. The cells were then treated with DMSO, 10 nM testosterone or 100 nM 
testosterone for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from treated cells with TRI reagent 
(Molecular Research Center), treated with 1 U/μg DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37 °C and 
then purified with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Biological triplicates of treated versus 
control (DMSO) conditions were compared in RNA-seq experiments. RNA sequencing was 
performed at the IGBMC Microarray and Sequencing platform (Strasbourg, France). DNA 
libraries were generated with a TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 kit (Illumina). 
Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument as single-end 50-base 
reads. Image analysis and base calling were performed with RTA 1.18.61 and CASAVA 
1.8.2. DCC mRNA levels were further quantified in three independent experiments, each 
composed of at least four well replicates (first experiment, DMSO, n = 6; all other 
conditions, n = 4), by RT–qPCR with two different primer pairs in DCC and two different 
control genes: PPIA29 and GAPDH (Supplementary Table 7). Reverse transcription was 
performed from 500 ng of total RNA with random hexamers and SuperScript II reverse 
transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RT–qPCR was 
performed on a LightCycler 480 II instrument (Roche) with QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR 
Master Mix (Qiagen), in triplicates. The relative expression of DCC versus GAPDH or PPIA 
was calculated with the 2−(ΔΔ Ct) method.
Protein modeling analyses
Proteins were modeled with the web-based flexible backbone modeling program 
RosettaBackrub30. Substitutions within the DCC FN4 and FN5 domains were modeled with 
the previously determined crystal structures of the DCC–netrin-1 complex (PDB 4PLO and 
4URT)14,16. The p.Arg597Pro substitution was modeled with the solution structure for the 
DCC FN2 domain (PDB 2ED8). Models were visualized with PyMOL and Chimera31. 
Electrostatic surface potentials were calculated with PDB2PQR32 and Adaptive Poisson-
Boltzmann Solver (APBS)33. Interacting residues within the binding interface of various 
DCC–netrin-1 complexes were identified with the program LIGPLOT+ (v1.4)34. The 
evolutionary conservation of amino acid residues on the basis of phylogenetic relations 
between homologous sequences was determined with the bioinformatics tool ConSurf35.
Statistical analyses
Frequencies of rare variants in patients were compared with two-tailed Fisher’s exact tests. 
The relative expression of DCC versus GAPDH or PPIA was compared with parametric 
two-tailed Student’s t-tests. Laterality coefficients were compared between affected families 
(four individuals from family 2 and three individuals from family 4) and controls (six 
individuals) with two-tailed Mann–Whitney U tests.
Data availability
Families included in this study have not consented to have next-generation sequence data 
publicly released. Variants identified in this study have been deposited in ClinVar under 
accession numbers SCV000485052–SCV000485060.

 rostrum and genu). Con, control. (c) Groupwise comparison of laterality coefficients in both 
families (family 2, n = 4; family 4, n = 3) were compared with controls (n = 6). For each 
individual, a laterality coefficient for the corticospinal tract was calculated as the ratio of the 
difference between the numbers of crossed and uncrossed streamlines to the total number of 
streamlines. Right and left coefficients were averaged to determine the laterality coefficient 
of each individual. Greater positive values indicate more crossed streamlines, and negative 
values indicate more uncrossed streamlines (mean ± s.d, *P = 0.0238; **P = 0.0095 by two-
tailed Mann–Whitney U test). (d) Protein domain structure depicting the location of the 
DCC truncation (red square and triangle) and missense mutations (colored dots). The
