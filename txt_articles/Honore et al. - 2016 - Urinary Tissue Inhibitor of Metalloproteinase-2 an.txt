admission. To investigate the effect of nonrenal organ dysfunction 
on tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth 
factor-binding protein 7 in this population.
Method: In this ancillary analysis, we included patients with sepsis 
who were enrolled in either of two trials including 39 ICUs across 
Europe and North America. The primary endpoint was moderate-
severe acute kidney injury (equivalent to Kidney Disease Improv-
ing Global Outcome stage 2–3) within 12 hours of enrollment. 
We assessed biomarker performance by calculating the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, spec-
ificity, and negative and positive predictive values at three cutoffs: 
0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 (ng/mL)2/1,000. We also calculated nonrenal 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores for each patient on 
enrollment and compared tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 
and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 results in patients 
with and without acute kidney injury and across nonrenal Sequen-
tial Organ Failure Assessment scores. Finally, we constructed a 
clinical model for acute kidney injury in this population and com-
pared the performance of the model with and without tissue inhibi-
tor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding 
protein 7.
Results: We included 232 patients in the analysis and 40 (17%) 
developed acute kidney injury. We observed significantly higher 
urine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like 
growth factor-binding protein 7 in patients with acute kidney 
injury than without acute kidney injury in both patients with low 
and high nonrenal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores 
(p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteris-
tic curve (95% CI) of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and 
insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 was 0.84 (0.73–0.92) 
and 0.85 (0.76–0.94), in low and high nonrenal Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment score subgroups. Performance of the tissue 
inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-
binding protein 7 test was not modified by nonrenal Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment (p = 0.70). In multivariate analysis, the 
addition of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like 
growth factor-binding protein 7 significantly improved the per-
formance of a clinical model for predicting acute kidney injury 
 
(p = 0.015).
Conclusion: Urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and 
insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 accurately predicts 
acute kidney injury in septic patients with or without other organ 
failures. (Crit Care Med ; 44:1851–1860)

A
cute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most com-
mon complications of sepsis and is associated with an 
increased ICU and hospital mortality (1–7). The ben-
efit of preventive and therapeutic measures for AKI has been 
difficult to confirm because treatments are often initiated when 
renal injury is already established (8, 9). Perhaps as a result, the 
prognosis for sepsis patients with AKI remains poor.
Biomarkers for AKI might allow for earlier initiation 
or more tailored application of renal protection measures 
and avoidance of iatrogenic harm (10, 11). Two novel uri-
nary biomarkers, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 
(TIMP-2), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 
(IGFBP7) have been validated for predicting moderate and 
severe AKI (classified as AKI stage 2 and 3 according to the 
Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome [KDIGO] 2012 
classification) (12) in critically ill patients. Both TIMP-2 and 
IGFBP7 are markers of cellular stress in the early phase of 
tubular cell injury caused by a wide variety of insults (inflam-
mation, ischemia, oxidative stress, drugs, and toxins) (13–16). 
Furthermore, both molecules can initiate G1 cell-cycle arrest 
that prevents cells from dividing when potentially injured 
(17). Importantly, both biomarkers also act as “alarm” pro-
teins exerting paracrine effects on adjacent cells (18). The 
product of these two biomarkers ([TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]) out-
performed all other known biomarkers or biomarker combi-
nations for predicting moderate-severe AKI (19), and the test 
has been validated using a clinical adjudication committee 
as a gold-standard for AKI (20). Finally, [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
measurement proved to be a highly sensitive predictor of AKI 
in cardiac surgery patients (21).
Importantly, performance of novel biomarkers for AKI can 
suffer in patients with sepsis presumably because many of the 
pathologic processes of sepsis can affect biomarkers even with-
out injuring the kidney (22). Furthermore, because the mech-
anisms of organ injury in sepsis may not be specific for the 
kidney, nonrenal organ failures could mimic AKI (23). Thus, 
we sought to evaluate the performance of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
in patients with sepsis, with or without nonrenal organ fail-
ures. We assessed this biomarker combination in a subset of 
patients with early sepsis from the Sapphire (19) and Topaz 
(20) prospective clinical trials using cutoff values of greater 
than 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 (ng/mL)2/1,000 (24). At the time of bio-
marker measurement and adjusting for common sepsis risk 
factors, we evaluated test performance in conjunction with 
bedside clinical parameters.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a preplanned subgroup analysis of critically ill 
patients enrolled in either of our two previously reported stud-
ies on the discovery/validation (Sapphire) (19) and subsequent 
secondary validation (Topaz) (20) of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]. We 
defined sepsis based on international consensus criteria and the 
clinical diagnosis assigned by the treating physicians at enroll-
ing sites (25). All patients were considered to be at high risk 
for AKI, characterized by respiratory or cardiovascular dys-
function as previously reported (Fig. 1) (19, 20). The design, 
execution, and reporting of this study meet the Strengthening 
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (26) 
and the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy cri-
teria (27). Data were collected by the investigators and ana-
lyzed by independent statisticians not directly affiliated with

the study. Both study protocols were approved by the Western 
Institutional Review Board (Olympia, Washington, DC) and 
also by the institutional review board or ethics committee of 
each study site if required. All patients (or authorized repre-
sentatives) provided written informed consent. In this article, 
we present data from the Sapphire study, which defined AKI as 
KDIGO stage 2–3 (12), and from the Topaz study, which used 
clinical adjudication for AKI (20), in order to examine the per-
formance of the [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] test for risk assessment of 
AKI in patients with sepsis.
Measurements
Urine and serum samples for biomarker and creatinine assess-
ment, respectively, were obtained within 24 hours of ICU 
admission. TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 concentrations were measured 
by immunoassay with the NephroCheck Test on the Asute140 
Meter (Astute Medical, San Diego, CA) by technicians blinded 
to clinical data. Measurements of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 were 
made at Astute Medical for the Sapphire study and in triplicate 
at three independent laboratories (University of California at 
San Diego, CA; University of Louisville, KY; and ARUP Labora-
tories in Salt Lake City, UT) for the Topaz study. The median of 
the triplicate values from Topaz was used for analysis, and val-
ues were reported in units of (ng/mL)2/1,000. Serum creatinine 
testing was performed as pre-
viously described (19, 20).
We assessed severity of 
illness and organ dysfunc-
tion/failure with the Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health 
Evaluation (APACHE) III (28) 
and Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment 
(SOFA) 
(29) 
scores. Nonrenal APACHE III 
and SOFA scores were calcu-
lated by subtracting the renal 
components from these scores.
Statistical Methods
To assess the performance of 
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in pre-
dicting AKI, we calculated area 
under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), 
sensitivity, specificity, negative 
and positive predictive values 
(NPV and PPV), and relative 
risk (RR). The Delong method 
was used to estimate the 95% 
CI for AUC. Bootstrap method 
was used to estimate the 95% 
CI for sensitivity, specificity, 
NPV, and PPV, except for the 
cases where there were empty 
cells and the Clopper-Pearson 
Exact method was used instead. 
RR was calculated at each [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] stratum relative 
to the lowest stratum. The 95% CI for RR was calculated using 
bootstrap method except when there were empty cells, and an 
exact unconditional method was used instead (30).
To examine the effect of nonrenal organ dysfunction and 
AKI on the levels of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7], we performed a mul-
tiple linear regression analysis where the response variable was 
rank transformed [TIMP2]·[IGFBP7]; the explanatory vari-
ables were AKI status, subgroup status according to the median 
of nonrenal SOFA scores, and the interaction between them. 
The same analysis was also performed for each individual non-
renal SOFA component.
To assess the added value of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in predict-
ing AKI over using clinical variables alone, we constructed two 
multivariable logistic regression models: one with only clinical 
variables as explanatory variables and the other with the addi-
tion of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] as an explanatory variable besides 
clinical variables. A backward stepwise regression procedure 
with Bayesian Information Criteria was used to select which 
clinical variables to be included the final models. Model good-
ness-of-fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow method. 
To quantify the added predictive ability of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7], 
we calculated integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) 
and category-free net reclassification improvement (cfNRI)

(KDIGO) AKI stage 2 or 3 (Sapphire) (19) and determined by clinical adjudication based on KDIGO stage 2–3

using R package “PredictABEL” (31). In addition, we compared 
the AUCs from these two models using the Delong method for 
paired AUCs.
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statis-
tical significance. All reported p values are two sided. All analy-
ses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) 
and R 3.1.0 (31).

referred from the emergency department with relatively short 
delay between hospital and ICU admission (median [intra-
quartile range] time from hospital to ICU admission was 2 hr 
[0–8 hr]). Exposure to radiocontrast agents and nephrotoxic 
drugs and the presence of risk factors such as diabetes mel-
litus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension were similar in 
patients who did or did not develop AKI. However, history of 
congestive heart failure and liver disease were more common 
in those patients developing AKI. Patients with AKI also had 
lower mean arterial pressure and were more often treated with 
vasopressors. Baseline serum creatinine and severity of illness 
as judged by baseline nonrenal APACHE III and SOFA scores 
were also greater for patients developing AKI (Table 1).
Biomarker Performance
The unadjusted RR for AKI by strata of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
defined by three cutoffs (0.3, 1.0, and 2.0) are shown in Figure 2. 
The absolute risk in the low stratum (≤ 0.3) was 2.7% increasing 
to 53.3% in the highest stratum (> 2.0) for an RR of 19.7 (95% 
CI, 4.3–69.4; p < 0.001). Patients with AKI had significantly 
higher levels of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] than patients without AKI 
(p < 0.001). This effect of AKI on [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] levels 
was not modified by nonrenal SOFA (p = 0.70). In addition, 
nonrenal SOFA subgroup did not affect [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
values after adjusting for AKI status (p = 0.29).
The overall AUC for [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] for predicting AKI 
in this cohort was 0.84 (0.77–0.90). For patients with a nonre-
nal SOFA score of greater than 7, the [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] AUC 
was 0.85 (0.76–0.94) and similarly for patients with nonrenal 
SOFA of less than or equal to 7, the AUC was 0.84 (0.73–0.92) 
(Fig. 3). For comparison, the AUC for a serum creatinine 
measured at the same time as urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
yielded AUC of 0.73 (0.59–0.85) for patients with a nonrenal 
SOFA score of greater than 7 and AUC of 0.77 (0.65–0.87) for

patients with a nonrenal SOFA score less than or equal to 7. 
Similarly, estimated glomerular filtration rate yielded AUCs of 
0.75 (0.61–0.87) and 0.76 (0.63–0.87).
Of note, we reported previously that for patients with sepsis 
in the Sapphire study (19), the individual marker performance 
for TIMP-2 was superior to IGFBP7, whereas the opposite 
was true for surgical patients. Here, in this combined cohort 
of sepsis patients, we again saw a better AUC for TIMP-2 0.84 
(0.77–0.90) compared with that for IGFBP7 0.79 (0.72–0.86). 
Interestingly, these results were unchanged across low and high 
nonrenal SOFA subgroups.
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] remained a strong predictor for AKI 
after adjustment for clinical variables, including severity of ill-
ness (APACHE III), nonrenal organ dysfunction (SOFA), body 
mass index, fluid output, and serum creatinine concentration. 
Addition of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] to a clinical model signifi-
cantly improved its predictive ability from 0.86 to 0.94 (p = 
0.015) (Table 2). We also performed cfNRI and IDI. Table S1 
(Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/
B893) shows that [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] improves the overall 
predictive ability of the model (statistically significant AUC 
increase, IDI, and cfNRI). ICU and hospital outcomes strati-
fied by biomarker results are shown in Table S2 (Supplemental 
Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/B894).
Finally, operating characteristics (sensitivity, specific-
ity, PPV, and NPV) at all three cut-offs (0.3, 1.0, and 2.0) are 
shown in Table 3. Sensitivity remains near 95% and specificity 
near 90% for the 0.3 and 2.0 cut-offs, respectively. Table S3 
(Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/CCM/
B895) shows operating characteristics for [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
cutoffs ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 at 0.1 intervals.
DISCUSSION
For patients with sepsis, AKI is strongly associated with both 
short- and long-term adverse consequences (1, 2). Indeed, in 
a recent study of patients with septic shock, 60-day hospital 
mortality was 6.2% for patients without AKI, 16.8% for stage 
1, and 27.7% for stage 2–3 (32). Early and adequate treat-
ment of sepsis might prevent sepsis-induced AKI, attenuate 
AKI severity or might reduce the need for renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) (33, 34). Rapid identification of septic patients 
at high risk for developing AKI could substantially improve 
the therapeutic approach. In this context, specific and sensitive 
biomarkers of renal cell injury or stress could play an impor-
tant role. We evaluated the performance of the novel urinary 
cell-cycle arrest biomarker test [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in septic 
patients at high risk for developing AKI. We chose to assess risk 
of moderate to severe AKI because this severity (corresponding 
to KDIGO stage 2 and 3) has been shown to be associated with 
a significantly increased prevalence of clinically important out-
comes such as receipt of RRT and in hospital death (35), as well 
as adverse effects on long-term survival specifically in patients 
with sepsis (1).
Sepsis is a challenging area for AKI biomarkers. NGAL and 
IL-18 have been examined as potential biomarkers of AKI, but 
both are strongly influenced by systemic inflammation thus 
degrading their specificity (36, 37). Although a small study 
recently reported better performance of NGAL (both plasma 
and urine) for AKI in patients with sepsis (AUCs, 0.83 and 0.89) 
(38), most studies have noted modest performance of biomark-
ers in this population. Recently, a sophisticated machine-learn-
ing analysis was performed using candidate biomarkers selected 
from extensive transcriptomic analysis to predict AKI on day 3 
in pediatric patients with sepsis (37). Even after including AKI 
status on day 1 in the model (positive in half the cases), the 
AUC only reached 0.83 in the test cohort (37). These challenges 
are perhaps not surprising because the mechanisms of organ 
injury in sepsis may not be organ specific (37). However, our 
results indicate that the performance of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in 
patients with sepsis is not significantly confounded by nonrenal 
SOFA. Thus, clinicians can rely on these biomarkers for predict-
ing AKI even in the presence of nonrenal organ failures. This is 
a notable advance in comparison with other biomarkers that 
are available around the world (39–42).
As alluded to in a recent study of remote ischemic precondi-
tioning (43), biomarkers of cell-cycle arrest such as TIMP-2 and 
IGFBP7 may signal that the renal epithelium has been stressed 
and has shut down function but may still be able to recover 
without permanent injury to the organ. Importantly, both 
TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 appear to be able to signal in autocrine 
and paracrine fashions, thus spreading the “alarm” from the site 
of injury (15, 44). In terms of timing, this signal could be ideal 
as it may be early enough that management strategies can still 
alter the outcome. This is particularly important in septic AKI 
where delay and early timing remains a major issue (4, 32, 42).

injury (AKI) stratified according to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 
and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
concentrations in all patients. AKI risk in strata with [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
values between 0.3 and 1.0, 1.0 and 2.0, and greater than 2.0 relative to 
risk in the stratum less than or equal to 0.3. Relative risk estimates for the 
upper two strata are significantly greater than 1 (*p < 0.01, **p < 0.001). 
Total of 40 AKI subjects and 192 no AKI. Absolute risk in the less than 
or equal to 0.3 stratum was 2.7% (95% CI, 0.33–9.4%). n = 74, 79, 34, 
and 45 for strata less than 0.3, more than 0.3 to less than or equal to 1.0, 
more than 1.0 to less than or equal to 2.0, and more than 2.0, respectively.

Although not directly examined in these observational tri-
als, we hypothesize that early use of biomarkers of cell-cycle 
arrest such as TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 could help clinicians inter-
vene early on and thus improve outcomes for patients at risk 
of or with early evidence of sepsis-induced AKI (45–47). Early 
awareness that a patient with sepsis is about to develop a major 
organ failure could change a number of clinical decisions. 
For example, selection of antibiotics and dosing/monitor-
ing of nephrotoxic medication (antibiotics or others) would 
be affected. The decision to give intravenous radiocontrast 
(especially intra-arterial) could be altered. Even the decision 
to discharge a patient or commence with a detailed diagnostic 
work-up would be influenced by the probability that a patient 
has or will have AKI (48). For example, consider a patient with 
sepsis admitted from the medical ward and started on broad 
spectrum antibiotics including empiric coverage with vanco-
mycin. The morning after admission (9 hr later), the blood 
pressure and heart rate were normalized and cultures were 
pending. Now imagine that creatinine level of the patient was 
slightly elevated (1.2 mg/dL from 1.0), but urine output was 
adequate. If the patient had a urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
test result more than 2.0, the risk of developing stage 2–3 AKI 
would be more than 50% and the patient’s clinical team might 
well wish to stop or dose-adjust the vancomycin and per-
haps keep the patient in the ICU where fluids, urine output, 
and hemodynamics can be 
monitored 
more 
carefully. 
Conversely, if the result were 
less than 0.3, then the risk 
would be less than 3% and 
thus the patient could be safely 
continued on current regimen.
Of course, biomarkers will 
not take the place of clinical 
judgment and the question 
whether they offer information 
in addition to clinical variables 
is an important one. Although 
clinicians are unlikely to use 
statistical models at the bed-
side, the model shown in 
Table 2 represents the limits 
of information that can be 
derived from clinical variables. 
Indeed, the model used here 
was developed in this dataset 
and is therefore likely over-
trained. As such, it represents 
and unrealistic “benchmark” 
to compare the biomarker. 
Nevertheless, the markers show 
added value even in this set-
ting. Recent work examining 
the role of electronic surveil-
lance for AKI has shown that 
although computer programs 
can help identification of AKI, this alone may not improve 
patient outcomes. Indeed, electronic alerts may be “too late” 
because they are based on creatinine that is too late. Wilson 
et al (49) examined an electronic alert based on KDIGO stage 
1 but could not demonstrate changes in physician practice or 
patient outcome. Physicians may already be aware of an AKI 
event and so do not change their management. Importantly, 
the [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP-7] test was developed to assess risk for 
stage 2–3 AKI 12 hours prior to its clinical manifestation. This 
has two important potential benefits over the electronic alert. 
First, 12 hours is a long time in the ICU and could be a deci-
sive period to discontinue nephrotoxins, investigate the source 
of sepsis, and improve resuscitation. Second, as many as 70% 
of AKI alerts will be for patients that never progress beyond 
stage 1 AKI. Alert fatigue is a large factor leading to clinicians 
ignoring alerts. The [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP-7] test was developed 
for stage 2–3 AKI, and thus it does not detect stage 1 conditions 
that are low risk for progression. Conversely, like all diagnos-
tics, biomarkers for AKI should not be used in patient popu-
lations for which they were not developed. Low-risk patients 
(e.g., stable outpatients) will exhibit far greater false-positive 
rates compared with critically ill patients and would not be 
appropriate for the [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP-7] test.
Our study has important strengths. We analyzed data from 
two large and unrelated cohorts with two different methods of 
Figure 3. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 [TIMP-
2]·[IGFBP7] and acute kidney injury (AKI) status within 12 hr for all patients and for subgroups according 
to nonrenal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Boxes and whiskers show, respectively, 
interquartile ranges and total observed ranges, censored by 1.5 times the box range. Horizontal dashes within 
the boxes show the medians. SOFA scores were calculated from patient data collected on the day of enrollment. 
Patients with AKI had significantly higher levels of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] than patients without AKI (p < 0.001 by 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In the linear regression model, where the response variable is rank transformed [TIMP-
2]·[IGFBP7] and the explanatory variables are AKI status, SOFA subgroup status, and the interaction between 
them, the interaction was not statistically significant (p = 0.70). [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] was greater in patients 
with AKI than in those without AKI in both subgroups (p < 0.001), and there was no statistically significant 
dependence of [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] on SOFA subgroup regardless of the AKI status (p = 0.29).

determining the AKI endpoint (KDIGO stage 2–3 and clinical 
adjudication). However, this could be viewed as limitation, and 
there are also other important limitations to this work. First, 
because the Sapphire and Topaz clinical trials were not spe-
cifically designed to examine sepsis-induced AKI, we did not 
collect information on the type of organism or on the timing 
of infection. Nonetheless, our results are consistent across both 
multicenter cohort studies. Second, long-term outcomes were 
not available or was quality of life assessed in the Topaz study. 
Third, and most importantly, we could not examine whether 
the availability of biomarker results would have changed 
patient management or outcomes. This question awaits further 
study. However, given the limited information in the literature 
about the performance of biomarkers in sepsis-induced AKI, 
despite its common occurrence, we believe that our results 
should inform clinical practice and future research.
CONCLUSIONS
The urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] test provides accurate pre-
diction of AKI in septic patients, and test performance is not 
affected by nonrenal organ dysfunction. As such, the test may 
extend the therapeutic window for renal protection and poten-
tially enhance (future) therapeutic interventions to prevent or 
attenuate AKI.
