Abstract
Sensory drive, the concept that sensory systems primarily evolve under the influence of environmen-
tal features and that animal signals are evolutionarily shaped and tuned by these previously existing
sensory systems, has been thoroughly studied regarding visual signals across many animals. Much
of this work has focused on spectral aspects of vision and signals. Here, I review work on polarized-
light signals of animals and relate these to what is known of polarization visual systems, polarized-
light aspects of visual scenes, and polarization-related behavior (e.g., orientation, habitat-finding,
contrast enhancement). Other than the broad patterns of scattered polarized light in the sky, most po-
larization in both terrestrial and aquatic environments results from either reflection or scattering in
the horizontal plane. With overhead illumination, horizontal features such as the surfaces of many
leaves or of air: water interfaces reflect horizontal polarization, and water scatters horizontally polar-
ized light under most conditions. Several animal species have been demonstrated to use horizontally
polarized light fields or features in critical aspects of their biology. Significantly, most biological sig-
nals are also horizontally polarized. Here, I present relevant polarization-related behavior and discuss
the hypothesis that sensory drive has evolutionarily influenced the structure of polarization signals.
The paper also considers the evolutionary origin of circular polarization vision and circularly polar-
ized signals. It appears that this class of signals did not evolve under the influence of sensory drive.
The study of signals based on polarized light is becoming a mature field of research.
Key words: animal communication, polarized light, sensory drive, vision, visual signal
Introduction
When
John
Endler
introduced
the
term
“sensory
drive”
(Endler 1992), the idea encouraged the view that signals and the sen-
sory systems of animals work together. The scheme he discussed
was that sensory system evolution is heavily influenced by local en-
vironmental conditions, such as the sources of relevant stimuli, the
characteristics of the transmission of stimuli in a particular environ-
ment, and the background features or ongoing irrelevant stimuli
(“noise”) from which significant stimuli must be discriminated.
Animal “signals,” stimuli significant for communication that origin-
ate from other animals, are in turn shaped—at least in part—by the
properties of the sensory systems to which they are directed. Thus,
environment shapes sensation, and sensation shapes signals.
Endler’s presentation seemed to invert the usual way in which
signal and sensory evolution were assumed to evolve. But on think-
ing about the idea further (and as he discussed at some length), sen-
sory systems must in some way be tuned to the environment for
many reasons fundamentally associated with survival and successful
reproduction. In fact, the ideas behind sensory drive were first
articulated soon after the publication of “The Origin of Species”.
In 1879, Grant Allen wrote “. . . almost all the colours of vegetal
life, except the uniform green of the foliage, are . . . due to the
colour-sense of one or other of the great seeing classes, the verte-
brate and the articulate”, adding “[Color vision has played a major
role] in the moulding of organic forms (Allen 1879).” Effective sig-
nals must reach an intended receiver efficiently while being as

 inconspicuous as possible to potential predators. Obviously, while
there are many constraints on signal evolution (avoiding the pres-
ence of predators when possible, reducing interception by competi-
tors or unintended receivers, and so forth), the signal must be
perceptible to the receiver and clearly different from confounding
stimuli. It must be structured to excite the appropriate sensory sys-
tem of the receiver, and thus under the evolutionary influence of
properties of this sensory system. Often, the reduction of predation
and unintended interception are managed by the timing of signal
production or by signaling mechanisms that direct it most effectively
at the proper receiver.
Therefore, signals can represent an intriguing inversion of
Wehner’s (1987) “matched filter”, where the features of a sensory sys-
tem are shaped to detect a particular stimulus with high efficiency (see
also von der Emde and Warrant [2016] for more about matched fil-
ters). In sensory drive, the stimulus is structured to be perceived by a
sensory system. Nevertheless, there are a few cases in which sensory
systems have converged onto signals which themselves have probably
been shaped by environmental features. Perhaps the best example is
found in the bioluminescent flashes of signaling fireflies. Here, it
appears that the bioluminescent emission spectra of fireflies that are
active at different times of the evening (early twilight, late twilight, or
night) vary so as to be most effective in the illumination, and against
the backgrounds, visible at that particular time and place (Seliger
et al. 1982a, 1982b). In turn, the sensitivity spectra of receptors in
their compound eyes are tuned to match almost perfectly these emis-
sion spectra across many species—perfect examples of matched filters
(Lall et al. 1980, 1988; Cronin et al. 2000). This paper is not con-
cerned with bioluminescence, but diverse bioluminescent signaling
systems illustrate how sensory systems and signals coevolve in unex-
pected ways (see Haddock et al. 2010; Cronin et al. 2014).
Endler (1992) focused on sensory drive and visual signals in his
presentation of the topic, and since then it’s likely that a strong ma-
jority of studies of this process have concerned visual systems and
visual signals (although there is no scarcity of other systems repre-
sented). Most of this work centers on spectral sensitivity tuning and
color signals and patterns. However, a diverse assortment of animals
uses
an
entirely
different
property
of
light
for
signals:
its
polarization.
Because humans are nearly insensitive to light’s polarization and
are incapable of resolving polarization patterns in nature or in ani-
mal signals, this aspect of visual signaling was ignored until Shashar
et al. (1996) reported that cuttlefish produce rapidly varying pat-
terns of polarized stripes that appear to act as visual signals. Since
then, many examples of polarized-light signals (or potential signals)
have been discovered (Cronin et al. 2003, 2014; Marshall et al.
2014). Here, we consider how sensory drive might have structured
these polarization signals. We also report a type of polarized-light
signal that appears to have evolved to a sensory modality that may
have been lying dormant until an appropriate signal evolved.
Before proceeding further, I want to go into a bit of semantics.
Sensory drive acts on signals, which are used in intraspecific or inter-
specific communication. When communicating with conspecifics,
such signals may be directed at males, females, or both, and may be
involved in mate selection, behavioral intent, competition, or agon-
istic behaviors. Signals directed at heterospecifics are often con-
cerned with predator deterrence (agonistic or aposematic signals).
“Biological communication” is very difficult to define, and defini-
tions tend to center either on adaptiveness or on function (informa-
tion content); see Scott-Phillips (2008) for a discussion of this
dilemma.
Bradbury
and
Vehrencamp
(1998,
p.
357)
define
communication as “an exchange of a signal between a sender and a
receiver to the benefit of both parties.” This definition rules out
camouflage or deceptive signals, such as bluffs or exaggerations
(where only one party, the sender, benefits), even though such sig-
nals are obviously amenable to evolution via sensory drive.
Owren et al.’s (2010) definition of communication focuses on a sig-
nal’s influence on a receiver rather than on the information content
of a signal; since the function of crypsis is to avoid detection by a re-
ceiver, it is not a signal under this definition, and we will not con-
sider it here.
An excellent and approachable discussion of actual signals,
including definitions, can be found in Maynard Smith and Harper’s
(2003) review, although they do not consider the sensory aspects of
signaling. Still, defining (or even recognizing) a “signal” is some-
times problematic (Bradbury and Vehrencamp 1998). Just demon-
strating that a particular action or marking is a signal can be
challenging, since the generation of the signal, the behavior of both
sender and receiver, and the benefits of such behavior are observed
rarely or not at all under natural circumstances. This is particularly
true of polarization markings and patterns, which certainly are
strong candidates for signals. Most of these have never been
observed in use in nature, and even under experimental conditions
their validity as signals is only inferred, as will be noted later, when
candidate signals are discussed. Nevertheless, there is compelling
evidence that at least some polarization features are signals and that
they are shaped by sensory drive. It is now time to turn to polarized
light, its generation in nature, and its perception by animals.
Polarized Light
Properties and formation of polarized light
If you look up at a clear blue sky, you would never know that your
eyes are being flooded with polarized light. Humans are essentially
blind to this electromagnetic property, but many animals are as cap-
able of seeing and analyzing light’s polarization as we are of seeing
and analyzing color. Here, we discuss the properties, sources, and
distributions of polarized light in nature.
As it travels through space, each vibrating photon in a beam of
light creates a wave of electromagnetic energy with 2 properties:
wavelength and polarization. The wavelength is the distance in
space between identical points, or phases, of the wave; in vision it
ranges from �300 to �725 nm, varying with species. Polarization is
a different property; it refers to the orientation of the wave. Single
photons have a characteristic plane of vibration; the orientation of
the electrical component of this vibration relative to the direction of
travel is called the e-vector axis (or plane of polarization; measured
clockwise relative to the detector’s view, with 0�/180� being the ver-
tical plane). By definition, each individual photon is polarized, but
beams of light—such as light coming from a patch of the sky—con-
tain countless photons, each vibrating with its individual wavelength
on its individual e-vector axis. The mix of wavelengths determines
the spectrum of the beam; to us and many other animals, it deter-
mines its color. The polarization of the beam as a whole similarly
depends on the mix of e-vector axes of all the photons making it up.
If the e-vectors are completely random, the beam is said to be un-
polarized (0% polarized); if all are completely parallel, the beam is
fully polarized (100% polarized). Much light contains photons with
mixed axes and is partially polarized (see Johnsen 2012).
To this point, I have only covered a type of polarization properly
called “linear polarization,” since the e-vector, viewed along the
axis of the polarized beam, is a straight line. In the laboratory, this

 light is usually produced by passing it through a linear polarizer
(Figure 1A,B). However, light can also be circularly polarized, in
which case the view along the beam axis is of an e-vector that
rotates in a full circle, either clockwise or counterclockwise
(Figure 1; see also Johnsen 2012). The e-vector makes this circle
once for each wavelength travelled by the beam, so seen from the
side the tip of the vector traces a helical path (Figure 1B,C). In the la-
boratory, circular polarization is produced by passing fully linearly
polarized light through a quarter-wave plate (an optical device that
delays one axis of linear polarization by 1=
4 of a wavelength relative
to the orthogonal axis; Figure 1A,B). Much light in nature is elliptic-
ally polarized, having a mix of linear and circular components
(Johnsen 2012; see also Cronin et al. 2014). In such cases, the long
axis of the ellipse traced out by successive positions of the e-vector is
at the e-vector angle of the linear component.
Most natural (and artificial) sources produce light that is either
unpolarized or very weakly polarized. Still, the world is full of polar-
ized light, because light’s interaction with matter often favors one
type of polarization over another. Scattering and reflection are the
most common sources of linear polarization (Wehner 2001; Cronin
and Marshall 2011; Marshall and Cronin 2011). That blue sky we
looked at a little while ago has a prominent pattern of highly
linearly polarized light caused by molecular scattering within the
atmosphere (Figure 2A). Such scattering is most effective for short-
wavelength photons, which is why the sky is blue (as your mother
explained to you; actually, it’s even brighter in the ultraviolet).
Scattering also favors photons with polarizations that are perpen-
dicular both to the initial and to the final path of the photon, in
other words, whose e-vectors are normal to the plane containing the
incident and scattered ray. Scattering perpendicular to the axis of
the incident ray is permitted only for such photons, so the degree of
linear polarization (or percent polarization) varies from 0% for
forward-scattered rays to 100% for rays scattered into the plane
perpendicular to the incident path. Since essentially all light in the
sky comes from the sun, the overall polarization pattern has a band
of very highly linearly polarized light at 90� to the sun with dimin-
ished polarization at other angles. Celestial polarization never
reaches exactly 100% because many photons reaching the earth’s
surface have been scattered more than once, somewhat scrambling
their angles of polarization.
The second process that favors light of certain linear polarization
planes is reflection. Light reflected from a non-metallic surface (such
as leaves or the air: water interface) becomes enriched in photons
with polarization planes parallel to the surface (Figure 2B). At an
angle defined by the refractive indices of the materials on each side
of the surface (e.g., air vs. water), called Brewster’s angle, the
reflected light is fully polarized. For water, Brewster’s angle is about
53�. In other words, when looking down at a flat and calm pure
water surface at an angle of 53� to the vertical, the reflected light
you see is 100% polarized. Polarized sunglasses have their polariza-
tion transmission axes placed vertically, eliminating most horizon-
tally reflected light, for example from wet surfaces, glass, or painted
metal. Thus, they increase contrast; also, they allow the wearer to
see through the attenuated shine of the water’s surface into the
water itself. Polarization filters on cameras may be used for the
same purpose or to block polarization in the sky for dramatic images
of clouds (which generally scatter little polarization) or skyscapes.
The very low refractive index of air (n ¼ 1.0) compared with al-
most any solid or liquid material, together with the scattering of
sunlight in the atmosphere, means that most terrestrial scenes have a
complex pattern of polarized light, visible in almost any direction
during the day. Underwater, the situation is much simpler. With
water’s elevated refractive index (n¼1.33), there is far less reflection
of light from submerged objects than there is in air. This leaves scat-
tering as the primary means of producing polarization. Near the sur-
face (perhaps to depths of 20 or 30 m in very clear water, less in
turbid locations) the polarization pattern of the sky can be seen, al-
though multiple-path scattering in water quickly obliterates it. On
the other hand, water itself is a scattering medium. Since light gener-
ally enters water from nearly overhead, and becomes even more cen-
tered on the zenith as depth increases, the tendency to produce
greatest polarization at scattering angles of 90� means that under-
water scenes are dominated by a field of horizontally polarized light
visible in all directions (Figure 2C; see also Ivanoff and Waterman
1958; Waterman 1981; Cronin and Shashar 2001; Cronin and
Marshall 2011; Marshall and Cronin 2011; Cronin et al. 2014). If
an animal is interested in seeing nearby objects or other creatures as
silhouettes against this bright, horizontally polarized background, it
is advantageous to view the world through a visual system that is
able to detect this horizontal axis of polarization. On the other
hand, animals may wish to penetrate this obscuring haze to see
things that are further away and washed out by the intervening veil
of horizontally polarized light. In this case, vision could favor
enhancing vertical polarization sensitivity. Of course, depending on
Figure 1. Diagrammatic representations of linearly and circularly polarized
light as produced by an unpolarized light beam entering from the right and
propagating through first a linear polarizer oriented at 45� and then a quarter
wave plate with its fast axis oriented vertically. The linear polarizer transmits
fully linearly polarized light, while the quarter wave plate delays the horizon-
tal component of this light by 1=
4 wave relative to the vertical component, pro-
ducing left-handed circularly polarized light. Panels A and B illustrate 2 ways
of portraying polarization (as axes or vectors). Panel C shows the successive
peaks of the horizontal (green) and vertical (blue) components of the same
circularly polarized wave, as well as the helical path traced by their resultant
vectors (red). (Figure modified from Wikipedia.).

 downstream neural processing, the same visual system could handle
both vertically polarized and horizontally polarized objects or
scenes.
Circular polarization is rare in nature; in fact, the only described
case on earth is for linearly polarized light in aquatic habitats that
becomes internally reflected from the air:water interface (Ivanoff
and Waterman 1958). A few animals, however, create circularly
polarized light by a variety of optical mechanisms that will be dis-
cussed in the section on circularly polarized signals (see also Johnsen
2012; Cronin et al. 2014). Because circularly polarized light is not
common, most of the discussion here considers linear polarization.
When writing about circular polarization, I note this specifically.
Many surfaces reflect polarized light, and some of these may be
modified to form visual signals. Such modifications are only useful if
they can be viewed and interpreted. As a consequence, the polariza-
tion vision systems of animals have the potential to drive the evolu-
tion of polarized-light signals. We now turn to the properties of such
visual systems.
Polarized light photoreception and vision
With our very limited polarized-light sensitivity (Temple et al.
2015), humans probably have no natural behavior that involves
using the polarization of light. Thus, we tend to discount the signifi-
cance of polarization vision, but the huge majority of animals would
disagree with us. In fact, linear polarization sensitivity is widespread
among invertebrate phyla and is likely to be important in some ver-
tebrates as well (Cronin et al. 2003, 2014; Marshall and Cronin
2011; Marshall et al. 2011). Detection of linearly polarized light
is
inherent
to
visual
pigments
of
all
animals,
because
the
chromophores of these molecules absorb photons most effectively
when the e-vector of a given photon is parallel to the chromophore’s
long axis. To give an entire receptor cell linear polarization sensitiv-
ity, chromophores must therefore be aligned roughly in parallel
throughout the receptive membranes of the cell (where the visual
pigments are contained).
As it happens, when visual pigments sit in the plasma membrane,
their chromophores are situated parallel to the plane of the mem-
brane. The rod disks and cone lamellae of vertebrate photoreceptors
have roughly planar membranes, and rhodopsin molecules appar-
ently rotate rather freely in these membranes (Figure 3A); thus, the
overall pattern of absorption is random, and these cells are expected
to be polarization-insensitive. Nevertheless, because there is some
evidence that vertebrates do use polarized-light analysis for orienta-
tion or migration, various mechanisms have been proposed that
could
give
a
limited
polarization
sense
to
rods
or
cones
(Roberts et al. 2011). There is no convincing evidence, however,
that vertebrates use polarized light for signaling. In photoreceptors
where the membranes are organized into microvilli, as in arthropods
or molluscs, the strong curvature of the microvillar membranes evi-
dently restricts the rotational freedom of visual pigment molecules,
giving the entire microvillus inbuilt linear polarization sensitivity
(Figure 3B). To make an entire photoreceptor cell polarization-
sensitive, all microvilli from that single cell must extend out parallel
to each other. Most commonly, such cells are oriented so that micro-
villi of adjacent photoreceptors are oriented orthogonal to each
other, an arrangement that fosters 2-axis polarization analysis
(Marshall and Cronin 2011; Cronin et al. 2014; Marshall et al.
2014). All animals thought to use polarization signaling have such

the bottom view through a vertical polarizer (also indicated by the 2-headed arrows). (A) Full-sky images taken using a fisheye lens viewing the entire celestial
hemisphere, showing scattering in a partly cloudy sky at sunrise; North is to the top and East to the left. A band of polarization passing overhead with the e-vector

induced polarization in the clear blue water over a coral reef. The light is �50% polarized with a horizontal e-vector. When the horizontal polarization is removed
there is greater contrast (lower panel), especially at longer viewing distances.

 2-axis analyzers, probably synapsing onto an opponent interneuron
to enhance polarization sensitivity. A schematic example of such an
arrangement, found in many arthropods and cephalopods, is illus-
trated in Figure 3C.
Perception of circularly polarized light seems to be very rare, and
in fact is only described in a few species of stomatopod crustaceans
(mantis shrimps). The mechanism used is the reverse of that used to
create circularly polarized light in the laboratory (Figure 1), with the
light entering the diagrams in Figure 1A,B from the left. Some man-
tis shrimp eyes contain structures that function as quarter-wave
plates, and these recombine the out-of-phase circular components
into a linearly polarized output (Chiou et al. 2008b; Roberts et al.
2009). This is then directed to underlying linear polarization recep-
tors built from aligned microvilli, like those just described. The over-
all result is that these receptors respond differentially to circular
polarization with clockwise or counterclockwise rotation.
Sensory Drive and the Evolution of Linearly
Polarized-Light Signals
Production of linearly polarized light by animals
Animals use the same processes as environments to generate linearly
polarized light from depolarized light sources. Most animals have
surfaces that reflect polarized light, a process that is generally un-
avoidable in air. Some animals, such as many tropical butterflies
(Figure 4A), have specialized features that enhance polarization
reflections and use these to produce signals (Douglas et al. 2007).
Butterflies use specially formed scales to produce bright, often spec-
trally narrow, reflections (Douglas et al. 2007; Vukusic and
Stavenga 2009; Giraldo and Stavenga 2016). Linearly polarized
reflections are also possible underwater, but because of the elevated
refractive index of water, dense organic structures must be used.
Cephalopod molluscs use specialized cells called iridophores con-
taining a very high refractive-index protein, reflectin, to produce
patterns of polarization on their bodies (Figure 4B; Shashar et al.
1996; Crookes et al. 2004; Chiou et al. 2007; Izumi et al. 2009).
Animals use 2 other optical mechanisms to generate linearly
polarized light. Some species of stomatopod crustaceans employ a
special type of scattering to do this (Figure 4C; Chiou et al. 2008a;
Jordan et al. 2016). Unlike the broad expanses of the sky or the sur-
rounding light field in water, the polarization from some mantis
shrimps’ scattering structures has a constant e-vector angle, invari-
ant with the angle of illumination, so clearly it is not due to symmet-
rical scattering as from a molecule. Instead, the mechanism is unique
to stomatopods, being based on a rather exotic structure constructed
from stacked, elongated, and precisely dimensioned and spaced pho-
tonic features that act as tuned scatterers favoring one axis of polar-
ization (Jordan et al. 2016). Other stomatopods possess polarizing
structures that use dichroic filters to polarize light, a mechanism
thought to be unique to these animals. These filters, functionally
analogous to polaroid film (basically, the same material used in
polarized sunglasses), have long, aligned molecules that preferential-
ly transmit polarized light having its e-vector plane perpendicular to
the long axes of the molecules. The filters work because the long
molecules absorb light polarized parallel to them, so light polarized
in the orthogonal plane passes through. Stomatopods use the long
keto-carotenoid astaxanthin to polarize via dichroism (Figure 4D),
so the light that is transmitted is red (because astaxanthin absorbs
shorter wavelengths of light). Species using this mechanism take ad-
vantage of the fact that astaxanthin’s length is almost exactly equal
to the distance between the layers of the plasma membrane’s lipid
bilayer. Consequently, the molecule spans the membranes of cells
used in the polarizer, with its polarization axes perpendicular to
these membranes. The transmitted horizontally polarized light is
parallel to the plane of the plasma membrane, so such a polarizer is
best seen when viewed at an angle. Stomatopods enhance the effect
by placing membrane sheets containing the astaxanthin over a
reflecting layer of cuticle (Chiou et al. 2012).
Polarized-light patterns as signals
While many surfaces of animals have the ability to reflect polarized
light, the structures just described appear to be specialized to form
visual signals. Understanding the nature (or even the presence) of
polarized-light signals, not to mention their evolution, is very chal-
lenging. Marshall et al. (2014) strongly argued that the question has
received “overenthusiastic optimism” in generating hypotheses and
Figure 3. (A) Absorption of polarized light by vertebrate rod photoreceptors. Light arrives normal to the flat surfaces of rod disks and is absorbed by chromo-
phores of visual pigment in the disk membranes (double-headed arrows show preferred e-vector orientations). Since the absorption preference is random, there
is no overall polarization signal (top). Light aimed from the side of the disk encounters chromophores roughly parallel to the membrane, favoring the absorption
of horizontally polarized light (bottom). (B) Absorption of polarized light by microvillar photoreceptors. Light arrives orthogonal to the long axis of each microvil-
lus, and encounters visual pigment chromophores that are oriented roughly parallel to the axis of the microvillus (top). Thus, the microvillus as a whole preferen-
tially absorbs light polarized parallel to its axis. If light were to arrive from the end of the microvillus (bottom), it would encounter chromophore orientations at all
angles, so there would be no preferred polarization absorption. (C) Diagrammatic view of typical polarization-sensitive photoreceptors in compound eyes of
insects, seen in cross section (crustaceans and cephalopods have analogous arrangements). Light arrives perpendicular to the plane of the page, and passes
through many layers of microvilli. Cells on opposite sides of the receptor extend parallel microvilli toward the junction in the center, and thus have parallel polar-
ization sensitivity. Two orthogonal sets of receptors (Cells 1 and 3 vs. Cells 2 and 4) can provide information for 2-axis polarization analysis.

 interpreting results. The problem stems from the simple fact that
animal surfaces naturally reflect all sorts of polarization patterns.
We see none of these, so when careful polarimetry reveals a striking
pattern in the polarization domain, it is natural to jump to the con-
clusion that it means something to a viewer with polarization vision.
That these patterns are hidden to us then suggests that the signaling
is “secret,” carrying privileged, encrypted intraspecific information.
(Similar arguments were once advanced for patterns visible in ultra-
violet light.) There are 2 types of problems with this kind of think-
ing. In the first place, knowing that an animal’s visual system
responds to polarized light is no demonstration that it even is inter-
ested in polarized objects, much less that it is used in communication
(see Cronin et al. 2014; Marshall et al. 2014). Also, impressive pat-
terns of polarization reflection are likely to be a consequence of un-
usually shaped body features or of underlying structural elements,
and thus may be unrelated to signal production. A final set of issues
arises from the experimental challenges of polarization vision re-
search in general, where it is very easy to misinterpret experimental
results (Foster et al. 2018).
Given these limitations and biases, how do we decide that a po-
larization pattern is a signal? The minimal criteria are these: (1) the
intended receiver must be capable of perceiving polarized objects;
(2) the signal must be used on a body part or region prominently dis-
played when the sender is interacting with a conspecific; (3) the sig-
nal must be used in a behaviorally relevant context (e.g., aggression,
deterrence, mate selection); (4) detection of the signal by the receiver
must be associated with a clear response; and (5) the signaling
should occur in a natural setting (particularly regarding lighting, po-
larization environment, and reasonable freedom of movement).
In fact, no hypothetical polarization signal has ever met all 5 of these
criteria. It is difficult to control the polarized-light environment
(Foster et al. 2018), very difficult to separate the polarization con-
tent of a possible signal from other features (e.g., movement,
brightness, color), and hard to know whether a receiver’s subse-
quent behavior is a response or some irrelevant action. Nevertheless,
there are some compelling cases that strongly suggest the use of po-
larization signaling.
The use of polarized-light reflections as potential signals was first
reported in a cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis (Shashar et al. 1996).
Cuttlefish produce highly polarized reflections, which can be
switched on and off via neural regulation on timescales of seconds
(Izumi et al. 2009), from iridophores in their arms; these reflections
are horizontally polarized in typical underwater lighting conditions
(Shashar et al. 1996; Chiou et al. 2007). The patterns are displayed
in social interactions, and they differ in their frequency of use be-
tween males and females, suggesting that they play roles in commu-
nication (Shashar et al. 1996; Boal 1997; Boal et al. 2004). Similar
reflections are found on the arms of squids (Chiou et al. 2007; see
Figure 4B), where their biological significance is unknown. Given
that cephalopods have large brains, good eyes with polarization sen-
sitivity, and complex behavior, it is difficult avoid concluding that
their use of switchable polarization patterns is involved in signaling.
Still, definitive proof that they are used in this way is lacking.
Probably the strongest case for the use of polarization signals is
in the nymphalid butterfly Heliconius cydno. Sweeney et al. (2003)
showed that this species reflects polarization patterns and that males
of the species are far more likely to approach females viewed
through windows that transmit polarized light than those viewed
through
depolarizing
windows.
Encouragingly,
the
congener
Heliconius melpomene, which does not reflect such patterns,
showed no differences in approach between the 2 types of windows.
Overall, these results clearly suggest that H. cydno males indeed rec-
ognize the polarized-light reflections from females as signals. Taking
these results further, Douglas et al. (2007) measured the polarization
reflections from specimens of 144 nymphalid species, and found
that about half (75) reflect polarized patterns (e.g., Figure 4A).

 Species inhabiting dimly lit forest habitats were very likely to reflect
these patterns (68% of these species), while species from bright,
open habitats rarely used them (only 10% of species). Douglas et al.
(2007) argued that polarization patterns are more likely than color
patterns to stand out in a dim, achromatic world, and thus should
make effective signals. Many other families of butterflies have irides-
cent, polarized reflections which could be important for signaling
(see Marshall et al. [2014] for a review).
The animals that have the widest known diversity of intriguing
polarization patterns are the mantis shrimps—stomatopod crusta-
ceans. Mantis shrimp patterns are not produced by surface reflection
(so far as is known), but by photonic, reflective scattering
(Jordan et al. 2016) or by oriented, dichroic molecules (Chiou et al.
2012). To us, the photonic structures appear to be shiny blue
(Figure 4C), so it is difficult to disentangle their signaling value as a
color signal from their polarization features. Scattering polarizers
are found on the anterior appendages of several stomatopod species
(Cronin et al. 2003; Chiou et al. 2008a; How et al. 2014; Marshall
et al. 2014), where they may be moved rapidly in a characteristic
mating display (Chiou et al. 2011). In contrast to the relatively
restricted locations of scattering polarizers, dichroic polarizers in
mantis shrimps (Figure 4D) are found in many body structures,
including antennal scales (the flaps that project laterally out from
the base of the antennae), legs, carapace, telson, and uropods
(Cronin et al. 2003, 2014; Chiou et al. 2008a, 2008b, 2012;
Marshall et al. 2014). Because of the use of astaxanthin to produce
the polarization (Chiou et al. 2012), this type of polarizer generally
appears bright red, so again it is possible that polarized and colored
signals are combined in such structures.
Evidence that stomatopod polarizers are used in signaling is sug-
gestive, but not conclusive. The most solid case can be made for the
blue polarizers of the Indopacific species, Haptosquilla trispinosa
(the species illustrated in Figure 4C). Chiou et al. (2011) were able
to destroy these devices by touching them briefly with a hot pin, a
treatment that left the mobility of the appendage intact but which
removed both the colored and polarized reflections (happily, the ani-
mals regenerated the device when they molted). After being so
treated, courting males continued to display their appendages to
females as before, and would eventually be accepted as partners, but
their displays had to be extended longer, they had to endure more
aggressive responses from females before being accepted, and they
experienced shorter mating durations. These results strongly indi-
cate that the polarizers are involved in signaling, but do not indicate
whether the color, polarization, or both contain the important signal
component. Evidence that the dichroic polarizers play a role in sig-
naling is even more circumstantial. These devices, which are usually
bright red or yellow in color, occur on parts of the body that are
involved in agonistic displays, in defense postures, and in mating dis-
plays (Cronin et al. 2003; Marshall et al. 2014). For example, an in-
dividual Odontodactylus havanensis (a Caribbean species) will
prominently display its polarized antennal scales to an intruder as it
approaches the resident’s burrow (Figure 5A). A different use of the
same appendages has been seen in the Indospecific congener,
Odontodactylus scyllarus. As a male approaches a female of this
species from behind prior to mating, she will wobble her laterally
extended antennal scales (Figure 5B). Since the degree of polariza-
tion reflected from the scale varies with the angle from which it is
viewed (Chiou et al. 2012), this produces a display that should be
very obvious to the approaching male.
Sensory drive and the evolution of
polarized-light signals
Every signal described in this review is horizontally polarized in nor-
mal viewing conditions. In natural illumination in either terrestrial
or aquatic environments, the geometry of the situation is such that
reflective signals from horizontally oriented structures will mostly
include horizontal polarization, so this might not be a surprise.
Dichroic signals are also horizontally polarized for the same reason;
the dichroism actually interacts with light reflected from an underly-
ing layer (Chiou et al. 2012), so the signal is brightest and most
polarized when lit from overhead (as is the case in most often
encountered in nature) and viewed horizontally. Scattering polar-
izers, however, are not limited by the direction of illumination or
view—they reflect horizontally polarized light regardless of how
they are illuminated or seen (Chiou et al. 2008a; Jordan et al. 2016).
If sensory drive is behind the evolution of polarization-based signals,
is there a reason why signaling systems might favor horizontal
polarization?
Because the overhead light field is bright during the day (espe-
cially on sunny days), the terrestrial environment provides an

 abundance of horizontally polarized features (Horva
´th and Varju
´
2003; Cronin and Marshall 2011; Marshall and Cronin 2011;
Cronin et al. 2014; Horva
´th 2014). Insects, in particular, use hori-
zontally polarized reflections from water surfaces (e.g., Figure 2B)
to locate natural ponds and pools (Schwind 1984a, 1984b; Horva
´th
and Varju
´ 2003; Horva
´th and Csabai 2014). In fact, the response is
so widespread and invariant among aquatic insects that it has be-
come a problem. These animals are fatally attracted to shiny artifi-
cial surfaces (Horva
´th et al. 2014b), and many human structures
lure them in large numbers, where they perish. The sensory impact
of horizontal polarization is illustrated in the oviposition behavior
of an Australian swallowtail butterfly, Papilio aegeus (Kelber 1999).
Females of this species select horizontally polarized surfaces on
which to ovoposit. The choice is driven in part by the color of the
substrate; green is preferred over both yellow and blue, but the but-
terflies will choose a horizontally polarized target of any color over
a vertically polarized one of the same color. Furthermore, females
prefer a horizontally polarized yellow surface over a vertically polar-
ized green one, emphasizing the role of polarization in making a
choice. Innate preferences like this easily could guide the evolution
of horizontally polarized signals (like the patterns on butterfly
wings; Figure 4A).
Underwater, the polarized world is much simpler than in air,
since underwater surfaces are poorly reflective. This leaves the omni-
directional spacelight (which is horizontally polarized; Figure 2C) as
the primary source of underwater polarization, against which
objects (and signals) can be viewed. How et al. (2014) demonstrated
that individuals of the protosquillid mantis shrimp H. trispinosa are
significantly more likely to respond to a looming, horizontally polar-
ized stimulus than to a vertically polarized one. This species and sev-
eral close relatives have the bright blue scattering polarizers on their
first maxillipeds (Figure 4C; see Cronin et al. 2003; Chiou et al.
2008a, 2011; How et al. 2014; Jordan et al. 2016). How et al.
(2014) argue that the use of horizontal polarization in signaling
evolved under the influence of the innate response to horizontally
polarized objects. Significantly, the elevated responses to horizontal-
ly polarized looming stimuli are seen in several protosquillid stoma-
topods, including those lacking polarization signaling, which
implies that the response is innate and available for signal evolution.
Many aquatic animals, including crabs, crayfishes, and cephalopods,
respond to polarized looming stimuli (Tuthill and Johnsen 2006;
How et al. 2012; Temple et al. 2012), but biases toward particular
e-vector angles have not yet been investigated.
Circularly Polarized Signal Evolution: Sensory
Drive?
All signals discussed so far are linearly polarized, but a few animals
reflect circularly polarized light. As mentioned before, most circular-
ly polarized light includes a constantly oriented, linearly polarized
component and is properly called “elliptically polarized light,” but
here I’ll focus specifically on the circularly polarized component.
It has long been recognized that many scarab beetles reflect cir-
cularly polarized light (Figure 6A). Michelson (1911) first noted
this, and the phenomenon has recently been described in some detail
by Goldstein (2006). Brady and Cummings (2010) published results
of spontaneous phototaxis experiments that suggested that one spe-
cies of scarab beetles Chrysina gloriosa could discriminate vertical
linearly polarized from left circularly polarized light, while another
C. woodi, could not. Exhaustive tests with hundreds of beetles of 4
other scarab species by Horva
´th’s laboratory, however, found no
evidence that any of these beetles respond differentially to circularly
polarized light of either handedness during feeding or when pre-
sented with individuals of their own species, whether walking or fly-
ing (Blaho
´ et al. 2012; Horva
´th et al. 2014a; see also Foster et al.
2018). Since eyes of scarab beetles do not appear to have any optical
specializations that would permit them to detect circular polariza-
tion, it now appears that their circularly polarized reflections are not
involved in signaling behavior.
A more recent discovery is that some mantis shrimps actually
have circularly polarized body parts and that they are capable of dis-
criminating right from left circularly polarized light (Chiou et al.
2008b). An interesting structure, one that is very likely to be used in
sexual signaling, is the “keel” on the median ridge of the telson of
the stomatopod Odontodactylus cultrifer (Figure 6B,C). This feature
is sexually dimorphic (being much larger in males than females), and
reflects (and transmits) highly circularly polarized light. Amazingly,
when seen from the right side, the polarization of the keel is right
handed; the opposite is true on the left (Figure 6C). Mating behavior
in this species has never been observed, but the sexual dimorphism
strongly suggests that the keel is a sexual signal, and the unique pres-
ence of circular polarization vision in stomatopods may be critical in
detecting and interpreting this signal.
Circularly polarized signals could also be useful in aggressive
encounters. A different mantis shrimp species, Gonodactylaceus fal-
catus, displays highly circularly polarized markings on its legs and
anterior
body
parts
when
it
poses
in
its
burrow
entrance
(Gagnon et al. 2015; Figure 6D). The polarization is left-handed,
and G. falcatus can learn to discriminate circular polarization from
depolarized light, although (unlike Odontodactylus) it seems not to
discriminate right from left circular polarization. The circularly
polarized markings displayed at the burrow entrance (as in
Figure 6D) apparently act defensively, as naive individuals of this
species avoid burrows with entrances marked with circularly polar-
ized filters. Gagnon et al. (2015) suggest that the circular polariza-
tion can be considered a true “covert” signal, in that no animals
besides stomatopod crustaceans would be able to recognize it.
Gonodactylaceus falcatus is often sandy colored and thus well cam-
ouflaged against its coral sand or rock environment, but the circular-
ly polarized reflections could be obvious to another mantis shrimp.
Unlike the evolution of putative linearly polarized signals, these
circularly polarized ones seem not to have originated with a push
from sensory drive. Except for rare and transient optical phenom-
ena, such as internal reflection from the water’s surface (Ivanoff and
Waterman 1958), the marine environment is thought to be devoid
of circular polarization. Indeed, it is mystifying that mantis shrimps
even are able to detect it, given the optical demands of constructing
a circular polarization analyzer and the apparent inutility of sensing
it in the first place. It now appears that circular polarization sensitiv-
ity exists because of an odd arrangement of receptor cells in a subset
of receptors in the midband, a specialized region of mantis shrimp
compound eyes. In 2 rows of ommatidia, excellent orthogonally
arranged polarization receptors exist (similar in principle to
Figure 3C). However, they are placed under a different receptor that
absorbs ultraviolet light, but transmits longer-wavelength light that
the polarization receptors absorb. Uniquely, this ultraviolet receptor
is an optical, achromatic retarder, converting incoming circularly
polarized light to linearly or elliptically polarized light that passes
through to the underlying polarization receptors (Chiou et al.
2008b; Roberts et al. 2009). Simply put, it converts light that the po-
larization receptors would not normally discriminate from unpolar-
ized light into discriminable light. The efficiency of the conversion

 depends on the length of the ultraviolet receptor, but at typical
lengths the efficiency is fairly high (Roberts et al. 2009). The end re-
sult is a circular polarization analyzing system without a circularly
polarized stimulus to analyze. Due to the often incomplete conver-
sion of circular to linear polarization, the ellipticity of the light
entering the linear polarization receptors is high enough to permit
them to continue to detect its linear polarization content, while also
responding to occasional circular polarization.
The circularly polarized signal is also not difficult to produce, as
many arthropods besides mantis shrimps and dung beetles reflect
circularly polarized light produced by several distinct mechanisms
(Neville and Caveney 1969; Neville and Luke 1971). In the case of
stomatopods, the chitin of the cuticle often is fortified with calcite,
an optically active form of calcium carbonate. In combination with
the linear polarization passing through astaxanthin-based dichroic
polarizers, this can form a circularly polarized signal. So it appears
that the preconditions for circularly polarized signaling probably
existed in these creatures, and signals evolved more or less by the
fortuitous coincidence of there being an accidental sensory modality
and a strange optical structure in the cuticle available to build a
unique signaling system.
Summary and Conclusions
Animals convert depolarized environmental light to polarized light
by a surprising diversity of optical mechanisms. Polarization pat-
terns
and
polarized-light-producing
structures
are
widespread
and diverse among animals; many of these are likely to be used for

right circular polarization dominates (credit: T.-H. Chiou). (D) Circular polarization reflections from an individual of the Indopacific stomatopod Gonodactylaceus

 signaling. Most such structures provide horizontal polarization,
which is consistent with the hypothesis of evolution by sensory drive
since many polarization-related behaviors similarly involve horizon-
tally polarized light. At this point, all examples of possible polariza-
tion signals are drawn from arthropods (butterflies and mantis
shrimp) and cephalopods (primarily cuttlefish), and it will be im-
portant to extend the field to other taxa to know more about the
biological extent of the use of polarization in communication. In
addition, the huge majority of examples come from marine animals,
specifically cephalopods and mantis shrimps. This suggests that po-
larization signaling is particularly useful in an environment that
varies enormously in illumination and spectrum, but that has a fairly
constant polarization content (Cronin et al. 2003). The connection
to marine animals is particularly interesting because they do not nor-
mally reflect polarized light without specializations because of the
weak specular reflectivity of surfaces in water, yet they have evolved
exotic mechanisms to produce polarizations. The disproportionate
expression of polarization reflective patterns in forest-dwelling nym-
phalid butterflies (Douglas et al. 2007) is consistent with the idea
that polarization signaling is favored in dim environments.
The primary research tasks that demand attention now include
the demonstration of polarization signaling in other kinds of ani-
mals besides butterflies, mantis shrimps, and cuttlefishes. Many
insects, crustaceans, and cephalopods have polarization vision and
might benefit from its use in communication. Further, we need rigor-
ous demonstrations that the hypothesized signals are actually used
to communicate and that their polarization content is a critical com-
ponent of communication. A third avenue for research is a better
understanding of the function and use of circularly polarized signals.
In the future, signals based on polarized light may be equally fruitful
subjects for study as color signals are today.
