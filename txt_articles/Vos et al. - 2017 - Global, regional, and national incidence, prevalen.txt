Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and 
years lived with disability for 328 diseases and injuries for 
195 countries, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators*
Summary
Background As mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases 
and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, 
and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.
Methods We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal 
consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring 
consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, 
we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were 
estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for 
comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of 
income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and 
Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).
Findings Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major 
depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57·6 million (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 40·8–75·9 million [7·2%, 6·0–8·3]), 45·1 million (29·0–62·8 million [5·6%, 4·0–7·2]), 36·3 million 
(25·3–50·9 million [4·5%, 3·8–5·3]), 34·7 million (23·0–49·6 million [4·3%, 3·5–5·2]), and 34·1 million 
(23·5–46·0 million [4·2%, 3·2–5·3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined 
decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2·7% (95% UI 2·3–3·1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the 
absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly 
because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of 
YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined 
were 10·4% (95% UI 9·0–11·8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer’s disease 
and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the 
main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use 
disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted 
much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a 
less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate 
(China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95% UI 6862–11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018–19 228).
Interpretation The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in 
age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some 
causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases 
steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the 
interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-to-
date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate 
health-system response.

Introduction
Assessment of death rates by cause has been an essential 
component of tracking progress in global health. The 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) emphasised 
child, maternal, and infectious disease mortality and 
spurred investments that contributed to a rapid decline 
in mortality from these sources, although these have 
not been universally achieved at the same level.1,2 
Progress in reducing the disabling outcomes of disease 
has been much slower.3 The Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) 
estimated a modest 2·1% reduction in the age-
standardised rate of years lived with disability (YLDs) 
for all causes compared with a 22·7% reduction in age-
standardised rates of years of life lost (YLLs) for all 
causes between 2005 and 2015.3 The slower progress in 
addressing non-fatal compared with fatal health 
outcomes and ageing of populations make YLDs an 
increasingly important component of global disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs). In some high-income 
countries with advanced ageing, YLDs already make up 
more than half of the total burden in DALYs.4 The GBD 
Study is the only global effort to quantify non-fatal 
outcomes using a metric that allows comparisons 
between fatal and non-fatal outcomes of a comprehensive 
list of diseases and injuries.
Research in Context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) produces the only assessment of prevalence, incidence, 
and years lived with disability (YLDs) for a comprehensive list of 
diseases and injuries, and for all countries from 1990 to the 
present. The World Health Organization has published YLD 
estimates for the years 2000–15 largely based on GBD 2015 
results apart from ad hoc changes applied to selected disability 
weights and the prevalence of a small subset of causes. GBD 
2016 is a reassessment of the burden of disease due to 
non-fatal diseases and injuries and updates the GBD 2015 
study results.
Added value of this study
This study adds new knowledge about YLD rates globally and 
improves upon prior iterations of the GBD study in seven ways. 
First, new data were incorporated based on 56 356 unique data 
sources; these were composed mainly of peer-reviewed scientific 
literature identified by systematic reviews, reports from 
statistical agencies or ministries of health, household surveys, 
administrative data systems, claims data, and hospital data. In 
2016, we had 14 521 sources from the scientific literature 
compared with 10 478 such sources used in GBD 2015. Our 
network of collaborators provided 2598 data sources for GBD 
2016 compared with 968 available for GBD 2015;  furthermore, 
3430 sources of survey data were used in GBD 2016. These 
counts reflect our updated counting criteria for GBD 2016. Large 
amounts of new data for the main causes of YLDs were identified 
through our collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical 
Research and the Public Health Foundation of India. For 
particular diseases, the volume of available data increased 
substantially. Examples include Rapid Assessment of Avoidable 
Blindness surveys and the detailed studies reported in the Global 
Atlas of Helminth Infection for schistosomiasis and lymphatic 
filariasis. Second, we substantially changed the modelling 
approach for some diseases, such as cancers and tuberculosis. For 
cancer we improved our analysis of mortality-to-incidence ratios, 
resulting in considerably higher ratios in lower 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) locations and thus lower YLD 
estimates. We also applied mortality-to-incidence ratios in the 
analysis of tuberculosis to better predict the gap between true 
incidence and notified cases—ie, undetected cases. Third, 
estimation at the subnational level was newly developed for 
Indonesia, and estimates for England were disaggregated into 
those for 150 local government areas. Fourth, we have 
disaggregated several causes to separately estimate 
drug-sensitive, multidrug-resistant, and extensively 
drug-resistant tuberculosis; latent tuberculosis infection; 
alcoholic cardiomyopathy; urogenital, musculoskeletal, and 
digestive congenital anomalies; and self-harm by firearm, to 
provide more detail within the GBD cause hierarchy. Additionally, 
Guinea worm disease was estimated due to the fact that there is 
policy interest in eradication, which is feasible in the near future. 
Sexual violence was added as a non-fatal cause of YLDs because 
of its relevance to several of the new sustainable development 
goal (SDG) targets. Fifth, we were able to incorporate inpatient 
hospital data by cause for 222 more locations and a final total of 
3557 location-years. A separate analysis of total hospital 
admissions per capita by country, year, age, and sex allowed the 
use of hospital data sources that previously had been rejected 
because of incomplete knowledge about catchment populations. 
We extended our analyses of US medical claims data to impute a 
ratio of any health service contact for a diagnosis to inpatient 
episodes for chronic diseases that we applied to hospital 
inpatient data from elsewhere to predict prevalence. Sixth, we 
have extended our analyses of GBD results by SDI with new ways 
of presenting and visualising changes over time and the 
relationship with development. Seventh, we extended the 
terminal age group used in our analyses of older than 80 years 
into 80–84, 85–89, 90–94, and older than 95 years.
Implications of all the available evidence
 As countries confront the effects of the epidemiological 
transition, there will be an increased need for up-to-date 
assessment of non-fatal health outcomes and exploration of 
the implications of growing numbers of individuals in need of 
chronic care as populations age. The GBD study provides 
opportunities to identify important non-fatal health trends 
across various locations and levels of development, and to 
assess the strength of available estimates.

There are several challenges in standardising the 
estimation of YLDs. For example, case definitions vary; 
there are diverse data sources and study methods; 
accessible data sources are sparse for many diseases, 
with large parts of the world lacking adequate data;  and 
data for severity of outcomes are limited and lack a 
standardised approach. This annual update of the GBD 
study provides an opportunity to incorporate new data 
and improved methods within a standardised framework 
to enhance the precision and accuracy of estimation.
The 
extensive 
GBD 
network 
of 
more 
than 
2518 collaborators from 133 countries and three non-
sovereign locations have provided invaluable critiques of 
methods and helped to identify new data sources. Most of 
the debates arising from GBD 2015 have come as direct 
communications from the collaborative network or have 
been published by collaborators and other researchers. 
For example, collaborators have addressed omissions in 
the GBD cause list,5–10 challenged the GBD hierarchy of 
causes,11 or explored the continual debate regarding 
disability weights.12 There is also a growing scientific 
literature on secondary analyses of GBD results—eg, with 
a focus on chronic kidney disease,13 oral diseases,14 or 
cardiovascular disease among the poorest billion.15
The primary objective of the non-fatal component of 
GBD 2016 was to estimate prevalence, incidence, and 
YLDs for 328 GBD causes from 1990 to 2016. For each 
cycle of GBD, the entire time series is re-estimated to 
incorporate new data and methods; thus, these results 
supersede previous GBD results. We explore the patterns 
of non-fatal disease over time and in comparison to 
expected levels based on an index of sociodemographic 
development.
Methods
Overview
The GBD study provides a standardised analytical 
approach for estimating incidence, prevalence, and YLDs 
by age, sex, cause, year, and location. We aim to use all 
accessible information on disease occurrence, natural 
history, and severity that passes minimum inclusion 
criteria set disease-by-disease (appendix 1, p 33). Our 
approach is to optimise the comparability of data 
collected by varying methods or different case definitions; 
find a consistent set of estimates between data for 
prevalence, incidence, and causes of death; and predict 
estimates for locations with sparse or absent data by 
borrowing information from other locations and using 
covariates.
In this study, we use different methods to reflect the 
available data and specific epidemiology of each dis-
ease. Our main approach is to combine all sources of 
information for a disease using the Bayesian meta-
regression tool DisMod-MR 2.1.16 Subsequently, we 
use data for severity, the occurrence of particular con-
sequences of diseases, or sequelae, to establish the 
proportion of prevalent cases experiencing each sequela. 
Several broad classes of alternative approaches are used 
within the GBD study. First, for injuries, non-fatal 
estimates must account for the cause of injury (eg, a fall), 
the nature of injury (eg, a fracture or head injury), the 
amount of disability arising in the short term, and 
permanent disability for a subset of cases. Second, cancers 
were estimated by assessing the association between 
mortality and incidence, taking into account the effect on 
survival of access to, and quality of, treatment for the 
cancer site. Third, we combined the natural history model 
strategy for HIV
/AIDS with the DisMod-MR 2.1 modelling 
approach for tuberculosis as HIV infection affects 
outcomes in patients who also have tuberculosis. Fourth, 
models for malaria, hepatitis, and varicella relied on data 
of the presence of circulating antibodies or parasites in the 
blood to predict the incidence of clinical episodes for which 
we estimate disability. Fifth, neonatal disorders were esti-
mated from birth prevalence data and cohort studies on 
the risk of death in the first month and the probability of 
long-term disabling outcomes. Sixth, incidence of rabies, 
whooping cough, diphtheria, and tetanus was estimated 
from cause-specific mortality rates and data on the case 
fatality of acute episodes (appendix 1, p 33).
Below we describe these modelling efforts organised into 
eight sections; the supplementary methods (appendix 1, 
p 1) presents a single source for additional detail of inputs, 
analytical processes, outputs, and methods specific to each 
cause. This study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate 
and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) 
recommendations (appendix 1, p 723).17
1. Geographic units and time periods
The GBD 2016 study was based on a geographic hierarchy 
that includes 195 countries and territories grouped 
within 21 regions and seven GBD super-regions 
(appendix 1, p 726). For this publication, we present 
subnational estimates in figures and only for Brazil, 
China, India, and the USA. Details of subnational 
estimates will be reported in separate publications.
Cause-specific estimation in GBD 2016 was done for 
the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2006, 2010, and 2016 and 
interpolated to get a full time series. In view of policy 
priorities, a subset of results focus on change over the 
time period 2006–16. Results from GBD 2016 by year and 
location can be explored further in dynamic data 
visualisations.
2. GBD cause list
In the GBD Study, causes and their sequelae are 
collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive and are 
organised in a hierarchy with five levels. Level 1 contains 
three broad cause groups: communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional diseases; non-communicable 
diseases; and injuries. These are broken down into 
21 Level 2 causes with further disaggregation into 
163 Level 3 causes and 271 Level 4 causes. Sequelae of 
these causes are represented at Level 5 of the hierarchy.

For GBD 2016, we expanded the list of causes of non-fatal 
outcomes from 310 to 328. This involved the refinement of 
certain Level 3 causes into new Level 4 causes, includ-
ing disaggregation of tuberculosis and HIV- tuberculosis 
into drug-susceptible tuberculosis, multidrug- 
resistant 
tuber 
culosis, extensively drug-resistant tuber 
culosis, and 
latent tuberculosis infection. Cardiomyopathy and myo-
carditis were further refined as alcoholic cardiomyopathy, 
myocarditis, and other cardio 
myopathy. Other leukaemia 
was added as an additional sub-cause at Level 4. Self-harm 
was separated into self-harm by firearm and self-harm by 
other means. The previously named cause grouping 
“collective violence and legal intervention” was divided into 
two Level 4 causes: executions and police conflict. New 
causes of non-fatal outcomes added to the GBD hierarchy 
for 2016 included Zika virus disease; musculoskeletal, 
urogenital, and digestive congenital anomalies; Guinea 
worm disease; and sexual violence. Medication overuse 
headache was removed as a cause and, instead, char-
acterised as a sequela of migraine and tension-type 
headache.
3. Sources of data
The first step in non-fatal estimation was the compilation 
of data sources from systematic data and literature 
searches conducted by cause. This process resulted in 
4043 published studies newly included in GBD 2016, 
leading to a total of 14 521. Our network of collaborators 
for GBD 2016 provided 2598 data sources and studies. 
These were systematically screened, together with sources

suggested by country-level experts, surveys located in 
multinational survey data catalogues, and Ministry of 
Health and Central Statistical Office websites. We 
analysed 18 792 sources of epidemiological surveillance 
data (country-years of disease reporting), up from 14 081 
in 2015. All counts reflect our updated counting criteria 
for GBD 2016. The supplementary methods provides 
details of data adjust 
ments, correction factors, and 
standardisations employed in incorporating these 
different data types (appendix 1, p 18).
The number of location-years of hospital inpatient data 
by cause increased from 1176 in GBD 2015 to 3557 in 
GBD 2016. This increase can be attributed to the addition 
of new years of data for some locations, as well as newly 
incorporated data for 16 countries where we had 
previously lacked clear information about the population 
covered. To allow their use in GBD, we first collated 
information from surveys and hospital administrative 
records to estimate hospital admission rates per capita 
for all GBD locations by age and sex, from 1990 to 2016, 
using DisMod-MR 2.1 (appendix 1, p 7). We then used 
inpatient data by cause from locations with unclear 
denominators as cause fractions of the all-cause inpatient 
admission rates. Three adjustment factors were derived 
from USA health insurance claims data on more than 80 
million person-years of coverage. The first factor 
corrected for multiple inpatient episodes for the same 
cause in an individual. The second adjustment was to 
include secondary diagnostic fields. The third adjustment 
was to include any mention of a cause in inpatient or 
outpatient episodes of care as opposed to inpatient 
episodes with a primary diagnosis only. This new method 
of predicting prevalence or incidence from inpatient data 
allowed us to use these sources for 16 more causes than 
in 2015. The supplementary methods provides a detailed 
description of our process for inpatient data (appendix 1, 
p 11).
To provide a summary view on data availability, the 
number of causes at the most detailed level for which we 
have any prevalence or incidence data from 1980 to 2016 
by location is presented in the appendix (appendix 1, 
p 722). An online search tool is available to view all data 
sources that were used in the estimation process for each 
cause.
4. Non-fatal disease models
Non-fatal diseases were modelled using DisMod-MR 2.1, 
a statistical method that synthesises sparse and 
heterogeneous epidemiological data for non-fatal out-
comes. Estimation occurred at five levels: global, super-
region, region, country, and subnational locations, with 
results from a higher level providing guidance for the 
analysis at a lower geographical level (appendix 1, p 18).
Custom models were created where DisMod-MR 2.1 
does not capture the complexity of the disease, or if 
incidence and prevalence needed to be calculated from 
other data. Further details of these custom models can 
be found in the supplementary methods (appendix 1, 
p 18). Prevalence was estimated for nine impairments, 
disorders that are sequelae of multiple diseases and for 
which there were better data available to estimate the 
overall occurrence than for each underlying cause: 
anaemia, intellectual disability, epilepsy, hearing loss, 
vision loss, heart failure, infertility, pelvic inflammatory 
disease, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
The methods for estimating YLDs from a number of 
diseases changed substantially for GBD 2016. We 
improved our estimation of mortality-to-incidence ratios 
for cancers to better reflect lower survival probabilities in 
low-income and middle-income locations based on each 
location’s Socio-demographic Index (SDI) value. As a 
consequence, our prevalence and YLD estimates were 
lower in those locations but did not change much for 
higher-SDI locations. We made major changes to our 
modelling of tuberculosis. First, we made explicit 
estimates of latent tuberculosis infection from tuberculin 
skin testing data and the risk of developing active 
tuberculosis by induration size. Second, we predicted 
mortality-to-incidence ratios in locations with high data-
quality ratings (4-star or 5-star using a system developed 
for the GBD 2016 causes of death estimation)18 and SDI 
as a covariate. We anchored the lower end of the SDI 
scale with a datapoint from an untreated cohort of 
pulmonary tuberculosis cases in the 1960s, half of whom 
had died after five years.18,19 Third, we estimated incidence 
from these mortality-to-incidence ratios in all locations 
except those with higher reported notifications. Fourth, 
we modelled these incidence estimates as well as the 
prevalence data from surveys in low-income and middle-
income countries and cause-specific mortality rates 
among the proportion of the population with latent 
infection in DisMod-MR 2.1. Fifth, we estimated the 
proportions of tuberculosis cases with multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis or extensively drug-resistant tuber-
culosis from notification and survey data and included 
an increased risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 
HIV
/AIDS-infected patients with tuber 
culosis from a 
meta-analysis.20
In our measles estimation strategy, we included the 
coverage of measles-containing vaccine second-dose 
(MCV2) rather than just the coverage of the primary 
vaccine as a covariate. As relatively few countries in sub-
Saharan Africa have introduced MCV2, the estimated 
incidence for those locations is notably higher compared 
with previous estimates.
5. Severity distributions and disability weights
For 214 causes at Level 4 of the GBD hierarchy, sequelae 
were defined in terms of severity, usually graded as mild, 
moderate, or severe outcomes. We followed the same 
approach as in GBD 2015. For Zika virus disease, we 
included sequelae for those with symptomatic acute 
infection, a small proportion with Guillain-Barré 
syndrome, and the number of neonates with congenital

Zika virus disease as reported to the Pan American 
Health Organization (PAHO). For sexual violence, we 
estimated YLDs associated with concurrent physical 
injuries and the short-term psychological outcomes 
following sexual violence.
A more substantial change in estimating severity was 
applied to stroke. A systematic review was done to collect 
data on modified Rankin scores, a measure of neurological 
disability.21 Levels of Rankin score were analysed in 
DisMod-MR 2.1 and mapped to the existing GBD health 
state lay descriptions for mild, moderate, and severe motor 
impairment from stroke, and, separately, the proportion of 
stroke patients with moderate-to-severe motor impairment 
who also experienced cognitive impairment. For GBD 2016 
we used the same disability weights as in GBD 2013 and 
GBD 2015; the supplementary methods provides a 
complete listing of lay descriptions of all 235 health states 
used in GBD 2016 (appendix 1, p 799).
6. Comorbidity
We estimated comorbidity by simulating 40 000 individuals 
in every location-age-sex-year combination as exposed to 
the independent probability, based on the prevalence of 
the sequelae included in GBD 2016. In simulants with 
two or more sequelae, we assumed a multiplicative 
function to combine disability weights and then 
distributed the reduced combined weight proportionately 
among all comorbid sequelae. Averaging these adjusted 
values across all simulants with a particular sequela gave 
the adjusted value of YLDs. There was no change in the 
approach compared with GBD 2015.
7. YLD computation
All computations in GBD were done 1000 times, every 
time drawing from the distribution of the sampling 
error of data inputs, the uncertainty of data corrections 
for measurement errors, the uncertainty in coefficients 
from model fit (eg, in DisMod-MR 2.1), and the 
uncertainty of severity distributions and disability 
weights. Uncertainty bounds for a quantity of interest 
were defined by the 25th and 975th value of the ordered 
1000 estimate values. If there was a change in disease 
estimates between locations or over time that was in the 
same direction in more than 950 of the 1000 samples we 
report it as significant. Age-standardised prevalence 
YLD rates were calculated based on the GBD reference 
population.22
The GBD cause hierarchy is comprehensive and 
includes 35 residual disease categories to capture YLDs 
from conditions for which we do not currently make 
separate estimates. For 22 of these residual categories, 
we made explicit epidemiological estimates of prevalence 
and incidence, and define sequelae based on the most 
common diseases in the Level 2 or 3 cause group and 
severity distributions from the Medical Expenditure 
Panel Survey (MEPS).23 For 13 residual categories, we 
had no epidemiological data and estimated YLDs from 
the ratio of YLDs to YLLs from explicitly modelled 
diseases in the cause category, assuming that relative to 
each death, the number of YLDs was similar to that of 
other diseases at the same level of the GBD hierarchy 
(appendix 1, p 29).
8. SDI and epidemiological transition
SDI is a summary measure that places all GBD locations 
on a spectrum of socioeconomic development.24 The SDI 
was developed for GBD 2015 to provide a comparable 
metric of overall development. This was achieved by 
using an equal weighting of lag-distributed income per 
capita, average years of education in the population over 
age 15 years, and total fertility rate.22 For GBD 2016, we 
modified the estimation of SDI by taking into 
consideration that SDI scales were subject to change 
based on increasing geographic units and an extended 
time period of analysis, affecting the interpretability 
across GBD iterations. We redefined the values of zero 
and one for each component of the index: zero now 
represents the level below which we have not observed 
GDP per capita or educational attainment or above which 
we have not observed the total fertility rate in known 
datasets. Maximum scores for educational attainment 
and Lagged Distributed Income represent a plateau in 
the relationship between each of the two components 
and life expectancy or under-5 mortality rates, suggesting 
no additional benefit. Analogously, the maximum score 
for total fertility rate represents the minimum level at 
which the relationship with the selected health outcomes 
plateaued. An SDI value was generated for each location 
and year as the geometric mean of each component 
score. Five SDI quintiles, high, high-middle, middle, 
low-middle, and low, were selected based on 2016 values 
of SDI; additional details are available in the 
supplementary methods (appendix 1).22
A Gaussian process regression was used to evaluate 
the average relationship for each age-sex-cause group, 
for cause-specific YLD rates on SDI at Levels 1, 2, and 3 
of the GBD cause hierarchy using data from 1990 
to 2016. These rates were used as the expected values for 
cause-specific YLD rates at a given level of SDI. 
Additional detail on this analysis is available in the 
supplementary methods (appendix 1, p 30) and in 
previous GBD publications.18
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or the 
writing of the report. All authors had full access to 
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.

and percent change of age-standardised YLD rates 
from 2006 to 2016 are listed in the table. Cause-specific 
estimates for each year of the GBD estimation period 
1990–2016 by location, age, and sex are available through 
an online results tool.
Prevalence
In 2016, the ten causes with the greatest prevalence were 
caries of permanent teeth (2·44 billion, 95% UI 
2·29 billion to 2·59 billion), latent tuberculosis infection 
(1·91 billion, 1·79 billion to 2·03 billion), tension-type 
headache (1·89 billion, 1·71 billion to 2·10 billion), age-
related and other hearing loss (1·27 billion, 1·21 billion to 
1·34 billion), iron-deficiency anaemia (1·24 billion cases, 
1·21 billion to 1·28 billion), migraine (1·04 billion, 
1·00 billion to 1·09 billion), glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) trait (866 million, 
852 million to 882 million), genital herpes (860 million, 
748 million to 992 million), refraction and accommodation 
disorders (854 million, 822 million to 886 million), and 
ascariasis (800 million, 738 million to 872 million; table). 
The vast majority of cases for two of these causes are 
asymptomatic sequelae that have no YLDs associated 
with them: genital herpes with no active lesions, and 
G6PD trait that does not result in anaemia. Similarly, 
latent tuberculosis infection is a highly prevalent cause 
but without any associated disability. The leading ten 
causes 
of 
prevalence 
accounted 
for 
17·5% 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 15·8–19·3) of YLDs 
globally in 2016.
Incidence
In 2016, the ten causes with the highest incidence were 
upper respiratory infections (17·78 billion, 15·85 billion 
to 19·90 billion), caries of permanent teeth (7·26 billion, 
6·72 billion to 7·84 billion), diarrhoeal diseases 
(4·48 billion, 4·25 billion to 4·74 billion), fungal skin 
diseases (2·10 billion, 1·88 billion to 2·34 billion), caries 
of deciduous teeth (1·76 billion, 1·26 billion to 
2·39 billion), tension-type headache (1·06 billion, 
899 million to 1·24 billion), other sense organ diseases 
(708 million, 668 million to 754 million), other skin and 
subcutaneous diseases (634 million, 617 million to 
652 million), vitamin A deficiency (552 million, 
469 million to 671 million), and pyoderma (474 million, 
461 million to 489 million; table). These ten causes of 
incidence accounted for 4·4% (3·7–5·6) of all YLDs 
globally in 2016.
Overall global numbers of YLDs and trends 2006–2016
Globally, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional deficiency diseases accounted for 12·6% 
(95% UI 11·3–14·0) of YLDs in 2016 (101·5 million, 
 
72·3 million to 136·9 million), while NCDs accounted 
for 80·6% (78·2–82·5) or 648·6 million (481·3 million 
to 836·5 million) of YLDs and injuries accounted 
for 6·9% (5·6–8·4) or 55·4 million (37·2 million to 
78·7 
million) 
of 
YLDs 
(table). 
In 
2016, 
the 
age-standardised YLD rate for all causes was lowest in 
China at 9201 YLDs per 100 000 (95% UI 6862–11 943 
per 100 000); Yemen had the highest age-standardised 
YLD rate at 14 774 YLDs per 100 000 (11 018–19 228 
per 100 000). 
Figure 1C shows the change in global YLDs over time 
in three ways: mean percentage change in number of 
YLDs, mean percentage change in all-age rates, and 
mean percentage change in age-standardised YLD 
rates from 1990 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2016. The 
mean percentage change in the number of YLDs 
reflects the combined effects of population growth, 
population ageing, and epidemiological change. 
Population ageing and epidemiological change explain 
the mean percentage change in all-age rates. The mean 
percent change in age-standardised YLD rates reflects 
epidemiological change that is not due to ageing or 
population growth. All top-30 YLD causes increased in 
the number of YLDs between 1990 and 2016. Alcohol 
use disorder, major depressive disorder, and refraction 
and accommodation errors had the largest declines in 
age-standardised YLD rates from 2006 to 2016 but the 
change did not exceed 5%. Preterm birth complications 
had the largest increase in age-standardised YLD 
rates, 8·5%. Among the top 30 causes of YLDs, the 
difference between the change in all-age and age-
standardised rates between 2006 and 2016 was 10% or 
greater for age-related and other hearing loss, dia-
betes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
osteoarthritis, ischaemic stroke, edentulism, and 
ischaemic heart disease, indicating that these diseases 
largely affect the elderly and therefore become 
more prominent causes of YLDs in an ageing global 
population.
Low back pain and migraine were the leading causes 
of YLDs in high-income, high-middle-income, and 
middle-SDI quintile countries, but iron-deficiency 
anaemia was the leading cause in low-middle-SDI and 
low-SDI quintiles in 2016 (appendix 2, p 14). Low back 
pain, migraine, and age-related and other hearing loss 
were in the top five causes of YLDs in all SDI quintiles. 
Major depressive disorders appeared in the top five in 
all quintiles but the middle, where it was displaced by 
diabetes. Neck pain was a top five cause of YLDs in 
high-income, high-middle-income, and middle-SDI 
quintiles. In 2016, 28 of the 30 leading causes of age-
standardised YLD rates for high-SDI countries were 
NCDs, versus 23 out of 30 in low-SDI countries. 
Between 2006 and 2016, there were large drops in age-
standardised rates of YLDs for malaria, HIV/AIDS, 
onchocerciasis, and schistosomiasis in the low-SDI 
quintile.
Leading causes of YLDs by age-standardised rates
For men, the most common leading detailed cause of 
YLDs in 2016 was low back pain, resulting in the

highest age-standardised rates of YLDs in 133 of 
195 countries and territories, including every country 
in the high-income regions, central and eastern 
Europe, central Asia, Andean and Tropical Latin 
America, and eastern and central sub-Saharan Africa, 
as well as most countries in southeast Asia, north 
Africa and the Middle East, and western sub-Saharan 
Africa. Diabetes, the second most common leading 
cause of YLD rates for men, ranked first in 38 countries 
in Central Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and 
North Africa and the Middle East. Iron-deficiency 
anaemia was the leading cause in India, Bhutan, 
Sudan, Yemen, and Mali. HIV/AIDS was the leading 
cause in South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, 
and Botswana.
In 2016, low back pain was the leading cause of age-
standardised YLD rates for women in 104 of the 195 
countries and territories (figure 2B). It was the main 
cause of YLDs in almost all high-income, central Europe, 
eastern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and 
Andean and Tropical Latin American countries. Iron-
deficiency anaemia was the leading cause for women 
(35 countries), followed by migraine and diabetes 
in 24 and 17 countries, respectively. HIV
/AIDS was the 
lead 
ing cause in southern sub-Saharan Africa, Zambia, 
and Malawi.

Trends for the number of YLDs (in millions) and age-
standardised YLD rates from 1990 to 2016 at Level 1 of the 
GBD cause hierarchy are shown by SDI quintile in 
figure 3. Generally, there was little or no change in the 
age-standardised rates of YLDs for NCDs, com 
municable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes, or injuries, 
apart from a decrease in communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional YLD rates be 
tween 2000 
and 2016 in the low-SDI quintile. The large increase in 
total YLD numbers for NCDs reflects the combined 
effect of population growth, ageing, and epidemiological

Causes are connected by arrows between time periods; solid lines are increases and dashed lines are decreases. For the time period 1990–2006 and for 2006–16, three measures of change are 
shown: percentage change of counts, percentage change in the all-age rate, and percentage change in the age-standardised rate. Statistically significant changes are shown in bold. Solid lines are 
increases in rank and dashed lines are decreases in rank. YLDs=years lived with disability. G6PD=glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. UTI=urinary tract infection. COPD=chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease.

change. NCDs contributed the most YLDs at each SDI 
quintile, followed by communicable, maternal, neonatal, 
and nutritional causes and injuries, with exceptions for 
high 
and 
high-middle 
quintiles, 
where 
injuries 
contributed more YLDs than com 
municable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional causes in 2016. This was 
particularly the case at the highest level of SDI, where 
YLDs from communicable, mat 
ernal, neonatal, and 
nutritional causes and injuries represented only a small 
fraction of overall YLDs.
YLD pattern by age and sex
Between 1990 and 2016 the number of YLDs for 
21 Level 2 causes increased, particularly in the 40–69 
year age range (figure 4). In childhood, other NCDs 
(skin diseases being the largest contributor in this 
category), nutritional deficiencies, infectious diseases, 
and mental and sub 
stance use disorders were the main 
causes of YLDs. After childhood, NCDs were the 
dominant source of YLDs. Mental and substance use 
disorders were the largest contributors to disability in 
young adults, while at older ages, other NCDs (with 
hearing loss and vision loss being the largest con-
tributors to this category), musculo 
skeletal dis 
orders, 
and cardiovascular diseases were the most important 
causes. YLDs from injuries were largest between ages 20 
and 69 years.
YLD rates were higher in males than in females at ages 
under 10 years and between ages 75 and 94 years 
(figure 5). At all other ages, all-cause YLD rates were 
higher in females. Boys had higher YLD rates for mental 
disorders (particularly conduct disorder and autism), 
while girls had higher YLD rates for other non-
communicable diseases (most of this difference is 
explained by higher YLD rates from dermatitis). At ages 
over 10 years, musculoskeletal disorders contributed 
most to higher YLD rates in females. The next two cause 
groups with higher YLD rates in females were neuro-
logical disorders (particularly migraine and, at older 
ages, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias) and 
nutritional deficiencies (mostly iron-deficiency anaemia). 
The sex differences in mental and substance use 
disorders were small, with slightly elevated rates in 
younger males, and somewhat higher rates in older

females. The small overall sex difference masks much 
higher YLD rates from depressive disorder and anxiety in 
females and higher YLD rates from injuries, substance 
use disorders, and autism spectrum disorders in males. 
Adult males older than 55 years had higher YLD rates 
from diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine disorders 
(diabetes and benign prostatic hyperplasia being the 
main drivers of differences), injuries, chronic respiratory 
diseases, and cancers.
Rates of YLDs and change in rates of YLDs by cause
Figure 6 shows the annualised rates of change in age-
standardised YLD rates between 2006 and 2016, with 
Level 3 causes against age-standardised YLD rates 
presented on a log-scale from right to left. 15 causes 
significantly increased by more than 1%: six cancers 
(brain 
and 
nervous 
system, 
liver, 
non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, testicular, thyroid, and other neoplasms), 
dengue, gastritis and duodenitis, leishmaniasis, neonatal 
encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, 
neonatal sepsis and other neonatal infections, other 
chronic 
respiratory 
diseases, 
other 
neurological 
disorders, peptic ulcer disease, and Zika virus disease. Of 
31 causes with declines of greater than 1·0% per year, 
25 were communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional causes and five were NCD causes. Road 
injuries was the only cause out of 30 causes with age-
standardised rates of YLDs greater than 100 per 
100 000 that significantly increased by more than 0·5% 
annually. There were no large causes with a greater than 
0·5% decrease in age-standardised YLD rates.
Leading causes of YLDs and deviations from expected 
levels based on SDI
Age-standardised YLD rates for the top ten most detailed 
causes are plotted by region and year against SDI in the 
supplementary results (appendix 2, p 4). The black solid 
line represents the expected value based on SDI. Two of 
the top ten causes, iron-deficiency anaemia and age-
related and other hearing loss show a large decline in 
expected values with increasing SDI, while the regional 
estimates are relatively close to the expected line. The 
interpretation is that much of the variation in YLD rates 
for these two causes is linked to SDI. The expected lines 
for the other top ten conditions show a less clear pattern 
with SDI while regional estimates are dispersed widely 
around the line. These graphs show that most of the 
variation in YLD rates for these leading causes of YLDs 
depends on factors other than socio 
demographic 
development, unlike the much clearer relation 
ship 
between SDI and rates of YLLs for the leading causes 
of death.18
Low back pain and migraine ranked in the top ten of 
YLDs in all 195 countries and territories in 2016. Adult-
onset hearing loss was in the top ten in 193 countries and 
territories. Major depressive disorder ranked in the top ten 
in all but four countries. Anxiety disorders, iron-deficiency 
anaemia, neck pain, diabetes, and other musculoskeletal 
disorders ranked in the top ten of more than half of the 
countries and territories (figure 7).
Apart from showing the top ten causes of YLDs by 
country, figure 7 also shows for each top ten cause the 
variation from expected values based on SDI. The cells in

in dark blue at least 50% lower values. In the high-income 
super-region, the USA had much higher than expected 
YLDs from opioid dependence. YLDs due to Alzheimer’s 
disease and other dementia were more than double what 
was expected in Italy and Japan. Greece had much higher 
than expected rates of COPD. YLDs from other 
musculoskeletal disorders were more than twice the 
expected values in Australia, Canada, Chile, Greenland, 
and the USA. Many eastern and central European 
countries had much higher than expected YLDs from falls, 
alcohol use disorders, and ischaemic stroke. Four coun-
tries in central Asia had more than twice the expected rates 
of iron-deficiency anaemia. In Latin America, YLDs from 
diabetes were more than twice the expected rate in 
Barbados, Jamaica, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Saint Vincent 
and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Virgin 
Islands. Venezuela had less than half the expected rate of 
YLDs from low back pain but more than double the 
expected rate of YLDs from diarrhoea. Haiti had higher 
than expected YLDs from asthma. YLDs from iron-
deficiency anaemia were more than double the expected 
rate in five Caribbean nations. China had more than twice 
the expected YLD rate of ischaemic stroke, while North 
Korea had more than double the expected YLD rate for 
neck pain. In the southeast Asia region, YLD rates of iron-
deficiency anaemia were more than twice the expected 
values in Maldives and Mauritius. Mauritius also had 
more than twice the expected YLD rates for diabetes and 
COPD. Thailand and the Seychelles had more than twice 
the expected rate of COPD. Timor-Leste was the only 
country in the region where lymphatic filariasis and long-
term disability from conflict ranked among the top ten 
causes of YLDs. Diabetes ranked highly in all island 
nations of Oceania with much higher YLDs than expected 
based on SDI. In North Africa and the Middle East, more 
than twice the expected YLD rates from opioid dependence 
were found in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, 
Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Palestine, Oman, Qatar, and the 
United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan and Bahrain had more 
than twice the expected YLD rates of diabetes. Long-term 
disability from injuries sustained during conflict ranked 
in the top ten for Afghanistan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq.
Iron-deficiency anaemia was much higher than expected 
in India and Bhutan. India had considerably higher than 
expected YLDs from COPD. Bangladesh was the only 
country in 2016 with YLDs from the residual category of 
other congenital anomalies in the top ten. Bhutan had 
more than double the expected YLDs from diarrhoea. 
HIV
/AIDS was the leading cause of YLDs in southern sub-
Saharan Africa. Malaria ranked in the top ten for YLDs in 
14 sub-Saharan African countries. Three neglected tropical 
diseases, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and oncho-
cerciasis, ranked in the top ten of YLDs in six, three, and 
seven sub-Saharan African countries, respectively. In 
Madagascar, protein-energy malnutrition ranked in the 
top ten. Epilepsy was a top ten cause of YLDs in Senegal 
and São Tomé and Príncipe. Much lower than expected

YLDs from iron-deficiency anaemia were found in 
Burundi, Ethiopia, and Rwanda. The long-term conse-
quences of injuries sustained during the 1994 genocide in 
Rwanda still ranked among the top ten causes of YLDs 
in 2016.
Discussion
Summary of main findings
The largest Level 2 disease groups contributing to non-
fatal burden in 2016 were mental and substance use 
disorders (18·7%, 95% UI 15·9–21·0), other NCDs 
(18·6%, 15·6–22·5), and musculoskeletal disorders 
(17·1%, 15·3–18·9), together covering more than half of 
global YLDs. Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised 
rates, the number of YLDs from NCDs grew rapidly in all 
the SDI quintiles, due to population growth and ageing. 
Across all causes of YLDs, age-standardised rates of 
YLDs decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2·7% (95% UI 
2·3–3·1) in contrast to the 39·1% (37·8–40·2) decrease 
in YLL rates over the same time period.18 Thus, the 
relative contribution of YLD to the overall burden of 
disease in DALYs increased from 21·7% (17·2–26·6) 
in 1990 to 33·5% (27·4–39·7) in 2016.
Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined 
were 10·4% (9·0–11·8) higher in women compared to 
men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer’s 
disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, 
anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout 
were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD 
rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of 
substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, 
cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence.
Globally, we found much less geographical variation 
in disability than has been documented for premature 
mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two-fold 
difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes 
between the location with the lowest (China, 9201 YLDs 
per 100 000, 95% UI 6862–11 943 per 100 000) and 
highest rates (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 
11 018–19 228 per 100 000). By contrast, there was a 
greater than tenfold range in age-standardised rates of 
YLLs between countries in GBD 2016.18 Two other 
countries with mainly Chinese populations, Singapore 
and Taiwan (Province of China), were ranked second 
and fourth lowest in terms of age-standardised YLD 
rates, respectively. The low YLD rates in China were 
largely determined by much lower prevalence of 
headaches, musculoskeletal disorders (in particular low 
back pain), major depressive disorder, iron-deficiency 
anaemia, falls, and anxiety. Low rates of reporting 
chronic pain and low prevalence of depressive disorder 
and anxiety in China and among Chinese immigrants 
elsewhere have frequently been reported, but these 
findings may partly be explained by standard diag-
nostic tools inadequately detecting cases in the Chinese 
and cultural differences in the perception and com-
munication of pain.25–29
Trends across the causes of YLD were also different. 
For example, age-standardised YLD rates for NCDs were 
stagnant between 1990 and 2016 and showed little 
variation by SDI quintile; YLD rates for communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases were highest 
at lower SDI quintiles but with a steady drop; and injury 
YLD rates showed modest declines since 1990. Over the 
same 
period, 
age-standardised 
YLL 
rates 
of 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
diseases rapidly declined, particularly in lower SDI 
quintiles. The decline in YLL rates from NCDs was

slower than the decline in communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional diseases but still substantial. 
The main causes of YLLs and YLDs were also notably 
different. Of the top 30 causes of YLLs, only seven 
appeared in the top 30 causes of YLDs (diabetes, falls, 
COPD, ischaemic stroke, neonatal preterm birth 
complication, diarrhoeal diseases, and ischaemic heart 
disease). At Level 4, 17 of the top 30 causes of YLDs were 
diseases for which we estimated no YLLs as they are not 
considered underlying causes of death.
Cross-cutting themes
The availability and quality of epidemiological data the 
GBD Study draws upon to make non-fatal estimates vary 
enormously among diseases and by location. A multitude 
of study methods and preferred case definitions pose 
challenges to making comparable estimates. A large part 
of the effort in the GBD study in making non-fatal 
estimates is to identify and correct for known sources of 
measurement error. The main classes of data sources 
each have their own limitations. Surveys can be biased by 
low response rates or by exclusion of individuals who do 
not reside in a traditional household, and may be limited 
in the capacity to properly identify cases within the 
limited diagnostic means available during a survey. 
Administrative data on health service encounters include 
only those seeking and receiving health care and are 
likely biased toward more severe disease, but may offer 
more accurate diagnostic variables than available in 
surveys. With the development of electronic medical 
records and advancements in linkage between data 
sources, non-fatal population health assessments can 
benefit tremendously if survey and administrative 
records can be linked. This would help to overcome 
many of the limitations of individual data sources: 
administrative records can provide rich diagnostic 
information, while surveys can provide better infor-
mation on cases that are not in contact with health 
services, exposure to risk factors, and health status 
measures that can provide information on severity. The 
challenges in low-income and middle-income countries 
will be to fund the data systems and infrastructure and 
development of technical expertise, and to provide access 
to generic rather than proprietary software to manage 
electronic medical record data and produce the linkages 
while preserving confidentiality.
In the GBD 2016 companion paper on causes of death18 
we reported a faster decline in age-standardised YLL rates 
for the top ten causes of YLL (ischaemic heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, 
diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, neonatal preterm birth 
complications, malaria, COPD, HIV
/AIDS, and neonatal 
encephalopathy) than for the rest of causes, globally and in 
each of the SDI quintiles. We hypothesised that a greater 
investment in large causes has led to greater improve-
ments. We did not observe an equivalent rapid decline in 
the age-standardised YLD rates for these top ten causes of 
YLLs. YLD rates for ischaemic heart disease, stroke, LRI, 
COPD, and road injuries increased by less than 10% over 
the last ten years. YLDs for diarrhoeal diseases declined by 
less than 10%. The only top ten YLL causes with a greater 
decline in YLD rates were HIV
/AIDS and malaria, though 
at a lesser pace than the change in YLL rates. Antiretroviral 
treatment greatly reduces the death rate in persons living 
with HIV but also improves the immune status of 
survivors. Thus, while there was a small increase in 
prevalence, the age-standardised YLD rate dropped by 
almost a fifth since 2006 as a larger proportion of cases 
were estimated to be in higher CD4 categories, for which 
we apply a lower disability weight. YLD rates from preterm 
birth 
compli 
cations 
and 
neonatal 
encephalopathy 
increased, while YLL rates dropped by almost a quarter. 
Improved survival through neonatal intensive care 
interventions predisposes survivors to the risk of long-
term disabling outcomes. In terms of how we measure the 
burden of disease in DALYs, this means that large gains by 
prevention of YLLs can be accompanied by a smaller 
amount of health loss in terms of YLDs in new survivors. 
Similarly, health interventions that address mortality by 
reducing the case fatality among causes of disease or 
injury may in turn lead to an increase in non-fatal 
outcomes. For example, reducing cardio 
vascular risks in 
people with diabetes will increase the prevalence of those 
with sequelae such as neuropathy or vision loss. Similarly, 
preventing death from a myo 
cardial infarction by 
revascularisation improves sur 
vival and thus exposes 
more people to heart failure as a complication.
The MDGs focused health policy on predominant 
infectious, neonatal, and maternal causes of death. The 
health-related SDGs have expanded into a number of non-
communicable diseases and injuries. However, the focus 
remains on reducing mortality rather than the main 
causes of disability. The only goals that correspond with 
non-fatal outcomes are those related to substance use 
(goal 3.5) and physical and sexual violence (goals 5.2, 11.7, 
16.1, and 16.2). Furthermore, the targets formulated on 
incidence of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis were 
included because of the large number of deaths associated 
with these infectious diseases rather than presumably out 
of concern for their non-fatal outcomes.1 Diabetes and 
opioid use disorder are the only causes in the top 20 of age-
standardised YLD rates at Level 4, globally, that are 
mentioned in the SDGs. The diabetes target, however, is 
formulated as an indicator of mortality only. The mental, 
musculoskeletal, sense organ, and neurological disorders 
that contribute to more than half of all YLDs are not 
considered. While this may partially be a bias toward 
assessing global health in terms of mortality, it may also 
reflect a perception that there is inadequate knowledge to 
address these major causes of disability. Indeed, the much 
smaller gap in YLD rates compared to the large differences 
in YLL rates between high-SDI and low-SDI countries 
suggests that the capacity to intervene in non-fatal 
outcomes is more limited.

Several threats exist that could lead to reversals in global 
health gains, such as widespread antimicrobial resis-
tance,30,31 conflict,32 climate change,33,34 and obesity.35 
Of these, obesity has the more immediately apparent 
health consequences and has a large effect on non-fatal 
outcomes such as diabetes, low back pain, and 
osteoarthritis. The increase in diabetes incidence due to 
obesity and the improved survival in people with diabetes, 
largely through prevention of deaths from cardiovascular 
complications, both contribute to increases in prevalence 
and a need for intensive long-term management to prevent 
fatal and disabling complications. Recent conflicts such as 
those  in Libya, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen are major 
health threats not only in terms of casualties but also 
because they lead to long-term physical and mental 
consequences directly related to the violence as well as the 
broader health consequences of disrupted health services 
and declining economic status.36
Important changes in GBD 2016 compared with 
GBD 2015
The intensive collaborations with countries for which we 
present subnational estimates and the expanding network 
of GBD collaborators have contributed to a 36·2% increase 
in data sources for non-fatal outcome estimates compared 
to GBD 2015, as well as greater scrutiny of our methods 
and results. In particular, the close collaboration with the 
Indian Council for Medical Research and the Public 
Health Foundation of India, and 14 disease expert groups 
convened by these partners, has greatly enhanced the 
quality of the estimates for India. There was a 
49·9% increase in non-fatal data sources in India, and 
disease experts provided access to state-level data for 
causes, while in GBD 2015 we had only access to national 
aggregates.
Increasingly, the GBD Study is making use of admin-
istrative data based on health care encounters. Public 
access to these data sources at the level of detail required 
for GBD analyses remains limited, and enormous scope 
remains to expand access to these valuable sources of 
health information in many more countries. By estimating 
total admission rates from both administrative and survey 
sources, we were able to increase the number of countries 
with available inpatient data from 26 in 2015 to 41 in 2016. 
To predict the level of disease under any type of care for 
other countries with inpatient data available, we applied 
the ratio of people with a diagnosis during inpatient and 
outpatient episodes to that of inpatient diagnoses only in 
US medical claims data. In our analyses for most 
conditions, the administrative data sources were adjusted 
to the level of a reference case set for the disease of interest. 
Thus, we make use of the detailed information on age and 
sex in these data sources while adjusting for a potential 
systematic bias compared to data sources with measure-
ments according to the reference case. For instance, our 
reference case for diabetes prevalence was the proportion 
of a population with fasting plasma glucose greater than 
7 mmol/L or on diabetes treatment in a representative 
survey. The adjustment of administrative data reflects the 
proportion of people with diabetes who may be unaware of 
their condition or who for other reasons have not contacted 
health services in the year of interest.
To estimate indicators of sexual violence for the SDGs, 
we added sexual violence as a subcause of interpersonal 
violence in the GBD hierarchy. The focus of the effort in 
GBD 2016 has been to estimate the prevalence of people 
who report sexual violence by intimate partners and other 
perpetrators in the last 12 months. For non-fatal outcomes, 
we quantified the immediate concurrent physical injuries 
and the more immediate mental health consequences. 
We realise this is a limited scope for estimating all 
relevant health loss from sexual violence. In future 
iterations of GBD we intend to include sexual violence as 
a risk factor for longer-term outcomes such as major 
depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and substance use 
disorders. Going forward, we aim to become more 
comprehensive in our estimation of violence to include 
the wider health consequences of physical violence to 
children and adults as well as bullying.
Although efforts were undertaken to update data for all 
causes of YLDs in GBD 2016, a number of sources of new 
data were especially influential in improving estimates 
for selected causes. A large number of rapid-assessment 
vision loss surveys37 contributed to an increase in the 
number of sources to measure vision loss and its 
underlying causes from 397 in 2015 to 768 in 2016, with 
data available in 75 low-SDI and middle-SDI countries. 
Likewise, the Global Atlas for Helminth Infections Project 
provided a large amount of new data for schistosomiasis 
and lymphatic filariasis.38
A new approach to fitting ensembles of distributions 
improved the estimation of anaemia by better rep-
resenting the tail end of the distributions of haemoglobin 
that most concerns our estimation of disability than can 
be derived from a single parametric distribution. This is 
important because for many surveys for which we rely on 
academic papers and survey reports we only have data for 
means and standard deviations.
The change in modelling strategy for tuberculosis was 
substantial. The new estimates of the prevalence of latent 
tuberculosis infection is of policy interest, as there are 
intervention strategies that target treatment of latent 
tuberculosis in high-risk individuals.39 It allowed us to 
model active disease among those with latent infection to 
improve the search for a consistent fit between cause of 
death rates, prevalence surveys, and notification of 
incident disease, the three main sources of epidemiological 
data on tuberculosis. Next, we estimated the association 
between SDI and the ratio of mortality to incidence, 
assuming this measure of case fatality is dependent on 
development as a proxy for quality of case finding and 
management. This provided greater alignment of mor-
tality and non-fatal estimates of tuberculosis than we have 
been able to achieve in past GBD studies.

A substantial new effort on the severity of stroke was 
the analysis of 18 studies providing Rankin score data on 
the severity of disability in stroke survivors. Thus, we 
were able to make estimates by age, sex, year, and location 
to capture greater nuances in outcomes – for example, 
reflecting differences in access to rehabilitative services.
Disease-specific considerations
The GBD study is the only source of comprehensive 
quantification of the disabling outcomes of diseases and 
injuries. For a number of diseases there are efforts to 
estimate global disease prevalence or incidence. Where 
appropriate, in the following sections on major sources of 
YLDs, comparisons with other global estimates are made; 
further detail can also be found in the supplementary 
methods (appendix 1, p 30).
Mental and substance use disorders
GBD 2016 confirms that mental and substance use 
disorders, led by depressive disorders, are a major cause 
of non-fatal burden. With age-standardised prevalence 
and YLD rates for mental and substance use disorders 
showing less than 10% change between 1990 and 2016, 
apart from bulimia YLD rates which increased by 
almost 20%, our findings show no sizeable improvement 
in population mental health over time at the global level. 
Interventions can decrease the severity or increase 
remission for certain disorders and can be effectively 
administered in low-income, middle-income, and high-
income settings.40 However, these have yet to be brought 
up to scale in most countries. Because there are no data 
measuring the severity of mental disorders in a consistent 
manner, we have been unable to capture treatment 
effects that alter severity of disease. By imposing severity 
distributions from two high-income countries only, we 
are probably underestimating the burden of mental 
disorders in countries with less access to quality care.
Musculoskeletal disorders
Low back pain and neck pain are the two largest causes of 
musculoskeletal disability; their measurement is fully 
dependent on self-report measures. In GBD, we adjust for 
variations in recall period, anatomical location, minimum 
duration of episodes, and whether activity-limiting or not. 
Although less than 40% of low back pain can be attributed 
to occupational risks or increased BMI, there are no risks 
in GBD that are linked to neck pain. The lack of predictive 
covariates raises concern that we might be assigning 
measurement error as spatial variation and that the two to 
two-and-a-half-times 
difference 
in 
age-standardised 
prevalence between locations is overestimating true 
differences in disease occurrence of these two conditions.
Diabetes
Several factors have contributed to the increase in the 
prevalence of diabetes. Ageing of populations along with 
greater exposure to lifestyle-related risk factors, most 
importantly high BMI, has increased the incidence of 
diabetes in almost all countries.41 At the same time, 
improvements in treatment of diabetes have increased 
the life expectancy among people with diabetes. The large 
increase in prevalence imposes a substantial economic 
burden on health-care systems. In the USA, diabetes was 
responsible for the largest health-care spending and the 
greatest increase over the past two decades among 
155 health conditions.42 This highlights the importance of 
development and implementation of more effective 
population-level strategies to prevent diabetes.
Dementia
Age-standardised prevalence of dementia varied four-
times  between countries. Dementia surveys generally 
have a two-step approach to identifying cases, with an 
initial screening phase followed by more intensive 
diagnostic procedures in those who screened positive. We 
scrutinised all sources of dementia and identified a wide 
range of screening and diagnostic tools, varying 
thresholds on these methods, and diagnoses made 
according to different classification systems. This made it 
impossible to identify a reference study method or case 
definition. Thus, it is likely that we are overestimating the 
variation in prevalence.
Headaches
We changed our strategy to include medication overuse 
headache as a sequela of migraine and tension-type 
headache. This led to an increase in their prevalence and 
YLD estimates, particularly for migraine as more than 
two-thirds of medication overuse headache occurs in 
people with migraine as the primary headache. Thus, 
migraine has become the second largest cause of disability 
in 2016. As limited surveys are available that report on the 
frequency and duration of headache episodes, we have not 
been able to quantify any effect of treatment.
Malaria
Globally, malaria case incidence trends estimated in 
GBD 2016 followed a very similar pattern to GBD 2015, 
where there was a gradual rise in cases until 2005 
followed by a steady decline. For all years, however, the 
updated estimates are approximately one-quarter lower 
than those from GBD 2015, reflecting mainly lower 
estimates outside Africa and in particular for India. 
Outside Africa, and for lower-burden countries within 
Africa, 
2016 
estimates 
were 
produced 
using 
a 
spatiotemporal geostatistical model. Globally, this 
improved approach led to a reduction in estimated cases 
of around 75 million (about 26% reduction) of which 
most (roughly 60 million fewer cases) were in India, with 
other notable reductions in Myanmar (roughly 11 million 
fewer), Indonesia (roughly 3 million fewer), and Pakistan 
(roughly 1 million fewer). In high-burden countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa, where the methodology remained 
similar to GBD 2015, changes were relatively modest and 
 Global Health Metrics
www.thelancet.com   Vol 390   September 16, 2017 
1247
reflected the inclusion of newly available cross-sectional 
parasite rate surveys or updates to data on malaria 
intervention coverage in recent years.
Tuberculosis
For the first time, we have estimated the prevalence of 
latent tuberculosis infection. Globally, this disease affects 
1·91 billion people (95% UI 1·79 billion to 2·03 billion) 
who are at risk of developing active disease when the 
immune system weakens through old age, HIV infection, 
diabetes, malnutrition, or excessive alcohol use. Globally, 
we estimate there were 10·4 million (9·37 million to 
11·7 million) incident cases of tuberculosis in 2016, 
which is the same as the 10·4 million cases estimated by 
WHO for 2015.43 The separate estimation of 331 000 cases 
(95% UI 293 000–373 000) of multidrug-resistant and 
19 800 
incident 
cases 
(17 300–22 600) 
of 
exten-
sively drug-resistant tuberculosis with or without HIV 
infections has great policy relevance, as the resources 
required for treatment of resistant cases are many times 
greater given that treatment needs to be applied for a 
longer period and with more expensive drugs. Drug 
resistance also requires more expensive detection and 
monitoring methods.44
HIV/AIDS
A major change in methods for estimating burden of HIV
/
AIDS for GBD 2016 was the distribution of antiretroviral 
therapy coverage by age, sex, and CD4 count. We used 
two AIDS Indicator Surveys45,46 to predict the age-sex-CD4 
distribution of antiretroviral therapy coverage. This shifted 
the coverage distribution to groups with higher CD4 
counts and gave a better fit to the data. UNAIDS produces 
periodic updates to global, regional, and national estimates 
of HIV
/AIDS incidence and prevalence. In their latest 
assessment there were 36·7 million (30·8 million to 42·9 
million) people living with HIV
/AIDS in 2016, compared 
with 36·4 million (34·2 million to 39·1 million) estimated 
by GBD 2016.47 Comparisons of prevalence estimates at the 
country level in 2005 (the estimated peak of the HIV
/AIDS 
epidemic globally) and 2016 show a high level of 
concordance between GBD 2016 and UNAIDS, with an 
average intra-class correlation coefficient of 0·992. For 
estimates of annual new infections, UNAIDS and GBD 
follow similar patterns, with UNAIDS having slightly 
lower estimates for years between 1996 and 2002. The 
estimates are similar between the two for most of the 
2000s, with UNAIDS estimates showing a slightly faster 
rate of decline in annual new infections from 2008 to 2016 
at the global level. GBD 2016 estimates about 1·9 million 
new infections globally in 2016, while UNAIDS estimates 
about 1.8 million for the same year.47
Cancer
Country-specific cancer statistics are published by the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer for their 
GLOBOCAN project.48 Their most recent estimate of 
incidence for all cancers combined is 14·1 million cases 
in 2012, compared with GBD estimates of 14·8 million 
cases in 2010 and 17·2 million cases in 2016. The appendix 
provides a comparison of incidence by cancer type 
between GBD and GLOBOCAN (appendix 1, p 255).
Zika virus disease
The large outbreak of Zika virus disease in Latin America 
in 2016 led WHO to declare it a public health emergency 
of international concern.49 There were 7·6 million new 
infections in 2016, 7·4 million of which occurred in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. Most of the health loss 
associated with Zika virus disease was from non-fatal 
outcomes, including fever and malaise during acute 
infection and congenital anomalies and Guillain-Barré 
syndrome as longer-term consequences.
Guinea worm
Guinea worm disease was included as a cause of non-fatal 
health loss because eradication of the disease is achievable 
in the near future.50Although not having received much 
attention in general global health policy debates, a 
remarkable reduction from an estimated 3·5 million 
cases in the mid-1980s to just 15 cases in 2016 has been 
achieved. Guinea worm eradication interventions include 
the distribution of filter cloths and pipe filters for drinking 
water, treatment of water sources with larvacide, case 
detection, containment to prevent further transmission, 
and health education.50
Limitations
The annual updates of GBD allow incremental 
improvements 
to 
methods. 
However, 
several 
measurement challenges in non-fatal estimation remain. 
The foremost concern is how best to disentangle 
measurement error from true variation in disease 
occurrence. We correct for known bias from non-
reference methods or case definitions, but often have to 
rely on sparse information to make those adjustments. 
Lack of consensus among researchers on how to measure 
a disease can make it difficult to define a manageable set 
of alternative methods for which we can make 
adjustments. An extreme example is dementia: among 
234 data sources we identified 228 different methods of 
screening, diagnostic tools, and diagnostic criteria. When 
possible, we use predictive covariates in our non-fatal 
models. For diseases with a lot of information on what 
drives differences in disease, covariates help to estimate 
true variation and minimise residual measurement error. 
However, many of the leading causes of YLDs lack strong 
predictors as indicated by our risk assessment, which 
assigned less than 20% of YLDs from mental, 
musculoskeletal, sense organ, and neurological disorders 
to the 79 risks evaluated in the GBD study.51
Second, many non-fatal models continue to rely on 
sparse data in some regions or super-regions despite the 
steady increase in data sources. With the addition of some 
 Global Health Metrics
1248 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 390   September 16, 2017
new data sources, this can lead to large variation with 
previous GBD estimates. Alcohol dependence is a good 
example. Our estimate of the global prevalence of alcohol 
dependence increased by 70% after adding nine new data 
sources for Brazil, 12 for India, seven for sub-Saharan 
Africa, and four in eastern and central Europe. Until 
there is better coverage of data, non-fatal disease models 
will continue to be prone to estimates varying between 
GBD iterations.
Third, the adjustments to our hospital admission data 
for multiple admissions and secondary diagnosis fields 
reflect all health-care episodes rather than inpatient 
episodes only. Adjustments derived from a large, though 
non-representative, source of medical claims data in 
the USA are assumed to be generalisable. The general-
isability of claims data, the validity of assuming diagnoses 
based on primary diagnosis alone or all diagnostic fields, 
and the validity of trends in claims data have been 
challenged.52–56 Also, there may be considerable inter-
country variation in how diseases are treated between 
inpatient and outpatient settings. Our models attempt to 
adjust for such potential biases by using a covariate on 
claims and hospital admission data to correct for systematic 
error, although in a relatively crude manner, this assumes 
no geographical variation in the error. Gaining access to 
claims data from other countries, particularly in low-
income and middle-income countries, is a crucial 
endeavour for future GBD iterations.
Fourth, our estimates of severity distributions for most 
diseases are based on sparse studies from the literature 
for diseases with a more established consensus on a 
measure of severity, or our analyses of three high-income 
surveys which combine diagnostic information with 
a general health status measure, the Short Form-12 
(SF-12).40,57,58 Disease-specific researchers can provide 
better data with more routine use of a single established 
measure of severity in surveys and patient populations. 
Another potential improvement can be expected from 
countries that are able to link survey data with a general 
health assessment instrument like SF-12 and admin-
istrative diagnostic information. The latter approach has 
the advantage that it would allow adjustments for 
comorbidity, which can affect measures aiming to capture 
the severity of a single disease.
Fifth, apart from COPD, stroke, and epilepsy, where we 
have epidemiological data to estimate the geographical 
variation in the distribution of sequelae, for most diseases 
we are unable to capture differences in severity that occur 
due to treatment. As almost all our data sources on severity 
are from high-income countries, this would underestimate 
YLDs in low-income and middle-income countries with 
poorer access to and quality of treatment. If greater 
geographical information on severity of disease becomes 
available, we can incorporate a more explicit gradient 
based on our health-system access and quality index.58
Sixth, we have not yet been able to incorporate depen-
dent comorbidity into our simulation methods. We aim 
for this to  take place in GBD 2017 and will require 
substantial developmental work to make the com-
putational code more efficient.
Seventh, most of the uncertainty in our YLD estimates 
comes from the disability weights. We have not con 
ducted 
any new surveys since GBD 2013. With further data 
collection, we may be able to reduce some of the 
uncertainty by increasing the volume of data and by 
removing some of the ambiguities in lay descriptions, but 
large uncertainty is inherent to health state valuations that 
rely on perceptions by respondents of brief descriptions of 
complex health problems.
Eighth, the separate estimation of non-fatal models in 
DisMod-MR 2.1 for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2006, 2010, and 2016 
implies uncertainty of estimates over time is independent. 
Also, compositional bias can lead to spurious time trends 
being estimated. DisMod-AT will allow for the more 
appealing simultaneous estimation over age and time 
and thus resolve the current limitations. However, as it is 
a more complex modelling tool, extensive testing and 
understanding what sensible settings are will need 
to take place before we can replace the current DisMod-
MR approach.
Ninth, scrutiny of the multitude of results generated by 
GBD is a challenge. Increasingly, we generate visual-
isation tools to query results and intermediate steps in 
our analyses to better vet our results. We share our data 
and modelling tools with our expanding network of over 
2500 collaborators who frequently query data sources 
and our measurements for particular diseases or 
locations. Also, by publishing all code and describing the 
methods used disease-by-disease we encourage scrutiny 
of every aspect of the GBD study.
Tenth, as our GBD collaborators have raised, the 
argument of including Guinea worm disease to docu-
ment pending eradication can be used to justify the 
inclusion of poliomyelitis in the next round of GBD. 
There are also a number of large residual categories, 
particularly other musculoskeletal disorders and other 
cardiovascular disease, where we could make more 
detailed estimates in future rounds of GBD.
Eleventh, despite adding estimates of the prevalence of 
several asymptomatic states of disease that are precursors 
of disease that can be targeted with preventive inter-
ventions (such as latent tuberculosis infection, chronic 
hepatitis, or stage III chronic kidney disease without 
anaemia), we are not comprehensive in doing so. As 
diagnostic capacity increases, more asymptomatic pre-
cursor states can be identified and, in GBD, we will aim 
to include these if they can be measured at the population 
level and become relevant to policy.
Future directions
We have introduced a quality grading system for cause of 
death sources for GBD 2016. We want to introduce a 
similar grading system of non-fatal data sources for GBD 
2017
. Important elements to capture in a grading system 
 Global Health Metrics
www.thelancet.com   Vol 390   September 16, 2017 
1249
of non-fatal data sources will include the proportion of 
data sources using the reference method and case 
definition for a cause, the proportion of data sources 
representative of a location, and the amount of detail in 
reporting of age groups, sex, locations, and time periods 
covered. Unlike the location-specific grading of cause of 
death data sources, a grading system of non-fatal data 
sources will need to be location-specific and cause-
specific, making it a much larger endeavour that will 
likely take several years to complete.
A prototype of a new version of a new analytical tool, 
DisMod-AT, is currently being tested. It has the advantage 
over DisMod-MR 2.1 in that it solves for the differential 
equations that govern the relationship between incidence, 
prevalence, remission, and mortality simultaneously 
over age and time. This is of great relevance for causes 
that vary substantially over time, and overcomes the 
assumption of a steady disease state that underlies prev-
ious versions of DisMod. We expect for GBD 2017 to run 
both the current tool and DisMod-AT in parallel for a 
number of time-sensitive causes with a view of DisMod-
AT becoming the tool of choice from GBD 2018 onward.
We plan to reinstate a web survey facility that will allow 
derivation of disability weights for new health states; 
examination of the effect of changes in the wording of lay 
descriptions of health states on valuations provided by 
respondents; and creation of health states for combined 
impairments for which we currently estimate disability 
weights multiplicatively. 
Conclusion
Diverging trends in YLLs and YLDs raise the importance 
of non-fatal health outcomes as contributing to the 
burden of disease. Even if changes in trends for many 
causes are not large, more attention should be paid to 
assessing the burden of non-fatal health outcomes, as 
populations age and countries progress through the 
epidemiological transition, causing growing numbers of 
people to be in need of chronic care. More research is 
needed to identify risks of major disabling diseases, 
better methods of intervening by prevention, and 
treatment or improving severity of disability. As countries 
progress through the epidemiological transition, more 
attention should be paid to assessing the burden of non-
fatal health out 
comes, particularly in light of growing 
numbers of people in need of chronic care as populations 
age. More research is needed to identify risks of 
major disabling diseases, better methods of intervening 
by prevention, and treatment or improving severity 
of disability.
