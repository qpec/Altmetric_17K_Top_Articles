Abstract
Background
While the high prevalence of preterm births and its impact on infant mortality in the US have
been widely acknowledged, recent data suggest that even full-term births in the US face
substantially higher mortality risks compared to European countries with low infant mortality
rates. In this paper, we use the most recent birth records in the US to more closely analyze
the primary causes underlying mortality rates among full-term births.
Methods and findings
Linked birth and death records for the period 2010–2012 were used to identify the state- and
cause-specific burden of infant mortality among full-term infants (born at 37–42 weeks of
gestation). Multivariable logistic models were used to assess the extent to which state-level
differences in full-term infant mortality (FTIM) were attributable to observed differences in
maternal and birth characteristics. Random effects models were used to assess the relative
contribution of state-level variation to FTIM. Hypothetical mortality outcomes were com-
puted under the assumption that all states could achieve the survival rates of the best-per-
forming states. A total of 10,175,481 infants born full-term in the US between January 1,
2010, and December 31, 2012, were analyzed. FTIM rate (FTIMR) was 2.2 per 1,000 live
births overall, and ranged between 1.29 (Connecticut, 95% CI 1.08, 1.53) and 3.77 (Missis-
sippi, 95% CI 3.39, 4.19) at the state level. Zero states reached the rates reported in the 6
low-mortality European countries analyzed (FTIMR < 1.25), and 13 states had FTIMR >
2.75. Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) accounted for 43% of FTIM; congenital
malformations and perinatal conditions accounted for 31% and 11.3% of FTIM, respectively.
The largest mortality differentials between states with good and states with poor FTIMR
were found for SUDI, with particularly large risk differentials for deaths due to sudden infant
death syndrome (SIDS) (odds ratio [OR] 2.52, 95% CI 1.86, 3.42) and suffocation (OR 4.40,
95% CI 3.71, 5.21). Even though these mortality differences were partially explained by

 state-level differences in maternal education, race, and maternal health, substantial state-
level variation in infant mortality remained in fully adjusted models (SIDS OR 1.45, suffoca-
tion OR 2.92). The extent to which these state differentials are due to differential antenatal
care standards as well as differential access to health services could not be determined due
to data limitations. Overall, our estimates suggest that infant mortality could be reduced by
4,003 deaths (95% CI 2,284, 5,587) annually if all states were to achieve the mortality levels
of the best-performing state in each cause-of-death category. Key limitations of the analysis
are that information on termination rates at the state level was not available, and that causes
of deaths may have been coded differentially across states.
Conclusions
More than 7,000 full-term infants die in the US each year. The results presented in this
paper suggest that a substantial share of these deaths may be preventable. Potential
improvements seem particularly large for SUDI, where very low rates have been achieved in
a few states while average mortality rates remain high in most other areas. Given the high
mortality burden due to SIDS and suffocation, policy efforts to promote compliance with rec-
ommended sleeping arrangements could be an effective first step in this direction.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• High infant mortality rates in the US compared to other high-income countries have
been well documented in the literature.
• Most of this literature primarily attributes high infant mortality in the US to the high
rates of prematurity.
• Relatively little is known regarding the survival of infants born full-term.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We compared state-level mortality rates among full-term infants in the US to that of 6
European countries with low mortality rates.
• We showed that infants born full-term in the US face 50%–200% higher risks of infant
mortality compared to these European countries.
• We found that the largest proportion of infant deaths among children born full-term
in the US was due to sudden unexpected deaths of infants, which comprised both
sudden infant death syndrome and other unexpected causes such as suffocation and
violence.

Introduction
Despite some progress made in recent years, infant mortality rates in the US continue to be
high compared to other high-income countries [1]. According to the latest estimates, the US
currently ranks 44th among 199 countries of all income levels, with an infant mortality rate of
5.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015, about 3 times the rate observed for countries at the
very top of the ranking [1].
While the high rates of prematurity and prematurity-related mortality in the US have been
well documented in the literature [2,3], the US performs comparably to other high-income
countries when it comes to the survival of preterm infants. Fig 1 compares gestation-specific
mortality rates in the US and 6 leading European countries (in terms of low infant mortality
rates) with data available for 2010. On average, infant mortality appeared to be very similar for
premature births in the US and in these European countries. The same was not true for chil-
dren born after 36 weeks of gestation, where children born in the US faced more than twice
the mortality risk of children in European countries with low infant mortality rates (odds ratio
[OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.84, 2.22). A recent US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
report suggests that this mortality gap among full-term births now accounts for almost 50% of
the infant mortality gap between Sweden and the US [4].
In this study, we used complete and geocoded birth records from the period 2010–2012 to
better understand the high burden of mortality among full-term infants in the US. We identi-
fied the main causes underlying the high mortality rates among full-term infants overall in the
aggregate data in a first step, and then explored differences in actual and potential birth out-
comes across US states in a second step. By first reviewing the causes of death in this popula-
tion, we could identify the main risk factors for infants in this generally low-risk population,
and could clearly distinguish the relative importance of preexisting conditions such as malfor-
mations relative to perinatal and post-neonatal conditions (those arising in the 28–364 days
after birth). In order to provide a better sense of feasible outcomes in this population, we esti-
mated and compared cause-specific full-term mortality rates at the state level both uncondi-
tional and conditional on maternal characteristics. While these state-level comparisons did not
allow us to identify the specific reasons why certain states have particularly high rates of mor-
tality, they did allow us to identify areas where major improvements were possible in principle.
Methods
Study design
The study was designed as a cross-sectional study using birth and death records of all infants
born in the US between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. No pre-analysis plan was
developed for this study. The main objective of the project was to identify the primary causes

 underlying the high infant mortality rates observed in the US nationally as well as at the state
level.
Data sources
Linked birth and death records including restricted geographic identifiers were obtained from
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for the years 2010 to 2012. All infants in the
birth and death records could be directly linked to the geographic identifiers in these datasets
(100% match rate). Additional data for Fig 1 were downloaded from the Euro-Peristat web-
page at http://www.europeristat.com/our-indicators/euro-peristat-perinatal-health-indicators-
2010.html.
Outcome measures
Our primary outcome measure of interest was the infant mortality rate among full-term births
defined as the number of deaths per 1,000 children born alive between 37 and 42 weeks of ges-
tation within the first year of their life. For the purpose of this study, we used the traditional
definition of full-term, which includes early-term (37 and 38 weeks), full-term (39 and 40
weeks), late-term (41 weeks), and some post-term (42 weeks) births according to the more
recent definition of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on
Obstetric Practice [5]. To adjust for differential outcomes in this relatively wide 5-week gesta-
tional window, we controlled for differences in gestational age by including binary indicators
for gestational age category (37 weeks, 38 weeks, 41 weeks, 42 weeks) in our multivariable anal-
ysis, using the more narrow, revised full-term definition (39 and 40 weeks) as our reference
group. Gestational age was computed by the NCHS based on last menstrual period reported

risk (IMR) in the US compared to the average rate observed in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and
Switzerland for the year 2010. Sources: Euro-Peristat, US birth and death records, author calculations. Gestational age
in both the Euro-Peristat and US data is based on the best obstetrical estimate available, which in most cases
corresponds to first trimester ultrasound. ES, effect size.

 by the mother. To ensure gestational age was not measured differentially across states, we com-
pared prematurity rates with rates of low birth weight in the full sample at the state level. The
correlation of these measures at the state level was 0.97; the strong alignment between birth
weight and reported gestational age is further supported by the descriptive statistics provided
in S1 Table.
Causes of death for all children who died under the age of 1 year were based on death certif-
icates, which are required to be completed by either a coroner or medical examiner in all US
states, following CDC guidelines. Even though regulations vary by state, deaths due to violence
or suspicious circumstances are further investigated and certified by a medical legal officer [6].
Death certificates were reviewed and coded following ICD-10 guidelines by the NCHS. For
the purpose of this paper, we grouped reported causes of death into 4 main categories: (1) con-
genital malformations: ICD-10 codes Q00–Q99; (2) sudden unexpected death in infancy
(SUDI): ICD-10 codes V01–Y89 and R00–R99; (3) perinatal conditions: ICD-10 codes P00–
P96; and (4) all other causes: all other ICD-10 codes.
The SUDI grouping was chosen intentionally to minimize potential state-level differences
in the attribution of unexplained deaths to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) versus
“other unexplained causes” [7–9]. Some more disaggregated statistics for major causes of
deaths (such as SIDS) were also computed as described further below.
Exclusion criteria
Children born prior to 37 or after 42 weeks of gestation were excluded from this study. All
other children born alive in the US between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012, includ-
ing multiple births and children born with malformations (not reported in the NCHS dataset),
were analyzed in this study.
Covariates
In order to assess the extent to which state-level differences in infant mortality rates can be
attributed to differences in maternal characteristics, we considered the following variables
included in the original data file: mother’s age, educational attainment, smoking behavior, dia-
betes, chronic hypertension, and eclampsia. We divided maternal age into 5 categories (<20,
20–34, 35–39, 40–44, and >44 years) and used age 20–34 as the reference group in our multi-
variable analysis. Similarly, we divided maternal educational attainment into 4 categories: less
than high school, high school or some college credit without degree, associate or bachelor’s
degree, and master’s degree or doctorate. In response to a reviewer request, we also added con-
trols for mother’s race: white, black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Asian/Pacific
Islander. As for smoking, mothers reported the average number of cigarettes smoked per day
during their first, second, and third trimesters. From this we constructed indicators for smok-
ing (number of cigarettes per day > 0) or not for each trimester. We used indicators for previ-
ous diagnosis of diabetes, chronic hypertension, and eclampsia as provided in the dataset. All
these variables were based on mother’s self-report in the hospital around the time of delivery
and were reported on the birth certificate. In addition, we included controls for the following
birth characteristics: birth weight category (<1,500, 1,500–1,999, 2,000–2,499, 2,500–2,999,
3,000–3,499, 3,500–3,999, 4,000–4,499, and >4,499 g), multiple birth (1 if singleton, 2 if twin,
3 if triplet, 4 if quadruplet, and 5 if quintuplet or higher), infant sex, and gestational age (indi-
cators for 37 weeks, 38 weeks, 41 weeks, and 42 weeks of gestation) in our empirical models.
Further details of all these variables are provided in S1 Table.

 Statistical methods
As a first step, we computed full-term infant mortality rates (FTIMRs) at the state level, and
classified all US states into 5 groups: states with excellent FTIMR (FTIMR < 1.25—the Euro-
pean benchmark shown in Fig 1), states with good FTIMR (1.25 � FTIMR < 1.75), states with
average FTIMR (1.75 � FTIMR < 2.25), states with fair FTIMR (2.25 � FTIMR < 2.75), and
finally states with poor FTIMR (FTIMR � 2.75). The “excellent” group was chosen based on
the FTIMRs observed in 6 European countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden,
and Switzerland), which ranged between 0.97 and 1.24, with a median FTIMR of 1.11. The
remaining groups were defined by sequentially adding 0.5 deaths per 1,000 full-term live births
(a 50% increase relative to the European average) to the cutoffs. In a second step, we decom-
posed mortality differences at the group level by cause of death. Third, we used multivariable
regression models to assess the extent to which survival differences across states can be attrib-
uted to observable differences in maternal and birth characteristics. To do so, we first ran mul-
tivariable logistic models comparing infants born in the states with the highest mortality rates
to infants born in the states with the lowest mortality rates. We estimated 3 separate models: a
first model, where we did not adjust for any covariates; a second model, where we adjusted for
maternal characteristics outlined in the covariates section above; and a third model (proposed
by a reviewer), where we adjusted for maternal characteristics and birth characteristics (gesta-
tional age, infant sex, birth weight, and multiple birth). Model 2 was estimated to assess the
extent to which state-level differences can be attributed to local variation in maternal charac-
teristics such as age, education, race, and health status. Model 3 was estimated to assess the
extent to which subsequent mortality differentials were explained by local variation in the
prevalence of multiple births as well as differences in birth weight and the distribution of gesta-
tional age. In all 3 models, each observation corresponded to a child born full-term in the sam-
ple period. To assess the overall contribution of state-level characteristics to variation in
FTIMR, we also estimated multilevel logistic models where we nested individual observations
within states, and then estimated between-state variance in unconditional models as well as in
models conditioning on maternal and birth characteristics. Lastly, we computed hypothetical
mortality rates (which we refer to as “counterfactuals”) under the assumptions that (i) all US
states achieved the overall FTIMR of the best-performing states (good FTIMR group) and (ii)
all US states achieved the specific FTIMRs of the best-performing state in each cause-of-death
category.
Results
A total 10,175,481 children born full-term in the US between January 1, 2010, and December
31, 2012, were analyzed. FTIMR was 2.19 (95% CI 2.16, 2.22) per 1,000 full-term live births in
the pooled sample. At the state level, estimated FTIMR ranged between 1.29 (95% CI 1.08,
1.53) in Connecticut and 3.77 (95% CI 3.39, 4.19) in Missouri. No state was classified as excel-
lent in terms of their FTIMR; 10 states including Connecticut were classified as good, 17 as
average, 11 as fair, and 13 as poor FTIMR (see Fig 2 and S2 Table for details).
Fig 3 compares early neonatal (death in the first 6 days after birth), late neonatal (death
between 7 and 27 days after birth), and post-neonatal (death 28–364 days after birth) mortality
rates across mortality groups. While only relatively minor differences were found with respect
to early neonatal mortality, large absolute and relative differences were found for the post-neo-
natal period, with an average of 9.5 (95% CI 9.1, 9.9) deaths per 10,000 full-term births in states
classified as having good FTIMR and a mortality rate of 20.9 (95% CI 20.1, 21.6) deaths per
10,000 full-term births in the states classified as having poor FTIMR.

 Fig 4 summarizes the main causes of full-term infant mortality (FTIM). SUDI accounted
for the largest proportion of deaths overall (43%), followed by congenital malformations (31%)
and perinatal conditions (11%). The mortality risk due to congenital malformations increased
from 5.6 deaths per 10,000 full-term live births in states with FTIMR < 2.75 to 8.4 deaths in
states with poor FTIMR. The risk of SUDI was 5.6 in the states classified as having good
FTIMR and 15.4 in the states classified as having poor FTIMR. Observed absolute mortality
differences between FTIMR groups were smallest for perinatal conditions, with an estimated
mortality rate of 2.1 in the states with good FTIMR and an estimated mortality of 2.8 in states
with poor FTIMR.
In S1 and S2 Figs, we provide further details on the primary causes of congenital malforma-
tions. The 2 most common causes of deaths due to congenital malformation were Edwards
syndrome and congenital malformations of the heart, which accounted for 10.9% and 14.6%
of congenital malformation deaths, respectively.
In terms of the underlying causes of SUDI, 42.2% of SUDIs were due to SIDS (ICD-10: R95),
followed by unknown and ill-defined causes (ICD-10: R99), which accounted for 20.6% of
SUDIs, and accidental suffocation and strangulation (ICD-10: W75), which accounted for 16.1%
of SUDIs. S3–S7 Figs provide further details on the spatial distribution of cause-specific SUDIs.

(1.75 � FTIMR < 2.25), states with fair FTIMR (2.25 � FTIMR < 2.75), and states with poor FTIMR (FTIMR � 2.75). All estimates are for full-term infants born in
2010–2012. FTIMR, full-term infant mortality rate.

 S8 Fig summarizes the relative importance of the 4 mortality groups in the neonatal, late
neonatal, and post-neonatal periods. Congenital malformations accounted for 58.1% and
43.3% of overall mortality in the early neonatal and late neonatal periods, respectively. Perina-
tal conditions accounted for 31.7% and 22.8% of mortality in the same periods. In the post-
neonatal period—which accounted for the majority of deaths overall (63.5%, as shown in Fig
3)—the large majority (60%) of deaths were due to SUDI.
Table 1 shows estimated OR for the group of states with poor FTIMR compared to the
group of states with good FTIMR for the 4 main cause-of-death categories displayed in Fig 4.
The table shows unadjusted OR estimates and OR estimates adjusted for the full set of covari-
ates summarized in S1 Table. In unadjusted models, living in a state with poor FTIMR was
associated with an increased odds of FTIM due to perinatal conditions of 35% (OR 1.35, 95%
CI 1.17, 1.56) as well as an increased odds of death due to congenital malformations of 51%
(1.51, 95% CI 1.24, 1.85). Risk differentials were largest for SUDI, with an estimated OR of
2.75 (95% CI 2.46, 3.07). When we adjusted for maternal age, education, race, and measures of

FTIMR � 2.75) for the years 2010 to 2012 as well as the percentage of deaths in each age category. Early neonatal mortality is defined as death in the first 6 days
after birth. Late neonatal mortality is defined as deaths between 7 and 27 days after birth, and post-neonatal mortality is defined as death 28 to 364 days after
birth. FTIMR, full-term infant mortality rate.

 health status, estimated risk differentials declined for all risk factors, with the largest declines
for SUDI, where estimated OR fell from 2.75 in unadjusted models to 1.70 in models adjusting
for both maternal and birth characteristics. In general, differences between models 2 (adjusting
for maternal characteristics only) and 3 (adjusting for maternal characteristics and birth char-
acteristics) were small and not statistically significant.
In Table 2, we show estimated state variability in mortality outcomes based on multilevel
logistic models. State-level variation was highest for SUDI (estimated state-level variance
0.118, 95% CI 0.068, 0.168) and congenital malformations (0.061, 95% CI 0.028, 0.095). These
state-level differences were reduced substantially for all causes when we controlled for differ-
ences in maternal and birth characteristics, with particularly large reductions for SUDI, where
estimated state variability dropped to 0.034 (95% CI 0.014, 0.054) when both maternal and
birth characteristics were included in the model.

 outcomes overall (good FTIMR group), infant mortality would decline by an estimated 2,023
(95% CI 1,717, 2,329) deaths each year. Under the more ambitious counterfactual that all states
could achieve the cause-specific mortality rates of the best-performing state in each cause-of-
death category, infant mortality among full-term births would be reduced by 4,003 deaths (95%
CI 2,284, 5,587) each year. Under both hypothetical scenarios, only about 10% of the potential
improvements were related to perinatal conditions or other causes. More than 75% of the excess
burden of mortality in both scenarios was due to congenital malformations and SUDI.
Discussion
The results presented in this paper show a large gap in the survival probabilities of full-term
infants born in the US compared to European countries with low under-5 mortality rates.
Pooling all available data between 2010 and 2012, we found that no single US state or territory
achieved the full-term survival rates currently reported in leading European countries, with
children born full-term in the 10 best-performing states facing about 50% higher risks of infant
mortality, and children born in states with poor FTIMR facing almost 3 times the infant mor-
tality risk of European countries with low infant mortality rates.
Given that survival rates among preterm infants in the US were found to be very similar to
those of the same European countries (as illustrated in Fig 1), clinical care during or immediately

 after delivery likely does not explain much of the mortality gap observed. In the sample analyzed,
perinatal conditions—where healthcare quality likely matters most—accounted only for about
11% of total infant mortality among full-term births. In terms of the big picture, the high burden
of FTIM in the US seemed to be mostly due to SUDI and congenital malformations, which
accounted for 42.9% and 31.1% of the total infant mortality burden among full-term children,
respectively, and for almost 80% of excess deaths in our counterfactual analysis. From a policy
perspective, deaths due to malformations are quite different from deaths classified as SUDI. Mal-
formations are in practice hard, if not impossible, to prevent; in most cases, the only way to “pre-
vent” malformation-related infant mortality is to increase screening and early termination. In
terms of the overall magnitude, we found malformation-specific FTIMRs of less than 3 per
10,000 live births in some states, such as Vermont and New Jersey, and rates 3 times higher in
quite a few states in the Mississippi delta and surrounding states (see S2 Fig for details). Globally,
WHO estimates suggest that 330,000 children die annually during the neonatal period due to
congenital malformations [10,11], which corresponds to a risk of approximately 2.5 deaths per
10,000. Taking these global estimates as a benchmark suggests that children in the US face about
3 times the risk of death due to malformation in other countries. In practice, the extent to which
these differences reflect differences in screening and termination policies rather than differences
in medical care across states and countries is not clear; further research investigating the reach
and effectiveness of early screening programs across countries and states will be needed to better
understand these current gaps.
With respect to actual health improvements, the area with the most obvious and ample
room for increasing the chances of child survival is SUDIs. Given that the attribution of deaths
to SIDS versus “other unexplained causes” was not obvious in many cases [7,8], we mostly
focused on the larger SUDI category in this paper. More than 3,000 infants died in the US each
year between 2010 and 2012 due to causes that were—as the name suggests—not expected
under normal conditions. This is perhaps most immediately obvious when it comes to acci-
dental suffocation or strangulation in bed. Over 600 infants die in the US each year due to suf-
focation in bed; new strategies to convey optimal sleeping arrangements to parents will need
to be developed and tested to prevent these deaths.
SUDI mortality in the best-performing states of the US (California and New York) was less
than 6 deaths per 10,000 births; rates were more than twice as high (>12) in 12 states, including
Ohio, South Dakota, and Tennessee. A large fraction of these deaths were attributed to SIDS,

 which has previously been estimated to cause 6.4 deaths per 10,000 births [12]. Our results sug-
gested SIDS incidence rates as low as 1.27 and 1.32 per 10,000 full-term live births in Nevada
and New Mexico and as high as 13.33 and 8.75 in Arkansas and Mississippi. Evidence from
European studies suggests that a large majority of SIDS deaths could historically be attributed to
prone sleeping and maternal drug consumption [13]. Through active public health programs,
the incidence of SIDS was lowered by 75% in Sweden [14] and Scotland [15]; general compli-
ance with sleeping recommendations continues to be a challenge in the US, particularly among
women with low socioeconomic status [16]. Empirically, a large proportion of the state-level
differences in mortality due to both SIDS and the broader SUDI category could be attributed
to state-level differences in maternal age and maternal education. As shown in the more
detailed regression results in S4 Table, maternal characteristics were highly predictive of these
mortality outcomes. We found that compared to children born to mothers with incomplete
high school education, children of highly educated mothers (those with master’s degree or doc-
torate) had 74% lower odds of SUDI, and that the risk of SUDI almost linearly declined with
maternal age (conditional on all other factors). This suggests that mortality in this category is
strongly influenced by maternal behavior and the early home environment, both of which
should at least in principle be modifiable through targeted information and behavioral change
interventions.
Our analysis is not without limitations. First, we have relatively little information on chil-
dren’s home environments, and thus cannot directly identify what is happening at children’s
homes or compare underlying risk factors. Second, it is possible that state-level estimates that
we present may be biased if people move before or after birth. Empirically, for 97% of the
observations, state of birth is the same as state of residence, which means that these biases
should be small if they exist. Third, as mentioned above, we do not have information on termi-
nation rates at the state level, which are likely to (at least partially) explain differences in birth
outcomes observed. According to the latest estimates available, approximately 700,000 legally
induced abortions occurred in 2012 in the US [17], which corresponds to about 20% of the
annual sample analyzed in this study. While it seems likely that infant mortality rates would be
higher without these terminations, our data do not allow us to directly quantify these differ-
ences. Last, it seems likely that some of the less common causes of death (particularly in the
ICD-10 R and W categories) are miscoded or coded differentially across states. To reduce this
type of measurement error, we grouped all SUDIs together for most of our analyses.
Conclusion
More than 7,000 children born alive at full-term in the US each year die within their first year
of life. The results presented in this paper suggest that a substantial proportion of these deaths
are preventable, with particularly large improvements possible for SUDI.
