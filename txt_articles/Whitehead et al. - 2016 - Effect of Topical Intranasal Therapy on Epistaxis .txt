IMPORTANCE Epistaxis is a major factor negatively affecting quality of life in patients with
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease).
Optimal treatment for HHT-related epistaxis is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether topical therapy with any of 3 drugs with differing
mechanisms of action is effective in reducing HHT-related epistaxis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The North American Study of Epistaxis in HHT was a
double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial performed at 6 HHT centers of
excellence. From August 2011 through March 2014, there were 121 adult patients who met the
clinical criteria for HHT and had experienced HHT-related epistaxis with an Epistaxis Severity
Score of at least 3.0. Follow-up was completed in September 2014.
INTERVENTIONS Patients received twice-daily nose sprays for 12 weeks with either
bevacizumab 1% (4 mg/d), estriol 0.1% (0.4 mg/d), tranexamic acid 10% (40 mg/d),
or placebo (0.9% saline).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was median weekly epistaxis
frequency during weeks 5 through 12. Secondary outcomes included median duration of
epistaxis during weeks 5 through 12, Epistaxis Severity Score, level of hemoglobin, level of
ferritin, need for transfusion, emergency department visits, and treatment failure.
RESULTS Among the 121 patients who were randomized (mean age, 52.8 years [SD, 12.9
years]; 44% women with a median of 7.0 weekly episodes of epistaxis [interquartile range
{IQR}, 3.0-14.0]), 106 patients completed the study duration for the primary outcome
measure (43 were women [41%]). Drug therapy did not significantly reduce epistaxis
frequency (P = .97). After 12 weeks of treatment, the median weekly number of bleeding
episodes was 7.0 (IQR, 4.5-10.5) for patients in the bevacizumab group, 8.0 (IQR, 4.0-12.0)
for the estriol group, 7.5 (IQR, 3.0-11.0) for the tranexamic acid group, and 8.0 (IQR, 3.0-14.0)
for the placebo group. No drug treatment was significantly different from placebo for
epistaxis duration. All groups had a significant improvement in Epistaxis Severity Score at
weeks 12 and 24. There were no significant differences between groups for hemoglobin level,
ferritin level, treatment failure, need for transfusion, or emergency department visits.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with HHT, there were no significant
between-group differences in the use of topical intranasal treatment with bevacizumab
vs estriol vs tranexamic acid vs placebo and epistaxis frequency.

H
ereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a
hereditary vascular condition characterized by the de-
velopment of arteriovenous malformations through-
out the body.1 The most common manifestation of HHT is re-
currentandspontaneousepistaxis,whichisseenin90%to95%
of patients and is due to
fragile telangiectases on
the nasal mucosa.1,2 HHT-
related epistaxis (HRE) is
the most important deter-
minant of quality of life in
patients with HHT and is the leading reason given by patients
for switching to another profession.3
To date, randomized clinical trials for HRE have studied
oral estrogen,4 topical estriol plus argon plasma coagulation,5
oral tamoxifen,6 oral tranexamic acid,7,8 submucosal
bevacizumab,9 topical bevacizumab,10 and sclerotherapy.11
Even though several of these studies have suggested modest
benefit, they also have demonstrated conflicting results, and
themajorityhaveincludedsmallnumbersofpatientsandhave
several methodological weaknesses. Nonrandomized clini-
cal trials of endonasal coagulation suggest short-term benefit
in a large percentage of patients; however, this therapy is in-
vasive, is costly, and must be repeated intermittently. There-
fore, the optimal treatment for HRE remains uncertain.
Given that 80% to 90% of nasal telangiectases are in a lo-
cation accessible to topical treatment,12 and the desire to avoid
the risks of systemic therapies, this randomized clinical trial
wasdesignedtoassesstopicaltherapiesforHRE.Basedonpub-
lished data and anecdotal experience, 3 agents with theoreti-
cally differing mechanisms of action were selected for fur-
ther study. The first is bevacizumab, which is a recombinant
humanized antibody directed against vascular endothelial
growth factor that may attenuate angiogenesis. The second is
estriol, which induces squamous metaplasia of the nasal
mucosa.13 The third is tranexamic acid, which can stabilize
blood clots through inhibition of fibrinolysis and upregulate
endoglinandACVRL1expressioninendothelialcells.14Theob-
jective of this randomized clinical trial was to determine
whether compared with placebo, topical therapy with beva-
cizumab,estriol,ortranexamicacidwouldreduceepistaxisfre-
quency and severity in patients with HHT.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
The study design committee chose the 3 drugs judged to
have the greatest likelihood of benefit to compare with pla-
cebo. The dose of bevacizumab was chosen based on 1 case
report in the literature15 and the anecdotal experiences of the
design committee, suggesting a dose of 4 mg/d to 10 mg/d for
7 to 14 days. Balancing potential off-label patient costs and
study design considerations, a dose of 4 mg/d of bevaci-
zumab for 7 days was chosen. The dose of estriol was based
on the study of Sadick et al.13 The dose of tranexamic acid
was based on extensive literature and experience in the com-
pounding pharmacy world. The treatment duration was cho-
sen because the committee judged that patients would need
to see benefit within 3 months to realistically continue with a
treatment. An effect size of 50% improvement in the fre-
quency of epistaxis was chosen based on several studies
showing a similar benefit5,6,8,15 and what would be clinically
significant to the patient. All sites received approval from
their local institutional review boards and all patients pro-
vided written informed consent. Augusta University was the
coordinating center and together with the University of Utah
prepared all data for the analysis. A data and safety monitor-
ing board of 4 physicians convened every 6 to 12 months to
review data on adverse effects and study progress.
Patient Selection
Patientswererecruitedat6participatingsitesfromAugust2011
through March 2014 (Figure 1). Eligible patients had to meet
all of the following inclusion criteria: (1) aged 18 years or older;
(2) had a diagnosis of definite or possible HHT16; (3) experi-
enced epistaxis lasting at least 1 minute, occurring at least once
weekly, and clinically stable during the preceding 8 weeks; and
(4) had an Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) of at least 3.0.17 Ma-
jor exclusion criteria included (1) estimated life expectancy of
less than 1 year; (2) a history of arterial or venous thrombo-
embolism within the past 6 months; (3) uncontrolled hyper-
tension; (4) presence of untreated brain arteriovenous mal-
formation; (5) active malignancy in the brain, lung, or colon;
(6) symptomatic heart failure; and (7) current or recent use of
any of the study treatments.
Patients of all races and ethnicities were eligible because
little is known about the role of race and ethnicity in the mani-
festations of HHT. The categories of white, black, Hispanic,
Asian, and other were used and were assigned by the investi-
gatororpatient.Additionalinclusionandexclusioncriteriaand
the complete research protocol appear in Supplement 1.
Randomization and Treatment
The North American Study of Epistaxis in HHT (NOSE) was a
multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase 2 trial of the ac-
tive treatment spray bevacizumab 1% (4 mg/d), estriol 0.1%
(0.4 mg/d), or tranexamic acid 10% (40 mg/d) compared with
a placebo spray (0.9% saline). Patients were stratified by
baseline epistaxis frequency (<7 bleeding episodes per week
ESS Epistaxis Severity Score
HHT hereditary hemorrhagic

HRE HHT-related epistaxis
Key Points
Question Will topical medical therapy with either bevacizumab,
estriol, or tranexamic acid improve epistaxis severity in patients
with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) compared with
a saline placebo?
Findings In this double-blind randomized clinical trial including
121 patients with HHT, the median epistaxis frequency was
7.0 bleeding episodes per week for bevacizumab, 8.0 per week
for estriol, and 7.5 per week for tranexamic acid compared with
8.0 per week with placebo, which is a nonsignificant difference.
Meaning There was no advantage to topical therapy with these
medications in these doses compared with frequent saline sprays
for reducing the frequency of epistaxis in patients with HHT.

vs ≥7 bleeding episodes per week) and study site. The random-
ization codes were issued in permuted blocks of 4 for each
stratification level within each site and were known only to the
dispensing pharmacy (O’
Brien Pharmacy) and the statisti-
cian (M.H.J.). All drugs were prepared by the pharmacy and
shipped directly to the patient.
Bevacizumab and tranexamic acid were prepared in 0.9%
saline. Estriol was prepared in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose
sodium suspension. All sprays included benzalkonium chlo-
ride 0.013% as a preservative and were dispensed in identical-
appearing, opaque, polyethylene-metered dose, spray bottles
(0.1 mL per spray, Letco Medical). Even though the estriol liq-
uid appeared to be more foamy than the other treatments, this
effectwashiddenbytheopaquebottles.Sprayconsistencyand
spray appearance were identical for all treatments. Patients in
all 4 treatment groups administered 1 spray (0.4 mL/d) in each
nostril twice daily for 12 weeks.
Anecdotal experience with bevacizumab suggested that
a topical nasal exposure lasting 1 to 2 weeks would result in a
treatment response lasting at least 3 to 4 months. Accord-
ingly, patients randomized to bevacizumab took active drug
for 1 week (total dose of 28 mg) followed by 0.9% saline for
11 weeks. Patients randomized to estriol, tranexamic acid,
or placebo took the corresponding drug for the full 12 weeks.
Adherence was assessed at the end of the study by subtract-
ing the measured residual volume from the original fill vol-
ume for each bottle, then dividing by the prescribed volume
(0.4 mL/d = 2.8 mL for bottle 1; 8.4 mL for bottle 2; and 11.2 mL
for bottles 3 and 4), and then multiplying by 100. All patients
were followed up for an additional 12 weeks after stopping
treatment. The use of any estrogen, tranexamic acid, epsilon
aminocaproic acid, or vascular endothelial growth factor in-
hibitor outside the study protocol was forbidden.
Outcomes and Assessments
The primary outcome was median weekly epistaxis fre-
quency during weeks 5 through 12 for each patient obtained
from the daily epistaxis diary. This period was chosen be-
cause drugs such as estriol may take several weeks for the on-
set of action to occur. An episode of epistaxis was defined as
blood dripping from the nose or down the back of the throat.
Secondaryoutcomesincludedmediandurationofepistaxisfor
each person from the epistaxis diary during weeks 5 through
12, ESS, hemoglobin and ferritin levels, need for transfusion,
emergency department visits, and treatment failure. Addi-
tional secondary outcomes including quality-of-life mea-
sures and satisfaction with treatment in relationship to other
HHT and epistaxis variables will be addressed in a subse-
quent report.
Patients were given a paper epistaxis diary at enrollment
and instructed to fill out the number of separate episodes and
total duration of bleeding on a daily basis starting with day 1

Patients were screened for eligibility at the 6 participating hereditary
hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) centers of excellence. The number assessed
for eligibility is an estimate based on the number of patients with HHT-related
epistaxis (HRE) seen annually at each site and the number of months each site
was enrolling patients. The specific reasons for exclusion were not
prospectively recorded. The number of exclusions is an estimate based on data
from the Augusta University center of excellence showing that 89% of patients
with HRE have 1 or more epistaxis episodes per week.

of taking the drug and continuing for 24 weeks or until study
withdrawal. Baseline epistaxis diary data were not collected
prior to initiating drug therapy.
Treatment failure was defined as the occurrence of any of
the following during the 12-week treatment period: transfu-
sion of more than 12 units of blood; electrocautery, chemical
cautery, or laser ablation of nasal telangiectases; nasal septal
dermoplasty; Young nasal closure surgery; initiation of a new
treatment modality for epistaxis; withdrawal from the study
due to treatment adverse effects; or death related to epistaxis
or the study protocol. Additional assessment information and
a full discussion of ESS derivation appear in Supplement 2.
Statistical Analysis
Epistaxis frequency was originally hypothesized to be 7 epi-
sodes per week with an SD of 5 episodes per week based on
the recent experience at the Augusta University HHT center
ofexcellence.Thefrequencyofepistaxiswascalculatedsothat
a sample size of 30 patients in each of the 4 groups would pro-
vide85%poweratanαlevelof.05todetecta50%reduction8,15
(mean, 3 episodes per week; SD, 5 episodes per week) in the 3
treatment groups and no change in patients in the placebo
group. After the first 66 patients had been enrolled, an un-
planned analysis of self-reported frequency of epistaxis per
week at enrollment showed that the epistaxis frequency was
actually11episodesperweekwithanSDof7episodesperweek.
A revised power calculation found that a sample size of 25 pa-
tients in each of the 4 groups would provide 85% power at an
α level of .05 to detect a 50% reduction in epistaxis frequency
in the 3 treatment groups (mean, 5 episodes per week; SD, 7
episodes per week) and no change in the placebo group. A total
sample size of 120 was determined to allow for dropout and
was agreed on by the investigators.
Continuous data were summarized using means and
95% CIs unless skewed in which case medians and interquar-
tile ranges (IQRs) were used. Categorical data are presented as
frequencies and percentages for each drug group. The pri-
mary outcome variable for each patient was derived from the
epistaxis diary as the median weekly epistaxis count for weeks
5 through 12. This variable was skewed so a log transforma-
tion was performed prior to the analysis. Analysis of variance
was used to analyze the primary outcome variable for the ef-
fect of each drug while accounting for clinical site as a ran-
dom effect. Exploratory subgroup analyses for epistaxis fre-
quency and nasal irrigation use also were performed. The
secondary outcome of total duration was derived from the epi-
staxis diary as the median weekly epistaxis duration for weeks
5 through 12 for each patient. The duration per bleeding epi-
sode was calculated as the duration per week divided by the
count for each week for weeks 5 through 12. The median total
duration of bleeding episodes per week for weeks 5 through
12 was obtained in a similar manner for each patient.
Alogtransformationwasusedpriortotheanalysisofthese
variables. Analysis of variance was used to analyze the dura-
tion outcomes for the effect of each drug while accounting for
clinicalsiteasarandomeffect.Analysisofcovariancewasused
to analyze hemoglobin and ferritin levels at week 12 for drug
effects while adjusting for baseline values and accounting for
clinical site as a random effect. A log transformation was used
for ferritin level prior to analysis. Fisher exact tests were used
to analyze categorical secondary outcomes and adverse drug
effects. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of vari-
ancewasusedtoanalyzeESSfordrugandtime(baseline,week
12, and week 24) effects in which clinical site and patient were
included in the model as random effects. A compound sym-
metric error structure was used to model the within-patient
correlation.
Data were considered missing at random and were not im-
puted for this analysis; least-squares means with 95% CIs are
reported. A Tukey test was used to compare means from sig-
nificant analyses of variance. Two-sided testing was per-
formed for all analyses with a significance level of .05. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc).
Results
Consecutive patients were screened for eligibility at 6 partici-
pating HHT centers of excellence (Figure 1). Of 123 willing pa-
tients who met initial inclusion criteria, 1 was found to have a
brain arteriovenous malformation prior to randomization and
was excluded. Another patient withdrew consent prior to ran-
domization, leaving a total of 121 patients who were random-
ized to topical therapy or placebo (Figure 1 and Table 1). A total
of 29 patients were randomized to bevacizumab, 31 patients
to estriol, 33 patients to tranexamic acid, and 28 patients to
placebo. After randomization, a patient from the estriol group
was excluded for the protocol violation of using of an estrogen-
containing medication, leaving 120 patients.
Among the 121 patients who were randomized (mean
age, 52.8 years [SD, 12.9 years]; 44% women with a median of
7.0 weekly episodes of epistaxis [IQR, 3.0-14.0]), 106 patients
completed the study duration for the primary outcome mea-
sure (43 were women [41%]). There were 14 patients with
missing data for the primary outcome due to misunderstand-
ing the diary instructions (n = 6), dropping out of the study
prior to week 5 (n = 7; 5 treatment failure and 2 lost to follow-
up), or no diary provided (n = 1). There were an additional 6
patients for whom the median was calculated based on par-
tial data (range, 3-7 weeks out of 8 weeks). The baseline char-
acteristics of the enrolled patients appear in Table 1. Most
patients had moderate epistaxis with a mean ESS between
5.2 and 5.7 for the 4 groups. The majority of patients experi-
enced greater than 7 episodes of epistaxis per week. Based on
self-reported age of onset of epistaxis, the patients had expe-
rienced a mean of 37.9 years (95% CI, 35.3-40.5 years) of
intermittent epistaxis.
Adherence was reviewed at interim telephone follow-up
visits, and was assessed by measuring the residual volume in
the study bottles following the active treatment phase. Be-
cause bevacizumab was only present in bottle 1, the residual
volumeinbottle1andbottles2through4werecomparedsepa-
rately. The patients randomized to bevacizumab used 110% of
the expected volume of drug, whereas the other 3 groups used
between 85% and 89% of the expected volume (P < .05 for

comparison across groups). All groups used 90% to 97% of the
totalexpectedvolumefromall4bottlesduringthefull12-week
period without any other significant differences. A total of 108
patients (90%) successfully completed the 12-week treat-
mentprotocol,with10(8%)experiencingtreatmentfailureand
2 (2%) lost to follow-up. The epistaxis diary used for the pri-
mary outcome was completely filled out for 100 patients (83%)
and 106 patients (88%) had at least partial data during weeks
5 through 12. A total of 87 patients (73%) also completed the
subsequent 12-week observation phase of the trial.
The primary outcome of epistaxis frequency between
weeks 5 through 12 was not significantly different between any
of the active drug groups and the placebo group or between
any of the therapeutic agents (P = .97 for drug effect; Table 2
and eFigure in Supplement 2). Patients receiving placebo had
a median of 8.0 episodes (IQR, 3.0-14.0 episodes) of epistaxis
perweek.After12weeksoftreatment,themedianweeklynum-
ber of bleeding episodes was 7.0 (IQR, 4.5-10.5) for patients in
the bevacizumab group, 8.0 (IQR, 4.0-12.0) for the estriol
group, 7.5 (IQR, 3.0-11.0) for the tranexamic acid group, and
8.0 (IQR, 3.0-14.0) for the placebo group. The outcome was
similar for patients based on the subgroup analysis using the
prespecified stratification of baseline epistaxis frequency.
For the secondary outcome of epistaxis duration, no drug
treatmentwassignificantlydifferentfromplacebo(Table2and
eFigure in Supplement 2). The median epistaxis duration in
minutes per bleeding episode was not significantly different
for patients receiving bevacizumab (3.0; IQR, 1.6-5.5), estriol
(4.0; IQR, 1.6-6.3), tranexamic acid (6.2; IQR, 3.0-9.4), and pla-
cebo (5.0; IQR, 3.0-9.8).

transfused for each affected patient, rather than an estimate of center (mean or median) and estimate of
variability that would be imprecise due to the small number of events.

All 4 groups experienced a significant decline in ESS from
baseline to week 12 (Figure 2 and eTable 1 in Supplement 2;
P < .001 for time effect). The placebo group decreased from a
median ESS of 5.71 (95% CI, 5.04-6.38) to a median ESS of 3.74
(95% CI, 3.17-4.31). Similar declines in ESS were seen for be-
vacizumab from 5.16 (95% CI, 4.75-5.57) to 3.54 (95% CI, 3.00-
4.08);estriol,from5.19(95%CI,4.71-5.68)to3.56(95%CI,2.81-
4.30); and tranexamic acid, from 5.43 (95% CI, 4.94-5.91) to
4.06 (95% CI, 3.50-4.61). There was no significant drug ef-
fect. The improvement in ESS was clinically significant.
All groups worsened by week 24 (P = .01 for time effect vs
week 12) but remained significantly improved from baseline
(P < .001 for time effect) with a median ESS of 4.26 (95% CI,
3.65-4.88) for the placebo group, 3.88 (95% CI, 3.28-4.47) for
the bevacizumab group, 3.83 (95% CI, 2.61-5.04) for the es-
triolgroup,and4.40(95%CI,3.67-5.12)forthetranexamicacid
group. The improvement for each group exceeded the mini-
mallyimportantdifferencefortheESS18atweeks12and24rela-
tive to baseline. However, the change from week 12 to 24 did
not meet the minimally important difference.
There were 10 patients who experienced treatment fail-
ure with no between-group differences (Table 2). The reason
for 8 of the 10 patients experiencing treatment failure was due
to patient preference to pursue laser therapy or open-label
treatments. There was no significant drug effect on level of he-
moglobin or ferritin. Two patients exceeded the transfusion
limit and were withdrawn from the trial. There was no drug
effectontransfusionrequirementsordifferencesintheamount
of patients seeking emergency department care.
Given the improvement in ESS seen for the placebo group
(Figure 2 and eTable 1 in Supplement 2) and the possibility that
saline irrigation had a therapeutic effect, an exploratory sub-
group analysis of the primary outcome was performed based
on nasal irrigation status at baseline (Table 2). No drug effect
was observed in either group.
The study therapies were generally well tolerated (Table 3
and eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Nasal symptoms were the most
common concern for patients in all 4 study groups. Signifi-
cant drug effects were seen for patients with gastrointestinal
symptoms including abdominal pain and nausea or vomiting
(P < .05 for comparison across groups), and these were most
commonly experienced by patients receiving tranexamic acid.

Data markers indicate least-squares means and 95% CIs. Patients reported
epistaxis severity using the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), which is a validated
tool to quantify hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia–related epistaxis on the
basis of responses to 6 weighted questions. The scores range from 0 to 10 with
higher scores reflecting greater epistaxis severity. The overall mean ESS at
baseline for the combined groups is shown for reference, together with the
established threshold for the minimally important difference (0.71).18 No
treatment group differences were significant. Groups were compared using a
mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance to analyze ESS for
treatment and time effects. Each treatment group experienced a significant
improvement from baseline (week 0) to the end of the active treatment phase
at week 12 (P < .001). Compared with week 12, all groups had worsened by the
end of the observation phase at week 24 (P = .01), but this remained an
improvement compared with baseline (P < .001). The degree of improvement
compared with baseline remained greater than the established minimally
important difference for all groups by the end of week 24.
a After randomization, 1 patient was excluded for the protocol violation of using
an estrogen-containing medication, leaving 30 patients in this group.

Discussion
Patients with HHT have impaired quality of life that is driven
primarily by HRE.3 Therapy for HRE has evolved over the years
through mostly trial and error, supported by anecdotal re-
ports of benefit.15 NOSE was a randomized double-blind
placebo-controlled trial of therapy for HRE conducted at 6
NorthAmericanHHTcentersofexcellence,withpowertoiden-
tify a clinically meaningful improvement in HRE for any of 3
putative topical (nasal spray) therapies: bevacizumab, es-
triol, or tranexamic acid. None of the 3 topical therapies was
any better at decreasing epistaxis frequency than twice-daily
saline sprays. No serious adverse effects were seen in this
study. The placebo intervention of twice-daily saline sprays is
frequently recommended for patients with HRE19 but has not
previously been studied.
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized antibody
directed against vascular endothelial growth factor, and is
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in
patients with colorectal or other cancers. After initial case re-
ports that intravenous bevacizumab with oncology dosing im-
proves bleeding in patients with HHT,20,21 subsequent re-
ports suggest efficacy at lower doses22,23 or with submucosal24
or topical treatment.15 While the NOSE trial was in progress, a
phase 1 study of 1-time dosing of topical bevacizumab for HRE
was reported.10 This study demonstrated safety across a range
of doses but lacked power to demonstrate efficacy. The dose
of bevacizumab (4 mg/d) was chosen based on a case report15
and the anecdotal experiences of the design committee, and
may have been inadequate. Future trials should consider a
baseline run-in period with placebo spray and active therapy
at a higher dose, longer duration, or both.
There was no significant benefit to the use of topical es-
triol compared with placebo. As with bevacizumab, there was
no effect on epistaxis frequency. Therapy with estriol was gen-
erally well tolerated. The use of estriol was not restricted to
females, yet no greater estrogen adverse effects were experi-
enced by males in the trial. It is possible that 12 weeks is too
soontojudgetheefficacyofestriol.Apriorstudyofestrioloint-
ment in 12 patients found that conversion of the nasal mu-
cosa to a stratified squamous epithelium was not complete un-
til 12 months,13 with some significant changes occurring by 6
months. However, it was judged that for a treatment to be clini-
cally acceptable for patients, it would have to be effective
within 3 months.
Although oral tranexamic acid has been previously shown
to improve epistaxis duration for HRE,7,10 there was no benefit
to topical tranexamic acid in this study. Furthermore, sys-
temic adverse effects in the trial tended to be mild and overall
showed no difference for any group, whereas gastrointestinal
adverse effects were more common for patients who received
tranexamic acid than those who received estriol or bevaci-
zumab. Oral tranexamic acid is associated with gastrointesti-
nal adverse effects.7 Despite the lower overall dose with topi-
cal therapy, patients who received tranexamic acid reported a
significantlyhigherlikelihoodofabdominalpainthanthosewho
received placebo or estriol (Table 3). Nausea and vomiting were
morecommoninpatientswhoreceivedtranexamicacidorpla-
cebo than in those who received estriol (Table 3). There were
moreoverallgastrointestinaladverseeffectsinpatientswhore-
ceived tranexamic acid than those who received bevacizumab
orestriol(eTable2inSupplement2).Theseadverseeffectswere
not offset by any efficacy to justify therapeutic use.
This study has several important limitations. One key limi-
tationisthelackofabaselineepistaxisdiary,whichwouldhave
allowed a comparison for each patient’
s epistaxis parameters
between baseline and while receiving treatment and an as-
sessment of the placebo effect of saline. Topical therapy has
unique challenges relative to systemic therapy. It is possible
that drug absorption may have been hampered because of lo-
cal scab and crust formation causing a barrier to drug penetra-
tion to the mucosa. The use of saline or carboxymethylcellu-
lose may have provided only transient exposure of the drug
tothemucosa,whereasagel,ointment,ormucoadhesivepoly-
mer may have allowed for better absorption. In this study, it
was not possible to directly assess tissue drug levels, and there
is no direct pharmacokinetic data for this mode of delivery. Of
the3drugs,therecombinantantibodybevacizumabisthelarg-
est molecule and the agent with most concern for drug ab-
sorption. In support of this mode of delivery, an ex vivo study
of topical bevacizumab penetration into porcine nasal mu-
cosa found that the majority of a 0.5-mg dose delivered to the
mucosa could be recovered, including 40% of the dose either
within or across the mucosal barrier.25
Conclusions
Among patients with HHT, there were no significant between-
groupdifferencesintheuseoftopicalintranasaltreatmentwith
bevacizumab vs estriol vs tranexamic acid vs placebo and epi-
staxis frequency.
