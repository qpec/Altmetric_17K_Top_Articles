Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Mounting evidence indicates that Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass (RYGB) ameliorates type 2 diabetes, but
randomised trials comparing surgical vs nonsurgical care are
needed. With a parallel-group randomised controlled trial
(RCT), we compared RYGB vs an intensive lifestyle and med-
ical intervention (ILMI) for type 2 diabetes, including among
patients with a BMI <35 kg/m2.
Methods By use of a shared decision-making recruitment strat-
egy targeting the entire at-risk population within an integrated
community healthcare system, we screened 1,808 adults meet-
ing inclusion criteria (age 25–64, with type 2 diabetes and a
BMI 30–45 kg/m2). Of these, 43 were allocated via concealed,
computer-generated random assignment in a 1:1 ratio to RYGB
or ILMI. The latter involved ≥45 min of aerobic exercise 5 days
per week, a dietitian-directed weight- and glucose-lowering
diet, and optimal diabetes medical treatment for 1 year.
Although treatment allocation could not be blinded, outcomes
were determined by a blinded adjudicator. The primary out-
come was diabetes remission at 1 year (HbA1c <6.0%
[<42.1 mmol/mol], off all diabetes medicines).
Results Twenty-three volunteers were assigned to RYGB and
20 to ILMI. Of these, 11 withdrew before receiving any inter-
vention. Hence 15 in the RYGB group and 17 in the IMLI group
were analysed throughout 1 year. The groups were equivalent
regarding all baseline characteristics, except that the RYGB co-
hort had a longer diabetes duration (11.4±4.8 vs 6.8±5.2 years,
p=0.009). Weight loss at 1 year was 25.8±14.5% vs 6.4±5.8%
after RYGB vs ILMI, respectively (p<0.001). The ILMI exer-
cise programme yielded a 22 ± 11% increase in V
IO2max
(p<0.0001), whereas V
IO2max after RYGB was unchanged.
Diabetes remission at 1 year was 60.0% with RYGB vs 5.9%
with ILMI (p=0.002). The HbA1c decline over 1 year was only
modestly more after RYGB than ILMI: from 7.7 ± 1.0%
(60.7 mmol/mol) to 6.4±1.6% (46.4 mmol/mol) vs 7.3±0.9%
(56.3 mmol/mol) to 6.9±1.3% (51.9 mmol/mol), respectively
(p=0.04); however, this drop occurred with significantly fewer
or no diabetes medications after RYGB. No life-threatening
complications occurred.
Conclusions/interpretation Compared with the most rigorous
ILMI yet tested against surgery in a randomised trial, RYGB
yielded greater type 2 diabetes remission in mild-to-
moderately obese patients recruited from a well-informed,
population-based sample.

Introduction
Obesity and diabetes are the fastest growing, and among the
most important, contributors to disability and death worldwide
[1]. Despite an ever-increasing armamentarium of pharmaceu-
tical and behavioural approaches to combat these twin pan-
demics, major weight loss is uncommonly sustained for
prolonged periods using nonsurgical means, and up to 90%
of patients with type 2 diabetes fail to achieve treatment goals
established to prevent long-term complications [2].
Furthermore, most diabetes medications promote weight gain,
potentially compromising metabolic benefits.
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) dramatically
improves glycaemic control, leading to type 2 diabetes remis-
sion in most cases [3], through mechanisms beyond just re-
duced food intake and body weight [4]. Large observational
studies report that in severely obese individuals, bariatric sur-
gery is associated with long-term reductions in all major car-
diovascular disease (CVD) risk factors [5, 6], CVD events
such as myocardial infarctions and strokes [7], cancer [8]
and all-cause mortality [9, 10], including a 92% decrease in
diabetes-related deaths [10]. Results from these observational
studies, however, may be biased because the characteristics of
populations who undergo surgery can differ from those who
do not (i.e. unmeasured confounding) [11–13]. If individuals
who choose to undergo surgery are more motivated to im-
prove their health, they may also be more medically compliant
and/or lead healthier lifestyles. Such concerns limit the utility
of observational data, even from the most exemplary investi-
gations, such as the Swedish Obese Subjects study [5–9].
Establishing the proper place of bariatric surgery in diabe-
tes care requires evidence from randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) directly comparing medical and/or behavioural vs sur-
gical approaches, and evaluating the full range of benefits and
risks. The latter remain particularly concerning for surgery.
Although operative complications have steadily decreased
with refinement of minimally invasive laparoscopic tech-
niques [14], long-term risks remain to be determined [15].
Despite the challenges of successfully recruiting and random-
ly allocating participants into treatment arms as diverse as
major surgery vs medical/lifestyle interventions, several
RCTs have recently reported that various bariatric operations
are more effective than nonsurgical approaches in improving
glycaemic control and decreasing other CVD risk factors over
1–3 years [16–22]. However, the lifestyle interventions in most
of these were not as rigorous as they might have been [23], and
there is still limited evidence in patients with a BMI <35 kg/m2,
the standard minimum threshold for bariatric surgery.
We sought to address these issues in the CROSSROADS
trial (Calorie Reduction Or Surgery: Seeking to Reduce
Obesity And Diabetes Study). By use of a population-based
recruitment strategy to enrol patients with type 2 diabetes and
a BMI of 30–45 kg/m2, we conducted a prospective RCT
comparing RYGB to an intensive lifestyle and medical inter-
vention (ILMI), including aggressive, supervised dieting and
exercise, modelled after the Diabetes Prevention Program
(DPP) [24] and LookAHEAD trials [25]. Our novel recruit-
ment methods used a shared decision-making (SDM) ap-
proach to identify, screen, educate and randomise all adults
who demonstrated equipoise between surgical and lifestyle
treatment of obesity and diabetes in a large, integrated
healthcare delivery system [11].
Methods
CROSSROADS is a parallel-group RCT executed by investi-
gators at the University of Washington, Group Health
Research Institute (GHRI), and Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center (FHCRC) (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT01295229). Institutional review board approval was ob-
tained from all three institutions. The ILMI was provided free
of charge. All pre-operative, operative and post-operative care
costs for RYGB were paid by Group Health insurance, GHRI,
or the Group Health Foundation. Participants were paid
US$25 per visit for attending in-person study data collection
visits outside of routine care.
Recruitment and randomisation process
By using a population-based SDM approach previously de-
scribed in greater detail [11], recruitment was conducted be-
tween July 2011 and June 2012 at Group Health Cooperative,
an integrated healthcare system with >600,000 members. We
first searched electronic databases to identify potentially eligi-
ble participants. Candidates were then approached by mail and
phone, and carefully screened using a multi-phase recruitment
process [11]. A study physician obtained in-person, written
informed consent, and 1:1 randomisation was conducted via
computer-generated random assignment, stratified by BMI
≥35 kg/m2, with allocation concealed. Although blinding to
treatment allocation during the interventions was not possible,
final outcomes were determined by a blinded adjudicator
946
Diabetologia (2016) 59:945–953
 (DRF). Sample size was determined based on prior related
studies [16, 17].
Participant eligibility
Candidates were considered eligible if they were 25–64 years
old, had a BMI of 30–45 kg/m2, were currently taking diabetes
medications, were covered by insurance that had a bariatric
surgery rider (if BMI 35–45 kg/m2), and were willing to ac-
cept randomisation into either intervention group and then
follow the full protocol for ≥1 year. Candidates were consid-
ered ineligible if they had any of the following: pregnancy,
cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), ascites, peritoneal
effusion, dementia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, cirrhosis,
end-stage renal disease, human immunodeficiency virus, in-
flammatory bowel disease, diagnosed type 1 diabetes, diabe-
tes secondary to a specific disease or glucocorticoid therapy,
prior bariatric or major gastrointestinal surgery or organ trans-
plantation. These exclusions were designed to eliminate pa-
tients who were at greater-than-average risk for complications,
disease-related weight change or nonadherence to treatment
and follow-up visits.
The ILMI
The ILMI was a 12-month, in-person and telephone-based
programme that included behaviour modification skills coun-
selling, combined with training in diet and exercise change.
Exercise intervention The focus of the exercise intervention
was a gradual increase in brisk walking or other activities of
similar moderate aerobic intensity over 12 months. Participants
were asked to attend ≥3 exercise physiologist-supervised ses-
sions per week at the FHCRC Prevention Center Exercise
Testing and Training Center, a dedicated research gym, and
they were asked to exercise an additional ≥2 days/week at
home for the first 6 months. For the remaining 6 months, par-
ticipants were asked to exercise ≥1 day/week at the Prevention
Center and ≥4 days/week at home. In summary, they were
directed to exercise ≥45 min/day, ≥5 days/week, for 1 year.
Dietary intervention The dietary intervention was conducted
by a research dietitian trained in behaviour modification. Each
participant was required to attend weekly group nutrition ses-
sions for the first 6 months. These sessions were based on DPP
[24], with several modifications for our diabetic participants.
Although reduced calorie intake and weight loss were strongly
encouraged, participants were not given specific weight loss
goals. Instead, the dietary intervention emphasised food qual-
ity by encouraging consumption of protein, fresh fruits and
vegetables, and avoidance of processed foods. The pro-
gramme advocated a slightly higher percentage of energy
from protein and fat, combined with avoidance of high
glycaemic index foods. In the second 6-month phase of the
study, participants were contacted weekly by the dietitian via
telephone or email, and were encouraged to attend monthly in-
person group nutrition sessions.
Diabetes-related medical care Medical care, including phar-
maceutical diabetes treatment, was provided similarly in both
groups by each participant’s own primary care physician,
based on guidelines of the American Diabetes Association
(ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes
[26]. Study staff conducted quarterly chart reviews to ensure
these guidelines were met. Hypertension and lipid-lowering
medications were prescribed according to ADA guidelines
using the following treatment goals: blood pressure ≤130/
80 mmHg and LDL-cholesterol ≤2.6 mmol/l.
Laparoscopic RYGB
Participants randomised to surgery underwent a laparoscopic
proximal RYGB, using an estimated 40 ml gastric pouch,
100–150 cm alimentary limb, a biliopancreatic limb that in-
cluded 30–50 cm of jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz, an
antecolic/antegastric approach, and combined stapled and su-
tured technique. Surgical patients also underwent a 4-week
pre-operative and 10-month postoperative behavioural treat-
ment regimen. In the pre-operative phase, patients had weekly
telephone-based appointments with a health educator and
were required to attend 2–3 bariatric support group meetings.
Patients continued to have phone appointments with their
health educator for 10 months after surgery. The postoperative
behavioural treatment programme focused on diet and nutri-
tion counselling, behaviour modification and exercise
recommendations.
Outcomes and data collection
The primary outcome was the percentage of participants in
each group who achieved diabetes remission at 1 year, defined
as an HbA1c of <6.0% (<42.1 mmol/mol), off all diabetes
medications. Secondary outcomes included changes in fasting
glucose and insulin levels, estimated insulin sensitivity, body
weight, waist circumference, body composition, blood pres-
sure, plasma lipids, aerobic fitness, medication usage, quality
of life and safety.
Data were collected during in-person study visits at base-
line, 6 and 12 months. Additional information was gathered
using chart reviews from all clinical visits during the 12-month
study. Data collected at in-person visits included height;
weight; waist circumference; per cent lean and fat mass deter-
mined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and bio-
electrical impedance plethysmography (baseline and
12 months only); blood pressure; heart rate; fasting plasma
levels of glucose and insulin; levels of HbA1c and cholesterol;

 quality of life measured with the EQ-5D questionnaire; and
adverse events. The HOMA-IR index (glucose×insulin/22.5)
was calculated as a rough estimate of insulin resistance. A
physical activity questionnaire was administered at baseline,
6 and 12 months. Cardiorespiratory fitness

IO2maxÞ
�
was
assessed using a maximal graded treadmill test according to
a modified branching protocol (baseline and 12 months only).
This metric is often expressed as oxygen consumption per kg
of body weight. However, major weight changes skew data
normalised in this manner, leading to erroneous conclusions.
Hence we report only absolute V
IO2max. Adverse events were
captured at each study visit using a standardised questionnaire
(available from authors by request) and by automated surveil-
lance of our electronic databases.
Data analysis
The randomised RYGB and ILMI groups were assessed for
demographic and baseline health differences using the Mann–
Whitney test or Fisher’s exact test as applicable. By using an
intention-to-treat approach, we tested for differences in health
outcomes between baseline and follow-up within each inter-
vention group, and also for differences in the magnitude of
change in outcomes between intervention groups. There was
no loss to follow-up for our primary outcome at 1 year. Given
the sample size, there was not enough statistical power to de-
fend normality assumptions necessary to use parametric analy-
sis methods such as a t test; instead, we used the nonparametric
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and Mann–Whitney tests.
Additionally, we performed a series of regression models
predicting the change in each health metric using the interven-
tion group and the health metric at baseline as independent
variables. Results were from the Mann–Whitney test and re-
gressions were concordant.
Results
Participant characteristics
The results of screening, education and randomisation are
summarised in Fig. 1 and have been described elsewhere in
detail [11]. We screened 1,808 candidates who, based on ad-
ministrative and clinical databases, fulfilled essential inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Among these, 43 people (2.4%) were
ultimately randomised (23 to surgery, 20 to ILMI). Eight in-
dividuals in the surgical group and three in the ILMI group
withdrew shortly after randomisation, before starting either
intervention. These 11 individuals did not complete our base-
line study visit; thus, 32 participants are included in our
analyses. Of these, five surgery participants and six ILMI
participants had baseline BMI <35 kg/m2. Among participants
who initiated their intervention, everyone completed follow-
up data collection through 1 year, except for one person in
each arm who did not provide fitness and body composition
data at the last time point.
Participant characteristics are displayed in Table 1. At base-
line, the two randomised groups were equivalent regarding mea-
sures of demographics, anthropometrics, body composition, fit-
ness, glycaemic control, insulin use, plasma lipids and blood
pressure. Mean BMI for the entire cohort was 37.7 kg/m2 and
HbA1c was moderately well controlled at 7.5%
(58.5 mmol/mol). Of the 24 variables shown in Table 1, only
one differed across groups at baseline. The surgical group had
longer duration of known diabetes than the ILMI group (11.4
±4.8 vs 6.8±5.2 years, p=0.009).

 at 1 year was achieved in 60.0% of participants after RYGB vs
5.9% with ILMI (p=0.002). The same results occurred using
a threshold of HbA1c <6.5% (<47.5 mmol/mol), i.e. ‘partial
remission’ [27]. The odds ratio for diabetes remission at 1 year
after RYGB compared with ILMI was 19.8 (95% CI 2.0,
194.6, p=0.003). In exploratory analyses, diabetes remission
was not predicted by baseline BMI, age or sex, or by the
amount of weight lost during 1 year, and there was no corre-
lation between change in body weight and change in HbA1c at
6 or 12 months among those having RYGB; however, the
study was not specifically powered to detect this. In further
exploratory analyses, there were no apparent differences in the
primary outcome among subgroups stratified according to in-
sulin usage or median duration of diabetes at baseline.
The magnitude of HbA1c decline over 1 year was only
modestly more after RYGB than ILMI: from 7.7 ± 1.0%
(60.7 mmol/mol) to 6.4 ± 1.6% (46.4 mmol/mol) vs 7.3
±0.9% (56.3 mmol/mol) to 6.9±1.3% (51.9 mmol/mol), re-
spectively (p=0.04), and mean HbA1c values were not statis-
tically different between the groups at baseline, 6 or 12 months
(Figs 2 and 3). However, average HbA1c fell progressively
over time after RYGB, whereas it reached a nadir at 6 months
with ILMI then tended to increase back toward baseline, and
the surgical group used fewer diabetes medications at
12 months than the ILMI group (mean 0.5±0.2 vs 1.2±0.2
medicines, respectively, p=0.009). Although insulin usage
tended to be higher at baseline in RYGB compared with
ILMI patients (60% vs 47%), it was less in the surgical group
at 12 months (27% vs 41%).
Fasting plasma glucose levels tended to decline in both
groups, but these changes were not statistically significant, nor
were there differences between interventions (Fig. 3). By con-
trast, fasting plasma insulin levels decreased significantly with
RYGB (from 160±102 to 42±22 pmol/l, p=0.001) and also

 with ILMI (from 187±135 to 134±109 pmol/l, p=0.002), al-
though the magnitude of change was much greater after surgery
(p<0.001). Similarly, HOMA-IR decreased significantly with
both RYGB (from 7.5±3.9 to 1.8±0.9, p=0.0001) and ILMI
(from 9.2±6.8 to 6.6±4.1, p=0.005), but the magnitude of
decline was much greater after surgery (p=0.011).
Anthropometrics and body composition
Body weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio
and per cent body fat mass all decreased significantly by
12 months within each group (Fig. 3 and data not shown),
but the magnitude of decline for each of these variables was
greater with surgery than ILMI. Weight loss at 1 year was
25.8±14.5% vs 6.4±5.8% after RYGB vs ILMI, respectively
(p<0.001 for change over time within each group individual-
ly and also comparing the magnitude of change between
groups).
Despite significant weight loss in the ILMI group,
lean body mass remained stable among these individuals
(Fig. 3). By contrast, lean body mass decreased by 10%
in the surgical group (from 55.0 ± 9.2 to 49.6 ± 8.5 kg;
p = 0.0001 for change over time in this group, and
p < 0.001 for difference in magnitude of change between
groups).

 Other metabolic health outcomes
Systolic blood pressure decreased from baseline to 12 months
in the surgical arm (from 129 ± 21 to 110 ± 10 mmHg,
p=0.003), but did not change in the ILMI arm (from 120
±10 to 116±10, p=0.23; Fig. 3). Diastolic blood pressure
was similar at baseline and 12 months in both groups and
did not significantly change with either intervention.
However, surgical patients used one-third as many hyperten-
sion medications at 12 months as ILMI patients (0.6±0.2 vs
1.8±0.4 medications, p=0.014).
Plasma HDL-cholesterol increased significantly (Fig. 3)
between baseline and 12 months in each group (from 1.1
±0.3 to 1.5±0.3 mmol/l with RYGB, p=0.0004; from 1.1
±0.2 to 1.3±0.3 mmol/l with ILMI, p=0.02), and there was a
trend for a greater increase with surgery (p = 0.08).
Triacylglycerol levels decreased significantly in each group
(from 1.7 ± 0.7 to 1.1 ± 0.4 mmol/l with RYGB, p =0.005;
from 2.3±1.1 to 1.5±0.6 mmol/l with ILMI, p=0.002), with
similar magnitude of change in both groups (p=0.50). Neither
total nor LDL-cholesterol changed from baseline to 12 months
in either group, and there were no differences between groups
in these variables at either of these time points or when com-
paring changes over time between groups. There was no dif-
ference between groups in the number of lipid-lowering med-
ications used at 12 months (0.4±0.1 vs 0.5±0.2 medications
in surgery vs ILMI, respectively, p=0.62).
Quality of life
As determined by EQ-5D at baseline and 12 months, overall
health ratings improved within each group (from 77.5±14.3
to 87.2±8.2 for RYGB, p=0.021; from 62.1±20.7 to 76.5
±11.9 for ILMI, p=0.035). The magnitude of this improve-
ment was not different between groups (p=0.34).
Adverse events
During the year of observation, there were no deaths or
hospitalisations for serious surgical adverse events (venous
thromboembolism, hospitalisation ≥30 days, re-intervention)
in either group of enrolled participants. Overall, there were 64
adverse events in the ILMI group and 31 in the RYGB group.
Notably, these included more hypoglycaemic events with
ILMI than RYGB: 43 vs 16, respectively, including four se-
vere hypoglycaemias in ILMI (i.e. blood glucose <2.2 mmol/l,
or <3.3 mmol/l with neuroglycopenic symptoms) vs none af-
ter RYGB. The only other severe adverse event was an emer-
gency room visit for acute alcohol intoxication in one RYGB
patient. Other reported minor adverse events were very di-
verse and displayed no obvious differential patterns between
groups, except that musculoskeletal complaints were reported
in seven cases with ILMI vs two with RYGB.
Discussion
We used a population-based recruitment strategy [11], along
with a unique, validated SDM instrument [28] to educate
study candidates regarding treatment options, to conduct a
prospective RCT of RYGB vs ILMI to treat metabolic disease
among patients with type 2 diabetes and a BMI of
30–45 kg/m2. At 1 year, surgery was superior to ILMI for
diabetes remission, glycaemic control, and reductions in body
weight, adiposity, systolic blood pressure, estimated insulin
resistance, overall health state, and usage of medications for
diabetes and hypertension, with a trend for surgical superiority
to increase HDL-cholesterol levels. The two interventions
were equally effective at decreasing triacylglycerols, and
ILMI was superior at increasing physical fitness and maintain-
ing lean body mass despite weight loss. Neither intervention
significantly affected diastolic blood pressure, total cholester-
ol or LDL-cholesterol. The most impressive benefit of surgery
compared with ILMI was in ameliorating diabetes, even
though by chance the surgical group started with a duration
of diabetes nearly twice that of the ILMI group, which biases
against such surgical superiority.
Our trial confirms and extends findings from prior
RCTs and nonrandomised studies, which together indi-
cate that laparoscopic RYGB is safe, conferring no ap-
parent greater risk among people with a BMI <35 kg/m2
than among those with a BMI >35 kg/m2, the currently
accepted threshold for bariatric surgery [16–22, 29]. The
all-cause 30-day mortality from laparoscopic RYGB is
<0.3% [30–32], similar to that for cholecystectomy and
hysterectomy. We observed considerable loss of lean
body mass after RYGB, whereas it was preserved de-
spite significant weight loss in the ILMI group follow-
ing a strenuous exercise programme. The long-term con-
sequences of RYGB-induced reductions in lean mass are
unclear but warrant examination. Importantly, ILMI also
involved risks, and compared with RYGB, we observed
more total and serious hypoglycaemic events in this
group (which ended up using significantly more
glucose-lowering medications), as well as more muscu-
loskeletal complaints.
Several features distinguish this study from prior related
RCTs [16–22]. For example, typical previous recruitment
strategies are likely to have enrolled highly motivated partic-
ipants who may actively seek participation in studies, theoret-
ically limiting the generalisability of the findings [11]. By
contrast, our population-based, SDM approach to identify,
educate and enrol participants from a broad at-risk population
was designed to yield a more representative and generalisable
study sample. Despite our extensive efforts, we found that
randomised participants still differed significantly from the
overall population of potentially eligible adults in terms of
their sex, disease severity and hypoglycaemic medication
Diabetologia (2016) 59:945–953
951
 use [11]. Thus, we failed to demonstrate that our SDM recruit-
ment approach would yield a more representative and
generalisable study sample than in prior RCTs.
Whereas the lifestyle interventions in prior studies may not
have been considered the most rigorous [23], we used a highly
intensive nonsurgical intervention, including an aggressive,
supervised dieting and aerobic exercise regimen, modelled
after the DPP [24] and LookAHEAD trials [25], along with
state-of-the-art pharmaceutical care. Our findings indicate that
even completion of what we view as the most intensive life-
style–medical approach that could reasonably be considered
in practice cannot improve diabetes and other CVD risk fac-
tors as well as RYGB. We also examined diabetic patients
with better initial glycaemic control, with an average baseline
HbA1c of 7.5±0.9% (58.5 mmol/mol), than have been studied
in prior relevant RCTs, where average baseline HbA1c
levels ranged from 7.9% (62.8 mmol/mol) to 9.6%
(81.4 mmol/mol), and all but one prior RCT started with an
average HbA1c >8.5% (69.4 mmol/mol) [16–22]. Although
the lower baseline glycaemia in our study cohort made it more
difficult a priori to demonstrate further glycaemic improve-
ments and differences between groups, we nevertheless found
that surgery outperformed ILMI on all diabetes-related vari-
ables, as have prior studies of patients with poorer initial
glycaemic control. Finally, there is still limited evidence from
RCTs examining surgical approaches to type 2 diabetes treat-
ment in patients with a BMI <35 kg/m2, the standard threshold
for bariatric surgery, and our study adds Level-1 data to that
evidence base.
Despite differences among trials, our study and related
RCTs consistently demonstrate various bariatric/metabolic
operations as superior to a variety of lifestyle/medical inter-
ventions to treat diabetes and obesity, including among pa-
tients with a BMI <35 kg/m2, for at least 1–3 years [16–22].
Our findings highlight how the results in trials of this nature
vary greatly depending upon the method of reporting diabetes
outcomes. Focusing on diabetes remission, we found a more
than tenfold increase in the RYGB compared with the ILMI
group (60.0% vs 5.9%, respectively, p=0.002), with a ~20-
fold higher adjusted odds ratio of achieving that endpoint
using surgery. These findings were identical whether we con-
centrated on ‘complete’ or ‘partial’ remission (i.e. HbA1c
<6.0% [42.1 mmol/mol] or <6.5% [47.5 mmol/mol], respec-
tively, off diabetes medications [27]), although results from
other studies vary widely depending on differences in these
thresholds [33]. In contrast to the large superiority of RYGB
over ILMI indicated by diabetes remission, examining
glycaemic control, which was relatively good at baseline in
both groups, yields a very different impression. Mean HbA1c
and fasting glucose values were statistically equivalent be-
tween groups throughout the study. These highly different
impressions are rendered because although glycaemic control
was similar between groups, ILMI patients achieved this using
more diabetes medications than did RYGB patients, and ab-
sence of such agents is required to define remission.
Important limitations of this trial include the modest dura-
tion of observation (although longer follow-up is underway),
its single-centre and necessarily unblinded nature (except for
randomisation and adjudication of outcomes) and relatively
small sample sizes. This study is insufficient to assess more
clinically relevant ‘hard’ outcomes such as microvascular and
macrovascular disease, as are all published RCTs comparing
surgical vs nonsurgical treatment of obesity and/or diabetes
[16–22]. However, we did observe greater improvements with
surgery compared with ILMI in body composition and impor-
tant CVD risk factors, including glycaemic control, systolic
blood pressure and HDL-cholesterol. Another limitation is
that although we sought to improve generalisability through
our SDM recruitment strategy, some characteristics of our
randomised cohort differed significantly from those who de-
clined participation in the trial, thereby limiting our study’s
generalisability (11).
Despite these limitations, our trial and other relevant RCTs
[16–22] demonstrate that commonly used bariatric/metabolic
operations (RYGB, sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric banding)
are all more effective than a variety of medical and/or lifestyle
interventions to promote weight loss, diabetes remission,
glycaemic control, and improvements in other CVD risk fac-
tors, with acceptable complications, for at least 1–3 years.
These results apply to patients with a BMI <35 kg/m2, and
our study and others show that neither baseline BMI nor the
amount of weight lost dependably predicts diabetes remission
after RYGB, which appears to ameliorate diabetes through
mechanisms beyond just weight reduction [4]. These findings
call into serious question the longstanding practice of using
strict BMI cutoffs as the primary criteria for surgical selection
among patients with type 2 diabetes [34].
