 Regional variation in mental health may result from preventable
environmental causes and inform public health interventions.
Many studies have been conducted comparing the rates of
psychiatric disorders between urban, and rural environments, with
inconsistent findings. Evidence for the more prevalent mood,
anxiety and substance use disorders, reviewed by Peen et al,1
indicates increased rates in residents of urban in comparison with
rural environments and a link between higher social problems and
environmental
stressors
in
cities
and
increased
psychiatric
morbidity has been hypothesised. The evidence for the effect of
urbanicity on other common mental health disorders, including
personality disorders, eating disorders and attention–deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is limited and inconclusive.2,3
However, no causal inferences can be based on studies of prevalent
cases examining urbanicity at the time of enrolment, because of
methodological
limitations; most importantly
the increased
mortality and emigration in people with a mental illness but also
the hypothesised drift towards cities of individuals with mental
illness.4 The most systematically examined psychiatric disorder
for the effect of urbanicity on incidence is schizophrenia, with
consistent evidence that urban environment is associated with
a higher risk for the disorder.5,6 Although not known, the
underlying cause(s) responsible for these differences have been
hypothesised to include toxic exposures, diet, infections, stress
or an artefact because of selective migration or treatment-seeking
behaviour. Although confounding may explain part of the effect,
as for example high rates of schizophrenia in cities can be
secondary to higher rates of substance misuse or ethnic minority
status in comparison with rural places, studies accounting for a
variety of confounders have confirmed the association.7 Only a
few studies have considered urban–rural differences in the
incidence of bipolar affective disorder,8–10 depression10,11 and
autism.12,13 It remains unknown whether urbanicity influences
the incidence of other mental disorders. Examining the effect of
urbanicity in a broad range of mental disorders would be useful
in order to explore similarities and differences of categorical
mental diagnoses as identified through the current classification
systems and to direct further research aiming to identify the
underlying causal effects of urbanicity (i.e. looking at aetiological
factors that have been associated specifically with psychosis or
with a broader risk for mental illness). Based on a large nation-
wide population, we aimed to investigate whether urban–rural
differences at place of birth influence the full spectrum of
mental disorders including, among others, substance misuse,
schizophrenia,
mood
disorders,
neurotic
and
stress-related
disorders, eating disorders, intellectual disability (ICD-10 ‘mental
retardation’), pervasive developmental disorders and hyperkinetic
disorder.
Method
Study population
The Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) was established in
1968, where all people living in Denmark were registered. Among
other variables, it includes information on personal identification
number, gender, date and place of birth, continuously updated
information on vital status and also the parent’s personal
identifiers. The personal identification number is used in all
national registers enabling accurate linkage between registers.
Our study population included all individuals born in Denmark
between January 1955 and 31 December 2006 and with both
parents also born in Denmark.
Assessment of mental illness
People within the study cohort and their parents and siblings were
linked via their personal identifier to the Danish Psychiatric
Central Research Register14 to obtain information about mental
illness. This register was computerised in 1969 and contains data
on all admissions to Danish psychiatric in-patient facilities and,
from 1995, information on out-patient visits to psychiatric

Background
People born in densely populated areas have a higher risk of
developing schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism.
Aims
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether urban–
rural differences in place of birth influence a broad range of
mental disorders.
Method
Population-based cohort study of everyone born in Denmark
between 1955 and 2006 (n = 2 894 640). Main outcome
measures were incidence rate ratios for five levels of
urbanisation and summary estimates contrasting birth in the
capital with birth in rural areas.
Results
For all psychiatric disorders, except intellectual disability
(ICD-10 ‘mental retardation’) and behavioural and emotional
disorders with onset in childhood, people born in the capital
had a higher incidence than people born in rural areas.
Conclusions
Birth in an urban environment is associated with an
increased risk for mental illness in general and for a broad
range of specific psychiatric disorders. Given this new
evidence that urban–rural differences in incidence are not
confined to the well-studied psychotic disorders, further work
is needed to identify the underlying aetiopathogenic
mechanisms.

 departments. From 1969 to 1993 the diagnostic system used
was the Danish modification of ICD-815 and from 1994 the
ICD-10.16 Cohort members were classified with a mental disorder
if they had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital or had received
out-patient care. The spectrum of mental disorders considered is
shown in Table 1. We examined the main categories of ICD-10
and the most common and characteristic disorders within these
categories. For each mental disorder, the date of onset was defined
as the first day of the first contact (in-patient or out-patient) with
the diagnosis of interest. Multiple disorders were recorded if
developed by the individual. Parents and siblings were classified
as having a history of mental disorder if they had been admitted
to a psychiatric hospital or had been in out-patient treatment
for any reason.
Assessment of urbanisation at birth
Municipalities in Denmark were classified according to degree of
urbanisation17 as follows: capital, capital suburb, provincial cities,
provincial towns or rural areas. Denmark is a small homogeneous
country with a population of 5.3 million people and a total area of
43 000 km2. The population densities for the capital, capital
suburb, provincial cities, provincial towns and rural areas,
respectively, are 5220, 845, 470, 180 and 55 people per km2.17
Distances are small in Denmark – most people live within
25 km of a city with more than 30 000 inhabitants and even closer
to a psychiatric hospital.
Study design and statistical analyses
For each psychiatric disorder, individuals were followed up from
the earliest age at which they may possibly develop the specific
disorder or 1 January 1995, whichever came last, until onset of
the outcome in question, death, emigration from Denmark or
31 December 2012, whichever came first. Note that since
individuals were followed from 1995 onwards only, those with
diagnoses prior to 1995 were excluded. The findings were
therefore based entirely on incident cases diagnosed according
to the more operational ICD-10 diagnostic classification system
and during a period when both in-patient and out-patient
information was used, except that the ICD-8 classification was
used to censor people with a diagnosis prior to 1995 and to
establish family history. Since many of the child psychiatric
disorders were only registered in out-patient settings, the study
cohort
for
the
child
psychiatric
disorders
included
only
individuals born in 1993 or later.
The incidence rate ratios (IRRs) associated with urbanicity at
birth for each mental disorder outcome were estimated by log
linear Poisson regression. All IRRs were adjusted for calendar
period, age and gender, as well as the interaction between age and
gender. Age and calendar period were treated as time-dependent
variables, whereas all other variables were treated as variables
independent of time. Potential confounders included maternal and
paternal age at time of child’s birth and history of mental illness
in a parent or sibling. P-values and 95% confidence intervals were
based on likelihood ratio tests. The adjusted-score test suggested
that the regression models were not subject to overdispersion.
In addition to the categorical model (IRR for five levels of
urbanisation) we used a continuous model that estimates trends
to summarise the risk associated with urbanicity at birth.
Specifically, the level of urbanisation was entered into the model
as a trend variable with scores proportional to the logarithm of
the relative population density (0 for rural areas, 0.26 for
provincial towns, 0.47 for provincial cities, 0.60 for capital
suburbs and 1 for the capital). Using this scoring, the estimated
relative risk corresponds to the risk of birth in the capital
compared with birth in the rural area using data from all degrees
of urbanisation. As a result of the many tests performed, in this
article we will denote estimates as statistically significant if the
P-value is 50.0025, using a Bonferroni correction for multiple
testing across the 20 psychiatric disorders we examined. This study
was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency.
Results
A total of 2 894 640 people born in Denmark 1955–2006 were
followed from 1995 to 2012, using the ICD-10 classification.

a. People born in Denmark 1955–2006 were followed for a mental disorder 1995–2012.
b. For psychiatric disorders the main categories of ICD-10 excluding dementia and organic disorders are shown; the indented entries are the most common and characteristic
disorders within that category.
 Urban–rural differences in incidence rates of psychiatric disorders
Overall, the cohort was followed for 45 325 531 person-years,
during which period 238 514 members of the cohort had their first
psychiatric contact with any psychiatric disorder. The list of
psychiatric disorders examined with corresponding ICD-10 codes
and the number of new cases during the follow-up period
according to degree of urbanisation are presented in Table 1.
Table 2 shows IRRs under the categorical model for each of the
psychiatric outcomes across the five categories of degrees of
urbanisation of place of birth in Denmark, compared with people
born in rural areas and summary estimates of the effect of birth in
the capital compared with birth in rural areas (trend estimate).
For all psychiatric disorders, except intellectual disability and
behavioural and emotional disorders with onset in childhood,
individuals born in the capital had a higher incidence rate than
those born in rural areas. There was evidence of a dose–
response association between the degree of urbanisation and the
IRR of the disorder in question.
Table 3 presents trend estimates for each psychiatric outcome
adjusting for potential confounders. Adjusting for parental age did
not substantially alter the trend estimates, whereas the inclusion of
family history of mental illness in the model resulted in a
reduction of trend estimates for most disorders. In the full model
and in the majority of specific categories of mental disorders
examined, the risk in individuals born in more urbanised areas
is significantly increased. From this point onwards we refer to
the fully adjusted estimates. For behavioural and emotional
disorders
with
onset
in
childhood,
including
hyperkinetic
disorder, the place of birth does not influence the risk of the
disorder and for intellectual disability we found a significant
reduction of the incidence in more urbanised areas (trend 0.86,
P50.0001).
Examination of the IRR of any psychiatric disorder for
individuals born in the capital compared with individuals born
in rural areas by age at diagnosis showed a high effect of
urbanicity in young children, a decline to minimal effect around
the ages of 5–10 (reflecting the lack of effect of urbanicity in
behavioural and emotional disorders with onset in childhood),
an increase during adolescence and a steady elevated IRR around
1.5 throughout adulthood.
Discussion
Main findings
In this study we found that birth in the capital or large cities was
associated with elevated risk for developing mental illness in
general. When the main categories of psychiatric diagnoses were
examined separately, this association applied to most disorders
with the exception of intellectual disability and emotional
disorders
with
onset
in
childhood,
including
hyperkinetic
disorder. For the remaining diagnostic categories the association
was highly significant with the IRRs of birth in the capital v. birth
in rural areas taking into account all levels of urbanicity (trend
estimates) ranging from 2.17 to 1.15.
Comparison with previous findings
The effect of urbanicity at birth on the incidence of any psychiatric
disorder (trend 1.29, 95% CI 1.27–1.30) was marginally higher
than the estimate of a recent meta-analysis of total prevalence rates
for
psychiatric
disorders
(pooled
adjusted
odds
ratio
(OR) = 1.21);1 although the two methods are not directly
comparable. When examining specific psychiatric outcomes,
the stronger effect of urban birth was found for pervasive
developmental
disorders,
schizophrenia
and
substance
use
disorders (trend 1.79, 1.68 and 1.57, respectively). It has been
suggested
that
the
urban–rural
differences
in
the
risk of
schizophrenia is not just an epiphenomenon of selective migration
or differential service utilisation.6,7 For example, Pedersen &
Mortensen showed that the more years lived in a high degree of

a. In the categorical model we present incidence rate ratios (IRR, with 95% confidence intervals) and in the continuous model a summary estimate measuring the IRR of birth in the
capital compared with birth in a rural area for each psychiatric disorder. All estimates were adjusted for calendar year, gender, age and its interaction with gender. The P-value for
the likelihood ratio tests that birth in the capital v. birth in the rural area influences the risk for the psychiatric disorder.
 Vassos et al
urbanisation the higher the risk of schizophrenia and, for fixed
urbanicity at 15th birthday, the IRR increased with increasing
degree of urbanisation at place of birth.18
Contrary to prevalence studies of urban–rural differences in
alcohol consumption or misuse,19 we found that urban birth
increases significantly the risk of developing alcohol-related
disorders (trend 1.58) and we noticed an even stronger effect for
cannabis use (trend 2.17). The latter could be partially explained
by the easier access, greater peer pressure and more tolerant
attitude towards substance use in people growing up in cities.20
The strong association with pervasive developmental disorders
is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of the prevalence of autism
spectrum disorders that showed an over twofold increase in typical
autism and autism spectrum disorders in studies conducted in
urban environments in comparison with studies in rural/mixed
environments.21 The variation in prevalence rates of pervasive
developmental disorders between studies is remarkable22 and the
recent increase in the incidence of these disorders may reflect a
broadening of the concept of pervasive developmental disorders
or improved detection and recognition of the disorder.23 Hence,
urban–rural differences in autism may partially reflect differences
in service availability, recognition rates and awareness of autism
spectrum disorders among both the lay public and professionals.
The effect of urban birth on the incidence of neurotic and
stress-related disorders, eating disorders and personality disorders
were similar (trend 1.41–1.53). These findings contrast with a
recent systematic review of the global prevalence of anxiety disorders
that found a higher rate of anxiety in rural populations.24 However,
this review presents comparisons of urban/rural prevalence rates
estimated from different studies; hence, these previous results
should be interpreted with caution.
Unlike most prevalence studies, which find a stronger effect
for mood disorders in comparison with anxiety disorders,1,25
our estimate of the effect of urbanicity on the incidence of mood
disorders was much lower (trend 1.16), but still significant.
Similar effect sizes were estimated for depression and bipolar
disorder (trend 1.15 and 1.17, respectively), underlining the
similarity of bipolar with other mood disorders. A recent
population-based cohort study found that the incidence of bipolar
disorder was not different in urban compared with non-urban
areas. However, this study was probably underpowered and the
crude IRR estimated from the data presented (1.14) was very
similar to our findings.9 This is much lower than the effect of
urbanicity on schizophrenia – possibly a point of difference
between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The effect of
urbanicity on schizoaffective disorder (trend 1.36) lies between
the two conditions.
One interesting finding was that urban birth appears to be
slightly protective for intellectual disability. This is similar to
studies that found higher prevalence of intellectual disability in
rural areas.26,27 Reasons suggested include inbreeding and selective
migration,withmorecompetentpeoplemovingtothecities.Evidence
from recent studies indicates that increased administrative prevalence
of autism (as measured using educational and other administrative
data) is accompanied by concurrent decline in the prevalence of
intellectual disability and other developmental disabilities.28 One
possibility that could account for some of the converse effect of urban
environment on intellectual disability (reduced incidence) and
pervasive developmental disorders (increased incidence) could be
differential diagnostic substitution29 between urban and rural areas.
The only other diagnostic category that did not show
increased incidence in urban environments was behavioural and

 Urban–rural differences in incidence rates of psychiatric disorders
emotional disorders with onset in childhood and hyperkinetic
disorder specifically, unlike a recent study from Germany that
found that the prevalence of ADHD increased with a higher
degree of urbanisation3 and a recent population-based study
from Taiwan that identified increased incidence of all neuro-
developmental
disorders
(intellectual
disability,
autism
and
ADHD) in urban environments.12 Despite some evidence of
aetiological and clinical overlap between autism and ADHD,30
our study suggests that risk factors associated with urbanicity
differentiate the two disorders.
The results of this study, with urbanicity acting as a common
risk factor for most mental disorders, can be interpreted in the
context of a continuum model for mental illness, not restricted
by current diagnostic boundaries, with psychiatric syndromes
having quantitative differences apart from qualitative differences
in causal mechanisms.10 This adds to previous evidence that the
risk of schizophrenia is associated with a family history of a wide
range of mental disorders, not confined to psychosis.31 Alongside
recent
molecular evidence of
shared genetic
aetiology
for
psychiatric disorders,32 our findings provide insights into the
shared causation of psychiatric disorders from an epidemiological
perspective. Therefore, we argue that discussions about the
validity of the Kraepelinian dichotomy and continuum models
that include only psychotic disorders are an oversimplification
of the full picture of mental illness.
Epidemiological studies measuring differences in incidence are
not equipped to examine specific aetiopathogenic mechanisms.
Urbanicity is a ‘proxy’ for underlying risk factors and a number
of potential causes have been proposed in the schizophrenia
literature. These include individual or area characteristics such
as differences in diet, exposure to infections, pollutants or toxins,
household crowding, obstetric complications, ethnic density,
deprivation and social fragmentation or reduced social cohesion.33
Evidence from a Danish sibling design suggests that whatever the
causes responsible for these urban–rural differences in schizo-
phrenia risk they are mainly operating at a family rather than
an individual level.34 However, we cannot extrapolate these
theories to the totality of mental illness and the new evidence that
urbanicity acts as a risk factor for most mental disorders indicates
the need to reconsider or broaden the search for causal factors.
It has been suggested that control over the internal housing
environment, quality of housing, presence of valued ‘escape
facilities’ (such as parks, public spaces, leisure and recreation),
crime and fear of crime, and social participation underlie the
interface between the urban and physical environment and mental
well-being.35 Type of dwelling, noise, pollution, crowding and
density, accessibility, exposure and access to nature have also been
associated with psychological symptoms36 and previous evidence
exists that improvement in the social environment is associated
with improved mental health of the population.37 All these
factors and other differences between rural and urban birth and
upbringing need to be considered as potential causes for the
differences in the incidence of mental disorders.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first study that investigates the effect of urban birth on
the incidence of the full spectrum of psychiatric disorders.
Strengths of the study include the large sample size that includes
the entire population of Denmark, with complete ascertainment
of the patients treated in psychiatric departments during the
follow-up period, and exposure to the risk factor before the illness
onset, which eliminates the possibility of selective migration. In
addition, the adjustment for potential confounders such as
parental age and family history reduces the possibility that the
observed differences in the incidence of mental disorders reflect
only differential exposure to other known risk factors. Since we
only include people born in Denmark with both parents also
born in Denmark, our findings are not influenced by foreign
immigration patterns.
A limitation of the study is that individuals with mental illness
were identified through the psychiatric case register, as opposed to
clinical examination with structured interviews. Although the use
of register-based diagnoses has several strengths, they may lack the
reliability that can be obtained by well-trained interviewers using
operationalised
diagnostic
interviews.38
Although
systematic
studies validating all clinical diagnoses presented in this study
do not exist, validation of some diagnoses (schizophrenia, single
depressive episode, affective disorder, dementia, autism) has been
carried out with good results.39,40 Furthermore, the use of the
psychiatric case register for the identification of family history
may provide more reliable confounder adjustment than using
family history information collected retrospectively usually by
examining patients and controls, a potential source for selection
and recall bias.
Another limitation is that the individuals with mental illness
included in our analyses were identified through in- or out-
patient treatment in psychiatric settings. Psychological problems
are among the most common reasons for presentation in primary
care in Denmark (9.3% of all encounters), with only a small
proportion (less than 5% across all diagnoses) being referred to
out-patient clinics or for hospital admission.41 We therefore
cannot draw conclusions about the effect of urbanicity at
birth on less severe disorders that do not require specialist
treatment. Since urbanicity is a ‘proxy’ for unknown risk
factors, epidemiological studies in developed, highly urbanised
countries, like Denmark alone, may not be sufficient to reveal
the mechanisms underlying the urban effect and the findings
cannot be generalised in low- and middle-income countries.
However, two recent studies from low-income countries42,43 offer
evidence that the association of urbanicity with mental illness is
not limited to high-income countries.
Although examination of urbanicity at birth and adjustment
for family history eliminates the possibility of selective migration
to urban centres of individuals or families after the development
of mental illness, there is still a possibility of selective migration
towards urban areas of families with traits or subtle symptoms
below the threshold for treatment by psychiatric services. In
addition, we cannot exclude the possibility of urban–rural
differences in service utilisation, as a proportion of people do
not change environment during their lives; hence, the place of
residence at diagnosis is correlated with the place of birth.
Implications
In conclusion, we found a dose–response association between the
degree of urbanisation at birth and the incidence of the full
spectrum of mental disorders. We confirmed previous associations
of urbanicity with risk for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
autism and expanded the findings to substance use, mood,
neurotic, eating and personality disorders. Potential explanations
include urban–rural differences in service utilisation, diet, stress,
lifestyle, family-level factors, infections, complications during
pregnancy, quality of housing, fear of crime and social parti-
cipation. The only disorder where birth in an urban environment
appeared to be protective was intellectual disability. Our findings
that urban birth increases the risk for most mental disorders,
combined with current evidence on their global burden to
individuals and society44 urge the research community to develop
testable hypotheses of risk factors underpinning the effect of
urbanicity on mental health. Replication of the findings in a
different population is crucial before definite conclusions can be
439
 Vassos et al
drawn. Furthermore, identification of specific factors that underlie
the association between early life exposure to urban environment
and mental illness would be relevant for public policies, including
public health and town planning policies.
