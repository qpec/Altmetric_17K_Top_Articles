Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the satiety effects of isocalorically replacing carbohydrate
energy in a meal with avocado-derived fats and fibers. In a randomized 3-arm, 6-h, crossover clinical
trial, thirty-one overweight/obese adults consumed a low-fat control meal (CON, 76% carbohydrate,
14% fat as energy, 5 g fiber, ~640 kcal) or high-fat meals similar in total fat and energy, but increasing
avocado-derived fat and fiber content from half (HA, 68 g; 51% carbohydrate, 40% fat as energy,
8.6 g fiber) or whole avocado (WA, 136 g; 50% carbohydrate, 43% fat as energy, 13.1 g fiber) on
three separate occasions. Visual analog scales (VAS) assessed subjective satiety over 6 h. Hormones
associated with satiety/appetite were measured in blood collected immediately after VAS. Stepwise
multiple regression analysis was used to assess the relationship of VAS with hormones in WA and
CON. Hunger suppression was enhanced after the WA compared to CON meal (p < 0.01). Subjects
indicated feeling more satisfied after both HA and WA than CON (p < 0.05). Fullness was greater
after CON and WA vs. HA (p < 0.005). PYY and GLP-1 were significantly elevated after WA vs.
CON (p < 0.05), while insulin was significantly higher after CON vs. WA (p < 0.0001). Ghrelin was
suppressed more by CON than WA (p < 0.05). Regression analysis indicated PYY was associated
with subjective satiety after WA, whereas increased insulin predicted changes in subjective satiety
after CON. Replacing carbohydrates in a high-carbohydrate meal with avocado-derived fat-fiber
combination increased feelings of satiety mediated primarily by PYY vs. insulin. These findings may
have important implications for addressing appetite management and metabolic concerns.

1. Introduction
The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically over the past few decades afflicting people
of all ages, races/ethnicities and both sexes [1–6]. Accordingly, obesity research efforts have focused on
identifying key factors contributing to obesity development and reduction. Processes of satiation and
satiety and their impact on food intake have been areas of research concentration. The macronutrient
profile of a meal, including fiber, influences satiation and satiety [7–11]; however, the optimal
composition to maximize satiety remains controversial.
Fats are considered less satiating than carbohydrate and protein; although in energy replacement
and energy density controlled paradigms this is not necessarily the case [12–14]. Characteristic
properties of fats, such as fatty acid chain length and saturation also have been studied, yielding

conflicting results on satiety outcomes [15]. Similarly, inconclusive results relative to fibers’ properties
on satiety have been reported [16]. Studying nutrient components out of their natural matrix may be
one factor that influences satiety results, but population characteristics is an important consideration.
Satiety research on fats or fibers has been conducted primarily in healthy weight adults [8,15,16]
limiting extrapolation to effects in overweight and obese individuals that may experience greater
benefit from certain dietary manipulations [8].
Fats and some fibers slow gastric emptying, delay nutrient absorption, modulate glucose and
insulin responses, and alter gut hormones involved in satiety [7,17–19]. Fats are potent stimulators
of certain satiety peptides, including cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like
peptide (GLP)-1 [20–23]. Delaying absorption of fat with fibers could result in increased release of
these peptides and enhance satiety, due to similarities in their physiological effects. Previous work
suggests that under energy equivalent conditions, increasing the fat content of a meal or incorporating
foods inherently containing fiber into a low-fat meal can enhance satiety over an extended post-meal
time period, an effect related to the CCK response post-meal [24]. Few studies have focused on the role
of nutrient combinations (particularly fat and fiber) to enhance satiety.
Avocados are a unique fruit that contains both fats and dietary fibers. One medium size, fresh
Hass avocado (~136 g) is about 72% water and contains ~13.3 g monounsaturated fats, 10 g fiber, and a
variety of carotenoids and other bioactive components [25]. Wien and colleagues (2013) reported that
adding approximately half an avocado to a lunch meal suppressed the desire to eat and increased how
satisfied participants felt over 5 h compared to a meal without avocado [26]. However, adding avocado
increased the energy content of the meal. In the same study, postprandial insulin concentrations were
reduced after replacing some fat and carbohydrate energy (salad dressing and cookie portions) with
avocado [26]. These data suggest that strategic manipulation of meals with avocado, a source of fat and
fiber, could promote both satiety and metabolic benefits. Achieving both benefits without increasing
energy would be ideal, particularly for individuals with weight or glucose control concerns.
Therefore, the present study examined the satiety effects of replacing carbohydrate energy in a
meal with a half or a whole avocado compared to a control meal without avocado in overweight/obese
individuals. The primary research outcome was the change in subjective measures of satiety in response
to meals over 6 h. Secondary outcomes were changes in variables such as tiredness and alertness,
and characterization of the association between satiety/appetite related hormones (PYY, GLP-1, ghrelin
and insulin) and subjective satiety after the whole avocado vs. control meals. The working hypothesis
is that under energy equivalent conditions, replacing carbohydrate with fat-fiber combination from
avocados will enhance satiety and the effects will be related to the meal responsive changes in
satiety-mediating hormones.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethics and Study Design
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Illinois Institute of Technology
(IIT) in Chicago, IL and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02479048). The study was conducted
according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference
on Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). All subjects provided written informed consent.
This study was part of a larger study examining the effects of avocado on metabolic endpoints, vascular
reactivity and lipoprotein metabolism [27]. The study was a randomized, three-arm, single-blinded,
acute, crossover design conducted from 2015–2016 at the Clinical Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) at
the Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech, Chicago, IL, USA).
2.2. Subjects
Thirty-nine subjects (21 men and 18 women) were enrolled and randomized in the study; 31 subjects
(15 men and 16 women) completed all protocol specified procedures (Figure 1) [27]. Eligible subjects

were men and women 20–65 years of age and BMI between 25 and 35 kg/m2 with elevated fasting
glucose (5.0–6.4 mmol/L) and insulin (no greater than 90.3 pmol/L) concentrations. Participants also had
to be nonsmokers and be in relatively good health with no previous history or current clinical evidence
of cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal or hepatic diseases. Individuals taking
medications or dietary supplements that would interfere with study outcomes, anyone reporting
allergies or sensitivity to study products, and women who were pregnant or lactating were excluded.
Female participants were studied during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Each subject was
studied once.

2.3. Study Meals and Intervention 
There were three breakfast test meals: one was a low fat, high carbohydrate meal (control meal, 
CON) and two meals were similar in energy and energy density to CON but contained either a half 
(HA) or a whole (WA) of a fresh, medium-sized Hass avocado (Supplement Table S1). Meals 
consisted of a bagel sandwich (with or without avocado), fresh honeydew melon, oatmeal, and a 
lemonade-flavored drink. Nutrient and energy content for each meal appear in Table 1. Avocado-
derived fat and fiber increased with increasing avocado content in the meal, with WA containing > 
2/3 avocado-derived fat and fiber. HA was supplemented with butter fat to adjust total fat content 
between the two experimental (avocado) meals. Bagel sandwiches were used for manipulating 
components by adding avocado into hollowed bagels and using cream cheese and butter to manage

and 19.9 (65%), respectively.
2.4. Assessments: Visual Analog Scale (V
AS)
The VAS tool measured subjective satiety [28] and other variables at baseline and at seven
time-specific intervals post meal [24]. The VAS questions included assessment of subjective feelings of
fullness, hunger, desire to eat, prospective consumption, and how satisfied subjects felt at the moment
of VAS collection. Other variables, including thirstiness, feelings of nausea, tiredness, and alertness
also were assessed. Subjects were instructed to read each question carefully every time and indicate
how they felt at the exact moment by drawing a straight vertical line on a 100 mm horizontal line scale
anchored with “not at all” to “extremely.”
2.5. Assessments: Blood Collection and Analysis
Whole blood samples were collected into a 4 mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated
vacutainer tubes, inverted gently and immediately placed on ice. Within 30 min of collection, all blood
samples were centrifuged at 453× g for 15 min at 4 ◦C. Plasma aliquots then were collected and
stored at –80 ◦C until analysis. Prior to centrifugation, the following were added: 230 µL of aprotinin
(Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA) and 40 µL of dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor (EMD Millipore,
Temecula, CA, USA) for GLP-17-36 and PYY3-36 and 30 µL of 4-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid for ghrelin.
Glucose and insulin were analyzed using Randox Daytona Auto Clinical Analyzer (Randox, Antrim,
UK) by enzyme-based assay kits (cat. no. GL3815, Randox, Antrim, UK) and immunoturbidimetry
assay (cat. no. KAI071, Kamiya Biomedicals, Tukwila, WA, USA) respectively. Enzyme-linked
immunoassay kits (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Burlingame, CA, USA) were used to analyze
total ghrelin, GLP-17-36, and PYY3-36. Quality controls suggested by the manufacturers were used in
all assays.
2.6. Summary of Study Procedures
Study procedures are described in detail elsewhere [27]. Briefly, subjects were asked to follow a
strictly limited avocado, olive oil, nuts and polyphenolic diet for at least three days prior to the study

day and throughout the study duration, while maintaining their usual eating and physical activity
patterns. In addition, subjects were asked to restrict intake of alcohol, coffee, tea, and other caffeinated
beverages and limit their physical activity 24 h prior to a testing day.
Subjects were asked to consume a standardized dinner meal on the night before each study day to
control variance from prior food and beverage intake. Subjects arrived at the research center in a fasted
state (8–12 h fasting), well-hydrated and well-rested (+/− 1 h usual sleep pattern). Vigorous exercise,
alcohol and caffeine intake were restricted 24 h prior to the visit. After reviewing subjects’ compliance
and study readiness, participants completed their first set of VAS subjective satiety questions followed
by placement of an intravenous catheter inserted into their antecubital vein for a fasting/baseline blood
sample (0 h). Participants then were given one of the three test meals based on their assigned computer
generated randomization sequence. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h after the breakfast meal, VAS again
were administered. Immediately after VAS completion, blood samples were collected via the catheter.
The study day visit procedures are shown in Figure 2. Each study visit occurred at least one week
apart (7–10 days).

2.7. Statistical Analysis 
Demographic characteristics of study participants were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 
Subjective data from VAS and biological samples were analyzed by mixed-model analysis of repeated 
measures using PROC MIXED [29]. All models included meal, time and meal- by-time interaction as 
main factors with subject as the blocking variable. VAS data were normalized to subject’s own 
baseline, which also corrected for baseline variance. Biological sample data were analyzed using all 
values with baseline values as a covariate and are presented as mean ± standard error (SE) scores 
over time using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) generated least square means ± SE of the 
response. Area under the 6 h response curves using the trapezoidal method after controlling for 
baseline (iAUC) also were calculated for biological sample data. Data not conforming to expected 
distributional assumptions were log-transformed. For non-normally distributed data, such as ghrelin 
iAUC, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed in SAS.  
Hormone data are presented as time by concentration curves. Stepwise multiple regression 
analysis was performed using SPSS [30] to investigate the association of gut hormones and insulin 
and subjective satiety responses using only CON and WA data for each gut peptide, insulin, and VAS 
change from baseline. The probability of F-to-enter is 0.05, probability of F-to-remove is 0.10. A two-
tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Power calculations based on paired t-test indicated 
that a sample size of thirty subjects would provide >80% power to detect differences of 25% or greater 
with SD of 18 in VAS or gut hormone variables between avocado-containing meals and CON meal.

3.2. Subjective Satiety
All meals significantly suppressed hunger, desire to eat and prospective consumption and
increased fullness and satisfaction (time effect p < 0.05 for all) (Figure 3a–e). Meal-specific effects
were apparent for changes in hunger, fullness and how satisfied subjects felt over 6 h (p < 0.05) and
marginally for prospective consumption (p = 0.11). In general, hunger was significantly suppressed
over time by WA compared to CON (Figure 3a), whereas changes in ratings of fullness were not
different between WA and CON but were different from HA (Figure 3b). Changes in desire to eat
were not different among meals (Figure 3c). Meal related changes in how much subjects wanted to eat
(prospective consumption) over 6 h suggested greater suppression with increasing amounts of avocado
in the meals (p = 0.11, Figure 3d). How satisfied subjects felt were enhanced after both avocado meals
compared to CON (Figure 3e, p < 0.0005 for both). Mean scores for thirst, nausea, and alertness did not
differ among meals, whereas participants reported being less tired (p < 0.05) after WA (29.7 ± 2.4) than
from HA (33.7 ± 2.3).

3.3. Gut Peptide and Insulin Responses 
Total ghrelin was significantly suppressed starting at 1 h after the CON and WA meal reaching 
a nadir at 2 h and returning to baseline at 6 h (Figure 4a). Between meal analysis indicated that CON 
produced a significantly greater suppression of total ghrelin compared to WA (meal effect, p < 0.05; 
meal × time interaction, p < 0.05), which was supported by the iAUC analysis indicating a 35% greater 
suppression of total ghrelin after the CON vs. WA meal (p = 0.01, Table 3). GLP-1 increased 
significantly from baseline after both CON and WA meals (p < 0.05) and returned to baseline by 4 h 
(Figure 4b); however, the pattern of response differed, in that, GLP-1 reached peak concentrations at 
~30 min after WA and at ~1 h after CON. Incremental AUC indicated WA induced ~77% greater 
exposure to GLP-1 compared to CON over 6 h. Consistent with the GLP-1 response pattern, PYY was 
significantly elevated after WA meal compared to CON (~2.5-fold concentrations, p < 0.001). Further, 
PYY peaked ~30 min earlier after WA meal vs. CON followed by a slower rate of clearance (Figure 
4c). Insulin concentrations after all meals were reported previously [27]. Briefly, insulin increased 
after all meals and returned to baseline by 4 h post-meal; however, insulin concentrations were 
significantly reduced after the avocado-containing meals compared to CON. Insulin iAUC after the 
WA meal was reduced by 31% compared to the CON meal (p < 0.0001, Table 3).

nadir at 2 h and returning to baseline at 6 h (Figure 4a). Between meal analysis indicated that CON
produced a significantly greater suppression of total ghrelin compared to WA (meal effect, p < 0.05;
meal × time interaction, p < 0.05), which was supported by the iAUC analysis indicating a 35% greater
suppression of total ghrelin after the CON vs. WA meal (p = 0.01, Table 3). GLP-1 increased significantly
from baseline after both CON and WA meals (p < 0.05) and returned to baseline by 4 h (Figure 4b);
however, the pattern of response differed, in that, GLP-1 reached peak concentrations at ~30 min
after WA and at ~1 h after CON. Incremental AUC indicated WA induced ~77% greater exposure to
GLP-1 compared to CON over 6 h. Consistent with the GLP-1 response pattern, PYY was significantly
elevated after WA meal compared to CON (~2.5-fold concentrations, p < 0.001). Further, PYY peaked
~30 min earlier after WA meal vs. CON followed by a slower rate of clearance (Figure 4c). Insulin
concentrations after all meals were reported previously [27]. Briefly, insulin increased after all meals
and returned to baseline by 4 h post-meal; however, insulin concentrations were significantly reduced
after the avocado-containing meals compared to CON. Insulin iAUC after the WA meal was reduced
by 31% compared to the CON meal (p < 0.0001, Table 3).

3.4. Relationship of Hormones and Subjective Satiety
All hormones played a role in the subjective satiety responses to meals (Table 4); however,
the strength of the relationship depended on which meal was ingested (CON or WA) and the variable
investigated. Overall, PYY predicted 20–30% of the changes in hunger, fullness, desire to eat and
prospective consumption after WA, but only 3–5% of the variance in satiety response after the CON
meal. In contrast, insulin predicted subjective satiety responses after CON ranging from 23–32%
depending on the subjective satiety variable, whereas insulin was not significant in the regression
models with WA. GLP-1 explained much of the fullness response for CON. Ghrelin had a relatively
minor role in subjective responses for WA.

4. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to investigate the satiety effects of avocados, a unique food source
containing both fats and fibers, in an isocaloric replacement paradigm, substituting carbohydrate
energy in a low-fat, high carbohydrate (Control, CON) meal with half or whole avocado. The potential
impact of the fat-fiber combination derived partly or predominantly from avocados, independent of fat
content, was assessed by adjusting total fat in the avocado meals. Study results indicated that replacing
carbohydrate with fats and fibers derived from avocados without increasing energy or energy-density
enhanced the satiety value of meals in overweight and obese individuals as evidenced by greater
hunger suppression after WA compared to CON (WA > CON = HA) and increased feelings of how
satisfied subjects felt over 6 h (WA = HA > CON). Satiety induced by WA was associated mostly
with PYY responses. In contrast, satiety induced by CON was related mostly to insulin responses.
These findings suggest isocaloric dietary manipulation with a whole avocado promotes favorable
metabolic responses in addition to enhancing satiety and reducing motivation to eat.
Optimal meal composition to maximize satiety remains controversial. In general, protein is
considered to be the most satiating followed by carbohydrate and then fat [31]. Importantly however
is whether energy and volume is controlled in study designs comparing macronutrients and satiety.
Fat has a clear disadvantage because it has twice the energy density of other macronutrients. Early
evidence suggests that when palatability and energy density is held constant, subjective satiety,
and energy intake as a measure of satiating effect was not different between carbohydrate and fat
preloads [13,32,33]. This has been observed when foods were ingested orally or infused intravenously or
intragastrically [12]. Likewise, texture, and other sensory cues must be considered when investigating
satiety effects of macronutrients. In the present study, energy, energy density, palatability, and various
sensory factors (including visual appeal) were matched closely. All meals looked and had texturally
similar components. All meals were well liked (pleasantness mean score >60 for all meals and not
significantly different) and all suppressed hunger and induced satiety. However, compared to CON,
the WA meal produced a significantly greater reduction in hunger and increase in how satisfied
participants felt after the WA meal compared to CON. Subjects also reported feeling more satisfied after
the HA meal compared to the CON, while other subjective satiety responses were not significantly
suppressed/enhanced by HA. The HA meal had similar total fat content to the WA meal, but less
avocado-derived fat and fiber than WA meal. These data suggest that having a higher level of fat in the
meal is associated with subjects feeling more satisfied, whereas increasing both the avocado-derived
fat and fiber combination offers additional satiety-inducing benefits influencing several subjective
variables. Whether it is the fat component or the fiber component driving the effect is the subject for
subsequent research. Findings from this study suggest that replacing carbohydrate energy with fat
energy in combination with a source of inherent (rather than added) fiber, as demonstrated here with
avocados, can increase the satiety value of a meal compared to a low-fat high-carbohydrate meal.
The control of food intake, satiety and appetite involves complex processing of non-homeostatic
and homeostatic factors, the latter including physiological status and the dynamics of fuel metabolism
and episodic gut hormones in response to food intake. Flint et al. reported that insulin concentrations
were inversely correlated with feelings of hunger, whereas glucose concentrations were not related to
hunger or satiety [34]. In this current study, feelings of hunger were significantly suppressed with the
WA meal, yet insulin was also markedly reduced [27]. GLP-1 and PYY are anorexigenic hormones and
produce feelings of satiety and inhibit food intake [35,36]. Fat is a potent stimulator of GLP-1 and PYY,
explaining their significant elevation after WA meal compared to CON meal. PYY was identified as the
primary contributor to the satiety response of WA, with GLP-1 and ghrelin contributing only modestly.
In contrast, ghrelin suppression was greater after CON compared to the WA meal, consistent with
carbohydrate being more potent than fat or protein to suppress ghrelin [37,38]. However, analysis
did not reveal ghrelin as playing a significant role in hunger or other subjective satiety responses to
CON. Instead, insulin was consistently identified as explaining much of CON meal-associated satiety
variance, except in the case of fullness, in which GLP-1 contributed 32% and insulin added an extra 8%.

These findings suggest that how satiety is achieved through biological signaling may have important
implications. Achieving satiety through sufficient release of pre-absorptive satiety peptides may be
ideal versus exaggerated insulin responses to meals.
Insulin is a master hormone in fuel trafficking and metabolism and has varied roles centrally,
including food intake regulation. A dietary pattern that is associated with elevated insulin has been
identified with increasing risk of hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance [39–41],
particularly in an overweight/obese population. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in the periphery
can produce hypoinsulinemia and/or modified/dampened insulin signaling in the brain [42–44]. Individuals
in the current study were overweight or obese and had elevated fasting insulin concentrations with
insulin resistance [27]. Findings suggest that replacement strategies for carbohydrate with avocado fats
and fibers reduced the post meal insulin demand, increased satiety gut hormone concentrations and
improved the subjective profile of satiety. Whether the effects are due to improved insulin sensitivity
peripherally or centrally to augment satiety signaling cannot be determined in the present research, but
provides the basis for follow up mechanistic work in appropriate models. From a practical standpoint,
the population studied represents a typical cohort of middle-aged people at risk for cardio-metabolic
disease—a point when realistic dietary changes can make a significant impact on reversing the disease
risk trajectory.
This study has strengths and limitations. An important strength was the application to real life.
Isocaloric replacement of carbohydrate for fat is not easy yet may have advantages for appetite and
post-meal metabolic control. Strategic manipulation of menu items maintaining consistent energy
density and sensory variables was achieved using readily available foods in grocery stores. Avocados
provided healthy fat and fibers, adding to the simplicity of the macronutrient exchanges. One study
limitation was the lack of a test meal to measure subsequent food/energy intake 6 h after meals
as the meal-related time course of subjective satiety (particularly later in the postprandial period)
suggested an effect on subsequent meal intake may have been plausible. Not separating the specific
fat type and fiber effect also may be a limitation. Finally, gut hormones were not measured after HA.
This information may have provided insight on the observed differences in fullness ratings between
HA meal and CON and WA meals.
5. Conclusions
The increasing rates of obesity over the last several decades with limited success in reversing trends
has intensified research to gain a better understanding of how foods and ingredients impact appetite
and satiety, energy intake, and body weight management. For years, fat has been targeted as one of the
main causes of obesity, in part due to behaviors associated with passive over-consumption. However,
carbohydrates have now come under scrutiny in association with obesity. It is timely to re-examine the
issue of specific macronutrients in the context of their interactions in the diet and understanding how
satiety and food intake control is achieved in different populations. The implications of metabolically
healthy responses as well as managing subjective appetite warrant further research with avocados and
other fat-fiber combinations, particularly in overweight and obese populations with metabolic concerns.
