IMPORTANCE The World Trade Center (WTC) attacks on September 11, 2001, created an
unprecedented environmental exposure to known and suspected carcinogens suggested to
increase the risk of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by the
precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and
light-chain MGUS, detectable in peripheral blood.
OBJECTIVE To characterize WTC-exposed firefighters with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma
and to conduct a screening study for MGUS and light-chain MGUS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case series of multiple myeloma in firefighters
diagnosed between September 11, 2001, and July 1, 2017, together with a seroprevalence
study of MGUS in serum samples collected from Fire Department of the City of New York
(FDNY) firefighters between December 2013 and October 2015. Participants included all
WTC-exposed FDNY white, male firefighters with a confirmed physician diagnosis of multiple
myeloma (n = 16) and WTC-exposed FDNY white male firefighters older than 50 years with
available serum samples (n = 781).
EXPOSURES WTC exposure defined as rescue and/or recovery work at the WTC site between
September 11, 2001, and July 25, 2002.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Multiple myeloma case information, and age-adjusted and
age-specific prevalence rates for overall MGUS (ie, MGUS and light-chain MGUS), MGUS, and
light-chain MGUS.
RESULTS Sixteen WTC-exposed white male firefighters received a diagnosis of multiple
myeloma after September 11, 2001; median age at diagnosis was 57 years (interquartile range,
50-68 years). Serum/urine monoclonal protein isotype/free light-chain data were available
for 14 cases; 7 (50%) had light-chain multiple myeloma. In a subset of 7 patients, myeloma
cells were assessed for CD20 expression; 5 (71%) were CD20 positive. In the screening study,
we assayed peripheral blood from 781 WTC-exposed firefighters. The age-standardized
prevalence rate of MGUS and light-chain MGUS combined was 7.63 per 100 persons (95% CI,
5.45-9.81), 1.8-fold higher than rates from the Olmsted County, Minnesota, white male
reference population (relative rate, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.34-2.29). The age-standardized prevalence
rate of light-chain MGUS was more than 3-fold higher than in the same reference population
(relative rate, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.99-4.93).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Environmental exposure to the WTC disaster site is
associated with myeloma precursor disease (MGUS and light-chain MGUS) and may be a risk
factor for the development of multiple myeloma at an earlier age, particularly the light-chain
subtype.

ultiple myeloma is a clonal neoplasm of differenti-
ated B cells (plasma cells). It is one of the most com-
mon hematologic malignant neoplasms among
adults, affecting approximately 100 000 persons currently liv-
ing with the disease in the United States, and has an age-
adjusted incidence rate of 6.53 per 100 000 per year.1-3 Mul-
tiplemyelomaismostfrequentlydiagnosedamongpeopleaged
65 to 74 years; only approximately 5% of cases are diagnosed
before50years.2Inthegeneralpopulation,approximately80%
of patients with multiple myeloma have expression of IgH (re-
ferred to as “monoclonal-(M)-protein”) and 20% have abnor-
mal light-chain proteins detectable in peripheral blood.4 Evi-
dence from a large, prospective, population-based cancer
screening trial shows that IgH-secreting and light-chain–
secreting multiple myeloma are consistently preceded by their
respective precursor states, monoclonal gammopathy of un-
determined significance (MGUS) and light-chain MGUS, which
can be detected in peripheral blood.5
Although the cause of multiple myeloma and its precur-
sor conditions (MGUS and light-chain MGUS) remains largely
unclear, previous studies have reported an increased risk
among individuals exposed to known and suspected carcino-
gens including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dioxins, poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and asbestos.6-8 The at-
tacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) on September 11, 2001
(9/11), created an unprecedented environmental exposure to
aerosolized dust and gases that contained known carcino-
gens including PCBs and PAHs.9 These substances were pro-
duced by the collapsed and burning buildings and by the die-
sel smoke emitted from heavy equipment used during the
10-month rescue and recovery effort. Recent cohort studies of
first responders, construction workers, and volunteers at the
WTC site provided evidence linking exposure to the WTC aero-
solized dust and gases with multiple myeloma and other ma-
lignant neoplasms. In 2009, a case series (N = 8) suggested an
excess of early-onset of multiple myeloma among WTC-
exposed first responders in the General Responder Cohort; 4
oftheindividualswere45yearsoryoungeratdiagnosis.10Since
2011, studies have examined the post-9/11 incidence of mul-
tiple myeloma, and other cancers, in 3 WTC-exposed cohorts
compared with the general population. A study of 55 778 New
York state residents enrolled in the WTC Health Registry (in-
cludingrescueworkers,recoveryworkers,andthosewholived
or worked near the WTC) reported a nearly 3-fold (standard-
ized incidence ratio [SIR], 2.85; 95% CI, 1.15-5.88) higher risk
of multiple myeloma, based on 7 cases.11 However, a fol-
low-up study focusing on 10-year cancer incidence patterns
in the same population observed a nonsignificant 1.4-fold (SIR,
1.35; 95% CI, 0.70-2.36) increased risk of multiple myeloma.12
Similarstudiesamong8927FireDepartmentoftheCityofNew
York (FDNY) WTC-exposed firefighters reported an SIR of 1.49
(95% CI, 0.56-3.97)13 while another among 20 984 non-FDNY
responders from the General Responder Cohort reported an
SIR of 1.41 (95% CI, 0.64-2.67).14
Toimproveourunderstandingofthisassociation,weiden-
tified and characterized all WTC-exposed white, male fire-
fighters from FDNY who received a diagnosis of multiple my-
eloma from September 12, 2001, to July 1, 2017. Second, we
conducted a screening study for myeloma precursor disease
among the FDNY subset of 781 white male WTC-exposed fire-
fighters older than 50 years. The aim of our screening study
was to define the age-specific prevalence of MGUS and light-
chain MGUS in WTC-exposed New York City male firefighters
and to compare the FDNY prevalence with that in the male
Olmsted County, Minnesota, population. We also assessed pat-
terns of myeloma precursor disease in relation to our expo-
sure metric (time of initial arrival at the WTC site) to test for a
possible exposure-response association.
Methods
The case series and screening studies were approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of Montefiore Medical Center and
Albert Einstein College of Medicine. All participants
provided written consent to research.
Multiple Myeloma Case Series
Population and Case Information
Through the WTC Health Program, FDNY WTC-exposed fire-
fighters (N = 12 942) receive comprehensive physical and men-
tal health services. All white, male firefighters with a post-
9/11 diagnosis of multiple myeloma (n = 16) in the FDNY WTC
Health Program as of July 1, 2017, were included in the case
series population (Figure 1A). The cases were confirmed in 2
ways: (1) via state tumor registry matches with New York, New
Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Arizona, and Virginia. A total of 8622 of 8830
(98%) retired FDNY firefighters in this cohort currently re-
side in these states. All active FDNY firefighters are required
to live in New York City or neighboring New York state coun-
ties of Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Nassau, or Suffolk; (2)
via FDNY WTC Health Program medical assessments/records
reviewed by an experienced clinician (N.J.).13 Using medical
records from the time of diagnosis, we extracted information
on age at diagnosis, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy re-
ports,andserumandurineproteintesting.Weperformedcom-
plete case analysis when outcome data were missing.
Key Points
Question Are environmental exposures from the World Trade
Center disaster site associated with multiple myeloma and its
precursor disease, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance (MGUS), in New York City firefighters?
Findings In this case series, 16 participants were diagnosed with
multiple myeloma after September 11, 2001, with a median age of
disease onset of 57 years, and in subsets with relevant data, a high
proportion of the cases had light-chain myeloma, and plasma cells
were CD20 positive. In the screening study, World Trade Center
exposure was found to be statistically significantly associated with
light-chain MGUS and overall MGUS.
Meaning World Trade Center disaster exposures are associated
with myeloma precursor disease (MGUS) and may be a risk factor
for the development of multiple myeloma at an earlier age.

 FDNY MGUS Screening Study
Population
The FDNY WTC Health Program provides regular monitoring
examinations approximately every 12 to 18 months. From
December 2013 through October 2015, serum samples were
collected from 1173 WTC-exposed firefighters during routine
monitoring examinations (Figure 1b). If a firefighter had
more than 1 monitoring examination during the study
period, serum was collected from the first examination. To
facilitate comparison with our multiple myeloma results and
our external comparison group, we restricted the analysis to
white men. We excluded specimens from 5 who had
received a diagnosis of myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma
prior to blood sampling. We also excluded participants
younger than 50 or older than 79 years at the time of blood
sampling. The final study cohort included 781 white, male,
WTC-exposed firefighters (Table). All serum samples were
analyzed for MGUS or light-chain MGUS in 2016.
Demographic data including age at blood sample collec-
tion, race, and sex were obtained from the FDNY employee da-
tabase. Additionally, data from the first self-administered
health questionnaire, which began in October 2001, were used
tocategorizelevelofWTCexposurebasedoninitialarrivaltime
(arriving the morning of 9/11 [most highly exposed]; arriving
the afternoon of 9/11; arriving September 12, 2001; arriving be-
tween September 13 and 24, 2001; and arriving between Sep-
tember 25, 2001, and July 24, 2002 [least exposed], when the
WTCsiteclosed)anddurationattheWTCsite(monthsinwhich
a participant worked at least 1 day at the WTC site).
Serum Specimen and Laboratory Methods
We obtained a 0.5-mL aliquot for each study participant who
consented to the FDNY research protocol. Each aliquot tube
was labeled only with the participant’
s coded identification
number. All specimens were shipped on dry ice to the Protein
Laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where
protein assays were performed. The samples were tested con-
currently and results were assessed by 2 of us (O.L. and K.M.)
in a blinded fashion.5,15-17
Comparison Population: Olmsted County, Minnesota
We used published data from the population-based Olmsted
County, Minnesota, study, the only available screening study
including both MGUS and light-chain MGUS assays,18 as our
comparison population. The racial distribution of the popu-
lation in Olmsted County is predominantly white.19 We fo-
cused on the Olmsted County MGUS and light-chain MGUS
ratesinmen50to79yearsold(N = 7612).Amongthe7612men,
the prevalence of overall MGUS (ie, MGUS and light-chain
MGUS), MGUS, and light-chain MGUS was 4.4% (n = 333), 3.4%
(n = 258), and 1.0% (n = 75), respectively.18

 Statistical Analysis
The crude age-specific prevalence rates were calculated for
white men as the total number of cases within each age stra-
tum divided by the total number of individuals within that
age stratum. Prevalence rates for overall MGUS, MGUS, and
light-chain MGUS were calculated for the FDNY study popu-
lation. Additionally, to enable external comparison, preva-
lence rates were age standardized to the US 2000 male
population, ages 50 to 79 years. Age-adjusted 95% confi-
dence intervals were calculated for directly standardized
relative rates (RRs) using the modified γ approximation
method, which assumes a Poisson distribution. Standard
errors for 95% Mantel-Haenszel confidence limits of stan-
dardized relative risks were calculated using the Greenland
and Robins20 variance formula. Participants older than 79
years were excluded from this analysis due to small numbers
in the firefighting cohort. Exposure to the WTC, using time
of arrival at the WTC site as a proxy for intensity, was evalu-
ated separately in a stratified analysis. All analyses were per-
formed using SAS, version 9.4, and R v.3.2.0.
Results
Multiple Myeloma Case Series
We identified 16 white male responders from the FDNY fire-
fighter cohort with a post-9/11 diagnosis of multiple my-
eloma. The median age at diagnosis was 57 years (range, 38-76
years). The median time between 9/11 and diagnosis was 12.0
years (range, 1.0-15.7 years). The myeloma cell infiltration of
the bone marrow ranged between less than 10% and 90%
across individuals; immunophenotypic characterization of the
bone marrow sample revealed CD20-positive plasma cells in
5 of 7 (71%; 95% CI, 36%-92%) tested cases. Results on serum
and/or urine monoclonal proteins isotype and free light chains
wereavailablefor14cases;7(50%;95%CI,27%-73%)hadlight-
chain multiple myeloma. Individual-level data for the case se-
ries, including plasma-cell percentage, serum and/or urine
monoclonal protein isotype and free light chains, and plasma-
cell CD20 expression are provided in eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment.
MGUS Screening Study Demographic Characteristics
TheTableprovidesselecteddemographiccharacteristicsofthe
FDNYfirefightercohortandOlmstedCountycomparisonpopu-
lation. The median age at time of FDNY specimen collection
was 57 years (interquartile range, 54-62 years). The majority
of firefighters arrived at the WTC site on the day of the at-
tacks (535 [68.5%]) and spent a mean (SD) 3.17 (2.68) months
working at the WTC site. The Olmsted County cohort was as-
sumed to have no WTC exposure. The median age of firefight-
ers with MGUS was nonsignificantly younger than that among
the reference population: 62 years (FDNY firefighter cohort)
vs 70 years (Olmsted County comparison population). Simi-
larly, firefighters with light-chain MGUS were nonsignifi-
cantly younger than the reference population (median age, 61
vs 68 years). Specific characteristics of MGUS are found in
eTable 2 in the Supplement.
MGUS and Light-Chain MGUS Age-Standardized and
Relative Rates
Among white men aged 50 to 79 years, the age-standardized
prevalence rate (ASR) of overall MGUS among WTC-exposed
FDNY firefighters was 7.63 per 100 persons (95% CI, 5.45-
9.81), which was 1.8-fold significantly higher compared with
the rate among those from Olmsted County, Minnesota
(ASR, 4.34 per 100 persons; 95% CI, 3.88-4.81 per 100 per-
sons and RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.34-2.29) (Figure 2A). Figure 2B
shows that, among the same population, the ASR of FDNY fire-
fighters with only light-chain MGUS was 3.08 per 100 per-
sons (95% CI, 1.66-4.50 per 100 persons), much greater than
that of Olmsted County, which had an ASR of 0.98 per 100 per-
sons (95% CI, 0.76-1.21 per 100 persons). The relative risk of
having light-chain MGUS was 3.1-fold significantly higher (RR,
3.13; 95% CI, 1.99-4.93) when comparing WTC-exposed FDNY
firefighters with the Olmsted County population. Last,
Figure 2C shows that, among the same population, the ASR of
FDNY firefighters with only MGUS was 4.55 per 100 persons
(95% CI, 2.90-6.21 per 100 persons) and was slightly but not
significantlyhigherthantheOlmstedCountycohort(ASR,3.36;
95%CI,2.95-3.77;RR,1.35;95%CI,0.96-1.91)(Figure2C).Over-
all MGUS was assessed by WTC arrival time and by duration
at the WTC site; for all arrival times the ASRs were greater than
in the reference population, although we did not find an ex-
posure gradient (data not shown). Additionally, there was no
significant difference in ASRs when duration of work at the
WTC site was included in the analyses (data not shown).
Discussion
In this first comprehensive study focusing on characteristics
ofmultiplemyelomaanditsprecursordisease(MGUSandlight-
chain MGUS) among WTC-exposed first responders, we ob-
serve striking patterns. We found the median age of multiple
myeloma diagnosis to be 57 years, which is roughly 12 years
younger than what is seen nationally,2 and because symp-
toms usually develop shortly after clinical manifestation of the
disease(approximately 1year),thiswouldargueagainstalead-
time bias. Furthermore, the proportion of participants with
CD20-expressing plasma cells—characteristics associated with
a poorer prognosis—was more than 3.5-fold higher than found
in other populations (71% vs approximately 20%).2,5,21,22
Among WTC-exposed white, male firefighters, the propor-
tion of light-chain multiple myeloma was more than double
that of the general population (50% vs approximately 20%).4
Similarly, in our screening study, we found a 2-fold signifi-
cantly higher risk of myeloma precursor disease, particularly
light-chain MGUS, the precursor of light-chain multiple
myeloma.5 As suggested previously based on smaller
numbers,10-14 our study shows that WTC exposure may be a
risk factor for the development of multiple myeloma and its
precursor disease.
Prior studies in cohorts without WTC exposure have found
an increased risk of MGUS and light-chain MGUS among indi-
viduals exposed to known and suspected carcinogens includ-
ing PCB, dioxins, PAHs, and asbestos,6-8 including exposure

cases to be of light-chain multiple myeloma subtype, which
is more than double the rate in other populations (50%
vs approximately 20%).4 In our screening study, we ob-
served 18 of 47 (38%; 95% CI, 26%-53%) of the precursor cases
to have light-chain MGUS, the precursor of light-chain mul-
tiple myeloma. Furthermore, we found that the risk of hav-
inglight-chainMGUSwas3timeshigher(RR,3.13;95%CI,1.99-
4.93) among our population compared with the Olmsted
County population. These findings are of interest due to pre-
viously observed associations between light-chain multiple
myeloma and light-chain MGUS and exposure to toxins6,17 and
chronic immune stimulation.23
Many WTC first responders were initially exposed to aero-
solized dust and toxic fumes from burning jet fuel and build-
ing materials. For the next 10 months of the rescue, recovery,
and cleanup effort, responders were exposed to burning sub-
terranean fires that released trapped gases and dust, and were
not extinguished until the end of December. The final insult
includeddieselfuelcombustionbyproductsfromheavyequip-
ment used at the site. The WTC dust itself included pulver-
ized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, PAHs, PCBs, and poly-
chlorinated furans and dioxins produced as combustion
byproducts from the collapsed and burning buildings.9 Many
of these substances are known carcinogens, providing bio-
logicplausibilityforanassociationbetweenWTCexposureand
cancer.9,24-26Althoughsomecontaminantscoulddirectlycause
cancer, WTC exposure has been shown to trigger chronic in-
flammation resulting in upper and lower respiratory diseases
and autoimmune diseases,27-29 and, therefore, inflammation-
induced oncogenesis should also be considered as a potential
mechanism.23

Limitations
Weacknowledgethatourstudyhaslimitations.First,inourmy-
eloma case series analysis, we were not able to rigorously com-
pareFDNYandnationalage-adjustedincidenceratesduetosmall
or zero counts in certain age strata. This is often a challenge in
the study of rare cancers.31 Additionally, when MGUS was as-
sessedbyWTCarrivaltime,32 forallarrivaltimestheASRswere
greaterthaninthereferencepopulation.However,thestudywas
underpoweredtodetectanexposure-responsegradientassocia-
tionbetweenWTCexposureandMGUS.Nonetheless,wedidob-
serve an elevated risk of overall MGUS and light-chain MGUS
compared with the Olmsted County population. While a com-
parison group composed exclusively of firefighters with no ex-
posure to the WTC disaster or a truly random sample of the US
population would be most desirable, no such cohort data were
available. Specifically, no other study meeting those criteria
screenedallparticipantsforlight-chainMGUSinthesameman-
ner that we did. The Olmsted County population matched our
testingprotocolandwasdemographicallysimilarandthuspro-
videdavaluablecomparisonforthisstudy.Similarly,duetosmall
numbers in the firefighter cohort and lack of an adequate com-
parisonpopulation,racesotherthanwhiteandwomenwereex-
cluded. Future research investigating MGUS and light-chain
MGUS may provide additional comparisons to our full popula-
tion,aswellasotherWTC-exposedpopulations,importantpopu-
lations in need of follow-up.
Furthermore, in our case series analysis it is possible that
the onset of precursor disease states may have preceded WTC
exposure; however, 75% of myeloma cases were diagnosed
more than 5 years after 9/11, with half being at least 12 years
following the attacks. This suggests that, for most, the precur-
sor disease likely developed after 9/11.33 Last, while we con-
trolled for the main risk factors for MGUS, we cannot rule out
thepossibilityofuncontrolledconfoundingbetweentheFDNY
population and the Olmsted County population.
Thisstudyhadanumberofstrengths.First,webelievethat
our case ascertainment was excellent; this included match-
ing to tumor registries where more than 98% of our cohort re-
side, as well as full access to the FDNY electronic medical rec-
ord where approximately 87% have had a monitoring or
treatment visit within the past 2 years. Second, to our knowl-
edge, this is the largest study to characterize multiple my-
eloma in WTC-exposed responders. More importantly, this is
thefirststudytoestablishtheage-specificprevalenceofMGUS/
light-chain MGUS in a well-defined population of WTC-
exposed responders.
Conclusions
In summary, we identified and characterized all WTC-exposed
white,maleFDNYfirefighterswhoreceivedadiagnosisofmul-
tiplemyelomafromSeptember12,2001toJuly1,2017,and50%
(7 of 14) of these cases were light-chain multiple myeloma. The
medianageatmultiplemyelomadiagnosiswas57years,which
