IMPORTANCE With a prevalence of 4% to 13% in the United States, autoimmune thyroiditis
(AIT) is a major health problem. Besides somatic complications, patients with AIT can also
experience psychiatric disorders. The extent of these organic psychiatric diseases in patients
with AIT, however, is so far not commonly known.
OBJECTIVE To provide meta-analytic data on the association of depression and anxiety
with AIT.
DATA SOURCES Google Scholar, the EBSCO Host databases, the Web of Knowledge, and
PubMed were searched from inception through December 5, 2017. Articles identified were
reviewed and reference lists were searched manually.
STUDY SELECTION Case-control studies that reported the association between AIT and either
depression or anxiety disorders or both were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction was performed by multiple observers
following the PRISMA guidelines. Two univariate random-effects meta-analyses were
performed, and moderators were tested with Bonferroni-corrected meta-regression analysis.
Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of
the results. Small study effects were assessed with funnel plots and the Egger test.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The odds ratio of patients with AIT and depression
compared with a healthy control group, as well as the odds ratio of patients with AIT and
anxiety disorders compared with a healthy control group.
RESULTS Nineteen studies comprising 21 independent samples were included, with a total of
36 174 participants (35 168 for depression and 34 094 for anxiety). Patients with AIT,
Hashimoto thyroiditis, or subclinical or overt hypothyroidism had significantly higher scores
on standardized depression instruments, with an odds ratio of 3.56 (95% CI, 2.14-5.94;
I2 = 92.1%). For anxiety disorders, patients with AIT, Hashimoto thyroiditis, or subclinical or
overt hypothyroidism had an odds ratio of 2.32 (95% CI, 1.40-3.85; I2 = 89.8%). Funnel plot
asymmetry was detected for studies of depression. Study quality assessed with the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case-control studies (mean [SD] score: anxiety, 5.77 [1.17];
depression, 5.65 [1.14]; of a possible maximum score of 9) and proportion of females did not
modulate the meta-analytic estimate, whereas mean age did.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This meta-analysis establishes the association between AIT
and depression and anxiety disorders. Patients with AIT exhibit an increased chance of
developing symptoms of depression and anxiety or of receiving a diagnosis of depression and
anxiety disorders. This finding has important implications for patients and could lead to the
choice of early treatment—and not only psychotherapeutic treatment—of the organic
disorder.

 A
utoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is a common disease with
a prevalence of approximately 4% to 13% in the United
States.1,2 It affects more women than men1 and its fre-
quency increases with age, up to 20% among elderly females.3
The prevalence rates differ depending on the diagnostic cri-
teria applied, the decade the study was conducted, and the
sample examined. For example, 40% to 45% of women and
20% of men in the United Kingdom and the United States show
some degree of focal thyroiditis (1 to 10 foci per cm2) when ex-
amined at autopsy.4 The terminology concerning hypothy-
roidism and how it can be traced back to AIT is described in
eAppendix 1 and eTable 1 in the Supplement.

Recently, the connection between autoimmunity and psy-
chiatric disorders has been discovered for various autoim-
mune diseases. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypofunction
caused by immunoglobulin antibodies, for instance, has been
found to be associated with the development of schizophre-
niaandpsychoses.7,8Moreover,meta-analyticinformationsug-
gests that tic disorders are associated with a significant in-
creaseinantistreptolysinOtiters.9Furtherresultsindicatethat
autoimmune explanatory approaches are possible for bipolar
disorders10 or Alzheimer disease.11 With the introduction of
new immunologic techniques and the expansion of immuno-
neuropsychiatric research, evidence is accumulating that at
least a subset of psychiatric disorders has an autoimmune
basis.12 Considering these insights, our analysis will contrib-
utetoafurtherclarificationofthepsychiatricassociationswith
autoimmune thyroid disease.
There are a variety of consequences for patients with AIT.
Onthesomaticside,hypothyroidismleadstoalterationsincar-
diovascular function such as higher blood pressure due to
increased systemic vascular resistance13 and advanced
atherosclerosis.14Furthermore,AITcontributestoahigherrisk
of infertility and early miscarriage,15 as well as to weight gain
even after treatment with thyroxine.16
Less is known about specific psychiatric burden of symp-
toms in patients with AIT. Studies describe a cumulative oc-
currence of mood disorders and symptoms of depression
among patients in a hypothyroid state, as well as frequent thy-
roid diseases among patients with depression.17-21 Moreover,
fewer studies describe symptoms of anxiety in patients with
AIT.17,21-24 Occasional investigations study other (neuro)
psychological symptoms associated with AIT, such as atten-
tional and executive disturbances,25 fatigue,16 or reduction in
quality of life.26,27
Despite growing interest in the psychiatric implications of
AIT, most published studies still focus on its somatic effects.
A further investigation of this association has importance for
public health, physicians, and patients. Societal and eco-
nomic costs caused by depression and anxiety disorders are
high28,29 and can be lowered by appropriate and early treat-
ment. By quantitatively summarizing the results concerning
AIT as a possible root of some mood disorders, the awareness
for this association increases and a proper thyroid and anti-
depressant treatment can be implemented beyond psycho-
therapy. Furthermore, screening tests for symptoms of de-
pressionandanxietyinpatientswithAITandforAITinpatients
with depression and anxiety could be established.
To our knowledge, there are only a few qualitative re-
views describing an association between AIT and the devel-
opment of depression and anxiety disorders,22,30-32 whereas
no quantitative analysis concerning this topic exists. Conse-
quently, there are no numbers of an overall association of AIT
with depression and anxiety. We overcome this existing lim-
itedevidencebyconductingwhatis,toourknowledge,thefirst
meta-analysis testing the association of depression or anx-
ious symptoms among individuals with AIT or any other form
of hypothyroidism compared with healthy controls. We hy-
pothesize that patients with hypothyroidism have a substan-
tially higher risk of developing these psychiatric diseases ir-
respective of sex and age.
Methods
Search Strategy
The 2-step literature search comprised Google Scholar, the
EBSCO Host databases (including PsycINFO, PsycArticles,
PSYNDEX, ERIC, Medline), the Web of Knowledge, and
PubMed. The search was conducted from inception until
December 5, 2017, and included abstracts in English and Ger-
man. The following search terms were combined in several
ways: Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, autoimmune
thyroiditis, Hashimoto-thyreoiditis, autoimmunthyreoiditis,
depression, depressive, mood, mental, anxiety, depression, and
angst. In a second step, the reference lists of articles retrieved
were searched manually. The abstracts of all these articles
were screened using our selection criteria. On the basis of a
full-text review the remaining articles were checked for
eligibility following the PRISMA statement33 (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Selection Criteria
If the following criteria were met, studies were included: pub-
lication from 1992 to 2017, studies were published in English or
Key Points
Question To what extent are depression and anxiety associated
with autoimmune thyroiditis when estimated meta-analytically?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 studies
comprising 36 174 participants, patients with autoimmune
thyroiditis showed significantly higher depression and anxiety
disorder scores compared with healthy controls.
Meaning The evident association between autoimmune
thyroiditis and depression and anxiety has important implications
for the information of patients and could lead to the choice of early
treatment—and not only psychotherapeutic treatment—of the
organic disorder.

could thus bias the results of our analysis. The literature search
wassummarizedaccordingtothePRISMAguidelines36(eTable
2 in the Supplement).
Recorded Variables
Data extraction was performed by 2 investigators (E.-M.S. and
T.W.G.) according to the previously defined coding protocol
(eTable 3 in the Supplement). Disagreement was resolved by
discussion and compromise on the extracted values.
For the outcome variable, on the one hand we extracted
the baseline sample size and the number of patients with clini-
cally relevant scores on the depression or anxiety assessment
instrument. On the other hand, we extracted the mean and SD
scores on the depression or anxiety test for both groups to cir-
cumvent missing values. In the case of 2 studies,37,38 we used
values of the representative norming sample found in the in-
struments’manuals39,40 as scores for the control group, since
the original control group comprised patients with goiter. All
recorded variables can be found in the coding protocol (eTable
3 in the Supplement).
We collected additional moderators as stated in the Sta-
tistical Analysis section. Quality was assessed via the New-
castle-Ottawa Scale for case-control studies.41 This tool con-
sists of 3 categories (selection, comparability, and exposure)
with a total of 8 items (eTable 4 in the Supplement). A study
can be awarded a maximum of 1 star for each item within the
selection and exposure category and a maximum of 2 stars can
be given for comparability. A higher overall quality sum score
reflects superior study quality.
Statistical Analysis
The outcome measure was the odds ratio (OR) of patients with
AIT and depression compared with a healthy control group, as
well as the OR of patients with AIT and anxiety disorders com-
paredwithahealthycontrolgroup.TheORwascalculatedasthe
proportionoftheprobabilitytohavepsychiatricsymptomswhile
beingintheexperimentalgroupandtheprobabilitytohavepsy-
chiatric symptoms while being in the control group.
A meta-analysis was conducted using the metafor
package42 within the R open-source software environment,
version 3.3.2.43 The R code and output used in this meta-
analysis are available in eAppendix 2 in the Supplement. We
performed 2 univariate meta-analyses using restricted maxi-
mum likelihood estimation in the function rma.uni(). Non-
independence among effect sizes was accounted for by aggre-
gating. Heterogeneity among effect sizes within data sets was
assessed via the I2 statistic. This statistic can be interpreted as
the percentage of the total variability in a set of effect sizes ow-
ingtobetween-studiesvariability.44TheCochranehandbook44
proposes a tentative classification where I2 of 30% to 60% in-
dicates moderate heterogeneity, I2 of 50% to 90% indicates
substantial heterogeneity, and I2 greater than 75% indicates
considerable heterogeneity.
To explain residual heterogeneity and to understand the
potential effect of contextual factors on the outcome, we ran

dicate whether meta-regression models were more or less par-
simonious than the intercept-only model.
We performed 1 prespecified subgroup analysis investi-
gating the difference in the outcome measure between stud-
ies assessing the level of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (and
thus verifying the diagnosis of AIT) and studies that did not
assesstheantibodies.Asecondposthocsubgroupanalysiswas
conducted to examine whether dimensional measures led to
different results than categorical measures.

the funnel function of R, which produced contour-enhanced
funnel plots for the visual detection of asymmetries. In addi-
tion, the Egger regression test for the detection of asymmetry
in the funnel plot45 was conducted. We considered analyses

 to be biased if the intercept differed from zero at P = .10 as the
authors originally proposed.45
We evaluated the sensitivity of our analyses by compar-
ing fitted models with and without effect sizes that we as-
sume to be influential outliers. Influential outliers were de-
fined as standardized residual values exceeding 3.0 and hat
values (ie, diagonal elements of the hat matrix) greater than 2
times the average hat value.46 P < .05 (1-sided) was consid-
ered statistically significant, except for the regression test for
small study effects as stated above.
Results
Database
The literature search (Figure 1) identified 19 independent ar-
ticlesand42partlydependentsamplessincesomearticlescon-
tributed more than 1 sample. We identified 26 samples deal-
ing with depression and 16 with anxiety (Table).
A total of 11 samples comprised patients with Hashimoto
thyroiditis, 11 samples comprised patients with AIT, 8 samples
comprised patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and 12
samples comprised patients with overt hypothyroidism. The
distinction between these 3 subtypes of hypothyroidism re-
fers mostly to terminological differences (eAppendix 1 in the
Supplement). Age, sex, instruments used to assess the psy-
chiatric diagnosis, the country of the study population, and
prevalence rates for depression and anxiety are detailed in
eTable 5 in the Supplement.
Meta-analytic Association Between AIT and Depression
A total of 26 samples reported outcome data for the different
forms of hypothyroidism and depression (Table). In most of
the cases, depression was assessed by self-descriptive ques-
tionnaires (eg, 10 of the samples [38.5%] used versions of the
Beck Depression Inventory39,47 and 2 of the samples [7.7%]
used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale48), whereas
only few studies used questionnaires or interviews filled in by
diagnosticians (eg, 5 of the samples [19.2%] used the Hamil-
tonDepressionScale49and4ofthesamples[15.4%]usedvaria-
tionsoftheCompositeInternationalDiagnosticInterview50,51).
Studies that defined psychiatric disorders via cutoff values of
dimensional measures were concordant in their definitions.
We found that the chance of developing symptoms of
depression that were of clinical relevance is 3.5 times
higher among patients with hypothyroidism compared with
healthy controls (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.14-5.94) (Table). Figure 2
shows the overall association of AIT with symptoms of
depression.17,19,21,23,25,27,37,38,52-61
Meta-analytic Association Between AIT
and Anxiety Disorders
A total of 16 samples reported outcome data for the different
forms of hypothyroidism and anxiety disorders (Table). Ow-
ing to a lack of data, it was not possible to detect differences
among the diverse forms of anxiety disorders. Anxiety was
mostlyassessedviaself-descriptivequestionnaires(eg,2ofthe
samples [12.5%] used the Beck Anxiety Inventory,62 2 of the
samples [12.5%] used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale,48 and 3 of the samples [18.8%] used the State-Trait Anxi-
ety Inventory40) and was sometimes assessed using question-
naires or interviews filled in by diagnosticians (eg, 5 of the
samples [31.3%] used variations of the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview50,51). Studies that defined psychi-
atric disorders via cutoff values of dimensional measures were
concordant in their definitions.
We found that the chance of developing anxiety disor-
ders is more than 2 times higher among patients with hypo-
thyroidism compared with healthy controls (OR, 2.32; 95% CI,
1.40-3.85) (Table). Figure 3 shows the overall effect of AIT on
anxiety disorders.17,21,23,25,27,37,55,57,59-61,63
Sensitivity Analysis, Publication Bias, and Meta-regression
There were significant amounts of heterogeneity, both for the
depressionmodel(Q = 205.8;P < .001;I2 = 92.1%)andtheanxi-
ety model (Q = 104.4; P < .001; I2 = 89.8%) (Table). Sensitiv-
ity analyses revealed no statistical outliers except for 1 study19
touching the upper limit of the acceptable residual range
(−3 to 3). Thus, the robustness of our results was confirmed.

 Concerning anxiety, there was no evidence of small study
effects indicated by Egger regression tests. The Egger test for
depression, however, revealed significant asymmetries in the
distribution of published studies and thus suggests publica-
tion bias.
Slope (β), 95% CIs, and P values for meta-regression mod-
elsinvestigatingstudyquality,proportionoffemales,andmean
age are detailed in eTable 6 in the Supplement. We found only
1 significant effect at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of
P = .008, indicating that the extent of symptoms of depres-
sion is moderated by the participants’mean age (β = –0.0971;
P = .004). The 2 subgroup analyses revealed no significant ef-
fect on the association of AIT and depression or anxiety.
Discussion
Although underexplored, the association between AIT and de-
pression and anxiety is an important topic with implications
for both patients and physicians. Autoimmune thyroiditis is
a common disease with high prevalence rates (4%-13% in the
United States1,2) that increase with advancing age.3 To ad-

 dress this importance, we report what is, to our knowledge,
the first meta-analytic review of psychiatric issues among pa-
tients with hypothyroidism that examines a large data set of
19 studies with a total of 36 174 participants. Our robust re-
sults are in accordance with the hypothesis that patients with
AIT have a higher chance to show symptoms of depression and
anxiety compared with healthy controls.
Takingasabasisageneral12-monthprevalencefordepres-
sionof6.6%5,6andageneral12-monthprevalenceforanxietydis-
orders of 18.1%6 in the United States, we conclude with ORs of
3.56 (depression) and 2.32 (anxiety) that approximately 23.8%
of patients with AIT experience depression and approximately
41.6%ofpatientswithAITexperienceanxietydisorders.Thatim-
plies that 3% of the US population (approximately 9.7 million
people)hasdepressionand5.4%oftheUSpopulation(approxi-
mately17.5millionpeople)hasanxietydisordersconcomitantly
withAIT.Thus,45.5%ofdepressivedisordersand29.8%ofanxi-

disorder68).Thesecircumstancesfurtheramplifytherelevance
of our meta-analytic review.
Out of 3 moderators (study quality, proportion of fe-
males, and mean age) only mean age altered the association
between AIT and depression (eTable 6 in the Supplement). Re-
sults and interpretation of the moderator analyses are dis-
cussed in eAppendix 3 of the Supplement.
Based on qualitative reviews there were strong indications
ofahigherprevalenceofdepressionandanxietyamongpatients
with hypothyroidism. Marangell and Callahan30 describe first

Classical, tricyclic antidepressants, however, are not suited for
patients with hypothyroidism. On the one hand, patients with
hypothyroidism do not respond as well to tricyclic antidepres-

search, presents data of sufficient quality, and computes out-
come measures independent of the studies’risk of bias. Nev-
ertheless,therearesomelimitationsofthisstudy.Thehighlev-

 and limitations of our analysis can be found in eAppendix 3
in the Supplement.
Future research should focus on more specific analyses,
such as differentiating the various forms of hypothyroidism
(eTable 1 in the Supplement) or investigating its association
with subforms of anxiety. Moreover, it is important to exam-
ine the influence of AIT on concrete symptoms of depression
and thus clarify the causal relationship behind this associa-
tion. In a next step, the interaction of thyroid hormones and
brain regions responsible for depression or anxiety should be
further researched. Overall, it is necessary to develop a bio-
psychosocial model about the origin of depression and anxi-
ety that also comprises AIT.
Conclusions
Autoimmune thyroiditis is associated with depression and
anxiety disorders. It is thus important to enhance awareness
among physicians about this connection to accelerate the di-
agnostic process. In patients with depression and anxiety dis-
orders, a test for AIT should be performed and in patients with
AIT, a screening for psychiatric symptoms is necessary. Ad-
vantagesforpatientsareappropriatetreatmenttakingintocon-
