 Anticipating the "Silver Tsunami": Prevalence
Trajectories and Comorbidity Burden among
Older Cancer Survivors in the United States
Shirley M. Bluethmann1,2, Angela B. Mariotto3, and Julia H. Rowland4
Abstract
Background: Cancer survivors are a growing population,
due in large part to the aging of the baby boomer generation
and the related "silver tsunami" facing the U.S. health care
system. Understanding the impact of a graying nation on
cancer prevalence and comorbidity burden is critical in
informing efforts to design and implement quality cancer
care for this population.
Methods: Incidence and survival data from 1975 to 2011
were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) Program to estimate current cancer
prevalence. SEER-Medicare claims data were used to esti-
mate
comorbidity
burden.
Prevalence
projections
were
made using U.S. Census Bureau data and the Prevalence
Incidence Approach Model, assuming constant future inci-
dence and survival trends but dynamic projections of the
U.S. population.
Results: In 2016, there were an estimated 15.5 million cancer
survivors living in the United States, 62% of whom were 65 years
or older. The prevalent population is projected to grow to 26.1
million by 2040, and include 73% of survivors who are 65 years
and older. Comorbidity burden was highest in the oldest survi-
vors (those �85 years) and worst among lung cancer survivors.
Conclusions: Older adults, who often present with complex
health needs, now constitute the majority of cancer survivors
and will continue to dominate the survivor population over the
next 24 years.
Impact: The oldest adults (i.e., those >75 years) should be
priority populations in a pressing cancer control and prevention
research agenda that includes expanding criteria for clinical
trials to recruit more elderly participants and developing relevant
supportive care interventions. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(7);

Introduction
Cancer survivors are a rapidly growing population, fueled in
large part by the aging U.S. population (1). Current prevalence
figures already indicate that more than half of all cancer
survivors are older than 65 years of age, and that the graying
of the baby boomer generation will cause the numbers of older
survivors to continue to rise dramatically (2, 3). This demo-
graphic shift in the composition of the survivor population will
pose challenges to the design and delivery of quality cancer
care (4). Older adults commonly have preexisting comorbid
conditions that can be exacerbated by cancer-related toxicities
that may persist after completion of primary treatment or
appear years later (1, 5). One large population-based study
estimated that older adults experienced an average of five
comorbid conditions, two of which were reported to have
developed after a cancer diagnosis (6). It is increasingly rec-
ognized that older survivors have complex healthcare needs,
but these are poorly understood (7). Importantly, little is
known about the burden of cancer and comorbidity among
the oldest adults (i.e., especially those aged 85 years and older)
compared with other older adults, and how this burden may
change over time (8).
In assessing the needs of older survivors, it is important to
consider the increasingly common experience of cancer as a
chronic disease (9). With advances in early detection and the
effectiveness of cancer treatments, long-term survivorship is
becoming a reality for most of those diagnosed with cancer.
Currently, an estimated 64% of all survivors have lived 5 years
beyond diagnosis and 40% have lived 10 years beyond diagnosis
(3, 10). This combination of attributes in the cancer survivor
profile (ie, advanced age, longevity, and multiple health condi-
tions) may foreshadow a "silver tsunami" (11) of cancer survivors
whose health needs we are unprepared to meet (5, 12).
The primary purpose of this report is to provide current
estimates of comorbidity prevalence at diagnosis and projec-
tions of future cancer prevalence that reflect the aging of the
U.S. population under the assumptions of current cancer
control efforts. This report will focus on cancer survivors 65
years and older to inform research and care targeting this
growing, heterogeneous, and often medically complex popu-
lation. The specific aims are to: (i) assess the effect of an aging
population on cancer prevalence among older adults from
1975 to present, and provide prevalence projections from

Materials and Methods
Prevalence projections: Method overview
We projected future U.S. cancer prevalence from 2016 to 2040
using the Prevalence Incidence Approach Model (PIAMOD;
refs. 13–15). This statistical method provides estimates and
projections of cancer prevalence from cancer incidence, cancer
survival, and mortality for all causes of death. The method uses a
mathematical equation that relates prevalence to incidence and
mortality. The input data required by PIAMOD are the estimated
number of U.S. cancer incidence cases, U.S. population, U.S.
deaths (all causes), and modeled cancer survival. The PIAMOD
method has been used previously to provide projections of cancer
prevalence through 2020 (14).
Data sources for prevalence projections
Population estimates from 1975 through 2013 were obtained
from the U.S. Census Bureau. We used a demographic method to
obtain smoothed single age population estimates from age-related
subgroups (85–89, 90–94, and 95–99 years) by calendar year, sex,
and race. U.S. population projections from 2013 through 2040
were obtained from the 2014 National Projections (16). These
projections are based on the 2010 Census and on assumptions
aboutfuturebirths,deaths,and netinternational migration and are
available for individuals ages 1 to 99 years and 100 years and older.
SEER incidence
The number of U.S. incidence cancer cases from 1975 through
2012 (17) is estimated using SEER data from the nine initial
registries that include the states of Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa,
New Mexico, Utah, and four metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Detroit,
San Francisco-Oakland, and Seattle, representing approximately
11% of theU.S. population (18). Only the first malignant cancer is
included in incidence rates so that individual observations are
unique (i.e., counted only once) in prevalence estimates.
U.S. incidence
The number of U.S. cancer cases were calculated by applying the
yearly SEER-9 rates to the respective US population by sex, race
(white, black, and other), year (1975–2012), and age (0 to 99).
Projections of U.S. cancer cases from 2013 through 2040 were
calculated by applying the (2008–2012) average SEER-9 5-year
cancer incidence rates to the U.S. population projections by sex,
year, and age, thus assuming flat incidence (i.e., no changes) from
2013 through 2040.
Cancer survival
Relative survival for patients diagnosed with malignant can-
cer between 1973 and 2011 in SEER-9 was calculated from
SEER�Stat software (19) by sex, period of diagnosis (1973–
1975, 1976–1978. . .2009–2011), and age at diagnosis (15–44,
45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and 85–99). A parametric mix-
ture cure model was fit to the SEER relative survival (15, 20).
The model was stratified by age group with a trend parameter
for year of diagnosis (15). Because of data variability and
difficulties in modeling relative survival for ages 85 and older
(models did not converge or provided unrealistic estimates),
we assumed that cancer survival for patients diagnosed at ages
85 to 99 years was the same as for patients diagnosed at ages
75 to 84 years. To project prevalence, we assumed that cancer
survival for patients diagnosed in 2012 or later was the same as
the modeled survival for patients diagnosed in 2009–2011.
The number of U.S. deaths (all causes) were provided by the
National Center for Health Statistics from SEER�Stat software
(19) using sex, age, and year at death from 1975 to 2012.
Projections of the number of U.S. deaths from 2013 through
2040 were calculated by applying the 5-year average U.S. mor-
tality rates (2008–2012) to U.S. population projections by sex,
year, and age groups.
Prevalence projection method and assumptions
The cancer prevalence projections for years 2013 and beyond
are based on dynamic projections of the U.S. population and flat
incidence and survival, as observed in the last years of available
data (2008–2012). These projections can be interpreted as the
effect of the growth and aging of the U.S. population based on
current cancer control technologies. The PIAMOD method pro-
vided prevalence estimates for ages 0 to 99. To include cancer
survivors ages 100 years and older, we assumed that cancer
prevalence of people ages 100 and older was the same as for
people ages 95 to 99. We estimated the number of cancer survivors
100 years and older by multiplying the proportion of survivors
between ages 95 and 99 and applying to estimates and projections
of the population of adults 100 years and older.
Procedures for calculating comorbidity burden
Claims from the November 2014 SEER-Medicare linkage
data and from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries
residing in the SEER areas free of cancer were used to describe
comorbidity burden (18). The cancer cohort consisted of Medi-
care beneficiaries 66 to 90 years of age residing in the SEER 11
cancer registry areas diagnosed with cancer between 2007 and
2011. Noncancer controls were randomly selected from the 5%
sample of cancer-free beneficiaries in the SEER areas for each
calendar year and were frequency matched to cancer cases by
sex and age. Comorbid conditions for cancer survivors were
identified in the year before the date of cancer diagnosis. For
individuals without cancer, their comorbid conditions were
identified in the year before their birthday in the matched
calendar year. Cases and controls were required to have con-
tinuous Part A and Part B fee-for-service Medicare coverage
during the whole year. The 5% cohort of cancer-free Medicare
beneficiaries consisted of multiple records per individual.
We ascertained 16 comorbid conditions described by Charlson
and
colleagues
(21)
using
similar
procedures
developed
by Klabunde and colleagues (22, 23). The conditions includ-
ed: acute myocardialinfarction (MI), myocardialinfarction history,
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cerebrovascular
disease (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
congestive heart failure (CHF), dementia, diabetes, diabetes with
complications, liver disease (mild), liver disease (moderate/
severe), paralysis (hemiplegia or paraplegia), peripheral vascular
disease, renal disease, rheumatologic disease, and ulcer. Similar
conditions, including liver disease (mild) and liver disease (mod-
erate/severe) as well as diabetes and diabetes with complications,
were grouped together. Because the focus was on studying

 comorbid conditions in cancer patients, solid cancers, leukemias,
and lymphomas were excluded. Conditions were identified from
physician and hospitalclaims using the InternationalClassification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and fourth
edition of Common Procedural Terminology codes. Conditions
in the physician claims, but not in hospital claims, were required to
appear more than once in a period greater than 30 days.
Instead of using a simple count of conditions to estimate
burden, weights for each condition were estimated using a Cox
proportional hazard model to represent the impact of the con-
dition on noncancer survival (24). For each individual, a comor-
bidity score was calculated as the weighted sum of their identified
comorbid conditions by the condition weight.
The severity of comorbidity burden was considered by defining
three groups based on comorbidity weights and clinical implica-
tions (24, 25). The groups were: (i) no reported comorbidities; (ii)
moderate comorbidity, which included conditions that usually
do not require physicians to adjust cancer treatment (such as acute
MI, history of MI, ulcers, rheumatologic disease, diabetes, periph-
eral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and paralysis); and
(iii) severe comorbidity burden, which refers to severe illnesses
that frequently lead to organ failure or systemic dysfunction and
always require adjustment of cancer treatment. The severe con-
ditions included COPD, liver dysfunction, chronic renal failure,
dementia, CHF, and AIDS as well as people with multiple
comorbidities who may require special considerations for cancer
treatment. It should be noted that common conditions such as
hypertension or arthritis have not been included in this study,
which is consistent with Charlson index.
Results
Projected cancer prevalence
Between 2016 and 2040, the projected prevalence of cancer
survivors will increase from an estimated 15.5 million (total
population 324 million) to 26.1 million survivors (total popu-
lation 380 million) across all age groups. In the prevalent pop-
ulation, it is expected that 73% of survivors will be age 65 and
older in 2040, compared with 18% of survivors 50 to 64 years and
just 8% of survivors who will be less than 50 years old at that time.
This dramatic increase mirrors the pattern of increased incidence
driven by an aging population, such that in 2040, the most
prevalent groups of survivors will be those from older age groups.
Specifically, in 2040, survivors ages 65–74 years will account for
24% of all survivors, those 75–84 years will account for 31% of all
survivors, and those 85 years and older will represent 18% of
survivors (Fig. 1).
Pairing these projections with historical trends since 1975,
we observed a steep overall incline in prevalence, especially for
older survivors. Among survivors 50 to 64 years, we estimated
an almost 4-fold increase in projected prevalence from 1975 to
2040. However, the projected increase in prevalence was sub-
stantially larger in older age groups. Comparing 1975 preva-
lence estimates to projected prevalence estimates in 2040, we
noted a 6-fold increase for those 65 to 74 years; a 10-fold
increase for those ages 75 to 84 years, and a 17-fold increase for
those 85 years and older (Fig. 1). These data foretell a steady
rise in cancer prevalence among older age groups over the next
24 years.
Updated prevalence of cancer distributed by age and gender
Examining prevalence across the U.S. population (estimated
at 323,995,680 in 2016), we observed that overall cancer
prevalence was similar between men and women of all ages,
but that cancer prevalence was higher among men than women
in older age groups (Fig. 2). In younger age groups, including
those ages 55–59 and 60–64 years, the percentage of male and
female cancer survivors is similar, with men trailing slightly
behind women (6%–7% and 9%–10%, respectively), but this
shifts in adults older than age 65 years, wherein 14% of the

 nearly 8 million men ages 65–69 years had been diagnosed
with cancer, compared with 12% of 8.9 million women of the
same age group. This differential becomes larger in older age
groups, such that there is a higher percentage of male than
female survivors for: 70–74 year olds (5% more males than
females); 75–79 year olds (8% more males than females); and
80–84 and 85–89 year olds (11% more male than female
survivors). The greatest difference for cancer survivors by
gender is for those 90 years and older, wherein 37% of the
765,660 men ages 90 years and older are cancer survivors, 12%
more than females of the same age group, which included
1.7 million women (Fig. 2).
Comparison of comorbidity burden of older adults with and
without a cancer history
In our assessment of survivors of all cancer sites across age
groups, we noted some unexpected results (Table 1). For exam-
ple, approximately 50% of survivors 70–74 years experienced
no comorbidities (based on our procedures) before diagnosis.
However, an increase in history of severe comorbidity was
observed with increasing age, rising from 27% in survivors
66–69 years (all cancer sites) to 47% in adults 85 years and
older (all cancer sites).
We noted more similarity in comorbidity burden related to age
than cancer status, which has also been observed in other studies
(26, 27). In the noncancer cohort, an estimated 42% of those 85
years and older had serious comorbidity burden, which was only
slightly lower than the estimated prevalence of serious comor-
bidity burden in survivors of all cancer sites (47%). The groups
with the least burden were those 66–74 years, where up to 66% of
adults without a cancer history scored zero for comorbid condi-
tions. But, up to 56% of cancer survivors 66–74 years also fell into
this category, again suggesting the role of younger age in miti-
gating comorbidity burden.
Focusing on specific cancer sites, we noted that lung cancer
survivors consistently had the worst comorbidity burden of any
cancer site across age groups, with nearly 50% of lung cancer
survivors ages 65–69 years experiencing severe comorbidity bur-
den and 57% of survivors 85 years or older experiencing severe
comorbidity burden. In comparison, breast and prostate cancer
survivors had consistently lower comorbidity burden than survi-
vors of other cancer sites, which was generally more similar to the
noncancer cohort, anassociation that persistedinolder age groups.
For example, breast and prostate cancer survivors ages 65–69 years
had lower burden of severe comorbidity (17% and 16%, respec-
tively) compared with 16% for noncancer controls. This burden
rose to 37% (breast cancer survivors) and 41% (prostate cancer
survivors) in survivors 85 years and older, still lower than the
estimates for noncancer controls (42%) of that age group. These
estimates were also notably lower than the observed comorbidity
burden among similarly aged survivors of other cancer sites,
including colorectal, oral, bladder,and leukemia cancers (Table 1).
Among cancer survivors, the three most prevalent comorbid
conditions were CHF, COPD, and diabetes (Table 2). Colorectal
cancer survivors had the highest overall prevalence of CHF com-
pared with other sites, with the oldest survivors having the highest
burden (22% of those 85 years and older). Lung cancer survivors
had the highest prevalence of COPD, more than 40% of lung
cancer survivors 65–84 years experiencing this condition. Com-
paratively, female breast cancer survivors had the lowest preva-
lence of COPD, with 13% or less experiencing this condition in
any age group. Diabetes was consistently the most common of the
three conditions for survivors of all cancer sites, across all age
groups. The range of those experiencing diabetes was 22% to 29%
of survivors, with little variation between age groups (Table 2).
Compared with noncancer controls of similar age groups, a
perceptibly larger proportion of survivors experienced CHF,
COPD, and diabetes. For example, among adults 66–84 years

 without cancer, 9% to 14% experienced COPD, compared with
17% to21% of survivors of all sites ages66–84years. Although the
difference between survivors and noncancer controls was less
pronounced when assessing presence of CHF and diabetes, a
general pattern across age groups was still present that suggested
slightly higher prevalence of these conditions among survivors of
all sites compared with other adults without cancer history of
similar ages (Table 2). However, it should be noted that breast/
prostate cancer survivors were the exception to this pattern,
presenting similar prevalence of CHF, COPD, and diabetes as
noncancer controls.
Discussion
Although the aging of the U.S. population has long been
recognized as a major contributor to the cancer burden
(28, 29), this report provides a discrete and previously unde-
scribed view of the cancer prevalence exclusively among age-
related subgroups of older adults projected to 2040. Current
U.S. demographics will literally change the face of the survivor
population in the decades to come. In a prior prevalence report
(3), the population of U.S. cancer survivors was estimated
at 13.7 million (2012). In 2016, we estimate that there are

 15.5 million U.S. cancer survivors, a number that will continue
to rise. Currently, we estimate that almost 40% of men age 90
years and older are cancer survivors, out of a total population
of 765,660 American men in that age group. Similarly, we
estimate that 25% of women age 90 years and older, out of a
total population of 1,739,100, are cancer survivors. It can be
inferred that higher cancer prevalence in elderly men is due to
prostate cancer, which is typically diagnosed in men at older
ages. Furthermore, our projections portend a steady increase
in cancer prevalence by age, wherein the oldest adults (i.e.,
85 years and older) are expected to have the sharpest increase
in prevalence looking from 1975 forward to 2040, compared
with other age groups. Similar, but slightly less dramatic pro-
jected increases, will also occur among adults between 65–74
and 74–85 years, underscoring the need to focus on adults who
are (or are soon to become) Medicare-eligible as priority
populations for cancer prevention and control research.
Despite their numbers, older adults continue to be under-
studied, a point emphasized by the Institute of Medicine in
addressing challenges in delivery quality cancer care (4). Cancer
patients older than age 65 have been largely excluded from
clinical trials (30), precluding opportunities to develop greater
insight about the unique needs of older as well as long-term
survivors. Recent studies have demonstrated variability of
physical and psychosocial conditions for older adults as they
exceed age 65, differences which may be amplified in cancer
survivors (31–33). Clinicians are increasingly recognizing the
benefits of a geriatric assessment framework, including oppor-
tunities for personalized medicine in geriatric oncology (8, 34).
Greater participation by elderly survivors in clinical trials could
provide more clarity in optimal dosing of chemotherapeutic
agents, potentially reducing treatment-related toxicity for elder-
ly cancer patients among other benefits for health and well-
being into long-term survivorship (34).
On the basis of our data, more than 60% of survivors ages 85
and older had at least one comorbid condition before a cancer
diagnosis and between 37% and 49% had more severe comor-
bidity burden, based on weighted scores. However, because we
only included comorbidities identified by Charlson and collea-
gues, common conditions that affect the elderly (such as hyper-
tension, arthritis, atrial fibrillation, chronic ischemic coronary
artery disease, and thromboembolic disease) are not reflected
and our report of comorbidity prevalence may in fact be an
underestimate of actual comorbidity burden in older survivors.
Clinicians may also not code for all comorbidities an older patient
may experience, further increasing the likelihood of an underes-
timate of actual comorbidity burden. Importantly, we did not see
a large difference between comorbidity burden in older adults of
similar age groups when stratified on cancer history. However, we
did observe that survivorship experiences with comorbidity varied
by cancer site, such that lung cancer survivors had the highest
comorbidity burden before diagnosis across age groups and
breast/prostate cancer survivors had some of the lowest comor-
bidity burden before diagnosis across age groups. We also
observed small, but notable differences in CHF, COPD, and
diabetes, suggesting slightly higher prevalence of these conditions
in cancer survivors of all sites compared with noncancer controls,
with the exception of breast/prostate cancer survivors, who were
similar to noncancer controls. Longitudinal assessment of comor-
bidity burden (including differences by age and cancer site) would
be informative in future research studies.
These findings have several implications. First, cancer survi-
vors, like adults in the general population, are at risk for
diseases associated with aging and lifestyle. Lifestyle counsel-
ing, including physical activity, may be important to reduce
cancer-related symptoms, as symptom burden may impede an
active lifestyle after treatment (35, 36). In addition, evidence
suggests that comorbidities identified before a cancer diagnosis
are important predictors of function and health status in the
posttreatment period, potentially offering an opportunity to
focus on rehabilitation to reduce these negative sequelae
(26, 37). Furthermore, our findings relative to comorbidity
patterns point to the need to consider more systematic screen-
ing for functional risk and broader delivery of supportive
interventions, including rehabilitation, to vulnerable sub-
groups (such as lung cancer survivors) to help increase their
ability to live through and beyond cancer treatment (38, 39).
However, among the challenges in addressing the needs of the
growing survivor population is the looming question of cost of
care and caregiving capacity.
With anticipated shortages of oncology providers (4), and
the complex health needs of older patients, finding efficient and
effective ways to meet the medical surveillance needs of older
survivors will become increasingly important (5, 7, 40, 41). The
role of primary care providers may become even more critical in
recognizing and managing late and long-term effects of treat-
ment (42) as well as broader morbidity and mortality risk (43).
At the same time, determining which survivors could be appro-
priately served in a primary care setting, versus a more oncol-
ogy-driven model, are questions of particular interest (44, 45).
Moving forward, research and education will be needed to
facilitate care coordination between oncology and primary care
providers.
As part of caregiving considerations, understanding the
impact on family and other informal caregivers will also be
required. Efforts to address the health and functional needs of
informal caregivers (sometimes viewed as 'secondary' survi-
vors) are critically needed as their numbers and burden of care
(including financial burden) will likely increase in step with the
prevalent cancer population (46, 47). In addition to increasing
burden of care, informal caregivers may also become progres-
sively more involved with medical decisions. In a recent report,
the National Alliance on Caregiving estimated that 73% of
caregivers over the age of 75 years communicate with health
care professionals on behalf of their care recipient, making
them an important part of the medical team (48). Efforts will
be needed to address the capacity of informal cancer caregivers
to support care recipients as well as mitigate the potential
adverse effects of caregiving demands on their own health and
function (47, 49).
Although this report provides timely insights on burden of
cancer in older adults, we acknowledge several limitations of
our analysis. Data from SEER cancer registries and Medicare
claims only include data from specific regions that participate
in the registry, and thus are not nationally representative.
Furthermore, to generate our prevalence estimates, we held
incidence and survival constant. In reality, incidence has been
declining slowly and steadily for most cancers, and survival, in
turn, has increased. It is possible that these trends may balance
each other (i.e., fewer cancer cases, but longer survival). A shift
in either of these trends over the long term could result in our
estimates being an over- or underestimation of the true figures.

 However, the U.S. Census Bureau provides the best available
population projections to estimate the future number of cancer
survivors in the United States.
Because it is difficult to anticipate future developments in
cancer control technologies and their impact on survival and
incidence trends, we produced future prevalence estimates
based on projections assuming flat incidence and survival.
These projections represent the effect of the growth and aging
of the U.S. population based on current cancer control strat-
egies. Overall cancer incidence decreased for men 1.8% annu-
ally from 2007 to 2011 and incidence was stable for women
from 1998 to 2011 (21). Cancer survival has been increasing
for most cancer sites in the most recent years (5-year relative
survival for patients diagnosed in 2002–2004 with any cancer
was 67% compared with 69% for patients diagnosed in 2005–
2011; ref. 17). Compared with previous reports (1, 3), preva-
lence projections incorporating recent trends in survival and
incidence are similar, assuming flat trends. In addition, comor-
bidity measures were based on a claims algorithm and Medicare
data and do not include information about the role of comor-
bidity on functional status, which may be helpful in interpret-
ing the burden of illness and quality of life. Finally, although
we were able to estimate current prevalence of comorbidity in
adult cancer survivors using data from the year before cancer
diagnosis, few data are available to examine comorbidity bur-
den in long-term cancer survivors. This represents a significant
gap in our current knowledge base.
Conclusions and Impact
This report clearly demonstrates a rising tide of cancer preva-
lence, stimulated by the maturation of the baby boomers, as well
as marked heterogeneity in comorbidity burden that is more
pronounced in the oldest age groups. The overall message con-
tinues to be that cancer survivors are a diverse population, with
needs that vary by age as well as cancer site and other factors.
We hope, however, that the data presented here will lend urgency
to previous calls to action (4, 50), particularly for the complex
needs of older survivors. Although a number of interventions
have been developed to help survivors cope with cancer and
thrive in the face of cancer-related symptoms, few have targeted
older adults and this remains an area of critical need in survivor-
ship science (51). Importantly, effective strategies must be imple-
mented now to address the tsunami of aging cancer survivors
that is rapidly approaching.
