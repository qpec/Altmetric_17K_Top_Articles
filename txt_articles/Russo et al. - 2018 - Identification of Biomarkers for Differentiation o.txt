ABSTRACT
A hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) pathotype is undergoing
global dissemination. In contrast to the usual health care-associated epidemiology of
classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) infections, hvKp causes tissue-invasive infections in
otherwise healthy individuals from the community, often involving multiple sites.
An accurate test to identify hvKp strains is needed for improved patient care and
epidemiologic studies. To fill this knowledge gap, clinical criteria or random
blood isolates from North American and United Kingdom strain collections were
used to assemble hvKp-rich (n � 85) and cKp-rich (n � 90) strain cohorts, re-
spectively. The isolates were then assessed for multiple candidate biomarkers hy-
pothesized to accurately differentiate the two cohorts. The genes peg-344, iroB,
iucA, plasmid-borne rmpA gene (prmpA), and prmpA2 all demonstrated �0.95 di-
agnostic accuracy for identifying strains in the hvKp-rich cohort. Next, to validate
this epidemiological analysis, all strains were assessed experimentally in a murine
sepsis model. peg-344, iroB, iucA, prmpA, and prmpA2 were all associated with a
hazard ratio of �25 for severe illness or death, additionally supporting their utility
for identifying hvKp strains. Quantitative siderophore production of �30 �g/ml also
strongly predicted strains as members of the hvKp-rich cohort (accuracy, 0.96) and
exhibited a hazard ratio of 31.7 for severe illness or death. The string test, a widely
used marker for hvKp strains, performed less well, achieving an accuracy of only
0.90. Last, using the most accurate biomarkers to define hvKp, prevalence stud-
ies were performed on two Western strain collections. These data strongly sup-
port the utility of several laboratory markers for identifying hvKp strains with a
high degree of accuracy.

urrently, most infections due to Klebsiella pneumoniae in North America and Europe
are due to classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) strains and occur primarily in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities. cKp strains are of increasing clinical relevance due to their
propensity for acquiring plasmids containing numerous antimicrobial resistance deter-
minants, which makes treatment challenging (1–3).
In the mid-1980s and 1990s, reports from Taiwan described a unique clinical syndrome
of community-acquired, tissue-invasive K. pneumoniae infection in otherwise healthy indi-
viduals that often presented in multiple sites or subsequently spread (metastatic
spread) (4, 5). These cases included pyogenic liver abscess in the absence of biliary tract
disease, abscesses at nonhepatic sites, pneumonia, endophthalmitis, meningitis, and
necrotizing fasciitis (6, 7). To distinguish this pathotype from cKp, the designation
hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) has been used, and an increasing number of such
cases are being reported worldwide (7–9).
Reports on putative hvKp infection have primarily used clinical features and/or a
positive string test (using an inoculation loop to generate a viscous string �5 mm in
length from a bacterial colony) (10) as the case definition. However, the correspon-
dence between the string test and clinical features observed with hvKp infection is
variable, from as low as 51% (11) to 79% (6), 90% (12), and 95% (13) and up to 98% (10).
Conversely, among putative cKp isolates positive string test rates of 17% and 23% have
been reported (10, 13). This poor specificity is especially problematic in low-prevalence
areas.
Clinical criteria to identify hvKp strains and the associated infections also are
problematical. A conservative clinical definition that requires the occurrence of a
community-acquired, tissue-invasive infection in an otherwise healthy host precludes
recognition of hvKp infection in patients who are immunocompromised or in a health
care setting and is inapplicable to strain collections that lack clinical data. An accurate
diagnostic test that can differentiate between hvKp and cKp strains is needed for
optimal clinical care and infection control efforts, epidemiological surveillance for hvKp
infections and the associated antimicrobial resistance trends, and diverse other re-
search studies (e.g., to define patient cohorts for treatment trials or studies to deter-
mine if there is a genetic susceptibility to hvKp infection).
To date, most putative hvKp strains, as defined primarily by a positive string
test, have been antimicrobial susceptible (7). However, the acquisition of extensive or
pan-antimicrobial resistance has the potential to create the ultimate superbug. This was
accomplished experimentally by the introduction of a K. pneumoniae carbapenemase
(KPC)-producing plasmid into an hvKp strain (14) and is now being observed in the
clinical venue, with hvKp acquiring genes that encode extended-spectrum �-lactamases
and carbapenemases (15–18). Further, an extensively drug resistant (XDR) cKp strain
that acquired part of an hvKp virulence plasmid caused a lethal nosocomial outbreak
(19).
The hypervirulence of hvKp strains is mediated, in part, by genes on a large virulence
plasmid (19–22) or within chromosomal islands (23). We hypothesized that some of
these genes (and/or their associated phenotypes) would be accurate markers for hvKp
strains. Therefore, we evaluated several genotypic and phenotypic biomarkers for their
ability to accurately differentiate putative hvKp from cKp strains (based on an epide-
miological analysis and experimental virulence in a murine infection model) and
identified several such markers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Development of hvKp-rich and cKp-rich strain cohorts. To identify a biomarker to differentiate
hvKp from cKp strains, we chose to use clinical data to develop strain cohorts for evaluation, given that
the inclusion of any bacterial genotypic or phenotypic information in the definition of strain cohorts
could introduce bias.
The criterion for inclusion of a strain in the hvKp-rich cohort was isolation from a healthy, ambulatory
patient with a clinical syndrome of tissue-invasive infection (e.g., hepatic and extrahepatic abscesses,
necrotizing fasciitis, or endophthalmitis). The hvKp-rich cohort consisted of 85 strains isolated from
deidentified patients from Taiwan and the United States (Table 1). The probable primary infections
(number of cases) were hepatic abscess (76), necrotizing fasciitis (3), urinary tract infection (2), pneu-

 monia (1), endophthalmitis (1), tonsillar abscess (1), and osteomyelitis (1). Two or more additional sites
of infection were documented in 53% (45/85) of cases; these included (number of cases) endophthalmitis
(13), meningitis (6), brain abscess (4), necrotizing fasciitis (10), pneumonia/empyema (5), epidural abscess
(1), splenic abscess (1), psoas abscess (1), testicular abscess (1), osteomyelitis (4), and renal abscess (1).
Since most K. pneumoniae infections in North America and the United Kingdom presumably are due
to cKp strains, the cKp-rich strain cohort (n � 90) was generated from randomly chosen, deidentified
blood isolates from (number per site) Montreal, Canada (40), Buffalo, NY (25), and Oxford, United
Kingdom (25) (Table 1). Blood isolates were chosen since such strains were likely to represent the more
virulent extreme of the pathogenesis spectrum. However, since information regarding clinical manifes-
tations and host characteristics was unavailable, a limitation of this cohort is the potential presence of
hvKp strains.

 Genotypic biomarkers chosen for evaluation. Study isolates were assessed for the presence of 10
genes and markers for capsule types. These included several genes located on the virulence plasmid,
which have been shown experimentally to contribute to hypervirulence in in vivo infection models,
namely, iucA (aerobactin siderophore biosynthesis), the plasmid-borne rmpA gene (prmpA), prmpA2, and
the chromosomal gene rmpA (crmpA) (regulators of the mucoid phenotype via increased capsule
production), and peg-344 (putative transporter) (24–27). Also included were genes associated epidemi-
ologically with putative hvKp strains, namely, terB (tellurite resistance), iroB (salmochelin siderophore
biosynthesis), and irp2 (yersiniabactin siderophore biosynthesis) (22, 28–30). The virulence plasmid-
located genes peg-1631 (hypothetical protein) and peg-589 (putative carboxymuconolactone decarbox-
ylase family) were studied. Capsular types K1, K2, K5, K20, K54, and K57, which have been considered
markers for hvKp strains (7, 12), also were assessed.
Phenotypic biomarkers chosen for study. Two hypothetically discriminatory phenotypic traits were
evaluated. These included (i) the string test, due to its wide range of reported sensitivity and specificity
values and its lack of rigorous assessment using well-defined strain cohorts, and (ii) qualitative and
quantitative siderophore production, due to suspected greater siderophore production by hvKp strains
than by cKp strains because they synthesize aerobactin (27), which contributes to hypervirulence (26).
PCR assays for biomarkers. PCR-based detection of the K1, K2, K5, K20, K54, and K57 capsule types
was performed as described previously (4, 31). PCR-based detection of the other candidate biomarker
genes used (per reaction) 5 �l of 2� TaqFrogga Mix (Frogga Bio, North York, Canada), 0.75 �l of forward
primer, 0.75 �l of reverse primer (20 pmol/�l primer stock), 1 �l of genomic DNA (50 ng/�l), and 2.5 �l
of water. PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR system 9700 instrument with
the following cycling conditions: step 1, 95.0°
C for 2 min; step 2, 95.0°
C for 30 s; step 3, primer-specific
annealing temperature for 30 s; step 4, 72°
C for 1 min; step 5, repeat steps 2 to 4 for 24 cycles; step 6,
72.0°
C for 10 min; step 7, hold at 4°
C. PCRs were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. As part of the initial
development of PCR assays for biomarkers, amplification products were confirmed to contain the correct
DNA sequence. Subsequently, a gene was considered present if the band of the predicted size was
detected. Specific primers, PCR conditions, and product sizes are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental
material.
Siderophore assays. For the qualitative plate siderophore production assay, Kings B agar plates
containing chrome azurol S dye (CAS) were prepared as described previously (32). Cells of each test strain
were lifted from an overnight-growth agar plate using a 10-�l pipette tip, stabbed into the Kings B agar,
and incubated at 37°
C. After overnight growth, formation of an opaque golden-yellow zone around the
colony indicted high-level siderophore production (Fig. S1).
For the qualitative solution siderophore production assay, test strains were grown individually
overnight at 37°
C in M9 iron-chelated M9 minimal medium containing Casamino Acids (c-M9-CA) (24).
After centrifugation, supernatant was harvested, and an aliquot was diluted 5-fold in c-M9-CA. Equal
volumes of the diluted supernatant and a 98% siderophore assay solution (27) were placed into a well
in a flat-bottom 96-well plate. After incubation in the dark for 30 min, development of an orange
appearance was scored as positive, and no change in the baseline purple/blue appearance was scored
as negative (Fig. S2).
For the quantitative siderophore production assay, which also used culture supernatants from strains
grown in c-M9-CA medium, methods were as described previously (27).
Murine sepsis model. The murine sepsis model was as described previously (26, 33). Animal studies
were reviewed and approved by the University at Buffalo, State University of New York (SUNY), and the
Veterans Administration Institutional Animal Care Committee. This study was done in strict accordance
with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals endorsed by the National
Institutes of Health (34), and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. In brief, outbred male CD1 mice
(18 to 22 g; n � 5 per group) were injected subcutaneously with various titers of the bacterial strains
being assessed. Animals were monitored for up to 14 days for the development of the study endpoint,
severe illness (in extremis state), or death, which was recorded as a dichotomous variable. For the
hvKp-rich strain cohort, a challenge inoculum of 2 � 103 to 5 � 103 CFU was initially used for all strains,
with sequential challenges of 3 � 105 to 5 � 105 CFU and 3 � 107 to 6 � 107 CFU if all animals in the
group survived a given challenge inoculum. For the cKp-rich cohort a challenge inoculum of 2 � 103 to
5 � 103 CFU was initially used for all strains, with sequential challenges of 3 � 105 to 5 � 105 CFU for
some strains and 3 � 107 to 6 � 107 CFU for all strains if all animals in the group survived a given
challenge inoculum.
Statistical analysis. The associations of the dichotomous genotypic and phenotypic biomarkers with
strain cohort were examined by logistic regression and were described using the odds ratios (ORs) and
the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The performance of the binary genotypic and
phenotypic biomarkers in distinguishing between the hvKp-rich and cKp-rich cohorts was summarized
by the marker’s estimated diagnostic accuracy (number of correctly identified cases divided by the total
number of cases), sensitivity, and specificity. Combinations of biomarkers were examined using receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves to identify the best classifier. The dose level (103, 105, or 107 CFU)
needed to induce severe illness or death as a function of phenotypic and genotypic biomarkers was
modeled using a proportional odds model (35). If no deaths occurred with the 107 CFU dose, the
observation was considered censored at that dose level. The hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95%
confidence interval were estimated in the univariate modeling. A stepwise model was used to assess
combinations of factors associated with severe illness or death by dose levels. The predictive value of the
single continuous variable (quantitative siderophore production) was examined using an ROC curve with
the estimated diagnostic accuracy given by the area under the ROC curve.

 RESULTS
Multiple biomarkers, including peg-344, iroB, iucA, prmpA, and prmpA2, differ-
entiate the hvKp-rich and cKp-rich strain cohorts with high accuracy. This epide-
miological analysis relied on clinical syndromes observed in infected humans to define
the strain cohorts that were compared to identify discriminating biomarkers. Five of
these biomarkers, all of which were genes, achieved a diagnostic accuracy of �0.95 for
differentiating the hvKp-rich and cKp-rich strain cohorts, as follows: peg-344 (accuracy,
0.97, sensitivity, 0.99, and specificity 0.96), iroB (accuracy, 0.97; sensitivity, 0.98; speci-
ficity, 0.96), iucA (accuracy, 0.96; sensitivity, 0.99; specificity, 0.94), prmpA (accuracy, 0.96;
sensitivity, 0.98; specificity, 0.93), and prmpA2 (accuracy, 0.95; sensitivity, 0.93; specificity
0.97). In contrast, none of the studied phenotypic tests achieved a �0.95 accuracy; the
qualitative siderophore solution assay had the best performance characteristics (accu-
racy, 0.93; sensitivity, 0.91; specificity, 0.96) (Tables 2; see also Table S2 in the supple-
mental material). The string test, which is widely used as a marker for hvKp strains,
performed less well, achieving an accuracy of only 0.90 (sensitivity, 0.89; specificity,
0.91), as did the combination of the K1, K2, K5, K20, K54, and K57 capsule types
(accuracy, 0.90; sensitivity, 0.93, specificity 0.88). Stepwise multivariate regression anal-
ysis indicated that the combination of peg-344 and iucA marginally increased accuracy
to 0.98 (sensitivity, 0.94; specificity, 1.0). Biomarker data for individual strains and
hvKp-rich and cKp-rich strain cohort totals are listed in Table S2.
Multiple biomarkers, including peg-344, iroB, iucA, prmpA, prmpA2, and peg-
589, accurately predict mortality in a murine sepsis model. Although murine
infection models mimic human infections imperfectly, it is logical to expect that hvKp
strains would be more lethal for mice than cKp strains. Therefore, all strains were
assessed in a systemic infection model, with severe illness or death used as the endpoint.
The probability that a given biomarker was associated with death in a challenge
inoculum (dose)-dependent fashion was calculated.

 Although the rank order differed slightly, the results of this analysis concurred
closely with those of the epidemiological analysis. That is, seven biomarkers (six genes
and one phenotypic trait) were associated individually with a �25-fold-greater likeli-
hood of severe illness or death. These traits (and the associated HR) included peg-344
(64.0), iroB (59.2), prmpA (41.0), peg-589 (40.9), iucA (35.8), a qualitative solution sidero-
phore production assay (33.6), and prmpA2 (31.2) (Table 3 and Fig. 1A). Based on
stepwise multivariate regression, no two-marker combination outperformed peg-344
for predicting severe illness or death. Thus, these markers strongly predict a hyperviru-
lent phenotype, additionally supporting their utility for identifying hvKp strains.
Quantitative siderophore levels are highly predictive of both epidemiological
and experimental virulence. Quantitative siderophore production, the single contin-
uous variable studied, was examined using an ROC curve. According to ROC curve
analysis and box plots (Fig. 2A and B), a quantitative siderophore concentration of �30
�g/ml strongly predicted membership in the hvKp-rich strain cohort (accuracy, 0.96;
sensitivity, 0.96; specificity, 0.94). Similarly, in the murine sepsis model, siderophore
concentrations of �30 �g/ml were associated with an HR of 31.7 for severe illness or
death, compared to strains with concentrations of �30 �g/ml (Fig. 1B).
Prevalence of hvKp in K. pneumoniae blood isolates from Canada and the
United Kingdom. The prevalence of hvKp as defined by the presence of the four most
accurate biomarkers (peg-344, iroB, iucA, and prmpA) was assessed among 179 K.
pneumoniae blood isolates (110 from Montreal, Canada, isolated from March 2009 to
February 2013, and 69 from Oxford, United Kingdom, isolated from January 2008 to
April 2011). The lack of associated clinical data enabled an unbiased assessment. Using
these criteria, the prevalences of hvKp were 0.9% (1/110) and 5.8% (4/69) among the
Montreal and Oxford isolates, respectively. All of these strains were assessed experi-
mentally for virulence in the murine sepsis model and caused severe illness or death
with a challenge dose of only 103 CFU.
DISCUSSION
This study used epidemiological and experimental lines of evidence to identify
several laboratory markers for identifying hvKp strains with a high degree of accuracy.
The epidemiological analysis compared clinically defined hvKp-rich and cKp-rich strain
cohorts for the presence of selected biomarkers. peg-344, iroB, iucA, prmpA, and prmpA2
all identified an isolate to be a member of the hvKp-rich strain cohort with an accuracy
of �0.95. The second line of evidence compared clinically defined hvKp-rich and

 cKp-rich strain cohorts in a murine sepsis model in which hvKp strains were predicted
to be more lethal than cKp strains. peg-344, iroB, iucA, prmpA, and prmpA2 were all
associated with a hazard ratio of �25 for severe illness or death, additionally supporting
their utility for identifying hvKp strains.
These findings are predicted to be generalizable. Although most isolates in the
hvKp-rich strain cohort were from Taiwanese patients, 22% were from patients in
diverse U.S. locations. Further, the hvKp-rich strain cohort (n � 85) consisted of capsule
types representative of putative hvKp strains, including K1 (47 strains, or 55%), K2 (17,
or 20%), K5 (4, or 5%), K20 (4, or 5%), K54 (7, or 8%), K57 (2, or 2%), and undefined (4,
or 4%) (36).
The high degree of accuracy demonstrated for several genetic biomarkers is unsur-
prising since these genes likely are linked on the hvKp virulence plasmid, which is
responsible, at least in part, for the hypervirulent phenotype. The advantage of genetic
biomarkers is that a rapid nucleic acid amplification test can be developed and, if FDA
approved, can be utilized by many clinical laboratories for patient care. Currently,
peg-344 appears to be hvKp specific and, therefore, has potential utility as a rapid
diagnostic test.
Our screen for peg-344, iroB, iucA, and prmpA documented a low prevalence of hvKp

extremis state) or death. (A) Mice challenged with strains that possessed peg-344 had a 64-fold increase
in the hazard ratio of severe illness or death compared to the levels in strains that did not. (B) Mice

ratio of severe illness or death compared to strains that produced �30 �g/ml.

 strains among K. pneumoniae blood isolates from Montreal, Canada (0.9%), and Oxford,
United Kingdom (5.9%). Animal studies supported the finding that the strains identified
as hvKp were true positives. However, the most recent isolates in these collections were
collected more than 5 years ago. The biomarkers identified in this study can be used to
determine prevalence rates in different geographic locations, sites of infection, and
time periods or even in real time (to identify possible temporal trends).
Another important study finding was that the string test, which currently is used
widely to identify hvKp strains, performed suboptimally. Its accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity of 0.90, 0.89, and 0.91, respectively, were inferior to values for several of the
genotypic biomarkers evaluated and for siderophore production. Our data suggest that
the string test should not be used as a definitive diagnostic test for hvKp, particularly
in low-prevalence areas, where its performance characteristics will lead to substantially
more erroneous classifications than with the other more accurate markers identified in
this study. Quantitative siderophore production, which was a highly accurate predictor,
cannot currently be measured in a straightforward fashion in diagnostic laboratories,
but this could potentially be developed.
The genetic composition of pathogens, particularly the accessory genome, can be
fluid. It would therefore seem logical that the best genetic marker for hvKp strains
would be one that clearly contributes to the hypervirulence phenotype. Here, we

 demonstrated that total siderophore production strongly correlated with in vivo viru-
lence (Fig. 2). Aerobactin has previously been shown to be the dominant siderophore
produced by hvKp strains (26, 27) and to be the critical siderophore that enhances
virulence ex vivo and in vivo (26). Since aerobactin is a critical mediator of virulence, it
is likely to be a durable biomarker among hvKp strains. We found iucA, one of the genes
in the iuc operon encoding aerobactin, to be one of the most accurate genetic markers
for differentiating between hvKp and cKp strains; it may therefore represent a stable
genetic marker. Further, the addition of peg-344 to iucA increased accuracy to 0.98.
Differentiation of hvKp from cKp strains could significantly impact patient care and
lead to improved outcomes. Specifically, accurate identification of hvKp would allow
more rapid consideration of possible unrecognized sites of infection, which often
manifest as occult abscesses (37). Such infectious foci are likely to require drainage,
extended antimicrobial therapy, and, potentially, site-directed treatment (e.g., with
meningitis, brain or prostatic abscesses, or endophthalmitis [vitrectomy or intravitreal
antibiotics]) (5). Since the hypermucoviscosity of hvKp interferes with definitive percu-
taneous drainage by clogging the catheter (38), identification of hvKp could alert the
clinician to consider using a larger-gauge catheter and more frequent catheter irriga-
tion. The association of hvKp with relapse (39–42), perhaps due to its hypermucovis-
cous phenotype and biofilm formation (43), suggests that hvKp infections may require
prolonged treatment to maximize cure rates and minimize relapse. The ability to
differentiate cKp from hvKp would enable the generation of controlled data to address
this and other clinical issues.
We along with others (41) have established that close contacts of infected patients
may also be colonized by the infecting hvKp strain, subsequently leading to infection.
Presently, it is unclear whether empirical prophylactic therapy (as recommended for
invasive meningococcal disease [44]), prophylaxis of colonized individuals (either of
which may select for antimicrobial-resistant strains and negatively impact outcome), or
observation alone is the most appropriate course of action. However, the availability of
a test that can reliably identify hvKp would facilitate studies designed to fill this
knowledge gap.
The ability to accurately identify hvKp also would facilitate epidemiologic surveil-
lance by researchers or public health laboratories. Antimicrobial resistance in hvKp
strains is increasingly prevalent (14, 16), and molecular epidemiologic studies are
needed to track the global spread of hvKp strains and emerging resistance trends.
Further, although hvKp infections occur in all ethnic groups, even those infections that
are acquired in Western countries commonly involve Asians and, to a lesser degree,
Hispanics (8). A discriminating test for hvKp is needed to more accurately define
high-risk host groups and could be used for genetic investigations of host suscep-
tibility.
This study has some limitations. First, the hvKp-rich cohort was limited to isolates
from healthy, community-dwelling ambulatory patients, whereas patients with comor-
bidities, compromised immunity, barrier breakdown (e.g., wounds, endotracheal tubes,
or intravascular devices), and health care contact also can develop hvKp infection (19).
Nonetheless, our findings are likely to be applicable also to patients with health
care-associated hvKp infection. Second, the study population is relatively small for
diagnostic test validation. However, the predictive power of the best markers was
extraordinarily strong. This is likely due to the identified biomarkers’ linkage on a
virulence plasmid or chromosomal virulence island that endows K. pneumoniae with
the hypervirulent phenotype. Third, the studied hvKp-rich and cKp-rich strains cohorts
were contaminated by a few misclassified strains; the clinical criteria used to define
hvKp-rich cohort was imperfect due to an absence of standardization, and other than
blood isolates, clinical data were unavailable for the cKp-rich strain cohort. A post hoc
analysis supported this consideration and suggested that the estimated accuracy of
biomarkers was likely an underestimate due to the presence of some probable cKp
strains within the hvKp-rich cohort (strains hvKp77 and hvKp78) and of hvKp strains
present within the cKp-rich cohort (strains cKp17, cKp18, cKp57, and cKp62) based on

 the presence or absence of biomarkers and their performance in the murine sepsis
model (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Last, all clinical tests need to be
interpreted within the context of pretest probability. In low-prevalence regions, the
absence of the most accurate biomarkers identified in this study would effectively
rule out that an isolate is hypervirulent. However, a positive result might overpredict
hypervirulence and could require additional support. Nonetheless, from a clinical
vantage point, it would be desirable to overcall an isolate as hypervirulent.
In summary, this study identified several biomarkers that are highly accurate in
identifying hvKp strains, as defined both epidemiologically and experimentally based
on clinically defined strain cohorts and experimentally in a murine sepsis model. These
markers should enable a variety of important epidemiologic surveillance studies on the
prevalence of hvKp in various populations and on emerging antimicrobial resistance,
which could limit treatment options. Additionally, rapid recognition of hvKp in the
clinical setting has the potential to improve patient care. Further validation of these
differentiating markers should be undertaken in well-characterized patient cohorts with
a larger number of strains.
