Although, a number of pathogenic mutations have been found for Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
only one protective mutation has been identified so far in humans. Here we identify possible
protective deletion mutations in the 3′-UTR of the amyloid precursor protein (App) gene in
mice. We use an App knock-in mouse model carrying a humanized Aβ sequence and three
AD mutations in the endogenous App gene. Genome editing of the model zygotes using
multiple combinations of CRISPR/Cas9 tools produces genetically mosaic animals with
various App 3′-UTR deletions. Depending on the editing efficiency, the 3′-UTR disruption
mitigates the Aβ pathology development through transcriptional and translational regulation
of APP expression. Notably, an App knock-in mouse with a 34-bp deletion in a 52-bp reg-
ulatory element adjacent to the stop codon shows a substantial reduction in Aβ pathology.
Further functional characterization of the identified element should provide deeper under-
standing of the pathogenic mechanisms of AD.

 A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenera-
tive disorder, which is pathologically characterized by
deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ), as well as
hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation. Aβ is a 38–43 amino acid
peptide produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) through
processing by two different proteases, β-secretase and γ-secretase.
Genetic analyses of familial AD (FAD) provide fundamental
evidence that Aβ accumulation plays a central role in AD
pathogenesis1. Over 300 pathogenic mutations in the App gene or
presenilin gene, encoding a catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, have
been found to cause FAD through increased Aβ production and/
or a change in the ratio of aggregation-prone Aβ species2. In
contrast to the pathogenic mutations, only one protective muta-
tion, which slows or prevents the onset or progression of AD
pathology, has been identified to date. A previous human geno-
mic study with a set of whole-genome sequence data from 1,795
Icelanders revealed that a missense mutation (p.A673T) on the
App gene has a protective effect against the onset of AD, possibly
via reducing the levels of amyloidogenic peptides3,4. However,
subsequent replication studies failed to reproduce the protective
effects of the variant due to its rarity5,6, underscoring the diffi-
culty of exploring protective mutations by random screening
based on a large human dataset. To facilitate the identification of
protective mutations that occur infrequently or do not occur
naturally in the human population, targeted screening based on
relevant animal models of AD is necessary.
We recently established single-App knock-in model mice car-
rying a humanized Aβ sequence, as well as two or three clinically
causative mutations in the endogenous murine App gene7,8.
Generating these mice, we unexpectedly found that App knock-in
mice lacking the last two introns (intron 16, 17) and 3′-UTR did
not display Aβ deposition or deleterious effects at any ages due to
a substantial reduction in APP expression at both the transcrip-
tional and translational levels (Supplementary Fig. 1). The results
led us to predict that these regions in the App gene affect Aβ
accumulation via alteration of APP expression.
To test this theory, we here focused our attention on the App
3′-UTR because the sequence is highly conserved between mice
and humans. We performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome
editing in App knock-in mouse zygotes in order to directly delete
the App 3′-UTR. Subsequent quantitative Aβ measurements, as
well as APP expression analyses in the 6-month-old edited model
mice provided that deletion of the App 3′-UTR mitigated Aβ
accumulation in the brain through the reduction of APP
expression levels. Further experiments using another combination
of genome editing tools enabled us to narrow down a possible
responsible element in the App 3′-UTR. Our results suggest that
targeted screening strategy based on relevant AD models would
be useful for the identification of novel protective AD mutations.
Results
Generation of the App knock-in mice with App 3′-UTR dele-
tion. First, we explored whether disruption of the endogenous App
3′-UTR prevents Aβ accumulation in our AD mouse model. To
this end, we deleted ~700-bp of the 891-bp App 3′-UTR
in the mouse model zygotes using CRISPR/Cas9 technology
(Fig. 1a, b)9,10. We selected an App knock-in mouse line (NL-G-F)7
as a suitable model for the following reasons: the genome editing
technology cannot be applied to the conventional APP-Tg mice
because they overexpress APP in a multicopy manner and
because they fail to possess App non-coding regions that regulate
transcription and translation of the gene. We designed a pair of
CRISPR/Cas9 tools to delete the App locus between the two target
sites (Fig. 1a). After checking the editing efficiency in culture cells,
the CRISPR/Cas9 tools were injected into NL-G-F mouse zygotes
(Supplementary Table 2). Two weeks after the birth of mice, we
performed PCR-based genotyping using tail genomic DNA.
Simultaneous genome editing revealed that cleaved fragments of
the 3′-UTR could be detected in 14 founder mice (named as NL-
G-F ΔUTR) out of 49 live-born pups (Supplementary Table 2). To
exclude the possibility of heterogeneous genotypes among the
tissues in the founder mice, as shown in previous studies11,12, we

 also performed PCR-based genotyping using NL-G-F ΔUTR
mouse brains. Deleted fragments could be distinguished from
parental band by agarose electrophoresis. Based on the intensity
of the deleted fragments, we calculated the deletion efficiency of
each sample (Fig. 1c; 0.2–74%). The deletion efficiency correlated
well between the tail and brain samples. The exact sequences of
deleted fragments were then identified using Sanger sequencing
(Fig. 1d). We excluded one mouse (#12) with coding sequence
deletion from the founder candidates. In parallel, we performed
off-target analyses using Sanger sequencing on seven potential
sites in the 14 NL-G-F ΔUTR, and could not find any off-target
mutations in the founder mice (Supplementary Table 3).
Deletion of App 3′-UTR mitigated Aβ pathology in the App
knock-in mice. Next, we explored whether 3′-UTR deletion of
App has inhibitory effects on Aβ accumulation. To this end, we
performed immunohistochemical analyses of 6-month-old NL-G-
F ΔUTR brains with anti-Aβ antibody, and found a drastic
reduction of Aβ accumulation in several samples with highly
disrupted App 3′-UTR (Fig. 2a, b). Notably, the 70% deleted
sample displayed a significant reduction of Aβ accumulation
which contrasted with the wide distribution of Aβ deposition
found in the unedited 6-month-old NL-G-F mice (Fig. 2a). On the
other hand, no clear differences in Aβ accumulation were
observed between unedited NL-G-F mice and the 6% deleted
sample (Fig. 2a). Consistent with these results, the deletion effi-
ciency inversely correlated with Aβ accumulation in NL-G-F
ΔUTR cortex (Fig. 2b), hippocampus and subcortical regions
(Supplementary Fig. 2). We also checked the glial response in the
NL-G-F ΔUTR cortex, and found a substantial reduction of the

(Supplementary Fig. 3). To clarify the underlying mechanisms of
the observed reduction in Aβ deposition, we performed real-time
PCR analyses to quantify total RNA in samples from 6-month-
old NL-G-F ΔUTR cortexes. GAPDH-normalized APP mRNA
expression levels positively correlated with Aβ accumulation in
NL-G-F ΔUTR mice (Supplementary Fig. 4). We also validated
the correlation at the protein level: APP protein expression levels

levels.

 deleted fragments of the 3′-UTR were detected in 14 founder
mice (named NL-G-F Δ400) out of 62 live-born pups (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2). We excluded three
mice with relatively large insertions or inverted sequence from the
founder candidates. Consistent with the results for the NL-G-F
ΔUTR mice, subsequent ELISA of 6-month-old NL-G-F Δ400
cortexes showed a clear inverse correlation between Aβ levels and
the deletion efficiencies (Fig. 2i). We also found the positive
correlation between Aβ accumulation and APP expression
(Fig. 2j). The clear negative correlation between APP mRNA
expression and genome editing efficiency in wild-type Δ400
cortex further confirmed the presence of regulatory elements of
APP expression (Supplementary Fig. 7).
52-bp element is possible sequence counteracting Aβ pathol-
ogy. Previous in vitro and cell culture experiments identified
several regulatory elements within the corresponding 400-bp
region of the human homologue13,14. Of them, a 52-bp element
adjacent to a stop codon on the last exon of the App gene seemed
to play an important role in APP mRNA stabilization. Impor-
tantly, the 52-bp element is highly conserved between mice and
humans (Fig. 3a), although it remains unclear whether the 52-bp
element has the same role in mouse brain in vivo. To narrow
down the responsible elements on the App 3′-UTR, we injected
another combination of CRISPR tools to cut out an ~100-bp
region, including the 52-bp element, into NL-G-F mouse zygotes
(Fig. 3b). Two weeks after birth of the mice, we performed PCR-
based genotyping using tail genomic DNA, and identified the
founder candidates with deleted fragments (Supplementary
Table 2). Based on the Sanger sequencing results, we excluded
two mice with relatively large insertions from the founder can-
didates. We also performed PCR-based genotyping with the brain
genomic DNA, and calculated the deletion efficiency (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8). To determine the deleted sequences of nine
founder mice (named NL-G-F Δ100), we performed TA cloning
with the PCR-amplified DNA fragments derived from each
founder mouse brain. We randomly picked up ~10 colonies for
each founder, and then performed colony sequencing. Expectedly,
~100-bp region of App 3′-UTR were deleted in seven out of nine
founders (Supplementary Fig. 9). Immunohistochemical analyses
with anti-Aβ antibody were performed using tissue from
6-month-old NL-G-F Δ100 mice and un-injected control NL-G-F
mice, and their Aβ pathology was compared. Among the nine
founders, one founder (#3) showed a clear reduction in Aβ plaque
area (Fig. 3c). Subsequent colony sequencing of the relevant brain
sample revealed that a bi-allelic 34-bp deletion within the 52-bp
element had occurred in that founder (Fig. 3d). To validate the
immunohistochemistry result, we used an ELISA assay to quan-
titatively detect the alteration of Aβ levels in the CRISPR-injected
founder mice, and found a substantial reduction of cortex Aβ
levels in founder #3 (Fig. 3e). Importantly, the bi-allelic 34-bp
deletion resulted in a substantial but not complete reduction in
APP expression (Fig. 3f, g), possibly excluding unintended side
effects derived from complete APP deficiency15,16 because het-
erozygous and homozygous App knock-out mice exhibit no and
little abnormality, respectively, due to the functional redundancy
of the APP family17. These results strongly support the previous
results obtained from human cell culture experiments, and sug-
gest that the 34-bp deletion could be used as a protective muta-
tion to counteract the pathological changes in FAD. Although
several other NL-G-F Δ100 mice also showed decreased Aβ levels
(Supplementary Fig. 10) with somewhat reduced APP expression
(Supplementary Fig. 11), no negative correlation was observed
between the deletion efficiency and Aβ levels or APP expression
levels. However, it was difficult to conclude that the 100-bp
disruption did not affect Aβ accumulation through the regulation
of APP expression due to the relatively low-deletion efficiency
(10–30%) (Supplementary Fig. 8), as well as the genetic mosai-
cism of the NL-G-F Δ100 mice (Supplementary Fig. 9). Further
investigations using the heterozygous or homozygous mutant
offspring with various deletion mutations could lead to the in vivo
identification of the responsible elements.
Discussion
With the rapid progress of sequencing technologies, genetic
variations affecting the risk of AD has been directly explored in
the human population. Although such random screening using
the large human dataset has been successful with the identifica-
tion of some critical genetic variants3,18,19, it is still challenging to
extract lower frequency mutations. In fact, the allele frequencies
of the identified variants are much higher than those of all genetic
variants within the 52-bp element on App 3′-UTR in the general
population from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)20
and the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 12). Moreover, the conventional screening strategy
is not applicable to the identification of variants that do not occur
naturally in the human population. To complement the random
screening based on a large human dataset, we utilized genome
editing-based targeted screening focusing on the App 3′-UTR for
exploration of protective deletion mutations. As shown in this
study, combination of CRISPR/Cas9 technology with the relevant
App knock-in mouse model might allow direct evaluation of the
protective effects derived from deletion mutations on Aβ
deposition.
A large number of clinical trials have already been undertaken
or are ongoing, but to date, no effective medications are available
for AD. Given that AD affects ~34 million individuals world-
wide21, there is an urgent need to develop strategies that take a
new approach to preventing AD. Apart from AD, several loss-of-
function variants, which occur naturally in the human popula-
tion, have been identified as protective mutations against incur-
able conditions: e.g., a 32-bp deletion mutation on the CCR5
coding region for HIV infection22, and a 13-bp deletion mutation
on the HBG1 promoter for hemoglobinopathies23. Utilizing this
knowledge of protective mutations, ex vivo or in vivo genome
editing strategies targeting the endogenous genes are becoming
possible treatment options for these diseases24–26. The identifi-
cation of a deletion mutation on CCR5 has also resulted in the
development of an effective antiretroviral antagonist-based ther-
apeutic approach27,28. In a similar fashion, the identification of
novel protective mutations could provide new opportunities for
the development of a novel therapeutic application for AD.
Methods
Animal use and care. We used 6-month-old CRISPR-injected App knock-in
mice7, as well as unedited control model mice (C57BL/6). Both male and female
mice were used. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with
standard guidelines for animal experiments of RIKEN Center for Brain Science.
Preparation of Cas9 and sgRNAs. We constructed the plasmid vector px330
(Addgene #42230) expressing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) as well as Cas9. The
px330 plasmid9 was a gift from Feng Zhang, and the sgRNA was designed in silico
via the CRISPR Design tool29 or sgRNA designer30. For in vitro synthesis of Cas9
mRNA, plasmid vector pCAG-T3-hCAS-pA (Addgene #48625) was linearized by
SphI, then transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in
the presence of Ribo m7G Cap Analog (Promega) as described previously31.
pCAG-T3-hCAS-pA was a gift from Wataru Fujii & Kunihiko Naito. sgRNAs were
synthesized in vitro as previously described32 using a MEGAshortscript T7 kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Synthesized RNAs were purified
using a MEGAclear kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All sequences of oligonucleo-
tides for sgRNA synthesis are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

 Microinjections into mouse embryos. The Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs were
injected into C57BL/6 mouse zygotes or NL-G-F mouse zygotes using a micro-
injection system under standard conditions (as detailed in Supplementary Table 2).
The injected zygotes were cultured in culture medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 up to
two-cell embryos, and then the embryos were transferred into the oviduct of the
recipient mice.
Genotyping analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from tail biopsies using a
standard ethanol precipitation method. Genomic DNA from brain samples was
isolated using TRIzol (Ambion) reagent according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Genomic DNA was amplified using a specific primer set to identify founder
mice with App 3′-UTR deletion (Supplementary Table 1). PCR products that were
~100 bp or smaller than parental band were defined as deleted fragments. Intensity
of the deleted band and intact parental band was quantified using ImageJ, and the
deletion efficiency of each sample was represented as the ratio of the deleted band
intensity to total band intensity (i.e., deleted band intensity plus parental band
intensity). Sequencing analysis was used to further determine the mouse genotype.
Off-target analysis. Potential off-target sites with up to 3 bp mismatches were
identified in silico using COSMID33. Target fragments on the off-target site were
amplified using specific primer sets (Supplementary Table 3), and then sequencing
analyses were carried out to detect mutations.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical staining against Aβ (N1D,
1:200)34 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:100; MAB3402; Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany) was performed in 6-month-old NL-G-F mice. Paraffin-
embedded mouse brain sections were immunostained as previously described7.
Briefly, after deparaffinization, antigen retrieval was performed by autoclave
treatment (121 °C for 5 min). The sections were rinsed several times, blocked for
30 min, and then incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution overnight.
A biotinylated secondary antibody and tyramide signal amplification (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA) were used for detection of amyloid pathology. A secondary
antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was
used for detection of astrocytosis. Photographic data were captured using a
NanoZoomer Digital Pathology C9600 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu,
Japan). Immunoreactive areas were quantified using Tissue Studio software
(Definiens, Cambridge, MA, USA). To reduce the effect of variation between tissue
sections, we used the average of data from 3 to 5 sections per mouse.
Quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from mouse cortex using TRIzol
reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1 µg
aliquots) was converted to cDNA by ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and
oligo (dT) primer. The resultant cDNA was diluted to 1:50 and the diluted solution
was used as a sample. The quantitative PCR was performed using real-time PCR
master mix (Toyobo) and specific TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for mouse APP (Mm01344172_m1) and
GAPDH (Mm99999915_g1). The ABI 7900HT system (Applied Biosystems) was
used for amplification and detection. Relative expression was calculated by using
the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method. The relative mRNA levels were
normalized to endogenous ACTB or GAPDH mRNA expression for each sample.
The CT value was obtained from the amplification plot with the aid of SDS
software.
Northern blotting analysis. Total RNA was isolated from mouse cortex using and
Micro-Fast Track 2.0 kit (invitrogen). RNA samples (6 μg) were separated in 1%
formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes. The membranes
were reacted with isotope labeled cDNA fragment generated by PCR. The mem-
branes were reprobed with an β-actin cDNA. cDNA fragments were amplified
using specific primer sets: APP forward 5′-ATGTGCAGAATGGAAAGT-3′ and
APP reverse 5′-CAGCATACAAACTCTACC-3′, β-actin forward 5′-TCAT-
GAAGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGT-3′ and β-actin reverse 5′-CTTA-
GAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-3′.
Western blotting analysis. Mouse cortexes were homogenized in 50 mM Tris-
HCl (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor cocktail complete mini (Roche Diag-
nostics) (homogenizing buffer). After centrifugation at 1200×g, the supernatant
was centrifuged at 200,000×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was collected
and then solubilized with homogenizing buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 60
min on ice and centrifuged again at 200,000×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants
served as protein samples for further analyses to detect APP protein expression.
Protein samples (20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to
PVDF membranes. After incubating with 2% ECL blocking reagent, the mem-
branes were incubated with the N-terminal APP antibody (1:2000; 22C11, Milli-
pore) or the C-terminal APP antibody (1:10,000; SIGMA, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 4
°C overnight. Then, the membranes were repeatedly washed and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies (1:5000; GE health-
care, Little Chalfont, UK). The band intensity was determined with a densitometer
(LAS4000, Fujifilm). Each set of experiments was repeated twice. Results were the
mean of the multiple experiments. APP expression levels in CRISPR-injected NL-
G-F mouse brains were normalized with those in three or four unedited NL-G-F
mouse brains. Normalized APP expression levels correlated well between the
experiments with two distinct APP antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 13). Some of
the membranes were reprobed with the Syntaxin 1B rabbit polyclonal antibody
(1:10,000; Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The quantitation of Aβ levels in
6-month-old NL-G-F mice was performed as previously described35. Briefly, mouse
cortexes were homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 150 mM NaCl
and the protease inhibitor cocktail (TBS) with a Teflon-glass homogenizer. After
centrifugation at 200,000×g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and
defined as the soluble fraction (TS fraction). The pellet was dissolved in 6 M
guanidine–HCl buffer containing the protease inhibitor cocktail. The solubilized
pellet was centrifuged at 200,000×g for 20 min at room temperature and then used
as the insoluble fraction (GuHCl fraction). The amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in each
fraction were determined by Aβ ELISA kit (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Results were the mean of duplicate
determinations. Because all Aβ peptides in NL-G-F mouse brains contain the Arctic
mutation within the peptide sequence, the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were quantified
based on standard curves using synthetic human Arctic Aβ peptides (Peptide
Institute, Osaka, Japan)7. Aβ levels in CRISPR-injected NL-G-F mouse brains were
normalized with those in three or four unedited NL-G-F mouse brains.
Statistical analyses. The data were first analyzed for normal distribution. When
normally distributed, the variables were statistically analyzed using two-tailed
Pearson’s correlation coefficient. If the data did not pass normality testing,
Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used. All analyses were completed with
Statcel 3 (add-in software for Excel, Microsoft), and values of P < 0.05 were con-
sidered to be statistically significant.
