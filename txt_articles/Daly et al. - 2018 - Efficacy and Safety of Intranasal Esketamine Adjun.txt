IMPORTANCE Approximately one-third of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do
not respond to available antidepressants.
OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy, safety, and dose-response of intranasal esketamine
hydrochloride in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This phase 2, double-blind, doubly randomized,
delayed-start, placebo-controlled study was conducted in multiple outpatient referral centers
from January 28, 2014, to September 25, 2015. The study consisted of 4 phases: (1) screening, (2)
double-blind treatment (days 1-15), composed of two 1-week periods, (3) optional open-label
treatment (days 15-74), and (4) posttreatment follow-up (8 weeks). One hundred twenty-six
adults with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD and history of inadequate response to 2 or more
antidepressants (ie, TRD) were screened, 67 were randomized, and 60 completed both
double-blind periods. Intent-to-treat analysis was used in evaluation of the findings.
INTERVENTIONS In period 1, participants were randomized (3:1:1:1) to placebo (n = 33),
esketamine 28 mg (n = 11), 56 mg (n = 11), or 84 mg (n = 12) twice weekly. In period 2, 28
placebo-treated participants with moderate-to-severe symptoms were rerandomized (1:1:1:1) to 1
of the 4 treatment arms; those with mild symptoms continued receiving placebo. Participants
continued their existing antidepressant treatment during the study. During the open-label phase,
dosing frequency was reduced from twice weekly to weekly, and then to every 2 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to
day 8 (each period) in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.
RESULTS Sixty-seven participants (38 women, mean [SD] age, 44.7 [10.0] years) were
included in the efficacy and safety analyses. Change (least squares mean [SE] difference vs
placebo) in MADRS total score (both periods combined) in all 3 esketamine groups was
superior to placebo (esketamine 28 mg: −4.2 [2.09], P = .02; 56 mg: −6.3 [2.07], P = .001; 84
mg: −9.0 [2.13], P < .001), with a significant ascending dose-response relationship (P < .001).
Improvement in depressive symptoms appeared to be sustained (−7.2 [1.84]) despite reduced
dosing frequency in the open-label phase. Three of 56 (5%) esketamine-treated participants
during the double-blind phase vs none receiving placebo and 1 of 57 participants (2%) during
the open-label phase had adverse events that led to study discontinuation (1 event each of
syncope, headache, dissociative syndrome, and ectopic pregnancy).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this first clinical study to date of intranasal esketamine for
TRD, antidepressant effect was rapid in onset and dose related. Response appeared to persist
for more than 2 months with a lower dosing frequency. Results support further investigation
in larger trials.

 M
ajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and dis-
abling illness, with a lifetime prevalence of approxi-
mately 20% in the United States.1,2 Major depres-
sive disorder impairs socio-occupational functioning3 and
increases suicide risk,4 adverse sequelae of other common co-
morbid medical conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease, type
2 diabetes, and obesity), and mortality.5-9 Limitations of cur-
rently available antidepressant therapies include delayed on-
set of efficacy and low remission rates after multiple courses
of pharmacotherapy.10
Research on mood disorder pathophysiology implicated
abnormalities in glutamatergic transmission, along with syn-
aptic and dendritic atrophy, in neural circuits that modulate
emotional behavior.11 Several studies have shown antidepres-
sant efficacy with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) recep-
tor antagonist, ketamine.12-17 One limitation of ketamine for
treating depression is that it may require intravenous admin-
istration, reducing its applicability in outpatient settings.
Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, has a higher
affinity for the NMDA receptor than the R-enantiomer18 and
is being developed as an intranasal formulation for therapy in
treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Rapid onset of antide-
pressant effects has been observed following intravenous ad-
ministration of esketamine.19 We report findings from a study
of intranasal esketamine, assessing its efficacy and safety com-
pared with placebo in individuals with TRD.
Methods
Population
The study enrolled medically stable (based on physical ex-
amination, medical history, vital signs, and 12-lead electro-
cardiogram performed at screening) adults (aged 20-64 years)
with a diagnosis of MDD, according to the DSM-IV-TR.20
All participants had TRD, defined as inadequate response
to 2 or more antidepressants (assessed by Massachusetts Gen-
eral Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response
Questionnaire21),withatleast1inadequateresponseinthecur-
rent depression episode. Otherwise, an antidepressant fail-
ure from a prior episode was acceptable. All participants con-
tinued the antidepressants they were receiving at study entry
during the trial. At screening and before the dose on day 1, eli-
gible participants had a score of 34 or more on the 30-item, cli-
nician-ratedInventoryofDepressiveSymptomatology,22,23cor-
responding to moderate to severe depression. Key exclusion
criteria included recent or current suicidal ideation with in-
tent to act, suicidal behavior, or homicidal ideation or intent,
diagnosis of bipolar or related disorders, intellectual disabil-
ity, psychotic disorder, MDD with psychosis, posttraumatic
stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance/
alcohol use disorders in the past year, and recent use of can-
nabis (more inclusion/exclusion criteria reported in the eAp-
pendix in Supplement 1).
Independent review boards (United States: Sterling Insti-
tutional Review Board, University of Pennsylvania Institu-
tional Review Board, Hartford Healthcare Institutional Re-
view Board, and Western Institutional Review Board) and an
independent ethics committee (Belgium: Ethisch Comité O.L.
Vrouwenziekenhuis) approved the study protocol and amend-
ments. The study was conducted in accordance with ethical
principlesthathavetheiroriginintheDeclarationofHelsinki,24
consistent with Good Clinical Practices and applicable regu-
latory requirements. All individuals provided written in-
formed consent before participating in the study. Financial
compensation was provided.
Design
This phase 2, 2-panel, double-blind, doubly randomized,
delayed-start,25-28 placebo-controlled study (a variant of se-
quential parallel comparison design27-36) was conducted from
January 28, 2014, to September 25, 2015. In panel A, reported
herein, 14 study sites (13 in the United States, 1 in Belgium) en-
rolled participants. The study protocol is available in
Supplement 2.
The study consisted of 4 phases: (1) screening; (2) double-
blind treatment (days 1-15), composed of two 1-week periods
(period 1, period 2); (3) optional open-label treatment (days 15-
74) with tapering of intranasal dosing frequency; and (4) post-
treatment follow-up (8 weeks). Based on prior studies of ket-
amine in which efficacy was reported after 1 to 2 doses, the
duration of each period in the double-blind phase was 1 week,
during which time it was expected that efficacy could be
achieved.Thisdesignallowedevaluationofthedose(s)needed
to proceed to evaluation in phase 3. The purpose of the open-
label, flexible-dose phase was to evaluate the effect of less-
frequent dosing on sustaining efficacy.
At the beginning of double-blind period 1, eligible par-
ticipants were randomized (3:1:1:1) to intranasal placebo or
esketamine 28, 56, or 84 mg, twice weekly (days 1 and 4)
based on the first of 2 computer-generated randomization
schedules (period 1 and period 2). Randomization was bal-
anced by using randomly permuted blocks and stratified by
study center. At the end of period 1, those randomized to
placebo who had moderate to severe symptoms (assessed
by t h e 1 6 - it e m Q u i c k I nve nt o r y o f D e p r e s s ive
Symptomatology-Self Report23,37 [QIDS-SR16] total score:

intranasal esketamine 28, 56, or 84 mg or placebo twice
Key Points
Question Is intranasal esketamine hydrochloride an efficacious
treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant
depression?
Findings In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial of 67 adults
with treatment-resistant depression, significant improvement of
depressive symptoms, assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg
Depression Rating Scale total score, was observed after 1 week
with intranasal esketamine, 28 to 84 mg administered twice
weekly, with a significant ascending dose-response relationship.
Improvement appeared to be sustained with reduced dosing
frequency for up to 9 weeks.
Meaning Results of this first clinical trial of intranasal esketamine
for treatment-resistant depression support study in larger trials.

 weekly (days 8 and 11); those having mild or no symptoms
continued placebo. To maintain the blinding, all partici-
pants completed an identical process before entry into
period 2, whether or not they were rerandomized. Regard-
less of response in the double-blind phase, all participants
were eligible to enter the optional open-label phase. Esket-
amine, 56 mg, was administered on the first day of the
open-label phase (study day 15); subsequent doses could be
adjusted (range, 28-84 mg) based on the investigator’
s clini-
cal judgment, with administration twice weekly for the first
2 weeks, weekly for the next 3 weeks, then every 2 weeks
thereafter.
Study Drug and Administration
Study drug was provided in a disposable nasal spray device
containing 200 μL of solution (ie, 2 sprays). Each device
delivered either esketamine hydrochloride, 16.14 (14 mg of
esketamine base) per 100-μL spray or placebo. To maintain
blinding, the placebo solution (intranasal solution of water
for injection) had a bittering agent (denatonium benzoate)
added to simulate the taste of esketamine intranasal solu-
tion. As described above, the antidepressant that partici-
pants had been receiving immediately before study entry
was continued unchanged.
On each dosing day during the double-blind phase, par-
ticipants self-administered 1 spray of study drug (esketamine
or placebo) into each nostril at 3 points, each separated by 5
minutes. In the open-label phase, depending on the dose se-
lected,participantsself-administered1sprayofesketamineinto
each nostril at 1, 2, or 3 points (corresponding to 28, 56, or 84
mg, respectively), each separated by 5 minutes.
Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy was assessed with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depres-
sion Rating Scale38,39 (MADRS) on days 1 (predose and 2
hours postdose), 2, 8 (predose), 9, and 15, using the MADRS
structured interview guide.39
Overall illness severity was assessed on the Clinical Global
Impression of Severity scale.40 Participants assessed their se-
verity of anxiety on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item
scale41 (eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1).
Safety Assessments
Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. Other
safety assessments (ie, laboratory tests, vital signs, physical
examination) were performed at prespecified time points. Vi-
tal signs, the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale
(CADSS),42andthe4-itempositivesymptomsubscalefromthe
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale43 were assessed predose, at 40
minutes, and 2 hours postdose.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy data were analyzed in intent-to-treat analysis sets for
each period and phase. The intent-to-treat analysis sets in-
cluded all participants who received at least 1 dose of study
medication during that period or phase and had baseline and
at least 1 postbaseline MADRS total score within that period
or phase. Safety data were analyzed in period 1, period 2,
double-blind, and open-label data sets for all participants re-
ceiving at least 1 dose of study medication.
Efficacy End Points and Analyses
The primary efficacy end point—change from baseline (pre-
dose, day 1 in each period) to end point (day 8 in each period)
in MADRS total score—was analyzed using the analysis of co-
variance model. For period 1, the model included treatment
and country as factors and baseline MADRS total score as a co-
variate. For period 2, the model included treatment and coun-
try as factors, period 2 baseline QIDS-SR16 score (moderate or
severe), and period 2 baseline MADRS total score as a continu-
ous covariate.
Given the consistency between periods 1 and 2 results,25
esketamine dose groups were compared with placebo using a
combined test on the weighted test statistics for each period
in the double-blind treatment phase. A dose-response analy-
sis on the primary efficacy end point was performed using data
combined from both periods. The multiple comparison pro-
cedure modeling methodology was performed.39,44
Sample Size Determination
Sample size was determined based on the following differ-
ences between intranasal esketamine and placebo for mean
change from baseline in MADRS total score: 9-point treat-
mentdifferencewasassumedforperiod1(day8),7-pointtreat-
ment difference for period 2 (day 15) was assumed for indi-
vidualswithamoderateQIDS-SR16score,and9-pointtreatment
difference for period 2 (day 15) was assumed for individuals
with a severe QIDS-SR16 score.
Based on the results of an intravenous esketamine study,19
it was estimated that 40% of placebo-receiving participants
would have a moderate QIDS-SR16 score and 55% would have
a severe QIDS-SR16 score at the end of period 1 (day 8 pre-
dose). Additional assumptions for the sample size calcula-
tionincludedSDof10,92.5%powerforthecombineddatafrom
day 8 and day 15,45 overall 1-sided significance level of .05, and
5% dropout rate for period 1. It was calculated that this panel
of the doubly randomized, outcome-based design required 60
individuals to be randomly assigned to treatment on day 1 in
a 3:1:1:1 ratio (30 in the placebo group and 10 per intranasal es-
ketaminedosegroup).Statisticalanalysiswasperformedusing
SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Participants
A total of 126 individuals were screened, 67 of whom met the
eligibility criteria and were randomized (38 women, mean [SD]
age, 44.7 [10.0] years). Of 33 participants randomized to pla-
cebo in period 1, 28 (85%) had a QIDS-SR16 score of 11 or higher
at the end of period 1 and thus were randomly reassigned to
esketamine or placebo in period 2 (Figure 1). Most random-
ized participants (63 of 67 [94%]) completed period 1 and the
2-week double-blind phase (ie, periods 1 and 2 combined, 60
of 67 [90%], hereafter termed completers). Of these com-
pleters, 57 entered the open-label phase, with 51 (89%) sub-

 Supplement 1). Forty-three (64%) participants reported only
1 antidepressant treatment failure in the current episode (in
addition to 1 in prior episodes), 15 (22%) had 2 treatment fail-
ures, and 9 (13%) reported 3 or more antidepressant failures.
Twenty-six (39%) participants reported use of atypical anti-
psychotics as an adjunctive treatment of MDD before study en-
try.
Efficacy
The mean MADRS total score decreased from baseline to day
8 in period 1 and from day 8 to day 15 in period 2 in all groups,
with greater improvement in all esketamine dose groups com-
paredwithplacebo(leastsquaresmeandifferencerangingfrom
−5.0 to −10.5 in period 1 and from −3.1 to −6.9 in period 2)
(Table 1). Change from baseline in the MADRS total score was
statisticallysignificantlygreaterinall3esketaminegroupsthan
in the placebo group after 1 week of treatment; the ascending
dose-response relationship also was significant. Response was
rapid in onset (Figure 2; eFigure 1 in Supplement 1) and ap-
peared to increase over time during repeated dosing, as evi-
denced by a decrease in the mean MADRS total score during
the open-label phase (mean [SE] change from open-label base-
line to day 74, −7.2 [1.84]). In addition, improvement in mean
MADRS ratings persisted over the 8-week follow-up phase
(without additional esketamine doses) in participants who re-
mained in the study (Figure 3).
For completers who received 2 weeks of the same treat-
ment in the double-blind phase, the mean decrease in the
MADRS total score was greater in each esketamine dose group
compared with placebo at day 15, with the magnitude of de-
crease directly related to dose (treatment differences relative
to placebo of −12.5, −8.3, and −6.0 for esketamine 84 mg, 56
mg, and 28 mg, respectively). Efficacy appeared to be better
sustained between drug administrations with the 2 higher
doses (Figure 1).
Among those who received the same treatment for both
periods and completed the double-blind phase, the propor-
tion of responders (defined as ≥50% improvement from base-
line in MADRS total score) in each esketamine dose group was
numerically higher than in the placebo group at the period 2
end point (28 mg: 38% [3 of 8], 56 mg: 36% [4 of 11], 84 mg:
50% [5 of 10], and placebo: 10% [1 of 10]). A similar trend for
remission (defined as MADRS total score ≤10) was observed
acrossgroups.Amongcompleterswhoreceivedthesametreat-
ment in both periods, more participants who received the 2
higher esketamine doses compared with placebo achieved re-
mission after 2 weeks of treatment (13% [1 of 8], 27% [3 of 11],
and 40% [4 of 10] in the 28-mg, 56-mg, and 84-mg groups, re-
spectively, and 10% [1 of 10], in the placebo group). Response
and remission rates at the end of the open-label and fol-
low-upphasesarepresentedbytypeoftreatmentinthedouble-
blind and open-label phases in Table 2.
Safety
Three of 56 (5%) esketamine-treated participants during the
double-blind phase (compared with none receiving placebo)
and1of57(2%)duringtheopen-labelphasehadadverseevents
leading to discontinuation of the study drug (1 event each of
syncope, headache, dissociative syndrome, and ectopic preg-
nancy). During the double-blind phase, the 3 most common
treatment-emergent adverse events observed among esket-
amine-treated participants were dizziness, headache, and dis-
sociative symptoms; the frequency of each was more than
2-fold higher for esketamine than for placebo (eTable 4 in
Supplement 1). A dose-response trend was noted for dizzi-
ness and nausea, but not for other adverse events. The type
and frequency of adverse events reported in the open-label
phase were similar to those in the double-blind phase; events
reported for more than 10% of 57 open-label participants in-
cluded dizziness (22 [39%]), dysgeusia (13 [23%]), nausea (9
[16%]), headache (8 [14%]), and sedation (6 [11%]). Overall, 14
of 57 (25%) participants reported transient dissociative symp-
toms. Most adverse events occurring on dosing days were tran-
sient and either mild or moderate in severity. No death was re-
ported.
Most of the esketamine-treated participants manifested
transientelevationsinbloodpressure(maximummeanchange:
systolic, 19.0 mm Hg; diastolic, 10.3 mm Hg) and heart rate
(maximum mean change: 9.4 bpm) on dosing days. Maxi-
mum blood pressure values were observed in most cases at 10
or 40 minutes after the dose (systolic: 199 mm Hg; diastolic:
115 mm Hg); elevated values typically returned to the value ob-
served before dosing by 2 hours after the dose (eFigures 2 and
3 in Supplement 1). A dose effect was not observed for heart
rate, although the greatest mean increases from baseline dur-
ingbothperiodswereobservedinthe84-mgesketaminegroup.
Perceptualchangesand/ordissociativesymptoms,asmea-
sured by the CADSS, began shortly after the start of intranasal
dosing, peaked at approximately 30 to 40 minutes, and re-
solved by 2 hours (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). Perceptual
changes/dissociative symptoms attenuated in all dose groups
with repeated dosing. No participant manifested symptoms
suggestive of psychosis based on the Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale positive assessment.
Discussion
We observed a significant and clinically meaningful treat-
ment effect (vs placebo) with 28-mg, 56-mg, and 84-mg doses
of esketamine, as evidenced by change in the MADRS total
score, with a significant relationship between esketamine dose
and antidepressant response observed after 1 week of treat-
ment. Duration of efficacy appeared to be shorter with the
28-mgdoseadministeredtwiceweekly.Resultsfromtheopen-
label phase suggest that improvement in depressive symp-
toms can be sustained with lower frequency (weekly or every
2 weeks) of esketamine administration. The size of the medi-
cation-placebo difference was substantial from baseline to 1
week and was larger than the mean difference from placebo
seen at 6 to 8 weeks in antidepressant studies in the US Food
and Drug Administration database.46 The majority of partici-
pants maintained improvement over the 2-month follow-up
phase.

 netic range achieved by intravenous administration of esket-
amine, 0.2 mg/kg, which produced a similar clinical outcome
as reported for intravenous ketamine, 0.5 mg/kg (consistent
with higher affinity for NMDA receptors compared with
arketamine47).19
In what we believe to be the first study of intranasal es-
ketamine for TRD, efficacy and safety were compared with pla-
cebo using a double-blind, doubly randomized, delayed-start
design.25 This design allowed for a smaller sample size to as-
sess efficacy, dose-response, and safety than a standard par-

 allel-group design, while preserving a low chance of type 2 er-
ror to avoid missing the efficacy signal. The key aim of the
designwastoincludeonlyplacebo-receivingparticipantsfrom
period 1 who required treatment in period 2 and to rerandom-
ize them to receive 1 of 3 intranasal esketamine doses or in-
tranasal placebo. At the end of the trial, efficacy data from both
randomizations (day 1 and day 8) were combined in an inte-
grated analysis. Given the rerandomized placebo, nonre-
sponders were expected to have a lower placebo response; this
approach was used to mitigate high placebo responses ob-
served in psychiatric clinical trials.25 The consistency in re-
sults obtained from the period 1 and period 2 samples sup-
ports their combination using weights as discussed by Chi
et al,25 although caution is required in interpretation due to
the small sample size.
Ingeneral,theesketaminedosesevaluatedinthisstudy(28,
56, and 84 mg) appeared to be safe, with no new or unexpected
safety concerns observed. Overall, transient increases in blood
pressure after the dose, particularly increases in systolic blood
pressure, support an increase in cardiac output as the underly-
ingmechanism,consistentwithpreviousreportsforketamine.15

Limitations
Generalizability of the study findings is limited by the small
sample size and enrollment criteria that excluded individuals
withahistoryofpsychoticsymptoms,substance/alcoholusedis-
orders,recentuseofcannabis,orsignificantmedicalcomorbidi-
ties.Alsoexcludedwereindividualshavingcurrentsuicidalide-
ation with intent—a group that was evaluated in a separate
study.48Difficultyblindingesketamine,despiteaddingabitter-
ingagenttoplacebotomimicthetasteofesketamine,isanother
limitation.
Conclusions
Intranasal esketamine administered at doses of 28, 56, and
84 mg appeared to be efficacious in treating TRD. There was
evidence of robust and durable efficacy in the double-blind
treatment phase (56 and 84 mg). Improvement in depres-
sive symptoms persisted over the open-label phase, despite
reduced dosing frequency, and for up to 2 months after ces-
sation of esketamine dosing. Results support further inves-
tigation of intranasal efficacy of esketamine for the treat-
ment of TRD in larger trials. A phase 3 study evaluating the
necessary frequency of dosing and duration of effect is
under way.49
