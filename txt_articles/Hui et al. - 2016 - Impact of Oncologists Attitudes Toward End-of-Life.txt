ABSTRACT
Background. It is unclear how oncologists’ attitudes toward
end-of-life (EOL) care affect the delivery of care. The present
studyexaminedtheassociationbetweenoncologists’EOLcare
attitudes and (a) timely specialist palliative care referral, (b)
provision of supportive care, and (c) EOL cancer treatment
decisions.
Methods. We randomly surveyed 240 oncology specialists at
our tertiary care cancer center to assess their attitudes
toward EOL care using a score derived from the Jackson et al.
qualitative conceptual framework (0 5 uncomfortable and
8 5 highly comfortable with EOL care). We determined
the association between this score and clinicians’ report of
specialist palliative care referral, provision of supportive
care, and EOL cancer treatment decisions.
Results. Of the 182 respondents (response rate of 76%), the
median composite EOL care score was 6 (interquartile range,
5–7). A higher EOL score was significantly associated with
solid tumor oncology (median 7 vs. 6 for hematologic on-
cology; p 5 .003), a greater willingness to refer patients with
newly diagnosed cancer to specialist palliative care (median,
7 vs. 6; p 5 .01), greatercomfort with symptom management
(median, 6 vs. 5; p 5 .01), and provision of counseling
(median, 7 vs. 4; p , .001) but not with cancer treatment
decisions. We observed a gradient effect, with higher scores
associated with a greater proportion of patients referred to
palliative care (score 0–4, 27%; 5, 31%; 6, 32%; 7, 35%; and 8,
45%; p 5 .007).
Conclusion. Greater comfort with EOL care was associated
with higher rates of specialist palliative care referral and self-
reported primary palliative care delivery. More support and
educationareneededforoncologistswhoarelesscomfortable

Implications forPractice: In the presentsurveyofoncology specialists, most reported thatthey were comfortable with end-of-life
(EOL) care, which was in turn, associated with greater provision of primary palliative care and higher rates of referral to specialist
palliative care.Theresultsofthe present study highlightthe need formoresupportand education foroncologists less comfortable
with EOL care because their patients might receive lower levels of both primary and secondary palliative care.
INTRODUCTION
From the time of diagnosis, patients with advanced cancer
often experience a significant symptom burden and psycho-
logical distress and desire effective communication to support
complex decision making [1]. Oncologists have a critical role
throughoutthedisease trajectory, providing primary palliative
care in the front line and making appropriate referrals to
interdisciplinary specialist palliative care teams for secondary
and tertiary palliative care [2]. This model of integrated,
collaborative care has been shown to improve patient
outcomes, including quality of life, symptom distress, illness
understanding, satisfaction, and even survival [3, 4]. Oncolo-
gists generally agree that palliative care delivery is one of their
key responsibilities [5]; however, how much primary and
secondarypalliative caretheirpatientsactuallyreceiveislikely
affected by many factors, such as local resource availability,
patient preference, oncologist’s palliative care training, and
their attitudes toward end-of-life (EOL) care [6, 7].
A few studies have examined the attitudes among
oncologists toward EOL care [8, 9]. Jackson et al. conducted a
qualitativestudyof18academic oncologistsandreportedthat
oncologists varied in their approaches to EOL care [8]. In an
accompanyingeditorial,vonGuntenexpandedonthisconcept
and labeled the oncologists as either type I or type II. Type I
oncologists “viewed their role as encompassing both bio-
medicalandpsychosocialaspectsofcancercare[and]reported

 ability to positively influence patient and family coping with
death... In contrast, type II oncologists described primarily a
biomedical role. They reported a more distant relationship
with the patient, a sense of failure at not being able to alter
the course of the disease, and an absence of collegial
support...” [10].
This conceptual framework is appealing because it
highlights a theoretical divide in how oncologists approach
EOL care. However, it is unclear how their attitudes translate
into patient access to palliative care such as referral to
specialist palliative care and the delivery of primary palliative
care, and whether these attitudes affect decision making
regarding cancer treatments at the EOL. A better un-
derstanding of the impact of attitudes toward EOL care on
care delivery would allow us to overcome barriers and
optimize patient care. The primary objective of the present
study wasto determine the association between oncologists’
attitudestowardEOL care and timely specialist palliative care
referral. We also examined the association between these
attitudes and self-reported provision of supportive care, EOL
cancer treatment decisions, and clinician characteristics.We
hypothesized that oncologists who are more “palliphilic”
would be more prepared to refer patients earlier in the
disease trajectory, experience more confidence in delivering
supportive care, and be less likely to recommend intensive
cancer treatments at the EOL.
METHODS
Participants
The present study was a planned analysis of a survey that
examined the EOL care preferences among hematologic and
solid tumor oncology specialists [11]. The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center institutional review board
approved the present study and waived the requirement for
informed consent.
The study method has been described in detail previously
[11, 12]. In brief, we randomly sampled 60 individuals each
from four groups (hematologic oncologists, solid tumor
medical oncologists, hematologic oncology advanced practice
providers, and solid tumor advanced practice providers) in the
Division of Cancer Medicine at The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center to participate in a mail/electronic
survey between May and August 2014. Phase I and general
oncologists were not included.
Attitudes Toward EOL Care
We evaluated the attitudes toward EOL care using a
conceptual framework derived from the qualitative study
by Jackson et al. [8]. Eight survey questions were specifically
designed to capture the main themes derived from grounded
theory: “I feel comfortable discussing prognosis with my
patients”; “I feel comfortable discussing advance care
planning with my patients”; “I feel comfortable discussing
death and dying with my patients”; “I feel comfortable
referring my patients to hospice care”; “I have a close
relationship with my patients and families”; “I derive
satisfaction providing end-of-life care to my dying patients”;
“I receive adequate collegial support caring for my dying
patients”; and “I feel a sense of failure when I am not able to
alter the course of disease.” The choices were “strongly
agree,” “agree,” “neither agree nor disagree,” “disagree,” and
“stronglydisagree.”WedefinedanEOLscoreaprioribasedon
these 8 questions. We assigned 1 point for each statement
answered as “strongly agree” and “agree” (except for the last
statement, for which “strongly disagree” or “disagree” was
given1point).Thetotalscorerangedfrom0to8points,witha
higher score indicating greater comfort toward EOL care.
Outcome Measures
We examined three outcomes (specialist palliative care
referral, self-reported provision of supportive care, and EOL
cancer treatment decisions) by asking respondents to rate
each statement using a 5-point Likert scale (“strongly agree,”
“agree,”“neitheragreenordisagree,”“disagree,”and“strongly
disagree”). As reported previously [12], specialist palliative
carereferralwasevaluatedbyaskingtherespondentswhether
they would use the palliative care service for a patient with
symptoms and (a) newly diagnosed with cancer, (b) un-
dergoingactive primarytreatment forcancer (curative intent),
(c) without evidence of active cancer, (d) receiving active
treatment for advanced cancer (palliative intent), and (e) no
longer receiving cancer treatment.
The provision of supportive care was evaluated by asking
respondents whether they were comfortable providing
symptom management for their patients and whether they
were comfortable providing counselingto their patients [11].
EOL cancer treatment decisions were assessed by asking
whether the respondents were comfortable prescribing
systemic therapies to their advanced cancer patients with
anEasternCooperativeOncologyGroup(ECOG)performance
status of 3 and 4. Respondents were also asked to review
three case vignettes and provide their treatment recommen-
dations. All cases described the same 60-year-old man with
advancedincurablecancerwhohadanexpressedinterestina
treatment with a 15% response rate, moderate toxicity, and
no expected survival gain. The only characteristics that
differed among the three cases were regarding the Eastern
CooperativeOncology Group performance status (4, 3, and 2)
and expected survival (1, 3, and 6 months), respectively [11].
Forthesethreecases,thecliniciansrated theirresponsefrom
1 (strongly against treatment) to 7 (strongly recommend
treatment).
The respondents also provided data on various clini-
cian characteristics, including age group, sex, oncology
specialty, years of clinical experience, and palliative care
training. We also asked them to estimate the percentage
of advanced cancer patients they had referred to palliative
care.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size calculation for the primary objective of the
present study has been previously reported [11, 12]. In a post
hoc sample size calculation with 182 respondents and 33%
answering “Agree” or “Strongly Agree” to the question of
referring patients to palliative care with newly diagnosed
cancer, a Wilcoxon rank sum test would have 80% power
(assuming two-sided 5% a) to detect p 5 .63 versus p 5 .50,
where p is the probability that a randomly chosen EOL score

 value from one group would be greater than a randomly
chosen value from the other group.
We summarized the data using standard descriptive
statistics. We examined several psychometric properties
of the EOL score. Internal consistency was assessed using
the Cronbach a coefficient, in which a value .0.7 suggests
that the score has acceptable reliability. Content validity
was partly established based on the qualitative themes
derived from grounded theory [8]. We assessed the item-
total correlation using the Spearman correlation test. A
moderate to strong correlation (i.e., .0.3) suggests that
an individual item is measuring the same construct as
the total score and thus should be included in the cal-
culation of the total score. We also conducted a known-
group validity analysis with the Mann-Whitney U test by
evaluating whether the EOL score could discriminate
between solid tumor oncologists and hematologic oncol-
ogists, who are known to have different EOL care ap-
proaches [11, 13, 14].
We used the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test
to examine the association between the EOL score and the
outcomes of interest, including specialist palliative care
referral, self-reported provision of supportive care, EOL
cancer treatment decisions, and clinician demographic data.
The outcomes were dichotomized according to our prede-
fined analysis plan (“strongly agree” and “agree” vs.“neither
agree nor disagree,” “disagree,” and “strongly disagree”).
Spearman’s rank correlation was used to examine the
association between the EOL score and treatment prefer-
ences for the case vignettes.
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, http://www.ibm.com) was used. We
considered p , .05 to indicate statistical significance.
RESULTS
Clinician Demographic Data
The response rate was 182 of 240 (76%). We previously
reported the demographic data of the clinicians who
responded to our survey [11]. Most were older than 40 years
(n 5 120; 66%) and women (n 5 123; 68%) and reported a
median of 10 years (interquartile range, 6–17 years) of
postgraduate clinical experience (Table 1). Few reported
having had a clinical palliative care rotation (n 5 36; 20%) or
palliative care fellowship training (n 5 2; 1%).
Attitudes Toward EOL Care and EOL Score
The proportion of respondents who “agreed” or “strongly
agreed” with each of the 8 statements that contributed to the
EOL score ranged from 38% to 90% (Fig. 1A). Figure 1B shows
the skewed distribution of the EOL score, with a median of 6
(interquartile range, 5–7; range, 0–8).
The Cronbach a coefficient was 0.72. The item-total
correlation showed that individual items had moderate
correlation with the total score, ranging from 0.30 to 0.63 (p ,
.0001forallitems;Table2).Theknown-groupvalidityanalysis
showed that hematologic oncology specialists had signifi-
cantly lower EOL scores than the solid tumor specialists
(median, 7 vs. 6; p 5 .003).
Association Between EOL Score and
Clinician Characteristics
The EOL score was not significantly associated with sex,
profession, or palliative care education. Older age was weakly
associated with a higher EOL score (Spearman correlation
coefficient [r] 5 0.17; p 5 .02).
AssociationBetweenEOLScoreandPatternofEOLCare
A willingness to refer patients with newly diagnosed cancer
who were symptomatic to specialist palliative care was
significantly associated with a higher EOL score (median, 7
vs.6;p5.01;Table3).Thisalsoheldtrueregardingthereferral
of patients at other time points along the disease trajectory.
The clinicians with a higher EOL score also reported that they
referred a greater proportion of their own patients with
advanced cancer to palliative care (r 5 0.2; p 5 .007). Figure 2
illustrates a gradient effect across the EOL score categories.
Clinicians who reported they were comfortable with symptom
management (median, 6 vs. 5; p 5 .01) and providing
counseling (median, 7 vs. 4; p , .001) had significantly higher
EOL scores.
A few respondents were comfortable prescribing chemo-
therapy to patients with a poor performance status, and these
individuals also had higher EOL scores compared with those
who were less comfortable (median, 7 vs. 6; p , .05). We did
not find any association between the EOL score and the
propensity to recommend cancer treatment for hypothetical

DISCUSSION
Mostoncology specialists at our comprehensive cancer center
reported they were comfortable with EOL care. A greater
comfort level with EOL care was associated with greater
perceived level of patient access to both primary and
secondary palliative care. Our study highlights the importance
of supporting oncology specialists in delivering palliative care
through education and resources.
The present study is the first study to independently
validate the qualitative findings from Jackson et al. and the
phenotypicdescriptionoftypeIandtypeIIoncologists[8].This
intriguing conceptual framework raises several important
questions: (a) Do most oncologists fall in one group or the
other? (b) Dopatients oftype I oncologists have greateraccess
to primary palliative care and specialist palliative care? (c) Are
type I oncologists less likely to recommend cancer treatments
in the last months of life? To start addressing these questions

 quantitatively, we designed an EOL score that specifically
assessed the attitudes toward EOL care using the conceptual
framework.
Interestingly, instead of a bimodal distribution that would
be expected in a polarized model, the distribution of the EOL
score was skewed toward the right, suggesting that many
oncologyspecialistsatourcancercenterperceivedthemselves
as being more comfortable with the provision of EOL care. Our
results are encouraging because earlier surveys completed
more than a decade ago demonstrated that oncologists were
less comfortable with the delivery of EOL care and reported
limited palliative care training [5, 15, 16]. Conceptually, our
findings suggest that attitudes toward EOL care represent a
spectrum with shades of gray instead of a black and white
phenomenon.The potential implication of this finding isthatit
could be possible to shift attitudes toward the right instead of
having to bridge a greater divide. Similar to satisfaction
research, small shifts in attitudes may translateinto significant
improvements in outcomes [17].
One main research question addressed in the present
study was whether oncologists who were comfortable with
EOL care would refer fewer or more patients to specialist
palliative care. On the one hand, oncologists who have
confidence in their palliative care skills might not feel the need
to refer patients to palliative care, particularly when they
derive satisfaction with the delivery of supportive care [9]; on
the other hand, these oncologists might be more likely to
detect any unmet patient care needs, trust the specialist
palliative care teams, and understand the benefits a referral
can offer. In the present study, we found that oncologists who

palliative care referral at all stages of the disease trajectory,

they also reported that a larger proportion of their own

 withagradienteffectobserved.Ourfindingsareconsistentwith
the observation that palliative oncologists who are dually
trained in oncology and palliative care often refer a high
proportion of their patients to palliative care when practicing
oncology[18].Thisassociationcouldalsohelpexplainthesteady
growth of the palliative care program at our institution [6].
In keeping with the conceptual model and our hypothesis,
oncology specialists who were comfortable with EOL care
were also more likely to report that they were comfortable
with symptom management and provision of counseling.
Further research is needed to assess whether the actual
quantity and quality of supportive care provided is superior
among these oncologists.
In the case vignettes, oncologists’ attitudes toward EOL
care were not associated with the treatment recommenda-
tions.We recently reported that early specialist palliative care
referral was significantly associated with lower rates of
emergency room visits, hospitalization, and intensive care
unit admissions in the last 30 days of life, but not the rates of
chemotherapy or targeted therapy use [19]. Taken together,
these results suggest that the decision-making process
regarding chemotherapy use at the EOL might be a separate
construct from the delivery of palliative care. Further research
is needed to confirm these hypotheses and to identify how
we can support clinical decision making regarding systemic
disease-directed therapy in patients with a limited prognosis.
Wefoundthathematologic oncology specialistsexpressed
lower comfort levels compared with their solid tumor coun-
terparts.Thisisconsistentwithmultiplestudiesdemonstrating
that hematologic oncologists were generally less comfortable
with EOL care [13, 14] and that patients with advanced
hematologic malignancies often have lower access to acute
palliative are and hospice care and more intensive EOL care
[12, 20]. This difference might be related to challenges in
prognostication, difficulty in identifying the EOL period, the
plethora of novel treatment options with curative potential,
and patient preferences [13]. Our results highlight that the
attitudes of hematologic oncologists might also be a contrib-
utor to the decreased access to EOL care.
The main implication of the present study is that comfort
with EOL care is associated with enhanced access to palliative
care. Ironically, oncologists who were less comfortable with
EOLcare,notonlyreporteddeliveringlesssupportivecare,but
also referring fewer patients to specialist palliative care,
resulting in an overall lower access to palliative care.Thus, it is
particularlyimportanttoensurethatoncologyspecialistshave
adequate training and support for the delivery of EOL care and
the supportive environment to build a collaborative relation-
ship with the specialist palliative care team [21]. Given that
many oncology professional organizations are actively pro-
moting more palliative care education for oncologists, our
findings suggest that we might need to increase the palliative
care workforce inanticipation of agreater numberof referrals.
The present study had several limitations. First, the
attitudes toward EOL care were assessed using a score based
on the total number of items instead of a validated scale.
Although this EOL score showed acceptable reliability and
validity in our preliminary analyses, further research is needed
tofullyexamineitspsychometricproperties,suchastest-retest
reliability, predictive validity, and responsiveness. Second, the
EOL score might not be able to fully assess the complexity and
intricacies related to the attitudes toward EOL care.The lackof
differences in some outcomes might have resulted from a
ceiling effect. It was developed using a conceptual framework
and has convergent validity with other outcomes.Third, many
of the outcomes were based on the self-report from clinicians
in the same survey. Further research is required to verify
whether these findings apply in clinical practice. Fourth, we
were only able to demonstrate an association between the
comfort level with EOL care and various outcomes but not
causation. Other confounders such as palliative care training
and personality were not assessed. Finally, the present survey
was conducted at our comprehensive cancer center with an
academic focus and unique clinician characteristics. Future
studies should examine the attitudes toward EOL care in other
institutions.
CONCLUSION
The results of the present study have shown that many
oncologists have a favorable attitude toward EOL care; this, in
turn, was associated with greater provision of primary pallia-
tive care and higher rates of referral to specialist palliative care.
Furthersupportand educationwould behelpfultoimprove the
delivery of EOL care.

Hematologic and Solid Tumor Oncology Specialists. The Oncologist 2015;20:1326–1332.
Implications for Practice:
The present survey ofoncology specialists found that hematologic specialists were less likely than solid tumor specialists to
report that they would refer symptomatic patients with newly diagnosed cancer to palliative care. However, both groups
were significantly more willing to refer patients early in the disease trajectory if the service name “supportive care” were
used instead of “palliative care.” These findings suggestthat rebranding might help to overcome the stigmaassociatedwith
palliative care and improve patient access to palliative care services.
