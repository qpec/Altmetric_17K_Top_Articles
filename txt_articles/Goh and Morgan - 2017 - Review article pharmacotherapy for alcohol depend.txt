SUMMARY
Background
The development of alcohol dependence is associated with significant mor-
bidity and mortality. For the majority of affected people the most appropri-
ate goal, in terms of drinking behaviour, is abstinence from alcohol.
Psychosocial intervention is the mainstay of the treatment but adjuvant
pharmacotherapy is also available and its use recommended.
Aim
To provide an updated analysis of current and potential pharmacotherapeu-
tic options for the management of alcohol dependence. In addition, factors
predictive of therapeutic outcome, including compliance and pharmacoge-
netics, and the current barriers to treatment, including doctors’ unwilling-
ness to prescribe these agents, will be explored.
Methods
Relevant papers were selected for review following extensive, language- and
date-unrestricted, electronic and manual searches of the literature.
Results
Acamprosate and naltrexone have a substantial evidence base for overall
efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness while the risks associated with the use
of disulfiram are well-known and can be minimised with appropriate
patient selection and supervision. Acamprosate can be used safely in
patients with liver disease and in those with comorbid mental health issues
and co-occurring drug-related problems. A number of other agents are
being investigated for potential use for this indication including: baclofen,
topiramate and metadoxine.
Conclusion
Pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence has been shown to be moderately
efficacious with few safety concerns, but it is substantially underutilised.
Concerted efforts must be made to remove the barriers to treatment in
order to optimise the management of people with this condition.

Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics
 BACKGROUND
Alcohol misuse, health and societal costs
Approximately 80% of the adult population in the UK
consume alcohol.1 The majority of people drink respon-
sibly with no associated harmful effects. However, in
England in 2014, 22% of men and 16% of women,
amounting to some 10.3 million adults, consumed alco-
hol in a way that was potentially or actually harmful to
their health and well-being.1 It has been estimated that
5.9% of the adult population in England (8.7% of men
and 3.3% of women) are alcohol dependent.2 Based on
current population estimates this equates to some 3.2
million people, although the figure more frequently
quoted is 1.6 million.3
In 2014/5, there were an estimated 1.1 million alco-
hol-related hospital admission in England, representing a
115% increase over 2003/4.4, 5 A total of 8697 wholly
attributable alcohol-related deaths were registered in the
UK during 2014, two-thirds of which were attributed to
alcohol-related liver disease.6 However, a considerably
higher estimate of 25 332 can be extrapolated from data
provided by Public Health England based on a combina-
tion of all deaths relating to alcohol-specific conditions
together with those where alcohol was causally impli-
cated in some but not all cases.7 The estimated cost of
alcohol misuse to the National Health Service (NHS) is
£3.5 billion per annum, while the overall costs of alco-
hol-related societal harm approximates to £21 billion per
annum.8
In the USA, the proportion of adults consuming alco-
hol is lower than in the UK at 46.3%.9 The 12-month
prevalence of alcohol dependence is estimated to be 3.8%
(men 5.4%; women 2.3%) while the estimated lifetime
prevalence is 12.5% (men 17.4%; women 8.0%).10 Alco-
hol dependence is associated with more than 85 000
deaths per year making it the third leading cause of pre-
ventable deaths in the USA;11 the estimated annual cost
to society is more than $220 billion.12
Alcohol dependence: definitions, diagnosis and
natural history
A proportion of people consuming alcohol at harmful
levels will develop alcohol dependence. This condition
is characterised by craving; tolerance; a pre-occupation
with alcohol; continued drinking in spite of harmful
consequences; and the development of a physiolog-
ical withdrawal syndrome when alcohol is suddenly
stopped or consumption reduced.13 More exact defini-
tions of this condition, which is officially recognised as
a mental health disorder, are provided by the World
Health Organization in the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD)14 and by the American Psychiatric
Association in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM).15 The ICD-10 and DSM-
IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence largely
overlap
and
have
high
diagnostic
concordance
(Table 1).16
The diagnosis of alcohol dependence is usually made
by reviewing the clinical history but this can be impre-
cise if the patient is unaware, or reluctant to reveal the
extent of their problems with alcohol. However, ques-
tionnaires can facilitate the process. The Alcohol Use
Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT),17 for example,
which was developed as a World Health Organization
(WHO) collaborative initiative, is designed to identify
people who have an alcohol use disorder; a score of ≥8
indicates hazardous/harmful drinking while a score of
>16 indicates alcohol dependence.17
Harmful alcohol use and alcohol dependence are rela-
tively uncommon before the age of 15 but, thereafter, the
prevalence increases steeply reaching a peak in the early
twenties before declining. In one UK study, the preva-
lence of alcohol dependence was 6% in 16–19 year olds,
8.2% in 20–24 year olds, 3.6% in 30–34 year olds, and
2.3% in 50–54 year olds.18 Thus, substantial remission
from alcohol dependence can occur, over time, often
without
intervention.19
However,
those
who
remain
dependent in their forties tend to have a more chronic
course; most studies find that 70–80% of people entering
specialist treatment will relapse in the year after complet-
ing treatment, most likely in the first 3 months.20, 21
Those who remain abstinent from alcohol for the first
year after treatment have a relatively low risk of relapse
thereafter.22
The long-term prognosis for people entering specialist
treatment is comparatively poor. Over a 10-year period
about one-third have continuing alcohol problems; a
third show some improvement and a third have a good
outcome defined as either abstinence or moderate drink-
ing.23 The mortality rate in this population is nearly four
times the age-adjusted rate for people who are not alco-
hol
dependent.
Much
of
the
excess
mortality
is
accounted for by disorders associated with comorbid
tobacco use, including, cardiovascular disease and aerodi-
gestive malignancies.23, 24

 (SADQ);25 the information provided can facilitates clini-
cal management.
The initial step in the treatment of alcohol depen-
dence is withdrawal from alcohol. In some, but not all
instances, medical assistance will be required to pre-
vent or to treat the withdrawal symptoms; benzodi-
azepines are the drugs most commonly employed to
facilitate this process.13, 26, 27 Expert guidance on the
withdrawal process, including all aspects of patient
safety and general well-being, is available from the UK
National
Institute
for
Health
and
Care
Excellence
(NICE).13, 26
People
with
mild
dependence
(SADQ
score <15) do not usually need medically-assisted with-
drawal; people with moderate dependence (SADQ 15–
30) usually do need medical assistance, typically in a
community setting;21 while people who are severely
alcohol
dependent
(SADQ
score
>30)
will
require
medically-assisted withdrawal, typically in an in-patient
or residential setting.
Withdrawal management is not a stand-alone process
but should be the first phase of a long-term treatment
plan. For the majority of people who are dependent on
alcohol the most appropriate goal, in terms of alcohol
consumption,
is
total
abstinence.
For
people
with
significant
psychiatric
or
physical
comorbidity,
for
example, a depressive disorder or alcohol-related cirrho-
sis, abstinence should always be the goal. Nevertheless,
some people will not accede to this advice, preferring a
goal of moderation. However, the more severe the level
of dependence the less likely it is that a return to mod-
erate or controlled drinking will be possible.22, 28 Thus,
where a clinician believes that abstinence is the most
appropriate goal they should strongly advise this course,
but should not deny treatment if this advice is not
heeded.21
Psychosocial
intervention
is
the
mainstay
of
the
treatment for alcohol dependence.13 In the UK, NICE
has provided detailed guidance on the provision of
psychosocial support tailored to reflect the severity of
the dependence.13 Services are delivered by both statu-
tory and non-statutory providers and additional sources
of support, such as self-help based interventions, are
encouraged. NICE also recommends the use of adju-
vant pharmacotherapy for people with moderate to
severe dependence once they had been successfully
withdrawn from alcohol.13 They also recommend adju-
vant pharmacotherapy for people with mild depen-
dence
who

Similar

to
the
treatment
of

dependence are employed in Europe,29 the USA,30–32
and Australia.33 The latest French good practice recom-
mendations,29
published
by

d’Alcoologie in partnership with the European Federa-
tion of Addiction Societies, recommend the use of phar-
macological
treatments,

with
psychosocial
support, for relapse prevention in patients with alcohol
dependence.29
Likewise,
in
the
USA,
the
Veterans
Administration (VA),30 National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA),31 and Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),32
all advocate the use of adjuvant pharmacotherapy, in
combination with behavioural intervention or addiction-
focused counselling, for the management of alcohol
dependence. Finally, the Australian guidelines for the
treatment of alcohol problems33 stipulate that pharma-
cotherapy should be considered for all alcohol-dependent
patients following detoxification – best used in associa-
tion with psychosocial supports as part of an after-care
treatment plan.
In this review, the efficacy and safety of current and
future potential pharmacotheraputic agents for the man-
agement of alcohol dependence will be assessed; their
use in clinical practice will be detailed; factors predictive
of treatment outcomes, including compliance and phar-
macogenetics, will be delineated; and the current barriers
to treatment will be explored.
METHODS
A general literature search was undertaken for articles
on the generic topic ‘treatment of alcohol dependence’.
In addition, a specific language-unrestricted electronic
search was undertaken of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary
Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Library,
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index for
pharmacotherapeutic trials published between 1966 and
October
2016;
this
was
supplemented
by
manual
searches of the bibliographies of relevant papers, spe-
cialist journals, conference proceedings and trial reg-
istries.
RESULTS
Licensed pharmacotherapies for the maintenance of
abstinence
Disulfiram, acamprosate and naltrexone are the only
pharmaceutical agents licensed for the maintenance of
abstinence/relapse prevention in dependent drinkers in
the majority of countries advocating the use of pharma-
cotherapy for the management of alcohol dependence
(Table 2). Nalmefene has recently been licensed, in some
countries, for use in people who are drinking at high risk
levels who wish to reduce their alcohol consumption but
not necessarily abstain.
Disulfiram. Disulfiram has been used in clinical practice
for the last 60 years; the oral preparation is licensed for
relapse prevention in the UK, much of Europe, North
America, Australia and parts of Asia. Despite its appar-
ent efficacy, when used in compliant and/or supervised
patients, overall its use remains controversial.
Mode of action: Alcohol is metabolised in the liver, via
the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, to acetaldehyde and
then to acetate via the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydro-
genase (ALDH). Disulfiram is an oral ALDH inhibitor.
The high levels of acetaldehyde which accumulate follow-
ing alcohol ingestion in people taking disulfiram result in
the development of a constellation of symptoms such as
flushing, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hypotension, dys-
pnoea, dizziness and headache.34 These symptoms appear
approximately 5–15 min after alcohol consumption and
last from 30 min to several hours. The intensity of the
reaction varies with the amount of alcohol consumed and
can prove fatal.35, 36 The fear of the unpleasant effects
provoked by alcohol is believed to be the primary mecha-
nism facilitating abstinence from alcohol.37, 38
Disulfiram has been used in the treatment of cocaine
addiction particularly in people with comorbid alcohol-
related problems.39–41 It inhibits the enzyme dopamine
b-hydroxylase,
which
converts
dopamine
to
nor-
epinephrine, and may reduce cocaine use because it
inhibits the associated noradrenergic-mediated ‘high’.42
Efficacy: There is no consensus on the optimal trial
methodology for assessing the efficacy of disulfiram as a
treatment for alcohol dependence. It has long been held
that it cannot be appraised fairly in double-blind, ran-
domised, clinical trials (RCTs) because the psychological
fear
of
provoking
an
unpleasant
disulfiram-alcohol
reaction is key to its effectiveness.
A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
the available trial data have been undertaken,13, 41, 43, 44
with a degree of consensus on treatment efficacy. The
most comprehensive of these41 included a total of 22
RCTs, published between 1973 and 2010, comparing the
efficacy of disulfiram to no treatment, placebo or other
868

 pharmacological treatments, irrespective of blinding or
supervision of medication. Based on the results of the
open-label studies, where compliance was assured by
supervision, disulfiram is a safe and efficacious treat-
ment compared to no treatment or to other pharmaco-
logical agents.41 However, no evidence of efficacy was
found in blinded RCTs or where there was no supervi-
sion.41
Safety: The side-effects associated with use of disulfiram
include:
headaches,
drowsiness,
lethargy,
peripheral
neuropathy,
optic
neuritis,
hepatotoxicity
and
psy-
chosis.36, 45, 46 In general, the moderately severe side-
effect profile can be offset by careful patient selection and
supervision.
Therapeutic use: There are a number of contra-indica-
tions to the use of disulfiram including: cardiovascular
disease, systemic hypertension, severe personality disor-
der,
suicidal
risk/psychosis,
pregnancy/breast-feeding.
Caution is also advised in the presence of renal failure,
hepatic or respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus and
epilepsy. NICE guidance suggests that disulfiram should
be used as second-line treatment after acamprosate or
naltrexone or if a strong preference for its use is
expressed.13 Treatment should be started at least 24 h
after the last alcoholic drink in a dose of 200 mg per
day; warnings should be provided about the nature and
seriousness of the interaction with ingested alcohol and
the presence of alcohol in foodstuffs, perfumes and
aerosol sprays. Supervision should be sought whenever
possible. Treatment, if successful and relatively free
from side-effects, may be continued long term.
Acamprosate. Acamprosate was introduced into clinical
practice 30 years ago; the oral preparation is licensed for
the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol-dependent peo-
ple in a wide range of countries including the UK, most
of Europe, North America, Australia, parts of Asia and
Africa and, most recently, Japan.

Review: pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence
 Mode of action: Acamprosate is the calcium salt of
N-acetyl-homotaurine.
Its
mechanism
of
action
is
unclear although it has been ascribed to aspects of
glutamatergic and/or GABA-ergic neurotransmission; it
is most frequently referred to as a ‘functional gluta-
mate antagonist’.47 Recently, however, it has been sug-
gested that acamprosate has no direct neurotransmitter
target and that the therapeutic effects associated with
its use are due to the co-administered calcium moi-
ety.48, 49 These findings have yet to be substantiated
but the role of plasma and/or brain levels of calcium
as a correlate or mediating factor in relation to the
drug’s efficacy may need to be further explored.49
Efficacy: The results of a large number of RCTs and
meta-analyses13, 44, 50–53 have shown that treatment with
acamprosate, in conjunction with psychosocial support,
significantly increases the proportion of alcohol-depend-
ent patients who remained completely abstinent from
alcohol at 6 months. Mann et al.,50 in a meta-analysis of
17 RCTs, involving 4087 participants, showed that 36.1%
of patients receiving acamprosate achieved this endpoint
compared with 23.4% of those receiving placebo; overall
the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve continu-
ous
abstinence
was
7.8
at
6 months
and
7.5
at
12 months.50
A Cochrane review, including 24 RCTs with 6915 par-
ticipants,51 showed a significant beneficial effect of acam-
prosate on a number of outcome measures other than
abstinence; thus, its use was associated with a reduction
in the return to any drinking with a NNT of nine; a
reduction in the risk of any drinking to 86% of the pla-
cebo rate and an increase in the number of abstinent
days by approximately three per month.51
Safety: Acamprosate is not metabolised in the liver and
has no impact on drugs subject to hepatic metabolism or
those which affect the cytochrome P450 system. Thus, it
does not interact with alcohol and it is generally safe in
patients with impaired hepatic function. However, as it
is excreted predominantly via the kidney, it should be
used with care in people with renal insufficiency. Acam-
prosate is well-tolerated.46 Pharmacovigilance data in 1.5
million patients indicate no serious adverse events;54 the
most commonly reported side-effect is diarrhoea.50 It
does not have addictive potential and appears safe in
overdose.47
Therapeutic
use: Acamprosate
is
contraindicated
in
patients
with
severe
renal
impairment
(creatinine
clearance <30 mL/min) and in those who are hypersens-
itive to the drug or any of its components.
Guidelines in the UK,13 France,29 the USA,30, 31 and
Australia33 recommend that acamprosate is used as first-
line treatment for alcohol dependence. It should be
started as soon as possible after assisted withdrawal from
alcohol in a daily divided dose of 1998 mg in people
weighing >60 kg and of 1332 mg in those weighing
<60 kg.13 There is no need to adjust the dose in people
with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, although dose
adjustment is recommended in people with moderate
renal
impairment.13
Treatment
should
continue
for
6 months or longer in those deriving benefit who wish to
continue; it can be continued if patients lapse but should
be stopped if drinking persists beyond 4–6 weeks.13
Naltrexone. Naltrexone has been used in the manage-
ment of opioid dependence since 1984; it was first used
to treat alcohol dependence in 1994. The oral prepara-
tion is licensed for relapse prevention in alcohol-depend-
ent people in a wide range of countries including the
UK, much of Europe, the USA, Australia and Asia.
Mode of action: Naltrexone and its active metabolite
6b-naltrexol act as opioid receptor antagonists, particu-
larly at the l-opioid receptor. Its excretion is primarily
renal. The mechanism of its beneficial effect in the treat-
ment of alcohol dependence is not fully understood
although it is believed to reduce the reward effects of
alcohol by modulating the dopaminergic mesolimbic
pathway.55, 56
Efficacy: A substantial number of RCTs have been
undertaken to examine the efficacy of naltrexone for the
treatment of alcohol dependence. These have been the
subject of a number of systematic reviews and meta-ana-
lyses employing varying inclusion criteria and drinking
outcomes but, nevertheless, with broadly comparable
results.13, 44, 52, 54, 57–59 Thus, in alcohol-dependent peo-
ple who have been withdrawn from alcohol, naltrexone,
in combination with psychosocial support, has a modest,
albeit significant beneficial effect on relapse rates, and in
reducing alcohol intake.
A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis,
including 40 placebo-controlled RCTs of naltrexone,
involving approximately 4500 participants, showed that
treatment with naltrexone significantly reduced the risk
of a return to heavy drinking to 83% of the placebo rate
with a NNT of nine.58 Treatment was also associated
with a 4% reduction in the number of drinking days; a
870
Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2017; 45: 865–882
ª 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd
E. T. Goh and M. Y. Morgan
 3% reduction in the number of heavy drinking days; and
a reduction in the amount of alcohol consumed, on
drinking days, by about 11 g. It did not, however, have a
significant effect on the return to any drinking.58 The
effect on overall abstinence rates was not determined.
The results of a number of other meta-analyses con-
firm the effects of naltrexone in reducing the risk of a
relapse to heavy drinking and the number of drinks con-
sumed on drinking days;57–59 some found that its use
was, in addition, associated with a significant, albeit
modest effect on the return to any drinking and overall
abstinence rates.57, 59
Safety: Naltrexone is metabolised in the liver via the
enzyme dihydrodiol dehydrogenase predominantly to
6b-naltrexol; the metabolites are further conjugation with
glucuronide. As naltrexone is not metabolised via the
cytochrome P450 system interactions with drugs subject
to hepatic metabolism are likely to be minimal. However,
increased plasma naltrexone concentrations have been
reported in patients with cirrhosis. Naltrexone does not
interact
with
alcohol
and
does
not
have
addictive
potential.
The most commonly reported side-effects are nausea,
vomiting, dizziness, abdominal pain, reduced appetite,
headache and daytime sleepiness; these are dose-depend-
ent and appear to be worse in women.46 Hepatotoxicity
has been reported in association with use of naltrexone
in doses of >300 mg/day to treat obesity.60 However,
reviews of the available safety data have confirmed that
hepatic toxicity is very unlikely to occur with the stan-
dard daily dose of 50 mg.13
The most important safety consideration in relation to
naltrexone is its reaction with opioid drugs. Opioid
receptor blockade persists for 48–72 h after the last oral
dose; thus, in an emergency non-opioid analgesia would
have to be used for pain relief. If future use of opioids is
anticipated, for example, for elective surgery, then nal-
trexone should be discontinued ahead of time.
Therapeutic use: Naltrexone is contraindicated in indi-
viduals taking or likely to take opioids. It is also con-
traindicated in people with acute hepatitis and acute or
chronic liver failure. It should be used with caution in
people with serum transaminase activities exceeding
three times the upper reference range and in patients
with renal failure. At present, there is no consistent
advice about monitoring of liver function tests in people
receiving this drug but NICE guidance recommends that
this should be considered in the elderly and the obese
and that the drug should be discontinued immediately if
the user feels unwell.13
Guidelines in the UK,13 France,29 the USA,30, 31 and
Australia33
recommend
that
naltrexone
should
be
considered as a first-line treatment for alcohol depen-
dence. Opioids should be stopped 7–10 days beforehand
but treatment can be started while patients are still
drinking and during medically-assisted withdrawal from
alcohol. An initial dose of 25 mg/day is recommended
increasing over a period of 2 weeks to a maintenance
dose of 50 mg/day.13 Treatment should be continued for
6 months or longer in those deriving benefit who wish to
continue; it can be continued if patients lapse but should
be stopped if drinking persists beyond 4–6 weeks.13
Combined treatment with acamprosate and naltrex-
one. The effect sizes of acamprosate and naltrexone are
modest and hence the effect of combining the two treat-
ments has been explored.61, 62
Keifer et al.,61 randomised 160 severely dependent
drinkers to acamprosate, naltrexone, acamprosate/nal-
trexone combined or placebo for 12 weeks; all particip-
ants received specific relapse prevention intervention.
Both acamprosate and naltrexone and their combination
had a positive treatment effect relative to placebo; the
naltrexone/acamprosate combination was more effective
than acamprosate alone but comparable in effect to nal-
trexone alone. Anton et al.,62 randomised 1383 much
less severely dependent drinkers to the same four arms
of treatment for 16 weeks; participants were further ran-
domised to receive one of two different types of beha-
vioural therapy. Outcomes improved in all participant
groups but were significantly better in those receiving
naltrexone together with intensive behavioural therapy;
combining treatments had no additional beneficial effect.
Meta-analysis of these two trials confirmed that there
were no significant differences in outcome favouring
combined treatment.13, 58
Co-administration
of
acamprosate
and
naltrexone
results in a 33% increase in the peak plasma concentra-
tions of acamprosate and a reduction in the time to
reach peak plasma levels but has no effect on the phar-
macokinetics of naltrexone. Thus, the incidence of diar-
rhoea and nausea was, as expected, significantly higher
in the combined treatment groups, in both trials.58, 61, 62
Nalmefene. Nalmefene is an opioid system modulator
which is structurally similar to naltrexone but it has a
slightly different receptor profile. It was first introduced

Review: pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence
 dependence in the early 1990s.63–65 However, a meta-
analysis of the three RCTs available from that time,
which utilised daily doses in the 20–80 mg range, showed
that although nalmefene had some beneficial effect on
drinking outcomes none of these was significant.58
Subsequently, the drug was remarketed and licensed,
on the basis of a small number of additional industry-
sponsored initiatives,66–70 for use in people who were
drinking harmfully and wanted to reduce, though not
necessarily stop, their alcohol consumption. However,
this so called ‘harm reduction’ approach to alcohol prob-
lems remain controversial.71 Thus, although several stud-
ies
have
demonstrated
that
controlled
drinking
is
possible and that moderation-based treatments may be
preferred over abstinence-only approaches, the evidence
base for using this approach is not strong.
Nevertheless, in 2013, nalmefene was approved by the
European Medicines Agency as a treatment for alcohol
dependence in people who wish to reduce their alcohol
consumption but not necessarily abstain. It was granted a
licence in Scotland in October 2013. In November 2014,
NICE,72 despite concerns raised by its own Evidence
Review Group,73 recommended nalmefene, taken in a
dose of 18 mg daily, as needed, together with psychosocial
support, as a treatment option for people drinking at high
risk levels who, although alcohol dependent, did not need
medically-assisted withdrawal from alcohol and wished to
reduce rather than stop alcohol. In France, nalmefene is
recommended as the first-line medication for reducing
alcohol
consumption
in
people
who
are
alcohol
dependent.29 Regulators and advisory bodies in other
European countries, for example, Germany and Sweden,
have not recommended nalmefene for this indication.
The drug is not licensed for use in the USA or Australia.
Palpaceur et al.,74 have recently undertaken a meta-
analysis of the efficacy and safety of nalmefene for the
treatment of alcohol dependence. They included all avail-
able RCTs of nalmefene irrespective of publication status,
primary outcomes and licensed indications.63–70 Overall,
there was some evidence of a beneficial effect of nalme-
fene on the number of heavy drinking days per month
and on total alcohol consumption but there were more
withdrawals for safety reasons in the nalmefene-treated
groups and the findings were not robust. There was no
evidence of a beneficial effect of nalmefene on the health
outcomes examined. The authors concluded that, at best,
nalmefene has limited efficacy in reducing alcohol con-
sumption but they were clearly aware of the limitations
of their review and made specific recommendations for
future studies.
The licensing and subsequent recommendations for
the therapeutic use of nalmefene have been widely criti-
cised.75, 76 The major objections raised include: (i) the
target population was defined following an unplanned
subgroup analysis of the available trials, thus departing
from the intention-to-treat principle; (ii) the placebo
comparator was inappropriate – the efficacy of nalme-
fene should have been compared with naltrexone which
is used off-label for this indication; (iii) the supposed
advantage conferred by nalmefene on alcohol consump-
tion levels was of questionable clinical relevance; and,
(iv) no evidence of wider harm reduction was sought or
provided in the trials included for review.
As nalmefene is an opioid receptor antagonist the same
precautions and guidance provided for naltrexone in rela-
tion to opioid usage should apply. The most commonly
encountered side-effects are nausea, insomnia, dizziness,
vomiting and fatigue. However, use of naltrexone has not
been associated with evident hepatotoxicity. Naltrexone is
considerably
more
expensive
than
the
other
drugs
licensed to treat alcohol dependence, at least in the UK.
Emerging treatments for alcohol dependence
A number of other agents have been proposed and are
currently
under
investigation
as
potential
treatment
options
for
alcohol
dependence.77–82
The
majority
already have a therapeutic profile and are being repur-
posed for use in this field. Of these baclofen, topiramate
and metadoxine are the best known, but others with an
evidence base include: (i) gabapentin: an inhibitor of
presynaptic, voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels
which is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and
neuropathic pain; (ii) ondansetron: a serotonin 5-HT3
receptor antagonist which is used to prevent nausea and
vomiting in selected clinical situations; (iii) varenicline: a
nicotinic receptor partial agonist which is used for smok-
ing cessation; and, (iv) aripiprazole: an anti-psychotic
which is a partial dopamine agonist. None of these com-
pounds is licensed for the treatment of alcohol depend-
ence but can of course be used off-label.
Baclofen. Baclofen is a selective c-aminobutyric acid
(GABA)-B
receptor
agonist
which
was
originally
approved for the treatment of spasticity associated with
multiple sclerosis and spinal cord lesions. Activation of
GABA-B receptors might reduce anxiety and it was for
this reason that it was identified as a potential treatment
for alcohol withdrawal and dependence.
A number of placebo-controlled RCTs of baclofen,
30–60 mg/day, have been undertaken but with widely
872

 different results.83–88 A series of trials undertaken by one
Italian group,83–85 including a trial in patients with cir-
rhosis,84 showed significantly higher abstinence rates in
participants receiving baclofen compared with placebo,
together with improvements in other drinking out-
comes.83, 85 However, studies undertaken in the USA,86
Australia87 and Israel88 showed no beneficial effects of
baclofen
over
placebo
on
any
drinking
outcome,
although a post hoc analysis of the Australian data
showed that baclofen conferred some benefit, in terms of
relapse behaviour, in a subgroup of patients with a
comorbid anxiety disorder.87 Overall the drug was well-
tolerated.
The divergent results of these studies have not been
fully explained. One suggestion is that they may relate to
the relatively low doses of baclofen used in the trials
undertaken to date. Baclofen is rapidly absorbed and
excreted primarily unchanged by the kidney but there is
significant inter-subject variation in its pharmacokinetics,
which could potentially be reflected in differences in
population responses. This view was supported by the
self-reported experience of a French physician who
treated his own alcohol dependence and anxiety disorder
with baclofen in a dose of 270 mg/day.89, 90 The con-
sequent media interest resulted in an unprecedented
demand, in France, for off-label treatment with high
dose baclofen.91, 92 In 2014, baclofen, in doses up to
300 mg/day,
was
authorised
by
the
French
Health
Agency (FHA) as a second-line drug to prevent relapse
or reduce drinking in people with alcohol dependence93
This authorisation, which is a specific measure known as
a ‘temporary recommendation for use’ (TRU) requires
centralised collection of follow-up data.93
Studies utilising high doses of baclofen are now being
reported. A German group randomised 56 alcohol-
dependent people to either baclofen titrated to 270 mg/
day or placebo.94 The mean daily dose of baclofen
achieved during the 12 week high dose phase of the trial
was 180 mg and during this phase abstinence rates were
higher in those receiving baclofen than placebo (68.2%
vs. 23.8%, P = 0.014); baclofen also had a significant
beneficial effect on overall abstinence rates during the
20 week trial (42.9% vs. 14.3% P = 0.04). However, there
was no relationship between the individualised doses of
baclofen and drinking behaviour outcomes suggesting
that the efficacy of baclofen does not have a clear dose
threshold.
A multicentre RCT95 undertaken in the Netherlands
randomly assigned 151 alcohol-dependent individuals to
6 weeks titration and 10 weeks maintenance with either
low-dose baclofen (30 mg/day), high-dose baclofen (up
to
150 mg/day;
mean
94 mg/day),
or
placebo.
No
significant differences were observed between the groups
in the time to first relapse; the proportions who relapsed;
the proportions who attained continuously abstinence;
the cumulative abstinence duration; or the drop-out
rates. Two important considerations need to be taken
into account in relation to this trial viz: (i) the drug
dosage schedule and degree of psychosocial support dif-
fered between patients recruited from inpatient and out-
patient facilities; and, (ii) the continuous abstinent rates
were very high viz. high dose baclofen 62.5% cf. placebo
65.9%.
The results of two French high-dose baclofen studies,
which will be pivotal in determining whether the TUR
currently in place will be removed by the FHA or made
official,
have
been
reported
but
in
abstract
form
only.96, 97 In the first of these – the ALPADIR study96 –
320 alcohol-dependent out-patients attending French
specialist alcohol treatment clinics were randomised to
baclofen (target dose 180 mg/day attained by 66%) or
placebo using a 7-week titration, and 17 weeks mainten-
ance paradigm. The proportions of patients who were
continuously abstinent throughout the trial were similar
in both groups viz. baclofen 11.9%; placebo 10.5%. Post
hoc subgroup analyses showed more evidence of benefit
in the heaviest drinkers and when the outcome variable
selected was the overall reduction in consumption.
The second of these French studies – the multicenter
BACLOVILLE study – was designed to explore prag-
matic risk reduction in a general practice.98 A total of
320 attendees diagnosed as having an alcohol use disor-
der
were
randomised
to
treatment
with
baclofen,
individually titrated to a maximum dose of 300 mg/day,
or placebo for 12 months. There was no requirement for
participants to be withdrawn from alcohol or to receive
psychosocial support. The primary outcome, which was
the
proportion
of
patients
who
achieved
WHO
defined safe drinking levels (1–20 g/day for women and
1–40 g/day for men) was attained by 56.8% of the baclo-
fen group and 36.5% of the placebo group (risk reduc-
tion 1.56 [95% CI: 1.15–2.11]; P = 0.004). At present, no
other information on outcome variables or safety is
available.98
These four high-dose baclofen studies are not directly
comparable as they differ considerably in aspects of
patient selection; study design and duration; dosage
schedules;
and
outcome
variables.
In
addition,
the
reporting of the two French studies is still incomplete.
Thus, overall conclusions about the efficacy of baclofen

Review: pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence
 as a treatment for alcohol dependence cannot be made
at this time.
Baclofen and alcohol are both central nervous depress-
ants so there are considerable safety concerns around
use of this drug.46 Fatigue, sleep disorders and vertigo/
dizziness were more frequent in those taking the active
drug particularly in the high-dose studies. Reports of fur-
ther adverse event such as major sedation,99 seizures,100
mania101 and sleep apnoea102 are increasing in parallel
with increased use of this drug.
Topiramate. Topiramate is a potent anti-epileptic with
strong neuroprotective properties. It has many proposed
targets
of action,
including
facilitation
of GABA-A
receptor activity and reduction in glutamate activity
in a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
and kainate receptors. Like many other drugs proposed for
the treatment of alcohol dependence, it is thought to reduce
mesolimbic dopaminergic activity. A small number of RCTs
of topiramate vs. placebo, no treatment or an active com-
parator for the treatment of alcohol dependence have been
undertaken and subjected to systematic review with or
without meta-analysis.103, 104 A systematic review of topira-
mate vs. placebo103 including seven RCTs, involving 1125
participants, demonstrated significant, though moderate,
benefits of topiramate for abstinence and heavy drinking
outcomes. A more generic Cochrane review of anti-convul-
sants in the management of alcohol dependence104 included
a separate analysis of six placebo-controlled RCTs of topira-
mate, involving 970 participants, and showed a modest but
significant beneficial effect on heavy drinking and the num-
ber of drinks per drinking day but a rather less robust effect
on the number of abstinent days. Topiramate in a dose of
300 mg/day appears to be relatively well-tolerated with the
most common adverse effects being dizziness, paraesthesia
and anorexia. However, all the trials undertaken to date are
short-term; with long-term treatment there is potential,
given the drug’s safety profile, for the emergence of other
side-effects such as difficulties with memory and cognitive
impairment.
Metadoxine. Metadoxine (pyridoxal L-2-pyrrolidone-5-
carboxylate) is an ion pair salt of pyridoxine and L-pyro-
glutamate. It is approved in several European countries,
India, the Russian Federation and Brazil for treating
acute alcohol intoxication, based on its ability, when
given as a single 900 mg intravenous dose, to facilitate
the elimination of alcohol from blood and tissues.105
Metadoxine has also been used to treat alcohol depend-
ence based on its properties as a selective serotonin
receptor subtype 5-HT2B antagonist and a monoamine-
independent
GABA
modulator.106
In
an
open-label
study, patients treated with metadoxine, 1500 mg/day in
divided doses, were significantly more likely to maintain
abstinence at 3 months than untreated controls (44.8%
vs. 21.6%; P < 0.004).107 In a randomised, open-label
study in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis survivors
who received metadoxine, in addition to standard ther-
apy, were significantly more likely to maintain abstinence
at 6 months than those who did not (74.5% vs. 59.4%,
P = 0.02).108
Metadoxine
has
an
excellent
safety
record.109 Its use needs to be further explored.
Pharmacotherapy in specific situations
Alcohol-related liver disease. The most important man-
agement goal for patients with significant alcohol-related
liver injury is abstinence from alcohol. Nevertheless, this
aspect of their management, and in particular, the use of
adjuvant pharmacotherapy to achieve this goal, is incon-
sistently addressed in the literature with scant or no
mention
by
some110, 111
but
specific
mention
by
others.112–114
No RCTs of the three main medications currently
licensed for the treatment of alcohol dependence have
been undertaken in people with significant alcohol-
related liver injury. Of these, acamprosate has the best
safety profile.46, 51, 54 It is not metabolised in the liver
and there are no reported instances of hepatotoxicity.
Furthermore, Delgrange et al.,115 reported, in a single
dose RCT, that acamprosate does not adversely affect
neuropsychiatric status in patients with Child’s Grade A
and B cirrhosis. Hepatotoxicity has not emerged as a
clinical problem with naltrexone in standard doses,
although hepatotoxicity is a concern, in certain circum-
stances, when higher doses are used.60 Patients with
advanced liver disease are particularly vulnerable to nal-
trexone-induced hepatotoxicity,116 so its use in this situa-
tion would need to be montored carefully. Use of
disulfiram has been complicated by the development of
hepatotoxicity which is associated with a mortality rate
of 28%.117 It is best avoided in patients with chronic
liver disease.
Baclofen in a dose of 30 mg/day has been shown, in
one RCT, to be a safe and effective treatment for alcohol
dependence in patients with cirrhosis.84 However, the
study population was very carefully selected to exclude
people with diabetes, hepatic encephalopathy, psychiatric
comorbidity and comorbid drug misuse. Hence, the
safety findings in this study may not be generalisable. In
addition, much higher doses of baclofen are now being
874

 used to treat alcohol dependence but no information is
available on the safety profile associated with these dose
levels in patients with liver disease; until this information
is available considerable caution should be exercised in
use of this drug in this setting.
Topiramate has only rarely been linked to clinically
apparent liver injury. However, as it is metabolised via
CYP3A4 it may potentiate the hepatotoxicity associated
with other drugs metabolised via this system. The
anti-epileptic
drug
sodium
valproate,
for
example,
inhibits the first enzyme in the urea cycle and its use
may be associated with the development of hyperam-
monaemic encephalopathy; co-medication with topira-
mate increases the circulating levels of free valproate
and significantly increases the risk of this potentially
fatal complication.118
Metadoxine has an excellent safety profile and has
been shown to have utility not only to treat alcohol
dependence but also alcohol-related liver disease. It
accelerates the normalisation of liver function tests and
the liver appearance on ultrasound in individuals with
alcohol-related steatosis, even in those who do not com-
pletely abstinent from alcohol.119 In patients with severe
alcoholic hepatitis treated with prednisolone the addition
of metadoxine significantly improved survival, compared
with prednisolone alone, both at 30 days (74.3% vs.
45.7%; P = 0.02) and at 90 days (68.6% vs. 20.0%;
P = 0.0001).120 The addition of metadoxine also signifi-
cantly reduced the development/progression of hepatic
encephalopathy (29.6% vs. 60.0%; P = 0.008) and hep-
atorenal syndrome (31.4% vs. 54.3%; P = 0.05).120 These
beneficial effects likely relate to the fact that metadoxine
is an antioxidant and has also been shown to inhibit
hepatic lipid accumulation and protect against glu-
tathione depletion.121 Further studies with this drug are
clearly needed.
Both the American and European Associations for the
Study of the Liver122, 123 recommend the use of acam-
prosate and naltrexone, in conjunction with psychosocial
support, to decrease the likelihood of relapse in patients
with alcohol-related liver disease. Future recommenda-
tions with regard to the use of baclofen in this setting
will require a more extensive evidence base.
Comorbid psychiatric disorders and co-occurring drug
misuse. Psychiatric comorbidity and co-occurring drug
misuse are common in people with alcohol dependence.
However,
pharmacological
intervention
for
alcohol
dependence, in these situations, has received very little
attention.13
People with alcohol dependence are frequently anxious
and/or depressed but these symptoms often remit once
they achieve abstinence or significantly reduce their alco-
hol intake.13 Medication for depression and anxiety is
often ineffective in people who are consuming significant
amounts of alcohol either for relieving the psychiatric
symptoms or for curbing the alcohol misuse.124, 125 In
consequence, guidance from NICE recommends focusing
on the management of the alcohol misuse as the first
priority.13 Acamprosate can be used to facilitate abstin-
ence under these circumstances; it is well-tolerated; it
does not interact with alcohol or have addictive potential;
and is safe in overdose. Naltrexone and disulfiram both
interact with alcohol and are less safe in these situations.
If, however, symptoms of significant anxiety or depres-
sion remain after 3–4 weeks of abstinence from alcohol
then patients should be referred appropriately for specific
management of their mental health disorder.126 People
with alcohol dependence and significant comorbid mental
problems, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and
those assessed to be at high risk of suicide, should be
referred to a psychiatrist to make sure that effective
assessment, treatment and risk-management plans are
put in place.127
Alcohol and illicit drug dependence often co-occur.
Treatment of the drug misuse must be optimised using
psychosocial
and/or
pharmacological
approaches,
as
appropriate,128 but the alcohol misuse must also be
specifically addressed. Naltrexone is not an option in
individuals who have used or are using opioids and there
are no published studies of acamprosate in opioid-
dependent populations. Nevertheless, acamprosate is safe,
well-tolerated and does not interact with the commonly
used illicit drugs or with methadone or the anti-viral
agents
use
to
treat
comorbid
hepatitis
C
or HIV
infection.
Predictors of outcome
The drugs currently available for the treatment of alco-
hol dependence have only modest effects and attempts
have been made to optimise treatment by identifying
people more likely to respond. These attempts are con-
founded by the so-called ‘placebo effect’ and by factors
pertaining to adherence and compliance with treatment.
The placebo effect. The placebo effect can confound
efforts to determine treatment effectiveness in clinical
trials. The greater the placebo group response the more
difficult it is to demonstrate medication efficacy. The pla-
cebo response in trials of drugs for alcohol dependence
Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2017; 45: 865–882
875
ª 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd
Review: pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence
 appears to be even greater than, for example, trials in
depression and schizophrenia. Furthermore, more recent
studies in alcohol dependence have shown greater pla-
cebo group improvement, an effect which persists even
after controlling for several other moderators, including
concomitant interventions. Thus, attempts will need to
be made to more effectively isolate alcohol medication
effects in future studies.129, 130
Compliance and adherence. The clinical effectiveness of
any medication is highly influenced by the degree of
patient compliance and adherence to treatment regimens.
Trials of drugs for the treatment of alcohol dependence,
as in the addiction field generally, are characterised by
high drop-out rates and generally low levels of compli-
ance
with
treatment.42, 51, 58
However,
very
little
information is available on the factors which affect com-
pliance in this setting. Rohsenow et al.,131 found that
compliance with naltrexone was better in those who
believed that the medication would help them maintain
abstinence, and was not predicted by demographic or
pre-treatment alcohol use, commitment to abstinence or
perceptions about their own ability to abstain. Supervi-
sion or witnessing, which are employed primarily in
patients receiving disulfiram, are a major determinant of
compliance and hence effectiveness.42
Demography, drinking variables and comorbidities. A
number of demographic variables, along with features of
the drinking behaviour and potential comorbidities, have
been explored and several possible predictors of out-
come identified, but the results are inconsistent. The
most favourable results in people receiving unsupervised
disulfiram were in those who were older; more socially
stable; impulsive and motivated.34, 132 Pooled data from
seven placebo-controlled RCTs of acamprosate, involving
1485 participants, showed that there were no significant
relationships between treatment outcome and gender,
the age of onset, the severity of dependence or family
history.133 A number of studies have reported that peo-
ple with a family history of alcohol-related problems are
more likely to benefit from naltrexone but other identi-
fied predictors such as high levels of craving, early age
of
onset,
concomitant
drug
misuse
and
comorbid
depression are not as robust.134–136 Mann et al.,137 have
shown, using functional cerebral MRI, that alcohol-
dependent people with high brain activity in the ventral
striatum in response to alcohol cues had significantly
better treatment outcomes with naltrexone. High cue
reactivity
as
an
‘endophenotype’
might
help
to
prospectively identify alcohol-dependent patients likely
to respond to treatment. However, for obvious reasons,
this approach is likely to be limited to studying the
mechanisms of treatment responses.
Pharmacogenetics. A number of studies have examined
the role of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
rs1799971 in the l-opioid receptor 1 gene (OPRM1) in
relation to the response to treatment with naltrexone. Sev-
eral, but not all, have reported a link between possession
of the G allele of rs1799971 and better drinking outcomes.
Anton et al.,138 for example, showed that individuals car-
rying the G allele were more likely to attain abstinence
and to have less heavy drinking days. However, Coller
et al.,139
found
no
significant
association
between
rs1799971 genotype and any treatment outcome. Jonas
et al.,140 recently undertook a meta-analysis of eight trials,
involving 1365 participants, which assessed rs1799971
genotype and the response to naltrexone and found no
association between possession of the G allele and the
return to any drinking or the return to heavy drinking.
Karpyak et al.,141 reported an association, in people
treated with acamprosate, between abstinence length and
polymorphisms in the glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-
methyl D-aspartate 2B (GRIN2B) gene, which encodes for
the
GluN2B
subunit
of
the
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor. Carriage of the minor alleles of two
SNPs, rs2058878 and rs2300272, which are in strong link-
age disequilibrium, was associated with longer abstinence
duration.
Kranzler
et al.,142, 143
explored
the
relationship
between the outcomes of treatment with topiramate and
polymorphisms in the glutamate ionotropic receptor kai-
nate type subunit 1 (GRIK1) gene, which encodes the
GluK1 subunit of the glutamatergic kainate receptor. In
alcohol-dependent people who were homozygous for the
C allele in rs2832407 treatment with topiramate resulted
in a greater reduction in alcohol consumption than in
carriers of the A allele. It has been suggested that
homozygosity for the C allele moderates peoples’ desire
to drink and increases their belief in their ability to
abstain.142, 143
The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is encoded by the
gene, solute carrier family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4). The
promotor region of SLC6A4 contains a polymorphism
with short (S) and long (L) repeats in a 50-HTT-linked
polymorphic
region
(50-HTTLPR).
Johnson
et al.,144
showed that individuals homozygous for the L allele had
better
drinking
outcomes,
following
treatment
with
ondansetron, than carriers of the S allele.

 No studies have been undertaken, to date, to assess
the clinical utility of genotype-guided medication selec-
tion or dosing strategies, and in only one, which was
unfortunately substantially underpowered, were particip-
ants randomised to treatment with naltrexone or placebo
by genotype.145 Future studies may ultimately define a
range of genetic variations that have clinical value in
predicting response to the drugs used to treat alcohol
dependence.
Barriers to treatment
Between 1.6 and 3.2 million people in England are alco-
hol dependent.2, 3 In 2014–2015 only 150 640 (4.7–
9.4%) of those affected received specialist treatment for
their alcohol problems and this was only successfully
completed in an estimated 47 900.146 However, despite
the fact that pharmacotherapy has been shown to be
cost-effective this treatment approach is significantly
underutilised.13 Thus, in 2015, only 196 000 items were
prescribed in primary care and NHS hospital settings
throughout England although separate data were not
available for naltrexone as it is also prescribed for drug
use disorders. Overall acamprosate accounted for 71% of
the prescribed items while nalmefene accounted for
2.2%.146 While overall there has been a steady increase
in the number of items dispensed this remains small
given the size of the population at risk (Figure 1). Recent
data from Australia show that only 3% of people with
alcohol dependence receive pharmacotherapy and, of
those, only 15–25% receive the minimum period of
3 months
treatment
recommended
in
the
National
Guidelines.147
There are several possible barriers to the use of phar-
macotherapy for the treatment of alcohol dependence
(Table 3). Thus, for example, doctors may be reluctant
to prescribe because they lack knowledge of or familiar-
ity with the products available,148 while certain statutory
and non-statutory agencies may be reluctant to prescribe

Review: pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence
 on philosophical grounds or simply because they are not
able to (Table 3).
There are also other broader issues. Thus, the develop-
ment of pharmaceutical agents to treat alcohol use disor-
ders is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the
neurobiological background of alcohol dependence and
inconsistent results from genome wide association stud-
ies which have, overall, failed to identify robust, replic-
able targets for drug development. Further investigation
and investment is clearly needed.
CONCLUSION
Individuals with alcohol use disorders often fail to
receive care, particularly evidence-based care, and there
is clear evidence that although drug treatment for
alcohol dependence is safe and cost-effective it is sub-
stantially underutilised. Efforts must be made to over-
come the current barriers to treatment which, in large
part, reflect unwillingness by doctors to prescribe these
medications.
