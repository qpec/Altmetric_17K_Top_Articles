We measured vestibular perceptual thresholds in 105 healthy humans (54F/51M) rang-
ing from 18 to 80 years of age. Direction-recognition thresholds were measured using 
standard methods. The motion consisted of single cycles of sinusoidal acceleration at 
0.2 Hz for roll tilt and 1.0 Hz for yaw rotation about an earth-vertical axis, inter-aural 
earth-horizontal translation (y-translation), inferior–superior earth-vertical translation 
(z-translation), and roll tilt. A large subset of this population (99 of 105) also performed 
a modified Romberg test of standing balance. Despite the relatively large population 
(54F/51M), we found no difference between thresholds of male and female subjects. 
After pooling across sex, we found that thresholds increased above the age of 40 for all 
five motion directions investigated. The data were best modeled by a two-segment age 
model that yielded a constant baseline below an age cutoff of about 40 and a threshold 
increase above the age cutoff. For all subjects who passed all conditions of the balance 
test, the baseline thresholds were 0.97°/s for yaw rotation, 0.66°/s for 1-Hz roll tilt, 
0.35°/s for 0.2-Hz roll tilt, 0.58 cm/s for y-translation, and 1.24 cm/s for z-translation. 
As a percentage of the baseline, the fitted slopes (indicating the threshold increase each 
decade above the age cutoff) were 83% for z-translation, 56% for 1-Hz roll tilt, 46% for 
y-translation, 32% for 0.2-Hz roll tilt, and 15% for yaw rotation. Even taking age and 
other factors into consideration, we found a significant correlation of balance test failures 
with increasing roll-tilt thresholds.

Data suggest that, on average, females and males have a significantly different number of vestibular 
afferent fibers (1) and that a significant difference in the size of the vestibular labyrinth exists (2). 
Such anatomical differences could contribute to behavioral differences, but studies utilizing standard 
clinical vestibular assays (3–8) have found no significant sex effects. Nonetheless, differences could 
exist. Wall and colleagues reported a very small, but significant, difference in the VOR phase at 
0.005 Hz in a population of 25 males and 25 females (9). Benson reported perceptual translation 
thresholds (i.e., the smallest motion that can be reliably perceived as leftward or rightward) for 
females that were roughly 40% lower than for males for each of the three translation directions (7), 
but this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, yaw rotation thresholds were reported 
to be about 20% lower in females than males (8), but again, this difference was not statistically 
significant. Given these data, we felt that a sex effect deserved study using a larger sample.

Vestibular Age Effects

We chose to measure vestibular thresholds for a variety of 
reasons. (1) Threshold testing uses small motions that typically 
are well tolerated. (2) Like other threshold measures (e.g., audi-
tory thresholds), vestibular thresholds have direct functional 
relevance. (3) Thresholds have been shown to be a sensitive 
measure of vestibular function that has been shown to identify 
specific peripheral vestibular deficits (10). (4) Thresholds have 
shown great promise to help diagnose central disorders such as 
vestibular migraine (11, 12), which may be the most prevalent 
vestibular disorder. (5) Unlike other vestibular responses such 
as the VOR, one previous study was unable to demonstrate 
adaptive perceptual threshold changes even following substan-
tial training efforts (13) – possibly because the brain receives 
little information to drive adaptation during threshold-level 
motion. (6) Thresholds can provide a comprehensive assay of 
many aspects of vestibular function – including perception, 
all peripheral end organ pairs, central vestibular functions, 
etc. – that are straightforward to interpret and can be compared 
across motion types (i.e., translation, tilt, and rotation) relative 
to normal.
Earlier vestibular threshold studies have come to different 
conclusions regarding the effect of age on rotation thresholds and 
translation thresholds. One study (14) measured thresholds for 
yaw rotation in a group of 19 younger subjects, aged 20–26, and a 
group of 16 older subjects, aged 63–84, and found no significant 
effect of age. Similarly, Seemungal and colleagues (15) reported 
no difference in yaw rotation thresholds between a group of 14 
young (mean age of 23) and 9 older (mean age of 63) normal 
subjects. Each of these reports is consistent with another study 
(16) of 24 normal subjects between the ages of 21 and 60 that 
found no effect of age on yaw rotation thresholds.
While published studies do not show a significant correlation 
of yaw rotation thresholds with age, there is evidence to suggest 
that translational thresholds do correlate with age. However, 
one of the studies that did not find a correlation of yaw rotation 
threshold with age (16) did report a correlation with age for 
thresholds measured using naso-occipital (x-axis) and inter-aural 
(y-axis) translations. Furthermore, Agrawal and colleagues (17) 
reported that thresholds of 42 normal subjects demonstrated a 
significant positive correlation with age for naso-occipital (x-axis) 
and inferior–superior (z-axis) translation but not for inter-aural 
(y-axis) translation, and another recent paper (18) reported that 
translation thresholds for 42 normal subjects were significantly 
correlated with age for naso-occipital (x-axis), inferior–superior 
(z-axis), and inter-aural (y-axis) translations. Finally, Kingma 
(19) reported that for a population of 28 healthy subjects between 
the ages of 22 and 60 (7 subjects/decade), thresholds increased 
linearly with age for naso-occipital (x-axis) translation but found 
no correlation for inter-aural (y-axis) translation thresholds.
Before proceeding, we also note that non-vestibular cues (e.g., 
somatosensory and proprioceptive) may contribute to these 
thresholds, but a previous study showed bilateral vestibular defec-
tive patients have significantly higher thresholds (20), suggesting 
a predominant influence of the vestibular cues.
Given the earlier findings, we decided to include a larger 
number of healthy normal subjects (54 females and 51 males) 
than reported in previous investigations. We specifically targeted 
our recruitment to obtain age- and gender-matched subjects 
for each decade spanning an age range between 18 and 80. We 
measured direction-recognition thresholds in the dark for (a) 
yaw rotations – transduced primarily by the lateral semicircular 
canals, (b) superior–inferior (z-axis) translations – transduced 
primarily by the saccular organs, (c) inter-aural (y-axis) transla-
tions – transduced primarily by the utricular organs, and (d) 
roll tilts – transduced primarily by the vertical canals and the 
utricular organs. We emphasize that this study is the first to look 
at age effects for roll-tilt thresholds; the importance of this is 
emphasized by recent reports of lowered thresholds in patients 
suffering vestibular migraine (11, 12).
MaTerials anD MeThODs
Perceptual thresholds were sampled in 105 subjects, 54 females 
and 51 males, between the ages of 18 and 80. All subjects 
filled out a general health questionnaire to confirm that they 
qualified to participate, including the absence of vestibular 
symptoms. Menstrual cycle status and diagnosis of migraine 
were determined via two separate questionnaires. A standing 
balance test was used to objectively evaluate balance function. 
Threshold data collection methods generally mimicked those 
used by Valko and colleagues (20), but data were collected for 
only a small subset of the frequencies sampled in that earlier 
study. Specifically, for each subject, yaw rotations were applied 
about an earth-vertical axis at 1 Hz, y-translations were applied 
along an earth-horizontal axis at 1 Hz, z-translations were 
applied along the earth-vertical axis at 1 Hz, and roll tilts about 
a head-centered earth-horizontal axis were applied at 0.2 and 
1 Hz. Participation in the study took about 3 h including at least 
two breaks. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects 
as dictated by the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was 
approved by the MEEI Human Use Committee.
Questionnaires
A short health questionnaire was administered to all subjects for 
screening purposes. History of current and previous diseases, 
with an emphasis in neurological, otologic, vestibular, and 
chronic uncontrolled diseases, and medications was obtained. 
Acting conservatively, subjects diagnosed with any major health 
problem or under medications that could potentially affect 
vestibular function or decision making were excluded, as were 
subjects with any history of vestibular symptoms. As just one 
example, subjects with vestibular migraine would typically have 
been excluded because of their occasional symptoms.
Women were asked to fill out a separate questionnaire to estab-
lish menstrual cycle status (premenopausal, postmenopausal, 
or other). For premenopausal women, length and regularity of 
cycles, start of current cycle (i.e., first day of menstrual bleeding), 
and current use of hormonal contraception was recorded.
Because prevalence of migraine is known to be higher in 
females (21), we considered migraine as a potential confound-
ing factor for our analyses. The Migraine Screen Questionnaire 
(MS-Q) developed and validated by Láinez et al. (22, 23) was 
administered to confirm history of migraine and/or to detect 
hidden migraine. A MS-Q score ≥4 was considered positive.

Balance Testing
To assess balance function, the modified Romberg test of stand-
ing balance on firm and compliant support surfaces (24) was 
performed. This balance test consists of four steps. Each step 
must be passed in order to move to the next step. All steps are 
performed standing with feet together and arms crossed. To pass 
the first step, each participant had to stand on the floor for 15 s 
with eyes open. To pass the second step, they had to stand on the 
floor for 15 s with eyes closed. To pass the third step, they had 
to stand on memory foam with eyes open for 30 s. To pass the 
final step, they had to stand on the foam with eyes closed for 30 s. 
This final test condition primarily assesses vestibular function 
(24, 25), since visual contributions are eliminated and the foam 
makes kinesthetic cues unreliable. The balance test was scored 
on a pass/fail basis. Failure was defined as participants needing 
to open their eyes or arms or move their feet to maintain stability 
before the end of the trial. All subjects were allowed two trials at 
each step.
Motion stimuli and Psychophysical 
Threshold Tests
The motion paradigms and psychophysical tests employed 
to measure perceptual thresholds for this study have been 
previously published in detail (26, 27), so are described briefly 
herein. Motion stimuli were generated with a Moog 6DOF 
motion platform. Motion stimuli were single cycles of sinusoidal 
acceleration (either linear acceleration or angular acceleration)

, where A is the acceleration 
amplitude and f is the motion frequency]. We present thresholds 
using the peak velocity of each stimulus. As shown in earlier 
papers [e.g., Ref. (8, 26)], this yields bell-shaped velocity trajecto-
ries having a maximum velocity of vmax = A/(πf).
Subjects were seated in an upright position, held via an 
adjustable five-point harness and a helmet. To minimize other 
sensory cues, motions were performed in the dark in a light-tight 
room, all skin surfaces except the face and hands were covered, 
and noise-canceling headphones played constant amplitude 
white noise during the motions to mask any auditory cues and to 
indicate the time period when each motion occurred.
A three-down/one-up (3D/1U) adaptive staircase was used 
to target stimuli near threshold (28, 29). To minimize training 
effects, suprathreshold practice trials were administered until 
each subject understood and was comfortable with the task before 
each set of trials. Each block consisted of 100 trials, where a single 
motion stimulus was provided per trial. One hundred trials was 
considered adequate because an earlier study (29) showed that 
100 trials yielded methodological threshold variations of just 18% 
– much less than the intra-subject variations reported previously 
by Benson (7, 8). Furthermore, 200 trials, while roughly doubling 
test time, yielded just an incremental improvement in threshold 
precision (from 18 to 13%). Until the first mistake, the stimulus 
was halved after three correct responses at each level. From this 
point onward, the size of the change in stimulus magnitude was 
determined using parameter estimation by sequential testing 
(PEST) rules (30). For all conditions, initial stimuli were set at a 
level that was suprathreshold for the vast majority of subjects. Yaw 
rotations began at a vmax = 4°/s, y-translations at vmax = 4 cm/s, 
z-translations at vmax = 16 cm/s, and roll tilts at vmax = 3°/s for 1-Hz 
stimuli and vmax = 2°/s for 0.2 Hz. No feedback was provided as 
to the correctness of the responses after each trial. On only one 
test (1-Hz roll tilt) did the subject increase the stimulus amplitude 
beyond the motion device motion capabilities (1 out of more than 
500 successful tests). When this occurred, since we thought that 
the subject may not have understood how to indicate the tilt 
direction, the subject was instructed again and given a second 
chance and then successfully completed the testing.
As a subtle enhancement to the published methods, all subjects 
used a two-stage task on an iPad to indicate responses. The iPad 
backlight illumination was off during all motion stimuli. Subjects 
were instructed to first tap the left (top) side of the screen if they 
perceived a leftward (upward) motion or to tap the right (bottom) 
side for rightward (downward) motion. Each tap was followed 
by feedback confirming the selection. Subjects were instructed 
that they must provide an answer. These instructions mimicked 
our earlier instructions, with the only difference as the use of an 
iPad instead of buttons to provide the binary indications. These 
standard binary data are used for all analyses presented herein.
After indicating perceived motion direction, subjects were 
instructed to indicate whether they were uncertain or not uncer-
tain. If uncertain, subjects pressed the left and right sides of the 
iPad screen simultaneously. Otherwise, they pressed the same 
side of the screen again (e.g., right side twice for a right/certain 
response). These certainty/uncertainty data are not presented 
herein and are described here only to report our exact procedures.
As noted by others (13), testing at different frequencies could 
yield different results, especially since thresholds vary with fre-
quency [e.g., Ref. (7, 8, 20, 26, 31–33)]. Roll tilts at 0.2 Hz were 
chosen to assess sensory integration between canal and otolith 
cues (34), but we chose 1-Hz stimuli for most testing because (1) 
subjects report that tasks using 1-Hz stimuli are easier than both 
(a) higher frequency (e.g., 5 Hz) stimuli that require high alert-
ness to avoid missing brief stimuli and (b) lower frequency (e.g., 
0.1 Hz) stimuli that require extended periods of attention and (2) 
they require just 1 s, so 100 trials can be accomplished in less than 
10 min (including time for responses and pauses between trials).
Data analysis
For all conditions, the threshold (σ, sometimes called the 
psychometric width parameter) was determined by fitting a psy-
chometric curve to the binary (e.g., left/right) experimental data. 
Specifically, a Gaussian cumulative distribution psychometric 
function defined by the parameters σ and μ was fit using a maxi-
mum likelihood estimate via a bias-reduced generalized linear 
model (BRGLM) (35) and probit link function (36). Fits were 
performed in MATLAB using the Statistic Toolbox version 8.3.
Geometric means were calculated for across subject averages, 
because, consistent with earlier reports (7, 8), data demonstrated 
a lognormal distribution across subjects for all conditions 
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit for lognormal distribu-
tion, p > 0.25). Both non-parametric and parametric analyses 
(using data in logarithmic units) were used. Multiple logistic 
regression was used to estimate the odds of failing the balance

test associated with thresholds and age. A Pearson correlation was 
used to test for correlation between thresholds in different axes. 
Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Data in other sensory domains [e.g., odor identification (37), 
visual acuity (38), and speech intelligibility (39)] suggest thresh-
olds vary with age in a piecewise manner – with a flat plateau 
below an age cutoff and decreasing sensitivity above the same 
age cutoff. As our data shown in Figure 1 also suggest a similar 
piecewise linear pattern, we hypothesize thresholds remain rela-
tively constant (i.e., no effect of age) up until some age cutoff at 
which point they increase (for simplicity, we assume this increase 
is linear). For each motion condition, the following continuous, 
piecewise linear model was fit to each subject’s threshold (σi) data 
with three parameters: (1) an “age cutoff” (
)
a
ˆcutoff
, (2) a “base-
line” level (

less than the age cutoff, and (3) a “slope” ( )

the rate of threshold increase above the age cutoff, where ai is 
each subject’s age in years rounded to the nearest integer at the 
time of testing was (e.g., 38 years of age). We present slope per 
decade (i.e., 10 years) throughout, since decades provide a more 
meaningful timescale for such changes.

As previously discussed, the thresholds were lognormally dis-
tributed; thus, the threshold data were log transformed and then 
a log-transformed version of the above age model was fit using 
a least-squared Nelder–Mead non-linear minimization routine 
(MATLAB fminsearch.m). Residuals were analyzed to assess the 
appropriateness of the fits. A parametric bootstrap approach (41), 
with M = 2,000 simulated data sets, was used to estimate the 95% 
confidence intervals of each fit parameter.
As shown in Figure 1, the age cutoffs were found to be similar 
across motion conditions. To quantify a single overall age cutoff,

a comprehensive model (same piecewise form as above) was 
fit to the thresholds across all motion conditions. The model 
consisted of 11 parameters: 1 overall age cutoff, 5 baseline levels, 
and 5 slopes (corresponding to each of the 5 motion conditions). 
Each individual threshold data point was first log transformed, 
then standardized by the motion condition using the respective 
mean and SD prior to fitting a log-transformed version of the 
linear age model described above to each of the five data sets 
simultaneously. The standardization and log transformation pro-
cesses were reversed to present model fit parameters and curves 
in the original physical units. We used likelihood ratio tests and 
Bayesian information criteria (BIC) to assess goodness-of-fit for 
the proposed piecewise two-segment linear models compared to 
alternative simple linear and average models.
resUlTs
Thresholds
Our data do not suggest any threshold differences between males 
and females (Table 1). Statistical tests fail to demonstrate any 
significant effect of sex on thresholds. Even when we included 
migraine status, age, and balance test results as factors in multi-
variate analyses, no significant sex effect was found (p > 0.4, for 
each motion condition).
We also looked for a potential difference between premeno-
pausal women under hormonal contraception and normal cycling 
women (Table 2). In all conditions, women taking hormonal birth 
control had higher thresholds. This difference did not appear 
significant except for yaw rotation thresholds (Wilcoxon rank 
sum, p = 0.037). Given multiple comparisons, we do not treat 
this difference as significant.
Furthermore, given that the association between hormonal 
contraception and yaw rotation thresholds could be explained 
by shared associations with other factors such as age, migraine 
status, or balance test results, we included all these factors in a 
multivariate analysis and found no significant effect of hormonal 
contraception on yaw rotation thresholds (p = 0.68) or for any of 
our other motion conditions.
In our sample, participants with migraine, defined as a MS-Q 
score of 4 or more (23), had lower thresholds for 4 of the 5 
conditions – all but yaw rotation – than all other subjects. After 
correcting for multiple comparisons, that potential difference was 
not significant (Table 3). Because the sample size for migraine 
sufferers was so low (N = 5), this is noted as interesting but was 
not further explored herein.
Table 4 shows the velocity threshold geometric mean for each 
motion condition separated into five age groups. As previously 
reported (7), z-translation thresholds were significantly higher 
(typically ~2× higher) than y-translation thresholds (paired t 
test, p < 0.0001). Yaw rotation thresholds were higher than roll 
tilt 1-Hz thresholds (paired t test, p = 0.0028), and roll tilt 0.2-
Hz thresholds were significantly lower than both yaw rotation 
and roll tilt 1-Hz thresholds (paired t test, p < 0.0001 each). All 
five motion conditions showed an increase of threshold (poorer 
direction-recognition performance) with age (Figure 1). We note 
that all five subplots show a relatively flat threshold plateau below 
the age of 40–49 and also show increasing thresholds above that 
same age cutoff.
When each of the five motion conditions was analyzed 
separately, this age effect was significant, even following multi-
ple comparisons correction, for four of the five motions tested 
(Kruskal–Wallis, p < 0.005) – all but yaw rotation. A similar trend 
with age was evident in the yaw rotation data, but this trend was 
not statistically significant (Kruskal–Wallis, p = 0.087). Figures 2 
and 3 show these data.
Having established that there is an age effect that is independ-
ent of other factors, we evaluated whether there is an age cutoff 
above which threshold increases accumulate by fitting a two-piece 
linear model to the data. To minimize the impact of undiagnosed 
vestibular dysfunction, this model fit was first performed only on

data from subjects who passed the balance test. Fitting this model 
to the data set for each motion individually (Table 5), we found 
an average age cutoff of 42.6 years. The residuals were consistent 
with a normal distribution (KS tests, p > 0.4).
Given that the fitted “age cutoff” was similar across the motion 
conditions, we also fit a model having 11 parameters that fit a sin-
gle age cutoff across all 5 threshold data sets while simultaneously 
fitting 2 parameters (slope above cutoff age, baseline below cutoff 
age) to each of the 5 motion conditions. This fit was performed 
twice – once with all of the data and once with data obtained from 
subjects who passed the balance test. Table 6 shows the results 
from this fit. As can be seen in Figures 2 and 3 and Table 6, the 
two fits yielded similar curves. The overall age cutoff when fit 
simultaneously across all motion conditions was 42.1 years for 
all subjects and 42.7 years for all subjects who passed the balance 
test. Each of the slope values shown in Table 6 was significantly 
greater than 0 (p < 0.05) corresponding to an increase in thresh-
old (worse performance) with increasing age above ~40 years.
Table 7 shows fitted degrees of freedom (DOF), variance 
explained, −2 × log(likelihood), and BIC for each of the four 
different models presented: mean model, simple linear model, 
simultaneous two-segment linear model, and the independent 
two-segment linear model. To allow us to provide a single esti-
mate of variance and BIC for each fitting method, we emphasize 
that each of the five data sets were standardized using customary 
calculations (i.e., the mean was subtracted from each data point 
and then divided by SD) described earlier in the methods, which 
yields two benefits. First, it makes all parameters dimensionless, 
which allows us to combine variance across different motion con-
ditions. Second, it makes the variance for each of our five motion 
dimensions the same, which provides even weighting across the 
five measures (Otherwise, the variance could be dominated by 
the measure having the greatest variance).
As one would expect, more fit parameters (i.e., more DOF) 
yields variance reductions, but the 11-parameter 2-segment 
model explains roughly twice the variance of the 10-parameter 
model. In other words, adding a single age cutoff parameter to the 
linear regression model doubles the variance explained.
Likelihood ratio testing was used to test the nested models 
(mean, simultaneous two-segment, and independent two-seg-
ment) and showed that the proposed simultaneous two-segment 
linear model was significantly better than the mean model for 
both the full data set (χ2 statistic = 121.8, DOF = 6, p < 0.0001) 
and the 79 subjects who passed the balance test (χ2 statistic = 88.6, 
DOF = 6, p < 0.0001). Likelihood ratio testing also showed the 
simultaneous two-segment linear model is not significantly dif-
ferent from the independent two-segment linear model for both 
the full data set (χ2 statistic = 0.9, DOF = 4, p = 0.92) and the 79

The simplest model simply calculates the mean (e.g., Table 1), ignoring age variations, 
and provides a standard statistical baseline for the three other models. The linear 
regression model (Table 5) has 10 fit parameters – a slope and intercept for each of 
the 5 motion directions. The independent 2-segment model has 15 fit parameters – a 
baseline, age cutoff, and slope for each of our 5 threshold measures reported herein. 
The simultaneous 2-segment model has 11 fit parameters – a single age cutoff as well 
as a baseline measure and slope for each of 5 threshold measures. The BIC was the 
smallest (best) for the 11-parameter model both for all subjects and for subjects who 
passed the balance test.

subjects who passed the balance test (χ2 statistic = 1.0, DOF = 4, 
p = 0.91).
Bayesian information criteria statistics showed that this 
model was substantially better than the other models considered, 
including the simple linear model. In fact, this analysis showed 
that the simultaneous two-segment model had the smallest BIC 
for both the full data set and for the 79 subjects who passed the 
balance test. The BIC for the 11-parameter 2-segment model was 
always more than 20 points lower than for any other model. For 
context, BIC differences greater than 10 are considered “very 
strong” evidence for the model with the lower BIC (42).
The two simple models – the mean and linear regression 
models – do not match our data well. The mean model cannot 
capture the fact that thresholds increase above the age of about 
40, and the linear regression model cannot capture the fact that 
thresholds are relatively constant below the age of about 40 (e.g., 
Figure 1).
Bias
For our direction-recognition task, the fitted bias parameter 
represents the stimulus magnitude at which a subject is equally 
likely to respond right (up) or left (down) (43). It is poorly under-
stood because it could originate from any of the three sources: 
(a) a bias in the information, (b) a bias in the placement of the 
decision boundary (43), or (c) a bias in the noise distribution. 
We evaluated bias and normalized bias; normalized bias is simply 
the fitted bias divided by the fitted threshold. This dimensionless 
parameter has the advantage that it is readily comparable across 
motion conditions.
Neither the mean value of the bias nor the mean value of 
normalized bias was significantly different from 0 for any of 
the 5 motion conditions. This was true across all 105 subjects as 
well as for the 79 subjects who passed the balance test (t test, 
p > 0.05 for all 20 conditions tested after correction for multiple 
comparisons).1 Furthermore, correlation coefficients for either 
bias or normalized bias versus age were not significantly different 
from 0 for any of the 5 motion conditions. Again, this was true 
for all subjects as well as for those who passed the balance test 
(Kruskal–Wallis, p > 0.1 for all 20 conditions tested).
Figures 4 and 5 show scatterplots of the normalized bias 
values for all the motion conditions. Consistent with correlation 
analyses reported above, no significant or consistent trends are 
evident.

Given that vestibular information is a fundamental contributor 
to balance control, we looked for associations between thresholds 
1 Prior to multiple comparison correction, only the normalized Z-translation bias 
for subjects who passed the balance test suggested a statistically significant effect 
(t-test, p = 0.0441).

and performance on the modified Romberg test. A subsample of 
99 subjects performed the balance test. Not a single participant 
failed the test in conditions 1, 2, or 3, but 20% (20 of 99) failed in 
condition 4. Thresholds were significantly greater for participants 
who failed the final balance test condition (i.e., the Romberg 
test condition focused primarily on vestibular function) for all 
motion axes (Table 8).
Consistent with earlier findings (25), the proportion of bal-
ance test failures increased with age group (Fisher exact test, 
p < 0.0001). To test whether the observed difference between the 
pass and fail group may be due to an age effect or to the influence 
of other confounding factors, we adjusted for age, gender, and 
migraine using a mixed model. The significant association of bal-
ance test failure with increasing threshold remained persistent for 
roll tilt at both 0.2 and 1 Hz (p = 0.003 and p = 0.02, respectively) 
but was not significantly correlated for increasing yaw rotation 
(p = 0.09), y-translation (p = 0.50), and z-translation (p = 0.09) 
thresholds. The age effect was unchanged for all motion para-
digms – remaining significant for y-translation, z-translation, and 
roll tilt at 1 Hz (each p < 0.0001) and roll tilt at 0.2 Hz (p = 0.0007) 
and not significant for yaw rotation (p = 0.12).
Odds of failing the balance test have been associated with sig-
nificantly increased odds of falling, for American adults 40 years 
and older (25). Our data show that a 1 unit increase in roll-tilt 
thresholds at 0.2 Hz (following transformation in SAS using 
natural log) were associated with a 5.6-fold increase in the odds 
of failing the balance test (odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence inter-
val, 1.6–18.9) in a multiple logistic regression adjusted for age. 
One-unit increase in roll-tilt thresholds at 1 Hz (log-transformed 
version) was associated with a 3.7-fold increase in the odds of 
balance testing failure (odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 
1.1–12.9).

DiscUssiOn
In this study, we attempted to determine whether sex or age 
affected perceptual thresholds of vestibular functioning. To do 
this, we asked subjects to indicate the direction of movement they 
perceived in 5 blocks of 100 trials each for the following motion 
conditions: yaw rotation, y-translation, z-translation, roll tilt at 
1 Hz, and roll tilt also at 0.2 Hz. One primary finding was that 
thresholds increased with age for all motion directions above the 
age of about 40. This finding is consistent with a number of earlier 
threshold studies that had reported similar effects of age x-axis 
translation (16, 19) and y-axis translation (16) but inconsistent 
with a few earlier studies that reported no such age effects for yaw 
rotation (14–16). We note that the yaw rotation age effect was the 
smallest that we observed and our study had a larger total number 
of subjects than the earlier studies; these differences likely explain 
why we found a significant effect of aging in contrast to earlier 
studies.
We explicitly note that our finding of a statistically signifi-
cant effect of age on yaw rotation thresholds required both our 
two-segment model and more than 50 subjects. Our transla-
tion threshold findings showed more substantial age effects. 
 
These findings are consistent with earlier findings that translation 
thresholds increase with age (16–19). No previous studies have 
examined roll-tilt thresholds, which is a focus of our study (i.e., 
40% of the data reported).
The second primary finding was that increasing roll-tilt 
threshold was correlated with failure to complete the Romberg 
foam balance test. Since we know of no mechanism by which bal-
ance would impact vestibular thresholds, and since we know that 
balance depends on vestibular function [e.g., Ref. (44)] and that 
falls correlate with failure to complete the Romberg foam balance 
test (25), it is reasonable to suggest that this correlation shows 
that fall risk is substantially impacted by vestibular function. We 
emphasize that this was true even when measured in a healthy 
population chosen without any evidence of specific vestibular 
disorders.
Finally, while we did not report a full analysis of the within 
subject correlations between thresholds in different axes, our 
initial analyses showed that 9 of the 10 pairwise comparisons (all 
but the correlation of yaw rotation thresholds with y-translation 
thresholds) of the 5 threshold measurements were correlated 
(p < 0.05); we plan to make this topic the focus of a future 
manuscript as soon as we complete extensive analyses of these 
correlations. A more detailed discussion of our findings and the 
implications are presented below.
sex Differences and individual Differences
One goal when conducting this study was to determine whether 
there were sex differences in vestibular perceptual thresholds. 
According to our findings, there were no differences between 
males and females in their perceptual thresholds; this finding is 
in line with other studies comparing sex differences (8, 16, 17, 26).
Benson and colleagues previously published a pair of compre-
hensive threshold studies (7, 8). These studies looked at rotational 
thresholds (8) and translational thresholds (7). For the 4 motions 
 11

studied with 24 or more subjects, all demonstrated a range of 
thresholds with a ratio of roughly 10 for all 4 motions (i.e., the 
maximum threshold divided by the minimum threshold was 
about 10). In decibel units, Benson reported SDs of 4.40 (yaw 
rotation), 4.63 (X-translation), 3.98 (Y-translation), and 6.10 
(Z-translation). When converted to decibels our experimental SDs 
were 4.11 (yaw rotation), 5.23 (Y-translation), 6.47 (Z-translation), 
4.62 (1.0-Hz roll tilt), and 4.36 (0.2-Hz roll tilt), which appear 
similar to Benson’s. These similar empiric variations reported by 
both studies are most likely due to intersubject differences since 
variations due to sampling and other methodological details have 
been shown to be an order of magnitude smaller for 100 binary 
forced-choice trials (29) than these empirical variations.
Motion Differences
Next, we looked at differences in perceptual thresholds for the 
various motion stimuli. We found differences in several of the 
motion thresholds that we tested. Namely, we found that the 
threshold for y-translation was less than the threshold for z-trans-
lation, by approximately a factor of 2. This finding is consistent 
with MacNeilage et al. who indicated that utricles may have a 
greater sensitivity to perceive horizontal motion compared to the 
saccules’ sensitivity to perceive vertical motion (45). This sugges-
tion carries more weight when we also consider that the utricles 
have a greater density of hair cells compared to the saccules (46). 
It is possible that the additional hair cells in the utricles could 
contribute to their sensitivity and therefore lower the y-threshold. 
Furthermore, Valko et al. suggest that earth-vertical movement 
is more difficult to discriminate as the otolith must determine 
whether the gravitational force increases or decreases, whereas for 
an earth-horizontal movement, the body and brain have access to 
a greater amount of non-vestibular cues to aid in determining 
the direction of a particular motion (20). Overall, there are many 
differences between earth-vertical and earth-horizontal move-
ments; it is possible that the amount of information (e.g., tactile) 
available during earth-horizontal movement provides easier per-
ception and recognition of the motion direction compared to the 
amount of information available when moving along the z-axis.
When we divided the data by age group, the threshold veloc-
ity for roll tilt at 0.2 Hz was less than the threshold velocity for 
1-Hz roll tilt. This is consistent with Valko et al.’s study, where 
the researchers found that roll-tilt thresholds, expressed as peak 
velocity, decreased at lower frequencies in healthy subjects (20).
Furthermore, the threshold for roll tilt at 1 Hz was also lower 
than the yaw threshold. Because roll tilt is perceived by an integra-
tion of otolith and semicircular canals, the amount of information 
available to the vestibular system may facilitate the perception of 
motion compared to the yaw rotation which primarily relies on 
the semicircular canals.
ages for Perceptual cutoffs
Finally, because we saw that thresholds for each motion condi-
tion increased from decade to decade after about age 40, we 
thought it would be interesting to determine whether there was 
one specific age at which the perceptual thresholds began to 
increase for all five motion paradigms. By modeling the data we 
collected in this study, we found that we were able to separate 
vestibular thresholds into two categories, namely, “younger” 
and “older” adults, where younger adults’ thresholds were stable 
until about 40 years of age, at which point “older” adult vestibular 
performance began to decline (i.e., thresholds began to increase) 
at a steady rate for each of the motion thresholds. Between this 
finding and findings from other studies (16, 18, 47), we can 
directly assert that changes in vestibular function occur with age. 
While increasing age above the age cutoff was associated with 
an increase in threshold in each motion condition, some condi-
tions were impacted more than others: z-translation thresholds 
increased by ~83% of the baseline per decade after the age cutoff, 
roll tilt 1 Hz by 56%/decade, y-translation by 46%/decade, roll tilt 
0.2 Hz 32%/decade, and yaw rotation 15%/decade. These rates 
of increased thresholds with aging are for the subset of subjects 
that passed the balance test, but the values when including all 
subjects are similar.
Vestibular system aging
Vestibular functioning can decline for any number of reasons 
including neurodegenerative disease, peripheral loss, and even 
medications and their side effects. Age is an important factor 
that influences the vestibular system and vestibular function. 
While the mechanisms behind aging remain disputed, it is an 
important and relevant issue to address here. While others have 
considered the mechanisms of aging and its particular effect on 
the vestibular system (48), we would like to expand on what has 
previously been proposed by comparing age-related changes in 
the vestibular system to other systems, by discussing potential 
mechanisms, and consider why little or no threshold difference 
occur before the age of 40.
Comparison to Other Modalities
We report that – for five different tests of vestibular function – 
perceptual thresholds appeared constant between the ages of 20 
and 40 and increased linearly above the age of 40. A roughly simi-
lar pattern has been reported for other sensory systems but with 
the functional performance plateau lasting until the age of 60. For 
example, average odor identification shows a plateau until about 
the age of 60 with functional declines evident above the age of 60 
(37). As shown in Figure 2 of Doty, visual acuity (38) and speech 
intelligibility (39) show similar patterns including declines above 
the age of about 60. It is interesting to note that the functional 
decline appears to begin about two decades earlier for vestibular 
function than for smell, vision, or speech intelligibility. This may 
indicate that vestibular function is preferentially targeted by 
whatever mechanism(s) causes functional sensory loss with age 
(e.g., vestibular threshold increases with age).
Mechanism
The threshold variations were qualitatively similar across all con-
ditions; this suggests at least one shared common cause. The fact 
that the functional decline pattern (i.e., roughly linear threshold 
increase begins to occur around age 40 for all conditions) is about 
the same for all conditions tested weighs against an “overstimula-
tion” cause like that reported for hearing loss (49–51), though 
 12

that certainly does not mean that hearing loss and functional 
vestibular loss cannot share another (or other) mechanism(s).
No explanation, including our common cause explanation, 
can explain the quantitative differences across motions (e.g., why 
do z-translation thresholds demonstrate a slope of more 80% 
while yaw rotation a 15% slope?) at this time. One simple explana-
tion is that these do not share a common cause. Alternatively, 
these deficits could reflect a common cause with the quantitative 
differences due to (a) the amount of available redundancy, which 
may vary for different motions, (b) the baseline, which obviously 
impacts this relative slope measure, and/or (c) other mechanisms 
in addition to a cause common to all motions.
Several studies have reported human vestibular hair cell and 
vestibular afferent neuron counts as a function of age (46, 52). 
Vestibular hair cell loss has been reported to show a linear decline 
with age from birth through 100 years of age that does not directly 
match our threshold data, especially the constant threshold pla-
teau we report below age 40. This argues against hair cell loss in 
isolation being a direct explanation of the threshold age pattern 
we report. Similarly, the loss of afferent neurons does not in isola-
tion match the threshold age pattern we report.
Therefore, we will briefly consider another (possibly related) 
cause – the free radical theory of aging, which is probably the 
most persistent theory of aging and could explain why perfor-
mance declines begin to be evident for vestibular thresholds 
around the age of 40 but later for some other sensory functions. 
Specifically, we note that in primates, the average firing rate of 
peripheral afferent neurons is nearly 100 spikes per second, with 
the resting rate reported as averaging 91.3 spikes per second for 
the semicircular canals (53) and 62.7 spikes per second for the 
otolith organs – 79.1 for superior nerve and 47.0 for inferior 
nerve (54). These resting rates average between 50 and 100 spikes 
per second across about 40,000 vestibular afferent neurons (40) 
and, hence, assert a substantial metabolic load. While the rest-
ing rate for individual neurons in the vestibular nuclei is a bit 
lower, the central vestibular system similarly asserts a substantial 
metabolic load [e.g., Ref. (55)].
A metabolic-related cascade that could lead to age-related 
vestibular threshold increases is sketched in the following para-
graphs. The heavy metabolic load of the vestibular system – both 
central and peripheral vestibular systems – requires extensive 
ATP production via mitochondria. Since mitochondria are the 
biggest contributors of oxidative load (i.e., free radicals) to the 
body, this leads directly to a relatively large oxidative stress. Many 
of these free radicals are quenched. Others escape and cause 
damage distributed elsewhere. But some of these free radicals 
cause local damage. This local damage can lead to dysfunctional 
central and/or peripheral function. This proposed mechanism 
would be consistent with studies showing oxidative contribu-
tions to peripheral cochlear dysfunction [e.g., Ref. (56)]. When 
the vestibular functional loss (i.e., neuronal cell death and/or 
dysfunction) leads to more “signal” loss than “noise” loss, it would 
lead to increased perceptual thresholds.
A review of the evidence for/against the free radical theory of 
aging and other theories of aging is beyond the scope of this paper 
but can be found in various books/reviews [e.g., Ref. (57–59)] We 
simply note here that the most recent incarnation (60, 61) of the 
free radical theory of aging (59, 62, 63) would be consistent with 
the cascade described above. If the free radical theory of aging 
is the major contributor to the deficit observed in thresholds 
above the age of 40, this could make vestibular threshold changes 
a relatively simple, sensitive, non-invasive behavioral biomarker 
for aging in humans above the age of 40, especially, since, as noted 
earlier, the age effects for vestibular function appear earlier than 
for odor discrimination, visual acuity, or speech intelligibility.
Why Are No Threshold Changes  
Evident below the Age 40?
Small threshold changes below the age of 40 may be evident for 
an individual but were masked by intersubject variability, since 
our study was not longitudinal. Long-term longitudinal studies 
would likely show whether threshold changes occur in individual 
humans before the age of 40.
While speculative, the free radical mechanism described 
earlier could also be consistent with the relative threshold con-
stancy before age 40. Let us assume that vestibular contributions 
are crucial and that oxidative neuronal cell loss due to cell death 
or neuronal dysfunction is inevitable. If true, one reasonable 
evolutionary strategy would be to have an excess of neurons at 
least till reproductive vigor started to wane. In other words, some 
neuronal cell loss occurs before age 40, but the available excess of 
vestibular neurons yields redundancy such that the incremental 
decrease in overall signal matches the incremental decrease in 
overall noise for each vestibular neuron lost due to dysfunction 
or death. But around age 40, the vestibular cell counts reduce to 
the point that each neuron loss causes more incremental signal 
loss than noise loss. If true, this would suggest that we have on 
the order of 40,000 vestibular afferent neurons to provide some 
redundancy to fend off functional impact of peripheral vestibular 
loss. Such peripheral redundancy could also explain why thresh-
olds as a function of age do not match the aging patterns shown 
by vestibular afferent neuron counts (52, 64) or vestibular hair cell 
counts as a function of age (46, 64). Furthermore, this hypothesis 
could account for different quantitative aging patterns reported 
herein (i.e., Z-translation slope much greater than yaw rotation 
slope relative to baseline) for different movements.
implications
Our threshold data showed that vestibular thresholds broadly 
increased with age above the age of 40 (by 15–83% per decade 
depending upon the motion condition, p < 0.05 for all five thresh-
old measures). Furthermore, our data showed that balance test 
failures increased significantly as roll-tilt thresholds increased – 
 
even when age and other factors were fully considered by our 
mixed-model analysis. This latter finding is important because an 
earlier study showed that failure to complete the Romberg foam 
balance test correlates highly with falls (25). More specifically, 
data from a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) were analyzed to show that 35.4% of American 
subjects above the age of 40 were unable to stand on foam with 
their eyes closed – the exact same failure that we showed to be 
significantly correlated with increasing roll-tilt thresholds. The 
earlier study (25) also reported increased odds of falling – an 
 13

odds ratio of 6.3 – for such individuals with subclinical vestibular 
dysfunction relative to those without dysfunction (i.e., individu-
als who were able to complete the balance testing successfully).
Given different definitions and different methods, these 
American findings are neither far from the findings of a German 
study that estimated prevalence of vertigo to be 22.9% (65) nor 
from self-reported vertigo prevalence rates of about 20% (66, 67). 
 
In fact, self-reported dizziness for the American study was 
27.0% – certainly in line with the earlier estimates. For the frac-
tion of such symptomatic individuals with measured vestibular 
dysfunction, the American study reported increased odds of 
falling – i.e., an odds ratio of 12.3. Our findings of a decrement in 
vestibular function – directly assessed via vestibular thresholds – 
above the age of 40 could certainly help explain why 35% of the 
NHANES population above the age of 40 demonstrated balance 
dysfunction.
Given the clear evidence presented herein that vestibular func-
tion declines with age above the age of 40 and given the relative 
consistency of the earlier estimates of vestibular and balance 
dysfunction (25, 65–67), it seems reasonable to try to make a 
conservative estimate of the number of people who might die 
each year due to vestibular dysfunction. For example, it seems 
likely that at least some of the transportation accidents (e.g., car 
crashes) that lead to the death of about 50,000 Americans each 
year (39) are due to vestibular dysfunction, but, unfortunately, 
we were unable to find enough relevant data at this time to 
estimate the contributions of vestibular dysfunction to motor 
vehicle accidents. On the other hand, available data do allow us 
to conservatively estimate the number of deaths each year caused 
by falls related to vestibular dysfunction. These calculations are 
provided in detail in Appendix A. Table A1 in Appendix provides 
a range of estimates – some more conservative and some less so. 
The annual death estimates correlated with vestibular dysfunc-
tion range from 48,000 to 152,000.2 While the largest estimate of 
nearly 152,000 deaths per year may prove inaccurate, it is worth 
noting that this would be placed third in the US behind only heart 
disease and cancer. Even the lowest estimate of ~48,000 deaths 
per year – which would place this as the tenth largest cause of 
death in the US – conveys the gravity of the problem.
We emphasize that estimating death rates was not a goal of 
our study but rather an implication of the finding – even after 
2 A reviewer helpfully suggested that the paper might be better off without the 
appendix. After dialog engendered by the Frontier’s process, this footnote has been 
added to specifically note that we all agree that (a) the estimated range is large 
because available data do not allow solid estimates, (b) the issue was too important 
to gloss over by ignoring it, (c) the only way to resolve the matter is to obtain better 
data, and (d) including these broad estimates is likely to encourage the acquisition 
and analysis of better data. 
correcting for age effects – that the proportion of balance test 
failures increased with roll-tilt thresholds, especially at 0.2 Hz 
(p = 0.0007); 1 unit increase in roll-tilt thresholds (log-transformed 
version) corresponded to a 5.6-fold increase in the odds of fail-
ing the balance test. We further emphasize that extrapolating the 
current data to fall risk has limitations. Nonetheless, the range 
of estimated deaths potentially due to vestibular dysfunction 
(Table A1 in Appendix) suggests the scope of the problem and 
highlights the need for broader epidemiologic studies focused on 
mortality associated with vestibular dysfunction.
We close this implications section by juxtaposing some facts 
discussed above. (1) Data showed that vestibular thresholds, 
including roll-tilt thresholds, broadly increased with age above 
the age of 40 (by 15–83% per decade depending upon the motion 
condition). (2) Analyses showed that balance test failures, which 
have previously been shown to correlate highly with falls (25), 
increased significantly as roll-tilt thresholds increased. (3) 
Calculations suggested that vestibular dysfunction could possibly 
be ranked somewhere between the third and tenth biggest killer 
of Americans. Even in isolation, this is alarming. But, given the 
rapid aging of the world’s population [e.g., Ref. (68)], the problem 
will rapidly grow much worse unless existing efforts to improve 
vestibular screening, vestibular diagnoses, vestibular treatments, 
balance treatments, fall prediction, and fall prevention are 
accelerated.
Brief summary
We measured vestibular perceptual thresholds in 105 healthy 
humans (54F/51M) ranging from 18 to 80 years of age. We found 
that thresholds significantly increased above the age of 40 for all 
five motion directions investigated. Even taking age and other 
factors into consideration, we found a significant correlation of 
balance test failures with increasing roll-tilt thresholds.

a. estimating annual Fatalities related to 
Vestibular Dysfunction
According to the CDC online web-based injury statistics query 
and reporting (69), 26,734 persons over 40 years of age died in 
the US in 2011 as a direct result of unintentional falls. This is 
consistent with a National Vital Statistics Report (70) that stated 
that 26,009 persons died in the US in 2010 as a direct result 
of unintentional falls. Of course, only some of the 26,734 fall-
related deaths were due to vestibular dysfunction. To provide this 
estimate of deaths related to vestibular dysfunction, some simple 
calculations are required. Such calculations require that we know 
(a) the prevalence of vestibular dysfunction and (b) the increased 
risk of fall due to vestibular dysfunction, both of which were 
discussed earlier. Specifically, we will use (a) the 35.4% estimate 
of prevalence provided by Agrawal et al. (25), because it is the 
most comprehensive broad assessment based on objective meas-
ures, and (b) the reported odds ratio of 6.3 for those individuals 
over the age of 40 defined as having vestibular dysfunction 
using the balance metric (25), because it arises from the same 
comprehensive data set. We note that using these estimates yield 
a smaller (i.e., more conservative) estimated death rate than if 
we used the 27% prevalence rate for vestibular dysfunction with 
clinical symptomology with the 12.3 odds ratio for falls in this 
population.
If the total pertinent population at a point in time is x, then 
35.4% (0.354x) have vestibular dysfunction and 64.6% (0.646x) 
do not. Let us represent the risk of falling without vestibular 
dysfunction as w. Then, the risk of falling with vestibular dysfunc-
tion [as defined by Agrawal et al. (25)] is 6.3 times higher (6.3w). 
While it can be argued that the risk of a bad fall for those with 
vestibular dysfunction is likely higher than for those with normal 
function, we conservatively assume that the risk of death due to 
a fall is independent of vestibular status (y). The total number of 
US deaths directly due to falls (26734) equals the sum of deaths 
in those with vestibular dysfunction (0.354 × 6.3 w x y = 2.23z) 
and those without vestibular dysfunction (0.646 w x y = 0.646z), 
where z = w x y, so 26,734 = 2.23z + 0.646z. This can be solved 
for z, which equals 9296; therefore, 26,734 = 2.23(9296) +  
0.646(9296); thus, we can estimate that 20,729 (2.23 × 9296) 
equals the number of fall deaths in those individuals with ves-
tibular dysfunction. Of course, these individuals had a chance of 
falling independent of their vestibular status. By definition, this 
risk is the same as for individuals without vestibular dysfunction, 
so 3,291 (0.354 × 9296) of these would have fallen independent of 
their vestibular dysfunction, leaving an estimated 17,438 deaths 
directly attributable to falls due to vestibular dysfunction. These 
calculations suggest that 65% of deaths directly attributable to 
falls are related to vestibular dysfunction (We note that death due 
to falling is relatively rare; so, risk and odds here would be nearly 
equivalent).
But falls also indirectly lead to death. For example, falls cause 
hip fractures, among other injuries, and hip fracture has a high 
mortality rate following fracture. There were 306,000 hospital 
admissions for hip fractures in 2010 (71), and it has been 
estimated that more than 95% are due to falls (72). One study 
reported that the overall 1-year post-fracture mortality rate was 
27.3% and further reported that mortality after hip fracture at 
the end of the follow-up was 79.0% (73). If we conservatively 
use the 1-year mortality rate of 27.3%, this suggests that more 
than 79,361 patients die each year following hospitalization for 
a hip fracture. Repeating the exact same calculations outlined 
in the previous paragraph, we estimate that there may be 51,767 
deaths correlated with falls (i.e., following hip fracture) that 
are related to vestibular dysfunction. As for the calculations in 
the previous paragraph, some fraction of these deaths is unre-
lated to the fall and hip fracture. The same study reported an 
average death risk ratio of 3.26 in this hip fracture population 
relative to an age-matched population. Analogous to the above 
calculations, the total number of deaths equals those related to 
the hip fracture and those that would have occurred anyway 
(51,767 = 3.26v + v), yielding the estimated number of deaths 
related to the hip fracture as 39,615. Simply summing these two 
death estimate numbers (i.e., the number of fall deaths directly 
and indirectly related to vestibular dysfunction) yields an esti-
mate that vestibular dysfunction contributes to 57,053 deaths 
each year.
Given the conservative nature of these estimates (using only 
1-year hip fracture mortality, not including traffic and other non-
fall accidents, using the lower odds ratio, etc.), these estimates 
suggest that vestibular dysfunction likely contributes to more 
than 57,000 deaths each year. If categorized this way, according 
to a national vital statistics report (74), this would rank number 
10 on the list of leading causes of death in 2010 behind heart 
disease (598,000), cancer (575,000), chronic respiratory diseases 
(138,000), stroke (129,000), accidents (121,000), Alzheimer’s 
(83,000), and diabetes (69,000). Table A1 in Appendix provides 
a range of estimates – some more conservative and some less so. 
The annual death estimates correlated with vestibular dysfunc-
tion range from 48,000 to 152,000.

The top row shows the values described in detail in the text. The second row changes only the prevalence for vestibular function accompanied by clinical symptomology and the 
matching odds ratio from the American study (25). The third row uses the prevalence reported in the German study (65) with the most conservative odds ratio of 6.3 from the 
American study (25). The next three rows repeat the calculations from the first three rows but now using the hip fracture mortality rate of 79% at the end of follow-up (73).
