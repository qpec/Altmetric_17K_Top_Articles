Background: Probiotics may help to prevent symptoms of anxiety and depression through several putative mech-
anisms.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (HN001) given in
pregnancy and postpartum on symptoms of maternal depression and anxiety in the postpartum period. This
was a secondary outcome, the primary outcome being eczema in the offspring at 12 months of age.
Design, Setting, Participants: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of HN001 on post-
natal mood was conducted in 423 women in Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand. Women were recruited at
14–16 weeks gestation.
Intervention: Women were randomised to receive either placebo or HN001 daily from enrolment until 6 months
postpartum if breastfeeding.
Outcome Measures: Modified versions of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State Trait Anxiety Inven-
tory were used to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety postpartum.
Trial Registration: Australia NZ Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12612000196842.
Findings: 423 women were recruited between December 2012 and November 2014. 212 women were randomised
to HN001 and 211 to placebo. 380 women (89.8%) completed the questionnaire on psychological outcomes, 193
(91.0%) in the treatment group and 187 (88.6%) in the placebo group. Mothers in the probiotic treatment group re-
ported significantly lower depression scores (HN001 mean = 7·7 (SD = 5·4), placebo 9·0 (6·0); effect size -1·2,
(95% CI -2·3, -0·1), p = 0·037) and anxiety scores (HN001 12·0 (4·0), placebo 13·0 (4·0); effect size -1·0 (-1·9,
-0·2), p = 0·014) than those in the placebo group. Rates of clinically relevant anxiety on screening (score
N 15) were significantly lower in the HN001 treated mothers (OR = 0·44 (0·26, 0·73), p = 0·002).
Interpretation: Women who received HN001 had significantly lower depression and anxiety scores in the
postpartum period. This probiotic may be useful for the prevention or treatment of symptoms of depression
and anxiety postpartum.

1. Introduction
Major depression in pregnancy and after birth occurs in 10–15% of
women in New Zealand, a rate comparable to other western countries
(Abbott and Williams, 2006). Postnatal depression (PND) is associated
with persistent depression, and even, in a few cases each year, death
from suicide (PMMRC, 2014). This disorder may affect a mother's ability
to care for and bond with her new infant, as well as her quality of life
and daily functioning (Da Costa et al., 2006). In addition, maternal de-
pression can produce long-lasting effects on children's cognitive,
social-emotional and health outcomes (Tronick and Reck, 2009; Grace

 et al., 2003). In addition to depressed mood, PND is associated with
hopelessness, excessive fatigue, psychomotor agitation, appetite and
sleep disturbances, guilt, or feelings of inadequacy, particularly regard-
ing one's ability to care for the newborn and co-morbid anxiety. Anxiety
often coexists with depression and like PND, the prevalence varies
widely depending on the timing and the type of disorder (generalised
anxiety disorder (GAD) vs obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)) and
the way it is measured (self-report vs structured interview). Despite
this, most women with PND are either not recognised as being de-
pressed, are unable to access psychological therapy or are reluctant to
take antidepressant medication in pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
Furthermore it takes several weeks for the therapeutic effect of antide-
pressants to appear and there is a 15–30% discontinuation rate
(Gartlehner et al., 2005). Safe and effective therapies to prevent and
treat PND are needed (Battle et al., 2003).
A “healthy” diet comprising higher intakes of fruit and vegetables,
whole grains and lean meat and fish is associated with a reduced likeli-
hood of depression (Lai et al., 2013). These observational studies are
supported by a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) showing that
a dietary improvement intervention was effective as an adjuvant thera-
py in patients with moderate to severe depression who were being
treated with psychotherapy or antidepressants (Jacka et al., 2017). Fur-
thermore, it has been suggested that fermented foods alter dietary
items before they are ingested, resulting in phytochemical transforma-
tion into bioactive chemicals which reduce oxidative stress and inflam-
mation (Selhub et al., 2014).
There is a growing literature linking the gut microbiota to brain
chemistry and behaviour via multiple bi-directional pathways (the
microbiome-gut-brain axis), including the immune system, neuroendo-
crine, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA axis), short chain fatty
acids or tryptophan and sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the
autonomic nervous system including the enteric nervous system, the
vagus nerve, and the gut microbiota (Wang and Kasper, 2014; Dinan
and Cryan, 2015). Microbial dysbiosis is associated with many health
problems including neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spec-
trum disorder, depression and anxiety, and are associated with elevated
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased oxidative stress, altered
gastrointestinal (GI) function, and lowered micronutrient and omega-3
fatty acid status (Dawson et al., 2016). Intriguingly, alterations in the
pattern of gut microbial composition in healthy adults influences
mood (Li et al., 2016).
Probiotics are live microorganisms that when consumed in adequate
amounts provide health benefits to the host (Hill et al., 2014). In 2005 it
was first suggested that probiotics might be an adjuvant therapy for
major depression (Logan and Katzman, 2005) and others have also sug-
gested that probiotic enhancement of gut microbiota may improve
mood outcomes (Dinan and Cryan, 2016). Pre-clinical studies have
demonstrated that the anxiety phenotype of mice can be changed
with fecal transplantation and that the changes in microbiota are ac-
companied by changes in brain chemistry (Collins et al., 2013). Further-
more, probiotic treatment has also been shown to have a positive effect
on anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviour in animal studies (Bravo
et al., 2011; Desbonnet et al., 2010), with mediating mechanisms in-
cluding GABA receptor expression in specific locations of the central
nervous system (Bravo et al., 2011), the HPA axis (Desbonnet et al.,
2010) and the vagus nerve which transmits information from the gut
luminal environment to the CNS (Carabotti et al., 2015). Interestingly,
probiotic supplementation in adults has not been found to substantially
alter their gut microbiota as sampled by fecal samples (Kristensen et al.,
2016), although this does not exclude their potential effect higher up in
the small intestine or on the adherent mucosal gut microbiome.
Clinical trials of probiotic treatment have yielded mixed results, and
systematic reviews of human trials concluded that the evidence for ben-
eficial effects of probiotics on mood may not be as strong as some recent
narrative studies purport (Romijn and Rucklidge, 2015). A recent sys-
tematic review identified 10 clinical trials of the effect of probiotics on
symptoms of depression (Wallace and Milev, 2017). Seven studies
were in healthy subjects, 2 in chronic fatigue syndrome and one in de-
pression. Three of 5 studies reported improved mood with probiotics,
and 5 of 7 studies reported improvements in stress and anxiety. A recent
study that was published after these reviews reported that obese
women treated with a weight-reduction programme and probiotic
had reduced symptoms of depression compared with the comparison
group, but this effect was not seen in men (Sanchez et al., 2017).
There was no effect on anxiety. Both reviews suggested further RCTs
were needed. To date probiotic effects on postnatal depression have
not been studied in a clinical trial.
Our aim was to evaluate whether probiotic supplementation with
Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (HN001) had a beneficial effect on post-
natal symptoms of depression and anxiety in a group of healthy women.
This was a secondary outcome, the primary outcome being eczema in
the offspring at 12 months of age.
2. Methods and Materials
2.1. Study Design
The Probiotics in Pregnancy Study (PIP Study) is a two-centre
(Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand) randomised double-blind
placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of the probiotic HN001 on
the development of eczema and atopic sensitization in offspring (the
primary outcome) and pregnancy outcomes (secondary outcomes) in
women. The full protocol is published (Barthow et al., 2016).
2.2. Study Population
The selection of participants, randomisation process and quality con-
trol measures have been described in detail previously (Barthow et al.,
2016). In brief, 423 women were recruited at 14–16 weeks gestation be-
tween December 2012 and November 2014. 212 women were
randomised to HN001 and 211 to placebo. Women were considered el-
igible if they were English-speaking, planning to breastfeed, and if either
they or the unborn child's biological father had a history of asthma,
hayfever or eczema requiring medication. Women were excluded
from the study if aged b16 years, planning to move outside the study
centres during study duration, planning on taking probiotics, or if they
had serious medical or health problems related to the pregnancy.
2.3. The Intervention
Women were randomised to receive either HN001 at a dose of 6
× 109 colony-forming units (cfu) or placebo (corn-derived maltodex-
trin), to be taken daily from enrolment until birth and, from birth up
till six months post-birth whilst breastfeeding. The capsules were indis-
tinguishable. Both researchers and participants were blinded to treat-
ment assignation of participants. To assess adherence, capsule bottles
were collected at regular intervals and counts of remaining capsules
were completed by an independent person.
2.4. Randomisation
Randomisation was managed by Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd.
and concealed from all study staff and participants. Randomisation
was stratified by study centre and performed in blocks of random
lengths according to a computer-generated randomisation list. Research
staff screened and enrolled eligible participants, and provided enrolled
participants with the next available sequentially-numbered capsule
container.

 2.5. Data Collection
Mothers were interviewed at baseline (14–16 weeks gestation) to
collect information about maternal characteristics and demographics.
When children were aged 6 months and approximately 12 months
old, mothers visited the research centres or were visited at home and
were invited to complete a questionnaire about their psychological
wellbeing, thinking back to when their child was 1–2 months of age. If
children were older than 12 months when the questionnaire was
being used, mothers were posted the questionnaire or invited to com-
plete it online via a secure link. Mothers and researchers remained
blind to treatment assignation of participants at all follow-up stages of
the study.
2.6. Primary Outcomes
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS): The EPDS is a 10 item
screening questionnaire widely used to assess maternal mood (Cox
et al., 1987). For the purposes of analysis, the standard cut-off of N12
was used to identify mothers at higher risk of postnatal depression.
State Trait Anxiety Inventory 6 item version (STAI6): The STAI6 is a
short 6 item scale validated as an anxiety screening questionnaire
based on the longer State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Marteau and
Bekker, 1992). A cut-off score N 15 was used as an indicator of clinically
significant levels of anxiety.
For both the EPDS and the STAI6 the questions were altered to use
the past tense as mothers were asked to remember back to when
their child was 1–2 months old and complete the questions based on
how they were feeling at that time. It should be noted that the modified
questionnaires have not been validated.
2.7. Explanatory Variable
Infant Colic: Infant colic was assessed at the 6 month interview
when mothers were asked if they had contacted a health professional
because their child had colic at any time between birth and six months
of age.
2.8. Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
With a sample size of 200 in each group and 13% drop-out rate the
study had a 79% power to detect a 26% reduction in EPDS at the 5%
level of significance.
Data were analysed as intent-to-treat. Adherence was calculated as
the number of capsules taken as a proportion of the expected number
taken. Statistical analysis was conducted in SAS 9.4 using a generalised
linear model for the continuous outcomes and logistic regression for
categorical outcomes. Multivariable analysis of the relationship be-
tween probiotic supplementation and postnatal depression and anxiety
scores, adjusted for the time since birth at which the questionnaires
were completed and infant colic.
The trial was registered at the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials
Registry: ACTRN12612000196842.
2.9. Ethics
The study received ethical approval from the New Zealand Multire-
gional Ethics Committee (MEC/11/09/77). Participants gave written in-
formed consent. The study conforms to the standards indicated by the
Declaration of Helsinki.
2.10. Role of Funding Sources
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection,
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The
corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and
had final responsibility for the decision to submit.
3. Results
Fig. 1 shows the numbers assessed for eligibility, the number exclud-
ed, and the number eligible, recruited and allocated in the PIP Study. Of
the 423 randomised women, 380 (89.8%) completed the psychological
outcome measures, 193 (91.0%) were in the treatment group and 187
(88.6%) in the placebo group. Of the 380 participants in this study, 11
completed the questionnaires at the 6 month infant visit, 112 complet-
ed them at the 12 month infant visit and the remaining 257 completed
the measures online at a median child age of 2·1 years (IQR 1·8–2·4).
One participant did not complete all questions in the anxiety question-
naire, and the STAI6 score was recorded as missing.
Table 1 shows the maternal characteristics of the study participants.
Of particular note there was little difference in the use of medications
for psychological problems prior to the index pregnancy.
The median adherence to allocated treatment did not differ (probi-
otic 92·3% (IQR = 83·9–97·2%), placebo 91·1% (IQR = 81·8–96·9%;
p = 0·30)).
Depression and anxiety scores tended to increase with increasing in-
terval between delivery and when the questionnaire was completed
(depression score increased by 0·85 per year, p = 0·065; anxiety
score increased by 0·66 per year, p = 0·060). Infant colic was associat-
ed with higher depression (multivariable p b 0·0001) and anxiety (mul-
tivariable p b 0·0001) scores, but was not significantly associated with
probiotic supplementation group (p = 0·456).
Table 2 shows the mean and standard deviation of depression
and anxiety scores in the probiotic treatment and placebo groups.
Mothers in the probiotic treatment group reported significantly
lower depression scores (HN001 mean = 7·7 (SD = 5·4), placebo
9·0 (6·0), effect size -1·2, (95% CI -2·4, -0·1), p = 0·035)
and anxiety scores (HN001 12·0 (4·0) placebo 13·0 (4·3), effect size
-1·1 (-1·9, -0·2), p = 0·014) than those in the placebo group. After
controlling for infant colic and time since birth that questionnaires
were completed, probiotic supplementation remained significantly
associated with reduced depression (p = 0·037) and anxiety (p =
0·014) scores.
Table 3 shows the number of women in the probiotic treatment and
placebo groups who reported clinically significant depression or anxiety
scores (that is above the cut-off points). The number of women
reporting depression scores above the cut-off point did not differ signif-
icantly between the probiotic treatment and placebo groups (OR = 0.64
(0.38, 1.07), p = 0·086). However, women in the probiotic treatment
group were significantly less likely to have anxiety scores above the
cut-off point than the placebo group (OR = 0.44 (0.27, 0.73) p =
0·001), this association remained statistically significant after

 controlling for infant colic and time since birth at questionnaire comple-
tion (p = 0·002).
Use of medications for psychological problems during the index
pregnancy was low and did not differ between treatment groups
(HN001 3.6% vs. placebo 3.2%).
4. Discussion
This study demonstrated a significantly lower prevalence of symptoms
of depression and anxiety postpartum in women supplemented with the
probiotic HN001 during and after pregnancy than in those given a placebo.
Furthermore, the number of women reporting clinically significant levels
of anxiety on screening was significantly lower in the probiotic group. To
our knowledge this is the first double-blind RCT of probiotics that has
evaluated symptoms of depression and anxiety in the postpartum period.
In addition, our sample size was substantially larger than many previously
reported RCTs of probiotics on mood and behaviour.
The finding that women supplemented with probiotics had fewer
symptoms of postnatal anxiety and depression is consistent with two
previous clinical studies of the effect of probiotics on mood in different
populations. A RCT of 40 people with major depressive disorder treated
with a combination of three probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacto-
bacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium bifidum) or placebo also found a sig-
nificant reduction in symptoms of depression on the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI) in the treatment group (Akkasheh et al., 2016). A reduc-
tion in anxiety symptoms in a sample of 39 chronic fatigue patients
randomised to receive Lactobacillus casei or placebo has also been re-
ported, but the same study did not find a reduction in symptoms of de-
pression on the BDI in the treatment group (Rao et al., 2009). However,
not all studies have demonstrated a significant positive effect of probiot-
ic treatment on mood outcomes (Romijn and Rucklidge, 2015; Romijn
et al., 2017). A recent study involving 69 subjects who successfully com-
pleted the study found no evidence that a probiotic preparation (con-
taining Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum) for
8 weeks was effective in treating adults with moderate scores on self-
reported symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety (Rao et al.,
2009). The diversity of study populations, including those with schizo-
phrenia (Dickerson et al., 2014) smokers(Reale et al., 2012), and irrita-
ble bowel syndrome patients (Dapoigny et al., 2012), the range of
probiotic strains used, varying length of treatment, small sample sizes
and varying measures of mood make it difficult, if not impossible, to un-
dertake any meta-analysis of these studies. It is clear that more large
studies of probiotic treatment are needed including those that measure
psychological outcomes.
In our study infant colic was associated with higher depression and
anxiety scores. There has been a suggestion in the literature that probi-
otic supplementation may benefit maternal mood by reducing infant
colic. One study reported that direct probiotic supplementation of in-
fants reduced infant colic and this in turn was associated with lower
rates of maternal depression (Mi et al., 2015). While infants in our
study are likely to have been exposed to a small amount of probiotic in-
directly, either in utero or via breastmilk, they were not administered
the probiotic directly; furthermore, we found that prevalence of infant
colic did not differ between the probiotic and placebo groups and
hence there was little difference in the effect size when adjusted for in-
fant colic. Multivariable analysis showed that probiotic supplementa-
tion and absence of infant colic were independently associated with
lower postnatal depression and anxiety scores.
The prevalence of scores for depression and anxiety above the cut-
off at 1–2 months post-partum in this study was higher than the 10%
to 15% usually reported. In part, this may be due to the mothers and
or fathers having a history of asthma, hayfever or eczema requiring
medication, as it is known that those with allergies are at higher risk
of mental health problems (Scott et al., 2007). It may also be due to
mothers in our study completing the questionnaire retrospectively. Pos-
sibly when mothers reflect back to how they felt 1 to 2 months after

 delivery, they realise how tiring caring for a newborn infant can be. In
studies that survey prevalence of PND at an early time point, women
may be less likely to rate themselves as depressed or anxious because
they are expecting to feel exhausted.
Despite the prevalence of high symptom scores, the number of
women who had medication for psychological problems in pregnancy
was low (3.4% of total study population). Our study did not explore
the reasons for this; however, it does support the contention that de-
pression and anxiety during pregnancy is unrecognised and not treated.
Mechanisms by which probiotic supplementation influence the
physiology of the brain, and thereby anxiety and depression, have
been proposed using animal models. Changes in the expression of the
neurotransmitter GABA receptors in regions of the mouse brain have
been demonstrated along with changes in anxiety-related behaviour
with L. rhamnosus treatment (Bravo et al., 2011). However, this relation-
ship was not evident in mice that had had their vagus nerve removed,
indicating that the vagus nerve might be the link between events in
the gut and altered GABA receptor expression. However, in another
study L. rhamnosus was not superior to placebo in modifying stress-
related measures in healthy adult human males highlighting the chal-
lenge of extrapolating from animal to human studies (Kelly et al.,
2017). Biochemical changes have been demonstrated in the HPA axis
in rats when exposed to maternal separation, which in turn were asso-
ciated with anxiety-related behaviours in the Forced Swim Test; these
behaviours were reversed when the animals were treated with
Bifidobacterium infantis (Collins et al., 2013).
Postnatal depression occurs more frequently in socio-economically
disadvantaged populations. In a previous study we found that PND
was more likely to occur in women who were single, b20 years of age,
Maori, were unhappy with their relationship with their partner, or
had a history of previous psychiatric hospitalisation (Webster et al.,
1994). National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was an obser-
vational study and found that probiotic foods or supplements were as-
sociated with a reduced risk of depression, but this was attenuated
and non-significant when adjusted for factors that were associated
with depression and probiotic exposure (Cepeda et al., 2017). This
may be a consequence of misclassification, as probiotic food and supple-
ment use over the 24 h period preceding data collection was used to de-
fine exposure and may not reflect usual intake. Our study was a RCT and
therefore the socioeconomic and other factors are randomly distributed
between the intervention and placebo group.
There are many different species and strains of probiotics.
L. rhamnosus HN001 was chosen for the beneficial effect on the primary
outcome, namely eczema (Wickens et al., 2008; Wickens et al., 2012;
Wickens et al., 2013). Many Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains
have been studied with respect to mental health and these genera
seem to show the most beneficial effects (Mayer et al., 2014).
Limitations of the study need to be considered. Firstly, the EPDS and
STAI6 are screening tools for PND and anxiety, but are not diagnostic. In
this report we have studied symptoms of PND and anxiety, as clinical
assessment and diagnosis of depression and anxiety were not undertak-
en. However, when the scores were categorised into higher risk of PND
and indicators of clinically significant levels of anxiety, similar findings
were seen. Secondly, the information regarding symptoms of PND and
anxiety was collected retrospectively, and neither the EPDS nor the
STAI6 has been validated using the questions phrased in the past
tense. While this may have resulted in an increase in measurement
error, it would not be expected to have introduced a differential bias
in responses. Furthermore, measurement error, if introduced, would
be more likely to move the results towards the null hypothesis of
there being no effect of probiotic on mood outcomes. The strength of
the study is the design (double-blind placebo-controlled study) with
substantial group size. It is a simple, cost effective and easily implement-
ed treatment. Furthermore, we have shown that this probiotic is safe
and well tolerated in pregnancy and infants (Dekker et al., 2009).
This study provides evidence that probiotic supplementation with
L. rhamnosus HN001 in pregnancy and postpartum reduces the preva-
lence of symptoms of PND and anxiety postpartum. Not all probiotic
strains have the same effect on health and it is possible that the results
found using HN001 are not generalisable to other probiotic strains, or at
lower doses than those used in this study. Furthermore, in a recent
study higher levels of anxiety-like behaviour and stress, as measured
by plasma corticosterone levels, were seen in young rats treated with
Lactobacillus casei or inulin (a prebiotic) compared with controls
(Barrera-Bugueño et al., 2017). Those treated with a L. casei and inulin
combination (synbiotic) had no anxiety-like behaviours. There are
many unanswered questions, including the choice of probiotic, the
dose and the duration of treatment. Can probiotics prevent the onset
of symptoms? Could probiotics be used as the primary treatment for
maternal mental health problems or should it be used as an adjuvant
treatment to standard therapy? Such studies might incorporate inflam-
matory markers, cortisol, or other objective markers,
If replicated by other studies, this probiotic may be useful for the
prevention or treatment of symptoms of depression and anxiety
postpartum.
