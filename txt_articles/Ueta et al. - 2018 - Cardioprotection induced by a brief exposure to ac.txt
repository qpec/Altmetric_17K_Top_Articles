Time for primary review: 35 days
Aims
We previously demonstrated that acute ethanol administration protects the heart from ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R)
injury thorough activation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). Here, we characterized the role of acetaldehyde,
an intermediate product from ethanol metabolism, and its metabolizing enzyme, ALDH2, in an ex vivo model of car-
diac I/R injury.
....................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
We used a combination of homozygous knock-in mice (ALDH2*2), carrying the human inactivating point mutation
ALDH2 (E487K), and a direct activator of ALDH2, Alda-1, to investigate the cardiac effect of acetaldehyde. The
ALDH2*2 mice have impaired acetaldehyde clearance, recapitulating the human phenotype. Yet, we found a similar
infarct size in wild type (WT) and ALDH2*2 mice. Similar to ethanol-induced preconditioning, pre-treatment with
50 lM acetaldehyde increased ALDH2 activity and reduced cardiac injury in hearts of WT mice without affecting
cardiac acetaldehyde levels. However, acetaldehyde pre-treatment of hearts of ALDH2*2 mice resulted in a three-
fold increase in cardiac acetaldehyde levels and exacerbated I/R injury. Therefore, exogenous acetaldehyde appears
to have a bimodal effect in I/R, depending on the ALDH2 genotype. Further supporting an ALDH2 role in cardiac
preconditioning, pharmacological ALDH2 inhibition abolished ethanol-induced cardioprotection in hearts of WT
mice, whereas a selective activator, Alda-1, protected ALDH2*2 against ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity. Finally,
either genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ALDH2 mitigated ischaemic preconditioning.
....................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Taken together, our findings suggest that low levels of acetaldehyde are cardioprotective whereas high levels are
damaging in an ex vivo model of I/R injury and that ALDH2 is a major, but not the only, regulator of cardiac acetal-
dehyde levels and protection from I/R.

1. Introduction
Humans are exposed to acetaldehyde generated from a wide variety of
sources, including endogenous metabolism, food, beverages, and envi-
ronment. Acetaldehyde is highly reactivity, has short half-life, diffuses
readily throughout the body and forms either unstable (Schiff base) or
stable (N-ethyllysine residues) adducts with proteins.1,2 It is therefore
likely that acetaldehyde regulates both physiological and pathological
processes according to its concentration and location.
Excessive ethanol consumption and the likely increase in acetal-
dehyde levels are associated with increased risk for alcoholic cardio-
myopathy.3 Furthermore, even moderate alcohol consumption
correlated with subclinical adverse effects on cardiac systolic func-
tions in subjects carrying variants of alcohol metabolizing genes that
result in higher acetaldehyde levels.4 However, neither the direct
effects of acetaldehyde in cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury
nor its involvement in ethanol-induced cardioprotection have been
examined.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a mitochondrial enzyme,
which is highly expressed in the heart. It plays a major role in the detoxifi-
cation of acetaldehyde produced by alcohol dehydrogenase during etha-
nol metabolism.5 In addition, ALDH2 metabolizes other aldehydes
generated during oxidative stress, such as the lipid peroxidation product,
4-hydroxynonenal.6,7 Thus, ALDH2-mediated detoxification of reactive
aldehydes in general and acetaldehyde in particular, has been suggested
to be a mechanism that increases tissue viability upon stress.8–11
Indeed, individuals carrying a point mutation in the ALDH2 gene
(ALDH2*2) are more susceptible to cardiovascular disease.4,12 This var-
iant, found in nearly 35–50% of East Asians,13 results in a reduction in the
ALDH2 enzymatic activity by �70 and 98% in heterozygotes and homo-
zygotes, respectively14; therefore maximizing the unpleasant effect of
acetaldehyde accumulation after alcohol intake, including flushing, car-
diac palpitation, headache and nausea.15
Here, we set out to determine the role of the ALDH2 substrate, ace-
taldehyde, in an ex vivo model of cardiac I/R injury. It is known that acetal-
dehyde, the main product of ethanol metabolism, is a reactive molecule
that can modify proteins through adduction.16,17 This protein modifica-
tion impair its activity and/or stability and therefore, likely affect cardiac
physiology and pathology.18,19 To determine the effect acetaldehyde in
the heart, we compared response to ischaemic insult of hearts from
wildtype (WT) mice and from homozygous ALDH2*2 mice, carrying the
inactivating E487K point mutation in ALDH2,20 identical to the mutation
found in nearly 540 million East Asians.13
2. Methods
2.1 Animals
This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles in
animal
research
adopted
by
the
Brazilian
College
of
Animal
Experimentation (www.cobea.org.br) and conform the NIH guidelines
(Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals). The animal care and
protocols in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethical
Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences at University of S~
ao
Paulo (2014/25). A cohort of 4-month-old male WT C57BL/6 J and
homozygous ALDH2*2 mice was selected for the study. Knock-in
mouse (ALDH2*2) carrying the human inactivating point mutation
ALDH2 (E487K) with a C57BL/6 J background were generated by
homologous recombination as previously described in20 ALDH2*2 mice
are an ideal representation of the human ALDH2*2 carriers and can
serve as an experimental model to reflect the true nature of the genetic
defect, the ALDH2 deficiency.
2.2 I/R injury
An ex vivo model of MI was used as described elsewhere.21 Briefly, ani-
mals were heparinized (2000 U/kg IP) and then anaesthetized with
Ketamine (100 mg/kg IP) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg IP). The hearts were
rapidly excised, cannulated via the aorta and perfused on a Langendorff
apparatus with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer (118 mM NaCl, 25
mM NaHCO3, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM
dextrose, and 1.8 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). Hearts were perfused at a con-
stant flow rate of 2.5 mL/min at 37�C. After 10 min of stabilization, I/R
was induced by stopping the flow and submerging the heart in Krebs-
Henseleit buffer at 37�C for 35 min (global, no-flow ischaemia) followed
by 60 min of reperfusion. Ethanol treatment: 50 mM Ethanol was applied
following 10 min equilibration for 15 min, followed by 5 min washout,
prior to ischaemia as previously described in.22 ALDH2 inhibitor
treatment: 20 mM CVT-10216 [a selective ALDH2 inhibitor,23 Acme
Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA] was applied for 10 min prior to ischaemia and
for the first 10 min of reperfusion. Ethanol and CVT-10216 treatment:
20 mM CVT-10216 was applied for 10 min, followed by 15 min of 50 mM
ethanol, followed by 5 min washout, prior to ischaemia, and 20 mM CVT-
10216 was applied for the first 10 min of reperfusion. Ethanol and
ALDH2 selective activator [Alda-111] treatment: 50 mM ethanol was
applied following 10 min equilibration for 15 min, followed by 10 min of
20 mM Alda-1, followed by 5 min washout, prior to ischaemia, and 20 mM
Alda-1 was applied for the first 10 min of reperfusion. Acetaldehyde
treatment: 50 lM acetaldehyde was applied following 10 min equilibra-
tion for 15 min, followed by 5 min washout, prior to ischaemia.
Ischaemic preconditioning (IPC): three bouts of 5 min of ischaemia and 5
min of reperfusion were applied prior to a sustained period of ischaemia
in the presence or absence of 20 mM CVT-10216.
2.3 Tissue sampling
At the end of the reperfusion period, fresh isolated hearts were sliced
into 1-mm thick transverse sections and incubated with triphenyltetrazo-
lium chloride solution (TTC, 1% in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 37�C for
8 min in the dark, then fixed in 4% formalin. TTC-stained sections were
scanned and infarct size assessed by measured the % infarct for each
slide.
Another set of hearts was prepared to isolate mitochondrial-enriched
fraction as described elsewhere.24 Briefly, fresh isolated whole hearts
from various treatment protocols were minced and homogenized in iso-
lation buffer (300 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.2,
4�C) containing 0.1 mg/mL of Type I protease to release mitochondria
from within muscle fibres and later washed in the same buffer in the
presence of 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. The suspension was homo-
genized in a 4 mL tissue grinder and centrifuged at 950g for 5 min. The
resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 9500g for 10 min. The mito-
chondrial pellet was washed, resuspended in isolation buffer and submit-
ted to a new centrifugation (9500g for 10 min). The mitochondrial pellet
was washed and the final pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of
isolation buffer. ALDH2 activity was measured in fresh isolated
mitochondria.
2.4 LDH activity assay
Coronary effluent was collected every 5 min during the first 15 min of
reperfusion to determine lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. For
each assay, the effluent was combined with Sodium pyruvate (30 mM),
NADH (6.6 mM), and Tris-HCl (0.2 M, pH 7.3), in a final volume of 200
mL. LDH activity was determined by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm
for 10 min at 25�C, resulting from the oxidation of NADH. We meas-
ured the cumulated LDH release over 15 min of reperfusion.
2.5 ALDH2 enzymatic activity assay
Enzymatic activity of mitochondrial ALDH2 was determined spectro-
photometrically by monitoring the reductive reaction of NADþ to
NADH at 340 nm as previously described in.11,25 ALDH2 assays were
carried out at 25�C in 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 9.5. To
this volume, 300 mM acetaldehyde and 160 mg of mitochondrial protein
lysate isolated from fresh hearts were added. To start the reaction, 2.5
mM NAD was added and the accumulation of NADH was monitored
for 10 min with measurements being taken every 30 s.

2.6 Acetaldehyde quantification
Isolated whole hearts were homogenized in lysis buffer (210 mM
Mannitol, 70 mM Sucrose, 5 mM MOPS, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton);
0.2% butylated hydroxytoluene (in Ethanol) was added and samples
were incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min.
Ethanol was added to the supernatant and incubated on ice for 40 min.
Next, samples were centrifuged at 13 500 rpm at 4�C for 10 min and a
mix with 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine [DNPH—20 mM in 1.0 M HCl (in
Ethanol)] and HNE-d11-DNPH internal standard (0.2 nmol/lL) was
added to the supernatant. Samples were then incubated for 2 h at 37�C
under agitation (500 rpm) and extracted with a mixture of dichlorome-
thane (500 lL) and miliQ water (300 lL). The organic phase was col-
lected and the solvent evaporated at room temperature under stirring.
The residue was solubilized in 500 lL acetonitrile and 20 uL were
injected into the HPLC-ESI-MS/MS system.
Analyses in the negative mode were carried out on an API 4000
QTRAP mass spectrometer (AB Sciex). An Agilent HPLC system con-
sisting of autosampler (Agilent 1200 High Performance), automated
switching valve, pumps (Agilent 1200 Binary pump SL and 1200 Isocratic
pump SL) and a detector (Agilent 1200 DAD G1315C) were controlled
by the Analyst 1.4.2 software. The analytical column Luna C18 (250 �
4.6 mm i.d., 5 mm; Phenomenex) was kept at 35�C in an Agilent 1200
G1216B column oven. The gradient used for analyte elution started with
30% acetonitrile with 0.1 mM ammonium acetate and 70% 0.1 mM
ammonium acetate in water, and increased to 100% acetonitrile with 0.1
mM ammonium acetate in 25 min. The acetaldehyde derivative was
detected by selected reaction monitoring. Signals from ions at m/z values
of 222.9/158.0 and 222.9/162.8 for acetaldehyde-DNPH transitions; and
346.1/166.7 and 346.1/162.8 for HNE-d11-DNPH were monitored for
quantification and structural confirmation. Briefly, all samples containing
internal standard (0.1 nmol) were injected into the HPLC/ESI/MSMS sys-
tem and the transitions were monitored with a dwell time of 100 ms.
For each compound, the declustering voltage, entrance potential, colli-
sion energy, and cell exit were optimized. All other parameters of the
mass spectrometer were adjusted for acquisition of the best transitions
for each aldehyde derivative. The Turbo Ion Spray voltage was kept at
-3500 V, the curtain gas at 10 psi and the nebulizer and auxiliary gas at 70
psi. The temperature was set to 650�C, and the collision cell nitrogen
pressure was adjusted to medium.
2.7 Cell culture
H9c2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium, supple-
mented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/
streptomycin at 37�C in 5% CO2 in 95% air. H9c2 cells were differenti-
ated towards a cardiac phenotype by culturing them in low serum
medium (1% FBS) in the presence of retinoic acid for 7 days. Simulation

of I/R injury was performed using hypoxic pouches as previously
described in.26 Briefly, after differentiation cells were exposed to 6 h of
hypoxia followed by 2 h of reoxygenation. Protein kinase C (PKC) epsi-
lon translocation to mitochondria was inhibited by the isozyme-specific
translocation inhibitor, eV1-2 peptide,27 at final concentration of 1 lM in
cultured cells throughout I/R-induced injury.
2.8 Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean þS.E.M. Data normality was assessed
through Shapiro–Wilk’s test. Two-way repeated measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse data presented in Figure 1A.
Two-way ANOVA was used to analyse data presented in Figures 1B and
C, 2–5. Whenever significant F-values were obtained, Duncan’s adjust-
ment was used for multiple comparison purposes. Linear regression was
used to assess the association between infarct size and acetaldehyde
levels in Figure 6A. GraphPad Prism Statistics was used for the analysis,
and statistical significance was considered achieved when the value of
P was < 0.05.
3. Results
To confirm that the mutant ALDH2*2 mice mimic the human
phenotype,14 we measured the ALDH2 activity. Similar to human carry-
ing the ALDH2*2 variant,14 cardiac ALDH2 catalytic activity was signifi-
cantly lower in ALDH2*2 mice as compared with WT controls (Figure
1A), reflecting the loss of catalytic function of the mutant enzyme. We
therefore measured cardiac acetaldehyde levels [the main ALDH2 sub-
strate] in WT and ALDH2*2 mice. Under baseline, cardiac acetaldehyde
levels in WT mice were �6 lM and in ALDH2*2 �11 lM (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S1A).
Next, we isolated and perfused hearts from WT and ALDH2*2 mice.
After 10 min of equilibration, WT and ALDH2*2 isolated hearts were

treated with acetaldehyde (50 lM) for a period of 15 min, followed by 5
min washout (Figure 1B). This acetaldehyde concentration is similar to
the blood acetaldehyde levels found in individuals carrying the inactive
ALDH2*2 variant after consuming a moderate dose of alcohol.28
Acetaldehyde treatment increased ALDH2 activity by about 46% in
hearts of WT mice (Figure 1C). This increase was sufficient to maintain
cardiac acetaldehyde levels close to the baseline (seen in WT hearts
without treatment, Figure 1D). In contrast, hearts of mice carrying
ALDH2*2 treated with the same amounts of acetaldehyde, exhibited
only a mild activation of ALDH2, and more than two-fold increase in
acetaldehyde levels (Figure 1C and D).
We previously reported that inflammation and increased oxidative
stress correlate with increased acetaldehyde levels.20 However, whether
acetaldehyde levels increase also in the heart following ischaemia and
reperfusion-induced oxidative stress has not been determined. Thirty
minutes ischaemia followed by an hour of reperfusion brought up the
levels of acetaldehyde in WT hearts by 78%, similar to the levels of
ALDH2*2 hearts under normoxic conditions (see Supplementary mate-
rial online, Figure S1A). However, unexpectedly, acetaldehyde levels in
hearts of ALDH2*2 mice did not increase by I/R relative to basal levels
(see Supplementary material online, Figure S1A). Correlated with acetal-
dehyde levels, hearts from WT and ALDH2 knock-in animals with
reduced ALDH2 activity had the same infarct size after I/R (Figure 2A–C).
Next, we determined the impact of a 15-min pre-treatment with 50
lM acetaldehyde followed by a 5-min washing on cardiac I/R injury
(Figure 2A). As observed in hearts in the absence of ischaemic protocol
(Figure 1B), acetaldehyde pre-treatment to hearts of WT mice was suffi-
cient to increase ALDH2 activity in the ischaemic heart by about 60%
and induce cardioprotection [demonstrated by a reduction in both
infarct size and LDH release] as compared with untreated controls
(Figure 2B–D). In contrast, acetaldehyde pre-treatment to hearts of
ALDH2*2 mice showed that although acetaldehyde pre-treatment
caused an �50% increase in ALDH2 activity, this was insufficient to pro-
vide protection; myocardial infarct size and LDH release significantly
increased by 40% relative to untreated hearts (Figure 2B–D).
We next determined the molecular mechanisms involved in
acetaldehyde-induced cardioprotection seen in WT. We previously
demonstrated that epsilon PKC (ePKC) phosphorylation-induced activa-
tion of ALDH2 is critical to induce ethanol preconditioning.8,11
Therefore, we evaluated whether acetaldehyde preconditioning shares
the same pathway. For that, we exposed H9C2 myotubes to acetalde-
hyde and/or eV1-2 (a selective inhibitor of ePKC)22 prior to hypoxia-
reoxygenation (Figure 2E) and found that inhibition of ePKC was
sufficient to abolish acetaldehyde-induced protection in H9C2 myotubes
in culture; rather, injury following pre-treatment with acetaldehyde
increased by 50% (Figure 2F). These findings indicate that protection by
acetaldehyde pre-treatment is mediated by activation of ePKC in H9C2
myotubes.
Considering that acetaldehyde is an intermediate of ethanol metabo-
lism, we next set out to determine whether acetaldehyde levels are asso-
ciated with the cardiac effects of ethanol. For that, we measured cardiac
acetaldehyde levels in two opposite conditions: ethanol-induced

cardioprotection and ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity. Ethanol-induced
cardioprotection was associated with reduced acetaldehyde levels of
about 70% in hearts of WT mice as compared with untreated I/R WT
group (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1A). Under ethanol-
induced cardiotoxicity in ALDH2*2, there was a 70% increase in cardiac
acetaldehyde levels (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1A). Of
interest, acute pharmacological ALDH2 activation using Alda-1 abolished
the accumulation of acetaldehyde in hearts isolated from ALDH2*2
mice exposed to ethanol, bringing it close to WT levels (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S1A).
Next, to determine whether the reduced acetaldehyde metabolism
seen in ALDH2*2 variant affects ethanol-mediated cardioprotection, we
exposed hearts isolated from WT and ALDH2*2 mice to ethanol prior
to I/R injury (Figure 3A). Perfusion with ethanol (50 lM) for 15 min fol-
lowed by 5 min washout prior to I/R increased ALDH2 activity without
affecting protein levels (Figures 3B and see Supplementary material
online, Figure S1B). As expected, 9 increased ALDH2 activity was associ-
ated with a �40% reduction in both infarct size and necrotic cell death,
measured by LDH release (Figure 3C and D). This concentration of etha-
nol was chosen because it is similar to the blood ethanol levels found
after consuming >3 units of any type of alcoholic beverages.28
In contrast, ethanol pre-treatment of hearts isolated from ALDH2*2
exhibited a very mild increase in ALDH2 activity as compared with
ALDH2*2 I/R control group, to levels that were still only 50% of WT
control hearts (Figure 3B). This insufficient improvement in ALDH2 activ-
ity of the hearts of ALDH2*2 mice was correlated with an �20%
increased infarct size and higher cardiac LDH release (Figure 3C and D).
These results suggest that in contrast to the benefit of ethanol as a pre-
conditioning agent in WT hearts, ethanol pre-treatment induced further
cardiac I/R injury in ALDH2*2.
Next, we determined whether the re-establishment of cardiac acetal-
dehyde metabolism by using an ALDH2 small molecule activator devel-
oped by our group (Alda-1, for aldehyde dehydrogenase activator7,11)
minimizes ethanol-induced increase in cardiac injury following I/R in
ALDH2*2. For that, Alda-1 (20 lM) was applied for 10 min after ethanol
treatment and again, during the first 10 min of reperfusion (Figure 3A).
Alda-1 treatment caused additional increase in ALDH2 activity in hearts
isolated from both WT and ALDH2*2 mice treated with ethanol and
subjected to I/R as compared with their ethanol controls, respectively
(Figure 3B). This incremental effect of Alda-1 on ALDH2 activity corre-
lated with a reduction in infarct size, cardiac LDH release and mitochon-
drial H2O2 release in hearts of ALDH2*2 mice subjected to I/R and
treated with ethanol (Figures 3C and D and see Supplementary material
online, Figure S1C). These findings suggest that pharmacological ALDH2
activation promotes a shift from ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity to
ethanol-induced cardioprotection in hearts isolated from mice carrying

ALDH2*2 variant and subjected to I/R. This protective effect may be due
to reduced ALDH2 inactivation by its substrate, acetaldehyde; we previ-
ously found that aldehydes interact with cysteine residues at the catalytic
site of the enzyme and because Alda-1 shields these residues, substrate-
induced ALDH2 inactivation is inhibited.11
Oxygen consumption in isolated cardiac mitochondria, mitochondrial
protein levels (NDUFA9, IF1, and SOD2) and myocardial perfusion pres-
sure were unchanged among conditions (see Supplementary material
online, Figure S1D–I). In WT, combination treatment with Alda-1 and
ethanol had an incremental effect in ALDH2 activity (Figure 3B), but no
change in cardioprotection, when compared with ethanol-treated hearts
alone (Figure 3C and D).
Considering that pharmacological ALDH2 activation protects hearts of
mice carrying the ALDH2*2 variant from ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity,
we sought to determine whether acute pharmacological ALDH2 inhibi-
tion, using CVT-10216, is sufficient to induce ethanol cardiotoxicity in
heart of WT mice (Figure 4A). This strategy was also used to exclude pos-
sible compensatory mechanisms activated in the ALDH2*2 mice by other
genes involved in detoxification from damaging agents.29 Treatment of
hearts isolated from WT mice with CVT-10216 (20 lM), applied 10 min
prior to ischaemia and during the initial 10 min of reperfusion, resulted in
80% decrease in ALDH2 activity (Figure 4B) and a 2.3-fold increase in
cardiac
acetaldehyde
levels
compared
with
control
hearts
(see
Supplementary material online, Figure S1A). This excessive accumulation
of toxic acetaldehyde during acute ALDH2 inhibition was sufficient to
increase infarct size and cardiac LDH release compared with I/R control
group (Figure 4C and D). When applied after ethanol treatment and prior
to I/R, CVT-10216 abolished ethanol-mediated increased ALDH2 activity
and significantly increased infarct size by an �three-fold and LDH release
in WT (Figure 4C and D). These results suggest that acute disruption of
acetaldehyde metabolism not only abolishes ethanol-induced cardiopro-
tection, but rather exacerbates ethanol-induced cardiotoxicity, similar to
what we found in hearts isolated from ALDH2*2 mice (Figure 3).
Since ALDH2 activation is involved in acetaldehyde- (Figure 2), ethanol-
(Figure 3)8,11 and isoflurane-mediated preconditioning,30 we set out to
determine the levels of acetaldehyde during IPC as well as to evaluate the
contribution of ALDH2 to this process. Three bouts of 5 min ischaemia
and 5 min reperfusion were sufficient to increase ALDH2 activity without
affecting acetaldehyde levels in hearts of WT and ALDH2*2 mice (Figure
5A–C). Note that acetaldehyde levels maintained elevated in hearts of
ALDH2*2 mice exposed to IPC compared with control (Figure 5C).
IPC-induced ALDH2 activation correlated with reduced infarct size,
LDH release (Figure 5E–G) and cardiac acetaldehyde levels (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S1A) in hearts from WT but not in
hearts from ALDH2*2 mice. Finally, to test the involvement of acetalde-
hyde metabolism on IPC, hearts isolated from WT mice were treated

 with 20 mM CVT-10216 during the IPC period and for the first 10 min of
reperfusion (Figure 5D). CVT-10216 treatment not only abolished IPC-
induced cardioprotection, but resulted in a further increase in both
infarct size and necrotic cell death (LDH release) (Figure 5E–G). Taken
together, our data demonstrate a positive correlation between cardiac
infarct size and acetaldehyde levels in hearts exposed to global (ex vivo) I/
R injury (Figure 6A).
4. Discussion
Despite the well-known impact of ethanol intake on cardiovascular system,
the molecular mechanisms involved in its cardioprotective and cardiotoxic
effects are not completely understood. Here we show, for the first time,
that acetaldehyde, the main product of ethanol metabolism, plays a critical
role in this scenario. We demonstrate that acetaldehyde levels not only
correlate well with IR damage but acetaldehyde actually regulates infarct
size in a bimodal fashion, when adding exogenously as a pre-conditioning
agents, with a major contribution of ALDH2 activity (Figure 6B).
Previous studies have demonstrated the deleterious cardiac effect of
acetaldehyde accumulation due to either alcohol dehydrogenase over-
expression or genetic ALDH2 disruption; therefore resulting in alcoholic
cardiomyopathy.31,32 Here, we show that 50 lM of acetaldehyde pre-
treatment followed by a 5-min washout prior to I/R injury is sufficient to
induce cardioprotection in hearts of WT mice (or acetaldehyde precon-
ditioning). However, the same pre-treatment with acetaldehyde exacer-
bates I/R injury in hearts with impaired acetaldehyde metabolism from
ALDH2 deficient mice, ALDH2*2. These findings indicate a bimodal
effect of acetaldehyde in I/R injury. Supporting an ALDH2 mechanism for
such bimodal response, ALDH2 activation using Alda-1 promotes a shift
from acetaldehyde-induced cardiotoxicity to acetaldehyde-induced car-
dioprotection in hearts of ALDH2*2 mice subjected to I/R and pharma-
cological ALDH2 inhibition in WT hearts shifts acetaldehyde-induced
cardioprotection to cardiotoxicity.
The bimodal effect of acetaldehyde in cardiac physiology can be
explained by its ability to accumulate inside the cell and form either unsta-
ble (Schiff base) or stable (N-ethyllysine residues) adducts with proteins;
thus affecting protein activity and stability.1,2 Acetaldehyde has also been
linked to renin-angiotensin system activation through cardiac mast cell
degranulation, which has a critical impact in cardiac physiology.18
However, further studies are required to better understand the role of
acetaldehyde in cardiac physiology and pathology. Here we show that, sim-
ilar to ethanol preconditioning,8,11 acetaldehyde-induced cardioprotection
requires ePKC translocation to mitochondria and activation of ALDH2.
ALDH2 is a tetrameric enzyme responsible for the oxidization of alde-
hydic substrates, including those generated during oxidative stress such
as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal.7 We have previously found that the inability
of ALDH2 to remove endogenous cytotoxic aldehydes accumulated
during oxidative stress is involved in a variety of pathological conditions
such as nitroglycerin-induced increased cardiac damage,9,33 myocardial
infarction,6 heart failure,7 hypertension,34 and inflammatory pain.20
Moreover, direct activation of ALDH2 using Alda-1, a small molecule
allosteric activator developed by our group,11 is sufficient to increase the
clearance of cytotoxic aldehydes and mitigates their pathological
effects.6,7,9,20 Similarly, ALDH2 knockout mice are more susceptible to
Figure 6 Acetaldehyde levels display a positive correlation with
infarct size. (A) Linear regression analysis between cardiac acetaldehyde
levels and infarct size in WT (open circles) and ALDH2*2 (2*2, filled
circles) hearts exposed to ex vivo global ischaemia-reperfusion protocol.
A subset of hearts exposed to ischaemia-reperfusion was precondi-
tioned with Ethanol (EtOH, 50 mM), EtOH (50 mM) þ Alda1 (ALDH2
activator, 20 mM), acetaldehyde (Act, 50 lM), IPC (3 bouts of 5 min
ischaemia followed by 5 min reperfusion) or pharmacologically inhib-
ited by CVT-10216 (20 mM, ALDH2 inhibitor). Data are expressed as
mean ± SEM (n = 5 per condition). (B) Proposed model for cardiac ace-
taldehyde preconditioning in WT and ALDH2*2 mice. Ethanol is
metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to generate acetalde-
hyde. Acetaldehyde is then metabolized by the mitochondrial ALDH2
to acetate. Either administration of exogenous acetaldehyde or its
endogenous production during ethanol metabolism induces cardiopro-
tection through ALDH2 activation and faster acetaldehyde oxidation in
hearts carrying the ALDH2*2 variant treated with the ALDH2 activator
(Alda-1) or untreated WT hearts. This process results in a mild acetal-
dehyde accumulation compared with control hearts. Oppositely, the
same amount of acetaldehyde increases infarct size in hearts carrying
the ALDH2*2 variant or WT hearts treated with the ALDH2 inhibitor
(CVT-10216). This phenotype is followed by a severe accumulation of
cardiac acetaldehyde.

stress-induced injury and ALDH2 overexpressing mice are more pro-
tected from stress.29
Our findings suggest that even moderate consumption of alcoholic
beverages (50 mM ethanol is equivalent to about three standard drinks
according to NIAAA35) may cause cardiotoxicity in about 540 million
people carrying the ALDH2*2 variant due to their reduced ability to
metabolize acetaldehyde.4,36 Because of the reactions to acetaldehyde,
individuals carrying the ALDH2*2 variant are expected to consume
lower amount of alcoholic beverages and have reduced likelihood of
heavy drinking compared with other individuals. However, the increased
cultural acceptance of alcohol consumption has contributed to a pro-
gressive increase in the annually rate per capita of alcohol consumption
among individual carrying ALDH2*2 variant.37 Once they consume
more ethanol, the interaction between ethanol and the ALDH2*2 var-
iant will likely increase their risk for cardiovascular diseases4,12 and dam-
age from acute myocardial infarction (the current study). In fact, we
previously demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem cell-derived car-
diomyocytes from patients carrying the ALDH2*2 variant are more sus-
ceptible to ischaemic injury when compared with WT controls.10
Unexpectedly, we found that hearts excised from ALDH2*2 knock-in
mice with impaired acetaldehyde metabolism have the same ischaemic
damage compared with WT littermates. This lack of difference could be
because the damage generated in an ex vivo model of I/R (30’/60’) was too
severe; therefore dampening the potential difference between ALDH2*2
and WT hearts. Perhaps, a shorter period of ischaemia would be sufficient
to detect the cardiac contribution of the ALDH2*2 mutation.
Overall,
using
a
combination
of
pharmacological
and
genetic
approaches, our study demonstrates that acetaldehyde levels have a posi-
tive correlation with the cardiac outcome after I/R injury (Figure 6A). In
addition, acetaldehyde levels and its metabolizing enzyme, ALDH2, dictate
whether acute ethanol/acetaldehyde plays beneficial or detrimental role in
ischaemic hearts, and the use of selective ALDH2 activators, such as Alda-
1, can rescue ALDH2*2 hearts from ethanol metabolism-induced cardio-
toxicity (Figure 6B). Therefore, the maintenance of active acetaldehyde
metabolism thorough ALDH2 is critical to promote cardioprotection.
