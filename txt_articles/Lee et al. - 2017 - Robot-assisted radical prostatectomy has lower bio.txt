Purpose: To assess the effectiveness and safety of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) versus laparoscopic radical prosta-
tectomy (LRP) in the treatment of prostate cancer.
Materials and Methods: Existing systematic reviews were updated to investigate the effectiveness and safety of RARP. Electronic 
databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the Cochrane Library, KoreaMed, Kmbase, and others, were searched through 
July 2014. The quality of the selected systematic reviews was assessed by using the revised assessment of multiple systematic 
reviews (R-Amstar) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Meta-analysis was performed by using Revman 5.2 (Cochrane Community) 
and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 2.0 (CMA; Biostat). Cochrane Q and I2 statistics were used to assess heterogeneity.
Results: Two systematic reviews and 16 additional studies were selected from a search performed of existing systematic reviews. 
These included 2 randomized controlled clinical trials and 28 nonrandomized comparative studies. The risk of complications, such 
as injury to organs by the Clavien-Dindo classification, was lower with RARP than with LRP (relative risk [RR], 0.44; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.23–0.85; p=0.01). The risk of urinary incontinence was lower (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31–0.60; p<0.000001) and the po-
tency rate was significantly higher with RARP than with LRP (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.11–1.70; I
2=78%; p=0.003). Regarding positive sur-
gical margins, no significant difference in risk between the 2 groups was observed; however, the biochemical recurrence rate was 
lower after RARP than after LRP (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.48–0.73; I
2=21%; p<0.00001).
Conclusions: RARP appears to be a safe and effective technique compared with LRP with a lower complication rate, better po-
tency, a higher continence rate, and a decreased rate of biochemical recurrence.

Robot and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) followed by robot-
assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) as alternatives to 
open surgery [1,2]
. RARP was introduced to decrease the 
difficulty in performing complex laparoscopic procedures 
such as urethral anastomosis. The robotic platform provided 
several advantages over LRP, such as seven degrees of 
freedom, tremor filtration, a three-dimensional magnified 
view, and preferred ergonomics [3]
. Therefore, robot-assisted 
surgery has become popular in Korea, the United States, 
and Europe [1,4]
. However, this trend has occurred despite 
a lack of high-quality evidence supporting improvement in 
outcomes.
Randomized controlled trials comparing the safety and 
effectiveness of RARP and LRP are limited. Therefore, high-
level evidence is a requisite for clinicians needing recent 
evidence on the treatment of prostate cancer. The primary 
objective of this study was to determine whether RARP 
is more effective than LRP in the treatment of prostate 
cancer in terms of functional, oncological, and perioperative 
outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Inclusion criteria
Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials 
and prospective and retrospective cohort studies comparing 
RARP and LRP. A study was excluded if it did not report 
any outcomes of interest or functional and oncological 
outcomes.
2. Search strategy
We searched electronic databases for reviews published 
through July 2014, including Ovid MEDLINE (Ovid, New 
York, NY, USA), Ovid EMBASE (Ovid), the Cochrane Library 
(London, United Kingdom), KoreaMed (KAMJE, Seoul, 
Korea), Kmbase (MedRIC, Chungbuk, Korea), KISS (Korean 
Studies Information Co, Paju, Korea), RISS (KERIS, Daegu, 
Korea), and KisTi (KISTI, Daejeon, Korea). Patient-related 
search terms (prostatic neoplasm, prostatic cancer, prostatic 
carcinoma, prostatic tumor), and intervention-related search 
terms (robotics, computer-assisted surgery, telerobot, remote 
operation, remote surgery, da Vinci) were combined.
3. Data synthesis and analysis
Two independent reviewers selected the studies, extrac-
ted data, and performed quality assessments. The authors 
assessed the relevance and quality of the selected systematic 
reviews related to the research question through the revised 
assessment of multiple systematic reviews (R-Amstar). 
For the prospective randomized controlled clinical studies, 
the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of 
bias was used to perform the quality evaluations. For the 
nonrandomized studies on the final selected literature, 
a revised risk of bias was used to perform the quality

evaluations. Functional and oncologic outcomes, as well 
as postoperative complications and perioperative results 
(operation duration, length of stay), were calculated and 
compared between the groups. 
4. Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis was conducted by using RevMan 5.2 (Co-
ch 
rane Community, London, United Kingdom) and Compre-
hensive Meta-Analysis 2.0 (CMA; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, 
USA). The Cochrane Q and I2 statistics were used to assess 
statistical heterogeneity. The results were expressed as 
weighted means and standardized mean differences for 
continuous outcomes and as relative risk (RR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous variables. For 
dichotomous variables, the random effect model of Mantel-
Haenszel was used, and for continuous data, the random 
effect model of the inverse-variance method was used. Publi-
cation bias was tested by using a funnel plot and Egger’s 
test. The statistical analyses were reviewed by a statistician 
with previous meta-analysis experience.
5. Details of included studies
The studies selected are outlined in Fig. 1. Thirty articles 
were evaluated. There were 2 randomized controlled clinical 
trials (RCTs) and 28 nonrandomized comparative studies 
(Table 1).
6. Quality assessment
For the RCTs, there was a low risk of bias in sequence 
generation, blinding, selective report, and other biases. How-
ever, the allocation of concealment was uncertain, and 
incomplete outcome data were at a high risk of bias. In 
the cohort studies, sequence generation and allocation of 
concealment, which are important factors in the quality 
assessment of therapeutic publications, were at a high risk 
of bias.
RESULTS
1. Postoperative complications
The risk of complications, such as bladder neck contrac-
ture (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.
1
7–0.92; p=0.03), organ injury (RR, 0.23; 
95% CI, 0.
1
1–0.49; p=0.0002), and other major complications 
(Clavien-Dindo III–V) according to the Clavien-Dindo 
classification (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23–0.85; p=0.01), was lower 
for RARP than for LRP. Anastomosis site leakage (RR, 0.67; 
95% CI, 0.42–1.08; p=0.
10) and the rates of infection (RR, 1.2
1; 
95% CI, 0.84–1.76; p=0.31), ileus (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.38–1.40; 
p=0.34), and pulmonary embolism (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.22–6.51; 
p=0.83) were not significantly different between the groups 
(Fig. 2). No significant difference in the conversion rate (RR, 
0.70; 95% CI, 0.25–1.95; p=0.50) was observed. RARP carried a 
lower risk of transfusion than LRP (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54–
0.91; I
2=44%; p=0.007).
2. Perioperative data
The operation time for RARP was shorter than that 
for LRP (RR, -18.74; 95% CI, -32.15 to -5.33; p=0.006), but 
the statistical heterogeneity was high (χ2=527.29, df=22, 
p<0.00001, I
2=96%). The hospital stay following RARP was 
1.53 days shorter than that following LRP. The results 
of the subgroup analysis according to region showed a 
mean difference of -1.
13 (95% CI, 2.93–0.67; p=0.22) in the 
Asia Pacific region, -0.56 (95% CI, 1.
14–0.02; p=0.06) in the 
United States, and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.88–0.25; p=0.28) in Europe. 
However, the overall statistical heterogeneity was high 
(I
2=94%). 
3. Functional outcomes
The functional outcomes were improved in a comparison 
between RARP and LRP (Fig. 3). The urinary incontinence 
rate at 12 months was lower for RARP than for LRP 
(RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31–0.60; p<0.000001), and statistical 
heterogeneity was low (I
2=0%). The potency recovery rate 
was higher for RARP than for LRP at postoperative 12 
months (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.
1
1–1.70; I
2=78%; p=0.003). Potency 
recovery was defined as an International Index of Erectile 
Function 5 (IIEF-5)>17.
4. Oncologic outcomes
The overall positive surgical margin (PSM) results were 
investigated in 7 studies. When analyzing PSM rates in the 
pT2 group, the RARP and LRP series had PSM rates of 
14.2% (123 of 864 cases) and 1
1.3% (97 of 860 cases) with an 
RR of 1.22 (95% CI, 0.98–1.54; p=0.
1
1). In the pT3 group, the 
PSM rates for RARP and LRP were 43.
1% (1
16 of 269 cases) 
and 34.4% (72 of 209 cases) with an RR of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00–
1.58; p=0.05) (Fig. 4). 
The biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate was significantly 
lower for RARP than for LRP (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.48–0.73; 
I
2=0%; p<0.00001) (Fig. 4). Five studies used prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA)≥0.2 ng/mL to indicate BCR, 1 study used 
PSA≥0.4 ng/mL, and 2 studies did not define the cutoff used. 
The follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 60 months. 
The overall BCR rates for RARP and LRP were 8.6% (162 of 
1,885 cases) and 13.7% (314 of 2,288 cases).

5. Publication bias
A funnel plot analysis for organ injury, blood transfusion 
rate, length of stay, potency, and overall BCR revealed a 
symmetrical funnel plot, indicating no publication bias (Fig. 
5) (p=0.53, p=0.47, p=0.26, p=0.
10, and p=0.70, respectively, 
Egger test). However, operative time revealed asymmetry on 
the funnel plot (p=0.01, Egger test).
DISCUSSION
Our study revealed three important findings: (1) the risk 
of complications after RARP was significantly lower than

after LRP; (2) in comparison with LRP, the risk of urinary 
incontinence at 12 months was significantly lower and the 
potency rate was higher with RARP; (3) the BCR rate was 
significantly lower after RARP than after LRP.
The major findings of this meta-analysis showed signifi-
cant differences in complications such as organ injury and 
other major complications according to the Clavien-Dindo 
(III–V) classification. The major complication rate was 
significantly lower for RARP than for LRP. Although both 
laparoscopic and robotic surgeries are regarded as minimally 
invasive techniques, the main advantages of RARP, such 
as seven degrees of freedom in robotic arm movement 
and magnified 3D vision of the robotic platform, result in 
decreased postoperative complications.
Incontinence is another complication of prostatectomy 
that greatly affects quality of life [5]
. The urinary incon-
tinence rate is influenced by the definition of incontinence. 
Thus, as reported previously, any systematic review is 
difficult to accomplish owing to the varying definitions used 
for urinary incontinence, such as involuntary urine loss [6]
, 
needing zero or 1 pad [7]
, and also those in the International 
Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form 
survey [8]
.
The urinary incontinence rate after 12 months was 
significantly lower with RARP than with LRP in this 
meta-analysis and in other randomized controlled trials, 
in which the rates for RARP and LRP were 6% and 17%, 
respectively, but without statistical significance owing to the 
limited study population [9]
. Many modifications have been 
suggested in the field of robotics to improve the continence 
rate. Patel et al. [10] reported a peri-urethral suspension 
suture technique to improve the rate (92.8% vs. 83%; p=0.013 
over 3 months). A modified posterior reconstruction that 
increased the continence rate by 4 weeks was reported by 
Coelho et al. [1
1]
. In 201
1, Asimakopoulos et al. [9] suggested a 
pubovesical-complex-sparing technique, in which a ventral 
plane was developed between the detrusor apron and 
the prostate. Owing to the technical feasibility of robotic 
assistance, reconstruction procedures have additionally 
improved the continence rate.
The potency recovery rate is another major concern for 
patients undergoing prostatectomy. The most common reason

for failure to reach pentafecta is erectile dysfunction (35%) 
[12]
. Our findings differed from those previously reported by 
NETSCC (2012), which showed no difference in the potency 
rate between RARP and LRP at 12 months postoperatively. 
In our meta-analysis, the potency rate of RARP at 12 months 
was significantly higher than that for LRP. Different 
potency recovery rates could be due to several factors, 
including different definitions of erectile dysfunction, 
various characteristics of the surgery, and differences 
in postsurgical rehabilitation [13]
. Potency recovery was 
measured by using several methods, including the IIEF-
5 and the Sexual Health Inventory for Men score. Various 
techniques for preserving potency have been developed on 
the robotic platform, including cavernous nerve preservation. 
Several nerve-sparing techniques were developed in previous 
studies. For example, Ahlering et al. [4] evaluated the adverse 
effects of electrocautery on dissection of the prostate and 
the superiority of cautery-free nerve-sparing techniques on 
the recovery of potency. Menon et al. [14] evaluated the “Veil 
of Aphrodite” technique in which the inter-fascial plane

Robot and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
was extended towards the apex and laterally towards the 
prostatic pedicle. At 6 to 18 months postoperatively, 94% of 
men who attempted sexual intercourse after undergoing this 
technique reported success, with a median SHIM score of 18 
out of 25. Following recent discoveries of the periprostatic 
fascial anatomy, extrafascial, interfascial, and intrafascial 
approaches have been developed. Comparing inter-fascial 
and extrafascial approaches, Shikanov et al. [15] reported a 
significantly improved potency rate (p=0.03) using the inter-
fascial approach.
Three-dimensional magnified visualization of the 
robotic platform has enabled meticulous dissection of the 
periprostatic fascia layer and the neurovascular bundle. 
Further insights into the multilayered structure of the 
periprostatic fascia and the course of the cavernous nerves 
have supported the development of intra- or interfascial 
surgical planes, which have enabled improved functional 
outcomes in urinary incontinence and potency. A PSA 
level>0.2 ng/mL was selected as the important criterion, 
based on recommendations of clinical practice guidelines 
[16]
. In an oncological RARP study, Menon et al. [17] reported 
biochemical-free survival rates of 95.
1%, 90.6%, 86.6%, and 
81.0% after 1, 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. Few studies 
have reported BCR rates after RARP and LRP. Recently, 
Porpiglia et al. [18] reported BCR-free survival rates of 98% 
for a RARP group and 92.5% for an LRP group (p=0.
190).
The oncologic outcome in the current study was 
noteworthy because of  the statistically significant 
differences in BCR rates between the two groups. Ficarra 
et al. [13] demonstrated that BCR was significantly 
influenced by surgical experience, clinical tumor size, and 
anatomic tumor characteristics. Kim et al. [19] analyzed the 
preoperative predictors of BCR using multivariable analysis, 
which suggested that PSA, pathologic stage, pathologic 
Gleason score, and PSM were independently associated with 
BCR. In a Japanese study, the predictive factors of BCR 
following RARP were serum PSA levels, the percentage of 
positive cores, and the Gleason score. PSA density was also 
a strong predictor of advanced pathological features and 
BCR [20]
. In our systematic review, the oncologic results 
for BCR showed a statistically significantly improved BCR 
in the RARP group relative to the LRP group, although 
the propensity score matching was similar between the 
groups. The PSM patients in the intermediate- and high-
risk disease groups had higher rates of BCR than did those 
who were marginal or negative. However, the PSM in the 
low-risk disease group was not associated with disease 
progression [2
1]
. After adjustment for differences in clinical 
and pathological features, the presence of a base margin was 
significantly associated with a shorter time to recurrence 
for intermediate- and high-risk disease. The apex margin 
also was associated with the time to recurrence, but not 
statistically so for intermediate-risk disease. Thus, the similar 
PSM rate did not indicate a similar BCR rate. The length of 
the PSM was also independently predictive of BCR. Patients 
with a PSM <1 mm appeared to have similar outcomes 
compared with those with negative surgical margins [22]
. 
Patients with a PSM <1 mm did not differ from those 
with a negative margin, and as the length of the positive 
margin increased so did the risk of BCR. Interestingly, the 
risk of BCR did not differ between patients with a negative 
surgical margin and those with a PSM <1 mm.
The current study had several limitations. First, because 
this is a relatively new procedure, data were lacking on long-
term oncologic results following RARP, such as the cancer-
specific survival rate. Second, significant heterogeneity 
was evident in terms of surgical experience and definition 
of functional outcomes. Third, some of recently published 
articles had far larger cohorts, which strongly influenced 
the meta-analysis. Fourth, there was an era bias in several 
centers in that RARP was performed after LRP.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, RARP showed favorable results compared 
with LRP. However, few long-term, high-quality studies are 
available comparing RARP and LRP. Although further 
studies are needed, our results revealed that RARP had an 
improved BCR rate, potency rate, and continence rate with 
fewer complications than LRP. Further high-quality studies 
that minimize confounding and selection biases with long-
term follow-up are needed to further clarify the clinical 
efficacy and safety of RARP.
