Introduction: Although, diet has a substantial influence on the aging brain, the
relationship between dietary nutrients and aspects of brain health remains unclear.
This study examines the neural mechanisms that mediate the relationship between
a carotenoid important for brain health across the lifespan, lutein, and crystallized
intelligence in cognitively intact older adults. We hypothesized that higher serum levels of
lutein are associated with better performance on a task of crystallized intelligence, and
that this relationship is mediated by gray matter structure of regions within the temporal
cortex. This investigation aims to contribute to a growing line of evidence, which suggests
that particular nutrients may slow or prevent aspects of cognitive decline by targeting
specific features of brain aging.
Methods: We examined 76 cognitively intact adults between the ages of 65 and 75
to investigate the relationship between serum lutein, tests of crystallized intelligence
(measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), and gray matter volume
of regions within the temporal cortex. A three-step mediation analysis was implemented
using multivariate linear regressions to control for age, sex, education, income,
depression status, and body mass index.
Results: The mediation analysis revealed that gray matter thickness of one region within
the temporal cortex, the right parahippocampal cortex (Brodmann’s Area 34), partially
mediates the relationship between serum lutein and crystallized intelligence.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the parahippocampal cortex acts as a mediator
of the relationship between serum lutein and crystallized intelligence in cognitively intact
older adults. Prior findings substantiate the individual relationships reported within the
mediation, specifically the links between (i) serum lutein and temporal cortex structure, (ii)
serum lutein and crystallized intelligence, and (iii) parahippocampal cortex structure and

lutein status and crystallized intelligence, and therefore provides further evidence that
specific nutrients may slow or prevent features of cognitive decline by hindering particular
aspects of brain aging. Future work should examine the potential mechanisms underlying
this mediation, including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and membrane modulating
properties of lutein.

INTRODUCTION
As the older adult population expands, the economic burden
of care and treatment of age-related health disorders also rises.
Between 2015 and 2060, the United States will experience
significant growth of its older population, with the size of the
population aged 65 and over more than doubling from an
estimated 46 million in 2015 to 98 million in 2060 (Mather et al.,
2015). Therefore, successful strategies to promote healthy brain
aging are of significant interest to public health initiatives in the
United States.
Nutrition is a promising target for intervention efforts
to support healthy brain aging (Zamroziewicz and Barbey,
2016). Accumulating evidence indicates that particular nutrients
may slow or prevent aspects of age-related cognitive decline
by targeting specific features of brain aging. Studies that
couple neuroimaging techniques with neuropsychological testing
provide insight into mechanisms of action through which
particular nutrients might influence specific aspects of age-
related cognitive decline (Bowman et al., 2012; Zamroziewicz
et al., 2015; Boespflug et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016). While
some nutrients may be effective at preventing late-life changes
in the brain, other nutritional factors may accumulate across
the lifespan and therefore confer neuroprotection in the aging
brain (Söderberg et al., 1990; Coyle and Puttfarcken, 1993).
Identifying the mechanisms through which nutrients provide
neuroprotective effects will help guide the development of
successful lifelong dietary strategies for healthy brain aging.
Carotenoids are naturally occurring pigments made by plants,
and can only be acquired through the diet (Erdman et al., 2015).
Xanthophylls are a subclass of carotenoids, which have a polar
molecular structure and therefore possess unique membrane-
spanning properties (Erdman et al., 2015; Widomska et al., 2016).
As compared to the other dietary carotenoids, xanthophylls
preferentially accumulate in neural tissue, with lutein accounting
for the majority of carotenoid accumulation in the brain (Craft
et al., 2004; Johnson, 2012; Johnson et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014;
Vishwanathan et al., 2014b; Widomska et al., 2016). As the
most prevalent carotenoid in the brain, lutein is thought provide
a variety of neuroprotective benefits. Candidate mechanisms
of action are primarily based on the unique membrane
spanning properties of lutein and include influencing membrane
properties, such as fluidity, interneuronal communication via gap
junctions, ion exchange, oxygen diffusion, membrane stability,
and preventing oxidation and inflammation (Stahl and Sies,
1996, 2001; Paiva and Russell, 1999; Krinsky, 2002; Izumi-Nagai
et al., 2007; Johnson, 2014; Widomska and Subczynski, 2014;
Erdman et al., 2015). Lutein accretes in the brain across the
entire lifespan, and may therefore contribute to brain health in a
lifelong manner (Renzi et al., 2014; Bovier and Hammond, 2015;
Lieblein-Boff et al., 2015). Notably, lutein is selectively distributed
in gray matter, and has been detected in the prefrontal cortex,
the temporal cortex, and the hippocampus (Craft et al., 2004;
Vishwanathan et al., 2014b). Blood levels of lutein correlate with
brain concentrations of lutein in older adults, suggesting that
blood concentrations can serve a measure of lutein status in the
brain (Johnson et al., 2013).
Lutein status has been linked to cognitive performance across
the lifespan (Feeney et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2013; Renzi
et al., 2014; Vishwanathan et al., 2014a; Bovier and Hammond,
2015). Of particular interest, lutein levels have been linked to
memory and general intelligence (Feeney et al., 2013; Johnson
et al., 2013; Vishwanathan et al., 2014a), which are cognitive
constructs closely related to crystallized intelligence. Crystallized
intelligence refers to the ability to retrieve and use information
that has been acquired throughout life (Horn and Cattell,
1966). Although most aspects of cognitive function undergo age-
related decline, certain aspects of cognition—like crystallized
intelligence—are spared and even show improvement with age
(Craik and Bialystok, 2006; Park and Reuter-Lorenz, 2009).
Measuring crystallized intelligence may therefore be a way to
assess the lifelong impact of nutritional factors, rather than the
immediate effects of nutrients on preventing age-related decline
(Craik and Bialystok, 2006).
Crystallized intelligence is dependent upon the temporal
cortex, and particular regions of the temporal cortex may play
key roles in implementing this cognitive function (Colom et al.,
2009; Barbey et al., 2012). In general, structural integrity of
the temporal cortex is associated with performance on tasks
of crystallized intelligence, but integrity of specific regions
within the temporal cortex may underlie the preservation
of this cognitive function in aging (Choi et al., 2008). For
example, the parahippocampal cortex plays a role in mediating
the storage of knowledge about objects (Ricci et al., 1999;
Aminoff et al., 2013). This region of the temporal cortex
shows resistance to age-related structural decline in the absence
of neurodegenerative disease, unlike other regions within the
temporal cortex that show significant cortical thinning even in
healthy aging (Salat et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2014). Although the
sparing of particular regions within the temporal cortex may be
linked to the preservation of crystallized intelligence in healthy
aging, the question remains: do particular neuroprotective

nutrients like lutein underlie this sparing of cognition and brain
health?
In summary, increasing evidence suggests that lutein may be
a reliable nutrient biomarker for healthy brain aging: (i) among
the carotenoids, lutein accounts for the majority of accumulation
in the brain and provides unique neuroprotective benefits, (ii)
lutein status has been linked to cognitive performance across the
lifespan, and (iii) lutein is selectively distributed in gray matter
of brain regions known to underlie the preservation of cognitive
function in healthy brain aging. However, the core brain
structures upon which lutein may act to preserve cognition have
not been investigated. Prior research suggests that lutein plays a
neuroprotective role across the lifespan, crystallized intelligence
is resistant to age-related decline, and specific regions of the
temporal cortex may underlie the preservation of crystallized
intelligence. This study aims to explore the role of structures
within the temporal cortex in mediating the relationship between
serum lutein levels and crystallized intelligence in healthy older
adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
This cross-sectional study enrolled 122 participants (ages 65–75)
from Carle Foundation Hospital, a local and readily available
cohort of well-characterized older adults. No participants were
cognitively impaired, as defined by a score of lower than 26
on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al., 1975).
Participants with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment,
dementia, psychiatric illness within the last 3 years, stroke
within the past 12 months, and cancer within the last 3
years were excluded. Participants were also excluded for
current chemotherapy or radiation, an inability to complete
study activities, prior involvement in cognitive training or
dietary intervention studies, and contraindications for magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). Of these 122 participants, 76 subjects
had a complete dataset at the time of data analysis, including
neuropsychological testing, MRI, and serum analysis.
Standard Protocol Approval and
Participant Consent
This study was approved by the University of Illinois Institutional
Review Board and, in accordance with the stated guidelines, all
participants read and signed informed consent documents.
Serum Acquisition and Lutein Analysis
Serum was prepared for extraction using 100 µL of sample
and 0.5 mL 0.9% saline. Echinenone, in ethanol, was added as
an internal standard (DSM Nutritional Products). The mixture
was extracted by using 2 mL CHCL3:CH3OH (2:1, vol/vol).
The mixture was vortexed and then centrifuged at 800 g for
15 min at 4◦C. The CHCl3 layer was removed and evaporated
to dryness under nitrogen. A second extraction was performed
on the mixture using 3 mL hexane. The mixture was vortexed
and centrifuged as above. The hexane layer was combined with
the first extraction and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen.
The residue was redissolved in 100 µL of ethanol, vortexed, and
sonicated for 30 s. A 20 µL aliquot was used for HPLC analysis.
Lutein was measured using a reversed-phase, gradient HPLC
system. The system consisted of a Waters Alliance 2695
Separation Module LC pump, auto-sampler, Waters 2996 Photo-
Array Detector (Millipore, Milford, MA) and a semi-bore
C30 column (3 µm, 150 × 4.6 mm, YMC, Wilmington, NC).
The chromatographic separations were performed on a Waters
Alliance 2695 (Millipore, Milford, MA) system using a UV
detector and Waters Empower Pro software. The flow rate
was 0.4 mL/min and the gradient elution used two mixtures of
methanol, tert-butyl methyl ether, and water (mixture A: 83/15/2;
v/v/v), mixture B: 8/90/2, v/v/v). The gradient procedure was: 0
to 1 min 100% A, 1 to 8 min linear gradient to 70% A, 8 to 13 min
70% A, 13 to 22 min linear gradient to 45% A, 22 to 24 min 45%
A, 24 to 34 min linear gradient to 5% A, 34 to 38 min 5% A, 38 to
40 min linear gradient to 100% A, and 40 to 50 min 100% A.
The method yielded adequate separation of lutein, which
was then quantified at 445 nm. Quantification was determined
from peak areas in the HPLC chromatograms calibrated against
known amounts of standards. Concentrations were corrected for
extraction and handling losses by monitoring the recovery of
the echinenone internal standard. The lower detection with this
method is 0.2 pmol. A composite lutein score was computed by
summing across all-trans lutein and cis-lutein.
Neuropsychological Tests
Crystallized
intelligence
was
measured
by
the
Wechsler
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence–second edition (WASI-II)
(Wechsler,
1999).
This
assessment
measured
crystallized
intelligence by way of a verbal comprehension index, which
was the product of two subtests: a vocabulary subtest and a
similarities subtest. In the vocabulary subtest, participants were
asked to verbally define vocabulary words (i.e., What does
lamp mean?) that became progressively more challenging. In
the similarities subtest, participants were asked to relate pairs
of concepts (i.e., How are a cow and bear alike?) that became
progressively more challenging. These subtests were compiled
into a verbal comprehension index, which provided a measure
of acquired knowledge, verbal reasoning, and attention to verbal
information, and therefore served as a marker of crystallized
intelligence.
Volumetric Brain MRI
Volumetric analysis was performed on data from a 3D high-
resolution (0.9 mm isotropic) T1-weighted scan using MPRAGE
acquisition. Cortical reconstruction was performed with the
Freesurfer image analysis suite, which is documented and
freely available for download online (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.
harvard.edu/). The technical details of these procedures are
described in prior publications (Dale and Sereno, 1993; Dale
et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 1999a,b, 2001, 2002, 2004; Fischl
and Dale, 2000; Fischl, 2004; Ségonne et al., 2004; Han et al.,
2006; Jovicich et al., 2006; Reuter et al., 2010, 2012). All
cortical reconstructions were manually checked for accuracy,
as recommended by the software developers. The volumetric
analyses focused on gray matter volume in the temporal cortex

provided by Freesurfer parcellation. Regions of interest included
the superior temporal cortex, middle temporal cortex, inferior
temporal cortex, banks of the superior temporal sulcus, fusiform
cortex, transverse temporal cortex, entorhinal cortex, temporal
pole, and parahippocampal cortex.
Covariates
Covariates were included according to previous association
with cognitive decline. These included age (continuous),
gender (nominal, man/woman), education (nominal, five fixed
levels), income (nominal, six fixed levels), body mass index
(continuous, hereafter BMI), and depression status (nominal,
yes/no). Although all participants had received a diagnosis of
no depression at enrollment, the SF-36 Health Survey (Ware
et al., 1993) revealed four participants with symptoms consistent
with depression, and in accordance with other studies, this was
considered in the analysis as a covariate. Temporal cortex gray
matter volume (continuous) was also included as a covariate in
mediation analyses to assess the relationship between specific
regions within the temporal cortex, serum lutein, and crystallized
intelligence. These covariates were included in each of the three
steps of the mediation analysis.
Statistical Analyses
A formal mediation analysis was used in an effort to
better understand the relationship between serum lutein, gray
matter volume of regions within the temporal cortex, and
crystallized intelligence using a three-step framework. The
primary requirement for mediation is a significant indirect
mediation effect, Zhao et al. (2010) defined as the effect of the
independent variable (lutein) through the mediator (gray matter
volume of regions within the temporal cortex) on the dependent
variable (crystallized intelligence) (Figure 1).
Statistics were performed in SPSS Statistical Packages version
23 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and mediation analyses were
performed using the indirect macro designed for SPSS (Preacher
and Hayes, 2008). In the first step, a regression model was used
to characterize the relationship between serum lutein and gray
matter volume of regions within the temporal cortex (path a),
controlling for the covariates listed above and applying a false
discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons (q <
0.05, one-tailed). In the second step, a regression model was
used to characterize the relationship between serum lutein and
crystallized intelligence (path c), controlling for the covariates
listed above. In the third step, the indirect macro was used
to implement the bootstrapping method to estimate mediation
effects. This analysis drew 1000 bootstrapped samples with
replacement from the dataset to estimate a sampling distribution
for the indirect and direct mediation effects, controlling for the
covariates listed above. The indirect mediation effect refers to the
pathway from serum lutein to gray matter volume of temporal
cortex regions to crystallized intelligence (path a to b). The direct
mediation effect refers to the direct pathway from serum lutein
to crystallized intelligence (path c’). A statistically significant full
mediation that matches the hypothesized framework is indicated
by: (i) an indirect mediation effect that does not include zero
within 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals, and (ii) a direct
mediation effect that does include zero within 95% bias-corrected
confidence intervals. A statistically significant partial mediation,
(i.e., the mediation does not account for all possible mediators) is
indicated by: (i) an indirect mediation effect that does not include
zero within 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals, and (ii) a
direct mediation effect that does not include zero within 95%
bias-corrected confidence intervals (Zhao et al., 2010). Results
are reported using unstandardized regression coefficients (β)
and statistical significance (p) for each individual regression
relationship, and a 95% bias-corrected confidence interval (95%
CI) for the direct and indirect effects of the mediation.

parahippocampal cortex (Brodmann’s Area 34) mediated the
relationship between serum lutein and crystallized intelligence.
Each relationship within the mediation is described below in a
stepwise fashion.
First, higher serum lutein levels were associated with larger
volume of one region within the temporal cortex, the right
parahippocampal cortex (β = 0.336, p = 0.003, Table 2).
Therefore, the relationship between serum lutein concentration
and gray matter volume of the right parahippocampal cortex was
considered in the context of the mediation model (β = 0.336,
p = 0.003, Figure 2, path a). Second, higher serum levels of lutein
associated with superior crystallized intelligence (β = 0.018, p =
0.002, Figure 2, path c). Third, mediation effects were estimated
for the right parahippocampal cortex. The indirect pathway of
mediation was significant (95% CI: 0.002–0.013, β = 0.016, p =
0.006, Figure 2, path a to b), and the direct pathway of mediation
was significant (95% CI: 0.0007–0.023, β = 0.012, p = 0.037,
Figure 1, path c’). Therefore, the right parahippocampal cortex
partially mediated the relationship between serum lutein and
crystallized intelligence (Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
This study revealed that gray matter volume of the right
parahippocampal cortex mediates the relationship between
serum lutein and crystallized intelligence. This report provides
a novel link between lutein, gray matter volume of a specific

Lutein, Parahippocampal Cortex, and Crystallized Intelligence
FIGURE 2 | A mediation model was used to characterize the relationship between serum lutein, gray matter volume of regions within the temporal
cortex, and crystallized intelligence. Serum lutein concentrations positively associated with gray matter volume of the right parahippocampal cortex (path a).
Serum lutein positively associated with crystallized intelligence (path c). The indirect pathway of mediation (i.e., the effect of serum lutein through gray matter volume of
the right parahippocampal cortex on crystallized intelligence; path a to b) was statistically significant. Likewise, the direct pathway of mediation (i.e., the effect of serum
lutein on crystallized intelligence; path c’) was statistically significant. Therefore, gray matter volume of the right parahippocampal cortex partially mediated the
relationship between serum lutein and crystallized intelligence.
cortical region, and crystallized intelligence. The individual
relationships reported within the mediation, including those
between serum lutein levels and parahippocampal cortex
(Figure 2, path a), between serum lutein levels and crystallized
intelligence (Figure 2, path c), and between parahippocampal
cortex and crystallized intelligence (Figure 2, path b), are each
supported by prior findings reviewed in turn below.
Prior findings support each relationship reported within the
mediation model. The first relationship demonstrated a positive
association between serum lutein and gray matter volume of
the parahippocampal cortex in the right hemisphere (Figure 2,
path a). Four lines of evidence support this finding: (i) serum
lutein correlates with brain concentrations of lutein in older
adults, (ii) lutein preferentially accumulates in brain tissue,
(iii) xanthophylls are selectively distributed in gray matter, as
opposed to white matter, and (iv) lutein is found in the temporal
cortex (Craft et al., 2004; Johnson, 2012; Johnson et al., 2013;
Vishwanathan et al., 2014b). Second, higher serum levels of lutein
were associated with higher scores of crystallized intelligence
(Figure 2, path c). Prior work demonstrates that intake of green
leafy and cruciferous vegetables—both major dietary sources of
lutein—is positively associated with cognitive function (Kang
et al., 2005; Morris et al., 2006). Indeed, macular pigment optical
density (MPOD), a biomarker of lutein concentrations in the
brain, has been reported to be significantly related to cognitive
function in three independent research groups (Feeney et al.,
2013; Vishwanathan et al., 2013, 2014a, 2016; Renzi et al., 2014).
Among the carotenoids, lutein most consistently associates with
measures of intelligence and memory (Johnson et al., 2008,
2013). Third, the indirect pathway of mediation indicated a
mediatory effect of right parahippocampal gray matter volume
on the relationship between lutein and crystallized intelligence
(Figure 2, path a to b). Previous studies indicate that greater
temporal cortex gray matter volume correlates with general
intelligence, and the parahippocampal cortex in particular shows
activity during tasks that require auditory-verbal recall (Grasby
et al., 1993; Colom et al., 2009). Furthermore, healthy aging
is characterized by the preservation of crystallized intelligence
as well as structural integrity of the parahippocampal cortex
(Horn and Cattell, 1966; Salat et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2014).
The unilateral nature of this mediation is supported by work
suggesting that the right hemisphere is more resistant to age-
related and disease-related neurodegeneration than the left
hemisphere (Chételat et al., 2005; Querbes et al., 2009; Risacher
et al., 2010; Mosconi et al., 2014).
The underlying physiological mechanisms of the relationship
between serum lutein levels, crystallized intelligence, and
cortical integrity of the parahippocampal cortex are 3-fold.
First, lutein is differentially localized to membrane domains
high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, and is therefore well
positioned to prevent oxidation of vulnerable lipids (Widomska
and Subczynski, 2014). Second, by preventing lipid oxidation,
lutein may help preserve long-chain polyunsaturated fats, such
as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), for cleavage and conversion
into anti-inflammatory compounds (Miller et al., 2014). Third,
lutein is a polar and soluble molecule, and can therefore span
the membrane and influence membrane properties, such as
fluidity, ion exchange, oxygen diffusion, membrane stability, and
interneuronal communication via gap junctions (Stahl and Sies,
2001). Importantly, these neuroprotective effects are relevant
across the lifespan, and may therefore be particularly important
for the preservation of cognitive functions that are enhanced with

Lutein, Parahippocampal Cortex, and Crystallized Intelligence
increasing age, such as crystallized intelligence (Horn and Cattell,
1966; Bovier and Hammond, 2015; Lieblein-Boff et al., 2015).
The partial nature of this mediation is supported by the
specificity of this analysis, which focused on one aspect of
cognition and its underlying cortical structures. Given that
lutein is thought to influence a wide range of biological
processes in the brain, it is unlikely that the role of lutein
in the aging brain is limited to crystallized intelligence and
the parahippocampal cortex (Erdman et al., 2015). Rather than
claiming the parahippocampal cortex as the sole mediator of
the relationship between lutein and crystallized intelligence,
this study suggests that preserving structural integrity of the
parahippocampal cortex is one mechanism through which
lutein contributes to the preservation of cognitive function.
These findings add to a growing line of evidence which
suggests that particular nutrients may slow or prevent aspects
of age-related cognitive decline by targeting specific features
of brain aging (Bowman et al., 2012; Zamroziewicz et al.,
2015; Gu et al., 2016). In the case of lutein, future studies
are needed to assess whether lutein is uniquely protective
of crystallized intelligence and temporal cortex structure, or
whether other carotenoids contribute neuroprotective effects
as well. Another promising direction for future work is to
examine the interactive effects among nutrients through the use
of nutrient biomarker pattern analysis—a technique that enables
an investigation of the beneficial effects of broader nutrient
profiles on healthy brain aging. Ultimately, this line of research
can inform a comprehensive and personalized approach to
nutritional intervention that takes into account dietary patterns
and individual variability in nutritional status and brain health.
The strengths of the present study include: (i) the use of
blood biomarkers to measure physiological status of lutein, (ii)
the use of structural magnetic resonance imaging to measure
regional cortical integrity with high spatial resolution, and (iii)
the assessment of a particular component of cognitive function
known to be highly variable across individuals, rather than a
global cognitive function measure with little variability within
a sample. The limitations of this study include: (i) relatively
small sample size, (ii) cross-sectional design, (iii) lack of MPOD
measurement to better reflect lutein concentrations in neural
tissue (Vishwanathan et al., 2013, 2016), and (iv) lack of
assessment of other carotenoids. Thus, directions for future
research include: (i) larger samples to confirm these results, (ii)
longitudinal studies to investigate the relationship between serum
lutein and crystallized intelligence in different stages of life, (iii)
MPOD measures of lutein in neural tissue, and (iv) assessment
of other carotenoids to determine potential neuroprotective
benefits.
