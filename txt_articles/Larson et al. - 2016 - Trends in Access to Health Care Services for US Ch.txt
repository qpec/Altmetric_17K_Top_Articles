abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent years have witnessed substantial gains in health insurance 
coverage for children, but few studies have examined trends across a diverse set of access 
indicators. We examine US children’s access to health services and whether trends vary by 
race/ethnicity and income.
METHODS: Analysis of 178 038 children ages 0 to 17 from the 2000 to 2014 National Health 
Interview Survey. Trends are examined for health insurance and 5 access indicators: no 
well-child visit in the year, no doctor office visit, no dental visit, no usual source of care, and 
unmet health needs. Logistic regression models add controls for sociodemographics and 
child health status. Statistical interactions test whether trends vary by race/ethnicity and 
income.
RESULTS: Among all children, uninsured rates declined from 12.1% in 2000 to 5.3% in 2014, 
with improvement across all 5 access indicators. Along with steep declines in the uninsured 
rate, Hispanic children had sizeable improvement for no doctor office (19.8% to 11.9%), no 
dental visit (43.2% to 21.8%), and no usual source of care (13.9% to 6.3%). Black children 
and those in poor and near-poor families also had large gains. Results from adjusted 
statistical interaction models showed more improvement for black and Hispanic children 
versus whites for 3 of 5 access indicators and for children in poor and near-poor families for 
4 of 5 access indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: Children’s access to health services has improved since 2000 with greater gains 
in vulnerable population groups. Findings support a need for continued support of health 
insurance for all children.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Previous 
research has shown steep declines in the uninsured 
rate for children. Few studies have examined trends 
across a broad range of health service access 
indicators and whether trends vary by race/ethnicity 
and income.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: From 2000 to 2014, US 
children’s access improved for well-child visits, 
doctor visits, dental visits, usual source of care, and 
unmet health needs. Improvements were larger for 
black and Hispanic children and those in poor and 
near-poor families.

Major policy initiatives over the 
past couple of decades have had 
a dramatic impact on improving 
health care coverage for children. 
The percentage of US children 
younger than 18 years without health 
insurance has declined by two-thirds 
from 14.9% in 1997 to 4.8% in 2015. 
1 
Among those age 5 and younger, 
the decrease has been even steeper, 
declining >75% from 13% to 3.2%. 
2 
Multiple studies demonstrate large 
gains in US children’s public health 
insurance through Medicaid and the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program 
(CHIP), along with the declines in the 
uninsured rate.

Although expansion in health 
insurance coverage is expected to 
improve access to health services, 
relatively few studies have assessed 
trends in children’s access to 
health services. Available evidence 
suggests improvements for certain 
indicators, such as having a usual 
source of care or well-child visit. 
3, 
 
7 
 
–10 
Further, expansions in public 
insurance might especially benefit 
access for vulnerable populations, 
but limited studies have examined 
access trends by race/ethnicity and 
income and whether the magnitude 
of disparities has diminished as 
insurance coverage has expanded. 
Existing evidence points to possibly 
greater improvements for black and 
Hispanic children compared with 
white children for certain indicators, 
such as seeing a doctor or dentist, 
but results are mixed and vary by 
outcome and study population. 
3, 
 
11 
– 
13
Despite tremendous gains in public 
coverage, estimates suggest that 
millions of children could become 
ineligible for public or subsidized 
coverage by 2019 if funding for 
the separate state CHIP programs 
expires or states are allowed to roll 
back Medicaid and CHIP eligibility 
thresholds to statutory minimums. 
14, 
 
15 
To inform future health care policy 
decisions, therefore, it is vital to 
assess not only rates of insurance for 
children, but corresponding changes 
in health care access and disparities 
in access.
This study uses data from the 
National Health Interview Survey 
(NHIS) to examine trends since 2000 
in children’s access to health services 
and whether trends vary by race/
ethnicity and income. The study also 
examines shifts in children’s health 
insurance coverage and the degree 
to which these shifts might explain 
changes in health care access. To 
our knowledge, this is the first study 
to examine long-term trends in US 
children’s access across a diverse set 
of indicators while also investigating 
shifts in the magnitude of disparities 
over time and the role of insurance 
coverage in contributing to access 
changes.
METHODS
Sample
Data are from the 2000 to 2014 NHIS, 
a nationally representative, cross-
sectional survey of US households 
that has been conducted annually 
by the National Center for Health 
Statistics since 1957. The year 
2000 was chosen to investigate 
trends because it marked the 
turn of the century and because 
consistent wording for health 
care access indicators has been 
available since then. Within each 
household, a sample child aged 0 to 
17 was selected and information was 
obtained from an in-person interview 
with a parent or adult knowledgeable 
about the child’s health and health 
care. The response rate for the 
sample child file ranged from 79.4% 
in 2000 to 66.6% in 2014.
From 2000 to 2014, there were 
179 542 children in the NHIS sample 
child files. The sample was further 
restricted to include only individuals 
without missing data on the study 
covariates (n = 178 038). Missing 
data were singly imputed for race/
ethnicity and multiply imputed for 
family income by statisticians at the 
National Center for Health Statistics 
and applied to our analyses. There is 
some variability in sample size across 
different health care outcomes due to 
missing data and because the dental 
visit question was asked only for 
children ages 1 to 17.
To produce population-based 
estimates, data records were 
assigned a sampling weight. Weights 
were designed to minimize bias 
by incorporating adjustments for 
various forms of survey nonresponse. 
Further details on the NHIS design 
are reported elsewhere. 
16 This study 
was exempt from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics Institutional 
Review Board.
Measures
Health Insurance Coverage
Parents reported the type of health 
insurance coverage children had at 
the time of interview. Responses 
were coded to private, public, and 
uninsured. Private coverage included 
those with employer-sponsored 
coverage, family-purchased private 
plans, and military coverage. Public 
coverage included children with 
Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, or other 
state-sponsored insurance. Children 
identified as having both private and 
public insurance were classified into 
private. Following standard coding 
used in other studies, uninsured 
children included those with no 
coverage or only limited coverage 
through Indian Health Service or 
single-service plans such as accidents 
or dental care.

Health Care Access
The study includes 5 measures of 
children’s access to health care. 
Parents reported whether the 
child had “a well-child visit, that 
is a general check-up, when he/
she was not sick or injured” at any 
time during the past year. Parents 
also reported whether the child 
had seen a doctor or health care 
professional at a doctor’s office, 
clinic, or some other place in the

past year (excludes hospitalizations, 
emergency department visits, home 
visits, telephone calls, and dental 
visits). No dental visit was measured 
by parent report of whether the 
child had seen any type of dental 
professional (including dentists, 
oral surgeons, orthodontists, and 
dental hygienists) in the past year. 
No usual source of care was indicated 
if the parent answered “no” to the 
question, “Is there a place that (the 
child) usually goes when he/she is 
sick or you need advice about his/
her health?” Consistent with the 
Healthy People definition, children 
reported to receive care in a hospital 
emergency department also were 
coded as having no usual source. To 
identify unmet health care needs, 
parents were asked, “During the 
past 12 months, was there any time 
when (the child) needed any of the 
following, but didn't get it because 
you couldn’t afford it: medical care, 
prescription medication, dental care, 
mental health care, or counseling?”
Race/Ethnicity and Income
Children were categorized into 4 
racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, 
and other (also includes multiple 
race). Federal poverty level (FPL) 
guidelines were used to classify 
children into 3 income categories: 
poor (<100% FPL), near-poor 
(100%–199% FPL), and not poor 
(≥200% FPL).
Analysis
Trends in health insurance coverage 
and health care access were 
determined for US children overall 
and by race/ethnicity and income. 
Among all children, bivariate access 
trends were assessed via logistic 
regression models. Study year 
was entered as a predictor with a 
quadratic term allowed if nested 
F tests revealed improvement in model 
fit. Tests for trend were conducted 
via t tests of the average marginal 
effect for year. Adjusted logistic 
regression models added controls 
for child age (in years), child sex, 
child race/ethnicity, family income, 
number of parents, household 
education level, and global child 
health status (excellent, very good, 
good, fair, poor). A second set of 
models also added health insurance 
coverage. For ease of interpretation, 
results are presented as average 
marginal effects for year multiplied 
by 100, so coefficients represent the 
average percentage point change per 
year. For example, a value of −1.0 
would indicate an average decline 
of 1 percentage point per year in the 
prevalence of an access indicator. 
To assess for possible variations in 
trends by race/ethnicity and income, 
separate adjusted logistic regression 
models assessed statistical 
interactions between these variables 
and study year. Average marginal 
effects for year were determined by 
race/ethnicity and/or income for 
those access indicators in which the 
global test of the interaction was 
significant (P < .05).
RESULTS
Health Insurance Trends
 
Table 1 shows trends in health 
insurance coverage for US children. 
The uninsured rate declined by more 
than 50% from 12.1% of children 
in 2000 to 5.3% in 2014 (P < .05). 
Adjusted to the size of the child 
population in 2000, this amounts to 
an additional 4.9 million children 
who gained insurance over the 
study period. This was accompanied 
by an increase in public coverage 
(18.9% to 38.9%) and decrease in 
private coverage (69.0% to 55.8%). 
Health insurance trends by race/
ethnicity and income are shown in 
 
Fig 1. Panels A and B show a steep 
narrowing of the disparities in the 
uninsured rate by race/ethnicity 
and income. The uninsured rate for 
Hispanic children declined by 64% 
from 26.1% in 2000 to 9.3% in 2014. 
This decline narrowed the gap versus 
white children (8.2% to 4.0%). Rates 
for black children declined by 72%, 
going from 11.7% to 3.3%, which 
eliminated the gap versus white 
children in 2014. Trends by income 
show steeper declines for children 
in poor (22.2% to 5.9%) and near-
poor (21.2% to 8.8%) families than 
for others (6.0% to 3.5%). Increases 
in public coverage and decreases in 
private coverage were found across 
all racial/ethnic and income groups.

Health Care Access Trends
 
Table 2 shows trends in parent-
reported health care access for 
US children. Health care access 
improved across all 5 indicators. 
Rates for no well-child visit declined 
from 29.0% to 16.2%, no doctor 
office visit from 12.9% to 8.6%, no 
dental visit from 29.6% to 20.7%, 
no usual source of care from 7.0% 
to 3.6%, and unmet health care need 
from 7.9% to 5.8% (all P < .05). 
Adjusted to the size of the US child 
population in 2000, this amounts to 
an additional 9.3 million children 
with a well-child visit in 2014 
compared with 2000, 3.1 million 
children with a doctor office visit, 
6.1 million children with a dental 
visit, 2.5 million children with a 
usual source of care, and 1.5 million 
more children with no reported 
unmet health care needs. Although 
the rate of improvement for some 
indicators, such as doctor visits, 
appeared constant over time, others 
showed faster improvement in more 
recent years.
Health care access trends by race/
ethnicity and income are shown 
in  
Fig 2. No well-child visit rates 
had steep declines over time for all 
racial/ethnic and income groups. 
No visits to a doctor’s office also 
declined across all subgroups with 
slightly larger improvements for 
Hispanic (19.8% to 11.9%) and 
black children (14.4% to 8.8%) 
compared with white children 
(10.7% to 6.8%) and for those in 
poor (17.0% to 10.6%) and near-
poor families (18.0% to 10.8%). 
For dental visits, there was a steep 
narrowing of disparities over time. 
No dental visit rates were cut by 
50.0% for Hispanic children (43.2% 
to 21.8%) and by 37.0% for black 
children (32.8% to 20.7%), which 
nearly eliminated the disparities 
versus white children (25.1% to 
19.5%). Steeper declines were also 
seen for children in poor (41.6% 
to 25.1%) and near-poor families 
(37.3% to 25.3%) compared with 
others (23.5% to 17.0%). For no 
usual source of care, there was a 
slight narrowing of disparities over 
time. Improvements were slightly 
larger for Hispanic (13.9% to 6.3%) 
and black children (8.4% to 3.6%) 
compared with white children (4.7% 
to 2.2%) and for those in near-poor 
families (10.9% to 4.8%). For unmet 
health care needs, there was an 
apparent narrowing of disparities 
for children in poor (12.8% to 8.5%) 
and near-poor families (13.0% to 
7.2%) compared with others (4.8% 
to 4.2%).
Multivariable Results
In logistic regression models 
that control for possible 
sociodemographic and child health 
status shifts over time, improvements 
in health care access were still found 
across all 5 indicators (see  
Table 3). 
Adjusted average annual percentage 
point changes were −0.89 for no 
well-child visit, −0.34 for no doctor 
office visit, −0.73 for no dental visit, 
−0.20 for no usual source of care, 
and −0.11 for unmet health needs. 
Results from adjusted statistical 
interaction models showed that the

rate of improvement varied by race/
ethnicity for 3 access indicators. 
For example, no doctor office visits 
showed larger improvement for 
Hispanic (marginal effect: −0.59, SE: 
0.05) and black children (marginal 
effect: −0.37, SE: 0.06) compared 
with white children (marginal 
effect: −0.22, SE: 0.03). Patterns 
were similar for no dental visit and 
no usual source of care. By income, 
variations in trends were found for 
4 access indicators. For example, no 
dental visit rates improved more for 
children in poor (marginal effect: 
−1.15, SE: 0.07) and near-poor 
(marginal effect: −0.97, SE: 0.07) 
families than for others (marginal 
effect: −0.47, SE: 0.04). Patterns were 
similar for no doctor visit, no usual 
source of care, and unmet health care 
needs. Among all children, results 
of the baseline model compared 
with a model also controlling for 
health insurance status reveals an 
attenuation in the marginal effect 
for year across all access indicators. 
For statistical interaction models, 
differential impacts by race/ethnicity 
and income were also attenuated 
when controlling for health insurance 
status. For doctor visits, shifts in 
health insurance coverage appeared 
to fully explain the steeper gains 
in access for black and Hispanic 
children versus white children and 
for those in poor and near-poor 
families versus others. For no usual 
source of care, steeper improvements 
for children in low-income families 
were fully explained by differential 
gains in coverage.
DISCUSSION
This study found steep 
improvements in US children’s access 
to health services across a diverse 
set of indicators since the start of 
the century. These improvements 
were independent of possible 
sociodemographic or child health 
status shifts. For population impact, 
the study showed large gains in the 
number of children gaining access 
to health services; for example, an 
estimated 9.3 million more children 
had a well-child visit in 2014 
compared with 2000. Furthermore, 
statistical interaction models showed 
that disparities by race/ethnicity 
were reduced over time for 3 of 5 
access indicators and disparities 
by income were reduced for 4 of 5 
access indicators.
Among all children, shifts in health 
insurance coverage appeared to 
explain some, but not all of the 
gains in access to care over time. 
Not surprisingly, insurance gains 
appeared to have the most impact 
for children in more disadvantaged 
racial/ethnic and income groups 
as evidenced by attenuation in 
differential rates of improvement 
when controlling for health 
insurance status. Multiple studies 
using different data sources have 
shown that, at least for basic 
access indicators, such as having 
a preventive doctor visit or usual 
source of care, children with public 
health insurance coverage tend to 
fare as well as those with private 
coverage and better than children 
who are uninsured. 
17

22
Beyond increasing health insurance 
coverage rates, improving health 
care quality for children has been 
a major focus of recent policy 
initiatives such as the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program 
Reauthorization Act of 2009. Many 
states have implemented quality 
monitoring programs to track 
indicators like well-child visits 
along with offering performance 
improvement programs targeting 
specific goals, such as increasing 
well-child and dental visit rates. 
23, 
 
24 
This expanded focus on quality 
might help explain why some 
access indicators showed rapid 
improvements during the later years 
of the study. There is substantial 
program variation across states 
and many additional factors, such 
as shifts in parent beliefs about the 
importance of regular health care for 
their children, could also contribute 
to improvement in children’s access 
to and utilization of health services.
Improvements in access and 
reduction in disparities were 
particularly large for certain access 
indicators like seeing a dentist. States 
are now required to provide dental 
services to all children enrolled 
in Medicaid and CHIP. Numerous

children enrolled in public

recent years in the number and 
percentage of enrollees with a

Hispanic children had particularly 
impressive gains with the uninsured 
rate, no dental visit rate, and no 
usual source of care rate all reduced 
by 50% or more over the study 
period. Previous studies have 
shown substantial improvements 
in the uninsured rate for Hispanic 
children. 
3, 
 
31, 
 
32 This study found that 
a larger portion of Hispanic gains 
in access were explained by health 
insurance compared with white 
children. These findings suggest that 
policy initiatives aimed at improving 
health insurance coverage and access 
have had an impact, especially for 
children in vulnerable population 
groups.
Improving insurance coverage and 
access to health services are worthy 
policy goals for many reasons. 
Data from the Oregon Medicaid 
expansions indicate that having 
publicly provided health insurance 
provides an enhanced degree of 
financial security for poor and 
near-poor families and increases 
self-reported health status among 
adults. 
33 Studies also have shown 
improved future health outcomes 
for children who gained Medicaid 
coverage during early childhood 
or had their mother gain coverage 
during the prenatal period. 
34, 
 
35 
A possible role for public coverage 
in improving children’s health also 
is suggested by research showing 
a decrease in childhood mortality 
differentials between children in 
poor and rich counties of the United 
States during the same time period of

major expansions in public coverage 
programs.

These findings and others support 
the need for efforts to provide 
insurance coverage and promote 
fairness and access to health care for 
all children. 
37, 
 
38 Extending Medicaid 
and CHIP funding into the future 
will help ensure continued coverage 
for children. 
37, 
 
39, 
40 Efforts are also 
needed to address issues such as 
quality of care, discontinuity of 
insurance coverage, and adequate 
payment levels for providers 
caring for children with public 
health insurance. 
37, 
 
38 Furthermore, 
although the Affordable Care Act 
has potential for moving children 
into exchange-based coverage, 
many issues regarding affordability, 
accessibility, and quality of care 
incident on such a shift remain to be 
resolved. 
6, 
 
41 As primary providers 
of health services for children, 
pediatricians are in an excellent 
position to advocate for the health 
insurance and health care needs of 
children and ensure families are 
aware of available programs and 
services.
Study strengths include the use of 
nationally representative NHIS data 
with consistent measurement used 
across multiple study years and the 
ability to link health insurance and 
health care access. Study limitations 
include, first, a reliance on parent 
report of children’s health services 
that were not validated against the 
medical record. Second, there was 
potential nonresponse bias within 
the NHIS, and third, the study 
was limited to factors that were 
continuously available in NHIS since 
2000. Notably, activities happening 
on the state, community, and health 
system levels are likely key factors 
influencing and explaining the 
trends, but are not collected within 
the NHIS.
CONCLUSIONS
This study found consistent 
improvement in children’s 
access to health services 
since 2000. Improvements were 
generally steeper for black and 
Hispanic children and those in 
poor and near-poor families, and 
appeared to be at least partially 
explained by gains in public health 
insurance coverage. Findings 
support a need for ongoing efforts 
to provide insurance coverage and 
improved access to care for all 
children.
