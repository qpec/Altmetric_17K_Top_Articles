SUMMARY   
Aims: To describe consumption trends of three groups of analgesics (non-opioids, mild and strong 
opioids) between 2006 and 2015 in France, and compare this pattern of use with six European 
countries in 2015.  
Methods: Annual drugs sales were extracted from the French national authority’s consumption 
database and from the IMS-MIDAS and national databases for European countries.  
Results: The use of mild opioids in France decreased by 53% during the last 10 years due to the 
declining use of dextropropoxyphene combinations, along with an increase in the use of non-opioids 
and strong opioids (from 72 to 93 and 2 to 2.8 defined daily doses/1,000 inhabitants/day, 
respectively). Paracetamol, the most-consumed analgesic, has increased during the last 10 years, 
particularly for the adult high dosage (+140%). The use of tramadol and codeine combinations has 
also increased by 62% and 42%, respectively. Morphine remained the most-used strong opioid 
although there were also high increases in the consumption of oxycodone (+613%) and fentanyl 
(+263% and +72% for transmucosal and transdermal forms, respectively). A comparison of the 
patterns of use in Europe in 2015 showed a higher consumption of both mild and strong opioids in 
the UK. France ranked first and third place respectively for paracetamol and mild opioid 
consumption, while its strong opioid use was among the lowest.  
Conclusions:  Paracetamol consumption is clearly highest in France, while its use of strong opioids is 
amongst the lowest in Europe, although the consumption of oxycodone has increased significantly.  
Further studies are required specifically to monitor these drugs.   
What is known about this subject   
Sales of analgesics are increasing in Europe, raising safety concerns for both over-the-counter drugs 
and opioids. Long-term surveillance of analgesic consumption allows trends to be monitored with a 
view to preventing misuse or overuse and ensuring guidelines are well implemented in clinical 
practice. 
What this study adds   
Over the last decade, paracetamol remained the most-consumed analgesic in France, while the use 
of oxycodone increased significantly. Despite sharing common regulations for medications, different 
patterns of consumption were observed across Europe in 2015. France ranked first for paracetamol 
consumption, but its use of strong opioids was among the lowest.

INTRODUCTION  
Pain is a common issue, and analgesics are among the drugs most frequently used, especially in 
selfmedication [1]. A variety of analgesics with different clinical potencies are available on the 
market. According to the WHO’s three-step ladder for cancer pain relief in adults [2], analgesics are 
categorised into (1) non-opioids, (2) mild opioids and (3) strong opioids. Opioids initially used for 
severe and acute pain management are known to potentially lead to dependence and misuse [3, 4]. 
Gradually, opioid use has spread to non-cancer chronic pain, raising safety concerns [5]. Apart from 
opioids, the use of non-opioids is also a matter of concern, especially for over-the-counter (OTC) 
drugs that may cause adverse drug reactions and increase risks of intoxication [6-8].   
Sales of analgesics have risen steadily over the past 20 years in Europe [9-12]. Indeed, in France, 
analgesics were the most-used therapeutic class within primary care settings in 2013 (22% of the 
market share for all medications) [13]. Paracetamol was the most-consumed medication with more 
than 500 million packs sold, followed by ibuprofen, codeine combinations and tramadol alone or as a 
fixed-dose combination. During the 2006-2015 period, paracetamol was available over the counter, 
and ibuprofen and codeine benefited from two statuses: prescription-only medicine (POM) and 
overthe-counter medicine (OTC), whereas tramadol is only available as a POM. With regard to 
paracetamol, it was the most-widely-prescribed drug in France [14, 15] thanks to its better safety 
profile compared with other analgesics [16].  
Monitoring sales of analgesics has different purposes. By describing the consumption trends of 
different substances, the effects resulting from the withdrawal of problematic drugs and the release 
of new drugs on the market can be analysed. This helps ensure that guidelines promoting the safe 
use and management of drugs are well implemented in clinical practice. It can also help identify the 
mostused substances requiring further surveillance and it could support studies on misuse.  
This study therefore aimed to: (1) describe the consumption trends of all three groups of analgesics 
in France between 2006 and 2015 in order to analyse structural and quantitative changes in use, and 
(2) compare patterns of use with other European countries in 2015. It revealed different practices 
within Europe, and these original results intended to provide a comprehensive view of analgesics, 
regardless of their final use: acute pain, non-cancer chronic pain and cancer chronic pain.  Lastly, the 
study of the trends can reveal switches from one group to another.

METHODS  
Data sources  
Annual drug sales in France (including the five French overseas departments : Guadeloupe, 
Martinique, French Guiana, Réunion, Mayotte) were extracted from the ANSM database on 
consumption for the 2006-2015 time period. This database comprises comprehensive reporting of 
annual pack sales provided each year from pharmaceutical firms to the ANSM. It contains data on 
sales to wholesalers, community pharmacies (retail) and hospitals (non-retail).  
We purchased annual drug sales data from the IMS’s Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System 
(MIDAS) (IMS Health, Danbury, CT, USA) for the five most-populated countries in Europe: Germany, 
France, United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. This database provides an estimate of drug sales in a 
country (estimated product volumes, trends and market share by product and therapeutic class), 
through retail and non-retail channels. In this database, drug sales were measured using standard 
units (i.e., the number of counting units sold divided by the standard unit factor which is the smallest 
common dose of a product form)[17]. This analysis focused on 2015 data. Supplemental data on 
dosages were also retrieved from the respective national authority databases of each country. Data 
on analgesic consumption in Denmark and Sweden for 2015 were extracted online from the Danish 
Health Data Authority and the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden (www.medstat.dk 
and www.socialstyrelsen.se, respectively). For these two countries, the data cover all sales in both 
sectors (retail and hospital) and are directly available in daily dose per 1,000 inhabitants per day.  
Analgesics   
Analgesics were categorised according to the WHO’s three-step ladder [2] as: (1) non-opioids: aspirin 
(excluding aspirin used as platelet aggregation inhibitors) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) (alone 
or in combination), floctafenine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) used for pain relief (i.e., 
diclofenac, tenoxicam, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, tiaprofenic acid, 
dexketoprofen, mefenamic acid, parecoxib, niflumic acid, nimesulide and morniflumate); (2) mild 
opioids: codeine alone or as a fixed-dose combination (codeine with paracetamol or codeine with 
ibuprofen), dihydrocodeine, nefopam, tramadol, tramadol combined with paracetamol, opium 
combinations with paracetamol; and (3) strong opioids: morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, 
hydromorphone, nalbuphine, pethidine and buprenorphine used for pain management. Neither 
adjuvant pain medication (such as steroids, muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants and antispasmodic 
drugs) nor topical analgesics were considered.

Statistical analysis  
For the French market and for IMS Midas data, the data sales were converted into defined daily 
doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day as describes below.  
Data were expressed according to the ATC Classification index, as the number of defined daily doses 
per thousand inhabitants per day (DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day), using the DDD values proposed by 
the WHO [18]. For sales from the French database, they were calculated as follows: number of packs 
sold x number of doses per pack x number of mg per dose x 1,000/DDD in mg x number of 
inhabitants in the country for the year x 365 days. DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose 
per day for a drug’s main indication in adults, regardless of the formulation (paediatric or adult). 
Data from the IMS MIDAS platform were calculated as follows: standard units x number of mg per 
dose x 1,000/DDD in mg x number of inhabitants in the country for the year x 365 days. In 
accordance with the WHO guidelines, DDDs of combination products were assigned by considering 
the daily dose of the main substance. Data on the resident populations were obtained from 
EUROSTAT databases [19].   
Trends in analgesic use were expressed, for the most-commonly-used drugs in each group, as the 
percentage of change in consumption (global variation rates) between 2006 and 2015.   
Additional analyses were performed for over-the-counter or prescription analgesics (i.e., aspirin, 
paracetamol and ibuprofen) according to the formulations and dosages to describe trends among 
paediatric and adult populations.   
Qualitative comparisons of analgesic consumption between the seven European countries in 2015 
were performed for all drugs with marketing authorisation in France. A Chi-squared test was used 
for quantitative comparisons, with a statistical significance considered or p-values ≤ 0.05. An analysis 
was performed including all analgesic substances that are released in European countries apart from 
France (i.e., metamizole, meptazinol, diflunisal, tilidine, propyphenazone, flupirtine, dexibuprofen 
and lornoxicam).    
  
RESULTS  
Consumption trends in France   
During the 10-year study period in France, the consumption of total analgesics showed a slight 
overall decrease of 7%, falling from 133 in 2006 to 123 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day in 2015. 
Although some changes occurred within each group, non-opioids remained the most-consumed 
drugs over the 10year period, with their use increasing from 72 to 93 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day

(+29%) (figure 1). The use of mild opioids decreased steadily until 2011 (-53%), subsequently 
stabilising at 28 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day. In contrast, the use of strong opioids increased by 37% 
between 2006 and 2015 (from 2 to 2.8 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day). Patterns of consumption were 
similar between primary care and hospital settings for all three groups of analgesics (data not 
shown), although the mean consumption during the study period was higher in primary care (20-, 
24- and 4-fold higher for nonopioids, mild and strong opioids, respectively).  
Non-opioids  
The trends in non-opioid use are presented in figure 2. Paracetamol was the most-consumed 
substance, with a continuous increase in use between 2006 and 2015 (+53%). There was a nearly 
twofold decrease in the consumption of aspirin (from 3.8 to 2 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day), whereas 
the use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs remained relatively stable.      
Considering the dosages of the drugs, consumption trends for OTC or prescription-only non-opioids 
revealed that the 1,000-mg tablets of paracetamol have been the most-used drug among adults 
since 2008 (figure 3a). Their consumption increased over the 10-year period (+140%), whereas 
consumption of the 500-mg tablet pack decreased by 20%. Ibuprofen was the second-most-used 
drug, showing increased use for the 400-mg tablets. In contrast, there was a decrease in the use of 
200-mg ibuprofen and aspirin (oral route) (-48% and -68%, respectively). Regarding the paediatric 
formulations, trends were less stable over the time period considered. The use of paracetamol and 
ibuprofen (oral route) was clearly higher compared to aspirin (figure 3b). The use of paediatric oral 
suspensions of paracetamol increased by 39%, in contrast with the use of aspirin (oral route) (-57%) 
and ibuprofen (10%).   
For adult and paediatric formulations of paracetamol, rectal administration was mostly used in 
primary care and decreased by 35% over the 10-year period. In contrast, there was a nearly 
threefold increase in parenteral administration of paracetamol (mostly used in hospital settings).   
  
Opioids  
The consumption of mild opioids between 2006 and 2015 in France is presented in figure 4. 
Dextropropoxyphene combinations were the most-widely-used mild opioids in 2006, but there was a 
twofold decrease in consumption until 2010, the year prior to its withdrawal. Tramadol (alone or in 
combination use) and codeine combinations were the second- and third- most-commonly-used mild 
opioids respectively, showing increased consumption over the 10-year period (+62% and +42%, 
respectively). Opium combinations also showed a twofold increase in consumption, reaching 4.2

DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day. The use of nefopam and dihydrocodeine increased by 158%, but 
remained low in 2015 (0.36 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day).   
Figure 5 presents the consumption trends for the most-commonly-used strong opioids in France. 
Morphine (oral route) remained the most-used substance, although its consumption decreased 
slightly over the 10-year period (-11%). The use of oxycodone increased dramatically by 613% (from 
0.12 to 0.85 DDDs/inhabitants/day). There was also a considerable increase in fentanyl consumption 
for both transmucosal and transdermal forms (+263% and +72%, respectively). The use of other 
strong opioids (nalbuphine, pethidine and buprenorphine) was much lower (<1% of the total strong 
opioid consumption) and tended to decrease over the 10-year period (data not shown).   
Comparison of analgesic use in Europe in 2015  
Overall in 2015, France ranked third among the highest analgesic-consuming countries, behind the 
UK and Spain (121, 188 and 151 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day, respectively), and ranked second along 
with Denmark for non-opioids (100 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day), behind Spain (120 DDDs/1,000 
inhabitants/day). The pattern of non-opioid use differed across Europe (Figure 6). France ranked first 
for paracetamol consumption, followed by Denmark, the UK and Spain. The consumption share of 
ibuprofen among total non-opioids was significantly lower in France compared with most other 
countries (11% vs. 59%, 32% and 25%, for Germany, Spain and Denmark, respectively; p>0.05 for all), 
whereas other NSAIDs and aspirin were used at similar levels.   
Figure 7 presents the opioid consumption of European countries for the year 2015. There was a clear 
higher use of both mild and strong opioids in the UK compared with other countries, primarily due to 
codeine in combination with paracetamol, and oral route/injectable morphine (accounting for 62% 
and 75% of mild and strong opioid use, respectively). France ranked third place for mild opioid 
consumption, with tramadol (alone or in combination use) being the most-used substance (48%). For 
the other countries, the most-commonly-used mild opioids were tramadol (alone or in combination 
use) in Germany, Italy, Spain and Denmark (98%, 82%, 78% and 85%, respectively), and codeine in 
combination with paracetamol in Sweden (54%).   
France consumed the least strong opioids (3.2 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day) along with Italy, with 
fentanyl being the main substance used (38%). Fentanyl also represented the most-commonly-used 
strong opioid in Germany and Italy (40% and 42%, respectively), whereas morphine (oral 
route/injectable), oxycodone and buprenorphine were the most-used drugs in Denmark (40%), 
Sweden (41%) and Spain (47%), respectively.

An analysis including analgesics that were not released in France showed similar patterns of use 
(data not shown).  
  
  
DISCUSSION  
Results from this study highlighted changes in analgesic consumption patterns in France over the last 
ten years, characterised by the decreasing use of dextropropoxyphene combinations, along with an 
increase in the use of paracetamol (particularly the high dosage for adults), other mild opioids 
(tramadol), and strong opioids (oxycodone, fentanyl). Patterns of analgesic consumption differed 
across Europe in 2015. France’s non-opioid consumption was clearly highest, with paracetamol being 
the most-consumed drug, but its use of strong opioids was amongst the lowest.    
The changing pattern of analgesic consumption observed for France in this study is consistent with 
previous reports from France [20, 21] and Europe [10, 21-24]. Withdrawal and new releases of 
marketed drugs may have accounted for the changing consumption patterns. In France, two 
analgesic drugs have been successively withdrawn: noramidopyrine (metamizole) in 2003 and 
dextropropoxyphene/paracetamol in 2011. The decreased consumption of mild opioids until 2011 is 
likely to be explained by the gradual reduced use of dextropropoxyphene combinations until its 
definitive withdrawal from the French market, as recommended by the European Medicines Agency 
[25]. Since their benefits did not outweigh their risks, such as the risk of death from overdose in 
patients taking medicines containing dextropropoxyphene, their withdrawal across the EU was 
announced in 2009. A study conducted in the UK suggested that this measure was effective at 
reducing suicides [26]. The amount of dextropropoxyphene combinations found in this study was 
similar to that found for 2009 in another French study (25 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day) [21]. 
Concomitant with the withdrawal of dextropropoxyphene combinations, national authority 
guidelines were published in 2011 recommending a switch to paracetamol for mild to moderate 
pain, and to NSAIDs, other mild opioids or strong opioids for more intense pain [27]. Prior to these 
guidelines, an impact study conducted in a French regional hospital had suggested a possible switch 
with paracetamol and tramadol as a consequence of the withdrawals of dextropropoxyphene 
combinations [28]. A further survey conducted among prescribers involved in pain management 
confirmed this switch[29]. In our study, the increased consumption of paracetamol, ibuprofen and 
other mild opioids, are likely to result from the implementation of these guidelines by prescribing 
physicians.  
Paracetamol was found to be the most-consumed analgesic in France in 2015 (61.5 DDDs/1,000 
inhabitants/day), representing 64% of the total market share for analgesics. This high consumption

rate is consistent with previous findings [15, 30], and with the fact that paracetamol is perceived as 
safe and is considered the first-choice treatment for chronic pain [31, 32]. The over-the-counter 
availability of paracetamol may also contribute to its high consumption. However, prescriptions of 
paracetamol have previously been estimated to account for 84% of paracetamol sales in France [15], 
therefore self-medication seems to only partly explain the high consumption observed in this study. 
In our study, the significant increase in the use of the 1,000-mg dosage paracetamol highlights the 
need to specifically monitor the sales or prescriptions of these packs [33, 34]. The risk of overdose 
with individual high consequences is quicker reached when the 1,000 mg formulation is used several 
times a day.   
As in this study, changes in opioid consumption have previously been described worldwide [35]. In  
Europe, they were characterised by an increasing use of tramadol, fentanyl and oxycodone [20-24, 
3638]. In Scandinavian countries, the total amount of opioids consumed increased from 2002 to 
2006, due to a clear increase in fentanyl and oxycodone use, whereas the use of morphine 
decreased [23]. In Spain, a 14-fold increase in opioid use was recorded between 1992 and 2006, 
mainly attributable to an increase in prescriptions of fentanyl and tramadol [38]. Moreover, a 
fivefold increase in opioid consumption was observed in Scotland between 1995 and 2010, primarily 
driven by tramadol [24]. Between 2000 and 2010, a high increase in opioid retail sales was also 
observed in Italy for tramadol (+299%) and codeine (+270%) [36] and the prevalence of extended-
release opioids increased in Germany by 103% for tramadol and almost fourfold for fentanyl, 
oxycodone, hydromorphone and buprenorphine [39]. The increased use of strong opioids was found 
to be mainly due to a sevenfold increase in oxycodone consumption, reaching the strong opioid 
market share of morphine in 2015 (32%).   
Oxycodone was launched on the French market in 2002 and may therefore have replaced, together 
with fentanyl, part of morphine use. Since both opioids have similar efficacies and adverse effects, 
pharmaceutical marketing policies have been proposed as the most likely explanation for the 
dramatic rise in oxycodone consumption [23, 40]. Whilst better use of opioids to treat cancer pain 
contributed to their increase, the fear of using morphine that may be associated with the terminal 
phase of illnesses (“morphinophobia”) *41+ has also been suggested as an explanation for the switch 
to other opioids such as fentanyl or oxycodone [38]. However, the prescription of opioids remains 
tricky for healthcare professionals for non-cancer pain. Prescribers have to take into account, 
simultaneously, the aim of the prescription, the adverse effects of opioids and protect society from 
opioid misuse [42]. Moreover, non-rational use of oxycodone prescriptions certainly has a part in the 
growing consumption of opioids. Besides the pain medical use, further dependence might appear. 
Thus, a non-rational use of opioid prescriptions growths, increasing the risk of public health

consequences [43]. Easier administration of transdermal and transmucosal formulations may also 
partly explain the rise in prescriptions of fentanyl [29].  
Apart from the ANSM’s guidelines following the withdrawal of dextropropoxyphene combinations, 
pain management policies and guidelines emphasising the use of opioids for non-cancer pain [44] 
have probably contributed to the increased consumption of opioids. Furthermore, although 
prescriptions of opioids are beneficial for managing chronic pain, there are many ensuing misuses 
*12, 45+. In the United States, the recent example of the “opioid epidemic” led the Center for Disease 
Control to draw up new opioid-prescribing guidelines for the treatment of chronic pain in adults [46, 
47]. French health ministerial action plans for improved pain management have been successively 
applied since 1998. The third one, implemented in 2006-2010, helped improve care and prevent 
acute pain, especially in children and the elderly.   
Recent studies from claims databases have therefore highlighted that opioids were mainly 
prescribed for non-cancer pain in France and the UK [22, 37, 48]. Other possible explanations include 
a rising prevalence of specific painful conditions [49] and misuse [50, 51].   
The difference in analgesic preferences observed between European countries in this study may 
reflect the role of national guidelines, prescription policies and firms’ marketing strategies which can 
differ between the countries [40], but it can also be explained by cultural backgrounds and local 
traditions in managing chronic pain [52, 53].   
Certain limitations must be acknowledged, however, such as a lack of information on the context of 
use. Firstly, although DDD is the recommended methodology, it represents a standard measure that 
may not reflect the real dose consumed. Moreover, the sales data used for this study only provides 
information on the “apparent consumption” and not on the “real consumption”: the proportion of 
these sales that is kept in stock and will be never used cannot be ascertained. It is assumed that 
DDDs were at least reliable for opioids, since drugs dispensed to relieve intense pain should actually 
be consumed, however, we cannot estimate the proportion of abuse or misuse. Secondly, apart 
from analgesia, paracetamol is also indicated for fever. A study from the French adult population 
claims database showed that paracetamol was dispensed along with antibiotics in 40% of 
prescriptions [30], meaning that nearly half the paracetamol reimbursed consumption may not 
reflect pain management. Thirdly, it was not possible to differentiate the reason for the analgesic’s 
use (acute or chronic pain conditions). Nonetheless, our study’s strengths include the 
comprehensive national data on analgesic consumption within both primary care and hospital 
settings in France over a 10-year period, and the analysis of drug sales taking into account analgesics

that are available OTC and as POM. It is, however, impossible to measure the proportion of non-
prescribed and prescribed OTC drugs.   
To our knowledge, this is also the first published study, analysing consumption trends for both 
nonopioids and opioids over the last decade in France.   
In this study, long-term surveillance over the past 10 years has highlighted quantitative and 
qualitative changes in analgesic consumption patterns in France, likely to result from the withdrawal 
of dextropropoxyphene combinations along with the implementation of national guidelines. Despite 
European regulations for medications and the common withdrawal of dextropropoxyphene 
combinations across Europe, there were very different patterns of consumption between countries 
in 2015. France’s use of paracetamol, especially the high dosage for adults, was clearly the highest 
and its use of oxycodone increased sevenfold, although France remained the country with the 
lowest consumption of strong opioids. Further surveillance studies are particularly required to 
monitor the trends of these two drugs in France. The very widespread analgesics consumption raises 
the concern of overuse [54], addiction and misuse (approximately 10% and 25% of opioids users, 
respectively) [55], therefore, considering therapeutic indications may be useful to monitor user 
profiles, trends of misuse and to carry out appropriate preventive measures (e.g., education of 
patients and health professionals to increase appropriate use of medications and early detection of 
misuse).
