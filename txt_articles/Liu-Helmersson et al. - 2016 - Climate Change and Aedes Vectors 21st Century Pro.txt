Warming temperatures may increase the geographic spread of vector-borne diseases into temperate areas. Al-
though a tropical mosquito-borne viral disease, a dengue outbreak occurred in Madeira, Portugal, in 2012; the
first in Europe since 1920s. This outbreak emphasizes the potential for dengue re-emergence in Europe given
changing climates. We present estimates of dengue epidemic potential using vectorial capacity (VC) based on his-
toric and projected temperature (1901–2099). VC indicates the vectors' ability to spread disease among humans.
We calculated temperature-dependent VC for Europe, highlighting 10 European cities and three non-European
reference cities. Compared with the tropics, Europe shows pronounced seasonality and geographical heterogene-
ity. Although low, VC during summer is currently sufficient for dengue outbreaks in Southern Europe to
commence–if sufficient vector populations (either Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) were active and virus were in-
troduced. Under various climate change scenarios, the seasonal peak and time window for dengue epidemic po-
tential increases during the 21st century. Our study maps dengue epidemic potential in Europe and identifies
seasonal time windows when major cities are most conducive for dengue transmission from 1901 to 2099.
Our findings illustrate, that besides vector control, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions crucially reduces the fu-
ture epidemic potential of dengue in Europe.

1. Introduction
Globalization and climate change may increase the risk of the geo-

of
vector-borne
diseases
(Hales
et
al.,
2002;
Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014; McMichael, 2013; Murray et al., 2013;
World Health Organization (WHO), 2015). Changes in temperature var-
iation have profound impacts on mosquito populations, and perhaps as
important as changes in mean temperatures, if not more (Lambrechts
et al., 2011; Vasseur et al., 2014). Since 1950, diurnal temperature ex-
tremes increased across the globe (Vasseur et al., 2014) and magnitudes
of annual temperature cycles increased by 0.4 °C in temperate regions.
This could result in elevated vulnerability within Europe for the intro-
duction and re-establishment of vector-borne diseases such as dengue.
Dengue is a climate sensitive mosquito-borne viral disease that is
generally found in the tropics and subtropics (Murray et al., 2013). Ac-
cording to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization
(WHO), 2012) and recent assessment on global burden of diseases
(GBD2013) (Murray et al., 2015), dengue is now the most important
arboviral disease worldwide that has the largest increases among infec-
tious diseases over the last 20 years. The recent estimates indicate as
many as 390 million infections per year (Bhatt et al., 2013). Aedes mos-
quitoes are the vectors for the four dengue virus serotypes: DENV 1–4
(World Health Organization (WHO), 2012). Ae. aegypti is the primary
vector associated with most major dengue epidemics, while Ae.
albopictus, the secondary vector, is less efficient (Lambrechts et al.,
2010).
Of major concern is the geographic expansion of dengue viruses and
vectors to new areas (Lambrechts et al., 2010; World Health
Organization (WHO), 2009). Reasons for the expansion are complex;
however, main contributing factors include the introduction of Aedes
mosquitoes by shipping (Reiter, 1998) and increasingly importation of
the
dengue
virus
via
viremic
travelers
(Leder
et
al.,
2013;
Wilder-Smith and Gubler, 2008). Subsequent establishment of vectors
after introduction can only be possible if suitable climate and ecological
conditions exist. Having established populations of Aedes vectors and
the conducive climatic conditions, in early autumn 2014, Tokyo, Japan

 recorded the first epidemic of dengue since the Second World War
(Quam et al., 2016). Europe is also suitable for the establishment and
re-establishment of Aedes mosquitoes as evidenced by the following:
Aedes aegypti was historically present in many European countries in-
cluding UK and France (1919), Spain (up to 1953), Portugal (up to
1956), and recently the Netherlands, Russia and Georgia (European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2014; European Cen-
tre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015). In Madeira,
Portugal, Ae. aegypti was documented until 1977–79 and then was re-
established in 2004 and 2005. Madeira experienced its first major den-
gue outbreak in 2012/2013, with more than 2000 cases (European Cen-
tre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2012; Wilder-Smith et al.,
2014a). The rapidly expanding range of Ae. albopictus in Europe
(Lambrechts et al., 2010; European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC), 2013) resulted in the first known autochthonous den-
gue cases in southern France and Croatia in 2010 (La Ruche et al.,
2010) in addition to an importation Ae. albopictus driven outbreak of
chikungunya in 2007 in Italy (Rezza et al., 2007). There are concerns
that Ae. aegypti could be introduced from Russia and Georgia (Abkhazia)
to Western Europe via air or sea traffic, and to Eastern Europe via road
and sea traffic, in addition to the vectors' projected establishment in
Southern Europe (Rogers, 2015). Current surveillance indicates that
Aedes vectors have been introduced or established in much of the Med-
iterranean coast and as far north as the Netherlands (European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015). Therefore, it is im-
portant to assess the dengue epidemic potential (DEP) in Europe.
A few studies have projected dengue risk and epidemic potential for
Europe. They have used either statistical models (Bouzid et al., 2014;
Rogers et al., 2014) or vectorial capacity (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014;
Patz et al., 1998), a Mathematical model, however, with limited range
either geographically, temporally or in terms of climate scenarios. In
this study, we intend to estimate DEP for Europe using vectorial capacity
with increased range of climate scenarios and temporal resolution. Al-
though DEP depends on many factors, this study focuses on the effect
of temperature – past, present, and future – on vectorial capacity of
Aedes mosquitoes.
Vectorial capacity (VC) describes the threshold condition for a
vector's ability to spread disease among humans (Patz et al., 1998;
Massad and Coutinho, 2012), representing the average daily number
of secondary cases generated by one primary case introduced into a sus-
ceptible population (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014). It depends on six vec-
tor parameters (Patz et al., 1998), which are highly influenced by
ambient temperature, both its mean value and diurnal temperature
range (DTR) (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014; Lambrechts et al., 2011;
Carrington et al., 2013). VC has been used to model DEP globally for
both Aedes vectors (Patz et al., 1998; Brady et al., 2014). Very few
models incorporated DTR (Patz et al., 1998) and the temperature de-
pendent transmission probabilities per bite to both humans and
vectors (Lambrechts et al., 2011) when describing DEP (Liu-
Helmersson et al., 2014) or vector competence. Including these factors
would change the projected estimates of the impacts of climate on
DEP, given strong temperature dependence of transmission probabili-
ties per bite in humans and vectors and strong association of DTR with
VC and vector competence (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014; Lambrechts
et al., 2011).
In this study, we modeled VC to project DEP in Europe given changes
in climate. Throughout this study, we have included DTR in all of our VC
calculations. We expanded our previous relative VC model to VC, by in-
cluding temperature dependent dynamics in the female vector-to-
human population ratio (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014) for both Ae.
aegypti and Ae. albopictus under four projected emission scenarios
with higher temporally and spatially resolution over two centuries.
We estimated DEP for local dengue transmission, in terms of seasonali-
ty, intensity and duration, for Europe and examined ten European met-
ropolitan cities ranging from North to South for the period 1901–2099
(for more details see Table S3 in the Supplementary information).
2. Methods
Vectorial capacity (VC) was used to estimate dengue epidemic po-
tential (DEP). As shown in Equation (Hales et al., 2002; Patz et al.,
1998; Massad and Coutinho, 2012), VC depends on six vector parame-
ters:
VC ¼ ma2bhbme−μmn
μm
:
ð1Þ
The six vector parameters used were 1) the average vector biting
rate (a), 2) the probability of vector to human transmission per bite
(bh), 3) the probability of human to vector infection per bite (bm),
4) the duration of the extrinsic incubation period – EIP (n), 5) the vector
mortality rate (μm), and 6) the female vector-to-human population ratio
(m). The time unit is one day. Each of the vector parameters depends on
temperature (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014). The temperature relation-
ships for the first five vector parameters, 1)–5), were obtained from
the peer-reviewed literature for Ae. aegypti; details are described else-
where (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014). For Ae. albopictus, only two vector
parameters, 1) and 5), were found in the literature with temperature
dependent relationships: the mortality rate (μm) and the total biting
rate (a), which was taken as an inverse of the duration of gonotrophic
cycle (Delatte et al., 2009). The remaining three parameters, 2)–4), in
the VC were assumed to have the same temperature relation as those
for Ae. aegypti (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014). For Ae. Albopictus, the
human biting rate is assumed to be 0.88 of the total biting rate based
on the human and dogs experiment performed by Delatte et al.
(2010). The probability of transmission per bite to human is assumed
to be 0.7 of that for Ae. aegypti, based partially on the literature review
conducted by Lambrechts et al. (2010). Due to a lack of reliable data,
the female vector-to-human population ratio, m, is assumed to depend
on temperature the same way as the life expectancy or inverse of the
mortality rate, as used in a previous study (Brady et al., 2014). The max-
imum value of m (mmax) is assumed to be 1.5.
The threshold cut-off for DEP was defined as VC* = 0.2 (day−1).
Here we assume that an epidemic potential is realized when VC reaches
a level such that one infected person will infect at least one more person
after dengue is introduced into a naïve population during his/her five-
day infectious period (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014; Nishiura and
Halstead, 2007) (Supplementary information, Section S4). Sensitivity
analysis was performed for the effect of the range of the infectious peri-
od (4–10 days) (World Health Organization (WHO), 2012; Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2015; Chan and Johansson,
2012) on the dengue transmission windows (Supplementary informa-
tion Section S5.3, Fig. S5A for Ae. aegypti and Fig. S5B for Ae. albopictus).
This corresponds to a range of thresholds for DEP from 0.1 to 0.25
(day−1). We have chosen the threshold value of 0.2 (day−1), which is
closer to the higher end of this range, to be conservative in our results
presented.
To generate recent European season-stratified maps of VC (Jan. 1,
2006–Dec. 31, 2015), daily temperature observations (minimum, max-
imum, and mean) from the E-OBS 12.0 dataset were used for each loca-
tion gridded at 0.25 × 0.25° (about 25 × 25 km at the equator) latitude
and longitude (Haylock et al., 2008). This daily VC calculation included
interpolating DTR based on daily observations, then aggregated over
the decade by season (Winter: December–February; Spring: March–
May; Summer: June–August; Autumn: September–November). The
seasonal averaged VC for the recent decade were displayed as maps
for Europe for each season for both vectors and compared to a recent
survey of vector distribution (European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control (ECDC), 2015) for areas known to have Aedes activity
according.
To show seasonality of VC over a year, decade averages of VC for each
month was displayed as a function of the month in a year. For the recent
decade, 13 cities were chosen to compare seasonality of DEP. Ten
268

 European cities were selected to represent most of the European conti-
nent with different temperature zones from the north — Stockholm (lat-
itude = 59.3) to the south — Málaga (latitude = 36.7) within the
continent and Madeira (latitude = 32.7) outside the continent. Madeira
is an autonomous region of Portugal having a dengue outbreak in 2012,
and for convenience in this paper, we will use the name of city for all the
nine cities and Madeira region. Three reference cities from tropical and
sub-tropical regions outside Europe were chosen for comparison.
Colombo and Singapore are located in Asia close to the equator and dis-
play high dengue endemicity (Gubler, 2011; Gubler and Clark, 1995)
despite political and financial investment in dengue control. By contrast
Miami, located in North America with a sub-tropical climate with more
similarity in environmental and social economic conditions to some of
Southern Europe, has reported autochthonous dengue transmission oc-
casionally, which typically does not develop into large scale epidemics
(Theiler et al., 1960).
Diurnal temperature range is known to affect the competence of
dengue vector Aedes aegypti (Lambrechts et al., 2011). Inclusion of
DTR in modeling DEP for Ae. aegypti using relative VC (rVC) has shown
a great difference comparing without DTR (Liu-Helmersson et al.,
2014), especially in the cold to temperate climate zones in Northern
hemisphere. This is because rVC (VC) depends on DTR strongly, both
the peak intensity and the position. When DTR increases from 0 °C to
20 °C, the peak height of rVC reduced from 1.37 to 0.47 day−1; the
peak position of VC reduces from 29 °C to 20 °C. Therefore, in models in-
cluding DTR, temperate climate zones with larger DTR will have greater
DEP, while tropical areas with less DTR will have lesser DEP than esti-
mated by models using mean temperature alone. This is particularly rel-
evant to Europe, where DTR is greater than tropical areas.
From the Climate Research Unit (CRU) online database, time series
(CRU-TS 3.22) of gridded (0.5 × 0.5 degrees) monthly averages of
daily temperature observations (minimums, maximum, and mean)
were obtained for Europe for the period January 1, 1901 to December
31, 2013 (Jones et al., n.d.). Given the importance of DTR to temperate
European climate, in all the VC calculations, diurnal temperature range
(DTR) was included. DTR was reconstructed using a representative
daily temperature for each 30 min through a piece-wise sinusoidal func-
tion based on the monthly average of daily minimum, maximum, and
mean observations for each location (same temperature for each day
of the month in each 0.5 × 0.5 grid – See Supplementary information
S3 for details). To illustrate the combined effect of DTR and mean tem-
perature to VC, heat maps were generated for both Aedes vectors
(Fig. S2 (d) & (d) in the Supplementary information).
To show the seasonal window and its change over time, a 30-year
average was used for each monthly averaged VC at three periods – the
beginning of the 20th century (1901–1930), at the turn from 20th to
21st century (1984–2013), and the end of the 21st century (2070–
2099). Future VC was calculated using projected climate under four
greenhouse gas emission pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and
RCP8.5) (Weyant et al., 2009) based on CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2011;
Warszawski et al., 2014) atmosphere-ocean general circulation models.
For each emission pathway, CMIP5 temperature datasets (min, max,
mean resolution 0.5 × 0.5°) were used (Taylor et al., 2011;
Warszawski et al., 2014). The VC was calculated for each of the five glob-
al models (NorESM1-M, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, IPSL-CM5A-LR, HadGEM2-
ES and GFDL-ESM2M) and then averaged over the five models (Taylor
et al., 2011; Warszawski et al., 2014). We used these models as an en-
semble to form a multi-model mean, with the intention of providing re-
sults that are based on greater consensus. The four RCP scenarios
describe the possible range of radiative forcing of greenhouse gases in
the year 2100 (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5 W m−2, respectively)
(Weyant et al., 2009). VC calculations were aggregated by decade to
show the trends in DEP over two centuries. A selection of the outputs
of these projection-based VC calculations was also mapped for RCP2.6
and RCP8.5 for both species to show the changes in DEP across Europe
under scenarios of greater or lesser emission mitigation.
To calculate the intensity and duration of dengue transmission, a
seasonality curve was generated by plotting the decadally averaged VC
as a function of month for each of the 10 cities first and then for each de-
cade over the two centuries. The intensity of DEP was estimated by av-
eraging the VC over the highest three consecutive months in the
seasonality curve. The duration of transmission season was estimated
by the intersections of the seasonality curve with the line defining the
threshold condition (VC = 0.2 (day−1)). The differences between the
two intersections gave the number of months that VC was over the
threshold. This was repeated for each decade over the two centuries
and for each of the 10 European cities. Over the two centuries decadally
averaged VC were from year zero to nine for each decade except the two
decades with 9-year period: 1901–1909, 2011–2019 due to that both
CRU and CMIP5 data started from year one in the data set: 1901 and
2011.
Sensitivity analyses were carried out and the results were included
in the Supplementary Information, where section and figure numbers
were marked with “S”. Using Monte Carlo simulations, 95% Credible In-
tervals (CI) (Pericchi and Walley, 1991) of VC were estimated for tem-
peratures ranging from 10 °C to 32.5 °C. The variability in each of the
six vector parameters was simulated assuming a normal random distri-
bution. At each temperature under the random generation of parame-
ters, VC was calculated based on Eq. (1). Repeating this process 1000
times for each temperature, the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles of the
VC were estimated to give the values of VC ± 95% CI. Using the fitting
functions (VC ± 95% CI vs. temperature) as the basic equations and tem-
perature data as input, we estimated VC ± 95% CI for the ten cities over
two centuries, including DTR (Section S5.1–5.2, Figs. S3–S4 and Table S2
in Supplementary information). In addition, sensitivity of VC to thresh-
old values (VC*) and the maximum value of the female vector-to-
human population ratio (mmax) were also estimated based on Eq. (1).
We compared three values: VC* = 0.1, 0.2, 0.25 day−1 based on the in-
fectious period of 4 to 10 days. The results were expressed as dengue
transmission duration over the rest of this century for two RCPs
(Fig. S5). We varied mmax in three values: 1, 1.5, and 2, which was cho-
sen to reflect partially the range of pupae-to-human population ratio
(0.3 to 60) for Ae. aegypti (Focks et al., 2000). The results were expressed
as the seasonality curves (averaged VC vs. months) over the recent de-
cade for selected 13 cities (Fig. S6), and transmission intensity and du-
ration over the two centuries for two RCPs (Figs. S7–S8) in the
Supplementary information.

3. Results
3.1. Current Seasonality of Dengue Epidemic Potential in Europe and Trop-
ical/Subtropical Cities
Fig. 1 shows the season-stratified maps of Europe's DEP during the
recent decade (2006–2015) for Ae. aegypti (Fig. 1(i)) compared to Ae.
albopictus (Fig. 1(ii)) and current distribution of Ae. vectors either intro-
duced or established (Fig. 1(iii)) (European Centre for Disease Preven-
tion and Control (ECDC), 2015). Currently Europe is infested by Ae.
albopictus mainly in the Mediterranean area but expanding northward,
while only three areas have recently reported Ae. aegypti, Georgia and
southwestern portions of Russia, in addition to Madeira Island,
Portugal (not shown on map) (European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control (ECDC), 2015). The threshold value of 0.2 day−1 corre-
sponds to yellow color (see color bar). In areas with VC above this
threshold (yellow-orange to dark red) during a given time period, den-
gue outbreaks may commence assuming prerequisite populations of

 vectors, susceptible human hosts, and virus introduction coincide. Areas
during time periods displayed in blue to yellow green would not be ex-
pected to be suitable for dengue outbreaks to begin even if vectors were
present and importations of dengue virus were persistent. Strong sea-
sonality is apparent: VC was not sufficiently high in Europe in the
winter, spring, and autumn seasons to allow dengue epidemic transmis-
sion to commence using the threshold value of 0.2 day−1, except for
small areas in the very southern parts of Southern Europe during spring
and autumn. In the summer season, the majority of continental Europe
for Ae. aegypti and southern and partially central parts of Europe for Ae.

Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015; Wilder-Smith et al., 2014b). VC was calculated for each day of the period (Jan. 1, 2006–Dec. 30, 2015) and then seasonally aggregated over
the decade. Winter: December–February; Spring: March–May; Summer: June–August; Autumn: September–November. DTR was included and mmax = 1.5. E-OBS 12.0 daily gridded
(0.25 × 0.25°) temperature datasets were used (Haylock et al., 2008). The gray colored areas in this figure (iii) are those having unknown Aedes activity or for which survey information
was unavailable (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015). The threshold value of 0.2 day−1 is marked with an arrow on the yellow portion color bar.

included and mmax = 1.5 where m is the female vector to human population ratio. CRU-TS3.22 monthly gridded (0.5 × 0.5°) temperature data (Jones et al., n.d.) were used.

 albopictus have climate conditions and corresponding VC that could sus-
tain seasonal dengue epidemics. Therefore, if the primary vector, Ae.
aegypti, established in the other parts of Europe in the future, it could
have greater DEP than the established and invasive secondary vector,
Ae. albopictus.
We compared 10 cities in Europe with three reference cities in trop-
ical and sub-tropical regions. Fig. 2 shows VC averaged per month over
the recent 10 years for Ae. aegypti (a) and Ae. albopictus (b). General de-
creases in VC were observed comparing the temperate European cities
to the tropics, and the subtropics. Singapore and Colombo showed
high and nearly constant year-round VC. Miami showed a broad peak
from May to October, with VC values over the threshold (0.2 day−1)
year-round, indicating dengue epidemic transmission was theoretically
possible. All European cities showed a strong and narrow seasonal
transmission potential with overall lower VC values. Cities in Southern
Europe exhibited higher and broader peaks in VC than the rest of
Europe. Ae. aegypti showed higher VC than Ae. albopictus. Seven out of
the 10 European cities were over the threshold for at least one month
of the year for Ae. aegypti; only four cities were over the threshold for
Ae. albopictus. For both vectors, no single city in Europe had sufficiently
high VC to initiate endemic dengue transmission during the winter
months. Therefore, during the past decade a dengue epidemic was pos-
sible only during the warmer months of the year in all three Southern
European cities for both vectors and in some Central European cities
for Ae. aegypti based on the CRU temperature data as input. Notice
that this result based on monthly temperature is lower than the results
shown in Fig. 1 using daily temperature as input – see limitation of this
study in Discussion section and Section S1 in Supplementary informa-
tion for more discussion. The rest of the results were based on monthly
temperature.
3.2. Climate Change and the Dengue Epidemic Potential in Europe
Fig. 3 shows the season-stratified maps of Europe's DEP during the
last decade of the 21st century under greenhouse gas emission path-
ways RCP2.6 (i & iv) and RCP8.5 (ii & iii) for two Aedes vectors. DTR
was included and mmax = 1.5. Differences in VC for the four seasons
are clearly shown. DEP is almost zero during the winter, then growing
from small regions in the Southern Europe during the Spring, increasing
intensity and expanding geographically during Summer, before
contracting again in Fall. The differences in VC between the two climate
scenarios and two Aedes vectors are apparent in Fig. 3. Under the most
mitigation climate scenario (RCP2.6), during the Summer season, DEP
is limited to the Southern and the Central Europe for both vectors.
Under the business as usual climate scenario (RCP8.5), DEP extends
into Northern Europe for both Aedes vectors. Under both climate scenar-
ios, Ae. aegypti showed higher intensity in more areas than Ae.
albopictus. By the end of this century, the highest DEP region during
summer season would be in the Central Eastern parts of the Europe, in
addition to parts of the coastal areas of Southern Europe already having
high DEP in the recent decade as shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 4 shows the trend in seasonality over two centuries (1901–
2099) for the 10 European cities for Ae. aegypti (Fig. 4A) and for Ae.
albopictus (Fig. 4B). For each city, 30-year averaged VC was estimated
for three periods: Past (1901–1930) (i), Current (1984–2013) (ii), and
Future (2070–2099) (iii–vi). We used historical temperature data
from 1901 to 2013 and projected temperatures from 2011 to 2099
under five climate scenarios (CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2011; Warszawski
et al., 2014)) representing increasing emissions of greenhouse gases

Strong seasonality was observed in all cities over all periods and

 scenarios. Compared to the past, the current period shows an increase in
the magnitude and the width of the peak in VC in central to Northern
European cities (n = 7 including Madeira) while the Southern cities
(n = 3) remained about the same (the magnitude of the peak was
slightly reduced in Athens and increased in Rome).
The same trend was observed when comparing the future to the cur-
rent period under different emission pathways. The higher the RCP, the
higher the peak in VC for the Central to Northern seven cities including
Madeira and the wider the window of transmission for all 10 cities.
These observations hold for both Aedes vectors.

fined as the number of months when a decade's averaged VC was over
the transmission threshold value (0.2 day−1). Three months was used

(CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2011; Warszawski et al., 2014)).

 as the threshold in duration, reasoning that importation-driven epi-
demics of dengue would take several transmission generations to prop-
agate in human and vector populations before the first reported cases of
dengue are identified as was observed with Madeira in 2012 (Lourenço
and Recker, 2014; Wilder-Smith et al., 2014b) and Japan in 2014 (Quam
et al., 2016). Observed temperatures were used from 1901 to 2009.
From 2011 to 2099, two emission pathways were evaluated: RCP2.6
(i–ii) and RCP8.5 (iii–iv).
In general, increasing trends in intensity and duration for DEP were
observed in all cities. The intensity and duration markedly increased
from 1970 to 2019 under both RCPs and for both vectors, except for
the three Southern European cities: Malága, Athens and Rome, where

over the highest consecutive 3-months for each decade. Transmission window was defined as the number of months when the decade averaged VC was over the threshold value
(0.2 day−1). Historical temperatures (CRU-TS3.22 (Jones et al., n.d.)) were used from 1901 to 2009. From 2011 to 2099, two emission pathways (CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2011; Warszawski
et al., 2014)) were evaluated: RCP2.6 (i & ii) and RCP8.5 (iii & iv).
273

 intensity remained nearly constant due to decreasing sensitivity to
slight temperature changes around the peak temperature for VC, as
shown in Supplementary information (Section S4, Fig. S2(c)–(e)) and
previously described for relative VC (Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014).
From 2020 to the end of this century, this increase in intensity and du-
ration is projected to level off under RCP2.6, while continuing to in-
crease rapidly under RCP8.5 for both vectors, leading to very different
projected trends.
During the current decade (2011–2019) under both RCPs, for Ae.
aegypti the intensity threshold (0.2 day−1) will be surpassed in seven
cities (ni
a = 7) (Fig. 5A (i) & (iii)) and duration threshold (three
months) in four cities (nd
a = 4) (Fig. 5A (ii) & (iv)). For Ae. albopictus,
the intensity threshold will be surpassed for only four cities (ni
b = 4)
in (Fig. 5B (i) & (iii)) and the duration threshold for three cities (nd
b =
3) (Fig. 5B (ii) & (iv)). From 2020 to 2099, under RCP2.6 for Ae. aegypti,
the same results were observed for the intensity of (ni
a = 7) except two
cities with short periods of over the threshold (London: 2050s–2070s
and Amsterdam: 2060s–2070s); the number of cities with duration
over the threshold will be increased from four to five at 2020s and to
six starting 2040s to the end of this century (nd
a = 6). For Ae. albopictus,
the number of cities with intensity over the threshold will be increased
from four to five continuously (ni
b = 5) with one city (Berlin) over the
threshold for only short time (2060s); the number of cities with dura-
tion over threshold remains the same (nd
b = 3). However, under
RCP8.5, for Ae. aegypti all the 10 cities are projected to be over the
thresholds in both intensity and duration (ni
a = 10 by 2050s, nd
a = 10
by 2080s); for Ae. albopictus, all 10 cities in intensity and seven cities
in duration (ni
b = 10 by 2080s, nd
b = 7 by 2080s); this is a notable in-
crease in DEP over the projections for RCP2.6 for both dengue vectors.
Assuming a duration of three months over the threshold in VC (dot-
ted line in Fig. 5 (ii) & (iv)) is required for a dengue outbreak to occur
(Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014), then in the past century (1901–2009)
only Málaga, Athens and Rome had the potential for dengue outbreaks.
However, for Ae. aegypti, in the current decade 2011–2019, Nice shows
sufficient DEP under both RCPs. In the coming decades, under RCP2.6,
there is little increase from the current to the future – only five cities
(Málaga, Athens, Rome, Nice and Paris by 2020s) could have sufficient
DEP. If RCP8.5 were to be realized, Paris would have sufficient DEP
(2020s), followed by Madeira and Berlin (2030s), London (2060s),
Amsterdam (2070s), and Stockholm (2080s). Therefore, by the end of
this century, five cities under RCP2.6 and all 10 cities under RCP8.5
could have sufficient DEP – an increase of five cities from Central to
Northern Europe (including Madeira) between the RCPs.
For Ae. albopictus, under RCP2.6 there is no difference between the
future and past – only the Southern three cities, Málaga, Athens and
Rome, had the potential for dengue outbreaks. Under RCP8.5, Nice will
have sufficient DEP (2030s), followed by Paris (2060s), Berlin (2070s)
and Madeira (2080s). Therefore, the gap in dengue epidemic duration
between the two RCPs widens toward the end of this century - an in-
crease of four cities between the two RCPs.
4. Discussion
Comparing to tropical and subtropical countries, Europe showed
strong seasonality in DEP. No European city is projected to have year-
round dengue epidemic transmission; the longest period would be
eight months for Ae. aegypti and seven months for Ae. albopictus in Má-
laga by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5.
As temperature increases with time from 1970s onward, Central (es-
pecially Nice) and Northern Europe has shown great increase in trans-
mission intensity during summer while Southern Europe has shown
decrease (Fig. 4). This is due to the combined effect of mean tempera-
ture and DTR as shown in Fig. S2 (c)–(f) in the Supplementary
information.
Over time, the intensity and seasonal windows for DEP has increased
and is projected to continue increasing. As a result, more cities will be
over the VC threshold starting from the South and progressing to the
North during this century. However, the rate of the increase depends
on the emission pathway for both vectors, especially toward the middle
of the century. The same trend is observed even when using the lower
bound of VC (95% CI) for Ae. aegypti (see Supplementary information,
Section S6.2). This implies a significant potential benefit, if policies for
climate change mitigation are implemented such that future emissions
more closely reflect RCP2.6.
Over the two centuries, we have observed that the DEP in Athens,
Malága, and Rome are consistently over the threshold during part of
the year. Nice stands out as having the most dramatic rise; by the
2060, Nice would surpass the intensity of the three Southern
European cities; by the end of this century, during July–August Nice
would be near the current summer peak intensity in Miami. Consistent
with this, Nice was the site of the first reported autochthonous
European cases in 2010 (La Ruche et al., 2010) and Athens had a massive
dengue outbreak in 1927/28 (Theiler et al., 1960).
Since 1928, there has only been one dengue epidemic in Europe–
Madeira 2012 with over 2000 cases transmitted through Ae. aegypti
(European
Centre
for
Disease
Prevention
and
Control,
2012;
Wilder-Smith et al., 2014b). Using local weather station temperature
data for the current decade, VC for Madeira was well over the threshold
from June to October (Fig. S1 in Supplementary information). Therefore,
our findings are consistent with the large dengue outbreak that oc-
curred in 2012 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,
2012). The decline of new incident cases after November 9, 2012 was
most likely due to declining VC because of cooler temperatures com-
bined with enhanced vector control measures and public awareness.
While our findings contribute valuable insight into the timing of the
outbreak potential in Madeira, the introduction of vector predated the
outbreak by years, and the climate based DEP predated both for a num-
ber of months each year. This illustrates that commencement of an actu-
al dengue outbreak involves complex processes and more factors than
what we have addressed here. Of note is that VC for Athens, Rome and
Málaga is higher than that for Madeira even using local weather station
data (UK Meteorological Office, n.d.), yet no dengue outbreaks recently
occurred in those cities likely in part due to the absence of Ae. aegypti.
However, Ae. aegypti may be introduced or re-introduced at any time.
Our findings underpin the suitability of temperature dependent VC in
countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece that could result in autochtho-
nous dengue transmission should Ae. aegypti be imported and establish.
Indeed, when Ae. aegypti was present in Greece in the early 20th centu-
ry, a major dengue outbreak occurred in and around Athens in 1927–28
(Theiler et al., 1960). Furthermore, over 20 epidemics of yellow fever,
another flavivirus (like dengue) transmitted via Ae. aegypti, occurred
during the 18th and 19th centuries around British, Portuguese, and
Spanish harbors, with the last outbreak being in Barcelona, Spain in
1821 (Morillon et al., 2002). With climate change, recent studies
projected the re-establishment of Ae. aegypti in the coastal zones of
Europe in 2080 (Rogers, 2015; Kraemer et al., 2015).
Ae. albopictus is already widely spread in much of Southern Europe,
especially in the Mediterranean areas (Kraemer et al., 2015; Reiter,
2010). Comparing to VC of Ae. aegypti (Fig. 2(a)), Ae albopictus
(Fig. 2(b)) had similar seasonal windows but with lower intensity
such that only Southern European cities could currently have dengue
epidemics. The main reason for the absence of dengue outbreaks in
these cities could be one or all of the following factors: 1) Insufficient
adult vector populations that are actively biting humans for an extended
period to sustain a dengue outbreak (Ae. albopictus bites humans and
animals (Lambrechts et al., 2010; Delatte et al., 2010)); 2) Insufficient
infected humans with dengue for an extended period that could infect
sufficient number of vectors to sustain a dengue outbreak (infected
humans traveling back from dengue endemic areas are presumably iso-
lated indoors or may have recovered before they traveled home); 3) Ae.
albopictus is a less efficient vector for dengue transmission than what
we estimated. We may have overestimated the VC for Ae. albopictus
274
J. Liu-Helmersson et al. / EBioMedicine 7 (2016) 267–277
 due to limitations in temperature dependent data and studies
(Lambrechts et al., 2010).
However, Ae. albopictus was responsible for the epidemic transmis-
sion of chikungunya, an alphavirus, in Italy 2007 (Carrieri et al., 2011).
Therefore, it is unlikely that at that time factor 1) - insufficient Ae.
albopictus population - is the main reason for not having dengue out-
breaks in Europe, unless Ae. albopictus more effectively drives transmis-
sion of chikungunya (Paupy et al., 2009) than dengue such that the
current Ae. albopictus population are sufficient to drive chikungunya
but too few to trigger dengue outbreaks (Dubrulle et al., 2009).
Each year, certain European travelers return home with dengue (i.e.
1207 cases reported in 2012 reported in EU/EEA, 884 of which lived in
the EU countries currently having Aedes vectors (European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2014) and the number in-
creased over time (Quam et al., 2015; Semenza et al., 2014; Tatem
et al., 2006). If factor 2) is the main reason for preventing dengue out-
breaks in Europe to date, this suggests outbreaks could occur anytime
in the future when the infectious person/vector is in the suitable place
at a suitable time, as was the case for chikungunya in Italy in 2007. If fac-
tor 3) is true, then the main concern for Europe is the potential introduc-
tion and establishment of Ae. aegypti, consistent with earlier studies
(Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014; Lambrechts et al., 2010). Madeira like
Miami highlights the difference between DEP and actually having den-
gue epidemic transmission. This can be multifactorial. The temporal
and geographic range of DEP is likely to be spatially and temporally
broader than the actual areas of transmission events (over estimations).
On the other hand, Nice had local dengue transmission reported as early
as September 2010 (La Ruche et al., 2010), which may indicate that the
VC value was close to the threshold, and the Madeira and Japan out-
breaks declined as VC went below the threshold conditions (Quam
et al., 2016). When examining the DEP for Nice, our estimate of VC for
Ae. albopictus was very close to the threshold as expected: July and Au-
gust were over while September was under the threshold during the re-
cent decade as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Therefore, we cannot ignore the
dengue epidemic potential from Ae. albopictus in the Southern and Med-
iterranean areas of Europe as agreed by other studies (Lambrechts et al.,
2010; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),
2014; Bouzid et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2014; Whitehorn et al., 2015;
Benedict et al., 2007).
The time variable in this study was longitudinal – from 1901 to 2099
divided in 20 decades, in which for each decade monthly VC was esti-
mated. All the existing models on dengue risk mapping regardless the
model types – mathematical or statistical, give one or a few cross-
sectional estimations, such as, one year (Rogers, 2015; Rogers et al.,
2014; Patz et al., 1998) or a few decades' averaged snapshot (Bouzid
et al., 2014; Patz et al., 1998; Brady et al., 2014; Louis et al., 2014;
Naish et al., 2014). Although statistical models (Bouzid et al., 2014;
Rogers et al., 2014) were used to estimated climate change impacts on
dengue fever risk in Europe (more discussion in Supplementary infor-
mation, Section S7.1), very limited information (Patz et al., 1998) can
be found on seasonality in the current literature for European DEP or
dengue risk over an extended time period under all climate change sce-
narios. To our knowledge, this is the only study on the European DEP
communicating findings at the monthly time scale over two centuries
including historical observations and four climate projections into the
future. This information is important for dengue control planning and
may in turn underscore the need for emissions reductions, echoing
and supporting ratification of the Paris Agreement, a treaty on green-
house gas emission reductions formed at the 2015 Paris Climate Confer-
ence (World Climate, 2015).
The limitations of this study are mainly the assumptions made and
parameters/data used for estimating the DEP through VC. First, we as-
sumed that the female vector-to-human population ratio (m) depends
on temperature only. This is not exactly true in reality because vector
populations change with the season due to climate including rainfall,
vector ecology and control, etc. (Hii et al., 2012; Hales et al., 1996) The
reason for making this assumption is that neither reliable data nor
their temperature and rainfall dependent relationships are available.
In addition, rainfall is known to affect the under-water stages of vector
development (Yang, 2014; Tran et al., 2013). Once a vector population
is established and abundant, temperature is the main climatic driver
for dengue transmission and is included as the only climate variable in
other mathematical modeling studies as well (Patz et al., 1998; Brady
et al., 2014; Yang, 2014; Tran et al., 2013). To compensate for the as-
sumption made in our model, we performed sensitivity analysis of VC
to mmax – see Supplementary information (Section S6.4).
Second, the uncertainty in the vector and human parameters affect
the value of DEP through VC and the threshold value for intensity. All
six vector parameters depend on temperature. The female vector-to-
human population ratio depends on temperature the same way as lon-
gevity (Brady et al., 2014). The rest five of them with relationships ob-
tained
from
field
and
laboratory
experimental
studies
(Liu-
Helmersson et al., 2014). These relationships may vary depending on
the environmental conditions of the study location/laboratory/design,
vector and virus types. The uncertainty of each parameter and its tem-
perature dependent relation were not available. Thus, a Monte Carlo
simulation was used to estimate the uncertainty for each parameter
and their effect on VC, from which the seasonality for the 10 European
cities - see Supplementary information (Section S6.1–S6.2) for details.
In addition, although we chose the threshold value more conservatively
(0.2 day−1 within the range of 0.1–0.25 day−1 corresponding to infec-
tious period of 4 to 10 days), the estimated intensity and duration for
DEP should be viewed with caution. If different threshold values were
used, the general trend and order of cities that would go over the
threshold will hold, but the exact decade when the DEP goes over the
threshold could change. However, using the threshold of 0.2 day−1 in
the analysis of both the outbreak in Madeira in 2012 and the 2014 den-
gue outbreak in Japan, we found that this threshold corresponded spa-
tially and temporally with the novel transmission events (Quam et al.,
2016). See Supplementary information (Section S6.3) for more
discussion.
Third, for Ae. albopictus, only two parameters with temperature de-
pendent relations were available in the literature (Delatte et al., 2009).
The remaining parameters were assumed to have the same temperature
dependent relationships as Ae. aegypti, although they were adjusted to
the level of Ae. albopictus based on a literature review (Lambrechts
et al., 2010). This would limit the accuracy of the estimated value of
DEP for Ae. albopictus. See Supplementary information (Section S4) for
more discussion.
Finally, the temperature data used from CRU and CMIP5 are monthly
averages over gridded area of 0.5 × 0.5°. While the daily datasets from
E-OBS for the maps in Fig. 1 have finer resolution (0.25 × 0.25°, daily),
coarser resolutions (CRU and CMIP5) may underestimate DEP during
the summer and overestimate during the winter for cities located
along the costal lines. This accounts for the differences observed be-
tween Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 for major cities. Much of our analyses were
based on outputs from the coarser temperature data sets (CRU and
CMIP5). Therefore, the conclusions drawn are more conservative for
the summer and overestimates for the winter (Fig. 5 intensity). See Sup-
plementary Information (Sections S1 & S2) for more discussion.
5. Conclusion
We identified past, present, and future high-risk cities and time pe-
riods for potential dengue transmission in Europe based on temperature
and daily temperature variation. Compared to countries where dengue
is endemic, Europe showed strong seasonality in dengue epidemic po-
tential (DEP) without possibility of year-round epidemic transmission.
Compared over two centuries, we found a slow increase in intensity
and duration of dengue transmission over the past century and more
rapidly changing trajectories projected in the 21st century with the
rate of change depending on the level of greenhouse gas emissions.

 Although Europe currently does not have a sufficiently high DEP year
round, increasing periods with higher temperatures and greater tem-
perature variation in the future due to climate change could elevate
DEP along a south to north gradient. By the end of this century, DEP
for Ae. aegypti, could expand to Northern Europe (all 10 cities studied)
and up to eight months in Southern Europe under the highest emission
pathway (RCP 8.5). Under the lowest emission pathway (RCP 2.6), it
could expand to Nice and Paris for Ae. aegypti from the current three
Southern European cities. For Ae. albopictus DEP could expand to all of
the Central Europe (7 cities) under RCP 8.5; however, it would remain
nearly as it is now under RCP 2.6 (three Southern Europe cities). There-
fore, climate change mitigation (or lack thereof) could have a large im-
pact on the seasonal window and geographic range for dengue
transmission potential in Europe. Under the higher emission scenarios,
increasingly larger parts of Europe would have the potential for autoch-
thonous dengue transmission should Ae. aegypti be introduced and
established. Such concerns were substantiated by the dengue outbreak
in Madeira in 2012. The same concern extends to Ae. albopictus if higher
greenhouse gas emissions than RCP2.6 would be realized.
Increasing globalization in travel and trade will intensify the impor-
tation of dengue viruses and the potential for further introduction of Ae.
aegypti (Gubler and Clark, 1995). If such introductions coincide with
suitable vectorial capacity, those cities at the time intervals identified
in this study have potential for local dengue transmission. Dengue epi-
demic outbreak is a complex process involving many factors, with
mean temperature and diurnal temperature range just being two of
many. This study based on vectorial capacity helps to identify cities
and areas with high DEP and the seasonal time windows when such cit-
ies are at the highest risk currently and in the future under climate
change. Our findings illustrate that besides vector control, reducing
greenhouse gas emissions is very important in reducing DEP for
Europe especially toward the latter half of this century.
