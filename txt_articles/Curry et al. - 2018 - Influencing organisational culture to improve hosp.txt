AbstrAct
Background Hospital organisational culture affects 
patient outcomes including mortality rates for patients 
with acute myocardial infarction; however, little is 
known about whether and how culture can be positively 
influenced.
Methods This is a 2-year, mixed-methods interventional 
study in 10 US hospitals to foster improvements in 
five domains of organisational culture: (1) learning 
environment, (2) senior management support, (3) 
psychological safety, (4) commitment to the organisation 
and (5) time for improvement. Outcomes were change in 
culture, uptake of five strategies associated with lower 
risk-standardised mortality rates (RSMR) and RSMR. 
Measures included a validated survey at baseline and 
at 12 and 24 months (n=223; average response rate 
88%); in-depth interviews (n=393 interviews with 197 
staff); and RSMR data from the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services.
Results We observed significant changes (p<0.05) 
in culture between baseline and 24 months in the full 
sample, particularly in learning environment (p<0.001) 
and senior management support (p<0.001). Qualitative 
data indicated substantial shifts in these domains as 
well as psychological safety. Six of the 10 hospitals 
achieved substantial improvements in culture, and four 
made less progress. The use of evidence-based strategies 
also increased significantly (per hospital average of 2.4 
strategies at baseline to 3.9 strategies at 24 months; 
p<0.05). The six hospitals that demonstrated substantial 
shifts in culture also experienced significantly greater 
reductions in RSMR than the four hospitals that did not 
shift culture (reduced RSMR by 1.07 percentage points vs 
0.23 percentage points; p=0.03) between 2011–2014 
and 2012–2015.
Conclusions Investing in strategies to foster an 
organisational culture that supports high performance 
may help hospitals in their efforts to improve clinical 
outcomes.
Hospital organisational culture is associ-
ated with patient outcomes,1–4 including 
lower risk-standardised mortality rates 
(RSMRs) for patients with acute myocar-
dial infarction (AMI).5 6 Organisational 
culture encompasses the shared beliefs, 
values and patterns of behaviour that 
enable hospitals to survive in complex 
and changing environments.7 Inter-re-
lationships between the environment 
and a given organisation’s processes 
and practices are multifaceted, complex 
and bidirectional8; hence, the influence 
of culture may be difficult to measure 
precisely. There remains an ongoing 
debate regarding whether culture acts as a 
contextual factor, a moderator of organi-
sational practices or an independent vari-
able.9–11 In this study, we conceptualise 
organisational culture as a factor that can 
accelerate learning and improvement, and 
therefore impact the adoption of evidence-
based practices as well as have a potential 
direct impact on performance. Despite 
evidence on the link between organisa-
tional culture and patient outcomes, little 
is known about whether and how culture 
can be positively influenced in order to 
reduce AMI mortality.
Previous interventional studies have 
reported improvements in teamwork and 
coordination,1 12–15 but these interven-
tions have largely focused on subunits 
within 
hospitals, 
including 
surgical 
suites,13 15 emergency departments12 14 or 
intensive care units.1 Some studies have 
reported success in improving patient 
safety culture16–20; however, this research 
has not examined other aspects of 
culture linked to performance improve-
ment.21 Efforts such as the Robert Wood

Original research
Johnson Pursuing Perfection programme illuminated 
key elements of hospital culture change,22 but were 
not designed to evaluate a standard intervention to 
influence culture across sites and over time.23 A 2011 
Cochrane review24 noted that prior studies were 
limited by including single or few sites, lack of vali-
dated measures of organisational culture25 and limited 
longitudinal follow-up to assess impact.
We designed a 2-year intervention, Leadership 
Saves Lives (LSL),26 directed at fostering changes in 
hospital organisational culture that might contribute 
to reductions in RSMRs for patients with AMI. Our 
study addresses limitations of prior research24 through 
a longitudinal design in a diverse sample of hospitals, 
the use of robust quantitative and qualitative measures 
of culture, and the inclusion of an important clinical 
outcome.
Methods
Study design and sample
We employed a longitudinal, convergent mixed-
methods intervention design.27 Experts recommend 
mixed methods for the evaluation of complex inter-
ventions,28 where quantitative data assess impact and 
qualitative data provide critical insights into both 
context29 and processes of change.30 The intervention 
was not designed as a randomised controlled trial, as 
multifaceted contextual factors could not feasibly be 
controlled and are in fact the central phenomenon of 
interest in this study.28 30 31 We also tracked available 
RSMR data in non-intervention hospitals nationally 
over the study period. We partnered with the Mayo 
Clinic Care Network (MCCN), a national group 
of regional medical systems committed to quality 
improvement through collaboration, to identify a 
sample of hospitals seeking to improve performance on 
RSMR. From the 21 MCCN members (as of January 
2014), we identified those meeting eligibility criteria, 
including (1) at least 200 AMI discharges per year to 
ensure sufficient experience in caring for patients with 
AMI, (2) average or below-average national perfor-
mance on 30-day RSMR between 1 July 2009 and 30 
June 2012 as reported by the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Compare in Spring 
2014, suggesting opportunity for improvement, and 
(3) the largest hospital in the system, for hospitals in 
multihospital systems.
From the list of 18 hospitals that met eligibility 
criteria, we used random sampling with a purposive 
component32 to select hospitals that were diverse in 
geography and teaching status. We randomised the 
list using a random number generator and, working 
in sequence from the top, approached the first 10 
hospitals to determine receptivity, skipping those 
that duplicated prior selections in terms of geography 
or teaching status; one declined due to reorganisa-
tion, and one declined as a competing initiative was 
underway. We replaced these two hospitals with sites 
similar in geography and teaching status. This sample 
size was sufficient to observe substantial variation at 
the hospital level while allowing adequate resources to 
conduct the intervention.
The intervention
The intervention, previously described in detail,26 was 
implemented from 25 June 2014 to 24 June 2016. LSL 
was designed to foster improvements in five domains 
of hospital organisational culture relevant to hospital 
performance: (1) learning environment (ie, climate 
that promotes and rewards enquiry and experimenta-
tion),33 (2) psychological safety (ie, shared belief that 
it is safe to take risks interpersonally and to speak 
up without punishment),34 (3) senior management 
support (ie, fostering a shared purpose and vision for 
change, and empowering line leaders to enact that 
vision),35 (4) commitment to the organisation (ie, 
employees’ desire to stay based on their identification 
with and attachment to the organisation)36 and (5) 
time for improvement efforts (ie, space for planning, 
reflection and feedback).34 Each hospital appointed a 
guiding coalition of approximately 15 staff involved 
in care of patients with AMI, from multiple depart-
ments (eg, cardiology, emergency medicine, pharmacy, 
quality improvement) and levels of the organisation 
(eg, senior executives to front-line staff).
Guiding coalition members participated in three 
intervention components: a series of three annual 
forums attended by four members of each guiding 
coalition; a series of four 1-day, on-site workshops with 
the full coalition for each hospital; and a web-based 
platform for sharing experiences. The workshop 
curriculum (online supplementary appendix A) was 
grounded in a strategic problem-solving approach37 
in which coalitions sought to foster improvements in 
organisational culture as they implemented evidence-
based strategies,5 with the goal of identifying and 
addressing root causes of AMI mortality to reduce 
RSMR. To build a culture that supports creative 
problem solving, workshop content included expe-
riential learning sessions focused on promoting role 
clarity, working across professional and organisational 
boundaries, working in hierarchy, creating psycholog-
ical safety, developing accountability for shared goals 
and engaging in productive conflict.
Measures and data collection
We measured changes in three outcomes: domains 
of organisational culture, uptake of evidence-based 
strategies associated with lower RSMR, and RSMR 
for intervention hospitals and nationally. To quan-
tify changes in organisational culture, we employed a 
web-based, validated 31-item survey38 (online supple-
mentary appendix B), reflecting five subscales of 
domains of culture aggregated into an overall culture 
score. We surveyed guiding coalition members at base-
line (168 individuals), 12-month (186 individuals)

Original research
and 24-month (178 individuals) waves. Uptake of five 
evidence-based strategies associated with reducing 
RSMR for AMI (eg, creative problem solving, monthly 
meetings with EMS to review AMI cases, pharmacists 
rounding on all patients with AMI, physician and nurse 
champions for AMI care, and nurses dedicated to 
covering the cardiac catheterisation lab)6 was measured 
by report from a single respondent at each hospital at 
0, 12 and 24 months. To quantify uptake of strategies, 
we used binary survey items, completed by the hospital 
primary contact person, indicating whether or not the 
hospital had implemented each strategy. To examine 
trends in RSMR before and during the intervention, 
we obtained RSMR values for each participating 
hospital from CMS Hospital Compare. CMS reports 
3-year averages in RSMR; thus, we examined changes 
in hospital RSMRs between July 2011 and June 2014 
(the period immediately preceding the intervention) 
and July 2012 and June 2015, the most contemporary 
data available. We also examined RSMRs from the 
July 2010 to June 2013 period to understand subse-
quent changes in the context of longer trends.
We collected qualitative data using in-depth, 
in-person interviews32 at baseline and at 6 and 18 
months, with staff purposefully selected for diversity of 
roles from among the guiding coalition as well as other 
hospital executives, using a standardised interview 
guide (online supplementary appendix C). Interviews 
were approximately 45 
min in duration, were audio-
taped and professionally transcribed. We conducted 
ethnographic observations39 at baseline (n=40 
hours) 
and 18-month (n=16 
hours) visits using a standardised 
observation guide (online supplementary appendix D). 
Given the negligible risks for participation, the study 
was determined to be exempt from institutional review 
board review; all study participants provided their 
verbal informed consent to participate in this study.
Data analysis
We used standard frequency analysis to describe the 
samples of hospitals and survey respondents. We 
conducted descriptive analyses of quantitative data 
pertaining to organisational culture (overall and for 
five subscales) as well as uptake of evidence-based strat-
egies reported at baseline, 12 months and 24 months. 
To assess quantitative changes in organisational culture 
overall and each domain over time, we used hierar-
chical generalised linear modelling to estimate the 
association between mean culture scores (overall and 
culture subscales) and time, accounting for clustering 
of individual respondents within hospitals. Analyses 
were corroborated independently by two analysts and 
conducted using SAS V
.9.4.
To enhance the assessment of culture change with 
greater validity than possible with only quantitative 
instruments, we also used qualitative data,29 40anal-
ysed by a six-member multidisciplinary team using 
the constant comparison method of analysis.41 Each 
transcript was coded independently by at least three 
analysts, with discrepancies reconciled through negoti-
ated consensus. Iterative coding and analysis occurred 
across each wave of data collection, with refinement 
and review by the full team of six analysts, until a 
final code structure was established and reapplied 
to the full data set.42 The qualitative analyses were 
performed with all analysts blinded to the quantitative 
results across all three waves of analysis; unblinding 
to both survey results and RSMR occurred when data 
were merged for final classification as described below. 
Hospitals were classified into two groups: hospitals 
that experienced substantial culture change (n=6) and 
hospitals that did not (n=4) based on meeting either 
quantitative or qualitative criteria.43 The quantita-
tive criterion was a statistically significant change in 
the overall culture score between baseline and 2-year 
follow-up. The qualitative criterion was a marked shift 
in organisational culture, as reported by hospital staff 
through in-depth interviews from baseline to 2-year 
follow-up. Hospitals with a marked shift in culture 
were characterised by substantial, consistent, specific 
illustrations of notable changes in three to five of 
the domains of culture. In all hospitals classified as 
having a marked shift, there were no individuals who 
described lack of change or provided examples of 
persistent negative aspects of culture.
T
wo hospitals (IDs A and I) experienced statisti-
cally significant as well as marked qualitative shifts 
in culture, and four additional hospitals (IDs C, F, G 
and J) experienced marked qualitative shifts, although 
quantitative changes did not reach statistical signifi-
cance. The four remaining hospitals (IDs B, D, E and H) 
experienced neither statistically significant nor marked 
qualitative changes in culture. We used comparative 
analysis32 to characterise the differences between the 
six hospitals that achieved substantial culture change 
and those that did not, and we compared changes in 
mean RSMR among these two groups of hospitals 
using t-tests. Qualitative analyses were performed with 
 
ATLAS.

Research team and reflexivity
Our research team was diverse with regard to disci-
plinary background, training and expertise. Most, 
although not all members, have over a decade of 
experience in studying quality of cardiovascular care. 
We did not have relationships with participants prior 
to the study, and our motivations for conducting the 
research were described during the informed consent 
process.

30%; 500+, 50%) and AMI cases per year (200–399, 
50%; 400–599, 20%; 600–799, 30%). Participant 
roles are shown in table 1; survey response rates at 
baseline, 12-month and 24-month waves were 88% 
(147/168), 83% (154/186) and 94% (167/178), 
respectively, with 223 individual respondents (average 
response rate 88%). We conducted 393 in-depth inter-
views at baseline (n=162), 6 months (n=118) and 
18 months (n=113), with a total of 197 individual 
respondents.
Quantitative results
In the full sample of 10 hospitals, we found a statisti-
cally significant change (p<0.05) in the overall measure 
of organisational culture and processes between base-
line and 24 months (figure 1). The magnitude and 
depth of changes, however, varied substantially across 
hospitals. The use of evidence-based strategies also 
increased significantly over the 2-year study period 
(from a per-hospital average of 2.4 strategies at base-
line to 3.9 strategies at 24 months; p<0.05), with most 
changes occurring between baseline and 12 months 
(table 2). Between the 2011–2014 and 2012–2015 
reporting periods, the six hospitals that experienced 
substantial culture shifts showed significantly greater 
decreases in mean RSMR compared with changes in 
mean RSMR among the four hospitals that did not 
and compared with changes in mean RSMR nationally 
(figure 2 and see also online supplementary appendix 
E). Changes in hospital RSMRs prior to the LSL launch 
(2010–2013 to 2011–2014) did not differ significantly 
between the six hospitals that experienced substantial 
culture change and the four that did not, or between 
either group and the national average (p>0.05). 
Among the six hospitals that had substantial culture 
shifts, the RSMR decreased significantly from 2011–
2014 to 2012–2015 (mean difference 1.07, p value for 
paired t-test p=0.003), while among the four hospitals 
without substantial culture change the mean difference 
was not significant (mean difference for four hospitals 
was 0.23, p=0.40 for paired t-test).
Qualitative results
For the six hospitals that experienced substantial posi-
tive culture change, changes were most prominent 
in three domains of culture (learning environment, 
senior management support and psychological safety).

that it is safe to take risks and speak up without punishment.34 Changes 
in the remaining two domains (commitment to organisation and time for 
improvement efforts) did not differ significantly between the six hospitals

Original research
Differences between the six hospitals with positive 
culture change and the four hospitals without marked 
change are synthesised below; illustrative quotations 
appear in table 3.
Changes in learning environment
In the six hospitals that demonstrated positive shifts in 
culture, changes in the learning environment included 
increased use of data to drive change, greater creativity, 
enhanced problem-solving capacity and more frequent 
review of progress. Through working on the coalition, 
members became more reflective, which ultimately 
helped them develop a shared understanding of prob-
lems. One Director of Cardiovascular Quality noted 
that, through working on the coalition, members were 
eager to dig deeper for root causes: “We were able to 
pull away and think, ‘wait, there is opportunity here. 
How do we make a conscious effort to really push 
beyond just the surface level?’” (ID C_10). Participants 
grew increasingly open to new ideas, engaging front-
line staff and enhancing the coalition’s ability to solve 
problems creatively. Participants described overcoming 
habitual ways of thinking and finding novel approaches 
to persistent problems, as this Director of Emer-
gency Services reported a shift in their mindset over 
time: “We don’t need to keep doing things how we’ve 
always done them. We all know that’s the definition of 
insanity, doing the same thing and expecting different 
results. [LSL] has helped all of us realize that we need 
to be creative” (ID I_03). Coalitions demonstrated 
greater ownership of their data in both measuring 
progress and communicating data in credible ways 
to other clinicians. One Quality Director described 
how clinicians began to take an active interest in their 
performance data: “Within the last three 
months, all of 
the LSL data we’ve been collecting is now funneling 
into [cath lab committee]. That’s a really big change. 
The cardiologists have requested to be involved and to 
see more things now” (ID I_12).
In contrast, participants in the four hospitals without 
measurable culture change described persistent under-
valuing of quality data, limited capacity for creative 
problem solving, lack of shared responsibility for 
solving problems, and aversion to experimenta-
tion and risk-taking. One Chief Nurse for Quality 
reflected: “unfortunately, we are not…even remotely 
in a place where creative problem solving is acceptable. 
We’re pretty much given templates to work from. We do 
not see at all a whole lot of opportunity to creatively 
problem solve” (ID E_11).
Opportunities for creativity were constrained by 
deference to hierarchical relationships; non-physician 
staff yielded too readily to physicians and physicians 
showed limited respect for diverse expertise.
Changes in senior management support
In the six hospitals that experienced a positive shift in 
culture, increases in senior management support for 
improving AMI care were manifest in several ways: 
greater senior management engagement and visibility; 
increased responsiveness and support for improvement 
efforts; empowerment of middle managers and the 
front line; and higher levels of accountability. Partici-
pants noted that senior management were more acces-
sible than with prior improvement efforts, promptly 
allocating human and financial resources when needed. 
As one nurse manager remarked, “Because of adminis-
tration being on LSL, they saw the importance, so they 
allocated money…When you have the right people at 
the table…we got things done quicker” (ID A-17). As 
coalitions became more experienced, senior manage-
ment empowered both middle managers and front-
line staff to design and implement interventions. As 
a Director of Cardiac Services described his personal 
development through the project, “my ability to let 
[the managers] be independent and come back with 
a recommendation is different. That is new for me” 
(ID D_11). Staff also described increasing accounta-
bility, some of which was painful but also promoted 
progress. One participant reflected on a transforma-
tional moment when the Chief Executive Officer deliv-
ered a ‘Yogi Berra speech’ to the coalition for their lack 
of progress; staff recounted this act as highly motiva-
tional, galvanising their shared sense of responsibility 
for improvement.
In the four hospitals without measurable culture 
changes, senior management support was perceived 
as persistently low over the 2-year period. Partici-
pants described frustration with senior management 
expressing support for LSL yet failing to provide 
requested resources or to address persistent obstacles. 
Coalition members expressed concern over disengage-
ment, particularly of physicians, such as this Director 
of a Heart and Vascular Center:

substantial culture change compared with the mean change in RSMR for 
the four hospitals without such culture change (p=0.03) and for hospitals 
nationally (p=0.005). Source: Data from Centers for Medicare and

Data to drive change. “We participate in all these registries…[LSL] has really opened my eyes to make 
some hypotheses [about] what we need to look at as a group to improve patient care…to utilize that 
data to drive change.” (ID F_18; RN Chest Pain Center)
Search for root causes. “Now everyone is focusing on the whys. It is not just because I said so… 
You trust more to depend on the next person than you may have in the past… It is just alot more 
comfortable.” (ID G_10; CathLab CV Technician)
Greater creativity. “We have some very creative people, but there hadn’t been a lot of permission to…
think out of the box…and to realize that some of the best ideas came from a respiratory technician. 
As that openness developed, some of those great ideas were really valued.” (ID I_02; CMO)
Shared responsibility for problem solving. “[Previously], quality efforts such as Plan-Do-Study-Act 
were…not really institutionalized. It was like, ‘Okay, whatever.’ [Now] we have created a really good 
safe, open environment to work on creative problem solving, where everybody has an equal voice.” 
(ID A_12; Chief Executive)
Data not valued. “We had to convince our physician leaders, and it was a struggle. We 
had to put the data in front of them, and we had to show them, ‘Look, this patient had 
a bad outcome because nobody could reach the right person.’ Even still, it still was like, 
‘Well, that was a one-off.’” (ID H_07; Chief Nurse for Quality)
Lack of creativity. “We struggle with creative problem solving. We’re so squarely in the 
box that we can’t even see the edge…it’s part of the culture. People are afraid to take 
risks, for whatever reason.” (ID B_05; Supervisor of Pharmacy)
Lack of shared responsibility for problem solving. “There’s a lot of people that want 
to bring the problems forward; however, they don’t want to problem solve. They [say], 
‘Here you go. Here’s the problem that I see. Now fix it.’” (ID E_04; Quality Analyst)
Senior management
Engagement and visibility. “Every meeting that I’ve been to, there has always been senior 
management at the meeting. They have been very, very supportive and whatever [the coalition] 
wanted, if the hospital can do it, they have done it…I was just shocked to see especially upper 
management. You just don’t see that.” (ID C_19; Paramedic)
Responsiveness and support. “I could stop and ask X something and she gets right back with me. It’s 
not, ‘I’ll have my assistant call you.’ I like the respect shown towards me. I mean, that was unheard of 
[before].” (ID A_01; Paramedic)
Empowerment of middle managers. “LSL has helped me to be…more vocal about patient care and 
processes within cardiology…that maybe aren’t working. The biggest change for me is being that go-
between between management and the rest of the mid-levels…and finding the solution between the 
two…management is usually very supportive.” (ID F_03; Physician Assistant)
Higher levels of accountability. “Now it seems they’re better prepared to present information and 
discuss during the meeting. Then it seems like there’s ownership taken, and responsibility is given to 
people to pursue and follow up on what the committee decides.” (ID I_01; Interventional Cardiologist)
Lack of engagement and visibility. “Even though the people at the highest level are 
involved in LSL…it is not heard straight from the top…that this is a priority. There is 
always one more barrier.” (ID H_06)
Lack of responsiveness and support. “We pointed out to some of the VPs…we need 
these [positions]. The response [was]: ‘there aren’t resources for that now…we will 
continue to evaluate and decide…’ it speaks for itself when over a year later we still 
don’t have anybody in these roles.” (ID B_15; Cardiologist)
Lack of empowerment. “We get a lot of promises, but things don’t happen…it is very 
difficult to get approval for a lot of the things we [need].” (ID B_01; Medical Director, 
Cardiology Administration)

Domain of culture
Hospitals with substantial positive culture change
Hospitals without substantial culture change
Psychological safety
Freedom to voice concerns. “I’ve seen a fair amount of growth as a group…people challenge 
each other. Somebody will make a statement. Somebody else will say, I don’t totally agree…it has 
been important for people to…challenge some of the things that even the docs say.” (ID J_18; 
Cardiovascular Administrative Director)
Greater respect across disciplines. “In the beginning there were…individuals who were more forceful 
in their opinions…The group has evolved…LSL was the first opportunity to show we all have stuff 
to offer and we know what we are talking about…it was slow but that change is there.” (ID J_12; 
Pharmacist)
Shared ownership. “It has changed a lot. At first we were kind of timid…we were a little bit silo-
ed…as we went through [LSL] we transitioned into, ‘what can I do to fix my part?’…It transitioned 
from everyone telling everyone else what to do to looking at themselves and saying, ‘this is what 
we are going do to make this work.’ I think that that was really a turning point.” (ID C_8; Director, 
Emergency, Trauma and Critical Care)
Supportive relationships. “Getting to know the group and what we were all about initially, it was a 
little bit harder to say anything. Now…I won’t be afraid to speak up. I know the core members…
feel the same way. We could all speak up, and we would have each other’s back, and not be afraid to 
defend what we’ve done.” (ID F_17; Pharmacist CVU)
Transparency. “Over the last year we have been moving the bar to a more transparent, open 
conversation-type culture…to have more input from all of the team players.” (ID G_05; Administrator)
Managing hierarchy. “We have all been together in the same room [working] not as doctor-to-
pharmacist, but on the same team…that’s a different perspective. You get used to dealing with people 
not in a power role, but more of an equal role, no matter what position you are.” (ID F_1; Chair of 
Cardiology)
Complementarity. “Our physician champion, has been much more willing to say, ‘I don’t know,’ and 
rely on other people, which is something that I don’t think he necessarily did a while back. I don’t 
think he was afraid to speak up, but I think it’s hard for docs to say they don’t know something, 
because everybody expects them to know everything.” (ID J_07; Quality Improvement Associate)
Lack of freedom to voice concerns. “There are some [staff] that maybe feel ‘I can’t 
speak up just yet, or maybe if I tell A, it’s okay, but I can’t really tell B because I might 
get in trouble for it.’ I still see a little bit of that.” (ID B_06; Heart Center Manager)
Deference to authority. “There is still this deference to authority…we tend to put our 
physicians up there…‘our physician said it should be, so it should be.’” (ID H_07; 
Director of Quality)
Lack of shared ownership. “Meetings were a little intimidating at times. I’d be sitting 
there and they’d be like, ‘Well, it’d be great if Pharmacy could do this.’ I’m like, ‘Is there 
no one else around here who can do an intervention? Why is it all falling on me?’ It got 
a little dicey at times.” (ID D_07; Pharmacist)
Lack of supportive relationships. “I wish that our group would have created that 
personal relationship, because once you have that, people can be a little bit more 
vulnerable…we’re pretty stiff and regimented…sometimes comments are filtered as 
opposed to unfiltered.” (ID H_13; Senior Executive)

"One of the biggest changes that I’ve seen with this 
coalition is the willingness to stick with it…If we 
lose our physician representative, we’re going to get 
someone new in that has no idea of the history. We 
need good leadership to stay dedicated to what we 
started, and that’s something that I worry about" (ID 
E_12).
The sporadic presence or complete absence of senior 
management at meetings made it difficult for coalition 
members to remain engaged and believing that the 
initiative was a priority for the organisation. As one 
Director of Organizational Quality reflected, “We have 
not had strong executive ownership in this project at 
all…that really changes the dynamics and the purpose 
of why we’re there” (ID E_11).
Changes in psychological safety
Although not statistically significant in the quantitative 
data, changes in psychological safety in the six hospi-
tals with positive shifts were strongly apparent in the 
qualitative data and palpable to staff, who described 
increased freedom to voice concerns, greater respect 
across disciplines and departments, and greater appre-
ciation for diverse expertise that supported productive 
collaboration. Coalition members reported devel-
oping higher confidence to express divergent views, 
particularly those that challenged powerful roles 
in the hospital. Physicians and non-physicians alike 
commented on the levelling effect of working together 
in the coalition, with more equitable participation and 
engagement among members, who grew more unified 
as a team. In one hospital, the coalition set a new tone 
for risk-taking and working on the ‘leading edge’, 
even if some ideas were not successful. One partici-
pant highlighted a transformation in their hospital, in 
which staff had traditionally avoided confrontation: 
“Sometimes we’re just so nice we won’t talk about the 
hard things. So what I have seen lately is we’re still very 
nice but we’re becoming a little more up front in our 
communication. That to me has been super exciting to 
see” (ID I_14).
In contrast, participants in the four hospitals 
without measurable culture change described how 
their improvement efforts stagnated despite partic-
ipation in LSL. Participants reported difficulties in 
fostering trust in others, and the ability to speak freely 
was not widely shared. As one cardiologist observed, 
“We are very open among cardiology leadership. Now, 
you could say, at the staff level, not so much. I think 
there are some opportunities there” (ID H_7). Decision 
making was described as opaque and staff reported 
“walking on egg shells” as they tried to implement 
changes. In these hospitals, staff remained focused on 
their own individual or departmental interests, rather 
than collaborating to solve problems. One cardiolo-
gist reflected on his experience of coalition meetings 
as pro forma, where reports of progress on improve-
ment projects might be influenced by the dynamics 
between managers and their bosses: “There’s a lot 
of middle managers that are covering their butts…It 
doesn’t necessarily mean a problem has been solved” 
(ID B_15). Coalitions in these hospitals faced chal-
lenges in communication and information sharing that 
constrained the team’s ability to function effectively. 
One coalition member described difficult dynamics in 
the team that persisted until another member “took 
the risk of being vulnerable” to raise the issue. He 
observed that “in this work environment…sometimes 
comments are filtered” (ID H_13).
discussion
In this intervention designed to promote positive 
change in organisational culture, we observed substan-
tial shifts in culture, driven largely by an improved 
learning environment, increased senior management 
support and increased psychological safety, through a 
team-based model of clinical leadership. This finding 
is consistent with prior research demonstrating the 
importance of engaging physicians and non-physi-
cians, as well as senior leaders and middle managers, 
in a learning environment16 44; our study further 
documented significant changes in RSMR, a mean-
ingful clinical outcome.45 Hospitals that experienced 
substantial culture shifts also achieved significantly 
greater reductions in RSMR than those that did not 
experience such culture shifts or than hospitals nation-
ally.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective 
interventional study to demonstrate improvements 
in organisational culture and reductions in RSMR 
for patients with AMI. The longitudinal data indi-
cate that RSMR was decreasing before LSL both in 
hospitals with substantial culture change and in those 
without substantial change; this trend of decreasing 
RSMR was maintained during LSL in the six hospi-
tals with substantial culture change, whereas progress 
plateaued in the four hospitals that did not experience 
marked culture change, as it did nationally. Moreover, 
although the quantitative magnitude of changes in 
culture was relatively modest, the qualitative expe-
riences were compelling, a finding we attribute in 
part to the difficulty of quantitative measurement of 
nuanced concepts such as culture.24 25 46 47 Experts 
have cautioned that although culture is important to 
hospital performance, change can be very difficult and 
take up to a decade.22 46 Our findings suggest that, 
despite these concerns, organisational culture can be 
modified through development and support of a multi-
disciplinary leadership group that establishes a shared 
goal with senior management and uses data effectively 
to drive change, ways of working that experts have 
identified as essential for improvement.48 49
Staff in hospitals that experienced substantial culture 
change described plans to ‘transfer LSL’ to other 
improvement efforts (eg, heart failure readmissions 
and population health). This intention for replication

suggested that changes were related to norms of work 
and culture, rather than more superficial, technical 
improvements in AMI care. Researchers have lamented 
the difficulty of measuring nuanced concepts such as 
culture quantitatively24 25 46 47; however, we were able 
to detect gradations in culture and to produce insights 
about the differential effects of the intervention, thus 
highlighting the benefits of applying mixed methods 
to studies of organisational change and clinical perfor-
mance.30 40
Our findings should be interpreted in light of several 
limitations. First, the lack of randomisation or compar-
ison group limits our ability to make conclusions about 
causality. Nevertheless, a randomised controlled trial 
would have limited the depth and breadth of contex-
tual factors; failure to include context as a key vari-
able in implementation efforts is a notable limitation 
of research to date.21 24 28 50 Our longitudinal, conver-
gent mixed-methods intervention design was well-
suited for studying complex change processes30 51 in 
a set of diverse hospitals. Second, participants may 
have had a vested interest in representing the inter-
vention as a success; to minimise social desirability 
bias, we interviewed multiple staff in each hospital, 
elicited details that would be difficult to misrepresent, 
encouraged respondents to share both positive and 
negative experiences, and triangulated across multiple 
data sources.40 52 Third, RSMR is reported by CMS 
in 3-year blocks, so we could not measure annual 
changes precisely; nevertheless, we were able to detect 
significant differences between hospitals in changes in 
RSMR. Last, measurement of both culture and RSMR 
was limited to within the intervention period; although 
we detected significant changes in culture and RSMR, 
longer follow-up would provide greater understanding 
about how the intervention effects change over time. 
In addition, the increment of quantitative change in 
culture was modest; because this is a newly validated 
instrument,38 we are unable to interpret the magni-
tude of change relative to other studies. Nevertheless, 
a strength of mixed-methods designs is the comple-
mentary qualitative data; the combination of statisti-
cally significant changes in the quantitative measure 
coupled with strong qualitative evidence together indi-
cates substantive changes in culture. We would expect, 
however, that larger culture changes would take place 
over a longer follow-up period, given that culture 
emerges through shared experience and over time.46
We found that the LSL intervention was effective 
for 6 out of 10 hospitals in fostering positive shifts in 
hospital organisational culture. Furthermore, hospitals 
with marked improvements in culture experienced a 
significantly greater decrease in RSMR than those that 
did not improve culture. Our study addresses a critical 
gap in the performance improvement literature, which 
has highlighted the importance of hospital culture for 
clinical outcomes but has not demonstrated whether 
or how hospital culture can be influenced to improve 
clinical outcomes. Findings may be useful to clinicians 
and hospital leadership seeking to promote improve-
ments in care and outcomes for patients with AMI.
