Mechanical sensitivity is commonly affected in chronic
pain and other neurological disorders. To discover
mechanisms
of
individual
differences
in
punctate
mechanosensation,
we
performed
quantitative
trait
locus (QTL) mapping of the response to von Frey
monofilament stimulation in BXD recombinant inbred
(BXD) mice. Significant loci were detected on mouse
chromosome (Chr) 5 and 15, indicating the location of
underlying polymorphisms that cause heritable varia-
tion in von Frey response. Convergent evidence from
public gene expression data implicates candidate genes
within the loci: von Frey thresholds were strongly cor-
related with baseline expression of Cacna2d1, Ift27
and Csnk1e in multiple brain regions of BXD strains.
Systemic gabapentin and PF-670462, which target the
protein products of Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e, respec-
tively, significantly increased von Frey thresholds in a
genotype-dependent manner in progenitors and BXD
strains. Real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed
differential expression of Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e in multi-
ple brain regions in progenitors and showed differential
expression of Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e in the dorsal root
ganglia of the progenitors and BXD strains grouped
by QTL genotype. Thus, linkage mapping, transcript
covariance and pharmacological testing suggest that
genetic variation affecting Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e may
contribute to individual differences in von Frey filament
response. This study implicates Cacna2d1 and Ift27 in
basal mechanosensation in line with their previously
suspected role in mechanical hypersensitivity. Csnk1e
is implicated for von Frey response for the first time.
Further investigation is warranted to identify the spe-
cific polymorphisms involved and assess the relevance
of these findings to clinical conditions of disturbed
mechanosensation.

Mechanosensation is a fundamental sensory trait that is
often affected in patients with neurological disorders includ-
ing chronic pain of inflammatory or neuropathic origin (Baron
2000). As such, understanding the molecular mechanisms
underlying mechanosensation may have clinical importance
and utility. Punctate mechanical sensitivity, hypersensitiv-
ity and painful hypersensitivity (allodynia) are commonly
assessed in the clinic and in animal models of chronic pain
with application of nylon von Frey monofilaments or other
similar instruments to the skin within affected regions (Baron
2000). Mechanosensitivity in the von Frey test is highly vari-
able and heritable, with 69% of the variability in sensitivity of
standard inbred mouse strains explained by genetic factors
(Lariviere et al. 2001, 2002; Mogil 1999; Mogil et al. 1999a).
Similarly, nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity is
also highly variable and heritable (Mogil et al. 1999a) and
moderately genetically correlated with baseline mechanosen-
sation in standard inbred mouse strains (Mogil et al. 1999b).
Mechanosensitive receptors, ion channels and afferent fibers
have been identified (Shin et al. 2003), but the genetic and
molecular mechanisms underlying individual differences in
mechanosensation have yet to be identified. Thus, the iden-
tification of polymorphic genes with functional effects on
mechanosensation could provide new opportunities for the
treatment of pain that involves altered mechanosensation.

 Loci and candidate genes for mechanosensation
(Lacroix-Fralish & Mogil 2009). The GRPs such as recom-
binant inbred (RI) mice enable the simultaneous detection
of genetic susceptibility loci, through quantitative trait locus
(QTL) mapping of behavior, and correlated gene expression
variation in tissues that may play a role in individual differ-
ences in complex traits (Chesler et al. 2003b). This study
employs BXD RI mice to perform genome-wide QTL map-
ping, genetic correlation analysis with other behavioral and
neurobiological traits, expression QTL and trait-transcript cor-
relation analysis to identify genomic loci and candidate genes
underlying individual differences in von Frey mechanosen-
sitivity. Genomic regions containing candidate genes were
significantly linked to mechanical sensitivity in the von Frey
test, and convergent transcript covariance evidence was
obtained for a subset of the candidate genes. Expression
assays and pharmacological testing was performed to assess
the role of compelling candidate genes.
Materials and methods
Experimental subjects
For QTL mapping and genetic correlation analysis, adult male mice of
26 BXD RI strains were tested for mechanical thresholds in the von
Frey test (N = 204; n = 6–9/strain). The BXD RI strains were all ‘
/TyJ’
substrains obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME,
USA). The BXD RI strains have been created by crossing the standard
inbred strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J and re-inbreeding the F2 hybrid
offspring (Taylor 1978) and have been maintained inbred since their
creation.
Mice acclimated to the animal facilities for a minimum of 5 days
before testing. Each procedure was approved by the Institutional Ani-
mal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) where it was performed. The
testing of the BXD RI strains in the initial mapping study was per-
formed at University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston, pharmaco-
logical testing and tissue dissection from BXD strains was performed
at The Jackson Laboratory, gene expression quantitative PCR was
performed at University of Pittsburgh and pharmacological testing of
congenic strains was conducted at University of Chicago. All exper-
iments adhered to the guidelines of the Committee for Research
and Ethical Issues of the International Association for the Study of
Pain (Zimmermann 1983) and of the National Institutes of Health of
the USA.
Assessment of mechanical sensitivity using von Frey
withdrawal threshold testing
Mice were placed in transparent acrylic compartments (4 × 4 × 7 cm3)
on a metal mesh floor for 20–30 min prior to testing. Mechanical
sensitivity was measured on the plantar surface of the hind paws of
habituated mice by application of von Frey-type monofilaments with
bending forces of 0.03, 0.07
, 0.16, 0.41, 1.00, 2.24, 5.50 g (Stoelting,
Wood Dale, IL, USA) for 1–2 seconds with an inter-trial interval of
10 seconds. The up-down method (Chaplan et al. 1994) was used to
determine the bending force to evoke paw withdrawal 50% of the
time. One paw was completely tested prior to testing the other paw.
The baseline thresholds for each hind paw were determined on 3
separate days. Because no effect of paw side or repeated testing
was observed (see Results), the average of values for both paws
and 3 days of testing were calculated and used for QTL mapping and
genetic correlation analyses.
Heritability and QTL mapping
The effect of BXD RI mouse strain on mean von Frey withdrawal
threshold was determined by repeated-measures analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with test day as the repeated measure, and by one-way
ANOVA of the 3-day averaged thresholds. Heritability was estimated
by h2 = V A/(V A + V E), where V A is the additive genetic variation esti-
mated by the between-strain variance and V E is the environmen-
tal variance estimated by the within-strain variance from the ANOVA
results (Falconer & Mackay 1996). Note that the additive genetic vari-
ance, when estimated using isogenic lines, also contains gene × gene
and gene × environment interactions, and that environmental vari-
ance is confounded with other technical variation. While this estimate
does not directly estimate the transmission of phenotypic values from
parent to offspring, it provides an estimate of the resemblance among
isogenic relatives.
To determine the location of genomic loci linked to variabil-
ity in mechanosensation, whole-genome single locus QTL map-
ping using the BXD RI strain phenotypic means was performed in
GeneNetwork.org, where the data have been deposited (GeneNet-
work Record ID 11296). Regions of the genome containing polymor-
phisms associated with mechanical sensitivity were determined by
Haley–Knott marker-trait regression analysis using the QTL detec-
tion software integrated with the GeneNetwork/WebQTL website
(www.genenetwork.org; www.webqtl.org) (Wang et al. 2003) to con-
struct an interval map. A total of 3795 non-redundant DNA mark-
ers polymorphic between the progenitor strains and among BXD RI
strains and at loci throughout the genome were considered (June
2005 version; http://www.genenetwork.org/dbdoc/BXDGeno.html).
The threshold logarithm of the odds (LOD) score for a significant QTL
was determined using an empirical P-value from 1000 permutations
of the strain means with a genome-wide error rate 𝛼 = 0.05 (Churchill
& Doerge 1994).
Genetic correlation analyses with traits
and transcript levels
Because of the inbred status of the RI strains, their unchanging geno-
types are allowing von Frey threshold means to be directly com-
pared, using genetic correlation analysis, with all other traits obtained
since the inception of the BXD RI lines, including expression of
genes and many behaviors. Strong significant correlations among
phenotypic values from large inbred strain panels indicate shared
genetic regulatory mechanisms between the traits and correlations
close to zero indicate genetic distinctiveness of the traits (Crabbe
et al. 1990). To assess the genetic relatedness of mechanosensation
to other traits, Pearson correlation coefficients (rp) were calculated
between BXD RI von Frey threshold strain means and strain means
of >4600 other complex traits available on the GeneNetwork web-
site (http://www.genenetwork.org/dbdoc/BXDPublish.html) (Chesler
et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2003). All phenotypic correlations were
exported from GeneNetwork, and P-values were imported into the
R/qvalue package (R Core Team 2013) for pointwise estimation of the
false discovery rate for each result (Storey & Tibshirani 2003).
The QTL positional candidates were evaluated to identify polymor-
phic genes within the QTL region, and co-expressed genes within
the region. Tissue-specific mRNA transcript levels provide the tran-
scriptional context in which sensitivity to a stimulus is determined
(McClearn 2006). Transcript covariance analysis was used to empiri-
cally reduce the list of positional candidate genes from QTL mapping
by comparing von Frey mechanical threshold strain means of the BXD
RI mice with mRNA expression in nine brain areas and the adrenal
glands for which transcript expression profiles are available for numer-
ous BXD RI strains (Chesler & Williams 2004; Chesler et al. 2003b,
2005; Peirce et al. 2003) (see Table S1, Supporting Information, for
description of microarray datasets). Pearson product–moment cor-
relations were calculated between von Frey thresholds and tran-
script expression in publicly available Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA,
USA), Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) or Agilent (Santa Clara, CA,
USA) whole mouse genome mRNA microarray data for the adrenal
gland, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pituitary, whole neo-
cortex, whole midbrain, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and
the striatum, from up to 24 of the BXD RI strains. The data sets
and complete methodological details for each study are available
on the GeneNetwork website. Several of these publicly available
data sets contain unbalanced combined samples from both gen-
ders, although more recent samples contain gender-balanced or
gender-specific data. These data are part of a greater repository of

BXD phenotypic data and cannot readily be broken out by gender.
Where possible we selected male-specific data to complement our
male-specific von Frey data set – in the midbrain, pituitary, amygdala,
hypothalamus and adrenals. Gender differences and gender-specific
genetic mechanisms will be missed in this analysis. Correlations were
retrieved from GeneNetwork using the most recent version of the
gene expression data for each tissue. The calculations were per-
formed using each of the normalization methods reported (Microarray
Suite 5 [MAS5], Position-Dependent Nearest Neighbor [PDNN] or
Robust Multi-array Average [RMA]) to protect against potentially spu-
rious findings related to specific normalizations. The maximum num-
ber of transcript probes assessed for a single brain region is over
45 000, which renders the critical P = 1.1 × 10−6 with Bonferroni cor-
rection. This comparison-wise type I error rate comes with a sub-
stantial rate of false negative results. Thus, a moderately conserva-
tive critical P = 0.001 was chosen based on previous whole-genome
transcript expression studies of sensory traits (Costigan et al. 2002;
Griffin et al. 2007). Each thresholded set of correlates was exported
from GeneNetwork directly to GeneWeaver (Baker et al. 2012), a
tool that facilitates comparison of gene set data across heteroge-
neous species and experimental platforms. Using the Boolean tool in
GeneWeaver, the union of gene expression correlates with P < 0.001
observed for each normalization was obtained within tissue to con-
struct a single gene list per tissue. The GeneSet Graph tool was then
applied to the resulting gene lists to visualize the frequently corre-
lated genes among all tissues. The resulting transcripts are those
under multi-tissue regulation by allelic variation within the QTL region.
The strategy may omit transcripts that vary specifically in functionally
relevant tissue, and will also exclude those genes for which polymor-
phisms will alter function but not abundance. For those genes and
mechanisms identified, functional validation is required.
Candidate gene testing
The roles of the candidate genes were tested in the two progenitor
strains of the BXD RI mice as well as selected BXD strains to
determine if targeting the protein product of the gene affects von
Frey withdrawal thresholds, a critical step in establishing that the
genes are possible candidates for mechanosensation. Candidate
gene pharmacological testing was performed in male progenitor
strains and a subset of the BXD strains (The Jackson Laboratory). The
BXD strains were chosen based on single nucleotide polymorphism
genotypes at the peak of each of the detected QTL such that strains
with the high and low predicted von Frey sensitivity were used for
validation testing, though they were not necessarily the strains with
the most extreme observed phenotypes in the mapping population
(Fig. 1). The allelic effects at the two loci were in opposite directions,
so half of the strains had C57BL/6J genotype and the other half
the DBA/2J genotype at the QTL peak on Chr 5 (rs29681564) with
the opposite on Chr 15 (rs3665030). The low sensitivity strains
were BXD1, BXD6, BXD12, BXD19 (Chr 5 rs29681564 = D2/Chr 15
rs3665030 = B6) and the high sensitivity strains were BXD15, BXD18,
BXD21 (Chr 5 rs29681564 = B6/Chr 15 rs3665030 = D2).
These strains were evaluated to assess whether allele status
determines the relative effectiveness of targeted pharmacological
manipulations to alter von Frey withdrawal thresholds. The method
of von Frey mechanical sensitivity testing was as described above;
however, an intraperitoneal (IP) saline injection was given 30 min prior
to baseline testing to minimize the effect of the injection procedure
on the test day (day 4). Gabapentin targets the protein product
of Cacna2d1, the 𝛼2/𝛿1 subunit of L-type Voltage-gated Calcium
Channel (VGCCs) (Marais et al. 2001). On the test day, gabapentin
(25–50 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or saline vehicle
was injected (IP
, 20 μl/g). von Frey testing was performed 45 and
150 min after injection, with time of testing based on our previous
study (Chesler et al. 2003a). The investigator administering injections
and performing von Frey testing was blind to the treatment. To
evaluate the effects of gabapentin in BXD strains, the most effective
dose from the study in the progenitor strains (50 mg/kg) was used
and all mice were evaluated for mechanical sensitivity at both 45 and
150 min.
To test the role of Csnk1e in mechanosensation, the effect of
PF-670462 (Pfizer Global R&D, Groton, CT
, USA; and subsequently
Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO, USA), an inhibitor of casein kinase
(CK)-1𝛿/𝜀, was tested in progenitor and selected BXD RI strains
similar to the method described above for Cacna2d1 testing. The
method of von Frey testing was as described above but with an IP
saline injection given 5 min prior to baseline testing. On the test day,
PF-670462 (20–40 mg/kg) or saline vehicle was injected IP (10 μl/g)
and von Frey testing was performed 5 min after injection. When
evaluating the effects of PF-670462 in BXD strains, the effective dose
from the progenitor strain study (20 mg/kg) was administered and
mechanical sensitivity evaluated at 5, 20 and 30 min post-injection.
The investigator administering injections and performing von Frey
testing was blind to the treatment.
As a confirmatory test of transcript covariance and to evaluate
whether the general pattern of expression covariance is also found in
a pain-relevant tissue, basal Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e transcript expres-
sion in pain-related brain regions and L3–L4 dorsal root ganglia
(DRGs) in the two progenitor strains using quantitative, real-time poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Naïve, male C57BL/6J and DBA/2J
mice (5–6/strain, The Jackson Laboratory) were briefly anesthetized
with isoflurane, immediately decapitated and their brains removed
and dissected to remove brain regions of interest and DRGs were
removed after isoflurane anesthesia and intra-cardiac perfusion with
saline. The DRGs from two male mice of the same strain were pooled
per sample to provide sufficient RNA yield.
The RNA was extracted from the tissues using 1.0 ml trizol (Invit-
rogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cDNA was created using SuperScript
II reverse transcriptase according to manufacturer’
s instructions. The
thermal cycling conditions for quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
were 10 min at 95∘C followed by 40 cycles at 95∘C for 15 seconds
and 60∘C for 1 min on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection
System or an ABI StepOne Plus System. Forward and reverse
primers were as follows: 5 μM of ATGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA
and ATGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCT T for Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate
Dehydrogenase (Gapdh); 5 μM of ACAGACGGTGGGATTACGAG and
GCACCAGGTCCACTTTTGTT for Cacna2d1; and 10 μM GACTGGAA-
CATGCTCAAATTCG and CCGTCTTTCCCGGTCTACATC for Csnk1e
(Palmer et al. 2005) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville,
IA, USA). Statistical significance of strain differences in target gene
expression relative to Gapdh was determined with Student’
s t-test.
Fold difference in expression is reported relative to the C57BL/6
strain. In a data set collected with the same strains, but not presented
in this manuscript, we were able to complete a comparison of GAPDH
expression levels across BXD strains. We found no significant differ-
ence in expression of GAPDH for the strains used herein for any of
the tissues used.
Mixed model ANOVA was used to test for group differences because
of genotype at the location of interest and drug treatment. The effect
of pharmacological agent administration was calculated by adjusting
for saline treatment effects at each time point relative to the start
of injection. The peak effect of drug over time was fit in a mixed
model ANOVA using JMP 10 (SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA). The random
effect of strain was fit within allele group. The fixed effect of allele
group was evaluated to determine the impact of allele (Cacna2d1 or
Csnk1e, as appropriate) on sensitivity to pharmacological targeting of
the appropriate gene product in representative strains.
Results
Repeated-measures ANOVA showed no significant interaction
of BXD RI strain with day of testing (F50,356 = 0.99; P = 0.51),
no main effect of day of testing (F2,356 = 0.17; P = 0.85) (data
not shown), and a significant effect of BXD RI mouse strain
on mechanical threshold (F25,178 = 5.5; P < 0.001). The BXD
RI strain means of von Frey withdrawal thresholds averaged
over 3 days for left and right hind paws separately were highly
correlated with each other (rp = 0.96) and with the average
threshold for both paws (rp = 0.99, 0.99). Because no effect
of paw side or repeated testing was observed, the average
of values for both hind paws and 3 days of testing was

mapping and genetic correlation analyses. Analyses using
left or right hind paw means produced similar results. The
calculated heritability estimate (h2 = 0.44) indicates that 44%
of the total trait variability is because of the genotype of the
strains.
The QTL mapping of the BXD strain means showed
two statistically significant QTL peaks on proximal Chr 5
(LOD = 4.0) and distal Chr 15 (LOD = 4.2) (significant LOD
by permutation = 3.76; Fig. 2; see Fig. S1). Based on a
1.0 LOD drop-off from the peak LOD score (Lander &
Botstein 1989), there are 64 genes in the region of the
QTL on Chr 5 [4.468–19.63 Mb, 95% confidence interval
(CI); Fig. 2] and 153 genes in the QTL region on Chr 15
(74.791–79.503 Mb; Fig. 2) according to a search of the
Mouse Genome Database (1 May 2015; GRCm38/mm10
assembly). Transcript covariance analysis was used to prior-
itize subsequent testing of the positional candidate genes.
Expression of three genes, Cacna2d1, Csnk1e and Ift27
(Rabl4) was highly correlated with von Frey withdrawal
thresholds in five of eight brain areas for which data are avail-
able in the BXD RI mouse strains. Furthermore, Cacna2d1,
Csnk1e and Ift27 are located in the detected QTLs on
Chr 5: 15.4–15.9 Mb, Chr15: 79.2–79.3 Mb and Chr 15:
78.15–78.17
, respectively. Expression was significantly cor-
related (P < 0.001) in one or more brain areas for 1470 genes
or microarray probe sets, two or more brain regions for 44
transcripts, three or more brain regions for 7 transcripts (see
Fig. 3). These results can be replicated on the GeneNetwork
and GeneWeaver systems, where the analyses can be repro-
duced and results examined in detail (see Appendix S3, Sup-
porting Information). Each of the brain areas examined has a
known role in this sensory trait and evidence from each brain
area was equally considered in this analysis. While using the
number of brain regions in which gene expression is altered is
not a perfect standard for determination of a gene’
s influence
on a phenotype of interest, it seemed reasonable to priori-
tize genes exhibiting differential expression across multiple
brain regions with a known role in nociceptive sensory pro-
cessing and/or modulation for this study. The co-expression
across multiple brain regions implies a general mechanism
of regulation that may imply similar correlation in other more
relevant tissues (e.g. DRG, dorsal spinal cord, etc.) whereas
a correlation with expression in an irrelevant tissue is less
likely to generalize and would be a less compelling criterion
for prioritization.
A second criterion that may be applied to candidate genes
exhibiting high trait covariance is whether there is sufficient
evidence of a genetic mechanism with expression that is reg-
ulated by the same QTL as the behavioral trait. It is possible,
though not likely given the pattern of results seen herein, that
differential gene expression is not the underlying functional
mechanism of action of the regulatory variants. The QTL map-
ping of transcript abundance enables the detection of poly-
morphisms that act through regulation of expression or sta-
bility of RNA. Such loci should exist for transcripts that have
high genetic correlation to behavioral phenotypes. Expres-
sion QTL was retrieved for each of the three transcripts in
the M430 INIA brain data set in GeneNetwork.org. The peak
cis QTL for each transcript is Chr 5: 14.32 Mb at rs3687916
(P < 0.000055) for Cacna2d1; Chr 15: 78.74 Mb at rs3667755
(P < 0.000001) for Csnk1e and Chr 15: 77
.99 Mb at rs6342608
(P < 0.000004) for Ift27.
To verify that the strain differences in the abundance of
Cacna2d1, Csnk1e and Ift27 were attributable to genetic
effects and not to polymorphisms within the probe target
sequence (Walter et al. 2007, 2009), we utilized the brain
M430 INIA data set in GeneNetwork.org and identified the
probe sets for each of the candidate genes. After omitting
the probe(s) in which a B6 vs. D2 Single-nucleotide polymor-
phism (SNP) was identified, QTL mapping was performed for
each transcript. A significant cis expression QTL remained
detectable for all genes, indicating that the abundance of
each transcript is regulated by a genetic polymorphism at
or near its coding gene (see Appendix S1 for probe level
analysis).
Each of the three genes makes compelling candidates,
with potential regulatory variants, and it is entirely possible
that multiple-linked genes influence mechanical sensitivity. A
role for Ift27 in mechanosensation is already known because
of its association with the congenital ciliopathy Bardet–Biedl
syndrome (Tan et al. 2007). Deletion of other BBS-related
genes in mice and worms has been shown to affect von
Frey sensitivity (Tan et al. 2007). Thus, Ift27 remains a plau-
sible candidate gene. Unfortunately, no selective pharma-
cological agents target the Ift27 gene product. However,
Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e are amenable to specific pharmaco-
logical targeting and to date have no known role in punctate

priority for candidate genes testing. Additional candidates
from these intervals may also exist within the QTL intervals,
so these tests are not exclusionary.
To further interpret the nature of the observed genetic
effects on the von Frey assay of mechanosenation, we exam-
ined the correlation of von Frey scores to over 4600 traits
in GeneNetwork.org. Correlation P-values were subject to
q-value estimation to control for false discovery rate. It is
robust to the dependencies among multiple tests and there-
fore suitable to application in GeneNetwork, for which many
repeated observations are included. von Frey withdrawal

correlated with dopamine (DA) transporter expression in the

typy from this study was also correlated with von Frey thresh-
old (rp = 0.69, P = 1.6 × 10−4, q < 0.13, 23 strains in common;
RecordID 10295). The stereotypy trait is regulated by a QTL
on Chromosome 15 at 82.95 Mb. This is upstream of the
Ift27/Csnk1e region, but likely to be in linkage disequilibrium
with it, introducing the potential for spurious genetic associ-
ation of DA-related phenotypes with von Frey response.
The von Frey mechanosensitivity was correlated with
measures of anxiety (rp = 0.75, P = 6.0 × 10−5, q < 0.09,
20 strains in common; RecordID 12395) and habituation
(rp = 0.67
, P = 8.2 × 10−4, q < 0.29, 20 strains in common;
RecordID 10038) both regulated by a genetic locus on Chr
15 near Csnk1e and consistent with the previously estab-
lished role of Csnk1e in anxiety and habituation. No trends
of correlation were observed to traits regulated by the Chr
5 locus, indicating that variation in Cacna2d1 modulates
punctate mechanosensation and not a known confounding
trait. Furthermore, von Frey withdrawal thresholds were not
significantly correlated with previously examined thermal,
inflammatory and electrical footshock-induced nociception
(rp = −0.02 to 0.32, 12–24 strains in common; data on
www.genenetwork.org), further indicating the genetic dis-
tinctiveness of mechanical sensitivity among sensory traits
examined in BXD RI mice.
To determine whether the candidate genes are involved
in modulating baseline mechanical sensitivity, pharmacolog-
ical ligands acting at the protein products of Cacna2d1 and
Csnk1e were tested in the progenitor strains of the BXD RI
mice, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. The IP injection of low doses
of the 𝛼2/𝛿1 subunit-targeting drug gabapentin (Field et al.
2006; Marais et al. 2001) significantly and dose-dependently
increased von Frey mechanical thresholds compared with
baseline (Fig. 4, P < 0.05). Gabapentin was less effective in
DBA/2J mice as reflected by a significant effect of strain on
change in mechanical threshold after treatment (P < 0.05).
DBA/2J mice also exhibit greater Cacna2d1 expression in the
cerebellum, prefrontal cortex and striatum and less expres-
sion in the lumbar DRGs (Table 1), which suggests that the
effects may be because of the effects of gabapentin act-
ing at the peripheral afferent level rather than in the brain.
However, when tested in selected BXD strains, presence
of the C57BL/6J and/or DBA/2J allele for Cacna2d1 did not
significantly affect the response to gabapentin (F1,13 = 0.023;
P = 0.882; see Fig. 5) though comparison of mRNA expres-
sion means across strains with the same allele status
shows significant DRG expression differences of both can-
didate genes (C57BL/6J > DBA/2J, P < 0.01) (see Table 2).
This may be because of confounding sedating effects with
independent genetic control (though the dose in this study
is subthreshold for inducing sedation) and/or strain differ-
ences in gabapentin metabolism separate from the effects
of Cacna2d1 genotype.
The IP injection of PF-670462, the selective inhibitor of
CK-1𝛿/𝜀, produced a greater dose-dependent (P < 0.0001)
increase in von Frey withdrawal thresholds in DBA/2J mice
than in C57BL/6J mice (P < 0.05 for effect of strain; Fig. 6)
that is particularly apparent at the lowest dose of PF-670462.

mary effect of Csnk1e on mechanosensitivity. Gabapentin
and PF-670462 did not have the same pattern of effects
against thermal nociception in Hargreaves’ thermal plantar
test, in which the same behavioral response of paw with-
drawal is elicited [shown for gabapentin in (Chesler et al.

implicate both genes in modulating von Frey response.
Discussion
This study identified regions on Chr 5 and 15 containing genes
underlying heritable differences in mechanosensation. Three
types of evidence were evaluated in addressing whether
these genes were involved in heritable trait variation: (1) is
the gene polymorphic? (2) is the gene regulated by varia-
tion within the region? (3) is there functional evidence impli-
cating the gene product in trait variation? The first two are
addressed through analyses in GeneNetwork, followed by

through pharmacological experimentation.
Consistent and robust positive genetic correlations of von
Frey thresholds with expression of Cacna2d1, Ift27 and
Csnk1e were detected in five of eight brain areas with gene
expression data available in BXD RI mice. Although these
tissues are not all widely accepted as substrates of classi-
cal pain pathways, these areas have been previously impli-
cated in sensory processes, emotionality and/or responses
to, or the treatment of, neuropathic pain including mechan-
ical hypersensitivity in neuropathic pain models and from
imaging studies of human patients (Ansah et al. 2007; Bian
et al. 2006; Duquette et al. 2007; Hagelberg et al. 2004; Saab
& Willis 2003). The convergence of expression correlations
across multiple gene expression data sets suggests that
the genetic effects on gene expression and correlation to
von Frey thresholds may be manifested in other tissues.
Further investigation of the anatomical location of action
of the candidate genes and their precise role in von Frey
mechanosensation is warranted, particularly because these
results do not preclude other anatomical sites of action. Fur-
thermore, although we evaluated multiple microarray data
sets and multiple tissues, the possibility of false negative
results remains, and therefore, other polymorphic loci within
the QTL may influence von Frey tests of mechanosensation.
However, experimental validation of the candidate genes pro-
vide strengthened support for their role in von Frey response.
The expression covariance results together with pharmaco-
logical targeting of the genes’protein products suggest that

expression levels of Cacna2d1, Ift27 and Csnk1e across BXD
RI strains and their progenitor strains may contribute to heri-
table differences in mechanical sensitivity.
The neuropathic pain medications gabapentin and pre-
gabalin reduce neuronal excitability and neurotransmission
of affected neurons by acting at the VGCC 𝛼2/𝛿1 subunit
encoded by Cacna2d1, and thereby, counter mechanical allo-
dynia in neuropathic pain patients and animal models of neu-
ropathic pain (Bian et al. 2006; Field et al. 2000, 2006; Joshi
& Taylor 2006). This study shows the ability of gabapentin to
increase baseline von Frey thresholds in naïve mice from the
two progenitor strains, indicating that Cacna2d1 is a reason-
able candidate gene for basal mechanosensation, and that
the effect is genotype-dependent as expected from previous
studies (Chesler et al. 2003a; Rode et al. 2007; Zhou et al.
2014). Prior studies have shown that Cacna2d1 expression is
increased in the DRG and dorsal horn of the spinal cord after
nerve injury (Costigan et al. 2002; Field et al. 2000, 2006;
Luo et al. 2002; Matsumoto et al. 2006) and this increase has
been shown to be essential to the development of mechani-
cal, but not thermal, hypersensitivity after nerve injury (Patel
et al. 2013). Thus, in addition, this study suggests that drugs
that act at the 𝛼2/𝛿1 subunit may act directly on the fun-
damental and heritable mechanisms of mechanosensation,
and hence, Cacna2d1 may represent a molecular mecha-
nism common to baseline mechanosensation and mechan-
ical hypersensitivity after nerve injury.
Cacna2d1 expression in the investigated central nervous
system (CNS) areas of BXD RI mouse strains is positively
correlated with von Frey thresholds (or negatively correlated
with mechanosensitivity). This appears in contrast with the
increase in Cacna2d1 expression in DRGs and dorsal horn
that is correlated with mechanical allodynia after nerve injury
and with the current results of gabapentin being less effec-
tive to increase von Frey thresholds in DBA/2J mice that
display more Cacna2d1 expression in the CNS areas than
C57BL/6J mice. Potentially explaining the latter, it is possible
that the genotype-dependent effects of systemic gabapentin
on von Frey thresholds reported here are mediated by cells in
the DRG including peripheral afferent neurons because, para-
doxically, we show that DBA/2J mice exhibit less Cacna2d1
expression in lumbar DRGs than C57BL/6J mice. Compar-
isons across multiple measures with only two inbred strains
have inherent limitations that caution against concluding the
presence or absence of a relationship between the measures
(of DRG expression and von Frey thresholds) especially when
one is a behavioral measure (Crabbe et al. 1999). To further
investigate this issue, we evaluated the effect of gabapentin
on mechanical sensitivity in a subset of BXD strains and found
that Cacna2d1 genotype did not predict the magnitude of
change in mechanical sensitivity following gabapentin; the
difference may be because of a number of factors related to
strain differences in other genes influencing drug metabolism
and/or issues related to competing behaviors also induced by
gabapentin, namely sedation which could mask subtle effects
on mechanical threshold. Prior studies have identified seda-
tion as a primary side effect of gabapentin administration at
analgesic doses (O’
Connor & Dworkin 2009) and this may
alter the response to the test stimulus apart from any effects
at our site of interest. At present, the opposite directions
of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strain differences in expression of
Cacna2d1 between the lumbar DRGs and CNS areas can-
not be resolved, although one could speculate that Cacna2d1
might be differentially regulated in the peripheral nervous
system as observed with other calcium channels (Shin et al.
2003). Regarding the primary goal of this study, which was

 Young et al.
to determine candidate mechanisms of heritable variation,
data are not yet available from a sufficient number of inbred
strains to determine whether Cacna2d1 expression differ-
ences in the DRG contribute specifically to heritable differ-
ences in mechanosensation but the findings herein support
this hypothesis.
Although the QTL for mechanosensation on Chr 15 over-
laps with the previously identified pain1 QTL for the neu-
ropathic pain model of autotomy behavior following sciatic
and saphenous nerve transection (Devor et al. 2005; Lariv-
iere 2009; Seltzer et al. 2001), it is likely that different genes
are involved in the effects observed here. A recent report
by Nissenbaum and colleagues localized pain1 to an inter-
val on Chr 15 (75.27–79.5 Mb) that almost precisely matches
the CI of the significant QTL for von Frey thresholds on Chr
15 (75.3–79.4) despite the use of RI segregation test and
recombinant progeny test experiments with different progen-
itor strains than those of the BXD RI strains (Nissenbaum
et al. 2010). Cacng2 was identified as the single highest
priority candidate from pain1 based on significant correla-
tion between DRG mRNA expression and autotomy behavior
in five inbred mouse strains. We found no convergent evi-
dence of CNS Cacng2 expression covariance with von Frey
thresholds across BXD RI strains (P > 0.02; data not shown).
Though this study does not rule it out, our findings are in
agreement with prior research showing variation in sensitivity
to neuropathic pain, thermal nociception and mechanosensa-
tion depend on genetically distinct mechanisms of heritability
(Lariviere 2002; Young 2014).
Pharmacological testing of the CK-1 inhibitor PF-670462
indicates for the first time that Csnk1e and its protein prod-
uct, CK-1𝜀, have a role in mechanosensation, and that the
drug effect is genotype-dependent and greater in DBA/2J
mice that exhibit greater Csnk1e expression in several CNS
areas. Csnk1e is involved in a diverse array of signaling path-
ways, including dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotrans-
mission in the striatum and other brain areas (Chergui et al.
2005; Greengard 2001). In this study, von Frey thresholds
were highly positively correlated with Csnk1e expression in
five brain areas including the striatum across BXD strains.
Utz et al. (2010) report strong staining within nerve cells
of the trigeminal and DRG, in addition to widespread neu-
ronal expression of CK-1𝜀 in the brain. Similar to the pattern
seen with Cacna2d1, Csnk1e expression has been shown
to increase in DRG and the spinal cord after nerve injury
(Sakurai et al. 2009) and could, therefore, represent a mecha-
nism underlying mechanical hypersensitivity at this location.
More recently, Kurihara et al. (2014) reported that CK-1 inhi-
bition attenuated mechanical allodynia and decreased exci-
tatory post-synaptic potentials in the dorsal spinal cord fol-
lowing inflammation. In the CNS, CK-1 is also known for reg-
ulating circadian rhythms via the phosphorylation of Period
proteins (Gallego & Virshup 2007) and influencing Wnt signal-
ing and GSK-3 formation (Knippschild et al. 2005; Price 2006).
In QTL mapping studies, the genomic location of Csnk1e
has been implicated in sensitivity to circadian function (Meng
et al. 2008) and the stimulant effects of methamphetamine
(Bryant et al. 2009, 2012; Palmer et al. 2005). Subsequently,
polymorphisms in the human CSNK1E gene have been impli-
cated in differential sensitivity to the euphoric effects of
amphetamine (Veenstra-Vanderweele et al. 2006), though a
subsequent replication of this finding was not successful
(Hart et al. 2013), risk for heroin addiction (Levran et al. 2008)
as well as with risk for schizophrenia (Huang et al. 2012).
These studies attest to the pleiotropic properties of CK-1𝜀 and
highlight both the presence of functional polymorphisms of
Csnk1e that may influence mechanosensation in humans and
the need for further study of the potential pharmacological
inhibition of CK-1𝜀 to treat patients suffering from mechanoal-
lodynia and/or hypersensitivity.
Genetic variation and co-expression of mechanosensation
with Ift27 implicates a cilia protein in pain sensitivity. Previ-
ous findings indicate that murine DRG neurons are ciliated
and that disruption of the normal structure and function of
the cilia results in alterations in thermal and mechanical sen-
sitivity (Tan et al. 2007). Moreover, ciliary function in other
cell types, namely keratinocytes (Elofsson et al. 1984) and
Schwann cells (Grillo & Palay 1963), could also play a role in
mechanosensation. Recent genetic analysis of thermal noci-
ception in the Diversity Outbred mapping population showed
hydin, which encodes a ciliary protein as a likely candidate
gene (Recla et al. 2014), further highlighting the potential role
of variation within ciliary structure and function in periph-
eral sensory processing. Given the lack of pharmacological
agents capable of selectively targeting the protein product of
Ift27, we could not further evaluate its role at this time.
This study presents not only evidence for candidate genes
underlying heritable differences in mechanosensation but
also serves as a model for the combination of tools and tech-
niques that can be used to elucidate new biological mecha-
nisms and identify novel targets for drug development. Using
RI strains to map QTL, eQTL to identify putative candidates
within the identified genomic region(s), and pharmacological
manipulation of the protein products of these genes, we iden-
tified genetic mechanisms with a previously unknown role
in mechanical sensitivity. While it is possible that polymor-
phisms in other candidate genes, both from within and out-
side of this region of interest, may contribute to variation in
mechanosensation, the current transcript covariance results,
their convergence with the QTL mapping results and pharma-
cological testing suggest that Cacna2d1 and Csnk1e play a
significant role in heritable variation in baseline mechanosen-
sitivity and response to pharmacotherapeutics. Identification
and manipulations of the precise causal genetic mechanisms
may lead to development of better preclinical models of
mechanical sensitivity and identification of novel therapeutic
agents for the treatment of neurological disorders that fea-
ture mechanical sensitivity.

is indicated by the pink horizontal line (significant LOD = 3.76)
and pale blue horizontal line (suggestive LOD = 2.34). Num-
bers and the letter X along the top of the figure refer to
chromosomes. A total of 3795 non-redundant DNA mark-
ers polymorphic between the progenitor strains and at loci
throughout the genome were considered. Table 2 lists the
significantly associated markers. Figures 3,4 show the signif-
icant QTLs in greater detail.
Figure S2: Gabapentin dose-dependently decreases base-
line thermal nociceptive sensitivity with differential effec-
tiveness observed between the progenitor strains of BXD
RI mice, C57BL/6J (filled circles) and DBA/2J (open trian-
gles) (n = 5–6). These strains show significant differences
in expression of Cacna2d1 (see Tables 1 and 2). At 45 min
post-injection, gabapentin dose-dependently increases von
Frey thresholds only in DBA/2J mice (P < 0.05). At 150 min
post-injection, only DBA/2J mice display dose-dependence
of the effect of gabapentin on thermal latencies compared
to vehicle-treated mice (P < 0.05). Error bars represent SEM.

product of Csnk1e CK-1𝜀 did not significantly affect thermal
nociceptive sensitivity (P > 0.05) in C57BL/6J (n = 5–6; filled
circles) and DBA/2J (n = 5–6; open triangles) strains. Error
