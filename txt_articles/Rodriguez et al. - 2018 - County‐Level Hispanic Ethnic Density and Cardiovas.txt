Background-—Hispanics are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, and little is known about how Hispanic ethnic
population density impacts cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.
Methods and Results-—We examined county-level deaths for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites from 2003 to 2012 using data
from the National Center for Health Statistics’ Multiple Cause of Death mortality files. Counties with more than 20 Hispanic deaths
(n=715) were included in the analyses. CVD deaths were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision
(ICD-10), I00 to I78, and population estimates were calculated using linear interpolation from 2000 and 2010 census data.
Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the association of Hispanic ethnic density with Hispanic and non-Hispanic white
age-adjusted CVD mortality rates. County-level age-adjusted CVD mortality rates were adjusted for county-level demographic,
socioeconomic, and healthcare factors. There were a total of 4 769 040 deaths among Hispanics (n=382 416) and non-Hispanic
whites (n=4 386 624). Overall, cardiovascular age-adjusted mortality rates were higher among non-Hispanic whites compared with
Hispanics (244.8 versus 189.0 per 100 000). Hispanic density ranged from 1% to 96% in each county. Counties in the highest
compared with lowest category of Hispanic density had 60% higher Hispanic mortality (215.3 versus 134.2 per 100 000
population). In linear regression models, after adjusting for county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare factors,
increasing Hispanic ethnic density remained strongly associated with mortality for Hispanics but not for non-Hispanic whites.
Conclusions-—CVD mortality is higher in counties with higher Hispanic ethnic density. County-level characteristics do not fully
explain the higher CVD mortality among Hispanics in ethnically concentrated counties. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e009107.

Key Words: enclaves • ethnicity • health disparities
H
ispanics are the largest minority group in the United
States and experience a disproportionate burden of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.1,2 Despite this,
when studied in aggregate, Hispanics experience lower
mortality rates when compared with non-Hispanic whites
(NHWs). This lower-than-expected mortality, despite greater
adverse CVD risk profiles and lower levels of income and
education than NHWs, has been coined the “Hispanic
paradox.”3–6
Some
have
speculated
that
residence
in
enclaves may be protective for Hispanics by providing a
place where more salubrious cultural habits are maintained
(ie, improved nutrition and lower smoking rates).7 Ethnic
enclaves may also provide added social cohesion and support,
which may partially account for the mortality advantage
experienced by Hispanics.
As the Hispanic population in the United States continues
to grow, there is also evidence of increasing residential
segregation.8,9 Hispanics are more likely to be exposed to
neighborhood disadvantage, living in areas with higher rates
of poverty and lower average incomes as compared with
predominantly NHW neighborhoods.10 Much work on segre-
gation and cardiovascular health has focused on blacks and
has shown that residential segregation has deleterious effects
on
health
outcomes,
including
higher

 cardiovascular disease,11 hypertension,12 and likelihood to
receive care for acute myocardial infarctions in hospitals with
higher mortality rates.13 Yet the data for the health effects of
residential
segregation
for
Hispanics
are
limited
and
mixed.11,14,15 To our knowledge, no study has specifically
assessed the impact of Hispanic ethnic density on CVD
mortality using national, contemporary data including a
diverse sample of US Hispanics.
Thus, the objective of this study was to explore the
association between Hispanic ethnic concentration (Hispanic
density) and cardiovascular mortality among Hispanics and
NHWs. We tested the hypothesis that residence in ethnic
enclaves would be protective for Hispanic cardiovascular
mortality, even after adjusting for county-level demographic,
socioeconomic, and healthcare-related characteristics.
Methods
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be
made available to other researchers for purposes of repro-
ducing the results or replicating the procedure because our
data set is restricted; however, these data are publicly
available through the US Census Bureau should other
investigators choose to obtain them.
Outcome Measure
County-level deaths for Hispanics and NHWs were examined
using the National Center for Health Statistics’ Multiple Cause
of Death mortality files from 2003 to 2012. To ensure that
there would be sufficient counties as well as sufficient deaths
in each county in the analyses, we included counties with
more than 20 Hispanic CVD deaths during the study period
(n=715). We then identified CVD mortality using International
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for
cardiovascular deaths (I00–I78) for Hispanic and NHW adults
over age 25. Population estimates were obtained from the
2000 and 2010 census data, and the midyear estimate of the
study period was calculated using linear interpolation and
extrapolation out to 2012. We calculated county-level directly
standardized age- and sex-adjusted CVD mortality rates
(AMRs) per 100 000 population for Hispanics and NHWs by
5-year age categories, as done in previous studies.16,17
Predictor Variable and County-Level Covariates
The proportion of Hispanic adults by county was calculated
from census records on the basis of linear interpolations
methods from 2000 and 2010. County-level covariates were
identified from the 2011 and 2012 County Health Rankings
database, the census, and American Community Survey
records (Table S1). The County Health Rankings and Road-
maps program (http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/about-
project) collects data from different data sources and
geolocates these data in order to provide a reliable and
sustainable source of health information in US communities.
We categorized the county-level covariates into 3 groups:
demographic characteristics (total population size, Hispanic
population size, NHW population size, Hispanic deaths, NHW
deaths, proportion 18 years of age and younger, proportion
65 years of age and older, and proportion female), socioeco-
nomic characteristics (median household income, proportion
below the poverty line, education, proportion employed,
proportion of blacks, limited English proficiency proportion,
and rural), and healthcare factors (proportion uninsured and
primary care physician ratio).
Statistical Analysis
Because county Hispanic density is skewed, we categorized
counties into 5 groups of Hispanic proportions using cut
points based on a logarithmic scale for visual presentation:
1.38% to 2.71% (n=21), 2.72% to 7.38% (n=186), 7.39% to
20.08% (n=260), 20.09% to 54.60% (n=198) and, 54.61% to
96.10% (n=50). Directly standardized AMRs were further
calculated for Hispanics and NHWs in each category. Kendall
correlation was performed to test the increasing trend for
Hispanic and NHW AMRs by categories of increasing Hispanic
density. Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation)
and general linear models were performed to compare the
county-level characteristics among the categories. Before
model selection, a correlation coefficient analysis was used to
exclude collinear covariates. After testing assumptions for
linear regression, including linearity, normality of the residu-
als, homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity, multivariable
linear regression models were used to examine the associ-
ation of Hispanic density as a continuous variable with
Hispanic and NHW AMRs with adjustment of county-level
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Hispanics experience greater cardiovascular mortality in
counties with high Hispanic ethnic density.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Counties with high Hispanic density likely have worse
access to care and other adverse environmental factors that
lead to greater mortality.
• Public health and clinical efforts to improve outcomes for
Hispanic patients need to target the counties where
Hispanics are concentrated.

 covariates. Because Hispanic ethnic density was not normally
distributed, we performed a logarithmic transformation of this
variable for all models. The base model included the county-
level Hispanic density, population size, and proportion female.
We excluded Hispanic and NHW population size and death
counts from our final models due to the high collinearity with
total population size.
We performed a sensitivity analysis using the Hispanic
isolation index, a commonly used measure of metropolitan-
level segregation.18,19 The Hispanic isolation index measures
the extent to which Hispanics in a county or metropolitan area
are exposed only to other Hispanics (ie, isolated from other
race/ethnic groups). It is a measure of exposure, one of the 5
dimensions of metropolitan-level segregation, and is com-
puted as the minority-weighted average of the minority
proportion in each area, with the NHW population as the
referent group.19 It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values
indicating less exposure of Hispanic individuals to NHWs.
All analyses were performed in R Studio (version 0.99.896)
and SAS (version 9.4), and statistical tests were based on
2-sided tests with a significance level of 0.05. The map
(Figure 1) was created using Tableau Desktop Public Edition
10.1.5 based on linear of interpolation of 2000 and 2010 US
census data.
The Institutional Review Board of Stanford University
approved this study and provided a waiver for use of these
publicly available mortality and US census data.
Results
A total of 4 769 040 deaths occurred during our study period
among Hispanics (n=382 416) and NHWs (n=4 386 624)
within the 715 counties studies. Overall, cardiovascular AMRs
were higher among NHWs compared with Hispanics (244.8
versus 189.0 per 100 000). The Hispanic proportion of each US
county is shown in Figure 1. Counties with higher Hispanic
density were predominantly located in the southwestern United
States, southern Florida, and a few regions in the Northeast.
Table 1 shows county-level demographic characteristics,
socioeconomic status, and healthcare factors by Hispanic
density categories among the 715 counties. Hispanic density
ranged from 1% to 96%. Counties with a higher Hispanic
density were more likely to have greater socioeconomic
disadvantage with a lower median household income, higher

 proportion below the poverty line, lower high school gradu-
ation rates, and a greater proportion of residents of limited
English proficiency. Counties with high Hispanic density were
also more likely to be rural. The proportion of uninsured
county residents increased with increasing Hispanic ethnic
density. Counties with the lowest Hispanic density had 78%
more primary care physicians per 100 000 population
compared with counties with the highest Hispanic density.
Age-adjusted CVD mortality of Hispanics and NHWs by
Hispanic density categories is shown in Figure 2. Overall,
there was a statistically significant graded increase in
Hispanic CVD mortality as Hispanic proportion increased
(P=0.0143). However, Hispanic proportion was not signifi-
cantly associated with mortality for NHWs (P=0.6242).
Counties in the highest compared with lowest category of
Hispanic density had 60% higher Hispanic mortality (215.3
versus 134.2 per 100 000).
Table 2 provides the multivariable linear regression model
results, adjusting for demographic (base model), socioeco-
nomic, and healthcare factors separately, and then combined
for both Hispanic AMRs and NHW AMRs. Socioeconomic and
healthcare factors explained 37% and 26% of the county-level
variation in Hispanic mortality and 30% and 10% for NHW
mortality, respectively. The fully adjusted model accounted for
38% and 31% of the mortality variation for Hispanics and
NHWs, respectively. Hispanic density had a stronger associa-
tion with mortality among Hispanics as compared with NHWs
(r2=0.22, P<0.0001) than NHWs (r2=0.01, P=0.0461) in the
base model. In fully adjusted models, the mortality gradient
for Hispanics in counties with higher Hispanic density
remained unchanged. For each 1-unit increase in Hispanic
density on the log scale, there was a 22.57 increase in age-
adjusted mortality rates per 100 000 for Hispanics. The fully
adjusted estimates are modeled in Figure 3, using the

 midpoint value for each Hispanic ethnic density category and
the mean value for other covariates. Adjusted models for
Hispanic and NHW AMRs by Hispanic proportion including all
available data points are presented in Figure 4.
In a sensitivity analysis, we used the Hispanic isolation
index as the predictor (Table S2) for the multivariable linear
regression models. The results were qualitatively similar.
Discussion
Using a decade of national data, we found that Hispanic
ethnic density is positively correlated with CVD mortality
among both Hispanics and NHWs. However, this finding
persisted for Hispanics after adjusting for county-level
sociodemographic and healthcare factors. The finding that
Hispanic ethnic density is associated with increased CVD
mortality is noteworthy and challenges existing notions about
the protective effect of cultural enclaves among Hispanics.
Prior work studying the effects of neighborhood segrega-
tion and CVD among Hispanics is limited and mixed. Studies
have largely focused on CVD risk factor prevalence and self-
reported health outcome measures.18,20,21 While residential
segregation has been linked with higher incidence of CVD
among blacks, there was no association in incidence of CVD
among Hispanics in the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.11
Using the isolation index as a measure of residential
segregation, Corral and colleagues found a positive associa-
tion
between
Hispanic
segregation
and
prevalence
of
obesity.22 One study in Chicago found that although residen-
tial segregation was associated with lower odds of hyperten-
sion, individuals were less likely to regularly see physicians or
take antihypertensive medications.23 Neighborhoods with

 high Hispanic ethnic density have been linked with better diet
but worse physical activity environments.7
Our findings have several possible explanations. Similar to
blacks,
Hispanics
are
likely
to
live
in
more
deprived
neighborhoods with higher poverty and lower availability of
resources.24,25 As documented in our study and others,11
areas of high Hispanic segregation are associated with
adverse socioeconomic conditions. Low neighborhood socio-
economic status has been associated with an increased risk
of out-of-hospital cardiac death.26 Furthermore, it is possible
that residual confounding by unmeasured neighborhood or
individual-level characteristics account for the higher mortal-
ity in counties with high Hispanic ethnic density, and that the
previously hypothesized protective effects of cultural enclaves
are unable to fully counter these effects. Other studies have
also found deleterious effects of residence in enclaves on
mortality; one study found that Hispanic residential segrega-
tion was associated with increased breast cancer mortality
among women in Texas.27
Our study found that areas of higher Hispanic population
density had higher rates of uninsured individuals and fewer
primary care physicians. Healthcare facilities that Hispanics
are able to access may also provide lower quality of care,
partially explaining the higher mortality rates. Prior work has
documented that care for elderly Hispanics is highly concen-
trated among certain hospitals, known as “Hispanic-serving
hospitals.”28–30 These hospitals have lower-quality metrics
and experience higher readmissions for acute myocardial
infarctions and heart failure for both Hispanics and NHWs,
even after adjustment for hospital and patient characteristics.
It is likely that quality and resource disadvantages in these
acute care hospitals impact CVD mortality and contribute to
our findings. Similarly, in a study that looked at preventable
hospitalizations among minority patients across 15 states,
healthcare access, lower provider availability, and socioeco-
nomic factors accounted for higher rates of preventable
hospitalizations for Hispanics.31
We did not observe an association between Hispanic
ethnic density and NHW mortality in unadjusted analyses.
This is likely explained by the fact that we included only
counties that had at least 20 Hispanic deaths, excluding
�2428 counties. Counties where Hispanics live and die
have less favorable socioeconomic factors. After adjusting
for county-level characteristics, NHWs experienced lower
CVD mortality rates in counties with a higher Hispanic
proportion, although the effect size was small. A possible
explanation for our findings is that areas of high Hispanic
ethnic density are associated with improved outcomes for
other ethnic groups living in the same area, thereby
countering the effects of deleterious county-level charac-
teristics. One study by Chetty and colleagues documented
that life expectancy was positively correlated with local

and non-Hispanic whites by Hispanic proportion. The model estimates include midpoint values of Hispanic
density on log scale (1.9% for category 1, 4.5% for category 2, 12.2% for category 3, 33.1 for category 4,
and 73.7 for category 5) and mean values were used for other covariates (population size, proportion
female, median household income, % under poverty line, % high school graduation, % some college, %
unemployed, % black, % not proficient in English and % rural, % uninsured and primary care physician rate).

 area fraction of immigrants (r=0.72; P<0.001).32 That is,
the higher the proportion of immigrants in a county, the
higher the overall life expectancy of the entire county.
Alternatively,
county-level
socioeconomic
factors
may
account for more of the variation in socioeconomic-related
CVD mortality among NHWs than among Hispanics. More
granular socioeconomic measures (ie, for neighborhoods
and individuals rather than counties) may be needed in
future studies to further explore these associations across
race/ethnic groups.
Our study has several important strengths, including a
large, nationally representative sample of Hispanics and a
focus on CVD mortality. Prior studies have been limited to
Mexican Americans, whereas our analysis captures a more
representative, heterogeneous group of Hispanics of all ages
across the United States. Our analysis also adjusted for
important
county
characteristics
including
demographic,
socioeconomic, and healthcare factors, which may explain
the relationship between Hispanic ethnic density and CVD
mortality. Our findings should be interpreted in the context of
several limitations. First, we used Hispanic proportion in US
counties as a proxy for neighborhood composition. However,
we also performed a sensitivity analysis using the isolation
index
metric
that
showed
qualitatively
similar
results
(Table S2). Because of this methodological limitation, we
were unable to control for more detailed, important neigh-
borhood and individual-level characteristics such as the built
environment, which may account for residual confounding.
Our observed results may be due to unmeasured individual-
level data, which may show different patterns than our
ecological data. Our study is cross-sectional, which limits our
ability to infer causality. Misclassification of race and ethnicity
data on mortality records may have led to under- or
overestimation of mortality rates. Finally, Hispanics are a
very heterogeneous group and represent over 20 different
national origins and degrees of acculturation.1 Due to limited
sample sizes, we are unable to account for subgroup or
acculturation differences in mortality by Hispanic density.
Our findings suggest that residence in Hispanic ethnic
enclaves is unlikely to explain the Hispanic paradox in CVD
mortality. Furthermore, our work has important implications
for public health interventions designed to reduce disparities
among Hispanics. Such interventions should target areas of
high-proportion Hispanic density and explore the adverse
health consequences of residential segregation. Future stud-
ies examining the importance of ethnic density on CVD should

 disaggregate Hispanics by subgroups and acculturation, as
well as study these findings prospectively.
Conclusion
In a large, national study of 10 years of mortality data, we
found that Hispanic ethnic density is associated with
increased CVD mortality for both Hispanics and NHWs. This
finding persisted after adjusting for county-level characteris-
tics among Hispanics. More work is needed to unpack the
individual
and
neighborhood-level
explanations
for
this
observation.
