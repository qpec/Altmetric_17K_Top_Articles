ABSTRACT
Objective To compare the effectiveness of
additional moxibustion at point BL67 with
moxibustion at a non-specific acupuncture point and
with usual care alone to correct non-vertex
presentation.
Methods This was a multicentre randomised
controlled trial in which 406 low-risk pregnant
women with a fetus in ultrasound breech
presentation, with a gestational age of
33–35 weeks, were assigned to (1) true moxibustion
at point BL67 plus usual care; (2) moxibustion at
SP1, a non-specific acupuncture point (sham
moxibustion) plus usual care; or (3) usual care alone.
The primary outcome was cephalic presentation at
birth. Women were recruited at health centres in
primary healthcare.
Results In the true moxibustion group, 58.1% of
the full-term presentations were cephalic compared
with 43.4% in the sham moxibustion group (RR
1.34, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.70) and 44.8% of those in
the usual care group (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02 to
1.64). The reduction in RR of the primary outcome
in women allocated to the true moxibustion group
compared with the usual care group was 29.7%
(95% CI 3.1% to 55.2%) and the number needed
to treat was 8 (95% CI 4 to 72). There were no
severe adverse effects during the treatment.
Conclusions Moxibustion at acupuncture point
BL67 is effective and safe to correct non-vertex
presentation when used between 33 and 35 weeks
of gestation. We believe that moxibustion represents
a treatment option that should be considered to
achieve version of the non-vertex fetus.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of non-vertex or breech
presentation
is
20%
at
28 weeks
of
gestation, although spontaneous version
frequently occurs,1 so only in 3–4% of
women with a full-term singleton preg-
nancy is the fetus in a non-vertex presenta-
tion.2 In Spain, non-vertex presentations
represents 3.8% of all births.3
Caesarean section is the technique most
frequently used in cases of non-vertex
presentation.4 Compared with planned
vaginal delivery, caesarean section reduces
perinatal or neonatal death and severe
neonatal morbidity but causes increased
maternal morbidity.5 Because of the risks
associated with both breech delivery and
caesarean section, various types of man-
oeuvres have been proposed to promote
the version of the fetus towards a cephalic
presentation. Of these, the method most
commonly adopted is external cephalic
version which reduces the likelihood of
non-vertex presentation births6 without
reducing caesarean sections.7 Methods
based on maternal posture or hypnosis
and relaxation techniques to promote
fetal
version
have
also
been
recom-
mended; they are widely used but their
effectiveness remains unproven.8
The application of heat from the com-
bustion of Artemisia vulgaris (moxibus-
tion) for therapeutic purposes has long
been used in China. Among other effects,
it is believed to contribute to correcting
the non-vertex presentation of the fetus
when applied at a specific acupuncture
point (BL67 Zhiyin) located at the outer
corner of the little toenail.9 10 A recent
meta-analysis11 highlighted the effective-
ness of this technique in comparison with
usual care, reporting a rate of cephalic
version among the moxibustion group of

 72.5% compared with 53.2% in the control group
and a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5 (95% CI 4
to 7). In terms of safety, no significant differences
were found in the moxibustion group compared with
other
techniques.
However,
the
authors
advise
caution in interpreting these results owing to the high
level of heterogeneity among the studies considered.
T
wo
later
studies
have
reported
conflicting
results,12 13 and in neither case was there a control
group in which moxibustion was applied to another
non-specific acupuncture point.
The aim of the present study is to assess the effect-
iveness, specificity and safety of additional moxibus-
tion at a specific point compared with additional
moxibustion at a non-specific point and with usual
care alone in pregnant women with non-vertex pres-
entation at the gestational age of 33–35 weeks in
primary healthcare.
METHODS
Study design and participants
This study was a multicentre randomised controlled
trial of the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion
applied
at
a
specific
acupuncture
point
(true
moxibustión) in conjunction with usual care, in com-
parison with moxibustion at a non-specific point
(sham moxibustion) in conjunction with usual care,
and with usual care alone.
The study was carried out at 58 primary healthcare
centres belonging to the Andalusia (Spain) Public
Health System in the provinces of Sevilla, Huelva,
Cádiz and Málaga. In Andalusia, low-risk pregnancy
follow-up is carried out by midwives and general prac-
titioners in primary healthcare.
The study population comprised women in week 32
of gestation who revealed a breech presentation of the
fetus in the third scheduled obstetric ultrasound
examination performed at the hospital. These women
were referred to one of the participating healthcare
centres and invited to participate in the study if the
following inclusion criteria were met: fetus in a non-
cephalic position diagnosed by physical examination
and ultrasound; age at least 18 years; gestational age
33–35 weeks estimated by ultrasound; normal fetal
biometry and no prior treatment with moxibustion to
achieve version of the fetus. The following exclusion
criteria were applied: multiple pregnancy; bone pelvic
defects; previous uterine surgery; fetal malformation
or chromosomal disorder; uterine malformations; risk
of preterm birth (preterm uterine contractions and/or
initial dilatation or shortening of the cervix with a
score of 4 on the Bishop scale); uterine fibroids
>4 cm; tocolytic therapy; and maternal heart or
kidney disease.
All pregnant women who fulfilled the inclusion cri-
teria and did not have any exclusion criteria were
invited to participate and, upon acceptance, they
received information about the study and were invited
to sign the informed consent. Participants were rando-
mised to receive: (1) true moxibustion at point BL67
plus usual care; (2) moxibustion at a non-specific acu-
puncture point (sham moxibustion) plus usual care; or
(3) usual care alone.
Sample size
On the basis of existing documentation, we assumed
there would be a difference of at least 20% in the rate
of cephalic presentations at term between the true
moxibustion group and the usual care alone group.11
For a significance level of 5% and a statistical power
of 90%, 372 women had to be included in the study.
As the sample was calculated for two groups (but in
fact we compared three groups) and because of drop-
outs, we enlarged the sample by 10% so the necessary
sample size was estimated to be 406 women.
Random allocation
Randomisation of the three arms of the study was
centralised and performed by a statistician not other-
wise
involved
in
the
study,
following
a
1 : 1 : 1
scheme in blocks of 12 and stratified by centre. A
pack of envelopes was prepared for each healthcare
centre participating in the study. Each pack contained
12 opaque envelopes, each of which was sealed after
the introduction of a card with the letter correspond-
ing to the group to which the patient was assigned, in
accordance
with
the
software-generated
sequence
(true moxibustion, sham moxibustion or usual care).
After the baseline assessment and the provision of
written informed consent, these sealed and numbered
opaque envelopes were used to assign the participants
to one of the three study groups in sequence. The
midwife collaborating with the study noted on the
card the patient’s number and that of the healthcare
centre.
At
the
end
of
the
study
the
principal
researcher checked each card against the original ran-
domisation list to verify that the participants had
received the treatment assigned. The participants
assigned to the true and sham moxibustion arms were
blinded with regard to the treatment received, as were
the analysts of the results.
Procedures
All the midwives participating in the study took a
10 h training course, given by three physicians who
were specialists in acupuncture and moxibustion with
over 10 years’ clinical experience, and were informed
about the moxibustion technique, sham moxibustion,
usual care and standard criteria for data collection.
True moxibustion
The woman should lie down, face up. Heat is applied
for 20 min by means of a moxa stick (herbal prepar-
ation with Artemisia vulgaris, Huaian Stick Moxa,
Changsha, China) at point BL67 (Zhiyin), close to the
outer angle of the little toenail. The heat is applied

 from a distance of 1.5–3 cm. More details are given in
the study protocol paper.14
Sham moxibustion
This procedure is identical to the moxibustion tech-
nique except that the point stimulated is SP1 (Yinbai),
close to the inner angle of the big toenail, a non-active
one according to the principles of Traditional Chinese
Medicine.
Usual care
In accordance with the clinical practice guidelines of
the Andalusian Public Health System,15 pregnancy
follow-up is shared between the general practitioner
and the midwife who perform a minimum of six
scheduled visits. Obstetric risk is assessed in every
visit, an ultrasound is performed quarterly and a
non-stress cardiotocography is performed in week 40.
If abnormal fetal presentation is confirmed during the
third ultrasound, women receive recommendations
for knee-chest postural management. A caesarean
section is scheduled when non-vertex presentation
confirmed by ultrasound is maintained until the full-
term pregnancy.
The pregnant women assigned to the true and sham
moxibustion groups were blinded with regard to the
type of intervention. Both interventions were applied
at home by a family member. During the first visit
with the midwife, the woman and the person who
was going to apply moxibustion received a practical
demonstration and a learning session. They were
advised to apply the treatment for 20 min a day for
2 weeks, changing from one foot to the other as soon
as the heat became uncomfortable at the point of
application. They were told to suspend treatment and
to consult the midwife if they noticed a change in the
position of the fetus or any adverse effect. They were
given sufficient moxibustion sticks for the whole
course of treatment.
After 2 weeks of treatment, all the women partici-
pating were asked to attend the health centre for an
ultrasound evaluation of the position of the fetus.
Outcome assessment
The primary clinical outcome was cephalic presenta-
tion at birth. Secondary clinical outcomes were ceph-
alic presentation at the conclusion of the treatment
and the mode of birth: caesarean section or vaginal
birth
(spontaneous
cephalic,
assisted
cephalic
or
vaginal breech).
Independent measures
At baseline the following information was obtained:
(1) age, country of origin, educational level; (2) health
measures: height (cm), weight (kg); (3) obstetric-
gynaecological variables: parity, gestational age when
the woman is included in the study, type of presenta-
tion (breech, oblique or transverse), location of the
placenta (anterolateral or posterior); and (4) four
items related to the women’s expectations and confi-
dence in the treatment evaluated on a visual analogue
scale (from 0=totally disagree to 10=totally agree).
During the first visit, fetal and maternal heart rates
were recorded to assess possible adverse effects of the
technique. Data on women’s expectations and confi-
dence in the treatment were collected from those in
the true moxibustion and sham moxibustion groups.
After each home treatment session the following
safety
variables
were
recorded:
fetal
movements,
uterine contractions, maternal pulse and any other
possible adverse effect arising from the treatment.
Finally, a number of other variables related to the
birth were obtained: gestational age at birth, preterm
birth (<37 weeks), sex and weight of the neonate, A
pgar score at 2 and 5 min and any perinatal or mater-
nal complications.
Data collection
Most of the data were recorded from the Pregnant
W
oman’s Health Passport by hospital staff who had no
connection with the study and who therefore were
blinded to the treatment received, from the Child’s
Health Passport and some of them through interview
performed by the midwife. A Data Collection Record
was
elaborated
to
collect
all
this
information.
Therefore, after each home treatment session, the preg-
nant women completed a self-report questionnaire.
Statistical analysis
W
e performed a basal comparative analysis of sociode-
mographic, health and obstetric-gynaecological vari-
ables between the groups using the Student t test and
two-sided χ2 test or non-parametric tests when nor-
mality was not met.
The primary (fetal presentation at birth) and sec-
ondary (cephalic presentation at the conclusion of the
treatment and the mode of birth) clinical outcome
variables
were
analysed
by
intention
to
treat.
Comparison of these variables in both groups was
made using the Student t test and the χ2 test if nor-
mality
was
met.
Otherwise,
a two-sided
Mann–
Whitney test was used. The relative risk (RR), RR
reduction and the NNTwere calculated for true moxi-
bustion versus usual care and for true moxibustion
versus sham moxibustion. The level of statistical sig-
nificance was set at p<0.05 and included the respect-
ive 95% CI. All missing outcomes were computed as
non-vertex presentation as recommended.16
Finally, we performed a multivariate logistic regres-
sion analysis to explore the factors associated with
cephalic presentation at delivery adjusting for poten-
tial confounders. A forward stepwise method was
used with an entry criterion of p<0.05.
Findings with p values <0.05 were deemed statistic-
ally significant. Analysis was performed by a statistician
blinded to the study group. SPSS (V
.17) was used for all
analyses.

 RESULTS
Between April 2008 and December 2010, midwives at
the participating health centres evaluated 524 women
of whom 118 were excluded, so 406 were randomised
(figure 1). The baseline characteristics were similar in
the three groups (table 1). No significant differences
between the true and sham moxibustion groups were
observed with regard to expectations and confidence
in the treatment (table 2).
Cephalic presentation at birth was present in 58.1%
of the women in the true moxibustion group com-
pared with 44.8% of the usual care group (RR 1.29,
95% CI 1.02 to 1.64) and 43.4% of the sham moxi-
bustion group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.70)
(table 3). The RR reduction of the primary outcome
in the true moxibustion group compared with the
usual care group was 29.7% (95% CI 3.1% to 55.2%)
and the NNT was 8 (95% CI 4 to 72). No significant
differences regarding mode of birth were observed
between the groups.
During the treatment period, 29.4% of the women
reported having felt uterine contractions and 14.6%
experienced palpitations. No significant differences
were observed among the groups. Heart rate (mater-
nal and fetal) did not vary in any clinically significant
way during the intervention in any of the groups;
there was an average increase of 1.30 beats/min (95%
CI 0.19 to 2.41) in the maternal heart rate and of
1.02 beats/min (95% CI 0.18 to 2.21) in the fetal
heart rate during the application of moxibustion, both
true and sham. There were no severe adverse effects
during the treatment, although one patient reported a
burn caused during combustion of the moxa and
another discontinued treatment because of abdominal
pain following moxibustion. The most common com-
plaints were gastrointestinal disturbances (heartburn,
nausea and vomiting) (2%), dizziness (1.7%), mild
hypertensive disorders (1.7%), abdominal pain (1.5%)
and fetal hiccups (1.2%), with no significant differ-
ences being observed between the three groups.
Furthermore, no differences were observed in neo-
natal outcomes (weight and sex of the neonate). The
adverse events recorded were 1.5% cord pathology,
1.5%

 contractions, 1.2% premature rupture of the mem-
branes and 0.5% oligohydramnios. None of the neo-
nates had an Apgar score of <7 at 5 min.
In the multivariate model, variables associated with
cephalic presentation at birth were true but not sham
moxibustion, multiparity, being born outside Spain
and fewer gestational weeks at the start of treatment
(table 4).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this randomised trial is
the first to compare supplemented real moxibustion at
a specific acupuncture point with supplemented sham
moxibustion at a non-specific acupuncture point and
with usual care alone for correcting non-vertex pres-
entation of the fetus in pregnant women with a gesta-
tional
age
of
33–35 weeks.
The
probability
of
achieving version of the fetus was found to be 30%
higher when true moxibustion was associated with
usual care than with usual care alone. Thus, it is
necessary to treat eight pregnant women in order to
correct one non-vertex presentation. These results are
consistent with those reported both in our systematic
review11 and in other systematic reviews published
previously,11 17 18 as well as with another recent cost-
effectiveness study.19 T
wo recent studies have reported
conflicting results. Guittier et al12 found no differ-
ences in the proportion of versions among pregnant
women treated with moxibustion and those in the
control group, probably because the gestational age of
these women (34–36 weeks) was higher than in our
study and there was a higher percentage of nulliparous
participants. It is known that higher gestational age
and nulliparity versus lower gestational age and multi-
parity
tend
to
reduce
the
rate
of
spontaneous
version.1 Do et al13 found a trend towards an increase
in cephalic version at delivery for women receiving
moxibustion compared with usual care, but the study
was underpowered to detect statistical differences
between groups.

 Our study confirms the findings of the systematic
review in terms of safety, adding more evidence in
favour of moxibustion as a safe technique for preg-
nant women.11
Regarding the mode of birth, the percentage of cae-
sarean sections diminished in the moxibustion group
(but not significantly), probably due to the lack of
potency, although the influence of the gynaecologist’s
modus operandi cannot be ruled out. The same has
been reported with external cephalic version.7 The
fact that 16.2% of the pregnant women with cephalic
presentation at term needed a caesarean section is in
line with the established prevalence of caesarean sec-
tions in deliveries without complications in Andalusia.20
The main strength of this study is the robustness of
the design used to demonstrate the effectiveness and
safety of moxibustion at a specific point for pregnant
women with non-vertex presentation. W
e developed a
randomised double-blind study with three arms, with
the innovative use of a control group with moxibus-
tion applied at another non-specific point for the
purpose
of
achieving
fetal
version.
The
results
obtained in the sham moxibustion group are very
similar to those for the usual care group, which
demonstrates
the
specific
effect
of
moxibustion
applied to the 67BL point.
Some researchers believe that it is difficult to have a
control group based on the use of a sham technique
in this type of study in view of the participants’ easy
access to information in this respect on the internet.11
However, in our study the level of expectations and
confidence in the technique was similar in the two
groups in which moxibustion was used, and although
the procedure was performed at home and the acu-
puncture point could have been changed, the results
obtained in the sham group lead us to believe this was
not so.
W
e also highlight the reliability of this study and its
multicentre nature (with the participation of 58 health
centres), which enabled us to analyse a heterogeneous
sample
of
pregnant
women.

 presentation at birth) and secondary (version of the
fetus during treatment or days of treatment to obtain
cephalic
version),
are easily measurable and
not
subjective.
No independent effect on version was observed
with respect to the mother’s height, the weight or sex
of the neonate or the location of the placenta, all
factors that we had considered might influence the
outcome. A striking finding was the occurrence of a
reverse gradient between the mother’s educational
level and fetal position at term. Country of origin pre-
sented a similar pattern and, given the high correl-
ation with income level, we consider both variables as
a proxy for social class. This finding, which has also
been mentioned in another study,21 reveals the pres-
ence of social mediators in the incidence of the
problem and in the effectiveness of treatment, which
suggests a possible area of interest for future study.
A notable feature of this study was the high rate of
acceptance of a technique that is uncommon in
W
estern medicine (only 4.2% refused to participate)
and the low voluntary dropout rate (1.23%), which is
in contrast with other studies.21 This circumstance
probably arose because the technique was proposed in
the
context
of primary
healthcare
and
probably
because it was self-administered, under the supervi-
sion of the woman’s regular midwife.
There may have been a selection bias in our study,
which included only pregnant women who requested
treatment
within
the
public
health
system.
The feasibility of this study would have been limited
if private clinics had also been included because of the
difficulty involved in subsequent monitoring of their
patients. However, we believe this possible limitation
was minimal because the coverage and acceptance of
safe
motherhood
programmes
in
the
Andalusian
public health system is almost universal.
A limitation of the study is that the experimental
procedure was applied by a person who was not an
expert. However, given the simplicity of the proced-
ure, which enabled it to be quickly learned, and the
high degree of motivation of the participants who
appreciated the benefits to be obtained from the
success of the technique, we consider the mode of
administration of this experimental technique was
valid. Another limitation is the lack of record of
adherence to any of the study interventions, which
could be a confounding factor.
The results suggest two areas that should be consid-
ered immediately for further research. The first con-
cerns the best gestational age at which treatment
should be started. Some authors suggest between
weeks 32 and 37,12 21–23 while others do not apply it
after week 35 due to the theoretical risk of inducing
contractions leading to premature delivery.24 There is
no empirical basis for either claim. Our data suggest
that the application of the technique is not associated
with premature birth. The data also suggest that, the
earlier the treatment is begun the more effective it is,
although we only compared weeks 33–35 and further
purpose-designed studies are needed to confirm this
hypothesis.
The second question to be considered is whether
the application of heat to acupuncture point BL67 by
processes other than moxibustion would be equally
effective in obtaining version of the fetus. It has been
reported that the infrared radiation intensity produced
by a traditional moxa stick is different from that pro-
duced by other sources of radiation.25 W
e do not
know if a simple device to apply heat at this point,
controlling heat intensity and duration, would have
the same effects as Artemisia moxa. If this were so,
the treatment process would be less cumbersome and
its use could be more readily generalised.
Summary points
▸
We randomised 406 pregnant women with breech
presentation to three groups.
▸
At term, vertex presentations were 58% for moxa at BL67,
43% for moxa at sham SP1 and 45% for usual care.
CONCLUSIONS
W
e conclude that moxibustion at acupuncture point
BL67 is effective and safe to correct non-vertex pres-
entation when used between 32 and 34 weeks of ges-
tation. Moxibustion is well-accepted by women and
the straightforward nature of the procedure means it
can be easily applied at home. Moxibustion therefore
represents a treatment option that should be consid-
ered to achieve version of the non-vertex fetus.
