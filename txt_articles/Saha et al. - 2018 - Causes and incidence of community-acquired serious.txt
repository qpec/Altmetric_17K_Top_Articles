Summary
Background More than 500 000 neonatal deaths per year result from possible serious bacterial infections (pSBIs), but 
the causes are largely unknown. We investigated the incidence of community-acquired infections caused by specific 
organisms among neonates in south Asia.
Methods From 2011 to 2014, we identified babies through population-based pregnancy surveillance at five sites in 
Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Babies were visited at home by community health workers up to ten times from age 
0 to 59 days. Illness meeting the WHO definition of pSBI and randomly selected healthy babies were referred to study 
physicians. The primary objective was to estimate proportions of specific infectious causes by blood culture and 
Custom TaqMan Array Cards molecular assay (Thermo Fisher, Bartlesville, OK, USA) of blood and respiratory 
samples. 
Findings 6022 pSBI episodes were identified among 63 114 babies (95·4 per 1000 livebirths). Causes were attributed in 
28% of episodes (16% bacterial and 12% viral). Mean incidence of bacterial infections was 13·2 (95% credible interval [CrI] 
11·2–15·6) per 1000 livebirths and of viral infections was 10·1 (9·4–11·6) per 1000 livebirths. The leading pathogen 
was respiratory syncytial virus (5·4, 95% CrI 4·8–6·3 episodes per 1000 livebirths), followed by Ureaplasma spp 
(2·4, 1·6–3·2 episodes per 1000 livebirths). Among babies who died, causes were attributed to 46% of pSBI episodes, 
among which 92% were bacterial. 85 (83%) of 102 blood culture isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, 
gentamicin, or a combination of these drugs.
Interpretation Non-attribution of a cause in a high proportion of patients suggests that a substantial proportion of 
pSBI episodes might not have been due to infection. The predominance of bacterial causes among babies who died, 
however, indicates that appropriate prevention measures and management could substantially affect neonatal 
mortality. Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to first-line antibiotics emphasises the need for prudent and limited use 
of newer-generation antibiotics. Furthermore, the predominance of atypical bacteria we found and high incidence of 
respiratory syncytial virus indicated that changes in management strategies for treatment and prevention are needed. 
Given the burden of disease, prevention of respiratory syncytial virus would have a notable effect on the overall health 
system and achievement of Sustainable Development Goal.

Introduction
The Millennium Development Goals led to reductions in 
deaths among children younger than 5 years by 56%, from 
12·7 million in 1990 to 5·6 million, in 2016 worldwide.1 In 
south Asia the reduction was 64%, from 4·8 million 
to 1·7 million, but the percentage of neonatal deaths 
increased from 45% in 1990 to 59% in 2016.
The main causes of neonatal deaths in low-income 
and middle-income countries are prematurity, intra-
partum-related events, severe infections, and congenital 
anomalies.1–3 
Severe 
infections, 
including 
sepsis, 
meningitis, and pneumonia, are estimated to cause 
about a third of the 2·6 million neonatal deaths globally 
or often lead to long-term disabilities.4 Pre 
vention of 
neonatal infections will be necessary to achieve 
Sustainable Development Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives 
and promote wellbeing for all at all ages) and the 
objectives of the Every Woman Every Child initiative.5,6 
Although neonatal illness is commonly referred to as 
possible serious bacterial infection (pSBI), the causes

remain largely unknown,7,8 which is an important 
impediment to the design of effective prevention and 
management programmes.
Few data are available on the annual number of pSBI 
episodes in south Asia, despite this region having 
the highest number worldwide (3·5 million).2,9 Deter-
mination of the causes of pSBI in neonates has 
depended on isolation of bacteria by blood culture, 
which is deemed to be the gold standard test despite 
poor sensitivity. Two outpatient-based WHO studies 
done in multiple countries and a population-based 
study done in low-income and middle-income countries 
yielded bacterial isolates from less than 10% of babies 
with pSBI.10–12 A study in India showed 10% positivity by 
blood culture, with organisms being predominantly 
Gram-negative (69%).13 A study in Bangladesh examined 
62 respiratory samples and found a high burden of viral 
infections (48%).14
Ascertainment of the causes of pSBI has been hindered 
by several factors: difficulty in case finding (ie, many 
babies born at home die soon after birth without entering 
the formal health system); insufficient availability of 
diagnostic tools to detect bacterial and viral causes; 
collection of blood samples with inadequate volume, 
frequent contamination of blood cultures, or both; lack of 
parallel samples from healthy controls and assessments 
by sensitive molecular methods to provide information 
on background colonisation by pSBI pathogens; and 
absence of appropriate analytical approaches to use 
information from multiple types of tests and samples to 
attribute cause. To address these gaps in knowledge, we 
did the Aetiology of Neonatal Infections in South Asia 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Millennium Development Goals reinforced the global 
commitment to improve child survival and have led to 
mortality in children younger than 5 years being lowered by 
56% from 12·7 million in 1990 to 5·6 million in 2016. In 
south Asian countries, mortality in this age group has been 
reduced by 64%, from 4·8 million to 1·7 million. Neonatal 
mortality, however, increased from 45% to 59% between 
1990 and 2017. We searched PubMed and Ovid, without date 
restrictions, with 51 combinations of the keywords “neonatal 
infections”, “South Asia”, “sepsis”, “young infant”, “etiology”, 
“low income countries”, “clinical algorithm”, and “surveillance”. 
This search yielded 317 references that were relevant to our 
research questions. The main causes of neonatal deaths seem 
to be prematurity, intrapartum complications, severe 
infection, and congenital anomalies. Severe infection is 
addressed by treatment and prevention policies focused on 
clean delivery at birth, breastfeeding, appropriate antibiotic 
therapy for ill babies, and vaccination. Nevertheless, the causes 
of most possible serious bacterial infections (pSBIs) remain 
elusive. In 2012, an estimated 6·9 million neonates worldwide 
met the WHO definition for pSBI—ie, referral to hospital and 
antibiotic treatment—although in studies bacteria have been 
detected by culture in only 5–10% of samples. Information 
about viral causes of illness is even scarcer. Treatment remains 
mostly empirical, particularly in developing countries, where 
most data on antimicrobial resistance derive from hospital-
acquired infections. Given the gap in knowledge about causes 
of pSBI in neonates and the widespread use of treatment with 
antibiotics, multidrug resistance is a concern. Few studies have 
included neonates, and even fewer babies on the day of birth, 
when most neonatal deaths occur. Moreover, studies in 
low-income and middle-income countries have mostly been 
hospital based and enrolled babies with pSBI who were seeking 
health care. In many parts of south Asia, home births are still 
common and seeking care in the days after birth is rare, even 
when referred by a community health worker.
Added value of this study
We designed the ANISA study to assess unanswered questions 
specifically in developing countries, in a large sample of 
pregnant women and babies, by testing blood and respiratory 
samples from those with symptoms and from healthy 
controls. We generated population-based evidence on the 
causes of pSBI through community-wide pregnancy 
surveillance and enrolment of babies born at home and in 
health facilities. We included areas with high child mortality 
and those with state-of-the-art diagnostic services. Stringent 
protocols were put in place to minimise blood-culture 
contamination and an external expert panel confirmed 
classifications of blood culture isolates. As well as blood 
culture, we incorporated molecular testing in almost 
2000 healthy babies and used an innovative partially latent 
class model to attribute causes to pSBI.
Implications of all the available evidence
The list of causal bacteria we identified was long and diverse, 
making prevention and treatment strategies complex. 
Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading causal organism in 
our study, suggesting an opportunity to develop 
interventions based on maternal immunisation and provision 
of monoclonal antibodies to neonates. Ureaplasma spp had 
the second leading causal proportion, but have not previously 
been recognised as common except in very preterm babies, 
and are not targeted by current recommended antibiotic 
regimens. Research into the epidemiology and pathogenesis 
of this group of bacteria in neonates is needed. Despite 
testing of blood and respiratory samples, for 72% of pSBI 
episodes, no cause could be attributed. Use of metagenomics 
approaches, minimally invasive tissue sampling, or both, to 
investigate causes, with consideration of factors unrelated to 
infections might facilitate appropriate decisions and 
investments to save lives among very young babies, limit 
unnecessary antibiotic use, and curb the emergence of 
antimicrobial resistance in the community.

(ANISA) study in three countries (Bangladesh, India, 
and Pakistan) to investigate the incidence of pSBI 
episodes in the first 2 months of life and estimate the 
proportions of bacterial and viral causes.
Methods
Study design and participants
ANISA was an observational cohort study done in 
five sites in three countries. Four sites were rural (Sylhet, 
Bangladesh; Matiari, Pakistan; and Vellore and Odisha, 
India) and one was urban (Karachi, Pakistan). These sites 
covered a total population of around 1·6 million people, 
including roughly 250 000 married girls and women of 
reproductive age (13–49 years) and around 30 000 births 
per year.15 Eligible participants were married women of 
reproductive age and live babies that could be enrolled up 
to age 7 days. 
We obtained informed verbal consent from pregnant 
girls and women when they were registered in the study 
and written informed consent when samples were 
collected from babies. The study was approved by the 
ethics committees or internal review boards of all 
participating organisations. 
Community-based surveillance
We recruited community health workers (CHWs) from 
the local area through open advertisements. CHWs 
established active community-based surveillance for 
pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and signs of illness in 
neonates. Briefly, they followed up married girls and 
women of reproductive age by home visits to identify 
pregnancies. They recorded dates of last menstrual 
period, facilitated or encouraged accessing of antenatal 
care, built rapport, and arranged visits to assess neo-
nates immediately after birth. Live neonates visited by 
CHWs within 7 days of birth were registered in the 
study and scheduled for up to ten home visits up to age 
59 days, three week 1 and one per week thereafter. 
CHWs also collected socioeconomic, household, and 
maternal information at enrolment and information on 
labour and delivery at the first visit after birth.
Babies were assessed at every visit for signs of illness, 
defined as respiratory rate 60 breaths per min or more, 
severe chest in-drawing, hypothermia (temperature 
<35·5°C), 
hyperthermia 
(temperature 
≥38·0°C), 
movement only with stimulation, convulsions, and poor 
feeding as reported by the mother and confirmed by 
CHW assessment.15 Babies with one or more signs of 
pSBI were referred by the CHWs to study-designated 
health-care facilities or visited at home by a study 
physician (only in Matiari, Pakistan). To capture illness 
episodes that occurred between visits, family members 
were encouraged to seek assessment at a study health 
facility or via the outreach physician (in Matiari). Ill 
babies in Bangladesh and Pakistan were examined and 
managed at primary care facilities or, if they had severe 
or complicated illness, were referred to tertiary-level 
hospitals. All ill babies in India were assessed and 
managed at tertiary-level hospitals.
Collection of samples
Sample collection has previously been described in 
detail.16 Briefly, trained phlebotomists followed standard-
ised protocols to collect up to 3 mL blood from babies 
with pSBI episodes for culture and molecular testing. 
1 mL blood samples were taken from healthy controls for 
molecular testing. Strict procedures to minimise 
contamination during phlebotomy were followed: use of 
sterile hand gloves and disposible dignity sheets for 
babies; regular cleaning of the phlebotomy room with 
disinfectant; and systematic use of antiseptic (alcohol 
and iodine). Physicians used flocked swabs (Copan 
Diagnostics, Brescia, Italy) to collect naso 
pharyngeal 
and oro 
pharyngeal samples at the health centre from 
symptomatic babies who met the criteria for pSBI and 
from healthy babies when scheduled by the study team. 
To characterise the background presence of potential 
pSBI pathogens in the community, we used an automated 
algorithm triggered by CHWs at the first postnatal visit to 
select randomly registered healthy babies for collection of 
samples. These babies were assigned an age at which to 
undergo clinical assessment and sample collection, with 
assignment probability based on the age distribution of 
babies with pSBI episodes enrolled to that point.
Processing of samples
We used automated blood culture (culture media 
BacTec, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA or BacT/Alert, 
Biomérieux, Basinstoke, UK) to isolate bacterial 
pathogens. Molecular testing was done by PCR 
with Custom TaqMan Array Cards (Thermo Fisher, 
Bartlesville, OK, USA) and LifeTech Viia 7 software 
version 1.2.4 to detect 15 bacterial and 13 viral 
pathogens.15,17 Bacterial strains from the cultures were 
identified with a conventional biochemical test and the 
API 20E strip test (bioMérieux-Vitek, Hazelwood, MO, 
USA), and were confirmed at the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention by matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry.18 
Anti 
microbial susceptibility testing was done by disc 
diffusion, in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute guidelines. We used a MagNA Pure 
LC total nucleic acid isolation kit (Roche, Basel, 
Switzerland) to extract nucleic acid from blood samples 
and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for 
assessment. 
Three infectious disease specialists reviewed and 
classified each isolate as a pathogen or as not clinically 
relevant, based on the clinical features of the patient, drug 
susceptibility, illness management, and outcome.19 10% of 
molecular samples were retested at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention to provide quality control 
and assurance for site results (appendix). As an additional 
assessment, we used real-time PCR for speciation of

Bordetella spp and Ureaplasma spp and confirmation of 
Escherichia coli positivity. 
Definition of pSBI episodes
We defined confirmed pSBI episodes as the presence 
of one sign of illness assessed by the CHWs, no 
hospital admission in the preceding 7 days (except for 
postnatal hospital stays for babies born in health 
facilities), and no registered pSBI episode in the 
preceding 7 days. We excluded babies with increased 
respiratory rate as the only sign because, during the 
study period, independent evidence showed low 
specificity for this sign alone20 and samples were not 
collected in several sites. Test results for samples from 
healthy babies were included if the criteria for pSBI 
were not met on the day of assessment or in the 
previous 7 days before and after sample collection.
Statistical analysis
We aimed to enrol 400 healthy babies in each site in 
Bangladesh and Pakistan and 200 in each Indian site.21 
The sample size was constrained by ethical and 
community acceptability, but we calculated that the 
target sample size would be sufficient to provide initial 
estimation of background colonisation with set false-
positive rates (appendix) and a maximum SE of 3%.
The primary objective was to estimate the proportion 
of pSBI episodes attributed to each pathogen assessed. 
Because the study design included two types of sample 
(blood and respiratory), up to three tests per pathogen 
(blood culture, blood molecular assay, and respiratory 
molecular assay), and because each of these tests had 
its own sensitivity and specificity for detection of the 
true cause of the pSBI episode, we used a partially 
latent class model, which was originally developed for a 
similarly designed study of the causes of pneumonia22 
and adapted to meet the ANISA study specifications 
(appendix). For all babies with pSBI episodes and 
healthy babies with at least one laboratory test result, 
we included blood culture final determination data (for 
those with pSBI episodes) and observed binary 
molecular assay results (positive or negative) in the 
model input dataset. We attributed causal proportions 
to 28 target pathogens and two additional classes: other 
blood culture (all organisms isolated from blood 
cultures that did not have an associated pathogen-
specific molecular assay test) and other or none 
(episodes that could not be attributed to any pathogens).
The primary output of the model was mean pathogen 
proportions at the population level with 95% credible 
intervals (CrIs), from which individual-level proportions 
could be derived (appendix). Covariates were study site, 
age at onset, date of enrolment, and outcome status (died 
but had a sample available from the previous 7 days vs 
alive, except for Vellore, where there were too few deaths 
to stratify by outcome). We ran the model under various 
input dataset conditions, for which performance was 
assessed by simulation studies (appendix). Model 
convergence was assessed through trace and other 
diagnosis plots. We assessed model assumptions with 
interim model outputs by stopping the Gibbs sampler at 
random cycles. Model fit to input data was evaluated by 
comparing the fitted and observed numbers of positives 
for each blood molecular assay and blood culture. We did 
programming and computation with R (version 3.2.5), 
SAS (version 9.3), and Stata (version 13). 
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had access to all 
data in the study and had responsibility for the decision 
to submit for publication.
Results 
During surveillance, pregnancy outcome data were 
collected for 74 145 (87%) of 84 971 pregnancies. 71 361 were 
livebirths, 2324 were stillbirths, and 1283 were mis-
carriages. 63 114 (88%) liveborn babies were regis 
tered and 
followed up for 59 days, and the remaining 8247 babies 
could not be reached within 7 days, due to death, migration 
out of the area, or refusal to participate in the study 
(figure 1, appendix). 56 960 (90%) liveborn neonates 
were recruited within 72 h. Population character 
istics, 
in particular socioeconomic status, home delivery, preg-
nancy outcomes, and early death among babies, varied by 
site (table 1). 43 665 (69%) registered babies received all 
three visits in the first week, and 48 415 (77%) received at 
least eight of ten scheduled visits by CHWs. These visits 
resulted in 12 836 referrals for clinical assessment by 
physicians, of which 10 809 (84%) were attended. 
Caregivers made 3683 additional self-referrals.
Physicians identified 6022 pSBI episodes, including 
2498 early-onset (<3 days) and 3524 late-onset episodes 
(3–59 days). 289 (5%) babies had more than one episode 
(figure 1, table 2, appendix). The overall pSBI incidence 
was 95·4 episodes per 1000 livebirths (range 78·3 per 
1000 in Vellore, India, to 112·6 per 1000 in Karachi, 
Pakistan) and was notably higher in the first 3 days of life 
than in the remaining follow-up period (55·8 per 
1000 livebirths vs 39·6 per 1000 livebirths), which is 
equivalent to an increase in incidence density rate of 
roughly 13·5 times.
Blood samples were collected from 4859 (81%) of 
6022 babies during pSBI episodes, of which all were tested 
by blood culture and 4216 (70%) were tested by molecular 
assay (figure 1). 602 (10%) babies had received antibiotics 
before blood samples were collected, mainly in Matiari, 
Pakistan (439 [73%]). Molecular test results for respiratory 
samples were available for 5209 (87%) of 6022 babies with 
pSBI episodes. We also collected 1726 blood samples 
(results available for 1717) and 1893 respiratory samples 
from 1895 healthy babies for molecular testing (figure 1). 
Healthy babies were older than sick children at the time of

sample collection (median age 13·4 days, IQR 2·8–33·8 vs 
5·7 days, 1·4–27·4) and cumulative enrolment of controls 
did not always track pSBI episodes (appendix).
Of 4859 pSBI blood cultures, 338 (7%) yielded bacteria, 
of which 206 were judged not to be clinically relevant 
based on predefined criteria, 30 not to be clinically 
relevant by an independent review panel, and 102 to be 
clinically relevant. The incidence of culture-confirmed 
infection was 1·6 per 1000 livebirths. Causal organisms 
in blood cultures were predominately E coli, Klebsiella spp, 
Staphylococcus aureus, and group A streptococcus. More 
than half of causal bacteria were Gram negative, led by 
Klebsiella spp and E coli (table 3), and incidence of Gram-
negative organisms was higher among hospital-born 
babies than in community-born babies (1·3 per 
1000 livebirths vs 0·7 per 1000 livebirths). Most isolates 
were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, gentamicin, or 
a combination of these drugs (table 3). Isolates were 
more susceptible to gentamicin (75 [74%]) than ampicillin 
or penicillin (27 [41%]).
Among pSBI blood samples tested by molecular assay, 
487 (12%) of 4216 tested positive for at least one target, 
led by enterovirus or rhinovirus, Salmonella spp, Klebsiella 
spp, and E coli, and 57 (1%) were positive for multiple 
targets. Among 5209 respiratory samples 3907 (75%) were 
positive for at least one target and 1302 (47%) were 
positive for multiple targets (table 4). The numbers 
of positive results were similar for blood and respiratory 
samples from healthy babies, with some variation by site, 
age, and outcome (table 4, appendix). Pathogens were 
more prevalent among babies with pSBI than among 
healthy babies, including for respiratory syncytial virus 
and Ureaplasma spp (table 4). Among 566 samples 
containing Ureaplasma spp, 311 (55%) were U parvum, 
255 (45%) were U urealyticum, and the remainder 
contained both species. Bordetella spp were detected in 
similar proportions of babies with pSBI and healthy 
babies, with most samples containing these species seen 
in Karachi, Pakistan (table 4). Speciation of Bordetella spp 
revealed that 84 (36%) of 234 samples from babies with 
pSBI and 30 (41%) of 73 from healthy babies contained 
B pertussis.
The estimated test-specific true-positive and false-positive 
rates underlying the model-based proportions of causal 
organisms and the estimated incidence are shown in the 
appendix. Overall, 16% and 12% of pSBI episodes were 
attributed to bacteria and viruses, respectively, and the 
remaining 72% could not be attributed to any of the tested 
pathogens. The leading pathogen was respiratory syncytial 
virus, seen in 6·5% of cases (95% CrI 5·8–7·6), followed by 
Ureaplasma spp, seen in 2·8% (1·9–3·8; figure 2). Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, E coli, enterovirus or rhinovirus, Salmonella 
spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, and 
S aureus were each attributed as the causal agent in more 
than 1·0% of pSBI episodes (figure 2). Attribution of cause 
to a specific pathogen was less likely among early-onset 
than among late-onset episodes (22·5%, 95% CrI

Salmonella spp, S aureus, and respiratory syncytial virus all 
had proportion point estimates greater than 1·0% (figure 2). 
Among late-onset episodes, the proportion attributed to 
viruses was 16·5%, similar to that attributed to bacteria 
(16·6%) and were predominantly respiratory syncytial 
virus (9·1%, 95% CrI 7·7–10·9) and Ureaplasma spp 
(2·5%, 1·6–3·4; figure 2). Attribution of bacterial causes 
differed by site: the leading bacterial causes were 
S pneumoniae in Sylhet (2·6% of episodes, 95% CrI 
1·4–4·7), Ureaplasma spp in Matiari (5·3%, 3·0–7·4), and 
Klebsiella spp in Odisha (7·2%, 4·4–7·2; figure 2). 
Respiratory syncytial virus was the leading viral cause in all 
sites (figure 2).
The overall incidence of bacterial infections was 
13·2 (95% CrI 11·2–15·6) per 1000 livebirths (table 5). 
For Ureaplasma spp, the overall incidence was 
2·4 (95% CrI 1·6–3·2) per 1000 livebirths, with the 
highest incidence seen in Matiari. K pneumoniae was the

next leading pathogen, for which the highest incidence 
was in Odisha. Incidence of E coli varied little across sites 
and S aureus was a rare cause except in the Indian sites, 
where incidence was greater than 2·0 per 1000 livebirths 
(table 5).
The overall incidence of viral infections was 
10·1 (95% CrI 9·4–11·6) per 1000 livebirths (range across 
sites 5·5–15·7 per 1000 livebirths, table 5). The incidence 
of respiratory syncytial virus was greater than 2·5 per 
1000 livebirths in all sites, peaking in Sylhet 
(7·3 infections per 1000 livebirths). For all other viruses, 
the incidence was 1·1 per 1000 livebirths or lower, with 
site-specific variations (table 5).
Overall, among 71 361 livebirths, 3061 (4%) babies died 
before age 60 days (range 11 per 1000 livebirths in Vellore 
to 57 per 1000 livebirths in Matiari; overall mortality 
42·9 per 1000 livebirths). 1377 (45%) of these 3061 deaths 
occurred among non-registered babies (1284 within 
7 days and 93 after 7 days) and 1684 (55%) among 
registered babies. Among 1377 babies who were not 
visited by a CHW before death, 941 (68%) died within 
24 h of birth (median age 6·1 h, appendix). Mortality 
among 
registered 
babies 
was 
26·7 
deaths 
per 
1000 livebirths, which was 7·4 (95% CrI 6·7–8·1) times 
higher among babies with pSBI than among healthy 
babies (125·0 vs 16·9 per 1000 livebirths). Among the 
1684 registered babies who died, 689 (41%) were assessed 
by a physician before death and pSBI was confirmed. 
Samples were collected from 349 (49%) of these 
confirmed episodes in the 7 days before death (appendix). 
Among 102 babies with confirmed episodes who died 
within 24 h of birth, 37 (36%) had samples collected.
Causal pathogen attributions were made in sub-
stantially more babies with pSBI episodes who died than 
among those who survived (46%, 95% CrI 37–56 vs 27%, 
24–30). Of the deaths among babies with pSBI episodes 
with attributed pathogens, 92% were due to bacteria, led 
by E coli (causal proportion 8·7%, 95% CrI 5·2–13·4)

and Ureaplasma spp (8·3%, 4·1–12·3; figure 3). Other 
pathogens that were over-represented among babies 
with pSBI who died compared with among those who 
survived were K pneumoniae, S pneumoniae, group B 
streptococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (figure 3). 
In contrast, the proportion attributed to respiratory 
syncytial virus was greater among babies who died than 
among those who survived (2·1%, 95% CrI 1·3–3·2 vs 
6·7%, 5·9–7·8).
Given these differences in pathogen distributions 
between babies who died and those who survived and 
the low capture of samples within 7 days of life 
(11·6% of deaths), we did a sensitivity analysis to 
ascertain the potential effect on the overall distribution 
of causal organisms. Specifically, we assumed that the 
pathogens among missed deaths were distributed 
equivalently to those among deaths with laboratory 
results in the most extreme scenario (100% of deaths 
fulfilling the pSBI definition). The overall pathogen 
prevalence distribution in ANISA did not change 
markedly, with the pathogen proportion attributed to

Discussion
With neonatal deaths fast becoming predominant 
among deaths in children younger than 5 years, we 
aimed with the ANISA study to use state-of-the-art 
microbiology techniques and computational modelling 
in one of the largest community-based studies of its kind 
to bridge major knowledge gaps and improve estimates 
of incidence of neonatal infections and their causes in 
south Asia, where 36% of all neonatal deaths occur. 
Although causal attribution among babies with pSBI in 
our cohort of over 63 000 livebirths was low (28%) 
because of the highly sensitive clinical algorithm we 
used, we found that bacterial causes predominated over 
viral causes. Even more importantly, ANISA captured 
data on pathogens associated with pSBI deaths, 
indicating that a cause could be attributed in 46% of 
deaths, among which most (92%) were bacterial.
The incidence of culture-confirmed bacterial pSBI 
episodes was 1·6 per 1000 livebirths, which was lower 
than previously reported incidence in south Asia (3·0 per 
1000 livebirths in Mirzapur, Bangladesh,12 and 6·7 per 
1000 livebirths in Odisha, India13). A study in Africa 
reported incidence of 5·5 per 1000 livebirths for bacterial 
infections among neonates.23 The low frequency of 
culture-confirmed pSBI episodes in ANISA might have 
stemmed partly from efforts to minimise inclusion of 
isolates that were not clinically relevant, strategies to 
minimise contamination of samples, and expert review 
of positive cultures. Use of the molecular assays and 
modelling to attribute causes, however, indicated a 
higher proportion of bacterial causes than reported in 
previous studies.
Among bacterial causes, Ureaplasma spp predominated, 
particularly during the first 3 days of life and among 
babies with pSBI who died. The role of this atypical 
bacterium as a cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality 
is not well understood because it does not grow under 
conventional culture methods. Previous associations of 
Ureaplasma spp with adverse outcomes in mothers 
(chorioamnionitis and extreme preterm delivery) and 
neonates (prematurity, sepsis or meningitis, and 
pulmonary 
and 
cerebral 
morbidity) 
have 
been 
documented, as have pSBI episodes in neonates due to 
U parvum and U urealyticum.6,24 Common empirical 
treatment with β-lactams or cephalosporins is not 
effective against Ureaplasma spp due to the lack of a cell 
wall.25 Future studies using various methods are needed 
to characterise the pathogenic role of Ureaplasma spp in 
babies and guide treatment policies.
Over half of bacteria identified as causing pSBI were 
Gram negative, particularly Klebsiella spp and E coli. 
These bacteria ranked among the top pathogens resulting 
in death among babies with pSBI episodes and were 
present in all study sites. Blood culture analysis revealed 
higher incidence of Gram-negative organisms among 
hospital-born babies than among community-born 
babies. These findings are consistent with those in 
previous studies from south Asia.8,13 The prevalence of 
Gram-negative organisms in the environment and on the 
body surface of neonates in south Asia might be the 
source of these infections.26,27
In concordance with previous data from south Asia, 
the incidence of pSBI episodes caused by group B 
streptococcus was lower than that reported in Africa.28,29 
Attribution was, however, more than 3·7 times more 
likely among babies with pSBI who died than among 
survivors, and 1·8 times more likely among babies with 
early-onset illness than among those with late-onset 
illness. These findings suggest that the burden of 
group B streptococcus might be underestimated because 
of the challenges in capturing samples after early death. 
A study done in Bangladesh at the same site as ANISA 
showed that mortality was increased by 6·6 times among 
neonates with group B streptococcus colonisation of the

umbilical cord stump.30 Further investigations of early 
deaths and a maternal vaccine probe study will be crucial 
to understanding the true burden of group B 
streptococcus among babies in south Asia.
We collected 349 samples from babies who died, which 
exceeds the number of samples obtained from babies 
after pSBI-associated deaths in previous studies, yet still 
represents only a small proportion of all deaths in the 
ANISA catchment areas, despite intensive efforts. This 
notable limitation stemmed from the high frequency of 
early deaths. 68% of deaths among non-registered babies 
occurred within 24 h of birth (median age 6·1 h), among 
whom over a quarter died in the first hour of life 
(appendix). The challenge of reaching babies before 
death also translates into challenges for the treatment 
and prevention of illnesses in at-risk babies. Among 
those who had pSBI episodes and died, the causative 
bacteria were diverse (>25 species within 19 genera), 
complicating development of empirical treatment and 
prevention strategies. Furthermore, antibiotic therapy 
might be given too late to be effective, particularly for 
births outside health facilities. Maternal immunisation 
has the potential to protect fetuses and neonates from 
infection, but maternal vaccines are not available for any 
of the leading organisms associated with pSBI deaths. 
Interventions such as use of a clean delivery kit at birth 
might prevent some early deaths due to infection.
The predominant role of respiratory syncytial virus 
(5·4 per 1000 livebirths) among viral causes of pSBI in 
the first 2 months of life is consistent with previous 
studies in neonates in Bangladesh and Nepal.14,31 Among 
babies who had pSBI and died in this study, respiratory 
syncytial virus ranked sixth. Respiratory syncytial virus 
further stresses under-resourced health systems where 
the numbers of hospital beds are small and patients need 
continuous care for common sequelae, such as recurrent 
wheeze and asthma. The contribution in this study of 
respiratory syncytial virus to pSBI, even in the first days 
of life, suggests a specific opportunity to intervene and 
prevent deaths and morbidity through maternal 
immunisation, administration of monoclonal antibodies 
to neonates, or both, which are looking likely to become 
available options.32,33
Our findings should be considered within the context of 
some limitations. First, despite using highly sensitive 
diagnostic methods, we could not identify causes in most 
(72%) pSBI episodes, and more than half (54%) of fatal 
pSBI episodes. The reasons for these outcomes are multi-
factorial. First, a subset of episodes could have had 
causative agents beyond the 28 prioritised by the expert 
panel. The unexpected finding of Ureaplasma spp as 
leading causes indicates that organisms that are not 
generally judged to be the most common might have 
important roles. Genomic analyses have shown that many 
bacterial species can only be detected by culture-indepen-
dent approaches.34,35 With advances in metagenomics, the 
biobank of the ANISA study will provide an opportunity to 
probe for additional organisms. Second, ANISA only 
captured blood and respiratory samples. Although 
cerebrospinal fluid collection was attempted, very few 
samples were obtained. We did not try to collect samples 
from other sterile sites, such as lung aspirates or urine, or 
peripheral sites other than the nasopharynx and 
oropharynx. Third, collection of blood and respiratory 
samples from healthy babies in the first days of life was 
challenging due to difficulties in early birth capture and 
community acceptability. Thus, samples from healthy 
babies were skewed towards older babies who might have 
had more time to acquire organisms from the 
environment. Overestimation of background presence of 
potential pSBI organisms would, therefore, have 
underestimated causal attribution. Fourth, we used 
WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness 
algorithm to define pSBI, but this approach emphasises 
sensitivity at the cost of specificity.36,37 The standard clinical 
signs of pSBI also overlap with those of intrapartum-
related events and other non-infectious causes of neonatal 
mortality, making it unlikely that all pSBI episodes are of 
infectious origin. Our findings lend support to the 
prediction of Mulholland and colleagues38 that only a 
limited proportion of babies with pSBI actually have 
illnesses of bacterial origin. Moreover, poor specificity 
could explain the results of other studies in which 
standard and simplified antibiotic regimens (ranging 
from 14 to two injections and first-line oral antibiotics) 
were equally effective.39–41 We found that 83% of the true 
bacterial isolates from pSBI were sensitive to first-line 
antibiotics, which suggests that widespread antimicrobial 
resistance is not yet deeply rooted in the community.
ANISA has opened several avenues for further 
exploration that might uncover new strategies for 
improving 
survival 
among 
babies 
and 
achieving 
Sustainable Development Goal 3. These include application 
of the latest metagenomic approaches for improved 
characterisation of causal organisms in samples; the role of 
Ureaplasma spp, for which studies should be designed to 
elucidate management policies; assessment of maternal 
immunisation against respiratory syncytial virus infection; 
identification of ways to differentiate infectious from non-
infectious pSBI (eg, with biomarkers or distinct clinical 
signs, metagenomics approaches, and minimally invasive 
tissue sampling42); and investigation of factors unrelated to 
infection that cause pSBI. Low antibiotic resistance across 
south Asian communities provides an incentive to limit 
unnecessary antibiotic use to prevent emergence of 
antimicrobial resistance.
