HIGHLIGHTS
�
Deployment of the Liquid Biopsy System into
normal coronary arteries and its use to take 4
simultaneous blood samples at equal spaces
along a 10-cm length was shown tobe feasible
and safe in patients undergoing angioplasty.
No gradients of the 92 biomolecules chosen
for multiplexed analysis were observed.
�
By contrast, stable and disrupted plaques
showed biomolecule gradients along the
samplinglength, which impliedthat substances
were being released from plaques into the
boundary layer and flowing blood that was
coursing over them. Gradients of molecules
likely to be derived from the endothelium
overlying plaques, especially the oxidized LDL
receptor (OLR1; also known as LOX-1) and
inflammatory mediators, were detected,
consistent with the inflammatory status of
endothelium previously defined by ex vivo and
postmortem studies.
�
After angioplasty, some molecular gradients
persisted,but release of additionalsubstances
was observed, perhaps most interestingly,
matrix metalloproteinase-12, which had been
localized previously to the core of vulnerable
plaques and associated with subsequent un-
stable presentation.
�
These experiments establish the feasibility and
potential of the Liquid Biopsy System. This new
methodology is flexible enough to be used in
conjunction with high-content analyses for the
definitionofprognosticbiomarkersorbiomarker
combinations and for the development of
surrogate endpoints in clinical intervention
studies aimed at reducing plaque vulnerability
and preventing acute coronary syndromes.

 SUMMARY
A percutaneous catheter device, the Liquid Biopsy System, was developed to sample the unstirred
boundary layer of blood upstream and downstream of intact and disrupted human coronary atherosclerotic
plaques. Using multiplexed proximity extension assays, release of 20 biomolecules was simultaneously detected
in samples taken across plaques before balloon angioplasty, including the soluble form of the endothelial
lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor. Additional biomolecules, including matrix metalloproteinase-12, were released
after plaque disruption with angioplasty. These experiments demonstrate the power of the Liquid Biopsy System
to yield new scientific insights and its ultimate potential to generate new biomarkers and surrogate endpoints
for clinical trials. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2017;2:646–54) © 2017 The Authors. Published by

A
cute, life-threatening complications of coro-
nary
artery
disease
occur
unpredictably,
although risk factor modification, including
the use of lipid-lowering statin drugs, reduces the fre-
quency of myocardial infarction and prolongs life (1).
Statins primarily promote plaque stability by altering
biological processes including inflammatory activity
of plaques (2), rather than through relatively modest
reduction in plaque size (3). Percutaneous catheter-
based coronary interventions performed to alleviate
angina provide an opportunity to examine the local
inflammatory status of plaques by using temperature
sensors, ultrasound, light of various wavelengths,
and cardiac magnetic resonance (4,5). However, of
these techniques, only intravascular ultrasonography
imaging has yielded prognostic information (6,7),
albeit limited, and none of these methods is able to
identify whether individual inflammatory mediators
or other biomolecules involved in the disease process
of atherosclerosis are being actively generated from
plaques in vivo.
We hypothesized that sampling blood to detect
gradients
of
such
biomolecules
released
from
obstructive coronary plaques could provide unique
information
of
scientific
and,
ultimately,
clinical
utility. Previously, simple micro-catheters have been
used to sample coronary artery blood for comparison
with venous samples. However, the local gradients
thus derived are subject to dilution with blood from
other territories, and biomolecules are likely to suffer
uptake or biochemical transformation during passage
through the coronary microcirculation. Furthermore,
as flow through the coronary arteries is predominantly
laminar and much more rapid than radial diffusion,
biomolecules entering the circulation from the artery
wall would most probably become entrained in a near-
wall, unstirred boundary layer, inaccessible to con-
ventional catheters placed directly into the coronary
arteries. The Liquid Biopsy System (LBS) (PlaqueTec,
Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) (Figure 1A) was
therefore designed specifically to overcome boundary
layer effects, thereby allowing more effective blood
sampling to identify local gradients of biomolecules in
the proximal segment of a target coronary artery, the
critical region for culprit plaque formation responsible
for most myocardial infarctions (8).
Following simulations in silico and in vitro and
safety testing in a preclinical porcine model, we now
report results from the first human safety study and
the first human proof of clinical concept evaluation,
which were designed to investigate whether the LBS
can detect biomolecular gradients in diseased coro-
nary arteries of symptomatic patients undergoing
coronary angioplasty and stent deployment.

concept study (n ¼ 28; NCT02119767) were included
in this analysis. Both of the study protocols were
approved
by
local
ethics
committees
(National
Research Ethics Service [NRES] East of England,
Cambridge Central 12/EE/0004 and NRES London,
Chelsea 13/LO/0954, respectively) and the institu-
tional review board at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge,
United Kingdom.
Briefly, the PlaqueTec first-in-human study (MHRA
ref. CI/2012/0031) was designed as a safety and
feasibility
study
aimed
at
acquiring
Conformité
Européene (CE) mark certification. Patients with sta-
ble angina pectoris or with stabilized non–ST-segment
elevation
acute
coronary
syndromes
undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention were included
subject to informed written consent and appropriate
coronary anatomy for the LBS to be deployed in a
nonculprit, unobstructed coronary artery (i.e., not the
artery
receiving
balloon
angioplasty
and
stent
insertion). From this study, 10 patients underwent
sampling from a lesion-free, unobstructed artery.
The human proof-of-concept study (NCT02119767)
used similar inclusion criteria (n ¼ 23 stable angina
pectoris), but in this study, the LBS was positioned
within the target artery for planned intervention, and
sampling was performed before (when lesion severity
and geometry allowed) and after balloon dilation of the
plaque. From this study, 1 patient’s artery was sampled
only before balloon dilation of a target, obstructive,
coronary plaque, 11 were sampled before and after
balloon dilation, and 15 were sampled only after
balloon dilation.
All patients received standard-of-care treatment
including dual antiplatelet therapy and periproce-
dural anticoagulation with heparin; and activated
clotting time was maintained at >250 s during LBS
sampling. The safety endpoints assessed included

Boundary Layer Phenomenon and Concept of the Liquid Biopsy System
(A) Atherosclerotic plaque-associated biomolecules remained trapped in a discrete flow layer adjacent to the vessel wall (blue zone). (B) The
LBS, designed specifically to mix and sample from this boundary layer, is passed over a standard intracoronary guidewire used in all coronary
angioplasty and stent procedures. (C) Once positioned, the LBS sheath is retracted, deploying dedicated mixing structures that disrupt the
boundary later and divert entrained biomolecules into the bulk flow from where they may be simultaneously sampled directly by vacuum
suction through 1 of 4 discrete ports equally spaced along the catheter. (D) Differential concentrations of such biomolecules may then be
measured by multiplex assays to determine transplaque, intracoronary gradients. LBS ¼ Liquid Biopsy System.

 incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction
and adverse clinical events at 30-day follow-up, as
reviewed by an independent data and safety moni-
toring committee. There
were no major
adverse
events attributable to LBS sampling in either study.
OPERATION OF THE LBS. The LBS catheter consists
of discrete lumina exiting at ports equally spaced
along the sampling length, which can be advanced
and positioned across a target plaque. It has 3 arrays
of mixing structures stowed within a retractable
sheath (Figure 1B) that can accommodate various ar-
tery geometries and are designed to divert the cen-
tral,
faster
moving
blood
flow
to
break
up
the
boundary layer (Figure 1C); the resulting mixed sam-
ples are aspirated into removable sample tubes in the
handle of the device (Figure 1D).
The LBS was used as an adjunct to percutaneous
coronary intervention procedures in accordance with
the instructions for use. Briefly, after passage of a
guidewire into the target coronary artery and appro-
priate administration of anticoagulant and vasodila-
tors (glyceryl trinitrate, 100 to 200 mg), the LBS was
negotiated to the area of interest under radiographic
guidance. After
the
device
was
unsheathed, the
dedicated mixing structures were deployed to disrupt
the unstirred boundary layer. Samples of mixed blood
were then drawn into sample tubes in the LBS handle
assembly from the catheter sampling ports through
discrete lumina by manual actuation of a lockable
vacuum syringe. Typically, sampling was undertaken
for 3 mins in the coronary circulation (delivering
approximately 1.5 ml/sample tube) before resheath-
ing the LBS and withdrawing it from the patient. Ten
patients underwent sampling from a lesion-free un-
obstructed artery; 12 were sampled before balloon
dilation of a target, obstructive, coronary plaque; and
27 were sampled after balloon dilation. From these 49
procedures, 196 samples were collected from a prox-
imal reference and 3 downstream sampling ports.
When transplaque sampling was performed, the dis-
tance from the minimum lesion diameter to each
sampling port was determined by quantitative coro-
nary angiography (CAAS workstation version 5.10.2;
Pie
Medical
Imaging
BV,
Maastricht,
the
Netherlands).
PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS. Samples were mixed with
EDTA to achieve a concentration of 1.75 mg/ml. Plasma
was separated by centrifugation, anonymized, and
stored at �80�C. Samples failing to separate due to
contamination with saline or radiographic contrast
medium (5 of 196 samples [2.6%]) were discarded.
Plasma samples were assessed for levels of 92 proteins
by
proximity
extension
assay
(Olink
Bioscience,
Uppsala, Sweden). Detectable analytes were defined as
those for which >75% of samples gave values above the
limit of detection plus 0.5 normalized protein expres-
sion (NPX) unit. Measurements of the 10 analytes that
failed to meet this criterion and spurious data points
(>200% of the within-patient baseline; 3 from 17,952
samples [0.0002%]) were rejected from statistical
analysis. For each analyte, data were log transformed
to achieve a normal distribution, and a mixed effects
linear regression predicting the logarithmic concen-
tration as a function of distance from the lesion mini-
mum diameter was fitted, adjusting for the number of
mixing arrays deployed, with the patient as a random
effect (9). In unobstructed vessels, distance from the
proximal port was used instead. The estimate of the
effect of relative distance on log-concentration was
used to determine the percentage change for each
biomarker over 6 cm of the studied artery length.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. For each analyte, a paired
Student’s t-test of log-value concentration was per-
formed, and gradients of log concentration were
assessed by linear mixed effects regression with the
patient as a random effect; p values obtained were
corrected for multiple comparisons by using the
Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate procedure
(10). Estimates of change in concentration within the
artery were back-converted to linear NPX as a per-
centage. All analyses were performed using R version
3.2.3 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) and were independently validated by
Numerus, Ltd. (Wockingham, United Kingdom), using
SAS version 9.4 software (SAS, Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
The LBS was used to sample blood, including blood
from the near-wall, unstirred boundary layers in
normal and diseased coronary arteries, as shown
schematically in Figure 2A. In unobstructed vessels
with no lesion, no significant positive gradients were
found between the proximal and distal ports of the
device
(Figure
2B).
Before
balloon
dilation
of
obstructive plaques, significant positive gradients
were found for 20 analytes (Figure 2C). After balloon
dilation and consequent plaque disruption, signifi-
cant positive gradients were found for 10 analytes
(false discovery rate p value (p[FDR]) of <0.05)
(Figure 2D). No significant negative gradients were
observed. The magnitudes in NPX units and signifi-
cance, p(FDR) <0.05, of 14 of the gradients observed
before balloon dilation are detailed in Table 1 (top).
Because the relationship between NPX and concen-
tration is specific for each analyte, small changes
in
NPX
can
represent
large-percentage
gradients

 between proximal and distal sampling ports. For this
reason, and to give a measurement that is easier to
compare, we calculated median-percentage differ-
ences in concentration across the sampling length of
the LBS (Table 1 top, Figure 2C). For selected analytes,
we also show the actual values proximal to, at the
midpoint, and distal to the lesions (Figure 3, upper
row). Details of 9 of the gradients observed after an-
gioplasty are provided in Table 1 (bottom), with data
for the same selected analytes expanded in Figure 3
(lower row). Data demonstrate unequivocally the
ability of the LBS to detect biomolecular gradients
across coronary plaques before and after balloon
angioplasty.
DISCUSSION
Local release of biomolecules from plaques has been
postulated, but measurements of the resulting local
gradients of concentration have not been achieved

(A) A summary is shown of biomarker gradients measured in blood sampled across the proximal to distal ports of the LBS system. (B) In 1
study, samples were taken from unobstructed vessels (green vessel). (C) In a separate study, samples were taken from narrowed or
obstructive atherosclerotic plaques, where possible, before balloon dilation (yellow vessel) and in the same and other vessels (D) (red vessel)
after balloon dilation. Data are volcano plots, with each identified biomolecular gradient represented by a single point, with effect size
(median percentage of change of biomolecule concentration over a distance of 6 cm [PP-DP] within coronary artery) plotted on the x-axis
and statistical significance (�log10[p value]) on the y-axis. The dashed horizontal line on each graph represents corrected threshold for
significance of each gradient (p[FDR] <0.05); the vertical dashed line represents zero gradient. p(FDR) ¼ false discovery rate p value;

 previously. Of the biomolecules showing significant
gradients before balloon angioplasty (Table 1 top),
5 are known to be components of blood platelet a
granules (11), namely, IL-8, DKK1, CXCL1, CD40LG,
and PDGFB. Even though we studied mainly stable
angina patients (23 of 28), it is therefore conceivable
that these metabolites are derived from adhered
platelets. However, IL-8 is produced by activated
monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells (ECs)
(12); DKK1 mRNA is found within atherosclerotic
plaques, in ECs, and in leukocytes (13); CXCL1 is
secreted by macrophages (14); and CD40LG is preva-
lent in lymphocytes as well as in other plaque cells (15).
Hence, nonplatelet sources of these metabolites are
probable. DKK1, CXCL1, CD40LG, and PDGFB can all
cause activation of ECs (13–15), which are likely sour-
ces of OLR1, IL-8, PLAUR, CXCL5/6, HBEGF, and
PDGFB. In particular, ECs are overwhelmingly the
most abundant source of OLR1 in the vasculature (16),
and thus the concentration gradient of OLR1 most
likely arises from ECs overlying culprit coronary pla-
ques before balloon dilation. Furthermore, production
of CXCL5/6 is approximately 100-fold upregulated in
ECs treated with the inflammatory mediator tumor
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) (17), and disturbed flow
increases the release of HBEGF from ECs (18). CXCL5/6
and HBEGF could also be released from underlying
smooth muscle cells (SMCs). All remaining mediators
are known to be secreted by blood leukocytes or
mature macrophages, which are present in plaques but
also potentially trapped within thrombi.
The 9 analytes released from plaques after balloon
injury (Table 1 bottom) include 3 of the known
platelet products released before pre-dilation of pla-
ques (IL-8, DKK1, and PDGFB) plus CXCL5/6 and
HBEGF, which could be derived from ECs or SMCs.
Most interestingly, new gradients of CCL2, HSPB1,
and MMP-12 were detected after balloon dilation.
CCL2 is a secreted chemokine that is localized to
macrophages and SMCs in plaques (19). On the other

Blood sampling across coronary plaques was achieved using the Liquid Biopsy System before balloon dilation and after balloon dilation. Proximal and distal measurements of
the biomolecules, identified by their HUGO designations, were used to calculate the change in concentration across plaques, which are shown as median values (range),
measured by proximity extension assay multiplex assays and expressed in DNPX units. The significance of gradients is indicated by p(FDR) values. To aid comparison between
different analytes, NPX values were further used to calculate the median percentage change in concentration across the sampling distance.

 hand, HSPB1 is primarily an intracellular chaperonin
with anti-inflammatory activity that is more highly
expressed in SMCs of normal vessel walls than in
plaques (20). Given its localization, the gradient of
HSPB1 is most likely derived from cells injured during
plaque disruption by angioplasty. Consistent with
this, increased plasma levels of HSP27 have been re-
ported in patients after acute coronary syndromes
(20). Release of MMP-12 after angioplasty may be
particularly significant because it is normally unde-
tectable by histology in ECs or SMCs and is expressed
only in plaque macrophages surrounding the necrotic
core
of
rupture-prone
plaques
(21,22).
Moreover,
genome-wide association studies suggested a causa-
tive role for MMP-12 in early strokes (23), and the
abundance of MMP-12-expressing cells in carotid ar-
tery plaques predicts the subsequent occurrence of
strokes and major adverse events (22). It is highly
likely, therefore, that the post-angioplasty gradient of
MMP-12 is derived from the exposure of the plaque
core to the circulation, and the size of gradient
may potentially possess diagnostic or prognostic in-
formation.
In
a
similar
fashion,
a
recent
study
demonstrated local release of MMP-9 into coronary
blood from spontaneously disrupted plaques and
suggested it as a biomarker that distinguishes ST-
segment elevation myocardial infarction and non–
ST-segment
elevation
myocardial
infarction
(24).
Unfortunately, MMP-9 was not included in the prox-
imity extension assay panel we used, which precludes
a direct comparison. There are also several method-
ological differences that would have complicated a
direct comparison with our new data. First, Nishi-
guchi et al. (24) compared coronary luminal blood
downstream of the culprit site with that from a
systemic arterial sample, whereas we sampled the

derived growth factor B (PDGFB) before and after balloon dilation; and no gradient in growth hormone (GH), acting as a negative control. Box and whisker plots

 unstirred layer up- and downstream of individual
plaques. Second, Nishiguchi et al. (24) studied lesions
giving rise to myocardial infarctions, which were
mostly spontaneous plaque ruptures where thrombus
was detected and would have been present for some
time. Given that MMP-9 is abundant in monocytes/
macrophages and neutrophils, a significant contribu-
tion by the thrombus to local release of MMP-9 cannot
be ruled out. In accordance with this, when Nishi-
guchi et al. (24) studied stable angina patients before
angioplasty, they found no MMP-9 release. We used
mostly stable angina patients undergoing elective
percutaneous
intervention,
which
would
have
diluted our ability to detect gradients of MMP-9.
Instead, we found release of MMP-12 immediately
after iatrogenic plaque rupture as part of the angio-
plasty
procedure.
MMP-12
is
not
expressed
at
detectable levels in human peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (25) and may therefore more selectively
reflect the status of the plaque.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results demonstrate that gradients of bioactive
molecules exist across intact and disrupted athero-
sclerotic plaques, and these may be sampled and
assessed using this novel technology. From the data
in Table 1, we have already shown that the LBS can
yield novel biological insights. Furthermore, our re-
sults provide proof-of-concept for even more ambi-
tious studies, for example, to test whether LBS
sampling can provide a surrogate marker for activity
of plaques that are vulnerable to rupture. In this
context, OLR1 and CXCL5/6 seem particularly prom-
ising because they are likely to be endothelium-
derived before angioplasty. In addition, levels of
MMP-12 may be especially informative after balloon
dilation
for
the
reasons
detailed
above.
Future
studies should address whether gradients of released
biomolecules
have
the
potential
to
monitor
the
impact of existing and new therapeutics, and when
fully validated and coupled to high-content analyses,
LBS-detected gradients could be used as biomarkers
to identify patients with high-risk plaques. The po-
tential combination of LBS-derived biological infor-
mation could be used to complement conventional
anatomical imaging methods in order to augment and
refine
plaque/patient
risk-stratification
and
prog-
nostic power, enabling therapeutic changes that may
improve patient outcomes.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: There is an un-
met clinical need to detect coronary atherosclerotic plaques that
are likely to rupture and therefore precipitate acute coronary
syndromes. Such vulnerable plaques could be passivated by
angioplasty, or the patients could be treated aggressively, for
example, by adding newly developed PCSK9 inhibitors to
commonly applied statin therapy. Catheter-based imaging and
biophysical methods have been able to detect features of
vulnerable plaques, including large lipid cores and thin fibrous
caps, prevalence of inflammatory cells, and raised temperatures.
However, up until now, the ability to define a biochemical
signature for vulnerable plaques has been limited to ex vivo and
post-mortem methods or to detecting single molecule gradients
between coronary and peripheral blood. The Liquid Biopsy
System was developed to detect the release of biomolecules
across plaques in live patients. It was shown previously by fluid
mechanics to effectively mix the barrier layer and bulk flow and
therefore harbor the ability to sample blood close to the vessel
wall where released biomolecules are likely to be most
concentrated. The ability to detect small gradients of released
molecules was optimized by collecting blood at the same time
upstream and downstream of individual plaques. Furthermore,
coupling this optimal sampling to highly multiplexed analysis
increased the power of the approach to generate scientifically
and clinically valuable information.
TRANSLATIONALOUTLOOK:Thepresentfeasibilitystudiesused
2 relatively small patient cohorts in whom blood was sampled
separately from normal coronary arteries or intact plaques before and
afterdisruptionbyangioplasty.Inthefuture,theLiquidBiopsySystem
could be used to sample across multiple angiographically significant
plaques in the same patient to distinguish vulnerable from stable
plaques. Similarly, the panel of biomolecules currently used was
simply a small sample from the thousands of disease-related
biomolecules that have been identified and for which proximity
extension assayscouldbedeveloped.Thereisstillmuch to bedoneto
identify the optimal biochemical signature to define a vulnerable
plaque. Single biomarkers or combinations will hopefully be defined
byfutureexplorationsusingthedevice.Thesamplingtechniquecould
also be coupled to high-content “omic” analyses of, for example,
proteins or microRNAs. Longitudinal studies could be conducted to
investigatetheabilityofdruginterventionstonormalizethereleaseof
biomolecules, the goal being to define reliable surrogate endpoints
for clinical intervention studies.
