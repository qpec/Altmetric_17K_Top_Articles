IMPORTANCE There is increasing evidence supporting the importance of psychosocial factors
in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic disease. They have been shown to be associated
with the population attributable risk for myocardial infarction.
OBJECTIVE To determine if a score of favorable childhood psychosocial factors would be
associated with decreased coronary artery calcification in adulthood.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The analyses were performed in 2015 using data
gathered in 1980 and 2008 within the longitudinal Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study.
The data source consisted of 311 individuals who had psychosocial factors measured at ages
12 years to 18 years and coronary artery calcification measured 28 years later in adulthood.
The summary measure of psychosocial factors in childhood comprised measures of
socioeconomic factors, emotional factors, parental health behaviors, stressful events,
self-regulation of the child, and social adjustment of the child.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coronary artery calcification at ages 40 years to 46 years.
RESULTS Of the 311 participants, 48.2% were men. Of the participants, 55 (17.7%) had some
calcium observed in their coronary arteries. A 1-SD increase in a favorable summary score of
childhood psychological factors was associated with an adulthood coronary artery
calcification probability of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76-0.95) (P = .006). This inverse relationship
remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and conventional childhood risk factors
(0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97; P = .02) or for age, sex, adulthood conventional cardiovascular risk
factors, socioeconomic status, social support, and depressive symptoms (0.83; 95% CI,
0.71-0.97; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this longitudinal study, we observed an independent
association between childhood psychosocial well-being and reduced coronary artery
calcification in adulthood. A positive childhood psychosocial environment may decrease
cardiovascular risk in adulthood and may represent a potentially modifiable risk determinant.

A
therosclerosis is a complex disease. While dyslipid-
emia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking are major
risk determinants, there are several other causal and
modifying factors.1 There has been increasing interest in the
importance of psychosocial factors.2 For example, depres-
sion is associated with increased risk for incident clinical ath-
erosclerotic disease and increased mortality rate in those with
existing cardiovascular disease.3 In addition to longitudinal
studies, case-control studies have demonstrated that psycho-
social factors are powerful contributors to the population at-
tributable risk for myocardial infarction.4 These factors in-
clude depression, general stress, financial stress, life events,
and locus of control with a combined population attributable
risk of 29%.4 Socioeconomic status, which is strongly corre-
lated with psychological health,5 is also an important cardio-
vascular risk factor.6

calcification is found more frequently in advanced coronary
lesions10; conversely, the absence of detectable CAC in asymp-
tomatic patients implies that the presence of atherosclerotic
plaque is unlikely.10 Coronary artery calcification has been as-
sociatedwithincidentcoronaryheartdiseaseindifferentpopu-
lations beyond that provided by conventional risk factors.9,11
In a 2015 study, we observed that a constellation of sev-
eral favorable psychosocial factors was associated with an im-
provedAmericanHeartAssociationIdealCardiovascularHealth
Index in adulthood.12 Prior research has focused on single
psychosocial predictors, although the combined effect of
multiple psychosocial factors may be more important.13 Evi-
dence has suggested a graded association where several psy-
chosocialexposures(multipleadversitiesoccurringatthesame
time) have superior predictive power for cardiovascular
events.14-17 However, to our knowledge, no study has exam-
ined whether these factors in childhood are associated with
adulthood CAC. Such knowledge would be important for pri-
mary prevention. Specifically, establishing factors that might
protect against pathogenic development of CAC would be in
keeping with goals that aim to improve the cardiovascular
health of the entire population.18
In this study, we examined whether a summary measure
of favorable psychosocial factors that can reflect both the pres-
ence of positive factors (eg, high parental caregiving nurtur-
ance) and the absence of negative factors (eg, absence of pre-
viouslydiagnosedparentalmentaldisorder)inchildhoodcould
be associated with lower risk of CAC in adulthood. The study

measurements performed 28 years later.
Methods
Participants
The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study is a multi-
center follow-up study of atherosclerosis precursors in Finn-
ish children and adolescents. The first cross-sectional survey
was conducted in 1980, when 3596 participants aged 3 years,
6 years, 9 years, 12 years, 15 years, and 18 years were ran-
domly chosen from the 5 study areas. Thereafter, follow-up
studies were performed at 3- to 9-year intervals. In 2008, a car-
diac CT study to measure CAC was conducted for 589 indi-
viduals, then 40 to 46 years of age. This was a convenience
sample; the 3 oldest cohorts (aged 12 years, 15 years, and 18
years at baseline) from 3 centers with a possibility to perform
CAC imaging were invited (n = 711, attendance rate 80%).19 For
thisstudy,311individualswithcompletedataonchildhoodpsy-
chosocial factors in 1980 and CAC imaging performed in 2008
were included. The study was approved by the ethics com-
mitteesofHelsinkiUniversityHospital,KuopioUniversityHos-
pital, Oulu University Hospital, Tampere University Hospital,
andTurkuUniversityHospital.Allparticipantsand/ortheirpar-
ents gave written informed consent.
Psychosocial Factors in Childhood
We assessed 6 psychosocial factors proposed as central com-
ponents of childhood psychosocial environment in previous
literature.20,21 These were socioeconomic environment, emo-
tionalenvironment,parentalhealthbehaviors,stressfulevents,
self regulation, and social adjustment of the child. These fac-
tors were assessed by parents using standardized question-
nairesatthebaselineexaminationin1980.12Webuiltthe6psy-
chosocial factors from binary variables, where 1 stands for
favorable and 0 for less than favorable. The cutoff points were
based on previous evidence and theoretical knowledge as de-
scribed in detail elsewhere.12
1. Favorable socioeconomic factors score consisted of 4 com-
ponents: upper white collar occupation (1 point); academic/
college degree (1 point); family income in highest 25% (1
point); and occupational stability as indicated by absence
ofunemploymentspells,retirement,and/orlong-termmedi-
cal leave (1 point).
2. Favorable emotional family environment score consisted of
4 components. The first was absence of diagnosed paren-
tal mental disorder (1 point). The second was high parental
Key Points
Question: Is a score of favorable childhood psychosocial factors
associated with descreased coronary artery calcification in
adulthood?
Findings: A favorable summary measure of childhood
psychological factors was significantly inversely associated with
the prevalence of any cornoary artery calcification in adulthood.
Meaning: A positive childhood psychosocial environment may
decrease cardiovascular risk in adulthood and may represent a
potentially modifiable risk determinant.

caregiving nurturance, measured using a 7-item scale
(α = .70) previously used in this data set. A reply “very of-
ten” to all items gave 1 point. The third component was high
parental life satisfaction, measured using a 3-item scale.
A positive reply to all 3 items gave 1 point. Fourth, reason-
able alcohol use was included because of evidence indicat-
ing that unhealthy drinking is harmful to emotional
development.22 Parents reporting intoxication “never or at
maximum 3 times per year” were classified as reasonable
users (1 point).
3. Optimal health behaviors of the parents were reported in-
dependently by each parent. Because we had no data on pa-
rental diet, we used body mass index of more than 30.0 (cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) as a proxy of excess energy intake (0, obese and 1,
nonobese). Other health behaviors were nonsmoker (1
point) and regular physical activity (1 point for exercise at
least weekly).
4. Lack of stressful events included events that may threaten
achild’
ssenseofstabilityandcontinuity.Thestressfulevents
were moving residence, change of school, parental divorce
or separation, death of a family member, and serious dis-
ease in the family. Nonpresence of each event gave 1 point.
5. Self-regulatory behavior of the participant consisted of 2
scales, 1 measuring high self-control and the other measur-
inghighaggressioncontrol.Predictivevalidityofbothscales
has been established previously.23,24 The self-control scale
consisted of 1 question where children described as being
verycontrolled“alwaysormostofthetime”received1point.
Aggression control (α = .60) was measured with 6 items,
each giving 1 point. The total score was formed by combin-
ing scores from self-control and aggression control.
6. Social adjustment was assessed by a question about paren-
tal worry about the child’
s adjustment (1 point) and paren-
tal evaluation of the child’
s general level of adjustment (1
point). Our previous work has shown that these questions
are associated with outcomes that are theoretically related
to social adjustment.23

Cardiovascular Risk Factors
Height and weight were measured, and body mass index was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared.2Inchildhood,bloodpressurewasmeasuredfromthe
brachial artery using a standard mercury sphygmomanom-
eter. In adulthood, a random-zero mercury sphygmomanom-
eter was used. The average of 3 measurements was used in
analysis. For the determination of serum lipid levels, venous
bloodsamplesweredrawnafteranovernightfastbothinchild-
hood and adulthood. These analyses as well as measure-
ments of adulthood glucose levels were performed with stan-
dard enzymatic methods. Information on smoking habits (own
and parental) was obtained with a questionnaire. In adult-
hood, questionnaires were used to gather data on partici-
pants’socioeconomic status (annual income), perceived so-
cial support,27 and depressive symptoms.28
Coronary Artery Calcification
Computed tomographic scans were performed at 3 study lo-
cations in Finland: Turku, Tampere, and Kuopio. The scans
wereperformedwithaGEDiscovery64-sliceCT/positronemis-
siontomographydevice(GEHealthcare)(Turku),aPhilipsBril-
liance 64-slice CT device (Philips Medical Systems) (Tam-
pere), and a Siemens Somatom Sensation 16-slice CT device
(Siemens Healthcare) (Kuopio). Coronary artery calcification
scores were calculated using the Agatston method for each
coronary artery.29 The coefficient of variation for intraob-
server measurements was 4%. Absence of CAC was defined as
anAgatstonscoreof0andpresenceofCACasanAgatstonscore
of 1 or greater.19 An imaging phantom with deposits of known
calcium concentration was also scanned twice using 3 projec-
tions at all of the study centers, and the calcium scores from
these scans were compared. The coefficient of variation be-
tween scans was 3.9%.
Statistical Methods
Standardized probabilities and 95% CIs for the association be-
tween childhood psychosocial factors and the presence of any
CACinadulthoodwereestimatedusinglogisticregressionwith
a logit link. Owing to skewed distribution of the calcium score
variable, Spearman nonlinear correlation analyses were used
to analyze the associations with continuous CAC scoring in
adulthood. The analyses were performed both unadjusted and
adjusted with age, sex, and conventional cardiovascular risk
factors in childhood and adulthood. Analyses were per-
formed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute). Sta-
tistical significance was inferred at a 2-tailed P value of .05 or
less.

there were statistically significant differences between these
groups in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .03) and
triglyceride (P < .001) levels.
Childhood Psychosocial Factors and CAC in Adulthood
As shown in Table 2, the childhood psychosocial factor score
was inversely associated with the prevalence of any CAC in
adulthood. This relation remained significant after adjust-
ments for age, sex, and conventional childhood risk factors.
In addition, in an analysis adjusted for age, sex, and adult-
hoodriskfactorsincludingbodymassindex,lipids,bloodpres-
sure, glucose, smoking, annual income, social support ,and de-
pressive symptoms, the inverse relation remained significant
(0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.97; P = .02). Of the individual child-
hood psychosocial factors, self-regulatory behavior was in-
versely associated with adult CAC (Table 2).
In analyses performed separately for different coronary ar-
tery regions, there was a significant inverse association be-
tween childhood psychosocial score and CAC in the left ante-
rior descending artery (Table 3). This inverse relationship was
also independent of adulthood risk factors (0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-
0.97; P = .03).
Childhood psychosocial factor score was also inversely as-
sociated with the adult CAC score. In analyses adjusted for age,
sex, and childhood or adulthood risk factors, Spearman cor-
relation coefficients were r = −0.14, P = .01 and r = −0.12,
P = .04, respectively.
Discussion
These longitudinal data suggest that adverse childhood psy-
chosocial factors are associated with CAC 28 years after the
baselineevaluation.Thecompositescoreof6psychosocialfac-
tors(socioeconomicenvironment,emotionalenvironment,pa-
rental health behaviors, stressful events, self-regulation of the
child, and social adjustment of the child) was related to CAC
even after adjustment for age, sex, and conventional cardio-
vascular risk factors in childhood. Moreover, the association
with CAC was independent of adulthood cardiovascular and
psychosocial factors.
These findings extend previous data highlighting the
importance of a positive childhood psychosocial environ-
ment with regard to adult health outcomes. Studies from the
Young Finns cohort and from the Collaborative Perinatal
Project in the United States have reported associations with
favorable cardiovascular risk factor status in adulthood.12,17
Existing evidence suggests a graded association where sev-
eral psychosocial exposures are associated with greater risk
for cardiovascular diseases. Such a graded association has
been shown for adverse cardiometabolic profiles15,17,30 and
incident cardiovascular disease.14,16 However, most studies
have measured childhood exposures retrospectively. Con-
cerning CAC, in the longitudinal Coronary Artery Risk Devel-
opment in Young Adults study,31-33 it has been shown that
hostility and socioeconomic position in early adulthood (at
ages 18-30 years) are related with later CAC. In our study, we
observed that for every favorable 1-SD change in childhood
psychosocial factors score, the probability of CAC in adult-
hood was decreased by 15% in a model adjusted with child-
hood risk factors and 17% when adjusted with adulthood risk
factors. These findings suggest that favorable psychosocial
environment in childhood is associated independently with
lower risk of later atherosclerosis.
There are several possible mechanistic explanations for
these results. In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in
Young Adults study, early adulthood psychosocial factors
have been shown to relate to metabolic functioning and
inflammatory process.34-36 We have previously reported a
relationship between positive childhood psychosocial fac-
tors and better cardiovascular health in adulthood, as mea-
sured using the American Heart Association Ideal Cardiovas-
cular Health Index.12 A 2012 model approach suggests that
positive psychological experiences may increase restorative
processes (eg, healthy behaviors) leading to optimal cardio-
vascular health.37 At the same time, adverse psychosocial
factors (or lack of positive factors) may promote deteriora-
tive processes (eg, inflammation) that increase the risk for
cardiac diseases.37 In animal models, several psychosocial
factors, such as stress, social status, aggressiveness, respon-
siveness to psychological challenge, and the stability of the
social environment, have been associated with atheroscle-
rotic changes in vasculature.38 As a next step, research
should attempt to identify the mechanistic pathways
whereby early-life psychosocial exposures lead to vascular
changes in humans.

From the clinical perspective, our findings underscore the
need for increased awareness of promoting positive psycho-
social health in childhood. Because data on many of the fac-
tors used in the summative score could be readily gathered at
diverse health service encounters, these data might be used
in targeted family interventions for primary prevention, es-
pecially in those at greatest risk.
This study has key strengths, particularly the longitudi-
nal analysis of a population-representative cohort over 3 de-
cades. We were also able to take into account the effects of ma-
jor cardiovascular risk factors. We acknowledge some
unavoidable limitations, including that we only had data on
the complete set of childhood psychosocial factors among a
subcohort from the Young Finns study. This may compro-
mise the statistical power and increase the possibility of type
II error, so the findings should be interpreted cautiously until
further studies can confirm our results. Our assessment for
childhood psychosocial factors was developed for this spe-
cific study 3 decades ago and is not a current standard mea-
sure, limiting the possibility of direct comparison of our find-
ings with other studies. However, we have obtained predictive
validity by showing that our summary measure is associated
with conceptually relevant outcomes such as mental health39
and cardiometabolic biomarkers12 in adulthood. Although the
psychosocial score specifically developed for this study was
nonstandard, the 6 psychosocial facets chosen to represent
childhood factors were theoretically sound,26 representing
childhood domains that have gained robust evidence as being
important for future cardiometabolic outcomes.12,16,17 An-
other limitation was that the assessments were based on self-
reports and asked from parents alone, which can induce bias
if the parent has not been able to make balanced judgments.
The advantage of using parental assessments was that they
were made independently of the child outcomes, thus elimi-
nating common-rater variance. Altogether, we acknowledge
that our measurement battery had several limitations, but it
nevertheless provided an estimate of a wider range of child-
hood factors than most studies. Furthermore, summary bi-
nary scores have the advantages of being parsimonious. They
make no assumptions about the relative strengths of mul-
tiple risk factors or their collinearity, and they enable testing
of additive effects over a range of exposures.13 Because the
study cohort is composed of young adults, we were not able
to study associations with cardiovascular events. Instead, we
have used CT measures of CAC as a validated marker of sig-
nificant atherosclerosis. This method has been widely used in
clinical studies where it predicts cardiovascular outcomes in-
dependently of conventional risk factors.9 Moreover, in a 2014
American College of Cardiology Foundation Appropriate Use
Criteria Task Force statement,40 CT measurement of CAC was
mentioned as the modality to assess the extent of subclinical
atherosclerosis to be used for the risk assessment of coronary
disease among certain groups of asymptomatic individuals.40
Finally, because study participants were predominantly white,
the results cannot necessarily be generalized to other racial/
ethnic groups.
Conclusions
We have shown an independent association between child-
hood psychosocial factors and CAC in adulthood. This find-
ing suggests that favorable childhood psychosocial environ-
mentmaydecreasecardiovascularriskinadulthood.Strategies
that aim to optimize psychological well-being may be benefi-
cial in reducing adult cardiovascular disease.
