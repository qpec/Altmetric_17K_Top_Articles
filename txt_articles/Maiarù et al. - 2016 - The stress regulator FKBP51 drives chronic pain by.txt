Abstract
Polymorphisms in FKBP51 are associated with stress-related psychiatric disorders and influence 
the severity of pain symptoms experienced after trauma. Here, we report that FKBP51 (FK506 
binding protein 51) is crucial for the full development and maintenance of long-term pain states 
and that this is independent from its effect on mood. Indeed, FKBP51 knock out mice but also 
mice with silencing of FKBP51 restricted to the spinal cord showed reduced hypersensitivity in a 
number of persistent pain models. FKBP51 deletion did not compromise the detection of acute 
painful stimuli, a critical protective mechanism. Moreover, the specific FKBP51 inhibitor SAFit2 
intrathecally administered reduced the severity of an established pain state, confirming the crucial 
role of spinal FKBP51 in nociceptive processing. Finally, glucocorticoid signaling, which is 
known to modulate persistent pain states in rodents, was impaired in FKBP51 knock out mice. 
This suggested that FKBP51 regulates chronic pain by modulation of glucocorticoid signaling. In 
conclusion, FKBP51 is a central mediator of chronic pain, likely in humans as well as rodents, and 
is a new pharmacologically tractable target for the treatment of long term pain states.

 Introduction
Genetic variants in FKBP51 are associated with major depression and post-traumatic stress 
disorder in humans (1, 2), and mice lacking the gene FKBP51 show improved coping 
behavior under stress, without alterations to their attention or motor functions(3–5). 
Variations in the gene FKBP51 influence the severity of musculoskeletal pain symptoms 
experienced during the weeks after motor vehicle collision or after sexual assault(6, 7). 
Furthermore, as we have previously reported in a microarray study, FKBP51 is up-regulated 
in the rat superficial dorsal horn after de-repression by the methyl CpG binding protein 2 
(MeCP2) within 2h of ankle joint inflammation(8–10). We therefore hypothesised that 
FKBP51 contributes to injury-induced pain hypersensitivity. We have tested this hypothesis 
here by using knock out (KO) mice, siRNA technology and the recently developed FKBP51 
inhibitor SAFit2(11).
FKBP51 is up-regulated after activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by steroids(12) 
and, in a negative feedback loop, modulates the stress response by antagonizing GR and 
regulating its sensitivity(13). Moreover, it has been proposed that GR signaling regulates the 
hypersensitivity that develops in long term pain states (14–16). Using behavioral, 
pharmacological and molecular tools, we here test the role of spinal FKBP51 on long term 
pain states and their regulation by glucocorticoid signaling.
Results
FKBP51 increases in the spinal cord to after noxious stimulation
First, using immunohistochemistry with tyramide amplification, we found that FKBP51 was 
expressed exclusively in neurons of the superficial dorsal horn of both naïve and mice 
injected with CFA in the ankle joint (Fig.1). Using RT-qPCR, we then confirmed that 
FKBP51 was increased significantly in both rats and mice after ankle joint inflammation 
induced by injection of Complete Freunds’ adjuvant (CFA) in the ankle joint: FKBP51 was 
up-regulated in the dorsal horn in the rat at 2h and 6h after CFA, and in the mouse 24h and 3 
days after CFA (Fig.2A)and we had already reported that this increase in FKBP51 mRNA 
correlated with an increase in FKBP51 protein in the rat (10). No changes were observed in 
L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) or in the cervical cord, indicating a localized spinal 
response to the CFA injection. In people carrying specific variants of FKBP51, childhood 
trauma can induce a decrease in DNA methylation in the promoter of FKBP51. This 
demethylation enhances stress-dependent expression of FKBP51 and is associated with a 
higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adult life(2). We therefore 
examined whether noxious stimulation could also induce changes in FKBP51 DNA 
methylation. For this, we performed bisulphite pyro-sequencing on rat superficial dorsal 
horn tissue after injection of CFA into the ankle joint and observed a fast (2 h post CFA) and 
long lasting (7 days post CFA) ipsilateral decrease in methylation at specific CpG sites 
previously identified in the promoter sequence of FKBP51(17) (Fig.2B, C). This suggested 
that changes in DNA methylation could contribute to the rapid increase in spinal FKBP51 
levels after CFA and that FKBP51 may regulate both the development and maintenance of 
long-term pain states. To test this hypothesis, we next used FKBP51 KO mice and their WT 
littermates.

 Global deletion of FKBP51 has no effect on naïve thresholds and the short term 
inflammatory response
We found no difference in the cutaneous mechanical sensory threshold (Fig. 3A) or thermal 
heat (Fig. 3B) and cold (Fig. 3C) thresholds between KO and WT animals, suggesting that 
acute nociception was not impaired by FKBP51 deletion. This conclusion was supported by 
the normal expression of primary afferent markers IB4 and CGRP in the superficial dorsal 
horn in these mice (Fig. 3D and Fig. S1). Moreover, there was no difference between the two 
genotypes in the nociceptive sensitivity that follows the hindpaw injection of short-term 
inflammatory agents such as formalin (Fig. 2E) or IL6 (Fig.2F) These data suggested that 
deletion of FKBP51 does not impair acute pain responses.
Global deletion of FKBP51 prevents the full development of long term pain states
We next tested the effect of FKBP51 KO on long term pain states. Although both KO and 
WT mice showed a significant reduction in mechanical threshold after CFA injection in the 
ankle joint, KO mice were less sensitive than WT mice (Fig.4A). However, there was no 
difference in CFA-induced spinal phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
(pErk) (Fig.4B and Fig.S2A) and cFos (Fig.4B and Fig.S2B). Similarly, hindpaw injection 
of CFA, which induces long-term inflammation, caused significantly less mechanical 
hypersensitivity in KO than in WT mice (Fig.4C), despite causing the same degree of edema 
in the hindpaw (Fig.4D). Finally, to test whether the modulatory role of FKBP51 on 
persistent pain states extended beyond long-term inflammation, we also investigated a model 
of neuropathic pain. KO mice with spared nerve injury (SNI)(18) showed less mechanical 
hypersensitivity than WT mice, starting at 5 days after surgery (Fig.4E). They also 
performed better on the rotarod test (Fig.4F), likely a result of reduced mechanical 
hyperalgesia, as well as increased ability to cope with stress (3, 4). However, glial activation, 
which contributes to the hypersensitivity seen in neuropathic pain states(19), was not 
different in KO mice 14 days after SNI surgery than in WT mice (Fig. S3, A and B). 
Together, these results showed that FKBP51 KO mice display reduced mechanical 
hypersensitivity in long-term pain states, suggesting that FKBP51 plays a key role in the full 
development of persistent pain states. Because our original findings (10) suggested a role for 
spinal FKBP51 in pain processing, we next used siRNA to ask whether FKBP51 specifically 
expressed in the spinal cord contributed to nociceptive signaling.
Spinal FKBP51 drives long term pain states
First, we specifically deleted FKBP51 in the spinal cords of WT mice using intrathecal 
injections of siRNA. Injections of siRNA reduced FKBP51 expression in the spinal cord by 
24% but had no effect on FKBP51 expression in the DRGs (Fig.S4A). This decrease in 
FKBP51 expression is similar to that reported by others when injecting siRNA intrathecally 
that has a significant effect on behavior(20). This deletion is likely to have occurred in 
neurons exclusively because in the superficial dorsal horn we found that only neurons 
expressed FKBP51 (by using immunohistochemistry with tyramide amplification). Although 
siRNA injections did not affect mechanical threshold and motor performance in naïve 
animals (Fig.S4B and S4C, respectively), siRNA injections starting 48h before the CFA 
injection significantly reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by CFA-triggered

 ankle joint inflammation when compared to scramble siRNA injections (Fig.5A). More 
important, because it mimics the clinical situation, siRNA silencing of FKBP51 starting 3 
days after injury, when the hypersensitivity was maximal, significantly attenuated the pain 
state (Fig.5B).
We then used the highly specific FKBP51 inhibitor SAFit2 (11) to block FKBP51 activity. 
Like anti-FKBP51 siRNA treatment, SAFit2 administered intrathecally improved the 
mechanical hypersensitivity induced by ankle joint inflammation when injected 3days after 
the CFA treatment (Fig.5C), suggesting that FKBP51 may be a promising therapeutic target 
for the treatment of chronic pain.
Together these results showed that the modulation of hypersensitivity by FKBP51 can be 
dissociated from its effect on mood: FKBP51 expressed in the spinal cord alone is sufficient 
to control the pain response. Moreover, spinal FKBP51 is not only sufficient for the full 
development of chronic pain but is also critical to the maintenance of this pain. We next 
explored the mechanism by which FKBP51 regulates nociceptive processing.
FKBP51 regulates injury induced hypersensitivity by modulating glucocorticoid signaling
FKBP51 is an antagonist of GR (13) and GR signaling regulates the hypersensitivity that 
develops after nerve injury (15, 14). We therefore hypothesized that FKBP51 regulates the 
hypersensitivity that develops in long-term pain states by modulating glucocorticoid 
signaling. First, we studied the co-expression of FKBP51 and GR in WT superficial dorsal 
horn with immunohistochemistry. We found that colocalization of FKBP51 and GR was 
equivalent in tissue from both sham mice and mice injected with CFA in the ankle joint, with 
an average of 84 ± 1% of FKBP51 positive neurons expressing GR (85.5 ± 4%, CFA 
ipsilateral, 83.7 ± 1%, CFA contralateral and 82.1 ± 1%, sham) and 81 ± 1% of GR positive 
neurons expressing FKBP51 (78.7 ± 7%, CFA ipsilateral, 82.7 ± 2%, CFA contralateral and 
81.2 ± 4%, sham) (N=3 mice/group; 3 sections counted per mouse and 30 to 70 neurones 
counted per half section; Fig.6A).
GR has two main isoforms in both humans and rodents, GRα and GRβ, each associated with 
a distinct response to glucocorticoid hormones (21). In the spinal cord, we found a small 
difference in total GR mRNA expression between FKBP51 KO and WT mice (Fig.6B). 
Nevertheless, CFA injection to the ankle joint did not induce any significant changes in GR 
mRNA levels in either genotype, and we found no difference in GR protein levels between 
KO and WT mice, in both naïve and CFA-injected animals (Fig. S5). There was also no 
difference in GRα mRNA levels between KO and WT and naïve and CFA-injected animals; 
however, both WT and KO mice showed increased GRβ levels on the side ipsilateral to the 
CFA injection compared to the contralateral side, and levels of GRβ were significantly lower 
in KO animals than in WT animals (Fig.6B). Increased GRβ levels have been associated 
with glucocorticoid resistance in inflammatory disorders (22). Therefore our results suggest 
that in inflammatory pain states, KO mice are more sensitive to glucocorticoids than are WT 
mice. Supporting this interpretation, KO mice had lower corticosterone levels than WT 
mice, both in naïve and in persistent pain states (Fig.6C), indicating a stronger suppression 
of corticosterone secretion in FKBP51-deficient mice, as reported previously (3).

 Next, to test whether FKBP51 drives chronic pain by modifying GR signaling in the spinal 
cord, we used the GR antagonist mifepristone (RU38486). First, we injected mifepristone 
intrathecally in naïve animals. Both naïve WT and naïve KO mice showed increased 
mechanical hypersensitivity after mifepristone administration (Fig.6D), indicating that GR 
was anti-nociceptive under basal conditions, regardless of FKBP51 expression. However, 
when mifepristone was administered 3 days after CFA injection in the ankle joint, the GR 
antagonist eliminated the CFA-induced hypersensitivity in WT animals (Fig.6E and Fig.S6A 
for full time course of behavior), as seen in neuropathic pain models (15, 16), but aggravated 
CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in KO mice (Fig.6F and Fig.S6B for full time 
course of behavior). Mifepristone also increased the CFA-induced hypersensitivity in mice 
with reduced levels of FKBP51 only in the spinal cord (Fig.6G and Fig.S6C for full time 
course of behavior). This result suggested that after CFA injection, spinal cord GR signaling 
had switched to a pro-nociceptive function in WT animals but that the deletion of spinal cord 
FKBP51 had prevented this switch and restricted GR to an anti-nociceptive function.
Finally, IL6 is a cytokine upregulated with neuroinflammation (23, 24), and GR can directly 
induce or inhibit the transcription of IL6 by complex binding to the IL6 promoter regulatory 
elements (25). We measured IL6 levels in the spinal cord of WT and KO mice and found 
that IL6 was upregulated in the ipsilateral superficial dorsal horn in WT mice after CFA 
injection (Fig.6H), supporting the idea that GR could be promoting pro-inflammatory 
cytokine expression in WT animals after CFA treatment. However, IL6 levels were 
significantly lower in the spinal cord of the KO mice on the side ipsilateral to the CFA 
injection when compared both to WT animals and to the KO contralateral side, suggesting 
that GR could be suppressing IL6 transcription on the ipsilateral side in KO mice after CFA 
injection (Fig.6H).
Altogether, our data indicate that spinal FKBP51 regulates the full development and 
maintenance of chronic pain by modulating glucocorticoid signaling. We propose that 
inhibition of FKBP51 function by deletion or antagonism allows spinal cord GR signaling to 
perform an anti-nociceptive function in long-term pain states. As a result, CFA-induced 
hypersensitivity never develops to its full extent in FKBP51 KO animals and resolves after 
deletion or inhibition of spinal cord FKBP51 in WT mice.
Discussion
This study identifies the stress modulator FKBP51 as a regulator of injury-induced 
hypersensitivity. Our experiments show that in mice deletion of FKBP51 did not 
compromise the detection of acute noxious stimuli but did attenuate the full development 
and the maintenance of mechanical hypersensitivity, in our animal models of chronic pain 
states. This was true whether FKBP51 was deleted before the pain-causing injury or silenced 
after the long-term pain state had been established. Moreover, FKBP51 regulation of pain 
states could be dissociated from its regulation of mood since deletion of FKBP51 or 
inhibition with the state of the art inhibitor SAFit2(11) that was restricted to the spinal cord 
improved the CFA-induced hypersensitivity. As a result, we propose that FKBP51 is a 
potential therapeutic target for the control of chronic pain with promising clinical

 applications. Chronic pain is an area of immense unmet medical need that requires new 
analgesic drugs.
FKBP51 regulates GR signaling, and GR mediates the action of steroid hormones required 
for physiological homeostasis. Prior to hormone binding, GR is part of a large protein 
complex localised to the cytoplasm where it is bound to heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), 
which itself recruits to its COOH terminus a co-chaperone such as FKBP51 or FKBP52. 
Although FKBP51 likely does not directly bind GR, its presence in the protein complex 
induces a conformational change of the ligand-binding pocket that reduces GR hormone 
binding affinity (26, 27). FKBP51 also prevents the nuclear translocation of the GR complex 
that occurs when Hsp90 binds FKBP52 (28). After steroid hormone binding to GR, GR 
translocates to the nucleus where it serves as a regulator of differential gene expression. 
Among other targets, GR can upregulate FKBP51, thereby providing an inhibitory feedback 
mechanism (29, 30). However, other factors contribute to the upregulation of FKBP51 in the 
spinal cord, such as neuronal activity--induced relief of MeCP2 repression [observed both in 
rats (10) and mice (31, 32)] and the decrease in FKBP51 DNA methylation reported here 
and also seen in mice after increased cortisol concentrations (17, 33).
Intact GR signaling is known to be critical to the full development of pain states. Indeed, 
both adrenalectomy and GR knock down in the spinal cord by intrathecal administration of 
siRNA prevent the full development of mechanical hypersensitivity (15). Moreover, the GR 
agonist dexamethasone can unmask the hypersensitive state in injured adrenalectomized 
animals (15). Here, we show that deletion of FKBP51 modulates GR signaling. Indeed, KO 
mice had lower blood glucocorticoid concentrations than did WT animals, as well as lower 
levels of GRβ, the GR isoform upregulated with glucocorticoid resistance (22), suggesting 
that FKBP51 KO mice are more sensitive to glucocorticoids that are WT mice. We propose 
that the up-regulation of FKBP51 after CFA-treatment, together with the subsequent binding 
of FKBP51 to the GR complex, could be a trigger that switches GR from an anti- to a pro- 
nociceptive role. Our data obtained with the GR antagonist mifepristone indicate that GR 
signaling was anti-nociceptive in naïve WT mice but became pro-nociceptive after CFA 
injection and pain state development (Fig.6D and E). We were confident that mifepristone 
acted as an inhibitor of GR since others had reported that injury induced hypersensitivity 
could be reduced by both mifepristone and another more specific GR antagonist, 
dexamethasone 21-mesylate, in mice(16). Our result indicating a change in GR activity is 
consistent with recent data suggesting that GR can switch from an anti-inflammatory state 
under naïve conditions to a pro-inflammatory state after exposure to stressors (34). In 
contrast, after FKBP51 deletion, GR signaling induced a constant anti-nociceptive state (Fig. 
5D, F and G). The rapid effects of the GR antagonist mifepristone reported here are most 
likely to reflect non-genomic activity of GR, such as modulation of the MAPK and PI3K 
signal transduction pathways. However, GR can act both genomically (up-regulation and 
inhibition of gene expression) and non-genomicallyafter activation by glucocorticoids and/or 
post translational modification such as phosphorylation (35). We hypothesised that for 
optimal efficiency, non-genomic and genomic actions of GR worked in concert towards pro- 
or anti-nociceptive signaling at a given time point. That this is the case is supported by our 
finding that the increase in expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 (24), observed 
in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of WT animals after CFA treatment, did not occur in KO mice.

 GR is able to bind to the IL6 promoter sequence in rodent neurones and the GR agonist 
dexamethasone can induce IL6 transcription in these neurones (36). However, GRis known 
to both promote and inhibit the expression of IL6 (34, 25). Gene regulation by GR is indeed 
highly complex and depends on a number of factors including the tissue, the concentration 
of circulating glucocorticoids and GR post-translational modifications.
We also report here that levels of DNA methylation within the FKBP51 DNA promoter 
sequence in the rat spinal cord are significantly lower 7 days after CFA injection. However, 
we have previously shown that there were no significant changes in FKBP51 mRNA 
expression at this time point (9). Thus, changes in DNA methylation are not sufficient to 
change FKBP51 expression in spinal cord but need to be combined with other events, such 
as relief of MeCP2 repression, as we had previously reported (10). . Others have shown that 
stress in early life can induce long term changes in DNA methylation in the FKBP51 
sequence. These modifications lead to a much greater induction of FKBP51 when further 
stress is encountered later on in life) (2). Together with our report of injury induced long 
lasting changes in DNA methylation in the FKBP51 promoter, this offers the interesting 
perspective that FKBP51 might contribute to the excessive hypersensitivity that develops 
after repetitive injuries, both in rodents and humans (37–39).
In conclusion, this study identifies the stress regulator FKBP51 as a key modulator of long-
term pain states. Our finding that the deletion or inhibition of spinal cord FKBP51 does not 
compromise acute pain detection but reduces hypersensitivity in mice with established 
inflammatory pain points to FKBP51 as a possible new target for the treatment of long term 
pain states. FKBP51 inhibition is known to successfully treat mood disorders, but the 
development of FKBP51 antagonists has been challenging (40). New and highly specific 
inhibitors for FKBP51 developed very recently, such as SAFit2 (11), can reduce signs of 
depression in mice in vivo (11) and, as we have shown here, inhibit established injury-
associated mechanical hypersensitivity in mice. The lack of FKBP51 does not seem to 
induce any deleterious side effects; (5) therefore, FKBP51 may be a suitable target for the 
long term treatment that would be required for chronic pain.
Material and methods
Study design
This study represents a series of experiments using multiple molecular and behavioural 
techniques in rodents. In pharmacological studies, mice were randomly assigned to 
experimental groups. The experimenter was always blind to genotype and treatment. While 
the effect size of genotype and drug effects were not predictable, sample sizes in this study 
are consistent with norm in the field(41).
Animals
Subjects in all experiments, except DNA methylation studies, were adult male mice (6-12 
weeks old). WT mice in all siRNA experiments were C57Bl/6J from Harlan Laboratories. In 
the remaining experiments, mice were FKBP51 KO and their WT littermates obtained from 
FKBP51 heterozygous from C.A. Dickey’s group (University of South Florida, USA). These

 mice were from mixed genetic background, C57Bl/6J and Swiss Webster. In the DNA 
methylation studies, adult rats weighing 200-250g and obtained from UCL animal house 
were used. All animals were kept in their home cages in a temperature-controlled (20 ±1 ºC) 
environment, with a light-dark cycle of 12h (light on at 7:30 a.m.) food and water were 
provided ad libitum. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the 
number of animal used (UK Animal Act, 1986).
Genotyping
For genotyping, DNA was extracted from a small portion of ear tissue and the following 
primers were used for the PCR: forward primer (for WT and 51KO): 
AAAGGACAATGACTACTGATGAGG; reverse WT primer: 
AAGGAGGGGTTCTTTTGAGG; reverse 51KO primer: GTTGCACCACAGATGAAACG. 
Samples from WT animals showed a single PCR product of 363bp; samples from KO 
animals showed a single PCR product of 510bp and samples from HET animals would 
present both bands.
Pain models
Inflammatory models (Sham treatment consisted of anesthetizing the animals)
CFA induced ankle joint inflammation: Inflammation was induced by injection of 
Complete Freud’s Adjuvant (CFA; Sigma, UK) at the volume of 5 μl (mice) or 10 μl (rats), 
in the left ankle joint, under isoflurane anesthesia as described (10)
Hindpaw inflammation: Formalin (20 μl, 5%), IL6 (20 μl) and CFA (20 μl) were injected 
with a micro syringe with a 27-gauge needle subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the 
left hind paw of mice. Mice were maintained under isoflurane anaesthesia during the 
injection except for formalin injections.
Neuropathic model: spared nerve injury: The spared nerve injury (SNI) was performed as 
described(18).
Behavioral testing
The experimenter was always blind to genotype and treatment
Von Frey’s hairs—Animals were placed in Plexiglas chambers, located on an elevated 
wire grid, and allowed to habituate for at least 1 hour. After this time, the plantar surface of 
the paw was stimulated with a series of ascending forces Von Frey’s monofilaments. The 
threshold was determined by using the up-down method as described by Chaplan and 
colleagues (42). The data were expressed as log of the mean of the 50% pain threshold ± 
SEM.
Hargreaves test—The latency of foot withdrawal to noxious heat stimuli was measured as 
described (43).

 Formalin behavior—Mice were allowed to habituate to a Plexiglas chamber for at least 
30 minutes. Behavioral testing was initiated immediately after formalin injection and lasted 
60 min. The incidences of licking and biting were counted at intervals of 5 min.
Rotarod test—Motor performance was evaluated by an accelerating rotarod apparatus 
with a 3 cm diameter rod starting at an initial rotation of 4 RPM and slowly accelerating to 
40 RPM over 100 seconds. Mice were expected to walk at the speed of rod rotation to keep 
from falling. The time spent on the rod during each of three trials per day was measured and 
expressed in seconds. Testing was completed when the mouse fell off the rod (i.e. from a 
height of 12 cm).
Intrathecal injections and drugs
The intrathecal injections were performed as described(44). All intrathecally delivered drugs 
were injected in a 2 μl volume. Mifepristone (1 nmol in 2 μl) was purchased from Sigma and 
was dissolved in 10% ethanol in saline. Control animals received 2 μl of 10% ethanol in 
saline. SAFit2 was obtained from Felix Hausch (MPI) and used at a concentration of 
2mg/ml (4 μg in 2 μl), in 4% Ethanol, 5% PEG400, 5% TWEEN 80 in 0.9% saline. Control 
animals received 2 μl of 4% Ethanol, 5% PEG400, 5% TWEEN 80 in 0.9% saline.
siRNA
In vivo silencing of the protein FKBP51 was achieved with a mouse-specific small 
interference RNA (siRNA; Thermo Scientific; SMARTpool E-040262-00-0020). The siRNA 
was reconstituted in RNase-free H2O to a final concentration of 0.5 or 2 μg/μl. Intrathecal 
injection of the siRNA solution (2 μl/mouse) was performed, as described above, for three 
consecutive days according to the experimental protocol. Control treated animals received 2 
μl of Accell Non-targeting Pool (D-001910-10-20) prepared in the same concentrations as 
the targeting siRNA. Intrathecally delivered siRNA reached the spinal cord (Fig. S7) and the 
siRNA treatment was optimized to 1 daily injection on 3 consecutive days of 4 µg siRNA.
Blood sampling and corticosterone assay
Blood was collected in the morning between 9:00 to 11:00 from mice tail vein. Before 
sampling, mice were placed in a warming cabinet (39°C for 10 to 15 min) in order to dilate 
the blood vessel. The levels of corticosterone were measured using an ELISA kit (ab108821, 
Abcam) following the manufacturer protocol.
RNA preparation and RT-qPCR
For fresh tissue collection, animals were terminally anesthetized with CO2 3 d after CFA or 
sham surgery. Total RNA was extracted using an acid phenol extraction method (TRIzol 
reagent, RNeasy mini-colums; Quiagen) and cDNA obtained as described (10). Reactions 
were performed at least in triplicate and the specificity of the products was determined by 
melting curve analysis. The ratio of the relative expression of target genes to β-actin was 
calculated by using the 2ΔCt formula. Efficiencies of qPCRs were calculated for each gene 
using serial dilution.

 DNA methylation analysis
DNA extraction and bisulphite treatment: DNA was isolated from dorsal horn quadrants of 
rat spinal cord (see Fresh tissue collection) using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). 
Bisulphite conversion of 100ng of genomic DNA was achieved through use of the Epitect 
bisulfite kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PCR and Pyrosequencing: Details of PCR and pyrosequencing can be found in 
Supplementary Material.
Immunohistochemistry and western blot
Immunohistochemistry and western blot were performed as described (10). For details see 
Supplementary Material.
Data analysis
All statistical tests were performed in IBM SPSS statistic 20. For the behavioral 
experiments, statistical analysis was performed on the data normalized by log transformation 
(Von Frey data; as suggested by Mills et al. (45)) or raw data, as presented in the figures. 
Behavioural data were also presented and analysed without log transformation and 
statistically significant effects for all groups were also observed with data presented as Von 
Frey force in grams (Fig.S8). The significance of any differences in sensitivity was assessed 
using repeated-measured two-way or one-way ANOVA, as appropriate. In all cases, a 
significant effect of the main factor(s), or interactions between them, was taken as the 
criterion for progressing to post hoc analysis. Bonferroni analysis was the preferred post-hoc 
analysis; however, if the general ANOVA was significant but no Bonferroni significance 
observed, we also reported the results of the LSD post-hoc analysis. In all cases ‘time’ was 
treated as a within subjects factor and ‘genotype’ and ‘treatment’ were treated as between 
subject factors. For the RTqPCR experiments, data were analysed by univariate analysis for 
individual genes followed by the appropriate post-hoc analysis (as above). Biological 
samples for the DNA methylation experiments (n=6 in each group) and the measures of 
glucocorticoid levels (n=4 in each group) were analysed twice and data of the technical 
replicates were examined by nested ANOVA.
