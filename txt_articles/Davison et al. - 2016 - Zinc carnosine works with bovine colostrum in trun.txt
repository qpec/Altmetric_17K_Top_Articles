ABSTRACT
Background: Heavy exercise causes gut symptoms and, in extreme
cases, heat stroke that is due to the increased intestinal permeability
of luminal toxins.
Objective: We examined whether zinc carnosine (ZnC), a health-
food product taken alone or in combination with bovine colostrum
(a natural source of growth factors), would moderate such effects.
Design: Eight volunteers completed a 4-arm, double-blind,
placebo-controlled crossover protocol (14 d of placebo, ZnC, co-
lostrum, or ZnC plus colostrum) before undertaking standardized
exercise 2 and 14 d after the start of treatment. Changes in epi-
thelial resistance, apoptosis signaling molecules, and tight junc-
tion (TJ) protein phosphorylation in response to a 28C rise in body
temperature were determined with the use of Caco-2 and HT29
intestinal cells.
Results: Body temperature increased 28C, and gut permeability (5-h
urinary lactulose:rhamnose ratios) increased 3-fold after exercise
(from 0.32 6 0.016 baseline to 1.0 6 0.017 at 14 d; P , 0.01).
ZnC or colostrum truncated the rise by 70% after 14 d of treatment.
The combination treatment gave an additional benefit, and truncated
exercise induced increase at 2 d (30% reduction; P , 0.01). A 28C
temperature rise in in vitro studies caused the doubling of apo-
ptosis and reduced epithelial resistance 3–4-fold. ZnC or colos-
trum truncated these effects (35–50%) with the greatest
response seen with the combination treatment (all P , 0.01).
Mechanisms of action included increasing heat shock protein 70
and truncating temperature-induced changes in B cell leukemia/
lymphoma-2 associated X protein a and B cell lymphoma 2.
ZnC also increased total occludin and reduced phosphorylated
tyrosine claudin, phosphorylated tyrosine occludin, and phos-
phorylated serine occludin, thereby enhancing the TJ formation
and stabilization.
Conclusion: ZnC, taken alone or with colostrum, increased epithe-
lial resistance and the TJ structure and may have value for athletes
and in the prevention of heat stroke in military personnel. This trial
was registered at www.isrctn.com as ISRCTN51159138.

INTRODUCTION
Several stresses affect the integrity of the intestinal barrier
including prolonged strenuous exercise (1), heat stress (2), and
drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)9
(3). A loss of intestinal integrity may result in the passage of
luminal endotoxins into the circulation, thereby causing an in-
flammatory cascade and an exacerbating loss of barrier function.
These developments can result in severe systemic effects (4) such
as an exertional heat stroke, which is associated with hyperther-
mia, multiorgan failure, and endotoxemia. Similar processes have
relevance for many athletes who are involved in heavy exercise,
such as long-distance running, in which gastrointestinal symptoms
including cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and bleeding are commonly
reported (5, 6). These symptoms are probably due to a combina-
tion of reduced splanchnic blood flow (7), hormonal changes,
altered gut permeability, and increased body temperature.
Pharmacologic options to reduce these problems are limited
particularly in competitive athletics. Therefore, there is interest in
the use of natural or naturally derived products. One product that
is already commercially available is zinc carnosine (ZnC), in
which zinc and carnosine are linked in a polymeric one-to-one
ratio, and is currently marketed as a zinc dietary supplement with
“added value for gastric health.” The combination of zinc with

 carnosine has potential advantages over simple zinc supple-
mentation because carnosine is a dipeptide (comprising b-alanine
and L-histidine) that is naturally present in long-living cells such
as muscle and nerves, where, among other actions, it probably
has a role as an antioxidant (8).
We previously showed ZnC stimulates several aspects of the
gut mucosal integrity including stimulating cell migration and
proliferation in vitro and reducing the amount of gastric and
small-intestinal injury caused by NSAIDs in rats and mice (9).
Furthermore, with the use of normal volunteers, we showed that
ZnC prevented the rise in gut permeability caused by clinical
doses of the NSAID indomethacin (9). However, the potential
value of ZnC in decreasing gut permeability associated with
heavy exercise and its mechanism of actions are unknown.
In the current study, we examined the effect of oral ZnC on gut
permeability and an exercise-induced temperature rise in subjects
who were undertaking heavy exercise and compared effects of
ZnC alone with those of taking ZnC in combination with bovine
colostrum, which is a rich source of growth factors and immune
modulators (10). Our previous studies that used colostrum alone
showed a benefit in reducing exercise-induced increased gut
permeability in athletes but only after prolonged (14 d) admin-
istration (11). Therefore, colostrum given alone also provided
a useful positive control.
To examine some of the mechanisms by which protective
effects were mediated, we performed a series of in vitro studies
with the use of 2 human intestinal cell lines with the focus on the
effect of a temperature rise to 398C (similar to that shown in
athletes who underwent the in vivo studies) on apoptosis, epi-
thelial barrier resistance, the expression of heat shock protein 70
(Hsp70), and tight junction (TJ) proteins in the presence and
absence of test compounds.

 METHODS
This trial was registered at www.isrctn.com as ISRCTN51159138.
Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated.
Clinical study: effect of ZnC and colostrum on exercise-
induced changes in human gut permeability
ZnC (Hamari–Xsto Solutions) and indistinguishable placebo
capsules were used for the clinical study. Colostrum (Neovite-
brand lactose-reduced colostrum) and the placebo were provided
by Colostrum UK. The placebo that was used in place of co-
lostrum was an isoenergetic and isomacronutrient milk-protein
concentrate at an 80% protein content (principally casein) and
was indistinguishable in appearance and taste from the colostrum
powder, which was the form administered.
Ethical approval
All procedures were conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki. Ethics approval was obtained from the Aberystwyth
University Ethics Committee.
Subjects
Eight healthy men took part in the study, and all subjects were
active individuals who exercised regularly $4 times/wk (4
participants were runners, one participant was a cyclist, one
participant was a lacrosse player, one participant was a foot-
baller, and one participant was a rugby player). Physical vari-
ables were as follows: mean age: 25 y (range: 19–33 y); mean 6

before participating in each test. V

were performed with the use of standard methods, as reported
previously (9), on day 25 of each arm to ensure the consistency of
the 80% of the V
:
O2 max protocol on days 2 and 14 (Figures 1
and 2).
Preparation of subjects for exercise study
Subjects completed a 24-h food diary on the day before the
main exercise trial in the first arm of the trial and repeated this diet
in the subsequent arms. All trials were performed after an
overnight fast $10 h. Subjects reported at 0700 for all trials and
self-positioned a rectal thermistor (Grant Instruments) 10 cm
beyond the anal sphincter and positioned a telemetric heart-rate
monitor transmitter band (Polar S610i; Polar Electro Oy). The
core temperature was recorded with the use of an electronic data
logger (Squirrel SQ2020; Grant Instruments).
Subjects sat for 10 min before a baseline venous blood sample
(pre-exercise) was taken. Subjects ran on the treadmill with a 1%
grade for 20 min at a constant speed that was equivalent to 80% of
the V
:
O2 max as determined from preliminary tests. Expired gas
was analyzed during exercise with the use of an online breath-
by-breath system (Jaeger Oxycon Pro.). The core body tempera-
ture, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion were recorded
every 5 min during the trial. After completing the run, subjects
were quickly seated, and a second blood sample (postexercise)
was obtained (within 5 min). Subjects emptied their bladders
before consuming the intestinal permeability test drink and
commencing with a 5-h urine collection to determine intestinal
permeability.
Study design
In a 4-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
crossover design, subjects received oral supplementation 2 times/d for
14 d with a 14-d washout period between each study arm
(Figures 1 and 2). Each arm was administered in a randomized
fashion with the use of the web site randomization.com (4 3 4
blocks). Timing was based on our previous studies that used
this type of protocol that had shown the sufficient amount of
time to ensure baseline permeability values returned back to
normal (11).

 V
:
O2 max was assessed on day 25 for each arm of the study.
Gut-permeability assessments were performed under nonexercise
conditions on days 22 and 0 (to confirm a stable baseline) and
immediately after the standardized exercise (treadmill running for
20 min at 80% of the V
:
O2 max) protocol on days 2 and 14.
Oral supplements consisted of 37.5 mg ZnC + 10 g placebo,
10 g bovine colostrum + placebo capsule, 37.5 mg ZnC + 10 g
bovine colostrum, and 10 g placebo + placebo capsule, each of
which were taken 2 times/d. The capsules (ZnC) and powder
(colostrum) or their placebo equivalents were taken just before
breakfast or the evening meal. The doses were chosen on the basis
of the results of pilot in vitro studies (Supplemental Material 1,
Supplemental Figure 1).
Analytic methods
Intestinal permeability was assessed with the use of our pre-
viously published protocol, equipment, and methods (11). Results
are expressed as simple AUC ratios as described by us previously
(11) and also as the ratio of the percentage of ingested sugar
excreted in the urine as has been used by some other groups (12).
In vitro studies
To investigate mechanisms by which test compounds influ-
enced gut permeability in the clinical study, we performed
a series of experiments that examined the effect of a 28C rise
(from 378C to 398C).
Cell lines
HT29 is derived from the colorectal adenocarcinoma of
a 44-y-old Caucasian woman (American Type Culture Collec-
tion) (13). Caco-2 is derived from the colorectal adenocarcinoma
of a 72-y-old man (American Type Culture Collection) and
exhibits TJs and desmosomes between adjacent cells and grows
as polarized monolayers (14).
Transepithelial permeability assays
The influence of temperature changes on transepithelial per-
meability in the presence and absence of test factors were de-
termined with the use of 2 different methods. One method
determined changes in the transepithelial electrical resistance
with the use of our previously published methods (11). The other
method analyzed the passage of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
across the epithelial layer with the use of standard methods (15).
To enhance any effects shown, the previously detailed experi-
ments were also performed in low-calcium medium (0.9 mmol/L)
in addition to normal-calcium medium (1.7 mmol/L).
Hsp70 assay
Effects of the temperature change and various test factors on
cell lysate Hsp70 concentrations were determined with the use of
our previously published methods (11) with a Duoset Elisa kit
(DYC1663-2; R&D Systems Europe).
Cell apoptosis assays
Effects of the temperature change and various test factors on
cell lysate concentrations of active caspase-3 (an effector cas-
pase) and caspase-9 (an initiator caspase) were determined
according to methods that were previously described (11) with
the use of commercial colorimetric assay kits (BF3100 and
BF10100; R&D Systems). In addition, Western blots were per-
formed with the use of caspase-3 (sc-7272; Santa Cruz Bio-
technology Inc.) and caspase-9 (sc-81589; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies that are capable of detecting both
procaspase and active caspase. Films were scanned, and the mean
signal density of each band was determined with the use of the

Concentrations of the antiapoptotic protein B cell lymphoma 2
(Bcl-2) and the proapoptotic protein B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2
associated X protein-a (Baxa) were determined in the same cell
lysates as was used for caspase analyses with the use of Duoset
ELISA kits (DYC827B-2 and DYC820-2, respectively; R&D
Systems Europe Ltd).
TJ protein and phosphorylation assessments
Effects of the temperature change were assessed with the use of
standard assays and commercial kits [occludin, zona occludens
protein 1 (ZO1), and claudin-1 (TJ antibody samples pack 90–
1200; Invitrogen)], tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphory-
lation concentrations were measured with the use of a standard
ELISA (antiphosphothreonine ab9337, antiphosphotyrosine
ab9318, and antiphosphoserine ab9332; Abcam). In addition,
Western blot analyses were performed for total occludin, ZO1,
and claudin-1 with the use of a commercial kit (35050; Thermo
Scientific). Immunocomplexes were prepared from lysates by
incubation with the relevant TJ antibody and analyzed by
Western blot analysis with the use of antiphosphothreonine,
antiphosphotyrosine, or antiphosphoserine and a commercial kit
(35050; Thermo Scientific). Films were scanned, and the mean
signal density of each band was determined with the use of the
Adobe Photoshop program.
Statistical analyses
All values are expressed as means 6 SEMs unless otherwise
stated. For in vitro studies, a JMP statistical package (SAS
version 10) was used to perform a 3-factor ANOVA with tem-
perature, treatment, and time as factors. For the clinical study,
a 3-factor ANOVA with treatment (arm), permeability, and time
as factors was performed. When a significant effect was seen
(P , 0.05), individual comparisons were performed with the use
of t tests on the basis of the group means, residual, and df
obtained from the ANOVA, which is a method that is equivalent
to repeated-measures analyses (11).

 After 2 d of treatment, the ingestion of ZnC alone or of co-
lostrum alone did not significantly reduce the rise in exercise-
induced permeability compared with that with the placebo. In
contrast, the ingestion of ZnC plus colostrum attenuated this
increase in permeability by 30% (compared with the other
treatment-group arms at the same time point, P , 0.01).
After 14 d of treatment, the increase in permeability caused by
exercise was reduced by 71% in the ZnC-alone arm, by 68% in
the colostrum-alone arm, and by 85% in the ZnC plus colostrum
arm (compared with placebo at same time point, all P , 0.01)
(Figure 3). ZnC plus colostrum was significantly better at
truncating the rise in permeability induced by exercise than was
the use of colostrum alone (P , 0.05), and although it had
a greater reductive effect than with the use of ZnC alone, this
difference was NS at the ,0.05 level (P = 0.069). The order in
which the arms were administered did not influence results
(although numbers were too small to perform a detailed statis-
tical analysis).
In vitro studies
Transepithelial permeability
Results of the examination of electrical resistance (Figure 4A)
or the passage of HRP (Figure 4B) confirmed the protective
effects of the test substances. With the use of this protocol, the
combination of ZnC plus colostrum resulted in a significant
beneficial effect (77% attenuation of increased permeability
caused by the temperature rise), which was greater than that
seen when cells were incubated with either ZnC (52% attenua-
tion) or colostrum (41% attenuation) given alone (Figure 4).
Apoptosis
Both the ELISA and Western blot analyses showed that in-
creasing the incubation temperature caused an w2-fold increase
in active caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression at the 8-h time
points (Supplemental Figure 3, Figure 5). The addition of
ZnC, colostrum, or ZnC plus colostrum had no significant effect
on caspase expression when incubated at 378C. However, the co-
presence of ZnC, colostrum, or ZnC plus colostrum significantly
reduced caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression compared with that
of cells grown in medium alone at 398C (all P , 0.01). These
changes were specific because they were not seen when the
capase-3 or caspase-9 inhibitor was added to the cells (Sup-
plemental Figure 4).
The 28C rise caused an increased Baxa concentration from
578.6 6 16.7 to 797.4 6 29.7 pg/mL (P , 0.01) at the 4-h time
point (Figure 6A). The addition of ZnC alone did not affect Baxa
expression at either 378C or 398C, whereas colostrum alone re-
duced the temperature-induced rise in Baxa. A significant further
decrease in the Baxa concentration was seen when ZnC and co-
lostrum were added together at 398C (compared with ZnC alone,
P , 0.01) (Figure 6A). Similar results were seen after 8 h (data
not shown).
The 28C rise resulted in a decrease of Bcl-2 concentrations
from 350 6 2 to 292 6 2 pg/mL (P , 0.01) after 4 h (Figure
6B). The addition of ZnC, colostrum, or the combination did not
affect Bcl-2 concentrations at 378C. At 398C, the presence of
ZnC or colostrum alone significantly attenuated the temperature-
induced decrease in Bcl-2 concentrations, and an additive,
synergistic effect was seen when ZnC and colostrum were added
together, which completely prevented the temperature-induced
decline in Bcl-2. Similar results were seen after 8 h (data not
shown).

alone or with ZnC, colostrum, or ZnC plus colostrum. Changes in apoptosis
were determined with the use of active caspase-3 (A) and caspase-9 (B)
assay kits after changes in the A405. Studies were also analyzed with the
use of Western analysis and showed similar results (Supplemental Figure 3).
Data were analyzed with the use of a 3-factor ANOVA followed by t tests on
the basis of the group means, residual, and df obtained from the ANOVA.

 Raising the incubation temperature caused increased Hsp70
concentrations from 139 61 to 181 6 3 pg/mL (P , 0.01) after
4 h (Figure 6C). The addition of ZnC or colostrum alone in-
creased Hsp70 concentrations at both 378C and 398C above the
values seen in cells grown in medium alone (all P , 0.05).
Compared with giving either test compound alone, additional
increases were shown when ZnC and colostrum were added
together in cells at 398C at both time points (Figure 6C, D).
TJ protein expression and phosphorylation
Because results at 4 h were similar to those at 8 h, they are
reported together.
ZO1
Total ZO1 increased in response to the temperature rise
and were not affected by test factors (Figure 7A). Phos-
phorylated tyrosine (p-Tyr) ZO1 was reduced by the
temperature rise and presence of colostrum, and the com-
bination treatment reduced concentrations further (Figure
7B). Phosphorylated serine (p-Ser) ZO1 was reduced by
the temperature rise. The co-presence of test factors in-
creased p-Ser–ZO1 concentrations at both 378C and 398C
(Figure 7C). Analyses with the use of Western blotting
and densitometry showed similar results (Supplemental

 Occludin
Total occludin increased in response to the temperature rise.
The presence of ZnC, colostrum, or the combination all increased
total occludin concentrations at 378C. At 398C, all test factors
caused additional rises in total occludin concentrations com-
pared with those of cells in medium alone (Figure 8A). The
increased temperature caused p-Tyr occludin to rise, but the
presence of test factors reduced p-Tyr–occludin concentrations
at both 378C and 398C with the largest fall shown in cells treated
with ZnC plus colostrum (Figure 8B). p-Ser–occludin concen-
trations were reduced in response to the temperature rise, and
the presence of test factors caused further reductions in p-Ser-
occludin ratios with the largest fall shown with the combination
treatment (Figure 8C). Analyses with the use of Western blot-
ting and densitometry showed similar results (Supplemental
Figure 6).
Claudin-1
Total claudin-1 was not affected by the temperature change or
test factors (Figure 9A). p-Tyr–claudin-1 concentrations rose in
response to the temperature increase, and there was a small but
significant truncation of the rise in the presence of ZnC alone or
in combination with colostrum (Figure 9B). p-Ser claudin-1 was
not significantly affected by the temperature rise or the presence
of test factors (Figure 9C). Analyses with the use of Western
blotting and densitometry showed similar results (Supplemental
Figure 7).
DISCUSSION
With the use of a combination of a clinical trial and in vitro
experiments, we showed that ZnC attenuated the exercise-
induced increase in gut permeability through mechanisms that
included reducing temperature-induced apoptosis, the induction
of Hsp70, and the modulation of TJ protein expression and
phosphorylation. Enhanced results were shown when the ZnC
was co-administered with the other natural bioactive nutriceutical
product bovine colostrum.
Numerous exercise protocols are used by exercise physiologists.
We chose a 20-min run at 80% of the V
:
O2 max protocol because
we had previous experience with this protocol (11), which allowed
a crossover-study design to be used in a relatively short period,
reliably increased gut permeability 2–3-fold, and increased the
core temperature by 1.5–28C. The assessment of intestinal per-
meability by quantitating unmediated absorption of $2 sugars of
different sizes provided a sensitive index of intestinal damage as
we and others have previously shown (11, 12, 16).
The subject V
:
O2 max and speed at 80% of the V
:
O2 max
remained consistent for all arms, and similar exercise-induced
changes in core temperatures were observed in each study arm.
Therefore, the protective effect of test substances could not be
attributed to the changing core temperature during the exercise.
Gut permeability increased 3-fold in response to exercise in the
placebo control arm as expected with the use of this protocol
(11). These changes in gut permeability were similar to those
reported by us previously in subjects who ingested clinically
relevant doses of the NSAID indomethacin (9), which is known
to cause a small intestinal injury (17).

 Similar levels of protection, as determined by gut permeability,
were seen when either ZnC or colostrum was administered alone
with no protective effect shown after 2 d of treatment but with
a reduction in permeability values by 70% after 14 d of treatment.
At this 14-d time point, an additional advantage was shown with
the combination treatment, and possibly more importantly, in
regards to the use by athletes or military personnel who are
entering a high-temperature environment, the combination
treatment also attenuated the exercise-induced gut permeability
after only 2 d of treatment.
We undertook a series of in vitro studies to examine the effect
of the core-temperature rise on gut integrity in a controlled
environment. We used 2 well-validated complementary models to
examine changes in transepithelial resistance by following the
changes in electrical resistance (11) and the passage of a large
molecule (HRP) across polarized monolayers of human colonic
cancer cells (15). We have the experience of studying the effects
of proteins in these systems, and the use of these in vitro models
removes confounding factors such as changes in blood flow. The
results were consistent with those of the clinical trial; the tem-
perature rise was associated with increased permeability, but this
effect could be attenuated by the presence of ZnC, colostrum, or
ZnC plus colostrum with greatest effects shown with the com-
bination treatment. These effects were likely to be due, at least in
part, to effects on the paracellular permeability such as the al-
teration in TJs (18) and changes in apoptosis.
A temperature rise is a well-known trigger of apoptosis (11),
and we measured active caspase-3 and caspase-9 to examine
potential effects of the test compounds. We showed that this 28C
rise was sufficient to increase apoptosis, and ZnC truncated this
response possibly by maintaining concentrations of the anti-
apoptotic protein Bcl-2. An additive effect was seen in the
maintenance of Bcl-2 when ZnC and colostrum were added
together.
Heat shock proteins maintain cellular homeostasis during
normal cell growth and enhance survival during and after various
cellular stresses (19). An increased expression of heat shock
proteins may be one mechanism through which thermotolerance
occurs in animals and cells (20). Hsp70 is increased in response to
temperature rises as a homeostatic mechanism for maintaining
viability under conditions that increase the accumulation of
damaged proteins. Our finding that ZnC induced Hsp70 ex-
pression at 378C and caused additional increases when added at
398C suggested that this pathway may have relevance with our
results. Our in vitro results were shown by reproducing the
temperature rise seen in the clinical study (to w398C) and in
most athletes during standard performance rather than at the
typical 41.58C that has been used in rat models of hyperthermia
that results in a massive breakdown of mucosal integrity.
Intestinal epithelial TJs are multiprotein complexes that
connect adjacent cells on apical and lateral membranes and act as
selective barriers. TJ integrity is regulated by the assembly of
extracellular loops of transmembrane proteins occludin and
claudin and several intracellular plaque proteins such as ZO1,
which link to the actin cytoskeleton. TJ function is regulated by
changes in both absolute amounts and the degree of phosphor-
ylation at specific residues. In general terms, the increased ex-
pression of occludin, claudin, or ZO1 increases TJ formation and
resistance (for a good overview, see references 21 and 22).
Therefore, increased total occludin in response to ZnC can be

 considered potentially beneficial. Tyrosine phosphorylation of
any of the 3 TJ proteins assessed hinders TJ formation, thereby
reducing epithelial resistance. Therefore, the reduction of p-Tyr
concentrations of claudin and occludin by ZnC should enhance
the TJ formation, although, in the current study, the changes in
claudin phosphorylation in response to treatment were small and,
therefore, of unclear significance. Similarly, because ZnC re-
duced the phosphorylation of serine in occludin, TJ formation
should also be enhanced.
We showed that the overall effect of giving bovine colostrum
or ZnC alone were similar in reducing exercise-induced per-
meability. Both compounds increased Hsp70 concentrations and
reduced heat-induced apoptosis although the signaling processes
were somewhat different with colostrum but not with ZnC,
whereby there was a reduction in the temperature-induced rise in
Baxa concentrations. Analyses of TJ modulation also showed
broadly similar results in phosphorylation effects on the TJ
proteins although some differences, such as reduced p-Tyr of
ZO1 by colostrum but not by ZnC were shown.
There is currently a demand by the general public for more
natural types of products, which are often termed alternative or
complementary therapies or nutriceuticals (from nutrition and
pharmaceuticals). Because of their natural origin, the general
public often assume that they are safe and may take high doses for
prolonged periods. However, caution needs to be taken because
there is biological activity in many of these products such as
colostrum, which is rich in multiple growth factors (23).
Therefore, general principals of the use of the lowest dose for the
shortest time possible seem appropriate. In the current studies,
ZnC was administered at 37.5 mg 2 times/d, which provided
a total daily dose of 16 mg Zn/d. Current recommendations for
daily zinc intake are 5.5–9.5 mg (for men) and 4–7 mg (for
women) from a United Kingdom food-standards authority and
11 mg (for men) and 8 mg (for women) from the US NIH with
daily upper recommended limits being 25 mg/d in the United
Kingdom and 40 mg/d in the United States. Therefore, the
regimen that was used in the current studies was well within the
safety guidelines.
The findings of additive or synergistic effects (dependent on the
variable measured) were particularly relevant in the clinical study
because it was only the combination treatment that was effective
after 2 d of treatment. This result suggests that short courses taken
for a few days before embarking on prolonged heavy exercise
(such as athletic events or military maneuvers in hot climates)
could provide optimal results while minimizing dosing. Additional
studies appear warranted to explore these findings. These trials
could include the examination of athletes undertaking prolonged
strenuous exercise such as a marathon, in which case it would also
be of interest to examine blood endotoxin concentrations. It would
also be of interest to examine additional markers of cellular in-
tegrity and enterocyte permeability such as intestinal fatty acid-
binding protein although it seems likely that later blood samples
and a potentially a longer exercise protocol than was used in our
studies would be required to show such changes (24). Additional
studies could also include the relevance of hypoxia on paracellular
and cellular integrity when cells are stressed by hypoxia alone and
in combination with temperature rises.
In conclusion, our current studies focusing on temperature
changes build on previous work that showed ZnC prevents NSAID
gut damage. Therefore, it would be of interest to examine the
