Objective. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of
ABT-494, a selective JAK-1 inhibitor, in patients with
moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an
inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX).
Methods. Three hundred RA patients receiving
stable doses of MTX were randomly assigned equally to
receive immediate-release ABT-494 at 3, 6, 12, or 18 mg
twice daily, 24 mg once daily, or placebo for 12 weeks. The
primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients
meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20%
improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) at
week 12, as determined using the last observation carried
forward method.
Results. At week 12, the proportion of ACR20
responses was higher with ABT-494 (62%, 68%, 80%, 64%,
and 76% for the 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mg doses, respectively)
than with placebo (46%) (using nonresponder imputation)
(P < 0.05 for the 6, 12, and 24 mg doses). There was a sig-
nificant dose-response relationship among all ABT-494
doses (P < 0.001). The proportions of patients achieving
ACR50 and ACR70 responses were significantly higher for
all ABT-494 doses (except the 12 mg dose for the ACR70
response) than for placebo, as were changes in the Disease
Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein
level (DAS28-CRP). Rapid improvement was demon-
strated by significant differences in ACR20 response rates
and changes in the DAS28-CRP for all doses compared
with placebo at week 2 (the first postbaseline visit). The
incidence of adverse events was similar across groups;
most were mild, and infections were the most frequent.
One serious infection (community-acquired pneumonia)
occurred with ABT-494 at 12 mg. There were dose-
dependent increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but the
LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratios were unchanged
through week 12. Mean hemoglobin levels remained

 stable at lower doses, but decreases were observed at
higher doses.
Conclusion. This study evaluated a broad range
of doses of ABT-494 in RA patients with an inadequate
response to MTX. ABT-494 demonstrated efficacy, with
a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of other
JAK inhibitors.
JAKs are essential components of intracellular
signaling pathways of various cytokines that are involved
in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (1–3).
The roles of JAK-1 and JAK-2 are diverse, including
host defense, hematopoiesis, growth, and neural develop-
ment. JAK-3 and Tyk-2 play an essential role in immune
responses (3). Inhibition of JAK-1 has been associated
with reductions in proinflammatory cytokines, such as
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferons a, b, and g, and
thereby with control of inflammation. Selective inhibition
of JAK-1 might possibly enhance efficacy and reduce
undesirable effects associated with inhibition of JAK-2,
JAK-3, and Tyk-2. Small molecules that inhibit JAKs
(including JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and Tyk-2) with varying
selectivity have been approved or are currently in develop-
ment for treatment of RA. Tofacitinib, which primarily
inhibits JAK-3 and JAK-1 and, to a lesser extent, JAK-2,
was shown to be effective in RA patients with inadequate
responses to methotrexate (MTX) and anti–tumor necro-
sis factor (anti-TNF) agents as well as in MTX-naive RA
patients (4–7), as was baricitinib, a JAK-1/2 inhibitor (8,9).
ABT-494 is currently in development to treat
active RA in adult patients. ABT-494 is a JAK inhibitor
with enhanced selectivity for JAK-1 compared with JAK-2
(;74-fold higher, with a 50% inhibition concentration
[IC50] of 8 nM compared with 600 nM, respectively) in cel-
lular assays, and with enhanced selectivity for JAK-1
compared with JAK-3 (;58-fold higher, with an IC50 of
40 nM compared with 2.3 mM, respectively) in biochemical
assays (10,11). This increased selectivity potentially offers
an improved benefit–risk profile in patients with RA.
Herein, we present results from the 12-week dose-ranging
BALANCE II study, which evaluated the safety and
efficacy of immediate-release ABT-494 (3, 6, 12, and
18 mg twice daily and 24 mg once daily) versus placebo in
adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who
had shown an inadequate response to MTX therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients. Patients were eligible if they were $18 years
of age with active RA, fulfilled either the American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 revised classification criteria (12) or
the ACR/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 classifi-
cation criteria (13) for $3 months, and had active disease despite
treatment with MTX. Active disease was defined as having $6
swollen joints (based on a 66-joint count) and $6 tender joints
(based on a 68-joint count) and either a high-sensitivity C-reac-
tive protein (hsCRP) level greater than the upper limit of normal
(ULN) (5 mg/liter) or seropositivity for both rheumatoid factor
and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide. Eligible patients had been
receiving MTX for $3 months, with a stable dose (7.5–25 mg/
week) for $4 weeks (maximum tolerated dose after complete
titration) before baseline. All other oral disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) had to be discontinued for a
prespecified duration before baseline to ensure appropriate
washout. All patients either had a negative tuberculosis screen-
ing assessment or, if assessments indicated latent tuberculosis
infection, had completed at least 2 weeks of ongoing tuberculosis
prophylaxis or had documented completion of a full course of
tuberculosis prophylaxis before baseline. Patients were excluded
if they had received JAK inhibitor therapy or any other investiga-
tional or approved biologic RA therapy.
Study design. BALANCE II was a phase IIb, 12-week,
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled
study initiated in March 2014, with the last patient completing
the study in July 2015. The study was conducted at 63 sites, 59 of
which enrolled patients. Geographic regions were defined as
Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia,
Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Turkey, and Ukraine), Latin/South
America (including Chile and Mexico), Western Europe (Spain),
the United States, Israel, Puerto Rico, and South Africa.
Treatment. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1:1:1
in a double-blinded manner to receive immediate-release oral
doses of ABT-494 at 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg, or 18 mg twice daily, or
24 mg once daily, or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks, using an
interactive voice/web response system according to a blocked
randomization schedule generated by the AbbVie statistics
department. Investigators, patients, and other study personnel
were blinded to treatment assignments throughout the study.
Patients continued their stable dose of background MTX
during the study and were to take a dietary supplement of oral
folic acid (or equivalent) from 4 weeks before baseline and
during the study. Concurrent treatment was permitted with
stable doses of other, non-DMARD background RA therapy,
including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, acetaminophen,
oral corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone at #10 mg/day), and
low-potency opiates. Patients who completed the 12-week random-
ized controlled study completed a 30-day follow-up visit or had the
option to enter an open-label extension study.
The study was conducted according to the guidelines of
the International Conference on Harmonisation, applicable
regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct, and
the Declaration of Helsinki. All study-related documents were
reviewed and approved by independent ethics committees and
institutional review boards. All patients provided written informed
consent before participating in study-related procedures.
Efficacy assessments. The primary end point was the
proportion of patients who met the ACR 20% improvement cri-
teria (achieved an ACR20 response) (14) at week 12. Secondary
end points included the proportions of patients achieving
ACR50 and ACR70 responses at week 12, the proportion of
patients achieving a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (15) using
the CRP level (DAS28-CRP) of #3.2 or ,2.6 at week 12, and
the proportion of patients achieving low disease activity or clini-
cal remission based on Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)
(16) criteria (CDAI score #10 indicates low disease activity;
CDAI score #2.8 indicates clinical remission). We also assessed
improvements in individual components of the ACR core set of
2858
GENOVESE ET AL
 disease activity measures (17), change in the DAS28-CRP,
change in the CDAI score over 12 weeks, and the proportion of
patients achieving a minimum clinically important difference
(MCID) of 20.22 on the Health Assessment Questionnaire dis-
ability index (HAQ DI) (18,19) at week 12. Changes in the Sim-
plified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) (20) and in the proportion
of patients who had an ACR20 response at every visit (at weeks
2, 4, 6, 8, and 12) were calculated post hoc.
Laboratory analyses were conducted by a central labo-
ratory. After study completion and database lock, the central
laboratory informed AbbVie that one lot of the reagent used to
detect hsCRP had expired early (Roche lot 604450) and resulted
in underreporting by 3–13% (,0.1–0.4 mg/liter) of a subset of
samples with levels below the ULN (14% of week 12 samples).
We performed sensitivity analyses on the affected samples using
a larger-than-expected correction factor (20% inflation) (for
ACR20/ACR50/ACR70 response rates, response rates for low
disease activity and clinical remission according to the DAS28-
CRP, and hsCRP level over time as a continuous variable).
Safety assessments. Adverse events (AEs), vital signs,
physical examination findings, and laboratory test results were
evaluated at each scheduled visit during treatment and for 30
days after the last dose of study drug. Coding of AEs was based
on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version
17.1. AE severity and postbaseline changes in laboratory test
results were described according to The Rheumatology Com-
mon Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0, developed by the Outcome
Measures in Rheumatology Drug Safety Working Group (21).
An independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee was
used for blinded assessment of potential cardiovascular AEs.
Statistical analysis.
All efficacy analyses were con-
ducted in the modified intent-to-treat population, which con-
sisted of all randomized patients who had received at least 1
dose of study drug. The last observation carried forward
(LOCF) method was used as the primary missing data imputa-
tion method for ACR response rates. Efficacy results were fur-
ther assessed using nonresponder imputation (NRI), and
these data are also presented. LOCF missing data imputation
was used for continuous end points such as the DAS28-CRP,
while binary end points including ACR response rates were
analyzed using a chi-square test with normal approximation
when comparing each ABT-494 treatment group to the pla-
cebo group. Continuous end points were analyzed using an
analysis of covariance model with treatment group as a factor
and baseline measurement as the covariate. The multiple com-
parison procedure and modeling method was used to detect
any nonflat dose-response relationship by evaluating several
nonlinear dose-response models at the same time. P values

 were not corrected for multiple comparisons. A sample of 270
patients (45 per randomized treatment group) was targeted
to give 80% power to detect a difference of 30% in the
primary efficacy end point (ACR20 response rate at week 12),
assuming that the response rate would be 30% in the placebo
group and 60% in at least 1 of the ABT-494 dose groups.
RESULTS
Patient disposition and baseline characteris-
tics.
Three hundred patients were randomized, and 299
patients received at least 1 dose of either placebo (n5 50)
or immediate-release ABT-494 at 3 mg (n5 50), 6 mg
(n5 50), 12 mg (n5 50), or 18 mg (n5 50) twice daily, or
24 mg once daily (n5 49). Patients were from Eastern
Europe (61%), Latin/South America (18%), the United
States (10%), Western Europe (8%), or other regions
(4%). In general, demographic and clinical characteristics at
baseline were similar among treatment groups (Table 1).
The mean6 SD duration since disease diagnosis was
6.96 6.7 years, 17.7% had previously used at least 1 non-
MTX DMARD, and the mean6 SD MTX dose was 15.26
4.2 mg/week. Mean6 SD swollen and tender joint counts at
baseline were 17.56 11.5 (of 66 joints) and 27.86 15.5 (of
68 joints), respectively. The mean6 SD DAS28-CRP was
5.76 1.0. Fifty-seven percent of patients had elevated CRP
levels at baseline. Overall, 91% of patients completed the
study, with similar discontinuation rates across treatment
groups and no apparent relationship between ABT-494
dose and discontinuation (see Supplementary Figure 1,
available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39808/abstract).
Efficacy.
The proportion of ABT-494–treated
patients achieving an ACR20 response at week 12 (by
the LOCF method) was significantly higher than the
corresponding proportion of placebo-treated patients
(50%) for all except those receiving the lowest dose of
3 mg twice daily (65% for 3 mg twice daily, P 5 0.153; 73%
for 6 mg twice daily, P 5 0.018; 82% for 12 mg twice daily,
P 5 0.001; 77% for 18 mg twice daily, P 5 0.008; 82% for
24 mg once daily, P 5 0.001). Using NRI, the proportions
of patients achieving an ACR20 response at week 12 were
significantly higher with ABT-494 at 6 mg twice daily
(68%), 12 mg twice daily (80%), and 24 mg once daily
(76%) than with placebo (46%), and numerically higher
than placebo for those receiving 3 mg twice daily (62%)
and 18 mg twice daily (64%) (Figure 1). A significant
dose-response relationship was identified (P , 0.001 for
all doses). At week 12, ACR50 and ACR70 responses
were achieved by significantly higher percentages of
patients who received ABT-494 versus those who
received placebo at all doses except 12 mg twice daily for
the ACR70 response (by NRI) (Figure 1).
At the first study visit assessment (week 2), ACR20
responses with ABT-494 ranged from 30% to 44% and
were significantly higher at all doses (P, 0.05) compared
with placebo (12%) (by NRI) (Figure 2A). The proportion
of ACR20 responses increased over time with ABT-494
and reached maximum values between weeks 6 and 12.
Likewise, significantly more patients receiving ABT-494
than those receiving placebo had an ACR50 response from
week 4 onward (by NRI), except for the 24 mg dose at 6
weeks (Figure 2B). Significantly more patients receiving
ABT-494 than those receiving placebo achieved ACR70
responses by week 6, with some further improvements up
to week 12 (by NRI) (Figure 2C). Twenty-four percent of
patients receiving ABT-494 at 12 mg twice daily maintained
an ACR20 response at every visit from week 2 through
week
12
(see
Supplementary
Figure
2,
http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39808/abstract).
Mean decreases from baseline in the DAS28-CRP
increased over time for all ABT-494 doses, and improve-
ments were significantly higher compared with placebo at
every time point. By week 12, improvement from baseline
in the DAS28-CRP with ABT-494 ranged from 22.2 to
22.6 versus 21.3 for placebo (Figure 2D). Improvements
from baseline in CDAI scores were consistent with
improvements in the DAS28-CRP, and by week 8,
improvements in CDAI scores were significantly higher at
doses of $6 mg twice daily (see Supplementary Figure 3B,
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39808/abstract).
The CDAI and SDAI scores, hsCRP level, and DAS28-CRP
are presented in Supplementary Figures 3A, C, E, and F.
At week 12, significantly higher percentages of
patients treated with all doses of ABT-494 (41–52%) than
those treated with placebo (20%) achieved a DAS28-CRP

 of #3.2. A DAS28-CRP of ,2.6 was achieved by signifi-
cantly higher percentages of patients treated with ABT-494
(34–40%) than those treated with placebo (14%) at all doses
except 24 mg once daily (22%) (by NRI) (Figure 2E). Simi-
larly, at week 12, low disease activity according to the CDAI
score was achieved by a significantly higher percentage of
patients receiving ABT-494 (40–46%) than those receiving
placebo (20%) at all doses except 24 mg once daily (35%)
(by NRI) (Figure 2F). A slightly lower percentage of patients
achieved low disease activity according to the CDAI score
than the percentage who achieved a DAS28-CRP of #3.2,
and fewer patients achieved clinical remission according to
the CDAI score than achieved a DAS28-CRP of ,2.6.
Improvements from baseline in all the individual
components of the ACR core set of disease activity mea-
sures were greater with ABT-494 than with placebo,
reaching statistical significance for most comparisons at
doses of $6 mg twice daily (Table 2). Changes from

 baseline in the HAQ DI score at week 12 with ABT-494
ranged from 20.6 to 20.8 and were significantly greater
than those with placebo (20.4) for all but the dose of 24 mg
once daily (20.6). Compared with patients receiving pla-
cebo (67%), a numerically greater proportion of patients
receiving ABT-494 at $6 mg twice daily (69–88%) met
the MCID for the HAQ DI score at week 12.
Sensitivity analyses for correction of affected
hsCRP samples demonstrated the following: the popula-
tion hsCRP value over time was predicted not to change;
there was a potential shift of 1 patient from responder to
nonresponder in the placebo arm for ACR50 response
(from 18% down to 16%). Overall, the study showed a
tendency toward geographic differences in responses
across the treatment arms, with a trend toward higher
responses observed in countries in Eastern Europe, Latin
America, and South America (see Supplementary Table 1,
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39808/abstract).
Safety.
The
overall
incidence
of
treatment-
emergent AEs was higher with ABT-494 than with placebo
(45% versus 26%), with a trend toward higher incidences
of AEs at higher doses (Table 3). Most reported AEs were
mild in severity. Ten patients discontinued ABT-494 or pla-
cebo due to an AE (dyspepsia in the placebo group; head-
ache in the 3 mg group; mood swings in the 6 mg group;
pneumonia in the 12 mg group; hyperbilirubinemia, pyrexia,
decreased hemoglobin, decreased neutrophil count, and
decreased white blood cell count in the 18 mg group; and
abdominal pain in the 24 mg group). Infections were the
most common AEs reported during the trial. Three events
of herpes zoster were reported with ABT-494 (1 at 3 mg and
2 at 24 mg); each involved a single dermatome. All were
mild-to-moderate in severity and considered nonserious by
the investigator. Among the most commonly observed AEs
(defined as having occurred in $5% of patients in any dose
group) were nasopharyngitis, headache, increased blood
creatine phosphokinase (CPK), diarrhea, back pain, cough,
influenza, leukopenia, and dyslipidemia.
Eight patients in the ABT-494 treatment groups and
none in the placebo group experienced serious AEs (SAEs).
At 6 mg, 2 patients experienced an SAE (1 had osteonecrosis
and 1 had lung cancer). The patient with lung cancer was a

GENOVESE ET AL
 79-year-old man who had smoked for 40 years and had a fam-
ily history of lung cancer; lung cancer was diagnosed on post-
treatment day 10, and the patient died 3 months later. At
12 mg, 1 patient experienced an SAE of pneumonia that
led to early discontinuation. At 18 mg, 3 patients experi-
enced an SAE (sciatica, ovarian cyst, and pyrexia in 1
patient each), and at 24 mg, 2 patients experienced 3 SAEs
(syncope and head injury in 1 patient, and forearm fracture
in 1 patient). One adjudicated cardiovascular event was
reported during the study (a nonserious event of ischemic
stroke at 12 mg in a patient with transient difficulty in
speech and history of cerebral infarction). No patient in any
treatment group reported an opportunistic infection, non-
melanoma skin cancer, or gastrointestinal (GI) perforation.
There were no deaths reported during the trial, although
the patient diagnosed as having lung cancer on posttreat-
ment day 10 died 3 months after completing the study.
At week 12, treatment with ABT-494 led to modest
increases in mean values for alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared
with placebo; no clear dose dependence was observed for
either increase (see Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39808/abstract).
Grade 3 or grade 4 ALT or AST abnormalities during
the study were infrequent, with 3 patients experiencing
a grade 3 AST abnormality, 4 patients experiencing a
grade 3 ALT elevation, and 1 patient experiencing a
grade 4 ALT elevation. None of these led to study dis-
continuation. There were no grade 3 or grade 4
elevations observed for creatinine during the study (see
Supplementary Table 3). At week 12, mean creatinine
and CPK levels were higher in all ABT-494 dose groups
compared with placebo, but these were not considered
clinically significant. Six patients treated with ABT-494
had CPK elevations .43 ULN, but these were not dose
dependent. All 6 patients were asymptomatic, and val-
ues returned to normal or pretreatment levels with con-
tinued ABT-494 treatment. No patient discontinued the
study due to these CPK elevations. ABT-494 was associ-
ated with elevations in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across
all tested doses at week 12 compared with placebo; how-
ever, the LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratios
remained consistent through week 12.
Although decreases in lymphocyte and neutrophil
counts were observed with ABT-494 treatment, no statisti-
cally significant decline in mean lymphocyte or neutrophil
counts relative to placebo were observed for any ABT-494
dose groups by week 12. Two patients had grade 4 reduc-
tions in lymphocytes (1 in the 3 mg group and 1 in
the 18 mg group) (see Supplementary Table 3, http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39808/abstract);
the patient in the 18 mg group reported an event of skin
infection during the study, which was not reported in tem-
poral proximity to the lymphocyte decrease. There were no
grade 4 neutrophil reductions in any of the treatment groups.
A dose-dependent decrease in natural killer (NK) cells
(CD32CD161CD561) was observed in patients treated
with ABT-494 at $6 mg (22) (see Supplementary Figure 4,
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39808/abstract).
The mean 6 SD change in NK cells was 2.3 6 40.9% in
the placebo group and 1.9 6 47.8%, 213.3 6 44.1%,

remained

or
increased at lower doses (3 mg and 6 mg), most notably in

higher doses (12 mg, 18 mg, and 24 mg). One patient in the
18 mg group discontinued the study due to decreased hemo-
globin (from 14.4 gm/dl at baseline to 10.7 gm/dl at week 11).
DISCUSSION
Differences in selectivity of JAK inhibitors for the
members of the JAK family may be associated with an
improved benefit–risk profile in a number of autoimmune
diseases. ABT-494 is a novel, selective JAK-1 inhibitor de-
signed to inhibit JAK-1 with greater potency than it inhibits
JAK-2 and JAK-3. The BALANCE II study investigated a
broad range of doses, as well as once and twice daily dos-
ing schedules, of immediate-release ABT-494 to assess its
efficacy and safety for the treatment of RA in patients
with an inadequate response to stable MTX therapy.
Clinical efficacy of ABT-494 was demonstrated
with the primary efficacy end point of an ACR20
response being met at all doses at week 12, as assessed by
the LOCF method and at the 6, 12, and 24 mg doses
when assessed by NRI. Similarly, efficacy of ABT-494
treatment was demonstrated for the secondary efficacy
end points. Onset of improvement was rapid, as demon-
strated by the achievement of ACR20 responses by 30–
44% of patients treated with ABT-494 at week 2.
Improvements were also sustained, with 18–24% of
patients receiving ABT-494 meeting the ACR20 response
criteria at all visits from week 2 through week 12. Like-
wise, looking at measures of a greater magnitude of
response, such as the ACR50 and ACR70, significant dif-
ferences for most doses of ABT-494 versus placebo were
observed early during the study, with maximum improve-
ment achieved between weeks 6 and 12. Low levels of dis-
ease activity as measured by the DAS28-CRP were
achieved in nearly half of the patients receiving ABT-494
by week 12. For all efficacy measures, a clear dose-
response relationship was observed across the tested
doses, with maximum efficacy reached at doses of 6 or
12 mg. The underreporting of a minority of hsCRP values
was predicted to have no significant impact on efficacy
parameters and the overall conclusions from the study.
Similar to findings with biologic therapies cur-
rently used for the treatment of RA, infections were the
most common AEs. Three nonserious events of herpes
zoster were reported with ABT-494 (1 at 3 mg and 2 at
24 mg), each involving a single dermatome. There were
no reports of opportunistic infection, nonmelanoma skin
cancer, or GI perforation. No deaths occurred during the
study. There were no unexpected AE trends based on the
known safety of drugs from the same class. Safety obser-
vations from this phase IIb study support proceeding to
larger phase III trials in which the safety profile will be
further characterized and confirmed.
Consistent with observations for other JAK inhibi-
tors and drugs that inhibit IL-6 (5,9,23), certain effects on
laboratory parameters were also observed with ABT-494
and are likely to be attributable to potent JAK-1 inhibi-
tion (3,24). Treatment with ABT-494 was associated with
elevations in liver enzymes, LDL and HDL cholesterol,
and CPK, with no apparent dose relationship. Although
increases in LDL and HDL cholesterol were observed
across all tested doses, the LDL cholesterol:HDL choles-
terol ratios remained consistent throughout. Liver enzyme

 elevations were infrequent and usually transient, while
CPK elevations were asymptomatic and returned to nor-
mal levels with continued treatment.
Inhibition of IL-6 signaling activity has previously
been shown to be associated with decreased levels of the
iron-sequestering hormone, hepcidin, and CRP, and with
increased levels of hemoglobin (25,26). In the subgroup
of patients with elevated hsCRP at baseline, mean hemo-
globin values increased over time for the 3 mg and 6 mg
groups, while decreases in hemoglobin were observed at
doses of $12 mg, with limited clinical impact. This obser-
vation is possibly due to higher selectivity of ABT-494 for
JAK-1 over JAK-2 at lower doses combined with reduced
systemic inflammation, leading to an improvement in
hemoglobin levels. These findings suggest that ABT-494
is selective for JAK-1 at lower doses and less selective at
higher doses. This was taken into consideration in the
analysis of the efficacy and safety data to determine the
optimal doses to take forward into phase III studies.
Reductions in lymphocytes and neutrophils were
observed during treatment with ABT-494, with higher
incidences of grade 3 or 4 reductions in lymphocytes
reported at higher doses; however, only 1 patient with a
grade 4 reduction (,0.5 3 109/liter) in lymphocytes had
a skin infection, which was not reported in temporal
proximity to the lymphocyte decrease. No grade 4 neutro-
phil reductions were reported.
Compared with placebo, there were also reduc-
tions in NK cells observed at ABT-494 doses of $6 mg,
similar to observations with other compounds of the
same class (27,28). The relevance of NK cell reduction to
predicting clinical events, such as viral reactivation, is
unclear. No association of reduced NK cells with herpes
zoster events was observed, although the sample size was
small. The potential correlation of NK cell reductions
with safety of ABT-494 treatment needs to be further
investigated in larger phase III trials.
Limitations of the study include the overall
length and size of a phase IIb dose-ranging study. The
placebo control was limited to 12 weeks due to ethical
concerns about extending placebo control in patients
with active disease, while the size was restricted to ;50
patients per individual dosing arm. However, patients
completing the 12 weeks of treatment in this study had
the option to continue into a long-term extension study.
The study enrolled patients with an inadequate response
to MTX, which limited the ability to extrapolate the effi-
cacy and safety results of this study to other populations.
The companion study, BALANCE I (22), included
patients with active RA for whom at least 1 anti-TNF or
biologic therapy had failed. Dose dependence in the
achievement of some clinical responses was not always
apparent, possibly due to the 12-week time frame and
small patient numbers in this phase IIb trial. These effects
are better evaluated in larger phase III trials, which include
a broader patient population and a longer time frame.
The observed placebo response in BALANCE II
was higher than previously reported for RA trials con-
ducted several years prior to this study. In the placebo
group, 46% of patients achieved an ACR20 response at
week 12, with a clear regional variance in response contrib-
uting to this effect, which may reflect the tendency toward
increasing placebo responses as demonstrated by contem-
poraneous clinical trials in this group (9,29–31) (see Sup-
plementary Table 1, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.
1002/art.39808/abstract). Regional differences in patients’
expectations and perceptions of treatment efficacy may
contribute to the trend recently observed in RA clinical tri-
als and may reflect patients’ attitudes toward more
advanced treatment. Despite the high placebo response
observed, ABT-494 showed statistically significant and clin-
ically meaningful differences from placebo at most doses.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that selec-
tive JAK-1 inhibition with ABT-494 was effective in
patients with active RA and an inadequate response to
MTX who were receiving stable background MTX. ABT-
494 demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile consis-
tent with other JAK inhibitors tested in RA. Together
with BALANCE I (22), the BALANCE II study evaluated
a broad range of ABT-494 doses in order to understand
the boundaries of safety and efficacy. Doses that reflect
the optimal benefit–risk profile will be evaluated in phase
III studies to confirm the safety and efficacy observed in
this study and will allow comprehensive characterization
of the clinical and pharmacologic profile of ABT-494.
