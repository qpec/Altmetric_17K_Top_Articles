ABSTRACT
Background. An inverse relationship between coffee consumption
and mortality has been reported in the general population. However,
the association between caffeine consumption and mortality in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains uncertain.
Methods. We analysed 4863 non-institutionalized USA adults
with CKD [defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) of 15–60mL/min/1.73m2 and/or a urinary albumin:
creatinine ratio >30mg/g] in a nationwide study using the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
1999–2010. Caffeine consumption was evaluated by 24-h dietary
recalls at baseline and all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mor-
tality were evaluated until 31 December 2011. We also performed
an analysis of caffeine consumption according to its source (cof-
fee, tea and soft drinks). Quartiles of caffeine consumption were
<28.2 mg/day (Q1), 28.2–103.0 (Q2), 103.01–213.5 (Q3) and
>213.5 (Q4).
Results. During a median follow-up of 60months, 1283 partici-
pants died. Comparing with Q1 of caffeine consumption, the
adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.74 [95% con-
fidence interval (CI) 0.60–0.91] for Q2, 0.74 (95% CI 0.62–0.89)
for Q3 and 0.78 (95% CI 0.62–0.98) for Q4 (P¼ 0.02 for
trend across quartiles). There were no significant interactions
between caffeine consumption quartiles and CKD stages or uri-
nary albumin:creatinine ratio categories regarding all-cause
mortality.
Conclusions. We detected an inverse association between caf-
feine consumption and all-cause mortality among participants
with CKD.

INTRODUCTION
Caffeine is consumed in several types of beverages, mainly
coffee, tea and soft drinks. It is estimated that �89% of the
adult USA population consumes caffeine daily [1]. Thus the
detection of even a small health-promoting effect associated
with caffeine consumption could have a substantial impact
on public health.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased
health
care
costs
and
high
morbidity
and
mortality.
Approximately 14% of adults in the USA have CKD and the
prevalence of CKD is expected to continue to increase world-
wide [2–4].
Previous epidemiological studies have suggested an associa-
tion between coffee consumption and slower progression of
CKD [5–8]. An inverse relationship between coffee consump-
tion and mortality has been reported in the general population
[7, 9]. However, the association between caffeine consumption
and mortality in patients with CKD remains unclear.
We hypothesized that caffeine consumption might be associ-
ated with lower mortality among participants with CKD. We
examined the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 1999–2010 database to evaluate the effect of
caffeine consumption and caffeine source on all-cause, cardio-
vascular and cancer mortality among participants with CKD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and population
We performed an analysis of the NHANES database. The
NHANES is a periodic survey conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). The NHANES is a stratified,
multistage survey using a nationally representative sample of
the non-institutionalized civilian population of the USA.
Participants are selected at random through a complex statisti-
cal process each year and they complete personal structured
interviews at home and then undergo a physical examination at
a mobile examination centre, including height, weight and labo-
ratory measurements [10]. The NCHS Research Ethics Review
Board reviewed and approved the NHANES and all participants

 provided written informed consent. We used data from 1999 to
2010 (62 160 people). We restricted our analysis to non-
pregnant individuals �18years of age (33 931 subjects) and
included only participants with CKD [defined as an estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (using
the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equa-
tion) and/or a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio >30mg/g]
(5696 subjects). We excluded participants with CKD Stage 5
and participants that were either on haemodialysis or peritoneal
dialysis (107 subjects).
We also excluded from our analysis participants with miss-
ing information on mortality (five subjects). In order to assess
the quality and completeness of a survey participant’s response
to the dietary recall section, we used the dietary recall status
evaluated by the interviewer and only included the ones that
were classified as ‘reliable and met the minimum criteria’.
Finally, 4863 participants were included in our analysis.
Caffeine consumption and nutritional assessment
In all cycles of the NHANES 1999–2010, a 24-h dietary recall
was collected. All food items and quantities consumed in the
24 h preceding the interview were recorded using an automated
multiple-pass method. For participants in the 1999–2002
NHANES, only one in-person 24-h dietary recall was per-
formed. The cycles starting from 2003 onwards included two
recalls. The first recall in person and the second one via tele-
phone were collected 3–10 days after the first dietary interview
but not on the same day of the week. We used the nutritional
information from foods and beverages collected in the single
24-h dietary recall to calculate the caffeine, energy and nutrient
intakes of participants in the 1999–2002 NHANES. For partici-
pants in the 2003–10 NHANES we used the mean of the nutri-
tional information from both recalls [11]. The NHANES
included information regarding the nutrient source by the type
of food ingested. These data were used to ascertain the quantity
of caffeine ingested from coffee, tea or soft drink for each partic-
ipant. We evaluated the impact of caffeine consumption
obtained from each of the three types of drinks on different
outcomes.
Participants were grouped according to the quartile of daily
intake of caffeine from all sources. Due to a lower number of
participants with caffeine intake from coffee, tea and soft
drinks, and due to the high variability of caffeine in these bever-
ages, we divided these participants into three categories: no con-
sumption, consumption below median and consumption above
median.
STUDY OUTCOMES
The primary outcome was time to death. As secondary out-
comes we used time to cardiovascular mortality and time to
death by cancer. Mortality status and cause of mortality were
determined by NHANES-linked National Death Index public-
access files through 31 December 2011.
Statistical analysis
All calculations took into account the complex survey design
of the NHANES database and were analysed according to the
CDC analytic recommendations [12]. The sample weight that
was used was the ‘day 1 dietary weight’. We computed com-
bined weights in accordance with the NHANES Analytic
Reporting Guidelines. Survey procedures were used in all analy-
ses to account for the complex, stratified, multistage probability
sample design of the NHANES. The method used for variance
estimation was the Taylor linearized variance estimation. To as-
sess the crude association between caffeine consumption and
time to death, we performed a Kaplan–Meier curve and log-
rank test. We performed a Cox proportional hazards model
(Model 1) adjusted for the following potential confounders: age,
gender, race (Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black and other), annual family
income (<$25 000, $25 000–$75 000 and >$75 000), smoking
status (never smoker, current smoker or former smoker), CKD
stage, eGFR (>90, 60–90, 30–59 and 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m2)
and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (0–30, 30–300 and
>300 mg/g). We also performed a second model (Model 2) in-
cluding the previously mentioned variables plus the following:
education level (<9th grade, 9th–11th grade, high school grad-
uate, some college or associate’s degree, college graduate and
above), alcohol consumption (no alcohol consumption, <20 g/
day, �20 g/day), daily carbohydrate consumption (grams of
carbohydrate/100 kcal), polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acids
ratio, dietary protein (g/100 kcal), dietary fibre (g/100 kcal), die-
tary potassium (mg), body mass index (BMI; <20.0, 20.0–
<25.0, 25.0–<30.0, 30.0–<35.0, 35.0–<40.0 and �40.0 kg/m2),
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, previous myo-
cardial infarction and previous stroke. We assessed the extent
to which CKD stage and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio modi-
fied the effect of caffeine consumption on mortality with a like-
lihood ratio test for interaction. We also performed a sensitivity
analysis excluding patients that died during the first 12 months
of follow-up.
Multiple imputation by chained equations was used for deal-
ing with missing data regarding covariates [13]. Twenty impu-
tations per missing observation were performed. A test for
trend over increasing caffeine consumption categories was con-
ducted where each category median was modelled as a continu-
ous variable in the regression. Continuous variables are
presented as means with standard deviations except for polyun-
saturated:saturated fatty acids ratio, fibre, eGFR and urinary
albumin:creatinine ratio, which were summarized using median
(interquartile range) due to their right-skewed distributions.
Categorical variables are presented as percentages with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). A two-sided P-value <0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using
Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

 were more likely to be male, non-Hispanic white, have a higher
education level and higher annual income, be current or former
smokers, have higher alcohol consumption and have fewer pre-
vious strokes. Regarding dietary factors, they ingested more po-
tassium and less carbohydrates and fibres and had a lower
polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acids ratio.
Caffeine consumption and mortality
During a median follow-up of 60 months (27 724 total per-
son-years), 1283 (26%) participants died. In the unadjusted
analysis (Figure 1), and also after multivariable analysis
(Table 2), an inverse association between caffeine and all-cause
mortality was
observed
among
participants with CKD.
Comparing with the first quartile (Q1) of caffeine consumption,
the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 0.74
(95% CI 0.60–0.91) for Q2, 0.75 (95% CI 0.61–0.92) for Q3 and
0.75 (95% CI 0.59–0.97) for Q4 (P ¼ 0.02, for trend across
quartiles).
Specific causes of mortality were also examined. There were
368 deaths due to cardiovascular events and 226 deaths due to
cancer. In the univariate and also multivariable analysis, there
was no significant association between caffeine consumption
and cardiovascular or cancer mortality (Table 2).
There was no significant interaction between caffeine con-
sumption quartiles and CKD stages regarding all-cause mortal-
ity. There was no significant interaction between caffeine
consumption quartiles and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio
categories regarding all-cause mortality (Figure 2).
The sensitivity analysis, which excluded patients that died
during the first 12 months of follow-up, presented results that
were consistent with the main analyses (Supplementary data,
Table S4).
Source of caffeine consumption and mortality
An analysis of caffeine consumption according to its source
(coffee, tea and soft drinks) was also performed (Supplementary
data, Tables S1–S3). In the adjusted analysis, no significant asso-
ciation between caffeine consumption from coffee and all-cause
mortality was observed in patients with CKD. Comparing with

 the no consumption group, the adjusted HR was 0.92 (95% CI
0.77–1.11) for the below median group and 0.88 (95% CI 0.71–
1.09) for the above median group (P¼ 0.2 for trend across cate-
gories). There were also no associations between caffeine con-
sumption from coffee and cardiovascular or cancer mortality.
Regarding caffeine consumption from soft drinks, an inverse
association between caffeine and all-cause mortality was found
in patients with CKD. Comparing with the no consumption
group, the adjusted HR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.60–1.00) for the be-
low median group and 0.69 (95% CI 0.49–0.98) for the above
median group (P ¼ 0.04 for trend across categories). This asso-
ciation was not observed for cardiovascular or cancer mortality.
No significant association between caffeine consumption from
tea and all-cause, cardiovascular or cancer mortality was found.
DISCUSSION
Our study showed an inverse association between caffeine and
all-cause mortality among participants with CKD. We did not de-
tect a significant association between caffeine consumption and
cardiovascular mortality or cancer mortality. There were no sig-
nificant interactions between caffeine consumption quartiles and
CKD stages or urinary albumin:creatinine ratio categories regard-
ing all-cause mortality. Consequently, caffeine consumption
appears to be safe through different stages of kidney disease.
Coffee consumption has multiple health-related effects.
Coffee consumption has been shown to decrease uric acid levels
and increase adiponectin and magnesium levels [14, 15]. An as-
sociation between coffee consumption and increased eGFR has
been detected [16]. However, the higher eGFR among coffee
consumers does not appear to result from glomerular hyperfil-
tration [17]. The addition of a small amount of sugar to coffee
does not seem to alter the effect on eGFR [18].
The possible protective effect of coffee might be conferred by
the presence of caffeine and antioxidants [19]. Caffeine is a
xanthine that increases intracellular calcium and stimulates the
production of nitric oxide through the expression of the endo-
thelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme. Nitric oxide diffuses to the
vascular smooth muscle cells and causes vasodilation [20].
Caffeine stimulates the cardiovascular system through the
blockade of vascular adenosine receptors [21].
An inverse relationship between coffee consumption and
mortality has been observed in the general population and also
in different racial/ethnic groups [7]. An analysis of the
Multiethnic Cohort from 1993 to 2012, including 185 855
Native Hawaiians, African Americans, Japanese Americans,
Latinos and whites 45–75 years of age at recruitment, detected
an inverse association between coffee consumption and deaths
due to heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease, stroke, diabetes
and kidney disease in these ethnic groups, excluding Native
Hawaiians [7]. An analysis of three large prospective cohorts
detected a significant inverse association between coffee con-
sumption and deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease, neu-
rologic
diseases
and
suicide.
However,
no
significant
association between coffee consumption and total cancer mor-
tality was found [5]. Also, in a large prospective US cohort study
there was a dose-dependent inverse association between coffee
drinking and mortality from all causes, and specifically from
heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents,
diabetes and infections [22].
The possible protective effect of caffeine consumption in all-
cause mortality was also detected when the analysis was per-
formed according to caffeine consumption from soft drinks.
This association was not expected in patients with CKD who
consumed soft drinks. Sicker patients may avoid soft drinks
with caffeine or the consumption of soft drinks may be associ-
ated with protective behaviours not evaluated in the current
study (e.g. physical activity). The possible protective effect of
caffeine consumption in all-cause mortality was not observed
when the analysis was performed according to caffeine

 consumption from coffee or tea. We hypothesize that this may
be due to a lack of statistical power.
Considering the mean caffeine content per unit of caffein-
ated beverage (95 mg in 8 oz. of coffee, 48 mg in 8 oz. of tea and
30 mg in 12oz. of cola), even small quantities of commonly
consumed beverages may confer a protective effect regarding
all-cause mortality in patients with CKD [23]. However, the
mechanism that confers the protective effect of caffeine con-
sumption is uncertain. It is possible that the same mechanism
that justifies the inverse relationship between coffee consump-
tion and mortality reported in the general population also exists
with caffeine in patients with CKD [7].

 Regarding the strengths of our study, note that the
NHANES includes a large number of patients who are non-
institutionalized, and NHANES data were systematically col-
lected and included hard outcome measures such as all-cause
mortality. The presence of detailed information about the par-
ticipants allowed for adjustment for the main biologically plau-
sible confounders. As the database includes comprehensive
information regarding CKD, NHANES survey data have previ-
ously been used to study this disease [24–33]. To our knowledge
this is the first study to evaluate the effect of caffeine consump-
tion on mortality in patients with CKD using a large database
representative of the USA population.
Considering the limitations of our study, caffeine con-
sumption was evaluated by 24-h dietary recalls. It cannot be
excluded that data generated using this method may not rep-
resent the long-term dietary habits of the participants. We
consider that the inclusion of data from non-consecutive
recalls to estimate usual dietary intake distributions mini-
mizes this risk. Although we have included additional infor-
mation regarding diet in the studied population (such as
consumption of carbohydrates, saturated fats or fibres) in the
analyses, no adjustment was performed for additives present
in caffeine-containing beverages. Nonetheless, other studies
showed a significant association between coffee consumption
and decreased risk of all-cause mortality even after adjust-
ment for coffee additives, such as cream, milk, sugar or honey
[8, 34]. Non-food sources of caffeine were not considered in
our study. However, these sources correspond only to a small
proportion of caffeine ingestion [35]. The absence of associa-
tion between caffeine consumption and specific causes of
mortality may be due to inaccurate classification of the cause
of death. However, regardless of the subjacent mechanism,
the reduction in all-cause mortality is clinically relevant. As
in all observational studies, our analysis has an exploratory
nature. Therefore it is possible that residual confounding
exists due to unmeasured variables. It is also possible that the
differences found are due to chance, or that caffeine consum-
ers also perform other protective behaviours, contributing to
a healthy user effect. Physical activity, which may correlate
with caffeine consumption, was not included in our analysis
[36].
Future research should focus on the benefits of other com-
pounds present in caffeine-containing beverages and on the as-
sociation between caffeine consumption and mortality in other
world regions. It is uncertain if caffeine consumption above a
certain threshold may have deleterious health effects. In conclu-
sion, this large observational study showed a significant inverse
association between caffeine consumption and all-cause mor-
tality among patients with CKD in the USA. If these results are
to be confirmed by prospective studies, advising these patients
to drink more caffeine may reduce their mortality. This would
be a simple, clinically beneficial and inexpensive option in
patients with CKD.
