In Brief
UV-induced DNA damage is a risk factor
for skin cancers. Yang et al. demonstrate
that UVRAG targets DDB1 and activates
the DDB1-containing CRL4DDB2 ubiquitin
ligase complex, resulting in efficient
photolesion repair. Reduced levels of
UVRAG correlate with increased UV-
signature loads in skin melanoma, which
could potentially influence melanoma
predisposition and progression.

SUMMARY
UV-induced DNA damage, a major risk factor for skin
cancers, is primarily repaired by nucleotide excision
repair (NER). UV radiation resistance-associated
gene (UVRAG) is a tumor suppressor involved in auto-
phagy. It was initially isolated as a cDNA partially
complementing UV sensitivity in xeroderma pigmen-
tosum (XP), but this was not explored further. Here we
show that UVRAG plays an integral role in UV-induced
DNA damage repair. It localizes to photolesions and
associates with DDB1 to promote the assembly and
activity of the DDB2-DDB1-Cul4A-Roc1 (CRL4DDB2)
ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to efficient XPC
recruitment
and

NER.
UVRAG
depletion decreased substrate handover to XPC
and

hypersensitivity.
We
confirmed the importance of UVRAG for UV-damage
tolerance using a Drosophila model. Furthermore,
increased
UV-signature
mutations
in
melanoma
correlate with reduced expression of UVRAG. Our re-
sults identify UVRAG as a regulator of CRL4DDB2-
mediated NER and suggest that its expression levels
may influence melanoma predisposition.
INTRODUCTION
Exposure to UV is the main cause of skin cancer development
(Garibyan and Fisher, 2010). DNA is the major target of UV-
induced cellular damage. When left unrepaired, it leads to accu-
mulation of ‘‘UV-signature’’ mutations, mainly C>T/G>A transi-
tions at dipyrimidine sites, and induction of skin cancer (Hodis
et al., 2012). Indeed, the most abundant somatic mutations pre-
sent in melanomas, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, are
UV-induced photodamages, as discovered in recent genome-
wide association studies (Hodis et al., 2012; Pleasance et al.,
2010), suggesting that cellular responses to UV-induced DNA
damage may not function fully in this UV-related fatal disease.
The most important mechanism that protects DNA against UV
radiation is nucleotide excision repair (NER), which removes
helix-distorting adducts on DNA (Marteijn et al., 2014). The
importance of NER in melanoma is clearly demonstrated by
the genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which is
defective in NER and has a 1,000-fold greater risk of developing
melanoma (Emmert and Kraemer, 2013; Spatz et al., 2010).
Indeed, polymorphisms in NER-related genes have been shown
to predict melanoma survival (Emmert and Kraemer, 2013; Li
et al., 2006, 2013; Wei et al., 2003).
There are two distinct subpathways of NER, global genomic
NER (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), which
differ in initial steps of damage recognition but converge to use a
common set of effectors for DNA incision, oligonucleotide
removal, and nick ligation (Marteijn et al., 2014). Unlike TC-
NER, which selectively repairs DNA lesions on the actively tran-
scribed genes, GG-NER scans the whole genome for damage
via the DDB1-DDB2 (UV-damaged DNA binding proteins 1
and 2) heterodimers, designated UV-DDB, and via XPC (xero-
derma pigmentosum group C), which repairs photolesions
regardless of the transcriptional status (Kamileri et al., 2012).
Upon UV irradiation, UV-DDB recognizes and binds DNA lesions,
then recruits the Cullin 4A (Cul4A)-Roc1 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4)
complex (Marteijn et al., 2014; Sugasawa et al., 2005). This
UV-DDB-Cul4A-Roc1 complex (referred to as CRL4DDB2) cata-
lyzes the ubiquitination of histones and/or recruits chromatin
remodelers at the sites of UV lesions, ensuing lesion handover
from UV-DDB to XPC (Cleaver et al., 2009; Duan and Smerdon,
2010). Thus, CRL4DDB2 is essential in the initial detection of
UV-damaged chromatin DNA. CRL4DDB2 activation is also regu-
lated by the covalent attachment of Nedd8 to Cul4A, which is
negatively influenced by CAND1 (Cullin-associated and neddy-
lation-dissociated 1) (Bennett et al., 2010). Disruption of any
component of the UV-DDB-Cul4-Roc1-XPC axis leads to a
failure to repair UV-induced damage, resulting in genomic
instability and increased cancer development (Scha
¨ rer, 2013).
Although the core NER reaction is well studied, the regulatory

 mechanisms that safeguard the integrity of an efficient NER and
its high importance for the cumulative UV-like mutagenesis in
skin cancer, particularly melanoma, are still elusive.
UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) was initially
isolated in 1997 as a cDNA partially complementing UV sensi-
tivity in XP (Perelman et al., 1997), hence the name UVRAG.
However, this initial important observation has not been further
explored. UVRAG contains four major domains: a proline-rich
(PR) domain, a lipid-binding C2 domain, a coiled-coil domain
(CCD), and a C-terminal domain presumed to be unstructured
(Liang et al., 2006). We have previously identified UVRAG as a
multivalent trafficking adaptor involved in autophagic, endocytic,
and secretory trafficking pathways (He et al., 2013; Liang et al.,
2006, 2008). Our recent data further show that the C-terminal re-
gion of UVRAG is involved in centrosome stability and regulates
DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase) (Zhao et al., 2012).
Significantly, all of these activities of UVRAG are genetically
separable and functionally independent, suggesting biological
connection and coordinated regulation of the different pro-
cesses under diverse environmental cues. Notably, none of
these identified activities of UVRAG explain its link to UV-
induced DNA damage.
Herein, we demonstrate that UVRAG interacts specifically with
the UV-induced photolesion sensor DDB1 in vivo; this interaction
allows UVRAG to be recruited to the damaged foci after UV
exposure, promoting complex assembly, Cul4A neddylation,
and ubiquitin ligase activity of the CRL4DDB2 complex in GG-
NER. Inactivation of UVRAG inhibits efficient substrate hand-
over from UV-DDB to XPC in the NER cascade, rendering cells
ultrasensitive to UV-induced tissue and DNA damage in vitro
and in vivo. Finally, reduced levels of UVRAG are associated
with increased UV-signature loads in cutaneous, but not UV-
shielded, melanoma and could potentially influence melanoma
predisposition and disease progression.
RESULTS
Essential Role of UVRAG in Protecting Cells from UV
Damage
To elucidate the molecular functions of UVRAG in UV sensitivity
and skin cancer, we set out to examine the role of UVRAG in
UV-induced damage in melanoma cells by colony-forming as-
says. Knockdown of UVRAG in A375 human and B16 mouse
melanoma cells drastically sensitized melanoma cells to UV irra-
diation and UV-mimetic drugs (i.e., NFZ and 4-NQO), but not
to other drugs (e.g., CPT and MMS) (Figures 1A–1C, S1A–S1C,
and S1H–S1M, available online). UV sensitivity was abolished
by re-expression of shRNA-resistant WT (wild-type) UVRAG. In
contrast, re-expression of UVRAG (L286F) point mutant, iden-
tified in two independent melanoma exome studies (Berger
et al., 2012; Hodis et al., 2012), failed to confer UV resistance
(Figures 1A–1C, S1A–S1C, and S1H–S1M). In accord, ectopic
expression of UVRAGWT, but not UVRAGL286F, caused increased
cell tolerance to UV irradiation and to UV mimetics (Figures S1D–
S1G and S1N–S1Q), indicative of UVRAGL286F being a loss-of-
function mutation in UV protection. These results indicate that
UVRAG, as its name suggests, may play a role in protecting cells
from UV damage.
UVRAG Is Required for UV-Induced Photolesion Repair
Independently of Autophagy
Chromatin-associated cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)
are a sensitive and representative marker of UV-induced DNA
damage (Marteijn et al., 2014). We found that UV irradiation
induced comparable levels of CPDs in control and in UVRAG-
depleted melanoma cells (5 min time point in Figures 1D–1F,
S2C, and S2D). However, more CPDs retained 24 hr post-UV
in UVRAG-depleted cells, which were rescued by introducing
UVRAGWT, but not UVRAGL286F (Figures 1D–1F, S2C, and
S2D). Consistently, ectopic expression of UVRAGWT, but not
UVRAGL286F, enhanced the clearance rate of UV-induced dam-
age (Figures S2A, S2B, S2E, and S2F). These data support a
role for UVRAG in photodamage repair.
To explore whether the UV damage-protecting role of UVRAG
might be related to autophagy, we examined the effect of
UVRAG on CPD levels in autophagy-deficient Atg5 knockout
immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs) (Kuma
et al., 2004). UVRAG depletion induced a marked increase in
CPD foci in these cells, regardless of the autophagy status (Fig-
ures 1G and 1H). Analogous results were obtained when cells
were treated with Bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) to block autophago-
some degradation (Figures S3A and S3B). These data indicate
that UVRAG-mediated suppression of UV-induced photolesions
does not necessarily require functional autophagy machinery.
While these observations do not exclude a role for autophagy
in UV-induced damage, such an event would be downstream
of a critical UVRAG-dependent step in maintaining genetic
stability upon UV exposure. We next determined whether
UVRAGL286F, defective in UV protection as shown above, also
impairs the ability of UVRAG to promote autophagy by
measuring subcellular distribution of the autophagy marker
GFP-LC3 and levels of the autophagosome-associated LC3
(LC3-II). UVRAGL286F enhanced rapamycin-induced autophagy
to a similar extent as UVRAGWT, as evidenced by increased
compared to actin levels (F). Data shown represent mean ± SD; n = 200 cells, data pooled from three independent experiments. Scale bar, 20 mm. *p < 0.05, ****p <

control shRNA or UVRAG-specific shRNA and then subjected to UV-C. The percent distribution of CPD foci before UV, and 5 min, 6 hr, and 24 hr post-UV was
determined (G). Protein levels of UVRAG and Atg5 are shown (H). Scale bar, 20 mm. Data are mean ± SD from three independent experiments. ****p < 0.0001

deficient, and XPA-deficient cells served as controls. Filled bars, UV irradiated; open bars, no UV. Typical UDS and RRS images are provided in Figure S3E. Data

 GFP-LC3 puncta per cell, increased LC3-II conversion, and
increased response to the late-stage autophagy inhibitor Baf-
A1 (Figures S3C and S3D). These results indicate that UVRAG
directly regulates photolesion repair through a mechanism inde-
pendent of UVRAG-mediated autophagy.
UVRAG Interacts with the CRL4DDB2 E3 Ligase Complex
in GG-NER
UV-induced DNA damage is predominantly repaired by NER
(Garibyan and Fisher, 2010). We used two different assays, i.e.,
unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and recovery of RNA synthe-
sis (RRS), to specifically measure two major NER pathways,
GG-NER and TC-NER, respectively (Hasegawa et al., 2010).
GG-NER-deficient (DDB2 and XPC) cells, TC-NER-deficient
(CSA) cells, and GG-NER- and TC-NER-deficient XPA cells
were included as controls. UVRAG knockdown resulted in a sig-
nificant reduction in UDS, as occurred in DDB2- and XPC-defi-
cient cells (Figures 1I and S3E). No significant effect was
observed on TC-NER rate upon UVRAG knockdown (Figures 1I
and S3E). In accord, ectopic expression of UVRAG specifically
promoted the rate of UDS, but not that of RRS, after UV treat-
ment (Figure 1I). While these observations do not exclude a
role for UVRAG in TC-NER, they support a major role for UVRAG
in GG-NER. Unlike UVRAG, knockdown of Beclin1, an interactor
of UVRAG in autophagy (Liang et al., 2006), did not affect
GG-NER (Figure S3F), again suggesting that UVRAG has an
autophagy-independent function to regulate NER.
To elucidate the mechanism by which UVRAG functions in
GG-NER, we immunoaffinity-purified Flag-UVRAG before and
after UV exposure of A375 cells and analyzed UVRAG-interact-
ing proteins by mass spectrometry (Figures S4A and S4B).
DDB1 was identified with high confidence as a prominent candi-
date. DDB1 forms a heterodimer with DDB2 and serves as a
substrate adaptor of Cul4A-Roc1 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) com-
plex in GG-NER (Angers et al., 2006; He et al., 2006). An interac-
tion between recombinant UVRAG and DDB1 was detected
in vitro, supporting their direct interaction (Figure S4C). UVRAG
was co-immunoprecipitated with DDB1 both endogenously
and exogenously (Figures 2A and S4D). The formation of the
UVRAG-DDB1 complex in response to UV irradiation was further
evaluated by the single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) assay (Jain
et al., 2011). Cells co-expressing Flag-DDB1 and UVRAG-GFP
were UV irradiated; the lysates were applied to single-molecule
imaging chambers coated with anti-Flag or control antibodies
(Figure S4E). UVRAG-GFP fluorescence spots, which marked in-
dividual immobilized DDB1-UVRAG complexes, were drasti-
cally increased in the anti-Flag-coated chambers after UV as
compared to the untreated and the control channels (Figures
S4F and S4G), indicative of an increased UVRAG-DDB1 com-
plex formation upon UV irradiation. In fact, both endogenous
and exogenous UVRAG can be co-immunoprecipitated with
Cul4A, Roc1, and DDB2, and to a greater extent after UV irradi-
ation (Figures 2A, S4H, and S4I), suggesting that UVRAG asso-
ciates with CRL4DDB2 in NER. Consistently, no interaction was
detected between Beclin1 and DDB2, suggesting that Beclin1
is not involved in the UVRAG-CRL4DDB2 complex formation
(Figure S4J).
Using several UVRAG and DDB1 deletion mutants, we identi-
fied residues 230–305 in the CCD of UVRAG and the b-propeller
C domain (BPC) of DDB1 as mediators of their interaction (Fig-
ures S4K–S4O). Notably, we have previously shown that
UVRAGDCCD, albeit defective in DDB1 interaction, preserved
the activity in double-strand break (DSB) repair that engages
the C-terminal residues 584–699 (Zhao et al., 2012), suggesting
that UVRAG association with DDB1 is structurally and function-
ally distinguishable from its DSB repair activities. Importantly, the
L286F mutation in the CCD was deficient in DDB1 binding,
whereas alanine substitution of another conserved residue
(R253) impaired, but did not completely eliminate, DDB1 binding
(Figure 2B). This result is in agreement with the fact that
the DDB1-binding-defective L286F is impaired in repair of UV-
induced DNA damage (Figures 1D, 1E, S2A, and S2B). Given
that UVRAG CCD is also engaged in binding Beclin1 (Liang
et al., 2006), we examined whether the Beclin1 binding activity
of UVRAG is affected by the L286F mutation. Both UVRAGWT
and UVRAGL286F, but not UVRAGDCCD, co-immunoprecipitated
with Beclin1 (Figure 2C). This was consistent with previous
observations demonstrating that UVRAGL286F, albeit defective
in UV protection, remains competent for autophagy.
UVRAG Is Required for Efficient Recruitment of NER
Factors to UV-Induced Damage Sites
Despite overall cytoplasmic distribution of UVRAG under normal
conditions, we observed specific recruitment of WT, but not the
(D) Recruitment of UVRAG to UV-induced CPD sites and its co-localization with the UV-DDB-Cul4A-Roc1 complex proteins. HeLa cells were micropore UV-C
(100 J/m2) irradiated (pore size, 5 mm) and immunostained with anti-UVRAG (green), anti-CPD (red, first row), anti-DDB2 (red, second row), anti-DDB1 (red, third
row), anti-Cul4A (red, fourth row), anti-Roc1 (red, fifth row), or anti-XPC (red, sixth row), followed by confocal microscopy. The insets highlight co-localization of
UVRAG with the GG-NER proteins at CPD sites. Right panel shows quantification of the frequency of UVRAG co-localizing with UV-induced CPD or GG-NER
proteins. Data represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments (n = 200). See also Figure S5A for multi-cell images. Scale bar, 20 mm.
(E) UVRAG Knockdown inhibited XPC recruitment to the UV-induced CPD sites. HeLa cells stably expressing control shRNA or UVRAG shRNA were micropore
UV-C (100 J/m2) irradiated (pore size: 5 mm), and immunostained with anti-CPD (red) and anti-UVRAG (1st row), anti-DDB1 (2nd row), anti-Cul4A (3rd row), anti-
Roc1 (4th row), anti-DDB2 (5th row), or anti-XPC (6th row). Right panel shows quantification of the colocalization of the indicated GG-NER proteins with CPD foci.
Data shown represent mean ± SD; n = 200 cells obtained by gathering data from three independent experiments. ****p < 0.0001. See also Figure S5H for multi-cell
images. Scale bar, 20 mm.
(F) UVRAG knockdown inhibited endogenous DDB2 interaction with XPC. HeLa cells expressing control shRNA or UVRAG shRNA were treated with or without
UV. WCLs were then used for IP with anti-DDB2 and IB for XPC and the CRL4DDB2 complex subunits.
(G) Effect of UVRAG on the complex assembly of DDB2 with XPC and with the CRL4DDB2 ubiquitin ligase proteins. A375 cells stably expressing UVRAG-specific
shRNA complemented with an empty vector, or with WT UVRAG or the L286F mutant, were UV-C treated. WCLs, 30 min post-UV irradiation, were used for IP with
anti-DDB2 followed by IB with the indicated antibodies.

 DDB1-binding-defective L286F and DCCD mutants of UVRAG,
to CPD foci, where it co-localized with DDB2, DDB1, Cul4A,
Roc1, and XPC after UV irradiation (Figures 2D and S5A–S5D).
Knockdown of DDB1 or deficiency of DDB2 inhibited UVRAG
translocation to UV-damaged sites (Figures S5E–S5G). But in
TCR-related CSA knockout cells, UVRAG still accumulated at
CPD, again indicative of a specific role of UVRAG in GG-NER
(Figures S5E and S5F). Depletion of either XPC or the down-
stream XPA did not change the association of UVRAG with
UV-damaged sites, suggesting that UVRAG translocates to
CPD sites prior to XPC (Figures S5E and S5F). Conversely,
knockdown
of
UVRAG
significantly
reduced
UV-induced
XPC recruitment, as well as the downstream NER effector
XPB, to the damaged sites, though not appreciably affecting
that of DDB2, DDB1, Cul4A, and Roc1 (Figures 2E and S5H).
Indeed, DDB1 and Cul4A were able to be co-immunoprecipi-
tated with DDB2 in UVRAG-depleted cells, whereas XPC inter-
action with DDB2 was reduced, even after UV irradiation
(Figure 2F). Endogenous DDB2-XPC interaction in UVRAG-
depleted cells could be restored by re-expression of UVRAGWT,
but not UVRAGL286F (Figure 2G). Therefore, UVRAG is required
for effective association of XPC with DDB2 after UV irradiation
in vivo. Our results conform to a model where UVRAG translo-
cates to UV-induced DNA lesions through DDB1, and UVRAG
interaction with the DDB1-containing CRL4DDB2 complex then
helps recruit XPC.
UVRAG Promotes the Assembly and the Cul4A
Neddylation of CRL4DDB2 E3 Ligase Complex
DDB1 functions in NER as part of a complex with Cul4A-Roc1
ubiquitin ligase (Angers et al., 2006). Furthermore, NEDD8 modi-
fication of Cul4A represents a critical mechanism to activate the
Cul4A-based E3 ligase by inducing structural reorganization to
promote the processivity of ubiquitin transfer (Bennett et al.,
2010). Since UVRAG promotes DDB1-dependent NER, we eval-
uated the effects of UVRAG on assembly and activity of the
CRL4DDB2 complex. As shown in Figure 3A, expression of
UVRAG, but not of UVRAGL286F, resulted in increased reciprocal
co-immunoprecipitation of DDB1 with Cul4A without affecting
their overall levels in cells, while accompanied by increased ned-
dylation of Cul4A. In contrast, less Cul4A co-immunoprecipi-
tated with DDB1 in UVRAG-depleted cells, concomitant with a
clear reduction in Cul4A neddylation (Figure 3B). Reintroducing
UVRAGWT, but not UVRAGL286F, reverted the assembly and the
neddylation of DDB1-Cul4A complex (Figure 3B). In accord, we
also observed that UVRAG expression accelerated the NEDD8
modification of Cul4A after UV irradiation in cells expressing
HA-Cul4A (Figure 3C). In contrast, removal of UVRAG or expres-
sion of UVRAGL286F in UVRAG-depleted cells caused a lack
of UV-induced Cul4A neddylation (Figures 3D, 4A, and 4B). We
next tested whether the change in Cul4A neddylation is specific
to UVRAG per se. Using in vitro neddylation assay with purified
recombinant proteins of UVRAG, DDB1, and Cul4A-Roc1, we
observed a dose-dependent increase in Cul4A neddylation by
UVRAG in the presence of DDB1 as expected (Figure 3E).
Notably, in UV-irradiated cells in vivo, the positive effect of
UVRAG on UV-induced Cul4A neddylation was abrogated by
depletion of DDB2 (Figure S6A), suggesting that DDB2 acts
upstream of UVRAG during the UV damage-induced Cul4A
modification. These results indicate that UVRAG, through its
interaction with DDB1, is necessary to promote the assembly
and the neddylation of the CRL4DDB2 E3 ligase, which is needed
for GG-NER.
CAND1 has previously been suggested to sequester unneddy-
lated Cullins and compete with the substrate adaptors for bind-
ing to the Cullin-RING complexes, rendering them in an inactive
form (Bennett et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2002). We
thus asked whether UVRAG might also antagonize the inhibitory
effect of CAND1 on Cul4A sequestration. Despite their apparent
interaction, we detected less Cul4A co-immunoprecipitated
with CAND1 upon ectopically expressed UVRAGWT, but not
UVRAGL286F, in a dose-dependent manner (Figures S6B and
S6C). Consistently, depletion of UVRAG prevented dissociation
of Cul4A from CAND1 upon UV irradiation, which was reverted
by re-expression of UVRAGWT, but not UVRAGL286F (Figure 4A).
Importantly, no CAND1 was detected in the UVRAG immuno-
complex, and conversely no UVRAG and no DDB1 were de-
tected in the CAND1 immunocomplex, whereas Cul4A was
readily detected in both CAND1 and UVRAG-DDB1 complexes,
suggesting mutually exclusive binding of CAND1 and UVRAG to
Cul4A (Figure 4C). Additionally, CAND1 selectively associated
with unneddylated Cul4A as seen previously (He et al., 2006;
Hu et al., 2004), whereas UVRAG and DDB1 could associate
with Cul4A, regardless of Cul4A neddylation status (Figure 4C).
In agreement with the previous report (He et al., 2006), CAND1
expression resulted in decreased levels of Cul4A neddylation
and a concomitant reduction in Cul4A bound to DDB1 (Figures
4D and 4E). By contrast, co-expression of UVRAG reverted the
CAND1-mediated inhibition of Cul4A neddylation as well as
Cul4A-DDB1 association, while UVRAGL286F failed to do so (Fig-
ures 4D, 4E, and S6D). Together, these results consistently indi-
cate that UVRAG is essential for the dynamic complex assembly
and activation of the CRL4DDB2 complex in NER.
UVRAG Interaction with CRL4DDB2 Is Required for
Ubiquitin-Mediated Proteolysis in NER
The CRL4DDB2 complex is required to remodel chromatin at UV
lesions by catalyzing the ubiquitination of histones and NER fac-
tors, a prerequisite for XPC CPD site recruitment in GG-NER
(Duan and Smerdon, 2010). We next examined the effects of
UVRAG on ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by the CRL4DDB2
complex in NER. We detected the slower migrating forms of
histones H3/H4 after UV irradiation (Figure 4F), corresponding
to ubiquitinated histones (Figure S6E), which were barely detect-
able in UVRAG knockdown cells and in UVRAGL286F-comple-
mented cells, but not in UVRAGWT-complemented cells (Fig-
ure 4F). As previously reported (Sugasawa et al., 2005), UV
irradiation triggered strong XPC ubiquitination but was also
abrogated in UVRAG-depleted cells (Figure 4F). Re-expression
of UVRAGWT, but not UVRAGL286F, restored XPC ubiquitination
after UV irradiation (Figure 4F), which was shown to enhance
its DNA-binding affinity (Sugasawa, 2006). Moreover, we noted
that DDB2 levels rapidly decreased after UV irradiation. How-
ever, depletion of UVRAG or re-expression of UVRAGL286F
prevented DDB2 degradation (Figure 4F). Consistent with the
previous finding that DDB2 is polyubiquitinated by the CRL4DDB2

 E3 ligase and ultimately degraded to allow spatial access of XPC
to DNA lesion (El-Mahdy et al., 2006), we observed that UV-
induced reduction of DDB2 levels was suppressed by the pro-
teasome inhibitor MG132 in UV-irradiated cells co-expressing
Myc-DDB2 and HA-ubiquitin (Figure S6F). Likewise, overexpres-
sion of UVRAG promoted the amount of ubiquitin immunopre-
cipitated with DDB2 in UV-irradiated cells, whereas depletion
of UVRAG decreased the rapid turnover of DDB2 and stabilized
DDB2 after UV irradiation (Figures S6F, S6G, and 4F). In agree-

ment with the CAND1 results above,
expression of UVRAG alleviated the inhib-
itory effect of CAND1 on Cul4A-mediated
DDB2 ubiquitination upon UV irradiation
(Figure 4G). Finally, in a complementary
approach, we analyzed dynamic associa-
tion of DDB2 with photolesions. Knock-
down of UVRAG produced a significant
delay of removal of DDB2 from CPD foci
and a concomitant reduction in CPD
repair (Figures 4H and 4I). These results
indicate that UVRAG interaction with
DDB1 promotes substrate ubiquitination
mediated by the CRL4DDB2 E3 ligase after
UV irradiation, which destabilizes damage-containing nucleo-
somes to displace substrates from DNA lesions, facilitating
recruitment of downstream effectors to initiate NER. In line
with this, inactivation of UVRAG had minimal effect on the repair
of UV-damaged naked DNA in vitro, as did DDB2 deficiency (Fig-
ure S6H), suggesting that like UV-DDB (Rapi�
c Otrin et al., 1998),
UVRAG is important for the repair of photolesions within a chro-
matin context by a mechanism that involves the CRL4DDB2 E3
ligase activation.

 In accord, ectopic expression of UVRAG reduced UV-
induced cell death in melanoma cells, as shown by increased
rates of clonogenic survival, but not in cells depleted of
DDB1 and Cul4A (Figures S6I–S6L). Analogous results were

 UVRAG Inhibits UV-Induced Damage In Vivo
UVRAG is highly conserved, with closely related orthologs pre-
sent in fly (designated as dUVRAG) and mammals (Lee et al.,
2011; L}
orincz et al., 2014; Taka
´ ts et al., 2014). To test UVRAG-
mediated UV protection in vivo, we used developing Drosophila
pupal
retina
model
to
evaluate
UV-induced
damage
by
comparing the tissue loss in the irradiated eye versus the un-
treated one in the same animal (Kelsey et al., 2012). Depletion
of dUVRAG by RNAi exclusively in the retina resulted in a signif-
icant loss of ommatidial structures compared to control RNAi, as
seen by inhibition of DDB1 (dDDB1), suggesting both genes are
essential in UV protection (Figures 5A–5C). Combined interfer-
ence with both dUVRAG and dDDB1 showed similar effects,
leading to an eye of reduced size. Ectopic expression of
dUVRAG prevented UV-induced loss of ommatidia, yet this ef-
fect was largely suppressed when dDDB1 was silenced (Figures
5A–5C), further supporting a DDB1-dependent function of
UVRAG in UV protection.
To validate that tissue damage reflects an impaired UV-
induced damage repair, we assessed CPD levels in the retina
of UVRAG mosaic eye clones. The non-labeled UVRAG homozy-
gous mutant cells were surrounded by the WT cells marked by
GFP (Figure 5D). We found that shortly after UV irradiation of
eye imaginal discs, there were comparable levels of CPDs in
WT and dUVRAG-depleted cells (Figures 5D and 5E). However,
12 hr post-irradiation, high levels of CPDs persisted in dUVRAG-
depleted cells (Figures 5D and 5E). As seen with dDDB1 RNAi
(dDDB1-Ri), the survival rate of dUVRAG mutant larva with allelic

whereas overexpression of dUVRAG (GMR > dUVRAG) reduces UV-triggered tissue loss in the retina. The protective effect of UVRAG was lost when dDDB1 was

 loss of UVRAG (UVRAGB7 and UVRAGB21) or with dUVRAG RNAi
(dUVRAG-Ri) was significantly reduced as compared to WT
larva, while ectopic expression of dUVRAG conferred UV resis-
tance in a largely DDB1-dependent manner (Figures 5F–5H).
These data indicate that UVRAG plays a conserved role in UV-
induced DNA damage repair in vivo.
UVRAG Is Associated with Decreased UV-Signature
Loads in Melanoma
Recent landmark studies revealed an abundance of UV-induced
DNA damage in melanoma genomes compared to most other
types of tumors, thereby directly linking UV irradiation to mela-
noma (Berger et al., 2012; Hodis et al., 2012; Pleasance et al.,
2010). To explore the clinical relevance of UVRAG to UV-induced
mutagenesis in melanoma, we analyzed all TCGA (The Cancer
Genome Atlas) provisional melanoma patient datasets (Berger
et al., 2012; Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013; Hodis et al.,
2012) and observed that higher UVRAG expression (Z score)
was associated with lower rates of UV-signature mutations,
i.e., C>T/G>A transitions at dipyrimidine sites, in skin cutaneous
melanoma (SKCM) (Figure 6A; p = 0.0008; two-sided Wilcoxon
rank-sum test), whereas no association was detected for C>T/
G>A transitions at non-dipyrimidine sites (Figure 6B; p =
0.6815; two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Notably, the overall
mutation rate at dipyrimidine sites was not significantly affected

test). Analogous assessment of UV-signa-
ture mutations in the UV-shielded uveal
melanoma (UVM) revealed minimal associ-
ation with UVRAG expression (Figures 6C
and 6D), suggesting a specific role for
UVRAG in melanoma UV-like mutagen-
esis. Indeed, a higher load of UV-specific
mutagenesis was observed in UVRAGL286F
melanoma
(�94%)
as compared
with
UVRAGWT ones (Figure S7B), consistent
with its defective phenotype in NER.
Univariate analysis revealed that SKCM
patients with higher expression of UVRAG appeared to have
increased overall survival compared to those with lower expres-
sion of UVRAG (Figure S7C; p = 0.0268). In fact, lower UVRAG
expression appeared to be more frequent in SKCM cases with
advanced tumor, node, and metastasis stage (Figure S7D).
These data support an indispensable role of UVRAG in protect-
ing against UV-induced mutagenesis in skin melanoma, which
may further affect disease development and progression.
DISCUSSION
Herein, we demonstrated that UVRAG promotes UV-induced
DNA damage repair by targeting DDB1. DDB1 interaction allows
UVRAG to be recruited to the damaged foci after UV exposure,
facilitating the assembly of the substrate-binding UV-DDB with
the catalytic subunit Cul4A-Roc1 to form a functional CRL4DDB2
E3 complex. Consequently, activation of CRL4DDB2-driven ubiq-
uitin-mediated proteolysis remodels the chromatin around the
damaged sites, allowing the lesions accessible to downstream
NER factors (Figure 7). Disruption of UVRAG-DDB1 interac-
tion inhibited ubiquitination and association of XPC with UV-
damaged CPD sites. Thus, UVRAG represents a key regulator
in GG-NER. In addition, transgenic expression of UVRAG ortho-
log reduced levels of UV damage in Drosophila retina, indicating
that the NER function of UVRAG occurs in vivo and not only
516

 in vitro. Furthermore, association of UVRAG with reduced UV-
signature loads in skin melanoma underscores the importance
of NER fidelity in antagonizing UV-associated genetic instability
of skin cancer.
Autophagic tumor suppressor UVRAG is a multitasking protein
that can influence a plethora of homeostatic pathways, including
membrane trafficking, centrosome integrity, and chromosomal
stability (He et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2006, 2008; Zhao et al.,
2012). Our results unraveled a nuclear function of UVRAG in
ensuring UV-induced NER independent of its ability to regulate
autophagy. UVRAG-mediated GG-NER is abrogated by point
mutation (L286F) in UVRAG that blocks binding to DDB1 but
remains competent for autophagy activation, suggesting that
DDB1 interaction of UVRAG is specific and essential for NER.
Moreover, autophagy loss or inhibition of autophagic flux could
not forestall UV damage induced by UVRAG deficiency. Further-
more, it is the coiled-coil region that mediates the NER effect of
UVRAG, which is separable from other interactions of UVRAG
involved in the regulation of trafficking, centrosome, and DNA-
PK (He et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2012). These observations argue
Figure 7. Model of UVRAG-Mediated Regu-
lation of the NER Pathway
Upon UV irradiation, UVRAG recruits to UV-
induced DNA damage sites and associates with
DDB1. The UVRAG-DDB1 interaction antagonizes
CAND1 sequestration of Cul4A and enhances
the modular complex assembly of the Cul4A-Roc1
ubiquitin ligase with the substrate receptor UV-
DDB, resulting in Cul4A neddylation and enzyme
activation. Consequently, ubiquitin-mediated pro-
teolysis of histones H3/H4 and DDB2 leads to
relaxation of the nucleosome around the photo-
damage, enabling access of XPC and downstream
effectors to the damaged sites to initiate NER
cascade and repair the damage. Hence, UVRAG

for an independent role of UVRAG-DDB1
interaction in the regulation of NER.
The regulatory effects of UVRAG are
associated with activation of the DDB1-
containing
CRL4DDB2
ubiquitin
ligase
complex by inducing the complex assem-
bly and the Cul4A neddylation. Previous
findings suggest that Cullin neddylation,
and by extension CRL activity, is antago-
nized by the COP9 signalosome com-
plex (CSN)-mediated deneddylation and
CAND1-mediated
Cul4A
sequestration
(Bennett et al., 2010). Although it remains
possible that UVRAG may antagonize the
effect of CSN to keep Cul4A in an active
form, association of UVRAG with both
neddylated and unneddylated Cul4A sug-
gests that binding of UVRAG to the Cul4A
complex is not rate limiting for CSN-medi-
ated deneddylation. In line with this, ectopic expression of
UVRAG competes with CAND1 for Cul4A binding, whereas
depletion of UVRAG results in increased Cul4A sequestration
by CAND1, both in a DDB1-dependent manner in vivo. Thus,
UVRAG activation of Cul4A may involve at least in part the
release of Cul4A from CAND1 sequestration. Interestingly, our
analysis of Cul4A neddylation in a cell-free system revealed
that UVRAG could promote the neddylation reaction in the
absence of CAND1, but not in the absence of DDB1, suggesting
that it is the substrate adaptor, but not CAND1, that plays a more
direct role in the neddylation process regulated by UVRAG. Our
study is thus consistent with recent work highlighting a major role
for substrate adaptor modules in the dynamic organization and
activation of CRL complexes (Bennett et al., 2010).
Whereas Cul4A plays a positive role in UV-induced NER
(Kamileri et al., 2012; Sugasawa, 2009), a previous study (Liu
et al., 2009) reported that Cul4a deletion caused resistance
against, rather than sensitivity to, UV-induced skin tumors in a
mouse model. This paradox is unresolved but could be rational-
ized through the view that the Cul4A-based E3 ligase undergoes

 dynamic complex reorganization and cycles of neddylation in
order to be fully functional in cells. It is possible that persistent
inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis due to genetic
Cul4A inactivation can enhance stability of a subset of NER fac-
tors, thereby leading to prolonged NER signaling (El-Mahdy
et al., 2006). It is also worth noting that Cul4A-based ubiquitin
ligase not only acts in NER, but functions widely by partnering
with different factors under diverse environmental cues (Bennett
et al., 2010). In our study, we focused on the role of UVRAG in
DDB1 and Cul4A regulation in NER, a major defense mechanism
against UV damage. Furthermore, treating melanoma cells with
Cullin inhibitor sensitized cells to UV-induced damage. Thus,
our findings demonstrate that at least in this context, UVRAG
activated Cul4A-based E3 ligase functions to promote, rather
than inhibit, DNA damage repair by NER.
NER fidelity constitutes an important melanoma risk biomarker
and predicts melanoma survival (Emmert and Kraemer, 2013).
Hence, the ability of UVRAG to promote NER is of importance
with respect to melanoma and other UV-associated malig-
nancies. Of note, UVRAG was initially discovered for its ability
to complement UV sensitivity of XP (Emmert and Kraemer,
2013; Perelman et al., 1997). In addition to other effects of
UVRAG, the activating effects of UVRAG on DDB1-dependent
NER may prevent environmental UV-induced DNA damage and
thereof the development of melanoma. In fact, the NER-defective
L286F mutation of UVRAG identified in melanoma patients was
associated with a high mutation load dominated by UV-like muta-
genesis (Berger et al., 2012; Hodis et al., 2012). Given that
UVRAG expression is positively associated with reduced UV
signature in cutaneous melanoma, but not in UV-shielded mel-
anoma, UVRAG may represent a predisposing factor for UV-
associated genetic instability. Future studies on the role of
UVRAG-DDB1 interactions in UV-induced genomic instability
will advance our understanding of NER and its fundamental
significance in skin cancers.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
UDS and RRS Assays
UDS detection was performed using a Click-iT DNA AlexaFluor Imaging kit
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after
global irradiation (20 J/m2), cells on coverslips were incubated for 4 hr with
5 mM 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU), then washed with PBS, fixed, and per-
meabilized before incubation for 30 min with the Click-iT reaction cocktail con-
taining AlexaFluor Azide 488. After washing, the coverslips were mounted with
mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Labs). Cell images were analyzed as
for the RRS assay (see below). For each sample, at least 200 nuclei (non-
S-phase) were analyzed per condition of three independent experiments. Of
note, non-S-phase cells can be easily differentiated from strong signals from
scheduled DNA synthesis in S-phase cells.
For RRS, RNA detection was performed using a Click-iT RNA AlexaFluor
Imaging kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, cells were UV-C irradiated (10 J/m2) and incubated for 5 min (as a refer-
ence to show transcription is inhibited by UV irradiation) or for 4 hr at 37�C, fol-
lowed by 2 hr incubation with 100 mM 5-ethynyl uridine (EU). Cells were then
fixed and permeabilized in 4% formaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS,
and after washing with PBS, incubated for 30 min with the Click-iT reaction
cocktail containing AlexaFluor Azide 488. Cells were then washed with
PBST (0.05% Tween-20), and the coverslips were mounted with mounting
medium (Vectashield, Vector Labs). Images of the cells were obtained with a
Nikon Eclipse C1 confocal microscope, and the average fluorescence intensity
per nucleus was quantified by NIS-Elements software and normalized to the
mock-treated cells. For each sample, at least 200 nuclei were analyzed from
three independent experiments.
CPD Staining in Drosophila Eye Imaginal Disc
The third instar larvae were dissected and cultured in Shields and Sang M3 in-
sect medium (Sigma S3652), which was supplemented with 10% FCS and
0.5% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). After PBS washing, imaginal discs
were irradiated with UV bulb (20 J/m2) and recovered in Shields and Sang
M3 insect medium for 30 min or 12 hr. All imaginal discs were fixed and stained
with anti-CPD (TDM-2, Cosmo Bio) primary antibodies as described previously
(Yan et al., 2010). The discs were then incubated with fluorescent-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Confocal images were
collected using a Nikon Eclipse C1 confocal microscope with 603 oil objec-
tives. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Approximately 200
dUVRAG fly mutant clones were randomly chosen for CPD staining.
