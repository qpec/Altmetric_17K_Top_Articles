BACKGROUND
We evaluated whether rivaroxaban alone or in combination with aspirin would be more 
effective than aspirin alone for secondary cardiovascular prevention.
METHODS
In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 27,395 participants with stable athero-
sclerotic vascular disease to receive rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg 
once daily), rivaroxaban (5 mg twice daily), or aspirin (100 mg once daily). The pri-
mary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarc-
tion. The study was stopped for superiority of the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group after 
a mean follow-up of 23 months.
RESULTS
The primary outcome occurred in fewer patients in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group 
than in the aspirin-alone group (379 patients [4.1%] vs. 496 patients [5.4%]; hazard 
ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.86; P<0.001; z 
= 
−4.126), but major 
bleeding events occurred in more patients in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group (288 
patients [3.1%] vs. 170 patients [1.9%]; hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.05; 
P<0.001). There was no significant difference in intracranial or fatal bleeding between 
these two groups. There were 313 deaths (3.4%) in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group 
as compared with 378 (4.1%) in the aspirin-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 
0.71 to 0.96; P 
= 
0.01; threshold P value for significance, 0.0025). The primary outcome 
did not occur in significantly fewer patients in the rivaroxaban-alone group than in the 
aspirin-alone group, but major bleeding events occurred in more patients in the rivar-
oxaban-alone group.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, those assigned to rivar-
oxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin had better cardiovascular outcomes and more 
major bleeding events than those assigned to aspirin alone. Rivaroxaban (5 mg twice 
daily) alone did not result in better cardiovascular outcomes than aspirin alone and 
resulted in more major bleeding events. (Funded by Bayer; COMPASS ClinicalTrials.gov

espite the use of effective second-
ary prevention strategies, 5 to 10% of pa-
tients with cardiovascular disease have 
recurrent events each year.1 When used for sec-
ondary prevention, aspirin results in a 19% lower 
risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and 
a 9% lower risk of cardiovascular death than 
placebo.2 Long-term treatment with a vitamin K 
antagonist, alone or in combination with aspirin, 
is superior to aspirin for secondary prevention 
after acute myocardial infarction but is associated 
with more bleeding, including intracranial bleed-
ing.3 Thus, anticoagulation has generally not been 
recommended for patients in this context.
Rivaroxaban is a selective direct factor Xa in-
hibitor that is used to prevent and treat venous 
thromboembolism4-6 and to prevent stroke or sys-
temic embolism in atrial fibrillation.7 Among 
patients with an acute coronary syndrome, the 
risk of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocar-
dial infarction was lower with rivaroxaban (2.5 mg 
or 5 mg twice daily) than with placebo, and mor-
tality was lower with the dose of 2.5 mg twice 
daily than with placebo.8 However, the risk of 
major bleeding was higher with rivaroxaban (at 
either dose) than with placebo. We designed the 
Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anti-
coagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial to test 
the hypothesis that rivaroxaban in combination 
with aspirin or given alone is more effective than 
aspirin alone in preventing recurrent cardiovascu-
lar events, with acceptable safety, in patients with 
stable atherosclerotic vascular disease.
Methods
Trial Conduct
The COMPASS trial, conducted at 602 centers in 
33 countries, is a double-blind, double-dummy, 
randomized trial using a 3-by-2 partial factorial 
design and involving patients with a history of 
stable atherosclerotic vascular disease.9 In one 
randomized comparison (now completed and 
reported here), rivaroxaban with or without aspi-
rin was compared with aspirin alone. In the 
other randomized comparison (still ongoing), 
pantoprazole is being compared with placebo in 
patients participating in the trial who are not 
receiving a proton-pump inhibitor. For an over-
view of the study design, see Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org.
The trial sponsor is Bayer. The steering com-
mittee, comprising Population Health Research 
Institute (PHRI) investigators, study leaders in 
each country, and Bayer representatives, was re-
sponsible for the development of the protocol, 
which is available at NEJM.org, and for the con-
duct and oversight of the study. The protocol was 
approved by the relevant health authorities and 
institutional review boards. A list of participating 
investigators and committee members is provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix. All the data 
analyses were independently performed at PHRI. 
The first author vouches for the completeness and 
accuracy of the data and analyses and for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Eligibility
Patients were eligible if they provided written in-
formed consent and met the criteria for coronary 
artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, or both 
(see the Supplementary Appendix). Patients with 
coronary artery disease who were younger than 
65 years of age were also required to have docu-
mentation of atherosclerosis involving at least two 
vascular beds or to have at least two additional 
risk factors (current smoking, diabetes mellitus, 
an estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] 
<60 ml per minute, heart failure, or nonlacunar 
ischemic stroke ≥1 month earlier). Exclusion crite-
ria were a high bleeding risk; a recent stroke or 
previous hemorrhagic or lacunar stroke; severe 
heart failure; advanced stable kidney disease (esti-
mated GFR <15 ml per minute); the use of dual 
antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, or other anti-
thrombotic therapy; and noncardiovascular con-
ditions deemed by the investigator to be associated 
with a poor prognosis. In addition, patients receiv-
ing a proton-pump inhibitor were not eligible for 
the pantoprazole randomization. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all the participants.
Randomization and Follow-up
Eligible participants (except those who underwent 
randomization 4 to 14 days after coronary-artery 
bypass graft [CABG] surgery) entered a run-in 
phase during which they received a rivaroxaban-
matched placebo twice daily and aspirin at a 
dose of 100 mg once daily. The purpose of the 
run-in phase was to identify participants who 
were unwilling or unable to adhere to the trial 
regimen, who had adverse events, or who were 
otherwise not suitable for randomization. Patients 
who underwent randomization 4 to 14 days after 
CABG surgery were not required to participate

in the run-in phase because thrombotic graft 
occlusion is most common during the first few 
weeks after surgery and we sought to enroll such 
patients promptly.
Participants who adhered to the assigned regi-
men and who did not have adverse events, as well 
as those enrolled 4 to 14 days after CABG surgery, 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin 
(100 mg once daily), rivaroxaban (5 mg twice 
daily) with an aspirin-matched placebo once daily, 
or aspirin (100 mg once daily) with a rivaroxaban-
matched placebo twice daily, stratified according 
to center and the use of proton-pump inhibitor 
therapy at the time of randomization. Study aspirin 
was enteric-coated. Patients who were eligible for 
the proton-pump inhibitor randomization were 
also randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
pantoprazole (40 mg once daily) or matched pla-
cebo. After randomization, participants were seen 
at 1 and 6 months and then at 6-month intervals.
Outcomes
The primary efficacy outcome for the randomized 
comparison of rivaroxaban with or without aspi-
rin versus aspirin alone was the composite of car-
diovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarc-
tion. The main safety outcome was a modification 
of the International Society on Thrombosis and 
Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria for major bleeding 
and included fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleed-
ing into a critical organ, bleeding into a surgical 
site requiring reoperation, and bleeding that led 
to hospitalization (including presentation to an 
acute care facility without an overnight stay). Un-
like the ISTH criteria,10 we considered all bleed-
ing that led to presentation to an acute care facil-
ity or hospitalization as major.
Three secondary efficacy outcomes were speci-
fied: the composite of ischemic stroke, myocardial 
infarction, acute limb ischemia, or death from 
coronary heart disease; the composite of ischemic 
stroke, myocardial infarction, acute limb ische-
mia, or cardiovascular death; and death from any 
cause. Tertiary efficacy outcomes included indi-
vidual components of the primary and secondary 
outcomes, as well as hospitalization for cardiovas-
cular causes, revascularization, limb amputation, 
stent thrombosis, angina, heart failure, venous 
thromboembolism, resuscitated cardiac arrest, 
and a new diagnosis of cancer. The net-clinical-
benefit outcome was the composite of cardiovas-
cular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, fatal 
bleeding, or symptomatic bleeding into a critical 
organ. The main outcome for the pantoprazole 
versus placebo randomization was upper gastro-
intestinal complications.9 Event definitions and a 
full list of prespecified events included in this re-
port are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
We planned on enrolling 27,400 participants. As 
an event-driven trial, with an expected control-
group event rate of 3.3 per 100 person-years, it 
was designed to continue until at least 2200 
participants had a confirmed primary efficacy 
outcome, thereby providing 90% power to detect 
a 20% lower risk in each of the two comparisons 
of rivaroxaban versus aspirin.
An independent data and safety monitoring 
board monitored the study, with formal stopping 
guidelines for efficacy and nonformal guidelines 
for safety. Two formal interim analyses of efficacy 
were planned, when 50% and 75% of primary 
efficacy events had occurred. A modified Hay-
bittle–Peto rule was used, which required a differ-
ence of 4 SD at the first interim analysis that was 
consistent over a period of 3 months, and a con-
sistent difference of 3 SD at the second interim 
analysis (see the Supplementary Appendix).
All the outcome events in all randomly as-
signed patients that occurred between random-
ization and the date of stopping the trial were 
included in the analysis, according to the inten-
tion-to-treat principle. Comparisons between each 
of the rivaroxaban-based groups and the common 
aspirin control group were performed with the 
use of two separate log-rank tests stratified ac-
cording to treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor 
(not randomly assigned to a proton-pump inhibi-
tor, pantoprazole at a dose of 40 mg once daily, 
or a pantoprazole-matched placebo once daily). 
To address multiplicity related to testing two pri-
mary and six secondary hypotheses, we planned 
to use a mixture gatekeeping procedure based 
on the Hochberg test to control the familywise 
error rate of 5%11 (see the Supplementary Appen-
dix). However, an early stop of both antithrom-
botic treatment groups for efficacy had not been 
anticipated, and therefore a strategy for formal 
testing of secondary outcomes at the interim 
analysis was not prespecified.
Kaplan–Meier estimates of the cumulative risk 
were used to evaluate the timing of event occur-
rences in the three antithrombotic treatment 
groups. Hazard ratios and corresponding 95%

fied Cox proportional-hazards models. The as-
sumptions of the Cox models were verified with

tion against the log of time. All reported P values 
are two-sided.
Results
Participants
From March 2013 through May 2016, a total of 
27,395 persons who successfully completed the 
run-in phase or who were enrolled 4 to 14 days 
after CABG surgery were randomly assigned to 
rivaroxaban plus aspirin, rivaroxaban, or aspirin 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). A total 
of 2320 participants did not successfully com-
plete the run-in phase and were excluded.
Baseline characteristics are presented in Ta-
ble 1. The mean age of participants was 68.2 years, 
and 22.0% were women. Lipid-lowering agents 
were used by 89.8%, and angiotensin-converting–
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor block-
ers by 71.2%. The mean systolic blood pressure 
was 136 mm Hg, the mean diastolic blood pres-
sure 78 mm Hg, and the mean total cholesterol 
level 4.2 mmol per liter (162 mg per deciliter). A 
total of 90.6% of the participants had a history 
of coronary artery disease, and 27.3% had a his-
tory of peripheral arterial disease.
Early Termination, Follow-up, and Adherence
At the first formal interim analysis for efficacy 
(50% of planned events), the independent data 
and safety monitoring board recommended early 
termination of the randomized comparison of 
rivaroxaban with or without aspirin versus aspi-
rin alone on February 6, 2017, having observed 
a consistent difference in the primary efficacy 
outcome in favor of rivaroxaban plus aspirin 
(z 
= 
−4.592).
The z statistic for the comparison of rivar-
oxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin alone was 
larger than the prespecified 4 SD, but the z sta-
tistic for the comparison of rivaroxaban alone 
versus aspirin alone had not met this criterion 
(z 
= 
−2.44). Because there was a statistically sig-
nificant effect for both comparisons, the data 
and safety monitoring board recommended stop-
ping the rivaroxaban and aspirin groups of the 
trial.
Follow-up for the comparison of pantoprazole 
versus placebo continued and is ongoing. Vital 
status was available for 27,331 participants (99.8%) 
to February 6, 2017, and the mean duration of 
follow-up of these participants was 23 months 
(maximum duration, 47 months). At the final 
visit for this component of the trial, the per-
centage of participants who had permanently 
discontinued study treatment was 16.5% in the 
rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group, 17.0% in the riva-
roxaban-alone group, and 15.7% in the aspirin-
alone group.

emia, or cardiovascular death also occurred in 
fewer patients in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin 
group than in the aspirin-alone group (389 pa-
tients [4.3%] vs. 516 patients [5.7%]; hazard ra-
tio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001). There 
were 313 deaths (3.4%) in the rivaroxaban-plus-
aspirin group as compared with 378 (4.1%) in 
the aspirin-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% 
CI, 0.71 to 0.96; P 
= 
0.01). The threshold P value 
using the Hochberg procedure for each of the 
above comparisons was 0.0025. For the regimen 
of rivaroxaban alone as compared with aspirin 
alone, because no significant effect was seen for 
the primary composite outcome, formal testing 
of the secondary outcomes was not performed.
Bleeding and Other Adverse Events
Major bleeding events occurred in more patients 
in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group than in 
the aspirin-alone group (288 patients [3.1%] vs. 
170 patients [1.9%]; hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 
1.40 to 2.05; P<0.001) (Table 3), mainly owing to 
a difference in bleeding that led to presentation 
to an acute care facility or hospitalization. Most 
of the excess major bleeding was into the gastro-
intestinal tract, with no significant between-
group difference in the rate of fatal bleeding, in-
tracranial bleeding, or symptomatic bleeding into 
a critical organ. The rate of major bleeding as de-
fined by the ISTH criteria (the composite of fatal 
bleeding, bleeding into a critical organ, bleeding 
requiring ≥2 units of transfusion within 48 hours, 
and bleeding associated with a decrease in the 
hemoglobin level of ≥2 g per deciliter) was sig-
nificantly greater with rivaroxaban plus aspirin 
than with aspirin alone.
Major bleeding events occurred in more pa-
tients in the rivaroxaban-alone group than in the 
aspirin-alone group (255 patients [2.8%] vs. 170 
patients [1.9%]; hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.25 to 
1.84; P<0.001) (Table 3). The excess major bleed-
ing included symptomatic bleeding into a critical 
organ and bleeding that led to hospitalization.
Serious adverse events were reported in 721 pa-
tients (7.9%) assigned to rivaroxaban plus aspirin, 
702 (7.7%) assigned to rivaroxaban alone, and 662 
(7.3%) assigned to aspirin alone. Details of serious 
adverse events according to system organ class are 
shown in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Net Clinical Benefit
The risk of the composite net-clinical-benefit 
outcome of cardiovascular death, stroke, myo-
cardial infarction, fatal bleeding, or symptom-
atic bleeding into a critical organ was lower with 
rivaroxaban plus aspirin than with aspirin alone 
(431 patients [4.7%] vs. 534 patients [5.9%]; haz-
ard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.91; P<0.001) 
(Table 3). The risk of the net-clinical-benefit 
outcome was not significantly lower with rivar-
oxaban alone than with aspirin alone.
Subgroup Analyses
The effects of rivaroxaban plus aspirin as com-
pared with aspirin alone on the primary out-
come (Fig. 2) and on major bleeding (Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix) were consistent 
among subgroups that were defined according 
to age, sex, geographic region, race or ethnic 
group, body weight, renal function, and history 
of cardiovascular risk factors (tobacco use, hy-
pertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia). Results in 
participants who met the eligibility criteria for 
coronary artery disease and in those who met 
the eligibility criteria for peripheral arterial dis-
ease were also consistent and are being reported 
separately.12,13
Discussion
Among patients with stable atherosclerotic vas-
cular disease, a high proportion of whom were 
receiving proven secondary prevention therapies, 
the rate of the primary outcome (a composite of 
cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial in-
farction) was lower by 24% with rivaroxaban (2.5 
mg twice daily) plus aspirin than with aspirin 
alone (4.1% vs. 5.4%), but the rate of major 
bleeding was higher by 70% (3.1% vs. 1.9%). The 
rate of the net-clinical-benefit outcome was 
lower by 20% with rivaroxaban plus aspirin than 
with aspirin alone (4.7% vs. 5.9%). The com-
parison of rivaroxaban (5 mg twice daily) alone 
with aspirin alone did not show a significant 
difference in the primary outcome or the net-
clinical-benefit outcome, but the rate of major 
bleeding was higher with rivaroxaban alone.
Various antithrombotic regimens have been 
tested as alternatives to aspirin for long-term 
cardiovascular prevention. Trials of vitamin K 
antagonists involving patients with stable car-
diovascular disease showed a reduction in the 
risk of subsequent cardiovascular events,3 but 
there was no benefit in patients with peripheral 
arterial disease,14 and there was a significant 
increase in bleeding, including intracranial

Rivaroxaban in Stable Cardiovascular Disease
bleeding.3,14 Among patients with stable cardio-
vascular disease, those who received clopidogrel 
had a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular 
events than those who received aspirin, but there 
was no significant difference in the risk of car-
diovascular death or death from any cause.15 
Among patients with symptomatic stable cardio-
vascular disease or multiple risk factors, the 
combination of clopidogrel and aspirin did not 
result in a significantly lower rate of major ad-
verse cardiovascular events or death from any 
cause than aspirin alone.16 Among patients who 
had had myocardial infarction 1 to 3 years previ-
ously, the combination of ticagrelor and aspirin 
resulted in a lower rate of major adverse cardio-
vascular events and a higher rate of major bleed-
ing than aspirin alone, and there was no sig-
nificant between-group difference in mortality.17 
Among patients with stable peripheral arterial 
disease, ticagrelor did not result in a signifi-
cantly lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular 
events than clopidogrel.18 Among patients with 
stable cardiovascular disease who were receiving 
single or dual antiplatelet therapy, vorapaxar re-
sulted in a lower rate of major adverse cardiovas-
cular events and a higher rate of moderate or 
severe bleeding than placebo, with no significant 
between-group difference in mortality.19
The potential benefit of rivaroxaban in patients 
with cardiovascular disease was previously eval-
uated in the Anti-Xa Therapy to Lower Cardio-
vascular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy

One participant in the rivaroxaban‑alone group had more than one type of stroke. A total of 26 of the 392 participants who were reported to 
have atrial fibrillation had a stroke: 7 participants in the rivaroxaban‑plus‑aspirin group, 8 participants in the rivaroxaban‑alone group, and 
11 participants in the aspirin‑alone group.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
in Subjects with Acute Coronary Syndrome 2–
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 51 (ATLAS 
ACS 2–TIMI 51) trial. This trial tested rivaroxaban 
on a background of single or dual antiplatelet 
therapy in patients with a recent acute coronary 
syndrome. Rivaroxaban at a dose of 2.5 mg twice 
daily or 5 mg twice daily resulted in a lower rate 
of major adverse cardiovascular events than pla-
cebo, and the dose of 2.5 mg twice daily resulted 
in lower mortality,8 findings consistent with the 
COMPASS results. The mean duration of rivar-
oxaban treatment in the ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51 
trial was 13.3 months, whereas persons enrolled 
in the COMPASS trial who had a history of myo-
cardial infarction were enrolled a mean of 7.1 years 
after the acute event and continued to receive 
treatment for a mean of 23 months.
The definition of major bleeding in the 
COMPASS trial was based on the ISTH defini-
tion, which includes fatal bleeding, symptomatic 
bleeding into a critical area or organ, bleeding 
causing a decrease in the hemoglobin level of 2 g 
or more per deciliter, or bleeding that led to 
transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or 
red cells. However, the definition used in the 
COMPASS trial, which had been adopted in re-
sponse to a request from regulators, differed from 
the ISTH definition in that it did not take into 
account whether bleeding was associated with a 
decrease in the hemoglobin level or with blood 
transfusion, and it included any bleeding that 
led to hospitalization with or without an over-
night stay, thus including events that would not be 
considered major bleeding in other trials. Although 
there was also a significant increase in the rate 
of major bleeding with rivaroxaban with the use 
of the ISTH scale, there were approximately one 
third fewer major bleeding events with this defi-
nition than with the use of the modified ISTH 
definition. Our definition of net clinical benefit 
balanced the lower risk of cardiovascular death, 
stroke, or myocardial infarction against the most

There are a few limitations of the trial that 
should be considered. First, we did not specifi-

ever, of those enrolled, 1032 also had a history 
of stroke, and the benefits of the combination of

Rivaroxaban in Stable Cardiovascular Disease
combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin resulted 
in a lower rate of ischemic stroke than aspirin 
alone. Second, although the majority of patients 
were receiving proven secondary prevention ther-
apies, and the blood pressure and total choles-
terol levels were serially recorded during the 
study, we did not specifically record statin use or 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at base-
line, and the trial protocol did not specifically 
emphasize aggressive use of secondary preven-
tion therapies to lower blood pressure and cho-
lesterol levels. However, the results were consis-
tent in patients with baseline blood pressure 
below or above the mean and in those with 
baseline cholesterol levels below or above the 
median, supporting the conclusion that the bene-
fits of combination therapy are additive to those 
of other proven secondary preventive therapies. 
Third, trials that are stopped early for efficacy 
may overestimate the treatment effect. However, 
before the time of stopping, the data and safety 
monitoring board had observed a progressive in-
crease in benefit of the combination of rivaroxa-
ban and aspirin for more than 1 year. Further-
more, the data reported here include additional 
events that occurred before the cutoff but were 
not reported at the time of stopping the study 
and exclude some events that were refuted dur-
ing adjudication. It is noteworthy that the results 
based on events reported by the sites and after 
adjudication are nearly identical (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
In conclusion, in patients with stable athero-
sclerotic vascular disease, we compared three 
antiplatelet regimens: rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice 
daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily), rivaroxa-
ban (5 mg twice daily), and aspirin (100 mg once 
daily). The risk of major adverse cardiovascular 
events was significantly lower with the combina-
tion of rivaroxaban plus aspirin than with aspirin 
alone, and the risk of major bleeding was sig-
nificantly higher. Rivaroxaban alone did not re-
sult in a significantly lower risk of major adverse 
cardiovascular events than aspirin alone and 
resulted in a significantly higher risk of major 
bleeding.
