Abstract
Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular endosymbiont known to confer host resistance against
RNA viruses in insects. However, the causal mechanism underlying this antiviral defense
remains poorly understood. To this end, we have established a robust arthropod model
system to study the tripartite interaction involving Sindbis virus and Wolbachia strain wMel
within its native host, Drosophila melanogaster. By leveraging the power of Drosophila
genetics and a parallel, highly tractable D. melanogaster derived JW18 cell culture system,
we determined that in addition to reducing infectious virus production, Wolbachia negatively
influences Sindbis virus particle infectivity. This is further accompanied by reductions in viral
transcript and protein levels. Interestingly, unchanged ratio of proteins to viral RNA copies
suggest that Wolbachia likely does not influence the translational efficiency of viral tran-
scripts. Additionally, expression analyses of candidate host genes revealed D. melanoga-
ster methyltransferase gene Mt2 as an induced host factor in the presence of Wolbachia.
Further characterization of viral resistance in Wolbachia–infected flies lacking functional
Mt2 revealed partial recovery of virus titer relative to wild-type, accompanied by complete
restoration of viral RNA and protein levels, suggesting that Mt2 acts at the stage of viral
genome replication. Finally, knockdown of Mt2 in Wolbachia uninfected JW18 cells resulted
in increased virus infectivity, thus demonstrating its previously unknown role as an antiviral
factor against Sindbis virus. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence supporting the role
of Wolbachia–modulated host factors towards RNA virus resistance in arthropods, along-
side establishing Mt2’s novel antiviral function against Sindbis virus in D. melanogaster.
Author summary
Effective vector control is critically important to reduce the incidence of diseases caused
by arthropod transmitted viruses. One proposed strategy involves the use of endosymbi-
otic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis as a novel biocontrol agent to prevent RNA virus trans-
mission in mosquitoes. Previous work in the field suggests that the presence of this
bacterium induces virus resistance within the host. However, the underlying mechanism
of this antiviral phenotype is poorly understood, impeding its widespread use. Using the

 alphavirus, Sindbis as our model, we explored the tripartite interaction between the virus
and the endosymbiont within its natural host, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this
study, we show that Wolbachia negatively influences multiple important aspects of the
virus life cycle, extending our current understanding of the molecular nature of this inter-
action. We also provide evidence highlighting the role of a host gene, Mt2, in Wolbachia–
mediated antiviral resistance, while uncovering its previously unknown role as an antiviral
host factor against Sindbis virus.
Introduction
Heritable symbioses are pervasive in nature and exceedingly common in the insect world,
where many endosymbiotic associations have been described [1]. Wolbachia pipientis is an
alpha-proteobacterial, maternally transmitted endosymbiont that invades insect host popula-
tions by manipulating host reproduction, favoring infected females [2]. It is present in approx-
imately 40% of insects, including several species of Drosophila and important disease vectors
such as Aedes albopictus and Culex species of common house mosquitoes [3]. In D. melanoga-
ster, Wolbachia strain wMel exhibits weak reproductive manipulation [4], but recent work has
shown that this Wolbachia strain can also protect D. melanogaster from common viral patho-
gens such as Drosophila C virus (DCV), cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), and Flock House virus
(FHV), as evidenced by increased survival and delay in virus accumulation [5, 6]. Not surpris-
ingly, Wolbachia–mediated antiviral protection, so-called “pathogen blocking” is considered
an exciting phenomenon that could be leveraged to reduce arthropod-transmitted diseases [7].
While A. albopictus infected with its native Wolbachia strain (wAlbB) has little to no effect
on RNA virus replication (such as Dengue), transinfection of non-native Wolbachia strains
like wMel into this mosquito species, as well as the naturally uninfected Aedes aegypti, have
been shown to induce pronounced antiviral resistance [8, 9]. Moreover, field trials conducted
as a part of the global Eliminate Dengue project have demonstrated that these transinfected A.
aegypti mosquitos can invade native A. aegypti mosquito populations, persisting over the sea-
sons [10, 11]. However, although Wolbachia’s pathogen-blocking ability is currently being
implemented in vector control, we know little to nothing about the mechanism underlying
Wolbachia-induced antiviral resistance. Mosquitos as a model suffer from a lack of widely
accessible genetic tools, coupled with the added complexity of introducing Wolbachia transin-
fections. Conversely, the antiviral phenotype was originally characterized in Drosophila and
the genetic tractability of this model organism makes it an ideal candidate platform for a mech-
anistic dissection of the tripartite interaction [5, 6]. To this end, we have leveraged the power
of Drosophila genetics, combined with the molecular tractability of a parallel tissue culture sys-
tem, to probe previously uncharacterized aspects of Wolbachia-mediated resistance against the
prototype alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV). In this study, we show that presence of Wolbachia
in D. melanogaster results in reduced SINV infectivity, viral RNA replication and protein syn-
thesis. Furthermore, we have identified the DNA/RNA methyltransferase gene, Mt2 as a
potential host factor responsible for Wolbachia-mediated antiviral resistance. Based on these
results, we conclude that resistance towards SINV occurs at an early stage of virus replication
that further affects subsequent stages of the virus life cycle and show evidence supporting the
hypothesis that Wolbachia modulates the expression of a host methyltransferase gene (Mt2) to
target virus RNA synthesis.

 Results
Wolbachia reduces SINV infectivity
We investigated the effect of Wolbachia on SINV titer in wild-type flies infected or uninfected
with Wolbachia strain wMel, which we refer to as Wolb+ and Wolb- respectively from this
point onwards (Fig 1A). We did not observe death as a consequence of virus infection in Wolb
+ or Wolb- flies. This was expected due to the non-pathogenic nature of SINV infection in
Drosophila. Flies were collected 48 hours post-injection and virus titer was determined using
end-point dilution assay on BHK cells. We found that infectious virus titer was significantly
reduced in the Wolb+ individuals compared to their Wolb- counterparts.
We and others have previously shown that SINV infectivity, measured by the ratio of total
virus particles produced to infectious units, is influenced by the host cell environment in
which the virus is cultivated [12]. To determine whether the presence of Wolbachia inside the
host cell changes SINV infectivity, we used a cell culture based system comprised of Drosophila
melanogaster-derived JW18 cell line infected with Wolbachia strain wMel and an antibiotic-
treated Wolbachia free control cell line, which we refer to as JW18-dox. Cells were infected
with SINV at an MOI of 100 and samples of growth medium were taken at 48, 72 and 96 hours
post infection (Fig 1B). We performed conventional end point dilution assay to quantify infec-
tious particles released during infection and a previously described qRT-PCR based method to
quantify the total copies of virus genome present in the growth medium over the course of the
infection, which is equivalent to the total number of released virus particles [12].
We found that virus derived from Wolb+ cells had a significantly high particle: infectious
unit ratio relative to virus derived from Wolb- cells, indicating that on a particle basis this virus
was less infectious than that derived from the Wolb- cells (Fig 1B). We have previously shown
that SINV infectivity changes over the course of infection in both mammalian and mosquito
cells, and also varies in a host cell dependent manner, i.e. virus grown in one cell line may be
more infectious on a per particle basis than virus grown in a different cell line [12]. In the cur-
rent study we found that infectivity of particles produced deteriorated over time during infec-
tion in the Wolb+ cells.
These data show that not only does the presence of Wolbachia lead to a decrease in virus
produced, but also a decrease the infectivity of the SINV particles produced during infection.
SINV RNA synthesis is reduced in the presence of Wolbachia
During SINV infection, the incoming 49S genomic RNA functions as a mRNA to encode the
viral replication complex and later acts as a template for the synthesis of minus-strand RNA.
The minus strand RNA itself then serves as a template for the synthesis of nascent full length
49S genomic RNA and the transcription of smaller 26S sub genomic RNA, which encodes the
viral structural proteins. Synthesis of these different viral RNA species and their subsequent
translation is required for the formation of virus particles. Given that we found that the pres-
ence of Wolbachia resulted in fewer infectious virus progeny, we hypothesized that viral RNA
synthesis is inhibited when Wolbachia is present at the time of SINV infection.
To test this, wild-type Wolb+ and Wolb- flies were challenged with SINV. Infection was
allowed to progress for 48 hours before the flies were collected and snap-frozen. Following tis-
sue homogenization and RNA extraction, both relative, as well as absolute quantities of the
viral RNAs were determined by qRT-PCR (Fig 2). We found that presence of Wolbachia is
accompanied by 2.5-fold reductions in both viral genome (quantified using primers to nsP1
coding sequence) and subgenome (quantified using primers to E1 coding sequence) RNA

 levels, suggesting that viral RNA synthesis is inhibited in the presence of the endosymbiont
(Fig 2A).
We subsequently repeated this experiment in our D. melanogaster derived cell culture sys-
tem to further determine the absolute copies of plus strand and minus strand RNA produced
during virus infection. JW18 and JW18-dox cells were infected with SINV at an MOI of 100.
Infection was allowed to last for 96 hours before cells were collected for lysis and subsequent
RNA extraction and absolute quantities of viral RNAs were determined using qRT-PCR (Fig
2B). In line with our previous observation in flies, we found an average 10-fold reduction in
total copies of virus plus and minus strand RNA.
Decrease in SINV protein expression in the presence of Wolbachia is a
consequence of reduced virus RNA synthesis
Given our observed reduction in virus titer and RNA levels, we expected a concomitant reduc-
tion in virus protein synthesis. During infection, SINV non-structural proteins are translated
as a polyprotein from the first open reading frame present in the 49S genomic RNA. Sometime
later during infection, the 26S subgenomic RNA is translated as a polyprotein that subse-
quently gives rise to the virus structural proteins [13]. Therefore, expression of a luciferase

axis represent the dilutions that resulted in at least 50 percent cell death (TCID50). Data are mean values for three

hours post infection. Samples were subsequently assayed for infectious virus using end-point-dilution assay and for
particle numbers by qRT-PCR quantification of viral genome copies present in the media. Higher total particle: TCID50

 reporter present within any non-structural or structural protein can be used as a proxy for the
net translational activity from the genomic and subgenomic RNAs respectively. To this end,
we used a luciferase based viral translation assay to quantitatively determine translation of
SINV non-structural and structural proteins. We used SIN- nsP3-nLuc virus, in which nanolu-
ciferase (nLuc) has been translationally fused to the hypervariable domain of SINV nsP3 pro-
tein, and SIN-cap-nLuc virus, which has nLuc translationally fused to the C-terminus of SINV
capsid protein. Wild-type Wolb+ and Wolb- flies were infected independently with each of the
aforementioned viruses. Flies were collected 48hr post-infection and snap frozen and nLuc
activity was measured post-homogenization (Fig 3A).
Our results indicated an average 10-fold reduction in nLuc activity in tissue derived from
Wolb+ individuals challenged with SIN-nsP3-nLuc virus, suggesting inhibition of SINV non-
structural protein synthesis (Fig 3A). In contrast, quantification of nLuc activity in tissues
derived from individuals challenged with SIN-cap-nLuc virus revealed a greater (~50-fold)
Wolbachia–mediated reduction in nLuc activity (Fig 3A). These data indicate that Wolbachia
causes a reduction in the synthesis of SINV non-structural and structural proteins and that
expression of viral proteins synthesized off the subgenome are affected to a greater extent.
However, it was not clear whether this was a consequence of decreased translational efficiency
or simply a consequence of reduced quantities viral RNA available for translation (Fig 2).
To determine the cause of reduced viral protein synthesis, we extracted total RNA from the
tissue homogenates of individuals infected with SIN-nsP3-nLuc or SIN-cap-nLuc viruses and

 determined absolute quantities of viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs using qRT-PCR as
before. Following the calculation of viral protein, expressed in terms of luciferase activity
(RLU), to viral RNA (copies/ug), we failed to find any significant difference in the protein-to-
RNA ratios between Wolbachia–infected and—uninfected individuals, suggesting that viral
protein translation is reduced due to scarcity of viral transcripts and that the smaller number
of viral transcripts produced in the presence of the bacterium can be translated with regular
efficiency (Fig 3B). Taken together, our data strongly indicates that Wolbachia-mediated inhi-
bition of SINV infection occurs at an early stage of viral RNA replication that subsequently
results in reduced viral protein synthesis and virus titer, which is consistent with previous
reports regarding SFV infection in JW18 cells [14].
Host Mt-2 is required for efficient Wolbachia-mediated inhibition of virus
replication
Based on evidence from other systems, we investigated whether the antiviral resistance medi-
ated by Wolbachia could be explained by modulation of host immune gene expression by the
bacterium [15–19]. We tested this hypothesis by profiling the transcriptional activity of several
candidate genes spanning different pathways that have been previously implicated as being a
part of the host antiviral defense. The initial examination of the effect of Wolbachia on host
gene expression was performed in the absence of a viral infection. We reasoned that it is

genomic and subgenomic RNA species was performed using qRT-PCR as described before. Values represented the
mean of three independent biological replicates. P values were calculated using Mann-Whitney U test (non-structural
proteins: p = 0.20, structural proteins: p > 0.99). All error bars represent standard error of mean (SEM).

 important to consider the cellular environment that the virus is initially exposed to upon entry
into the cell, not necessarily one that it encounters later during infection. In addition to canon-
ical innate immune pathway components we examined the expression of Mt2, a gene encoding
a nucleic acid methyl transferase previously shown to be required for DCV resistance in Dro-
sophila [20]. Host gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR in Drosophila in the absence
or presence of Wolbachia.
We observed a general increase in expression of genes associated with canonical innate
immune pathways such as Imd and Toll in the presence of Wolbachia (S1 Fig). Interestingly,
we also observed a significant increase in the expression of the host methyl-transferase gene
Mt2, with an average of 7-8-fold increase in transcript levels in the presence of Wolbachia (S1
Fig, Fig 4A). While a number of previous studies have discounted the role of canonical
immune pathways in Wolbachia-induced pathogen blocking, the role of Mt2 in this process is
less clear. Interestingly, this elevated expression of Mt2 in Wolb+ flies decreased following
SINV infection (Fig 4A).
To investigate the role of Mt2 in Wolbachia–mediated inhibition of SINV infection, we
looked at the effect of Wolbachia on virus infection in a previously characterized, homozygous
loss-of-function mutant of Mt2 (Mt2 -/-) [21]. SINV infection was established as before in
Wolbachia infected and uninfected flies that were either wild-type or Mt2 -/- and the infection
progressed for 48 hours before samples were collected, snap-frozen and virus titer was deter-
mined using end-point dilution assay on BHK cells (Fig 4B). SINV titer was, on average,
10-fold higher in Wolb+ Mt2 -/- mutants compared to Wolb+ wild-type flies. Previous studies
have established a direct correlation between Wolbachia density and the degree of antiviral
resistance [22–24]. In light of this we examined whether the loss of function in the Mt2 gene in
the Mt2 -/- mutants is accompanied by a reduction in Wolbachia titer, which could potentially
explain the observed loss in virus inhibition. Quantification of DNA collected from samples
using qPCR showed no reduction in Wolbachia titer in the Mt2 -/- mutants compared to the
wild-type, indicating that Wolbachia titer is not responsible for the observed reduction in virus
inhibition (S2 Fig).
Similar results were obtained following shRNA-targeted knockdown of Mt2 expression in
two genetically distinct Wolbachia–infected fly lines, with each of the two shRNAs targeting a
different area of the Mt2 gene (Fig 5A and 5B, S3 Fig). Interestingly, the degree to which virus
resistance was lost seemed to correlate roughly with the extent to which Mt2 expression was
reduced (Fig 5A–5C, S3 Fig).
Virus titer from Wolbachia uninfected wild-type flies were still found to be higher com-
pared to the Wolbachia infected Mt2 -/- mutants (Fig 4B) although the data failed to meet
the threshold for statistical significance. Additionally, comparison of virus titer from Mt2-/-
flies with and without Wolbachia indicated that pathogen blocking is mediated by factors in
addition to Mt2. However, once again the difference observed failed to reach statistical
significance.
Given the fact that our initial characterization of Wolbachia–mediated SINV resistance
showed viral inhibition occurred at an early stage of RNA synthesis and consequently resulted
in reduced viral protein levels, we next sought to determine the effect of Mt2 at these particular
stages of virus replication. Quantification of SINV transcripts was performed using qRT-PCR
as described above for absolute viral genome quantification (Fig 4C). Compared to Wolba-
chia–infected wild-type individuals, loss of Mt2 resulted in an average of 2-3-fold increase in
viral transcript levels. In contrast, we did not see any significant difference in the transcript lev-
els between Wolbachia infected Mt2 -/- mutants compared to uninfected wild-type and Mt2 -/-
mutants, showing that SINV RNA synthesis can be almost fully restored following the loss of
Mt2 function in the presence of Wolbachia.

 While the data presented above indicated that inhibition at the stage of SINV RNA synthe-
sis previously observed in the presence of Wolbachia is significantly reduced in Mt2 -/- mutant,
it did not answer whether or not viral protein levels were restored in these mutants. We uti-
lized our previously described SIN-cap-nLuc virus and luciferase based viral translation assay
to quantify levels of SINV structural proteins in wild-type and Mt2 -/- mutants either in the
presence or absence of Wolbachia. We found significantly higher expression of SINV struc-
tural proteins in the Mt2 -/- background (Wolb+ and Wolb-), relative to that observed in their
wild-type counterparts (Fig 4D). This result implies that the antiviral effect of Mt2 targets a
stage of viral RNA synthesis, with the loss of Mt2 restoring the RNA and consequent protein
levels to wild-type Wolb- levels.
We next examined whether the antiviral effect of Mt2 against SINV could be independent
of Wolbachia, as it has been reported before to be antiviral in the context of native DCV infec-
tion in D. melanogaster [20]. To test whether overexpression of the Mt2 gene by itself resulted
in SINV resistance, we used Gal4-UAS expression system to overexpress Mt2 in Wolbachia
uninfected flies. While we were only able to achieve modest levels of overexpression, following
infection with SINV, Mt2 overexpressing individuals were found to accumulate virus at an
average of 2-fold lower titer than their wild-type sibling controls (S4A Fig). Levels of viral
RNA in Mt2 overexpressing flies were, on average, 2.5 fold lower compared to wild-type sib-
ling controls (S4B Fig).
Loss of Mt2 leads to increased SINV particle infectivity in the absence of
Wolbachia
To further investigate the antiviral role of Mt2 against SINV, we asked whether Mt2 is respon-
sible for our initial observation regarding the reduction of virus particle infectivity in the pres-
ence of Wolbachia. To this end, we utilized our Wolbachia uninfected JW18-dox cell culture
model to knock down expression of Mt2 using targeted dsRNA against the methyltransferase
gene. Cells were transfected with either Mt2-specific, or non-targeting dsRNA. SINV infection
was established 48-hours post-transfection at an MOI of 100 and infection was allowed to last
for 96 hours before cells and media were harvested separately.
Following RNA extraction from harvested cells, qRT-PCR based quantification of Mt2 gene
expression revealed an average 50% knockdown relative to non-targeting controls (Fig 6A).
Probing the effect of Mt2 knockdown on SINV RNA synthesis revealed viral RNA levels to be
around 14-fold higher in cells transfected with Mt2 dsRNA (Fig 6B), further confirming the
results obtained in our animal model (Fig 4C).
Effect of Mt2 knockdown on SINV particle infectivity in JW18-dox cells was performed as
described previously by determining the ratio of total particles to the total number of infec-
tious units. Virus titer was calculated using standard end-point dilution assay on BHK-21 cells.
Relative fold change in virus titer from cells transfected with Mt2 dsRNA was found to be on
average, 200-fold higher compared to cells treated with non-specific dsRNA (Fig 6C).
48 hours before whole fly tissues were harvested and assayed for the presence of infectious virus using end-point-dilution assay in BHK-21
cells. Values represent the mean of three independent biological replicates. P values were calculated using Mann-Whitney U tests between

 Consequently, virus particle infectivity was found to increase for virus derived from cells in
which Mt2 was knocked-down as evidenced by the 70 percent reduction in the particle-to-
TCID50 ratio, indicating that Mt2 plays a role in regulating virus particle infectivity (Fig 6D).
Taken together, these results show Mt2 to possess antiviral activity against SINV.
Discussion
Arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) represent significant and imminent threats to public
health across the globe due to the lack of commercially available vaccines or antiviral therapeu-
tics. Several of the classic arboviral diseases are characterized by their long periods of absence,
followed by sudden cases of re-emergence which may occur at unpredictable intervals, often
decades apart [25, 26]. Therefore, until there are measures to inhibit viral replication and
improve disease outcome, vector transmission control remains as the most effective strategy
for preventing the spread of arboviral and other vector-borne pathogens. However, the
increasing burden of diseases associated with dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses reflect the
ineffectiveness of traditional vector control strategies, thereby promoting the need towards
developing unconventional, yet viable alternatives [27]. One promising approach involves har-
nessing the pathogen blocking properties exhibited by the maternally inherited endosymbiont
Wolbachia pipientis.
At this time the causal mechanism behind Wolbachia induced RNA virus resistance in
insects is poorly understood. Despite being observed in both native and transiently established
Wolbachia infections [5, 6, 9–11, 14, 20, 22, 28–33], a considerable amount of phenotypic vari-
ability exists between different Wolbachia strains, hosts and viruses [22, 28–33]. In some cases,
differences in titers of endogenous versus transinfected Wolbachia strains have been cited as a
potential determining factor, while others have suggested a mechanistic divide between differ-
ent host systems [8, 22]. However, it is important to note that despite these differences, antivi-
ral resistance induced by Wolbachia is specific to RNA viruses, and this fact could help to
narrow the underlying mechanism of virus inhibition. The data presented above demonstrate
Wolbachia’s capacity to inhibit SINV replication in an arthropod host. We observed a signifi-
cant decrease in the infectivity of SINV particles produced from Wolbachia infected cells. That
is, while a significant number of virus particles were being produced in the presence of Wolba-
chia they were less infectious on a per particle basis than those produced in the absence of Wol-
bachia. This is important, as these results may help explain recent observations regarding the
lack of detectable infectious virus particles present in salivary glands of wMel-infected A.
aegypti mosquitoes harboring other RNA viruses [31–33]. Finally, we also showed that this
block happens early during infection at the level of viral RNA replication and that differential
expression of the host methyltransferase gene, Mt2, plays a significant role in blocking SINV
infection.
The physiology of the host cell harboring a virus influences the titer of the resulting virus
progeny. Several factors, such as the stage of infection, for example, influence virus titer,
whereby titer improves temporally as virus accumulates with the progress of infection. On the

 other hand, virus titer is also dependent on the physiological attributes of the cell from which
the virus originates [12]. Given that the presence of Wolbachia induces resistance against dif-
ferent RNA viruses, it would be logical to think that the intracellular endosymbiont alters cel-
lular physiology, creating an antiviral state that consequently influences the titer of the
progeny virus produced. If this is indeed the case, where the induced antiviral effect is cell
autonomous, then virus resistance would unconditionally require the presence of Wolbachia
inside the cell. Furthermore, varying densities of Wolbachia in different tissues would then
affect the degree of antiviral effect from cell to cell [34]. Indeed, Wolbachia is known to influ-
ence host gene expression [35, 36] and in certain cases, altered host gene expression negatively
influences the development of malarial parasites in Wolbachia–infected vector species such as
A. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae [15, 16]. In further support of an altered cellular environ-
ment upon Wolbachia infection, the bacterium was found to inhibit translation of SFV in
JW18 cells as early as 7hpi with an absence of active transcriptional change in Wolbachia genes
in response to virus infection [14]. This led to the conclusion that Wolbachia’s antiviral mecha-
nism is either fast acting or is already present upon virus infection [14]. These results, and
varying degrees of evidence, support the idea that Wolbachia might prime the host immune
system, including factors such as the induction of ROS and alterations of host miRNA profiles,
to induce antiviral resistance [17, 37 – 39]. However, several studies have discounted the role
of canonical Drosophila innate immune components like RNAi as well as pathways such as
Toll and Imd [19, 39]. In contrast, little attention has been given towards investigating the role
of non-canonical host genes that may be involved in resistance against viruses. We identified
the DNA/RNA methyltransferase Mt2 as a host factor that restricted SINV infection in Dro-
sophila melanogaster and established a link between its antiviral function and Wolbachia–
mediated host resistance against SINV.
D. melanogaster Mt2 gene encodes for a 40 kDa Dnmt2 protein which belongs to the most
widely conserved Dnmt protein family and is the denoted as the lone cytosine methyltransfer-
ase present in many arthropods, including flies and mosquitoes [40, 41]. Its function is uncon-
ventional, given that Dnmt2 has been shown to methylate both DNA and tRNAAsp at the
cytosine-5 position (m5C). Dnmt2-directed cytosine methylation of genomic DNA in D. mela-
nogaster is limited to specific loci on selected retrotransposons [42–44]. However, its robust
RNA (tRNA) methyltransferase activity has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro, as
evidenced by C38 methylation of tRNAAsp and additional tRNAs [21, 45]. This is significant
because Dnmt2 is required for DCV resistance in Drosophila and RNA immunoprecipitation
experiments demonstrated interaction of Dnmt2 with DCV RNA during infection [20]. Here,
we extend the antiviral role of Dnmt2 in SINV inhibition, both in the presence and absence of
Wolbachia. Our results show that Wolbachia infection leads to an increase in Mt2 expression
prior to virus infection, thus the virus is being introduced to a system in which Mt2 expression
is high. Interestingly SINV infection led to a reduction of Wolbachia-induced Mt2 expression.
This is important to note as a prior study found no effect of Wolbachia on Mt2 expression, but
in that study the analysis of expression levels was performed after virus infection [22]. Addi-
tionally, we show that loss of Mt2 results in a significant increase in SINV transcript levels as
mean of five independent biological replicates. P values were calculated using Mann-Whitney U tests (TCID50:
p < 0.0001). (D) Infectivity of virus particles produced was determined as described earlier, whereby total number of
virus particles were quantified using qRT-PCR. As before, higher total particle: TCID50 numbers indicate poorer virus
particle infectivity and relative reduction in particle: TCID50 ratio represents an overall increase in infectivity. Values
represent the mean of five independent biological replicates. P values were calculated using Mann-Whitney U tests
(particle: TCID50: p < 0.0001). All reported values are relative to non-targeting, control dsRNA treatments set at 1. All
error bars represent standard error of mean (SEM).

 well as a concomitant increase in the synthesis of virus structural proteins and virus titer. We
hypothesize that Mt2 may function to inhibit viral RNA synthesis, which is in line with its pre-
viously described RNA binding properties.
Unlike traditional DNA methyltransferases, whose subcellular localizations are predomi-
nantly in the nucleus, evidence has been provided that Dnmt2 is distributed in the nucleus and
the cytoplasm where SINV replication takes place. Indeed, fractionation studies of protein
extracts from Drosophila embryos and localization of fluorescently tagged Dnmt2 in DCV
infected fly tissues have confirmed the presence of Dnmt2 in the cytoplasm [44, 20]. The fact
that cytoplasmic relocalization of Dnmt2 in response to cellular stress has been observed in
other systems is significant, since elevated oxidative stress in the presence of Wolbachia is cor-
related with antiviral resistance in both flies and mosquitoes [37, 38, 46, 47]. In contrast to the
data presented here Zhang et al. found that mosquito (A. aegypti) Dnmt2 promoted dengue
virus replication [38]. It is not clear how to reconcile these contrasting observations, however
it is not surprising that viruses from different viral families are affected differently by a host
factor that is elevated in response to Wolbachia. Although further research is required to deter-
mine the exact nature of interaction between SINV RNA and Dnmt2, previous work involving
DCV revealed significantly higher virus induced mortality in flies carrying a catalytically inac-
tive mutant of Dnmt2, which suggests that enzymatic activity of Dnmt2 is required for its
function as an antiviral factor [20]. Future work will focus on determining the RNA methyla-
tion status of the SINV genome in the presence or absence of Wolbachia and the relative
importance of Dnmt2’s RNA methyltransferase activity in SINV inhibition.
Although we discovered a link between Mt2 and Wolbachia’s pathogen blocking, the major-
ity of the mechanistic details regarding this phenomenon remain unknown, and certainly
other Wolbachia induced factors are likely to be involved. At this time, it is unknown whether
Dnmt2 alters the methylation of SINV RNA. Given what is known about the functional impli-
cations of mRNA modifications in eukaryotic organisms, it is possible that the viral RNA acts
as a target for cellular methyltransferases that subsequently influences the function of that
RNA either positively negatively. Indeed, evidence of eukaryotic host methylation machinery
acting as an either proviral or antiviral factor has been reported in the field [48–53]. Recent
viral RNA methylation studies have found conserved, m6A modified regions spanning the
RNA genomes of multiple members of Flaviviridae family, including Hepatitis C Virus
(HCV), Zika Virus (ZIKV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) and West Nile
Virus (WNV) [51, 52].
In the context of Wolbachia infection in insects, various degrees of evidence support the
role of the endosymbiont in modulating the cytosine methylation profile of the host. In D. mel-
anogaster, presence of native Wolbachia wMel is correlated with increased methylation across
all cytosine residues in male testes [54]. In addition, transcriptome-wide methylation profiling
of virulent wMelPop infected A. aegypti mosquitoes reveal mostly random, yet widespread
changes in the host cytosine methylation profile compared to Wolbachia uninfected individu-
als [55]. It is important to note that similar to D. melanogaster, mosquitoes such as A. aegypti
and A. gambiae possess a single Dnmt2 like cytosine methyltransferase [56, 57]. Therefore,
given the selective nature of Wolbachia induced resistance towards viruses possessing RNA
genomes, as well as growing evidence in the field that viral genome methylation regulates
RNA virus infection, our data support the idea of Wolbachia induced modification of SINV
RNA.
Whether or not Wolbachia-induced Mt2 expression changes the methylation state of the
viral RNA it is apparent that it has a biological effect on virus replication. Our data indicate
this effect is exerted at an early time in infection and results in reduced levels of RNA synthesis.
Future work fill focus on understanding how Dmnt2 interaction with viral RNA influences

 RNA function. The observation that infectious unit production is more severely inhibited than
particle production Wolbachia infected hosts indicates that the genomes in the particles are
less capable of initiating infection. It is known that methylation of RNA can change the stabil-
ity of that RNA [48] which, if true for SINV RNA, could result in decreased viral RNA synthe-
sis. Alternatively, Wolbachia-mediated Dmnt2 activity may lead to downstream alterations in
the use of the genome as a template for translation and minus-strand RNA synthesis.
Conclusions
Continued use of Wolbachia as an emerging vector control agent requires better understand-
ing of the molecular mechanism underlying its antiviral resistance in the context of a tractable
arthropod system. We provide evidence that the presence of Wolbachia reduces SINV particle
infectivity and results in reduced virus titer. Furthermore, our data indicate a reduction in
viral RNA synthesis, accompanied by decreased viral protein synthesis. Further characteriza-
tion of early infection events is required to determine the exact nature of Wolbachia–mediated
inhibition of SINV genome replication. Importantly, our data clearly demonstrate antiviral
activity of the host RNA methyltransferase gene Mt2 in the presence and absence of Wolba-
chia. Given the data provided in this study, it is likely that the effect of Mt2 lies at the stage of
viral RNA synthesis/stability. Future work will therefore focus on characterizing the nature of
interaction between Mt2 and SINV RNA. The fact that both Wolbachia mediated antiviral
resistance and the antiviral effect of Mt2 extends to members of different single stranded RNA
virus families is significant, suggesting that existence of a common mechanism [5, 6, 9–11, 14,
20, 22].
Materials and methods
Drosophila husbandry, genetic crosses and virus injections
Drosophila fly stock 6326 (of a W1118 genetic background), carrying Wolbachia was obtained
from the Bloomington Stock Center (BDSC), and used as the infected wild-type background.
A corresponding Wolbachia–uninfected line was created through tetracycline treatment
(approx. 20 ug/mL fed in the fly media for 3 generations). Wolbachia infection status was sub-
sequently confirmed through quantitative PCR using published primer sets (S1 Table)[58].
The flies were repopulated with a wild-type microbiota post tetracycline treatment through
culture in bottles previously occupied by untreated male flies of the same background (stock
6326). UAS-Mt2 and Mt2 loss of function flies (provided by S. Bordenstein) [54] were used to
examine the role of the Drosophila DNA methyltransferase gene on the pathogen blocking
phenotype. The Mt2 loss of function mutation is in a W1118 background as described by
LePage et al. [54]. Wolbachia-infected TRiP mutant stocks 38224 (y1 sc� v1; P {TRiP.
HMS01667} attP40) and 42906 (y1 sc� v1; P {TRiP.HMS02599} attP40) were used for shRNA-
targeted knock-down of Mt2 gene expression by driving Mt2 shRNA expression using previ-
ously described Act5C-Gal4 driver males (provided by Brian Calvi) y1 w�; P{Act5C-GAL4}
25FO1/CyO, y+ (Fig 5) or y1 w�; P{w[Act5C-GAL4}17bFO1/TM6B, Tb1 (S3 Fig). For overex-
pression of Mt2, crosses were performed between UAS-Mt2 males and virgin Act5C-Gal4
driver females. Among the resulting progeny, straight-winged flies were considered to be over-
expressing while siblings exhibiting Cyo phenotype were used as the wild-type control. All fly
stocks were and maintained on standard cornmeal-agar medium supplemented with P/S at
25˚C on a 24-hour light/dark cycle. In order to establish a systemic virus infection in vivo, flies
were anesthetized with CO2 and injected in the thorax with 50nL of approximately 1010 PFU/
mL of pelleted virus or control PBS using a glass capillary needle. Flies were collected two days
post-infection, snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80˚C for downstream processing.

 In all stocks harboring Wolbachia infection, the Wolbachia strain was wMel2, confirmed by
genotyping as shown in S5 Fig using primers described in Riegler et.al. 2005 [59] (S1 Table).
Cell culture and infection of cells with SINV
Wolbachia-infected Drosophila melanogaster JW18 cells and corresponding doxycycline-
treated Wolbachia-uninfected JW18_dox cells (a generous gift from W. Sullivan) were main-
tained at 24˚C in Shields and Sang media (Sigma), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco). BHK-21 cells (American
Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37˚C under 5% CO2 in MEM (CellGro) supplemented
with 1% L-Gln, 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco), 1% non-essential amino acids and 10%
heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). JW18 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density
of approximately 2.26x106 cells/well 24h prior to infection. Infection was carried out using
virus derived from BHK-21 cells, titered using a standard plaque assay. Virus was diluted in
Shields and Sang media (Sigma) and the infection was established at an MOI = 100. For doxy-
cycline cleared JW18-dox cells, around 50–55% infection was observed at 96 hpi. Mock infec-
tions were carried out by treating the cells equivalently, without the addition of virus.
Viral translation assays
Quantification of viral genome and subgenome translation was performed by introducing
SINV luciferase reporter viruses nsP3-nLuc and cap-nLuc, respectively into 2-day old virgin
female flies as described. The samples were homogenized in 1X Cell Culture Lysis Reagent
(Promega) after they were collected 2-days post infection and clarified via centrifugation at
16,000 × g for 2 min. The samples were then mixed with luciferase reagent (Promega), and
luminescence was recorded using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTech instruments). In
all cases, the luciferase readings were normalized to the levels of SINV genomic and sub-geno-
mic RNA present in the assayed samples, determined by using qRT-PCR methods with ΔΔCT
calculation of transcript levels.
Wolbachia density
Wolbachia density from fly homogenates and tissue culture cells were determined via qPCR
on whole DNA using an Applied Biosystems StepOne Real-time PCR system (S1 Table) and
SYBRGreen Chemistry (Applied Biosystems), previously described in [58]. Wolbachia density
(and infection status) in JW18 cells was determined using DAPI staining, where Wolbachia
were visualized in the form of cytoplasmic foci within the cells.
Mt2 knockdown in JW18-dox cells
Knockdown of Mt2 expression was achieved in doxycycline treated JW18 cells using target
dsRNA against the Mt2 gene. Mt2 dsRNA was synthesized from corresponding dsDNA gener-
ated using self-annealing primer sets. First, custom oligonucleotide was designed with a 5’
T7-Polymerase binding site (GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAG) followed by a 3’ target
sequence specific to the Mt2 coding region. Similarly, another oligonucleotide was designed
with a similar 5’ T7 polymerase binding site followed by a 3’ end complementary to the 3’ end
of the previous oligo (S1 Table). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using 100uM of
primers and Q5 High-fidelity Master Mix [NEB] to produce dsDNA. dsRNA was synthesized
via in-vitro transcription of this dsDNA, using T7-RNA Polymerase in the presence of the
5’cap analog 7’G5’ppp5’G [New England Biolabs], followed by transfection of 500 ng dsRNA

 into JW18-dox cells using Lipofectamine LTX [Thermo Fisher Scientific]. Maximum knock-
down was achieved at 48 hours post transfection.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Whole flies were homogenized in TRIzol reagent, followed by RNA extraction. cDNA was syn-
thesized using MMulV Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolab) with random hexamer
primers (Integrated DNA Technologies). Negative (no RT) controls were performed for each
target. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed using Brilliant III SYBR green QPCR
master mix (Agilent) with gene-specific primers according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
with the Applied Bioscience StepOnePlus qRT-PCR machine (Life Technologies). The expres-
sion levels were normalized to the endogenous 18S rRNA expression using the delta-delta
comparative threshold method (ΔΔCT). Fold changes were determined using the comparative
threshold cycle (CT) method (S1 Table).
Statistical analyses
P-values were calculated as described in the individual Fig legends. The average fold change
(FC) in each experiment was calculated using the variable bootstrapping method, measuring
the fold change between each potential pair of flies to determine the variability of the mean
[12]. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using one sample t-test of log2FC values to
determine the significance of distribution of the mean relative to the null using IBM SPSS Sta-
tistics Software 24 [60].

ously. Infection was allowed to last for 48 hours before RNA was extracted from whole fly tis-
