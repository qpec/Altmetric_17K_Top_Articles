Abstract  
 
Introduction 
Nutrition screening is an initial procedure in which the risk of malnutrition is identified. The 
aims of this review were to identify malnutrition risk from nutrition screening studies that 
have used validated nutrition screening tools in community living older adults; and to identify 
types of nutrition interventions, pathways of care and patient outcomes following screening. 
Methods 
A systematic literature search was performed for the period from January 1994 until 
December 2013 using SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, PubMed and COCHRANE 
databases as well as a manual search. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined for the 
literature searches and the methodology followed the PRISMA guidelines.  
Results 
Fifty-four articles were eligible to be included in the review and malnutrition risk varied from 
0 % to 83%. This large range was influenced by the different tools used and heterogeneity of 
study samples. Most of the studies were cross sectional and without a subsequent nutrition 
intervention component. Types of nutrition intervention that were identified included  
dietetics care,  nutrition education, and referral to Meals on Wheels services and community 
services. These interventions helped to improve the’ nutritional status of older adults. 
Conclusions 
Timely nutrition screening of older adults living in the community, if followed up with 
appropriate intervention and monitoring improves the nutritional status of older adults. This 
indicates that nutrition intervention should be considered a priority following nutrition 
screening for malnourished and at risk older adults. Further evaluation of outcomes of 
nutrition screening and associated interventions, using structured pathways of care, is 
warranted.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Older adults are  susceptible to malnutrition due to physiological changes, chronic diseases, 
side effects of medication (Volkert, 2002), loss of appetite (Hickson, 2006), living alone 
(Hsieh et al., 2010), poor cognition and functional decline (Chen et al., 2009; Johansson et 
al., 2009), the biological process of ageing and socioeconomic factors (Meydani, 2001).   
Malnutrition has been  defined as “Any disorder of nutrition status including disorders 
resulting from a deficiency of nutrient intake, impaired nutrient metabolism, or  over 
nutrition” (Teitelbaum et al., 2005).  In this review, malnutrition is referred to as under 
nutrition.  
 
Malnutrition is a silent threat which develops in community settings (Russell and Elia, 2010). 
Globally the  prevalence of malnutrition, and at risk of malnutrition amongst older adults is 
38% (Kaiser et al., 2010).   In the community, the prevalence of malnutrition in older adults 
aged 75-80 years is two-fold higher than the 65-74 age group (Ljungqvist et al., 2010).  It is 
well-documented that malnourished older adults have higher mortality rates (Charlton et al., 
2012), reduced quality of life (Neumann et al., 2005), reduced ability to perform activities of 
daily living (Inoue and Kato, 2007; Izawa et al., 2014), risk of additional illness (BAPEN 
Malnutrition Advisory Group, 2003a) and they experience longer recovery times than well-
nourished peers (BAPEN Malnutrition Advisory Group, 2003a).  
Timely malnutrition identification and management is required as malnutrition is not only a 
threat to patients’ health (Brotherton et al., 2011), but also to healthcare. Healthcare 
commissions around the world have highlighted the burden of malnutrition in  health and 
social care costs and services; and hence timely malnutrition identification is recommended 
(Elia et al., 2010).  Costs related to malnutrition in  Europe are beyond the cost of obesity 
with approximately 170 billion Euros spent annually for malnutrition, but little attention is 
 4 
 
given to combat this condition (Medical Nutrition Institute, 2012). In the UK, the cost of 
disease-related malnutrition exceeded £7.3 billion in 2003 (Elia, 2009), and was even higher 
in 2007 with a cost of £13 billion (Elia and Russell, 2009).  
 
Nutrition intervention is particularly important for malnutrition management and  defined as 
‘a purposefully planned action(s) designed with the intent of changing a nutrition-related 
behaviour, risk factor, environmental condition, or aspect of health status’ (American Dietetic 
Association, 2008). Nutrition intervention can be implemented if malnutrition identification 
is being conducted. Identification of malnutrition can be performed through nutrition 
screening which is warranted across all settings and widely emphasised by various expert 
organisations worldwide (BAPEN Malnutrition Advisory Group, 2003a; Kondrup et al., 
2003; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2006; Tappenden et al., 2013; 
Volkert et al., 2006). Nutrition screening has been recognised as an initial step in nutritional 
care (Mueller et al., 2011).   Nutrition screening can be summarised as a simple and quick 
process to identify malnourished or at risk individuals who require nutrition assessment by a 
dietitian and prioritised nutrition intervention (American Dietetic Association, 1994; BAPEN 
Malnutrition Advisory Group, 2003a; Kondrup et al., 2003; Teitelbaum et al., 2005; 
Watterson et al., 2009).   
 
Green and Watson (2006) identified 21 screening and assessment tools specifically designed 
for older adults, each with different cut-off points and characteristics. Validity and reliability 
of the tools are essential criteria (Green and Watson, 2005). However, nutrition screening is 
poorly performed in community settings and malnutrition remains under recognised 
(Watterson et al., 2009). A compromised nutritional state increases frequency of  visits to 
general practitioners (GPs) (BAPEN Malnutrition Advisory Group, 2003a); which ultimately 
 5 
 
places a burden on primary health care services. This high risk group is also associated with 
greater hospital admissions, longer hospital stay and higher risk of falling compared to their 
well-nourished counterparts (Visvanathan et al., 2003). During hospitalization, their 
nutritional status deteriorates with evidence of greater weight loss (McWhirter and 
Pennington, 1994). There is a body of  evidence that older patients are often discharged from 
hospital in a compromised nutritional state which will likely contribute to further 
deterioration when they return to the community (Charlton, 2010). 
 
Malnutrition experts in the UK have highlighted the need for further appropriate nutritional 
care following a screening programme  and  stated that malnutrition identification does not 
reflect in outcomes improvement unless accompanied by effective care pathways to address 
the identified problem (Elia et al., 2005). Timely malnutrition identification and nutrition 
intervention in older adults whilst they are living in community settings should be a primary 
goal for healthcare professionals (Rist et al., 2012).  
 
This review aimed to (1) identify malnutrition risk that has been identified from nutrition 
screening studies that used validated nutrition screening tools in community living older 
adults; and (2) identify types of nutrition interventions, pathways of care and patient 
outcomes following screening. 
 
2 METHODS 
Literature searches were performed electronically using SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus with Full 
Text, PubMed and COCHRANE databases. Searches included peer reviewed journal articles 
for the 20 year period from January 1994 until December 2013. The search was limited to 
 6 
 
articles in English language and full text articles. Search terms used in the databases are 
shown in Figure 1:  
Figure 1 Search algorithm used in the review 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inclusion criteria 
Studies using validated nutrition screening tools for community living older adults, with a 
mean age of 65 years and above, who were community living and may have had the 
screening conducted within an outpatient clinic, at home, in a general practice or another 
primary care setting. 
 
Exclusion criteria 
Exclusion criteria included studies of  older adults  in institutions, nursing home, residential 
aged care/ care homes, retirement villages and hospital; those with mental illness or 
impairment or specific diseases or clinical states; comparative studies of nutrition screening 
tools; studies that assessed validity,  inter-rater reliability, evaluation and development of 
instruments; nutrient or biomarker studies; multiple settings; review articles; cost analyses 
studies; perception and practices related to screening  tools. 
 
Figure 2 illustrates the number of journal articles retrieved from the databases, included and 
excluded in the review, as well as the reasons for any exclusions. Articles were included for 
review based on assigned inclusion and exclusion criteria and followed the  PRISMA 
(“nutrition* risk" OR "malnutrition" OR "undernutrition" OR "nutrition* status”) AND (“elder*" 
OR "older adult*" OR "older people" OR "senior*" OR "geriatric*" OR "veteran" OR "ageing" 
OR "aging") AND ("nutrition* screening" OR "nutrition* risk screen*" OR screen* ) AND 
("community" OR "home" OR "general practice*" OR "clinic*" OR "primary care" ) NOT 
("nursing home*" OR hospital )  
 7 
 
guidelines  (Moher et al., 2009). The articles were ranked according to the National Health 
and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) levels of evidence: Ι – IV (NHMRC, 2012). Level 
Ι is the highest ranking of evidence, whilst level IV is the lowest.  Five articles were 
identified through manual searching.

Nutrition screening tools used in the studies  
The identification of malnutrition requires the use of a validated and easily administered 
nutrition screening tool (Vellas et al., 2006). Instruments that were used in the included 
studies were the Australian Nutritional Screening Initiative (ANSI), Elderly Nutrition 
Screening (ENS®),  Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA®-SF), Malnutrition 
Screening Tool (MST), Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), Nutrition Screening 
Initiative (NSI) (including  the DETERMINE Checklist, Level I and II Screen), Nutritional 
Risk Index (NRI),  Nutritional Form For the Elderly (NUFFE), Seniors in the Community: 
Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition I (SCREEN©) and Seniors in the Community: Risk 
Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition II (SCREEN©II). Characteristics of each of the nutrition 
screening tools are described in Table 1.

The American Nutrition Screening Initiative (NSI) DETERMINE checklist was developed in 
the United States in the 1990s and has been  widely used to identify nutrition risks in older 
adults (White et al., 1992). The DETERMINE was initially used as a screening and 
educational tool, thus its sensitivity as a nutritional screening tool has been argued. 
SCREEN© was adapted in Canada from the DETERMINE (Keller et al., 2007)  and targeted 
for use in adults aged 50 years and above (Keller et al., 2000). SCREEN© was further 
developed into SCREEN©II (Keller et al., 2005). The Australian Nutrition Screening 
Initiative (ANSI) checklist was another community based tool formulated for older adults 
aged 65 years and older that was based on the DETERMINE and was widely  promoted for 
use by Australian healthcare practitioners  in the 1990s (Lipski, 1996).  
 
In Europe, the NUFFE originated from Sweden for older adults (Söderhamn and Söderhamn, 
2002), whilst MUST was developed and widely used in the UK across different settings. The 
MNA® (Guigoz et al., 1996) and its shortened version, MNA®-SF  (Rubenstein et al., 2001) 
have been performed worldwide and have been translated into different languages. 
Meanwhile, the Elderly Nutrition Screening (ENS®) tool was developed in Canada for older 
adults (Payette et al., 1995). 
A systematic literature review of nutritional screening tools in community living older adults  
emphasised that screening tools should be tested for validity and reliability to ensure their  
sensitivity and specificity (Phillips et al., 2010). The review  evaluated nutrition screening 
tools used for older adults in the community and reported that the MNA®-SF  was the most 
appropriate nutrition screening tool for identification of malnutrition risk in community living 
older adults (>65 years) because of it has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity 
(Phillips et al., 2010). The MNA®-SF, which consists of 6 items (Rubenstein et al., 2001) was 
derived from the 18-item full  MNA® (Kaiser et al., 2009; Rubenstein et al., 2001). Ease of 
 11 
 
use and quick screening is highly favourable to ensure wide acceptance among health care 
personnel. Thus, the MNA®-SF  is favoured as the most practical instrument (Bauer et al., 
2010) as it  can be completed in less than 5 minutes (De La Montana and Miguez, 2011; 
Skates and Anthony, 2012). 
3.2 
Malnutrition risk in community living older adults 
Studies identifying malnutrition risk in community living older adults indicate a wide 
nutritional risk range for studies without nutrition intervention (Table 2), and in those that 
were accompanied by an intervention (Table 3). This was due to different nutrition screening 
tools being used and the heterogeneity of study participants. Some of the studies included 
frail older adults, homebound, older adults receiving home care and very old older adults, 
which contributed to a higher malnutrition risk as compared to other community living older 
adults.  
 
All of the studies were observational, either cross sectional (n= 43) (Level IV) or cohort 
(n=11) (Level III-2), with duration of up to 5 years. No randomised controlled trials were 
identified. 
3.2.1 Nutrition Screening Initiative (NSI) 
Twenty-one studies were identified that used the Nutrition Screening Inititative.  Eighteen 
studies used the DETERMINE checklist, whilst another three studies used modified Level I 
and II screens. There is no standardized scoring algorithm for the original Level I and II 
screen, thus the modified version scores are based on the DETERMINE checklist (Sharkey 
and Haines, 2002). One study scored the NSI Level II screen outcomes  according to the 
number of  undesirable responses for individual items included in the  screening tool 
(Ledikwe et al., 2003). Meanwhile, Jensen and colleagues (1997) have reported results for 
responses obtained using  the modified Level I and II items, without a cut-off scoring system. 
 12 
 
Three level III-2 cohort studies were identified (Benedict et al., 1999; Klein et al., 1997; 
Wunderlich et al., 2011). According to the NSI, up to 83% of community-dwelling older 
adults were at high risk of malnutrition (Ballard et al., 2013; Benedict et al., 1999; Coulston 
et al., 1996; Ledikwe et al., 2003; Lokken et al., 2002; MacLellan and Van Til, 1998; 
Marshall et al., 1999; Marshall et al., 2001; Sharkey and Haines, 2001; Sharkey et al., 2000; 
Weatherspoon et al., 2004; Yap et al., 2007).   
 
Higher malnutrition risks were reported among homebound elderly (Lee and Novielli, 1996), 
low income older adults (Lokken et al., 2002; Miller et al., 1996; Sharkey et al., 2000) and 
those living in rural areas (Ledikwe et al., 2003; Sharkey and Haines, 2001),  compared to 
those living  in urban areas (Weatherspoon et al., 2004). Poor self-perceived health (Lokken 
et al., 2002; Miller et al., 1996; Weatherspoon et al., 2004) and functional status (Lee and 
Novielli, 1996; Sharkey et al., 2000) were also higher in those individuals identified at 
nutritional  risk.  
 
 13 
 
3.2.2 Some of the studies have also focused on nutritional risk indicators from 
DETERMINE items with polypharmacy (Jensen et al., 1997; Ledikwe et al., 2003; 
MacLellan and Van Til, 1998; Marshall et al., 1999; Miller et al., 1996; Yap et al., 
2007), inadequate dairy, fruit and vegetable intakes (Marshall et al., 1999; Miller et 
al., 1996; Yap et al., 2007), dietary modification due to illness  (Benedict et al., 1999; 
MacLellan and Van Til, 1998; Marshall et al., 1999) and eating alone being  identified 
as main contributors (Benedict et al., 1999; Ledikwe et al., 2003; MacLellan and Van 
Til, 1998; Marshall et al., 1999). Curl and Warren (1997) have identified malnutrition 
risks factors based on numbers of  identified risk items (≥2 and ≥3 risks). Lokken et al 
(2002) reported that mean BMI in the high risk and at risk groups are 29 kg/m2 and of 
26 kg/m2, respectively. Meanwhile, a self-reported BMI of >27 kg/m2 is one of the 
most prevalent nutrition risk factors (Ledikwe et al., 2003) and nutritional risk score 
≥12 is associated with poverty (Sharkey et al., 2000).SCREEN©  
Adults younger than 65 years old were included in studies using SCREEN© for the purpose 
of early nutritional risk identification (Keller et al., 2007). Six Canadian studies had 
performed nutrition screening using this instrument targeting older adults aged 50 years and 
above; and had identified a range of 39 -57% for malnutrition  risk in participants with a 
mean age of 65 years (Keller, 2004, 2006; Keller et al., 2007; Keller and Hedley, 2002; 
Keller and Østbye, 2003; Keller et al., 2004). Four of the studies were  cohort studies, with 
the longest duration being  18 months  (Keller, 2006; Keller et al., 2007; Keller and Østbye, 
2003; Keller et al., 2004); while the remaining two were cross sectional in design (Keller, 
2004; Keller and Hedley, 2002). At 18 months of follow up, 75% participants from various 
nutritional risk categories perceived that their quality of life had deteriorated since baseline, 
while whole-life satisfaction and good physical health days were lower in the high nutritional 
risk group in the follow up period compared to those in  the other groups (Keller et al., 2004). 
In addition, mortality rate was 7.4% at  follow up and was recorded to be higher in males, 
those of older age and those that were classified as malnourished  (Keller and Østbye, 2003). 
Low nutritional risk was associated with better self-rated quality of life (Keller, 2004) and 
 14 
 
common nutritional problems that were identified included  self-reported significant weight 
change in 6 months, poor intake of fruits, vegetables and dairy products; and dietary 
restrictions (Keller and Hedley, 2002). 
 
3.2.3 SCREEN© II 
SCREEN© II, an improved version of SCREEN©, identified 31-52% of individuals to be at 
high risk of malnutrition (Broeska et al., 2013; McElnay et al., 2012; Ramage-Morin and 
Garriguet, 2013; Wham et al., 2011a; Wham et al., 2011c). A combination of at risk and high 
risk categories resulted in a prevalence of up to 62% (Southgate et al., 2010; Watson et al., 
2010; Wham et al., 2011c). Living alone (McElnay et al., 2012; Ramage-Morin and 
Garriguet, 2013; Wham et al., 2011c), less social support (Ramage-Morin and Garriguet, 
2013), depression (Ramage-Morin and Garriguet, 2013), poor self rated health (Wham et al., 
2011a), disability (Wham et al., 2011a) and eating alone (Watson et al., 2010; Wham et al., 
2011a) were identified as factors associated with malnutrition risk. Meanwhile, a higher 
mortality rate within 5 years was documented in the high nutritional risk group, compared to  
those in other groups (Broeska et al., 2013).  Low nutritional risk was associated with being 
physically more active, greater  muscle mass and muscle strength, and a lower percentage of 
body fat (Wham et al., 2011c). The SCREEN© II may need to be modified when used in 
different populations from which it was developed. There is some evidence that interpretation 
of  items included in the  SCREEN© II  differs according to population group being studies, 
and  which makes cross-country comparisons difficult (Wham et al., 2011b). 
 
 15 
 
3.2.4 Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF®) 
Five studies used the MNA®-SF to screen for malnutrition and all of them were cross-
sectional in design  (Ji et al., 2012; Nykänen et al., 2013; Timpini et al., 2011; Ülger et al., 
2010; Winter et al., 2013). Less than 8% of older adults were malnourished and at risk of 
malnutrition in a sub-urban area in Italy (Timpini et al., 2011). A study in Australian general 
practice demonstrated one malnourished and 16% at risk older adults aged 75 years and older 
(Winter et al., 2013).  This study also reported that the at risk group had significantly lower 
mean body mass index (BMI) than their well-nourished peers and that 34% of the at-risk 
group had BMI ≥25 while 13% were identified as underweight. Twenty-eight percent  of  
2327 community living older adults in Turkey appeared to be at risk of malnutrition (score ≤ 
11) in  an outpatient geriatric clinic (Ülger et al., 2010). A higher prevalence of being at risk 
of malnutrition (70.4%) was  documented in China (Ji et al., 2012), while aa Finnish  study 
reported  15% of older adults to be either malnourished or at risk  (Nykänen et al., 2013).   
Poor self-rated health, receiving home care and meal services, polypharmacy, symptoms of 
depression, cognitive impairment, older age, and poor functional status were associated with 
an increased malnutrition risk (Nykänen et al., 2013). 
 
3.2.5 Nutritional Form For the Elderly (NUFFE) 
Four cross sectional studies used the NUFFE. Three studies were conducted in Norway (Dale 
et al., 2012; Sundsli et al., 2012; Tomstad et al., 2012) and one in Sweden (Söderhamn et al., 
2012). Approximately 80% of older adults were identified as well-nourished according to 
NUFFE classification (Söderhamn et al., 2012; Tomstad et al., 2012). Sundsli et al (2012) 
found a higher risk amongst  adults aged ≥85 years with a mean NUFFE score of 6.6 ±4.1, 
which is in the at risk category; whilst the mean score of  total participants aged  ≥65 years 
was in the low risk category (4.0 ± 3.1). Poorer self-care ability was found in the at risk group 
 16 
 
and associated with inability to prepare food (Dale et al., 2012). Identified contributors to 
nutrition risk were receiving assistance for daily living, being inactive, displaying a sense of 
helplessness and living alone (Tomstad et al., 2012). 
 
3.2.6 Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) 
Two Norweigan cross sectional studies that used the  MUST  screening tool (Kvamme et al., 
2011a; Kvamme et al., 2011b) reported that less than 10% of participants were at risk and/or 
malnourished (Kvamme et al., 2011a; Kvamme et al., 2011b). Health related quality of life 
reduced significantly in those considered to be at risk (Kvamme et al., 2011b) and mental 
health symptoms were significantly associated with nutritional risk (Kvamme et al., 2011a). 
 
3.2.7 Elderly Nutrition Screening (ENS®) 
ENS was used in two studies. A prospective cohort study in Canada identified that 60% of 
free living older people were at moderate to high risk of malnutrition according to ENS 
classification. Poor self-rated heath increased nutrition risk threefold (Roberts et al., 2007). 
Another Canadian study reported elevated risk in 46.1%  men and 55.9% women; with older 
age being a significant factor contributing to  nutrition risk (Ávila-Funes et al., 2008). 
 
3.2.8 Australian Nutrition Screening Initiative (ANSI) 
Brownie (2007), Burge and Gazibarich (1999), Patterson et al  (2002); and Cobiac and 
Syrette (1995) used ANSI. Approximately 30% were identified at high nutritional risk, whilst 
the combination of high and moderate nutritional risk is up to 60%. (Brownie et al., 2007; 
Burge and Gazibarich, 1999; Cobiac and Syrette, 1995; Patterson et al., 2002). ANSI was 
used as an instrument to identify risk of malnutrition via a national postal survey (Brownie et 
 17 
 
al., 2007; Patterson et al., 2002) as well as through self-completion (Cobiac and Syrette, 
1995). However, Brownie et  al (2007) warned that ANSI may overestimate risk of 
malnutrition as  a screening tool  and it has since been reported that the ANSI has poor 
reliability (Phillips et al., 2010). 
 
3.2.9 Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) 
Only one study used MST to screen for malnutrition. The Australian study of clients of Home 
and Community Care (HACC) identified  15% of the sample to be considered to be at 
nutritional risk (Leggo et al., 2008). 
 
3.2.10 Nutritional Risk Index (NRI)  
Only one cross sectional study in the USA used the NRI tool. The study identified that 7.5% 
of older adults were at high risk (Nickols-Richardson et al., 1996). The authors found that 
older age was a predictor of nutritional risk; and suggested that the low identified risk may be 
due to frailer individuals having been institutionalised. 
 
3.3 
Structured pathways of care following screening  
Structured pathways of care following nutrition screening are outlined by the MST, MNA®-
SF and MUST tools according to categories of nutrition status. No structured pathways were 
identified from other screening tools. The DETERMINE checklist recommends that older 
adults who are classified as either being at moderate or  high risk seek further nutritional  
advice from their health care professionals. Meanwhile, recommended intervals for repeat 
screening vary based on nutritional status categories and tools.  From these three identified 
tools, the MNA®-SF is the only instrument that was specifically developed for older adults 
 
 18 
 
3.4 
Nutrition intervention and outcomes  
Most international studies in community settings were cross sectional to determine the 
prevalence of malnutrition, but many did not include nutrition interventions (Yap et al., 
2007). In this review, only eleven of the fifty-four nutrition screening studies were 
accompanied with nutrition interventions. Meanwhile, no nutrition interventions were 
available for older adults in nutrition screening studies that used the MNA®-SF, NUFFE, 
MUST, ENS® or NRI. 
 
3.4.1 Dietetic referral and advice 
Eight of the identified studies included dietetic intervention strategies to address malnutrition. 
Four studies demonstrated that dietetic advice improved older adults’ nutritional status 
(Benedict et al., 1999; Keller et al., 2007; Klein et al., 1997; Leggo et al., 2008); whilst 
another four studies did not evaluate  outcomes related to  dietetic intervention (Burge and 
Gazibarich, 1999; Herndon, 1995; Watson et al., 2010; Weddle et al., 1997).  A range of 7 to 
64% of older adults  refused to see a dietitian despite being  identified as being at nutritional 
risk or malnourished (Benedict et al., 1999; Herndon, 1995; Keller et al., 2007; Klein et al., 
1997; Leggo et al., 2008). More than half of older adults who attended dietetic consultations 
had no concerns about being at nutritional risk (Benedict et al., 1999). Keller et al (2007) 
have reported reasons for a decline in referral to dietetic services as being  patient  denial of  
risk status, lack of  interest, cost of dietetic intervention and lack of  intention  to introduce 
changes to  diet. 
Only one study has highlighted dietetic referrals for nutrition intervention in Australia.  
Leggo et al. (2008) aimed to develop a dietetic referral system among Home and Community 
Care (HACC) clients through the implementation of nutrition screening using MST.  A 
nutrition assessment tool, the Patient Generated- Subjective Global Assessment  (PG-SGA)   
 19 
 
was further employed to evaluate the extent of malnutrition risk in the study (Leggo et al., 
2008). Other successful approaches to improve older adults’ nutritional status include group 
nutrition education, which involved cooking demonstrations and group discussions, as well as 
telephone counselling (Wunderlich et al., 2011). 
 
3.4.2 Nutrition information resources 
This review identified that nutrition information resources were made available for older 
adults in  five studies (Benedict et al., 1999; Burge and Gazibarich, 1999; Keller et al., 2007; 
Southgate et al., 2010; Wunderlich et al., 2011). Printed materials were most commonly used 
in order to deliver nutrition information; namely pamphlets, healthy eating booklets and 
flyers; and a one year subscription to a nutrition newsletter.  
 
3.4.3 Meals on Wheels (MOW) / home delivered meal service 
Three studies have included MOW/ home delivered meals service as an approach for 
nutrition intervention (Keller, 2006; Keller et al., 2007; Watson et al., 2010).  Meals on 
Wheels has been shown to be a successful intervention strategy in one of the studies through 
improvement in SCREEN© score at 18 months follow up (Keller, 2006). The other two 
studies did not highlight outcomes of the MOW intervention (Keller et al., 2007; Watson et 
al., 2010) .   
 
In this review, ten studies recruited MOW/home delivered meal service clients as study 
participants (Herndon, 1995; Keller, 2004, 2006; Keller et al., 2007; Keller and Østbye, 2003; 
Sharkey and Haines, 2001; Sharkey et al., 2000; Weatherspoon et al., 2004; Weddle et al., 
1997; Wunderlich et al., 2011); whilst one study involved MOW applicants (Coulston et al., 
 20 
 
1996).  In the USA,  68% of MOW clients were able to maintain their physical function and 
minimise adverse effects of malnutrition with the help of a MOW service (Herndon, 1995). It 
was reported that the increased use of a MOW service indicates deterioration in nutritional 
status (Keller, 2006). 
 
3.4.4 Community services 
The role of community services in nutrition intervention has been identified. Two studies 
have adopted this strategy. Referral to appropriate support services in the community such as 
assistance with shopping helped to improve nutritional status in a Canadian study (Keller et 
al., 2007); whilst the other study did not mention the specific community services offered to 
study participants (Klein et al., 1997). 
 
3.4.5 Oral nutrition supplements (ONS) 
The use of high energy and high protein ONS does not appear to be a frontline nutrition 
intervention approach in community settings as none of the identified studies adopted this 
strategy (Benedict et al., 1999; Wunderlich et al., 2011).  
 
 
4 DISCUSSION  
This review has identified fifty-four (n=54) nutrition screening studies using validated 
nutrition screening tools in community living older adults, types of nutrition interventions, 
pathways of care and patient outcomes following screening. The availability of various 
nutritional screening tools for malnutrition risk screening and the heterogeneity of study 
participants contribute to a wide range of reported risk of malnutrition (0- 83%) in 
 21 
 
community-living older adults. The alarming figures warrant appropriate attention and care 
by health professionals.  
 
The implementation of routine nutrition screening for community living older adults can help 
to identify malnutrition risk and improve patient outcomes if accompanied by appropriate and 
timely nutrition intervention and follow up. Only eleven (n=11) studies in this review went 
on to provide nutrition intervention for older adults who were identified to be either 
malnourished or at high nutritional risk. However, some of the studies reported that older 
adults refused to undergo nutrition intervention although it was offered to them (Herndon, 
1995; Keller et al., 2007; Klein et al., 1997; Leggo et al., 2008). Further evaluation regarding 
reasons for refusing to see a dietitian and declining to avail themselves of the suggested 
interventions should be addressed accordingly.  
 
Nevertheless, most screening tools being used in intervention studies do not provide 
guidelines on the structured intervention pathways following screening for further follow up. 
Only a study by Leggo and colleagues (2008) conducted nutrition screening in older 
Australians  using the MST, a validated tool with a recommended intervention pathway. 
Although none of the studies in this review included high energy and high protein oral 
nutrition supplementation (ONS) as a nutrition intervention strategy, the recommendation of 
ONS intake is normally provided by dietitians during individualised dietetic consultations 
and is a strategy most often used in an  inpatient setting. Another systematic literature review 
reported that dietary consultation, either  with or without prescription of ONS, improved  
body weight in malnourished older adults which suggests that the  dietetic consultation  itself 
is  key to improving  nutritional status (Baldwin and Weekes, 2011). Furthermore, efficacy of 
 22 
 
ONS for community living older adults remains unclear,  as has been reported in a meta-
analysis (Milne et al., 2009). 
 
Only seven studies involved nutrition monitoring, whilst a total of eight studies reported 
outcomes of interventions. The duration of monitoring following an initial nutrition screen 
varied from 4 weeks (Southgate et al., 2010) to two years (Wunderlich et al., 2011). All 
studies reported improvements in older adults’ nutritional status after  they had received 
different approaches of nutrition intervention strategies, including  printed nutrition education 
resources (Southgate et al., 2010), subscription to a  nutrition newsletter and dietary 
consultation (Benedict et al., 1999),  referral to MOW  (Herndon, 1995; Keller, 2006);  a 
combination of counselling, nutrition education resources and a home delivery meal program 
(Keller et al., 2007; Wunderlich et al., 2011), and individualised dietetic evaluation and 
consultation  (Herndon, 1995; Klein et al., 1997; Leggo et al., 2008). Further evaluation of 
outcomes of nutrition interventions following nutrition screening for those in a compromised 
nutritional status living in the community is warranted (Vedantam et al., 2010; Visvanathan 
et al., 2003).  
 
 Most of the studies in this review are cross sectional studies to identify nutritional risk in 
community living older adults without nutrition intervention. A previous systematic literature 
review identified that a nutrition screening initiative alone is not enough to result  in 
beneficial patient outcomes (Weekes et al., 2009).  There is a need to conduct prospective 
longitudinal studies along with appropriate nutritional interventions as emphasized by 
Roberts et al (2007).  Green and Watson (2006) also  highlighted the need for  a more 
detailed assessment and care plan following nutrition screening for those who are 
malnourished, or at risk of malnutrition. No randomised controlled trials using validated 
 23 
 
nutritional screening tools followed up with appropriate nutrition intervention were identified 
in this review. A nutrition care process and model to further evaluate patients’ nutritional 
status was established by the American Dietetic Association (ADA). This  recommends a 
continuous cycle of nutrition assessment, diagnosis, intervention and monitoring (American 
Dietetic Association, 2008). There is ample evidence that nutrition intervention is essential 
and should be addressed accordingly before irreversible nutritional risk takes place (Keller et 
al., 2007; Ülger et al., 2010). However, there are challenges regarding patient review  in the 
community setting following discharge from hospital  (Beck et al., 2001). In order to prevent 
a disconnect between levels of care (tertiary vs primary),  a systematic approach is required, 
as  consistent with ADA’s recommendation (de van der Schueren et al., 2014). Thus, a need 
for  greater awareness from health care professionals is required for appropriate nutritional 
care delivery in the  community as this is where the  majority of the  older population resides  
(Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2012). 
 
Implementation of routine nutrition screening in general practice is an ideal strategy for 
timely malnutrition risk  identification and  provision of appropriate  nutrition interventions 
and follow up (Flanagan et al., 2012; Hamirudin et al., 2014). However, reports of nutrition 
screening initiatives conducted in general practice are uncommon, as confirmed in this 
review.   It is more beneficial to screen patients early in order to prevent and identify this 
issue rather than detecting severe malnutrition problems later on (BAPEN Malnutrition 
Advisory Group, 2003b). Adequate community resources are essential for implementation of 
nutrition screening and intervention (Keller et al., 2007).  The use of a nutrition screening 
tool can help in increasing nutrition awareness (Southgate et al., 2010). Meanwhile, older 
adults have identified general practice as the most preferred place to obtain nutrition 
information (Benedict et al., 1999). Thus, the nutrition screening process presents  a window 
 24 
 
of opportunity for further discussion on nutrition; and  identification of malnutrition and 
related adverse effects (Healy et al., 2014). A real challenge is to deliver a seamless 
nutritional care process in general practice settings; between general practitioners and other 
healthcare providers (Ball et al., 2012). As nutrition screening is not usually performed by 
dietetic and nutrition specialists (ADA, 2008), nurses have been recognised to play this key 
role in conducting nutrition screening in the community and across other care settings (Skates 
and Anthony, 2012).  
 
Healthy ageing and independent living at home are essential targets for older adults 
(Department of Health and Ageing, 2012). Malnutrition identification through nutrition 
screening in the community and nutrition intervention and monitoring are vital as reversing 
the negative outcomes of malnutrition are far more difficult (Flanagan et al., 2012). Further 
collaborative work amongst healthcare professionals is important to  assist older adults to live 
independently at home in their best nutritional status (Australian and New Zealand Society 
for Geriatric Medicine, 2009).  
 
Limitations of this review include exclusion of non-English journal articles and that it 
covered for the time period of January 1994 until December 2013 only. However, this review 
is at the forefront in reporting outcomes following nutrition screening in community living 
older adults. Further high quality studies are warranted to further confirm beneficial 
outcomes of nutrition screening accompanied with nutrition intervention, monitoring and 
evaluation. Appropriate nutrition intervention using structured pathways of care and multi-
disciplinary approaches to nutritional care are recommended. 
 25 
 
5 CONCLUSIONS 
Timely identification of malnutrition risk using validated nutrition screening instruments, 
along with appropriate nutrition interventions and ongoing monitoring, improves the 
nutritional status of community living older adults. Nutrition interventions should also be 
considered a priority following nutrition screening for malnourished and at risk older adults.  
Further evaluation of outcomes related to nutrition screening and appropriate intervention, 
according to structured pathways of care is warranted.
