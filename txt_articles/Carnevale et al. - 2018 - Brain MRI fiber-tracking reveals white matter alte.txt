Aims
Hypertension is one of the main risk factor for dementia. The subtle damage provoked by chronic high blood pres-
sure in the brain is usually evidenced by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in terms of white matter
(WM) hyperintensities or cerebral atrophy. However, it is clear that by the time brain damage is visible, it may be
too late hampering neurodegeneration. Aim of this study was to characterize a signature of early brain damage in-
duced by hypertension, before the neurodegenerative injury manifests.

Methods
and results
This work was conducted on hypertensive and normotensive subjects with no sign of structural damage at conven-
tional neuroimaging and no diagnosis of dementia revealed by neuropsychological assessment. All individuals
underwent cardiological clinical examination in order to define the hypertensive status and the related target organ
damage. Additionally, patients were subjected to DTI-MRI scan to identify microstructural damage of WM by
probabilistic fiber-tracking. To gain insights in the neurocognitive profile of patients a specific battery of tests was
administered. As primary outcome of the study we aimed at finding any specific signature of fiber-tracts alterations
in hypertensive patients, associated with an impairment of the related cognitive functions. Hypertensive patients
showed significant alterations in three specific WM fiber-tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation, the superior longitu-
dinal fasciculus and the forceps minor. Hypertensive patients also scored significantly worse in the cognitive
domains ascribable to brain regions connected through those WM fiber-tracts, showing decreased performances in
executive functions, processing speed, memory, and paired associative learning tasks.
....................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Overall, WM fiber-tracking on MRI evidenced an early signature of damage in hypertensive patients when otherwise
undetectable by conventional neuroimaging. In perspective, this approach could allow identifying those patients that
are in initial stages of brain damage and could benefit of therapies aimed at limiting the transition to dementia and
neurodegeneration.

1. Introduction
High blood pressure (BP) is a chronic condition that causes progressive
target organ damage.1,2 Decades of studies in hypertension allowed the
identification of typical features of preclinical lesions in target organs of
chronic increased BP, making available to clinicians clear markers of dis-
ease progression and complications in peripheral organs. However, high
BP also profoundly challenges the brain. Besides contributing to acute
forms of brain damage like ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, hypertension
is also the major risk factor for chronic brain injury, manifesting with altera-
tions of cognitive functions, ranging from subtle deficits to dementia.3,4 It is
well known that the vast majority of cases of Alzheimer’s Disease and re-
lated dementia in elderly are not ascribable to genetic predisposition but
rather to the chronic exposure to vascular risk factors in midlife.

That is said, the clinical approach to this category of patients usually
starts when symptoms are clearly evident and progression of dementia is
perceived even by themselves. Indeed, the clinically relevant brain dam-
age can be evidenced by conventional imaging, like structural MRI, which
assesses the brain injury associated to the symptomatology and usually
characterized as cerebral atrophy and white matter (WM) hyperinten-
sities.5–9 However, it has becoming increasingly clear that when these
macroscopic signs of brain damage are manifest, it may be too late to re-
verse the neurodegenerative process and we still lack procedures for
assessing progression markers that could reveal pre-symptomatic altera-
tions and identify patients at risk of developing dementia lately.
A conceptual advancement that could help in overcoming these limi-
tations, comes from novel neuroimaging approaches in MRI, capable to
recognize alterations in the brain when conventional methods of analysis
fail in detecting signs of damage.10 To this aim, WM microstructural alter-
ations began to be studied using DTI.11–13 The basic concept standing
behind this approach exploits the water diffusion properties in WM and
can reveal localized abnormalities in specific brain areas. The quantitative
analysis of these diffusion properties let us calculate different indexes,
which can describe the characteristics of integrity and organization of
WM fiber bundles. The advantage over conventional methods stands on
the possibility to identify damage at microscopic level instead of macro-
scopic lesions, making it possible staging damage progression.
A main limitation in the use of this approach came from the evidence
that the initial region of interest (ROI)-based or atlas-based methods of
DTI analysis evidenced many technical flaws. More recently, the techno-
logical advancement allowed to overcome these limitations by develop-
ing methods to spatially characterize WM diffusion abnormalities along
the pathway of a specific tract of WM instead of larger brain areas, and
modelling appropriate diffusion schemes based on probabilistic assump-
tions14 that produce a set of trajectories linked to a specific voxel.14,15
Thus far, however, no study exploited this strategy to examine micro-
structural WM damage in hypertensive patients, at a stage where they
have normal brain imaging at conventional MRI and no diagnosis of de-
mentia at the neurocognitive assessment. The goal of our work was to
identify a specific signature of subtle and early alterations in the brain of
hypertensive patients, through the combined use of probabilistic fiber-
tracking of WM and neuropsychological assessment.
2. Methods
2.1 Experimental design
This study was conducted at IRCCS Neuromed, Department of
Angiocardioneurology and Translational Medicine. The protocol was per-
formed in compliance with the ethical standards established in the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethical Committee of our
Institution, as registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02310217). Informed
consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.
Between November 2014 and September 2017, we screened subjects
admitted at our outpatients’ facility—Regional Excellence Hypertension
Center of the Italian Society of Hypertension—affiliated to the
Department of Neurological Complications of Cardiovascular Diseases of
our Institute. We recruited individuals conforming to the following crite-
ria: aged 40 to 65years, compliant to give written informed consent, possi-
bility to perform a dedicated 3 Tesla-MRI scan. The resulting 143 eligible
patients were subjected to the assessment of strict inclusion/exclusion
criteria by two independent raters. The exclusion criteria were the follow-
ing: stroke, dementia, schizophrenia, seizures, Parkinson’s disease, bipolar
disorder, and any other diagnosed neurologic or psychiatric disease, claus-
trophobia, secondary hypertension, end-stage heart disease, renal failure,
dialysis treatment, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and drugs that could affect
cognitive functions. In the end, 70 patients met the criteria and entered
the study. Then, in order to have a homogeneous sample of individuals,
we further excluded subjects with already manifest signs of damage or
alterations at conventional MRI and/or diagnosis of dementia, assessed as
detailed in the specific sections below. After this latter screening, 28
patients reporting WM hyperintensities or lacunar damage (n= 19), neuri-
noma (n= 1), meningioma (n= 1), angioma (n= 1), brain calcifications
(n= 2), and artefacts due to movement (n= 4) were further excluded,
resulting in a final sample of 42 individuals.
Each subject included in the study protocol underwent clinical exami-
nations to assess covariates as office BP, smoking, body mass index
(BMI), and education, and were categorized in hypertensive (n = 23) and
normotensive (n = 19) individuals accordingly to their history of hyper-
tension, current anti-hypertensive therapy and target organ damage, de-
termined as detailed below in specific sessions. Since the protocol was
designed as an observational study, there was no unified anti-
hypertensive schedule for hypertensives and actual anti-hypertensive
therapy was recorded for all patients and included the following main
classes of drugs: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angioten-
sin II receptor blockers (ACE-I/ARBs), calcium channel blockers,
diuretics, and b-blockers.
2.2 Clinical procedures
2.2.1 Neuroimaging, DTI processing, and fiber-tracking
Brain MRI was performed on a 3T GE Signa Horizon scanner (General
Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). After localization and calibra-
tion routines, the sequences used were as follows: T1-weighted images in
axial orientation, acquired using a 3D SPGR sequence (TR/TE/TI= 5.6/1.7/
400ms, flip angle= 11�, FOV= 256mm, slice thickness= 1mm, pixel spa-
cing= 1.0mm� 1.0mm) with a 256� 256 in-plane resolution; AX DP/T2
scan
(TR/TE/TE2= 3320/10/103.0ms,
FOV= 220mm,
slice
thick-
ness= 4mm); DTI was performed with a diffusion weighted spin echo-
planar imaging sequence (TR/TE= 89.7/12200ms, slice thickness 3mm, 50
contiguous slices, maximum b-value = 1000 s/mm2 in 30 optimized non-
collinear directions; one volume was acquired without diffusion weight-
ing). All images were anonymized; radiological assessment was performed
by a blinded radiologist; subsequent DTI and structural image analysis was
performed by a blinded operator through an automated analysis protocol.
Conventional MRI on T1 and AX DP/T2 scans were used to assess
the presence of macroscopic brain damage, presence of WM hyperin-
tensity load, lacunae, or other pathological alterations. A negative radio-
logical result was considered an indispensable criterion to be eligible and
the inclusion cut-off used for vascular-related damage was set at a
Fazekas score<
_ 1.
Diffusion images were processed using the standardized pipeline with
the DTIfit tool. After pre-processing, analysis was performed using the
PROBTRACK tool of probabilistic Bayesian Framework for tractogra-
phy. PROBTRACK exploits a diffusion model estimated by BEDPOSTX,
a tool for probabilistic diffusion parameters estimation capable of model-
ling crossing fibers. A standard tractography pipeline has been imple-
mented using the plugin AutoPTX, following parameters and quality
check procedures as described.16 Tracts were categorized in associative,
projection, limbic, and callosal. Diffusion parameters were quantified
with Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Axial Diffusivity
(AD), and Radial Diffusivity (RD). The tract segmentation was achieved

by thresholding the normalized tract density images. The threshold was
selected according to the FA reproducibility criterion,17 segmented tract
volumes were computed to exclude WM tract atrophies. FA, MD, AD,
and RD were averaged for voxels inside tract segmentations. All tools
were available from FSL Suite (version 5.0.8).18–20
The analysis of brain cortex assessed cortical thinning or atrophy (ex-
clusion criteria for the study) and was performed with FSL-VBM (Voxel
based morphometry),21 an optimized VBM protocol22 carried out with
FSL tools.18 First, structural images were brain-extracted and grey
matter-segmented before being registered to the MNI152 standard
space using non-linear registration.23 Second, all native grey matter
images were non-linearly registered to this study-specific template and
‘modulated’ to correct for local expansion (or contraction) due to the
non-linear component of the spatial transformation. The modulated
grey matter images were then smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian
kernel with a sigma of 3 mm. Finally, voxelwise General Linear Model
(GLM) was applied using permutation-based non-parametric testing,
correcting for multiple comparisons across space with significance
threshold of corrected P-value (P <0.05).
2.2.2 Hypertension diagnosis and blood pressure
measurement
Hypertension diagnosis was performed based on a systolic blood pres-
sure >140mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure >90mmHg or they were
previously
diagnosed
with
hypertension
and
treated
with
anti-
hypertensive drugs. BP was measured in sitting position after 5minutes of
rest, using an automated validated device (OMRON-705IT) with an ap-
propriately sized cuff on the dominant arm. Three consecutive measure-
ments were taken at 2minutes apart and average values were recorded.
2.2.3 Ultrasonographic analyses for cardiac and vascular
imaging
The overall one-dimensional left ventricle (LV) measurements and the
two-dimensional views were obtained following the American Society of
Echocardiography guidelines.24 Left Ventricular Mass (LVM) was calcu-
lated using the Devereux’s formula and normalized for the height ele-
vated to 2.7 (indexed LVMI). Hypertrophic remodeling was diagnosed
when LVMI > 50 g/m2.7.24,25 Then we calculated Relative Wall Thickness
(RWT) at end-diastole as 2 PWT/LVIDD. Diastolic function was
assessed as the ratio of early to late ventricular filling and patients were
categorized as diastolic dysfunction with a E/A ratio < 1.
The measures of intima media thickness (IMT) were obtained at the
distal 1.0 cm below the carotid bifurcation in common carotid and at the
proximal 1.0 cm of the internal carotid artery.26–28
Two blinded cardiologists reviewed the ultrasonographic analyses, to
assess cardiac and vascular remodeling.
2.2.4 Renal function
Renal function was assessed by evaluating serum creatinine levels, albu-
minuria, and estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) through standard-
ized procedures.
2.2.5 Cognitive assessment
Patients underwent cognitive assessment administered by a certified psy-
chologist, blinded to the clinical condition. The Instrumental Activities of
Daily Living (IADL) test was used to assess potential impairment of daily
life activities, by using a scale that measures emotional, cognitive, and
physical functions.29 Score ranges were from 0 (low function,
dependent) to 8 (high function, independent), with a cut off value set at
8 for females and 5 for males. Normal performance on this test was con-
sidered
an
indispensable
criterion
to
exclude
severe
cognitive
dysfunction.
MoCA battery of tests was used as the gold standard neuropsycholog-
ical evaluation in cerebrovascular diseases.30–32 According to validation
studies for patients with vascular dementia,30,33 patients who reported a
MoCA inferior to 17 were considered demented and consequently ex-
cluded from the study protocol. Subdomains of MoCA were categorized
according to normative data and were defined as following: visuospatial,
executive functions, language, attention, and memory. Verbal paired-
associate learning test was administered to evaluate subjects’ antero-
grade learning.34 Semantic Verbal Fluency Test was used to assess the
capability to access to semantic store through working memory35 and
lastly Stroop Test was administered to patients to evaluate the ability of
interfering stimuli interdiction.36 The execution of all the neuropsycho-
logical tests was completed always in the same order and allowed to
obtain a complete profiling of subjects’ cognitive functions.
2.3 Statistics
Based on preliminary data and previous studies assessing the impact of
cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive functions37,38 and hypothesizing a
predicted difference in MoCA score of 4 corrected points between mean
values obtained for normotensive (NT) and hypertensive patients (HT),
we calculated the power analysis for the study with SPSS SamplePower 3
software (version 3; IBM Solutions). Our computation analysis, assuming
a mean difference between the two populations of 4.0 points and a com-
mon within-group standard deviation (SD) of 3.0, estimated to enroll at
least 13 cases for each group to achieve an alpha of 0.05 and a beta power
of 0.90, by setting a two-tailed test for comparison of independent sam-
ples. With our actual sample size of 19 NT and 23 HT subjects for the
two groups, the study showed a power exceeding 99% to yield a statisti-
cally significant result, with a confidence interval of 2.72 to 5.28.
Depending on the type of variables, characteristics of patients were
presented as numbers (%) or means± SD.
Shapiro–Wilk Test was used to assess the normality of continuous var-
iables. Comparisons between NT and HT were performed using t-test
for independent samples for continuous variables or Mann–Whitney test
for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical data were compared
using Fisher exact v2 test. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess
the influence of relevant covariates in the significant differences emerged
in the univariate analysis. Bivariate correlation analyses were conducted
with Pearson correlation. When specified and accordingly to the datasets,
partial correlation analyses or linear regressions were performed to as-
sess the possibility that relevant covariates could influence the significant
results observed. All the analyses were performed with SPSS (version 23;
IBM Solutions). P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1 General characteristics of subjects and
hypertension-induced target organ damage
In order to stage the level of hypertensive disease’s progression,
recruited patients with general characteristics showed in Table 1 were
subjected to the evaluation of typical signs of target organ damage due to
chronic high BP. All the HT patients arriving at our observation were al-
ready on anti-hypertensive therapy, as listed in Supplementary material
online, Table S1. Estimated duration of hypertensive condition was also

(see
Supplementary material online, Table S1).
At echocardiography, HT displayed signatures of hypertrophic
remodeling, evidenced by increased thickness of LV walls, LVMI2.7, and
RWT (Table 1). Hypertensive patients showed a significant diastolic dys-
function, even though the preserved cardiac ejection fraction (EF) ob-
served in HT was indicative of an adaptive remodeling without loss of
contractility, thus excluding organ failure (Table 1). In measuring carotid
arteries’ IMT, HT displayed a moderate wall thickening (Table 1), usually
reflecting a status of chronic increased BP,39 reaching the significance
only for the left internal carotid artery. On the other hand, the absence
of atherosclerotic plaques excluded obstructive diseases that could
compromise cerebrovascular functioning. Lastly, we evaluated renal
function and observed that patients with hypertension had no alterations
in microalbuminuria, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate (eGFR) (Table 1).
3.2 Fiber-tracking highlights a signature of
WM microstructural alterations in hyper-
tensive patients
Accordingly to our inclusion/exclusion criteria, all individuals recruited
had no damage at conventional T2-MRI scans, assessed by a blinded neu-
roradiologist. We further ascertained absence of topical cortical thinning
of the grey matter, which could negatively impact on cognitive function,
independently of WM damage. To unravel this issue we performed VBM
analysis on T1-scan that showed normal grey matter, with no significant
cluster of differences between NT and HT individuals, with lowest P-
value equal to 0.274 across the volume (Figure 1). Additionally, we
checked whether the WM tracts segmented by fiber-tracking DTI-MRI
had any difference in the size, by evaluating single tracts’ volumes. No dif-
ference between HT and NT emerged, meaning that no tract evidenced
malformation or atrophy (see Supplementary material online, Table S2).

When we assessed the diffusion parameters of FA, MD, AD, and RD
of the WM tracts segmented by fiber-tracking DTI-MRI, we revealed
significant differences between HT and NT patients in specific tracts
(Figure 2 and Table 2). Concomitant FA and MD variations are usually
considered for extrapolation of specific tracts’ alterations. In brief, lower
FA indicates disorganized fascicles, affected by microstructural processes
such as demyelination, axonal degradation, or gliosis.13 MD, is a more
sensitive measure even though less specific, and it results increased by
pathological processes affecting neuronal membranes.13 We observed a
specific pattern of alterations in the WM fiber tracts of HT as compared
to NT (Figure 2 and Table 2). In particular, HT showed a significant deteri-
oration of WM connections in projection fibers of the Right Anterior
Thalamic Radiation (r-ATR) (Figure 2A), association fibers of the Right
Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (r-SLF) (Figure 2B) and callosal fibers of
the Forceps Minor (FMI) (Figure 2C).
Thus, over the whole WM tracts analysed (Figure 3A), HT patients dis-
played a significant decrease in FA and concomitant increase in MD in
the above-described specific tracts (i.e. ATR, SLF, and FMI), resulting in
the signature represented in Figure 3B. Interestingly, while concurrent
alterations of FA and MD were displayed only by right WM bundles of
the specific tracts, MD alone revealed a damage progressing in the con-
tralateral side (Table 2). In addition, AD and RD DTI parameters were
considered, to take into account the potential impact of different neural
mechanisms on WM abnormalities. Conventionally, incremental varia-
tions in RD are associated with myelin breakdown,13 whereas in AD de-
scribe secondary processes of axon degeneration.13 Our data also

report a significant alteration of RD and AD in the tracts of interest
(Table 2).
Though showing no significant difference between the two categories
of subjects, age is a known factor affecting diffusion parameters of
WM.40 In order to test whether the significant differences between HT
and NT patients emerged in the r-ATR, r-SLF, and FMI WM tracts were
affected by aging, we performed a multivariate analysis with age as covar-
iate. The difference in DTI parameters emerged in the univariate be-
tween HT and NT subjects was still significant in the ANCOVA,
independently of age (see Supplementary material online, Table S3).

To further exclude that other potentially influencing covariates could in-
terfere with the effects of hypertension on DTI parameters, we also
tested gender, smoke, and BMI by ANCOVA. None of these factors
influenced the significant difference between HT and NT for the WM
tracts reported in the univariate analysis (see Supplementary material
online, Table S3). More important, when we tested the potential influ-
ence of some anti-hypertensive drugs on the observed effects, we did
not find any significant interference for none of the medications used
(see Supplementary material online, Table S4).
3.3 Hypertensive patients showed a specific
pattern of cognitive alterations
Cognitive assessment began with the administration of IADL test for
all individuals. Each patient showed normal performance on this test
(Table 1) and, hence, was subjected to MoCA test.31 HT displayed signifi-
cantly impaired performance on MoCA, as compared to NT (Table 1).
Further analysis of specific cognitive subdomains tested by the MoCA
revealed significantly impaired memory, executive functions, attention,
and language domains (see Supplementary material online, Table S5).
The significantly worse score reported by HT patients in the verbal
paired-associate learning revealed difficulties in retaining new information
through working memory (Table 1). On the Stroop Test, HT did not per-
form as well as NT, thus indicating that hypertension negatively affects ex-
ecutive functions (Table 1). The Semantic Verbal Fluency Test showed
comparable performance in HT and NT, thereby indicating no alteration
in language abilities that could affect performance on other tasks (Table 1).
3.4 WM microstructural alterations scale
with cognitive impairment and target
organ damage
In the end, we generated correlation models among microstructural
WM alterations, cardiac remodeling, hypertensive condition and cogni-
tive profile. We found a significant positive correlation between MoCA
scores and FA of the projection and association fibers (ATR and SLF)
(Figure 3C and D). FA values of the same projection and association fibers
negatively correlated with the estimated duration of hypertension (Figure
3E) as MoCA scores did (Figure 3F). It is interesting to notice that the
sample of hypertensive patients (n = 18), excluded because of already
manifest neurological damage, had a significantly longer estimated

duration of hypertension when compared to the group of included
patients (mean± SD = 9.61± 5.57 vs. 6.13± 3.73years; *P < 0.05), thus
suggesting that with disease advancement, brain damage progressively
evolve toward an increasingly manifest injury. Further supporting this hy-
pothesis, both the included and excluded patients had comparable blood
pressure control (data not shown).
Hence, in order to test whether the observed correlations between
DTI parameters and cognitive scores was modulated by hypertensive
condition, we also performed a partial correlation analyses controlling for
SBP and years of hypertensive conditions. There were no significant influ-
ences of SBP levels and overall duration of hypertension in the correlation
observed neither between MoCA and FA r-ATR [SBP: df(39) = 0.239,
n = 42, P = 0.132; years of hypertension: df(39) = 0.199, n= 42, P = 0.213]
nor between MoCA and FA r-SLF [SBP: df(39)= 0.287, n = 39, P = 0.069;
years of hypertension: df(39) = 0.276, n= 42, P = 0.081].
Since altered FMI may be involved in impaired processing speed
tasks,41 we tested the correlation between Stroop interference time,
Stroop test errors and FMI-FA, finding a significant relationship sugges-
tive of an impact of hypertension in inhibiting interfering stimuli, repre-
sented by the time performance (Figure 3G and H). Even the correlation
observed between FA-FMI and Stroop Interference Time was controlled
for the interaction with both SBP, duration of hypertension and age,
given that this latter parameter emerged as influencing the deterioration
of FA-FMI observed in HT. Interestingly, while there was a statistically
significant negative partial correlation between Stroop Interference
Time and FA-FMI while controlling for SBP [df(39)= -0.321, n = 39,
P = 0.040] no effect was observed for overall duration of hypertension
[df(39)= -0.282, n = 42, P = 0.074] or when controlling for age
[df(39)= -0.126, n = 42, P = 0.431]. When controlling the correlation be-
tween Stroop test errors and FMI-FA for the same parameters it
emerged a significant negative correlation when controlling for overall
duration of hypertension [df(39) = -0.312, n = 42, P = 0.047] while no ef-
fect were observed controlling for SBP [df(39) = -0.300, n = 39,
P = 0.057] or when controlling for age [df(39)= -0.196, n = 42,
P = 0.219].
In the end, the significant negative correlation observed between
indexed LVMI and MoCA (Figure 3I) revealed parallel progression of
early cognitive alterations and initial peripheral organ damage.
4. Discussion
This is the first study that highlights how hypertensive patients present
microstructural alterations of specific WM tracts, at a stage where no
sign of macroscopic structural brain damage was evidenced by conven-
tional methods. The WM abnormalities, displayed in tracts segmented
by probabilistic fiber-tracking and associated to projection/association
fibers and callosum system, were not visible on structural MRI and were
associated with impairment of the related cognitive functions, typically
prodromal of later dementia.
Our results have been obtained in a hypertensive population charac-
terized by the absence of comorbidities and an initial stage of peripheral
organ damage, as shown by modest cardiac and vascular hypertrophic
remodeling, but no overt sign of end-organ failure. The lack of structural
brain injury induced by hypertension makes assessing prodromal signs
quite challenging. DTI-MRI revealed itself as an important step toward
using
advanced
neuroimaging
as
a
diagnostic
and
prognostic
biomarker.11,12
WM links different functional brain areas through bundles of fibers
established between different cortical structures or between sub-
cortical areas and the cortex. The fiber bundles could be thus defined,
following anatomical projections. Based on this a priori knowledge of the
whole connections in the brain, we can track the WM bundles relating
different functional areas and creating a unique tract identification for
each subject.16,42 By applying this method, we performed DTI-MRI trac-
tography, probabilistically estimating fiber orientation and number per
each voxel, and extracting quantitative diffusion parameters.14,15
Despite HT subjects in our study were on anti-hypertensive therapy,
the analysis evidenced a specific signature of their brains, characterized
by a deterioration of projection fibers (ATR), association fibers (SLF),
and callosum (FMI) systems. Interestingly, the injured tracts are related
to specific cognitive functions that were concomitantly impaired, as en-
visaged by performance on cognitive assessment. The ATR is a projec-
tion fiber that connects the thalamus’s anterior nucleus to the anterior
cingulate gyrus and frontal cortex, and ATR damage has been linked to
impaired memory,43 as revealed also in our HT patients by poor perfor-
mance on MoCA test, and specifically in the memory subscale. The SLF,
a tract composed of two long bi-directional bundles of neuronal axons,
connects the cerebrum parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes with the
ipsilateral frontal cortices.43 Characterized primarily as an association fi-
ber, the SLF facilitates the formation of a bidirectional neural network
necessary for cognitive functions such as attention, memory, emotions,
and language,43 functions as well impaired in HT under investigation in
our study. Lastly, the FMI, also known as the anterior forceps, is a fiber
bundle that connects the frontal lobes’ lateral and medial surfaces,
crosses the midline via the genu of the corpus callosum, and has been
linked to processing speed tasks.41 This latter is some way measured by
the results reported in the Stroop interference test, significantly worse
in HT. Taken together, the altered WM tracts recapitulate a spatial signa-
ture of microstructural alterations that could be prodromal of the brain
areas typically reported as affected by lacunar damage or hyperinten-
sities in studies performed in patients at later stages of the disease and
subjected to conventional MRI. Interestingly, this pattern of alteration
has been extracted from a sample of patients with adequate range of
blood pressure control, suggesting that an efficient anti-hypertensive
therapy is not sufficient to exclude the onset of vascular dementia or
protect the brain from WM microstructural damage. Further supporting
this concept, the sample of patients that we excluded because of macro-
scopic WM damage evidenced by conventional MRI had a significantly
longer estimated duration of hypertensive condition, despite showing
ranges of blood pressure control similar to those of the samples of
patients included in the study protocol.
In addition, it should be further considered that several other risk fac-
tors, typically associated with hypertension as well, as aging, increased
BMI and smoking, may influence per se WM integrity. The results
obtained in the covariate analyses conducted in subjects under investiga-
tion in this work, would suggest a negligible role of potential interactions
established between hypertension and confounding factors, thus
strengthening the relevance of the signature identified. Likely, the strict
inclusion/exclusion criteria chosen in this study allowed to study a popu-
lation of HT as deprived as possible of confounding factors for the analy-
sis of WM alterations.
To fully understand which kind of treatment can protect WM and
cognitive functions, studies aimed at addressing the mechanisms generat-
ing the damage need to be carried on. On this notice, two recent works
added important knowledge in this field of research, showing how salt in-
take can affect cerebral blood flow44 and how pericyte loss can alter the

vascular function in WM regions,45 suggesting new targets or medical
recommendations for adequate protection from hypertension-induced
brain damage.
4.1 Conclusions, study limitations, and
perspectives
Main strengths of this study consist in: 1) the comprehensive scan
protocol executed on a 3T-MRI for the acquisition of high-resolution
diffusion parameters of WM tracts obtained by fiber-tract probabilistic
analysis, instead of less efficient atlas selections-based protocols; 2)
restriction of the analysis to individuals with no evidence of brain damage
at conventional MRI nor diagnosis of dementia. Overall these criteria
allowed us to reveal early alterations of WM in patients where the con-
ventional diagnostic methods failed to evidence an initial stage of brain
injury.
At same time, this study also presents some limitations that deserve
discussion, in order to place our findings in the appropriate context and
pave the way for future studies. First, we acknowledge that the strict in-
clusion criteria resulted in a quite limited sample size of patients under
investigation. Secondly, we have only considered a baseline analysis of
these patients, having no chance at this stage of predicting the evolution
of the damage identified in HT patients.
In conclusion, although larger studies are needed to better define the
impact of such WM alterations on the evolution toward dementia, our
findings support the possibility that non-invasive tool of advanced brain
imaging coupled with cognitive assessment has the potential to provide
invaluable information, which could possibly aid in the early prediction of
long-term deficits in patients with hypertension. The current trend of
personalized treatments calls for the acquisition of more data, to give a
wider spectrum of information based not only on clinical assessments
but depicting the lifestyle and habits of patients potentially linked to the
etiology of hypertension. In future studies, clinical, tractographical, and
cognitive data will be complemented by lifestyle and dietary habits infor-
mation, in order to tailor an anti-hypertensive treatment on a per patient
basis.
