The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in perceptual decisions, but whether
its role is specific to sensory processing or sensorimotor transformation is not well under-
stood. Here, we trained mice to perform a go/no-go visual discrimination task and imaged the
activity of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) and PPC during engaged behavior and
passive viewing. Unlike V1 neurons, which respond robustly to stimuli in both conditions,
most PPC neurons respond exclusively during task engagement. To test whether signals in
PPC primarily encoded the stimulus or the animal’s impending choice, we image the same
neurons before and after re-training mice with a reversed sensorimotor contingency. Unlike
V1 neurons, most PPC neurons reflect the animal’s choice of the new target stimulus after re-
training. Mouse PPC is therefore strongly task-dependent, reflects choice more than stimulus,
and may play a role in the transformation of visual inputs into motor commands.

erceptual
decision-making
involves
multiple
cognitive
processes, including processing of sensory stimuli, accu-
mulation of evidence, and transformation of sensory
information into an appropriate motor plan. Although many
brain regions have been implicated in perceptual decisions, dis-
sociating their individual contribution to these different processes
remains a challenge.
In particular, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been
hypothesized to play a key role in at least some types of decision
tasks in both primates1,2 and in rodents3–5. However, the specific
role of rodent parietal cortex, and whether its function is
homologous to that of primates, remains unclear. While rodent
PPC plays a minimal role in simple auditory6 and whisker-based7
decision tasks (but see8), multiple groups have demonstrated that
it is causally necessary for make decisions on the basis of visual
stimuli3,4,9,10.
However, the specific role of PPC in visual decision-making
remains unclear. Some argue that rodent PPC may ultimately be
more homologous to extrastriate cortex in processing sensory
signals that are accumulated elsewhere for decision-making10.
Indeed, both anatomical projection studies11,12, as well as func-
tional mapping studies13,14 indicate that PPC may overlap with or
contain a group of retinotopically-organized extrastriate areas
that are rostral to primary visual cortex (V1). Others suggest that
PPC reflects internal biases related to the value of past stimuli8 or
actions9. However, removal of internal biases cannot fully explain
the decision-making deficits induced by inactivation of PPC
during visual decision tasks3,4,10. A third, alternative possibility is
that PPC may play a role in the mapping of visual stimuli to
motor commands. If this were the case, one may expect that
activity in PPC would be highly task-dependent, reflecting the
animal’s
decision
depending
on
learned
sensorimotor
contingencies.
Here, we use population calcium imaging to investigate these
possibilities by measuring activity in PPC and in V1 during a go/
no-go lick-based visual discrimination task. Having previously
demonstrated the necessity of PPC in the performance of this
task3, we seek in this work to investigate its specific role in either
sensory processing or sensorimotor transformation by manip-
ulating task engagement and learned task contingencies. V1
neurons exhibit robust visual responses during both task
engagement and passive viewing of stimuli that remain stable
after task contingency reversal. By contrast, PPC responses are
largely specific to task performance and reflect the animal’s choice
before and after task contingency reversal. Our results are con-
sistent with a role of the mouse posterior parietal cortex in
transforming visual information to motor commands during
perceptual decisions.
Results
Imaging V1 and PPC during task performance and passive
viewing. We trained mice on a head-fixed lick/no-lick visual
discrimination task (Fig. 1a, b), similar to previous designs3,15,16.
Water-restricted mice discriminated between a target stimulus
(horizontal grating drifting upwards, 0° from vertical, Stimulus A)
which was rewarded with water, and a non-target stimulus of an
orthogonal orientation (vertical drifting upwards rightwards, 90°,
Stimulus B). Lick responses to the non-target grating were dis-
couraged by punishment with a small, aversive drop of quinine.
Quinine concentrations were chosen to discourage licking to non-
targets, but without inducing long-lasting changes in motivation
on subsequent trials (Supplementary Fig. 1). A retractable lick
spout was presented immediately after stimulus presentation (2 s)
and retracted on every trial. This restricted the animal’s lick
response to the “response” period (1.5 s) and allowed us to
separately assess perception and action (Fig. 1b). Video recording
of the mice during the stimulus period confirmed that mice
withheld licking until the spout became available during the
response epoch3. Mice (n = 15) achieved high levels of perfor-
mance on the task (Fig. 1c; d-prime or d', 2.23 ± 0.18; mean ±
SEM), with a bias towards licking, resulting in more false alarms
than misses.
We have previously demonstrated using a version of this task
with a 4 s delay period that inactivation of either V1 or PPC
during the stimulus period disrupts behavioral performance,
whereas inactivation during later periods has no effect3. Stimulus-
period activity in PPC is therefore necessary for the task, but it is
unclear whether such activity is important for sensory processing,
attentional engagement, decision formation, or motor planning.
To help distinguish between these possibilities, we measured
neural activity in PPC and V1 under two different conditions:
engagement in the behavioral task as well as passive viewing of
the same visual stimuli (Fig. 1b). While “task engagement” may
not be able to fully separate various non-sensory signals, we
reasoned that this approach could allow us to identify pure
sensory responses that were robust during both passive and
engaged conditions.
We used two-photon microscopy and a volumetric imaging
approach to image hundreds of neurons simultaneously in either
V1 or PPC (see “Methods” section). After behavioral training, we
injected AAV2/1 syn-GCaMP6s17 into the two areas under
stereotaxic guidance. We used a resonant scanning system
combined with a z-piezo to concurrently record activity from
several hundreds of GCaMP6-infected cells within layer 2/3 in a
volume comprising four planes (850 × 850 µm) 20 µm apart in
depth, at an overall stack rate of 5 Hz. Images were corrected for
X–Y movement, and fluorescence traces were extracted from
semi-automatically generated ROIs based on a pixel-wise activity
map (see “Methods” section).
To investigate the effects of behavioral performance on neural
responses, we imaged the same neurons in alternating blocks
(5–10 min, 40–80 trials) of engaged behavior and passive viewing
(Fig. 1b). During “engaged” behavior trials, the spout was
extended on each trial during the response period. During
“passive” trials, the spout was not extended during the response
period but remained withdrawn and inaccessible from the animal.
To avoid extraneous stimulus confounds, no additional cue was
provided to signal engaged or passive blocks. Nonetheless, mice
rapidly became aware after the first 1–2 trials of a block whether
the spout would be available for a behavioral response, as
confirmed in video recordings by the complete lack of licking
during passive blocks. Discrimination performance was similarly
high for both the first and subsequent engaged blocks.
We imaged from an average of 606 cells (range: 257–1057) in
each population within either V1 or PPC, of which an average
135 cells (range: 21–364) exhibited significant task-related
responses. Pilot experiments using transgenic mice with tdTo-
mato expressed in PV + and SOM + interneurons revealed that
calcium signals from these neurons were generally too weak to be
measured with volume scanning, and therefore the vast majority
of task-responsive cells were likely to be excitatory pyramidal
neurons3. We first analyzed only the neural responses measured
during correct Engaged trials (ignoring error trials), or during
Passive viewing. In V1, many neurons showed a robust and
reliable response to either the target or non-target stimulus,
though some were modulated by engagement in the task. For
example, one target-preferring cell showed a reliable passive
response to the target stimulus that was moderately enhanced
during task performance (Fig. 1d, left). A non-target preferring
cell, however, exhibited a suppressed response during engagement
in the task (Fig. 1d, right). By contrast, PPC neurons exhibited

 much stronger responses during task engagement compared to
passive viewing, specifically for target stimuli. For example, one
target-preferring cell had robust activity only during engagement
(Fig. 1e, left), whereas another cell showed relatively weak passive
responses that became stronger during task performance (Fig. 1e,
right).
Responses are visually-driven in V1 but task-gated in PPC. To
compare the overall response properties of V1 and PPC, we
analyzed the responses of all neurons that had significant
stimulus-period activity during the task. We focused on stimulus-
period responses given that inactivation during this period dis-
rupts behavioral performance3. A total of 1915 neurons (18% of
all neurons, 18 fields, 9 mice) in V1 (Fig. 2a, b) and 3524 neurons
(26% of all neurons, 22 fields, 10 mice) in PPC (Fig. 2c, d) were
significantly responsive during the task. Two striking differences
between V1 and PPC were immediately apparent when examin-
ing the trial-averaged responses. First, while V1 was about evenly
split between target- and nontarget-preferring cells (60.6% ± 5.8%
target-preferring, Fig. 2e), there was a stronger bias in PPC
towards the target stimulus (87.6% ± 7.4% target-preferring; V1
vs. PPC, p = 4.68 × 10−5, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Secondly,
while most task-responsive V1 neurons also responded during
passive viewing (88.3% ± 6.8% with significant passive response,
Fig. 2f), the majority of PPC neurons had responses that were
gated by task engagement (only 29.7% ± 10.3% with significant
passive response; V1 vs. PPC, p = 4.71 × 10−7, Wilcoxon rank-
sum test).
The dramatic effect of task engagement on PPC responses
could also be observed by comparing the selectivity of responses
during Passive and Engaged conditions (Fig. 2g). We quantified
selectivity using an ROC-based index that ranged from −1 to 1,
with positive values indicating preference for the target stimulus
(see “Methods” section for details). V1 had a large proportion of
significantly selective (p < 0.05, permutation test) neurons in
Passive conditions (85.3% ± 3.8% of cells), with a small but
significant increase in Engaged conditions (91.8% ± 2.5% of cells;
Passive vs. Engaged, p = 4.97 × 10−3, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
By contrast, PPC neurons were largely unselective during Passive

Fig 1 Imaging calcium responses in V1 and PPC during engaged task performance and passive viewing. a Head-fixed mice were trained to perform a go, no-
go lick-based visual discrimination task. A retractable lick spout was used to restrict lick responses to a specific epoch of the task. Licks following a target
stimulus (red, horizontal drifting upwards, Stimulus A) were rewarded with water, while licks to non-target stimulus (blue, vertical drifting rightwards,
Stimulus B) were punished with quinine. b Trial structure for Engaged and Passive conditions. After a brief auditory preparatory cue, a drifting grating was
presented for 2 s. During Engaged trials, the retractable lick spout was presented immediately after stimulus offset for a minimum of 1.5 s. During Passive
trials, the spout was inaccessible. Engaged and Passive trials were presented in blocks, which were usually interleaved. c Rate of licking on target (T, red)

 conditions (41.9% ± 10.8% selective), and yet became significantly
selective to target trials during task engagement (89.5% ± 4.7% of
cells; Passive vs. Engaged, p = 5.95 × 10−5, Wilcoxon signed-rank
test). We also quantified the change in responses for engagement
vs. passive viewing for each neuron using an engagement
modulation index (Fig. 2h), which also ranged from −1 to 1,
with positive values indicating increases with engagement. The
mean modulation index was significantly above zero for target-
preferring neurons in both V1 (0.227 ± 0.009, n = 1148; p < 5.0 ×
10−4, permutation test, 2000 permutations) and PPC (0.351 ±
0.004, n = 3292; p < 5.0 × 10−4). Nontarget-preferring neurons in
V1 showed weaker modulation (modulation index: 0.059 ± 0.010
for
non-target,
n = 767)
than
target-preferring
neurons
(p = 9.07 × 10−4, clustered Wilcoxon rank-sum test), indicating
that the effect of engagement was stimulus-specific.
Comparing responses during engaged behavior and passive
viewing therefore revealed different response properties in V1
and PPC. In V1, task engagement did not merely increase overall
responsiveness (as would be expected with arousal), but instead
modulated firing rates to enhance the contrast between target and
non-target stimuli. By contrast, PPC responses were strongly
target-selective and gated by behavior (Fig. 2). Furthermore,
because this activity is selective to target trials in which the animal
licks, PPC responses likely signal some aspect of the animal’s
choice (decision formation or motor planning), instead of simply
reflecting overall increases in arousal or attention during task
engagement. A subset (~30%) of PPC neurons, however, do have
significant passive responses, and could play a role in sensory
processing.
Error trials reveal sensitivity of PPC to both stimulus and
choice. How should one interpret this target-selective task
engagement signal in PPC? One possibility is that PPC encodes a
stimulus-specific signal that is perhaps boosted by task engage-
ment. An alternative is that PPC activity reflects movement or
action planning, since the animal licks on Engaged target (Hit)
trials but not on Passive trials or Engaged nontarget (CR) trials.
To help disambiguate these possibilities, we analyzed the
responses of V1 and PPC neurons on error trials. We compared
activity in different behavioral or sensory conditions using single-
neuron ROC analysis to isolate stimulus-specific signals from
those related to the choice (Supplementary Table 1). Due to the
difficulty in distinguishing between motor preparation and
decision-related signals with our go/no-go paradigm, we define
“choice” selectivity broadly as any premotor signal related to
behavioral output independent of the stimulus. We focused on
target-preferring neurons, as these represented the vast majority
of responses in PPC, and restricted analysis to those imaging
fields and behavioral sessions in which the mouse committed at

 least five False Alarm (FA) trials (V1, n = 1053 cells from 16
fields; PPC, n = 3034 cells from 21 fields).
For V1, individual target-preferring neurons varied in their
responsiveness on nontarget trials (Fig. 3a, left), but the average
strength of the nontarget response was similar on FA trials
compared to CR trials (Fig. 3b, left). By contrast, PPC neurons
invariably showed stronger responses on FA vs. CR trials (Fig. 3a,
b, right), indicating the presence of choice-related signals. This
modulation was strongest during the response period, though still
apparent in the stimulus period before any licks or punishment
occurred. We quantified the selectivity of each neuron’s stimulus-
period response using an ROC-based index to compare trial types
(Fig. 3c). Target-preferring V1 neurons exhibited strong selectiv-
ity for Hit compared to either CR or FA trials (Hit vs. FA, 0.605 ±
0.009, p = 1.3 × 10−4, clustered Wilcoxon signed-rank test), but
weak modulation for FA vs. CR trials (0.014 ± 0.006, p = 0.462).
On the other hand, PPC neurons showed significant selectivity for
FA vs. CR trials (0.109 ± 0.003, p = 0.014), as well as selectivity
for Hit compared to FA trials (0.348 ± 0.004, p = 6.1 × 10−5).
We also performed a time-dependent ROC analysis3,18,19 to
examine the dynamics of stimulus- and choice-related signals
over the course of a trial. We quantified both the average
selectivity (Fig. 3d) as well as the fraction of selective neurons
(Fig. 3e) for each area as a function of time. While both areas
exhibited significant stimulus-related selectivity (Hit vs. FA)
shortly after stimulus onset (p < 0.05 starting at t = 0.2 s for both
areas, clustered Wilcoxon signed-rank test), only PPC exhibited
any significant choice-related selectivity (FA vs. CR) in the
stimulus period. The onset of choice selectivity was delayed (p <
0.05 starting at t = 0.8 s) compared to the stimulus signals and
peaked during the response period. By contrast, choice-related
selectivity in V1 did not become significant until the response
period (p < 0.05 starting at 2.4 s).
These analyses suggest that PPC, unlike V1, is sensitive to both
the stimulus and the impending choice of the animal. However,
the comparison of Hit and FA trials to compute stimulus
selectivity may be confounded by overt differences in motor
output (see lick rate in Fig. 3b) or by covert differences in motor
preparation. Could PPC activity be entirely explained by motor or
choice-related signals?
While we cannot rule out covert preparatory effects, in a subset
of sessions we eliminated differences in motor output by selecting
Hit and FA trials with the same number of licks (Supplementary
Fig. 2a, b). PPC responses in these sessions (n = 846 cells across
3 sessions) still exhibited stimulus selectivity (0.229 ± 0.004), as
well as some motor-related sensitivity (0.130 ± 0.009) when
comparing FA trials with different numbers of licks (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2c-e). We also analyzed the responses of neurons on
Miss trials, in which there is no motor output and presumably no
motor preparation, using the subset of sessions with sufficient

 number of trials (n = 1165 cells across 8 sessions for PPC).
Interestingly, we found that a large fraction of PPC neurons
exhibited strong responses on Miss trials that were never
apparent on CR trials (Supplementary Fig. 3; Miss vs. CR:
0.305 ± 0.010) or even on passively-presented Target trials.
Together, these data argue that PPC responses cannot be
parsimoniously explained as encoding purely motor- related
signals.
GLM reveals multiplexed sensory and motor signals in PPC.
We further used a generalized linear model (GLM)20–22 to dis-
ambiguate the contributions of stimulus, task engagement, and
motor action on single neuron calcium responses across both
Passive and Engaged conditions. Responses of each V1 and PPC
cell were modeled (see “Methods” section) as a linear combina-
tion of components that were time-locked to stimulus presenta-
tion or licking onset (Fig. 4). We quantified the performance of
the GLM as the proportion of variance explained (R2) for a
separate test dataset not used for fitting (Fig. 4e). Using all
significantly task-responsive neurons, the average model perfor-
mance was higher for V1 (0.334 ± 0.005, n = 1915 cells) than for
PPC (0.190 ± 0.003, n = 3524; V1 vs. PPC, p = 4.01 × 10−5,
clustered Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
We then assessed the relative contribution of stimulus,
engagement, and motor model components for cells in each
area, and illustrate the performance of the model on a few
examples (Fig. 4a–d). Most V1 cells exhibited a strong stimulus
component
(0.494 ± 0.013,
component
of
z-scored
calcium
response, see “Methods” section), which reflected sensory drive
on Passive trials, whether the neuron preferred the target (Fig. 4a)
or the nontarget (Fig. 4b) stimulus. By contrast, PPC neurons had
much weaker stimulus components (Fig. 4f, left; 0.117 ± 0.013; V1
vs. PPC, p = 6.84 × 10−5, clustered Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The
engagement component of the GLM-reflected stimulus-specific
signals that occurred exclusively on Engaged trials. This could be
disambiguated from the stimulus-independent motor component,
which would be present on both Hit and False Alarm (FA) trials.

 engagement and motor components (Fig. 4c, d), but on average
PPC cells exhibited a slightly (but not significantly) stronger
engagement component (Fig. 4f, middle; V1, 0.183 ± 0.009; PPC,
0.233 ± 0.006; V1 vs. PPC, p = 0.144, clustered Wilcoxon rank-
sum test) and a much stronger motor component (Fig. 4f, right;
V1, 0.155 ± 0.005; PPC, 0.371 ± 0.005; V1 vs. PPC, p = 0.015,
clustered Wilcoxon rank-sum test) as compared to V1 cells.
Linear models that consider the stimulus, task context, and
licking together can explain some of the variance in calcium
responses. But could even simpler models be sufficient? For each
cell, we trained three additional partial models: a stimulus-only
model, a motor-only model, and a stimulus + engagement model
that was insensitive to the motor response (Supplementary Fig. 4).
For V1 cells, the stimulus-only model performed nearly as well as
the full model (median relative R2: 0.905), but the motor-only
model performed quite poorly (median relative R2: 0.156). For the
majority of V1 neurons, the stimulus + engagement model
(which excluded licking terms) performed just as well as the full
model (median relative R2: 0.995; only 15.9% ± 5.3% of cells with
worse fit). By contrast, while PPC neurons were better explained
by the motor-only model (median relative R2: 0.809) than by the
stimulus-only model (median relative R2: 0.353), both models
performed significantly worse than the full model for the majority
of neurons (81.9% ± 6.2% of cells for stim-only, 55.9% ± 11.3% for
motor-only). PPC neurons were reasonably well-explained by a
stimulus + engagement model (median relative R2: 0.910) but a
large proportion of cells still exhibited worse fits compared to the
full model (34.1 ± 10.7% of cells with worse fit). These results add
further evidence that PPC encodes a combination of sensory and
motor signals.
PPC reflects both stimulus contrast and behavioral state. Pre-
vious work has shown that in both primates1,2 and rats23, neu-
rons in PPC encode not only the choice of the animal but also the
amount of sensory evidence for that decision. To test whether
neurons in mouse PPC similarly reflected the decision process, we
varied the amount of sensory evidence from trial-to-trial by
manipulating stimulus contrast. We also compared responses
during engaged and passive conditions to examine how sensory
and motor signals may be combined in PPC responses.
A subset of the mice (n = 6) were trained to perform a variant
of the discrimination task, in which the contrast of the grating
stimulus varied randomly from trial-to-trial (Fig. 5a). Mice

 performed well above chance, even at very low contrasts (d' at 2%
contrast, 1.05 ± 0.25; p = 0.031, Wilcoxon signed-rank test),
although performance degraded as contrast was lowered (p =
1.10 × 10−4, Friedman test) reflecting the decrease in the strength
of sensory evidence (Fig. 5b). We imaged from neurons in V1
(n = 8 fields, 3 mice) and PPC (n = 11 fields, 6 mice) and
computed contrast-response functions for both passive and
engaged conditions. We again focused our analysis on target-
preferring neurons (V1, n = 250; PPC, n = 611), which con-
stituted the vast majority of task-responsive PPC neurons (95% in
this dataset). Neurons were included for further analysis if they
demonstrated significant Hit responses at multiple contrasts that
could be well fit with a hyperbolic ratio function24 (see “Methods”
section).
As in the single-contrast task, the population response in V1
during the variable contrast task was robust in both Engaged and
Passive conditions (Fig. 5c), with most neurons showing a
significant response to at least one contrast during both
conditions (68.9% ± 11.8% of cells). Conversely, PPC population
activity was more robust in Engaged vs. Passive conditions
(Fig. 5d), with only a subset of PPC neurons showing significant
passive responses (27.8% ± 14.9%; V1 vs. PPC, p = 7.59 × 10−3,
Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The modulation of PPC activity by
contrast cannot be explained by changes in motor behavior, as
lick rate was unchanged as a function of contrast (Supplementary
Fig. 5a).
We quantified the strength of modulation by contrast and
engagement for each neuron using ROC-based indices that
ranged from −1 to 1 (Fig. 5e–h). Engagement modulation index
was similarly high in V1 and PPC (Fig. 5e, f; V1, 0.149 ± 0.019;
PPC, 0.222 ± 0.008; V1 vs. PPC, p = 0.209, clustered Wilcoxon
rank-sum test), but modulation by contrast was stronger on
average in V1 compared to PPC (Fig. 5g, h; V1, 0.487 ± 0.027;
PPC, 0.233 ± 0.009; V1 vs. PPC, p = 0.021, clustered Wilcoxon
rank-sum test). Nonetheless, the mean contrast modulation index
in PPC was significantly greater than zero (p = 4.86 × 10−3,
clustered Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
We also analyzed the error trials to see whether stimulus and
choice signals could be separately extracted from responses in
PPC, and whether these signals depended on contrast (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5). We compared False Alarm trials with Hit and
Correct Reject trials, using imaging fields and sessions with at
least five False Alarm trials at each contrast (7 of 11 fields,
n = 391 neurons). We did not make comparisons with Miss trials
given the low number of trials. The population response on FA
trials was weak, but distinguishable from the response on CR
trials (Supplementary Fig. 5a), especially during the response
period (Supplementary Fig. 5b; FA greater than CR for all
contrasts, p < 0.05, clustered Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Using
an ROC-based approach, we again found that PPC encoded both
stimulus and choice with differing time courses (Supplementary
Fig. 5e; stimulus selectivity significant from 1.0 to 6.6 s for all
contrasts, choice selectivity significant from 2.2 to 5.6 s for all
contrasts, clustered Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Interestingly,
some PPC cells encoded the stimulus in a contrast-dependent
manner, but also encoded the choice in a contrast-independent
manner (Supplementary Fig. 5c). We quantified the contrast-
dependence of the selectivity index for each neuron by measuring
its slope as a function of contrast (Supplementary Fig. 5d). A
larger proportion of neurons exhibited significant contrast-
dependence in stimulus selectivity (Supplementary Fig. 5f,
23.6% ± 19.9% of cells) compared to the proportion with
significant contrast-dependence in choice selectivity (2.4% ±
1.6%). PPC may therefore simultaneously encode both contrast-
dependent sensory signals and contrast-independent motor
signals in the same population of neurons.
Heterogeneous PPC responses to contrast and engagement.
PPC is on average modulated by both engagement and stimulus
contrast, but closer examination of the individual PPC contrast-
response functions revealed a great deal of heterogeneity. We
therefore divided neurons into groups based on whether they
exhibited significant modulation by contrast and/or engagement
(Fig. 6a, b). A subset of PPC neurons (21.2% ± 13.5% of cells)
showed strong modulation by contrast, but very weak modulation
by engagement (Fig. 6c, d, left column). Such neurons therefore
faithfully represented the sensory stimulus regardless of beha-
vioral state. Conversely, a larger group of PPC neurons (28.1% ±
12.3%) were gated by task engagement but showed little to no
modulation with contrast (Fig. 6c, d, middle column). These
neurons reflected the behavioral state and impending action of
the animal irrespective of sensory drive. Lastly, a third subset of
PPC neurons (28.2% ± 10.6%) were significantly modulated by
both contrast and engagement (Fig. 6c, d, right column). PPC
therefore appears to contain both contrast-modulated “sensory”
neurons as well as engagement-modulated “motor” neurons. This
differs qualitatively from V1 (Fig. 6a, left; p = 7.10 × 10−17, χ2 test
of independence, see also Supplementary Fig. 6), where most
neurons (74.8% ± 7.0%) are modulated by contrast, and much
fewer by engagement alone (9.2% ± 7.1%).
We then considered whether there was any anatomical
organization of these functional properties within PPC. For each
imaged PPC volume, functional subpopulations of contrast-
modulated and engagement-modulated cells appeared to be
intermingled across space (Fig. 6e). We computed the pairwise
distance between all target-preferring neurons, and found no
significant difference between within-group and across-group
distances (Fig. 6f; within-group, 268 ± 5 µm; across-group 273 ± 5
µm; p = 0.102, clustered Wilcoxon signed-rank test). We also
compared the functional properties of pairs of neurons as a
function of distance, and found that the difference in contrast
modulation or engagement modulation did not depend on
distance (Fig. 6g; Pearson’s correlation with distance, difference in
contrast modulation index, r = 0.003, p = 0.660; difference in
engagement modulation index, r = 0.001, p = 0.960). Therefore,
PPC contains neurons with diverse visuomotor response proper-
ties that are spatially intermingled.
PPC
reflects
choice
independent
of
stimulus-reward
contingency. Most PPC neurons respond exclusively during
target trials, while a smaller subset of neurons encode the sensory
stimulus in a contrast-dependent manner. Error and GLM ana-
lyses suggest that these PPC populations encode choice and sti-
mulus, respectively. However, because errors can reflect other
factors such as impulsivity or inattention and thus be difficult to
interpret, a more conclusive demonstration would require a clear
dissociation of stimulus and choice. We therefore manipulated
the stimulus-reward structure of the task and re-trained mice on a
reversed sensorimotor contingency. By measuring activity from
the same cells before and after reversal, we could test whether
individual V1 and PPC neurons were more sensitive to stimulus
identity or to the animal’s choice.
After imaging the responses of neurons in V1 and PPC in the
original go/no-go task, we reversed the reward contingencies of
the stimuli (Fig. 7a). Licking in response to the original non-
target stimulus (Stimulus B) was now rewarded with water,
whereas licking to Stimulus A was punished with quinine. Three
mice successfully learned the task after 7–11 days of training,
although performance was slightly worse than before (Fig. 7b; d-
prime, original, 2.96 ± 0.50; reversed, 1.51 ± 0.22). We then
measured responses from the same populations of neurons in
V1 and in PPC under the reversed reward contingency, and

 identified the same neurons across imaging sessions using a semi-
automated procedure25 (see "Methods" section for details).
We analyzed the trial selectivity of individual neurons that had
significant responses both before and after reversal (V1, n = 488
cells, 8 fields in 3 mice; PPC, n = 509 cells, 8 fields in 3 mice).

remained selective to the same stimulus after reversal, whether

 neurons did not exhibit stable stimulus selectivity, but instead
appeared to track the animal’s choice. These neurons preferred
target stimulus A before reversal while preferring new target
stimulus B after reversal (Fig. 7d). This strongly suggests that PPC
neurons
encode
choice-related
signals
related
to
decision
formation or motor planning.
Looking at the whole population, we measured the selectivity of
neurons to Stimulus A trials before and after reversal. Stable
selectivity would indicate sensory signals, whereas changes in this
measurement would reflect signals related to choice. We found
that V1 selectivity did not change significantly after reversal
(Fig. 7e, before, 0.161 ± 0.034; after, 0.095 ± 0.030; p = 0.256,
clustered Wilcoxon signed-rank test), with a relatively symme-
trical distribution of neurons selective to either stimulus A or B.
However, in PPC, this selectivity measure was dramatically
altered with reversal of reward contingency (before, 0.513 ± 0.013;
after,
−0.373 ± 0.013;
p = 4.15 × 10−3,
clustered
Wilcoxon
signed-rank test), with the majority of responsive neurons
preferring the new target stimulus B after reversal.
We also compared the selectivity of individual neurons before
and after reversal using a scatter plot (Fig. 7g, h). Purely stimulus-
selective neurons will remain close to the unity line and in the
first (bottom-left) and third (top-right) quadrants, whereas
choice-selective neurons will lie in either the second quadrant
(top-left; for no-go selective cells) or the fourth quadrant
(bottom-right; for go-selective cells). V1 neurons were strongly
stimulus-selective, with the majority (74.3% ± 5.2% of cells,
Fig. 8a, top) of neurons lying within the first and third quadrants
(Fig. 7g). By contrast, the majority (66.8% ± 13.0% of cells, Fig. 8a,
bottom) of PPC neurons were found in the fourth quadrant,
indicating
a
preference for
the rewarded
target stimulus,
regardless of its actual identity (Fig. 7h). These results indicate
that the majority of PPC neurons reflected the choice of the
animal.
Task contingency reversal reveals distinct PPC subpopulations.
A small subset of PPC neurons (6.9% ± 3.7%) did show stable
stimulus selectivity before and after reversal. If PPC includes
distinct populations of “stimulus” neurons and “choice” neurons,
we hypothesized that they could be distinguished based on their
responses on passive and error trials. Stimulus selectivity after
reversal should be predictive of modulation strength with
engagement and choice: with “stimulus” neurons showing robust
passive responses and weak modulation by engagement and
errors, and “choice” neurons expressing strong engagement and
error modulation.

 To
test
this
hypothesis,
we
measured
the
strength
of
engagement modulation in both stimulus-selective (to either
Stimulus A or B) neurons and go-selective neurons, as defined by
their selectivity before and after reversal (Fig. 8a). We found that
go-selective PPC neurons had higher (near significant) modula-
tion by engagement than stimulus-selective neurons (go-selective,
0.393 ± 0.007; stimulus-selective, 0.084 ± 0.040; p = 0.065, clus-
tered Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 8b, bottom). Indeed, many
PPC neurons that maintained selectivity to Stimulus A after
reversal also had strong passive responses (Fig. 8d), and many
neurons
with
reversed
selectivity
were
strongly
gated
by
engagement (Fig. 8e). We also tested to see whether a PPC
neuron’s responses on error trials related to its selectivity after
reversal. Go-selective PPC neurons had significantly higher error
modulation (computed by comparing False Alarm trials to
Correct Reject trials) compared to stimulus-selective neurons
(go-selective,
0.273 ± 0.009;
stimulus-selective,
0.019 ± 0.019;
p = 0.040, clustered Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 8c). Interest-
ingly, the small subset of go-selective neurons in V1 (5.9% ± 2.1%
of cells) also differed from stimulus-selective V1 neurons in their
degree of engagement (Fig. 8b, top, p = 0.016) and error (Fig. 8c,
top, p = 0.021) modulation, suggesting that these different
properties are strongly related and can be used to distinguish
functional cell types across different areas.
These findings demonstrate distinct subsets of neurons within
PPC. One subset of neurons faithfully reflects the sensory input,
both in passive conditions and after learning a new reward
contingency. The larger proportion of PPC neurons, however,
track the choice before and after re-training, and are strongly
modulated by task engagement. The flexibility and heterogeneity
of PPC responses suggests a role for PPC in the mapping of
sensory inputs onto appropriate motor actions.
Discussion
We developed a simple head-fixed visual decision task for mice
with separate stimulus and response epochs, and used population
imaging of single neuron responses to investigate the role of PPC
in perceptual decisions. Our key findings are that PPC encodes
both sensory and motor signals across a heterogeneous pool of
neurons, and that its activity reflects task performance and
demands. Together these results suggest that mouse PPC is
responsible for neither pure sensory processing, nor for the
control of motor output, but rather is important for the decision
process itself – the process of mapping sensation to action.
The small size of the mouse brain has made it difficult to
identify precise borders between different functional areas. PPC
in the rodent, as classically defined by its thalamic inputs26, is
located in the region between anterior to V1 and posterior to
somatosensory cortex. However, this location is essentially where
both anatomical11,12 and functional13,14 mapping studies have
identified the retinotopically-organized areas RL, A, and AM. The
degree to which PPC overlaps with these secondary visual areas is
a matter of debate. Some have argued that rodent PPC may have
more in common with primate extrastriate cortex, given that
inactivation specifically disrupts sensitivity on visual decisions10.
Indeed, the stereotaxic coordinates used by us3 and others4,27 to
target mouse PPC most directly overlap with area AM, which
exhibits directionally-tuned responses even under anesthesia14.
But is PPC simply a sensory visual area?
We have presented multiple pieces of evidence that point to a
role for PPC beyond mere sensory processing. First, activity in
PPC is strongly dependent on behavioral state, with only a
minority of task-responsive PPC neurons exhibiting significant
responses during passive viewing of stimuli (Fig. 2f). Secondly,
the selectivity of PPC neurons is strongly biased toward target
stimuli (Fig. 2e). This bias is likely due to the asymmetry of the
Go/No-go paradigm, and may reflect a learned association of
stimulus and reward28. Third, PPC responses are modulated
during error trials (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 5). Information
about the eventual choice of the animal can be decoded from the
activity of PPC, as previously shown in both mice3,4 and rats5.
Finally, and most conclusively, the biased selectivity of most PPC
neurons towards target stimuli is dramatically reversed when the
animal is retrained on a different reward contingency (Fig. 7).
Together, these results demonstrate that the stimulus-period
responses in PPC are task-dependent and not purely sensory.
Alternatively, one may argue that the activity patterns we
observed in PPC can be most parsimoniously explained as
movement
or
motor-planning
related
signals.
After
all,
movement-related
activity
would
be
present
only
during
engagement, it would exhibit choice selectivity, and it would
change with reward contingency. It is unlikely that PPC is directly
involved in executing motor plans, as we have previously shown
that optogenetic inactivation of PPC during the response period,
or even during the delay between stimulus and response, has no
effect on behavior3. However, the possibility remains that the
PPC responses recorded in our task reflect planning- or
movement-related signals that originate elsewhere. Although
some PPC neurons (~30%) do show activity that appears motor-
related, due to their contrast-independent nature (Fig. 6), we
provide evidence that PPC is not a purely motor (or motor-
planning) area either.
First, passive visual stimulation does induce a response in some
PPC neurons (~20%), as previously shown in parietal area AM of
anesthetized mice14. This subset of neurons tends to stably reflect
the stimulus even with changes in reward contingency (Fig. 8).
Second, we find a subset of PPC neurons that reflect the target
stimulus on Miss trials when the animal fails to lick, even though
such neurons are inactive during Correct Reject trials (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). Finally, the responses of many PPC neurons
(~40%) shows modulation with stimulus contrast, even for the
same decision and motor output (Fig. 6). This is reminiscent of
previous primate2 and rodent23 PPC studies, where it has been
shown that responses vary with the strength of incoming sensory
evidence. These findings cohere with prior work in a delayed-
response version of our task3, in which choice-related selectivity
was highest shortly after stimulus presentation and became
weaker over the course of the trial. This argues against a motor-
planning explanation which would instead predict increased
choice coding with time.
In every task condition reported here, PPC responses were
heterogeneous. A subset of PPC neurons have significant passive
visual responses (~30%, Fig. 2f, E + P) and are modulated by
contrast in both engaged and passive conditions (~20%, Fig. 6a,
contrast). These neurons maintain their stimulus selectivity even
after reversal of reward contingency (~10%, Fig. 8a, Stim). These
“stimulus” neurons are spatially intermingled with the larger
proportion of “choice” neurons that have task-gated responses
(~70%, Fig. 2f, E only), weak contrast modulation (~30%, Fig. 6a,
engagement), and choice-selective responses after contingency
reversal (~70%, Fig. 8a, Go). Furthermore, a third group of
neurons have multiplexed selectivity to stimulus, engagement,
and motor signals, exhibiting complex responses to combinations
of sensory or motor signals in engaged conditions. These cells
exhibit modulation to both contrast and engagement (~30%,
Fig. 6a, both) and their responses cannot be explained by partial
GLM models that only use a subset of the task variables (~35%,
Supplementary Fig. 4f).
Heterogeneous response properties have been previously
reported in both primate29,30 and rodent5,31 PPC during decision
tasks. Our work adds to this literature, and additionally provides

 evidence that such heterogeneous responses exist in a spatially
intermingled fashion within PPC of the mouse32,33. Do these
response types form bona-fide cell classes or does PPC represent a
category-free population, as others have proposed5? Although we
do find that various properties (such as modulation by engage-
ment, contrast, and reversal) are correlated with one another,
more work needs to be done to determine whether functional
neuronal subgroups are truly separable.
Recent studies in rodents have suggested that some of the
heterogeneity observed in PPC responses may be due to encoding
of information from recent experience, including information
about past sensory stimuli8, previous choices9,27, and the presence
or absence of reward. Such information about history could bias
performance on sensorimotor tasks by providing animals with
prior expectations about the value of particular stimuli8 or
actions9. While our findings do not allow us to directly address
history-dependent biases in action selection, they are consistent
with a role for PPC in selecting future motor actions.
Our results build on previous work in the field in several ways:
First, we show that PPC neurons are actively gated by engage-
ment in a sensorimotor task, with a substantial subpopulation of
neurons exhibiting sensory responses only during task perfor-
mance. Second, we used analysis of variable contrast stimuli and a
GLM model to delineate the relative contributions of stimulus,
motor preparation, and engagement to the responses of both V1
and PPC. These analyses showed that visual and motor signals are
multiplexed within individual neurons. Finally, we showed that
reversing reward contingencies causes the response selectivity to
swap for the vast majority of PPC cells, indicating that the
multiplexing of stimulus and response can be flexibly mapped
depending on task contingencies. Taken together, these results
bolster the evidence that PPC neurons are capable of mediating
visuomotor transformations, although further evidence is neces-
sary to establish this possibility conclusively.
The mouse posterior parietal cortex encodes behaviorally-
relevant variables in a highly task-dependent manner, in analogy
to prior work in primates. Our understanding of how decisions
are computed and visuomotor transformations are made will be
greatly aided by future circuit-level analyses of PPC function in
this powerful model system34.
Methods
Mice and surgery. All experiments were carried out in mice of either sex using
protocols approved by Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Animal Care and
Use Committee and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Data
were collected from adult (3–5 months old) wild-type (C57BL/6; n = 15) mice of
either sex. The animals were housed on a 12-hour light/dark cycle in cages of up to
5 animals before the implants, and individually after the implants. All surgeries
were conducted under isoflurane anesthesia (3.5% induction, 1.5–2.5% main-
tenance). Meloxicam (1 mg kg−1, subcutaneous) was administered pre-operatively
and every 24 h for 3 days to reduce inflammation. Once anesthetized, the scalp
overlying the dorsal skull was sanitized and removed. The periosteum was removed
with a scalpel and the skull was abraded with a drill burr to improve adhesion of
dental acrylic. Stereotaxic coordinates for future viral injections were marked with a
non-toxic ink and covered with a layer of silicon elastomer (Kwik-Sil, World
Precision Instruments) to prevent acrylic bonding. The entire skull surface was
then covered with dental acrylic (C&B-Metabond, Parkell) mixed with black ink to
reduce light transmission. A custom-designed stainless-steel head plate (eMachi-
neShop.com) was then affixed using dental acrylic. After head plate implantation,
mice recovered for at least 5 days before beginning water restriction.
After behavioral training was complete, animals were taken off water restriction
for 5 days before undergoing a second surgery to implant the imaging window.
Procedures for anesthetic administration and post-operative care were identical to
the first surgery. The dental acrylic and silicon elastomer covering the targeted
region were removed using a drill burr. The skull surface was then cleaned and a
craniotomy was performed over left V1/PPC, leaving the dura intact. Neurons were
labeled with a genetically-encoded calcium indicator by microinjection (Stoelting)
of 50 nl AAV2/1.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (University of Pennsylvania Vector
Core; diluted to a titer of 1012 genomes ml−1) 300 µm below the pial surface.
Between two and five injections were made in each exposed region, centered at V1
(4.2 mm posterior, 2.5 mm lateral to Bregma) and PPC (2 mm posterior, 1.7 mm
lateral to Bregma). Since the viral expression spreads laterally from the injection
site, exact stereotaxic locations were photographed through the surgical microscope
for determining imaging areas. Finally, a cranial window was implanted over the
craniotomy and sealed first with silicon elastomer then with dental acrylic. The
cranial windows were made of two rounded pieces of coverglass (Warner
Instruments) bonded with optical glue (NOA 61, Norland). The bottom piece was a
circular coverglass (4 mm diameter) that fit snugly in the craniotomy. The top piece
was a larger circular coverglass (3–5 mm, depending on size of bottom piece) and
was bonded to the skull using dental acrylic. Mice recovered for 5 days before
commencing water restriction.
Behavioral tasks. We trained mice to perform a head-fixed go/no-go visual dis-
crimination task, similar to previous designs3. Stimuli consisted of full-contrast sine
wave gratings (spatial frequency: 0.05 cycles deg−1; temporal frequency: 2 Hz)
drifting at either 0° (upwards, target, Stimulus A) or 90° (rightwards, non-target,
Stimulus B) away from vertical. Stimuli were presented to the right eye alone by
placing the screen at an oblique angle to the animal. Behavioral training and testing
was implemented with custom software written in Matlab (Mathworks) using
Psychtoolbox-335 and Data Acquisition toolbox. Spout position was controlled by
mounting the spout apparatus on a pneumatically-driven sliding linear actuator
(Festo) controlled by two solenoids. Licks were detected using an infrared emitter/
receiver pair (Digikey) mounted on either side of the retractable lick spout. Mice
were water-restricted and earned most of their daily ration (1 mL) during training.
An auditory cue tone (5 kHz, 0.5 s, 65 dB SPL) indicated the beginning of each
trial. After a 1 s delay, a visual stimulus was presented for 2 s. At the end of the
stimulus epoch, the spout was rapidly moved within reach of the tongue, and
remained within reach for 1.5 s. Correct licks during this period were rewarded
with 5–8 µl water and a brief reward tone (10 kHz, 0.1 s). Licks to the non-target
stimulus were punished with a white noise auditory stimulus alone (early training)
or white noise plus 1–3 µl of 5 mM quinine hydrochloride in water (late training).
This concentration was chosen to deter licking to non-targets without causing mice
to lose motivation altogether (Supplementary Fig. 1). At the end of the response
epoch, the spout was then rapidly retracted and remained out of reach until the
next trial (3 s inter-trial interval).
Mice were trained in successive stages, as previously described3. Briefly, mice
were first trained to lick a stationary lick spout during presentation of the target
stimulus, and then non-target stimuli were gradually introduced. Spout withdrawal
was introduced once mice showed good discrimination performance (d' > 1 and
RHIT − RFA > 30% for consecutive sessions), with the spout initially being extended
before stimulus onset, but gradually delayed to extend after stimulus offset. Once
mice reached high levels of performance at the final stage of the task (d' > 1.5 and
RHIT − RFA > 50%), they were removed from water restriction for window
implantation. Mice reached criterion performance after an average of 92 ±
11 sessions. After recovery from window implantation surgery, they were re-
trained to a level of high performance (2–7 days) before beginning experimental
sessions. Any sessions with poor performance were discarded (minimum
performance criterion: d' > 1 and RHIT − RFA > 30%).
During imaging experiments, blocks of engaged behavior trials were alternated
with blocks of passive viewing. Blocks were 5–10 min in duration (40–80 trials per
block). During passive blocks, the spout was out of reach for the duration of the
block. A few extra passive trials were given (without imaging) before each passive
block to ensure that mice did not expect spout presentation during all imaged
passive trials. The sequence of target and non-target stimuli presented for a given
passive block was matched to the sequence of stimuli used for the preceding
engaged block. In some cases, instead of alternating between engaged and passive
blocks, the engaged blocks were all grouped together at the beginning of the
session, followed by an equal number of consecutive passive blocks. No difference
in results was observed for alternating vs. grouped blocks.
Some mice (n = 6) were trained on a variable contrast version of the task. On
each trial, the stimulus was randomly set to one of six contrasts (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or
64%), regardless of whether the stimulus was a target or non-target. The mouse
therefore could not predict the contrast of the stimulus from trial to trial.
Some mice (n = 3) were re-trained after initial imaging experiments on a
reversed reward contingency. Reward contingency was switched abruptly, with
reward given for licks to Stimulus B and no reward for licks to Stimulus A. Because
mice were quickly discouraged by the reversal, no quinine punishment was initially
given. Additionally, the reward tone (10 kHz, 0.1 s) was paired with the onset of the
new target stimulus (Stimulus B) early in re-training, in order to encourage licking.
Three of the five mice trained on this reversed contingency achieved criterion
performance after re-training for 10 ± 2 days; the other two were removed from the
study.
For all tasks, behavioral d-prime (d') was computed by norminv(Hit rate) –
norminv(False alarm rate), where norminv() is the inverse of the cumulative
normal function34,36. Values of Hit and False alarm rate were truncated between
0.01 and 0.99, setting the maximum d' to 4.65. For illustration purposes, d-prime
before and after reversal was computed using Stimulus A as the target in both
conditions (Fig. 7b).
Two-photon imaging. GCaMP6s fluorescence was imaged 14–35 days after virus
injection using Prairie Ultima IV 2-photon microscopy system with a resonant

 galvo scanning module (Bruker). For fluorescence excitation, we used a Ti-
Sapphire laser (Mai-Tai eHP, Newport) with dispersion compensation (Deep See,
Newport) tuned to λ = 910 nm. For collection, we used GaAsP photomultiplier
tubes (Hamamatsu). To achieve a wide field of view, we used a 16× / 0.8 NA
microscope objective (Nikon), which was mounted on a z-piezo (Bruker) for
volume scanning. An optical zoom of 2× was used in most cases to improve spatial
resolution. Resonant scanning (15.9 kHz line rate, bidirectional) was synchronized
to z-piezo steps in the acquisition software for volume scanning. For volume
scanning, four 441 × 512 pixel imaging planes separated by 20 or 25 μm were
imaged sequentially at a stack rate of 5 Hz in 5–10 min imaging blocks. There was
very little redundant sampling of neurons between imaging planes (<1%) as
assayed by correlation coefficient of spontaneous activity. Laser power ranged from
40–75 mW at the sample depending on GCaMP6s expression levels. Photo-
bleaching was minimal (<1% min−1) for all laser powers used. A custom stainless
steel plate (eMachineShop.com) attached to a black curtain was mounted to the
head plate before imaging to prevent light from the visual stimulus monitor from
reaching the photomultiplier tubes. During imaging experiments, the poly-
propylene tube supporting the mouse was suspended from the behavior platform
with high tension springs (Small Parts) to dampen movement.
Image preprocessing and cell selection. Calcium imaging data were acquired
using PrairieView acquisition software and sorted into multi-page TIF files. All
analyses were performed using custom scripts written either in ImageJ or
MATLAB (Mathworks).
Images were first corrected for X–Y movement by registration to a reference
image (the pixel-wise mean of all frames) using 2-dimensional cross correlation. To
identify responsive neural somata, a pixel-wise activity map was calculated as
previously described37. Neuron cell bodies were identified using local adaptive
threshold and iterative segmentation. Automatically-defined ROIs were then
manually checked for proper segmentation in a MATLAB-based graphical user
interface (allowing comparison to raw fluorescence and activity map images). To
subtract the influence of local neuropil on somatic signals, the fluorescence in the
somata was estimated as Fcorrected_soma(t) = Fraw_soma(t) − 0.7 × Fneuropil(t), where
Fneuropil was the defined as the fluorescence in the region 0–15 mm from the ROI
border (excluding other ROIs)17. ΔF/F for each neuron was calculated as ΔF / Ft =
(Ft − F0) / F0, with F0 defined as the mode of the raw fluorescence density
distribution.
To align ROIs between different imaging sessions across days (Figs. 7 and 8), we
used a semi-automated method similar to prior work25. First, for each plane,
anchor points were manually defined by visual comparison of the two average
projection images. These anchor points helped to define a predicted displacement
vector field that would be used to map coordinates from one session to the other.
For each coordinate, the predicted vector was defined by the average (weighted
inversely by distance) of the vectors for all defined anchor points.
Next, for each ROI, a square region (~4 × the size of the ROI) around the ROI
was selected. To determine the displacement across sessions, we computed the
normalized cross-correlation of this square with the average projection of the other
session. This was multiplied point-by-point with a mask that decayed gradually
with distance from the predicted displacement vector, and then smoothed with a 2-
D Gaussian filter. The peak of the resulting image was taken to be the actual
displacement vector of the ROI. This process biases the displacement of each ROI
towards the vector predicted from the manually defined anchor points. Finally, any
ROIs with a computed displacement vector that differed by greater than 5 pixels
from the predicted vector were flagged for manual inspection, and then either
redrawn or removed.
After image preprocessing and ΔF/F extraction, traces were sorted by trial type
(Hit, Miss, Correct Reject, False Alarm) and condition (Engaged, Passive). The
baseline response (1 s before stimulus onset) was subtracted from each trial. A
neuron was considered task responsive if its mean ΔF/F during the last 1.6 s (8
frames) of the stimulus period was significantly (p < 0.01, t-test) greater than the
pre-stimulus baseline (1 s), for either hit or correct reject trials. Neurons also had to
meet a signal-to-noise criterion, needing a trial-averaged response that exceeded a
threshold of at least two standard deviations above baseline during either the
stimulus or response period. All further analyses are based on responses during the
last 1.6 s of the stimulus period, unless noted otherwise. Cell selection criteria for
error analyses, variable contrast analyses, and reversal analyses are described in the
appropriate sections below.
Statistics. The data were obtained from 15 mice, 5 with V1 only, 6 with PPC only,
and 4 with both V1 and PPC. For most mice, multiple fields of view were sampled
within V1 or within PPC. For mice with both V1 and PPC windows, fields from
each area were sampled on interleaved sessions. Each field was imaged for a single
session, consisting of multiple Engaged and Passive blocks and yielding on average
94 trials (minimum 47) per stimulus per condition. For variable contrast tasks, an
average of 25 trials (minimum 8) were acquired per contrast. Significantly task-
responsive cells from different fields were pooled by area. No tests were conducted
to determine sample size. For the full-contrast task, the data came from 1915
V1 cells (18 fields, 9 mice) and 3524 PPC cells (22 fields, 10 mice). For the variable-
contrast task, the data came from 250 V1 cells (8 fields, 3 mice) and 611 PPC cells
(11 fields, 6 mice). For comparisons before and after contingency reversal, the data
came from 488 V1 cells (8 fields, 3 mice) and 509 PPC cells (8 fields, 3 mice).
All statistical analysis was performed using custom-written scripts in MATLAB
or R. In all cases, data was not assumed to be normal, and nonparametric and/or
permutation tests (2000 permutations) were used to assess statistical significance of
results. All tests were two-tailed, and a significance level of p < 0.05 was considered
significant. Unless otherwise noted, all measures are reported as mean ± SEM.
When estimating the percentage of selective or modulated neurons, bootstrapping
across imaging fields was used to generate confidence intervals on the percentages
for each area. When testing the statistical significance of differences between V1
and PPC neurons that were pooled across imaging fields, clustered nonparametric
tests38,39 were used to account for intra-cluster correlations31,40 using the clusrank
package in R.
Selectivity and error trial analyses. Neurons were marked as target- or non-
target-preferring (Fig. 2e) based on their mean response during Engaged trials.
Neurons were marked as task-gated if they did not exhibit a significant response to
their preferred stimulus during Passive trials (Fig. 2f).
All comparative indices (engagement modulation index, error modulation
index, contrast modulation index, selectivity index) were computed using a receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which quantifies the ability of an ideal
observer to discriminate between trial types based on single trial responses18,36.
Each index was derived from the area under the ROC curve (auROC), and defined
as 2×(auROC–0.5); this value ranged from −1 to 15. Unless otherwise noted,
comparative indices were computed by comparing the stimulus period response
(averaged over the last 1.6 s). To determine whether comparative indices were
significant for individual neurons, we used a permutation test. We shuffled the
labels for each trial and recomputed the index 2000 times to create a distribution of
indices that could have arisen by chance. Indices outside the center 95% interval of
this distribution were considered significant (p < 0.05).
For error trial analyses, only behavioral sessions and imaging fields with at least
five trials per condition were used. Consecutive miss trials occurring at the end of a
session were excluded, as these trials are confounded by lack of motivation.
Analysis was additionally limited to Hit-preferring neurons. For analysis of False
Alarm trials (Fig. 3), we analyzed 1053 V1 cells from 16 fields, and 3034 PPC cells
from 21 fields. For analysis of Miss trials (Supplementary Fig. 3), we analyzed 202
V1 cells from 3 sessions, and 1165 PPC cells from 8 fields.
We assessed “stimulus-related” selectivity by comparing Hit to FA trials or Miss
to CR trials. We define “choice-related” selectivity as any premotor- or decision-
related signal, assessed by comparing FA to CR trials or Hit to Miss trials
(Supplementary Table 1). For most comparisons, any selectivity measured after the
stimulus period may include signals related to reward, punishment, or motor
output. We therefore restricted analyses of selectivity to the stimulus period.
Selectivity was computed across time using a ROC-based index evaluated
independently at each time bin (200 ms)19,29. A clustered Wilcoxon signed-rank
test39 was used at each time bin to test whether average selectivity for each area was
significantly different from zero (p < 0.05, no correction for multiple comparisons).
To assess the dependence of PPC responses on motor output (Supplementary
Fig. 2), we noticed that a few animals exhibited natural variability in licking
behavior across False Alarm (FA) trials. We analyzed neurons from the sessions
(846 PPC cells from 3 fields) that had at least five FA trials with 1–3 licks and five
FA trials with 5 or more licks. We additionally randomly selected Hit trials with the
same number of licks (5–9) to match the average number of licks in the FA (5–9)
condition. Selectivity between these conditions was evaluated using a ROC-based
index as above.
Generalized linear models. We used generalized linear models (GLM) to regress
recorded calcium signals against a time series of task events20–22. Calcium
responses for each cell were z-scored and modeled as the linear combination of
various task events, each convolved with a filter:

the slow offset dynamics of the calcium response17. Lags were chosen to be strictly
positive (causal) for stimulus and engagement predictors, but both positive and
negative (anti-causal) for licking predictors. The final model had 112 coefficients
including a constant bias term. Models were fit for all task-responsive neurons,

 where the first 5 s from each trial (following auditory cue onset) was extracted and
concatenated for analysis.
Models were fit using ridge regression using procedures similar to that of
previous studies20,22,41. We first set aside 20% of trials from each condition (Hit,
Correct Reject, Miss, False Alarm, Passive Target, Passive Nontarget) for testing. A
regularization parameter λ was estimated for each cell from among a range of λ
values (10−2 to 104) using cross-validation. Model performance was measured by
computing the proportion of explained variance, or the coefficient of determination
(R2). Five-fold cross-validation was used to choose the λ that maximized the
performance on the remaining 80% of training trials. The final model for each cell
was fit using the best λ, and then performance was evaluated by measuring R2 of
predictions for the holdout test set.
The strength of each model component (stimulus, engagement, motor/licking)
was evaluated for each V1 and PPC cell (Fig. 4f) by setting all other model
coefficients to zero and finding the model predictions using just one component,
averaging across both training and test trials. Model components were therefore in
units of z-scored calcium response and can be directly compared with calcium
response waveforms. For stimulus and engagement components, the preferred trial
type (Hit or Correct Reject) was used for each cell, whereas for the motor
component, Hit trials were used for all cells. To evaluate the relative strength of the
various components across V1 and PPC cells, the component strength for each cell
was averaged over a window of 0 to 4 s after stimulus onset, and then a Wilcoxon
rank-sum test was applied.
We also trained GLM models with a subset of the task predictors (Partial GLM
models, Supplementary Fig. 4) using the same procedures. Three additional models
were trained for each cell: a stimulus-only model which included the stimulus and
constant bias terms (43 coefficients), a motor-only model which included only the
licking and bias terms (27 coefficients), and a stimulus + engagement model which
used all terms except licking (86 coefficients). A separate cross-validation process
and regularization parameter was computed for each model, but the same training
and test trials were using to evaluate performance.
Performance on the partial models was evaluated only for cells with significant
fits (p < 0.05) to the full model. The test trial dataset was bootstrapped 2000 times,
and a p value was computed for each cell as the fraction of iterations with R2 ≤ 0.
(R2 can be negative if the model performs worse than a horizontal line on the held-
out test data). The same bootstrapped datasets were also used to determine whether
each partial model performed significantly above chance (p < 0.05), or significantly
worse than the full model fit (p < 0.05).
Contrast task analysis. For data acquired during the variable contrast task,
neurons were considered significantly responsive if the mean ΔF/F during the
stimulus period was significantly above threshold for at least two of the six con-
trasts of the same stimulus. We focused our analyses on target-preferring neurons,
which were included if their mean response across contrasts was greater for Hit
(target) trials compared to Correct Reject trials.
Single neuron contrast-response functions were fit to the hyperbolic ratio
function, also known as the Naka-Rushton function24:
R C
ð Þ ¼ Rmax
Cn
Cn þ Cn
50
þ R0
ð2Þ
where R(C) is the neural response as a function of contrast, Rmax is the
saturation point, C50 is the contrast at the half-saturation point, R0 is the baseline
response, and n is an exponent that determines the steepness of the curve. The
responses for both Engaged and Passive conditions were fit simultaneously, with n
constrained to be constant across conditions, by minimizing the sum (across data
points) of the squared error between the model and the data, divided by the
variance of that data point.
We evaluated the goodness of fit for each neuron using a bootstrap hypothesis
test, as detailed by others42. Briefly, we tested the null hypothesis that the mean of
the probability distribution underlying the neural responses was identical to the
predictions of the model. We measured the observed prediction error (eobs) and
computed the probability of observing an error at least as large if the null
hypothesis were true. To sample from a distribution that conformed to the null
hypothesis, we shifted the data such that the mean responses equaled the model
predictions, and drew 1000 bootstrap samples from this dataset, computing a
prediction error (ei) for each. The proportion of samples for which the prediction
error was larger than eobs is the achieved significance level. For neurons with an
achieved significance level below 10% (p < 0.1), there was sufficiently strong
evidence against the model, and therefore these neurons were excluded from
further analysis.
Contrast modulation index was computed to compare Engaged trial responses
on high (64%, 32%) vs. low (2%, 4%) contrasts, using a renormalized ROC index
which ranged from −1 to 1, as described above. Engagement modulation index was
computed by comparing Engaged vs. Passive trials, using high contrast trials only.
A permutation test was used to assess significance (p < 0.05) of these indices by
shuffling trial labels 2000 times and comparing the measured index to the shuffled
distribution of indices.
To assess anatomical spatial organization, pairwise Euclidean distance was
measured between all task-responsive, target-preferring neurons in the same
imaged volume (Fig. 6e–g). Cells were grouped into four groups based on whether
they were contrast-modulated, engagement-modulated only, both, or neither, and
then the average within-group and across-group distance was computed for each
cell (Fig. 6f). To compute differences in modulation index as function of distance
(Fig. 6g), pairs of cells were binned by distance in 40 µm bins.
Selectivity on error trials (Supplementary Fig. 5c-f) was computed by
comparing FA trials to Hit and CR trials (with matched contrast) using a frame-by-
frame ROC analysis, as described above. The contrast-dependence of the auROC-
based index was estimated by regressing the index against log contrast, and then
finding the slope. The significance (p < 0.05) of the slope was estimated for each cell
by shuffling the trial labels 2000 times for each contrast and then computing the
auROC on the shuffled data to generate a distribution of 2000 slopes.
Reverse contingency task analysis. We imaged from the same field of neurons
before and after reversal of reward contingency. The two sessions were separated by
an average time interval of 16 ± 1 days. A semi-automated method was used to
align ROIs between the two sessions (see "Image preprocessing and cell selection"
section). Neurons were included for analysis only if a significant response (p < 0.01)
to either stimulus was observed both before and after reversal. Selectivity index was
computed separately before and after reversal training (Fig. 7e–h) by comparing
responses to the Stimulus A (original target) and Stimulus B (original non-target),
with positive values indicating preference for the Stimulus A. Separate permutation
tests (2000 iterations) were used to assess significance of the selectivity before and
after reversal. Neurons with significant selectivity (p < 0.05) both before and after
reversal were categorized (Fig. 8a) based on the sign of the selectivity, and whether
it was stable or altered with reversal. Engagement modulation index (Fig. 8b) for
each neuron was computed separately before and after reversal, comparing
Engaged and Passive responses using the neuron’s preferred stimulus, and then
taking the mean of the two values. Error modulation index (Fig. 8c) for each
neuron was also computed separately before and after reversal, comparing FA and
CR responses, and then taking the mean of the two values.
