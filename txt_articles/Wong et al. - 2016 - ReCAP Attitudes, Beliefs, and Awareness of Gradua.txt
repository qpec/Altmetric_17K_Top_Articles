QUESTION ASKED: What are graduate medical education trainees’ attitudes and beliefs
regarding palliative care, what is their awareness of the availability and role of palliative
care services, and does previous exposure to a palliative care rotation facilitate a better
awareness of palliative care?
SUMMARY ANSWER: A vast majority of oncology trainees perceived palliative care
services to be beneficial for patient care (92%) and were supportive of mandatory palliative
caretraining(74%).Surgicaloncologytraineesandtraineeswithnopreviouspalliativecare
exposure were significantly less likely to consult palliative care and had significantly less
awareness of palliative care.
METHODS: We conducted an institutional review board–approved online survey to
determine awareness of palliative care among graduate medical trainees at MD Anderson.
One hundred seventy oncology trainees who completed at least 9 months of training in
medical, surgical, gynecologic, and radiation oncology fellowship and residency program
during the 2013 academic year completed an online questionnaire. Descriptive, univariate,
and multivariate analyses were performed.
BIAS, CONFOUNDING FACTOR(S), DRAWBACKS: Although there was a substantial
response rate (78%), the results may not be generalizable as the survey was conducted at a
single institution. Also, the frequency of palliative care referrals is self-reported.
REAL-LIFEIMPLICATIONS: Ourfindingssuggestthatexposuretopalliativecaretraining
may lead to increased awareness of palliative care among oncologists, and thus, increased
overall and early referrals to palliative care. Surgical oncology trainees may benefit from
increased exposure to palliative care rotations. More research is needed to characterize the
impact of training on referral patterns to palliative care. In the meantime, efforts should be
made to include formal palliative care rotations in oncology training.

Abstract
Purpose
Palliativecare(PC)trainingandintegrationwithoncologycareremainsuboptimal.Current
attitudes and beliefs of the oncology trainees regarding PC are not fully known. This study
was undertaken in an attempt to address this issue.
Participants and Methods
We conducted a survey to determine awareness of PC among graduate medical trainees
at a comprehensive cancer center with an established PC program. One hundred seventy
oncology trainees who completed $ 9 months of training in medical, surgical, gynecologic,
andradiationoncologyfellowshipsandresidencyprogramsduringthe2013academicyear
completed an online questionnaire. Descriptive, univariable, and multivariable analyses
were performed.
Results
The response rate was 78% (132 of 170 trainees); 10 trainees without hands-on patient
care were excluded. Medical (53 of 60 [88%]), gynecologic (six of six [100%]), and radiation
oncology (20 of 20 [100%]) trainees reported more awareness of PC compared with
surgical oncology (22 of 36 [61%]) trainees (P = .001). One hundred twelve of 122 (92%)
perceived PC as beneficial to patients and families. One hundred eight of 122 (89%)
perceived that PC can reduce health care costs, 78 (64%) believed that PC can increase
survival, and 90 (74%) would consult PC for a patient with newly diagnosed cancer with
symptoms. Eighty-two trainees (67%) believed a mandatory PC rotation is important.
Trainees with previous exposure to PC rotations were more aware of the role of PC
services than were trainees without PC rotation (96% [46 of 48] v 74% [55 of 74]; P = .005,
respectively).
Conclusion
Surgical trainees and trainees without previous PC rotation had significantly less
awareness of PC. Overall, trainees perceived PC as beneficial to patients and capable of
reducing costs while increasing survival; they also supported early PC referrals and
endorsed a mandatory PC rotation.
INTRODUCTION
Palliative care (PC) developed fairly re-
cently as a specialty and has grown rapidly
since being recognized as a subspecialty by
the American Board of Medical Subspe-
cialties.1 PC is defined by the WHO as an

 approach that minimizes suffering and improves the quality
of life of patients and their families who are facing life-
threatening illnesses.2 PC has been reported as decreasing
the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stays, health care
spending, and emergency room visits.3-5
ASCOproposesthatPCbefullyintegratedasaroutinepart
of comprehensive cancer care in the United States by 2020.6
In a 2013 report on the state of cancer care and a 2014 report
on end-of-life care, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) proposed
that PC be integrated into the care of all patients with
cancer7,8.
Palliative medicine programs have developed rapidly at
larger hospitals and academic hospitals in the United States
over the past decade.9,10 Early referrals to PC are crucial in
allowing clinical teams to provide early relief of physical and
psychosocial distress, establish a relationship with patients
and families, and facilitate advance care and discharge
planning, possibly resulting in preventing both inpatient and
ICU death.3,6 However, only a minority of patients with
advanced cancer receive referrals to PC, and those often
occur late in the trajectory of illness.9-13 One study suggests
that academic training has a positive impact on the
knowledge of future physicians regarding PC.14 Despite the
rapid growth of PC and its integration into many compre-
hensive cancer centers, there is no consistent require-
ment for PC training during medical school and residency
training in the United States. Trainees report inadequate
knowledge and a lack of competence in PC skills and would
like more training and education in palliative and end-of-life
care.15-22
At The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,

three different settings: five mobile consultation teams, an
acute PC unit, and an outpatient supportive care clinic.23 The
fellows and trainees at MD Anderson come into frequent
contact with PC during the process of direct patient care and
also during rotations in PC.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the
awareness of PC services among graduate medical education
trainees (residents and fellows) at MD Anderson by assessing
attitudes and beliefs of trainees regarding PC as well as their
awarenessoftheavailabilityandroleofPCservices.Secondary
aimsincludeddeterminingassociationsbetweendemographic
factors and the usage of PC services at a comprehensive cancer
center, and determining associations between previous
exposure to PC and awareness of PC services.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Recruitment
This was an institutional review board–approved prospective
cross-sectional survey of graduate medical trainees who
attended MD Anderson for training between July 2013 and
June 2014.
We chose to conduct this study at MD Anderson, as
compared with conducting a multicenter study, because these
trainees have been exposed to a fully developed and func-
tioning PC program and because there is wide variation in the
number and size of PC programs, even at cancer centers.12
Therefore, it was expected that these trainees would be
exposed to more uniform PC training.
Trainees were identified initially with help from the Office
of the Department of Graduate Medical Education and were
thenselectedtoparticipateiftheirspecialtyinvolvedhands-on
patient care, such as in medical oncology, gynecologic
oncology, surgical oncology, and radiation oncology.
To be eligible, participants had to be full-time graduate
medicaltraineesatMDAndersonwhospent$ 1 day per week
providing direct hands-on care, and trainees also had to have
delivered care to at least one patient who died of cancer within
the past year.

those participants who did not respond within 10 days,
reminder e-mails were sent by the data manager, followed by
another e-mail to those who did not respond by day 20. A total
of six e-mails (approximately one e-mail per week) was sent to
each participant.
Survey Development
The survey was composed of 24 questions and was developed
by the research team, which included leaders in PC fellowship
education who had expertise in competencies and/or learner
evaluation.Onthebasisofareviewofrecentrecommendations
regarding PC from organizations such as ASCO6 and the
IOM,8,9 recent PC literature,3,5 and educational goals set forth

 by the mandatory PC rotation for medical oncology fellows at
MD Anderson, the authors developed eight questions to
survey the overall awareness among oncology residents and
fellows of the role and availability of PC. Multiple organ-
izations, including the IOM,8,9 the American Cancer Society,
the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine,
andtheCentertoAdvancePalliativeCare,haveclearlydefined
the difference between PC and hospice and/or end-of-life
care.24 We sought to ascertain awareness of trainees of this
difference by asking whether supportive and palliative care
(SPC) is synonymous with hospice care. On the basis of recent
recommendations regarding SPC from organizations such as
ASCO6 and the IOM,8,9 as well as on findings from recent PC
literature, we sought to survey the awareness of trainees of
when referrals to PC for patients with cancer are appropriate.
The IOM recommends integration of PC for patients with
cancer at all points of disease trajectory, from diagnosis to end
of life.8,9 Numerous studies, including randomized controlled
trials, have shown that PC referrals improve quality of life and
possibly survival and decrease symptom burden and health
care costs, ICU visits, and emergency room visits.3,5,25-33
Although some health care professionals perceive that SPC
referral decreases hope,34 there is no study to date that has
proven this. We assessed the awareness of trainees of SPC by
asking them whether SPC referral can decrease hope.
We also assessed the demographics of the respondent;
previous training in PC; frequency of use of the PC service;
perception of the usefulness of PC service; awareness of the
impactofPCondecreasedsymptomburden,decreasedhealth
care spending, decreased emergency room visits, decreased
ICU stays, and increased overall survival; and attitudes and
beliefs regarding the benefit of early referral to PC and the
benefit of PC education. The survey was intentionally concise
to maximize response from the target audience of busy
trainees. The full survey questionnaire is available in the Data
Supplement.
Data Analyses
Thisdescriptiveprotocolwasbasedonasampleof187trainees
who could provide an adequate number of responses for the
primaryoutcome, which wasa description of theattitudes and
beliefs regarding PC among graduate medical trainees at MD
Anderson.
We summarized the data using standard descriptive sta-
tisticsandcontingencytables.Associationbetweencategorical
variables was examined by x2 test or Fisher’s exact test. The
Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to examine the differ-
ence in continuous variables between groups. Both uni-
variable and multivariable logistic regression models were
applied to assess the effect of variables of interest on aware-
ness of PC.
AllanalyseswereperformedinSAS9.3(SASInstitute,Cary,
NC). P values # .05 were considered statically significant.
RESULTS
One hundred thirty-two of 171 (77%) responded and com-
pleted the survey. Ten trainees were excluded because they
werenotinvolvedinhands-onpatientcareordidnotcarefora
dying patient in the past year. The final sample size was 122 of
132trainees.Table 1 lists trainee characteristics and compares
the attitudes and beliefs of trainees with decreased awareness
with those of trainees with increased awareness of SPC
services. Table 2 categorizes awareness regarding PC concepts
and the availability and role of PC services among graduate
medical trainees (residents and fellows) at MD Anderson on
thebasisofeightquestions.Thecutoffofansweringfewerthan
six of eight questions correctly equates to less than 75%
correct. This was termed as having less awareness of SPC. The
correct answers are listed in Table 2. Seventeen percent of
trainees (n = 21) were found be less aware, answering fewer
than six questions correctly. Fifty of 122 participants (41%)
answered all eight questions correctly.
Inbrief,Table 1 indicates that the majority of trainees were
fellows in general medical oncology, and that there was no
significant difference in age or sex. A larger proportion of
surgical trainees (39%) reported decreased awareness of PC
compared with medical (12%), gynecologic (0%), and radi-
ation oncology (0%) trainees (P , .001). Fifty of 51 of trainees
who referred to PC most or all the time showed more
awareness of PC compared with those who referred to PC
none of the time (98% v 33%, respectively; P , .001). Those
with increased awareness of SPC were significantly more
likely to have trained at MD Anderson for longer than 1 year
than were trainees with less awareness (90.5% v 71%, respec-
tively [34 of 48]; P = .004). Of interest, compared with trainees
with more awareness, trainees with less awareness of SPC
were more likely to have been in postmedical school training
for more than 6 years (94% v 75%, respectively; P = .006).
Trainees with previous exposure to PC rotations had more
awareness of PC than did trainees without PC rotation (96%
[46 of 48] v 74% [55 of 74], respectively; P = .002). A majority
(67%) of trainees agreed that mandatory rotation in PC is

 important. Those with decreased awareness of PC were less
likely to agree that a mandatory rotation is important (12% v
88%, P = .035), but 10 of 21 (48%) of those reporting de-
creased awareness of PC felt that a mandatory rotation was
needed. Overall, trainees (100 of 122 [82%]) strongly preferred
using the term supportive care over PC (P = .003). One
hundred twelve trainees (92%) perceived PC as beneficial to
patients and families. Of those surveyed, 90 (74%) would
consult PC for a patient with newly diagnosed cancer with
symptoms, 108 (89%) perceived that PC can reduce health
care costs, 78 (64%) perceived that PC can increase survival,
and 37 (30%) perceived that PC referral decreased hope
(Table 2).
Table 3 indicates that in comparison with other specialties,
surgical trainees more commonly did not refer to SPC (P ,
.001). Surgical trainees more commonly would not consult
SPC for symptomatic patients with newly diagnosed cancer (P
= .009) nor for those undergoing active primary treatment of
cancer (P = .004). Compared with trainees from other spe-
cialties, surgical trainees do not believe a referral to PC
increases survival (P , .001). On univariable logistic
regression analyses, compared with surgical oncology spe-
cialty,radiationoncologyspecialty(oddsratio[OR],7.44;95%

 theradiationoncologyspecialty,ascomparedwiththesurgical
oncology specialty (OR, 5.29; 95% CI, 1.63 to 17.23; P = .005),
and previous PC training (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.03 to 6.07; P =
.042) were associated with increased awareness of SPC
services.
DISCUSSION
The results of our survey demonstrate that trainees with less
awarenessofPCarelesslikelytohavereceivedPCtrainingand
arealsomorelikelytobesurgeons(AppendixTable A1, online
only). It may be that surgical trainees see fewer patients at the
end of life because they may be seeing patients who are in the
early stages of diagnosis or treatment and are seeking a
curative treatment, and, thus, surgeons may be referring in-
frequently to PC. More research is needed to define the asso-
ciation between length of training in PC and referral patterns.
The surgical oncology fellowship at MD Anderson is shorter
thanthatoftheothertraineeprograms,and,thus,itmaybethat
the surgeons are less exposed to the PC program. Studies have
shown that decreased exposure and education is associated
with less use of PC,34-40 and our findings support this.
PreviousPCtraining,aswellastimespentatMDAnderson,
had a strong impact on awareness of PC as well as on referral
pattern(AppendixTableA1).LackoftraininginPCmayresult
in less use of the PC service, which may reflect on overall
patient care and quality of care. Qualitative studies concluded
that previous training in PC increases the competencies of
trainees with end-of-life care20,21 and general patient care.41
Two thirds of the trainees surveyed agreed that mandatory
rotationsinPCshouldbeimplementedinmedicalschoolsand
residency training programs. Most oncology fellowships
across the nation do not have mandatory rotations in PC.12
Severalstudiesthatsurveyedtraineeshaveshownthattraining
is inadequate but desired by trainees.15-22 Currently, stand-
ardized curricula for undergraduate and graduate trainees are
being developed.42

 One of the secondary outcomes of a randomized control
trial of early PC access was that patients referred to PC
experiencedlongersurvival.4 We were surprised that although
there was little evidence to support this finding at the time our
survey was conducted, an overwhelming percentage of the
trainees felt that PC referral can increase survival. It is en-
couraging that a study published after our survey was com-
pleted confirmed that early PC may improve survival.43
WefoundthattraineeswithmoreawarenessofSPCbelieve
thatSPCshouldbeconsultedforpatientswithnoactivecancer
but with uncontrolled symptoms—this needs to be explored
further. Perhaps their experience in having thephysical and
emotional distress of their patients alleviated after referral to
SPC may prompt them to refer their distressed patients with
cancer without any active disease to PC. As such, the majority
of trainees (92%) reported that SPC is beneficial to patients
and families.
Our findings suggest that surgical oncology trainees may
need to be targeted for PC education. Our findings are sup-
ported by a recent study that showed that surgical oncology
fellows believe end-of-life care training is a necessary but
lacking part of their training.44 Surgical oncology trainees at
MD Anderson work closely with anesthesiologists and the
acute pain service for the management of postoperative pain,
and, thus, surgical trainees are likely to consult with them
more often than with PC. Of interest, we found that a longer
time spent in postmedical school training indicated less
awareness and less use of PC. Surgical trainees have a much
longer postmedical school training period compared with the
other specialties, which may be a possible explanation for our
finding.
Medical oncology trainees at MD Anderson were highly
supportive of PC. A possible explanation is their increased
exposure to our service, because these trainees have a man-
datory1-monthrotationinPCduringwhichtheyworkclosely
with palliative medicine fellows and faculty in both outpatient
and inpatient supportive care and PC settings.
Those who believe SPC can decrease hope may need to be
targetedforincreasedPCexposureandeducation,although,to
our knowledge, there has been no study that has proven SPC
referral decreases hope. This perception from the perspective
of the health care provider needs to be explored further. In our
previous study, however, we observed that our referring
medicaloncologistsandmidlevelprovidersperceivedtheterm
PC to be associated with a reduction in hope.45 Therefore, our
objective in this study was to confirm whether traineeshad the
same perception. Studies have suggested that provider per-
ceptions of PC removing hope may be barriers to timely
referrals to SPC.34
Ofimportance,althoughtheacademicdepartmentandthe
Palliative Care Unit are called Palliative Care, the outpatient
clinic and inpatient mobile consult service are both called
Supportive Care. This has been shown to be associated with
increased and earlier referrals.45,46 Our findings confirmed a
strong preference for the name Supportive Care. Perhaps the
name change from PC may facilitate an improved perception
among trainees at other programs.
Our study has several limitations. First, the study was
conducted at a comprehensive cancer center with a well-
established PC program and may not be generalizable to
other centers. Although the response rate was 82%, there
could a potential selection bias caused by those who chose not
to answer the survey.
ThesurveyquestionnaireweusedtoassessawarenessofPC
is not a validated tool. To our knowledge, there is no tool at
present that tests the awareness of PC and its concepts,
availability, and role among nonspecialized providers. Our
intentionwasnottoconstructaninstrumentortoolbutsimply
to survey the attitudes and beliefs of oncology trainees.
QuestionsandstatementsregardingawarenessofPCrolesand
services again were based on recommendations, statements,
andqualitymeasuressuggestedbyASCO,theIOM,theCenter
to Advance Palliative Care, and recent PC literature.3,5,8,9,25-33
The responses to the survey are both surprising and
encouraging in that there was a highly positive attitude toward
PC. In the past, we have suggested that the adoption of PC by
institutions requires a culture shift.47 In 2008, the European
Society of Medical Oncology found that 15% of 895 medical
oncologists surveyed had negative views regarding involve-
ment of PC.48 A more recent study found that # 22% of 50
oncologists had negative views regarding SPC.49 Our findings
suggest that exposure to PC referrals and education has
dramatically changed the culture among oncologists (in
training) toward PC.
In conclusion, trainees in medical, surgical, radiation, and
gynecologic oncology at a comprehensive cancer center were
highly aware and supportive of PC, and a majority endorsed a
mandatory PC rotation in medical school and residency,
although this is not widely available nationwide. Increased
awareness of PC, as compared with less awareness, leads to
overall increased referrals and increased early referrals to PC.
Surgical oncology trainees may benefit from increased
