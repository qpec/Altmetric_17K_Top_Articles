Cathelicidins in the Tasmanian devil 
(Sarcophilus harrisii)
E. Peel1, Y. Cheng1, J. T. Djordjevic2, S. Fox3, T. C. Sorrell2 & K. Belov1
Tasmanian devil joeys, like other marsupials, are born at a very early stage of development, prior to 
the development of their adaptive immune system, yet survive in a pathogen-laden pouch and burrow. 
Antimicrobial peptides, called cathelicidins, which provide innate immune protection during early 
life, are expressed in the pouch lining, skin and milk of devil dams. These peptides are active against 
pathogens identified in the pouch microbiome. Of the six characterised cathelicidins, Saha-CATH5 and 
6 have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and are capable of killing problematic human pathogens 
including methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, while Saha-CATH3 is 
active against fungi. Saha-CATH5 and 6 were toxic to human A549 cells at 500 μg/mL, which is over 
seven times the concentration required to kill pathogens. The remaining devil cathelicidins were not 
active against tested bacterial or fungal strains, but are widely expressed throughout the body, such 
as in immune tissues, in digestive, respiratory and reproductive tracts, and in the milk and pouch, 
which indicates that they are likely also important components of the devil immune system. Our results 
suggest cathelicidins play a role in protecting naive young during pouch life by passive immune transfer 
in the milk and may modulate pouch microbe populations to reduce potential pathogens.
Antimicrobial peptides are a primitive component of the innate immune system of animals, with cathelicidins 
and defensins being the two predominant families in mammalian species1. Cathelicidins are a family of small, 
cationic antimicrobial peptides, which function as natural antibiotics through antimicrobial and immunomod-
ulatory activities1. Cathelicidins directly kill a broad spectrum of bacteria2, fungi3 and parasites4 through elec-
trostatic interaction of positively charged peptides with the negative pathogen cell membrane, resulting in the 
formation of trans-membrane pores5. In addition, cathelicidins indirectly target pathogens by modulating cells 
of the innate and adaptive immune systems to alter the local cellular and chemical environment1. This includes; 
the release and suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators6–8, formation of chemotactic gradients9, immune cell 
development and angiogenesis10,11. Cathelicidins are encoded as prepropeptides which are stored within neu-
trophil granules and epithelial cells. The prepropeptides contain three domains; a signal peptide and conserved 
cathelin domain provides structure to the peptide through the formation of two di-sulphide bonds between four 
cysteine residues12. The antimicrobial domain is positively charged and varies significantly within and amongst 
individual species. Following secretion, the antimicrobial domain is cleaved to form the active mature peptide1.
Cathelicidins have been studied extensively in eutherian mammals, however marsupials are relatively unex-
plored. Marsupials have a characteristic short gestation period of up to only 35 days13 culminating in the birth 
of highly altricial young14,15. Young are born immunologically naive due to undifferentiated lymphoid tissues 
and lack of immune effector cells16. Unlike eutherians, which undergo immune development within the ster-
ile confines of the uterus, marsupials undergo this process within a pouch or burrow that contains a diverse 
community of bacteria and fungi17. Primary immune tissues do not mature for up to 30 days after birth16 and 
antibody-mediated immunity is not fully acquired until around 90 days18. Mechanisms which protect the young 
during this time are not fully understood, but rapid development of the innate immune system and passive trans-
fer of antibodies and antimicrobial peptides in the milk are two strategies thought to be involved19. Cathelicidins 
are secreted in tammar wallaby milk throughout lactation20 and expressed in the pouch epithelium14,21,22 and 
pouch young skin from day one post-partum22. At these sites they may modulate microbial populations to elimi-
nate pathogens23, supporting their functional role in protecting naive young.

Evolution of the cathelicidin gene family through gene duplications has resulted in multiple genes in different 
lineages, encoding separate peptides24. The need to protect immunologically naive young may have encouraged 
the lineage specific expansion of the cathelicidin gene family in marsupials14. Marsupials have a higher number 
of cathelicidin genes than eutherians. For example, the gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica) has 
12 cathelicidin genes, whereas humans25 and mice26 have only one. Cathelicidins have only been characterised 
in the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), gray short-tailed opossum and platypus (Ornithorhyncus anatinus) 
due to the availability of genomic data. Only two tammar wallaby cathelicidins have been tested, and both show 
broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and are capable of killing antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae22. These results suggest marsupial cathelicidins may provide an alternative to traditional 
antibiotics in the fight against drug resistant pathogens. Given the range of activity observed across tammar wal-
laby and eutherian cathelicidins, we wanted to explore the antimicrobial activity of other marsupial cathelicidins 
and their potential role in protecting pouch young. Tasmanian devils have a short gestation period of up to 30 
days and give birth to young weighing only 0.3 g27. Young remain firmly attached to the teat for the next 80 days27, 
after which they ride on the mother’s back and are left in a den, but continue to suckle until weaning at around 
7 months28. In addition to the need for protection during pouch life, Tasmanian devils are exposed to a range of 
harmful pathogens during adulthood. Tasmanian devils are scavengers and are renowned for their aggressive 
behaviour, including fighting and biting before they become independent adults28. As such, their immune system 
may have evolved mechanisms such as cathelicidins with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity to compensate 
for this heightened exposure. Release of the Tasmanian devil genome in 2012 provided a new source of data to 
search for cathelicidins29. Our aim was to characterise cathelicidins in the Tasmanian devil genome, and deter-
mine their antimicrobial activity against human and animal pathogens with the aim of understanding their role 
in protecting Tasmanian devil young during pouch life. Additional findings may lead to possible antimicrobial 
candidates for future therapeutic development.
Results
Cathelicidin gene characterization. 
Six cathelicidins were identified in the Tasmanian devil genome. 
Cathelicidin names were assigned at random and do not imply their position on the chromosome or orthology 
with other species. All six cathelicidins are located on chromosome two29, however their relative positions on the 
chromosome are unknown due to the fragmented nature of the genome assembly.
Multiple sequence alignment revealed that Tasmanian devil peptides contained all the characteristic features 
of cathelicidins, including peptide domains and motifs (Supplementary Figure S1). All six genes contained four 
exons, similar to other cathelicidins. The prepropeptides ranged from 154 to 172 amino acids in length and con-
tained a signal peptide, conserved cathelin domain and variable antimicrobial domain.
The signal peptide sequence ranged from 21–27 amino acids in length with a high proportion of leucine 
residues. The cathelin domain ranged from 89 to 95 amino acid residues in length and contained a number of 
conserved residues. The characteristic four cysteine motif, which is an identifying feature of cathelicidins, was 
present and is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. The antimicrobial domain was highly variable in length and 
composition, ranging from 20 to 37 amino acids with a high proportion of charged residues. This imparts a cati-
onic charge on the mature peptide, ranging from 3.9 to 8.1 at pH7 (Table 1). Few conserved residues were evident, 
with only 17 to 47% similarity amongst Tasmanian devil mature peptide sequences. Significant sequence heter-
ogeneity was also observed within marsupial mature peptides, as Tasmanian devil sequences were only 15–40% 
similar to tammar wallaby and 3–30% to opossum.
As expected, Tasmanian devil cathelicidins cluster with those of other marsupials in the phylogenetic tree 
(Fig. 1), indicating that they are more similar to marsupial cathelicidins than to those of monotremes or euthe-
rians. Saha-CATH1 and 2 cluster with opossum and tammar wallaby cathelicidins, suggesting that these genes 
arose prior to the divergence of these species around 70 million years ago30. In comparison, Saha-CATH3, 5 and 6 
form a species-specific clade, which suggests that they have arisen through more recent gene duplications.
Expression profile. 
Expression level of Tasmanian devil cathelicidins were assessed in a wide range 
of immune, reproductive, secretory, respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues using relative qPCR (Fig. 2). 
Saha-CATH1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 were expressed in all tissues tested, whilst Saha-CATH3 was not expressed in the 
pouch, lung or heart. As expected, all six cathelicidins were present in blood, spleen and lymph node as they 
are stored within neutrophil granules. Saha-CATH1 and 4 were most highly expressed in the blood, whilst 
Saha-CATH3, 5 and 6 were most highly expressed in the spleen. Conversely, Saha-CATH2 was present at the

lowest levels within the spleen and was most highly expressed in the pouch. Saha-CATH1, 4, 5 and 6 were also 
expressed in the pouch at lower levels compared to their expression in other tissues. Additionally, transcripts 
of Saha-CATH1, 2, 5 and 6 were also detected in a milk transcriptome31. Cathelicidin expression within the 
mouth mucosa, skin, pouch, uterus and milk supports their functional role in protecting naïve young during 
development.
Change of pouch microbiome during lactation. 
To test the hypothesis that the microbial community 
in devil’s pouch undergoes compositional changes in response to lactation, we examined the pouch microbiota 
of three non-lactating and three lactating devils by sequencing PCR amplicons of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene 
V3-V4 region (around 465 bp) on the Illumina MiSeq System. A total of 468,268 sequences were obtained after 
quality filtering, with the smallest number of sequences obtained for one sample being 44,880 and the largest 
being 116,364. These sequences were grouped into 4,410 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which were cat-
egorised to 26 bacterial phyla, 79 classes, 138 orders, 261 families, and 487 genera. Consistent with previous 
observation32, the pouch flora of non-lactating devils consisted mainly of bacteria from five phyla: Proteobacteria 
(35.3%), Firmicutes (28.4%), Fusobacteria (27.5%), Bacteroidetes (5.7%), and Actinobacteria (1.9%) (Fig. 3).
Several differences were detected between the pouch of non-lactating and lactating devils (Fig. 3). Firstly, 
the unweighted UniFrac distance within the non-lactating group (0.58 ± 
 0.03) was significantly lower than the 
distance between lactating and non-lactating samples (0.68 ± 
 0.07), suggesting a high degree of compositional

dissimilarity between the pouch flora of non-lactating and lactating devils. This can be seen in the principal 
coordinates analysis (PCoA) plot (Fig. 3) where non-lactating samples grouped together but were separate from 
the lactating samples. Thirty-four OTUs exhibited significantly lower relative abundance in the lactating pouch 
than in non-lactating samples (Wilcoxon rank sum test p < 
 0.05), with the most pronounced changes occurring 
in the level of Leptotrichiaceae (20.9% in non-lactating samples vs. 0.4% in lactating), Porphyromonas (4.5% vs. 
0.3%), Pasteurellaceae (1.7% vs. 0.1%), and Parvimonas (1.0% vs. 0.2%). Despite the decrease in these bacteria, 
the overall level of bacterial diversity in the pouch of lactating and non-lactating devils was similar (Fig. 3), which 
may be a result of faecal contamination from the pouch young. Indeed, the prevalence of Cetobacterium (1.9% in 
non-lactating samples vs. 10.9% in lactating) and Clostridium (1.0% vs. 4.3%), two genera that are main compo-
nents of devil gut microbiota, significantly increased in the pouch that had pouch young present.
Antimicrobial activity. 
To assess the antimicrobial activity of devil cathelicidins, we tested synthesized 
mature peptides on 25 bacterial and 6 fungal strains (Table 2). As there were no Tasmanian devil specific isolates 
available, human and veterinary strains were used. The antimicrobial activity of Tasmanian devil cathelicidin 
mature peptides Saha-CATH1 to 6 against bacteria and fungi is summarised in Table 2. Saha-CATH1, 2 and 4 
did not show antimicrobial activity against the bacteria and fungi tested, with a minimum inhibitory concentra-
tion (MIC) of greater than 64 μ 
g/mL. As such, these values are not included in Table 2. Saha-CATH3 had highly 
specific activity, as it was unable to kill any bacteria, but killed Cryptococcus neoformans. Saha-CATH6 killed a 
number of Streptococcus species and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF), however was ineffec-
tive against other bacteria. On the other hand, Saha-CATH5 had broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against 
gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and killed the drug resistant pathogens VREF and methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Table 2). The antifungal activity of Saha-CATH5 and 6 was more restricted, but 
both peptides showed activity against Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. The MIC 
values for ampicillin, tetracycline and fluconazole were within the acceptable limits for ATCC strains according 
to clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) guidelines, and are included in Table 2.
Cytotoxicity and haemolysis. 
Further experiments were carried out to assess cytotoxic and haemolytic 
potencies of devil cathelicidin mature peptides. Tasmanian devil cathelicidin mature peptides Saha-CATH1, 2, 
3 and 4 were not toxic to the human cell line A549 as seen in Fig. 4a. Cell survival of Saha-CATH1 treated cells 
remained close to the control at all concentrations. Survival of Saha-CATH2 treated cells also remained close to 
the control over dilutions ranging between 1.9 μ 
g/mL to 250 μ 
g/mL, however survival of cells at 500 μ 
g/mL was 
significantly higher than the growth control (p < 
 0.05). The same pattern was observed for Saha-CATH3 at 1.9, 
7.9, 15.6 and 250 μ 
g/mL and all dilutions of Saha-CATH4 ranging between 15.6 to 500 μ 
g/mL (p < 
 0.05). The 
significant increase in cell survival above the level of the untreated growth control, as seen in Fig. 4a, does not 
necessarily indicate cathelicidins are inducing proliferation of A549 cells, rather it is more likely a reflection of cell

growth throughout the assay. Alamar blue is an indicator of mitochondrial activity, hence cell growth during the 
assay results in an increase in the reduction of alamar blue and an elevated percentage cell survival relative to the 
growth control. Cell survival of Saha-CATH5 and 6 treated cells was significantly higher than the growth control 
over the concentrations of 1.9 to 250 μ 
g/mL, and 3.9 to 250 μ 
g/mL respectively (p < 0.05). As such, Saha-CATH5 
and 6 were non toxic up to a concentration of 250 μ 
g/mL. Saha-CATH5 was the most toxic as treatment of cells 
with 500 μ 
g/mL resulted in 42% cell survival compared to the untreated growth control (p < 
 0.05). Similarly, 
treatment with Saha-CATH6 at the same concentration resulted in 59% cell survival (p < 0.05).
The majority of Tasmanian devil cathelicidin mature peptides did not lyse human red blood cells as shown in 
Fig. 4b. Saha-CATH1, 2, 3 and 4 caused very low levels of haemolysis, below 7% at all concentrations compared 
with the positive control. Despite this, mean absorbance values for red blood cells treated with Saha-CATH2 at 
500 μ 
g/mL, Saha-CATH3 at 250 and 500 μ 
g/mL and Saha-CATH4 from 125 to 500 μ 
g/mL were significantly dif-
ferent from the negative control (p < 0.05). Similarly, mean absorbance values of Saha-CATH5 and 6 from 31.25 
to 125 μ 
g/mL were significantly different from the negative control (p < 
 0.05), however lysis remained below 15% 
at these concentrations. Saha-CATH6 was moderately haemolytic at 250 and 500 μ 
g/mL, however lysis remained 
below 26% (p < 
 0.05). In support of the cytotoxicity data above, Saha-CATH5 was the most toxic as it caused 37% 
haemolysis at 500 μ 
g/mL (p < 0.05).
Discussion
Tasmanian devils have multiple cathelicidin genes, similar to other marsupials14,22,33, which have evolved to pro-
tect immunologically naive young through modulating the pouch microbiome and providing a direct source 
of immune compounds within the milk. This is supported by the presence of Tasmanian devil cathelicidins 
Saha-CATH1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 in the milk and pouch, coupled with their antimicrobial activity. Saha-CATH5 and 6 
killed bacteria identified in the pouch microbiome as well as drug resistant strains. Saha-CATH3 exhibited activ-
ity uniquely against the fungal pathogen, C. neoformans. Saha-CATH1, 2 and 4 were not antimicrobial, but the 
peptides were widely expressed throughout the body and may modulate the immune system.
Our analyses show that Tasmanian devil cathelicidin Saha-CATH5 has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity 
against gram negative and positive bacteria (Table 2). Tasmanian devil cathelicidin Saha-CATH6 is also antibac-
terial, however is only active against gram positive strains. Both cathelicidins killed the drug resistant pathogens 
MRSA and VREF. Fungi which are commonly involved in skin infections (Candida spp.) were also killed by 
Saha-CATH5 and 6, as were Cryptococcus species. The activity of Saha-CATH3 was highly selective for C. neofor-
mans, which is unusual as cathelicidins generally have broad activity more similar to Saha-CATH5. Furthermore, 
Saha-CATH3 was not expressed in the lung, a common site of infection for C. neoformans in other marsupials 
such as koalas34. Further research is required to identify the mechanism of devil cathelicidin antimicrobial activ-
ity, which most likely involves electrostatic interaction and formation of trans-membrane pores similar to euthe-
rian cathelicidins1. MIC results presented in Table 2 are based on clinical isolates from humans, livestock and 
domestic animals as devil isolates were not available. Given this, the activity of devil cathelicidins may differ when

tested against devil bacteria due to host-pathogen co-evolution and development of resistance to cathelicidins. 
The possibility of resistance is an important aspect which warrants further investigation.
The Tasmanian devil pouch contains diverse microbial flora as seen in Fig. 3. Previous studies in the tammar 
wallaby and quokka have shown that the number of gram negative bacteria such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa23,35 
decrease in the pouch prior to the birth of young. A significant decrease in the abundance of gram-negative bac-
teria at the level of Leptotrichiaceae, Porphyromonas and Pasteurellaceae was observed in the pouch of lactating 
devils, compared to non-lactating. Except for Pasteurella, bacteria from these families were not included in our 
tests and devil cathelicidins were unable to kill P. multocida. Saha-CATH5 and 6 are expressed in the pouch and 
killed Streptococcus identified in the pouch microbiome32. In addition, Saha-CATH5 and 6 are expressed in the 
mouth mucosa and may be transferred to the pouch as the mother licks the area. Tasmanian devils and other 
dasyurid marsupials have been observed grooming the urogenital area and pouch prior to and after birth36,37.
Interestingly, Saha-CATH3, 5 and 6 cluster together in the phylogenetic tree and are relatively distant from 
Saha-CATH1, 2 and 4 which did not show antimicrobial activity. This suggests that Saha-CATH3, 5 and 6 are par-
alogs resulted from more recent duplications in the Tasmanian devil lineage and have undergone lineage-specific 
diversification. This may have been driven by devils responding to species-specific pathogen pressures and the 
need to protect naive young through the evolution of highly variable cathelicidins. Tasmanian devil mature pep-
tides are highly variable and share only 40% similarity with tammar wallaby cathelicidins. In contrast, eutherians 
such as pigs share up to 94% similarity in this domain.
In addition to their antimicrobial role in the pouch and milk, devil cathelicidins expressed in the gut, mouth 
and skin may be involved in epithelial defence at these sites. The devil gut microbiome contains populations of 
Pseudomonas and Streptococcus32, both of which are killed by Saha-CATH5 and 6 expressed in the small intestine. 
Saha-CATH5 and 6 are also expressed in the mouth mucosa and are able to kill Streptococcus species identified in

and fungi, expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Saha-CATH1, 2 and 4 did not show 
antimicrobial activity at the concentrations tested and hence are not included in the table. The MIC values for 
aampicillin, btetracycline and cfluconazole fell within the acceptable limit for ATCC strains according to CLSI 
guidelines. *denotes animal isolate, otherwise all other bacteria are human clinical isolates or ATCC strains.

the oral microbiome32. Similar to Saha-CATH5 and 6, Saha-CATH1, 2 and 4 were expressed in all tissues tested 
yet did not kill pathogens or human cells. Amongst these peptides Saha-CATH2 has an interesting expression 
profile, as unlike all other devil cathelicidins, shows lowest levels of expression within the spleen yet is most 
highly expressed in the pouch. As such, Saha-CATH1, 2 and 4 may play a role in innate immunity in devils. This 
hypothesis is supported by phylogenetic analysis which shows that Saha-CATH1 and 2 cluster with other tammar 
wallaby and opossum cathelicidins, in a sister clade to platypus cathelicidins. As these genes have been conserved 
for over 70 million years of evolution30, they must have an essential function in the marsupial and monotreme 
immune systems. In eutherians, cathelicidins interact with immune cells to activate, suppress and/or enhance 
the immune system1. Cathelicidins form chemotactic gradients to attract immune cells38. They also induce and 
suppress the release of pro-inflammatory mediators38,39, and are involved in wound healing40 and angiogenesis10. 
We propose they have similar activities in marsupials.
Cytotoxicity often hinders the pipeline of progression of peptides to drugs. Non-specific activity against mam-
malian cells is a common feature of the human cathelicidin LL-3741. Cytotoxicity has not been explored in mar-
supial cathelicidins until now. Tasmanian devil Saha-CATH5 and 6 had non-specific toxicity against a human 
cell line. While overall mammalian cell membranes are zwitterionic, they contain a large number of negatively 
charged glycoproteins and glycolipids which could interact with the positively charged peptide5. However, the

concentrations of Saha-CATH5 and 6 which are toxic to human cells is far higher than that which is required 
to kill bacteria and fungi. This is most likely because bacterial and fungal cell membranes carry a more negative 
charge due to the presence of negative lipopolysaccharides or techoic acids42.
Tasmanian devil cathelicidins Saha-CATH5 and 6 are potential candidates for drug development. Their 
broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and ability to kill MRSA and VREF could translate into numerous thera-
peutic applications. Their non-specific activity against mammalian cells may be reduced or eliminated through 
identification of active sites within the peptide which are essential for antimicrobial activity and by modification 
of areas contributing to toxicity. The specificity of Saha-CATH3 for fungal membranes and lack of toxicity to 
mammalian cells is promising for future development of a novel antifungal drug.
Methods
Detailed methods are provided in the Supplementary information. Briefly, Tasmanian devil cathelicidins were 
mined from the Sarcophilus harrisii reference genome version 7.0 2011 on Ensembl using tammar wallaby and 
opossum cathelicidins as BLAST query sequences. Devil cathelicidins were aligned to other marsupial and euthe-
rian cathelicidins using ClustalW43, and phylogenetic analysis was performed with nucleotide alignment using 
neighbour-joining method in MEGA5.244.
Tissue expression of devil cathelicidin prepropeptides was determined by real-time PCR on a range of secretory, 
immune, reproductive, gastrointestinal and respiratory tissues, as well as BLAST searches of the milk transcriptome31. 
Opportunistic tissue samples for real-time PCR were collected from Taronga Zoo (Sydney) from devils which were 
subject to euthanasia due to old age and advanced disease. The mature peptides of all six devil cathelicidins were 
synthesised by ChinaPeptides Co. Ltd. and their antimicrobial activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens deter-
mined by broth microdilution susceptibility assay according to clinical laboratory standards institute guidelines. 
Antimicrobial activity was expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Cytotoxicity was assessed in 
the human cell line A549 and haemolytic activity determined against human blood. Statistical significance of pep-
tide effect on cell survival in comparison to the untreated control was calculated using a one sample t-test. Pouch 
microbiome analysis was performed on swabs from the pouch of lactating and non-lactating devils to detect changes 
in microbe populations. Pouch swab collection was carried out in accordance with the Save the Tasmanian Devil 
Program and was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney (permit number 681).
Conclusion
The Tasmanian devil has a broad repertoire of cathelicidins which likely evolved to protect their immunologically 
naive young. Their wide expression profile and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggests devil cathelicidins 
are involved in epithelial defence in the pouch and at other sites on the body. In addition, devil cathelicidins may 
provide passive immunity to the young via the milk and could modulate immune responses to enhance protec-
tion during immune development in the pouch. Further research is required to characterise the immunomodu-
latory properties of devil cathelicidins.
