SUMMARY
Spinal motor axons traverse large distances to innervate target muscles, thus requiring local control of cellular events for proper func-
tioning. To interrogate axon-specific processes we developed Axon-seq, a refined method incorporating microfluidics, RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq), and bioinformatic quality control. We show that the axonal transcriptome is distinct from that of somas and contains fewer
genes. We identified 3,500–5,000 transcripts in mouse and human stem cell-derived spinal motor axons, most of which are required for
oxidative energy production and ribogenesis. Axons contained transcription factor mRNAs, e.g., Ybx1, with implications for local
functions. As motor axons degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we investigated their response to the SOD1G93A mutation,
identifying 121 ALS-dysregulated transcripts. Several of these are implicated in axonal function, including Nrp1, Dbn1, and Nek1, a
known ALS-causing gene. In conclusion, Axon-seq provides an improved method for RNA-seq of axons, increasing our understanding
of peripheral axon biology and identifying therapeutic targets in motor neuron disease.
INTRODUCTION
Spinal motor neurons (MNs) are highly polarized cells.
Their somas and dendrites are located in the spinal cord,
while their axons traverse the body and connect to mus-
cle fibers. The large distance between the MN soma and
its synapse implies that the distal axon must contain a
microenvironment able to independently respond to in-
ternal and external triggers. Vesicles containing proteins
and RNAs travel slowly, at 0.1–10 mm per day (Lasek
et al., 1984). Thus, protein transport alone does not suf-
fice to sustain the dynamics of the axon and synapse.
Local synaptic translation is important for temporal con-
trol of protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity (Holt
and Schuman, 2013).
Motor axons and their specialized synapses with mus-
cle, termed neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), are primary
targets in the lethal disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS). MNs undergo progressive degeneration in ALS,
resulting in denervation of muscle, paralysis, and ulti-
mately death at 3–5 years post-diagnosis (Swinnen and
Robberecht,
2014).
Notably,
MNs
follow
a
distinct
‘‘dying-back’’ pattern of degeneration in ALS. Muscle
denervation and axonal retraction occur before MN
somas in the spinal cord are lost, implying that the
NMJ is a highly vulnerable entity of the MN (Comley
et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2004). Mutations in several
genes, including SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, and FUS, cause
ALS (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011; Kwiatkowski et al.,
2009; Rosen et al., 1993; Sreedharan et al., 2008;
Vance et al., 2009). However, expression of these genes
is not MN restricted. Why and how MNs are selectively
affected in ALS is unclear. Studying the RNA composition
of the distal MN axon may illuminate mechanisms
driving the specific dying-back degeneration observed
in ALS.
Previous efforts to isolate axons in vitro have used well
insets, Campenot chambers, or microfluidic devices (Boy-
den, 1962; Campenot, 1977; Taylor et al., 2005). While
these can separate axons from somas, residual cross-
contamination between compartments can still occur.
Thus, axonal fractions can be contaminated with other
cellular components or non-neuronal cells. In this way,
RNA-sequencing efforts aimed at isolating the axonal
transcriptome (Briese et al., 2016; Minis et al., 2014; Ro-
tem et al., 2017; Saal et al., 2014) can be easily under-
mined if the purity of the axonal fractions is not carefully
examined. To accurately investigate motor axon mRNA
composition and its modulation in ALS we developed
Axon-seq, an application of our spatial single-cell RNA-
sequencing technique (Nichterwitz et al., 2016) to micro-
fluidic
devices
housing
mouse
embryonic
stem
cell
(mESC)-derived MNs. In contrast to previous methods,
Axon-seq does not require RNA isolation and allows
high sensitivity and cost-efficient sequencing from a sin-
gle microfluidic device. Importantly, Axon-seq utilizes a
stringent and sensitive bioinformatic quality control
(QC) step that identifies samples containing trace levels
of mRNA from undesired cell somas, effectively elimi-
nating all cellular cross-contamination.

 RESULTS
Axon-Seq Is a Refined Method that Enables RNA
Sequencing of Axons from a Single Microfluidic
Device
To investigate transcriptional changes in motor axons in
health and ALS we used mESC-derived MNs (Wichterle
et al., 2002) from a control Hb9-GFP line or cells overex-
pressing the human mutated SOD1G93A protein. We first
confirmed the MN subtype identity of our cultures through
bulk RNA sequencing and cross-comparison with single
MNs (Nichterwitz et al., 2016). We observed expression of
the MN transcription factors (TFs) Isl1 and Foxp1 in our cul-
tures (Figure S1A), indicating that MNs of a lateral motor
column (LMC) identity were generated (Dasen et al.,
2008). mRNAs of the Hox1–8 families were detected, which
define a cervical to thoracic spinal identity as well as brain-
stem MNs. Expression of Phox2b confirmed that a propor-
tion of brain-stem MNs were generated in addition to spinal
MNs (Figure S1A). After being plated in microfluidic de-
vices, motor axons were recruited to the vacant chamber
by a gradient of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor
(GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Fig-
ures 1A and 1F). An initial concentration of 50 ng/mL of
GDNF/BDNF was followed by a lower concentration of
5 ng/mL, once axons had crossed the microchannels, to
avoid growth cone collapse (Figure 1A). The HB9-eGFP re-
porter signal was detectable in motor axons and in somas
where it co-localized with Islet1/2 (Figure 1B). We next
stained for Map2 and Mapt (Tau) (Figures 1C, 1D, and
S1B). In mature neurons, Map2 labels dendrites, while Tau
labels axons (Garner et al., 1988; Litman et al., 1993). The
majority of processes crossing the channels were Tau posi-
tive, while a minority were Map2 positive. Thus, axonal pro-
cesses were enriched compared with dendrites. MN cultures
derived from mESCs also contain interneurons. However,
since 90.75% ± 4.8% of Tau+ processes were Hb9-GFP+
and only a very low proportion of GFP-negative (and Tau-
positive) axons appeared in the axonal compartment, we
from here on refer to axonal preparations as motor axons.
Adding different volumes to the compartments generates
a fluid flow that counteracts diffusion (Mills et al., 2018;
Taylor et al., 2005). Using this principle, axonal samples
were lysed without affecting the soma compartment (Fig-
ure 1G). Each compartment was lysed using 2% Triton
X-100 in water, eliminating an RNA purification step. To
allow sequencing of individual devices, we performed a
vacuum centrifugation concentration step. This allowed
using the entire lysate for cDNA library preparation. We
then conducted RNA-seq on axonal and soma samples
from individual devices using the Smart-seq2 protocol (Pi-
celli et al., 2013) with minor modifications (Nichterwitz
et al., 2016).
To be included in bioinformatics analysis, samples
required >300,000 mapped reads, >0.4 correlation to at
least one other sample, and >2,500 detected genes. We
next implemented a crucial bioinformatic quality control
(Axon-seq QC), excluding axon samples with trace levels
of soma contamination. Here, we performed principal-
component analysis (PCA) based on all expressed genes.
The PC1 reflected the number of detected genes. Axonal
transcriptomes occupied the lower ranges and somatoden-
dritic samples occupied the higher ranges (Figure 1I). Three
axonal samples were intermediate, with >7,500 detected
genes, and likely contaminated with one or more somas
and were discarded. Remaining high-quality axon samples
contained �3,500 detected genes at >1 reads per kilobase of
transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) and 5,000 de-
tected genes at >0.1 RPKM, while somatodendritic samples
contained approximately three times these numbers (Fig-
ure 1H). Axonal samples also displayed fewer detected
genes compared to single MNs (Nichterwitz et al., 2016)
(Figure S1F). Interestingly, despite this difference, the
cDNA yields were comparable between axonal samples
and single MNs (Figure S1E), suggesting that (1) the
cDNA yield from all axons in a microfluidic device ap-
proaches that of one or two cells, and (2) low numbers of
detected genes in these samples are not a technical artifact,
but a trait unique to axons. Given that Axon-seq libraries
display lower numbers of detected genes than do single
MNs, a single contaminating cell has the potential to dras-
tically alter the readout of an axonal library. We find that
consideration of the number of detected genes is perfectly
suited to identifying contaminated samples, allowing
further downstream analysis on only pure axonal samples.
After QC, we sought to compare our dataset with previ-
ously published methods, selecting two RNA-seq studies
(Table S1) that used either well insets (Rotem et al., 2017)
or single microfluidic devices (Briese et al., 2016) to isolate
motor axon transcriptomes. Both these studies display
good-quality data and describe enrichment of axonal tran-
scripts. Expression of neuronal markers in all samples was
visualized in a heatmap, including, e.g., neurofilaments,
peripherin, Mapt, Gap43, and the glial markers Gfap,
Aqp4, Eaat1, Iba1, Ccl3, Pdgfra, Sox10, and Mog (Figure 1J).
This clearly demonstrates that our Axon-seq samples pass-
ing QC expressed robust levels of neuronal and axonal
markers. It also showed that our samples were devoid of
glial markers and the proliferative marker Ki67, which
were in fact present in all previously published axon
sequencing samples (Figure 1J). Furthermore, our axon
samples clustered away from somatodendritic samples
and our cross-contaminated axon samples, while axon
and soma samples from previous studies were intermingled
(Figure 1J). Further cross-comparison of our axon samples
with data derived from purified neuronal samples (Zhang

 et al., 2014) confirmed their purity (Figure S1D). Impor-
tantly, our Axon-seq samples expectedly displayed a far
lower number of detected genes than the previously pub-
lished axon samples (Figure 1J). Thus, samples displaying
even small levels of soma contamination were successfully
identified through application of Axon-seq QC.
In summary, our analysis demonstrates the importance
of extensive QC of axon transcriptome data with particular
consideration for the number of detected genes and pre-
sents Axon-seq as a robust and significantly improved
method for RNA-seq of axonal fractions from individual
microfluidic devices with sensitivity similar to that of sin-
gle-cell sequencing.
Axons Have a Unique Transcriptional Profile and Are
Particularly Enriched in Transcripts Important for
Mitochondrial and Ribosomal Functions
We next sought to compare the transcriptome of axonal
fractions with that of somatodendritic fractions. When
transcripts present in at least 3 of 5 samples were consid-
ered, the axonal transcriptome comprised 4,238 genes
(Table S2). Between axons and somas, 10,406 genes
were differentially expressed. The majority of these
(9,762) were soma enriched, while 644 transcripts were
axon enriched (Table S2). Moreover, analysis of the top
100 differentially expressed genes in axons and somas
clearly demonstrated that axons are not simply diluted
somas, but instead have a unique mRNA profile (Figures
S1G and S1H). PCA based on all expressed genes clearly
distinguished axons from somas, with PC1 explaining
41.7% of the variance (Figure 2A). The top 20 genes
causing PC1-negative loading, and thereby axonal iden-
tity, included several genes involved in the mitochon-
drial respiratory chain (Cox6a1, Cox6b1, Cox8a, Cox4i1,
Ndufa3, Ndufa7, Ndufb9, Ndufb11), mitochondrial ATP
synthesis (Atp5k, Atp5j2), ribosome subunits and tran-
scriptional elongation (Rpl41, Tceb2), cytoskeleton orga-
nization (Tmsb10), copper delivery (Atox1), and mRNA
splicing (Ybx1) (Figure 2B). PC1-positive loading (Fig-
ure 2A) was heavily influenced by transcripts present
solely in somas. In total, 2,903 genes expressed at an
average RPKM of >1 in somas were undetectable in axons
(Figure S1H). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on
axon-enriched genes uncovered pathways related to local
translation (Figures 2C and 2D), mitochondrial oxidative
energy production (Figure 2E), and nonsense-mediated
decay (Figure 2F). Interestingly, both nuclear- and mito-
chondrial-encoded transcripts were enriched in axons
(Figures 2G and 2H), but the 10 most abundant energy
production-related transcripts in axons were nuclear-en-
coded transcripts (Figure 2I).
To confirmaxonallocalization ofparticular transcripts we
conducted in situ hybridization experiments using RNA-
scope. Negative (dapB) and positive (Ubc, Polr2a, and Ppib,
poly(A)) control probes demonstrated the specificity of
the method (Figures S2A–S2C). We confirmed Cox6a1
mRNA, which is part of the electron transport chain, to be
localized to motor axons (Figure 2J) and somas (Figure S2D).
Immunocytochemistry of motor axons demonstrated that
also the Cox6a1 protein was readily detected in axons
(Figure 2K).
In summary, our data show that axons of growing MNs
are enriched for mRNAs related to ribosomes and oxidative
phosphorylation, a large majority of which are mitochondri-
ally produced. The distal axon compartment can thereby
sustain local translation machinery and high energy meta-
bolism, reflecting the enormous energy demands of growing
axons.
Motor Axons Show a Unique Transcription Factor
Profile
Analysis of the top 50 most prevalent TF mRNAs in each of
the two compartments uncovered
16 common TFs,
including Ybx1, Carhsp1, and Sub1 (Figures 3A and 3B).
The majority of soma-enriched TF mRNAs were more abun-
dant in somas than the most axon-enriched TFs were in
axons (Figure 3B). However, 5 of the 10 most abundant
axonal TF mRNAs were significantly enriched in this
compartment
compared
to
somas,
including
Ybx1,
Carhsp1, Pbx4, Hmga1, and Zfp580 (Figure 3C). The enrich-
ment of Ybx1 (Y-box binding protein 1, p < 0.001) (Fig-
ure 3C) was particularly compelling since Ybx1 partakes
in, e.g., pre-mRNA transcription and splicing, mRNA pack-
aging, and regulation of mRNA stability and translation
(Lyabin et al., 2014a, 2014b). RNAscope confirmed the
presence of Ybx1 mRNA in Hb9-GFP+ motor axons (Fig-
ure 3D). Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that also
the Ybx1 protein was localized to motor axons (Figure 3E),

 strengthening a possible role for Ybx1 in supporting local
regulation of distal axonal processes.
In summary, axons show a unique TF profile, reflecting
specific functions in this compartment, that could poten-
tially function as communication signals between somas
and axons.
Cross-Comparison of Axonal Datasets across Neuronal
Subtypes Reveals Both Motor Neuron-Enriched and
Pan-Neuronal Axon mRNA Repertoires
To understand which mRNAs are specific to motor axons
versus transcripts defining growing axons in general, we
compared our Axon-seq motor axon data with a published
axon dataset derived from primary embryonic mouse MNs
(Briese et al., 2016), and with primary embryonic mouse
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Minis et al., 2014). In both com-
parisons, Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis on the over-
lapping genes revealed oxidative energy production, trans-
lation, and localization of proteins to mitochondria and
ribosomes (Figures S3A and S3B, Table S3). Both primary
motor axon and primary DRG axon datasets contained a
large number of proliferative and glial marker sets that
were absent from our Axon-seq data (Figures 1J and S3C).
This was further confirmed by GO term analysis of the tran-
scriptomes unique to Briese et al. and Minis et al., which in
both cases identified biological processes involved in cell
division (Figures S3A and S3B, Table S3).
Notably, Cox6a1 and Ybx1, abundant mRNAs in motor
axons, were present across neuron types. Furthermore, a
low-expressed, but important transcript, Nrp1, was also
pan-neuronal (Figures S3A and S3B). We could confirm
the presence of this transcript in our motor axons using
RNAscope (Figure S3D).
In summary, our analyses have identified a general
axonal transcriptional signature and defined a unique
motor axon code, which gives clues to function as well as
susceptibility to disease.
Axon-Seq of Human Motor Axons Identifies a
Common Transcriptome with Mouse Motor Axons
We further applied Axon-seq to human MNs derived from
two control induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines.
Human motor axons could be readily recruited across
microgrooves using a BDNF/GDNF gradient (Figure 4A).
In a PCA plot, axonal samples clearly separated from hu-
man somatodendritic fractions (Figure 4B). Considering
transcripts present in at least three axonal samples, the hu-
man motor axonal transcriptome comprised 2,793 genes
(Table S4). The number of detected genes was on average
2,611 ± 286 at RPKM >1, and 3,495 ± 460 at RPKM >0.1
(Figure 4C). Human motor axons were strongly enriched
for cytoskeletal transcripts such as NEFL, NEFM, and
GAP43
and
showed
negligible
glial
contamination
(Figure 4D).
Analysis of the overlap between the human motor axon
transcriptome and the common mouse motor axon tran-
scriptome (Figure S3A) identified 1,273 common genes.
GO term analysis of these genes revealed energy produc-
tion, translation, and nonsense-mediated decay as en-
riched processes (Figure 4E, Table S4).
The ALS-Causative Mutation SOD1G93A Modulates the
Axonal Transcriptome
Motor axons are early pathological targets in the lethal
MN disease ALS, where die-back pathology begins in the
distal axon. We therefore investigated if overexpression
of an ALS-causative mutation (SOD1G93A) would induce
changes in the axonal transcriptome. MNs derived from
mESCs overexpressing human SOD1G93A have high levels
of SOD1 protein in somas and axons (Figure 5A). Axon-
seq of SOD1G93A axons identified 4,479.5 ± 1,327.7 genes
at RPKM >1 and 6,568.8 ± 2,293.1 at RPKM >0.1 (Table
S5). Human mutant SOD1 was highly expressed in somas
and axons (Figure 5B), 10-fold higher than mouse Sod1
(Figure 5C). Mutant SOD1 overexpression resulted in dif-
ferential expression of 121 genes in axons compared to
the control line, of which 96 were upregulated in
SOD1G93A axons, while 25 were reduced (Figure 5D, Table
S5). Strikingly, only two of these genes (Zfand1 and
Zfp688) were also dysregulated in the SOD1G93A soma
compartment (Table S5). Many of the dysregulated genes
were previously implicated in neuronal function and in
ALS
pathology
(Figure
5E).
We
found
that
several
transcripts paramount for proper axon function were
downregulated or completely absent in SOD1G93A axons,
including Dbn1 (McIntyre et al., 2010; Sharma et al.,
2012), Nrp1 (Telley et al., 2016), and Mgrn1 (Upadhyay
et al., 2016). Some transcripts that were upregulated in
SOD1G93A axons appear detrimental, including Adgr1
(Zuko et al., 2016) (Figure 5E). In addition, upregulation
transcripts reveals an axonal enrichment for both. Differential expression was performed on the five axon samples that passed QC and
13 soma samples, as visualized in (A) and (B).

 of some transcripts in ALS could reflect compensatory
mechanisms preventing axon damage or dysfunction in
SOD1G93A axons, including Dhx36 (Bicker et al., 2013),
the ALS-causative gene Nek1 (Kenna et al., 2016), F3 (Biz-
zoca et al., 2009), Rbpms (Hornberg et al., 2013), and

 Finally, we wanted to elucidate if any of the transcripts
that were dysregulated by the SOD1G93A mutation were
affected across MN diseases. We therefore compared our
RNA sequencing data with a microarray dataset on motor
axons in which the Smn gene was knocked down to model
the disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (Saal et al.,
2014). Sixteen transcripts were regulated across the two
disease models. However, 15 genes were regulated in the
opposite direction in the ALS and SMA disease models,
while one transcript, the axon guidance receptor Neuropi-
lin 1 (Nrp1), was downregulated in both MN disease models
(Figure 5F).
In summary, application of Axon-seq methodology to a
mutant SOD1 overexpression model of ALS identified
axonal dysregulation of 121 transcripts, some of which
appear detrimental, while others may indicate compensa-
tory mechanisms to counteract any induced dysfunction.
Nrp1 was downregulated in motor axons across ALS and
SMA disease models and might have implications for
pathology.
DISCUSSION
Axonal RNA biology is increasingly implicated in ALS. We
developed Axon-seq, an improved method for studying
the transcriptome of axons. With careful bioinformatic
QC, this cost-effective and sensitive method can reliably
yield
high-quality
and
pure
axonal
transcriptomes.
Axon-seq was successfully applied to mouse and human
MNs from multiple pluripotent sources, cultured in
microfluidic devices. We detected 3,500–5,000 mRNA
transcripts in axons, which were enriched for mitochon-
drial energy production and ribosomes, reflecting a high

of local protein translation. Indeed, protein synthesis in
chick sympathetic axons accounts for 5% of total cellular
protein synthesis (Lee and Hollenbeck, 2003). Transcripts
for all essential subunits of the proteasome system
(Psma1–7 and Psmb1–7) were present in motor axons (Ta-
ble S2). Many regulatory subunits and chaperones were
also detected, implying extensive regulation of protein

 degradation in axons. Given that small amounts of RNA
can be translated into multiple protein copies, maintaining
an mRNA pool poised for translation in neuronal processes
saves energy and increases capacity for a rapid response.
The two largest mRNA groups identified in axons
through GO term analysis and GSEA were mitochondrially
encoded mRNAs involved in energy production and mitor-
ibosomes. As mitochondria are abundant in axons, and
assuming no bias in soma to axon transport of mitochond-
rially encoded RNAs, we speculate that these mRNAs are
locally transcribed. This is consistent with our finding
that nuclear-encoded mRNAs for energy production (in
particular nuclear-encoded ribosomal RNAs) were less
abundant in axons compared with mitochondrially en-
coded genes and in agreement with previous reports
describing a predominance of mitochondrially encoded
genes in DRG axons (Minis et al., 2014). Mitochondria
can replicate by fission in axons (Amiri and Hollenbeck,
2008), which would be facilitated by local translation of
mitochondrially encoded proteins. In fact, our data suggest
that the complete mRNA library required for mitochon-
drial replicative fission and function is present in axons.
TFs define neuronal identity in early development and
are later often needed for survival (Kadkhodaei et al.,
2013; Sgado et al., 2006). Some TFs were recently shown
to function outside the soma and to be important in
neuronal circuitry plasticity, axon pathfinding, and neuro-
protection (Sugiyama et al., 2008; Torero Ibad et al., 2011;
Wizenmann et al., 2009). Multiple studies identified
axonal mRNAs for TFs, in addition to nuclear transport
machinery and the nuclear envelope, whose local transla-
tion and subsequent signaling to the soma appear vital to
axon maintenance and survival in injury paradigms (Ben-
Yaakov et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2008; Hanz et al., 2003; Ji
and Jaffrey, 2012; Yoon et al., 2012). We detected a specific
set of TF mRNAs enriched in distal motor axons compared
with somas, including the RNA-binding factor Ybx1. YBX1
has roles in binding and stabilizing cytoplasmic mRNAs. It
also regulates translation by affecting the interaction
between eukaryotic initiation factors and mRNAs (Lyabin
et al., 2014b). YBX1 can also mediate anterograde axonal
transport of Cox4 mRNA, encoding a mitochondrial pro-
tein (Kar et al., 2017). In this function YBX1 interacts
with FUS, an RNA binding protein and known ALS-causing
gene (Groen et al., 2013). We expect that YBX1 and other
axonally located TFs will emerge as important mediators
of communication between somas and axons.
Dying-back

implies
that the distal axonal compartment undergoes early path-
ological changes in ALS. Axon-seq on motor axons
harboring the ALS-causative mutation SOD1G93A uncov-
ered differential expression of 121 mRNAs, several of which
are crucial for neuronal function, axon maintenance, and
growth. For example, a number of the transcripts that
were upregulated in SOD1G93A axons appear detrimental,
including Adgr1, which can induce apoptosis and cause
reduction in neurite outgrowth (Zuko et al., 2016). Multi-
ple transcripts that are important for axon function were
downregulated or absent in SOD1G93A axons, including
Dbn1, which is important for axon initiation, growth,
and guidance (McIntyre et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2012);
Nrp1, a semaphorin receptor involved in both axon guid-
ance and subcellular target recognition (Telley et al.,
2016); and Mgrn1, a ubiquitin ligase, which appears impor-
tant for mitochondrial function and neuronal survival (Up-
adhyay et al., 2016). Mgrn1 is downregulated in SOD1 mice
and is recruited to SOD1-positive inclusions (Chhangani
et al., 2016). Nrp1 acts as an axonal attractant during devel-
opment (Chauvet et al., 2007) and is important for limb
innervation (Huettl et al., 2011). The downregulation of
Nrp1 in our study appears to align with a loss of NMJ
function. Nonetheless, it was recently shown that intraper-
itoneal delivery of an anti-Nrp1 antibody to SOD1G93A
mice could lengthen their lifespan and reduce NMJ dener-
vation (Venkova et al., 2014). Although it is not evident if
downregulation of Nrp1 within MNs induced the rescue in
the Venkova et al. study, this could mean that the downre-
gulation we see may be a beneficial compensatory event,
but this remains to be further investigated.
Nrp1 was downregulated in motor axons across SMA and
ALS disease models. While SMA is generally an early-onset
MN disease and ALS is a disease correlated with aging, both
are characterized by early motor axon pathology (Ci-
fuentes-Diaz et al., 2002; Comley et al., 2016; Fischer
et al., 2004). Our data combined with published studies
indicate that NRP1 might be an early target in ALS pathol-
ogy and that it potentially could be modulated in both dis-
eases with beneficial results.
Interestingly, the SOD1 mutation caused an upregula-
tion of transcripts that could be beneficial to axons,
possibly through compensatory mechanisms aimed at
preventing axon damage or dysfunction. These transcripts
with potential beneficial properties included Dhx36, an
ATP-dependent helicase, which mediates dendritic locali-
zation of miR-134, affecting synaptic protein synthesis
and plasticity (Bicker et al., 2013); F3, a cell adhesion
molecule involved in neurite outgrowth (Bizzoca et al.,
2009); Rbpms, an RNA-binding protein with importance
for RNA-granule localization and dendritic tree com-
plexity (Hornberg et al., 2013); Farp1, a marker for LMC
MNs that positively regulates dendrite growth (Zhuang
et al., 2009); and Nek1, which has a putative role in
microtubule stability, neuronal morphology, and axon
polarity. Interestingly, loss-of-function variants of NEK1
confer susceptibility to ALS in humans (Kenna et al.,
2016).

 In summary, we have developed Axon-seq, a refined
method with high sensitivity for RNA sequencing of axons,
which contains crucial bioinformatic QC steps to identify
high-quality axonal transcriptomes. We demonstrate that
mouse and human motor axons contain a smaller and
distinct transcriptome compared to somas, with high
enrichment for transcripts required for local energy pro-
duction and protein translation. We also show that the
majority of motor axonal genes are shared with axons of
other neuronal types, emphasizing their importance in
general axonal biology. Finally, motor axons expressing
ALS-causative SOD1G93A displayed both down- and upre-
gulation of key transcripts involved in axonal growth and
guidance, as well as neuronal survival.
Due to its robustness, sensitivity, and cost effectiveness,
Axon-seq is a method of broad utility for the study of
RNA dynamics in any polarized cell. Here we successfully
applied Axon-seq to human motor axons, demonstrating
its usefulness for the study of human neuronal processes
in stem cell-derived in vitro systems. Thus far, axons of
human stem cell-derived glutamatergic neurons have
been isolated in microfluidic devices and screened using
microarrays (Bigler et al., 2017), but not using more
advanced RNA-seq methods. Microfluidic devices have
also been used to investigate axonal trafficking deficits
and axonal degeneration in ALS patient stem cell-derived
MNs (Naumann et al., 2018). Here, Axon-seq can provide
an additional layer of transcriptome data, facilitating
identification
of
networks
underlying
pathological
changes in human motor axons. In our system, we studied
growing axons prior to formation of NMJs. Stage-specific
changes in the axonal mRNA repertoire were recently
identified in growing, pruning, and mature axons in mouse
retinal ganglion cells (Shigeoka et al., 2016). It is expected
that also the motor axon transcriptome is influenced by
the formation and maturity of the NMJ. Axon-seq could
be applied to a microfluidic system containing iPSC-
derived MNs and muscle to investigate such processes in
the context of the human NMJ and its instability in ALS.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Culturing of Mouse Motor Neurons in Microfluidic
Devices
Microfluidic devices (SND150, Xona Microfluidics) were attached
to sterilized cover glasses (28 mm diameter, Menzel Gla
¨ser) by dry-
ing them extensively and applying gentle force to seal them onto
the glass coverslips. Both compartments were coated overnight
with 15 mg/mL poly-L-ornithine (Sigma-Aldrich). The secondary
coating consisted of a mix of 2 mg/mL fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 10 mg/mL laminin (Sigma-Aldrich).
MNs were resuspended at 100,000 cells/mL and loaded into
the microchannel in a 5 mL droplet. At this point, neural differen-
tiation medium was supplemented with 10 ng/mL GDNF, BDNF,
ciliary neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3; 200 mM ascorbic
acid (Sigma-Aldrich); 100 nM retinoic acid (RA); and 2 mM 5-flu-
oro-20-deoxyuridine (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were allowed at least
30 min to attach, after which medium was added into the adjacent
wells. The axonal compartment was filled with similar medium
but containing 50 ng/mL GDNF and BDNF to facilitate axonal
recruitment. Volumes in the wells were adapted to ensure flow
across chambers to gradually provide medium and to establish a
flow and thus trophic factor gradient from the axonal to the so-
matic compartment. Media in the devices was changed daily.
Axonal recruitment was halted after 2 days. The concentrations
of GDNF and BDNF in the axonal compartment were reduced to
5 ng/mL. In the soma compartment, trophic factor concentrations
were doubled from this point onward, to 20 ng/mL. Additionally,
RA was no longer included in the media.
Culturing of Human Motor Neurons in Microfluidic
Devices
The use of human stem cell lines was approved by the regional
ethical review board in Stockholm, Sweden (Regionala Etikpro
¨v-
ningsna
¨mnden (EPN), Stockholm). For human MNs, devices
with 450 mm grooves were used (SND450, Xona Microfluidics).
The procedures were largely similar to those for culturing mouse
MNs in microfluidic devices, with the following exceptions.
Human MNs were plated at a lower density of 30,000 cells/mL
(150,000 cells/device). After dissociation, cells were plated in de-
vices in B27 medium supplemented with 5 mM Rock inhibitor,
200 mM ascorbic acid, and 10 mM DAPT. BDNF and GDNF
(10 ng/mL) were added to the somatodendritic compartment,
while 50 ng/mL BDNF and GDNF were added to the axonal
compartment for recruitment of motor axons. After 3 days in the
devices, DAPT was removed from the medium. BDNF and GDNF
levels were reduced to 10 ng/mL in the axonal compartment.
Harvesting, Library Preparation, and Sequencing
Cultures were harvested after 1 week (mouse) or 2 weeks (human)
in the microfluidic devices using 2% Triton X-100 (in water) and
1.5 U of RNase inhibitor (TaKaRa). Lysis solution (75 mL) was
flushed through the compartments, collected, and snap-frozen
on dry ice. Prior to library preparation, the volume of axonal
samples was reduced from 75 to 15 mL using a concentrator (Eppen-
dorf), and 10 mL of the lysate was used for reverse transcription.
Five microliters of the lysates from somatodendritic samples was
directly used for the reverse transcription reaction, carried out in
a final volume of 10 mL. Further steps were carried out as described
(Nichterwitz et al., 2016) and samples sequenced on Illumina
HiSeq2000 and 2500 platforms.
RNA-Seq Data Processing and Analysis
Sequencing reads were mapped to the mm10 (mouse) and the
hg38 (human) reference genome with HISAT version 2.0.3 (Kim
et al., 2015). Aligned reads were extracted and assigned using the
GenomicAlignments package (version 1.8.4, Lawrence et al.,
2013) in R, with the function summarizeOverlaps, mode set
to ‘‘union.’’ QC exclusion criteria were <300,000 (axons) or
<500,000 (somas) uniquely mapped reads, Spearman correlation

 to other samples <0.4 or <2,500 genes expressed at RPKM >0.1. To
ensure that high-quality axonal samples were not biologically
cross-contaminated with material from cell somas, during the
cell seeding process or the lysis, we conducted Spearman correla-
tion, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, and PCA of all samples
that passed the initial QC. Axonal samples that clustered with
soma samples in these analyses were removed. For the control
Hb9-GFP mESC line, MN soma samples (n = 13) and axon samples
(n = 8) were derived from a total of six independent experiments.
For the SOD1G93A-overexpressing mESC line, MN soma samples
(n = 10) and axon samples (n = 4) were derived from a total of six
independent experiments. Human MN soma samples (n = 7) and
axon samples (n = 6) were derived from two iPSC lines. The human
single MN analysis was based on n = 39.
