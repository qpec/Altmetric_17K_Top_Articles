Introduction
The exposed surfaces of metazoans are colonized with trillions of 
bacteria, fungi, and viruses, creating a diverse ecosystem known 
as the microbiota (1, 2). Of these surfaces, the gastrointestinal tract 
harbors the largest and most diverse population of microorgan-
isms, which have been shown to elicit positive influences on health. 
For example, the intestinal microbiota induces the generation of 
immunomodulatory factors that regulate intestinal inflammatory 
responses (3), cytoprotection (4), barrier integrity, and homeosta-
sis (5), as well as wound restitution (6). It is now clear that the gut 
microbiota influences not only the local immune response, but 
also contributes to immune responses distant from mucosal sur-
faces, including the CNS, joints, and lungs (3, 7–9). Surprisingly, 
the intestinal microbiota has also been found to influence bone 
homeostasis. Indeed, GF mice have increased bone mass, fewer 
CD4+ T cells and osteoclast precursors in the BM, and lower levels 
of osteoclastogenic cytokines (10). In addition, antibiotic adminis-
tration increases bone density in young mice (11, 12), while select 
probiotics blunt the bone loss that normally ensues following ova-
riectomy (ovx) (13–15). However, the molecular mechanisms that 
mediate and function in probiotic-induced host responses have 
not yet been fully characterized.
Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease 
that leads to bone fractures and disability. The disease stems 
mainly from the cessation of ovarian function, where declin-
ing estrogen levels result in the stimulation of bone resorption 
and — to a lesser extent — bone formation, leading a period of 
rapid bone loss (16). In addition, many genetic and nongenetic 
factors intensify the negative impact of estrogen deficiency on 
the skeleton (17, 18). In mice, the effects of estrogen depletion 
are modeled by ovx or by treatment with gonadotropin-releas-
ing hormone (GnRH) agonists (19, 20). At the cellular level, the 
central mechanism by which sex steroid deficiency induces bone 
loss is via an increase in osteoclast formation (21, 22) and osteo-
clast lifespan (23, 24). The primary driver of increased osteo-
clastogenesis is the enhanced production of the immune factors 
RANKL and TNF (25, 26). Many cell types have been shown to 
be generators of RANKL, including hemopoietic cells, T cells, 
B cells, osteoblastic cells, and osteocytes (27–29). In the mouse, 
osteocytes are probably the most relevant source of RANKL in 
estrogen-deficient mice (29). In humans, estrogen deficiency is 
associated with an expansion of RANKL- and TNF-expressing 
T cells and B cells (27, 28, 30, 31). The contributing influences 
of IL-1 and TNF in humans was underscored by reports showing 
that menopause increases the levels of both of these immune fac-
tors (32–35), while treatment with TNF and IL-1 inhibitors pre-
vents the increase in bone resorption that results from estrogen 
deficiency (36). Indeed, the causal role of TNF in ovx-induced 
bone loss in mice has been demonstrated in multiple models (37–
39), where the key mechanisms by which TNF stimulates bone 
A eubiotic microbiota influences many physiological processes in the metazoan host, including development and intestinal 
homeostasis. Here, we have shown that the intestinal microbiota modulates inflammatory responses caused by sex steroid 
deficiency, leading to trabecular bone loss. In murine models, sex steroid deficiency increased gut permeability, expanded 
Th17 cells, and upregulated the osteoclastogenic cytokines TNFα (TNF), RANKL, and IL-17 in the small intestine and the 
BM. In germ-free (GF) mice, sex steroid deficiency failed to increase osteoclastogenic cytokine production, stimulate bone 
resorption, and cause trabecular bone loss, demonstrating that the gut microbiota is central in sex steroid deficiency–
induced trabecular bone loss. Furthermore, we demonstrated that twice-weekly treatment of sex steroid–deficient mice 
with the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) or the commercially available probiotic supplement VSL#3 reduces 
gut permeability, dampens intestinal and BM inflammation, and completely protects against bone loss. In contrast, 
supplementation with a nonprobiotic strain of E. coli or a mutant LGG was not protective. Together, these data highlight the 
role that the gut luminal microbiota and increased gut permeability play in triggering inflammatory pathways that are critical 
for inducing bone loss in sex steroid–deficient mice. Our data further suggest that probiotics that decrease gut permeability 
have potential as a therapeutic strategy for postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Sex steroid deficiency–associated bone loss is 
microbiota dependent and prevented by probiotics

Results
Germ-free mice are protected against the bone loss induced by sex 
steroid deficiency. To investigate the role of the microbiota in sex 
steroid deficiency–induced bone loss, female C57BL/6J mice 
were raised in either conventional conditions (Conv.R mice), 
germ-free conditions (GF mice), or a GF environment until 4 
weeks of age and then recolonized with conventional microbiota 
(Col.GF mice). Since ovx is not technically feasible in GF condi-
tions, sex steroid deficiency was induced pharmacologically. All 
mice were administered the GnRH agonists Lupron Depot (375 
μg every 4 weeks) or control vehicle for 10 weeks, starting at 10 
weeks of age. Therefore, Col.GF mice were conventionalized 
with bacteria 6 weeks before starting the 10-week leuprolide 
treatment. Leuprolide causes a 4-week stimulation of sex steroid 
production due to the GnRH agonistic activity of this compound. 
This is followed by long-term blockade of ovarian sex steroid 
production due to blunted secretion of follicle-stimulating hor-
mone (FSH) and leuteinizing hormone (LH) secondary to desen-
sitization of GnRH receptors on the pituitary gland. At the end 
of the treatment period, leuprolide-induced hypogonadism was 
verified by the finding of a significant decrease in uterus weight 
compared with mice injected with vehicle only (Supplemental 
Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this arti-
cle; doi:10.1172/JCI86062DS1). Assessment of femoral bone 
structure by in vitro microcomputed tomography (μCT) revealed 
that trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was similar in all 
groups of vehicle-treated mice, although a trend toward higher 
BV/TV was observed in GF mice (Figure 1, A and B). Impor-
tantly, leuprolide failed to induce a loss of BV/TV in GF mice, 
while it caused a significant decrease in BV/TV in Conv.R mice 
and Col.GF mice, indicating that sex steroid deprivation induces 
cortical bone loss via a microbiota-dependent mechanism. By 
contrast, vehicle-treated GF mice had significantly more corti-
cal volume (Ct.V) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) compared with 
vehicle-treated conventionally raised or gnotobiotically colo-
nized mice (Figure 1, C and D). However, leuprolide treatment 
resulted in a similar loss of Ct.V and Ct.Th in all groups of mice. 
Assessment of parameters of trabecular structure revealed that 
vehicle-treated GF mice had higher trabecular number (Tb.N) 
(Figure 1E), lower trabecular space (Tb.Sp) (Figure 1F), and sim-
resorption were identified as the potentiation of RANKL activ-
ity (40, 41) and induction of Th17 cells (42–44). Th17 cells are 
an osteoclastogenic population of CD4+ T cells (45, 46) defined 
by the capacity to produce IL-17 (47). Th17 cells potently induce 
osteoclastogenesis by secreting IL-17A, RANKL, TNF, IL-1, and 
IL-6, along with low levels of IFNγ (48–50). IL-17A stimulates the 
release of RANKL by all osteoblastic cells including osteocytes 
(42, 51) and increases the osteoclastogenic activity of RANKL by 
upregulating RANK (52).
We proposed that T cell–produced TNF is required for ovx- 
induced bone loss based on the findings that no bone loss 
occurred and no increased TNF production was detected in T 
cell–null mice or mice depleted of T cells (40, 53). Furthermore 
bone loss did not occur in mice lacking T cell TNF production (37, 
40, 54, 55) or lacking the costimulatory molecule CD40L (53) or 
in mice treated with CTLA4-Ig, an agent that transmits an inhib-
itory signal to T cells (56). Clinical evidence corroborates the role 
of T cell–produced TNF in postmenopausal bone loss (30, 31). 
Mechanistically, ovx induces proliferation of conventional T cells 
via an antigen-dependent process (56, 57), thereby increasing the 
number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the BM and enhancing their 
production of TNF (37, 53). This process is driven by enhanced 
antigen presentation by macrophages and DCs (56, 57), although 
the nature of the involved antigen remains unknown. Because 
the T cells of ovx mice have similar features to T cells exposed to 
bacteria (58), we hypothesized that increased exposure to micro-
organisms provides the antigens required for T cell activation, 
and ensuing systemic immune responses required for sex steroid 
deficiency induced bone loss.
Herein, we show that sex steroid–depleted mice raised in GF 
conditions are protected against trabecular bone loss and that 
microbial recolonization of GF mice restores the capacity of sex 
steroid deficiency to induce bone loss. Moreover, we show that 
sex steroid deficiency resulted in increased epithelial barrier per-
meability and decreased expression of gut epithelial tight junc-
tion proteins. Strikingly, supplementation of the normal flora of 
sex steroid–depleted mice with the commonly used probiotics 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) or VSL#3 significantly tight-
ened intestinal barrier integrity and completely protected mice 
against sex steroid depletion–induced bone loss.

Determination of dynamic indices of bone formation revealed 
that the 3 experimental groups of vehicle-treated mice had similar 
mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR) and 
that leuprolide treatment did not increase MAR and BFR (Table 1 
and Figure 2B). However, leuprolide-treated GF mice exhibited sig-
nificantly lower MAR and BFR than leuprolide-treated Conv.R and 
Col.GF mice. Analysis of static indices of bone formation revealed 
similar findings, as all vehicle-treated mice exhibited no difference 
in the number of osteoblasts per BS (N.Ob/BS) or in the percentage of 
surfaces covered by osteoblasts (Ob.S/BS), while leuprolide-treated 
GF mice exhibited lower N.Ob/BS than leuprolide-treated conven-
tional and colonized mice (Table 1 and Figure 2B). However, leupro-
lide treatment increased N.Ob/BS in conventional mice but not in 
GF and colonized mice, while GF mice and control mice had sim-
ilar Ob.S/BS. Together, the data suggest that sex steroid–depleted 
mice lacking the microbiota have lower rates of compensatory 
bone formation than control sex steroid–depleted mice. Measure-
ments of the serum level of C-terminal telopeptide of collagen 
ilar trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) (Figure 1G) as compared with 
vehicle-treated Conv.R mice and Col.GF mice. Leuprolide treat-
ment did not alter Tb.N and Tb.Sp in any group of mice (Figure 1, 
E and F) and induced similar changes to Tb.Th in the 3 groups of 
mice (Figure 1G). Together, these data reveal that the microbiota 
has specific effects on cortical and trabecular bone volume and 
structure following sex steroid deprivation.
GF mice are protected against the increase in bone turnover 
induced by sex steroid deprivation. Analysis of femoral cancellous 
bone by quantitative histomorphometry revealed that the 3 groups 
of vehicle-treated mice had a similar number of osteoclasts (OCs) 
per bone surface (N.Oc/BS) and percentage of surfaces covered by 
OCs (Oc.S/BS), which are 2 indices of bone resorption (Table 1 and 
Figure 2A). However, leuprolide induced a significant increase in 
indices of bone resorption in Conv.R and Col.GF mice, but not in 
GF mice, compared with their respective vehicle controls (Table 
1 and Figure 2A), indicating that the microbiota is required for 
leuprolide to increase bone resorption.

In addition, leuprolide treatment upreg-
ulated the number of CD4+TNF+ cells, 
CD8+TNF+ cells, and Th17 cells (CD4+IL-17A+ 
cells) in Conv.R and Col.GF mice but not in 
GF mice (Figure 3, D–F). Furthermore, tran-
script numbers of the IL-17A–inducing tran-
scription factors Rora and Rorgt in BM CD4+ 
T cells (Figure 3, G and H) were all elevated 
in conventional and colonized mice — though 
not in GF mice — following leuprolide treat-
ment. Thus, because the signature inflam-
matory profile that occurs in response to sex 
steroid depletion was not observed in GF 
mice, our data support the hypothesis that gut 
microbiota–dependent bone loss is caused by 
microbiota-driven inflammatory signaling.
To support the concept that sex ste-
roid deprivation enhances inflammatory 
responses initiated by intestinal microbi-
ota, we measured the levels of osteoclasto-
genic cytokines within tissues of the small 
intestine (SI). Indeed, similar to responses 
in the BM, leuprolide treatment increased transcript levels of 
Tnf, Rankl, and Il17 in the SI of conventional and colonized mice 
but had no effects in the SI of GF mice (Figure 3, I–K), while it 
did not increase the mRNA levels of Ifng and Il4 in all groups 
(Supplemental Figure 2, C and D).
Since little information is available about the effect of sex 
steroid deprivation on intestinal cytokine production, in addi-
tion to inducing sex steroid deficiency by the administration of 
Leuprolide, a method feasible in a GF isolator, we also assessed 
the influence of ovx on intestinal cytokine production in Conv.R 
mice. Consistent with our findings following the dosing of 
leuprolide, analysis 4 weeks after surgery revealed that ovx 
resulted in higher number of TNF-, RANKL-, and IL-17–produc-
ing CD4+ T cells in the SI lamina propria (SILP) compared with 
sham-operated mice (Figure 3, L–N). Thus, we report compel-
ling evidence showing the proinflammatory effects of sex ste-
roid depletion within tissues of the BM and SI.
Sex steroid deprivation increases intestinal permeability. We 
investigated the extent to which sex steroid depletion augments 
(CTX), a marker for bone resorption, and of osteocalcin, a marker 
for bone formation, revealed that the 3 strains of vehicle-treated 
mice had similar rates of bone turnover (Figure 2, C and D). 
 
Leuprolide increased both CTX and osteocalcin levels in conven-
tional and colonized mice but not in GF mice. As a result, leuprolide- 
treated control mice had higher levels of markers of bone turnover 
compared with similarly treated GF mice.
The BM and the intestine of germ-free mice are protected against 
the increase in osteoclastogenic cytokines induced by sex steroid 
deprivation. Measurements of BM cytokines reveal that only in 
conventional and colonized mice did leuprolide increase the 
expression of the osteoclastogenic cytokines TNF, RANKL, and 
IL-17, whereas no significant increase in the expression of these 
cytokines were detected in leuprolide-treated GF mice (Figure 3, 
A–C). By contrast, leuprolide did not increase IFNγ and IL-4 in 
all groups of mice (Supplemental Figure 2, A and B). Similarly, 
leuprolide increased the mRNA levels of Rankl, Tnf, and Il17 in 
purified BM T cells of Conv.R and Col.GF mice but not in GF 
mice (Supplemental Figure 3).

pletely prevented the loss of BV/TV induced by ovx. In fact, at 
the end of the study, ovx mice treated with LGG or VSL#3 had 
BV/TV values similar to baseline and to those of vehicle-treated 
sham mice and significantly higher than those of vehicle-treated 
ovx mice. By contrast, ovx mice treated with E. coli or LGGM 
had lower BV/TV values compared with baseline and vehicle- 
treated sham mice but were not statistically different than 
those of vehicle-treated ovx mice (Figure 5A). Similarly, the 
changes in spinal Tb.Th, Tb.N, and Tb.Sp induced by ovx were 
completely prevented by LGG or VSL#3, partially prevented by 
LGGM, and not prevented at all by E. coli (Supplemental Figure 
4, A–C). Since in vivo measurements of the femur were beyond 
the capability of our scanner, the distal femur was analyzed by 
in vitro μCT using samples harvested at sacrifice. This analysis 
confirmed that LGG and VSL#3 completely prevented the loss 
of BV/TV induced by ovx, while LGGM and E. coli had no bone 
sparing activity (Figure 5B). In addition, LGG and VSL#3 had 
a partial protective effect against the loss of Ct.V induced by 
ovx (Figure 5C). The changes in Tb.Th, Tb.N, Tb.Sp, and Ct.Th 
induced by ovx in vehicle-treated mice were also prevented by 
LGG and VSL#3, partially prevented by LGGM treatment, and 
not prevented at all by E. coli (Supplemental Figure 4, D–G).
In our studies, markers of bone turnover proved to be more 
faithful and sensitive predictors to assess the effects of sex ste-
roid deficiency on bone turnover compared with bone histomor-
phometry. Due to these observations, we assessed the effects of 
probiotic feeding on bone turnover by measuring the serum lev-
els of CTX and osteocalcin. We found that ovx increased serum 
CTX levels in mice treated with vehicle, LGGM, and E. coli but 
not in those fed with LGG and VSL#3 (Figure 5D). As expected, 
ovx increased the serum levels of osteocalcin in vehicle-treated 
mice (Figure 5E). However, feeding of LGG or VSL#3 further 
increased bone formation in ovx mice, while treatment with 
LGGM or E. coli did not. Importantly, treatment with LGG or 
VSL#3 also increased osteocalcin levels in sham-operate mice 
(Figure 5E), demonstrating that probiotics induce a net anabolic 
effect independent of sex steroid deprivation.
Mechanistic studies revealed that feeding of LGG or VSL#3, 
but not LGG-M or E. coli, tightened intestinal barrier integrity, 
thus preventing the increase in gut permeability induced by ovx. 
This was demonstrated by the finding that ovx mice fed LGG or 
VSL#3, but not LGGM or E. coli, had lower levels of orally admin-
istered FITC-dextran (Figure 6A) and of serum endotoxin (Figure 
6B), as well as increased expression of the tight junction proteins 
claudin 2, 3, and 15 and Jam3 compared with ovx mice treated with 
vehicle (Figure 6, C–F). In accordance with their effects on barrier 
function, treatment with LGG or VSL#3 prevented an ovx-induced 
increase in intestinal mRNA levels of Rankl, Tnf, and Il17 mRNAs, 
(Figure 7, A–C), as well as BM mRNA levels of Rankl, Tnf, and Il17 
(Figure 7, D–F). By contrast, LGGM or E. coli did not prevent the 
increase in the mRNA levels of cytokines in the SI and the BM. 
Because of the key role of BM T cells in inducing bone loss in sex 
steroid–deprived mice, we also assessed the BM T cell production 
of inflammatory cytokines. This analysis revealed that treatment 
with LGG or VSL#3, but not E. coli and LGGM, prevented the 
increase in mRNA levels of Rankl, Tnf, and Il17 mRNAs in purified 
BM T cells (Supplemental Figure 5).
inflammation in the intestine by increasing the antigenic load 
traversing the intestinal barrier. To this end, we first measured 
transcript levels of a number of the gap junction proteins of the 
claudin family and of JAM3, which have all been shown to modu-
late intestinal barrier integrity (59, 60). As compared with Conv.R 
and Col.GF conditions, vehicle-treated GF mice had lower mRNA 
levels of claudin 2, 3, and 15, and of Jam3 (Figure 4, A–D), a finding 
consistent with the capacity of the microbiota to induce gap junc-
tion protein gene expression (61). Leuprolide treatment resulted 
in reduced transcript levels of claudin 2, 3, and 15, and of Jam3 in 
Conv.R and Col.GF mice but, importantly, did not alter expression 
levels of these genes in GF mice. In addition, and as expected, 
serum endotoxin levels — which correlate with gut permeability — 
were undetectable in all GF mice but were measurable in Conv.R 
and Col.GF mice (Figure 4E). Leuprolide-treated Conv.R and Col.
GF mice displayed higher serum endotoxin levels as compared 
with those treated with vehicle, confirming that sex steroid depri-
vation increases gut permeability. To further explore the effects of 
sex steroid withdrawal on gut permeability, Conv.R ovx and sham-
operated mice were gavaged with FITC-dextran 4 weeks after 
surgery, and 4 hours later, the serum levels of FITC-dextran — an 
index of gut permeability — were measured (62). Ovx mice had 
higher serum levels of FITC-dextran than sham-operated mice 
(Figure 4F), altogether showing that the intestinal barrier permea-
bility is compromised following sex steroid depletion.
Supplementation of the indigenous microbiota with probiotics 
prevents sex steroid–induced bone loss. To determine the extent to 
which supplementation of the normal diet with symbiotic bac-
teria tightens barrier integrity and influences the rate of bone 
loss following sex steroid depletion, 10-week-old convention-
ally raised mice were ovx or sham operated, treated with pro-
biotics or control vehicle for the first 4 weeks after surgery, and 
then sacrificed. Mice were supplemented by oral gavage with 
vehicle or purified cultures of the extensively studied probi-
otic LGG, or with commercially available VSL#3 preparation, 
which contains 8 strains of live bacteria — Bifidobacterium breve, 
Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus 
acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, 
Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus — over a 
4-week period. Additional control groups of sham-operated and 
ovx mice were treated with purified cultures of laboratory E. coli 
DH5alpha, a strain that does not exert a probiotic effect, and the 
LGG pili mutant LGG(ΔSpaC), herein referred to as LGGM — 
a strain with defective epithelial adhesion — which is required 
for LGG-induced cellular responses  (63). Mice were fed 1 × 
109 total bacteria at 3.5-day intervals for 4 weeks. No change in 
murine body weight was detected over this period (Supplemen-
tal Figure 1B); however, the expected ovx-associated decrease in 
uterus weight was confirmed (Supplemental Figure 1C). In vivo 
prospective μCT measurements of indices of spinal trabecular 
bone structure revealed that, in sham-operated mice, feeding of 
LGG or VSL#3 — but not LGGM or E. coli — caused a marked 
increase in BV/TV compared with baseline and vehicle at both 
2 and 4 weeks from surgery (Figure 5A). Strikingly, whereas ovx 
mice fed with vehicle or E. coli exhibited a significant loss of BV/
TV at 2 and 4 weeks, treatment with LGGM resulted in a partial 
bone sparing effect, and administration of LGG or VSL#3 com-

Discussion
We report that sex steroid depletion increases gut permeability 
and the production of osteoclastogenic cytokines in the intestine 
and the BM. Mice housed in GF conditions are protected against 
intestinal and BM inflammatory responses and the loss of trabe-
cular bone induced by sex steroid deficiency. We also show that 
treatment with probiotics prevents the increase in gut permeabil-
ity, the production of intestinal and BM cytokines, and the bone 
loss induced by sex steroid depletion.
We utilized mice raised in GF conditions, an established model 
for investigating the role of the microbiota in pathologic processes. 
However, GF mice have intestinal and immunological abnormal-
ities, including fewer T cells and effector T cells skewed toward 
a Th2 phenotype (3). Because these deviations resolve within 2–3 
weeks following colonization with normal flora (3), GF mice that 
were colonized with the microbiota of conventional mice were 
included in the study to control for phenotypic aberrations of GF 
mice not reversed by microbial colonization. In addition, because 
surgical procedures such as ovx are not technically feasible within 
a GF isolator, we utilized the GnRH agonist leuprolide to alter the 
production of ovarian sex steroids; leuprolide has been used previ-
ously to induce bone loss in rodents (19, 20).
Since the microbiota could affect the response to sex steroid 
deprivation of either bone resorption or bone formation, analysis 
of biochemical and histomorphometric indices of bone turnover 
was undertaken at the end of the 10-week treatment period. Our 
data revealed that leuprolide increased bone resorption in con-
ventional and colonized mice but not in GF mice. Serum osteo-
calcin, a biochemical index of the overall rate of bone formation 
in the entire skeleton, was differentially affected by leuprolide 
in GF mice and control mice. By contrast, histomorphometric 
indices of bone formation, which reflect only the status of the 
sampled region, were scarcely affected by leuprolide. However, 
both methods revealed that GF sex steroid–depleted mice had 
lower bone formation as compared with sex steroid–depleted 
mice with intestinal microbiota. Therefore, the microbiota is 
required for sex steroid deficiency to increase bone resorption 
and some aspects of bone formation.
Postmenopausal bone loss is regarded as an inflammatory 
condition because of the causal role of the immune system (21) 
and the presence of increased BM levels of inflammatory cytok-
ines (26). Among the mechanisms responsible for the bone loss 
induced by surgical menopause in mice and humans is an expan-
sion in the BM of activated T cells that produce TNF (30, 31, 37, 
40). In the mouse, this phenomenon results from enhanced thy-
mic-dependent differentiation of BM-derived progenitors and 
IFNγ-driven peripheral expansion of mature T cells (57, 64). Ovx 
also increases the population of premature senescent CD4+CD28– 
T cells (65), a lineage that produces high levels of TNF. Another 
factor responsible for the bone loss induced by estrogen defi-
ciency is IL-17, the signature cytokine of Th17 cells (47), which are 
an osteoclastogenic subset of CD4+ T cells (45, 46). Intriguingly, 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis exhibit elevated levels 
of serum IL-17 (66–68). In mice, ovx expands Th17 cells by pro-
moting the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into mature Th17 
cells (69), a phenomenon driven by cytokines such as TGFβ, IL-6, 
IL-1β, and TNF (43, 44, 47, 70) — factors that are all disregulated 
by estrogen deficiency (25). In addition, Th17 differentiation is 
inhibited by estrogen via a direct effect on CD4+ T cells mediated 
by estrogen receptor α (ERα) (71). The importance of IL-17 in bone 
loss is highlighted by the fact that silencing of IL-17R (72) or treat-
ment with an anti–IL-17 antibody (73) prevent ovx-induced bone 
loss. In our study, we report that, in GF mice, sex steroid deficiency 
does not expand TNF-producing T cells and does not increase 
the production of TNF in the BM and the gut. Moreover, in the 
absence of microbiota, no increase in IL-17 production occurred 
in the BM and tissues of the SI following sex steroid deficiency. 
Taken together, the present findings indicate that the microbiota 
is required for sex steroid deprivation to induce bone loss because 
it drives the expansion of conventional T cells and Th17 cells, 
thereby increasing their production of TNF and IL-17.
Importantly, we found sex steroid deficiency to alter cytokine 
levels not only in the BM, but also within tissues of the SI. These 
tissues are in intimate contact with the gut luminal microbiota 
and constantly sample and respond to the antigenic load within 
the intestinal lumen (74). The detected intestinal osteoclastogenic 
cytokines are produced by immune cells that reside in intesti-
nal subepithelial compartments, presumably in response to live 
microorganisms residing within the gut luminal content. Still 
unclear is whether bone loss is induced by gut cytokines that reach 
the BM, by immune cells activated in the gut that home to the 
BM, or by BM cells that are activated by foreign antigens of intes-
tinal origin. Irrespective of the specific mechanism involved, our 
data indicate that the intestinal microbiota is critical for inducing 
osteoclastogenic cytokine and the resulting bone loss.
The intestinal epithelium forms a tight physiological barrier to 
separate systemic tissue compartments from the resident flora of 
the gut lumen. A breakdown in barrier integrity leads to increased 
bacterial translocation, often resulting in chronic immunogenic 
disease states. In response to sex steroid deprivation, we detected 
an increased gut permeability. Our proposed model is that 
increased permeability allows an expanded range of molecules 
and potential antigenic load to enter epithelial submucosa, initi-
ating aberrant intestinal and systemic immune responses (75–78).

bind to the intestinal mucus layer and for LGG 
to exert its positive influence on gut tissue health 
(63). The fact that LGGM maintained a degree 
of protection from bone loss suggests that direct 
contact with the mucus layer may not be the only 
mode by which LGG exerts probiotic effects and 
that other properties of LGG — such as the pro-
duction of short chain fatty acids, which have 
been shown to modulate cytokine levels in the 
intestine — is also a mechanism to consider (79).
LGG has been shown to facilitate stem cell turnover (5), to facili-
tate wound restitution in the gut (6), to mediate cytoprotective effects 
in the gut (4), and to facilitate cell proliferation and migration (80, 81). 
It is also known that permeability along paracellular spaces in the epi-
thelium is controlled by intercellular tight junctional proteins (82, 83) 
and regulated, at least in part, by the MAPK and PI3 kinase signaling 
pathways (84). This may suggest that contact of epithelium cells with 
LGG and VSL#3 is able to compensate for the loss of MAPK activ-
ity following sex steroid depletion (85). Because gut epithelial cells 
express estrogen receptors (86, 87) — and estrogen receptor signaling 
activates MAPK (85) — one may speculate that sex steroids binding 
to their receptors in the gut epithelia induce MAPK expression that 
maintain and/or tighten gut permeability. Sex steroid deficiency 
would then result in weakening the MAPK pathway expression and 
barrier integrity, as detected in ovx or leuprolide-treated mice.
A relationship between decreased taxonomic diversity and 
disease state has been found in many inflammatory (88, 89) and 
metabolic conditions (90). As a result, decreased diversity is 
regarded as an indicator of disease state, reflecting a deteriorat-
ing habitat and/or depleted resources (91). Interestingly, estrogen 
depletion has also been associated with decreased α-diversity in 
the gut microbiome (92, 93), while microbial diversity in the gut 
transiently increases with administration of probiotics (94). There-
fore, we hypothesize that sex steroid deficiency leads to decreased 
microbiota diversity and that LGG and VSL#3 probiotics restore 
a greater diversity. Further studies will be required to investigate 
this hypothesis and to determine whether decreased diversity con-
tributes to the bone loss induced by sex steroid deprivation.
Taken together, the present findings support the proposed role for 
sex steroids in maintaining a tight physiological barrier between 
the systemic tissue compartments from the resident flora of the 
gut lumen. Depletion of sex steroid levels leads to increased gut 
permeability and offers a positive link between a weakened intes-
tinal barrier and the signature osteoclastogenic cytokine profile 
associated with osteoporosis.
One of the most prominent features of our studies is the obser-
vation that supplementation of the microbiota with known probiot-
ics entirely protected ovx mice against bone loss and caused a net 
gain in bone mass in sex steroid–replete mice. Consistent with these 
physiological findings, probiotics also tightened gut epithelial bar-
rier integrity and dampened the levels of osteoclastogenic cytok-
ines following sex steroid depletion. These profound effects were 
elicited by oral administration of either LGG or VSL#3 to ovx mice 
with a conventional microflora. These data indicate that both LGG 
and VSL#3 have dynamic interactions with the epithelial layer of 
the intestine and actively induce the expression of proteins involved 
with tightening the gut epithelial barrier. In addition, it is also pos-
sible that probiotics function by displacing bacterial species that 
downregulate tight junctional proteins in the intestinal epithelium.
Control assays in our studies showed that protection against 
bone loss is bacterial-strain specific. Here, treatment of ovx mice 
with an attenuated laboratory strain of E. coli DH5alpha exerted 
no detectable modulatory influence on bone loss or on cytokine 
production. Intriguingly, treatment of ovx mice with the LGGM 
partially protected ovx mice from bone loss. The SpaC protein 
was shown by our research group to be necessary for LGG to

by ovx (15). This probiotic prevented the increase in CD4+ T cells 
induced by ovx, secreted anti-TNF factors, and modified microbial 
communities in the ovx mouse gut (15).
In summary, the dysregulation in the interactions between the 
gut microbiota and the intestinal wall play a pivotal role in induc-
ing inflammation and bone loss in sex steroid–deficient mice. 
Direct clinical applications of these findings arise because of the 
availability of pre- and probiotic agents that may prevent bone loss 
by tightening the gut barrier integrity, thus limiting the production 
of osteoclastogenic cytokines.
Consistent with our data, reports have shown beneficial effects 
of probiotics for bone health. Probiotics have been shown to alter 
the composition or the metabolic activity of the gut microbiota (95), 
regulating the immune response of the host (96, 97) and enhanc-
ing epithelial barrier function (98, 99). Others have reported on the 
phenomenology that probiotics prevented trabecular bone loss as 
effectively as the bisphosphonate alendronate (13) and that lacto-
bacilli can prevent the loss of cortical but not trabecular bone and 
reverses the decrease in Tregs induced by ovx (14). In addition, 
Lactobacillus reuteri prevented the loss of trabecular bone induced

Leuprolide administration. Lupron Depot (Takeda) or vehicle was 
injected at doses of 375 μg/mouse s.c. once per month for 3 months 
starting with 10-week-old mice. Mice were sacrificed after 10 weeks 
of treatment.
Intestinal permeability assays. Barrier function was evaluated by 
measuring in vivo paracellular permeability to fluorescent-labeled 
dextran as described (101). Briefly, mice were administered 0.5 ml of 
22 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate–labeled 4.4-kDa dextran (FD4; 
Sigma-Aldrich) by oral gavage. Serum was obtained 4 hours after 
administration by terminal cardiac puncture under isoflurane anes-
thesia. The serum dextran concentration was calculated by comparing 
samples with serial dilutions of known standards using a Synergy HT 
fluorimeter (BioTek) with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 
Methods
Animals. Female C57BL6/J mice were purchased from Taconic. 
Conv.R mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free condi-
tions and fed sterilized food and autoclaved water ad libitum. GF mice 
were maintained in a semiflexible isolators (Park Bioservices) under a 
strict 12-hour light cycle and fed with autoclaved chow diet ad libitum 
at the GF facility of Georgia State University. GF status was confirmed 
at the end of the treatment period by fecal DNA extraction using 
QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and subsequent quantitative 
PCR (qPCR) using 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 
806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′) primers. Conv.R mice 
and water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
Colonization of GF mice. The colon and cecal contents of 10-week-
old Conv.R mice were homogenized and suspended in 10 ml of sterile 
PBS. Microbiota reconstitutions were performed by oral gavage with

ments of the spine. For the femoral trabecular region, we analyzed 
140 slices, beginning 50 slices below the distal growth plate. Femoral 
cortical bone was assessed using 80 continuous CT slides located at 
the femoral midshaft. In vivo measurements of spinal trabecular bone 
contours along the periosteal surfaces were drawn encompassing 50 
slices of the L4 vertebra, starting at the beginning of trabecular bone 
within the spinal body, as described (39). X-ray tube potential was 70 
nm. Serum endotoxin levels were determined using the Limulus Ame-
bocyte Lysate kit from Associates of Cape Cod Inc. according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.

reported previously (42, 102, 103) using Scanco μCT-40 and Scanco 
vivaCT 40 scanners. Voxel size was 10.5 μm3 for the in vitro measure-
ments of femurs from Conv.R, GF, and Col.GF mice. For measure-

RNA isolation from SI. A 10-mm intestinal piece of each mouse 
was collected at sacrifice and completely submerged into 0.5 ml 
RNAlater (QIAGEN) in a 1.5-ml tube. The tissue was kept at 4°C over-
night and then transferred to –80°C for storage. RNA was extracted 
using the QIAshredder kit and the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s directions.
qPCR and murine primers. RNA levels were quantified by qPCR. 
RNA was isolated using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) and cDNA synthesized 
using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and random hexamers according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative abundance of cDNAs was 
determined by qPCR analysis using the ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time 
PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The expression levels of murine 
Rora and Rorgt mRNAs levels were measured in purified BM CD4+ T 
cells. The expression levels of murine Il17, Tnf, and Rankl were mea-
sured in whole BM, purified BM T cells, and SI cells. For the survey of 
gap junction protein expression, the mRNA levels of claudin 2, claudin 
3, claudin 15, and Jam3 were measured in SI. All the primers used were 
designed by Primer Express Software v3.0.1 (Applied Biosystems). 
Changes in relative gene expression between vehicle and leuprolide 
groups were calculated using the 2–ΔCT method with normalization to 
18S rRNA. The primers used were as follows: for 18S rRNA, 5′-ATTC-

Statistics. Murine data were normally distributed according to 
the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and analyzed by unpaired 2-tailed t 
tests, 2-way ANOVA, or ANOVA for repeated measures as appropri-
ate, which included the main effects for animal strain and treatment 
plus the statistical interaction between animal strain and treatment. 
When the statistical interaction between animal strain and treatment 
group was not statistically significant (P > 0.05) nor suggestive of an 
important interaction (P > 0.10), P values for the main effects tests 
were reported. When the statistical interaction was statistically signifi-
cant (P < 0.05) or suggestive of an important interaction, then t tests 
were used to compare the differences between the treatment means 
for each animal strain, applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple 
comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Study approval. All animal procedures were approved by the Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University and 
Georgia State University.
kVp, and integration time was 350 ms for the in vivo measurements 
and 200 ms for the in vitro measurements.
Quantitative bone histomorphometry. This analysis was performed 
as previously described (42). The measurements, terminology, and 
units used for histomorphometric analysis were those recommended 
by the Nomenclature Committee of the American Society for Bone 
and Mineral Research (104).
IL-17, TNF, RANKL, IFNγ, and IL-4 ELISA. BM was collected 
at sacrifice and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) sup-
plemented with 10% FBS in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 
13-acetate (20 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml, 
 
Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 48 hours. Supernatants were collected 
and assayed for IL-17, TNF, RANKL, IFNγ, and IL-4 by ELISA kits 
(R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s directions.
Markers of bone turnover. Serum CTX and serum osteocalcin were 
measured by rodent-specific ELISAs (Immunodiagnostic Systems).
SILP lymphocyte isolation. Lamina propria lymphocyte isolation was 
performed as described (105). Briefly, the SI was removed and flushed of 
fecal content, and intestinal segments containing Peyer’s patches were 
excised. The intestine was opened longitudinally and cut into 5-mm 
pieces. Tissues were transferred into a 50-ml conical tube and shaken at 
2 g for 20 minutes at 37°C in HBSS medium (Invitrogen) supplemented 
with 5% FBS (Mediatech Inc., Corning) containing 2 mM EDTA. This pro-
cess was repeated 2 additional times. The tissue suspension was passed 
through a strainer, and the remaining intestinal tissue was washed and 
then minced, transferred into a fresh 50-ml conical tube, and shaken for 
20 minutes at 37°C in HBSS plus 5% FBS containing type VIII collage-
nase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1.5 mg/ml. The tissue suspension was collected, 
passed through a strainer, and pelleted by centrifugation at 40 g for 3 
minutes. The pellet was suspended in 10 ml HBSS medium and passed 
through glass wool halfway packed in a 10-ml syringe to remove undi-
gested tissue pieces. The cell suspension was collected in a 50-ml tube 
and centrifuged at 2 g for 3 minutes. The pellet was suspended in 5 ml 
HBSS and 5 ml 90% isotonic Percoll and then transferred into a 15-ml 
tube and mixed by tilting back and forth. The cell content was layered 
onto 2 ml of 70% isotonic Percoll. The gradient was centrifuged at 112 g 
for 20 minutes. Cells were collected from the interface area and washed 
by centrifugation in 10 ml supplemented RPMI-1640 medium supple-
mented with 5% FBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml supple-
mented RPMI-1640, and cell number was counted.
Flow cytometry. Single cell suspension of BM, spleen, and SILP 
cells were prepared in RPMI 1640 culture medium. For intracellu-
lar cytokine staining, cells were incubated with phorbol 12-myristate 
 
13-acetate (50 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml, 
 
Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of GolgiStop (1 μg/ml, BioLegend) at 
37°C for 4 hours. Cells were then stained with FITC anti-TCRβ (clone

RM4-5, catalog 100434, BioLegend), and PE/Cy7 anti-CD8 (clone 
53-6.7, catalog 100722, BioLegend) followed by intracellular staining 
with PE anti–IL-17 (clone TC11-18H10.1, catalog 506904, BioLegend), 
APC anti-TNF (clone MP6-XT22, catalog 506308, BioLegend), or 
PE anti-RANKL (clone IK22-5, catalog 510006, BioLegend). All anti-
bodies were obtained from BioLegend. Cells were analyzed by flow 
cytometry using a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo 
software. Results are expressed as cell frequency (%). The percentage 
of IL-17+CD4+ T cells, TNF+CD4+ T cells, and TNF+CD8+ cells gated in 
TCRβ+ cells was quantified in all the groups.
