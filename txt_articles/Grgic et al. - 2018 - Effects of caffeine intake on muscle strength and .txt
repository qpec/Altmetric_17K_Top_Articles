strength and power: a systematic review
and meta-analysis

Abstract
Background: Caffeine is commonly used as an ergogenic aid. Literature about the effects of caffeine ingestion on
muscle strength and power is equivocal. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize
results from individual studies on the effects of caffeine intake on muscle strength and power.
Methods: A search through eight databases was performed to find studies on the effects of caffeine on: (i) maximal
muscle strength measured using 1 repetition maximum tests; and (ii) muscle power assessed by tests of vertical jump.
Meta-analyses of standardized mean differences (SMD) between placebo and caffeine trials from individual studies were
conducted using the random effects model.
Results: Ten studies on the strength outcome and ten studies on the power outcome met the inclusion criteria for the
meta-analyses. Caffeine ingestion improved both strength (SMD = 0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03, 0.36; p = 0.023)
and power (SMD = 0.17; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.34; p = 0.047). A subgroup analysis indicated that caffeine significantly improves
upper (SMD = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.39; p = 0.026) but not lower body strength (SMD = 0.15; 95% CI: -0.05, 0.34; p = 0.147).
Conclusion: The meta-analyses showed significant ergogenic effects of caffeine ingestion on maximal muscle strength
of upper body and muscle power. Future studies should more rigorously control the effectiveness of blinding. Due to
the paucity of evidence, additional findings are needed in the female population and using different forms of caffeine,
such as gum and gel.
Keywords: Ergogenic aid, Performance, Power, Data synthesis
Background
Caffeine’s ergogenic potential has been extensively stud-
ied in the sports science literature, with research dating
back to 1907 [1]. From investigating caffeine’s effects on
aerobic exercise, in recent years the research focus has
shifted to anaerobic exercise performance outcomes,
such as muscular endurance, muscle strength, and jump-
ing tasks that require muscle power. While caffeine has
been found to significantly enhance muscular endurance
[2], the effects of caffeine ingestion on maximal muscle
strength (commonly operationalized as one repetition
maximum [1RM]) and muscle power (commonly opera-
tionalized as vertical jump) remain unclear, and the
practical utility of caffeine ingestion for enhancing
performance in such physical tasks has not been fully
elucidated.
The pioneering work on caffeine’s effects on strength by
Astorino et al. [3] reported no significant strength-
enhancing effects with caffeine ingestion in a group of re-
sistance trained men. Recent work by Grgic and Mikulic
[4], however, found a significant 3% increase in lower body
strength with caffeine ingestion using the barbell back
squat 1RM as a measure of maximal strength. Goldstein
et al. [5] reported a significant increase in upper body
strength with caffeine ingestion, while Williams et al. [6]
reported no ergogenic effect. The inconsistent results of
individual studies prevent drawing sound conclusions re-
garding the ergogenic potential of caffeine for maximal
strength outcomes.

 Equivocal findings have also been presented for the ef-
fects of caffeine intake on muscle power. A recent study
by Ali et al. [7] reported no effect on countermovement
jump height with caffeine ingestion. However, the find-
ings of Bloms et al. [8] support conclusions about caf-
feine as an effective ergogenic aid for achieving acute
improvements in countermovement jump height and
peak force. Given the importance of jumping abilities for
many common sports, it would be of both scientific and
practical significance to determine a reasonably precise
estimate regarding the potential performance-enhancing
impact of caffeine ingestion on muscle power.
Several aspects that vary between studies, including
the exercise used, participants’ characteristics (e.g., age,
sex, and training experience), and caffeine form, might
be responsible for the inconsistency of findings. Most
importantly, small sample sizes often limited the statis-
tical power to detect significant effects [9]. A meta-
analysis of individual studies is needed to circumvent
these issues and provide in-depth, evidence-based scru-
tiny of the current body of evidence. The first meta-
analytic investigation on the topic of caffeine and
strength was performed by Warren et al. [10], who
found a mean increase of approximately 7% in lower
body maximal voluntary contraction with caffeine inges-
tion. A limitation of the meta-analysis is that only two of
the included studies tested the effects of caffeine inges-
tion on 1RM, which significantly restricted the findings
to isometric and isokinetic strength outcomes.
The latest meta-analysis on the topic, done by Polito
et al. [2], found no significant effect of caffeine intake on
performance in 1RM strength tests. However, only three
studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.
The total number of pooled participants was relatively
low (n = 46), potentially indicating issues with the statis-
tical power of the analysis. Furthermore, the small num-
ber of included studies prevented subgroup analyses for
possible moderators that may potentially impact the er-
gogenic potential of caffeine. Since the review by Polito
et al. [2], a number of experimental trials have been pub-
lished [4, 11–16], presenting novel findings for females
[14], trained [4, 16] and untrained men [11, 13], athletes
[15], and adolescents [12]; as such, an updated review
appears to be warranted.
No previous meta-analyses have pooled the results of in-
dividual studies on the effects of caffeine on muscle power.
The aim of this systematic review was, therefore, twofold:
(a) to perform an updated meta-analysis of the acute effects
of caffeine ingestion on maximal muscle strength; and (b)
to conduct the first meta-analysis of acute effects of caf-
feine ingestion on muscle power assessed by vertical jump
tests. The results may benefit athletes and practitioners in
a variety of sports in which muscle strength and/or power
are important determinants of performance.
Methods
Search strategy
The systematic literature search was performed follow-
ing the PRISMA guidelines [17]. A search of the following
databases was performed: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus,
Cochrane Library, Web of Science (including Science
Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index,
and Arts & Humanities Citation Index), Google Scholar,
Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations,
ProQuest Dissertation & Theses and Open Access Theses
and Dissertations. The search for the studies on the effects
of caffeine on strength was restricted to the documents
published from 2015 onwards as the review by Polito et al.
[2], with a search performed in March 2015 was used as a
reference point. The review by Polito and colleagues [2]
was assessed for rigor and deemed as of high-quality.
Thus, the studies [3, 5, 6] included in the work by Polito
et al. [2] were also included in the present review. The fol-
lowing syntax was used for the primary search: caffeine
AND (“muscle strength” OR “ergogenic aid” OR perform-
ance OR “resistance exercise” OR “resistance training” OR
recovery OR “strength training”).
A separate search was done for the studies on the ef-
fects of caffeine on power outcomes. The following syn-
tax with no time restriction was used: caffeine AND
(“vertical jump” OR “countermovement jump” OR “squat
jump” OR plyometrics OR height OR “drop jump” OR
“depth jump” OR “jump training”).
The search results were downloaded and filtered in
EndNote software (X8; Clarivate Analytics, New York,
USA). A secondary search was performed by screening
the reference lists of all selected studies, and by conduct-
ing forward citation tracking (using Google Scholar and
Scopus) of studies found meeting the inclusion criteria.
The search concluded on April 19th, 2017.
Inclusion criteria
To warrant inclusion in the current analysis potential
studies were required to meet the following criteria:
(a)an experimental trial published in English in a peer-
reviewed journal, or a doctoral or a master’s thesis;
(b)assessed the effects of caffeine ingestion in the form
of capsule, liquid, gum or gel on dynamic maximal
muscle strength (i.e. the greatest amount of weight
lifted in a single repetition – 1RM) using constant
external resistance, and/or on muscle power
assessed using a vertical jump test (both peak force
and vertical jump height were considered);
(c)caffeine was not co-ingested with other drugs/
substances or potentially ergogenic compounds;
(d)employed a single or double-blind, randomized
crossover design;
Grgic et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2018) 15:11 
Page 2 of 10
 (e)used human participants without known chronic
disease or injury.
Studies were excluded from the analysis if any of the
above criteria were violated. Caffeine ingestion via coffee
was not considered as coffee has several other biologic-
ally active compounds that might moderate the impact
of caffeine.
Study coding and data extraction
For all studies meeting the inclusion criteria, the following
information was tabulated on a predefined coding sheet
using Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft Corporation,
WA, USA):
(a)author(s), title and year of publication;
(b)sample size, participants’ sex, participants’ age
(categorized as: adolescents [10–18 years]; young adults
[18–39 years]; middle-aged adults [40–64 years];and
seniors [≥65 years], and participants’ experience in
resistance training (categorized as: untrained [less than
1 year of experience]; and trained [more than 1 year of
experience]) for studies assessing strength outcomes,
and experience in sport training using the same
categories as above for studies assessing muscle power.
(c)caffeine form, dosage, and time of ingestion before
the experimental session(s);
(d)the exercises used for assessing muscle strength and
power with the accompanying mean ± standard
deviation (SD) data for the placebo and caffeine trials;
(e)habitual caffeine intake by the participants;
(f) the number of participants indicating which trial
they perceived to be the caffeine trial;
(g)reported side effects;
(h)reported funding for conducting the studies.
Methodological quality
The 11-point PEDro scale was used for the assessment of
the methodological quality of studies [18]. The first item
concerns external validity and is not included in the total
score; hence, the maximal score on the scale is 10. Studies
were classified as in McCrary et al. [19]. Two authors of
the article (JG and BL) performed the search, coding, and
appraisal of methodological quality independently, with
discussion and consensus over any observed differences.
Before correcting for observed differences, the overall
agreement between the two independent data extractions
was very high (Cohen’s kappa = 0.94).
Statistical analysis
The meta-analysis was performed using the Comprehen-
sive Meta-analysis software, version 2 (Biostat Inc.,
Englewood, NJ, USA). Standardized mean differences
(Hedge’s g [SMD]) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were calculated between the placebo and caffeine trials
based on their means and standard deviations in 1RM
(kg) and vertical jump (cm) tests, the correlations be-
tween the trials, and the number of participants. An ana-
lysis of peak force in the vertical jump test was not
performed as only two studies reported such outcomes
[8, 16]. Since none of the studies reported correlation, a
0.5 correlation was assumed for all trials, as recom-
mended by Follmann et al. [20]. When a study measured
muscle strength and/or power under multiple conditions
(e.g. used more than one caffeine dose, tested more than
one muscle group), SMDs and variances were averaged
across the different conditions. SMDs of ≤0.2, 0.2–0.5,
0.5–0.8, and > 0.8 were considered to represent small,
medium, large and very large effects, respectively [9].
The random effects model was used for analysis of both
muscle strength and muscle power outcomes. The statis-
tical significance threshold was set a priori at p < 0.05.
Subgroup analyses for the effects of caffeine on muscle
strength were performed for the following study charac-
teristics: (a) upper body strength; (b) lower body strength;
(c) the capsule form of caffeine; (d) the liquid form of caf-
feine; (e) females; (f) males; (g) untrained; and (h) trained.
Subgroup analyses for the effects of caffeine on muscle
power were performed for the following characteristics:
(a) the capsule form of caffeine; (b) the liquid form of
caffeine; (c) females; (d) males; (e) athletes; (h) non- ath-
letes; (f) countermovement and squat jump tests; and (g)
Sargent jump tests.
The I2 statistic was used to assess the degree of het-
erogeneity, with values from ≤50% indicating low hetero-
geneity, 50–75% moderate heterogeneity and > 75% high
level of heterogeneity. Funnel plots were constructed for
both muscle strength and muscle power outcomes, plot-
ting standard error against Hedge’s g. Funnel plot asym-

was
assessed using the Trim-and-Fill method [21].
Results
The literature search yielded a total of 2533 documents.
After a preliminary screening of titles and abstracts, 71
full-text studies were scrutinized. In total, ten studies were
found meeting the inclusion criteria for strength outcomes
[3–6, 11–16] (Table 1) with a total of 149 participants
(males n = 116, females n = 33). Ten studies were found
assessing muscle power outcomes [4, 7, 8, 15, 22–26] with
a total of 145 participants (males n = 116, females n = 29).
According to their age, all participants were classified as
adolescents or young adults. Three studies [4, 12, 15]
assessed both muscle strength and muscle power. The
results of the search and study selection process are
depicted in Fig. 1.
Fifteen studies were published in peer-reviewed jour-
nals, while two studies were master’s theses [14, 26]. The

 median number of participants per study was 14. Most
of the studies used a double-blind design (i.e., 15 stud-
ies), with two studies [8, 14] using a single-blind design.
Caffeine dosage varied from 0.9 mg.kg− 1 to 7 mg.kg− 1.
Only one study administered caffeine in the form of gel
[16], while the rest used capsule or liquid forms. Only
nine studies reported habitual caffeine intake, with
Astorino et al. [3] and Goldstein et al. [5] reporting a
large range of habitual caffeine intakes among the par-
ticipants (0–600 mg.kg− 1 per day). Only three studies
[3, 22, 24] reported assessing the effectiveness of the
blinding, with 60%, 50% and 33% of the participants
correctly differentiating between the placebo and the
caffeine trials, respectively. Individual characteristics of
the included studies are reported in Table 1.
Results of the meta-analysis indicated a significant
difference (p = 0.023) between the placebo and caffeine tri-
als on measures of maximal strength (Fig. 2). The pooled
SMD for the effects of caffeine ingestion on muscle
strength was 0.20 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.36). A subgroup analysis
indicated that caffeine significantly improves upper (SMD
= 0.21; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.39; p = 0.026; Fig. 3) but not lower
body strength (SMD = 0.15; 95% CI: -0.05, 0.34; p = 0.147;
Fig. 4). Results from all of the remaining subgroup analysis
may be found in Table 2.
The meta-analysis performed for muscle power indi-
cated a significant difference (SMD = 0.17; 95% CI: 0.00,
0.34; p = 0.047) between the placebo and caffeine trials
(Fig. 5). Results from all of the subgroup analysis can be
found in Table 2.
The I2 statistic showed low heterogeneity for the stud-
ies assessing muscle strength and muscle power (I2 = 0.0;
p = 0.981, and I2 = 0.0; p = 0.933, respectively). The analysis
of funnel plots did not reveal substantial asymmetry for
muscle strength or muscle power outcomes. The Trim-
and-Fill method changed the pooled SMD for muscle
power from 0.17 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.34) to 0.12 (95% CI: -0.01,
0.26). The Trim-and-Fill method did not have an impact on
the pooled effect size for muscle strength outcomes.
The mean PEDro methodological quality score was
9.6, with the values for individual studies ranging from 8 to
10. Three studies [8, 14, 22] were categorized as being of
“good methodological quality” (PEDro score = 8), while all
other studies were classified as being of “excellent quality”.
Discussion
The results of the meta-analysis show that caffeine may
be an effective ergogenic aid for muscle strength and
power. The pooled effects of caffeine on performance
were small to medium. It is important to note that even
small improvements in performance in some sports may
translate to meaningful differences in competitive out-
comes [27, 28]. A previous meta-analysis did not show a
significant effect of caffeine supplementation on muscle
strength [2], and the results of individual studies investi-
gating caffeine’s effects on muscle power have not been
previously pooled in a meta-analysis. Our novel results
showing that caffeine may induce practically meaningful
improvements in muscle strength and power can, there-
fore, be used to inform athletes, coaches, and sports nu-
tritionists, as well as future research endeavors in this
area, about the ergogenic potential of caffeine.
Strength outcomes
Upper and lower body strength
The subgroup analysis indicated a significant increase in
upper body, but not lower body strength, with caffeine
ingestion. These results are somewhat unexpected, as
Warren et al. [10] suggested that larger muscles, such as
those of the lower body, have a greater motor unit recruit-
ment capability with caffeine intake than smaller muscles,
such as those of the arm. Motor unit recruitment, in
addition to the reduced rate of perceived exertion and the
central effects of adenosine on neurotransmission, arousal,
and pain perception, are considered to be underlying
mechanisms by which caffeine can enhance performance,
although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully eluci-
dated [29, 30]. Based on the current results, it may be sur-
mised that caffeine is a useful ergogenic aid for achieving
acute increases in maximal upper body strength. In the in-
cluded studies, lower body maximal strength was evalu-
ated using only leg press and squat (machine-based and

 free weight) tests. Two studies [4, 16] used a free weight
exercise (barbell back squat), and both reported a signifi-
cant increase in lower body strength. Warren et al. [10]
concluded that caffeine ingestion might increase lower
body isometric strength. Our findings do not indicate a
strength increasing effect with caffeine ingestion for lower
body dynamic strength. It is worth noting that in general,
the included studies did not report on the reliability of
their strength assessment, indicating potential reasons for
the surprising findings for lower body strength. Further
research is needed to examine the effects of caffeine on
dynamic strength. Such studies may benefit from using a
larger variety of dynamic lower body strength tests, as the
current findings are mostly limited to a small selection of
primarily machine-based tests.
Training status
The subgroup analysis for training status indicated no
significant differences in maximal strength in trained
(p = 0.076) and untrained individuals (p = 0.144). The

 meta-analysis of the three studies among untrained
individuals was limited by small overall sample size
(n = 32). It may be considered indicative that two of three
individual studies reported significant differences in max-
imal strength with caffeine ingestion, but more individual
studies on this topic are needed before drawing firm con-
clusions. Training status seems to play a significant role in
response to caffeine intake in other forms of physical
activity, such as swimming, with greater improvements
observed in trained athletes [31]. However, it remains
unclear whether the same applies to strength outcomes.
More studies are needed before confidently drawing
conclusions about the potential differences in effects of
caffeine ingestion on muscle strength of trained and un-
trained individuals.
Sex
The subgroup analysis in males showed a significant im-
provement in strength with caffeine ingestion. The
subgroup analysis for females was limited by small sam-
ple size, as only three studies [5, 12, 14] were found
meeting the inclusion criteria. The landmark study by
Goldstein et al. [5] reported a significant increase in the
1RM bench press in a cohort of resistance trained fe-
males. However, the effect size was very small (SMD =
0.07), thereby limiting the practical significance of the
finding. Another study among female participants was per-
formed by Sabblah et al. [14]. The researchers reported an
SMD of 0.33 for increases in upper body strength with caf-
feine ingestion. However, the study employed a single-
blind design and hence provided evidence of somewhat
lower methodological quality compared to other studies.
Additionally, the participants in the study from Sabblah et
al. [14] exhibited lower levels of fitness than the partici-
pants in the study from Goldstein et al. [5], with marked
disparities observed for 1RM strength (32 kg and 52 kg, re-
spectively). None of the studies that included female partic-
ipants controlled for the potential variability attributable to

 metabolic alterations across the menstrual cycle [32],
which is a limitation of the current body of literature. Add-
itional rigorously controlled studies are needed to provide
clarity on the topic.
Caffeine form
The subgroup analysis indicated significant increases in
strength after the ingestion of caffeine in the capsule
form. The meta-analysis of the effects of the liquid form
of caffeine included only three studies and did not report
a significant effect. It is likely that the analysis was lim-
ited due to the small sample size (n = 50). Only one
study [16] used caffeine in the form of a gel. Previous
studies indicate that there are no practically meaningful
pharmacokinetic differences between these routes of caf-
feine ingestion [33]; as such, it is unlikely that marked
differences exist when comparing ergogenic effects of
various forms of caffeine administration. Further investi-
gations are needed for liquid forms of caffeine and
others that have rarely or never been studied in this con-
text, such as gum and gel.
Power outcomes
The meta-analysis supports caffeine as an effective ergo-
genic aid for achieving acute increases in muscle power
expressed as vertical jump height. These results may
have considerable applicability to many sports, including
basketball and volleyball, in which muscle power and
jumping ability are highly related to performance out-
comes. The magnitude of acute improvement in vertical
jump height found in the current analysis for a single caf-
feine ingestion is roughly equivalent to the effects of ~
4 weeks of plyometric training [34]. The current analysis
included only studies that used vertical jump as the power
outcome; as such, it is possible that caffeine ingestion could
produce somewhat different effects on other types of
muscle power tests. However, a recent meta-analysis also
showed a significant performance-enhancing effect of caf-
feine on the Wingate test, which is a common test of
power [35]. Furthermore, most of the included studies used
countermovement jump for assessing vertical jump; it re-
mains to be explored whether the caffeine ingestion would
produce different effects on other forms of vertical jump-
ing. In addition, all of the included studies evaluated these
effects in isolated conditions that may not accurately reflect
in-game, sport-specific jumping tasks. More evidence may
be needed to determine if the performance-enhancing ef-
fects of caffeine would transfer in the context of individual
sports and/or team-sport matches [36].
While previous research [37] has shown an increase in
countermovement jump height after ingestion of a caf-
feine-containing energy drink, it was unclear if the effect
was attributable to the caffeine content or the presence of
other substances, such as taurine. A recent meta-analysis
on caffeinated energy drinks found a significant association
between their taurine content and performance, but not
between their caffeine content and performance [38]. As
postulated by Bloms et al. [8], motor schema might play a
role when assessing the association between caffeine and
muscle power. Bloms et al. [8] tested the effect of caffeine
on muscle power among a cohort of athletes and reported
significant increases in jumping height. By contrast, Gauvin
[26] reported no effects of caffeine ingestion on muscle
power in a group of untrained men, with no previous
experience in the exercise. The subgroup analysis for
training status indicated a significant effect for ath-
letes, but not for non-athletes. It may be suggested
that future studies should control for this confound-
ing factor by including only participants with or with-
out previous experience in the task, or by performing
initial familiarization sessions.
None of the remaining subgroup analysis showed a
significant effect of caffeine. These results might be due
to the small sample sizes in different subgroup analysis.

 More studies are needed before reaching conclusions
about context-specific effects of caffeine. Furthermore,
while the body of evidence evaluating effects of caffeine
on muscle power is still limited; the current meta-analysis
shows promising findings, but more studies are needed on
this topic. Specifically, studies including different forms of
vertical jumping and sport-specific jumping tasks, differ-
ent population groups, larger sample sizes, and different
doses and forms of caffeine are required.
Methodological quality
The PEDro scale showed good to excellent quality
among the included studies, suggesting that the results
of the current meta-analysis were not confounded by the
inclusion of studies with poor research methodology.
Only two studies [6, 25] reported receiving funding from
parties that may have had commercial interest for con-
ducting the research, so it is improbable that the overall
results of the current study were significantly affected by
financial bias. To further improve the quality of evi-
dence, future studies should use a double-blind rather
than a single-blind design and assess the effectiveness of
the blinding. Only three studies [3, 22, 24] reported asses-
sing the effectiveness of the blinding. This information is of
importance as participants’ recognition of the caffeine trial
may influence outcomes [39], because psychological effects
of ‘expectancy’ and ‘belief’ might have an impact on per-
formance [40]. In some studies, performance-enhancing
responses were found with perceived ‘caffeine’ ingestion,
when in fact, a placebo was consumed [41]. Future studies
examining this topic should include a questionnaire of per-
ception of the trials to prevent possible issues associated
with such confounding.
While the inclusion of doctoral and master’s theses
may be considered as a limitation of this review, their in-
clusion is supported by their high methodological quality
scores. Therefore, the inclusion of such studies may be
regarded as a strength rather than a limitation, as it
would be inappropriate to omit high-quality contribu-
tions to the literature from a comprehensive systematic
review. A limitation of the current review is the low
number of studies included in the subgroup analysis.
Secondly, a limitation is that no studies were found for
age groups other than adolescents and young adults.
The findings, therefore, pertain mainly to young individ-
uals and cannot be generalized to other age groups. Fur-
thermore, due to the high degree of inter-individual
variability of effects [42], these results should be inter-
preted with caution when it comes to prescribing caf-
feine supplementation to individuals. Individuals should
also assess their susceptibility to possible side effects as
reported in the literature, such as tremor, insomnia, ele-
vated heart rate, headache, abdominal/gut discomfort,
muscle soreness, and inability to verbally communicate
and stay focused. These side effects may be enhanced in
naive caffeine users [3, 5], so extra precaution may be
warranted in such individuals.
Conclusion
Caffeine appears to provide significant ergogenic effects
on muscle strength and power. The expression of strength
in the form of 1RM is most specific to the sport of power-
lifting but may translate to performance improvements in
a variety of other strength-power sports. The effects of
caffeine on muscle power may apply to athletes in a var-
iety of sports in which jumping is a predominant activity
that affects the sport-specific performance. Subgroup-
analyses suggested that the effects of caffeine on strength
may be more pronounced in upper body muscles, but fur-
ther research on this topic is warranted. The results of the
present meta-analysis are based on limited evidence, and
thus need to be interpreted with caution. Future studies
should explore the optimal dosage and form of caffeine
for maximizing effects on strength and power. Finally, re-
sponses to caffeine ingestion have a high degree of inter-
individual variability, and as such, the applicability of the
current findings must be assessed on a case-by-case basis,
based on the specific characteristics of the individual and
the sports activity or other physical tasks.
