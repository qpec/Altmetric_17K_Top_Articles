background Despite concerns that non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) contribute to acute kidney 
injury (AKI), up to 75% of ultramarathon runners ingest 
these during competition. The effect of NSAID on AKI 
incidence in ultramarathon runners is unclear.
Methods Multisite randomised double-blind placebo-
controlled trial in the Gobi, Atacama, Ecuador and Sri 
Lankan deserts to determine whether ibuprofen (400 mg 
every 4 hours) would be non-inferior to placebo during 
a 50-mile (80 km) foot race. The primary outcome was 
incidence of AKI defined as severity categories of ’risk’ of 
injury of 1.5× baseline creatinine (Cr) or ’injury’ as 2× Cr, 
combined to calculate total incidence at the finish line. 
Non-inferiority margin for difference in AKI rates was 
defined as 15%.
results Eighty-nine participants (47% ibuprofen and 
53% placebo) were enrolled with similar demographics 
between groups. The overall incidence of AKI was 44%. 
Intent-to-treat analysis found 22 (52%) ibuprofen versus 
16 (34%) placebo users developed AKI (18% difference, 
95% CI –4% to 41%; OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.9 to 5.1) with 
a number needed to harm of 5.5. Greater severity of 
AKI was seen with ibuprofen compared with placebo 
(risk=38% vs 26%; 95% CI –9% to 34%; injury=14% vs 
9%; 95% CI –10% to 21%). Slower finishers were less 
likely to encounter AKI (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.98) 
and greater weight loss (−1.3%) increased AKI (OR 1.24, 
95% CI 1.00 to 1.63).
conclusion There were increased rates of AKI in those 
who took ibuprofen, and although not statistically 
inferior to placebo by a small margin, there was a 
number needed to harm of 5.5 people to cause 1 case 
of AKI. Consideration should therefore be taken before 
ingesting NSAID during endurance running as it could 
exacerbate renal injury.

IntroductIon
Ultramarathon foot races, any distance greater 
than the standard marathon, have increased in 
popularity worldwide, with 10% increase per 
year to 1357 races in 2015, with >70 
000 annual 
finishers.1 Renal dysfunction is a common finding in 
endurance runners, with acute kidney injury (AKI) 
observed in 34%–85% of ultramarathoners.2–4
The majority of AKI in ultramarathon runners 
appears to resolve spontaneously,5 6 although it has 
the potential to progress to acute renal failure and 
hospitalisation.7 8 Contributing factors to AKI in 
this population include myoglobinaemia, increased 
sympathetic tone, dehydration and reduced renal 
perfusion from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs).9 A large proportion of athletes take 
NSAID for their analgesic effects, with 35%–75% 
of ultramarathon runners found to ingest NSAID 
during competition.10 11 Despite their popularity, 
the benefits of NSAID use are unclear and there is 
little evidence to support their role in preventing 
exercise-induced muscle damage, perceived exer-
tion or immediate post-race muscle soreness.10
Previous investigations into the role of NSAID 
as a causative factor for renal injury in endurance 
runners reveal mixed conclusions. One study found 
higher serum creatinine (Cr) levels in runners who 
ingested NSAID,8 while the majority of studies 
showed no significant association.3 4 10 12 The only 
prospective trial to date that examined this rela-
tionship found no renal dysfunction in the NSAID

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common 
finding in endurance runners, encountered in 
34%–85% of ultramarathoners.
 
► Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
are thought to contribute to AKI, although 
35%–75% of ultramarathoners ingest them 
during competition.
 
► Evidence from retrospective studies of NSAID 
and AKI offers conflicting results, and while 
the majority show no ill effect, a randomised 
controlled trial has not fully explored this 
causative relationship.
What this study adds?
 
► This double-blind randomised placebo-
controlled trial showed increased rates of AKI 
in those who took ibuprofen, and although 
not statistically inferior to placebo by a small 
margin, there was a number needed to harm of 
5.5 people to cause 1 case of AKI.
 
► Consideration should be taken before ingesting 
NSAID during endurance running as it could 
exacerbate renal injury.
 
► AKI was associated with faster finishers 
and greater weight loss, suggesting that 
dehydration may play a role.

group of runners, but due to methodological constraints its 
conclusions were limited.12 To determine the effect of NSAID on 
AKI, we compared renal function among ultramarathon runners 
who were randomised to either ibuprofen or placebo during 
the course of a 50-mile (80 
km) foot race. We hypothesised that 
ibuprofen would not result in a significantly increased rate of 
AKI compared with placebo.
Methods
design and setting
We conducted a multisite, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind non-inferiority trial during the 50-mile (80 
km) 
fifth stage of the RacingThePlanet 7-day, six-stage 155 
mile 
(250 
km) ultramarathons.
study population
Eligible participants were between 18 and 75 
years of age who 
were enrolled at the 2015 Atacama Desert, Chile, Gobi Desert, 
China, Ecuadorian, and 2016 Sri Lankan ultramarathons. These 
events are run through wilderness terrain with few roads and 
varying topography. Participants carry all their personal items 
for the duration of the race, including gear, food (minimum of 
2000 calories/day) and clothing. All participants are offered the 
same amount of water each day (1.5 
L per 10–12 
km along the 
course of the stage), with a given allotment of time to complete 
each stage. These events comprised six stages run over 7 
days, 
with four consecutive single-day stages of 25 
miles (40 
km), with 
a 2-day fifth stage of 50 miles (80 
km), and a final single-day 
5–6-mile (10 
km) stage. Eligible participants had to understand 
English and be registered to run a RacingThePlanet event. 
Exclusion criteria included ingestion of NSAID or corticoste-
roids 12 
hours prior to stage 5 start, allergy to NSAID, preg-
nancy or suspected pregnancy and having one kidney or other 
known medical problem contraindicating NSAID use. The study 
was approved by Stanford University School of Medicine insti-
tutional review board.
Allocation
Protocol training was by study manual on procedures for blood 
collection and point-of-care analysis. Participants were assigned 
in a 1:1 ratio using computer-generated block randomisation. 
Medications were prepared by Advantage Pharmaceuticals 
(Rocklin, California, USA), and then packaged and randomised 
using a computer-generated random sequence by the investiga-
tional pharmacy at Stanford University Hospital. Randomisation 
and drug allocation occurred just prior to the start of the fifth 
stage.
study interventions
Study participants were randomised to either ibuprofen (400 
mg) 
or visually identical placebo taken every 4 
hours after the start of 
the fifth stage for the duration of the stage. As approximately 
80% of runner historically complete a RacingThePlanet 50-mile 
stage in <19 
hours, the upper quartile of ingested ibuprofen was 
estimated to be 1600 
mg.
We gathered informed consent and baseline demographics 
the day prior to the race start at race registration, with rando-
misation prior to the start of the fifth stage. Participants were 
weighed just before the start of the 50-mile (80 
km) stage 5 
with no pre-race phlebotomy. Each participant was weighed in 
running gear and shoes without a backpack, using a calibrated 
battery-operated digital scale (SC-505 HoMedics; Commerce 
Tsp, Michigan, USA) placed on a level surface. At the finish 
line of stage 5, or on removal from competition, weights were 
measured by the same procedure and fingertip blood samples 
obtained via lancet and capillary collection tube, then analysed 
immediately after collection using an iSTAT point-of-care anal-
yser (Abbott; East Windsor, New Jersey, USA). Evaluation of the 
study participant was performed immediately on completion 
of stage 5 before post-ace hydration could occur. We assessed 
protocol adherence by inspecting the plastic bag for remaining 
pills. If the participant had lost the bag, we assessed protocol 
compliance by interview. Both the point-of-care device and the 
digital scale were calibrated prior to taking measurements.
study outcomes
The primary outcome measure of AKI was by the established 
RIFLE criteria for severity of AKI as ‘risk’ of injury defined as 
1.5× estimated baseline Cr and ‘injury’, defined as 2× Cr.13 14 
These two categories of AKI were combined to calculate the 
total incidence of AKI. The application of a categorical analysis 
of AKI via the RIFLE criteria rather than analysis of Cr as a 
continuous variable allowed qualification of ibuprofen’s effect 
on AKI in descriptive terms consistent with prior ultramarathon 
studies.2–4
A baseline expected glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 
100 
mL/min was used when age was <40 
years, and 140 minus 
age when 40 
years or older.15 This estimated GFR was then used 
in the ‘modification of diet in renal disease’ equation to back-cal-
culate an estimated baseline Cr,16 with a numerator of 175 used 
for improved accuracy of the equation in a healthy population.17 
All participants who took supplemental NSAID or less than three 
study pills were considered to be non-compliant with the study 
protocol. For the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, all randomised 
participants except those who did not have a Cr measurement 
for primary study outcome were analysed in the group they were 
originally randomised to, regardless of compliance.
Secondary outcome measures were detailed prior to trial 
initiation and included incidence of exercise-associated hypo-
natremia (EAH) and Borg score survey for rating of perceived 
exertion at the fifth stage finish line as well as severity of AKI 
and change in Cr. The serum sodium cut-off points were the 
following: hypernatremia>145 
mmol/L, normonatremia 135 
–<145 
mmol/L, hyponatremia 130 –<135 
mmol/L and severe 
hyponatremia<130 
mmol/L. Weight change cut-off points were 
overhydration with a weight gain of >+0.0 
kg, euhydration = 
weight change between −0.01% and −3.0%, and dehydration 
= weight change >−3%.
statistical analysis
Estimated baseline renal function and subsequent AKI criteria 
were based on the assumption that healthy ultramarathon runners 
had normal renal function at the start of a race,3 4 and estimated 
GFR was accurate compared with calculated GFR under rest 
conditions in healthy subjects.18 Previous studies indicate that 
multistage ultramarathon runners experience non-statistically 
significant changes in Cr and sodium levels between pre-race 
levels and the start of successive stages of racing, allowing us to 
presume a normal baseline renal function at the start of stage 5.2
The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial, conducted 
with the primary outcome of AKI incidence and the null 
hypothesis that ibuprofen was worse than placebo regarding its 
detrimental effect on renal function during an ultramarathon. 
Before the study, an ad hoc verbal survey of ultramarathon 
runners during RacingThePlanet Iceland 2013 was conducted. 
The consensus was that a difference of <15% AKI incidence

would be an acceptable margin to accept potential renal injury 
for perceived analgesic benefits, and a greater incidence of AKI 
would discourage NSAID use. So assuming a clinically significant 
increase of AKI of 15% as the non-inferiority threshold, with 
incidence of AKI of 60% and β=20% 
and α (one-sided)=0.05, 
we estimated that enrolment of 115 total participants would 
allow us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude ibuprofen 
was not inferior to placebo and appropriate analgesia to ingest 
during an ultramarathon.
Outcomes were analysed in the ITT population in order to 
evaluate real-world race conditions. Additionally, we analysed 
per-protocol results for non-inferiority for both the primary 
and secondary outcomes to assess the effect of a complete 
treatment course. ITT analyses of univariate comparisons were 
performed with Pearson’s χ2 and Fisher’s exact tests for cate-
gorical variables, independent-sample t-tests for continuous 
variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-normally distrib-
uted variables. Logistic regression was used to examine multi-
variate risk factors that had significance of ∝<0.10 for ORs. 
Pearson’s correlation test was used to assess linear correlation 
between drug use (ibuprofen or placebo) and Cr changes from 
estimated to measured values to provide further insight into 
the different relationship in the two drugs. A one-sided Welch 
two-sample t-test was used to identify significant differences 
in measured Cr between treatment arms. p Values<0.05 were 
considered significant and 95% CIs used. All analyses were

results
Of 159 enrolled participants, 91 (57%) were randomised to 
either ibuprofen or placebo and received the medications, with 
89 participants (47% ibuprofen and 53% placebo) analysed for 
the study primary endpoint and who qualified for the ITT popu-
lation (figure 1). The most common reasons for study exclu-
sion included 43% who did not pick up the study medications, 
25% ingested NSAID<12 
hours prior to the start of stage 5 and 
another 16% who withdrew from the event prior to stage 5. 
T
wo participants were excluded due to equipment malfunction 
as study end-of-stage Cr levels could not be analysed. Baseline 
demographics of the ITT population are described in table 1, 
with characteristics that were not significantly different between 
treatment arms (p>0.1). The average amount of ibuprofen 
ingested was 1200 
mg, with 75% of participants taking between 
1200 and 1800 
mg.
The overall incidence of AKI was 44%. For the primary 
outcome in ITT analysis, ibuprofen increased the incidence of AKI 
by 18% (95% CI −4% to 41%), with a number needed to harm 
of 5.5. There was a statistically significant correlation between 
ibuprofen use and Cr change (r2=0.2, p<0.01) compared with 
placebo (r2=0.05, p=0.14) (figure 2).
In the secondary outcomes, there was a non-statistically 
significant greater severity of AKI in the ibuprofen group, with 
13% more meeting risk criteria (95% 
CI −9% to 34%) and 6% 
more meeting injury criteria (95% 
CI −10% to 21%) (table 2). 
Although AKI was different between the groups, there was not 
a significant difference in post-race Cr between the two groups 
(p=0.25, 95% 
CI −0.13 
to ∞). There were no statistically signif-
icant differences between intervention groups and incidence 
of EAH and Borg scale, although decreased sodium (increased 
EAH) was found in the NSAID group by 8% (table 2). Incidence 
and severity differences per treatment groups were similar in the 
per-protocol population (data not shown).
Slower finishers by quintile were less likely to encounter 
AKI (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.98), and each quintile of 
slower finishing performance reduced the odds of AKI by 
0.37. Greater weight loss was significantly associated with 
AKI, in both absolute loss (1 kg, p<0.02) and percentage 
change (1.3%, p<0.002, OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.63), where 
each 1% of weight loss increased the odds of AKI by 0.21. 
There were no significant effects on the primary outcome of 
AKI incidence between treatment groups and the prespecified

dIscussIon
This was the first double-blind randomised placebo-controlled 
trial to date that examined the causative effect of ibuprofen 
on AKI in ultramarathon runners. We found that runners who 
ingested an average of 1200 
mg ibuprofen over the course of 
a 50-mile (80 
km) foot race had a greater absolute rate of AKI 
compared with placebo. The severity of AKI was also worse 
in the ibuprofen group than the placebo group. Ibuprofen did 
not definitively demonstrate inferiority to placebo although it 
increased AKI by 18%, crossing the prespecified non-inferiority 
threshold of 15%. This approached, but did not reach, statis-
tical significance by a small margin. Our study did not reach 
the enrollment threshold powered to establish non-inferiority 
and had a high rate of attrition, which may have led to a type 
II error. However, as the upper 95% confidence limit for the 
primary outcome was 41% that far exceeded the non-inferiority 
margin, it is unlikely that the null hypothesis would be rejected 
and non-inferiority established with a larger cohort. As this trial 
was 40% larger than the only other prospective study on this 
subject,12 larger investigations into renal function and NSAID 
use of endurance runners may be logistically unfeasible.
We chose to power our study to a threshold effect size of 
15 percentage points as that would alter the behaviour of the 
athletes who routinely take this medication and encounter AKI. 
Healthy population-based studies have found the risk of symp-
tomatic acute renal disease caused by NSAID to be 1:100 000, 
spontaneously occurring in approximately 1%–5% of NSAID 
users that may translate to upwards of 2.5 
million adverse events 
annually.19 20 Extrapolating the potential for symptomatic renal 
injury from NSAID use in the general population to high-risk 
endurance runners, we feel the risks outweigh the benefits of 
NSAID use and alternative options for analgesia such as acet-
aminophen should be considered.
NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase, which prevents the break-
down of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins that contribute 
to renal vasodilation. Without these prostaglandins, there is 
reduced renal perfusion leading to impaired GFR. The injurious 
effects of renal hypoperfusion in endurance athletes may be 
exacerbated by rhabdomyolysis and resultant myoglobinaemia, a 
common occurrence in ultramarathoners whose average creatine 
kinase can range from 13 
000 
U/L to >40 
000 
UL.10 21 Our study 
attempted to evaluate the clinical impact of NSAID by Borg 
scale, which is a validated scale of perceived exertion to quan-
tify the physiological impact of exercise.22 23 As athletes ingest 
NSAID while exercising to minimise pain and optimise perfor-
mance, it was hypothesised that the ingested drug could decrease 
perceived exertion secondary to decreased impact of pain. While 
there was no difference in the cohorts and perceived exertion by 
the Borg scale, figure 3 shows a non-significant increased Borg 
score in those with AKI which may reflect subtle effects from 
AKI on perceived exertion.
Greater weight loss and finishing performance were both 
found to be independent risk factors for the development of 
AKI. The correlation between weight loss as a proxy for dehy-
dration and kidney injury has been shown in prior ultramarathon 
studies,3–5 which supports the deleterious effects of underhydra-
tion on renal perfusion. The slowest ultramarathon finishers 
have been found to be to 82% less likely than top finishers to 
encounter AKI, and slower finishing times may allow for greater 
hydration and minimise dehydration-induced kidney insult.3 As 
we were unable to quantify the amount of fluid ingested, the 
pathophysiology of dehydration and AKI could not be explored 
in this study.
There has been concern about the causative role of NSAID in 
EAH, although reports are conflicted and of questionable clin-
ical significance.24 EAH is recognised as a relatively common 
issue in endurance running events. While EAH is usually an 
asymptomatic biochemical diagnosis that most often manifests as 
non-specific symptoms, it is a potentially fatal disease. NSAIDs 
act as an antidiuretic during exercise through inhibition of pros-
taglandins, sodium excretion and free water clearance that may 
contribute to a dilutional hyponatremia. Similar to our findings, 
the one other prospective trial that examined NSAID use and 
EAH showed no effect on post-race sodium levels compared

the effect of NSAID on EAH. Hydration in endurance events 
should be dictated by a ‘drink to thirst’ strategy, and the theoret-
ical benefits of avoiding dehydration to minimise AKI should not 
be confused with overhydration, which should be avoided and is 
a risk factor for EAH morbidity and mortality.
This trial has several limitations. The average amount and rate 
of ibuprofen taken in our study in addition to distance covered 
may not be similar to other activities. However, as the observed 
total amount of NSAID ingested as well as distance run were 
both lower than the other prospective study which found no 
elevated creatinine in their cohort,12 we feel the results are likely 
generalisable to other events. Unfortunately, we were unable 
to gather baseline serum values and had to estimate the renal 
function to calculate AKI. Otherwise, the study would not have 
been feasible due to the 5–10 
min required per participant to 
obtain and analyse each individual blood sample immediately 
prior to the race start. Estimating normal baseline serum elec-
trolyte values in healthy runners is a well-established practice in 
ultramarathon research.2–4 It was unlikely there were spuriously 
elevated values from using an estimated baseline creatinine from 
the beginning of a mid-race stage as these Cr have been found 
to be similar to measured pre-race levels.2 Data from the four 
events were combined into a single cohort for analysis as each 
race had similar lengths and demands and grouped data between 
events is a common practice.3 25
conclusIon
This double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial showed 
increased rates of AKI in those who took ibuprofen, and although 
not statistically inferior to placebo by a small margin, there was 
a number needed to harm of 5.5 people to cause one case of 
AKI. Consideration should therefore be taken before ingesting 
NSAID during endurance running as it could exacerbate renal 
injury.
