Alterations of the dopaminergic (DAergic) system are frequently reported in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) patients and are commonly linked to cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms.
However, the cause of DAergic system dysfunction in AD remains to be elucidated.
We investigated alterations of the midbrain DAergic system in the Tg2576 mouse model of
AD, overexpressing a mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APPswe). Here, we found
an age-dependent DAergic neuron loss in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) at pre-plaque
stages, although substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) DAergic neurons were intact. The
selective VTA DAergic neuron degeneration results in lower DA outflow in the hippocampus
and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. The progression of DAergic cell death correlates with
impairments in CA1 synaptic plasticity, memory performance and food reward processing.
We conclude that in this mouse model of AD, degeneration of VTA DAergic neurons at
pre-plaque stages contributes to memory deficits and dysfunction of reward processing.

 A
lzheimer’s
disease
(AD)
is
a
neurological
disorder
characterized by cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms
that are associated with brain atrophy1,2. The main
histopathology accompanying AD involves the accumulation of
neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, resulting in a
progressive and massive neuronal loss that primarily affects the
hippocampus and cortex3–5.
The hippocampus is a critical brain structure for memory
formation6 and damage in this area is believed to be the principal
cause for memory loss in AD patients. The hippocampal
formation receives both cortical and sub-cortical inputs, the
latter arriving mainly from the ventral tegmental area (VTA),
locus coeruleus (LC), medial septal nucleus, raphe complex and
the nucleus basalis of Meynert, all modulating hippocampal
activity7–11.
Pioneering
neuropathological
observations
in
post-mortem AD brain12,13 demonstrated that the hippocampal
formation
and
extrinsic
(both
cortical
and
sub-cortical)
connections are disrupted at multiple levels, suggesting that the
progressive structural alterations in the different brain areas may
contribute to the worsening of memory and cognitive functions in
AD patients.
Consistent with these observations, several alterations in the
dopaminergic (DAergic) system have been reported in AD
patients, including reduced levels of dopamine (DA) and its
receptors14–16. One of the sources of DA in the hippocampus
derives from DAergic neurons in the VTA17. DA is a well-
recognized modulator of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and its
binding to DAergic receptors in the dorsal hippocampus is a
major determinant of memory encoding18–20. VTA DAergic
neurons also target the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and cerebral
cortex, mediating the control of incentive motivation and reward
processing17.
Owing to these functions of DA in the hippocampus and the
mesolimbic
system,
we
sought
to
establish
how
DAergic
transmission in the hippocampus and NAc is affected in
Tg2576 transgenic mice overexpressing the human APP695
protein with the ‘Swedish’ mutation (APPswe), which show
behavioural and histopathological abnormalities that closely
mimic early AD21. We hypothesized that damage of DAergic
neurons could contribute to the deterioration of memory and to
non-cognitive symptoms observed in these animals22–25 and,
plausibly, to early symptoms of AD patients26. We found a
significant loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH þ) DAergic
neurons in the VTA of Tg2576 mice, beginning at 3 months of
age. Degeneration is selective for the VTA as DAergic neurons in
the adjacent substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) were intact.
Moreover, basal outflow of DA in the hippocampus and NAc
shell is reduced, likely contributing to deficits in mesolimbic
cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Notably, stimulation of
the DAergic system by administration of the DA precursor
levodopa (L-DOPA) or with selegiline, a monoamine oxidase-B
inhibitor,
completely
rescues
CA1
synaptic
plasticity
and
dendritic spine density, and restores hippocampal post-synaptic
density (PSD) composition, memory deficits and impairment in
food reward processing. Our findings suggest a novel role for the
VTA in the pathophysiology of AD-like symptoms at pre-plaque
stages.
Results
DAergic neuron degeneration in the VTA at pre-plaque stages.
We used TH immunostaining to identify DAergic neurons in
Tg2576 and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice at different
postnatal ages, and performed stereological cell counts in the
VTA and SNpc of the midbrain (Fig. 1a). We observed a sig-
nificant loss of DAergic neurons in Tg2576 mice, beginning at 3
months of age (Fig. 1b). This reduction in TH þ cell number was
restricted to the VTA, as no difference was observed between
Tg2576 and WT mice in the SNpc at any age tested (Fig. 1b). In
contrast with TH þ cells, the number of TH � cells remained
constant (Fig. 1b), indicating that the decrease of TH þ cells in
the VTA of Tg2576 mice reflects a true loss of DAergic neurons
and not a mere loss of TH immunoreactivity or down-regulation
of TH expression. In agreement with the selective loss of VTA
DAergic neurons, we detected more shrunken appearance and
TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in the VTA of 3-month-old
Tg2576 mice, the age at which the TH þ cell number starts to
decline (Fig. 2a). To examine whether the neuronal apoptosis was
associated with increased reactive astrocytes, we analysed the
immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
an astrocyte cell marker. Consistent with greater neuronal
degeneration27, we found a significant rise in the number of
GFAP þ
cells in the VTA of 3-month-old Tg2576 mice,
demonstrating an increase in reactive astrocytes in response to
DAergic neuronal loss. Instead, GFAP immunoreactivity was
unchanged in the SNpc of 3-month-old Tg2576 mice, in line with
the observation that nigral DAergic neurons are intact (Fig. 2b).
We also examined the response of microglial cells using an
ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)-specific
antibody28. Microglial cells in the healthy brain exist in a
quiescent state (resting cells) with a relatively round cell body and
long, thin processes, whereas in the initial state of activation
(mildly activated) following brain damage, they proliferate
rapidly, cell bodies enlarge and processes retract or become
thicker29,30. In agreement with DAergic cell loss in the VTA, in
3-month-old Tg2576 animals we observed a change in microglial
morphology and a significant increase in the ratio of mildly
activated over resting cells, whereas microglia in the SNpc area
remained unchanged (Fig. 2c). Thus, the selective degeneration in
the VTA of Tg2576 mice is associated with apoptosis, increased
reactive astrocytes and microglial activation.
In order to test whether the increase in neuronal degeneration
in the VTA results from extracellular amyloid-b (Ab)-plaque
deposition, we examined the accumulation of Ab deposits in
midbrain DAergic neurons and in projection areas such as the
hippocampus, dorsal striatum and NAc31–33. We found that
extracellular Ab-plaque deposition was absent in 6-month-old
mice
in
all
of
the
above-mentioned
regions.
However,
we observed more intense cytoplasmic staining for APPswe in
the hippocampus and NAc shell of Tg2576 mice compared to the
other areas (Supplementary Fig. 1a). This was also confirmed
by western blot analysis of full-length APPswe protein levels
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). Importantly, DAergic neurons showed
diffuse intracellular staining, and this was similar in the VTA and
SNpc, suggesting the absence of intracellular Ab accumulation
in VTA neurons that could account for the selective cell
degeneration (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Extracellular Ab-plaque
deposition
was
detected
in
the
hippocampus
of
aging
(11-month-old)
Tg2576
mice,
but
not
in
the
VTA
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). These data indicate that the apoptotic
cell death observed in VTA DAergic neurons as early as 3 months
occurs at hippocampal pre-plaque stages in this animal model
and does not appear to result from local Ab-plaque deposition in
the VTA.
Reduced DA in the NAc shell and food reward deficits.
Midbrain DAergic neurons project to the striatum and NAc
topographically along the mediolateral axis: the shell subregion
of the NAc is innervated by medially located VTA neurons
mediating motivation, reward-related cognition and multiple
forms of memory; the NAc core is innervated by lateral VTA and
medial SNpc neurons influencing motor responses related to

 reward stimuli, whereas the dorsal striatum is almost exclusively
innervated by laterally located SNpc neurons controlling volun-
tary movement32,34,35. To determine whether the selective loss of
DAergic neurons affects the release of DA in projecting areas that
are associated with the VTA, but not with the SNpc, we first
measured DA outflow in the NAc shell and core and in the dorsal
striatum, using amperometric recordings of DA release in acute
brain slices (Fig. 3a). In 6-month-old Tg2576 mice, when the
DAergic neuronal loss in the VTA reaches a plateau (Fig. 1a), the
evoked DA was significantly decreased in the NAc shell (Fig. 3b).
Instead, no difference was observed in the NAc core or in the
striatum (Fig. 3b). In addition, in 2-month-old mice, when the
number of DAergic neurons in the Tg2576 VTA is still
unchanged compared to WT animals, the release of DA in the
NAc shell is similar between genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
These data show that in Tg2576 mice DA outflow in the NAc
shell is normal before the onset of DAergic cell death and suggest
that its reduction in the NAc shell at 6 months results from VTA
DAergic neuronal loss. Consistent with the amperometric results,
staining for the DA transporter (DAT), used as a specific marker
of DAergic terminals, was reduced in the NAc shell, but not in the
NAc core of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice (Fig. 3c).
Microdialysis experiments performed on freely moving animals
confirmed the reduced outflow of DA in the NAc shell of
6-month-old Tg2576 mice (Fig. 3d). Surprisingly, in vivo
microdialysis detected significantly reduced levels of basal DA
also in the striatum (Fig. 3e). Considering that both the SNpc
DAergic neurons (Fig. 1b) and striatal DA release by phasic
DAergic activity (Fig. 3b) were intact in Tg2576 mice, it is likely
that the reduced basal levels of DA in the striatum might reflect
alterations in the control of tonic DA release36,37.
Due to the importance of the mesolimbic system for reward
and motivation processing33,38, we examined whether the
reduced outflow of DA from the VTA to the NAc shell could
be associated with dysfunctional mesolimbic reward-associated
processing
in
Tg2576
mice.
To
this
end,
we
measured
the responses of 6-month-old mice in a chocolate-elicited
conditioned
place
preference
(CPP)
task
(Supplementary
Fig. 2b). During the pre-conditioning session, mice were left to
freely explore a two-chamber apparatus. Irrespective of genotype,
all animals spent equal amounts of time in both chambers,
showing no preference for either compartment (Supplementary
Fig. 2c). Exposure to palatable food in WT mice resulted in a
significant increase in the time spent in the chocolate-paired
chamber during the testing phase (Fig. 3f). In contrast, place
conditioning was absent in Tg2576 mice: these animals spent
equal amounts of time in the chocolate-paired chamber during
the pre-conditioning and testing session and failed to develop any
preference for the chamber with the rewarding food (Fig. 3f).
In addition, Tg2576 mice consumed less chocolate during the
conditioning phase (Fig. 3g). The reduction in place preference
during palatable food-seeking, together with decreased chocolate

 ingestion, are consistent with depletion of DA from the NAc shell
where DA governs reward and effort-related decision-making33,38
and argue for deficits in reward-associated cognition and for
depressive-like symptoms in 6-month-old Tg2576 mice. In
2-month-old Tg2576 mice, when the outflow of DA in the NAc
shell is still normal, there is no impairment in place preference or
food consumption (Supplementary Fig. 2d,e).
Reduced DA in the hippocampus and memory impairments.
The DAergic projections from the VTA to the hippocampus form
the upward arm of a functional loop that controls novel memory
formation31, with DA playing an important role in modulating
hippocampal synaptic plasticity and function18–20,39. In light of
the degeneration of the VTA DAergic neurons in Tg2576 mice,
we investigated a possible depletion of DA outflow in the

 hippocampus and whether this could be correlated with memory
performance impairments in these mice.
Because DAergic innervation of the hippocampus is sparser
than that of the NAc, amperometric recordings of DA release in
acute hippocampal brain slices was not feasible. However,
microdialysis experiments on freely moving animals indicated a
reduced DA outflow in the hippocampus of 6-month-old Tg2576
mice compared to age-matched controls (Fig. 4a). On the other
hand, noradrenaline outflow in the hippocampus did not differ
between genotypes (Fig. 4b), suggesting that at this age the
noradrenergic projection from the LC is preserved. Considering
that LC TH þ neurons can also co-release DA together with
noradrenaline40,41 and that the majority of THþ projections in the
hippocampus originate from the LC41,42, we performed a stereo-
logical cell-count of THþ neurons in the LC of 6-month-old
Tg2576 mice. LC stereological cell-count confirmed that, at this
age, the number of THþ neurons in this brain region did not
differ between genotypes (Fig. 4c,d). These data suggest that the
reduced DA outflow in the hippocampus of 6-month-old Tg2576
mice is principally due to the established VTA DAergic neuron
degeneration, although reduced axonal DA release from LC THþ
neurons cannot be excluded, especially in older animals43,44. In line
with these data, we found that both the TH protein levels (Fig. 4e,
Supplementary Fig. 6a) and TH immunoreactivity (Fig. 4f) in the
hippocampus were significantly reduced in 6-month-old Tg2576
mice. Instead, TH protein levels of Tg2576 were identical to
WT animals in the striatum (Fig. 4g, Supplementary Fig. 6b),
in accordance with amperometric data in this area and the
observation that SNpc DAergic neurons, mainly projecting to the
striatum, are still intact at this age.

 Earlier studies describe structural alterations in hippocampal
synapses and impairments in synaptic plasticity in Tg2576 mice
that may underlie some of the cognitive deficits in these
animals22–24. We and others have previously shown that in
3-month-old animals, at the age of onset of DAergic cell death,
long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA3-to-CA1 synapses of Tg2576
mice is unaffected24,25 while PSD composition changes already
occur, with reduced levels of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit,
decreased density of CA1 pyramidal neuron dendritic spines and
altered glutamatergic transmission25. Here, in order to investigate
whether synaptic impairments in the Tg2576 hippocampus
parallel
the
advancement
of
VTA
DAergic
cell
loss,
we
measured LTP in CA3-to-CA1 synapses in 2- and 6-month-old
Tg2576
mice.
In
2-month-old
animals,
when
DAergic
neuron numbers in the VTA are still intact, LTP in Tg2576
animals
did
not
differ
significantly
from
age-matched
controls (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Instead, LTP magnitude was
significantly lower in 6-month-old Tg2576 mice (Fig. 4h), an age
at which VTA DAergic cell death is pronounced and DA outflow
in the hippocampus is significantly reduced. Thus, in Tg2576
mice potentiation at CA3-to-CA1 synapses deteriorates with age
and this impairment appears to follow the advancement of VTA
DAergic cell death. In contrast to LTP, short-term potentiation
was unchanged in 6-month-old Tg2576 mice as the paired-pulse
ratio (PPR) was similar between genotypes at the different
interpulse
intervals
tested
(Supplementary
Fig.
3b).
The
input–output relationship was also similar between WT and
Tg2576 mice, indicating no change in basal synaptic transmission
(Supplementary Fig. 3c).
As
PSD
modifications
precede
functional
alterations
of
synapses25, we analysed protein expression in the hippocampal
PSD fraction in 6-month-old Tg2576 mice. Consistent with our
previous observations in 3-month-old animals25, the surface
expression of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit was down-regulated in

 6-month-old Tg2576 mice (Fig. 4i, Supplementary Figs 3d,e
and 6c). Conversely, we found that the hippocampal levels of D1
receptors increased significantly in the PSD of Tg2576 mice,
suggesting the development of a compensatory response to low
levels of basal DA. We did not observe differences in other post-
synaptic components, including D2 receptors (Fig. 4i).
Finally, we examined the development of memory deficits in a
contextual fear-conditioning (CFC) task. During CFC, the total
freezing time after re-exposure to an aversive context declined in
6-month-old Tg2576 mice (Fig. 4j, Supplementary Fig. 3f).
Importantly, as previously reported23,25, memory deficits were
absent in 2-month-old Tg2576 mice (Supplementary Fig. 3g),
in line with the absence of DAergic cell death in the VTA before
3 months of age.
L-DOPA and selegiline restore memory and reward deficits.
Previous studies have shown that pharmacological manipulations
aimed at increasing the DAergic transmission in the hippo-
campus and cortex could improve synaptic functions, cognitive
impairments and memory deficits in AD patients45–48 and AD-
like experimental models49–53. Prompted by the finding that
DAergic cell death progression in the VTA occurs around the
time of worsening of synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits in
the Tg2576 hippocampus, we hypothesized that the enhancement
of the DAergic tone could improve the hippocampal alterations.
To this aim we examined the effects of sub-chronic treatment
with the DA precursor
L-DOPA on hippocampal synaptic
plasticity (see Supplementary Fig. 4a for drug administration
protocol). Six-month-old WT animals sub-chronically treated
with L-DOPA had a slight, yet not significant increase in the
magnitude of CA3-to-CA1 LTP compared to saline-treated
(sham)
controls
(Fig.
5a).
On
the
other
hand,
L-DOPA
treatment rescued LTP deficits in Tg2576 mice by restoring
LTP to the levels of WT animals (Fig. 5a). The rescue effect of
L-DOPA in Tg2576 mice was reproduced by acute, bath-
application of L-DOPA (10 mM) during LTP recordings and it
was mimicked by the selective D1/D5 receptor agonist SKF38393
(10 mM; Supplementary Fig. 4b). On the other hand, quinpirole
(100 nM), a selective D2 receptor agonist, failed to change LTP in
slices from Tg2576 mice, suggesting that the rescue of LTP
following L-DOPA treatment and increased DA availability is
mediated by D1/D5 receptors.
To confirm these data and examine the long-term effects of the
increased availability of endogenous DA, we treated 6-month-old
animals
with
selegiline,
an
irreversible
selective
inhibitor
of monoamine oxidase-B (ref. 54; Supplementary Fig. 4c).
Microdialysis experiments on freely moving animals confirmed
that sub-chronic treatment with selegiline increased DA outflow
in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice (Supplementary Fig. 4d).
Similarly to
L-DOPA, selegiline treatment rescued the LTP
magnitude in 6-month-old Tg2576 mice, without affecting WT
animals (Fig. 5b). Thus, both exogenously (L-DOPA) and
endogenously (selegiline)-induced increases in DA availability
improved hippocampal plasticity, supporting our hypothesis that
the reduced DA outflow in the AD hippocampus worsens
synaptic dysfunctions in Tg2576 mice.
As expected, selegiline failed to rescue TH levels in 6-month-
old Tg2576 mice (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 7a). However, the
selegiline-induced increase in DA availability restored GluA1
phosphorylation (Ser845) levels in Tg2576 mice while having no
effect in controls (Fig. 6a). This activity appeared to depend on
the effects of selegiline on D1 exposure because it triggered the
removal of D1 receptors from the PSD in both WT and Tg2576
mice (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 7b), likely as compensatory
response to DA availability. The activation of D1 receptors was
followed by the increase of GluA1 expression in the PSD (Fig. 6b),
in line with previous reports55,56. Similar results were also
obtained by
L-DOPA sub-chronic treatment that led to a
restoration of both D1 receptors and GluA1 expression in
hippocampal PSD fractions (Fig. 6c, Supplementary Fig. 7c). The
recovery of the hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synaptic plasticity and
PSD composition in Tg2576 mice by selegiline was also correlated
with the restoration of spine density in pyramidal neuron apical
dendrites located in the CA1 stratum radiatum (Fig. 6d,e).
In view of the fact that treatments with L-DOPA or selegiline
improve hippocampal synaptic plasticity and PSD composition,
we then asked whether the impaired memory function in Tg2576
mice could be ameliorated with treatment. Indeed, both selegiline
(Supplementary Fig. 5a) and L-DOPA (Supplementary Fig. 4a)
treatments increased the total freezing time elicited by re-
exposure to aversive stimuli during a CFC task in 6-month-old
Tg2576 mice (Fig. 7a,b, Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). Furthermore,
selegiline improved spatial memory of Tg2576 mice, as indicated
by the increased distance travelled in the target quadrant that
previously contained the escape platform during the Probe phase
of a Morris water maze test (Fig. 7c, Supplementary Fig. 5d–f).
Finally, we investigated whether the selegiline treatment could
restore the defects in CPP and food consumption observed in
Tg2576 mice during the CPP test (Supplementary Fig. 5g).
As expected, although saline-treated Tg2576 animals were unable
to show increased preference for the chamber associated with
the rewarding food and consumed less chocolate during the
conditioning phase, these deficits were absent from selegiline-
treated mice (Fig. 7d,e). We conclude that the increased
availability of DA in the hippocampus and NAc can ameliorate
mnesic deficits and impairment in mesolimbic reward processing
in 6-month-old Tg2576 mice.
Discussion
In recent years accumulating evidence has demonstrated a
link between AD-related memory dysfunction and deficits in
DA signalling in patients and experimental models of AD
(refs 49–52,56–61). Here, in a mouse model of AD, at a stage
when no Ab-plaque deposition, hyperphosphorylated tau tangles
or any sign of neuronal loss in cortical and hippocampal regions
involved in memory deficits has yet occurred21,23,24, we provide
evidence that a specific apoptotic process is taking place in the
VTA, causing a progressive degeneration of the DAergic neuronal
population. This neuronal loss is selective for the VTA DAergic
neurons, as demonstrated by the finding that the number of TH �
neurons remains substantially unchanged.
The loss of VTA DAergic neurons is paralleled by a reduced
outflow of DA in the hippocampus and in the shell region of the
NAc. Curiously, DA outflow to the NAc core (and DAT levels)
was unchanged in Tg2576 mice, even though this region is
heavily innervated by VTA DAergic neurons34. However, it
should be noted that the NAc shell and core are innervated by
anatomically distinct subpopulations of highly heterogeneous
VTA neurons regarding their properties34,62,63, with the majority
of shell-projecting neurons located in the paranigral nucleus in
the medial VTA and the majority of core-projecting neurons
located in the parabrachial pigmented area of the lateral
VTA34,35, suggesting that medial VTA DAergic neurons may
show more vulnerability in Tg2576 mice.
The reduced DA outflow in the Tg2576 hippocampus and
NAc shell, brain areas primarily implicated in memory and
reward, respectively, might largely contribute to the deficits of
hippocampus-dependent memory and synaptic plasticity, as well
as impairment in reward processing. We found that the
progression of these deficits in the Tg2576 mouse model follows

 the onset of VTA neuronal degeneration at 3 months of age.
Accordingly, hippocampal synaptic plasticity and PSD composi-
tion, pyramidal neuron spine density, mnesic performances and
reward processing, are all improved by stimulating the DA system
with administration of L-DOPA or with reduction of endogenous
DA degradation with selegiline. It is worth noting that, although
we confirmed that selegiline treatment increased DA outflow
in the hippocampus, we cannot exclude that the rescue of
behavioural deficits might involve additional brain regions.
Although the effectiveness of selegiline as a pharmacological
agent in human patients is controversial64, we used this inhibitor
with the specific goal of enhancing the DAergic signal. It should
be noted, however, that the effectiveness of selegiline could be
dependent on the degree of VTA neurodegeneration.
Although
the
present
observations
are
obtained
in
an
experimental model of AD, they might provide an intriguing
explanation to recent observations in AD patients26 indicating
that the clinical diagnosis of dementia is associated with early
non-cognitive symptoms, such as depression and apathy. Thus, it
is possible that early degeneration of VTA DAergic neurons could
account for the worsening of memory as well as for at least part of
the non-cognitive symptoms reported in early AD patients. In
fact, we provide evidence that the early neuronal apoptotic cell
death observed in VTA DAergic neurons occurs at hippocampal
pre-plaque stages in our animal model, and does not appear to
result from local Ab-plaque deposition in the VTA. Although we
cannot exclude the accumulation of other Ab aggregation forms
in VTA neurons, we did not observe any abnormal pattern in the
distribution of APPswe immunofluorescence that could suggest a
link between intracellular Ab and cell degeneration.
What is the mechanism underlying the selective vulnerability
of VTA DAergic neurons to APPswe overexpression? The
observation that DAergic neurons are lost in the VTA, while
being spared in the SNpc, is a somehow symmetrical picture to
what researchers involved in Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been
addressing for many years, trying to explain the selective loss of
DAergic neurons in the SNpc, while neurons are largely spared in
the VTA. A tempting hypothesis is that the selectivity of the
midbrain cell population undergoing neuronal loss may be the
result of a dying-back mechanism initiated at the axon terminals,
whereby degenerative processes originating in the hippocampus
and NAc cause VTA DAergic neuron loss in AD, while in PD
analogous processes in the striatum lead to selective loss in the
SNpc
(ref.
65).

 monoaminergic fibres without local amyloid pathology has been
described in AD (refs 44,59,66–68). Alternatively, several lines of
evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is present both
in AD and PD. The diverse physiology of midbrain DAergic
neurons might provide the answers needed to understand this
mystery69 making it possible that APPswe overexpression could
have different effects in the two brain areas.
Although the molecular mechanisms underlying early VTA
DAergic neuron degeneration remain to be elucidated, our results
suggest the VTA as an important area of the brain to consider in
the context of AD.
Methods
Animals and pharmacological treatments. Heterozygous Tg2576 mice21 and
WT littermates were used at ages ranging from 2 to 11 months old, as described in
the text. Only male subjects were used. Experiments were carried out in accordance
with the ethical guidelines of the European Communities Council Directive
(2010/63/EU). Experimental approval was obtained from the Italian Health
Ministry (protocol #1191/2015PR).
Animals used for L-DOPA experiments were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.)
with 10 mg kg � 1 L-DOPA plus 12 mg kg � 1 benserazide (both from Sigma-
Aldrich) dissolved in saline, or with 0.9% saline only (sham) once a day for three
consecutive evenings and 1 h before experimental session (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
Animals used for selegiline experiments were subcutaneously injected with
3 mg kg � 1 selegiline (R-( � )-deprenyl hydrochloride, Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in
0.9% saline (sel) or with 0.9% saline only (sham). For a detailed description of the
timeline of selegiline treatment for different experiments see Supplementary Figs 4c
and 5a,d,g. For all treatments, injection volume was 5 ml per animal weight in
grams.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Mice were anaesthetized with
Rompun (20 mg ml � 1, 0.5 ml kg � 1, i.p., Bayer) and Zoletil (100 mg ml � 1,
0.5 ml kg � 1, Virbac) and perfused transcardially with 50 ml saline followed by
50 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB; 0.1 M, pH 7.4). The brains
were postfixed in paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 �C and then immersed in a 30%
sucrose solution at 4 �C. The brains were cut into 30 mm-thick coronal sections
using a freezing microtome.
The sections selected for immunohistochemistry (every second slice was
processed for a total of 9 sections) were processed with a rabbit anti-TH antibody.
The endogenous peroxidise was neutralized with a 0.3% H2O2 solution in PB. The
sections were incubated overnight at 4 �C with the primary antibody diluted in PB
containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After three washes in PB, sections were incubated
with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories,
West Grove, PA, USA) followed by the avidin–biotin-peroxidase method
(Vectastain, ABC kit, Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) and using the chromogen
3,30-diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Finally, sections were counterstained with Nissl
staining, dehydrated and coverslipped with Entellan (Sigma).
For TH/GFAP, TH/Iba1, TH/NeuroTrace staining and for TH/APPswe,
NeuroTrace/APPswe deposition, slices were incubated overnight with primary
antibodies in PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 2 h at room
temperature with secondary antibodies.
For DAT quantification, acute coronal brain slices (see below) were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde in PB and transferred to 30% sucrose in PB at 4 �C.
Slices were incubated for 2 days with primary antibodies in PB containing
1% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with
secondary antibodies. DAT levels (F/A) and TH levels (F/A) were quantified with
ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) as mean signal fluorescence intensity (F) on a
defined area (A). Quantification was done on eight samples per mouse.
For the analysis of GFAP, Iba1 and DAT markers, images were taken as
Z-stacks and these Z-stack images were then processed by maximum intensity
projection. All samples were acquired with the same Z-stack thickness and the
same laser settings. Data collection for densitometry was done by a researcher blind
to the genotype of each animal.
Primary antibodies: TH (1:700, Millipore; MAB318; RRID: AB_2201528),
GFAP (1:200, DAKO, Z0334; RRID: AB_2314535), hAPP695 (APPswe, 1:500,
Biolegend, #803001; RRID: AB_2564653), DAT (1:200, Chemicon, MAB369;
RRID: AB_2190413), Iba1 (1:400, Wako #019-19741; RRID: AB_839504).
Secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; RRID:
AB_2535792), Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200; RRID:
AB_2536180) and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; RRID:
AB_2536182).
The sections were counterstained with NeuroTrace 640/660 deep-red
Fluorescent Nissl Stain (1:200, Invitrogen), mounted using an anti-fade medium
(Fluoromount, Sigma-Aldrich) and examined under a confocal laser-scanning
microscope (LSM700, Zeiss). The specificity of the immunohistochemical labelling
was confirmed by the omission of primary antibodies and the use of normal serum
instead (negative controls).
All images were exported in tagged image file format (TIFF), contrast and
brightness were adjusted and final plates were composed with Adobe Illustrator CS3.
Stereological analysis. Sections processed for immunohistochemistry were used
for obtaining unbiased estimates of total number of TH þ and TH � neurons in the
SNpc and VTA and TH þ neurons in the LC. The boundaries of these areas in the
mouse brain were defined by TH staining, and area distinction was performed
according to published guidelines70. We applied an optical fractionator
stereological design (bilateral count) using the Stereo Investigator System
(MicroBrightField Europe e.K.). A stack of MAC 5000 controller modules
(Ludl Electronic Products, Ltd) was interfaced with an Olympus BX50 microscope
with a motorized stage and a HV-C20 Hitachi digital camera with a Pentium II PC
workstation. A three-dimensional optical fractionator counting probe (x, y, z
dimension of 50 � 50 � 25 mm) was applied. The brain areas of VTA and SNpc
were outlined using the 5 � objective and neuronal cells were marked with a � 100
oil-immersion objective. The brain area of LC was outlined using the � 5 objective
and cells were marked with a � 40 oil-immersion objective. Data collection for cell
counting was done by a researcher blind to the genotype of each animal.
Neurons were considered TH þ if they showed cytoplasmatic TH
immunoreactivity, while they were considered TH � if the nucleus was clearly
visualized but cytoplasmic TH staining was absent.
The total neuronal number (TH þ and TH � for VTA and SNpc; TH þ for LC)
was estimated according to the formula:
N ¼ SQ�1=ssf�1=asf�1=tsf
where SQ represents the number of neurons counted in all optically sampled fields
of the area of interest (VTA, SNpc or LC), ssf is the section sampling fraction, asf is
the area sampling fraction and tsf is the thickness sampling fraction.
In situ end labelling of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL). For TUNEL staining,
brains were removed as before and cut in coronal slices (10 mm thickness). Every
tenth slice was processed for TUNEL. After removal of paraffin with xylene and
rehydration in ethanol solutions of decreasing concentration, sections were
digested with proteinase K (20 mg ml � 1, 15 min), washed in distilled water and
exposed briefly to 3% H2O2. The TUNEL reaction was performed using the
Apoptag Plus Peroxidase In-Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore).
TUNEL-positive cells were revealed with diaminobenzidine and H2O2 according to
the supplier’s instructions. Stained slices were lightly Nissl-counterstained with
cresyl violet. Cells were defined as apoptotic if they were TUNEL-positive or if they
showed typical nuclei with condensed chromatin or nuclear fragmentation or both.
TUNEL-positive cells within the anatomical boundaries of VTA and SNpc (ref. 70)
were counted at � 100 magnification with a Leitz DMRB microscope.
Microdialysis. Mice, anaesthetized with Zoletil and Rompun, were mounted on a
stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) and implanted unilaterally with
microdialysis probes 24–36 h before experiments. The concentric dialysis probes
(AN69 fibres, Hospal Dasco) were implanted vertically at the level of the hippo-
campus (AP � 3.0, ML±2.7 from bregma)70, NAc shell (AP þ 1.6, ML±0.2) and
striatum (AP þ 1.0, ML±1.8). The probe lengths were 5 mm for hippocampus
(3 mm membrane), 5.5 mm for NAc shell (1 mm) and 4.5 mm for striatum (2 mm).
Each probe was fixed and the skin was sutured. Mice were returned to their home
cages and the outlet and inlet probe tubing were protected by locally applied
parafilm. Membranes were tested for in vitro recovery before surgery. On the day
of the experiment each animal was placed in a circular cage containing
microdialysis equipment: the microdialysis probe was connected to a CMA/100
pump (Carnegie Medicine) through PE-20 tubing and an ultra low torque
multichannel power-assisted swivel (Model MCS5, Instech Laboratories) to allow
free movement. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; in mM: NaCl 140; KCl 4;
CaCl2 1.2; MgCl2 1) was pumped through the dialysis probe (2.1 ml min � 1).
Following the start of the dialysis perfusion, mice were left undisturbed for B1 h
before the collection of three baseline samples to calculate the average basal
concentration. Dialysate samples were collected every 20 min for 60 min. Brains
were then postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cut in coronal slices (100 mm) and
processed for methylene blue staining. The correct positioning of the probes was
confirmed under a microscope. Data from animals not showing proper placement
were discarded.
Each dialysate sample (20 ml) was analysed by ultra-performance liquid
chromatography. Concentrations (pg 20 ml � 1) were not corrected for probe
recovery. The ultra-performance liquid chromatography apparatus (ACQUITY,
Waters Corporation) was coupled to an amperometric detector (Decade II, Antec
Leyden) containing an in situ Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an electrochemical
flow-cell (VT-03, Antec Leyden) with a 0.7 mm glassy carbon electrode, mounted
with a 25 mm spacer. The electrochemical flow-cell, set at a potential of 400 mV,
was positioned immediately after a BEH C18 column (2.1 � 50 mm, 1.7 mm particle
size; Waters Corporation). The column was kept at 37 �C (0.07 ml min � 1 flow
rate). The composition of the mobile phase was (in mM): 50 phosphoric acid, 8
KCl, 0.1 EDTA, 2.5 1-octanesulfonic acid sodium salt, 12% MeOH and pH 6.0
adjusted with NaOH. Peak height obtained by oxidation of DA and noradrenaline
was compared with that produced by a standard. The detection limit was 0.1 pg.

 Acute brain slice preparation for electrophysiology. Acute brain slices
(250–300 mm) were obtained following halothane anaesthesia and decapitation.
The brain was rapidly removed and coronal slices containing the striatum and NAc
core/shell or parasagittal slices containing the dorsal hippocampus were cut with a
vibratome (VT1200S, Leica) in chilled bubbled (95% O2, 5% CO2) aCSF containing
(in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 3, NaH2PO4 1.25, NaHCO3 26, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2, glucose
10 (B290 mOsm, pH 7.4). Slices were incubated for 1 h in aCSF at 32 �C and then
transferred at room temperature for at least 30 min before recordings. A single
brain slice was transferred to a recording chamber and completely submerged in
aCSF (3–4 ml min � 1; 32 �C).
Constant potential amperometry. Amperometric detection of DA in acute brain
slices containing the striatum and the NAc was performed using carbon fibre
electrodes (diameter 30 mm, length 100 mm, World Precision Instruments)
positioned near a bipolar Ni/Cr stimulating electrode, to a depth of 50–150 mm into
the coronal slice. The imposed voltage (MicroC potentiostat, World Precision
Instruments) between the carbon fibre electrode and the Ag/AgCl pellet was 0.55 V.
For stimulation, a single rectangular electrical pulse was applied using a DS3
Stimulator (Digitimer) every 5 min along a range of stimulation intensities
(20–1,000 mA, 20–40 ms duration). In response to a protocol of increasing
stimulation, a plateau of DA release was reached at the maximal stimulation
intensity (1,000 mA, 40 ms). Signals were digitized with Digidata 1440A coupled
to a computer running pClamp 10 (both from Molecular Devices). Electrode
calibration was performed at the end of each experiment by bath-perfused DA
(0.3–10 mM).
Multielectrode array recordings. A parasagittal acute slice containing the dorsal
hippocampus was placed over an 8 � 8 array of planar electrodes, each 50 � 50 mm
in size, with an interpolar distance of 150 mm (MED-P5155, Alpha MED Sciences),
adjusted so that the entire CA1 pyramidal layer and stratum radiatum were covered
with underlying electrodes. The slice was kept submerged using a platinum ring
covered with nylon mesh. Voltage signals were recorded with the MED64 System
(Alpha MED Sciences) and digitized at 20 kHz followed by filtering at 0.1–1 Hz
with a 6071E Data Acquisition Card (National Instruments), using Mobius
software (Alpha MED Sciences). Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs)
were evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation (100 ms duration) through one of the
64 planar electrodes placed in the stratum radiatum. The recording channel with
the highest fEPSP amplitude, at a distance of at least 300 mm from the stimulation
site, was chosen as recording site. Input–output curves were obtained by measuring
the fEPSP initial slope at increasing 5 mA steps of afferent stimulation, delivered
every 30 s. PPR was evaluated with pairs of stimuli, at half-maximal amplitude,
separated by 20–500 ms. For LTP experiments, after at least 20 min of test
stimulation (half-maximal shock, every 30 s) to assess fEPSP slope stability, the
slice was challenged with a conditioning train at 100 Hz for 1 s, followed by test
stimulation for at least 1 h. The degree of LTP was evaluated by the fEPSP mean
slope at 55–60 min from the conditioning train, normalized to the mean slope
during baseline. To study the acute effect of L-DOPA (Tocris) and of the selective
DA receptor agonists SKF38393 (D1 receptor; Tocris) and quinpirole (D2 receptor;
Tocris) on LTP, slices were continuously perfused throughout the experiment
with aCSF containing the drugs at their final concentrations, prepared from
concentrated stocks.
Total protein extraction. The striatum was dissected from acute coronal
brain slices; the hippocampus was isolated from the entire brain. Tissues were
homogenized in lysis buffer containing (in mM) 320 sucrose, 50 NaCl, 50 Tris-HCl
pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 5 b-glycerophosphate, 5 NaF
and protease inhibitor cocktail, incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at
15,000 g for 10 min. The total protein content of the supernatant was determined
by the Bradford method.
To evaluate APPswe levels, the hippocampus was dissected from parasagittal
brain slices; NAc and striatum were dissected from coronal brain slices; VTA
was dissected from horizontal brain slices. Tissues were homogenized in RIPA
buffer containing (in mM) 50 Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 NaCl, 5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA,
1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 sodium orthovanadate,
5 b-glycerophosphate, 5 NaF and protease inhibitor cocktail, sonicated and
incubated on ice for 20 min. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000g for 20 min
and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford
method.
Place conditioning task. To evaluate palatable food-induced CPP, we used a
two-chamber apparatus made of two Plexiglas chambers (15 � 15 � 20 cm) that
differ in the pattern and the colour of the grid, connected by a central compartment
(15 � 5 � 20 cm) with two sliding doors (4 � 20 cm). In each chamber two
triangular parallelepipeds (5 � 5 � 20 cm), made of black Plexiglas and arranged in
various patterns, were used as conditioned stimuli. The lighting conditions (visual
and tactile cues) were adjusted to prevent preference for a certain chamber. On the
pre-conditioning day, each mouse was left in the central alley and allowed free
access and exploration of the adjacent chambers of the apparatus, in the absence of
food for 15 min. During the following 6 days (conditioning session), each mouse
was confined daily for 30 min alternately in one of the two chambers. One of the
patterns was consistently paired with palatable food (0.5 g milk chocolate, Milka
Alpine Milk Chocolate providing 5.31 kcal g � 1 of energy; paired chamber) and the
other with regular chow (RC, Mucedola 4RF21 diet; unpaired chamber). The RC
pellet and the chocolate portion provided each day were designed to be isocaloric.
Animals were randomly assigned to consume either chocolate or control diet. For
each genotype group pairings were counterbalanced so that in half of the group
chocolate was paired with one of the patterns and in the other half with the other.
Testing was conducted on post-conditioning day using the pre-conditioning
procedure during which the total time spent in each chamber was recorded.
Animal behaviour was recorded with a CCD video camera, the signal was digitized
and transferred to a computer. Data were analysed with the EthoVision XT
software (Noldus) to obtain the time spent during pre- and post-conditioning
sessions for each subject, used as raw data for preference scores in each sector of
the apparatus. Chocolate consumption was assessed by averaging, after weighting,
the residual amount of food at the end of chocolate-receiving days.
Contextual fear-conditioning test. The apparatus consisted of a 21 � 21 � 49 cm
chamber (Ugo Basile) with grey Plexiglas walls and transparent ceiling to allow
video recordings. The grid floor (steel pieces spaced by 1.5 cm) was connected to a
shock generator scrambler. The CFC test encompassed two sessions: training and
context test. During training each mouse was placed in the chamber for 2 min of
free exploration, followed by three non-signalled foot shocks (1 mA, 2 s duration,
60 s intervals) delivered through the grid floor. After 24 h, the subject was placed
again for 5 min in the training chamber receiving no foot shock (context test).
During training and context test the mouse behaviour was recorded. To evaluate
aversive learning and memory, the total duration of freezing (behavioural
immobility, except for respiration movements) exhibited during training and
context test was manually scored by an observer blind to the experimental group
of the specimen, through EthoVision XT software (Noldus).
PSD preparation. For sub-synaptic fractionation of PSD, hippocampi were
homogenized with a Dounce tissue grinder in homogenization buffer containing
(in mM) 320 sucrose, 10 Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 EDTA, 1 NaHCO3, 1 PMSF, 1 sodium
orthovanadate, 5 NaF, 20 b-glycerophosphate and protease inhibitor cocktail. The
homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000g (10 min) and the supernatant was again
centrifuged at 10,000g (15 min). The pellet was homogenized in homogenization
buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 with a Dounce tissue grinder, incubated
40 min on ice and centrifuged at 32,000g (20 min). The resulting pellet containing
PSDs was processed for protein extraction. Briefly, the pellet was resuspended in
RIPA buffer containing (in mM) 50 Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 NaCl, 5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA,
1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 sodium orthovanadate,
5 b-glycerophosphate, 5 NaF and protease inhibitor cocktail, was sonicated and
incubated on ice for 20 min. The samples were centrifuged at 11,500g for 10 min
and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford
method.
Immunoblotting analysis. Proteins were applied to SDS–PAGE and electroblotted
on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting analysis was performed
using a chemiluminescence detection kit. The relative levels of immunoreactivity
were determined by densitometry using the ImageJ software. Primary antibodies:

Membranes were stripped using Re-Blot Plus Strong Solution (Millipore) for
15 min at room temperature. Full blots are shown in Supplementary Information.
Dendritic spine density analysis. To study the morphology of dendritic spines in
hippocampal pyramidal neurons, brains were removed from the skull and
impregnated with a Golgi-Cox solution. Brains were first immersed in a 5%
Cr2K2O7, 5%Cl2Hg and 5% CrK2O4 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 days, then
moved to a 30% sucrose solution for 3–5 days and finally sliced in 100 mm
coronal sections at the CA1 level ( � 2.3 to � 5.8 mm from bregma). Slices were
sequentially washed with the following solutions: distilled water (1 min), H5NO
(Sigma-Aldrich; 30 min in the dark), distilled water (1 min), Kodak Fix-film
(Sigma-Aldrich; 30 min in the dark), distilled water (1 min), sequentially in 50,
70 and 95% alcohol (1 min each), twice in 100% alcohol (5 min), in a solution of
one-third xylene, one-third chloroform and one-third 100% alcohol (15 min),
xylene (15 min). Slices were then coverslipped with Canada Balsam. The stained
slices were analysed under a � 100 oil-immersion objective (Axioskop, Zeiss).
During morphological analysis (Neurolucida v11, MicroBrightField) the specimen
identity was unknown. A hippocampal pyramidal neuron was processed for

 morphological analysis if labelling was uniform, reaction precipitates were absent,
if it did not overlap with neighbouring cells, if spines were clearly visible, dendritic
arbours were relatively parallel to the section plane and arbours in distal dendritic
branches were intact and visible. With these criteria, 30 CA1 pyramidal neurons
were selected per group (WT sham, Tg2576 sham, WT sel and Tg2576 sel). The
basal and apical dendritic arbours of each cell were examined separately using the
software’s Sholl Analysis tool. Terminal spine density was calculated as number of
spines (defined as protrusions of the dendritic membrane regardless of shape)
along a 25 mm dendritic terminal segment.
Morris water maze. Mice were placed in a circular white pool (diameter 145 cm)
filled with 23±2 �C water made opaque by the addition of non-toxic acrylic white
colour (Giotto). The protocol consisted of an 8-trial Cue phase (1 day) and a
20-trial Place phase followed by a 1-trial Probe phase (4 days). During Cue phase,
a visible platform (5 cm diameter) emerged 0.5 cm over the water level and
surmounted by small red plastic caps (to make it more evident) was placed in the
middle of the pool. During Place phase, the escape platform (5 cm diameter)
submerged 0.5 cm under the water level was placed in the middle of the north–west
quadrant 20 cm from the side walls. The pool was positioned in a uniformly lighted
room with various external cues and surmounted by a camera that relayed signals
to a monitor and to the image analyzer (EthoVision XT, Noldus). The Cue phase
was composed of two consecutive sessions (four 60 s-trials each; inter-trial interval:
20 min; and inter-session interval: 2 h). The Place phase was composed of four daily
sessions (five 60 s-trials per day; inter-trial interval: 20 min). During the inter-trial
and inter-session intervals, mice were placed in their home cages. At the start of
each trial, mice were put into the pool at different quadrants for each subject and
then retrieved after finding the visible or hidden platform. The mice that failed to
find the platform within 60 s, were helped by the experimenter. When mice
climbed the platform, they were allowed to remain on it for 20 s. To evaluate spatial
memory, 1 h after the last trial of Place phase mice were subjected to the Probe
phase, in which the platform was removed and the mice (released from the
opposite side of the pool) were allowed to search for it for 30 s. Data analysis
were performed using the following parameters: time spent to reach the platform
during Cue and Place phases; percentage of distance swum in the target quadrant
(previously containing the platform) during Probe phase.
Statistical analysis. CPP: data were analysed by two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVAs) with the genotype (Tg2576 versus WT) and chambers (paired versus
unpaired) as independent factors. CPP data for selegiline treatment were analysed
by two-way ANOVAs for treatment (sham versus sel) and chambers (paired versus
unpaired). Chocolate consumption after selegiline was analysed with one-way
ANOVA. Post hoc comparisons were performed with STATISTICA software
(v8.0, StatSoft, Inc., 2007) using Tukey’s HSD test.
Microdialysis: data were analysed with one-way repeated measures ANOVAs
with genotype (Tg2576 versus WT) as between-subject factor and time (20 min
blocks, 3 levels) as within-subject factor. Microdialysis data in Tg2576 mice
following selegiline treatment were analysed with one-way repeated measures
ANOVAs for treatment (Tg sham versus Tg sel) and time (20 min blocks, 3 levels).
LTP: data for sub-chronic L-DOPA and selegiline treatment were analysed by
two-way ANOVAs for genotype (Tg2576 versus WT) and treatment (sham versus
drug). LTP data for the effect of bath administration of L-DOPA and DA receptor
agonists on Tg2576 mice were analysed with one-way ANOVA. In both cases post
hoc comparisons were assessed with Bonferroni’s test.
All other data were analysed with a two-tailed paired or unpaired Student’s
t-test, as described in Figure legends. Data are presented as mean±s.e.m. Except
for CPP, all statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (v5.00).
Values of Pr0.05 were considered to be statistically significant (shown in figures as
*Pr0.05, **Pr0.01 and ***Pr0.001).
Sample size. The number of samples in each group for immunohistochemical,
immunofluorescent, stereological, microdialysis, electrophysiological, biochemical,
behavioural and morphological evaluations were determined based on published
studies. The experimenter performing surgeries was known to hit the targets used
(NAc shell, striatum or hippocampus).
Randomization. All randomization was performed by an experimenter. Animals
used in all experiments were selected randomly. For CPP, animals were also
counterbalanced across groups.
Data availability. The data that support the findings of this study are available
from the corresponding author (Marcello D’Amelio; m.damelio@unicampus.it)
upon reasonable request.
