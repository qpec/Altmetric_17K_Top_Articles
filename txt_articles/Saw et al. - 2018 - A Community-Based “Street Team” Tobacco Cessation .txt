sider quitting. All Street Team members responded posi-
tively to their participation in the intervention. This Street 
Team approach for youth and young adults is promising as 
an effective approach to the promotion of tobacco cessation 
among users and engagement and empowerment in tobacco 
control efforts among non-users.

Introduction
The vast majority of tobacco users initiate use before the age 
of 26 [1]. 24.4% of high school students and 16.7% of young 
adults aged 18–24 currently smoke [2, 3]. High school-aged 
youth and young adults are interested in quitting [4, 5], yet, 
they underutilize available cessation resources compared to 
adults [6, 7].
Interventions targeting youth and young adults that utilize 
peers as trained helpers who understand social influences 
on teens may improve reach and effectiveness since many 
youth and young adults may not seek traditional avenues 
to receive cessation interventions [8, 9]. Lay health advi-
sors or influencers have been utilized for tobacco cessation 
interventions with a variety of tobacco users, such as with 
White Greek-life college students [10], young Black women 
[11], and immigrant Vietnamese American men [12]. Most 
of these interventions involve repeated, prolonged contact 
between tobacco users and their peers.
In response to the perceived need for effective tobacco 
cessation interventions targeting youth and young adults 
in their community, in 2005, the Sacramento Taking 
Abstract Most tobacco users initiate use as youth or young 
adults. To promote tobacco cessation for this group and 
encourage non-users’ engagement in tobacco control efforts, 
a community-based organization developed a “Street Team” 
brief outreach intervention that enlisted youth and young 
adults to encourage their peers to stop tobacco use through 
a brief intervention. Street Team members provided educa-
tion, a Quit Kit, and referrals to cessation resources at a total 
of 27 community events over a four-year period. Tobacco 
users (n = 279) completed assessments of tobacco use, quit 
intention, and quit self-efficacy at baseline. Self-reports of 
cessation outcomes including past week abstinence were 
assessed 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-intervention. Perceptions 
of the intervention were gathered from Street Team mem-
bers (n = 28) and intervention participants post-intervention.

pleted at least one follow-up assessment to those lost to fol-

Action against Nicotine Dependence (hereafter referred 
to as STAND), a component of a larger community-based 
organization in Sacramento, California called Breathe 
California of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails, developed a 
brief peer outreach tobacco cessation program, the “Street 
Team” intervention. The objectives of the Street Team 
intervention were twofold. First, the organization aimed 
to recruit and train “Street Team members”—high school 
and college students who delivered the cessation interven-
tion to tobacco users. The purpose of this objective was to 
equip youth and young adults with knowledge and skills to 
feel empowered to promote tobacco cessation and actively 
counter tobacco industry’s marketing efforts. Second, the 
program aimed to promote tobacco cessation among youth 
and young adults through the delivery of a brief tobacco 
cessation intervention with motivational enhancement and 
educational components. This paper describes this pro-
gram and presents findings of Street Team members and 
tobacco users who participated in the intervention during 
a four-year project period from 2005 to 2008.
Method
Overview of Program
The STAND program provided brief cessation counseling 
to youth and young adults delivered by high school and 
college students who served as Street Team members. 
Street Team members outreached to youth and young 
adults at community events, such as festivals and sports 
games, on high school and college campuses, and in other 
public places, such as plazas. To attract young tobacco 
users to participate in the intervention, Street Team mem-
bers set up booths with educational games that included 
prizes such as Frisbees, key chains, and drawstring bags. 
If the tobacco user expressed interest in tobacco cessation, 
informed consent was obtained. Street Team members then 
delivered a brief (5–10 min) intervention that included 
education about tobacco use and cessation, motivational 
enhancement techniques, provision of “quit kits,” and 
referral to cessation resources including the state quitline. 
The intervention was delivered at a total of 27 Sacramento 
community events over a four-year period. 2–10 (M = 6) 
Street Team members provided the intervention to 0–25 
(M = 10.3) tobacco users at each community event. Inter-
vention participants received follow-up call assessments 
from Street Team members at one, three, and six months 
after initial face-to-face contact. Analyses of data for the 
current study were approved by the University of Califor-
nia, Davis Institutional Review Board.
Street Team Member Recruitment and Training
The organization recruited local youth (ages 15–17) and 
young adults (ages 18–24) to form a Street Team trained 
on peer cessation and tobacco prevention. Youth and young 
adults were recruited from local high schools and colleges. 
The organization collaborated with schools to provide course 
credit or community service hours in exchange for partici-
pation. Individuals interested in joining the Street Team 
completed an application and interview before they joined 
the program and signed voluntary contracts committing to 
participate for at least one academic quarter. Street Team 
members received training by STAND staff on the history of 
the tobacco industry’s marketing to young people, tobacco 
use and dependence, motivational enhancement techniques 
based on the work of Miller and Rollnick [13], and issues 
pertinent to youth and young adult smoking, such as social 
smoking. Training lasted 1.5 days and included lectures, 
discussions, and roleplays. Street Team members received 
small incentives ($5–$40 value) that increased based on 
level of participation in trainings, meetings, and outreach 
events. Incentives included concert tickets and gift cards.
Cessation Intervention
The cessation intervention delivered by Street Team mem-
bers included motivational enhancement techniques, educa-
tion about tobacco use and cessation, provision of a Quit Kit, 
and referral to cessation resources including the California 
Smokers’ Helpline. Oral consent was obtained from tobacco 
users prior to delivery of the intervention. The intervention 
lasted 5–10 min, during which Street Team members would 
engage with tobacco users one-on-one using motivational 
enhancement techniques. Afterwards, the intervention par-
ticipant was asked to complete a contact form and baseline 
surveys. Each intervention participant was given a quit kit 
($8 value) consisting of a water bottle, an intervention book-
let on tobacco cessation developed by STAND that explained 
how to quit using the tools in the kit, a list of local cessation 
programs, a card with the state quitline’s phone numbers, 
a pen, a cost of smoking calculator, a stress stick, rubber 
bands, honey sticks, cinnamon flavored toothpicks, gum, 
mints, candy, and sunflower seeds.
Evaluation of Street Team member Opinions
Street Team members completed online surveys consisting 
of Likert-type, multiple choice, and open-ended questions 
twice per year in the first year of the project and annually 
thereafter. Members were asked about their length of time 
with the project and their weekly time commitment. They 
were also asked what their highlights for the year, what 
they enjoyed doing the least, what they enjoyed doing the 
 J Community Health

most, their opinions of the events in which STAND partici-
pated, what the most beneficial resource was, and what other 
resources with which they could have provided. Members 
were also asked for their opinions on STAND as a whole, 
the trainings, the incentive program, and communication 
processes. Finally, they were asked if they felt their experi-
ences would help them personally or professionally, how 
the Street Team could help with building leadership skills, 
and their opinions on the effect Street Team has had on their 
personal growth.
Evaluation of Intervention Participants
Intervention participants completed a demographic form and 
baseline survey consisting of Likert-type, multiple choice, 
and open-ended questions about their tobacco use (type, 
brands, frequency, length of use), self-efficacy for quit-
ting, and past quit experiences. Follow-up surveys included 
questions about current use status, days since last use (if 
currently abstained), tobacco use (type, brands, frequency, 
length of use), stage of readiness to quit, and perceived 
effectiveness of the intervention components (i.e., quit kit, 
conversation with Street Team member). Street team mem-
bers and/or paid program staff attempted three telephone 
follow-up assessments with intervention participants who 
provided contact information. The first follow-up call was 
conducted 4–8 weeks after face-to-face contact; the second 
call was conducted 12–16 weeks after face-to-face contact. 
The third and final call was conducted 6–7 months after 
face-to-face contact. Intervention participants received a $15 
gift card for each follow-up completed.
Analysis
Descriptive statistics were reported for demographics, 
perceptions of the program, and intervention tobacco use 
variables. 7-day point prevalence was the primary tobacco 
use outcome of interest; this was measured calculating 
self-reported 7-day abstinence among respondents at each 
follow-up and also by using conservative imputation where 
non-respondents at time point were assumed to still be 
smoking (i.e., missing = smoking) [14]. T-tests and χ2-tests 
were used to compare those who completed at least one fol-
low-up assessment to those lost to follow-up. Time effects 
were analyzed using fixed effect models.
Results
Description of Street Team Members and Intervention 
Participants
In total, 28 Street Team members participated in the program 
during the 4 years of the program. In 2005–2006, 8 youth 
or young adults participated, ranging in age from 15 to 22 
with a median age of 16 (7 female, 1 male). Demographic 
data were not collected in 2006–2007. In 2007–2008, 14 
youth or young adults participated, ranging in age from 16 
to 24 (median age = 17). Of these 14 members, 4 were male, 
8 were female, and 2 did not report their gender. Table 1 
describes characteristics of the intervention participants 
(N = 279). Both samples comprised youth and young adults 
from the Sacramento, California area. Racial/ethnic identifi-
cation of Street Team members and intervention participants 
were not collected.
Of the intervention participants, 50.2% were female and 
77.6% were under age 25, with the majority (65.6%) between 
the ages of 18–25. 93.5% of participants reported smoking 
cigarettes; other tobacco products used included smokeless 
tobacco and hookah. Average length of time using tobacco 
products was nearly 7 years (range of 2 months–4 years). 
Mean self-efficacy to quit pre-intervention was 4.05 
(SD = 0.90, range = 1–5), indicating they “somewhat” 
believed they could quit. 82.4% of participants reported at 
least one past quit attempt.
Recruitment and Retention
8–15 Street Team members participated in the program each 
academic year. 88.9% of members participated at least two 
consecutive academic quarters.
279 tobacco users participated in the intervention. Fig-
ure 1 shows the retention of intervention participants for fol-
low-up assessments post-intervention. 42.3% of participants 
who consented to follow-up participated in the 1-month 
follow-up assessment. 40.8% participated in the 3-month 
follow-up assessment. 27.2% participated in the 6-month 
follow-up assessment. Those who responded to at least one 
follow-up assessment were significantly younger (21.72 vs. 
23.84 years, t(271) = 2.645, p = .009) and more likely to be 
female (χ2 (1, N = 279) = 6.04, p = .014), but did not differ 
on self-efficacy to quit, having made a previous quit attempt, 
or length of tobacco use.
Intervention Participant Outcomes
Table 2 displays intervention participants’ tobacco use out-
comes at each of three follow-ups. Missing = smoking 7-day 
point prevalence was 16.1, 18.6, and 12.5% at one-, three-, 
and six-month follow-ups respectively. Among respondents

who self-reported abstinence at any follow-up, the methods 
cited for assisting in cessation were: the Quit Kit (69.5%); 
friend/family support (46.3%); nicotine replacement therapy 
(29.3%); quit smoking programs, support groups, and the 
quitline (each 4.9%). Among those still using tobacco, the 
majority reported reduction in use since the intervention at 
each follow-up, 86.2, 92.2, and 75% respectively. Current 
users’ mean self-efficacy to quit (i.e., “Do you believe you 
can quit smoking?” was 4 (“somewhat”) on a 5-point scale 
ranging from “not at all” to “very much” at each follow-up. 
Fixed effect model analyses indicated no significant effects 
of time on self-efficacy to quit, (F(2, 54) = 0.59,  
R2 = 0.8376) 
or stage of readiness to quit (F(2, 54) = 0.40,  
R2 = 0.7173).
Intervention Participants’ Perspectives on Intervention
On a 5-point scale from 1 = not useful to 5 = useful, inter-
vention participants (n = 52) rated the discussion part of 
the intervention 4.08 (SD = 0.99) at 1-month follow-up, 
indicating the intervention was somewhat helpful. Helpful-
ness of the quit kit was assessed among respondents who 
self-reported abstinence at follow-up. 96.6, 96.6, and 93.3% 
reported that the quit kit was helpful to assist in cessation 
at the three follow-ups. Items in the quit kits reported by 
abstainers as most helpful to quitting were gum (12.6%), 
trail mix (11.2%), toothpicks (11.0%), honey sticks (10.7%), 
and stress balls/sticks (10.2%). The least reported items were 
the quitline contact card (1.2%), coffee stir sticks (2.6%), 
pens (2.8%), rubber bands (3.1%), and brochures with tips 
on quitting smoking (3.6%). Those who reported no current 
tobacco use were asked what part of the discussion with 
Street Team members was most helpful. The most frequently 
cited ways in which the discussion was helpful were: provid-
ing strategies for quitting (22.2%), information about the 
financial costs of smoking (15.6%), and information about 
smoking and its health harms (13.3%). Among participants 
who reported current but reduced use at the first follow-up, 
the most frequently reported ways in which the quit kit was 
useful were by providing: oral fixation alternatives (e.g., 
gum, honey sticks) (91.1%), information about smoking 
and cessation (30.4%), and more generally, motivation to 
consider quitting (10.7%).
Street Team Members’ Perspectives on the Program
Perspectives on the program were gathered for Street Team 
members who participated in year 3 of the program (n = 11). 
All 11 Street Team members reported receiving adequate

training to provide the intervention and felt their participa-
tion in the Street Team was an interesting and valuable expe-
rience. All but one agreed that they would recommend the 
Street Team to their friends as a good volunteer experience. 
In open-ended responses Street Team members reported 
feeling that they were an important part of a team, increas-
ing knowledge about tobacco control and cessation, directly 
impacting others in the community, and gaining applicable 
leadership skills. For example, one Street Team member 
wrote:
As a college student, I’ve experimented with a couple of 
other internship/volunteer programs and STAND has been 
the longest one that I’ve stayed with as well as recommended 
to others that I know will be beneficial to the team. This may 
not be for everyone to participate in but volunteering overall 
in a program like STAND is an invaluable experience. What 
I’ve learned and continue to learn goes a long way, including 
outside of tobacco cessation.
Another Street Team member commented, “the fact 
that I can campaign against the nicotine corp[oration], get 
to know fun new people, and help people to live healthier 
longer lives makes me proud to be a member of the STAND 
Street Team.” In open-ended responses describing what they 
enjoyed least, 35% of respondents left the question blank or 
answered “nothing.” The chief complaints about their expe-
riences were: interacting with smokers who did not want 
to quit or made them feel uncomfortable (15%), having to 
complete paperwork on participants (7.5%), having to con-
duct follow-up phone assessments (5%), and scheduling dif-
ficulties (5%). Paid staff members also reported difficulties 
coordinating Street Team members’ schedules to be able to 
participate in community events.
Discussion
The current study evaluates a community-based interven-
tion to promote tobacco cessation targeting youth and 
young adults. The program utilized a Street Team approach 
whereby youth and young adults were trained to engage 
tobacco users at community events and provide information 
about health and financial harms of smoking, brief motiva-
tional interviewing, strategies for cessation, and quit kits. 
Conservative missing = smoking analyses indicate modest 
effectiveness in encouraging tobacco cessation through this 
program. The majority of intervention participants who did 
not quit reported reductions in tobacco use. Results suggest 
the intervention was acceptable to tobacco users and provide

insights on intervention components that are most useful 
to individuals attempting to quit tobacco use. Furthermore, 
data from Street Team members who delivered the inter-
vention suggest that the program created opportunities for 
nonsmoking youth and young adults to feel empowered in 
tobacco prevention and cessation efforts.
The missing = smoking 7-day quit rates at 3- and 6-month 
follow-up of 18.6% and 12.5% were on par with other light- 
or moderately-intensive brief cessation interventions target-
ing young adults [15, 16]. Among college student smokers, 
Abroms et al. observed a 7-day quit rate of 25% that was 
10.2% after biochemical verification at 6-month follow-up 
in an intervention that included a 15-minute in-person coun-
seling session, provision of a quit kit, and follow-up coun-
seling emails. Counselors in this study were trained under-
graduates or masters of public health students. In a study of 
rural, low SES young adult tobacco users, Zanis et al. found 
that a brief 5-minute advice and motivational interviewing 
session with a health educator yielded a self-reported 30-day 
quit rate of 19.6% at 3-month follow-up. Further research 
using randomized controlled trials is needed to examine the 
effectiveness of this Street Team approach.
Study results point to intervention components that were 
most helpful in encouraging cessation. Open-ended text 
responses on participant follow-up surveys indicate that 
the interaction with the Street Team member was helpful 
for providing strategies for cessation and information about 
the health and financial consequences of smoking. Among 
participants who reported quitting, 70% reported that the 
Quit Kit aided in their cessation efforts. In particular, par-
ticipants reported utilizing alternatives to tobacco that they 
could place in their mouths, such as gum, snacks, and tooth-
picks, or could keep their hands occupied, such as stress 
balls. Of note, although the quit kit included information on 
the state quitline, only one intervention participant reported 
having used the quitline. In considering what aspects of the 
intervention could be changed, direct referral to the quitline 
during face-to-face interactions with tobacco users and in 
Quit Kit materials could increase engagement with services. 
Direct referral in the clinic setting has been associated with 
a 13-time increased likelihood of a tobacco user connecting 
with a quitline [17, 18].
Acceptability of the intervention was also assessed from 
the perspectives of Street Team members. Although the 
majority of the feedback was positive, some Street Team 
members reported uncomfortable interactions with par-
ticipants as their least favorite aspect of their service. Staff 
and volunteer Street Team members voiced concerns about 
scheduling difficulties since all Street Team members were 
full-time high school or college students. Furthermore, a

few Street Team members reported not enjoying completing 
paperwork and/or conducting follow-up calls with interven-
tion participants. These logistic difficulties should not be 
overlooked in future interventions using peer Street Team 
members and more training of Street Team members to han-
dle difficult interactions and education on the importance 
of data collection and follow-up with quitline services may 
help allay some of these challenges. Overall, Street Team 
members viewed their experiences very positively, and many 
returned for multiple quarters of service.
Recruiting youth and young adults with volunteer or 
school credits was a key feature that enhances potential 
scalability of this program. In the future, federal work-study 
programs for students might be investigated as a mechanism 
for reimbursement of Street Team time, instead of the Street 
Team’s incentive-based structure. This would enable future 
Street Team members to represent diverse socioeconomic 
backgrounds, some of whom may come from communi-
ties with higher smoking prevalence rates [19]. Now with 
a National Tobacco-Free Campus Initiative at over 1500 
smoke-free colleges to date, this model could potentially 
recruit students from these colleges to engage in community-
based outreach where they live [20].
There are important limitations of the current study to 
consider. First, this evaluation is based on a single group 
design that was meant for real-world implementation. To 
better understand overall effectiveness and specific com-
ponents that are most effective, the intervention should be 
tested in dismantling and randomized controlled trial study 
designs. Fidelity of the intervention was not measured, so 
it is unclear how closely Street Team members adhered to 
established motivational enhancement techniques. Tobacco 
use outcomes were measured using self-report and assessed 
with 7-day point prevalence. Biochemical verification is 
a more accurate assessment of tobacco use as self-report 
tends to underestimate use [21]. Long term abstinence can-
not be ascertained from the current study. Many interven-
tion participants were lost to follow-up. Missing data were 
addressed in analyses by assuming nonrespondents were 
still smoking. Although this method is widely used (e.g., 
[22–24]), this likely is not an accurate estimate of the impact 
of the intervention on smoking cessation [14]. Moreover, 
the large proportion of those lost to follow-up suggest that 
future iterations of this type of approach must consider how 
best to maintain ongoing contact with intervention partic-
ipants, such as with text messaging or social media, and 
perhaps provide greater incentives for completing follow-up 
assessments. Electronic cigarettes, which were not widely 
available at the time of the Street Team activities, were not 
included in this study. The results of the current study cannot 
be generalized to those of participants in other communities.
 Despite these limitations, the current study provides an 
overview and evaluation of a tobacco cessation intervention 
developed by a community organization that targeted, 
through its intervention design and outreach, non-treatment 
seeking youth and young adults. This type of intervention 
based in the community (rather than at schools or health 
clinics) and administered by peers (rather than professionals) 
should be considered in future cessation efforts with youth 
and young adult tobacco users given the potential to reach 
a considered population that, though interested in quitting, 
may be unwilling or unable to seek traditional avenues of 
cessation.
