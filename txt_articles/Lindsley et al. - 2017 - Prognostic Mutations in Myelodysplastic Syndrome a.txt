Abstract
BACKGROUND—Genetic mutations drive the pathogenesis of the myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) and are closely associated with clinical phenotype. Therefore, genetic mutations may 
predict clinical outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.
METHODS—We performed targeted mutational analysis on samples obtained before 
transplantation from 1514 patients with MDS who were enrolled in the Center for International 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Repository between 2005 and 2014. We evaluated the 
association of mutations with transplantation outcomes, including overall survival, relapse, and 
death without relapse.
RESULTS—TP53 mutations were present in 19% of the patients and were associated with shorter 
survival and a shorter time to relapse than was the absence of TP53 mutations, after adjustment for 
significant clinical variables (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients 40 years of age or 
older who did not have TP53 mutations, the presence of RAS pathway mutations was associated 
with shorter survival than was the absence of RAS pathway mutations (P= 0.004), owing to a high 
risk of relapse, and the presence of JAK2 mutations was associated with shorter survival than was 
the absence of JAK2 mutations (P = 0.001), owing to a high risk of death without relapse. The 
adverse prognostic effect of TP53 mutations was similar in patients who received reduced-
intensity conditioning regimens and those who received myeloablative conditioning regimens. By 
contrast, the adverse effect of RAS pathway mutations on the risk of relapse, as compared with the 
absence of RAS pathway mutations, was evident only with reduced-intensity conditioning 
(P<0.001). In young adults, 4% of the patients had compound heterozygous mutations in the 
Shwachman–Diamond syndrome–associated SBDS gene with concurrent TP53 mutations and a 
poor prognosis. Mutations in the p53 regulator PPM1D were more common among patients with 
therapy-related MDS than those with primary MDS (15% vs. 3%, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS—Genetic profiling revealed that molecular subgroups of patients undergoing 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for MDS may inform prognostic stratification

 and the selection of conditioning regimen. (Funded by the Edward P. Evans Foundation and 
others.)
The myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is clinically and biologically heterogeneous. In 
children and young adults, MDS can arise in the context of congenital mutations that cause 
bone marrow failure syndromes or inherited predisposition to myeloid cancers.1 Therapy-
related MDS develops as a late complication in patients with previous exposure to 
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both.2 In most patients, however, primary MDS arises in 
the absence of an identified exposure, prodromal bone marrow failure syndrome, or inherited 
predisposition.
Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the only curative therapy for 
MDS, mortality after transplantation is high, with deaths attributable to relapsed disease and 
to transplant-related complications. Predicting which patients are most likely to benefit from 
transplantation is thus a central challenge. Improvements in the identification of patients 
who are most likely to have a relapse and those who are most at risk for death without 
relapse could lead to the refinement of conditioning regimens and relapse-prevention 
strategies. The genetic lesions that drive the pathogenesis of MDS predict overall survival 
and many aspects of clinical phenotype and may contribute to the outcome of patients after 
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.3–5
Current prognostic models regarding transplantation in patients with MDS incorporate a 
number of factors that are related to the characteristics of the patient, the disease, and the 
transplant itself but not to molecular genetic characteristics.6–8 Recently, somatic mutations 
have been linked to survival outcomes after transplantation, but previous studies have not 
comprehensively evaluated the effect of clinical and transplantation variables.3,9 Here we 
report a comprehensive analysis of genes related to MDS and bone marrow failure in a 
broadly representative cohort of patients of all ages with rigorously defined MDS who 
underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.
METHODS
PATIENTS
All the patients with MDS who were enrolled in the Center for International Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) repository and research database and for whom 
comprehensive report form–level data had been collected between 2005 and 2014 were 
considered for inclusion in this study. Patients were not included if the percentage of blasts 
in the bone marrow or blood was 20% or more or if they had received a diagnosis of chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia or overlap myelodysplastic–myeloproliferative neoplasms. A 
total of 1520 of 2990 eligible patients had banked samples available for analysis, and 1514 
samples met the technical requirements for analysis. Patients were included from 130 of the 
177 transplantation centers that perform allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation 
for MDS in participating countries (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org). All the samples were frozen whole blood, which 
had been archived immediately before the administration of the preparative conditioning 
regimen.

 The clinical characteristics of the cohort are listed in Tables S2, S3, and S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. All the patients provided written informed consent to participate 
in the CIBMTR research database and repository. The study was conducted with the 
approval of the institutional review board at the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute.
GENETIC STUDIES
Genetic profiling included the targeted sequencing of 129 genes, which had been selected on 
the basis of their known or suspected involvement in the pathogenesis of myeloid cancers or 
inherited or acquired bone marrow failure syndromes. Annotation of the mutations was 
blinded with regard to clinical characteristics, and the genetic analysis was locked before 
being merged with clinical data. Detailed sequencing information is provided in the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Overall survival was defined as the time from transplantation until death from any cause or 
until censoring at the time that the patient was last known to be alive. The analysis was 
performed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model. P values for likelihood-ratio 
tests were reported for covariates in univariate models, and P values for Wald tests were 
reported for covariates in multivariable models. Death without relapse was defined as any 
death while the patient was in clinical remission, with relapse as a competing risk, and was 
assessed with the use of Gray’s test. For relapse, death without relapse was considered to be 
a competing risk. Multivariable modeling for both relapse and death without relapse was 
performed with the use of the Fine–Gray model. Recursive partitioning was used to generate 
a hierarchical model that integrated nonmodifiable clinical and genetic characteristics. 
Adjusted P values were calculated with the use of the Benjamini–Hochberg correction. 
Additional details are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.
RESULTS
GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS AND SPECTRUM OF MUTATIONS
We identified at least 1 mutation in 1196 of 1514 patients (79%) who had undergone 
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, with a median of 2 driver mutations per patient 
(range, 0 to 15). Mutations that are associated with higher-risk MDS according to the 
International Prognostic Scoring System, including TP53 and DNMT3A, were more 
prevalent in our cohort than in published cohorts of patients with MDS who had not 
undergone transplantation, whereas mutations that are associated with lower-risk MDS, such 
as SF3B1, were less prevalent — findings that were consistent with the clinical practice to 
prioritize higher-risk cases for transplantation (Fig. 1A).4,5 Complete details are provided in 
Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.
CLINICAL AND GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF OUTCOMES
To identify the mutations associated with overall survival, we evaluated the 32 genes that 
were mutated in at least 20 patients in the study cohort. Genes that were mutated less 
frequently were subject to descriptive analysis. Certain mutations were significantly 
associated, as compared with the absence of the mutation, with shorter overall survival,

 including TP53 (hazard ratio for death, 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69 to 2.28; 
adjusted P<0.001) (Fig. 1B), PPM1D (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.12; adjusted P = 
0.002), and JAK2 (hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.58; adjusted P = 0.03). No 
mutations were associated with prolonged survival.
Nongenetic factors that were related to the patient, disease, or the transplant itself have 
previously been shown to influence transplantation outcomes, including overall survival, 
relapse, and death without relapse. As expected, the variables that were significantly 
associated with shorter survival in univariate analyses included patient-related factors such 
as a recipient age of 40 years or more (hazard ratio vs. an age of <40 years, 2.05; 95% CI, 
1.66 to 2.53; P<0.001) and a Karnofsky performance-status score less than 90 (on a scale 
from 0 to 100, on which 100 indicates fully active and asymptomatic, and lower numbers 
indicate greater disability; hazard ratio vs. a score of ≥90, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.77; 
P<0.001); transplant-related factors such as HLA mismatch (hazard ratio vs. HLA match, 
1.25; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.47; P = 0.006); and disease-related components of standard 
prognostic risk models for MDS, such as an elevated percentage of bone marrow blasts 
(>5%), severe thrombocytopenia (<50×109 platelets per liter), and complex or monosomal 
karyotype. MDS that was linked to predisposing conditions, such as inherited bone marrow 
failure syndromes, aplastic anemia, or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, was associated 
with longer survival (hazard ratio vs. the absence of such conditions, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57 to 
0.96; P=0.02) (Table 1). Complete lists of univariate clinical and genetic associations with 
overall survival are provided in Tables S9 through S12 in the Supplementary Appendix.
In multivariable analyses, only mutations in TP53 were independently associated with 
shorter survival (hazard ratio for death vs. no TP53 mutation, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.45 to 2.02; 
P<0.001) (Fig. 1C). TP53 mutations were also associated with a shorter time to relapse 
(hazard ratio vs. no TP53 mutation, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.60 to 2.58; P<0.001), as were RAS 
pathway mutations (NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, CBL, NF1, RIT1, FLT3, and KIT) (hazard 
ratio vs. no RAS pathway mutation, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.05; P=0.002). JAK2 V617F 
mutations were associated with a higher rate of death without relapse (hazard ratio vs. no 
JAK2 V617F mutation, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.24; P<0.001) but not a higher rate of relapse 
(hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.33; P = 0.26). The results of the multivariable Cox 
model for overall survival and the Fine–Gray model for the rates of relapse and death 
without relapse, along with adjusted covariates for each model, are provided in Tables S13, 
S14, and S15 in the Supplementary Appendix.
GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS OF TP53 MUTATIONS
Since the presence of TP53 mutations was the most powerful predictor of survival, we 
analyzed whether the consequences of such mutations depended on the particular mutation 
type, genetic context, or abundance within the tumor. Among 423 TP53 mutations found in 
289 patients, the median variant allele fraction (i.e., the fraction of alleles in the sample that 
were mutated) was 10% (range, 2 to 86). However, a TP53 variant allele fraction of 10% or 
higher was not significantly associated with survival (hazard ratio for death vs. a variant 
allele fraction of <10%, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.66; P = 0.07). Similarly, the presence of

 multiple TP53 mutations was not significantly associated with survival (hazard ratio vs. 
single TP53 mutations, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.61; P = 0.18).
The majority of TP53 mutations were missense substitutions affecting the DNA binding 
domain that can confer a precise alteration in TP53 function.10 However, among patients 
with TP53 mutations, 45 patients with only truncating TP53 mutations (16%) had shorter 
survival than patients who had missense mutations (hazard ratio for death, 1.61; 95% CI, 
1.20 to 2.67; P = 0.005), which indicated a distinct biologic activity of loss-of-function TP53 
mutations. Complete genetic details regarding the TP53 mutations are provided in Figures 
S4, S5, and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.
PPM1D AND TP53 MUTATIONS AND A DISTINCT PATHWAY OF THERAPY-RELATED MDS
Patients with therapy-related MDS represented 21% of the study cohort (311 patients) and 
had significantly shorter survival than patients with primary MDS (hazard ratio for death, 
1.34; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.57; P<0.001). We found that TP53 was mutated significantly more 
frequently among patients with therapy-related MDS than among those with primary MDS 
(38% vs. 14%, adjusted P<0.001); similar results were observed for the TP53 regulator 
PPM1D (15% vs. 3%, adjusted P<0.001) (Fig. 2A, and Table S16 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Mutations in PPM1D or TP53 were present in 46% of the patients with therapy-related MDS 
and were mutated concurrently more frequently than would be expected by chance (adjusted 
P<0.001) (Fig. S17 in the Supplementary Appendix). As compared with patients with 
neither PPM1D nor TP53 mutations (14% of whom had therapy-related MDS), patients with 
PPM1D mutations alone (51%) had a similarly elevated frequency of therapy-related MDS 
as those with TP53 mutations alone (39%) or those with concurrent PPM1D and TP53 
mutations (54%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Fig. 2B). The presence of TP53 mutations 
has been strongly associated with complex chromosomal abnormalities.11 Although PPM1D 
is a phosphatase that regulates TP53 activity, patients who had PPM1D mutations without 
concurrent TP53 mutations had a similar frequency of complex karyotype as patients with 
neither mutation (3% and 2%, respectively) (Fig. 2C).
Among patients with therapy-related MDS, the presence of TP53 mutations was associated 
with shorter overall survival (hazard ratio for death with vs. without TP53 mutations, 1.63; 
95% CI, 1.22 to 2.20; P<0.001). Among patients without TP53 mutations, survival was 
similar among patients with therapy-related MDS and those with primary MDS (hazard 
ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.35; P = 0.37). Despite being highly associated with therapy-
related MDS, PPM1D mutations were not associated with an adverse prognosis in patients 
who had therapy-related MDS without TP53 mutations (hazard ratio for death with vs. 
without PPM1D mutations, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.71 to 2.24; P= 0.39).
GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF OUTCOME IN CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS
Patients younger than 40 years of age made up 16% of the cohort (241 of 1514 patients), 
which enabled us to identify age-related pathways of MDS pathogenesis and to evaluate 
their clinical effect. We first determined whether particular mutations were more common in 
children and young adults (<40 years of age) or in older adults (≥40 years of age). Mutations

 in five genes, TET2, DNMT3A, SRSF2, SF3B1, and PPM1D, were significantly more 
common in older adults than in children and young adults (Fig. 3A, and Table S17 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Three mutations were significantly more common in younger 
patients than in older ones: GATA2 (11% vs. 2%, adjusted P<0.001), PIGA (5% vs. <1%, 
adjusted P<0.001), and compound heterozygous mutations in the Shwachman–Diamond 
syndrome–associated SBDS gene (2% vs. <1%, adjusted P<0.001). PIGA mutations are 
found in patients with MDS as well as in those with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria 
and aplastic anemia.5,12 GATA2 and SBDS mutations are associated with germline bone 
marrow failure syndromes that predispose patients to the development of myeloid 
cancers.13,14
Patients younger than 40 years of age who had compound heterozygous SBDS mutations 
had remarkably shorter survival than did those without such variants (median survival, 1.2 
years vs. not reached; P=0.009). However, patients with GATA2 or PIGA mutations had a 
favorable prognosis that was typical of younger patients in the study cohort (Fig. 3B).
The Shwachman–Diamond syndrome is a rare congenital bone marrow failure syndrome 
that is caused by compound heterozygous germline SBDS mutations. Persons with single 
germline SBDS mutations are asymptomatic carriers. Although only two of the seven 
patients with biallelic SBDS mutations in our cohort had clinically diagnosed Shwachman–
Diamond syndrome, several characteristics suggest that the biallelic SBDS mutations that 
were identified in our study were germline: SBDS variant allele fractions were consistent 
with germline heterozygous mutations (median variant allele fraction, 42%; 95% CI, 37 to 
47), and all the mutations that we identified have been found previously in patients with 
clinically confirmed Shwachman–Diamond syndrome.15,16 Patients with biallelic SBDS 
mutations were significantly and uniformly younger (median age, 25.1 years; 95% CI, 18.2 
to 38.2) than those with a single mutated SBDS allele (median age, 59.0 years; 95% CI, 48.6 
to 64.4) or with wild-type SBDS (median age, 59.3 years; 95% CI, 58.7 to 60.3). Patients 
with biallelic SBDS mutations were in a significantly lower height percentile than those with 
a single mutated SBDS allele (P = 0.02) (Fig. S16 in the Supplementary Appendix).
All the patients with biallelic SBDS mutations had somatic TP53 mutations (median variant 
allele fraction, 16%; 95% CI, 8 to 20), a finding that was consistent with their poor survival. 
TP53 mutations were significantly more frequent among patients with biallelic SBDS 
mutations than among those with one SBDS mutation (P = 0.01) or no SBDS mutation 
(P<0.001) (Fig. S16 in the Supplementary Appendix). Taken together, these data suggest 
that the genetically defined Shwachman–Diamond syndrome may be underdiagnosed and 
that somatic acquisition of TP53 mutations mediates the progression to MDS.
INTEGRATION OF CLINICAL AND GENETIC VARIABLES
As an alternate method of analysis, we used recursive partitioning to identify six distinct 
subgroups of patients with MDS on the basis of the association of clinical and genetic 
variables with overall survival (Fig. 4). Consistent with our multivariable model, the 
presence of TP53 mutations was the most important prognostic variable, since it identified a 
subgroup of patients with diverse clinical characteristics that were unified by poor survival

 and a high risk of relapse. No further stratification of the patients with TP53 mutations was 
identified by the algorithm.
Among the 1011 patients 40 years of age or older who had MDS without TP53 mutation, we 
identified two subgroups with poor survival. Patients with a RAS pathway mutation had 
shorter survival than those without RAS pathway mutation (median, 0.9 vs. 2.2 years; P = 
0.004), and the shorter survival was associated with a higher risk of relapse (P = 0.001). By 
contrast, patients with JAK2 mutations had shorter survival than those without JAK2 
mutations (median, 0.5 vs. 2.3 years; P = 0.001), but they had a strikingly high risk of death 
without relapse (P<0.001). The majority of patients 40 years of age or older without TP53 
mutations had neither JAK2 nor RAS pathway mutations, and this subgroup had a median 
survival of 2.3 years.
Among 214 patients younger than 40 years of age without TP53 mutations, we identified 
two subgroups on the basis of evaluation of high-risk clinical features. Young patients with 
at least one high-risk feature (therapy-related MDS, platelet count of <30×109 per liter at the 
time of transplantation, or a percentage of bone marrow blasts of ≥15% at diagnosis) had a 
median overall survival of 2.6 years, which was associated with a high risk of death without 
relapse, as compared with patients with no high-risk features (P<0.001). Among patients 
with no high-risk features, the median survival was not reached, and the survival rate at 3 
years was 82%.
EFFECT OF CONDITIONING INTENSITY ON OUTCOMES
The intensity of the conditioning regimen before transplantation has the potential to 
influence the risks of relapse and of death without relapse. Whereas myeloablative 
conditioning is generally associated with a lower risk of relapse and higher rate of death 
without relapse, reduced-intensity conditioning is associated with a higher risk of relapse 
and a lower rate of death without relapse.17
Among patients with TP53 mutations, the median survival was similar with myeloablative 
conditioning and with reduced-intensity conditioning (7.5 months and 9.2 months, 
respectively; P = 0.19), and there was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence 
of relapse, which suggests that high-intensity conditioning regimens do not influence the 
relapse-driven survival disadvantage of TP53-mutated MDS (Fig. S14 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). By contrast, we observed a higher risk of relapse among patients with RAS 
pathway–mutated MDS only in the context of reduced-intensity conditioning, with a 1-year 
cumulative incidence of relapse of 42% among patients with RAS pathway mutations versus 
20% among those without RAS pathway mutations (P<0.001). This effect of RAS pathway 
mutations on relapse was not observed with myeloablative conditioning; the 1-year 
cumulative incidence of relapse was similar among patients with RAS pathway mutations 
and those without such mutations (22% and 15%, respectively; P = 0.31) (Fig. S14 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
The higher cumulative incidence of death without relapse among patients with JAK2 
mutations than among those without JAK2 mutations was similar regardless of the intensity 
of the conditioning regimen. Among patients who received a reduced-intensity conditioning

 regimen, 1-year non-relapse-related mortality was 53% among those with JAK2 mutations 
versus 25% among those without JAK2 mutations (P = 0.007). Among patients who received 
a myeloablative conditioning regimen, 1-year nonrelapse-related mortality was 50% among 
those with JAK2 mutations versus 28% among those without JAK2 mutations (P=0.003) 
(Fig. S14 and Tables S19 and S20 in the Supplementary Appendix). Overall, these findings 
indicate that high-intensity conditioning regimens may benefit patients with RAS pathway 
mutations but not those with TP53 or JAK2 mutations.
DISCUSSION
Assessment of gene mutations may help predict survival among patients with MDS 
undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation,3,9 but previous studies have not evaluated a 
large number of genetic risks or the extent to which genetic risk interacts with clinical 
variables. In this study, we paired genetic analysis with comprehensive clinical annotation in 
a large, registry-based cohort. We found that TP53 mutations were the most powerful 
predictor of survival after transplantation among patients with MDS, independent of clinical 
factors such as age, Karnofsky performance-status score, and hematologic variables. The 
effect of TP53 mutations on the risks of relapse and death was not attenuated by 
myeloablative conditioning regimens, a finding that is consistent with clinical and 
experimental evidence showing TP53 mutation–mediated chemoresistance.11,18,19 Our data 
suggest that the escalation of the intensity of the conditioning regimen in order to improve 
outcomes in patients with TP53 mutated MDS will not be successful.
Mutations that drive activated RAS–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling are 
late events in myeloid leukemogenesis that are linked to the leukemic transformation of 
MDS and to an adverse prognosis in patients who have not undergone transplantation.20–22 
We found that among patients with MDS who were 40 years of age or older, those with 
detectable RAS pathway mutations at the time of transplantation had a significantly elevated 
risk of early relapse that may be overcome by myeloablative conditioning. RAS pathway 
mutations may thus reflect the presence of low-volume but biologically transformed disease 
that, without adequate cytoreduction before transplantation, outpaces the development of 
effective graft-versus-leukemia activity. By contrast, JAK2 mutations were associated with a 
higher rate of death without relapse but not a higher risk of relapse, regardless of 
conditioning intensity. The mechanism of these effects of JAK2 mutations is unknown. In 
this context, early death without relapse may be driven by potentiated Janus kinase (JAK)–
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling in persistent JAK2 mutated 
cells and therefore may be susceptible to targeting by pharmacologic JAK2 inhibition.
We observed highly recurrent PPM1D mutations in patients with MDS and found that such 
mutations, along with TP53 mutations, were strongly associated with previous exposure to 
leukemogenic therapies. PPM1D encodes a serine–threonine protein phosphatase that 
regulates the cellular response to environmental stress, in part by means of inhibition of 
TP53 activity,23,24 which suggests that TP53 and PPM1D mutations represent convergent 
mechanisms of clonal survival in the context of leukemogenic exposures. Our results are 
consistent with the association between PPM1D mutations and asymptomatic clonal

 hematopoiesis after chemotherapy22–27 and provide strong genetic evidence of the role of 
PPM1D mutations in the pathogenesis of therapy-related MDS.
Shwachman–Diamond syndrome–associated compound heterozygous mutations in SBDS 
were unexpectedly common in young adults, representing 4% of the patients with MDS who 
were 18 to 40 years of age, and were associated with a poor prognosis. Our results are 
consistent with the varied clinical presentation of patients with the Shwachman–Diamond 
syndrome and indicate that clinical criteria alone may be inadequate to identify all diagnoses 
of the Shwachman–Diamond syndrome.19 Moreover, the close connection between putative 
germline SBDS mutations and somatic TP53 mutations indicates a biologic synergy between 
SBDS and TP53 mutations in the clonal MDS transformation of genetically defined 
Shwachman–Diamond syndrome. These results may influence donor selection and suggest 
that early transplantation in patients with the Shwachman–Diamond syndrome should be 
considered, since transplantation after MDS transformation may not offer long-term benefit.
Our data call into question the benefit of conventional myeloablative conditioning over 
reduced-intensity approaches in patients with TP53-mutated MDS. These patients, who have 
an exceptionally high risk of relapse-related death after transplantation, should be considered 
for investigative approaches to conditioning or new relapse-prevention strategies after 
transplantation. Patients with RAS pathway–mutated MDS, among whom the risk of early 
relapse is elevated only when reduced-intensity regimens are used for conditioning, may 
benefit from myeloablative conditioning when the safety profile is acceptable. By contrast, 
strategies that are focused on minimizing toxic effects would be useful in older patients with 
JAK2 mutations, who have poor survival that is driven by a significantly elevated risk of 
death without relapse. In conclusion, our findings show that analysis of mutations in patients 
with MDS at the time of transplantation can predict outcomes and identify subgroups of 
patients who will derive the most benefit from particular conditioning regimens.

 Figure 1. Frequency of Driver Mutations and Age-Independent Association of TP53 Mutations 
with Poor Overall Survival
Panel A shows the frequency of driver mutations in the study cohort; included are the 32 
genes that were evaluated in the multivariable models. A complete list of mutation 
frequencies is provided in Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix. Panel B shows Kaplan–
Meier curves for overall survival according to TP53 mutation status. Tick marks indicate 
censored data. Panel C shows Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival among patients with 
TP53 mutations (red) or without TP53 mutations (black), according to age. Dashed lines 
represent patients younger than 40 years of age, and solid lines patients 40 years of age or 
older. Among patients without TP53 mutations, younger patients had longer survival than 
older patients (hazard ratio for death, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.65; 
P<0.001). Among patients with TP53 mutations, survival was similar among younger 
patients and older patients (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.31; P = 0.50).

 Figure 2. PPM1D and TP53 Mutations Associated with Therapy-Related MDS
Panel A shows the association between gene mutations and therapy-related MDS or primary 
MDS. A volcano plot was constructed by plotting the negative log of the P value on the y 
axis; the x axis shows the magnitude of association (log2 odds ratio), and the y axis the 
−log2 P value. The gray line represents the threshold of significance determined by 
correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. Each circle represents a mutated gene, and the 
size of each circle corresponds to the frequency of the mutation among patients with 
therapy-related MDS, as indicated. Genes in the upper right quadrant were significantly 
associated with therapy-related MDS (red), and genes in the upper left quadrant with

 primary MDS. Panel B shows the proportion of patients with primary MDS or therapy-
related MDS according to TP53 and PPM1D mutation status. Panel C shows the proportion 
of patients with complex karyotype (>3 alterations) or noncomplex karyotype (≤3 
alterations) according to TP53 and PPM1D mutation status. The numbers above the bars in 
Panels B and C show the total number of patients in each group.

 Figure 3. Biallelic SBDS Mutations in Young Adult Patients and Association with Poor Survival
Panel A shows the association between mutated genes and the age of the patient. Each circle 
represents a mutated gene, and the size of each circle corresponds to the frequency of the 
mutation in the total cohort, as indicated. Genes in the upper right quadrant were 
significantly associated with an age of 40 years or more (blue), and genes in the upper left 
quadrant with an age of less than 40 years (red). Panel B shows Kaplan–Meier curves for 
overall survival among patients younger than 40 years of age according to PIGA, GATA2, or 
SBDS mutation status. Data for patients without mutations in these genes are shown in gray. 
Patients with biallelic SBDS mutations (SBDS×2, red) had shorter survival than those 
without SBDS mutation (P = 0.009). Tick marks indicate censored data.

*P values for individual categories within variables were calculated with the use of the Wald test. The P value for each variable was calculated with 
the use of the log-rank test. Percentages may not sum to 100 because of rounding. The full characteristics of the cohort, including enumeration of 
missing data for all variables, are provided in Tables S2, S3, and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. The complete analysis of univariate 
association of clinical characteristics is provided in Tables S10, S11, and S12 in the Supplementary Appendix. IPSS-R denotes Revised 
International Prognostic Scoring System, and MDS myelodysplastic syndrome.
†Karnofsky performance-status scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function.
‡Bone marrow blasts were assessed within 30 days before the initiation of the conditioning therapy that was used before transplantation.
