Abstract
Background: Weight loss in individuals at high risk of diabetes is an effective prevention method and a major
component of the currently prevailing diabetes prevention strategies. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the public health potential for diabetes prevention of weight maintenance or moderate weight loss
on a population level in an observational cohort with repeated measurements of weight and diabetes status.
Methods: Height, weight and diabetes status were objectively measured at baseline and 10 year follow-up in a
population-based cohort of 33,184 participants aged 30–60 years between 1990 and 2013 in Västerbotten County,
Sweden. The association between risk of incident diabetes and change in BMI or relative weight was modelled
using multivariate logistic regression. Population attributable fractions (PAF) were used to assess population impact
of shift in weight.
Results: Mean (SD) BMI at baseline was 25.0 (3.6) kg/m2. Increase in relative weight between baseline and follow-
up was linearly associated with incident diabetes risk, odds ratio (OR) 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–1.06)
per 1% change in weight. Compared to weight maintenance (±1.0 kg/m2), weight gain of > +1.0 kg/m2 was
associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes, OR 1.52 (95% CI 1.32, 1.74), representing a PAF of 21.9%
(95% CI 15.8, 27.6%). For moderate weight loss (−1.0 to −2.0 kg/m2) the OR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.52, 0.99).
Conclusions: Weight maintenance in adulthood is strongly associated with reduced incident diabetes risk and
there is considerable potential for diabetes prevention in promoting this as a whole population strategy.

Background
Since the positive outcome of several large scale trials
demonstrated that lifestyle interventions among individ-
uals at high risk for diabetes are effective for reducing
disease incidence [1] the high-risk strategy has been the
policy paradigm for prevention of diabetes [2, 3]. In
many of the successful trials, weight reduction was a key
component of the intervention [4, 5]. Indeed, the
association between excess weight defined as overweight
(BMI ≥25.0 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2), and
increased incident diabetes risk is well established [6].
The association between BMI and incident diabetes ap-
pears to be approximately linear [7], making BMI a suit-
able candidate target for a population shift strategy, as
proposed by Rose [8]. However, it is unknown how big
such a shift would need to be to affect a substantial im-
pact on the occurrence of diabetes in the population.
The potential public health impact of targeting a spe-
cific risk factor in the population is usually assessed by
estimating the population attributable fraction (PAF),
which is the proportion of cases that could be prevented
if the risk factor, such as excess weight or weight gain,
was eliminated. With regards to body weight and dia-
betes, most studies have focused on the potential impact
on diabetes occurrence of eliminating excess weight
(BMI ≥25.0 kg/m2) in the population. There has been

 considerable variability in the methods used to estimate
these PAFs [9] which have ranged from 3% in women in
the Framingham study [10], to 77% in a Finnish popula-
tion [11]. However, as the probability that obese adults
will attain normal weight is exceedingly low [12], a more
realistic approach may be to study the potential popula-
tion impact of achievable reductions in body weight, or
of preventing weight gain [13, 14]. There is considerable
evidence concerning the association between weight gain
at a population level and diabetes risk [15], but there is
much less evidence concerning the risk and public
health impact associated with moderate weight loss or
primary weight maintenance (i.e., prevention of weight
gain in adulthood). In addition, compared to the evi-
dence for individual high-risk approaches, there is a
dearth of evidence concerning population-based ap-
proaches for diabetes prevention. We aimed to investi-
gate the public health potential of a whole population
strategy for diabetes prevention by quantifying the im-
pact on risk and population burden of diabetes of shift-
ing the population distribution of body weight. To this
end we used data from a large cohort study with object-
ive longitudinal measures of weight and diabetes status.
Methods
Study population
The Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) was
initially
established
in
1985
as
a
community
and
individual-level programme to reduce the morbidity and
mortality
from
cardiovascular
disease
in
Northern
Sweden [16]. The programme has evolved with the de-
velopment of new national and international guidelines
and methods, but the basics have remained the same.
Participants are invited to their primary care centre dur-
ing the year of their 30th (until about 1995), 40th, 50th,
and finally 60th birthday for standardised health exami-
nations including oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT).
For individuals found to have a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 the rec-
ommendation is that the attending health care practi-
tioners provide counselling concerning lifestyle changes
aimed at risk factor reduction, and those found to have
Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) are referred for a
follow-up visit with a nurse, generally every second year
(as with those found to have Impaired Fasting Glycaemia
(IFG) after the concept was introduced in 2003) [16]. At
every VIP visit the participants are asked to complete a
comprehensive questionnaire that covers among other
things lifestyle behaviour, health, and psychosocial status.
Baseline participation rate over the study period has
ranged from 48 to 67% of eligible people [16].
The data collected in VIP was used to conduct an ob-
servational prospective cohort study. All individuals first
included in VIP between 1990 and 2003 at age 30, 40 or
50 were eligible to be included in the study population
(n = 52,889). After excluding those who had prevalent
diabetes at baseline (n = 1,280), missing baseline OGTT
(n = 433) or who did not participate in the 10-year
follow-up (n = 14,980), 36,196 participants with follow-
up remained (70.7% of baseline participants). As diabetes
patients are likely to lose weight following a diagnosis
[17], we excluded participants who self-reported diabetes
at follow-up (n = 487) to limit potential bias due to re-
verse causation. We also excluded all participants who
at follow-up had missing OGTT data (n = 29). Finally,
we excluded participants with missing, incomplete or
erroneous data on weight and/or height (n = 1073, see
details below) or missing data on any co-variate (n =
1,423), leaving a final study population of 33,184 partici-
pants with complete data available for analysis (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S1). Written informed consent was
obtained from VIP participants and ethical approval was
granted by the Regional Ethical Review Board, Umeå
University [Dnr 08–131 M].
Assessment of diabetes
The outcome was newly detected diabetes at 10 year
follow-up based on OGTT with a 75 g oral glucose
load and measurements of fasting and 2-h capillary
plasma glucose. Diabetes was defined as having fasting
glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L or 2-h glucose of ≥12.2 mmol/L
[18, 19]. For descriptive purposes we also defined IGT:
fasting glucose <7.0 mmol/L and 2-h glucose ≥8.9 - <
12.2 mmol/L, and IFG: fasting glucose ≥6.1 - <7.0 mmol/L
and 2-h glucose <8.9 mmol/L.
Assessment of anthropometric data
Height and weight were measured in light clothing at
the health examination at baseline and 10 year follow-
up, and BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms (kg)
divided by height in metres (m) squared. Except for
small diurnal variation, people aged 30–50 years do not
normally increase in height over 10 years follow-up, but
some decrease in height may be expected [20]. To avoid
unreasonable variation in BMI due to height measure-
ment error or data entry error, we excluded all partici-
pants with larger than expected variation in height
between baseline and follow-up (height gain >2 centi-
metres (cm) or height loss >2, >3 or >4 cm for those
aged 30, 40 and 50 years, respectively). In addition, we
excluded participants with BMI <10.0 kg/m2, or with an
increase or decrease in BMI of >20.0 kg/m2 between
baseline and follow-up. In total we excluded 1073 partic-
ipants due to missing or erroneous height and/or weight
data (see above).
Relative weight change was calculated as percent
change relative to baseline weight (((Weight10year -
Weightbaseline)/Weightbaseline)*100). Absolute BMI change
was calculated as (BMI10year - BMIbaseline) in Δkg/m2.
Feldman et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:170 
Page 2 of 10
 Weight maintenance between baseline and follow-up
was defined as relative weight change ±3.0% of baseline
weight [21], or as BMI change ±1.0 kg/m2.
Assessment of other variables
Tobacco use was dichotomised as tobacco use (smoking
or use of moist snuff,) or no current tobacco use. Marital
status was dichotomised as married/cohabiting or sin-
gle/divorced/widowed. Family history of diabetes was de-
fined as presence of diabetes in any parent or sibling.
Educational level was categorised as primary (mandatory
only), any secondary or any tertiary. These variables
were self-reported in the baseline VIP questionnaire.
Statistical analysis
The association between the outcome, incident diabetes
at 10 year follow-up, and within-individual change in
weight and BMI was assessed using logistic regression
generating
odds
ratios
(OR)
and
95%
confidence
intervals (CI). Four models were used to analyse the
data: 1) BMI at 10 year follow-up was modelled as a cat-
egorical variable (<25.0; 25.0–29.9; 30.0–34.9; ≥35.0 kg/
m2) stratified by baseline BMI category, with staying in
the same category as the reference; 2) Absolute BMI
change between baseline and 10 year follow-up was
modelled as a continuous variable stratified by baseline
age and BMI category; 3) Relative weight change be-
tween baseline and 10 year follow-up was modelled as a
categorical variable (> +7.0%; +3.0 to +7.0%; ±3.0%; −3.0
to −7.0%; > −7.0%) stratified by baseline BMI category,
with weight maintenance as the reference.; 4) Relative
weight change between baseline and 10 year follow-up
was modelled as a continuous variable, overall and
stratified by baseline BMI category. Weight change cat-
egories were based on an established definition for
weight maintenance [21], and gain or loss of 5 ± 2%.
Stratification was achieved by including an interaction
term between baseline BMI category and the exposure.
Linearity in models 2 and 4 was tested by introducing a
quadratic term. All models were adjusted for BMI at
baseline (continuous) and the co-variates known to be
associated with body weight and diabetes; sex, age at
baseline (30, 40 or 50 years), calendar year at baseline
(continuous), educational level, marital status, family his-
tory of diabetes and tobacco use. As a sensitivity analysis
we excluded participants who were classified as under-
weight (<18.5 kg/m2) at baseline. To assess the impact of
weight or BMI change on the cumulative 10-year inci-
dence of diabetes in the population we estimated PAFs
with 95% CI using the “punafcc” command in Stata. For
calculating PAFs the modelled counterfactuals were:
weight maintenance vs. any gain (i), moderate weight
loss vs. maintenance or any gain (ii), and large weight
loss vs. moderate loss or maintenance or any gain (iii).
PAFs were calculated using the formula (pd*((OR-1)/
OR)) [22] where pd is the proportion of incident diabetes
cases with the exposure (e.g., those with any weight gain
in (i)) and OR is assumed to be a suitable approximation
of the risk ratio (RR) due to the low prevalence of the
outcome [23]. All data were analysed using Stata v. 13
for Windows.
Results
The mean BMI in the study population was 25.0 (median
24.6, interquartile range (IQR) 22.5-26.9, standard devi-
ation (SD) 3.6) kg/m2 at baseline and 26.3 (median 25.8,
IQR 23.5–28.4, SD 4.1) kg/m2 at 10 year follow-up
(Table 1, Fig. 1). At baseline, 55.2% of the participants had
a normal BMI (<25.0 kg/m2) which fell to 41.2% at 10 year
follow-up. In total, 1.1% (n = 355) of participants were ever
classified as underweight (<18.5 kg/m2). Overall, 29.1% of
participants maintained their weight (±3%) during follow-
up, 56.6% gained weight and 14.2% lost weight.
Overall, 1087 incident diabetes cases were newly de-
tected at 10 year follow-up, constituting 3.3% of the
study population (Table 2). Among the incident diabetes
cases, 33.4% had had IGT or IFG at baseline (data not
shown). The crude proportion of participants with inci-
dent diabetes increased substantially with age, BMI cat-
egory, and relative weight increase. In addition, men
experienced a higher crude diabetes risk than women.
Modelled predicted diabetes risk increased linearly
with increase in relative weight change during follow-up
in all BMI categories (Fig. 2). Participants with higher
BMI at baseline had a higher absolute risk of diabetes
but there was no significant difference in relative risk as-
sociated with change in relative weight between BMI
categories at baseline (p = 0.182 for interaction). Overall
OR for the linear association with diabetes risk per 1%
change in weight was 1.05 (95% CI 1.04, 1.06) (data not
shown). There was no evidence of nonlinearity in the
association between relative weight change and diabetes
risk (p = 0.980 for quadratic term). There were no
differences in relative risk of diabetes between those
aged 40 or 50 years at baseline. With the exception of
the highest BMI category, there was no association be-
tween BMI change and diabetes risk in the youngest par-
ticipants who were aged 30 years at baseline (ORs 1.11,
1.14, and 1.08 per unit BMI change, for baseline BMI
categories <25.0, 25.0–29.9, and 30.0–34.9, respectively).
In the lowest BMI category there was no association
between diabetes risk and relative weight reduction
(−3.0
to
−7.0
or > −7.0%)
vs.
weight
maintenance,
whereas there was a substantially increased risk associ-
ated with relative weight gain (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.63,
2.93 for > +7.0% weight change). In the highest BMI cat-
egory there was no association between relative weight
gain and diabetes risk but a strong association with

 relative weight loss (OR 0.79 (95% CI 0.26, 2.41) for −3.0
to −7.0% weight) (Table 3). Overall results were not af-
fected by excluding participants who were ever under-
weight (data not shown).
PAF results for population shift or maintenance of
weight were very similar when defining weight change as
absolute BMI change or weight change relative to base-
line weight (Table 4). Overall, about 1 in 5 diabetes cases
could be prevented if weight in middle age was main-
tained at the population level; PAF 21.9% (95% CI 15.8,
27.6%) and 22.0% (95% CI 15.5, 28.0%), for maintenance
defined as BMI ±1.0 kg/m2 or weight ±3.0%, respectively
(i). About 2 in 5 cases could be prevented if the popula-
tion distribution of weight was shifted downward by the
equivalent to 5 ± 2% or 1.5 ± 0.5 kg/m2; PAF 42.4% (95%
CI 24.3, 56.1%) and 38.2% (95% CI 23.4, 50.0%),
respectively (ii). As there was no overall benefit with
regards to diabetes risk associated with relative weight loss
for normal weight participants, we repeated PAF calcula-
tions for overweight or obese participants only (PAFs refer
to all diabetes cases); PAF 14.3% (95% CI 8.9, 19.1%) for
weight maintenance (±1 kg/m2) (i), and PAF 23.3% (95%
CI 7.6, 35.0%) for population distribution shift of - 1.0 to
−2.0 kg/m2 in those with ≥25.0 kg/m2 at baseline (ii) (data
not shown). Overall, 29.6% of the eligible participants at
baseline were not followed up (includes deaths and those
who moved out of Vӓsterbotten county during the study
period). Participants lost to follow-up had higher average
baseline BMI (25.6 vs. 25.1 kg/m2) and were more likely to
have IGT or IFG at baseline (40.0 and 35.6% not followed
up, respectively). In addition, we excluded n = 2,496 due
to missing, incomplete or erroneous data on height/
weight or co-variates. There was no difference between
the participants with complete and missing data with
regards to proportion with diabetes, IGT or IFG at
baseline (p = 0.799) or at 10 year follow-up (p = 0.371),
or with regards to average change in BMI between
baseline and follow-up (p = 0.819, for n = 1,423 who
had BMI data available but were missing co-variate
data).
Discussion
In this population-based observational cohort study of
more than 33,000 participants we have shown that there
is a strong association between primary weight mainten-
ance or moderate weight loss and decreased diabetes
risk. By estimating PAFs we have also shown that if
mean population weight could be shifted downwards by
between 1.0 and 2.0 kg/m2, 2 in 5 diabetes cases could
be prevented. This is equivalent to weight loss of be-
tween 3.0 and 6.0 kg for an individual measuring
172.5 cm (the average adult height in Sweden [24]).
Previous trials of lifestyle interventions in high-risk
groups (with IGT and high BMI) have achieved average
weight loss of 3–6 kg [4, 5], but these intensive health
professional-led interventions are costly and could not
be delivered at the necessary scale for the whole popula-
tion at high risk. A more scalable high-risk approach is
to use community-based commercial weight loss pro-
grammes. A recent study estimated that overweight and
obese individuals who completed a 12-week commercial
weight loss programme after referral from the NHS,
achieved on average −5.6% body weight loss [25]. Based
on our data, we can estimate that if all individuals in the
population with BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2 were enrolled in such
a
programme,
and
assuming
the
effect
could
be
sustained over 10 years, an estimated 8.2% of diabetes
cases could be prevented. Considering only about half of
participants
in
trials
of
behavioural
weight
loss
interventions maintain weight loss for >1 year [26], this
is likely greatly overestimated. However, the estimate of
8.2% of diabetes cases prevented if all individuals with
BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2 were referred to a commercial weight
loss
programme
should
be
contrasted

 estimated 21.9% of cases that could be prevented if we
achieved population wide weight maintenance (±1 kg/m2),
clearly illustrating the relative potential of a population-
based approach in addition to an intervention targeted to
individuals above a defined risk thresh-hold.
We have also shown that as many as 1 in 5 diabetes
cases could be prevented if, at a population level, weight
was maintained in adulthood. While primary weight
maintenance in adulthood is challenging [27], it should
be considered in contrast to the even more difficult

 challenge of weight loss and subsequent secondary
weight maintenance [26]. The potential of primary
weight maintenance in reducing diabetes risk and bur-
den is an important public health message, and a
population-based approach to promote primary weight
maintenance (reduce or prevent weight gain in middle
age) is desirable as a complement to targeting individ-
uals at high risk.
There is some evidence that identifies potential popu-
lation level targets associated with weight from model-
ling studies, e.g., of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages
[28], and observational studies, e.g., of the association
with the physical environment [29], but the results have
shown limited effects. Overall, there is a lack of data
available in this field. Two systematic reviews concluded
that there is little evidence for community or individual
level interventions with the purpose of preventing
weight gain in the normal weight population [30, 31],
and there has been limited success in preventing weight
gain in studies that aimed more broadly to reduce risk
factors
for
cardiovascular
disease
[31].
While
a
population-based approach for weight maintenance or
moderate weight loss has considerable potential for
reducing diabetes burden, single interventions are un-
likely to achieve the necessary impact on weight. The
barriers and facilitators associated with primary weight
maintenance are complex [32], and any effective ap-
proach will require changes to policy, environments and
health care systems, and incorporate multiple levels and
components [33].
Several previous observational population-based stud-
ies have examined the association between different
levels of weight gain and incident diabetes risk [15], but
with a few exceptions [34], there has been less focus on
trying to understand the association between moderate
weight loss or maintenance on diabetes incidence at a
population level. Several previous studies have also tried
to estimate PAFs for diabetes associated with the elimin-
ation of overweight and obesity with large variation in
results [10, 11]. Koh-Banerjee and colleagues estimated
the PAF for diabetes incidence associated with weight
maintenance between age 21 to the participants age in
1986 (40–75 years) to be 56% in a cohort of 22,171 men
[14]. There are several important methodological differ-
ences between that study and the present one; for in-
stance, we compared all who maintained their weight to
those who gained ≥3.0% or ≥1.0 kg/m2 whereas the au-
thors in the previous study had a relatively higher cut-
off of ≥7 kg and also included individuals who lost
weight in the reference group which would have contrib-
uted to a higher estimate of relative risk (RR 3.3 vs
equivalent OR 1.52/1.51 in the present study (Table 4)).
Ford and colleagues estimated the PAF for diabetes asso-
ciated with weight maintenance over 7–13 years to be
27% in a cohort of 8545 men and women, using a more
similar cut-off of ≥5 kg for weight gain and a similar
methodological approach to this study [13]. To our
knowledge, the present study is the first to also estimate
PAFs for moderate weight loss at a population level.
This study has several strengths, in particular the large
sample size, objectively measured exposure and high
quality and systematic ascertainment of the outcome of
diabetes status based on OGTT. When diabetes is ascer-
tained through self-report or from general practice med-
ical records, there is a danger of differential over
diagnosis in groups at high risk, i.e., with a high BMI.
However, as all participants in VIP underwent OGTTs,
the risk of surveillance (ascertainment) bias of the out-
come is minimised. The large population-based sample
allowed us to study effects and impact of weight change
in individuals at low as well as high risk of diabetes. The
fact that we studied intra-individual change in weight as
opposed to between-individual difference in weight pro-
vides strong support for a causal interpretation of our
results.
The primary limitation of this study was that we only
had data from two time-points, 10 years apart, and were
not able to at present prospectively follow up enough
participants for the outcome after the weight change
(e.g., to the 20-year follow-up). As one of the symptoms
of diabetes is weight loss [17], our results may be some-
what attenuated since diabetes is diagnosed at the same
time as the second weight measurement. Similarly, the
observational nature of the study means that we cannot
distinguish between intentional and unintentional weight
loss, which is important with regards to overall mortality
risk [35] and thus may be important with regards to dia-
betes risk as well. To address the potential for bias due
to reverse causation we had to exclude participants who
self-reported diabetes and we may thus have underesti-
mated the prevalence of diabetes in the study popula-
tion, and consequently the PAFs are also likely be
somewhat underestimated. However, the prevalence of
diabetes in the population was comparable to the esti-
mated prevalence in the Swedish population [36]. The
VIP protocol did not include measurement of waist cir-
cumference during the period of baseline measurements
in the present study, and it was thus not possible to
study change in visceral adiposity, which may have
added value in additional to change in weight in relation
to diabetes [37]. About one third of the eligible baseline
participants could not be followed up or were excluded
due to missing data; participants with IFG or IGT at
baseline were more likely not be followed-up and BMI
was higher in those lost compared to those who were
followed up. As change in weight was associated with
baseline BMI and those who were obese on average in-
creased less in weight than normal weight participants,
Feldman et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:170 
Page 8 of 10
 our results may have somewhat overestimated the mag-
nitude of the association between change in weight and
diabetes risk. However, since there was no evidence of
an interaction between baseline BMI category and
change in weight for the association with incident dia-
betes risk, the resulting bias is likely limited. Mean BMI
in the study population (25.0–26.3 kg/m2, age 30–60
years) was comparable to the mean BMI in the Swedish
population for ages 30–59 years (25.1–26.2 kg/m2) [24].
Conclusions
There is great potential from a public health perspective
for diabetes prevention in promoting primary weight
maintenance for the whole population, in addition to
moderate weight loss in individuals with a BMI ≥25.0 kg/
m2 and the current approach of targeting interventions to
individuals in high risk groups.
