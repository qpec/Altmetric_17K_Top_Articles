The relationship of elevated depression risk recently discovered among adult persons raised by same-sex parents with possible
precipitating conditions in childhood has not previously been acknowledged. This study tests whether such inattention is
supportable. Logistic regression based risk ratios were estimated from longitudinal measures of mental health outcomes observed
in three waves (at ages 15, 22, and 28) of the US National Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (ùëõ = 15,701). At age 28, the adults
raised by same-sex parents were at over twice the risk of depression (CES-D: risk ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.4‚Äì4.6) as persons raised by
man-woman parents. These findings should be interpreted with caution. Elevated risk was associated with imbalanced parental
closeness and parental child abuse in family of origin; depression, suicidality, and anxiety at age 15; and stigma and obesity. More
research and policy attention to potentially problematic conditions for children with same-sex parents appears warranted.
1. Background
In research and policy settings, children in unique distress
with same-sex parents are not supposed to exist. Most studies
have reported ‚Äúno differences‚Äù in well-being, most often using
psychometric measures of depression or anxiety, supporting
a lapse in policy attention to the potential needs of such
children. Uniformly benign findings for this population
have recently been challenged, however, by several original
research efforts [1‚Äì3], the rediscovery of older studies [4, 5],
and the reanalysis of studies long thought to support ‚Äúno
differences‚Äù [6].
The sparse and gendered nature of the same-sex parent
population largely restricts research in this area to the exami-
nation of small samples of lesbian parents. Unfortunately,
this difficulty has prompted an almost universal dependence
on convenience samples [7, 8] recruited, with knowledge of
study goals, from internet surveys, ‚ÄúLGBT events, bookstore
and newspaper advertisements, word of mouth, network-
ing, and youth groups‚Äù [2]. Reanalyses have confirmed,
not surprisingly, the presence in such samples of strong
ascertainment bias, social desirability bias, and/or positive
reporting bias [9‚Äì11]. In most studies, lack of statistical sig-
nificance using simple bivariate tests in such samples is then
erroneously interpreted as strong evidence of ‚Äúno differences‚Äù
in the population, even when difference in estimates or effect
sizes are substantively large and even though the sample is not
representative [12].
In fact, only four of the several dozen studies alleging
‚Äúno differences‚Äù have examined a representative sample. The
largest and most recent of these, Rosenfeld‚Äôs analysis of 3,174
same-sex parented children on the US Census, is discussed
in Section 5. The other three are related studies based on a
single sample, a group of 44 adolescents with lesbian parents
captured on over 20,000 population-representative cases of
the initial wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of
Adolescent Health (‚ÄúAdd Health‚Äù) [13‚Äì15]. Sullins, however,
recently found that most (27 of the 44) adolescents in this
sample allegedly with same-sex parents were actually living
with opposite-sex parents including, for most of them, their
biological father as well as their mother. After removing the
mixed cases, the remaining sample members fared signifi-
cantly worse on psychometric measures of anxiety and auton-
omy than did their adolescent counterparts with opposite-
sex parents, albeit comprising only 17 cases [16]. Other
studies employing large representative samples have also
found higher depressive symptoms, indicated by the Center
for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D [17]),

among younger same-sex parented children [18] and adults
who report having had a same-sex-related parent at some
point during childhood [1]. The design and methodology of
Regnerus‚Äô study were the subject of a brief but vigorous debate
[19‚Äì21], which turned largely on definitional issues [22].
No study has yet explored the connection, if any, between
late onset distress and precipitating conditions in children in
this population, and no research reporting ‚Äúno differences‚Äù
has yet investigated parental child abuse or adult onset
difficulties [24]. The present study aims to amend these gaps
in the research. It improves on the sample limitations of
prior studies by employing data that are both representa-
tive and longitudinal, following the corrected Add Health
sample of adolescents with lesbian parents, the most well-
regarded small sample used in this field to date, through
Wave IV, thirteen years after the initial interview at age 15
(on average). It improves on prior methods by the use of
standard psychometric scales, to the extent possible, and the
estimation of relative risk by logistic regression models with
appropriate survey weighting. As the first study to examine
children raised by same-sex parents into early adulthood, this
exploratory study aims to contribute new information for
understanding of the effects of same-sex parenting through
the life-course transition into early adulthood.
The analysis followed a grounded theory approach, first
identifying the presence or absence of pertinent differences
by family type and then developing and testing grounded
hypotheses, drawing both from the observed bivariate char-
acteristics of the data and prior research where applicable. For
clarity the research presentation will also follow this order,
with the formulation of hypotheses presented following
initial bivariate results.
2. Data and Methods
This study implements data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (‚ÄúAdd Health‚Äù), which
has followed a representative sample of American adolescents
through interviews at average age 15 (Wave I, baseline)
in 1995, age 22 in 2002 (Wave III), and age 28 in 2008
(Wave IV, terminus). Wave I completed home interviews with
20,745 American adolescents aged 13‚Äì19 and their mothers
selected from a sample of US high schools and rendered
representative through the application of poststratification
weights, reduced by mortality to 15,701 at Wave IV. Missing
data on analytical control variables reduced available cases
in the present analysis to 12,288, which was reduced further
by missing data on variables of interest, depending on the
analysis, to as low as 8,762.
Same-sex parents were identified using the procedure
described by Wainright et al. [13] as corrected by Sullins
[6]. To assure accurate identification of same-sex partners,
sex of partner was independently identified by both mother
and respondent. All analyses were performed with Stata 13
statistical software (StataCorp LP), incorporating the design
features of the survey following guidelines published by the
Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina
[25]. Procedures for data access and analysis were approved
by the institutional review board of the Catholic University
of America and in agreement with the sensitive data security
plan approved by Add Health.
The comparison sample comprised 20 unweighted cases
of adolescents with same-sex parents, consisting of 17 lesbian
partners and 3 gay male partners. Analytical controls adjusted
for demographic differences between the general population
and this group of adolescents, which was older (15.4 years, SE
.97 versus 15.0 years, SE .12) and disproportionately female
(72.1%, SE 11.4 versus 49.0%, SE .55) and white (81.1%, SE 10.6
versus 73.2%, SE 2.5). Compared to the general parent popu-
lation, the same-sex parents were much more highly educated
(66.2%, SE 15.6 had a college degree, versus 26.1%, SE 1.5 of
parents overall) but had lower income ($36.5k, SE $6k versus
$45.2k, SE $1.7k in 1995). These differences are consistent
with prior studies of lesbian parents, which have found
that, despite possible higher education, the combination of
two female incomes and a higher proportion of household
caregiving generally results in lower income [26, 27].
2.1. Variables in the Analysis. Table 1 presents for reference
the adjusted means by family type for the variables in the
analysis. Depressive symptoms at Wave I and Wave IV
were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies‚Äô
Depression Scale (CES-D) which was administered in the in-
home interview [17]. The items in the scale name a list of
symptoms such as feeling sad, lonely, tired, or bothered about
things. The response range for each item is from 0 (never or
rarely) to 3 (most of the time or all of the time). The Wave IV
interview employed an abbreviated version that included 5 of
the 19 items and identified depressed individuals by means
of an item-weighted classification performed by Add Health
analysts at the University of North Carolina.
Anxiety at Wave I was assessed by a series of six
items which asked about both physical conditions such as
sleeplessness or poor appetite and more direct indicators
of emotional distress such as moodiness, fearfulness, or
frequent crying. Parental distance was constructed from two
variables asking how close the respondent felt to his or her
father and mother. Respondents reporting that they felt very
little or no closeness to one or both parents were coded as
experiencing parental distance. Perceived stigmatization was
measured by two questions that asked about being treated
with less respect than other people and feeling as good as
other people. Respondents scoring high on the first item and
low on the second one were classified as having experienced
or internalized stigma. Body mass index (BMI) was computed
from physical measurements of height and weight at the Wave
IV interview. BMI over 30 was classified as obese. Women
currently pregnant were excluded.
Retrospective questions at Waves III and IV asked about
adult mistreatment during childhood, including whether a
parent or caregiver had ‚Äúslapped, hit or kicked you,‚Äù said
‚Äúthings that hurt your feelings or made you feel you were not
wanted or loved,‚Äù or ‚Äútouched you in a sexual way, forced you
to touch him or her in a sexual way, or forced you to have
sex relations.‚Äù Respondents reporting any physical, verbal, or
sexual abuse at either Wave were coded positive for abuse
victimization. Four-fifths (79%, 95% CI 77‚Äì80) of reported
mistreatment was verbal abuse.

Test shown tests the equivalence of the logit coefficients, that is, ln(OS/SS) = 0. Effect size reports standard mean difference following Chinn [23].
Adjustments for sociodemographic differences included
parent education and income, respondent sex, age, and race,
and respondent education and household income at Wave IV.
Race or ethnicity was measured as five categories modeled
on the US Census: Hispanic, white, black, Asian, and other.
Sex was measured as male or female and age in years.
Parental income in dollars was reported at Wave I; respondent
income at Wave IV was measured in eleven categories with
midpoints from $7,500 to $150,000. Education was expressed
in four categories: no high diploma, high school diploma
only, college degree, or more. Risk of depression declined
moderately with higher income and higher education.
3. Hypotheses
Emergent differential depression risk for the children with
same-sex parents may be related to several conditions or
factors in their unique circumstances. The following discus-
sion in this section reflects four associations reflecting initial
analysis and suggestions from prior literature. Since they
are constrained by available data, they are neither mutually
exclusive nor comprehensive; all may have some effect, as well
as other, unobserved, associations.
3.1. Mental Health at Baseline. Abundant research has found
that depression in adolescence is one of the largest predictors
of depression in adulthood. In the present study, adolescent
mental health also serves as a direct test of the idea that dif-
ferential risk by family type is related to emergent adulthood,
since that idea must be rejected or qualified to the extent that
mental health conditions in adulthood are associated with the
same conditions at adolescence.
3.2. Family of Origin Factors. Two characteristics that dif-
fered significantly by family type, level of parental abuse
and the pattern of parent-child closeness, have previously
been implicated in the onset of adult depression. The link
between adult depression and reported childhood sexual,
physical, or verbal abuse is well known [28, 29]. Recent
studies have argued that verbal abuse may be more strongly
related to negative internalization and the development of
depression than physical or sexual abuse [30]. Parent-child
closeness has also long been linked to emotional development
in adolescence and early adulthood [31, 32]. Absence of
the father during adolescence‚Äîthe most common form
of deficient parental closeness‚Äîhas been associated with
a variety of negative outcomes including depression [33].
Amato and Afifi found that an imbalance in current parental
closeness, that is, being close to one parent but not the other,
also lowered subjective well-being for adult children in their
twenties [34]. In the present study, preliminary modeling on
closeness to mother and father confirmed that the bulk of the
variation in depression was related to whether the respondent
had been (at Wave I) or was currently (at Wave IV) close to
both parents or not.
3.3. Wave IV Association Pathways. Differential social stigma
or sensitivity to stigma faced by same-sex families has often
been cited as an impediment to psychosocial development
in children with same-sex parents, including adult children
raised by lesbians [35, 36]. In the present data such persons
were almost five times more likely to have experienced stigma
or perceived stigma as adults, suggesting that their higher
mental distress may be associated with a strong differential
experience of stigma.
Obesity was also much higher among the adults with
same-sex parents and has in turn been linked to higher
depression. In a 2010 meta-analysis summarizing 15 longi-
tudinal studies, Luppino and colleagues reported that obese
Americans were twice as likely (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5‚Äì3.0)

to develop depression as were nonobese Americans [37].
Obesity has also been found to be linked to childhood abuse
[38] and to stigma that can contribute to depression [39].
4. Results
4.1. Bivariate Results. The initial evidence for delayed onset
of higher depression risk for the same-sex parented children
is presented in Table 2, illustrating comparisons from Table 1.
Depression risk for this group at Wave I was lower than for
the general population, after accounting for differences in
family socioeconomic status, but by Wave IV the risk ratio
for depression had increased to 2.6. Most of the increased
risk was due to a marked increase in the rate of depression
for the children with same-sex parents, from less than a fifth
at Wave I to over half at Wave IV, corresponding to a slight
decrease in depression among the general population over the
same period of maturation. By Wave IV the difference is both
statistically and substantively significant, with an effect size
approaching a full standard deviation.
The dependent variables in the analysis, already presented
in Table 1 and discussed in Section 3, were selected from
a large number of possibilities by retaining those that met
at least one of two tests: the condition either was plausibly
associated with affectivity or showed a similar pattern of
increase or persistence over the transition into adulthood
as did the independent variable of interest, that is, the
depression risk ratio.
Three possible depression covariates demonstrated a
strong risk ratio at Wave I which they retained at Wave
IV: suicidality, parental distance, and obesity. The risk ratio
for suicidality, a mental health measure directly related to
affective distress, was, like depression, higher at Wave IV
than at Wave I. At both Wave I and Wave IV, more of the
adolescents with lesbian parents reported feeling close to
their mother, while fewer reported feeling close to their father,
compared to the case for the comparison group. All of the
former group at Wave I and almost all of them at Wave IV
felt extremely or very close to their mother; less than half at
both points in time reported feeling extremely or very close
to their father.
Obesity was much more common among the same-sex
parented adults than for the comparison group and increased
substantially among both groups into early adulthood. By
Wave IV, over two-thirds (72%) of the same-sex parented
adults were measured as obese, compared to 37% of the
comparison group. Anxiety, a direct measure of affectivity,
was also higher at Wave I and perceived stigma was higher
at Wave IV; unfortunately these variables were not measured
at other waves.
4.2. Multivariate Model. Table 3 presents logistic regression
results modeling the association of the hypotheses outlined in
Section 3 with the depression risk ratio for same-sex parented
adults at Wave IV. Model 3.1 estimates that the children with
same-sex parents are 2.6 times more likely to experience
depression at Wave IV, after adjusting for demographic
differences. This model is identical to the corresponding
estimates presented in Tables 1 and 2.
In interpreting the models in Table 3, it is important to
bear in mind that the outcome of interest is not depres-
sion risk but the differential risk of depression between
the same-sex parented children and the comparison group,
as expressed by the risk ratio. As hypothesized, mental
health measures of depression, suicidality, and anxiety at
adolescence (Wave I) were strong predictors of mental health
outcomes in early adulthood (Wave IV). However, as Model
3.2 shows, they were associated with only a moderate (13%)
reduction in risk ratio at Wave IV, consistent with the
mixed results for mental health differences for the same-sex
parented children at Wave I. Likewise, child abuse and lack of
closeness to parents, both strongly associated with depression
and more prevalent with same-sex parents, were associated
with only another 13% reduction in the estimated risk ratio,
from 2.25 to 1.95 in Model 3.3. Perceived stigma, the most
powerful single predictor of depression at Wave IV in the
analysis, was associated with only a further 9% moderation of
the risk ratio. Altogether, Model 3.4, which included mental
health at adolescence, family of origin factors, and perceived
stigma, reduced the risk ratio toward unity by about half
(from 2.58 to 1.77). The six independent variables in this
model all are strongly associated with depression risk but
appear to affect both groups of children more similarly than
differently.
By contrast, obesity at Wave IV was not a significant
predictor of depression risk itself but had a very strong asso-
ciation with the increased risk of depression for the children
with same-sex parents. The odds on depression associated
with obesity, shown in Model 3.5, are not significantly or sub-
stantively different from unity. However, including obesity
in the model, in addition to the other predictors discussed,
accounts for all of the remaining difference in risk between

association with depression risk itself but has the strongest
association of any variable in the analysis with the higher risk
ratio for depression for the children with same-sex parents.
5. Discussion
The presence of delayed onset depression for children with
same-sex parents may help to explain both findings of ‚Äúno
difference‚Äù in mental health at adolescence and substantial
differences in adult mental health when compared to children
with opposite-sex parents.
Interpretation of these limited small-sample findings is
necessarily speculative. Emergent differences in depression
risk associated with obesity, parental distance, and suffering
abuse may suggest an association of emergent depression
risk with maturation or family formation processes following
departure from the family of origin. The modal case for
females with same-sex parents in these data was to depart the
family of origin for a male sexual relationship in their teens,
which may favor an explanation related to family formation.
As noted above, 72% of the same-sex parented children were
female; the estimated Wave IV risk ratio for depression for
these cases is higher, at 2.8 (95% CI 1.9‚Äì4.1), than for the
sample as a whole.
Greater closeness to one or both same-sex parents, com-
pared to children with heterosexual parents, has often been
documented in the study population [40] and is confirmed
by the present study. However, no study has yet examined
the effect of the corresponding distance from the excluded
biological parent. As Table 1 shows, the very high rate of
parental distance at adolescence (93%) for this population
moderates by early adulthood, while increasing somewhat
for the general population, suggesting the partial resolution
of any differential distress related directly to this factor. On
the other hand, increased distress in early adulthood may
be related to conflicts or ambivalence involving resolving
parental distance while at the same time establishing inde-
pendence from the family of origin.
The high prevalence of obesity in the adult children of
lesbian parents also reflects known characteristics of this
parent population. Fredriksen-Goldsen and colleagues found
that obesity among lesbians was associated with a lower
health-related quality of life, which predicted higher mental
distress among both lesbian and (nonobese) heterosexual
women [41]. On the other hand, Cochran and Mays, compar-
ing samples of heterosexual and lesbian women, found that
mental distress among lesbians was not significantly higher
after controlling for lower physical health [42].
The well-documented tendency toward greater levels of
intimate violence in same-sex partnerships [43, 44] appears
also to be present in parental relationships. Prevalence was
notably high. Ninety percent of the same-sex parented chil-
dren reported parental abuse at Wave III, dropping only to
85% at Wave IV. Prior studies have not documented this
abuse, most likely because almost all have been based on
parental reports, which minimize abuse self-reporting, and
none (to my knowledge) have ever asked directly about
parental abuse. In the only prior study based on retrospec-
tive reports, children with lesbian mothers (including those
temporarily in a lesbian relationship) reported a substantially
higher rate of sexual abuse, at 23%, than did those with
consistently heterosexual parents [1].
The results of the present study may be inconsistent
with those of a 2010 study by Rosenfeld which found no
significant difference in school completion rates for a sample
of 3,174 children with same-sex parents drawn from the 2000
Census Public Use Microsample [45]. This study is the only
large representative-sample study of same-sex parents to date
that has found ‚Äúno differences.‚Äù However, Rosenfeld ignored
(or was unaware of) a misclassification error affecting the
attribution of same-sex couples on the 2000 Census reported
earlier by Black and colleagues [46]. After reviewing the
census attribution procedures, Black et al. concluded that at
 6
Depression Research and Treatment
least forty percent of the cases in the same-sex couples sample
‚Äúare actually different-sex married couples‚Äù [46, page 9],
warning researchers that ‚Äúmany of the inferences drawn from
these data are incorrect‚Äù [46, page 10]. Allen failed to replicate
Rosenfeld‚Äôs finding using the Canadian census [2] and has
disputed Rosenfeld‚Äôs analysis [47]. Even if Rosenfeld‚Äôs finding
is correct, however, it is not necessarily inconsistent with the
present findings. Sullins, using the same sample as the present
study, found that the children with lesbian parents attained
higher grade point averages in high school while at the same
time displaying higher affective distress [6]. Sullins specu-
lated, on the basis of retrospective narrative reports from
children raised by lesbians, that high control parental behav-
ior may account for this apparent anomaly. The relationship
between school performance and affectivity for same-sex
parented children may be different compared to that in the
general population, may vary by parental gender, and merits
further focused research to clarify these disparate findings.
Limitations. Despite the signal strengths of Add Health as
a large nationally representative longitudinal dataset and
notwithstanding the strong significance for contrast effects
reported above, the very small size of the sample of children
raised by lesbians imposes important limits and prompts
great caution regarding the conclusions of this study. As
with all observational studies, causal inference is not pos-
sible. Moreover, many subtle distinctions and pathways of
influence simply cannot be addressed with only 20 cases,
and unobserved differences between the parent comparison
groups may well confound some or all of the child differences
observed. In particular, the lack of useful measures for
parent mental distress, depression, family history of violence,
alcohol consumption, and substance abuse precluded exami-
nation of important familial risk factors which may be associ-
ated with child distress. For these reasons, the findings of this
study should be considered only provisional and exploratory
until and unless they are confirmed by further research.
6. Conclusion
The emergence of higher depression risk in early adulthood,
coupled with a more frequent history of abuse victimization,
parental distance, and obesity, suggests that the inattention of
research and policy to the problems of children with same-sex
parents is unwarranted. As initial results, the present findings
should be interpreted with caution and balance, based on
the limited evidence presented, and (it is hoped) neither
exaggerated nor dismissed out of hand on preconceived
ideological grounds. However, well-intentioned concern for
revealing negative information about a stigmatized minority
does not justify leaving children without support in an
environment that may be problematic or dangerous for their
dignity and security.
