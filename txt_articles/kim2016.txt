Background: The prevalence of adult obesity exceeds 30% in the United
States, posing a significant public health concern as well as a substantial
financial burden. Although the impact of obesity on medical spending is
undeniably significant, the estimated magnitude of the cost of obesity
has varied considerably, perhaps driven by different study method-
ologies. Objectives: To document variations in study design and meth-
odology in existing literature and to understand the impact of those
variations on the estimated costs of obesity. Methods: We conducted a
systematic review of the twelve recently published articles that reported
costs of obesity and performed a meta-analysis to generate a pooled
estimate across those studies. Also, we performed an original analysis
to understand the impact of different age groups, statistical models, and
confounder adjustment on the magnitude of estimated costs using the
nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys from 2008-
2010. Results: We found significant variations among cost estimates in
the existing literature. The meta-analysis found that the annual
medical spending attributable to an obese individual was $1901
($1239-$2582) in 2014 USD, accounting for $149.4 billion at the
national level. The two most significant drivers of variability in
the cost estimates were age groups and adjustment for obesity-
related comorbid conditions. Conclusions: It would be important to
acknowledge variations in the magnitude of the medical cost of
obesity driven by different study design and methodology. Research-
ers and policy-makers need to be cautious on determining appropriate
cost estimates according to their scientific and political questions.

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity, which is defined as a body mass index
(BMI) of greater than 30, has increased dramatically in the United
States since the late 1990s [1]. So much so that recently obesity
has been officially recognized as a disease by the American
Medical Association, an action that could put more emphasis
on the health condition by doctors and insurance companies so
as to minimize its adverse effects. Currently, rates of obesity
exceed 30% in most sex and adult age groups, whereas its
prevalence among children and adolescents, defined as a BMI of
more than 95th percentile, has reached 17% [2].
The alarming rates of the high prevalence of obesity have
posed a significant public health concern as well as a substantial
financial burden on our society because obesity is known to be a
risk factor for many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes,
cancer, hypertension, asthma, myocardial infarction, stroke, and
other conditions�[3,4]. To understand the economic burden of
obesity,
several
studies
have
attempted
to
estimate
the
attributable costs of obesity, following the burden-of-illness
literature on other disease areas [5–9]. A previous cost-of-illness
study estimated that health care spending attributable to the
rising prevalence of obesity has increased by 27% between 1987
and 2001 [10]. In gross terms, the annual medical costs of obesity
were estimated to be $40 billion in 2006 [11]. The latest study
using an instrumental variable (IV) approach even showed that
the estimated medical costs related to obesity could reach $209.7
billion, which is twice higher than the previous estimate, $86
billion [12].
As evidenced by the aforementioned estimates, although the
impact of obesity on the medical care spending is undeniably
significant, the estimated magnitude of the medical care costs
attributable to obesity has varied considerably, perhaps driven by
different study methodologies, including data, statistical models,
confounder adjustment, and target populations. In this article,
we approach these issues systematically with two goals: 1) to
conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recently
published articles that estimated the medical costs associated

 with obesity between 2008 and 2012 and to document the
variations in study methodologies and 2) to demonstrate the
importance of study methodologies by performing an original
analysis to examine the impact of age group, confounder adjust-
ment, and statistical methods on the cost estimates of obesity
through the empirical analysis of a nationally representative US
population. Especially, we also examined the impact of obesity-
related diseases (ORDs) on the medical costs of obesity to show
that most, if not all, of those costs are attributable to ORDs.
We believe that it would be important to recognize significant
variations among estimates of obesity-attributable costs in the
existing literature and to understand the impact of study meth-
odology on the magnitude of these estimates so that researchers
and policymakers are able to determine the appropriate estimate
and methods according to their scientific and political questions.
Methods
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
Literature search
We searched the MEDLINE and Cochran database to identify
articles related to medical costs of obesity using keywords
“obesity AND (cost OR expenditure) AND healthcare)) AND
“united states.” To account for the unique health care system
and the impact of costs attributable to obesity in the United
States, we limited the search to studies conducted in the US
settings. We initially identified 567 articles from the search, then
narrowed down to 16 articles for in-depth reviews. Following the
extensive reviews, we excluded three studies that did not provide
explicit methods and/or aggregate annual costs per person, in
addition to a previously conducted systematic review [13–16].
Finally, we included 12 studies in this study for the systematic
review [17–26]. Appendix Figure A in Supplemental Materials
found at http://dx.dor.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.008 provides details
on search strategies for identifying studies included in this review.
Improve comparability across studies
To improve comparability across heterogeneous studies, we
performed appropriate adjustments to convert estimates from
each study into annual per-person costs among all obese pop-
ulation (BMI Z 30).
First, we converted cost estimates to 2014 USD to adjust for
the inflation over time using annual average consumer price
index for medical care [27]. One study reported the quarter-per-
person medical costs, and we annualized the cost estimate [17].
All the 12 studies reported direct medical costs, including the out-
of-pocket costs for inpatient, noninpatient (outpatient, emer-
gency room, and other), and prescription drug spending.
Then, we aggregated all BMI-specific estimates into a single
composite estimate of costs attributable to all obese individuals.
Among the 12 studies, 8 studies defined obesity as a BMI of
greater than 30 whereas 4 studies implemented more compre-
hensive obesity categories, defined as class I obesity (30 o BMI r
35), class II obesity (35 o BMI r 40), and class III obesity (40 o
BMI) [21,22,24,26]. Two of the four studies combined class II and
class III obesity into a single category because of the sample size
issue [22,26]. To generate comparable cost estimates, we calcu-
lated a weighted average among subgroup-specific estimates on
the basis of the number of each subgroup reported in each of the
four studies.
In addition, three studies estimated sex-specific costs of
obesity [18,20,23], and one study provided race (non-Hispanic
whites vs. blacks) stratified results [26]. Another study reported
both sex and race (non-Hispanic whites vs. blacks) stratified
estimates [19]. Based on the sample size of each stratum
presented in each study, only the weighted average estimates
for aggregating sex and race categories are presented in Table 2.
Evaluating quality of studies
We evaluated the quality of studies on the basis of four criteria:
the use of nationally representative samples, longitudinal data
sets, analysis of adults of all ages, and appropriate confounding
factor adjustments. A previous systematic review also used a
similar set of criteria for evaluating cost-of-illness studies of
obesity [13].
Meta-analysis
To generate a pooled estimate of medical costs of obesity across
different studies, we conducted a meta-analysis using the metaan
command in STATA 12 (StataCorp., College Station, TX) [28]. The
metaan command is used to conduct random-effect meta-anal-
ysis for one-variable relationship. Because the meta-analysis for
one-variable relationship requires both the effect size estimate
and the standard error, we were able to include only eight
estimates of annual incremental costs of obesity from seven
studies (Table 2). Because of the presence of extremely high
heterogeneity between studies (I2 ¼ 96.61%; τ2 ¼ 5.6 � 105), the
random-effect model is used in the final analysis.
Empirical Analysis: The Role of Alternative Statistical Models
in Estimating Costs of Obesity
Study data
The medical costs of obesity were estimated using regression
analysis and the 2008-2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys
(MEPS). The MEPS is a nationally representative survey of the
civilian noninstitutionalized population, collecting detailed infor-
mation on health care expenditures and utilization, health
insurance, health status, and sociodemographic factors. Nation-
ally representative estimates were obtained by using MEPS
sampling weights.
Variables
As a dependent variable, medical care costs (which include costs for
office-based visits, hospital outpatient visits, emergency room
visits, inpatient hospital stays, prescription drugs, dental visits,
and home care) are defined as the sum of direct payments from
all parties (out-of-pocket, private insurers, government, and other
payers) for care provided during the year. For a primary inde-
pendent variable, we identified obesity status on the basis of the
constructed BMI through self-reported height and measure [29].
(Please note that because of confidentiality concerns and restric-
tions, the self-reported weight and height variables were not
available from the public-access MEPS data sets.) Also, we
categorized potential confounding factors into four categories to
examine the impact of confounder adjustments on the magni-
tude of the cost estimates: 1) Demographic factors or cov1 (age,
sex, and race/ethnicity), 2) Socioeconomic factors or cov2 (edu-
cation, household income based on the federal poverty line,
smoking status, and marital status), 3) Additional factors or
cov3 (census region and insurance status), and 4) comorbidity
conditions or cov4. Comorbidity conditions are defined as a con-
tinuous variable ranging from 0 to 10 by summing up 10 potential
health consequences that can be caused be obesity. These
conditions, called ORDs, which are defined by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, include hypertension, heart
diseases (coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction,
others), stroke, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and high cholesterol
[30]. In this data set, children or adolescents (age o 18 years)
do not have any information on comorbidity conditions and

Study design and data analysis
To study the impact of various study designs, we examined three
different aspects of estimating medical costs in a regression
analysis: age groups, statistical models, and confounder adjust-
ments. The age groups were 1) children/adolescents (aged 0–17
years), 2) all adults (aged Z 18 years), 3) adults aged 18 to 65
years, and 4) older adults (aged Z65 years). Considering the
nature of cost data, such as non-negative observations, a large
number of observations at zero, and positive skewness, we
examined five different statistical models that have been widely
used to estimate the medical costs: 1) linear regression, 2) log-
linear model (a simple ordinary least square for ln(y)), 3) one-part
log-gamma generalized linear model (GLM), 4) two-part model
with a logistic regression and a log-gamma GLM, and 5) extended
estimating equation (EEE) that used both a flexible link and a
flexible variance function estimated directly from the data to
capture the underlying nonlinearity in the data so that it can
produce efficient estimates [31–34]. Also, we tested the goodness
of fit (GoF) of each statistical model to examine how well the
model fits a data set using Pearson correlation, Pregobon’s link
test, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. In regard to confounder adjust-
ment, four sets of confounders were studied: 1) Demographic
factors (cov1), 2) Demographic þ Socioeconomic factors (cov1 þ
cov2), 3) Demographic þ Socioeconomic þ Additional factors
(cov1 þ cov2 þ cov3), and 4) All three factors þ ORDs (cov1 þ
cov2 þ cov3 þ cov4). Using different combinations of the target
population, statistical models, and confounder adjustment, we
estimated medical care costs of nonobese individuals (so called
costs of normal) as well as incremental costs of obesity through
recycled predictions to estimate the counterfactual mean costs if
all individuals in the data set were suddenly to have obesity
while retained all other characteristics as compared with being
nonobese for all individuals. We also tested the GoF of five
different statistical models with each of four different sets of
confounding factors for the sample population of all adults. All
standard errors and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated
from 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Results
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
Descriptive results
Among the 12 studies included in this systematic review, 9
studies reported annual medical care costs per person while 2
studies provided lifetime medical care costs per person and 1
study reported both estimates. Six studies used the MEPS data-
base, whereas four studies used the Medicare Current Beneficiary
Survey database. The remaining two studies used the Prospective
Obesity Cohort of Economic Evaluation and Determinants data
set, which is a multinational, observational, prospective Internet-
based cohort study and the Mayo clinic employment database,
respectively (Table 1).
Quality evaluation
Based on four quality criteria, no studies met all criteria, because
all the studies that used a nationally representative data set were
not a longitudinal study or vice versa. Among 10 studies that
reported annual costs per person, 5 studies were designated as
“high-quality (score ¼ 3)” study (Table 1). Because Cawley’s study
was the only study that estimated medical costs of obesity using
the instrumental variable IV approach to account for unobserved

Cost estimates
The annual incremental costs of obesity per person ranged from
$227 to $7269 depending on the study designs and research
methods. Tables 2 and 3 provide details on different study
methodologies and reported cost estimates. From the meta-
analysis with the random-effect model, the pooled estimate of
annual medical costs of obesity was $1910 (95% CI $1239–$2582).

Three studies reported the lifetime costs associated with
obesity after adjusting for survival. One study estimated the
lifetime costs of obesity with a 3% annual discount on the
dollar value, resulting in $23,123 from age 20 years and $19,022
from age 65 years [19], whereas another study without using a
discount rate reported the lifetime costs of $43,904 from age 65
years [18].

 Stratified results
Among the studies that provided stratified estimates of the
medical costs attributable to obesity, the annual costs increased
in higher obese categories [21,22,24,26] and the lifetime costs of
obesity were also positively associated with an increasing BMI
[19]. The magnitude of the annual costs related to obesity was
higher among women than among men [18–20,23]. Also, obese
blacks were found to spend less medical costs than obese whites,
mainly due to more use of relatively inexpensive types of care
(office-based visits, outpatient care, medications) rather than
more costly ones (inpatient, emergency room) [19,26].
Different study methodology
Among the 10 studies that estimated annual medical care cost
attributable to obesity, a two-part model was the most popular
method used by four studies. Three of those four studies imple-
mented a logistic regression with a log-gamma GLM [11,12,21],
whereas another study used a logit model with a log-linear model
[23]. Two studies used a one-part GLM method with a log link and a
gamma distribution [22,25]. A generalized estimating equation [24]
and a log-linear regression model [17] were used in other two studies,
respectively, and the remaining two studies reported unadjusted
annual costs of obesity [20,26]. Because each study used distinctive
data sets to various study methodologies, it is hard to predict the
actual impact of a range of study methodologies on the magnitude of
the costs of obesity. However, one study using both a two-part model
and an IV approach provided that the effect of obesity on medical
care costs was much greater with the IV method than was previously
appreciated with the two-part model. The instrument used in the
study was the weight of a biological relative [12].
Different confounder adjustment
We defined confounding factors that were widely used to adjust
for the causal inference among these studies, including demo-
graphic factors, socioeconomic factors, additional factors, and
obesity-related comorbidity conditions. However, none of these
studies selected the same set of confounding factors. Table 1
presents a significant variability in choosing confounding factors,
and the substantial variability poses an essential problem of
comparing these estimates directly. A study that examined two
models with and without adjusting for comorbidity conditions as
a confounding factor found that incremental costs of obesity
dropped significantly when adjusted for comorbidities [24].
Estimating Medical Costs of Obesity
With possible combinations of the four age groups, the five statistical
models, and the four sets of potential confounders, 80 estimates of
costs of normal and incremental costs of obesity were generated
with 95% CIs. All possible cost estimates are provided in Table 4.
Characteristics of individuals in the data set
Individual characteristics used in estimating medical costs of
obesity are presented in Appendix Table A in Supplemental
Materials found at http://dx.dor.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.008. In
this analysis, the data set includes 15,176 children and adoles-
cents and 69,382 adults aged 18 years and older, including 10,382
older adults (age Z 65 years) with existing obesity status. Among
the obese, there was a significantly higher proportion of females,
blacks, Hispanics, individuals in lower household income level
(o125% federal poverty line), only high school or equivalent
degree holder, those who were married, individuals with public
insurance, and those living in the South region, compared with
the nonobese. Also, as expected, individuals with obesity have a
higher number of obesity-related comorbidity conditions than do
those without obesity.
Effect of different target populations
For children/adolescents, regardless of different statistical mod-
els and confounding factor adjustment, there was no significant
difference between costs of the nonobese and the obese, except
only one scenario with a one-part GLM controlling for all
confounding factors available (no comorbidities and smoking)
that reported $1085 ($92–$2377) for the incremental costs of
obesity
for
children/adolescents.

 population, the incremental costs of obesity were significantly
higher than for the nonobese. Among adults, in most of the
combinations with statistical models and confounding factors,
the incremental costs of obesity for older adults (age Z 65 years)
were significantly higher than those for adults aged 18 to 65 years
(Fig. 2 and Table 4). From the EEE model controlling for demo-
graphic, socioeconomic, and additional factors (cov1 þ cov2 þ
cov3), the incremental costs of obesity for adults aged 18 to 65
years were reported as $1094 ($859–$1359) while the costs of
obesity for older adults were $2668 ($978–$4418).
Effect of different statistical models
Medical care costs attributable to obesity did not differ signifi-
cantly by using different statistical models, although the GoF
tests showed that an EEE model fitted the data most thoroughly,
followed by a one-part GLM. For all adults, controlling for
demographic and socioeconomic and additional factors (cov1 þ
cov2 þ cov3), the EEE model reported $1343 ($1076–$1621) for the
incremental costs of obesity, whereas the estimates ranged from
$1261 ($950–$1561) in the log-linear model to $1481 ($1186–$1754)
in the two-part GLM (Fig. 2; Table 4). Also, compared with other
models, the EEE model provided the most stable estimates over
the different sets of confounding factor adjustment, varying only
from $1346 with cov1 to $1356 with cov1 þ cov2 to $1343 with
cov1 þ cov2 þ cov3.
Confounding factor adjustment
For children, regardless of statistical models, the point estimates
of the incremental costs of obesity were increased as we adjusted
with more sets of possible confounding factors (up to cov1 þ cov2
þ cov3), despite a huge CI that made those estimates statistically
insignificant. For adults, controlling for demographic, socioeco-
nomic, and additional confounding factors (cov1 þ cov2 þ cov3)
did not make any substantial impact on point estimates as well
as statistical significance. However, by controlling for ORDs (cov4)
that were available only for adults in this data set, the incre-
mental costs of obesity reduced to one-fourth to one-seventh of
the original estimates. Among all adults, the EEE model esti-
mated the costs attributable to obesity as $1343 ($1076–$1621)
controlling for all confounding factors except the comorbidity
conditions, whereas after adding obesity-related comorbidities in
the model the estimates were decreased to $209 (�$21 to $434),
which was statistically insignificant, compared with the costs of
the nonobese (Fig. 2; Table 4).
Discussion
This article provided a systematic review and meta-analysis of
the 12 recently published articles that reported the medical care
costs associated with obesity, and also performed an original
analysis to understand the impact of study methodology on the
magnitude of these estimates. From the meta-analysis, the
pooled estimate of annual medical costs attributable to obesity
was $1901 ($1239–$2582) in 2014 USD, accounting for $149.4
billion at the national level. The extremely high heterogeneity
score from the meta-analysis signified the presence of hetero-
geneity between different studies due to the use of different data
sets from multiple time periods, various statistical methods, and
adjustment for a wide range of confounding factors to estimate
the costs. Compared with the findings from the previously
conducted systematic review that reported the incremental costs
of obesity as $2046 (2014 USD) [13], the estimate from this
analysis is very comparable.

 variability of the estimates in this analysis. However, we caution
that this analysis does not endorse that any statistical model can
be used in estimating highly skewed cost data. Ignoring the
nature of cost data and misspecification of statistical models
may lead to inefficient or sometimes biased estimates [32,33]. For
all adults, controlling for the demographic and socioeconomic
and additional factors (cov1 þ cov2 þ cov3), the EEE model, which
had the best GoF among all models based on the GoF tests,
reported $1343 ($1076–$1621) for the incremental costs of obesity.
This result provides that the estimate of the national medical
care costs attributable to obesity would be $94.3 billion ($75.6–
$113.2 billion), which accounts for 3.8% (2.8%–4.3%) of national
health expenditures in 2010 [35]. This estimate of medical costs
attributable to obesity from the empirical analysis was lower
than the pooled estimate from the meta-analysis. The reporting
error in the BMI measure through self-reported height and weight
is likely to bias the coefficient estimates, although the direction of
bias is not clear. Also, the possibility of omitting unobserved
confounders or reverse causality of obesity on medical costs is
likely to underestimate the true costs attributable to obesity. The
IV approach by Cawley et al. could address these problems using
a weight of biological relative as an instrument. The estimate
from the IV approach, however, may not be generalizable to the
entire population because of the restriction of the study popula-
tion to only adults aged 20 to 64 years with biological children
aged 11 to 20 years.
The two most significant drivers of variability in the cost
estimates were age groups and adjustment for obesity-related
comorbid condition. First, as expected, there is no significant
difference in costs attributable to obesity in children/adolescence
population because of the presence of very few ORDs that may
take a long time to develop among children. In contrast, the
incremental costs of obesity were significantly higher than those
for the nonobese for the adult population, and the older pop-
ulation reported significantly higher costs associated with obesity
than did adults aged 18 to 65 years. However, because we
included obesity-related comorbidity as a confounding factor in
the model, the medical costs of obesity were not significantly
higher that the costs among the nonobese. These findings
confirmed that most, if not all, of the costs attributable to obesity
are mainly caused by ORDs, and as age increases, the obese
population is more likely to develop ORDs, incurring higher costs
of obesity for the older population.
The main limitation of estimating costs attributable to obesity
is the lack of distinction between costs of obesity caused by ORDs
and costs of obesity care itself. If the ORDs are caused by the
obesity, then by controlling for them, it estimates only the
“partial” effect of obesity alone on the cost. However, by omitting
such comorbidities as covariates, it estimates the “total effect” of
obesity directly on cost and indirectly through mediators, the
ORDs. Although the “partial” effect of obesity alone on medical
costs was represented by the estimates controlling for ORDs
(cov4) in my analysis, which were not significantly different from
costs of the nonobese, the true “total effect” of obesity on costs is
not easy to estimate, because the regression model could not
capture the true counterfactual costs of obesity by just omitting
comorbidities as covariates, ignoring the presence of ORDs in the
nonobese population. Future study needs to be directed at
estimating true counterfactual costs related to the absence/
presence of obesity and ORDs.
After recognizing obesity as a disease, a national survey found
that survey participants are more likely to support the disease
classification of obesity, and they believe that this change would
bring more attention to weight changes and more access to obesity
treatment [36]. However, a recent evaluation of adherence to
national obesity clinical practice guidelines found the lack of
increase in documentation of diagnosis and planned management
of obesity patients [37]. Thus, recognizing obesity as a disease may
not lead to immediate changes in health care utilization or
significant policy changes. However, what we can do is produce
better evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of obesity
treatment through future research. Then, better research alone
will increase obesity treatment and reduce the burden of illness,
and we hope the overall medical expenditure will be expected to
decrease in the long run as we make more diligent efforts to fight
against the obesity epidemic. (We appreciate valuable insights
from an anonymous reviewer and David Arterburn.)
However, the utility of published estimates for the medical
costs of obesity should be examined carefully, because of their
wide variation, and the estimates should be applied cautiously in
future research and health policy making.
