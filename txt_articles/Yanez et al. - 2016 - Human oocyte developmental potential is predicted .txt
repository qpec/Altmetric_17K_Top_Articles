Human oocyte developmental potential is
predicted by mechanical properties within hours
after fertilization

The causes of embryonic arrest during pre-implantation development are poorly understood.
Attempts to correlate patterns of oocyte gene expression with successful embryo
development have been hampered by the lack of reliable and nondestructive predictors of
viability at such an early stage. Here we report that zygote viscoelastic properties can predict
blastocyst formation in humans and mice within hours after fertilization, with 490%
precision, 95% specificity and 75% sensitivity. We demonstrate that there are significant
differences between the transcriptomes of viable and non-viable zygotes, especially in
expression of genes important for oocyte maturation. In addition, we show that low-quality
oocytes may undergo insufficient cortical granule release and zona-hardening, causing altered
mechanics after fertilization. Our results suggest that embryo potential is largely determined
by the quality and maturation of the oocyte before fertilization, and can be predicted through
a minimally invasive mechanical measurement at the zygote stage.

 I
t has been suggested that an embryo’s fate is determined very
early in development, before embryonic genome activation
(EGA),
or
even
before
fertilization1–3.
Before
EGA
no
transcription occurs, and so the very first steps of embryogenesis
are controlled exclusively by maternal information inherited from
the oocyte1–3. The major wave of transcription involved in EGA is
observed at the one-cell zygote to the two-cell stage in mouse4 and
the four- to eight-cell stage in humans5. In humans, various oocyte
morphological characteristics6 have been correlated with embryo
development
and
implantation
potential,
including
zona
thickness7, granularity8, perivitelline space9 and oocyte shape10.
However, these criteria are highly subjective, and their predictive
value is controversial11. Without a reliable predictor of embryo
viability
before
EGA,
it
is
still
unclear
to
what
extent
developmental potential is determined by the oocyte.
The mechanisms of developmental failure in embryos resulting
from poor-quality oocytes are also largely unknown. Some studies
have begun to explore differences at the level of transcription
between high- and poor-quality oocytes by inferring quality from
maternal age12,13 or ploidy14. However, these measures of oocyte
quality can only identify a subpopulation of all non-viable oocytes
because chromosomal abnormalities can arise after this stage, and
maternal age is not a perfect predictor of viability. An accurate
and nondestructive predictor of viability before EGA would allow
us a global view of deficiencies in the oocyte transcriptome, which
can lead an embryo to arrest.
In recent years, studies have shown that mechanical inputs play
a major role in regulating cell fate and function at the molecular
level15, and a cell’s internal state may also be reflected in its
mechanical properties16,17. In mouse and human embryos,
cortical granule release during fertilization causes a physical
change in stiffness, which is called ‘zona-hardening’18, a process
previously described only biochemically. The response of the
oocyte membrane to needle puncture during intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) was found to be predictive of embryo
morphology and survival in culture19,20. Embryo and oocyte
stiffnesses have also been correlated to pregnancy in humans, and
to maternal age in mouse, indicating that there may be a link
between mechanics and viability21–23.
In this study, we report a set of mechanical parameters that can
be measured nondestructively within hours after fertilization and
can identify human zygotes destined to arrest, with 490%
precision, 95% specificity and 75% sensitivity (Fig. 1). Using these
parameters to stratify embryos by viability, we identify important
genes and pathways that play key roles in pre-implantation
embryo development, most of which are reflective of oocyte
nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, DNA repair and cellular
stress response. We also show that patterns of gene expression
found in non-viable embryos may affect cortical granule release
and zona-hardening, which helps to explain the link between
embryo viability and mechanical properties.
Results
Zygote mechanical parameters predict blastocyst formation.
A total of 89 two-pronuclear (2PN)-stage human zygotes from
successful in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles were thawed.
We measured their mechanical parameters within 3 h after
thawing, and tracked their development over 5–6 days using a
time-lapse microscope (Eeva System from Auxogyn), with images
taken every 5 min. Those forming blastocysts were designated as
viable. Micropipette aspiration was chosen to probe embryo
mechanical properties because it is minimally invasive, can be
performed quickly and has been extensively used to study the
viscoelastic properties of cells24,25. An image of a mouse zygote
undergoing aspiration is shown in Fig. 2a. The four-parameter
bulk mechanical model we used to model the embryo is shown in
Fig. 2b; it is a Zener26 model with an extra viscous element added
in series. A sample plot of the pressure applied into the pipette
(step function) along with the aspiration depth of the embryo
over time and its fit to the mechanical model is shown in Fig. 2c.
Figure 2d shows box plots of three of the four parameters
(in order of usefulness in separating non-viable from viable
embryos: k1, Z1, k0, with Z1 log-transformed). The interquartile
range for viable embryo parameters is smaller than that of
non-viable embryos, except for the fourth parameter (Z0,
Supplementary Fig. 1). A scatter plot of the three parameters
from Fig. 2d is shown in Fig. 2e. While the individual parameters
in Fig. 2d provide limited predictive value on their own, when
plotted together the majority of viable embryos cluster in one
region of the scatter plot (k1 ¼ 0.30 N m � 1, Z1 ¼ 0.59 N s m � 1
and k0 ¼ 0.12 N m � 1), and there is no ‘typical’ non-viable
embryo. Figure 2f contains typical images of embryos from
Fig. 2e and shows that viable and non-viable embryos are
morphologically
nearly
indistinguishable

this
stage
in
development, but have distinct mechanical parameters. Using

 the data from Fig. 2e, we trained a support-vector machine
(SVM) classifier to determine the optimal decision boundary
between viable and non-viable embryos based on those mechan-
ical parameters, and performed feature selection to determine
that three parameters (again k1, Z1 and k0) provided optimal
predictive value (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves are shown
in Supplementary Fig. 2A,B. When using our classifier to predict
human embryo blastocyst formation based on their mechanical
properties, the area under the ROC curve is 0.87 and the area
under the PR curve is 0.86, which corresponds to 490%
precision, 95% specificity and 75% sensitivity.
Once we determined that our mechanical parameters could
reliably predict viability at the zygote stage, we compared their
performance to other parameters that are commonly used to
predict embryo viability at an early stage. For all 89 human
zygotes, we extracted cell cycle parameters by measuring time
intervals
between
the
key
cleavage
stages
(Supplementary
Fig. 3A,B). We observed that time (in hours) (i) of duration of
first cytokinesis (c1), (ii) between the first and second mitosis (c2)
and (iii) between second and third mitoses (c3) were (c1 ¼ 0.20,
c2 ¼ 11.32,
c3 ¼ 2.91)
for
embryos
that
developed
to
the
blastocyst stage (31 out of 89), which overlaps with previous
reports27. Embryos that arrested had a widely varying set of
parameters. When these three parameters were used to predict
blastocyst formation, the sensitivity and specificity were 85% and
88%, respectively, with AUCROC of 0.95 and AUCPR of 0.91.
Although mechanical parameters alone have slightly lower
predictive power compared with cell cycle parameters at the
four-cell stage, they currently represent the most effective method
of predicting viability before the embryo reaches three to four
cells. In particular, at the zygote stage, only mechanical
parameters can provide information about embryo viability,
and an additional 48 h in culture is required for time-lapse
parameters to surpass their predictive power (Supplementary
Fig. 3D). Mechanical parameters can also improve on the
predictive value of cell cycle parameters alone (Supplementary
Fig. 2A,B); the optimal combination of mechanical and cell cycle

 parameters (k1, Z1, c1 and c2) can achieve a sensitivity and
specificity of 90 and 91%, with AUCROC of 0.97 and AUCPR of
0.94 (Supplementary Fig. 2D, four-cell stage).
Zygote mechanical parameters also predict live birth in mouse.
We investigated whether embryo mechanical properties were
predictive of development to term in vivo in addition to blastocyst
formation in vitro using mouse as a model. A classifier was first
made for predicting mouse embryo viability as it was made
for the human embryos. Briefly, we measured the mechanical
properties of a total of 282 mouse zygotes at the 2PN stage and
then cultured them in vitro to define good or poor developmental
potential based on blastocyst development. Only embryos that
were fertilized with two polar bodies were selected for the
measurement. A scatter plot of the three most important
parameters is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. Embryos for which
we measured mechanical properties did not have significantly
different blastocyst formation rates (67%) than control embryos
(70%) (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that the measurement
does not lower mouse embryo viability (P ¼ 0.62, two-proportion
z-test). As with the human embryos, mouse embryos that reached
the blastocyst stage occupied one region of the scatter plot around
(k1 ¼ 0.17 N m � 1,
Z1 ¼ 1.3 N s m � 1
and
k0 ¼ 0.06 N m � 1),
while non-viable embryos were scattered away from the ‘average’
viable embryo. We trained an SVM classifier on the mouse
data and found that mechanical parameters could predict
blastocyst formation by the zygote stage with AUCROC of 0.85
and AUCPR of 0.92, which corresponds to a sensitivity of 76% and
a specificity of 79%.
After the classifier was validated, the mechanical parameters of
204 mouse zygotes were measured and grouped according to their
mechanical properties. A total of 55 viable and 55 non-viable
embryos were transferred to recipient female mice within 2 h after
the measurement and analysis, so that each mouse received 12–15
embryos,
which
were
either
all
viable
or
all
non-viable.
The results of the experiment are shown broken down by mouse
and experiment (four experiments total) in Supplementary
Table 1 and as a whole in Fig. 2g. Embryos classified as viable
based on mechanics were significantly (Po10 � 6, w2-test) more
likely to result in a live birth (74%) compared with embryos
classified as non-viable based on mechanics (24%), and they were
also significantly (P ¼ 0.01, w2-test) more likely to result in a live
birth than control embryos selected by morphology (49%).
This indicates that mechanical parameters are a true measure
of ultimate survival potential in mouse, and our measurement
does not affect embryo development. Although the causes of
embryonic arrest may differ between mice and humans, and thus
results in a mouse model may not always translate to humans, we
find these results encouraging. Future studies will reveal whether
mechanical properties of human embryos can also predict clinical
pregnancy and live birth.
Human zygote gene expression correlates with viability. After
validating the predictive power of our mechanical parameters, we
asked whether developmental potential is reflected at the level of
transcription, and, if so, what patterns of gene expression are
characteristic of a viable or non-viable zygote. We measured the
mechanical parameters of 22 previously frozen human zygotes at
the 2PN stage, which were classified as viable or non-viable
based on their mechanical parameters. Only embryos with
another ‘sibling’ embryo were chosen for sequencing to account
for
interpatient
variability
in
post
processing.
Single-cell
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on the 17 remaining single embryos
generated 441-Gb data with 31 million paired-end reads per
embryo (on average) with read length of 100 bp. We detected
expression
of
12,342
genes,
of
which
1,879
(15%)
were
differentially
expressed
(DE)
with
a
false
discovery
rate
(or q-value) below 1%. All ‘significant’ differences in gene
expression have q-valueo0.01 as output by the edgeR28 package
in R. Figure 3a shows hierarchical clustering of gene expression
data after removal of batch effects. As expected, embryos cluster
by predicted viability. Figure 3b shows a plot of the top three
principal components, capturing 90% of the variation in the data
set. Again, viable and non-viable embryos appear well separated,
with the first principal component capturing the majority of the
variation. The dendrogram and principal component plot
were both made based on all genes with expression values
greater than 0.5 counts per million. Figure 3c shows a scatter plot
of the log-fold change in expression between viable and
non-viable embryos plotted against the log of the expression
counts per million (c.p.m.) for each gene.
We further examined the RNA-seq data to determine which
biological processes (BPs) may have been affected by the DE
genes, and to investigate why non-viable embryos were destined
to arrest. We used the Database for Annotation, Visualization,
and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool to perform gene
ontology clustering on our list of DE genes and determine
whether any molecular functions or BPs were over-represented.
Table 1 shows a list of the 19 functional annotation clusters with
at least one component in each cluster containing an adjusted
P value (q-value) below 0.05, along with its enrichment score.
We then used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to examine
the predicted biological effects of the gene expression differences
seen between viable and non-viable embryos, and to identify
networks of co-regulated genes.
Clusters 4, 10 and 17 in Table 1 refer to processes involved in
nuclear maturation. Figure 3d contains box plots of selected genes
from these clusters that are DE between viable and non-viable
embryos. In particular, we found that non-viable embryos
have reduced expression of genes including a cyclin-dependent
kinase
(CDK1),
which
is
essential
for
mitotic
cell
cycle
regulation in mammals29, germinal vesicle breakdown and
meiosis resumption30, and was expressed twofold lower in
non-viable
embryos.
Concurrently,
we
found
a
1.3-fold
difference in the expression of CDC25B, which is indispensable
for CDK1 activation. We also found changes in expression of
many cyclins and other cyclin-dependent kinases, including
CDK2, CDK4 and CCNA2, which are all important in regulating
cell cycle and oocyte maturation. Our study also revealed
differences in expression of 73 genes involved in chromosome
segregation and ploidy status regulation. We found differences in
expression of BUB1, BUB1B, BUB3, MAD2L1, securin (PTTG1
and PTTG2), members of the anaphase-promoting complex
(ANAPC1, ANAPC4 and ANAPC11), structural maintenance of
chromosome proteins (SMC2, SMC3 and SMC4) and DNA
topoisomerases (TOP1, TOP2A and TOP2B). A meiotic marker
gene SYCP3 was also shown to be DE in non-viable embryos.
We then used IPA to predict the effect of our patterns of
differential expression on cell cycle progression and aneuploidy
prevention. The results of this analysis (Fig. 3e) indicate that
non-viable embryos have a reduced ability to carry out cell
cycle
checkpoint
control,
chromosome
alignment
and
chromosome congression (blue lines indicate that expression of
that gene agrees with the predicted effect and yellow lines indicate
that it disagrees).
Clusters 1, 7, 12 and 18 in Table 1 are related to epigenetic
modification
of
chromosomes
and
regulation
of
gene
transcription. We found significant differences in expression of
161 genes involved in chromatin remodelling, some of which are
plotted in Fig. 3d. Specifically, we found differences in expression
of DNMT3B, HDAC1, TET3 and YY1. Loss of any of these genes

 results in embryonic lethality or a higher rate of developmental
failure due to aberrant epigenetic modifications31–34. Figure 3f
shows an interaction network (Po10 � 32) calculated with IPA
that includes genes involved in chromatin modification, coloured
by the log-fold change between viable and non-viable embryos.
IPA analysis also predicted that chromatin organization and
modification activity was reduced in non-viable embryos based
on the log-fold change in gene expression we found between
viable and non-viable embryos (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Cluster 2 in Table 1 refers to the embryo’s ability to repair its
DNA, implying that DNA damage may be another possible
mechanism of embryonic arrest. We found differences in
expression of many genes involved in DNA repair and telomere
maintenance, including BRCA1, TERF1, ERCC1, XRCC6, XAB2,
RPA1 and MRE11A. IPA analysis on our data also found that
DNA
repair
was
reduced
in
our
non-viable
embryos
(Supplementary Fig. 7), and that non-viable embryos are more
likely to have poor blastocyst morphology (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Clusters 3, 8, 11, 14, 16 and 19 in Table 1 refer to protein
synthesis, modification, localization and degradation, all of which
are vital to proper cytoplasmic maturation in oocytes and proper
development after fertilization. Of these, several (ATG5, CUL3,

 USP11, USP2 and UBE2G2) are known to play vital roles in
protein ubiquitination and autophagy, and loss of function
is association with pre-implantation arrest and embryonic
lethality35–37. These results reinforce that idea that timely
degradation of maternal transcripts is vital for ensuring that
embryos can develop successfully after EGA.
Non-viable oocytes may undergo suboptimal fertilization. Our
human RNA-seq data indicated that there may be differential
expression of many genes important for fertilization between
viable and non-viable embryos (Fig. 4a). Of these, CD9, ZP3
and ZP4 are found on the egg’s plasma membrane and in its
zona pellucida (ZP), and could inhibit sperm–egg binding if
expressed incorrectly. Interestingly, we found reduced levels of
PLCZ1, an mRNA that codes for a sperm protein, in the
non-viable zygotes. We also found reduced expression in
non-viable zygotes of the IP3 receptor ITPR1, which is important
for initiating the Ca2 þ oscillations that lead to cortical granule
release and zona-hardening.
To test whether the extent of cortical granule exocytosis
accounts for differences in embryo mechanical properties, we
classified mouse zygotes as viable or non-viable based on their
mechanical properties after IVF, and then imaged the cortical
granules
remaining
within
the
cytoplasm
using
confocal
microscopy. All of the viable zygotes (n ¼ 30) had low levels of
signal, while most of the non-viable zygotes (n ¼ 37) had very
bright signal (Fig. 4b). Using a Wilcoxon rank sum test, we found
that the median value of this intensity profile was much higher in
non-viable embryos, regardless of whether they had lower
(n ¼ 24, Po10 � 6) or higher stiffness (n ¼ 13, Po10 � 5) than
viable embryos (n ¼ 30; Fig. 4c). These results suggest that
cortical granule exocytosis can influence embryo stiffness but
there are likely other factors that also explain the link between
embryo mechanics and viability.
We next microinjected oocytes (n ¼ 32) with an antibody to
the IP3 receptor (ITPR1) to block cortical granule release
and observed changes in embryo stiffness after fertilization.
We also performed sham injections on 19 control embryos.
Microinjection did not inhibit sperm penetration, as two
pronuclei could be observed in 37% of the injected and 40% of
noninjected oocytes after insemination. However, introduction of
the antibody lowered embryo stiffness from 0.143±0.022 N m � 1
for control embryos to 0.135±0.012 N m � 1 (P ¼ 0.12, Wilcoxon
rank sum test; Fig. 4d). Although injection of the antibody did
not induce a statistically significant change in the mean stiffness
(two-sided t-test), there was a statistically significant change in
the
distribution
of
stiffness
values
(P ¼ 0.03,
two-sample
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). The stiffest quartile of antibody-
injected embryos was significantly softer (P ¼ 0.03, Wilcoxon
rank sum test) and had significantly higher signal from cortical
granules (P ¼ 0.03, Wilcoxon rank sum test) compared with the
stiffest quartile of control-injected embryos, indicating less
cortical granule release (Fig. 4e). They also exhibited significantly
less cortical granule release than would be expected for a group of
embryos
with
similar
mechanical
parameters
(P ¼ 0.008,
Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fig. 4e). The softest quartile of
antibody-injected embryos appeared unaffected, as they did not
exhibit significantly different stiffness (P ¼ 0.73, Wilcoxon rank
sum test) and cortical granule release (P ¼ 0.06, Wilcoxon rank
sum test) from the softest quartile of control embryos (Fig. 4e).
We also found that oocyte stiffness falls significantly over the
course of maturation (Po10� 5 from GV to MI and Po10� 9
from MI to MII, Wilcoxon rank sum test). As oocytes mature, they
become softer; average oocyte stiffness is 0.083±0.013 N m � 1 at
the GV stage (n¼ 35), 0.070±0.008 N m � 1 at the MI stage
(n ¼ 49) and 0.056±0.013 N m � 1 at the MII stage (n ¼ 65;
Fig. 4f). Approximately 5–6 h elapsed between collection of GV
and MI oocytes, and 12–15 h elapsed between collection of MI and
MII oocytes, indicating that oocytes undergo a rapid softening after
germinal vesicle breakdown, which slows down between the MI
and MII stages. Our results imply that non-viable embryos exhibit
a diverse array of mechanical phenotypes that may reflect a
reduced capacity to complete embryogenesis. These differences in
mechanics may be caused by abnormalities in oocyte-softening and
maturation before fertilization, or in the ability to undergo cortical
granule exocytosis at the time of fertilization.
Discussion
For the first time, we have demonstrated a technique to accurately
assess human embryo viability at the 2PN stage, while the zygotic
genome is transcriptionally inactive and development is still
controlled by maternal mRNAs and proteins. The ability to
predict embryo viability at such an early stage strongly suggests
that

 determined before fertilization by the contents of the oocyte.
Although DNA fragmentation or damage in the sperm can lower
a healthy oocyte’s developmental potential, it is the oocyte that
contributes the vast majority of the cytoplasmic contents, which
are also vital for successful development. A proposed model of
embryo viability determination is shown in Fig. 5.
Many previous studies have focused on oocyte and embryo-
quality assessment, as well as understanding how embryo fate is
determined. In particular, it has been suggested that the first two
embryonic cell divisions are primarily controlled by maternal
genes38 and that, in the mouse, the first division in embryos
affects subsequent development39. Knockout experiments in

Figure 5 | Model for how embryo fate is determined and why it is detectable mechanically. Some oocytes fail to achieve optimal maturation because of
external stress during maturation, or inherent poor quality. At the time of fertilization, these oocytes (blue cytoplasm) may be overly stiff and still
immature, or they could fail to release cortical granules properly and be overly soft after fertilization. Optimally matured oocytes (green cytoplasm) will
release cortical granules into the perivitelline space, undergo the appropriate changes in mechanical properties and go on to develop successfully.

 mouse oocytes such as stella and Hsf1 have allowed identification
of
oocyte
genes,
playing
an
important
role
in
embryo
development40,41. Most recently, RNA-seq on single human
embryos revealed stage-specific transcripts and provided a
landscape of candidates that are important in mammalian
pre-implantation development27,42,43; however, very little zygote
data have been available. Our data provide a global view of
differences in the transcriptomes of zygotes of high and low
developmental potential.
We found that non-viable embryos exhibited significantly
different expression of genes controlling cell cycle progression,
including nearly all of the cyclin-dependent kinases and many of
the cyclins. These differences imply that non-viable embryos may
have trouble resuming their cell cycles following fertilization and
may help to explain why the timing of the first cell division can
predict blastocyst formation27,44. We also found that non-viable
embryos
misexpress
genes
important
in
sister
chromatid
cohesion, alignment or segregation, or in the spindle assembly
checkpoint, which may help explain the high levels of aneuploidy
seen in arrested human embryos45. Our data also indicate that,
much like aged oocytes, non-viable zygotes have significant
deficiencies
in
DNA
repair
and
telomere
maintenance.
Interestingly, even though we removed interpatient variation in
our data, we still found patterns of gene expression in our
non-viable zygotes that were similar to those of aged oocytes46,47.
Our results suggest that there is intrapatient heterogeneity in
viability, where non-viable zygotes may have ‘aged’ faster than
viable zygotes.
Our results also suggest that non-viable zygotes also have
deficiencies in cytoplasmic maturation, which may impair their
ability to switch from maternal to zygotic control and develop
successfully after fertilization. While nuclear maturation is
defined by cell cycle progression and can be easily evaluated on
a
simple
observation,
the
factors
that
define
successful
cytoplasmic maturation are still poorly characterized because of
the lack of an early predictor of viability. Reverse transcriptase–
PCR-based
and
microarray-based
analyses
on
maternal
transcripts have identified a number of genes that are expressed
in oocytes and are important for oocyte development and
maturation48,49. This study helps to better define cytoplasmic
maturation at the transcriptome level, and represents the first
insight into how maternally inherited gene expression patterns
correlate with developmental potential in zygotes originating
from MII oocytes.
Our RNA-seq data also revealed that non-viable embryos
misexpress several genes involved in fertilization, which could
impair cortical granule release and zona-hardening, thus affecting
the resulting embryo’s mechanical phenotype. In particular,
non-viable embryos show reduced expression of ITPR1, a
receptor that is involved in the signalling cascade initiated by
fertilization, and that shows an increased expression during
oocyte maturation. Insufficient levels of ITPR1 expression may
affect oocyte activation, cortical granule release and, therefore,
embryo mechanical properties. Our data suggest that there may
be at least two mechanisms for non-viable embryos to develop
different mechanical properties from viable embryos. The first
may be a failure to release cortical granules into the perivitelline
space and undergo sufficient zona-hardening, possibly caused by
misexpression of genes upstream in the fertilization-signalling
pathway as seen in the RNA-seq results. The second may be a
failure in achieving appropriate maturation before fertilization,
causing an overly stiff oocyte to become an overly stiff embryo.
These results suggest that embryo mechanical properties could
provide us with insight into the quality of oocyte maturation and
the resulting embryo’s developmental competence. Because
mouse and human embryos exhibit differences in cortical granule
synthesis
and
distribution50,
follow-up
studies
should
be
performed in human oocytes to understand the link between
oocyte
maturation,
cortical
granule
release
and
embryo
mechanical
properties.
In
the
IVF
clinic
today,
oocyte
maturation is assessed simply by looking for the lack of a
germinal vesicle and the presence of a polar body. Because we
found that oocyte mechanical properties change over the course
of maturation, further work in this area could yield a minimally
invasive measure of oocyte maturation with finer resolution than
is possible through a morphological assessment alone.
The micropipette aspiration approach we used in this study
was
simple
and
effective
in
measuring
four
mechanical
parameters, of which three were predictive of embryo viability.
One limitation of this approach is its reliance on a bulk model of
the embryo as a whole, which lacks an exact correspondence
between model parameters and embryo components. If finer
spatial resolution in measuring mechanical properties is desired,
an alternate approach should be used or more outputs should be
measured in addition to the cell aspiration depth into the
micropipette. Another potential limitation of our approach is the
potentially large (B30%) deformation applied to the embryo.
Although larger deformations are routinely applied during ICSI,
studies have shown that applying mechanical stress to cells can
alter levels of gene expression51,52, induce actin polymerization53
and even affect viability54. The mouse embryos we measured were
only deformed for a few seconds, did not exhibit lower blastocyst
formation rates and seemed to recover to their original shape
within several minutes; however, the high amount of deformation
could still have unknown effects on gene expression and future
development.
The modified Zener model used in this paper represents a bulk
measurement of the mechanical properties of the embryo as
a
whole.
Although
the
2PN
embryo
is
a
mechanically
heterogeneous structure, we can estimate its Young’s modulus
to be B0.5 kPa for mouse embryos using equation (5) from a
review on micropipette aspiration25. This value is similar to that
of cells that lack a ZP but exhibit solid-like behaviour such as
endothelial cells and chondrocytes24,55. Some recent studies have
focused on measuring the Young’s modulus of 2PN embryo
ZP and obtained values around 20–40 kPa (refs 18,22,56,57) in
mouse and 84 kPa (ref. 58) in cow. Taken together, these results
suggest that the embryo is a mechanically heterogeneous
structure consisting of a relatively soft cell surrounded by a
stiff ZP. Future studies could investigate the relative contributions
of cell and ZP mechanics to bulk embryo mechanics and
developmental potential.
Although all of the mouse embryos used in this study were
fresh,
the
human
embryos
were
previously
subjected
to
cryopreservation, which has been shown to affect zona stiffness59
and cortical granule exocytosis60. In our own data, we found that
cryopreservation does cause an immediate increase in embryo
stiffness,
but
this
effect
disappears
by
3 h
post
thaw
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Therefore, to eliminate a potential
confounding effect due to cryopreservation, we allowed all
human zygotes to recover in the incubator for 3–4 h after
thawing. It has also been suggested that ICSI and in vitro culture
conditions can affect cortical granule exocytosis and embryo
mechanical properties61,62. In this study we did not have access to
information on the fertilization method (ICSI/IVF), or culture
conditions
before
freezing,
which
may
have
lowered
the
predictive power of our human zygote viability classifier.
One of the advantages of our approach to predict embryo
viability is the applicability of our model to both mouse and
human embryos, despite their numerous differences. In addition
to lacking the same propensity for chromosome abnormalities as
human embryos, mouse embryos are different mechanically as

 well; they have a much thinner ZP for their size, and they have a
high oolemma elasticity that makes ICSI challenging63. In our
data, we found that mouse embryos have much lower stiffness
and higher viscosity than human embryos, which may help
explain why ICSI is so difficult in the mouse.
Some limitations of using SVM to construct a classifier are its
sensitivity to the box constraint c and the radial basis function
(RBF) parameter s, and its need for large amounts of training data
for high-dimensional problems. Choosing the wrong values for c
and s could lead to underfitting the data and obtaining poor
classification accuracy, or overfitting the data and being overly
sensitive to outliers. To avoid these scenarios, we employed an
optimization algorithm using 10-fold cross-validation to choose
parameter values that maximized classification accuracy and
avoided overfitting. In this study high dimensionality was not a
problem; however, if our model were expanded to include more
parameters, many more embryos would have to be measured to
effectively train a classifier. After proper parameter tuning and
training, our classifier performed quite well; although the distribu-
tions of viable versus non-viable embryos differ between mouse and
human data (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 4), we found our
classifier to be highly accurate and adaptable to both data sets
because of the use of the RBF kernel. The flexibility of our machine-
learning approach indicates that our classifier could be applied
across multiple different species, or could be further augmented
with mechanical data from oocytes or fresh human embryos.
The ability to accurately predict an embryo’s viability directly
after fertilization also has immediate applications in the IVF
clinic.
Traditionally,
embryo
selection
has
consisted
of
a
morphological assessment, which is highly subjective. The
development of non-invasive time-lapse imaging and blastocyst
culture techniques has helped to improve embryo selection and
reduce the average number of embryos transferred. However,
although cell cycle parameters are slightly more effective at
predicting blastocyst formation compared with mechanical
parameters, extended time in culture is stressful to embryos
and
can
negatively
have
an
impact
on
epigenetic
reprogramming64,65.
The
mechanical
parameters
we
have
developed promise to further improve the clinical practice of
IVF because they can be measured in a fully automated and
minimally invasive manner, as soon as fertilization is complete. In
the short term, they could be used to add predictive value to
current embryo selection techniques such as cell cycle parameters
and allow clinicians to more confidently transfer a single embryo.
However, after further validation, we expect that they could
enable the transfer of embryos directly after fertilization, allowing
embryos to begin development in their natural environment.
Because mechanical parameters can be measured at any stage of
development, our work also opens the door to better assessments
of oocyte quality and maturation, which could improve oocyte
culture, handling and fertilization rates in the clinic.
Methods
Human sample source. A total of 133 2PN-stage human embryos used in the
current study were obtained from the Stanford University RENEW Biobank,
with written informed consent that they were donated for non-stem research.
All embryos were frozen at the zygotic or 2PN stage, and it is very likely that these
embryos represent the typical IVF population, since they were not selected
before cryopreservation. De-identification was conducted in compliance with the
protocol ‘The RENEW Biobank’, which was approved by the Stanford University
Institutional Review Board. No protected health information was associated
with the embryos. Of the 133 embryos thawed, 91 appeared alive after thawing,
and the rest were excluded because they were visibly not viable (before any
micropipette aspiration). Two more embryos were excluded from our data because
they were structurally damaged during micropipette aspiration and because of ZP
rupture, leaving us with 89 total human embryos in our data set. These 89 human
embryos were thawed and measured in smaller groups over the course of six
separate experiments.
Human embryo culture. Human embryos were thawed using a Quinn’s
Advantage Thaw Kit (CooperSurgical) as described before26,27. In brief, cryovials
or straws were removed from the liquid nitrogen tank and exposed to air before
being placed in a 37�C water bath. Once thawed, embryos were incubated in 0.5
and 0.2 M sucrose thawing medium at 37 �C for 10 min each. The embryos were
then washed in thaw diluent solution at 37 �C and cultured for 3–4 h in Quinn’s
advantage cleavage medium (CooperSurgical) supplemented with 10% serum
protein substitute (CooperSurgical). In some experiments, embryos were
monitored for their development using the Eeva System (Auxogyn).
Mouse embryo and oocyte collection and IVF. Hybrid strain (C57B6xDBA2)
F1 mice (4–6-week-old females) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and
maintained in the animal facility in the Lorry Lokey Stem Cell Research Building.
All experiments were performed under Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee protocol #16146, which was approved by the Administrative Panel
on Laboratory Animal Care at Stanford University. Briefly, female mice were
superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 10IU pregnant mare serum
gonadotrophin (PMSG, Sigma) 10IU human chorionic gonadotrophin
(hCG, Sigma). After mating one female with an 8–10-week-old male of the same
strain, cumulus–oocyte complexes were collected from oviducts into M2 media
(Millipore) and cumulus cells were removed in Hyaluronidase (Sigma) and washed
in M2 media. After mechanical measurements, the embryos were cultured in
Quinn’s advantage cleavage medium (CooperSurgical) with 10% serum protein
substitute (CooperSurgical). To measure the effect of oocyte maturation on
mechanics, oocytes were collected at various stages of maturation. GV oocytes were
collected 48 h after injection of PMSG. Approximately 48 h after PMSG injection,
hCG was injected. MI oocytes were collected 5–6 h after hCG injection, and MII
oocytes were collected 18–20 h after hCG injection.
Embryos were excluded from our data if they showed very poor morphology, if
they came from mice that produced fewer than 10 embryos or if they were in a
group where fewer than 40% of embryos showed pronucleus formation after IVF. If
the mice produced too few embryos or fertilization rates were too low, we deemed
that some parts of the experimental protocol (hormone injection, media, and so
on) must have negatively affected the embryos and thus they might not be
representative of normal mouse embryos. To sort embryos into control and
measurement groups, they were randomly separated while being viewed under low
enough magnification that morphology was difficult to distinguish. Only a few
embryos were kept as negative controls in each an experiment, summing to a total
of 35 over all experiments (Supplementary Fig. 5). Sample sizes for animal
experiments were determined in part by the amount of data needed to reach
statistical significance, and in part by sample sizes seen in publications with similar
research. Mechanical and blastocyst formation data for the 282 mouse embryos we
measured (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5) were collected over the
course of 15 separate experiments.
Microinjection of mouse oocytes and IVF. A CBA mouse strain from Jackson
Laboratory was used in this experiment. After induced superovulation of
4–6-week-old female mice, metaphase-II-arrested oocytes were collected
and cumulus cells removed. Oocytes were then microinjected with B10 pl of
monoclonal antibody 18A10 (abCam) at a concentration of 1 mg ml � 1. Some
oocytes were kept as negative controls and underwent either sham injection with
water or no injection at all. The oocytes were then cultured for an hour
before conventional IVF. Sperms were collected from 8–10-week-old CBA males
(Jackson Laboratory) and allowed to capacitate in HTF media (CooperSurgical) for
45 min before insemination. An appropriate amount of the sperm suspension was
added to the media drop where oocytes were cultured. No samples were excluded
from this experiment, and oocytes were sorted into control versus measured groups
without regard for morphology and in a random order.
Measurement of embryo mechanical properties. An automated micropipette
aspiration system was used to measure the embryos, and a custom-built light
microscope was used to record video of the aspiration. The light microscope was
built with parts from Thorlabs, and it uses a � 20, 0.4 numerical aperture Olympus
objective and white light-emitting diode illumination. To conduct a measurement,
each embryo is placed in its own drop of media and the micropipette is lowered
into the drop. The embryo is manipulated with the pipette so that the polar body is
facing away from the pipette opening. Failing to control for the measurement
position could confound our results, since there is a space between the oolemma
and ZP close to the polar body, while this perivitelline space is much smaller
around the rest of the embryo. Studies have also shown that oocyte cortical tension
is polarized with respect to the meiotic spindle66; therefore, we took care to
measure the end of the embryo opposite the polar body, which is usually close to
the spindle.
Micropipettes for measuring mouse embryos had 40-mm inner diameter
(Origio MBB-FP-L-15); those for human embryos had 70-m inner diameter and
were custom-made by Origio. A holding pressure of � 0.03 p.s.i. is applied to hold
the embryo and seal the pipette opening. Then, a step pressure of � 0.345 p.s.i. is
applied to the embryo. The desired pressure is applied using a closed-loop PID
control system. A linear actuator (Firgelli L12) moves the stopper of a 1-ml syringe,

9
 and a sensor (Honeywell SSCSNBN010NDAA5) measures the pressure. These are
connected to a computer via an Arduino Uno microcontroller that can relay sensor
readings and give commands to the actuator in real time. A video of the aspiration
is recorded at 75 f.p.s. using a CMOS camera (Thorlabs DCC1545M). All hardware
are controlled using the custom-made Labview software (National Instruments).
An automated custom-made Matlab programme (Mathworks) was used to extract
the aspiration depth of embryo and fit it to a mechanical model. Canny edge
detection and thresholding were used to identify pipette corner and opening.
Cross-correlation-based template matching was used to automatically track
embryo edge over time to remove bias from manual measurements. During the
measurement of embryo mechanical parameters, the investigator was blinded to
whether they survived to the blastocyst stage or not, or to which group they
belonged (in the case of the microinjection experiments).
Mechanical model of one-cell embryos. A modified linear elastic solid model
(modified Zener model) was used to represent the embryo as it was aspirated into
the micropipette. Assuming a step input for the force applied to the embryo, the
equation for aspiration depth over time is:

models such as the Maxwell, Kelvin-Voigt and Zener (Standard Linear Solid) based
on visual inspection of the response dynamics. We observed in our experiments
that an embryo’s response to a step pressure input was an instant elongation
followed by an exponential decay component (inverted so the deformation
increased over time), finally followed by deformation at a constant rate as shown in
Fig. 2c.
A Maxwell body consists of a spring and dashpot in series; therefore, its
response to a step pressure is an instant elongation followed by a steady linear
deformation. Because our data displayed a clear exponential component, this
model was deemed insufficient to describe our system. A Kelvin-Voigt body
consists of a spring and dashpot in parallel; therefore, its response to a step pressure
is a decaying exponential where the aspiration depth settles on a final maximum
depth. This model fails to capture the instant elongation experienced by the
embryo as well as the linear rate of deformation after the exponential component
settles. The Zener model adds an extra spring in parallel to the Maxwell body and
its response to pressure is similar to that of a Kelvin-Voigt body, but with an
instant elongation when the pressure is first applied. Still, this model required the
addition of an extra dashpot in series with the other three components to
accurately capture the linear deformation experienced by the embryo after the
exponential component settled.
A comparison of the fitting error for five different models is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 10. Our model (which has 4 parameters) appears appropriate
because its error is nearly as low as the error of the five-parameter model, with or
without the unnecessary extra parameter. We therefore believe our model
accurately describes the data without overfitting.
Assessment of embryo viability and cell cycle parameters. Blastocyst forma-
tion was used as a proxy for viability when constructing a classifier to distinguish
between viable and non-viable embryos based on mechanics. This classifier was
validated in mouse as shown by the live birth experiments in Fig. 2. After embryo
mechanical parameters were measured on day 1, embryos were cultured for 5–6
days inside the Auxogyn Eeva system, with frames captured every 5 min. Cell cycle
parameters27 were extracted from the resulting videos, and embryos forming
blastocysts by day 5 (mouse) or day 6 (human) were categorized as viable.
Embryo viability prediction. Blastocyst survival was used as ground truth infor-
mation for training a classifier to predict embryo viability based on day 1 mechanical
measurements. A binary SVM classifier with a RBF kernel was trained on embryo
mechanical parameters. Optimal values for the box constraint (c) and RBF sigma (s)
were chosen using 10-fold cross-validation. Once the optimal SVM parameters were
determined, 100 Monte Carlo simulations of 10-fold cross-validation were
performed to calculate the average area under the ROC curve and PR curve.
Because a total of four mechanical parameters were measured for each embryo,
forward feature selection was conducted to determine the optimal number of
parameters to include in our viability classifier. The results of this process are
shown in Supplementary Fig. 2C, demonstrating that there is a large improvement
when using two parameters instead of one, and a slight improvement when adding
a third parameter. Using all four parameters reduces the effectiveness of our
classifier because the fourth parameter is not useful in separating embryos by
viability but adds an extra dimension to the data.
To conduct forward feature selection, first each parameter was used on its own
to separate embryos and an optimal classifier was found. As described above,
10-fold cross-validation was conducted to estimate the area under the ROC curve
for that parameter. Once the parameter with the highest predictive value was
chosen, a new classifier was trained and optimized using each of the remaining
parameters. The parameter that caused the highest improvement in predictive
value was added to the classifier, and the process was repeated until there were no
parameters remaining.
For the experiments on cortical granule release, figures were shown using only
the parameter most predictive of viability (stiffness, k1) for simplicity. The
previously trained three-parameter classifier was used to sort embryos by viability,
but we determined the figures to be clearest when using stiffness only.
Mouse live birth experiments. CD1 female mice were purchased from Jackson
Laboratory and mated with vasectomized males to serve as pseudopregnant
recipients. Mice were kept at the same condition as those used for embryo
collection. The mechanical parameters of embryos collected from (C57B6xDBA2)
F1 mice were measured and the embryos were sorted into viable or non-viable
groups based on these parameters. In each experiment, an equal number of one-cell
stage mouse embryos (range from 10 to 15) were transferred into the oviduct of a
recently plugged embryo recipients. This experiment was repeated four times
(Supplementary Table 1) with 10–15 embryos transferred to each mouse in each
experiment. The technician transferring the embryos was blinded to which
embryos were in which group. The same number of embryos at the same
developmental stage were randomly chosen and transferred to pseudopregnant
mice as a control. The pups were expected on day 20 following surgery. A w2-test
was performed to test whether the difference in number of pups born in each group
(viable, non-viable or control) was statistically significant.
RNA-seq sample preparation. Two separate experiments were conducted with a
total of 32 2PN human embryos to obtain samples for RNA-seq. The embryos were
allowed to recover for 3–4 h in culturing media after thawing and the mechanical
parameters were measured. Each embryo was classified as viable or non-viable
based on its mechanical parameters. cDNA from each embryo was synthesized
from total RNA using the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA kit (Clontech) according to
the provider’s protocol. After Covaris shearing of full-length cDNA, final libraries
were generated using the NEBNext DNA Sample Prep Master Mix Set
(New England Biolabs) and subjected to quality control with an Agilent 2100
bioanalyser. The resulting samples were then submitted for single-cell RNA-seq on
an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using the 100-bp paired-end sequencing strategy.
Out of 25 embryos chosen for sequencing, three embryos were excluded because
of technical difficulties (no RNA recovered). We submitted a total of 22 embryos
for sequencing, which were classified as viable or non-viable based on mechanical
parameters.
RNA-seq data processing. Sequencing returned B1 billion paired-end reads of
length 101 belonging to 22 embryos total. Raw sequence data in fastq format were
passed through quality control to remove low-quality base calls and adapter
sequences (FastX trimmer and clipper). The filtered sequences were then aligned to
the reference human genome (hg18) with the STAR aligner tool67 on a computer.
The resulting .bam files were filtered for alignment quality, sorted and PCR
duplicates removed (SAMtools sort and rmdup). Counts per gene were then
calculated using HTSeq-count68 and comparing the aligned reads to the reference
human transcriptome.
To account for possible batch effects arising from biological variation between
patients, different freezing protocols, culture media or other factors, we had
to determine which embryos came from which patients. We analysed sequence
variants in the transcriptomes of each embryo, and performed hierarchical
clustering on the variants for which we had good sequencing coverage
(Supplementary Fig. 11). We determined that of the 22 embryos sequenced, 17 had
‘sibling’ embryos, while 5 were the only embryos from their respective patients. We
excluded those five, and then used the ComBat function in the sva69,70 package in
R to remove batch effects from the RNA-seq data from the remaining 17 embryos.
Although excluding the five embryos without siblings may have biased our results,
it would have been impossible to estimate biological variation within those patients
using only one sample and therefore we had to exclude them. After the removal of
these batch effects, our data reflected differences in maternally inherited transcripts
between viable and non-viable embryos consistent across all patients. Differential
expression analysis was conducted on the adjusted data using the R package
edgeR28. Genes with q-values (P values adjusted by the Benjamini–Hochberg
method) less than 0.01 were classified as statistically significant.
Gene ontology and network analysis. The list of DE genes with q-valueso0.01
was passed into DAVID tool (NCBI), and clustering was performed with ontology
terms related to BPs and molecular functions (MFs). Clusters with at least one term
with an adjusted P valueo0.05 were deemed statistically significant and included
in Table 1. Terms within each cluster were combined into a single descriptive
phrase and included in Table 1. Further gene ontology analysis was conducted with
the goseq and GO.db packages in R. All gene ontology categories with at least 10
genes were ranked in order of the percentage of genes DE within that category, and
compared with the proportion of genes DE across all categories.

 IPA was used to analyse the list of DE genes along with the log-fold change
between viable and non-viable embryos. A core analysis was conducted to find
cellular processes that were predicted to be significantly increased or decreased
based on gene expression changes as well as networks of genes that were regulated
as a group.
Cortical granule staining. The mechanical parameters of embryos from B6 mice
and embryos from IVF (from CBA mice) were measured at the zygote stage in two
separate experiments. The embryos were classified as viable or non-viable based on
their mechanical parameters, and then ZP was removed by briefly exposing
embryos to Tyrode’s solution (Sigma) followed by three washes in PBS
(Invitrogen). Denuded embryos were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min at room temperature and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled
Lectin antibody (Sigma) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. A Zeiss LSM510
laser-scanning confocal microscope was used for visualization and image capture.
Confocal image processing. Raw image stacks were converted to TIFF format and
custom Matlab scripts were written to extract image parameters. Contrast
adjustment was carried out on all images in each stack to account for the loss of
signal at greater imaging depths, and a projection image was calculated for each
stack. The cytoplasm of each cell was isolated by performing automatic thresh-
olding using Otsu’s method, Canny edge detection and a circle Hough transform to
detect the location and size of each cell. An intensity profile was calculated along a
path around the circumference of each cell, at 95% of the cell radius, and with
width of 10% of the cell radius. The parameters plotted in image 4 were (a) the
average and (b) s.d. of this intensity profile. The investigator was blinded to each
embryo’s mechanical parameters and group (in the case of the microinjection
experiments) while measuring cortical granule parameters.
Statistical tests. A w2-test was used to test whether the proportion of embryos
resulting in live birth (section 2.2) was significantly different between the three
experimental groups (predicted viable based on mechanics, predicted non-viable
based on mechanics and control-sorted only by morphology). The only assumption
made by this test is that no group (a ‘group’ refers to either embryos resulting in live
birth, or embryos not resulting in live birth) contains less than five samples. This
assumption is met for both comparisons that were performed (viable versus control,
viable versus non-viable).
To determine genes with significant differences in expression between viable
and non-viable human embryos, the sva and edgeR packages in R were used. These
packages have been well validated for use in removing batch effects and
determining significant differences in expression for RNA-seq data.
A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare cortical granule brightness
between embryos (a t-test was not used because samples had low numbers and
were not normally distributed according to the Lilliefors test). To determine
whether injection of the IP3 antibody changed the mean embryo stiffness, a two-
sided t-test was used because the antibody-injected and control-injected groups
were determined to be normally distributed using the Lilliefors test. A two-sample
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to show that the injection of the antibody
caused a significant change in the distribution of stiffness values. Wilcoxon rank
sum tests were used to compare differences between quartiles of the antibody-
injected and control-injected groups because there were very few samples in each
quartile. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were also used to test the difference in the
median values of oocyte stiffness between the GV, MI and MII stages because the
stiffness values did not meet the criteria for normality.
