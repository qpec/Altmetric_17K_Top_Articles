SUMMARY
Objective: This study examines medication adherence among women with epilepsy
via use of an electronic diary, as part of a prospective multicenter observational study
designed to evaluate fertility in women with epilepsy (WWE) versus age-matched
controls.
Methods: WWE and healthy age-matched controls, seeking pregnancy, were given an
iPod Touch using a customized mobile application (the WEPOD App) for daily data
tracking. Eighty-six WWE tracked seizures and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Tracking of
nonepilepsy medications was optional. Diary data were counted from enrollment date
until date of delivery, or up to 12 months if pregnancy was not achieved. Each day that
subjects reported missing one or more AED was counted as nonadherence. Because
adherence can only be determined in women who track consistently, we elected to
include adherence data only for women who tracked >80% of days in the study.
Results: Approximately 75% of WWE tracked >80% of days and were included in medi-
cation adherence data analysis. In this group, medication adherence rate was 97.71%;
44% of women admitted to missing an AED on at least 1 day. Among the subgroup of
WWE who recorded nonepilepsy medications, AED adherence rate was 98.56%, ver-
sus 93.91% for non-AEDs.
Significance: The 75% compliance rate with an electronic diary suggests that it may be
useful to track medication adherence in future studies and in the clinical setting. In
those who tracked, the observed medication adherence rate was considerably higher
than the 75% adherence rate seen in previous epilepsy studies. This might be explained
in part by selection bias, but may also result from properties of the diary itself (daily
reminders, real time feedback given to the provider). Women reported a higher rate
of adherence to AEDs than to other prescribed medications and supplements, suggest-
ing that perceived importance of medications likely influences medication adherence,
and warrants future study.
KEY WORDS: Medication adherence, Pregnancy, Electronic diary, Epilepsy.
Epilepsy lends itself well to the study of medication adher-
ence in that it is a chronic, often lifelong illness with a rela-
tively frequent and measurable primary outcome (seizures),
in contrast to other chronic diseases such as hypertension,
which may or may not lead to an associated negative out-
come such as stroke. Failure to take epilepsy medications as
prescribed may lead to severe consequences.1 Yet, despite
the dangers associated with adherence failure, previous stud-
ies have shown that patients with epilepsy are only about
75% adherent to antiepileptic drug (AED) regimens.2,3 One

FULL-LENGTH ORIGINAL RESEARCH
 nonadherence and the consequences of nonadherence, are
women with epilepsy (WWE) who are pregnant.4 Women
may elect not to take AEDs because they are nauseated, and
unable to ingest medication, or because they are worried that
medication will injure the fetus.5 Unfortunately, if nonadher-
ence leads to seizure breakthroughs, the consequences may
be felt by both mother and baby.
Barriers to medication adherence in epilepsy and moni-
toring of medication adherence present a tremendous chal-
lenge to clinicians and to clinical researchers. Poor
adherence has been shown to negatively impact healthcare
spending by resulting in more emergency room visits and
hospitalizations,6 and may result in incomplete seizure con-
trol and increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epi-
lepsy (SUDEP).7,8 Pregnant women with epilepsy may have
a higher risk of death, and this may relate to nonadherence
to medication.9 Although incompletely understood, it is
thought that AED adherence is affected by multiple factors,
including the sporadic nature of epilepsy symptoms, the
lack of immediate consequences of missing doses, and the
variable seizure frequency within each patient’s disease
course.10 In addition, patients with epilepsy often have cog-
nitive and memory impairments associated with their dis-
ease, which may add to medication errors.
The Women with Epilepsy: Pregnancy Outcomes and
Delivery (WEPOD) trial is a four-center prospective obser-
vational study designed to evaluate fertility among WWE
compared to a group of age-matched controls. Trial partici-
pants use a specially designed electronic diary mobile appli-
cation that provides an opportunity to examine medication
adherence among this group of WWE. WEPOD participants
were given a mobile device (an iPod Touch), and taught to
use a mobile application (The WEPOD App) to track men-
strual cycles and sexual activity, and for WWE, to also track
seizures and daily medication use. Some of these women
also tracked use of nonepilepsy medications, which con-
sisted primarily of folic acid and prenatal vitamins. The
mobile application gives the participants a daily reminder to
enter data, and data are stored centrally, allowing research-
ers to monitor use on a regular basis. There is limited litera-
ture addressing the utility of electronic diaries for tracking
medication adherence. Most previous studies on medication
adherence have used either traditional paper diaries, or med-
ication event monitor systems (MEMS), which involve a
microprocessor installed in the lid of a pill bottle. The
MEMS cap device is a useful research tool, but is not practi-
cal for routine clinical use.11 We used the data from the
WWE enrolled in our study to determine whether an elec-
tronic diary was successful in tracking medication adher-
ence, and to assess adherence prior to and during pregnancy
in our enrolled patients.
Methods
WWE and healthy age-matched controls, seeking preg-
nancy, were enrolled within 6 months of contraceptive dis-
continuation. WEPOD participants were given a mobile
device (an iPod Touch) and trained to use a customized
mobile application (the WEPOD App) for daily data track-
ing. All subjects and controls were given the option of using
paper diaries instead of the electronic application, but only
one (control patient) chose this option. Participants in both
groups were given daily “pop-up” reminders to enter data.
The WEPOD App is a personalized diary that includes men-
strual cycle and sexual activity logs for all participants and
seizure and medication diaries for WWE (Fig. 1). The app
was prepopulated with all AEDs used by the women at
enrollment, including intended schedule of administration.
Key Points
• This study examines medication adherence among
women with epilepsy who are seeking pregnancy, via
use of an electronic tracking diary
• Seventy-five percent of women were compliant with
the electronic diary, tracking medication use on >80%
of days; these women were included in adherence
analysis
• Diary-compliant women reported high rates of AED
medication adherence (97.1%)
• Subjects who tracked both AEDs and nonepilepsy
medications reported a higher rate of adherence with
AEDs than with other medications

 Each day women could indicate use by clicking on the
appropriate icon “I took it,” “I missed it,” or “I took extra”
for each prescribed dose (see Fig. 2). There was also an
optional mood tracking option for WWE. The app is con-
nected to a cloud-based system that allows for data entry
into a cloud database, and provides continuous central data
monitoring. WWE were instructed to track AEDs, but track-
ing of other nonepilepsy medications was optional. All sub-
jects were instructed to track data daily for the duration of
time enrolled in the study; diary data were counted from
date of enrollment until date of delivery, or up to 12 months
if pregnancy was not achieved. If a day of tracking was
missed, it could be backfilled at any time.
Subjects indicated whether medications were taken at pre-
scribed times. Clicking the icon of a pill with a green check
indicated “I took it,” a pill with a red check indicated “I
missed it,” and a pill with a blue plus indicated “I took extra.”
Medication adherence data from the WWE group were
electronically reviewed and counted from each participant’s
data log. Each day on which subjects reported missing one
or more doses of AEDs was counted as nonadherence. For
the purposes of this analysis, taking an extra dose the same
day or the day after the missed dose was still considered to
be nonadherence. Days on which participants did not enter
medication data were also counted. Some WWE also chose
to record use of non-AED medications, which were counted
separately.
Because adherence can be determined only in women
who track consistently, we elected to only include adherence
data for women who tracked >80% of days in the study.
Results
Diary adherence
Ninety WWE enrolled in the study and met entry criteria.
Of these 90 women, 4 were ineligible for medication adher-
ence analysis because they were not prescribed an AED dur-
ing some or all of the days enrolled in the study. Of the
eligible 86 subjects, 66 (76.74%) tracked >80% of total pos-
sible days and were included in adherence analysis
(Table 1). Collectively, these women who were >80% com-
pliant with the diary tracked 98.91% of possible days. The
group of 20 women who tracked <80% of enrolled days in
the study collectively tracked an average of 43% of days
(median 33%), and percentage of days tracked ranged from
0% to 76%. These women reported taking AEDs as pre-
scribed on 99.66% of recorded days, and only 5 of these 20
women admitted to any missed doses of AEDs. A total of 16
women in the WWE group dropped out of the study; of these
dropouts, 6 had tracked <80% of days enrolled in the study.
Medications used
Table 2 lists the number of subjects for each AED type,
and illustrates that the majority of WWE were taking lamot-
rigine either as monotherapy or in combination with another
AED, followed by levetiracetam as the second most com-
mon agent. The majority of WWE were taking AEDs with
only b.i.d. dosing (42 of 66), with 10 of 66 taking AEDs
with only daily dosing, and the other 12 taking either AEDs
with a combination of dosing schedules or t.i.d. scheduling.
Medication adherence
Participants in the WWE group who tracked >80% of
possible days reported taking all AEDs as prescribed on
97.71% of days. Forty-four percent of patients overall had at
least 1 day recorded on which they admitted missing a dose.
The number of days on which at least one dose was missed
ranged from 0 to 98, with a mean of 6.7 days and a median
of 0. Among the diary nonadherent group, the reported per-
centage of medication adherence on days they tracked was
99.84%, with only 5 of 20 or 25% of the diary nonadherent
subgroup reporting at least 1 day on which an AED dose
was missed. For the entire group of WWE that provided any
medication data (n = 86), the overall reported percentage of
days on which AEDs were taken as prescribed was 97.76%.
Pregnancy and medication adherence
Of the 66 women studied in the medication adherence
analysis, 42 achieved pregnancy. Adherence to AEDs was
examined in this subgroup, and an overall AED adherence
rate of 98.02% was seen, which was comparable to the
97.71% adherence rate in the group as a whole. When com-
paring days during which these women were pregnant ver-
sus not yet pregnant, adherence rates were again similar,
with medications taken as prescribed on 98.03% of days
while pregnant, and 98.02% of days when not yet pregnant.

Medication Adherence in WWE Pregnancy
 Non-AED medication adherence
A subgroup of 41 of the 64 WWE included in the medica-
tion adherence analysis opted to also track non-AEDs along
with AEDs. Among women in this subgroup, overall AED
adherence rate was 98.56%. Participants recorded having
missed at least one dose of AED, while still taking non-
AEDs on 0.49% of days, and recorded missing a dose of
AED as well as at least one non-AED on 3.97% of days.
They recorded having missed at least one dose of non-
AEDs, while taking their AEDs on 3.48% of days. The over-
all adherence rate with non-AEDs among this subgroup was
93.91%, with 30% of these women reporting at least 1 day
on which they did not take a non-AED. The number of days
of reported missed doses ranged from 0 to 21, with an aver-
age of 12.2 days. These results are summarized in Table 3.
Non-AED medications recorded on an optional basis by
WWE are listed in Table 4. Only medications that were pre-
scribed to be taken on a daily basis were counted in adher-
ence analysis.
Of the 40 women tracking non-AED use, 27 became
pregnant during the study. Among women in this subgroup,

 a collective total of 288 prepregnancy days (or 3.30% of
nonpregnant days) was recorded on which one or more
doses of non-AEDs were missed, and 64 days during preg-
nancy (or 0.73% of pregnant days) were recorded on which
one or more doses of non-AEDs were missed (Table 4).
Discussion
We assessed compliance in women with epilepsy plan-
ning pregnancy who were using an electronic diary to track
seizures and medication compliance. The disadvantage of
this or any other compliance device, is that in order for it to
be informative, it has to be employed regularly by the
patient. One finding from the study was that of the 86
patients who were taking AEDs, about three fourths were
able to regularly adhere to electronic tracking. Of those who
did, adherence to medications was very high. This issue is
present with every type of compliance assessment. Pill
counting is another strategy often employed by physicians
and researchers to assess medication adherence, but it has
several limitations. The number of pills taken in a given
time interval does not provide any information to the
researcher/clinician about dose timing. In addition, patients
may discard pills or set pills aside prior to visits to appear to
be adherent to the medication regimen.12 The MEMS device
involves a microprocessor installed in the lid of a pill bottle,
and counts the number of times the bottle is opened, and a
dose presumably taken.1–3 The cap can be manipulated, or
patients can remove pills for multiple doses at one time, cre-
ating a false impression of noncompliance.
A possible explanation for the high reported adherence
rate is that the subjects falsely reported better adherence to
AEDs. Multiple studies have suggested that patients typi-
cally report good rates of adherence to their doctor, with
most reporting either missing no doses or one to two per
month.13,14 In a questionnaire distributed to neurologists all
over the United States to be placed in waiting rooms, 661
patients completed and returned the questionnaires and col-
lectively reported a mean of approximately two missed
doses per month. Only 32% of these patients reported that
they had informed their doctors about missed medication
doses.3 However, in fact, telling a “diary” may be more akin
to the waiting room questionnaire and may lead to more
truthful information. Approximately half of the women in
our study admitted to at least one occasion on which they
missed an AED dose.
In further support of the accuracy of diary reports was the
interesting discrepancy between reported rates of adherence
to AEDs versus non-AEDs within the subgroup of WWE
tracking medications other than AEDs. Despite potential
consequences associated with missing folic acid or vitamin
supplementation, the women reported taking all scheduled
doses of AEDs on 98.52% of days, whereas they reported
adherence with non-AEDs on 93.76% of days. The fact that
the participants recorded having taken some of their
medications and not others may be evidence that they are
reporting honestly, and that they are prioritizing one medi-
cation over another and choosing not to take the supple-
ments. On >98% of days on which WWE collectively
reported missing non-AEDs, the missed medications were
either folic acid or vitamins. Most non-AEDs tracked were
vitamins and supplements, rather than prescribed medica-
tions for chronic medical conditions. The adherence rates
prepartum and during pregnancy suggest that the women
may have given higher priority to these supplements during
pregnancy than before pregnancy. Very few women were
taking medications for chronic medical conditions during
the study. Only three women reported missing non-AED
prescriptions that were not supplements (one missed an anx-
iolytic several times, another missed an antihistamine, and
the third a thyroid replacement on a few occasions).
The 97.71% AED adherence rate observed in WEPOD
women who were tracking well is well above the previously
mentioned AED adherence rate of approximately 75% seen
in prior studies of antiepileptic medication adherence.1,2
One might argue that the patients in this study were more
highly motivated to adhere to medication regimens than the
average epilepsy patient, since they not only faced the typi-
cal consequences associated with seizures, but were also
motivated by trying to achieve pregnancy under high-risk
conditions. Few studies address the effect of pregnancy on
medication adherence in patients with chronic medical con-
ditions. One study used self-report questionnaires to assess
antiretroviral medication adherence in women with HIV in
the partum and postpartum periods, and showed a higher
rate of complete adherence in the partum period compared
to the postpartum period (61% vs. 44%).15 Women in our
study who became pregnant did not appear to have a differ-
ent adherence rate before or during their pregnancies, but it
is possible that they may have a lower adherence rate when
not actively seeking pregnancy.
The electronic device itself may have aided in reminding
patients to take their medications, especially considering
that the device has a built-in daily “pop-up” reminder. Elec-
tronic diaries have many potential advantages over tradi-
tional paper diaries, including real-time data transfer,
electronic reminders, convenience, and time-stamping.11 In
our study, participants were able to back-fill their diaries,
which may impact accuracy, but time-stamping is a way to
assess when participants actually use their diaries and could
be useful in future research. A 2002 study compared use of
paper diaries to electronic diaries as a tool to track pain
scores among a group of 80 patients with chronic pain. The
electronic diary included timed alerts as a reminder to input
information. Results showed significantly improved diary
adherence in the electronic diary group.16 Although the
study did not address medication adherence, it demonstrates
the utility of use of real-time reminders in electronic diary
use, and may be applicable to not only diary adherence but
medication adherence. Also as noted earlier, 75% of the

Medication Adherence in WWE Pregnancy
 WWE were >80% adherent with the diary, and selecting this
group for analysis may represent a selection bias of the
patients who are more adherent in general, to both use of the
diary and to taking medications as prescribed. Adherence is
defined and assessed differently in different studies, and
limits the ability to compare medication adherence rates
between studies.
The device also provides the study investigators with
real-time information about patients’ medication adherence
and seizure frequency, and allows the physicians and inves-
tigators to identify problems between visits and contact the
patients to potentially intervene. Future studies using this or
a similar electronic tracking device may further elucidate
the role of these devices with daily reminder alerts as an aid
in improving medication adherence. This tracking device
may also prove to be useful in the clinic. Although it
remains to be seen whether patients would be willing to use
an electronic diary on a long-term basis, the ubiquity and
accessibility of electronic devices and “apps” makes them
more likely to be integrated into a daily routine. Further-
more, there are many instances where electronic devices
might be clinically useful for a discrete period, such as dur-
ing a pregnancy, when it may be useful to monitor compli-
ance and review it at visits. This might allow a discussion of
why medication was missed on certain days.
One can infer that the discrepancy in reported rate of
medication adherence implies that woman feel that their
AEDs are more important than other medication, and that
missing them may carry graver consequences than missing
the nonepilepsy medications. Tracking of non-AEDs was
optional in this study (only 62.5% of subjects tracked non-
AEDs), but it would be valuable to more closely examine
this discrepancy in future studies with a larger sample size.
Further examination of the root of motivation behind taking
different types of medications may allow physicians to bet-
ter understand and ultimately improve patient adherence to
medications.
Conclusion
The majority of women planning pregnancy can maintain
electronic diaries. Compliance for AEDs was excellent both
prior to and during pregnancy among those who tracked
>80% of days. Electronic diaries can be employed both in
clinical trials and in practice to monitor adherence. The fact
that some women took their AEDs but not their folic acid
and supplements suggests that perceived importance of
medication is one element in compliance.
