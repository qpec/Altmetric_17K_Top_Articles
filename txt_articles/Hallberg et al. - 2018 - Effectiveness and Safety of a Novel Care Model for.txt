ABSTRACT
Introduction: Carbohydrate restriction mark-
edly improves glycemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes (T2D) but necessitates prompt
medication changes. Therefore, we assessed the
effectiveness and safety of a novel care model
providing continuous remote care with medi-
cation management based on biometric feed-
back combined with the metabolic approach of
nutritional ketosis for T2D management.
Methods: We conducted an open-label, non-
randomized, controlled, before-and-after 1-year
study of this continuous care intervention (CCI)
and usual care (UC). Primary outcomes were
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), weight, and
medication use. Secondary outcomes included
fasting serum glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR,
blood lipids and lipoproteins, liver and kidney
function markers, and high-sensitivity C-reac-
tive protein (hsCRP).

creatinine and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and
ALP) declined (P B 0.0001), and apolipoprotein
B was unchanged (P = 0.37). UC participants
had no significant changes in biomarkers or
T2D medication prescription at 1 year.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
Treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have
improved, yet T2D and being overweight are
still significant public health concerns. Blood
sugar in patients with T2D can improve quickly
when patients eat significantly fewer dietary
carbohydrates. However, this demands careful
medicine management by doctors, and patients
need support and frequent contact with health
providers to sustain this way of living. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate if a new
care model with very low dietary carbohydrate
intake and continuous supervision by a health
coach and doctor could safely lower HbA1c,
weight and need for medicines after 1 year in
adults with T2D. 262 adults with T2D volun-
teered to participate in this continuous care
intervention (CCI) along with 87 adults with
T2D
receiving
usual
care
(UC)
from
their
doctors and diabetes education program. After 1
year, patients in the CCI, on average, lowered
HbA1c from 7.6 to 6.3%, lost 12% of their body
weight, and reduced diabetes medicine use.
94% of patients who were prescribed insulin
reduced or stopped their insulin use, and sul-
fonylureas were eliminated in all patients. Par-
ticipants in the UC group had no changes to
HbA1c, weight or diabetes medicine use over
the year. These changes in CCI participants
happened safely while dyslipidemia and mark-
ers
of
inflammation
and
liver
function
improved. This suggests the novel care model
studied here using dietary carbohydrate restric-
tion and continuous remote care can safely
support
adults
with
T2D
to
lower
HbA1c,
weight, and medicine use.

INTRODUCTION
The number of people living with diabetes
worldwide nearly quadrupled since 1980, esti-
mated at 422 million in 2014 [1]. In the USA,
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
reports
30.3 million adults presently live with diabetes,
and it is among the leading causes of death [2].
Treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes (T2D)
have demonstrated varying success. Intensive
lifestyle interventions are effective treatments
for obese individuals with T2D when weight
loss is achieved and sustained [3]. Evidence for
improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients
with T2D prescribed glucagon-like peptide 1
receptor agonists (GLP-1) and sodium glucose
co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) is increas-
ing [4, 5]. Forty percent of patients undergoing
bariatric
surgery
demonstrate
substantial
improvements in glycemic control after 1 year
and many achieve T2D remission [6]. Despite
advancements in treatment options, cost, side
effects,
adherence,
and
disease
progression
remain barriers.
Guidelines
for
T2D
management
recom-
mend lifestyle change and weight loss [7, 8].
However, a fraction of individuals are successful
at long-term weight loss maintenance and true
disease
remission
is
uncommon
[3,
9].
Mediterranean-style,
DASH,
and
plant-based
diets,
sometimes
with
prescribed
energy
restriction, are recommended, but effectiveness
data are limited [7] and low fat diets have not
been shown to be superior for weight loss [10].
Commercially available weight loss programs
have demonstrated short-term success in gly-
cemic control, but continued success at 1 year is
uncommon [11].
Glycemic control can be achieved quickly
with
carbohydrate
restriction
via
very
low
energy diets (400–800 kcal day-1; VLCD) [12].
However, VLCD are necessarily temporary and
outcomes often revert when patients resume
former
dietary
patterns.
Alternatively,
nutritional
ketosis,
achieved
by
consuming
moderate protein and greatly reduced carbohy-
drate, results in similarly increased serum beta-
hydroxybutyrate
(BHB)
concentrations
as
observed during VLCD, which signifies a shift to
using fat as the body’s primary fuel source [12].
This nutritional therapy may help patients
achieve sustainable glycemic control without
prescribed
energy
restriction.
Benefit
may
accrue from decreased circulating glucose and
insulin [13], ketone signaling [14, 15], or even-
tual weight loss. Studies utilizing carbohydrate
restriction observed improved glycemic control
and cardiometabolic markers, but were often
short-term trials of small groups, excluded sub-
jects prescribed insulin, or infrequently moni-
tored or achieved ketosis [16–20].
The chronic nature of diabetes care presents
an additional challenge requiring sustained
behavioral change that is difficult to support
with traditional medical care including infre-
quent provider contact [21]. Adherence to life-
style changes may be poor in the absence of
support from providers and peers. We therefore
hypothesized that a comprehensive care model
that supports patients to achieve sustained
nutritional ketosis while eating to satiety may
have robust benefits in T2D management. This
intervention utilizes continuous care through
intensive, digitally enabled support including
telemedicine
access
to
a
medical
provider
(physician
or
nurse
practitioner),
health
coaching, nutrition and behavior change edu-
cation and individualized care plans, biometric
feedback, and peer support via an online com-
munity. Thus, the purpose of this study was to
assess the effectiveness and safety of a novel
care model (Virta Clinic, Virta Health; San
Francisco, CA, USA) for the management of
T2D after 1 year. Secondary aims were (1) to
determine if a difference in primary outcomes
existed between participants who self-selected
on-site versus web-based education delivery
and (2) explore the time course of biomarker
change at 70 days and 1 year into the CCI.
Primary endpoints to assess effectiveness of the
intervention
were
change
in
glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, and medi-
cation prescription after 1 year. Secondary out-
comes,
including
clinical
biomarkers

 associated physiological systems and adverse
events, were assessed to determine safety of the
intervention.
METHODS
We utilized an open-label, non-randomized,
controlled, before-and-after study design with a
cohort of patients who self-selected to partici-
pate in the metabolic and continuous care
intervention (CCI) for T2D and a comparison
group of patients who self-selected to partici-
pate while receiving their usual care (UC) from
their own medical providers and diabetes edu-
cation
program
(Clinicaltrials.gov
Identifier
NCT02519309). Adults diagnosed with T2D
were recruited via clinical referrals, local adver-
tisements, and word of mouth in Lafayette,
Indiana, USA and surrounding region from
August 2015 through March 2016. This study
was approved by the Franciscan Health Lafay-
ette Institutional Review Board. All procedures
performed in studies involving human partici-
pants were in accordance with the ethical
standards of the institutional and/or national
research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki
declaration and its later amendments or com-
parable ethical standards. Informed consent was
obtained from all individual participants inclu-
ded in the study.
Continuous Care Intervention
Participants in the CCI underwent history and
physical exam followed by laboratory testing to
ensure they met inclusion and exclusion criteria
(Supplementary Materials A). Upon qualifying,
CCI participants received biomarker tracking
tools
including
a
cellular-connected
body
weight scale (BT003, Body Trace; New York, NY,
USA), a finger-stick blood glucose and ketone
meter (Precision Xtra, Abbott; Alameda, CA,
USA), and a blood pressure cuff if hypertension
was diagnosed (BP742 N, Omron Healthcare,
Inc.; Lake Forest, IL, USA). Access to a web-based
software application (app) was provided for
biomarker reporting and monitoring, educa-
tion, and communication with remote care
team (via telemedicine) consisting of a health
coach and medical provider (physician or nurse
practitioner) for advice and medication man-
agement. Social support was provided via an
online peer community. Participants in the CCI
retained their primary care provider (PCP) for
conditions other than metabolic disease, and
care coordination between the PCP and CCI
provider occurred as needed. Frequency and
type of biomarker tracking were individualized
on the basis of care needs and recorded by par-
ticipants in the app; initial participant instruc-
tions were to weigh and measure blood BHB
concentration daily, and to measure blood glu-
cose one to three times daily. The remote care
team monitored this information; a medical
provider made medication changes as indicated
by the participant-reported biomarkers (Sup-
plementary Materials B).
Participants
were provided individualized
nutrition recommendations that allowed them
to achieve and sustain nutritional ketosis with a
goal of 0.5–3.0 mmol L-1 blood BHB. Partici-
pants were encouraged to report daily hunger,
cravings, energy, and mood on a four-point
Likert scale. These ratings and BHB concentra-
tions were utilized to adjust nutritional guid-
ance. With the insulin resistance characteristic
of T2D, patients typically require total dietary
carbohydrates to be restricted to less than
30 g day-1 to achieve nutritional ketosis. Health
coaches monitored blood BHB concentrations
logged by participants and worked with partic-
ipants individually to adjust dietary carbohy-
drate intake to a level that would allow them to
achieve nutritional ketosis. Daily protein intake
was initially targeted to a level of 1.5 g kg-1 of
reference
(i.e.,
medium-frame
‘‘ideal’’)
body
weight and adjusted as necessary to aid partici-
pants in achieving nutritional ketosis based on
participant-logged blood BHB concentrations.
Participants were coached to incorporate diet-
ary fats to satiety. Participants were advised to
consume adequate intake of omega-3 (eicos-
apentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid)
and omega-6 (linoleic acid) polyunsaturated
fats [22], while it was recommended that the
remainder of their intake from fat come from
both monounsaturated and saturated sources.
Other aspects of the diet were individually pre-
scribed
to
ensure
safety,
effectiveness,
and
586

 satisfaction,
including
consumption
of
3–5
servings of non-starchy vegetables and adequate
mineral and fluid intake for the ketogenic state.
At onset of dietary changes, participants were
advised
to
consume
a
multivitamin,
1000–2000 IU vitamin D3, and up to 1000 mg
omega-3 daily. If participants exhibited signs of
magnesium depletion (e.g., muscle twitches or
cramps), daily supplementation (500 mg mag-
nesium oxide or 200 mg magnesium chloride)
was suggested. If participants exhibited head-
aches, constipation, or lightheadedness, ade-
quate
sodium
and
fluid
intake
was
recommended. BHB concentrations were also
utilized as a marker of adherence to nutritional
ketosis. Behavior change strategies were utilized
by the remote care team and tailored to the
needs of each participant to help achieve gly-
cemic control. Examples of techniques utilized
include education of natural consequences,
shaping knowledge, goal setting, self-monitor-
ing, feedback, monitoring and reinforcement
from health coach and medical provider, self-
belief, social support, relapse prevention, asso-
ciations, and repetition.
Participants in the CCI self-selected how
they would receive most of their education: (1)
via on-site group education classes that met
weekly for 12 weeks, bi-weekly for 12 weeks,
and monthly for 6 months (n = 136; CCI-on-
site) or (2) via web-based, recorded educational
content viewed independently through the app
(n = 126; CCI-web). Educational content was
the same regardless of delivery method (Sup-
plementary Materials C), and all other aspects of
care were the same. During on-site classes,
health coaches presented educational content
and medical providers met with participants
individually. Participants receiving web-based
education could schedule visits with the CCI
medical provider if desired. Apart from educa-
tion delivery, both groups received remote care
from health coaches.
Usual Care
Participants in the UC group were patients with
diagnosed T2D who were recently referred to
the local diabetes education program by their
primary
care
physician
or
endocrinologist
where they were counseled by registered dieti-
tians on diabetes self-management, nutrition,
and lifestyle [7]. Medical care for their T2D was
provided by their primary care physician or
endocrinologist. No modification to the care
that they received for their T2D was made by
the study. This group was observed at baseline
and 1 year as reference for typical disease treat-
ment and progression over 1 year within the
same geographical, health care, and laboratory
locations. UC participants attended a separate
information session and informed consent was
obtained
followed
by
laboratory
testing
to
ensure they met all inclusion and exclusion
criteria. Patients were informed that the trial
also had an intervention arm and could partic-
ipate in that group if they chose to do so.
Outcome Measures
In-clinic vital signs and anthropometrics were
obtained at baseline, 70-days (CCI only [23]),
and 1-year follow-up. Height was assessed via
stadiometer for calculation of body mass index.
In-clinic weight for all participants was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.1 lb (Model 750, Detecto;
Webb City, MO, USA) and converted to kg. In-
clinic blood pressure was obtained manually by
trained staff after participants rested in a seated
position for 5 min. Adverse events were repor-
ted to the Principal Investigator and reviewed
by the Institutional Review Board.
Fasted blood draws occurred at baseline,
70-days (CCI only [23]), and 1-year follow up.
Blood analytes were determined via standard
procedures at a Clinical Laboratory Improve-
ment Amendment (CLIA) accredited laboratory
on the day of sample collection or from stored
serum (Supplementary Materials D).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using JMP
software (version 5.1, SAS Institute; Cary, SC,
USA) for all analyses except multiple imputa-
tion, for which we used Stata software (version
11, StataCorp; College Station, TX, USA). Mul-
tiple imputation was used to estimate means

 and standard errors that include the variability
between imputations. Missing values were esti-
mated from 700 imputations from multivariate
normal regression. The number of missing data
points for each measure can be determined
from the difference between all participants and
completers
in
Tables 1
and
S1.
Across
all
biomarkers, 4% of baseline values and 24% of
1-year values were missing (due to dropout,
incalculable
values,
or
inability
to
procure
timely samples) and thus imputed to conduct
the
intention-to-treat
analysis.
Two-sample
t tests were used to test whether baseline dif-
ferences and differences between 1-year bio-
marker changes were significant. Within-group
changes were tested using paired t test and
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) when adjus-
ted for baseline covariates (sex, age, baseline
BMI, insulin use versus non-use, and African-
American
race).
Although
tables
present
triglyceride and hsCRP summary statistics in
clinical units, significance levels were obtained
from log-transformed values to reduce skew-
ness. For completer analysis, percent change
was calculated as the mean difference (Table 2)
divided by the mean baseline value (Table 1).
Significant changes in medication use and the
proportion
of
patients
with
HbA1cat
least
48 mmol mol-1
(C 6.5%)
were
tested
using
McNemar test with continuity correction in
completers, and linear regression of the changes
in the dichotomous states when missing out-
come data were imputed. Standard deviations
are presented within parentheses and standard
errors
following
‘‘±’’.
Nominal
significance
levels (P) are presented in tables; however, a
significance level of P\0.0017 ensures simul-
taneous significance at P\0.05 with Bonferroni
adjustment
for
the
30
variables
examined.
Results presented are intention-to-treat analyses
(all), where missing values were estimated by
imputation, unless otherwise noted. Partici-
pants who withdrew or lacked biomarkers at
1 year were not included in the analyses of
completers.

diabetes medication other than metformin,
30% prescribed insulin) and 93% were obese.
Eighty-seven percent of participants in UC at
baseline were prescribed diabetes medication
(46% prescribed insulin), and 82% were obese.
Forty-four participants (16.8%) withdrew from
the CCI, 22 from each education delivery mode.
Baseline characteristics of CCI dropouts did not
differ significantly from the 218 completers
except none of the five thiazolidinedione users
were dropouts (Table 1). At baseline, character-
istics of CCI participants who self-selected web-
based versus on-site education were not signifi-
cantly different after accounting for multiple
comparisons (see Table S1 in the electronic
supplementary material). Compared to the 78
UC participants who completed the study, the
nine that withdrew tended to be older (58 ver-
sus 52 years old), had lower TSH, and fewer were
prescribed insulin, SGLT-2, DPP-4, GLP-1, or
blood pressure medications (Table 1).

HDL-cholesterol
increased 18% (P\1.0 9 10-16) and calculated
LDL-cholesterol increased 10% (P = 5.1 9 10-5)
while apolipoprotein B (ApoB) concentration
was unchanged (P = 0.37) for participants in the
CCI. There were no significant differences in
mean biomarker changes between CCI-web and
CCI-onsite (see Table S2 in the electronic sup-
plementary material). In contrast to the CCI,
patients enrolled in UC for 1 year showed no
Bonferroni-adjusted significant change for any
of the biomarkers measured (Table 2).
Following 1 year of CCI, usage of all diabetes
medications combined (excluding metformin)
was reduced significantly (56.9 ± 3.1% to 29.7
± 3.0%,

lureas (23.7–0%, P\1.0 9 10-16), and thiazo-
lidinediones (1.5–0.4%, P = 0.23) (Fig. 3). GLP-1
prescriptions
were
statistically
unchanged
(13.4% at baseline to 14.4% at 1 year, P = 0.67),
and metformin decreased slightly (71.4–65.0%,
P = 0.04) for CCI participants. Forty percent
(31/78) of CCI participants who began the study
with insulin prescriptions (average dose of
64.2 units) eliminated the medication, while
the remaining 60% (47/78) of insulin users
reduced daily dosage from 105.2 to 53.8 units
(P\0.0001). Patients enrolled in UC for 1 year
showed
no
Bonferroni-adjusted
significant
change for prescription of medication. For the
34 UC participants that continued using insu-
lin, the average daily dose increased from 96.0
to 111.9 units.
The proportion of participants in the total
imputed CCI group with HbA1cbelow 48 mmol
mol-1 (
\6.5%) increased from 19.5 ± 2.4% to
69.8 ± 3.1%. Of those in the CCI with HbA1c
reported at 1 year, 72% (147/204) achieved
HbA1c below 48 mmol mol-1 (6.5%) and 60.3%
(123/204) of participants achieved HbA1c below
48 mmol mol-1 (
\6.5%) while taking no dia-
betes medication or only metformin. Of those
in the CCI with HbA1c below 48 mmol mol-1
(
\6.5%) at 1 year, 42.3% (52/123) were pre-
scribed no diabetes medication and 57.7% (71/
123) were prescribed metformin only. The pro-
portion of the total imputed CCI group with

increased from 34.9 ± 3.3% to 58.4 ± 3.9%, and
the proportion with class III obesity decreased
from 45.5 ± 3.1% to 19.6 ± 2.8%.

remained significant when adjusted for the
baseline age, sex, insulin medication use, and

was
significantly
greater than the changes in the UC group for all

Time Course of Biomarker Change in CCI
Over the course of the intervention at baseline,
70 days [23], and 1 year, the proportion of par-
ticipants in the total imputed CCI with HbA1c
below 48 mmol mol-1 (
\6.5%) increased from
19.5 ± 2.4 to 60.7 ± 3.1 to 69.8 ± 3.1%; the
proportion
with
fasting
glucose
below
6.99 mmol L-1 (
\126 mg dL-1) increased from
34.9 ± 3.3 to 55.5 ± 3.3 to 58.4 ± 3.9%, and the
proportion with class III obesity decreased from
45.5 ± 3.1, to 30.2 ± 3.1, to 19.6 ± 2.8%.
The time course of biomarker changes also
differed by variable (see Table S3 in the electronic
supplementary material). Most of the 1-year
improvements in diabetes risk factors were
achieved during the first 70 days of the inter-
vention including 84% of the HbA1c decrease,
90% of the fasting glucose decrease, 73% of the
fasting insulin decrease, 64% of the C-peptide
decrease, and 87% and 74% of the decreases in
HOMA-IR as estimated from fasting insulin and
C-peptide
concentrations,
respectively.
Improvements in blood pressure also mostly

dates where no weights were recorded during the 3-day
time window for a given participant, the most recent 3-day
mean preceding the date was used. b Histogram depicting

 occurred in the initial 70 days, as did reductions
in alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and
eGFR. Most of the plasma triglyceride decrease
occurred during the first 70 days (87%), whereas
essentially all the substantial increase in HDL-c-
holesterol occurred between the initial 70 days of
the intervention and 1 year (99%). About 60% of
weight loss occurred in the first 70 days.
Retention and Adherence in CCI
Eighty-three percent of participants remained
enrolled in the CCI at 1 year. Nearly all CCI
participants (96%) reported at least one BHB
reading of 0.5 mmol L-1 or more by handheld
measure, and among completers, the group
mean at 70 days by laboratory measure was over
threefold
the
baseline
(0.54 ± 0.04
versus
0.17 ± 0.01 mmol L-1).
Laboratory-measured
BHB
at
1 year
(0.31 ± 0.03 mmol L-1)
was
nearly double the baseline value (Fig. 4). The
intention-to-treat
analysis
yielded
similar
results, with an increase in average from base-
line
(0.17 ± 0.01 mmol L-1)
to
70 days
(0.54 ± 0.04 mmol L-1), followed by a decrease
at 1 year (0.30 ± 0.02 mmol L-1), though still
nearly twofold the baseline concentrations.
Safety and Adverse Events
For CCI participants, acid–base physiology was
normal; no cases of metabolic acidosis were
observed. One CCI patient (0.38% of starters)
had a clinically significant rise in serum crea-
tinine, but group mean declined at 1 year. Mean
blood urea nitrogen increased significantly in
the CCI group, possibly indicating increased
dietary protein consumption although high
protein intake was not recommended. Mean
uric acid in the CCI rose transiently at 70 days,
but was unchanged at 1 year; no new cases of
gout were diagnosed. Mean free T4 level was

CCI [24].

of
symptomatic

glycemia requiring assistance were reported.
None of the adverse events were attributed to
the intervention.
Adverse events were reported in 6/87 UC
participants, including one percutaneous coro-
nary
intervention
(PCI)
to
left

artery, two carotid endarterectomies (one of
which
was
successful),
multifactorial

pulmonary emboli.
DISCUSSION
This
study
evaluated
the
effectiveness
and
safety of an alternative treatment model for T2D
that utilized continuous remote care to provide
a high level of outpatient support combined
with individualized nutrition enabling long-
term maintenance of behavioral and metabolic
change
via
nutritional
ketosis.
This
trial
prospectively observed adults with T2D under-
going treatment via this novel care model and a
comparison group of adults with T2D under-
going usual care treatment. Following 1 year of
CCI, participants achieved a 14 mmol mol-1
(1.3 ± 0.1%) decline in HbA1c concurrent with
12% weight loss and reduction in medication
use. Consistent conclusions were reached with
intention-to-treat analysis and analysis of com-
pleters. A usual care group showed no change in
diabetes status or related biomarkers over the
year.
Effectiveness
The CCI reduced HbA1c by 14 mmol mol-1
(1.3%)
at
1 year.
HbA1c
reductions
up
to
7 mmol mol-1
(0.6%)
via
intensive
lifestyle
intervention [25] and 11 mmol mol-1 (1.0%)
via an energy-restricted low-carbohydrate diet
with partial food provision delivered via an
outpatient setting [26] were previously repor-
ted. The present intervention achieved 12%
weight loss at 1 year; previously studied inter-
ventions elicited 4–9% weight loss in patients
with T2D [25, 26]. The regular monitoring of
weight, glucose, and BHB as biometric feedback

 for participant, health coach, and medical pro-
vider may have provided behavior reinforce-
ment. Further, it seems plausible that this
multicomponent care model allowed for greater
improvements compared to interventions that
provided a subset of components. A recent pri-
mary care-led weight management intervention
utilizing
a 3–5 month VLCD
resulted in a
10 mmol mol-1 (0.9%) reduction in HbA1c and
10% weight loss at 1 year; 46% of participants
achieved HbA1c below 48 mmol mol-1 (
\6.5%)
while taking no medications [27]. While only
25% of participants in the present investigation
achieved this measure of diabetes remission, the
protocol for the present investigation discon-
tinued metformin prescription only because of
contraindication,
intolerance,
or
patient
request given its efficacy for T2D prevention
and recommended use in certain populations
[7]. An additional 35% of participants in the
present investigation were able to attain HbA1c
below 48 mmol mol-1 (
\6.5%) while taking
only metformin. The longer duration of T2D
and baseline insulin prescription to 30% of
participants might be factors influencing the
proportion of participants in which glycemic
control medications could be discontinued in
this investigation.
HbA1c improved concurrent with medication
reductions prescribed for blood glucose-lower-
ing. For each medication class, the sum per-
centage
of
eliminations
and
reductions
of
prescriptions at 1 year exceeded that observed at
70 days [23]. Improved glycemic control via a
predominantly pharmaceutical approach has
demonstrated paradoxical increased cardiovas-
cular risk [28]. Tight glycemic control can elicit
symptomatic hypoglycemia [29] or weight gain
[30], neither of which was observed in CCI.
Thus, it is likely the treatment method by which
glycemic control is achieved (e.g., pharmaco-
logical,
surgery,
lifestyle
intervention)
is
important to health outcomes and risk.
Most changes in HbA1c, glucose, insulin,
C-peptide, and HOMA-IR occurred in the first
70 days with further improvement observed at
1 year. While the mechanism for improved
insulin sensitivity in ketosis is not fully under-
stood,
early
improvements
in
HbA1c
and
HOMA-IR indicate rapid restoration of liver and
peripheral insulin sensitivity and are consistent
with improvements observed within 2 weeks of
ketosis when measured by euglycemic hyperin-
sulinemic clamp [13]. Utilization of blood BHB
for self-monitoring with reinforcement by clin-
icians may have contributed to sustained HbA1c
improvement. Further, BHB acts as a signaling
molecule, reducing inflammation and oxidative
stress [14, 15]; therefore, mild ketonemia may
benefit multiple organs and systems. With
appropriate dietary formulation, benefits of
nutritional ketosis are observed in mouse mod-
els of longevity and health span [31, 32]. Par-
ticipant
mean
BHB
levels
are
of
similar
magnitude
to
those
observed
with
SGLT-2
inhibitor
treatment
(* 0.5 mmol L-1)
[33].
Recent trials [5, 34] demonstrate cardiovascular
benefits to two SGLT-2 inhibitors; mild ketosis
was postulated as a mechanism [33]. Nutri-
tionally achieved ketosis may have long-term
cardiovascular benefits without the pharma-
ceutical risk profile [34]. Further, presence of
glucose and palmitate has been associated with
beta cell apoptosis [35]. Given the reduced
levels of glucose and palmitate observed during
nutritional ketosis [36], it is plausible that
ketosis might play a role in attenuating glucol-
ipotoxicity-induced beta cell death.
Beyond achieving improved glycemic con-
trol concurrent with medication and weight
reductions, the CCI had broad positive impact
on
blood
pressure,
liver
enzymes,
hsCRP,
triglycerides, and HDL-C. Elevated ALT, AST,
and ALP are associated with non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
[37]; these enzymes were significantly reduced
with intervention. Rapid reduction in triglyc-
erides and gradual rise in HDL-C observed fol-
lowing
CCI
are
consistent
with
previously
studied
carbohydrate-restricted
interventions
and carbohydrates are well known to increase
triglycerides [38]. Of the 108 CCI completers
with
elevated
baseline
triglycerides
(C 1.69 mmol L-1), 54% were in normal range
at 1 year. Rise in LDL-C at 1 year, occurring with
significant triglyceride decrease, was expected as
there is less exchange via cholesteryl ester
transfer protein [39]. However, this exchange
would not affect particle number and ApoB was
unchanged,
suggesting
an
overall
neutral
Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:583–612
607
 impact on LDL lipoprotein-associated cardio-
vascular risk. In epidemiological studies, uti-
lization of dietary saturated fat in place of
carbohydrate was associated with beneficial
impact on lipid profile, cardiovascular out-
comes, and mortality despite higher LDL-C
[40, 41]. Transiently increased total and LDL
cholesterol were also associated with mobiliza-
tion of adipose cholesterol stores during major
weight loss [42].
Consistent
with
population-level
studies
that observed very low rates of diabetes remis-
sion [43], the UC group had no change in HbA1c
and other indicators of glycemic status and
insulin resistance but a net increase in diabetes
medication use. Laboratory tests were generally
unremarkable with biomarkers not changing
significantly. The same facilities and method-
ologies were used for both the CCI and UC
participants
indicating
that
the
changes
observed in CCI participants not observed in
the UC participants are unlikely to be due to
methodological changes in clinical or labora-
tory data capture.
Despite independent recruitment of the CCI
and UC groups, most of their baseline charac-
teristics including HbA1c and years since dia-
betes diagnosis were not significantly different.
To enable a comparison between the CCI and
UC groups, covariate adjustment was utilized to
adjust for differences in baseline characteristics
including sex, age, baseline BMI, baseline insu-
lin use (user vs. non-user), and African-Ameri-
can race. With or without baseline adjustment,
the change over 1 year elicited in the CC and
UC groups differ in all primary outcomes—
HbA1c, medication use, and weight—and most
secondary outcomes including lipid profile,
inflammation, and liver function. In general,
the favorable changes observed in the CCI were
not observed in the UC cohort. For example, of
patients who obtained HbA1c measurements at
1 year, 60% of CCI participants achieved a
HbA1c below 48 mmol mol-1 (
\6.5%) while
taking no diabetes medications or metformin
only, whereas only 10% of UC participants
achieved this status.
One interpretation of these results is that the
differences in observed outcomes over the year
are due to advantages of the CCI over usual
care. This suggests a need to incorporate car-
bohydrate restriction and comprehensive, con-
tinuous remote care as options in current
guidelines for patients with diabetes as evidence
accumulates [44]. However, alternative expla-
nations are possible that may account for the
large
degree
of
difference
observed.
For
instance,
patients
entering
the
CCI
were
recruited knowing that they were making a
commitment to lifestyle change, while the UC
participants were identified as recent referrals to
local diabetes education programs and may not
have had similar motivation or expectations of
effort as the CCI participants. However, even
when
motivation
is
controlled
for
upon
recruitment as an inclusion criterion for par-
ticipation, additional factors may play a role in
retention as evidenced by a recent study with
randomization [45]. Also, the CCI and UC
cohorts may also have differed in baseline
characteristics that were not captured such as
socioeconomic status.
Additionally, the treatment intensity of the
two cohorts was not equal. The UC participants
had one or more meetings with a registered
dietitian and were under the medical supervi-
sion of their primary care provider or endocri-
nologist
with
periodic
medical
visits.
In
contrast, the CCI participants received a com-
prehensive
and
individualized
continuous
remote care intervention (and in one subgroup,
the addition of on-site group classes). A more
intensive
intervention might
have
delivered
somewhat better results than the investigation’s
UC group. For instance, a recent in-person
group-based intervention for weight loss in T2D
adults reduced HbA1c by 3 mmol mol-1 (0.3%)
and weight by 4.0% after a year and medica-
tions were reduced in 26% of participants [46].
Future research might compare interventions of
similar
intensity
with
different
treatment
strategies to begin to understand the contribu-
tion of each component of the intervention to
the overall effect.
Adherence to CCI
Eighty-three percent of CCI participants were
retained
through
1 year;
patient
perceived
608
Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:583–612
 benefits of favorable health outcomes, individ-
ualized continuity of care, relationship with
health coach, ongoing education, biometric
feedback, and peer support may have aided
retention. Most participants achieved nutri-
tional ketosis during CCI and maintained ele-
vated BHB at 1 year, indicating sustainability
and was possibly enabled by the novel use of
blood BHB as daily biofeedback for adherence.
Safety of CCI
No episodes of ketoacidosis, no hypo- or hyper-
glycemic events requiring assistance, and no
adverse events were attributable to the CCI. With
improvements or no change in liver, kidney, and
thyroid function, safety of the intervention
appears favorable. The absence of hypoglycemic
events requiring assistance despite relatively
tight glucose control may be due to the careful
medical
provider
prescription
management,
especially rapid downward titration of insulin
and sulfonylurea preventing hypoglycemia fol-
lowing dietary changes. Additionally, elevated
BHB may have offered protection against hypo-
glycemic events, as starvation-adapted humans
with
elevated
BHB
have
demonstrated
full
preservation of central nervous system function
despite profound hypoglycemia induced by
exogenous insulin [47].
Study Strengths and Weaknesses
Prior
studies
have
demonstrated
favorable
improvements in T2D status following carefully
managed ketogenic diets as case series [48] or in
small short-term randomized trials [45]. This
study’s strengths include its prospective design,
large cohort, high retention, duration, replica-
tion of findings between the CCI-onsite and
CCI-web groups, and the collection of multiple
time points in the intervention group allowing
assessment of how biomarkers changed over
time. This study also included participants pre-
scribed insulin and with long-standing T2D,
which were often exclusion criteria for prior
studies. The means of recruitment, outpatient
setting, and lack of food provision may enhance
the real-world application of this study.
Weaknesses of this study include that it
occurred at a single site and participants were
mostly
Caucasian.
Socioeconomic
and
psy-
chosocial status and genetics data were not
collected. The study was not of sufficient size
and duration to measure hard endpoints (e.g.,
mortality). Future trials could include a multi-
site randomized controlled trial with greater
racial and ethnic diversity, broader age range,
and greater disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that a T2D interven-
tion combining technology-enabled continu-
ous remote care with individualized care plans
encouraging
nutritional
ketosis
can
signifi-
cantly
reduce
HbA1c,
medication
use,
and
weight within 70 days [23], and that these out-
comes can be maintained or improved through
1 year.
Most
intervention
participants
with
HbA1c reported at 1 year achieved glycemic
control in the sub-diabetes range with either no
medication or the use of metformin alone.
Related health parameters improved including
blood
pressure,
lipid-lipoprotein
profile,
inflammation,
and
liver
function.
Ongoing
research will determine the continued sustain-
ability,
effectiveness,
and
safety
of
these
behavioral and metabolic changes.
