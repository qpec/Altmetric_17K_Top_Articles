While diets rich in fruit and vegetables appear to reduce lung cancer risk, the evidence 
for individual carotenoid and vitamin intakes has been judged too limited to reach 
firm conclusions. Data from a case–control study of lung cancer (Montreal, QC, 
Canada, 1996–2002) were used to investigate the role of dietary intakes of β-carotene, 
α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, and vitamin C in lung cancer 
risk. In-person interviews elicited dietary information from 1,105 incident cases and 
1,449 population controls. Usual frequency of consumption of 49 fruits and vegetables 
2 years prior to diagnosis/interview was collected. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) between intake variables and lung cancer were estimated using logistic or 
polytomous regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors including a detailed 
smoking history. ORs associated with upper versus lower tertiles of intake were 0.66 
(95% CI = 0.51–0.84) for β-carotene, 0.70 (95% CI = 0.55–0.90) for α-carotene, 0.65 
(95% CI = 0.51–0.84) for β-cryptoxanthin, 0.75 (95% CI = 0.59–0.95) for lycopene, and 
0.74 (95% CI = 0.58–0.96) for vitamin C. ORs suggestive of a protective effect were 
found for elevated intakes of β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene in 
male heavy smokers and of vitamin C in female heavy smokers. Selected antioxidants 
were also associated with a lower risk of lung cancer in female moderate smokers, and 
of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. These results 
suggest that several dietary antioxidants found in common food sources may protect 
against lung cancer, even among heavy smokers.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Global statistics show that in 2012 
alone, lung cancer was responsible for an estimated 1.6 million deaths or 19.4% of all cancer-related 
deaths (1). Since survival remains low, the main hope for reducing the burden of this disease lies in 
prevention. Cigarette smoking is the foremost risk factor for lung cancer, accounting for up to 90% 
of all cases (2). Large-scale smoking prevention and cessation efforts have been attempted (3–5), and 
efforts in that direction must be pursued. However, other modifiable risk factors must be identified so 
that all possible lung cancer prevention strategies can be implemented. The recognized multifactorial

etiology of lung cancer suggests that factors other than smoking, 
such as diet, can influence its occurrence (6).
Results from a large systematic review published by the World 
Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) in 2007, as well as the 2016 update 
of this report, suggested a protective role of diets rich in fruit and 
vegetables (7, 8). These foods are thought to protect against lung 
cancer due to their content in micronutrients that have chemo-
preventive properties such as antioxidant activity. Antioxidants 
found in the highest concentrations in both the human diet and 
serum samples include vitamin C and the specific carotenoids 
β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and 
lycopene (9). In its assessment, the WCRF stated that while the 
evidence suggests that foods rich in carotenoids probably decrease 
lung cancer risk, no firm conclusion could yet be reached about 
the role of individual carotenoids or vitamin C as the evidence for 
these was too limited or inconsistent, respectively (7).
Although several studies have examined associations between 
individual carotenoids and vitamin C and lung cancer, including 
case–control studies (10–17), cohort studies (18–31), pooled 
analyses (32, 33), and meta-analyses (34–36), results remain 
equivocal. This may be attributable to a combination of small 
sample sizes in some studies (10, 12–19, 21–24, 28) and inadequate 
control of smoking in others, usually because they were not able 
to control for time since quitting in addition to other dimensions 
of smoking (25, 28, 30). Most studies focused exclusively on one 
sex or the other (11, 12, 14–19, 21, 23, 24, 26–28, 31), and if there 
was effect modification by sex, this would lead to heterogeneity 
of results. A few studies have suggested that antioxidants may 
relate differently to lung cancer risk depending on sex (10, 20, 
25), smoking intensity (20, 22, 27, 31, 37) and histological subtype 
of the tumor (13, 16, 26, 36), and heterogeneity of risk among 
such subgroups may have contributed to inconsistencies in the 
literature.
This prompted us to examine the relationship between 
intake of selected antioxidants and the risk of lung cancer in a 
large population-based case–control study, using updated food 
composition databases and detailed control for confounding by 
several different dimensions of smoking. We examined potential 
effect modification by sex and by smoking intensity on the 
antioxidant–lung cancer relationship, and examined the associa-
tion between these micronutrients and four tumor histological 
subtypes.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
study Population and Data collection
Data from a population-based case–control study conducted in 
Montreal, Québec (QC), Canada, were used. Eligible subjects 
were men and women, aged 35–75 years and living in the Montreal 
area. Cases were ascertained from 18 hospitals in the Montreal 
Metropolitan region, providing almost complete coverage of 
lung cancer diagnoses in the area (~98%). Potential cases were 
identified through active monitoring of hospital pathological 
reports and included histologically confirmed primary lung can-
cer cases diagnosed between January 1996 and December 1997. 
Concurrently, controls were randomly selected from the general 
population through electoral lists. In Canada, these lists include 
the names and addresses of practically all Canadian citizens 
residing in the country and are updated through active popula-
tion enumeration. Controls were frequency matched to cases by 
age (5-year group), sex, and electoral district (comprising some 
40,000 electors). The study and protocol were approved by the 
following Research Ethics Committees: the Institut National de 
la Recherche Scientifique, Hôpital Notre-Dame, Hôpital St-Luc, 
Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal, Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, 
Hôpital Jean-Talon, Hôpital Charles-Lemoyne, Hôpital Fleury, 
Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Hôpital Lachine, Hôpital 
Santa Cabrini, Jewish General Hospital, Royal-Victoria Hospital, 
Montreal General Hospital, St-Mary’s Hospital, Lakeshore 
General Hospital, Hôpital de Lasalle, Montreal Chest Hospital, 
Hôpital de Verdun, and Hôpital Pierre-Boucher. The study was 
carried out in accordance with their recommendations. All 
subjects provided written informed consent in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki. A total of 1,434 cases and 2,182 
controls were invited to participate in the study: 1,203 (83.9%) 
cases and 1,513 (70.6%) controls accepted. Trained interview-
ers conducted in-person interviews with the subject or a proxy 
respondent (if the subject was deceased or too ill to respond). 
Information was collected on a wide range of factors including 
subjects’ socioeconomic background, detailed occupational 
history, smoking history (smoking status, changes in smoking 
intensity levels and interruptions, cigarette-years, time since 
cessation), lifetime intake of alcoholic beverages (wine, beer, 
spirits), and dietary intake.
Dietary intake
Diet was assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency 
questionnaire (FFQ) adapted from the instrument developed by 
the Canadian Cancer Registries Epidemiology Research Group 
(38), which was based on two extensively validated question-
naires: the National Cancer Institute’s Block Questionnaire (39) 
and the Nurses’ Health Study FFQ (40). Modifications were made 
to reflect the diet of the study population and to capture major 
dietary sources of carotenoids and vitamin C among adults liv-
ing in Québec, Canada. The FFQ was pre-tested for face validity 
in a subgroup of the target population to ensure that questions 
were well understood. The questionnaire covered 77 food items, 
including 49 fruits and vegetables grouped into 25 individual 
statements. Frequency of intake 2 years prior to diagnosis or 
interview, in terms of a typical portion size specified for each 
question, was reported as “7 or more times per week,” “4 to 6 
times per week,” “1 to 3 times per week,” “1 to 3 times per month,” 
and “never or less than once per month.” The nutrient content 
of foods was extracted from the Canadian Nutrient File (ver-
sion 2007b) (41). For categories with closed frequency ranges, 
the mid-point value was used to assign a weekly frequency of 
intake of each food (42, 43). The following values were assigned 
to each category: 7, 5, 2, 0.5, or 0 times per week. Individual 
daily intakes of β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein/
zeaxanthin, lycopene, and vitamin C were then calculated by 
multiplying the weekly frequency of intake of each food by 
the nutrient content of the specified portion size and then 
summing the contributions from all foods and dividing by 7.

The food sources of each nutrient are presented in Table S1 in 
Supplementary Material. Nutrient intakes were adjusted for 
total energy with the residual method using the predicted nutri-
ent intake for the median daily energy intake among women 
and men in the sample. Adjusting nutrient intakes for energy 
reduces measurement error for specific nutrients and removes 
extraneous variation, allowing the direct evaluation of varia-
tion due to dietary composition rather than absolute nutrient 
intakes (42). Energy-adjusted nutrient values were categorized 
into tertile levels of intake based on the frequency distribution 
among controls. In all, 162 subjects (6%) were excluded from 
the dietary analyses either because they had not filled in the 
dietary section or because they had answered less than 50% of 
the dietary questions. It has indeed been observed previously 
that it is reasonable to exclude subjects for whom 50% or more 
of items on a FFQ are left unanswered, if missing values are 
randomly distributed across the questionnaire (44). The final 
sample for analysis thus consisted of 2,554 subjects, i.e., 1,105 
lung cancer cases and 1,449 population controls.
statistical analyses
Logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of lung 
cancer associated with micronutrient intakes. Adjusted odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated 
comparing second and third tertile levels of intake (referred to as 
medium and high intakes) to the first tertile level of intake (low 
intake) for each micronutrient. Polytomous regression models 
were applied to estimate the association between micronutrient 
intakes and risk of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, 
small cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Covariates 
included in regression models were age (continuous), sex (woman 
or man), respondent status (self or proxy), ethnic origin (French 
ancestry, English/Irish/Scottish ancestry, other), education level 
(elementary, secondary, post-secondary), body mass index (BMI) 
2 years prior to interview (continuous), total daily energy intake 
(in kilocalories, continuous), and cigarette smoking. Cigarette 
smoking was modeled using three variables as suggested by 
Leffondré et al. (45), i.e., (i) ever smoked (yes or no); (ii) natural 
logarithm of cigarette-years (number of cigarettes smoked per 
day multiplied by smoking duration in years, continuous); and 
(iii) time since cessation (in years, continuous). Potential con-
founding by other variables, including income, cumulative intake 
of alcoholic beverages, and exposure to asbestos at work (46), 
was evaluated by a 10% change-in-estimate criterion, and none 
of those covariates were empirical confounders in this dataset. 
Effect modification by sex and by lifetime smoking intensity was 
examined by including relevant cross-products in the multivariate 
models. Tests for linear trend across intake tertiles were carried 
out by modeling nutrient intake tertiles as continuous variables. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 (47).

sample Description
A description of study participants is provided in Table 1. 
Cases and controls were similar with respect to age but differed 
significantly on sociodemographic characteristics, their reliance 
on proxy respondents, BMI, history of cigarette smoking, and 
lifetime alcohol intake. As compared to controls, cases were more 
likely to be of French ancestry and to be less educated. Proxy 
respondents provided information for a significantly larger pro-
portion of cases than controls. Compared to controls, cases were 
more likely to have ever smoked and to have greater values for 
cigarette-years, and were less likely to be former smokers. The dis-
tribution of histological subtypes differed by sex. Among males, 
a similar proportion of cases had been diagnosed with squamous 
cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, while adenocarcinoma was 
the most prevalent tumor histology among women.
Median intake values of selected antioxidants among cases and 
controls are presented in Table 2. Among both men and women, 
and for all antioxidants studied, cases had lower median daily 
intakes than controls.
correlation between individual 
Micronutrients
As expected, most individual micronutrients were highly cor-
related with one another (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). 
One notable exception was lycopene, which showed correlation 
coefficients with other micronutrients ranging from 0.34 to 
0.50, whereas the correlation between the other micronutrients 
ranged from 0.52 to 0.94. This high level of collinearity impeded 
our ability to estimate the independent effect of each micronutri-
ent on lung cancer risk, and this should be kept in mind when 
interpreting the results.
Main effects
Table 3 presents adjusted ORs for lung cancer associated with 
medium and high, versus low intake levels of energy-adjusted 
micronutrients. Sex did not emerge as an effect modifier of the 
association between micronutrients and lung cancer, with P val-
ues for the interaction terms ranging from 0.389 for α-carotene to 
0.925 for β-cryptoxanthin in the fully adjusted models; therefore, 
results based on the entire sample are presented, after adjust-
ment for sex. When compared to those with low levels of intake, 
subjects in the highest intake level of β-carotene, α-carotene, 
β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and vitamin C had a statistically 
significant lower risk of lung cancer. For all these micronutrients 
except vitamin C, significant dose–response trends were observed.
associations by cumulative smoking 
intensity
Tables 4 and 5 show associations between micronutrient intakes 
and lung cancer risk by cumulative smoking intensity, in men 
and women, respectively. Results are presented separately for 
men and women since cumulative smoking intensity varied 
substantially between sexes, and the sample included a sub-
stantial group of never smoking women for whom potential 
confounding by smoking would not be an issue. As well, although 
most nutrient-smoking intensity interaction terms did not reach 
statistical significance, with P values in the fully adjusted models 
ranging between 0.046 for β-cryptoxanthin in women and 0.910 
for vitamin C in men, stratified results allow for comparison with

recent studies (31). As very few men had never smoked, never and 
light smokers were combined into a single category. In almost all 
strata, the point estimates were lower in the high micronutrient 
category than in the low micronutrient category, although not 
all of these were statistically significantly lower. In general, the 
strongest protective effects in men were observed among heavy 
intensity smokers, whereas in women, they occurred among 
intermediate intensity smokers. Among men who were never 
and light smokers, the only statistically significant association 
was observed among those in the second intake level of lutein/
zeaxanthin, who were at greater risk of lung cancer compared 
to those in the lowest intake level. There were no significant 
associations among men who smoked at intermediate intensity 
levels. Heavy smoking men were at lesser risk of lung cancer 
when consuming high intakes of all micronutrients, although 
a statistically significant inverse association was found only for 
β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene. There 
were no significant associations among women who never 
smoked, although it should be noted that numbers of subjects 
were small. Among women in the intermediate smoking intensity 
category, intakes in the third tertile of β-carotene and second 
tertiles of β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and vitamin C were

associated with a lower lung cancer risk, while both medium 
and high intakes of vitamin C showed an inverse relationship in 
heavy smoking women. Two-sided tests for trend assessing the 
dose–response relationship were significant at the 0.05 level for 
β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene in heavy 
smoking men, as well as for vitamin C in heavy smoking women.
associations by histological subtype 
of the Tumor
Odds ratios for the association between micronutrient intakes 
and each of the four most common histological subtypes of lung 
cancer are presented in Table 6. There were no clear differences 
in the patterns of results between squamous cell carcinoma, 
adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. While there was 
some variation in the point estimates, the confidence limits for 
any given micronutrient overlapped considerably between the 
histologic subtypes. When compared to subjects in the lowest 
tertile level of intake, those with the highest intake levels of 
β-carotene, α-carotene, lycopene, and vitamin C had a statisti-
cally significant lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma, while 
both medium and high intakes of β-cryptoxanthin suggested 
a protective effect for this histological subtype. High intakes of 
β-carotene and α-carotene were associated with a reduced risk 
of adenocarcinoma, while both medium and high intakes of 
β-cryptoxanthin and lycopene suggested a protective effect for 
small cell carcinoma. High intakes of all other antioxidants were 
associated with a non-significant decrease in risk of squamous 
cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma, save 
for lutein/zeaxanthin which was related to a slightly increased 
risk of small cell carcinoma. High intakes of β-carotene, 
β-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, and vitamin C were 
similarly associated with statistically non-significant increases in 
risk of large cell carcinoma, although it should be noted that these 
results were based on relatively few cases. Statistically significant 
trends (two-sided, P < 0.05) for a lower risk of squamous cell 
carcinoma were observed with increased levels of β-carotene, 
α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and vitamin C, and simi-
larly between adenocarcinoma and β-carotene and α-carotene, as 
well as between small cell carcinoma and both β-cryptoxanthin 
and lycopene.
associations for selected Fruit and 
Vegetable groups
To facilitate comparisons with other studies and describe the 
relevant food sources in our population, we also evaluated 
whether specific fruit and vegetable groups high in carotenoids 
and vitamin C were associated with lung cancer risk. We observed 
that medium and high weekly intakes of fruits, vegetables, crucif-
erous vegetables, and citrus fruits, as well as medium intake levels 
of tomato products and high intakes of carrot products were 
inversely related to lung cancer risk (Table S3 in Supplementary 
Material).
DiscUssiOn
In our study, high dietary intakes of β-carotene, α-carotene, 
β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and vitamin C were associated with a 
decreased risk of lung cancer in main effects analyses. Findings 
for β-carotene concord with those of a recent meta-analysis in 
which a pooled relative risk of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.68–0.87) was 
reported (36). Our results also give credence to a protective 
role of several other dietary carotenoids on lung cancer and 
for which evidence was judged to be too limited to draw firm 
conclusions by the WCRF (7). We found that high intakes of 
lycopene, a carotenoid which is derived from food sources that 
tend to differ from those of other carotenoids and vitamin C, 
lowered the risk of lung cancer. To our knowledge, only one 
previous study also reported such an association (27). We also 
found an inverse association between high intakes of vitamin 
C and lung cancer risk, a finding in line with two studies (33, 
35) but at odds with another (31). We did not observe that high

intakes of lutein/zeaxanthin significantly lowered the risk of lung 
cancer, a finding that contrasts with several observational studies 
(12, 15, 23, 25, 26). A defining characteristic of these studies 
is that, unlike ours, most were conducted in men exclusively. 
Nonetheless, there was no indication of effect modification by 
sex in our study.
Our study is one of the few to have investigated the role 
of individual antioxidants in separate strata of smoking inten-
sity (20, 22, 27, 31), and the first to simultaneously control 
for lifetime intensity and time since quitting smoking, two 
important dimensions of smoking history for lung cancer 
(48). Although the interactions between micronutrients and 
smoking intensity were not statistically significant, stratifica-
tion by cumulative smoking intensity is an improvement over 
previous studies in which analyses were stratified by smoking 
status only (i.e., never/former/current smoking) (49), since 
the former approach is likely to result in more homogenous 
groups of smokers than the latter. We found that high intakes 
of β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene 
were associated with a reduction in lung cancer risk among 
male heavy smokers, while vitamin C reduced the risk of lung 
cancer among female heavy smokers. This suggests that heavy 
intensity smokers, who suffer from high oxidative stress due to 
smoking and are at a disproportionate risk of developing lung 
cancer, can benefit from high intakes of selected antioxidants. 
Our findings are in line with a number of previous studies. 
In one study, the associations between antioxidants and lung 
cancer were stronger among heavy smokers than among never 
or light smokers, although there was no significant interaction 
with smoking (31). In another, an inverse association between 
serum carotenoid levels and lung cancer death was observed 
among smokers, but not among never/former smokers (50).

Our findings for β-carotene are at odds with those from the 
CARET (51) and the ATBC (52) randomized controlled trials 
in which β-carotene supplementation in smokers was associ-
ated with an increase in lung cancer incidence. However, these 
associations disappeared when subsequent analyses considered 
a longer follow-up post-trial (53, 54). Our results regarding 
never smoking women concord with previous studies (16, 
28), although based on small numbers. Furthermore, our data 
suggest a preventive effect of vitamin C against lung cancer in 
women who have never smoked, an association which, to our 
knowledge, has not been reported previously. We also found that 
women whose cumulative smoking history ranged from 1 to 850 
cigarette-years benefited from intakes in the third tertile level 
of β-carotene and in the second tertile level of β-cryptoxanthin, 
lycopene, and vitamin C, findings not reported before.
In analyses stratified by histological subtype, we found 
similar patterns of results by the three most common tumor 
subtypes, with selected antioxidants being inversely related to 
risk. We observed that high intakes of β-carotene, α-carotene, 
β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and vitamin C were associated with a 
reduced risk of squamous cell carcinoma, while high intakes of 
β-carotene and α-carotene lowered the risk of adenocarcinoma, 
and both medium and high intakes of β-cryptoxanthin and 
lycopene reduced the risk of small cell carcinoma. Our results 
pertaining to risk of squamous cell carcinoma and β-carotene 
(36), β-cryptoxanthin (26, 32), and vitamin C intakes (20, 26, 33) 
are comparable to those observed in earlier studies. We found 
statistically non-significant associations between high intakes 
of β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, 
and vitamin C and an increased risk of large cell carcinoma.

Antioxidants and Lung Cancer Risk
Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org
February 2017 | Volume 7 | Article 23
To our knowledge, our study is the first to report on dietary 
antioxidant intakes and risk of large cell carcinoma, a rarer 
histological subtype (2).
In addition to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids and vita-
min C may act to prevent lung carcinogenesis through different 
mechanisms. For instance, the pro-vitamin A carotenoids such 
as β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin can be metabo-
lized into vitamin A and play a role in cell differentiation (9). 
β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene 
may also inhibit cancerous cell proliferation and contribute to 
cell-to-cell communication (55–58). In addition, β-carotene and 
vitamin C have been shown to stimulate apoptosis (57, 59), while 
α-carotene is thought to inhibit the promotion of carcinogenesis 
(55, 60). It is therefore conceivable that exposure to carotenoids 
and vitamin C could play a role in preventing carcinogenesis at 
different points during the lifetime, which makes them prime 
candidates for lung cancer prevention.
Fruits and vegetables containing carotenoids and vitamin 
C are also rich in other nutrients and phytochemicals which 
could be responsible for their observed protective role against 
lung cancer. For example, dithiolthiones and isothiocyanates 
found in cruciferous vegetables and vegetables from the Allium 
genus increase the activity of enzymes involved in carcinogen 
detoxification (7, 61, 62). Selenium, an essential element, acts 
as a co-factor for glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme known to 
protect membranes from oxidation and which also plays a role 
in carcinogen detoxification (63, 64). Flavonoids are also found 
in fruits and vegetables, and in our study population, we previ-
ously observed a reduced lung cancer risk with intake of some 
flavonoid subclasses (65). Our results regarding selected groups 
of fruits and vegetables high in a diversity of chemopreventive 
micronutrients support their protective role against lung cancer. 
This is somewhat at odds with results from a recent case–control 
study conducted in Spain, which found no statistically significant 
reduction in lung cancer risk associated with consumption of 
selected fruit and vegetable groups (66) but concords with find-
ings from large meta-analyses (7, 8, 49, 67). One should therefore 
keep in mind that although dietary intake of carotenoids and

vitamin C may help prevent lung cancer, they could also be sur-
rogates for other protective compounds found in selected fruit 
and vegetables.
Important strengths of our study include the large sample 
size which allowed for stratification by smoking intensity, for 
studying specific sources of antioxidants, for examining the 
impact of diet on different tumor histological subtypes, and 
for comprehensive control of potential confounding by smok-
ing. Good coverage of the case population in the area and the 
use of incident, histologically confirmed primary lung cancer 
cases are also key strengths of our study. Advantages specific 
to our FFQ are that it contained an extensive food list and was 
specifically designed to cover major carotenoid and vitamin C 
sources in the study population. We also used updated local 
nutrient databases to carry out the conversion from food to 
nutrient intake.
This study also has some limitations. It would have been of 
interest to study associations in light of disease aggressiveness, 
but this information was not available. While the case and control 
participation rates were high, it is still possible that participating 
controls were more health conscious than the general popula-
tion, thus biasing risk estimates away from the null. As well, 
proxy respondents provided answers for almost 40% of lung 
cancer cases which could have resulted in measurement error. 
However, sensitivity analyses indicated that associations between 
antioxidants and lung cancer did not differ considerably whether 
we considered self-respondents only or proxy respondents as 
well. Unmeasured changes in dietary patterns over time are 
another possible source of bias, although diet has been shown 
to be relatively stable over time (44). The study was presented 
to potential and actual participants as a study on environmental 
factors and the collection of food intake data was one of many 
themes covered during the interview. These precautions should 
have reduced the risk that subjects would self-select into the 
study or report intakes based on their perception of the role of 
antioxidants on their health status. Finally, although the diet 
questionnaire focused on the period 2 years prior to diagnosis, 
cases might have been influenced by their illness when reporting 
their dietary habits.
Measurement error in dietary intakes inevitably occurred in 
the study. The FFQ used here was adapted from widely used 
validated questionnaires (39, 44), which served to develop 
other FFQ validated and used in various Canadian and Québec 
populations (38, 68, 69). However, it was not comprehensively 
tested for reliability and validity in the present study population. 
Measurement error also likely stemmed from the grouping of 
more than one food into a single statement, from the lack of 
information on the exact quantities of foods consumed and on 
whether foods were consumed cooked or not, and from the 
relatively broad categories from which subjects could choose to 
report their intake frequency. We elected to assign mid-point 
values to each closed category; true intake values might have 
been close or far from these. Nutrient values attributed to each 
statement represented the average nutrient content of a food item 
selected from the statement and under a certain form such as 
raw or cooked, a choice based on Canadian and Québec food 
consumption statistics (70, 71). While each of these limitations 
may have contributed to exposure misclassification, it was likely 
non-differential with respect to case–control status, thereby 
attenuating associations. Non-differential misclassification of an 
exposure with more than two categories may theoretically lead 
to bias away from the null, but this requires misclassification 
between two non-adjacent categories, an extreme situation that 
is unlikely to be present in our data (72). Furthermore, it is 
highly unlikely that a trend would be reversed by such non-
differential misclassification (73). The possibility also remains 
that the dietary data collected with the FFQ better reflected more 
recent intakes than remote ones. It could be hypothesized that 
this latter exposure would be more etiologically relevant with 
respect to lung cancer development which occurs over many 
years. Nonetheless, antioxidants are suspected to play a protective 
role at different times in carcinogenesis. Indeed, antioxidants can 
inhibit both initiation and promotion stages of tumorigenesis 
by protecting cells against oxidative damage (74, 75). Therefore, 
despite the fact that our FFQ assessed more recent antioxidant 
intakes, it remains a useful measurement tool to capture an 
effect at the promotion stage.
Finally, although careful attention was given to the control 
for smoking by using an algorithm shown to be superior to 
many others in this specific study population (45), residual 
confounding due to smoking cannot be excluded. Such 
confounding, if present, could have produced bias toward the 
null in the estimated associations between nutrient intake and 
lung cancer risk. However, such a bias could not explain the 
associations, albeit non-significant ones, observed among the 
stratum of non-smoking women. We also tested a range of 
other potential confounding variables such as income, lifetime 
alcohol intake, and exposure to asbestos, which ultimately were 
not included in our models because of a lack of effect on the 
associations.
Overall, our findings contribute both new knowledge and 
confirmatory data to the as yet inconclusive body of evidence on 
the hypothesized associations between high intakes of individual 
carotenoids and vitamin C, and lung cancer risk. They suggest a 
protective effect of selected antioxidants against lung cancer in 
general, for different smoking intensity groups and particularly 
heavy smokers, and for the squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, and 
small cell histological tumor subtypes. Even though smoking 
remains the strongest predictor of lung cancer risk, it appears 
desirable, in light of these findings, to further promote consump-
tion of fruits and vegetables rich in carotenoids and vitamin 
C to reduce the lung cancer burden among both smokers and 
non-smokers.
