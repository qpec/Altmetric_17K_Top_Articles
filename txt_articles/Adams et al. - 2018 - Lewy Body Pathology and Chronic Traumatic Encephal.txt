Abstract
Traumatic brain injury has been associated with increased risk of
Parkinson disease and parkinsonism, and parkinsonism and Lewy
body disease (LBD) can occur with chronic traumatic encephalopa-
thy (CTE). To test whether contact sports and CTE are associated
with LBD, we compared deceased contact sports athletes (n ¼ 269)
to cohorts from the community (n ¼ 164) and the Boston University
Alzheimer disease (AD) Center (n ¼ 261). Participants with CTE
and LBD were more likely to have b-amyloid deposition, dementia,
and parkinsonism than CTE alone (p < 0.05). Traditional and hierar-
chical clustering showed a similar pattern of LBD distribution in
CTE compared to LBD alone that was most frequently neocortical,
limbic, or brainstem. In the community-based cohort, years of con-
tact sports play were associated with neocortical LBD (OR ¼ 1.30
per year, p ¼ 0.012), and in a pooled analysis a threshold of >8 years
of play best predicted neocortical LBD (ROC analysis, OR ¼ 6.24,
95% CI ¼ 1.5–25, p ¼ 0.011), adjusting for age, sex, and APOE e4
allele status. Clinically, dementia was significantly associated with
neocortical LBD, CTE stage, and AD; parkinsonism was associated
with LBD pathology but not CTE stage. Contact sports participation
may increase risk of developing neocortical LBD, and increased
LBD frequency may partially explain extrapyramidal motor symp-
toms sometimes observed in CTE.

INTRODUCTION
Mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) sustained during
contact athletics are increasingly recognized as a public health
concern. An estimated 1.6–3.8 million concussions occur an-
nually in the United States, with American football, hockey,
soccer, and lacrosse accounting for the greatest incidence of
sports-related concussions (1). Head impacts in contact sports
that do not result in clinical symptoms (i.e. subconcussive
injury) may still result in neuronal injury. In fact, years of
play of a contact sport regardless of concussion history is

 associated with imaging abnormalities (2–5) and with the
pathological stage of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)
(6–9). Participants in contact sports may be at increased risk
of developing neurodegenerative diseases in addition to CTE,
such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (1,10), Parkinson dis-
ease, and parkinsonism (11). The severity and number of TBIs
necessary for altering risk for neurodegenerative diseases are
currently unknown.
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a neurodegenera-
tive disease associated with repetitive head impacts (RHI),
typically sustained through exposure to contact sports (6–9).
Clinically, CTE is characterized by abnormalities in behavior
(e.g. explosivity, impulsivity, physical and verbal violence,
disinhibition), mood (e.g. hopelessness, suicidality, anxiety,
and apathy), cognition (e.g. impairment in memory, executive
function, attention and concentration, dementia), and motor
function (e.g. ataxia, parkinsonism) (12). Distinguishing CTE
clinically can be difficult because of its symptomatic overlap
with other neurological diseases, including Alzheimer disease
(AD) dementia and Parkinson disease (PD). In addition, co-
morbid pathologies are common in CTE (8,13). Therefore, de-
termining the pathologies that underlie the clinical heteroge-
neity in CTE is important for understanding pathogenesis and
to aid clinical diagnosis and eventually target treatment.
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is diagnosed neuro-
pathologically by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated
and aggregated tau in neurons, astrocytes, and cell processes
around small vessels and in the depths of the cerebral sulci
(14). In American football players, the number of years of con-
tact sports play significantly predicts the severity of tau pa-
thology in the dorsolateral frontal cortex and the CTE stage
(7,9). In addition, RHI may accelerate and alter the deposition
and pathological progression of other neurodegenerative pro-
teins. For example, individuals with a history of RHI and neu-
ropathological diagnosis of CTE accumulate b-amyloid (Ab)
at a younger age and at an accelerated rate compared to a gen-
eral autopsy cohort (8).
Traumatic brain injury has also been associated with the
development of PD (15–19). In 2016, Crane et al found an as-
sociation between TBI with loss of consciousness greater than
1 hour occurring before 25 years of age and increased risk of
cortical Lewy bodies in pooled brain banks from community
aging cohorts. They further found a clinical association be-
tween TBI with loss of consciousness and incident PD in 1 co-
hort and progression of parkinsonian signs in 2 others (11). In
addition, retrospective analysis of a large veteran cohort found
that a history of TBI, including mild TBI, was associated with
increased risk of PD (19). To date, however, the role of RHI
associated with contact sports and CTE in the development of
Lewy bodies and parkinsonism is unknown.
The deposition of Lewy bodies within the central ner-
vous system is regionally selective and appears to involve a
limited number of stereotyped patterns (20,21). Lewy body
disease (LBD) pathology can be classified as brainstem,
limbic (transitional), neocortical (diffuse), or amygdala-
predominant (21). This classification, however, may insuffi-
ciently describe the Lewy pathology for some individuals.
Toledo et al, for example, assessed Lewy body pathology in 2
large cohorts of participants using hierarchical clustering to
group pathological patterns and found additional patterns of
deposition. Moreover, the presence of AD is associated with
increased frequency and a distinct pattern of LBD, suggesting
that coincident neurodegenerative disease can affect the devel-
opment of LBD (22,23).
Both trauma and the presence of CTE pathology may in-
fluence a-synuclein deposition. Enhanced a-synuclein deposi-
tion may, in turn, explain the motor symptoms that sometimes
occur in CTE. We hypothesized that participants with CTE
have an altered regional distribution of LBD, that a history of
exposure to RHI is associated with the development of neocor-
tical LBD, and that participants with coincident CTE and
LBD experience more severe clinical deterioration. We
assessed the presence and distribution of Lewy body pathol-
ogy in the brains of a total of 694 participants drawn from 3
distinct brain donation groups and tested associations between
RHI, neuropathological diagnosis, and LBD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
A total of 694 autopsy participants from 3 distinct brain
donation groups were neuropathologically evaluated for neu-
rodegenerative disease using previously published selection
criteria and protocols (21). Of those, 269 were participants
with a history of exposure to contact sports, including football,
ice hockey, boxing, soccer, rugby, and martial arts at either
the professional or the amateur level, recruited by the
“Understanding Neurologic Injury and Traumatic Encepha-
lopathy (UNITE)” study at the Veteran’s Affairs-Boston Uni-
versity-Concussion Legacy Foundation (VA-BU-CLF) brain
bank (UNITE group) (24). For a majority of brain donations,
next-of-kin contacted the brain bank to donate near the time of
death or following death. Other brain donors were referred by
medical examiners, recruited by the Concussion Legacy Foun-
dation, or agreed to donation during life through the Brain Do-
nation Registry. Inclusion criteria were broad to optimize
generalizability and only included a history of RHI exposure.
A second group consisted of 261 participants from Boston
University’s Alzheimer Disease Center (ADC) brain bank.
The BU ADC enrolls and clinically follows participants with
mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia, and normal cogni-
tion, where they undergo annual cognitive evaluations accord-
ing to the National Alzheimer’s Disease Coordinating Center
(NACC) protocol (25). A subset agrees to brain donation at
the end of life; a-synuclein immunohistochemistry began rou-
tinely in 2003, and only participants who died since that time
were included in this study. Finally, 164 participants were
from the brain bank of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), a
community-based aging cohort that consists of the longitudi-
nally followed participants and their offspring. FHS partici-
pants that had agreed to brain donation and whose next-of-kin
had completed an extensive RHI and sports questionnaire
identical to that used in the UNITE study (24) were included.
Consent for brain donation and research participation
was provided by donor next-of-kin; institutional review board
approval for brain donation was granted from both the Boston
University Medical Center and the Edith Nourse Rogers
Adams et al

 Memorial Veterans Hospital, Bedford, MA. The Boston Uni-
versity Medical Center IRB also granted approval for post-
mortem clinical record review, neuropathological evaluation,
and clinical interviews with donor family members.
Clinical Assessment
For UNITE participants, RHI history, athletic or mili-
tary service history, history of cognitive, mood, and behavior
changes, and clinical status leading up to death were assessed
via postmortem interviews with informants and through online
surveys and medical record review as described previously
(24). RHI exposure was defined by the total numbers of years
a contact sport was played. All interviews were conducted by
neurologists and neuropsychologists trained to assess for RHI
exposure and neurodegenerative diseases, and all interviews
were conducted blinded to the results of the neuropathological
examination. To obtain additional clinical information, medi-
cal record review was performed (16). In FHS, an identical
athletic history assessment to UNITE was performed with the
donor’s next-of-kin. Athletic history was not available for BU
ADC participants. For all studies, the presence of dementia
was determined in a subset of participants by a panel of neu-
rologists and neuropsychologists after review of medical and
study records. A diagnosis of dementia was based on DSM-IV
criteria. Within the ADC and UNITE, the presence or absence
of parkinsonism was determined by a panel of neurologists
and neuropsychologists during life (ADC) or after death
(UNITE) following review of medical and study records.
Pathological Assessment
Neuropathological processing followed the procedures
previously established for the VA-BU-CLF brain bank, which
included a comprehensive analysis designed to screen for neu-
rodegenerative conditions (24,26). The neuropathological di-
agnosis of CTE was made using the NINDS consensus criteria
for CTE that include the presence of abnormal perivascular
accumulations of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) in neurons,
astrocytes, and cell processes in an irregular and patchy distri-
bution concentrated at the depths of cortical sulci (14). The
stage of CTE, graded from stage I to IV, was based on the ex-
tent and severity of the ptau pathology as previously described
(7). The diagnosis for AD was made based on National Insti-
tute of Aging (NIA) Reagan criteria and included intermediate
or high probability (27); a diagnosis of AD thus required suffi-
cient pathology to meet at least the diagnostic threshold for
classification as intermediate probability. Evaluation for dif-
fuse and neuritic plaques was by 4G8 (BioLegend, San Diego,
CA) and Bielschowsky silver staining, respectively, and char-
acterized as being present or absent. The revised NIA-
Alzheimer Association AD pathological criteria (21) were not
applied due to the retrospective nature and size of the study
groups. Diagnoses for frontotemporal lobar degeneration
and LBD were made based on accepted pathological criteria
(21,28).
Lewy bodies were assessed on LHE as well as with a-
synuclein immunohistochemistry within the olfactory bulb
and tract, medulla, midbrain, amygdala, entorhinal cortex,
anterior cingulate gyrus, and dorsolateral frontal cortex. LBD
pathology was classified as brainstem-predominant, limbic
(transitional), neocortical (diffuse), or amygdala-predominant
(21). In addition, participants with Lewy bodies limited to the
olfactory bulb were classified as olfactory-predominant.
Within each region, the degree of Lewy body pathology was
semi-quantitatively assessed on a scale of 0–3. Regions in
which no Lewy bodies were observed were scored “0”, 1–2
Lewy bodies were scored “1”, 3–4 Lewy bodies were scored
“2”, and 5 or more Lewy bodies were scored “3” per 200�
magnification.
Immunohistochemistry
Human
tissue
was
fixed
in
periodate-lysine-
paraformaldehyde, tissue blocks were paraffin-embedded, and
sections were cut at 10 mm for immunohistochemistry. Anti-
gen retrieval for a-synuclein and b-amyloid was performed
with formic acid treatment for 2 minutes. Sections were incu-
bated overnight at 4�C with antibodies to a-synuclein (rabbit
polyclonal; Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 1:15,000), phosphory-
lated PHF-tau (AT8; Pierce Endogen, Rockford, IL; 1:2000),
Ab (4G8; BioLegend; 1:100,000), and pTDP-43 (pS409/410
mouse monoclonal; Cosmo Bio Co, Tokyo, Japan; 1:2000).
Following 3 washes with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4),
sections were treated with biotinylated secondary antibody
and labeled with a 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol HRP substrate kit
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sections were
then counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin (Vector Laborato-
ries H-3401) and subsequently coverslipped using Permount
mounting medium (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).
Quantitative ELISA Measurement of
a-Synuclein, Ab, and Tau
Frozen human frontal cortex primary gray matter was
weighed and placed on dry ice. Freshly prepared, ice-cold 5 M
Guanidine Hydrochloride in Tris-buffered saline (20 mM Tris-
HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 TBS) containing 1:100 Halt prote-
ase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific) and 1:100 Phospha-
tase inhibitor cocktail 2 & 3 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was
added to the brain tissue at 5:1 ratio and homogenized with
Qiagen Tissue Lyser LT (Qiagen Inc., Germantown, MD) at
50 Hz for 5 minutes. The homogenate was then shaken (regu-
lar rocker) overnight at room temperature. The lysate was di-
luted with 1% Blocker A (Meso Scale Discovery (MSD)
#R93BA-4, Rockville, MD) in wash buffer in accordance with
the specific ELISA assays: 1:4000 for a-synuclein (MSD
#K151TGD-2), 1:300 for total tau and tau phosphorylated at
threonine 231 (pTau231; MSD #K15121D-2), and 1:4000 for
b-amyloids 1-40 and 1-42 (MSD #K15200E-2). Samples were
subsequently spun down at 17,000 g and 4�C for 15 minutes,
and the supernatant was applied to the ELISA assays. A stan-
dard sandwich ELISA was used to measure tau phosphory-
lated at threonine 181 (pTau181), with the capturing antibody
as AT270 against pTau181 (Thermo Scientific #MN1050) and
a well-characterized T46 antibody against total tau as the
detecting antibody (Thermo Scientific). Sulfo-tag conjugated
anti-mouse secondary antibody (MSD) was used for signal

 detection by the MSD platform, and an MSD SECTOR S 600
Imager was used to measure analyte levels.
Microscopic Analysis of Tau Density
A tissue block from the dorsolateral frontal cortex was
taken perpendicular to the superior frontal sulcus, embedded
in paraffin, and cut at 10 lm. As it is often the earliest locus of
CTE pathology, a tissue block taken from the dorsolateral
frontal cortex is part of the standardized protocol used to as-
sess for CTE (14). Because of its early involvement, tau pa-
thology in the dorsolateral frontal cortex is a sensitive measure
of CTE tau density, and increased tau burden in this region of-
ten heralds involvement of other brain regions (29). Slides
immunostained for tau (AT8; Pierce Endogen) were scanned
at 20� magnification with a Leica Aperio Scanscope (Leica
Biosystems, Richmond, IL), and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)
density was determined as previously described (9). Briefly,
using ImageScope (Leica Biosystems), the gray matter was
highlighted from the pia to the boundary between the white
and gray matters. Leica’s image analysis and automated
counting software (Aperio nuclear algorithm, Version 9, Leica
Biosystems) was calibrated for shape, size, and staining inten-
sity to detect AT8-immunoreactive NFTs within the region of
interest. Counts were normalized to the area measured and are
presented as density within the analyzed region.
APOE Genotyping
DNA was extracted from brain tissue samples using a
Qiagen QIAamp DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (National Center for
Biotechnology Information SNPs rs429358 and rs7412) were
examined using TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Allelic discrimination was automated using the
manufacturer’s software. Positive controls, consisting of DNA
for each APOE allele, were included on each plate and geno-
typed with restriction isotyping.
Statistical Methodology
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version
20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY), Prism v6 (GraphPad Soft-
ware, La Jolla, CA), and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC). A chi-square test for proportions was used to as-
sess differences between cohorts with respect to demographic
and neuropathological characteristics and between CTE pa-
thology groups with respect to clinical and exposure measures
and frequency of LBD type. As age is a known driver of neu-
rodegenerative pathology and no participants age <50 years
old were found to have Lewy bodies or AD, comparisons be-
tween CTE pathology groups were restricted to participants
with age at death >50 years in Table 2. We used a 2-sample
chi-square test to assess the frequency of Lewy body pathol-
ogy between brain bank groups and between groups with coin-
cident pathology, using Bonferroni correction to account for
multiple comparisons. To evaluate levels of a-synuclein,
Ab1-40, Ab1-42, pTau231, pTau181, and the density of NFTs
between groups, we applied an ANOVA with post-hoc Bon-
ferroni multiple comparisons testing. Although variation in
these measures is not uniformly normal, ANOVA is robust to
the non-normality of errors (30).
We used unbiased hierarchical clustering to assess the
similarity between participants in their regional distribution of
Lewy body pathology. Using this method, all participants with
LBD semiquantitative scores in the selected regions of inter-
est, irrespective of cohort or pathology coincident with LBD,
were compared to one another; participants with greater simi-
larity in regional distribution of Lewy bodies aligned (i.e.
clustered) more closely, and participants branched increas-
ingly farther apart from one another had increasing dissimilar-
ity in their regional Lewy body patterning. Binary logistic
regression analyses were applied to test associations between
predictors (age, sex, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4, contact
sports exposure, and pathology) and the outcomes of neocorti-
cal Lewy body pathology, dementia, and parkinsonism.
Pooled analyses were performed controlling for cohort and the
interaction between cohort and contact sports play where
indicated.
RESULTS
Participant groups varied by demographics, RHI expo-
sure, and pathology at death (Table 1). On average, UNITE
participants were considerably younger with a greater propor-
tion of males than the FHS or ADC cohorts. As expected, par-
ticipants in the UNITE group also had a significantly greater
number of years of exposure to contact sports compared to the
FHS cohort (contact sports history was not available for
ADC). Percentages listed in Table 1 reflect the percent of indi-
viduals within each cohort with pathology that meets the
threshold diagnostic criteria for each disease. The frequency
of pathology varied between cohorts as expected with the
greatest percentage of pathological control (no significant pa-
thology identified) participants in the FHS cohort, the greatest
percentage of participants with CTE pathology in the UNITE
cohort, and the greatest percentage of participants with a diag-
nosis of AD in the ADC cohort. Across groups, all participants
with CTE had a history of contact sports play. The frequency
of LBD was significantly different between cohorts with the
greatest frequency in the ADC cohort (Table 1). Although
many (n ¼ 86) had CTE, no participants <50 years old had
LBD. Therefore, participants with age of death >50 years old
with CTE were stratified by the presence of Lewy body and
AD pathology in Table 2. Between CTE, CTE-LBD, and
CTE-AD-LBD there were no significant differences in the age
they first started playing contact sports (age of first exposure),
years of exposure to RHI, CTE symptom duration, duration
between age of first exposure to contact sports and symptom
onset (symptom latency), or CTE stage; age at death did sig-
nificantly differ between groups (p ¼ 0.020). CTE-LBD and
CTE-AD-LBD participants were significantly more likely to
have diffuse Ab plaques and dementia than CTE participants
without LBD (p < 0.05), and CTE-AD-LBD participants were
significantly more likely to have neuritic Ab plaques and par-
kinsonism than CTE participants (p < 0.05; Table 2).

Lewy Pathology in CTE
761
 Association Between RHI Exposure and
Neocortical LBD
Because the physical strain following mild TBI and the
tau pathology of CTE are both primarily cortical (7,31), we
hypothesized that LBD associated with RHI would likewise
be cortical. To test the hypothesis that the number of years of
exposure to RHI was associated with the development of neo-
cortical LBD, a binary logistic regression was performed on
FHS and UNITE participants with both APOE genotype and
data on contact sports play. In each model, we included age,
sex, APOE e4 allele frequency, cohort, and an interaction term
between cohort and contact sports play interaction for the cal-
culation of cohort-specific odds ratio (Table 3). There was suf-
ficient overlap in age at death between groups to justify
including age in the model (Supplementary Data Figure S1).
Neocortical LBD was predicted by years of exposure to con-
tact sports with an FHS specific OR ¼ 1.30 (p ¼ 0.012) and a
UNITE specific OR ¼ 1.15 (p ¼ 0.013). A pooled analysis of
the FHS and UNITE brain banks showed that years of expo-
sure to contact sports (OR ¼ 1.07, p ¼ 0.014) and age at death
(OR ¼ 1.05, p ¼ 0.005) significantly predicted the develop-
ment of neocortical LBD, adjusting for APOE e4 and sex.
To investigate the strength of the association between
contact sports and LBD, sensitivity analyses were performed.
Because the mean years of contact sports exposure was much
higher in UNITE (15.1 years) and the effect of contact sports
play was greater in FHS than UNITE, we hypothesized that
there may be a threshold lower level of contact sports expo-
sure. A receiver operating curve analysis showed the highest
C-statistic at a threshold of 8 years of contact sports play.
When this threshold (>8 years vs <8 years of contact sports
play) was used as a binary variable for exposure in the logistic
regression model, neocortical LBD was significantly associ-
ated with higher exposure (>8 years) of contact sports play
(OR ¼ 40.0, p ¼ 0.028) in the FHS cohort, but not in the
UNITE group (OR ¼ 1.71, p ¼ 0.627), adjusting for age, sex,
and APOE e4. However, the confidence intervals are wide,
likely due to sparse data. A pooled analysis demonstrated that
contact sports play >8 years (OR ¼ 6.24, p ¼ 0.011) and age
(OR ¼ 1.06, p ¼ 0.003) were significantly associated with the
development of neocortical LBD, adjusting for sex and APOE
e4 (Table 3). To test whether the associations were present
when only American football was considered, we performed
the pooled analysis on football players and participants
without
contact
sports
history
and
obtained
similar
results.
Separate
analyses
for
brainstem,
limbic,
and
amygdala-predominant LBD did not reveal any significant
associations with years of contact sports play (data not
shown).
Associations Between Coincident Pathology and
Lewy Body Distribution
We next compared the regional distribution of Lewy
bodies between pathological subject groups. Comparing par-
ticipants with LBD, CTE-LBD, AD-LBD, and CTE-AD-
LBD, we found that the pattern of Lewy body deposition pro-
portioned
significantly
differently
between
pathological
groups (v2 ¼ 45.6, p < 0.001) such that participants with LBD
or CTE-LBD had a greater frequency of brainstem LBD and a
lower frequency of amygdala-predominant LBD than AD-
LBD (p < 0.05). Although participants with CTE-AD-LBD
had a nominally greater frequency of neocortical LBD (53%)
than the other groups, no significant difference was observed
after Bonferroni multiple comparison correction (v2 ¼ 4.1,
p ¼ 0.129 for adjusted comparison to AD-LBD; Fig. 1).
To further test whether pathology was associated with a
unique distribution of Lewy bodies, we performed unbiased
hierarchical clustering on all participants with LBD. A similar
analysis was recently performed on LBD participants with and
without AD and yielded 4 main clusters that roughly corre-
sponded with LBD type (22). Our data likewise generated 4
distinct clusters (Fig. 2). Cluster 1 featured the greatest LBD
burden and was largely comprised of participants with Lewy
bodies in all regions studied, including the neocortex. In Clus-
ter 2, LBD was found prominently in the olfactory bulb, sub-
stantia nigra, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and anterior
cingulate with relative sparing of the dorsal motor nucleus of
the vagus nerve. Cluster 3 was comprised of participants with
Lewy body pathology concentrated in the olfactory bulb, dor-
sal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, and substantia nigra
with little pathology in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, ante-
rior cingulate, or dorsolateral frontal cortex. In Cluster 4, LBD
was largely restricted to the olfactory bulb and amygdala.
Each cluster was named to reflect the pathological patterning
of Lewy bodies within that cluster: Cluster 1 was labeled
“neocortical,” Cluster 2 “limbic transitional,” Cluster 3
“brainstem,” and Cluster 4 “olfactory bulb/amygdala.”
The distribution of pathological groups was compared
between clusters (Table 4). No significant differences were
observed in regional distribution of Lewy bodies between
LBD participants and CTE-LBD (v2 ¼ 1.08, p ¼ 0.781). Par-
ticipants with AD-LBD had a significantly different distribu-
tion of LBD from CTE-LBD (v2 ¼ 9.69, p ¼ 0.021) and LBD

 only (v2 ¼ 9.40, p ¼ 0.024) such that a greater proportion of
participants with AD-LBD clustered into the olfactory bulb/
amygdala cluster in comparison to either control-LBD or
CTE-LBD. Participants with CTE-AD-LBD often grouped in
the olfactory/amygdala cluster but were not significantly dif-
ferent from LBD (v2 ¼ 3.41, p ¼ 0.332), AD-LBD (v2 ¼ 1.38,
p ¼ 0.710), or CTE-LBD (v2 ¼ 2.01, p ¼ 0.570). LBD-only
participants most commonly clustered into either the neocorti-
cal (31%) or the olfactory bulb/amygdala (40%) clusters with
lesser representation in the limbic (5%) and brainstem (24%)
clusters. Participants with either AD-LBD or CTE-AD-LBD
had greatest representation in the olfactory bulb/amygdala
cluster, accounting for 54% and 46% of participants in each
pathology group, respectively. Only 8% and 7% of AD-LBD
participants clustered into the limbic and brainstem clusters,
respectively, as did 18% and 9% of participants with CTE-
AD-LBD. The frequency of CTE-LBD in the neocortical and
olfactory bulb/amygdala clusters was equivalent at 32% each,
with 10% and 26% in the limbic and brainstem clusters, re-
spectively. Examined within each cluster, participants with
CTE-LBD have nearly uniformly a lower average age at death
than participants in the other pathology groups. Overall, while
LBD and CTE-LBD clustered similarly to one another, they
clustered distinctly from AD-LBD.
LBD-Associated Alterations in
Neurodegenerative Proteins
Quantitative ELISA was used to measure a-synuclein,
Ab1-40, Ab1-42, pTau231, and pTau181 in the dorsolateral
frontal cortex of control, AD, and CTE participants without
LBD and with neocortical LBD. Levels of a-synuclein varied
significantly by pathology (p ¼ 0.025) and by the presence of
neocortical LBD (p ¼ 0.018, ANOVA) such that the presence
of neocortical LBD was associated with reduced total a-synu-
clein in all pathology groups (Fig. 3A). As expected, AD par-
ticipants had the most Ab1-40; however, no significant
difference was found in Ab1-40 levels between participants
without LBD and those with neocortical LBD within any of
the pathological groups (Fig. 3B). Levels of Ab1-42 varied sig-
nificantly by pathology (p ¼ 0.009) and by the presence of
neocortical LBD (p ¼ 0.040, ANOVA), and Sidak post-hoc
analyses demonstrated that participants with neocortical LBD
had significantly higher levels compared to participants with-
out LBD in the control (p ¼ 0.02) and CTE (p ¼ 0.05) pathol-
ogy groups. In contrast, participants with neocortical LBD and
coincident AD had a non-significant decrease in concentration
of Ab1-42 in comparison to participants with AD but without
LBD (Fig. 3C). Levels of pTau231 were different between
pathological groups (p ¼ 0.032, ANOVA) with increased lev-
els in AD, but did not significantly differ with the presence of
LBD (Fig. 3D). Similarly, levels of pTau181 were different
between pathological groups with increased levels in AD
(p ¼ 0.041, ANOVA) but not by LBD (Fig. 3E). On the other
hand, when the density of AT8-immunopositive NFTs was de-
termined for control, CTE, and CTE-LBD participants, NFT
density was increased in CTE and increased further in CTE
with neocortical LBD (p ¼ 0.038, ANOVA). Multiple com-
parison testing (Dunnett) showed increased NFT density in
CTE-LBD compared to control participants (p ¼ 0.035;
Fig. 3F).
Clinical Associations With Pathology Groups
We tested the relative roles of AD, LBD, and CTE pa-
thology as predictors of dementia or parkinsonism. All FHS
and UNITE participants with neocortical LBD had dementia,
and all FHS and ADC participants with CTE had dementia;
therefore, these variables were not included in the model of
dementia within these cohorts. A binary logistic regression
demonstrated that AD was significantly associated with de-
mentia in the FHS (OR ¼ 5.95, p < 0.001) and ADC (OR ¼
33.4, p < 0.001) studies, adjusting for age and sex. In UNITE,
dementia was significantly associated with CTE stage (OR ¼
1.41 per stage, p ¼ 0.019), adjusting for age at death (OR ¼
1.09, p < 0.001), sex, and AD. In a pooled analysis, dementia
was significantly associated with neocortical LBD (OR ¼
12.1, p < 0.001), AD (OR ¼ 9.69, p < 0.001), and CTE stage
(OR ¼ 1.65 per stage, p < 0.001), adjusting for age at death
(OR ¼ 1.05, p < 0.001), sex, and cohort (Table 5).

 The presence of parkinsonism was assessed in a subset
of the ADC and UNITE participants. Binary logistic regres-
sion analysis showed that in the ADC cohort, parkinsonism
tended to be associated with LBD (any; OR ¼ 2.11,
p ¼ 0.094), adjusting for age, sex, and AD. In UNITE, parkin-
sonism was associated with LBD (OR ¼ 3.44, p ¼ 0.001), but
not CTE stage, adjusting for age and AD. In a pooled analysis,
parkinsonism was again significantly associated with LBD
(OR ¼ 2.82, p < 0.001), but not CTE or AD, adjusting for age,
sex, and cohort (Table 6). Overall, this suggests that extrapyra-
midal motor symptoms are predicted by LBD and not CTE
pathology.
DISCUSSION
We examined the clinical and pathological relation-
ships between RHI exposure, CTE, and LBD within a
group of deceased athletes with RHI exposure (UNITE), a
community-based aging cohort
(FHS), and a
cohort
enriched for AD from the BU ADC. The number of years of
exposure to RHI through contact sports play was associated
with the development of neocortical LBD in the FHS co-
hort, the UNITE cohort, and in a pooled analysis control-
ling for age, sex, and APOE e4 allele status. Among
participants with CTE and LBD, the distribution of Lewy
bodies was most likely to be limbic, neocortical, or

 partially explain the extrapyramidal motor symptoms
sometimes observed in CTE.
Head injuries can occur with a variety of mechanisms
and severity. A recent study demonstrated that a history of a
single TBI with loss of consciousness (LOC) >1 hour was as-
sociated with increased risk of incident PD and a single TBI
with LOC of any duration was associated with the progression
of parkinsonian signs (11). Pathologically, a single TBI with
LOC >1 hour was associated with an increased risk of Lewy
bodies in the frontal and temporal cortical regions. In contrast,
head impacts experienced in contact sports are typically repet-
itive, less severe, and without LOC. In fact, the number of
years of play of contact sports, not concussion history, best
predicts CTE stage and the severity of tau pathology in the
frontal cortex (6,7,9). However, similar to the findings of TBI
with LOC in other brain donation cohorts, we found that years
of exposure to RHI through contact sports play was signifi-
cantly associated with an increase in the odds of having neo-
cortical LBD.
Interestingly, effects were different between a community-
based aging population (FHS) and the UNITE cohort. All
participants in the UNITE cohort had a history of RHI, poten-
tially diminishing its effect due to uniform exposure and range
restriction (32), while relatively few FHS participants had this
history. That years of RHI exposure had a greater association
with neocortical LBD in FHS than in UNITE suggests that
the threshold of RHI exposure necessary to increase the risk of
neocortical LBD is lower than the typical exposure duration in
UNITE
(�15 years).
Receiver
operating
curve
analysis
showed the highest C-statistic at a threshold of 8 years of
contact sports play, and binary logistic regression for pooled
FHS and UNITE groups demonstrated that athletes with
higher exposure (>8 years) of contact sports play were signifi-
cantly more likely to have neocortical LBD than study partici-
pants with less exposure when adjusting for age, APOE e4,
and sex.
Patterns of Lewy Body Deposition
Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the pattern of LBD
deposition was not significantly different between LBD-CTE
and LBD without CTE or AD. LBD-CTE participants were
significantly more likely to have brainstem LBD and less
likely to have amygdala-predominant LBD than AD with
LBD. Similar results were found when we performed unbi-
ased hierarchical clustering to examine the regional distribu-
tion of Lewy body pathology in LBD, AD, and CTE. We
found clusters analogous to those found in a previous analysis
of LBD and AD (22) and that roughly corresponded to neo-
cortical, limbic transitional, brainstem, and olfactory bulb/
amygdala. Thus, Lewy body pathology appears to involve
similar regions in CTE as in LBD alone. It remains to be de-
termined, however, whether regions not evaluated in this
study (e.g. other cortical regions and mammillary bodies) are
specifically affected in CTE. In addition, because our cluster-
ing analysis did not account for variance in age, the equiva-
lent Lewy body distribution that we observe between clusters
is only descriptive of the endpoint, not the progression. In-
deed, within each cluster, participants with CTE-LBD are
nearly uniformly younger at death compared to participants
with other pathology.
LBD and Pathology-Related Changes in
Neurodegenerative Proteins
Levels of neurodegenerative proteins were significantly
altered in frontal cortex in the presence of AD, CTE, or neo-
cortical LBD pathology. a-synuclein is normally abundant in
the presynaptic compartment (33,34), and we found decreased
a-synuclein levels in participants with neocortical LBD,
which may reflect synaptic dysfunction or loss (35–37). Previ-
ous studies have shown that CSF a-synuclein levels are dimin-
ished in participants with LBD compared to controls (38,39).
Participants with neocortical LBD and with coincident neocor-
tical LBD and CTE showed a marked increase in Ab1-42 in
comparison to control and CTE participants without neocorti-
cal LBD, respectively. In AD, there was no significant differ-
ence in Ab1-42 levels with or without LBD, perhaps due to a
ceiling effect from already high levels or because neocortical
LBD lowers the threshold of AD pathology necessary to prog-
ress towards dementia and death (40). Overall, these data con-
firm previous reports demonstrating associations between
LBD and increased Ab (41).
The severity of tau pathology in the dorsolateral frontal
cortex varied by pathological group but not by the presence of
neocortical LBD. Quantitation of AT8-positive NFTs demon-
strated significantly increased NFT density in CTE and CTE-
LBD compared to controls. Levels of tau phosphorylated at
sites 231 or 181 showed increased levels in AD but no signifi-
cant difference between groups with or without neocortical
LBD.
Associations With Clinical Outcomes
Recently, studies of a large clinical veterans cohort
showed an association between mild TBI and both dementia
and PD (42,43). Here we show that the pathologies present at
death were significant predictors of dementia or parkinsonism.
In a pooled analysis, dementia was significantly associated
with neocortical LBD and stage of CTE in addition to AD pa-
thology and age at death. Parkinsonism was significantly asso-
ciated with LBD of any type but not with CTE stage. These
results suggest that the previously reported association be-
tween CTE and aberrant extrapyramidal motor function
(12,44,45) may be due to co-morbid LBD pathology.
It remains to be determined what pathophysiologic
changes underlie other motor aberrancies (e.g. ataxia) ob-
served in CTE that differ from the extrapyramidal motor
symptoms studied here. For example, it has been noted that
the frequency of motor features in professional boxers exceeds
that observed in professional football players, which may be
the result of more severe cerebellar pathology (12). Further
study into how the biomechanics of head trauma and the asso-
ciated pathologies differ between sports may offer further ex-
planation for the broad array of motor symptoms that can be
observed in CTE. In addition, although our recent study did
not show an association with age of first exposure to contact
Adams et al
J Neuropathol Exp Neurol • Volume 77, Number 9, September 2018
766
 sports and the development of LBD, the age of first exposure
may modify the presentation of symptoms (46).
Limitations
There are several limitations inherent to our study popu-
lation and methodology. The athlete participants for the
UNITE study were largely self-selected or referred by next-of-
kin after death and do not represent all individuals who play
contact sports or sustain RHI. Although the FHS brain dona-
tion cohort was recruited from the larger FHS community-
based study, autopsy-based selection bias is still present, as
evidenced by the high rate of neurodegenerative disease. How-
ever, the FHS cohort is likely more representative of contact
sports play in the general population. The 3 cohorts varied sig-
nificantly in mean age at death and sex frequency, which we
attempted to adjust for in our regression analyses. Although
the 3 cohorts were distinct, data was carefully harmonized.
Neuropathological evaluation was performed for all 3 studies
by the same experienced neuropathologists using standard re-
search protocols, and dementia and parkinsonism diagnoses
were obtained by expert clinicians using research-quality
guidelines. Methods for determination of RHI exposure were
standardized across FHS and UNITE; however, they depended
on retrospective review and may have introduced bias. Confi-
dence intervals on the odds ratio were wide for the 8 years of
play threshold due to sparse data, which can inflate estimates,
and therefore the specific ORs are likely not accurate (47). Fu-
ture studies incorporating more participants with neocortical
LBD and contact sports play will be necessary to more accu-
rately determine the best threshold and risk of contact sports
participation. In addition, studies utilizing prospective clinical
data are necessary to confirm and expand associations with
RHI and the clinical timeline of symptoms.
Conclusions
Lewy body distribution was not significantly altered by
co-morbid CTE pathology; however, participants with CTE-
LBD had a younger mean age of death than LBD alone. We
found the number of years an individual was exposed to RHI
through contact sports was associated with the development of
neocortical LBD, and LBD, in turn, was associated with par-
kinsonism and dementia. In pooled analyses, stage of CTE
was independently associated with the presence of dementia,
but not parkinsonism, when controlling for LBD, suggesting
that co-morbid LBD largely accounts for extrapyramidal mo-
tor symptoms in CTE.
