Aims
The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) following 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA). 
Patients and Methods
The New Zealand Joint Registry database was analysed, using revision surgery for PJI at six 
and 12 months after surgery as primary outcome measures. Statistical associations 
between revision for infection, with common and definable surgical and patient factors 
were tested.
Results
A total of 64 566 primary TKAs have been recorded on the registry between 1999 and 2012 
with minimum follow-up of 12 months. Multivariate analysis showed statistically significant 
associations with revision for PJI between male gender (odds ratio (OR) 1.85, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 2.74), previous surgery (osteotomy (OR 2.45 95% CI 1.2 to 
5.03), ligament reconstruction (OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 5.00)), the use of laminar flow (OR 
1.6, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.47) and the use of antibiotic-laden cement (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.13). 
There was a trend towards significance (p = 0.052) with the use of surgical helmet systems 
at six months (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.34).
Conclusion
These findings show that patient factors remain the most important in terms of predicting 
early PJI following TKA. Furthermore, we found no evidence that modern surgical helmet 
systems reduce the risk of PJI and laminar flow systems may actually increase risk in TKA. 
The use of this registry data assists the estimation of the risk of PJI for individual patients, 
which is important for both informed consent and the interpretation of infection rates at 
different institutions. 
T
ake home message: Infection rates in TKA are related to both individual patient and 
surgical factors, and some modern methods of reducing infection may actually increase 
infection risk.

Early advances in reducing the rate of early
peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI) include the
introduction of the Howarth-Charnley enclo-
sure and the development of negative pressure
body exhaust suits (BES) which, in combina-
tion with other modifications of operating
theatres, saw rates of infection fall to 0.3% by
1972.1-4
Other important contributions were made
by the inclusion of prophylactic antibiotics,
which showed a three to four fold reduction in
the rate of infection, as well as having an addi-
tive effect in combination with ultraclean air.5,6
These findings have been replicated widely,
and different combinations of antibiotics have
shown differing degrees of success.7-9
However, despite further modifications of the
procedures, including the introduction of anti-
biotic-laden cement, pre-operative screening,
different antiseptic skin preparation solutions
and iodine-impregnated incision drapes, the
rate of deep infection has not decreased further
and it remains a devastating complication.10-13 
Pressures to make the theatre environment
more efficient and body exhaust suits less
cumbersome, have led to modifications in the
original concepts.14 However, recent studies,
including large registry based analyses, have
 THE IMPACT OF PATIENT AND SURGICAL FACTORS ON THE RATE OF INFECTION AFTER PRIMARY TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY
335
VOL. 98-B, No. 3, MARCH 2016
suggested that the widespread use of modern laminar flow
systems, as well as surgical helmet systems (SHS) or ‘space
suits’ (not necessarily designed to the same negative pres-
sure principles of Charnley) may actually increase the rate
of infection, highlighting the importance of meticulous care
with the incorporation of new unproven technology, how-
ever seemingly similar to older, well established tech-
niques.15 Many studies have also shown patient factors to
be important in the development of infection including gen-
der, age, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities such as dia-
betes or rheumatoid arthritis, and previous surgery to the
involved joint.16-18 Thus, there remain high-risk groups of
patients despite optimisation of all other factors.
A previous study from the New Zealand Joint Registry
(NZJR) used univariate analyses to assess early infection in
both hip and knee arthroplasty with particular reference to
laminar flow and the use of surgical helmet systems, using
data up to 2008.15 The purpose of this study was to revisit
the registry with a further five years of data and to assess
additional patient and other surgical risk factors that may
be associated with PJI, specifically after primary total knee
arthroplasty (TKA). A multivariate analysis was also
performed in an attempt to improve the robustness of any
significant findings.
Patients and Methods
All primary TKAs recorded in the NZJR between 1999 and
2012 were analysed. National ethics committee approval
was obtained and all patients included had previously con-
sented to their data being recorded in the registry. 
The demographic details recorded on the database at the
time of surgery currently include age, gender, American
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score,19 BMI (from
2010 onwards), diagnosis leading to TKA, and previous
surgery to the joint.
Other data recorded for the purpose of this study were
grouped as ‘surgical factors’ and included the experience of
the surgeon (cases per year and grade), the use of computer
navigation, the operating time, the type of hospital (public or
private), the use of laminar flow, surgical helmet systems and
the use of antibiotics both parentally and with cement. The
categories used for the analysis of each factor, and the
number of patients available for analysis in each category, are
shown in Tables I and II. Incomplete recording as well as the

incorporation of new metrics since the inception of the NZJR,
such as the BMI in 2010, has led to incomplete data for some
factors.
The registry records all revision TKAs and the reasons
for revision. This study used revision surgery for PJI as the
outcome of interest. Due to a lack of consensus for a strict
definition of early infection, we analysed revisions for infec-
tion performed within both six and 12 months of the initial
operation, and related them to the patients and surgical fac-
tors recorded at the primary procedure. The rate of
infection was recorded as the number and percentage of
revisions for infection at both periods within each category
for TKA (Tables I and II). Revision was defined as re-
operation with at least one component being revised. Data
were included to the end of 2013, so that all patients had 12
months follow-up post-operatively.
Statistical analysis. The percentages with revision for infec-
tion were compared for patient and surgical factors using
the Pearson chi-squared test. A p-value < 0.05 was consid-
ered to be statistically significant. Odds ratios (OR) with

 THE IMPACT OF PATIENT AND SURGICAL FACTORS ON THE RATE OF INFECTION AFTER PRIMARY TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY
337
VOL. 98-B, No. 3, MARCH 2016
95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated for each
category.
Factors found to be associated (p < 0.10) with revision for
infection at six and 12 months, from the univariate analyses
were further analysed to test for independent associations
using stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses. These
models were run using a forward and backward stepwise
approach to confirm the robustness of the resulting models.
The significant variables remaining in these multivariate
models are presented. SPSS version 22 software (IBM,
Armonk, New York) was used for all statistical calculations.
Results
A total of 64 566 primary TKAs were recorded in the
NZJR between 1999 and 2012, with minimum follow-up
of 12 months, and were available for analysis. The NZJR is
regularly audited and has a rate of compliance of > 97%.
The overall rate of revision for infection was 0.16% at six
months and 0.28% at 12 months. 
Patient factors. On univariate analysis factors related to
revision for infection at six months were male gender
(p = 0.002), BMI (p = 0.04), and previous surgery to the
joint (p = 0.046). At 12 months the patient factors signif-
icant for revision for infection remained the same: male
gender (p < 0.001), BMI (p = 0.03) and previous surgery
(p = 0.011) (Table I).
Male gender appeared to almost double the risk of revi-
sion for infection (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.73 at six
months and OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.43 at 12 months),
and morbidly obese patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m2 had
approximately three times the rate of revision for infection
than patients with BMI < 35 kg/m2 (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.18
to 9.53 at six months and OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.24 to 7.08 at
12 months). Having had previous major surgery (ligament
reconstruction and osteotomy) to the same knee was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of revision for infection by 12
months by between two and three times (ligament recon-
struction OR 2.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 5.53, osteotomy OR
2.72, 95% CI 1.33 to 5.56) (Table I).
Surgical factors. On univariate analysis, surgical factors
related to infection at six months were the use of laminar
flow (p < 0.001, OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.01), surgical
helmet systems (p < 0.001, OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.03)
and the use of antibiotic-laden cement (p = 0.001, OR 2.17,
95% CI 1.35 to 3.50). At 12 months, the only surgical fac-
tor that remained significant for increased revision for
infection was the use of laminar flow (p = 0.021, OR 1.41,
95% CI 1.05 to 1.89) (Table II).
Multivariate analysis. Age, gender, BMI, previous surgery,
laminar flow, surgical helmet systems and antibiotic-laden
cement (six months) were put into the multivariate analysis
as described (p < 0.1 from univariate analysis) and the

factors and ORs which continued to show, or approach sig-
nificance are presented (Table III).
Male gender appeared to remain a strongly significant
risk factor of revision for infection (six months p = 0.002,
12 months p < 0.001) with the risk of revision for infection
nearly double that of female patients at both time points
(six months OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.74, 12 months OR
1.78, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.41) (Table III).
Similarly the use of laminar flow correlated with revision
for infection at both six months (p = 0.033, OR 1.6, 95%
CI 1.04 to 2.47) and 12 months (p = 0.021, OR 1.42, 95%
CI 1.05 to 1.90), indicating that this was an independent
risk factor for infection (Table III).
Previous surgery to the joint also appeared to remain a
strongly significant independent risk factor at 12 months
(p = 0.028). The more complex procedures (ligament recon-
struction (OR 1.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 5.00) and osteotomy
(OR 2.45 95% CI 1.20 to 5.03)) appeared to confer greater
risk.
The use of antibiotic-laden cement remained a significant
factor at six months (p = 0.008, OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.19 to
3.13), but no correlation was seen at 12 months.
There was, however, only a trend (p = 0.052) between the
use of surgical helmet systems and revision for infection at
six months (Table III). There was no association between
the use of these systems and revision for infection at 12
months. 
Discussion
This is the largest registry study to assess patient and surgi-
cal factors related to the development of deep infection
after primary TKA to date. Multivariate analysis showed
significant correlation between male gender, previous
major surgery to the joint, the use of laminar flow and anti-
biotic-laden cement to the risk of revision for infection up
to 12 months post-operatively.
The reason for the increased incidence of infection after
TKA in males is controversial. There are possible factors
related to male gender that are not recorded in the registry
data, and hence not accounted for in the multivariate
analysis. Thus, it is not necessarily male gender that is the
risk factor, which would imply a genetic propensity to
infection, but may relate to aspects of behaviour including
smoking, diet, hygiene, or a higher likelihood of presenting
earlier with symptoms, that are more prevalent amongst
males.18 However, this is now the third large registry based
study to show a significant correlation.17,20 Recently,
Namba et al17 analysed an American registry of 56 216
TKAs, citing a hazard ratio for infection for males under-
going the procedure of 1.89. Analysing the Finnish Arthro-
plasty Register, Jämsen et al20 found the hazard ratio of
infection for males to be 1.54 in primary TKA, and 2.23 in
males undergoing revision surgery, but they also suggested
that “sex differences likely function as a proxy for some
risk factors that could not be further explored with the pre-
sent data”.20 The addition of this study, however,
strengthens the suggestion that male gender is an independ-
ent risk factor for the development of infection, with this
study again indicating they have almost twice the risk.
The finding that previous surgery to the joint increases
infection risk raises interesting questions. The more complex
procedures such as ligament reconstruction and osteotomy
pose the greatest risk. Possible explanations include:
increased time required for TKA due to complexity with lig-
ament balance, a skewing of the data due to the fact that at
risk sub-sets of patients such as males are more likely to have
had previous procedures, surgery through scar tissue, or the
fact that there may be a quiescent infection already within
the region, which becomes clinically apparent after TKA.
This study reiterates the findings of a previous NZJR
paper, finding a persistent increase of infection with the use
of laminar flow, with the addition of six years and over
three times the number the patients available for investiga-
tion, as well as supporting the association using multivari-
ate analysis.15 This is in keeping with a growing body of
evidence, despite initial earlier reports and national clinical
trials.4-6,21-24 One reason for the failure of ultraclean air
systems may be the interposition of personnel between the
air-source and the patient, which has been shown to lead to
up to a 27-fold increase in the rate of bacterial contamina-
tion.21,22 Positioning of other objects such as theatre lights
may also have a detrimental effect, and this effect appears
to be more pronounced during TKA than total hip arthro-
plasty (THA).21,25 
Again, despite earlier positive findings regarding the use
of negative pressure exhaust suits, we found an increase in
the rate of infection six months post-operatively with the
use of surgical helmet systems, although this only
approaches significance on multivariate analysis, with no
significant difference at 12 months post-operatively.4-6,26
Thus, there certainly appears to be no significant benefit
obtained from their use. Clearly different types of suit
should be identified before drawing conclusions, but there
is little in the way of positive data surrounding the use of
surgical helmet systems.15,17,27,28 Potential reasons for this
include increased bacterial shedding due to excess heat and
airflow within the suit, disruption of laminar flow systems
both by the up flow of warm air dispelled from below the
gown and helmet fan systems, and loss of the surgeons’
dexterity and hence being more likely to contaminate them-
selves.15,29
We found a positive correlation between the use of anti-
biotic-laden cement and revision for infection at six
months. Namba et al17 also found an increased hazard ratio
for infection of 1.84 with the use of antibiotic-laden
cement, thus this is the second registry study to highlight
this as a possible issue in TKA. It is difficult to explain these
findings, but a sub-analysis of these data shows considera-
ble variation in the use of antibiotic-laden cement among
surgeons, and thus, it may relate to its selective use in high
risk patients. A more recent Canadian registry study by
Bohm et al. found that the use of antibiotic-laden cement in

339

TKAs had no clinically significant effect on reducing the
rate of revision within two years.30 These observations also
remained even after stratifying into surgeons who consist-
ently used one type of cement and those who chose differ-
ent types of cement for individual patients, thus presumably
selecting antibiotic-loaded cement for higher risk patients.
They surmised that the lack of positive effect might be due
to the small amount of cement that is used in TKA, and
hence the low duration and magnitude of the levels of anti-
biotic involved. In contrast, the Norwegian Arthoplasty
register found the opposite to be true for cemented THA,
where the risk of infection was found to be 1.8 times higher
in patients without antibiotic in the cement.31 
Even though BMI has only been recorded in the NZJR
since 2010 (hence, 9195 patients available for analysis), a
strong association was still found between increasing BMI
and rates of infection on univariate analysis. The rate of
revision was three-fold higher in morbidly obese patients,
with a BMI of > 40, compared with patients with BMI
< 35). Obesity risks increasing operating time, affects the
dose of prophylactic antibiotic which is required, as well as
potentially affecting the immune response and wound heal-
ing capabilities due to concurrent medical co-morbidities
such as diabetes mellitus.32,33 These findings are in
accordance with a plethora of both registry and large retro-
spective analyses.16,17
There are a number of limitations to this study. The use
of a multivariate analysis made an attempt to control for
bias and possible confounding elements when relating indi-
vidual factors to infection, but there are many potential fac-
tors that were not included in the model, such as smoking,
as they are not recorded in the registry. Thus we have iden-
tified associations with infection, but this does not neces-
sarily imply causality. 
We used revision for infection within six and 12 months
as an indicator of infection after TKA. This does not take
into account patients who underwent washout, debride-
ment and / or liner exchanges (not currently recorded as a
revision on the registry), amputation, patients who were
treated with suppressive antibiotics or other conservative
measures, patients who died or patients who underwent
surgery more than a year after the initial procedure. In rela-
tion to the last point, the greater the time between the initial
procedure and revision, the higher the rate of infection
related to the initial surgery, but the data will also be
increasingly corrupted by the inclusion of de novo joint

infections. Other related registry publications have used
revision for infection at six and 12 months as end points,
with a further recent analysis from the Finnish registry,
including any infection up to eight years after the initial
procedure.15,17,20,28 Thus the rate of infection detected by
this study is an under representation of the actual figure,
but those not reported are likely to be randomly distributed
amongst the subgroups which have been analysed, hence
reducing the risk of bias in the significance of the correla-
tions obtained. Secondly while overall comorbidities were
measured using the ASA score, we did not have specific
data on factors such as diabetes.
This study has shown that both patient and surgical fac-
tors have an impact on the rate of deep infection after TKA.
Many resources are expended in the pursuit of the optimal
surgical environment, and this study throws significant
doubt onto the efficacy or current use of certain established
interventions. Despite this, largely non-modifiable patient
factors, with the possible exception of BMI, now appear to
be the most important factors for development of infection
after TKA. A patient model could thus be considered, as
illustrated in Figure 1. It seems likely that all wounds
become contaminated to a certain extent during surgery,
and that pre-existing patient factors act to reduce the total
capacity available until infection becomes established. With
ongoing pressure for the publication of individual surgeon
and departmental outcomes for arthroplasty in particular,
until we are able to provide a truly sterile environment in
which to perform TKA, any published or targeted rates of
infection should reflect the demographics of the population
undergoing the surgery.
