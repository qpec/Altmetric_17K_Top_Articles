ABSTRACT
PAPE, K., L. RYTTERGAARD, T. A. ROTEVATN, B. J. NIELSEN, C. TORP-PEDERSEN, C. OVERGAARD, AND H.
BØGGILD. Leisure-Time Physical Activity and the Risk of Suspected Bacterial Infections. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 48,
No. 9, pp. 1737–1744, 2016. Introduction: The risk of upper respiratory tract viral infections is reduced with increased physical activity,
but little information is available regarding bacterial infections. We examined the relationship between leisure-time physical activity and
suspected bacterial infections. Methods: Information on leisure-time physical activity was obtained from the 2007 and 2010 North Denmark
Region Health Surveys of 18,874 Danes and linked to data from nationwide administrative registries. Suspected bacterial infections were
determined based on filled prescriptions for antibiotics. Adjusted estimates were calculated using logistic regression models. Results: During
a 1-yr follow-up, 5368 participants filled at least one antibiotic prescription. There was a statistically significant difference between physical
activity level and filling any antibiotic prescriptions among women (P = 0.003) but not among men (P = 0.191). Logistic regression analysis
showed that compared with sedentary behavior, all levels of leisure-time physical activities lowered the likelihood of filling an antibiotic
prescription. However, after multivariable adjustments, only estimates of low physical activity were significant (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90, 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 0.82; 0.99). Multivariable adjusted subgroup analyses of suspected cystitis showed a decreased likelihood
of engaging in low (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.65–0.95) and moderate (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.54–0.87) physical activity. Conclusion:
Low leisure-time physical activity is associated with a statistically significant 10% lower risk of suspected bacterial infections during
a 1-yr follow-up compared with sedentary behavior. Further, low and moderate levels of physical activity were associated with the
statistically significant reduction of suspected cystitis. No reduction in suspected respiratory tract infections was statistically significant and
associated with physical activity compared with sedentary behavior. Key Words: EXERCISE, SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, COHORT

espite evidence that physical activity affects the
immune system (9,22) and repeated findings of a
relationship between physical activity and viral in-
fections (1,5,12,15,20,21), few studies (4,17) with a smaller
number of outcomes have examined the relationship be-
tween physical activity and risk of bacterial infections. The
effect of physical activity on the risk of viral infections is
suggested to be J-shaped (18,19); that is, while the incidence
and severity of primarily viral infections, such as upper re-
spiratory tract infections, may be reduced by regular mod-
erate physical activity compared with sedentary behavior,
exhaustive high-intensity exercise has been reported to in-
crease the risk of upper respiratory tract infections among
athletes (18,19). Among nonathletes, increasing physical
activity is associated with a decreased risk of upper respi-
ratory tract infections (15,16). The relationships found be-
tween physical activity and viral infections have raised an
interest in investigating the more serious infections caused
by a wide range of bacteria (3,6,24,31,33). Bacterial in-
fections are a considerable cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, and they place a burden on the health care sys-
tem and on society (3,6,24,31,33).
Previous studies (4,17) of leisure-time physical activity
and the risk of bacterial infection have primarily focused on
a specific disease or specific bacteria and not on bacterial
infections in general. The results of those studies indicate a
difference between men and women that suggests a sex in-
teraction and the potential confounding of age, sex, body
mass index, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Given the
high prevalence of bacterial infections (14) and the potential

 preventive effect of physical activity, we conducted a large
study with a broader and more general focus on bacterial
infections. The purpose of the study was to investigate the
relationship between different levels of leisure-time physical
activity and the risk of suspected bacterial infections, esti-
mated on the basis of filled antibiotic prescriptions. We
hypothesized that increased levels of leisure-time physical
activity are related with a lower risk of bacterial infections.
METHODS
Data collection. A cohort study based on the residents
who completed the North Denmark Region Health Survey in
2007 or 2010 was conducted (28,29). The original aim of the
two surveys was to describe the prevalence, distribution, and
development of the general health conditions of the citizens
of the North Denmark Region. Further, the aim was to pro-
vide data material for regional and municipal health planning,
for analysis of geographical differences, and for research and
methodology development. The information from the re-
spondents was linked in Statistic Denmark with information
from multiple nationwide registries via the use of Denmark_s
unique civil registration number, an identification number
assigned to all citizens at birth (30). Written informed consent
and ethical approval are not required for anonymized retro-
spective registry-based studies in Denmark (27,30).
The Civil Registration System (23) includes information
about each individual_s sex and date of birth. All hospital
admissions in Denmark are registered in the National Patient
Register (13). Discharge diagnoses are coded using the
World Health Organization_s International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10).
Information about all prescriptions filled at Danish phar-
macies is held in the Danish National Prescriptions Registry
(11) and coded using the World Health Organization_s An-
atomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classifications sys-
tem (34). Information on educational level was obtained
from the Population Education Register (32) and classified
using the International Standard Classification of Education
(ISCED-2011) (10).
Study population. The health surveys were sent out to
two samples of 23,490 and 35,700 citizens in Northern
Jutland, Denmark, at two different periods (28,29). The
survey was conducted either from November 2006 to
February 2007 or from February to March 2010. Both samples
were drawn randomly from the Civil Registrations System
from populations of 438,014 and 469,998 916-yr-old Danes,
respectively. The samples were cluster samplings stratified
according to the sizes of the 11 municipalities of the region.
Reminders were sent out twice to those who failed to return
the questionnaire. The response rates for the 2007 and 2010
questionnaires were 48.9% and 65.5%, respectively. For par-
ticipants who had answered both questionnaires, only the first
response was included in the study. The sampling design
yielded unequal selection probabilities for the citizens of the
different municipals, which could lead to biased parameter
estimates. To correct for the unequal selection probability, in
which the citizens of large municipalities were less likely to be
selected than the citizens of smaller municipalities, design
weights were applied to all analyses. The follow-up period for
filled prescriptions was defined as a period of 1 yr, from
February 1, 2007, to February 1, 2008, and from March 22,
2010, to March 22, 2011, respectively.
To avoid confounding from chronic diseases that could
affect the relationship between leisure-time physical activity
and suspected bacterial infections, only participants with no
records of cancer (ICD-10 = C00–C96), pharmaceutically
treated diabetes (ATC = A10), cardiovascular diseases
(ICD-10 = I00–I99), or chronic diseases of the lower respi-
ratory tract (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
asthma, among others; ICD-10 = J40–J47) at baseline were
included. Missing information about physical activity or
other covariates led to the exclusion of another 4752 par-
ticipants. This resulted in a final sample of 18,874 partici-
pants (see Fig. 1 for more details).
Assessment of physical activity. In the health sur-
vey, self-reported physical activity was assessed using a
four-level scale originally constructed by Saltin and Grimby
(26), with minor modifications. A single question was used
to assess leisure-time physical activity: ‘‘If you look at the
past year, what would you say best described your leisure-
time physical activity?’’ The participants chose from four
levels of physical activity: 1) ‘‘regular hard physical training
and competitive sports several times per week’’ (henceforth
designated ‘‘vigorous physical activity’’); 2) ‘‘exercise
through sports or heavy gardening or similar activities for
at least 4 hIwkj1’’ (‘‘moderate physical activity’’); 3)
‘‘strolling, riding a bicycle, or other light physical activity
for at least 4 hIwkj1 (include also Sunday walks, light gar-
dening, and riding a bicycle/walking to work)’’ (‘‘low
physical activity’’); or 4) ‘‘reading, watching television, or
other sedentary activities’’ (‘‘sedentary behavior’’) (28,29).
The survey question from 2007 differed from the 2010
version in that it allowed the participant to choose mul-
tiple responses and included a ‘‘do not know’’ category.
In this study, the highest level of physical activity level
was used, and the ‘‘do not know’’ category was consid-
ered missing data.
Identification of suspected bacterial infections. Sus-
pected bacterial infections were based on filled antibiotic
prescriptions with the following ATC codes: J01A-G, M, R,
and X (34) (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://
links.lww.com/MSS/A695, which list the abbreviations of the
ATC codes). We used filled antibiotic prescriptions as an
indication of suspected bacterial infection. All relevant anti-
biotics require a prescription and therefore the capture of
relevant prescriptions can be assumed to be complete. Only
the first prescription filled during the follow-up period was
included in the analyses.
Demographic and lifestyle characteristics. Information
regarding age and sex was identified through the Civil Reg-
istration System. We calculated body mass index (weight in

 kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) based on
self-reported weight and height in the survey and grouped the
participants into four categories: G18.5 kgImj2 (underweight),
Q18.5 to G25 kgImj2 (normal weight), Q25 to G30 kgImj2
(overweight), and Q30 kgImj2 (obese) (31). Smoking status
and weekly alcohol consumption were also obtained through
the health survey. Smoking status was classified as ‘‘current,’’
‘‘past,’’ or ‘‘never.’’ Alcohol consumption was divided into
four categories according to the Danish Health and
Medicines Authority_s recommendations (7) based on sex
and weekly consumption and define alcohol intake (women/
men) as follows: no consumption (0/0 UIwkj1), low risk
(G7/G14 UIwkj1), moderate risk (7–14/14–21 UIwkj1),
and high risk (914/921 UIwkj1).
The participants were grouped into five educational levels
according to the highest educational level achieved based on
the ISCED-2011 (10). The ISCED-2011 classification con-
sists of eight levels, and we operationalized these into five
levels corresponding to the Danish educational system (8):
A) early childhood education, primary education, and lower
secondary education (ISCED levels 0–2); B) general upper
secondary education and high school programs (ISCED
level 3); C) vocational upper secondary education and vo-
cational training and education (ISCED level 3); D) short- or
medium-length higher education, first-cycle program tertiary
education, and bachelor_s degree or equivalent (ISCED level
5–6); and E) long-term higher education, second-cycle pro-
grams, master_s degree or equivalent, or third-cycle pro-
grams: doctoral and PhD programs or equivalent (ISCED
levels 7–8) (32). Because of small numbers in category E, it
was combined with category D.
Data analysis and statistics. Descriptive baseline
data are shown in terms of counts and percentage stratified
by sex and physical activity level. Age is presented as the
mean T SD. The chi-square test was used to analyze group
differences at baseline for associations between categorical
variables, whereas t-tests were used to analyze age. Because
there was no difference between the participating men and
women, survey-weighted logistic regression models were
adjusted for sex and age to examine the relationship between
leisure-time physical activity and antibiotic prescriptions for
suspected bacterial infections. Although no interaction between
sex and physical activity was detected in the fully adjusted re-
gression model (P = 0.117), sex-stratified models were produced
for comparisons with previous studies (4,15,17,21). Sedentary
behavior was used as the reference in all models. The signifi-
cance level was set at P G 0.05, and 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calculated. Adjustments were conducted for age, body
mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and educa-
tional level in the multivariate logistic regressions. Furthermore,
adjustments for the two different survey periods and the different
municipalities were performed. The adjustments did not show
any differences and were thus not included in the final analyses.
Subgroup analyses were performed for the illnesses as-
sociated with the most frequently used antibiotic treatments
in the study (cystitis and respiratory tract infections) using
logistic regression models. Antibiotics prescribed to treat
several bacterial infections in different subgroups were not
included. All levels of physical activity above sedentary
behavior were merged together in the analyses of respiratory
tract infections. In the analyses of cystitis, body mass index
categories 1 and 2 were merged together for men because of

 a small number of outcomes. We performed a sensitivity
analysis of those who filled three or more prescriptions
during the year. We also performed a sensitivity analysis
using multivariate imputation by chained equations of those
who were excluded because of missing data (n = 4752).
Further, we examined the robustness of the exposure by
examining whether the participants who had completed both
questionnaires had changed their physical activity level
during the 3 yr between surveys. SAS 9.4 software (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all data management,
and all statistical analyses were performed using R Studio
software version 0.98.1062 (R Studio, Inc., �2009–2013,
part of the R statistical software package, version 3.2.2,
Development Core Team, Boston, MA).
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of the 18,874 participants
according to their leisure-time physical activity level and sex
are presented in Table 1. During 1 yr of follow-up, 5368
participants (22.4% of the men and 34.1% of the women)
filled at least one antibiotic prescription. There was a sta-
tistically significant difference between physical activity
level and filling any antibiotic prescriptions among the
women (P = 0.003) but not among the men (P = 0.191). The
men and women who participated in vigorous physical ac-
tivity were significantly younger than the participants in the
other exposure groups. The percentage of current smokers
and those with a body mass index higher than 25 kgImj2
was lower among the participants with higher levels of
physical activity. Age, body mass index, smoking status,
and alcohol consumption significantly differ in relation to
antibiotic prescription. The odds ratio (OR) estimates of the
relationship between leisure-time physical activity and
suspected bacterial infections (Fig. 2, models A and B)
showed that compared with sedentary behavior, all levels of
physical activity lowered the risk of filling an antibiotic
prescription. Estimates of low (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.78–
0.94) and moderate (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.75–0.93)
physical activity were significant after adjustment for sex
and age. In the multiadjusted analysis, the estimate of
moderate physical activity was attenuated (OR = 0.90, 95%
CI = 0.80–1.00) whereas the estimate of low physical ac-
tivity (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.82–0.99) remained signifi-
cant. The risk of filling an antibiotic prescription in relation
to vigorous physical activity was not as pronounced as for
the other physical activity levels. Although vigorous physi-
cal activity was not significant in any of the models, the results
suggest a U-shaped relationship between leisure-time physical
activity and the risk of suspected bacterial infections.
None of the results for men in either model A1 or model
B1 (Fig. 2) were statistically significant. However, OR
values showed that low and moderate levels of physical
activity were associated with a lower risk of filling an anti-
biotic prescription, whereas vigorous leisure-time physical
activity was associated with an increased risk, when com-
pared with sedentary behavior.
Age-adjusted estimates (Fig. 2, model A2) showed that
women who engaged in low (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.71–
0.91), moderate (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.70–0.94), and vig-
orous (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.62–1.05) leisure-time physical
activity were less likely to fill a prescription for antibiotics
compared with women with sedentary behavior. Estimates of
vigorous physical activity were not statistically significant in

 the multiadjusted model (model B2), and the relationships were
attenuated for moderate leisure-time physical activity (OR =
0.88, 95% CI = 0.75–1.03); however, a similar pattern was
found for the OR estimates.
The results for the analyses of the subgroup with suspected
cystitis were insignificant for both men and women partici-
pating in vigorous physical activity and for men who partici-
pated in low physical activity. However, all levels of physical
activity were associated with a lower risk of filling an antibi-
otic prescription compared with sedentary behavior (Table 2).
All estimates of the subgroup analysis of suspected respira-
tory tract infections were statistically insignificant (Table 2).
However, all estimates showed that physical activity either
lowered the risk of filling an antibiotic prescription or had no
influence compared with sedentary behavior.
Sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analyses that in-
cluded three or more filled antibiotic prescriptions (out-
comes = 1615) produced results similar to those of the main
analyses for one or more filled antibiotic prescriptions
(outcomes = 5368), but with wider CI values. The sensitivity
analyses, with use of multivariate imputation by chained
equations of those who were excluded because of missing
data (n = 4752), produced statistically significant results for
low physical activity and the risk of filling an antibiotic
prescription for suspected bacterial infection (OR = 0.91,
95% CI = 0.84–0.99). The results for suspected cystitis were
significant for participating in low (OR 0.79, 95% CI =
0.65–0.95) and moderate (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.54–0.87)
physical activity and insignificant result for suspected re-
spiratory tract infections. The results were similar as those of
the main analyses, however with smaller CI values.
Of the respondents who participated in both surveys,
63.6% reported unchanged levels of physical activity during
the 3-yr follow-up period. Among those who reported a
different physical activity level, only 3.27% changed by
more than one level.
DISCUSSION
This study suggests that low physical activity is associated
with a lower risk of suspected bacterial infections during a 1-yr
follow-up period. The results were primarily driven by a re-
duction in suspected cystitis infections in women. There was
no statistically significant sex interaction; however, there were
very few suspected cystitis infections among the men. For
comparison with previous studies (4,15,17,21) that most
often presented separate analyses of sex, we performed
analyses of men and women together and stratified.
Among the men, none of the results were statistically sig-
nificant; however, our results suggest a J-shaped tendency.
This is a tendency in which vigorous physical activity was
associated with a higher risk of suspected bacterial infections,
whereas low and moderate levels of physical activity were
associated with a lower risk of suspected bacterial infections
compared with sedentary behavior. A prospective study (4)
of age and lifestyle factors that focused on community-
acquired pneumonia found that the risk of pneumonia among
nonathletic men was U-shaped; however, the findings were
insignificant. The J-shaped tendency among men in our study
is similar to the findings from earlier studies of primarily viral
infections among athletes (1,4,5,12,15–17,20,21). Our find-
ings regarding vigorous physical activity could indicate that
our population-based sampling included some participants
who were involved in a physical activity level equivalent to
that of athletes, which could explain why our results show
patterns similar to those found among athletes.
Multiadjusted results were only statistically significant
for low physical activity among women. Estimates for the
different physical activity levels remained to decrease the
risk of suspected bacterial infections; however, the smaller
number of respondents in these groups could potentially

 explain the lower precision. A prospective study (4) of age
and lifestyle factors focusing on community-acquired
pneumonia found that the risk of pneumonia decreased
with increased physical activity, but only among younger
women, and after adjusting for body mass index, the relation
was attenuated. A later expansion of the study (17) with 1265
female cases of pneumonia extending and expanding the first
study (4) of 305 female cases found that women who exercised
more frequently were less likely to develop pneumonia; how-
ever, after adjusting for body mass index, smoking, and alcohol
use, these results were insignificant. Our results remained
significant for women participating in low leisure-time
physical activity after adjustment for all covariables unlike
previous studies (4,17). This could possibly be explained
by the broader focus on bacterial infections in general,
which contributed to more robust estimates.
A strong relationship was found between low and moderate
levels of physical activity and lower risk of filling an antibiotic
prescription for cystitis in both men and women. All estimates
were statistically insignificant because of the risk of filled
antibiotic prescriptions used to treat respiratory tract infections;
however, the tendency for all physical activity levels was either
lowering the risk or had no influence.
The findings of this study add knowledge to the area of
exercise and immunology. We found a significant protective
effect of low physical activity compared with sedentary be-
havior during leisure time on the risk of suspected bacterial
infections in general, without significant interactions be-
tween the sexes. Furthermore, we showed that both low and
moderate levels of physical activity were related to a statis-
tically significant lower risk of suspected cystitis compared
with sedentary respondents. These results indicate that
practitioners should be aware of physical activity as a po-
tential preventive factor for bacterial infections in the work
of disease prevention and health promotion.
Study limitations and strengths. A limitation of the
study is the possibility of a general physician confusing a
bacterial infection with a viral infection, leading to the mistaken
prescription of an antibiotic. Similarly, not all who are infected
with a bacterial infection will be treated with antibiotics.
However, these misclassifications would be nondifferential and
not related to the different levels of physical activity. Another
limitation of the present study is the use of a relatively simple
single-item question to assess self-reported physical activity
(26). Although the instrument_s predictive validity for several
health outcomes has been found acceptable (2,25), a more
detailed measurement of physical activity in terms of frequency
and intensity is desirable when studying the relationships be-
tween physical activity and bacterial infections; nonetheless,
we showed that the measure was relatively stable during a 3-yr
period (and was not subject to differential changes). Further-
more, filling antibiotic prescriptions was the only measurement
of suspected bacterial infections included in this study, which
not necessarily reflect the total occurrence of bacterial infections
in a population because of the limitations. We considered in-
cluding clinical hospital diagnoses of bacterial infections and
abnormal C-reactive protein and white blood cell levels indic-
ative of infections. However, less than 2% of the study popu-
lation was identified with a suspected bacterial infection based
on diagnoses (n = 92) or blood samples (n = 199) during the
1-yr follow-up, and no meaningful analyses were conducted
because of low precision, which may have been related to the
small number of outcomes.
A major strength of the present study is its access to na-
tionwide registries, which allowed us to obtain information
about all types of antibiotics and thus analyze a wide range
of bacterial infections rather than just a few bacterial dis-
eases or bacteria strains. Furthermore, the registries allowed
us to exclude participants who were sedentary because of a
history of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or chronic
diseases of the lower respiratory tract. The large sample and
the inclusion of both men and women with complete follow-
up in the registries and a large number of outcomes also add
strength to the study.
CONCLUSION
Low leisure-time physical activity is related to a statisti-
cally significant lower risk of filling any antibiotic pre-
scriptions during a 1-yr follow-up period compared with
