BACKGROUND: Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil have been associated 
with beneficial cardiovascular effects, but their role in modifying cardiac 
structures and tissue characteristics in patients who have had an acute 
myocardial infarction while receiving current guideline-based therapy 
remains unknown.
METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 
participants presenting with an acute myocardial infarction were randomly 
assigned 1:1 to 6 months of high-dose omega-3 fatty acids (n=180) 
or placebo (n=178). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used to 
assess cardiac structure and tissue characteristics at baseline and after 
study therapy. The primary study endpoint was change in left ventricular 
systolic volume index. Secondary endpoints included change in noninfarct 
myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular ejection fraction, and infarct size.
RESULTS: By intention-to-treat analysis, patients randomly assigned to 
omega-3 fatty acids experienced a significant reduction of left ventricular 
systolic volume index (–5.8%, P=0.017), and noninfarct myocardial fibrosis 
(–5.6%, P=0.026) in comparison with placebo. Per-protocol analysis 
revealed that those patients who achieved the highest quartile increase 
in red blood cell omega-3 index experienced a 13% reduction in left 
ventricular systolic volume index in comparison with the lowest quartile. 
In addition, patients in the omega-3 fatty acid arm underwent significant 
reductions in serum biomarkers of systemic and vascular inflammation and 
myocardial fibrosis. There were no adverse events associated with high-
dose omega-3 fatty acid therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction 
with high-dose omega-3 fatty acids was associated with reduction of 
adverse left ventricular remodeling, noninfarct myocardial fibrosis, and 
serum biomarkers of systemic inflammation beyond current guideline-
based standard of care.

reclinical cardiovascular benefits of omega-3 fatty 
acids from fish oil1,2 (O-3FA) have been evaluated in 
large-scale clinical trials in patients suffering an acute 
myocardial infarction (MI).3,4 The GISSI (Gruppo Italiano 
per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Infarto Miocardico)-
Prevenzione open-label trial randomly assigned 11 
324 pa-
tients to 1 g/d O-3FA versus placebo and observed a 20% 
mortality reduction for O-3FA therapy.3 However, with ad-
vances in acute infarct care, the reported incremental ben-
efits of O-3FA therapy have been inconsistent.4 Cardiac MRI 
(CMR) offers accurate serial quantification of left ventricular 
(LV) structure and function, infarct size, and extracellular 
matrix expansion within noninfarcted myocardium.5 The 
OMEGA-REMODEL trial (Omega-3 Acid Ethyl Esters on Left 
Ventricular Remodeling After Acute Myocardial Infarction) is 
a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial designed to evaluate the hypothesis that 4 g/d O-3FA 
for 6 months after acute MI attenuates adverse LV remodel-
ing beyond optimal standard of care.
MethODs
Patients
Patients were enrolled across 3 tertiary-care centers in 
Boston, MA (Brigham and Women’s, Massachusetts General, 
and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center hospitals) who were 
>21 years of age and presented with an acute MI based on 
(1) symptoms consistent with an acute coronary syndrome, 
(2) serial Troponin T (or I) profile consistent with acute injury 
and peak level >0.5 ng/mL, and (3) significant angiographic 
coronary stenosis. Patient recruitment occurred between June 
2008 and August 2012. Exclusion criteria included MI sec-
ondary to cardiac procedure, life expectancy <1 year, clinical 
indication for O-3FA treatment, active pregnancy, and absolute 
contraindications to CMR. All patients received standard medi-
cal therapy per discretion of the attending cardiologists. The 
institutional review board at each enrolling site approved the 
study and all patients provided informed consent.
study Design and randomization
The National Institutes of Health provided sole funding for this 
study, whereas GlaxoSmithKline (Research Triangle Park, NC) 
provided study medication (O-3FA and placebo). The investiga-
tional pharmacies of the enrolling centers randomly assigned 
patients 1:1 to either O-3FA or placebo using a 2×2 blocked 
randomization scheme for age (>70 years age) and anterior 
MI location in double-blinded fashion. Computer-generated ran-
domization codes were used by the investigational pharmacies 
for blocked randomization. Pretreatment and post-treatment 
visits occurred at 14 to 28 days and 6 months after index 
acute MI, respectively. Study visits included collection of coro-
nary risk profile, detailed events of index MI, adverse events, 
standardized lifestyle and dietary questionnaires, contrast-
enhanced CMR, and blood samples. All procedures during 
study visits were conducted or overseen in person by a physi-
cian investigator.
study intervention and Monitoring
During the pretreatment visit, enrolled patients received 
6-month supplies of study drug and were instructed to take 
four 1g capsules per day with meals. Study drug was either 
Lovaza, containing ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA, ≈465 mg) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, ≈375 mg; 
GlaxoSmithKline) or placebo, containing corn oil (600 mg 
linoleic acid, no O-3FA, and <0.05% of transfatty acids). All 
patients received lifestyle counseling, including dietary rec-
ommendations for standard post-MI care,6 but no specific 
recommendations were given with regard to dietary O-3FA 
intake. All patients were instructed to refrain from consuming 
over-the-counter fish oil products. Every 2 months during the 
6-month study drug period, an investigator conducted scripted 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Large-scale randomized trials of patients with 
acute myocardial infarction have reported 
inconsistent mortality benefits from omega-3 
fatty acids (1 g daily). Using cardiac MRI, 
the randomized, placebo-controlled OMEGA-
REMODEL study (Omega-3 Acid Ethyl Esters 
on Left Ventricular Remodeling After Acute 
Myocardial Infarction) investigated for cardiac 
remodeling benefits from omega-3 fatty acids 
from fish oil (O-3FA) in patients with acute myo-
cardial infarction who were receiving therapies 
per current treatment guidelines.
• In comparison with placebo, patients who 
received 4 g of O-3FA daily experienced sig-
nificant improvement in both left ventricular 
end-systolic volume and a surrogate cardiac 
MRI measure of noninfarct myocardial fibrosis 
during the first 6 months of infarct healing.
• These remodeling benefits followed a dose-
response relationship with the rise of the in 
vivo O-3FA levels quantified by the red blood 
cell index.
What are the clinical implications?
• The OMEGA-REMODEL study provides random-
ized trial evidence that 4 g daily dose of O-3FA 
is a safe and effective treatment in improving 
cardiac remodeling in patients receiving cur-
rent guideline-based post–myocardial infarc-
tion therapies.
• Given that the incidence of heart failure after 
acute myocardial infarction remains high 
despite current therapies, the cardiac remod-
eling benefits from O-3FA may translate to a 
significant clinical impact and warrants pro-
spective clinical studies.

study endpoints
The primary study endpoint was adverse LV remodeling mea-
sured as change in left ventricular end-systolic volume indexed 
to body surface area (LVESVI, mL/m2) by CMR after 6 months 
of study therapy. Secondary endpoints included changes in 
(1) noninfarct myocardial fibrosis measured as the myocardial 
extracellular volume fraction remote from the acute infarction 
(ECVRemote), (2) total infarct size, and (3) left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction (LVEF). Sudden cardiac death during follow-up was 
an additional secondary endpoint at trial commencement, but 
removal was recommended by the Data Safety and Monitoring 
Board because of the anticipated low number of events.
cardiac Mri 
CMR studies were performed using 3.0 Tesla scanners (Trio 
or Verio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The CMR protocol 
consisted of cine function, native and postcontrast myocar-
dial T1 mapping, and late gadolinium enhancement imaging. 
Myocardial T1 was measured using a look-locker gradient-
echo sequence (3 short-axis locations centered midventricle) 
acquired before and 5, 15, and 25 minutes after administration 
of 0.1 mmol/kg intravenous gadolinium (Magnevist, Bracco). 
Image analyses using a commercial software (QMass, Medis 
Inc, Raleigh, NC) was performed blinded to clinical data, 
time order of CMR studies, and treatment assignment. Total 
infarct size was measured as infarct mass (in grams) and as 
percentage of total LV mass (from late gadolinium enhance-
ment images). Infarct mass was similar between 2 criteria (≥2 
standard deviations beyond mean remote myocardial signal 
intensity and full-width half-maximum)7 and infarct mass val-
ues using ≥2 standard deviation criteria were then used in all 
analyses. Short-axis late gadolinium enhancement and myocar-
dial T1 images were segmented as per the American Heart 
Association 16-segment model.8 For each T1 Look-Locker 
acquisition, T1 was determined by nonlinear least-squares fit-
ting of a parameterized representation of an inversion recovery 
[signal intensity=A–B·exp(–TI/T1*)] to the measured average 
signal intensity values in myocardial segments. T1 was then 
calculated from the best-fit parameters with the correction 
formula T1=T1*·(B/A–1).9 We derived segmental extracellular 
volume fraction (ECV) by plotting the reciprocal of T1 (R1=1/T1) 
for myocardial segments against the simultaneously measured 
R1 in the blood pool, using both pre- and postcontrast mea-
surements where R1 in the blood pool was <3.5 s–1. R1 data 
pairs with higher values of R1 in the blood pool were excluded 
from a linear regression line fit to the R1 data to avoid an 
underestimation of ECV as conditions of fast water exchange 
may not be met.10 ECV was calculated from the slope of the 
linear regression line, ie, the partition coefficient (λ), using 
the blood hematocrit (HCT): ECV=λ·(1–HCT).11 ECV segments 
without matching late enhancement were averaged to yield the 
global ECV of the remote, noninfarcted myocardium (ECVRemote).
Biomarkers and Omega-3 Fatty acids
Blood samples were assayed for red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid 
levels (OmegaQuant Analytics, LLC, Sioux Falls, SD) and serum 
biomarkers (Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Inc, Richmond, VA) 
as follows: inflammation (C-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, 
lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, fibrinogen), neuro-
hormonal activation (N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic 
peptide, cystatin C), and cardiac fibrosis (ST-2, galectin-3). 
RBC fatty acid composition, which has been shown to correlate 
with myocardial O-3FA levels and unbiased by recent dietary 
intake,12,13 was evaluated by using gas chromatography by 
flame ionization detection. The omega-3 index was calculated 
from the sum of DHA and EPA and expressed as a percentage 
of total RBC fatty acids.
statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated by treatment arm using 
mean±standard deviation and median (first quartile, third quar-
tile), for normal and skewed continuous variables, respectively. 
Categorical variables were presented as count (%) for each 
level. General linear mixed models were used to perform an 
intention-to-treat analysis that included patients missing follow-
up visits for the primary and secondary endpoints.14 Restricted 
maximum likelihood estimation produces unbiased estimates 
under the assumption the missing responses are missing at ran-
dom, ie, the missing responses may be related to the observed 
responses, but are independent of the unobserved responses. 
This method alleviates the need for imputation. A compound 
symmetry correlation structure was used for the repeated mea-
surements. As a sensitivity analysis, the mixed models included 
increasing levels of covariate adjustment; the initial model only 
included the randomization group assignment, an indicator vari-
able for pre- or post-treatment visit, and their interaction. Age, 
sex, race, and clinical site were added to the model as fixed 
covariates, with CMR infarct size used to adjust for MI severity; 
RBC omega-3 index was included for pretreatment exposure 
to O-3FA. Finally, medication status, coronary risk factors, and 
heart rate were added to the model. Residual diagnostics were 
performed to verify model assumptions. A per-protocol analysis 
was also conducted for all patients who completed both study 
visits, and the changes in RBC levels of EPA and DHA (summed 
and individually) were used as biomarker-based measures of 
exposure to treatment. The changes in primary and secondary 
endpoints were regressed against the changes in RBC O-3FA 
levels (modeled separately as a continuous factor per 1 stan-
dard deviation increase and by quartiles using the first quartile 
as reference). In an exploratory analysis, fish oil randomization 
group assignment was used to predict changes in biomarkers 
of inflammation, neurohormonal activation, and cardiac fibro-
sis. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (SAS 
Institutes, version 9.4, Cary, NC), and a P value of <0.05 was 
used to ascribe statistical significance.
Power/sample size
The primary endpoint, change in LVESVI, was modeled as a 
log-normal distribution because of expected positive skew-
ness. The coefficient of variation for LV end systolic volume 
in studies of LV dysfunction was reported as 26%.15 The cor-
relation between measurements 6 months apart was assumed 
to be 0.7.16,17 To have >80% power and detect a 5% mean 
within-patient change in LV end systolic volume using a 2-sided 
critical level of 0.05, a minimum of 129 patients were required 
in each arm. Estimating a 30% loss to follow-up and a 25%

in study scheduling: 2 had a pretreatment visit at 5 
days after index MI and 1 had a post-treatment visit at 9 
months. Baseline demographics stratified by treatment 
arm are shown in Table 1. Overall, 91% of patients 
achieved Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)

son with 89% of those who had suffered an anterior 
ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (83% in 
placebo group and 94% in omega-3 group, P=0.20). 
Baseline CMR characteristics stratified by treatment 
arm are shown in Table 2, whereas both fatty acid 
and biomarker levels are shown in Table 3. Median in-
farct size (13 g and 11% total LV mass) were similar in 
 
both treatment arms. In comparison with published val-

myocardial fibrosis of the total cohort was significantly 
higher (33.8±5.3, n=358 versus 24.8±2.0, n=14,

measuring infarct size by late gadolinium enhancement 
in 38 randomly selected patients and found a high intra-
class correlation of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI],

treatment effects
Based on pill counts, compliance to study drug was 96% 
in both O-3FA and placebo groups (P=0.86). Changes in 
RBC fatty acid levels are shown in Figure 2. Patients who 
received O-3FA treatment experienced marked increases 
in RBC levels of EPA, DHA, and omega-3 index in addition 
to a decrease in arachidonic acid in comparison with pla-
cebo (all P<0.0001). The greatest impact of O-3FA treat-
ment was on RBC EPA and omega-3 index, which were 
increased by 256% and 81%, respectively. Figure 3 il-
lustrates the primary and secondary endpoints stratified 
by treatment assignment. Patients who received O-3FA 
experienced a mean reduction of LVESVI by 5.4%, in 
comparison with a mean 1.2% expansion in the placebo

regression of noninfarct myocardial fibrosis by 2.1%, in 
comparison with a mean 3.4% progression in the place-
bo group (P=0.026). There was a marginally significant 
difference toward improved LVEF in the O-3FA–treated 
group (4.8±11.3% versus 2.1±12.2%, P=0.073). Al-
though both groups experienced a reduction of infarct

There was no significant effect of O-3FA treatment on 
change in infarct size or LVEF in the intention-to-treat 
or per-protocol analyses. To remove the potential con-
founding effect of previous MIs, we performed similar 
intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses after exclud-

in online-only Data Supplement Table I, O-3FA treatment 
was associated with a strong and significant reduction 
of LVESVI and noninfarct myocardial fibrosis in both 
intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses in the 322 
patients without a history of previous MI.
Additional covariate adjustment of O-3FA effects on 
primary and secondary outcome measures are shown 
in online-only Data Supplement Table II. LVESVI reduction 
by O-3FA therapy remained significant when adjusted for 
fixed covariates, including age, sex, race, enrolling site, 
pretreatment omega-3 index, and pretreatment log trans-
formed infarct mass by CMR (model 1, –5.4% relative 
change from pretreatment, P=0.03). The effect of O-3FA 
on change in LVESVI remained significant when guideline-
based standard post-MI medical therapies, coronary risk 
factors, body mass index, and baseline heart rate were 
added to model 1 (model 2, –5.7% relative change from 
pretreatment, P=0.021). Noninfarct myocardial fibrosis 
also was significantly reduced by O-3FA treatment after

from baseline, P=0.046). However, after adjusting for 
standard post-MI medical therapies, there was only a 
nonstatistically significant trend for the treatment effect 
of O-3FA on noninfarct myocardial fibrosis (model 2, 
–4.7% relative change from baseline, P=0.067).
A dose-response relationship for O-3FA treatment was 
evaluated further in the subgroup of patients who com-
pleted both study visits per protocol (Table 5). Change in 
mean RBC levels of omega-3 index, DHA, and EPA were 
used as individual biomarkers of exposure to the interven-
tion. For every 1 standard deviation increase in the mean 
RBC levels of omega-3 index and DHA there were signifi-
cant reductions in LVESVI and noninfarct myocardial fibro-
sis, and an increase in LVEF, as well. There were no sig-
nificant associations between change in O-3FA levels and 
reduction of infarct size. Increases of mean RBC levels of 
EPA were only associated with a decrease in LVESVI. The 
strength of the associations between mean RBC levels of 
omega-3 index and DHA on the primary and secondary 
endpoints were evaluated using quartile analysis for the 
percent change in RBC omega-3 index levels (Figure 4). 
In comparison with the first quartile as reference, there 
was a graded significant change in LVESVI (linear trend 
P<0.0001) and LVEF (linear trend P=0.016), but not for 
either noninfarct myocardial fibrosis or infarct size.

with similar reductions of myeloperoxidase and ST2 
(9.3% and 8.3%, respectively). Figure 5 displays sig-
nificant dose-response relationships between quartile 
increase of omega-3 index and progressive reductions 
of ST2, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, and 
serum triglycerides. In O-3FA treated patients, reduction 
of ST2 demonstrated a strong correlation with reduc-
tion of noninfarct myocardial fibrosis (Figure 6, r=0.65,

Patient Outcomes and study safety
The most common side effect in this study was nausea, 
which was reported in 5.9% of the O-3FA–treated arm 
and 5.4% of the placebo arm (P=0.11). Only 4.8% of 
O-3FA–treated patients reported a fishy taste, which 
compared with 1.1% in placebo patients (P=0.04). No 
patient experienced significant bleeding related to study 
drug. There were 3 (2%) and 8 (4%) deaths in placebo 
and O-3FA patients, respectively (P=0.22). Among the 
11 patients who died, 8 who received fish oil treatment 
died at a median time of 24 months (range, 12–37 
months) after study enrollment. None of these 8 patients 
experienced any bleeding during the 6 months of fish oil 
treatment or experienced any drop in hematocrit during 
subsequent clinical visits. One O-3FA–treated patient ex-
perienced tongue swelling 1 month after enrollment that 
necessitated study drug termination, which resulted in 
resolution of the patient’s symptoms.
DiscUssiOn
In compared with placebo, high-dose O-3FA treatment 
during the first 6 months after acute MI resulted in signifi-
cant reductions of LVESVI and noninfarct myocardial fi-
brosis in revascularized acute MI patients who are receiv-
ing standard guideline-based medical care. We observed

that the degree of LVESVI reduction correlated with the 
degree of O-3FA incorporation into the RBC membrane 
suggesting RBC omega-3 index may serve as a useful 
marker of treatment efficacy. The results were highly 
suggestive of a dose-response relationship with patients 
in the highest omega-3 index quartile demonstrating the 
greatest reduction in adverse remodeling (13% reduction 
of LVESVI). O-3FA treatment also was associated with a 
significant reduction of both biomarkers of inflammation 
(myeloperoxidase, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase 
A2) and myocardial fibrosis (ST2). We therefore specu-
late that O-3FA treatment provides the aforementioned 
improvement in LV remodeling and noninfarct myocar-
dial fibrosis through suppression of inflammation at both 
systemic and myocardial levels during the convalescent 
healing phase after acute MI.
Similar to the OMEGA trial,4 patients in the current 
study had high adherence to current guideline-based 
post-MI treatments, including emergent percutaneous 
coronary revascularization. Contrary to the OMEGA 
and other O-3FA post-MI trials, the current study used a 
4-fold higher dose of O-3FA that more closely resembles 
the doses administered in translational animal studies 
reporting beneficial cardiovascular effects.23 Numerous 
studies have reported that improvement of LVESVI dur-
ing infarct convalescence remains the strongest favor-

able risk predictor, parallels reduction of post-MI mortal-
ity rates, and serves as a common mechanistic pathway 
for different classes of therapies that reduce mortality, 
sudden cardiac death, and heart failure incidence.24–26 
In the echocardiographic substudy of the SAVE (Survival 
and Ventricular Enlargement) Trial, although captopril 
only reduced post-MI LV end-systolic expansion by 4%, 
it was associated with a 45% reduction of patient mor-
tality.27 The multicenter CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post-
Infarct Survival Control in Left Ventricular Dysfunction) 
trial reported that carvedilol reduced all-cause post-MI 
mortality by 20%,28 whereas the echocardiographic sub-
study found only a 5.9% reduction of LV end systolic vol-
ume at 6 months.29 We hypothesize that the observed 
improvement in adverse LV remodeling by 5.7% beyond 
the current guideline-based post-MI therapies may be 
clinically relevant and requires prospective evaluation in 
trials adequately powered to assess the therapeutic ef-
fects of high-dose O-3FA on patient outcomes.
The acute loss of myocardium post-MI leads to a 
complex set of neurohormonal, genetic, and mechani-
cal factors that can trigger adverse LV remodeling 
within remote noninfarcted myocardium.30 In the early 
period after MI, inflammatory changes within the non-
infarcted myocardium contribute to fibrotic changes, 
whereas increased wall stress and biomechanical 
strain in later phases contribute to additional myocyte 
hypertrophy and extracellular matrix expansion. The re-
sults of this trial demonstrate potential mechanisms by 
which O-3FA may attenuate these adverse processes. 
Our observation that O-3FA treatment was associated 
with a reduction of inflammation are consistent with 
translational studies that have shown a reduction of 
inflammatory cytokines by O-3FA exposure in animal 
and human myocardium postinfarction.31–33 Further-
more, O-3FA treatment in this study reduced levels of 
serum ST, a biomarker that is upregulated in conditions 
of myocardial necrosis and dysfunction.34 ST2 antago-
nizes upregulation of interleukin-33, which has antihy-
pertrophic and antifibrotic effects.35,36 O-3FA treatment 
also has been shown to block directly cardiac fibroblast 
transformation, proliferation, and collagen synthesis 
through activation of the cyclic GMP/protein kinase 
G pathway.37 These mechanisms collectively may ex-
plain the attenuation of post-MI noninfarct myocardial 
fibrosis and adverse LV remodeling by high-dose O-3FA 
treatment found in this trial.
This study has several limitations. First, despite efforts 
of the study investigators, a substantial proportion of pa-
tients could not return for the post-treatment follow-up 
visit. Although this was distributed relatively evenly in both 
treatment arms, it remains uncertain whether this caused 
any bias to the main study findings. Second, commercial 
forms of fish oils are widely available and, therefore, over-
the-counter fish oil supplementation by patients could not 
be eliminated reliably and may have biased our results. 
However, the dose-response relationship between O-3FA 
therapy and our main study endpoints strongly supported 
our intention-to-treat analysis. Finally, the absolute percent 
changes of LVESVI and extracellular volume fraction (a sur-
rogate of noninfarct myocardial fibrosis) from O-3FA treat-
ment, started at 2 to 4 weeks post-MI, were only modest 
in comparison with guideline clinical care. Earlier initiation 
of O-3FA during the first days post-MI may have resulted 
in a more significant treatment benefit. A prospective trial 
would be necessary to determine the effect of earlier O-
3FA therapy on improving cardiac remodeling, myocardial 
tissue characteristics, and clinical outcomes.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated a beneficial ef-
fect for high-dose O-3FA treatment on adverse LV remod-
eling after acute MI in patients receiving modern, guide-
lines-based therapies. This finding was supported by the 
attenuation of concurrent fibrosis within noninfarcted 
myocardium and lower levels of systemic biomarkers of 
myocardial inflammation and cardiac fibrosis.
