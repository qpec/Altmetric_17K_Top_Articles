IMPORTANCE Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has not been rigorously evaluated
for young and middle-aged adults with chronic low back pain.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness for chronic low back pain of MBSR vs cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) or usual care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, interviewer-blind, clinical trial in an
integrated health care system in Washington State of 342 adults aged 20 to 70 years with
chronic low back pain enrolled between September 2012 and April 2014 and randomly
assigned to receive MBSR (n = 116), CBT (n = 113), or usual care (n = 113).
INTERVENTIONS CBT (training to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors) and MBSR
(training in mindfulness meditation and yoga) were delivered in 8 weekly 2-hour groups.
Usual care included whatever care participants received.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coprimary outcomes were the percentages of participants
with clinically meaningful (�30%) improvement from baseline in functional limitations
(modified Roland Disability Questionnaire [RDQ]; range, 0-23) and in self-reported back pain
bothersomeness (scale, 0-10) at 26 weeks. Outcomes were also assessed at 4, 8, and 52 weeks.
RESULTS There were 342 randomized participants, the mean (SD) [range] age was 49.3 (12.3)
[20-70] years, 224 (65.7%) were women, mean duration of back pain was 7.3 years
(range, 3 months-50 years), 123 (53.7%) attended 6 or more of the 8 sessions, 294 (86.0%)
completed the study at 26 weeks, and 290 (84.8%) completed the study at 52 weeks. In
intent-to-treat analyses at 26 weeks, the percentage of participants with clinically meaningful
improvement on the RDQ was higher for those who received MBSR (60.5%) and CBT
(57.7%) than for usual care (44.1%) (overall P = .04; relative risk [RR] for MBSR vs usual care,
1.37 [95% CI, 1.06-1.77]; RR for MBSR vs CBT, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.77-1.18]; and RR for CBT vs usual
care, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.01-1.69]). The percentage of participants with clinically meaningful
improvement in pain bothersomeness at 26 weeks was 43.6% in the MBSR group and 44.9%
in the CBT group, vs 26.6% in the usual care group (overall P = .01; RR for MBSR vs usual care,
1.64 [95% CI, 1.15-2.34]; RR for MBSR vs CBT, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.78-1.36]; and RR for CBT vs
usual care, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.18-2.41]). Findings for MBSR persisted with little change at 52
weeks for both primary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with chronic low back pain, treatment with
MBSR or CBT, compared with usual care, resulted in greater improvement in back pain and
functional limitations at 26 weeks, with no significant differences in outcomes between
MBSR and CBT. These findings suggest that MBSR may be an effective treatment option for
patients with chronic low back pain.

L
ow back pain is a leading cause of disability in the United
States.1Despitenumeroustreatmentoptionsandgreatly
increased medical care resources devoted to this prob-
lem, the functional status of persons with back pain in the
United States has deteriorated.2,3 There is need for treat-
ments with demonstrated effectiveness that are low risk and
have potential for widespread availability.
Psychosocial factors play important roles in pain and as-
sociated physical and psychosocial disability.4 In fact, 4 of the
8 nonpharmacologic treatments recommended for persistent
backpainincludemind-bodycomponents.4Oneofthese,cog-
nitive behavioral therapy (CBT), has demonstrated effective-
ness for various chronic pain conditions5-8 and is widely rec-
ommended for patients with chronic low back pain. However,
patient access to CBT is limited. Mindfulness-based stress re-
duction(MBSR),9anothermind-bodyapproach,focusesonin-
creasingawarenessandacceptanceofmoment-to-momentex-
periencesincludingphysicaldiscomfortanddifficultemotions.
MBSR is becoming increasingly popular and available in the
United States. Thus, if demonstrated as beneficial for chronic
low back pain, MBSR could offer another psychosocial treat-
mentoptionforthelargenumberofUSresidentswiththiscon-
dition.MBSRandothermindfulness-basedinterventionshave
been recognized as helpful for a range of conditions including
chronicpain.10-12However,only1largerandomizedclinicaltrial
(RCT)hasevaluatedMBSRforchroniclowbackpain,13andthat
trial was limited to older adults.
This RCT compared MBSR with CBT and with usual care.
We hypothesized that adults with chronic low back pain ran-
domized to receive MBSR would show greater short- and
long-term improvement in back pain–related functional limi-
tations, back pain bothersomeness, and other outcomes as
compared with those randomized to usual care. We also
hypothesized that MBSR would be superior to CBT because it
includes yoga, which has been found to be effective in treat-
ing chronic low back pain.14
Methods
Study Design, Setting, and Participants
The Mind-Body Approaches to Pain (MAP) trial protocol has
beenpreviouslypublished15andisshowninSupplement1.The
primary source of participants was Group Health, a large in-
tegrated health care system in Washington State. Letters de-
scribing the trial and inviting participation were mailed to
Group Health members who met the electronic medical rec-
ord inclusion/exclusion criteria and to random samples of resi-
dentsincommunitiesservedbyGroupHealth.Individualswho
responded to the invitations were screened and enrolled by
telephone (Figure). Potential participants were told that they
would be randomized to receive one of “two different widely-
used pain self-management programs that have been found
helpful for reducing pain and making it easier to carry out daily
activities” or to continued usual care plus $50. Those as-
signedtoreceiveMBSRorCBTwerenotinformedoftheirtreat-
ment allocation until they attended the first session. Partici-
pants were recruited from 6 cities in 10 separate waves.
Recruited individuals were 20 to 70 years of age with non-
specific low back pain that persisted at least 3 months. Indi-
viduals with back pain associated with a specific diagnosis
(eg, spinal stenosis), with compensation or litigation issues,
who would have difficulty participating (eg, unable to speak
English or unable to attend classes at the scheduled time and
location), or who rated pain bothersomeness at less than 4 or
pain interference with activities at less than 3 on 0- to 10-
point scales were excluded. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
were assessed using data from electronic medical records for
the previous year (for Group Health enrollees) and screening
interviews. Participants were enrolled between September
2012 and April 2014. Because of slow enrollment, after 99 par-
ticipants were enrolled, exclusion was discontinued of indi-
viduals aged 64 to 70 years, Group Health members without
recent visits for back pain, and patients with sciatica. The trial
protocol was approved by the Group Health Human Subjects
Review Committee (see trial protocol in Supplement 1). All par-
ticipants provided oral informed consent for trial participa-
tion and written informed consent for participation in classes.
Randomization
Immediately after providing consent and completing the base-
line assessment, participants were randomized in equal pro-
portions to the MBSR, CBT, or usual care group. Randomiza-
tion was stratified by the baseline score (≤12 vs ≥13 on a 0-23
scale)onthemodifiedRolandDisabilityQuestionnaire(RDQ)—
oneoftheprimaryoutcomemeasures.16Participantswereran-
domized within these strata in blocks of 3, 6, or 9. The strati-
fied randomization sequence was generated by the study
biostatistician using R statistical software,17 and the se-
quence was stored in the study recruitment database and con-
cealed from study staff until randomization.
Interventions
All participants received any medical care they would nor-
mally receive. Those randomized to the usual care group re-
ceived$50butnoMBSRtrainingorCBTaspartofthestudyand
were free to seek whatever treatment, if any, they desired.
The interventions were comparable in format (group), du-
ration (2 hours/week for 8 weeks, although the MBSR pro-
gram also included an optional 6-hour retreat), frequency
(weekly), and number of participants per group (see interven-
tion details).15 Each intervention was delivered according to
a manualized protocol in which all instructors were trained.
Participants in both interventions were given workbooks, au-
dio CDs, and instructions for home practice (eg, meditation,
body scan, and yoga in MBSR; relaxation and imagery in CBT).
MBSRwasdeliveredby8instructorswith5to29yearsofMBSR
experience. Six of the instructors received training from the
Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts
MedicalSchool.CBTwasdeliveredby4licensedPhD-levelpsy-
chologistsexperiencedingroupandindividualCBTforchronic

pleted by a research assistant at each session and reviewed
weekly by a study investigator to verify that all treatment com-
ponents were delivered. In addition, sessions were audio re-
corded and a study investigator monitored instructors’

adherence to the protocol, either in person or via audio re-
cording, for at least 1 session per group.
MBSR was modeled closely after the original MBSR
program9—adaptated from the 2009 MBSR instructor’
s
manual18byaseniorMBSRinstructor.TheMBSRprogramdoes
not focus specifically on a particular condition such as pain.
All classes included didactic content and mindfulness prac-
tice (body scan, yoga, meditation [attention to thoughts, emo-
tions, and sensations in the present moment without trying
to change them, sitting meditation with awareness of breath-
ing, and walking meditation]).
The CBT protocol included CBT techniques most com-
monly applied and studied for chronic low back pain.8,19-22
The intervention included (1) education about chronic pain,
relationships between thoughts and emotional and physical
reactions, sleep hygiene, relapse prevention, and mainte-
nance of gains; and (2) instruction and practice in changing
dysfunctional thoughts, setting and working toward behav-
ioral goals, relaxation skills (abdominal breathing, progres-
sive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery), activity pacing,
and pain-coping strategies. Between-session activities
included reading chapters of The Pain Survival Guide: How to
Reclaim Your Life.21 Mindfulness, meditation, and yoga tech-
niques were proscribed in CBT; methods to challenge dys-
functional thoughts were proscribed in MBSR.
Follow-up
Trained interviewers, masked to treatment group, collected
data by telephone at baseline (before randomization) and af-
ter randomization at weeks 4 (midtreatment), 8 (posttreat-
ment), 26 (primary end point), and 52. Participants were com-
pensated $20 for each interview.
Measures
Sociodemographic and back pain information was obtained at
baseline (Table 1). All primary outcome measures were admin-
istered at each time point; secondary outcomes were as-
sessed at all time points except 4 weeks.
Coprimary Outcomes
Back pain–related functional limitation was assessed by the
RDQ16 and modified to 23 (vs the original 24) items and to
ask about the past week rather than today only. Higher
scores (range 0-23) indicate greater functional limitation.
The original RDQ has demonstrated reliability, validity, and
sensitivity to clinical change.23 Back pain bothersomeness in
the past week was measured on a 0 to 10 scale (0 indicates
not at all bothersome; 10 indicates extremely bothersome).
Primary analyses of this study examined the percentages of
participants with clinically meaningful improvement (≥30%
improvement from baseline)24 on each measure. Secondary

the Graded Chronic Pain Scale.27 The Patient Global Impres-
sion of Change scale28 asked participants to rate their improve-
ment in pain on a 7-point scale (completely gone, much bet-
ter, somewhat better, a little better, about the same, a little
worse, and much worse). Physical general health status and
mental general health status were assessed with 12-item
Short-Form Health Surveys (SF-12 Physical and SF-12 Mental)
(0-100 scale; lower scores indicate poorer health status).29 Par-
ticipants were also asked about their use of medications and
exercise for back pain during the previous week.
Adverse Events
Adverse events were identified during intervention sessions
and by follow-up interview questions about significant dis-
comfort, pain, or harm caused by the intervention.
Sample Size
A sample size of 264 participants (88 in each group) was cho-
sen to provide adequate power to detect meaningful differ-
ences between MBSR and CBT and usual care at 26 weeks.
Sample size calculations were based on the outcome of clini-
cally meaningful improvement (≥30% from baseline) on the
RDQ.24 Estimates of clinically meaningful improvement in
the intervention and usual care groups were based on unpub-
lished analyses of data from our previous trial of massage for
chronic low back pain in a similar population.30 This sample
size provided adequate power for both coprimary outcomes.
The planned sample size provided 90% power to detect a 25%
differencebetweenMBSRandusualcareintheproportionwith
meaningful improvement on the RDQ, and at least 80% power
to detect a 20% difference between MBSR and CBT, assuming
30% of usual care participants and 55% of CBT participants
showed meaningful improvement. For meaningful improve-
ment in pain bothersomeness, the planned sample size pro-
vided at least 80% power to detect a 21.8% difference be-
tween MBSR and usual care and a 16.7% difference between
MBSRandCBT,assuming47.5%inusualcareand69.3%inCBT
showed meaningful improvement.
Allowing for an 11% loss to follow-up, we planned to re-
cruit 297 participants (99 per group). Because observed fol-
low-up rates were lower than expected, an additional wave of
participantswasrecruited.Atotalof342participantswereran-
domized to achieve a target sample size of 264 with complete
outcome data at 26 weeks.
Statistical Analysis
Following the prespecified analysis plan (Supplement 1), dif-
ferences among the 3 groups on each primary outcome were
assessed by fitting a regression model that included outcome
measures from all 4 time points after baseline (4, 8, 26, and
52 weeks). A separate model was fit for each coprimary out-
come (RDQ and pain bothersomeness). Indicators for time
point, randomization group, and the interactions between
these variables were included in each model to estimate in-
terventioneffectsateachtimepoint.Modelswerefitusinggen-
eralized estimating equations (GEEs),31 which accounted for
possiblecorrelationwithinindividuals.Forbinaryprimaryout-
comes,amodifiedPoissonregressionmodelwithalog-linkand
robust sandwich variance estimator32 to estimate relative risks
(RRs) was used. For continuous measures, linear regression
models to estimate mean change from baseline were used.
Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, pain duration
(<1 year vs ≥1 year since experiencing a week without back
pain), and the baseline score on the outcome measure. Evalu-
ation of secondary outcomes followed a similar analytic ap-
proach although models did not include 4-week scores be-
cause secondary outcomes were not assessed at 4 weeks.
Statistical significance of intervention effects at each time
point was evaluated separately. An a priori decision was made
to consider MBSR successful only if group differences were sig-
nificant at the 26-week primary end point. To protect against
multiple comparisons, the Fisher protected least-significant
difference approach was used,33 which required that pair-
wise treatment comparisons be made only if the overall om-
nibus test was statistically significant.
Because observed follow-up rates differed across inter-
vention groups and were lower than anticipated in this study
(Figure), an imputation method for nonignorable nonre-
sponse was used as the primary analysis to account for pos-
sible nonresponse bias. The imputation method applied a
pattern mixture model framework using a 2-step GEE
approach.34 The first step estimated the GEE model previ-
ously outlined with observed outcome data adjusting for
covariates but further adjusting for patterns of nonresponse.
Missing pattern indicator variables included the following:
missing 1 outcome, missing 1 outcome and assigned to
receive CBT, missing 1 outcome and assigned to receive
MBSR, and missing at least 2 outcomes (no further interac-
tion with group was included because very few usual care
participants missed ≥2 follow-up time points). The second
step estimated the GEE model previously outlined, but
included imputed outcomes from step 1 for participants with
missing follow-up times. The variance estimates were
adjusted to account for using imputed outcome measures for
unobserved outcomes.
All analyses followed an intention-to-treat approach. Par-
ticipants were included in the analysis by randomization as-
signment regardless of level of intervention participation. All
tests and CIs were 2-sided and statistical significance was de-
fined as a P value of .05 or less. All analyses were performed
using the statistical package R version 3.0.2.17
Results
Participant flow through the study is reported in the Figure.
Among 1767 individuals expressing interest in study partici-
pation and screened for eligibility, 342 were enrolled and ran-
domized. The main reasons for exclusion were pain lasting less
than 3 months (412), inability to attend treatment sessions

domized to receive MBSR attended the 6-hour retreat. Over-
all follow-up response rates ranged from 89.2% (305 partici-
pants) at 4 weeks to 84.8%(290 participants) at 52 weeks and
were higher in the usual care group (95.6% [108] at 4 weeks
and 93.8% [106] at 52 weeks).
At baseline, treatment groups were similar in sociodemo-
graphic and pain characteristics except for more women in
usual care and fewer college graduates in the MBSR group
(Table 1). Overall, 269 (78.9%) reported at least 1 year since a
week without back pain and most reported pain on at least 160
of the previous 180 days. Mean duration of back pain was 7.3
years (range, 3 months-50 years). The mean (SD) RDQ score
(11.4 [4.8]) and pain bothersomeness rating (6.0 [1.6]) indi-
cated moderate levels of severity. Opioids use for pain during

the past week was reported by 38 participants (11.1%). Seven-
teen percent had at least moderate levels of depression (PHQ-8
scores ≥10) and 18% had at least moderate levels of anxiety
(GAD-2 scores ≥3).
Coprimary Outcomes
At the 26-week primary end point, the groups differed signifi-
cantly (P = .04) in percent with clinically meaningful improve-
ment on the RDQ (MBSR 60.5%, usual care 44.1%, CBT 57.7%;
Table 2). Participants randomized to receive MBSR were more
likely than those randomized to usual care to show meaning-
ful improvement on the RDQ (RR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.06-1.77]) but
did not differ significantly from those randomized to CBT. The
overall difference among groups in clinically meaningful im-
provement in pain bothersomeness at 26 weeks was also sta-
tistically significant (MBSR 43.6%, usual care 26.6%, CBT
44.9%;P = .01).ParticipantsrandomizedtoreceiveMBSRwere
more likely to show meaningful improvement when com-
pared with usual care (RR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.15-2.34]) but not
when compared with CBT (RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.78-1.36]). The
significant differences between MBSR and usual care and
the nonsignificant differences between MBSR and CBT, in
percent with meaningful function and pain improvement,
persisted at 52 weeks, with RRs similar to those at 26 weeks
(Table 2). CBT was superior to usual care for both primary out-
comesat26weeksbutnot52weeks.TreatmenteffectsofMBSR
and CBT were not apparent before end of treatment (8 weeks).
Generally similar results were found when the primary out-
comes were analyzed as continuous variables, although more
differences were statistically significant at 8 weeks, and the

CBT group improved more than the usual care group at 52
weeks (Table 3).
Secondary Outcomes
Mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, SF-12 Mental
Component) differed significantly across groups at 8 and 26
weeks but not 52 weeks (Table 4). Among these measures and
time points, participants randomized to receive MBSR im-
proved more than those randomized to usual care only on the
depression and SF-12 Mental Component measures at 8 weeks.
Participants randomized to receive CBT improved more than
those randomized to MBSR on depression at 8 weeks and anxi-
ety at 26 weeks and more than the usual care group at 8 and
26 weeks on all 3 measures.
Improvement in characteristic pain intensity differed sig-
nificantly between groups at all 3 time points, with greater
improvement in MBSR and CBT than in usual care and no sig-
nificant difference between MBSR and CBT groups (Table 5).
No overall differences in treatment effects were observed
for the SF-12 Physical Component score or self-reported use
of medications for back pain. Groups differed at 26 and
52 weeks in self-reported global improvement, with both the
MBSR and CBT groups reporting greater improvement than
the usual care group, but not differing significantly from
each other.
Adverse Events
Thirty of the 103 (29%) participants attending at least 1
MBSR session reported an adverse event (mostly temporar-
ily increased pain with yoga). Ten of the 100 (10%) partici-
pants who attended at least 1 CBT session reported an
adverse event (mostly temporarily increased pain with pro-
gressive muscle relaxation). No serious adverse events were
reported.
Discussion
Among adults with chronic low back pain, both MBSR and CBT
resulted in greater improvement in back pain and functional
limitationsat26and52weekswhencomparedwithusualcare.
There were no meaningful differences in outcomes between
MBSR and CBT. The effects were moderate in size, which has
been typical of evidence-based treatments recommended for
chronic low back pain.4 These benefits are remarkable given
that only 51% of those randomized to receive MBSR and 57%
of those randomized to receive CBT attended at least 6 of the
8 sessions.
The findings of this study are consistent with the conclu-
sions of a 2011 systematic review,35 which reported that “ac-
ceptance-based” interventions such as MBSR have beneficial
effects on the physical and mental health of patients with
chronic pain, comparable to those of CBT. They are only par-
tially consistent with the only other large RCT of MBSR for
chronic low back pain,13 which found that MBSR, as com-
pared with a time- and attention-matched health education
control group, provided benefits for function at posttreat-
ment (but not at 6-month follow-up) and for average pain at

6-month follow-up (but not posttreatment). Several differ-
ences between our trial and theirs (which was limited to adults
≥65 years and had a different comparison condition) could be
responsible for differences in findings.
Although our trial lacked a condition controlling for non-
specific effects of instructor attention and group participa-
tion,CBTandMBSRhavebeenshowntobemoreeffectivethan
control and active interventions for pain conditions. In addi-
tion to the trial of older adults with chronic low back pain,14
which found MBSR to be more effective than a health educa-
tion control condition, a recent systematic review of CBT for
nonspecific low back pain found CBT to be more effective than
guideline-based active treatments in improving pain and dis-
ability at short- and long-term follow-ups.7 Further research
is needed to identify moderators and mediators of the effects
of MBSR on function and pain, evaluate benefits of MBSR be-
yond 1 year, and determine its cost effectiveness. Research is
also needed to identify reasons for session nonattendance,
ways to increase attendance, and ways to determine the mini-
mum number of sessions required.
Our finding of increased effectiveness of MBSR at 26 to
52 weeks relative to posttreatment for both primary out-
comes contrasts with findings of our previous studies of acu-
puncture, massage, and yoga conducted in the same popula-
tion as the current trial.30,36,37 In those studies, treatment
effects decreased between the end of treatment (8-12 weeks)
and long-term follow-up (26-52 weeks). Long-lasting effects
of CBT for chronic low back pain have been reported.7,38,39
This suggests that mind-body treatments such as MBSR and
CBT may provide patients with long-lasting skills effective
for managing pain.
There were more differences between CBT and usual care
than between MBSR and usual care on measures of psycho-
logical distress. CBT was superior to MBSR on the depression
measure at 8 weeks, but the mean difference between groups
was small. Because our sample was not very distressed at base-
line, further research is needed to compare MBSR to CBT in a
more distressed patient population.

ability of our findings to CBT delivered in an individual rather
than group format is unknown; CBT may be more effective
when delivered individually.40 Study strengths include a large
sample with adequate statistical power to detect clinically
meaningful effects, close matching of the MBSR and CBT in-
terventions in format, and long-term follow-up.
Conclusions
Among adults with chronic low back pain, treatment with
MBSR or CBT, compared with usual care, resulted in greater
improvement in back pain and functional limitations at 26
weeks, with no significant differences in outcomes between
MBSR and CBT. These findings suggest that MBSR may
be an effective treatment option for patients with chronic
low back pain.
