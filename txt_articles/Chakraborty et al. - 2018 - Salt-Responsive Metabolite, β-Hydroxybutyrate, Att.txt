In Brief
Chakraborty et al. report a link between
dietary salt, a ketone, and experimental
hypertension. Intake of a high salt diet
lowers the ketone body beta-
hydroxybutyrate (bOHB), produced by
the liver, which functions to prevent
Nlrp3-mediated kidney inflammation.
Rescuing bOHB by nutritional
supplementation of its precursor
attenuates hypertension.

SUMMARY
Dietary salt reduction and exercise are lifestyle mod-
ifications for salt-sensitive hypertensives. While ex-
ercise has prominent metabolic effects, salt has an
adverse effect on metabolic syndrome, of which hy-
pertension is a hallmark. We hypothesized that die-
tary salt impacts metabolism in a salt-sensitive
model of hypertension. An untargeted metabolomic
approach demonstrates lower circulating levels of
the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (bOHB), in
high salt-fed hypertensive rats. Despite the high
salt intake, specific rescue of bOHB levels by nutri-
tional supplementation of its precursor, 1,3-butane-
diol, attenuates hypertension and protects kidney
function. This beneficial effect of bOHB was likely
independent of gut-microbiotal and Th17-mediated
effects of salt and instead facilitated by bOHB inhib-
iting the renal Nlrp3 inflammasome. The juxtaposed
effects of dietary salt and exercise on salt-sensitive
hypertension, which decrease and increase bOHB
respectively, indicate that nutritional supplementa-
tion of a precursor of bOHB provides a similar benefit
to salt-sensitive hypertension as exercise.
INTRODUCTION
Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular dis-
ease and exercise is widely recommended for hypertensive pa-
tients as a lifestyle modification because of the well-documented
beneficial effect of exercise on lowering blood pressure (BP).
Similarly, calorie restriction, although not widely recommended
for patients, is also documented to lower hypertension (Dolinsky
et al., 2010; Melo et al., 2016). Interestingly, both exercise and
calorie-restriction are associated with increased circulating
levels of ketone bodies such as b-hydroxybutyrate (bOHB)
(Evans et al., 2017; Mahoney et al., 2006; Newman and Verdin,
2017; Sutton et al., 2018; Veech et al., 2017; Wang et al.,
2017). bOHB is produced predominantly in the liver, transported
to extrahepatic tissues, and traditionally recognized as a vital
alternative metabolic fuel during times of starvation (Newman
and Verdin, 2014). However, contemporary evidence indicates
that apart from serving as energy fuels, ketone bodies such as
bOHB block nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing
family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (Nlrp3)-inflammasome-medi-
ated inflammatory diseases and thereby play a prominent role
in maintaining physiological homeostasis (Newman and Verdin,
2014; Youm et al., 2015). Nlrp3 inflammasome is a broad sensor
for danger-associated molecular patterns (Bomfim et al., 2017;
Feldman et al., 2015; Kersse et al., 2011; Savage et al., 2012; Se-
pehri et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2014). The anti-inflammatory effects
of both exercise and caloric restriction are linked to bOHB-medi-
ated inhibition of the Nlrp3 (Ringseis et al., 2015; Wang et al.,
2016b).
In contrast to exercise and calorie-restriction, consumption
of high salt promotes hypertension. Studies on the effects of di-
etary salt have focused mainly on organs and tissues relevant
to BP regulation such as kidney, vasculature, heart, and brain.
A recent study demonstrated that a high -salt diet in mice rep-
rioritized liver energy metabolism (Kitada et al., 2017). Close as-
sociations are noted between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and
hypertension (Arima et al., 2014; Musso et al., 2003; Uetake
et al., 2015; Willner et al., 2001). A recent report suggests
that a reduction in salt intake serves as an additional interven-
tional approach for reducing the risk for developing metabolic
syndrome (Hattori et al., 2014; Kimura et al., 2016; Lanaspa
et al., 2018), of which, hypertension is one of the hallmark fea-
tures. Taken together, these studies point to an intriguing pos-
sibility that a high salt diet induced a deleterious effect on
hypertension and could mechanistically represent the opposite
scenario to that of the protective effects of exercise and calo-
rie-restriction on hypertension by altering the levels of hepato-
genic metabolites such as ketone bodies. Here, we examined
this possibility, first by an untargeted mass spectrometry-
based plasma metabolomics study and discovered altered
ketogenesis and over-activation of renal Nlrp3 as a key mech-
anistic link between high salt and hypertension. These results
indicated that a high salt diet has mechanistically opposite ef-
fects of exercise and calorie-restriction on BP. Next, we
demonstrated that nutritional intervention with 1,3-butanediol,
a precursor of the endogenous ketone body, bOHB, reversed
the adverse effects of high salt induced renal Nlrp3-mediated
inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertension. Based on these ob-
servations in the Dahl S rat, which is a salt-sensitive pre-clinical

 model of hypertension, we propose dietary intervention with
1,3-butanediol as an intriguing strategy for the clinical manage-
ment of salt-sensitive hypertension.
RESULTS
Untargeted Metabolomics Identifies Circulating bOHB
as a Key Metabolite Lowered by a High Salt Diet
Groups of salt-sensitive (S) Dahl rats were maintained on a high
(2.0% NaCl) or low (0.3% NaCl) salt-containing diet and moni-
tored for BP. The experimental time-line is provided in Figure S1.
The systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BP of the rats main-
tained on a high salt diet were consistently and significantly
elevated compared to the low salt group (Figures 1A–1C). Renal
fibrosis of these high salt-treated rats were significantly
elevated compared to the low salt-treated rats (Figure 1D).
Plasma metabolites in these animals were profiled using a
gas-chromatography-time of flight-mass-spectrometry (GC-
TOF-MS)-based untargeted metabolomic approach (Data S1).
Principal-component analysis (PCA) plot of the profiled untar-
geted metabolites is shown in Figure 2A. The distinct clusters
of black and red spheres representing metabolomic data from
low and high salt-fed groups of animals show that the metabo-
lomes of these two groups of animals are distinctly different
from each other (Figure 2A). Figure 2B shows that a majority
of the metabolites (represented by blue dots) remain unchanged
with a high salt challenge. However, a select group of 29 metab-
olites was differentially expressed between the high and
low salt-fed groups (represented by red dots) (Table S1). A ma-
jority of these metabolites are not yet annotated. However,
among the annotated metabolites, 4 metabolites were downre-

gulated and 9 metabolites were upregu-
lated (Table S1). Interestingly, the most
differential hepatogenic metabolite was
3-hydroxybutyric acid or bOHB (Figure 2C;
Table S1). bOHB is a ketone body pre-
dominantly generated by the liver. To confirm this observation,
bOHB was quantitated in both fasting and fed (non-fasted)
rats maintained either on low or high salt diets. Regardless of
the salt in the diet, bOHB was elevated in the rats that were
fasted compared to the rats in the fed state (Figure 2D). Impor-
tantly, bOHB was significantly lower in the fasted group of rats
maintained on a high salt diet compared to the rats on a low salt
diet (Figure 2D). This result is consistent with the differences of
bOHB levels found in plasma metabolomics.
Nutritional Intervention with bOHB-Attenuated
Hypertension
Next, to examine whether an increase in circulating bOHB could
directly impact BP regulation, rats were provided with or without
the precursor of bOHB, 1,3-butanediol in drinking water, and
their BP was monitored. Under both fasted and fed conditions,
circulating bOHB levels were elevated in the rats given 1,3-buta-
nediol (Figure 3A). This restoration of circulating bOHB levels
compared to animals without nutritional bOHB supplementation
was associated with significantly lower systolic, diastolic, mean
arterial BP, and heart rate compared to that of the rats main-
tained without 1,3-butanediol (Figures 3B–3D, 6C, and S7A).
However, the overall 24 hr BP lowering effect was only signifi-
cant in the high salt versus high salt + 1,3-butanediol group
compared to low salt versus low salt + 1,3-butanediol group
(Figures S7A and S7B). From this point forward, we therefore
resorted to studying only the high salt and high salt + 1,3-buta-
nediol groups. Alterations in BP in these groups were accompa-
nied by a lower Na+/K+ ratio in the sera and lower microalbumi-
nuria of high salt-fed rats treated with 1,3-butanediol (Figures
3E–3G).

 Protective Effect of bOHB on Salt-Sensitive
Hypertension Is Likely Independent of Salt-Dependent
Th17 Activation
bOHB is known to lower inflammatory responses (Newman and
Verdin, 2014, 2017; Roberts et al., 2017; Veech et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2017; Youm et al., 2015), and previous studies impli-
cate the immune system in salt-sensitive hypertension via the
exaggeration of the pro-inflammatory T cell function (De Miguel
et al., 2010, 2015; Maalouf et al., 2009; Mattson, 2014; Mattson
et al., 2006; Rudemiller et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2013). Therefore, to
delineate the mechanism by which bOHB lowers salt-sensitive
hypertension, we focused on kidney function in hypertension
and examined the status of molecules associated with salt-
responsive Th17 activation. In confirmation with previous re-
ports, the levels of Sgk1, IL23, Rorgt, and IL17r were significantly
upregulated in the rats on a high salt diet compared to those on a
low salt diet (Figure S2A). To examine whether alterations in
bOHB affected these Th17 responses, we measured the renal
Th17 profile in high salt-fed rats treated with 1,3-butanediol.
Despite the increase in serum bOHB of rats fed with 1,3-butane-
diol, there was no difference in the levels of molecules (except
IL17r) associated with salt-responsive Th17 activation compared

 to the rats with lower serum bOHB in the rats that did not receive
1,3-butanediol (Figure S2B). These data support a Th17-inde-
pendent mechanism for the BP lowering effect of bOHB.
Gut Commensal Microbiota Adapt to High Salt-Induced
Decrease in Host Ketogenesis
Due to the fact that microbiota are also known to be altered in
response to a high-salt diet (Wilck et al., 2017), we compared
the fecal microbiotal profiles of genetically hypertensive S rats
maintained on a low versus high salt diet (Figure S3; Data S2).
Consistent with the published literature (Wilck et al., 2017),
abundance of Lactobacilli spp. was lower in the high salt-fed
group (Figure 4A). Additional alterations were noted in Proteo-
bacteria, which were depleted and Prevotella, which were en-
riched in the high salt-fed group compared to the low salt-fed
animals (Figures 4B and 4C). Associated with these changes,
we observed alterations in several metabolic functional path-
ways of the gut microbiota of high salt-fed rats compared to
low salt-fed rats (Figure 4D). Interestingly, the two major meta-
genomic functional pathways, which were downregulated in

the high salt-fed group (Figure 4D, black
bars), were the phosphotransferase sys-
tem (regulating gluconeogenesis) and the
synthesis
and
degradation
of
ketone
bodies. Additional downregulation of func-
tional pathways related to carbohydrate
metabolism including galactose, fructose,
and mannose metabolism were noted
(Figure 4D, black bars). In contrast, in
response to a high-salt diet there were a
number of upregulated pathways related
to amino acid metabolism such as valine,
leucine, isoleucine, histidine, phenylala-
nine, lysine, alanine, aspartate, glutamate,
cysteine, and methionine metabolism (Fig-
ure 4D, red bars).
To determine whether the above alter-
ations in the gut microbiotal compositions
reflected in any changes in the gut microbi-
al products such as short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs), we conducted a second, tar-
geted metabolomic profiling to specifically assess the SCFA
levels in the high salt- versus low salt-fed groups of rats.
Changes in gut microbiotal composition or their functional path-
ways did not result in any changes in circulating SCFAs (Fig-
ure S5A). Also, gut barrier function, as measured by fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran translocation, was not different
between the high and low salt diet-fed animals (Figure S5B). In
addition, as an indirect measure of epithelial permeability func-
tion, serum immunoreactivity to bacterial products such as
flagellin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was unaltered between
the groups (Figure S5C).
bOHB Does Not Restore Gut Commensal Depleted by
High Salt
Further, to examine whether a high salt-induced lowering of the
ketone body, bOHB, was a factor for shaping the gut microbiota,
we compared the fecal microbiota of groups of rats maintained
on a high salt diet with or without the supplementation of 1,3-bu-
tanediol (Figure S4; Data S3). Rats receiving this supplement had
a modest increase, but not complete restoration in their gut
680
Cell Reports 25, 677–689, October 16, 2018
 commensal levels of Lactobacilli spp. or Proteobacteria as seen
in the low salt-fed rats (Figures 5A and 5B). However, a signifi-
cant decrease in a commensal Prevotella (Figure 5C) and in-
crease in Akkermansia were noted (Figure 5D). These changes
were accompanied by an overall shift in functional pathways of
gut microbiota from an increase in amino acid pathways in
response to a high salt diet (Figure 4D, red bars) reversed to a
decrease in amino acid pathways with the administration of the
pre-cursor of bOHB (Figure 5E, purple bars).
bOHB-Mediated Inhibition of the Renal Nlrp3-
Inflammasome
Because Th17 and gut-microbiotal modalities did not fully ac-
count for the mechanism by which bOHB contributes to a
decrease in BP, we focused on the known effects of bOHB on
the Nlrp3 inflammasome. Rats maintained on a high salt diet
and administered with or without 1,3-butanediol were examined
for levels of Nlrp3 and Caspase1, which are the signal sensor and
effector components of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, respectively.
Both Nlrp3 and Caspase1 were significantly lower in the kidneys
of the 1,3-butanediol-treated rats compared to the rats without
the 1,3-butanediol treatment (Figure 6A).
Next, to examine the downstream effects of the Nlrp3 inflam-
masome complex, which is also a driver of the expression of
proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b and IL18, we
examined the levels of these cytokines. Rats treated with 1,3-bu-
tanediol had lower renal levels of both IL1b and IL18 (Figures 6B–
6D) compared to the rats without the 1,3-butanediol treatment.

 This lowering effect on IL1b is consistent with the observed lower
serum IL1b levels in low salt-fed rats compared to high salt-fed
rats (Figure 6E).
bOHB is an inhibitor of the over-activation of the Nlrp3-inflam-
masome, which contributes to escalating inflammation. To test
whether the lower levels of the key Nlrp3 inflammasome com-
ponents in response to the 1,3-butanediol treatment of high
salt-induced hypertension led to an overall lowering of renal
inflammation, we measured the renal levels of Lipocalin2 (Lcn2),
a real-time marker of renal inflammation (Paragas et al., 2011).
Serum Lcn2 was significantly lowered by the administration of
bOHB to rats on a high salt diet (Figures 6E and 6F). This lower
level of Lcn2 is also consistent with the reduced serum Lcn2 level
of low salt-fed rats compared to high salt-fed rats (Figure 6G).

bOHB-Mediated Inhibition of the
Nlrp3-Inflammasome Activation
Protects Kidneys
Previous reports suggest a role for Nlrp3
in renal injury and identify the Nlrp3
inflammasome as a possible therapeutic
target in the treatment of patients with
progressive chronic kidney disease (An-
ders et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2017; Bu-
gyei-Twum et
al., 2016; Foresto-Neto
et al., 2018; Hutton et al., 2016; Vilaysane
et al., 2010). A recent study links IL1b
with kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Le-
mos et al., 2018). Therefore, to determine
whether bOHB-mediated inhibition of the
Nlrp3-inflammasome
similarly impacted
renal structure and function, we subjected
renal tissue of rats in our study for histo-
logical and immunochemical examination.
Renal injury characterized by the extent of
fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and protein
casts were all significantly decreased in
the bOHB-treated rats (Figures 7A–7C).
Associated with these alterations, kidneys
of rats treated with 1,3-butanediol had
lower levels of Hif1a, Tgfb1, Serpine 1,
and Col1a2 expression, which are markers of cellular stress
and tissue fibrosis (Figure 7D). 24-hr urinary protein excretion
was significantly lowered by the treatment of high salt-fed
rats with 1,3-butanediol (Figure 7E). Further, through histologi-
cal staining for macrophages, it was noted that the remission of
renal inflammation and injury led to a lower extent of macro-
phages infiltrating the kidneys of high salt-fed rats, which
were nutritionally supplemented with 1,3-butanediol (Figures
7F–7H).

 of ketone bodies increases rapidly under energy-deficit condi-
tions such as calorie restriction and prolonged exercise, both of
which are linked to health benefits of lowering BP. Our study,
focused on a specific ketone body, bOHB, which was identified
via an untargeted metabolomics profiling experiment, has identi-
fied that consumption of a high salt-containing diet represents an
antithesis to the relationship between ketone bodies and calorie
restriction or prolonged exercise. Specifically, a key liver-derived
ketone body, bOHB, was downregulated and associated with a
high salt-induced elevation of BP. Exogenously increasing the
levels of bOHB lowered salt-induced hypertension, demon-
strating the direct therapeutic effect of 1,3-butanediol, which is
a precursor of bOHB, in controlling salt-sensitive hypertension.
Reversal of salt-induced alterations in gut microbiotal composi-
tion, gut microbiotal-derived SCFAs, and Th17 profiles were
explored and eliminated as mechanisms by which bOHB facili-
tates a lowering effect on hypertension. Instead, our results point
to the observation that the lowering of bOHB associated with
intake of a high-salt diet causes hyperactivation of the renal
Nlrp3 inflammasome. We propose that this salt-induced mecha-
nism of increased renal injury and fibrosis contributes, at least in
part, to the observed lowering of BP by this hepatogenic
metabolite.
Salt (sodium chloride [NaCl]) is an essential micronutrient food
additive that enhances taste and is a food preservative. High
intake of salt is associated with an increased risk for hyperten-
sion and cardiovascular mortality, leading many professional so-
cieties to recommend limiting salt intake to 3.75–6 g/day (World
Health Organization, 2003). However, intake of salt is generally
greater and can average >10 g/day in many populations (Brown
et al., 2009). Excess salt consumption adversely affects cardio-
vascular and renal physiology, and to a lesser known extent, liver
physiology. Ingestion of high salt (4% NaCl in drinking water) by
mice and exposure of chick embryos to high salt lead to liver
fibrosis and derangement of the hepatic cords, respectively
(Wang et al., 2016a). A recent study reporting the adverse effect
of salt on obesity notes that a high intake of salt activates the
aldose reductase-fructokinase pathway in the liver and leads
to endogenous fructose production (Lanaspa et al., 2018). How-
ever, isocaloric substitution of fructose for other carbohydrates
did not adversely affect BP in humans (Ha et al., 2012). Thus,
although salt is known to adversely affect liver function in
different studies, whether this adverse effect of salt on the liver
contributes to salt-sensitive hypertension is not known. Our
study, using a genetically sensitive model for salt-induced hyper-
tension (Padmanabhan and Joe, 2017), demonstrates that high
salt-induced hypertension is indeed linked to liver function.
This inference is based on the salt-responsive oscillation of a
key metabolite, bOHB, which is one of the major ketone bodies
produced by the liver. Admittedly, the study has not directly
tested the direct effect of high salt on hepatic ketogenesis per se.
bOHB is synthesized by the liver and released into the blood
for use as a metabolic fuel by other tissues, particularly the kid-
ney, heart, and brain. Although traditionally viewed as a meta-
bolic substrate used as a vital alternative metabolic fuel for life
spanning from archaea and bacteria to eukaryotes, ketone
bodies are increasingly being recognized as metabolic and
signaling mediators even when carbohydrates are abundant
(Puchalska and Crawford, 2017). Through such functions, pro-
tective roles for ketone bodies, specifically bOHB, are noted in
cancer, heart, and liver diseases (Puchalska and Crawford,
2017). The major finding of our study is that it identifies a similarly
protective effect of a ketone body on salt-sensitive hypertension.
In addition to lowering dietary salt, physicians often recom-
mend hypertensive patients should exercise. However, exercise
may be difficult for some patients to incorporate into their life-
styles. Hence, if at all possible, it would be useful to derive the
beneficial biochemical effects of exercise through simpler,
more practical means such as through nutritional intervention.
Viewed from this context, it is intriguing to note that bOHB is a
common factor underlying both exercise and dietary salt.
bOHB levels are elevated during high-intensity exercise and,
based on our report, inversely correlated with dietary salt con-
tent. Thus, at the level of a circulating metabolite, by lowering
the intake of salt, or by nutritional supplementation of precursors
of bOHB, hypertensive subjects could be deriving the same
beneficial effects of elevated bOHB as that of exercise. The com-
monality of the underlying mechanism is traced to the beneficial
effects of bOHB as an inhibitor of the Nlrp3 inflammasome
(Youm et al., 2015). High salt diet in the Dahl S rat is reported
to be associated with inflammatory pathways and the inflamma-
some (Huang et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2016). What
is exciting here is the ability of 1,3-butanediol to prevent the acti-
vation of the inflammasome in S rats, which could serve as a
basis for further translational intervention studies. Admittedly,
evidence from our study is limited to such mechanistic observa-
tions in the kidney. It is also possible that the effects of bOHB on
the Nlrp3 are similarly operational in extra renal systems
including the vasculature, heart, and brain, which may add to
the observed lowering of BP.
A recent report indicates that high dietary salt leads to a
decrease in gut lactobacilli (Wilck et al., 2017), which raises the
question of whether the decrease in bOHB is due to the indirect
effect of the altered gut bacterial composition in response to a
high salt diet. Our results obtained by nutritionally increasing
bOHB levels, which lowers hypertension despite the high-salt
diet regimen and the associated salt-responsive re-arrangement
in gut bacterial composition, indicates that the salt-induced
decrease in bOHB is not a host adaptation in response to altered
gut microbiota. Further, bOHB-fed animals did not completely
restore the gut microbiotal composition to be similar to that of
a low salt-induced gut composition, suggesting that the salt
effect and the bOHB effect on the gut microbiotal composition
are distinctly different (Figures 4 and 5; Data S2 and S3).
The use of 1,3-butanediol in our study is based on the literature
(Youm et al., 2015). However, one drawback of using a high

 concentration of 1,3-butanediol is that not all of the 1,3-butane-
diol is converted to bOHB, whereby residual 1,3-butanediol may
also circulate and contribute to the observed BP effect. There is
no simple solution to address this problem because, in order to
test the sole effect of bOHB, infusion studies have to be conduct-
ed, but bOHB is only available as a sodium salt. Sodium there-
fore presents as a major confounding variable, whereby the
sole effect of bOHB is unlikely to remain unknown. Reports in
the literature (Carpenter and Grossman, 1983; Hall et al., 1984;
Rossi et al., 2000) indicate that both 1,3-butanediol and bOHB
are associated with diminished body weight and glycemia.
Therefore, we examined these metabolic parameters (Figures
S6A and S6B). However, Nlrp3 inflammasome is known to play
a key role in obesity and glycemia control (Stienstra et al.,
2011; Vandanmagsar et al., 2011; Wan et al., 2018). Taken
together, the body weight and glycemia reduction noted in our
study support the notion that bOHB inhibits the Nlrp3 inflamma-
some and has multiple effects, which may additionally converge
and contribute to the observed BP lowering effect. In future, it is
of interest to validate our data on the blood pressure-lowering ef-
fect of 1,3-butanediol with other sources of bOHB such as ke-
tone esters (Cox et al., 2016) as well as with other animal models.
Microbiotal alterations in response to 1,3-butanediol supple-
mentation is interesting. The colonization of Akkermansia, in
particular, is notable because the presence of this bacterium is
inversely correlated with body weight in rodents and humans
(Collado et al., 2008; Everard et al., 2013; Karlsson et al., 2012;
Santacruz et al., 2010; Schneeberger et al., 2015). In our study,
rats with elevated bOHB indeed demonstrated lower body
weight (Figure S6A) suggesting that colonization of Akkermansia
in response to 1,3-butanediol administration could represent one
of the mechanisms underlying the body weight lowering effect of
bOHB. However, further experiments will be required to address
the potential for Akkermansia to independently affect BP.
Both endurance exercise and starvation place a premium on
glucose reserves. Cox et al. (2016) have shown the benefits of
diet-derived ketosis, which alter fuel preference under energy-
intense conditions such as endurance training. Kitada et al.
(2017) describe that high salt intake, as it requires hepatic and
extrahepatic urea osmolyte production for renal water conserva-
tion, is also a similar energy-intense condition requiring repriori-
tization of energy metabolism. Our observations, wherein, rats
with diet-derived ketosis had lower fasting glucose levels (Fig-
ure S6B), also indicates a reprioritization of energy metabolism,
but our finding that a high salt diet lowers bOHB contradicts the
report by Kitada et al. (2017) showing that dietary high salt results
in hepatic ketogenesis. While both studies identify that reprioriti-
zation of energy metabolism occurs with a high salt diet, the
direction of prioritization could be different depending on the
salt-sensitivity, genetic background, fed (non-fasted) or fasted
state, and volume expansion features of the model. It is worth
noting that the study by Kitada et al. (2017) on fed mice is
different from our study where in the reported results are more
prominent in the fasted state. The Dahl S rat used in our study
is highly salt-sensitive (i.e., their increase in BP is dependent
on an increased blood volume) (Greene et al., 1990), whereas
the mouse model used by Kitada et al. (2017) is insensitive to
salt-induced BP. The inability of the S rat to increase the produc-
tion of bOHB could be due to an impaired ‘‘switching’’ mecha-
nism from carbohydrate to ketone metabolism, which is reme-
died by the exogenous administration of the precursor of
bOHB. In this context, it is relevant to point out that S rats have
poor running capacity compared to other inbred rats (Barbato
et al., 1998; Kumarasamy et al., 2013). It is therefore tempting
to speculate that the aberrant shift from glucose to ketone
body utilization as substrate for energy production may not
only affect salt-induced hypertension in this model, but may
also adversely affect their endurance running capacity.
Overall, the major finding of our study is that similar to the
importance of exercise-derived benefits of ketogenesis, the hep-
atogenic ketone body, bOHB, either endogenously produced by
the liver or exogenously supplemented via dietary ketosis, is
vitally important in the regulation of salt-induced hypertension.
The results of our study underscore the need for translational
studies in humans to harness similar metabolic actions of nutri-
tional ketogenesis, as a substitute or in addition to exercise, in
the clinical management of salt-sensitive hypertension.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
The inbred Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Jr or S) rat strain was used in the entire study. The S rat is a widely used pre-clinical model selec-
tively bred for hypertension in response to a high salt diet (Dahl, 1961; Dahl et al., 1964, 1970; Rapp and Dene, 1985; Rapp et al.,
1973). The inbred strain of the S rat model was developed in our laboratory at the University of Toledo College of Medicine and
Life Sciences (previous Medical College of Ohio) as a salt-sensitive genetic model for hypertension in 1985 and since then maintained
in-house (Rapp and Dene, 1985). Due to their inherent propensity to develop hypertension, the entire S rat colony is bred and main-
tained on a low salt diet (0.3% NaCl; Harlan Teklad diet TD 7034, Madison, WI). The Harlan Teklad diet (TD94217) was used for ex-
periments involving a high salt regimen (2% NaCl). All animal breeding and research procedures were conducted as per approved
IACUC protocols. All rats in any single experiment were raised by breeding their parents concomitantly. Male rats were used for all
studies. Pups were weaned at 28 days and maintained either on a low (0.3% NaCl) salt containing diet or on a high salt (2% NaCl) diet
as needed. For nutritional intervention studies, rats were given 20% (v/v) 1, 3-butanediol in their drinking water for durations
mentioned under each study. All the animals were allocated to experimental groups randomly. The timelines of the salt study exper-
iment and nutritional intervention study are as shown in Figure S1.
METHOD DETAILS
Blood Pressure Measurements
Rats were surgically implanted with radiotelemetry transmitters as described previously (Mell et al., 2015). Post-surgery, rats were
housed individually and allowed to recover prior to recording their BP using the DSI software and equipment (https://www.
datasci.com/). Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure were collected at 5 minintervals and analyzed using the Dataquest
A.R.T 4.2 Software.
Urinary Protein Excretion (UPE)
UPE determination was done as previously described (Garrett et al., 2006). Briefly, within 7 days following BP measurements, each
rat was housed individually in a metabolic cage and its urine was collected over a 24-hr period. The pyrogallol based QuanTtest Red
Total Protein Assay from Quantimetrix (Redondo Beach, CA, USA) was used to determine protein concentrations of the urine sam-
ples. A SpectraMax M3 microplate reader from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used to determine absorbance at
600 nm. Protein concentrations were determined by reading against the absorbance of the QuanTtest human protein standards
(25–200mg/dl). UPE data are presented as milligrams over a 24-hr period (mg per 24-hr).
Serum and Urinalysis
Within 7 days following BP measurements, serum (from non-fasted rats) was collected from rats fed with low salt, high salt or high salt
with 1,3- Butanediol. Each rat was housed individually in a metabolic cage with food and water and urine was collected over a 24-hr

 period. Then, the rats were continued to be housed in metabolic cages with access to water, but not food, for 24-hr fasted serum and
urine collection. At the end of the urine collection period, urine volume was recorded, and the rats were moved back to their home
cages with access to food ad libitum. Both serum and urine were stored at �80�C. Sodium, microalbumin and creatinine contents
were assessed with a Beckman Coulter AU680 analyzer by the ion selective electrode diluted (indirect) method.
Measurement of Serum bOHB
bOHB level was measured in the serum obtained from low salt, high salt or high salt with 1,3- Butanediol groups by using a color-
imetric assay kit (Cayman Chemicals, catalog # 700190). Briefly, serum was diluted to 1:2 (for fed or non-fasted state) and 1:8 (for
1, 3 butanediol supplemented and fasted group) with assay buffer provided in the kit. Standard was prepared as per manufacturer’s
protocol. The standards and samples were added into respective wells, and reaction was triggered by adding the developer solution.
After 30 min. of incubation at 25�C in dark, optical density was recorded at 450 nm using SpectraMax M3 microplate reader from
Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Histological Analyses
Immediately, after euthanasia kidneys were fixed in neutral buffered formalin for 24-hr and then transferred to 70% ethanol for
paraffin-embedding and sectioning via microtome. To observe the morphological and histopathological changes kidney sections
were stained with Hematoxylin & eosin. Kidney sections were graded in a blinded manner on an arbitrary semiquantitative scale
from 0 to 4 for kidney lesions as previously described (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = marked, 4 = severe, including half points)
(Garrett et al., 2003). The extent of macrophage infiltration in kidney was examined immunohistochemically. Briefly, paraffin-
embedded kidney sections were de-paraffinized and immersed in citrate buffer for epitope retrieval. After, blocking with horse serum,
the sections were incubated overnight with mouse anti-rat CD68 (Bio-Rad, Cat # MCA341R, 1:100 dilution). CD68-positive cells i.e.,
macrophages, were detected by using Vectastain Elite ABC kit and peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories Inc. Burlingame,
CA). The images were visualized, captured, and analyzed by using VS120 Virtual Slide Microscope (Olympus).
Microbiotal 16S RNA analysis
DNA extraction and Quantification
Fecal DNA was extracted from one fecal pellet (approximately 0.2g) using QIAamp�PowerFecal�DNA kit (QIAGEN) followed by pro-
vided protocol. At elution step, 50ml of low TE buffer (0.1mM EDTA, Tris-HCl buffer, 10mM, pH8.5) was used instead of AE buffer from
the kit. DNA concentration was measured by NanoDrop and then it was diluted to be 5ng/ml in low TE buffer to proceed the PCR
library preparation.
16S PCR library preparation, Clean-up, Normalization, and Pooling
We followed Illumina User Guide: 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation-Preparing 16S Ribosomal RNA Gene Ampli-
cons for the Illumina MiSeq System (Part # 15044223 Rev. B).
The 16S rRNA gene targeting V3-V4 region was amplified by PCR using the Ilumina primers:
50TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and 50 GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAA
GAGACAGGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT. For index PCR, Nextera XT index kit (FC-131-1002) were used to attach dual indices.
Following the Illumina User Guide for the Illumina MiSeq System, 10pM denatured and diluted library was mixed with 10pM PhiX con-
trol spike-in to be 10% PhiX in the final volume and loaded on Illumina MiSeq V3 flow cell kit with 2X300 cycles.
Quality Filtering, OTU Picking and Data Analysis
Raw 16S sequencing data were processed and analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline of multiple software including USEARCH
(Edgar, 2010), Quantitative Insights Into microbial Ecology (QIIME) software package (version 1.9.1) (Caporaso et al., 2010), linear
discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) (Segata et al., 2011), phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unob-
served states (PICRUSt) (Langille et al., 2013) and HMP unified metabolic analysis network (HUMAnN) (Abubucker et al., 2012).
Raw paired-end reads were merged to create consensus sequences and then quality filtered using USEARCH (version 9). Chimeric
sequences were identified and filtered using QIIME combined with the USEARCH (version 6) algorithm. Open reference operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) were subsequently picked using QIIME combined with the USEARCH (version 6) algorithm, and taxonomy
assignment was performed using Greengenes (DeSantis et al., 2006) as reference database. Using a series of QIIME pipelines, alpha-
and beta-diversity analyses were performed using a BIOM formatted OUT table. Taxonomic features with difference abundance were
further summarized using LEfSe (https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/) for group comparisons and predictive metagenome
functional analysis was performed using PICRUSt and HUMAnN.
Gut Barrier function
Rats from each of the 3 groups (low salt, high salt and high salt with 1,3- Butanediol groups) were fasted for three hr. 4kDa FITC-
dextran (Sigma Cat#FD4) was gavaged at 13.7mg/kg body weight. After the gavage, food and water were provided. After two hours,
serum was collected. Hemolysis-free serum was serially diluted in PBS in a 96-well black plate. Fluorescence intensity of the hemo-
lysis-free serum was measured (excitation 490 nm; emission 520 nm) using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M3).

Cell Reports 25, 677–689.e1–e4, October 16, 2018
 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Sera were collected from low salt, high salt and high salt with 1,3- Butanediol fed rats with and without treatment with 1, 3-Butanediol.
Serum IL-1b [1:10 in reagent diluent (PBS+1% BSA)] and serum Lcn2 [1:250 in reagent diluent (PBS+1% BSA)] were measured by
duoset enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from R&D Systems (cat# DY501-05 and cat# DY3508 respectively) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. All reagents used in the IL-1b and Lcn2 ELISA were procured from R&D Systems unless specified.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli 0128:B12 (Cat# L2887) was procured from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Flagellin
was purified from Salmonella typhimurium (SL3201, fljB� strain) through sequential cation and anion-exchange chromatography as
described previously (Ziegler et al., 2008). A 96-well plate was coated with LPS (2 mg/well) or flagellin (100 ng/well) in 9.6 pH bicar-
bonate buffer (100 mL/well) and incubated overnight at 4�C. Plates were washed thrice with wash buffer (0.05% goat serum and
0.01% Tween 20 in PBS). Serum samples were diluted (1:200) in wash buffer and loaded 100 mL to each well. After incubation for
1-hr at 37�C, plates were washed thrice with wash buffer. Anti-rat IgG HRP-conjugated (Cat# 112-035-003 bought from Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was added (100 mL/well) and incubated at 37�C for 1-hr. Plates were washed thrice with
wash buffer and added with 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) chromogenic substrate (100 mL/well). After 5 min incubation at
room temperature, reaction is stopped by adding TMB Stop Solution (50 mL/well) and the optical density was read at 450 nm. All re-
agents used in the Flagellin and LPS ELISA were procured from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless specified.
Untargeted Metabolomics
After 4 weeks on differential salt containing diets, rats were fasted overnight and plasma samples from high salt or low salt fed groups
of rats (n = 9/group) were collected and shipped to the West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC Davis (http://metabolomics.ucdavis.
edu/) for a primary metabolism panel of GC-TOF-MS based untargeted metabolomics profiling (http://metabolomics.ucdavis.edu/
core-services/metabolomics-central-service-core). All metabolites were reported by retention index, quantification mass, biochem-
ical database identifiers and full mass spectra. Metabolites were quantified by peak heights. Data were visualized as PCoA plots by
Sparse Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) and significantly different metabolites were mined for the pathways
they impacted using MetaboAnalyst (Xia et al., 2009).
Targeted Metabolomics
25 mL of plasma was extracted with acetonitrile spiked with internal standards, and the supernatant was then mixed with 200 mM
3-nitrophenylhydrazine and 120 mM N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N1-ethylcarbodiimide in a 2:1:1 (v/v/v) ratio. The samples were
derivatized at 40�C for 30 min and then injected into an Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electro-
spray ionization (ESI) source in negative-ion mode coupled to an Agilent 1290 infinity HPLC system with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18
column (2.1x100 mm, 1.7 mm; Waters, Milford MA). Solvent A was formic acid (0.01%, v/v) in water, and solvent B was formic acid
(0.01%, v/v) in acetonitrile.
Quantitation was performed by calibration to internal standards and standard curves on the Mass Hunter quantitative suite version
B.06.00 (Santa Clara). All levels are expressed in mM (Han et al., 2015; Mell et al., 2015; Theriot et al., 2014).
RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis
Kidneys from low salt, high salt and high salt with 1,3- Butanediol intervention group rats were isolated and homogenized in TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) for extracting RNA. We used 1 mg of total RNA to obtain cDNA by reverse transcription with SuperScript III kit
(Invitrogen). Levels of mRNA expression of Casp1, Nlrp3, IL1b, Lcn2, Hif1a, Tgfb1, Serpine1, Col1a2, RorgT, IL23, Sgk1, and
IL17r (primer sequence shown in Table S2) were analyzed by real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems), and expression levels relative
to the expression of Pgk1 were calculated by the 2-DDCt method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Graph Pad Prism version 5.02 was used for all analyses. Student’s t test was used to compare two groups, whereas one-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni post hoc test was used for studies with more than two groups. A p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. All
bar graph values are expressed as Mean ± SEM. Information on replicates for each experiment can be found in the figures and figure
legends.
