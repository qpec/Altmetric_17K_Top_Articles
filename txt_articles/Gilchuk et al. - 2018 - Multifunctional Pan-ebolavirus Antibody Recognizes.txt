SUMMARY
Ebolaviruses cause severe disease in humans, and
identification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that
are
effective
against
multiple
ebolaviruses
are
important for therapeutics development. Here we
describe a distinct class of broadly neutralizing hu-
man mAbs with protective capacity against three
ebolaviruses infectious for humans: Ebola (EBOV),
Sudan (SUDV), and Bundibugyo (BDBV) viruses.
We isolated mAbs from human survivors of ebolavi-
rus disease and identified a potent mAb, EBOV-520,
which bound to an epitope in the glycoprotein (GP)
base
region.
EBOV-520
efficiently
neutralized
EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV and also showed protective
capacity in relevant animal models of these infec-
tions. EBOV-520 mediated protection principally by
direct virus neutralization and exhibited multifunc-
tional properties. This study identified a potent natu-
rally occurring mAb and defined key features of the
human antibody response that may contribute to
broad protection. This multifunctional mAb and
related clones are promising candidates for devel-
opment as broadly protective pan-ebolavirus thera-
peutic molecules.
INTRODUCTION
Ebola virus, a member of the Filoviridae family, causes severe
disease in humans with 25% to 90% mortality rates and signif-
icant epidemic potential. There are no licensed ebolavirus vac-
cines or treatments. The largest 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic in
West Africa, with a total of 28,646 cases of Ebola virus disease
(EVD) and 11,323 deaths reported (Coltart et al., 2017), high-
lighted the need to accelerate EVD therapeutics development.
There are five known species—Zaire ebolavirus, Bundibu-
gyo ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, and
Reston ebolavirus—which are represented, respectively, by
Zaire (EBOV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), Sudan (SUDV), Tai Forest
(TAFV), and Reston (RESTV) viruses. EBOV, BDBV, and
SUDV are clinically relevant viruses that are known to cause
lethal disease in humans (WHO, 2017). Infections with RESTV
are usually asymptomatic in humans, and only one case
of non-lethal human infection has been reported for TAFV
(CDC, 2017).

 The Ebola virus envelope contains a single surface protein,
glycoprotein (GP), which forms a trimer. The GP protomer
consists of two subunits, GP1 and GP2. The GP1 subunit
has a heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain and a glycan
cap, which shields the host receptor binding site (RBS) that
binds to domain C of its endosomal receptor, the protein
Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1-C). The GP2 subunit contains the
internal fusion loop (IFL) and stalk and is anchored into the
viral membrane by a transmembrane domain (Lee et al.,
2008). The GP is solely responsible for viral attachment to
the host cell, endosomal entry, and membrane fusion (Lee
and Saphire, 2009), and thus it is also the major target for
neutralizing
monoclonal
antibodies
(mAbs)
and
vaccine
design.
An
experimental
therapeutic
mAb
mixture,
ZMapp,
comprising three murine-human chimeric EBOV GP-specific
mAbs (2G4 and 4G7 recognizing the base region and c13C6
recognizing the glycan cap), fully protected non-human pri-
mates (NHPs) from lethal EBOV challenge (Qiu et al., 2014).
This cocktail also exhibited activity when used as treatment
of EVD in humans in incomplete clinical trial testing during
the recent epidemic (PREVAIL II Writing Group et al., 2016).
ZMapp mAbs bind only to EBOV, however, and do not recog-
nize BDBV or SUDV. We and others have isolated hundreds of
new ebolavirus GP-specific mAbs from EBOV or BDBV survi-
vors since the last EVD outbreak. New mAbs have been
described that recognize diverse antigenic sites on GP,
including epitopes on the glycan cap, the IFL, the GP1 head,
the GP1/GP2 interface, the RBS, and the stalk (Bornholdt
et al., 2016a, 2016b; Corti et al., 2016; Flyak et al., 2016; Ho-
well et al., 2016; Keck et al., 2015; Misasi et al., 2016; Pallesen
et al., 2016; Wec et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017). Most of the
mAbs isolated to date neutralize only one or two ebolavirus
species. There is a medical need for mAb therapeutics that
exhibit a pan-ebolavirus pattern of breadth, because the na-
ture of future EVD outbreaks cannot be predicted. Recently,
investigators identified the IFL as a site of vulnerability on
GP, and they reported the isolation of three rare broadly
neutralizing mAbs (bNAbs) that also possessed protective ca-
pacity against EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV. One antibody was
derived from the B cells of immunized NHPs (Zhao et al.,
2017), and two others were isolated from the B cells of a hu-
man survivor (Wec et al., 2017). These studies demonstrate
that
rare
bNAbs
against
ebolaviruses
are
generated
in
response to natural infection or vaccination. Identifying potent
bNAbs that can resist the emergence of viral escape mutants,
and systematic analysis to define unique molecular and immu-
nological features that mediate broad protection by these an-
tibodies, are important next steps for rational selection of ther-
apeutic mAb candidates.
Here, we isolated two human bNAbs, designated EBOV-
515 and -520, that bound to sites of vulnerability on ebolavi-
rus GP and mediated protection against EBOV, BDBV,
and SUDV. In-depth analysis of the mechanism of action re-
vealed key features that contributed to the broad reactivity,
neutralization, and protection mediated by these mAbs.
Together, the findings suggested high promise for these
newly identified human mAbs as candidate pan-ebolavirus
therapeutics.
RESULTS
A Small Subset of mAbs Mediate Broadly Reactive
Responses in Human Survivors of EVD
Plasma from 16 human survivors of the 2014 EVD outbreak in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and one survivor of the
West African 2013–2016 EVD epidemic were assessed for
cross-reactivity against recombinant EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV
GP lacking a transmembrane domain (GP DTM) to identify survi-
vors that most likely have circulating memory B cells encoding
bNAbs.
Plasma
from
two
survivors
showed
the
highest
activity to all three GPs by ELISA and also neutralized live
EBOV (Figures 1A and 1B and unpublished data). Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these two donors were
used to generate >600 EBOV GP-reactive lymphoblastoid
B cell lines (LCLs). More than half of these EBOV-reactive
LCLs produced Abs that bound to GP DTM of at least two ebo-
lavirus species, and >10% bound in ELISA to EBOV, BDBV,
and SUDV DTM GP (Figure 1C). LCLs producing broadly reactive
Abs were used to generate B cell hybridomas. To identify hybrid-
omas secreting bNAbs, their supernatants were assayed for
neutralizing activity against live EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV. From
two survivors, we isolated 16 broadly reactive mAbs with
unique sequences (Table S1), three of which (designated
EBOV-442, -515, and -520) neutralized all three viruses. These
data suggested that EBOV infection elicited diverse B cell
response including many clones secreting mAbs that bond to
heterologous ebolavirus GPs, although only a small subset of
those mAbs mediated cross-neutralizing responses.
MAbs EBOV-515 and -520 Potently Neutralize EBOV,
BDBV, and SUDV and Confer Protection against EBOV
To assess the potency of EBOV-442, -515, and -520, we
compared their activity to that of the other broadly reactive
mAbs from the panel or to previously described GP-reactive
mAbs recognizing the base, glycan cap, or HR2/MPER region
(Figure 2A; Flyak et al., 2016, 2018; Murin et al., 2014). Dose-
response binding curves for the newly identified bNAbs showed
high levels of binding to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GPs DTM in
ELISA, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values
ranging from �10 to 200 ng/mL (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1; Table
S2). EBOV-515 and -520 potently neutralized EBOV, BDBV,
and SUDV with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
values ranging from �400 to 5,000 ng/mL. EBOV-442 neutral-
ized EBOV, BDBV, and to a lesser extent SUDV. Complement
was not required for neutralizing activity in vitro (Figures 2A
and 2C; Table S3). We next used a recently developed flow cy-
tometric assay to further characterize binding of individual
mAbs to EBOV GP expressed on the surface of Jurkat cells
(Jurkat-EBOV GP), which have been shown to express a form
of trimeric GP likely very similar to the native form on virion par-
ticles or naturally infected cells (Davis and Ahmed, personal
communication). Only a fraction of mAbs in the panel that bound
to the GP DTM also bound to Jurkat-EBOV GP, but this group
included all neutralizing mAbs (Figures 2A and S2). The results
showed that bNAbs EBOV-442, -515, and -520 all efficiently
recognized a form of trimeric GP that is anchored in a membrane
on transduced cells likely very similar to the native form on virion
particles or naturally infected cells.

Immunity 49, 363–374, August 21, 2018
 To determine the protective capacity of the mAbs in vivo, we
first tested EBOV-442, -515, and -520 in mice, against the
mouse-adapted EBOV (EBOV-MA). An irrelevant mAb DENV
2D22 (IgG1 isotype) that is specific to dengue virus envelope
(E) protein (Fibriansah et al., 2015) was used as a control.
EBOV-515 and -520 each conferred complete protection from
death, weight loss, and disease when delivered at a 5 mg/kg
dose 1 day after inoculation (1 dpi) with EBOV-MA (Figures
2D–2F). EBOV-442 protected poorly in mice. Together, the
results demonstrated the high neutralizing potency of EBOV-
515 and -520 against all three clinically relevant ebolaviruses,
and high efficacy of monotherapy with these mAbs that
conferred full post-exposure protection against lethal challenge
with EBOV.
EBOV-520 Mediates Protection Principally through
Virus Neutralization
In addition to neutralizing activity, mAbs may possess Fc-medi-
ated functional activities that contribute to protection in vivo. To
assess these additional functions in our broadly reactive mAbs,
we used antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP),
antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP), natural
killer (NK) cell activation, and antibody-dependent complement
deposition (ADCD) assays. These assays used immobilized
EBOV GP DTM to determine the capacity of bound mAb to acti-
vate human effector cells in vitro. Functional profiling of 16
broadly reactive mAbs from the panel revealed a diverse activa-
tion pattern (Figure S3A; Table S4). Neutralizing mAbs EBOV-
515 (IgG1), -520 (IgG4), and -442 (IgG1) triggered ADCP and
NK activation in vitro, suggesting that their Fc also could be
engaged in interaction with innate immune cells in vivo.

data are representative of two independent exper-
iments in (A) and (B). See also Table S1.
As
many
IgG4
antibodies
possess
anti-inflammatory activity (van der Neut
Kolfschoten et al., 2007), we determined
the functional capacity for Fc-engineered
variants of the EBOV-520. We expressed
the EBOV-520 variable region in recombi-
nant form with the human IgG1 isotype
(rIgG1) and also as a LALA Fc mutant
(rIgG1-LALA) that binds only weakly to
human Fcg-receptors
(FcgR)
and has
diminished function (Hessell et al., 2007).
We compared the activity of the variant IgGs using dose
response curves in ADCP, ADNP, NK activation, and ADCD as-
says. The rIgG1 showed higher activity when compared to the
WT IgG4, and no activity was detected by these assays for
rIgG1-LALA (Figure S3B).
The Fc-mediated activity assays above used solid-phase
display of GP DTM. We next determined whether EBOV-520
had a capacity to engage human effector cells in a system with
properly oriented full-length antigen displayed on a cell surface.
We used a stably transfected EBOV GP-expressing SNAP-
tagged 293F cell line as a target, with heterologous human
PBMCs as source of effector cells to assess dose-killing
response. The SNAP-tag is a self-labeling protein tag that allows
specific labeling of a target cell line with the SNAP-Surface Alexa
Fluor-647 fluorescent dye, facilitating detection of effector cell-
mediated killing activity by flow cytometry (Domi et al., 2018;
Orlandi et al., 2016). The EBOV-520 rIgG1 and WT IgG4 showed
dose-responsive cell killing, with activities comparable to that of
the base region mAb KZ52 IgG1, while the low level of cell killing
activity of rIgG1-LALA and rFab was similar to that of the control
mAb of irrelevant antigen specificity (Figure 3A). These findings
suggested that the bNAb EBOV-520 also may mediate function
through the Fc region when expressed as rIgG1. All tested
EBOV-520 variants, including the WT IgG4 and even monovalent
rFab, showed a similar level of neutralizing activity to that of the
full-length IgG (Figure 3B).
To evaluate whether Fc-mediated function was required for
protection in vivo by EBOV-520, we tested rIgG1 and rIgG1-
LALA variants in mice against EBOV-MA. The rIgG1 and rIgG1-
LALA antibodies conferred complete protection when delivered
at 5 mg/kg dose 1 dpi (Figures 3C and 3D), demonstrating that
Immunity 49, 363–374, August 21, 2018
365
 EBOV-520 mediated protection principally through virus neutral-
ization. Together, these results suggested that direct virus
neutralization alone could be sufficient to confer protection
in vivo by a bNAb, although this type of antibody also may func-
tion through Fc-mediated activities that can be tuned by class
switch of the isotype.
EBOV-515 and -520 Use Several Mechanisms to

cathepsin-mediated cleavage of GP into
cleaved GP intermediate (GPCL) in the en-
dosome (Chandran et al., 2005). Cleavage
removes the glycan cap and mucin-like
domain
of
GP
ectodomain,
thereby
exposing RBS for endosomal receptor
NPC1 (Carette et al., 2011; Co
ˆ te
´ et al.,
2011). Binding to NPC1 triggers structural
rearrangements in GP2 that lead to mem-
brane fusion (Spence et al., 2016).
We first defined groups of neutralizing
mAbs that bind to common major anti-
genic sites using a competition-binding
assay with cell surface-expressed intact
EBOV GP (Jurkat-EBOV GP) or the same
cells that had been treated with thermoly-
sin to mimic cathepsin cleavage to yield
membrane-displayed GPCL (Jurkat-EBOV GPCL). Cell surface-
displayed GPCL has utility for epitope mapping and mechanistic
studies with mAbs, because it closely mimics the proteolytically
primed receptor binding-competent GP intermediate that is
generated in the host endosomal compartment during ebolavi-
rus infection. EBOV-442 targeted the glycan cap (as shown by
competition with glycan cap mAbs BDBV289 or 13C6) and it
recognized only intact EBOV GP. The most potent bNAbs
(EBOV-515 and -520) bound moderately to intact GP but
strongly to GPCL, and they targeted the GP base (as shown by
competition for binding with mAb 2G4 or 4G7) (Figures 4A and
366
Immunity 49, 363–374, August 21, 2018
 4B). This finding suggested that EBOV-442 most likely acts prior
to GP cleavage, while EBOV-515 and -520 may act either prior to
or after cleavage.
We next assessed the capacity of the three bNAbs to inhibit
GP cleavage. Jurkat-EBOV GP cells were pre-incubated with
EBOV-442, -515, or -520. For comparison, we tested in parallel
mAb KZ52 (base) with known inhibitory activity (Misasi et al.,
2016) or a DENV 2D22 or the HR2/MPER-specific BDBV223
mAbs (negative controls). After cleavage, exposure of the RBS
on GPCL was measured by the level of binding of fluorescently
labeled RBS-specific mAb MR78 that does not bind uncleaved
EBOV GP (Flyak et al., 2015). EBOV-442, -515, and -520 in-
hibited cleavage in a dose-dependent manner, similarly to
KZ52 (Figures 4C and S4A). EBOV-442 was the most efficient
and completely inhibited GP cleavage at 40 mg/mL, while
EBOV-515 or -520 revealed only partial inhibition at the same
concentration. This finding supported our hypothesis further
that the most potent base region-specific mAbs (EBOV-515
and -520) also may act after GP cleavage.
During infection, GP cleavage occurs in the acidified endo-
some with a pH estimated to be about 5.5. As antibody binding
initially occurs at neutral pH during infection, we investigated the
pH stability of the immune complex when mAb was pre-bound to
cell surface-displayed EBOV GP or GPCL. Both EBOV-515 and
-520 demonstrated stable association with GP or GPCL at low
pH, ranging from �84% to 96% of the total mAb bound at neutral
pH and assessed before the exposure to low pH (Figure 4D). Sta-
ble binding of both bNAbs to GP or GPCL in low pH compart-
ments may allow them to act prior to or after the proteolytic prim-
ing step.
We next examined in more detail the interaction of base-spe-
cific bNAbs with cell surface-displayed GPCL. Binding of EBOV-
515 or -520 to Jurkat-EBOV GPCL was enhanced relative to bind-
ing of Jurkat-EBOV GP, while binding of BDBV317 (specific for
an HR2/MPER epitope) to Jurkat-EBOV GPCL was similar to
that for Jurkat-EBOV GP (Figure S4B). Dose-response testing
showed a dramatic increase (�80- to 250-fold) in binding effi-
ciency of EBOV-515 or -520 to GPCL compared to intact GP (Fig-
ure 5A). This finding was concordant with the large (�200- to
800-fold) increase in neutralizing potency for these mAbs against
a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus
(rVSV) displaying EBOV GPCL (Figure 5B). We concluded that
the antigenic site for these bNAbs is partially occluded on intact
GP and more accessible after proteolytic priming to produce
GPCL, which facilitates neutralization of cleaved virus in the
endosome.
Given that these bNAbs were more potent against particles
displaying GPCL, we next assessed their ability to inhibit binding
of GP to its receptor NPC1. Binding of soluble NPC1-C to Jurkat-
EBOV GPCL was assessed in the presence of increasing concen-
trations of EBOV-515 or -520 (base), negative control KZ52
(base), BDBV317 (HR2/MPER), or positive control MR72 (RBS-
specific,
with
NPC1-C-blocking
activity)
mAbs
(Bornholdt
et al., 2016a; Flyak et al., 2015). EBOV-520, similarly to MR72,
exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of NPC1 binding to GPCL
(Figures 5C and S4C), suggesting that EBOV-520 may act by in-
hibiting receptor engagement.
The antibodies MR72 and MR78 target a hydrophobic pocket
of the RBS that is exposed only on GPCL of ebolaviruses or GP of
the most divergent filovirus, Marburg (MARV) (Bornholdt et al.,
2016a). Hence, we next tested whether EBOV-520 competes
for binding with the RBS-specific MR72 or MR78. Pre-bound
MR72 or MR78 did not block binding of EBOV-520 to GPCL (Fig-
ure 5D), indicating that MR72 and EBOV-520 recognize non-
overlapping epitopes. In contrast, EBOV-520 partially inhibited
binding of MR72 (�2.8-fold decrease) when GPCL was pre-incu-
bated with EBOV-520, suggesting that EBOV-520 could inhibit
receptor binding indirectly by changing the conformation of
the RBS.
We considered whether any of the isolated antibodies of
differing epitope specificity could cooperate in binding to ebola-
virus GP, since cooperativity has been reported previously (Ho-
well et al., 2017). Thirteen non-competing mAbs from the panel
were combined individually with EBOV-515 or -520 and then

 assessed for cooperative binding to Jurkat-EBOV GP (Fig-
ure S4D). Two neutralizing mAbs, EBOV-437 and -442 (from
the glycan cap-specific group identified by competition binding),
enhanced the binding of both EBOV-515 and -520 to intact GP
�3- to 5-fold (Figure 5E). We concluded that such a cooperative
binding effect could facilitate recognition of intact GP by bNAbs
in polyclonal plasma or therapeutic antibody mixtures.
Together, our findings suggested several mechanisms that
can contribute to broad neutralizing activity by an individual
mAb (a property designated here as multi-functionality), which
included inhibition of GP cleavage, inhibition of primed virus
that displayed GPCL, inhibition of NPC1 receptor binding by an
allosteric alteration, and cooperative binding to a vulnerable anti-
genic site on GP.
EBOV-515 and -520 Recognize Distinct Vulnerable
Epitopes in the Ebolavirus GP Base Region
To define the structural basis of broad neutralization by the iso-
lated mAbs, we performed negative-stain single-particle elec-
tron microscopy (EM) studies using complexes of EBOV-515
or -520 Fab with recombinant trimeric EBOV GP DTM. The EM
class averages obtained showed the binding of three Fab mole-
cules on each GP trimer and confirmed recognition of the base
region of GP by both mAbs (Figures 6A, S5A, and S5B). We over-
laid the class averages of EBOV-515 and -520 Fab bound to GP
over a class average of Fab/EBOV GP DTM complexes for two
previously identified bNAbs: CA45 and ADI-15878 (Wec et al.,
2017; Zhao et al., 2017). The structures showed that the epitope
of EBOV-515 is similar to that of CA45, which recognizes the IFL
region on GP2, and also GP1 below the IFL. However, EBOV-515
approaches GP with different angles than does CA45. EBOV-
520 bound to a region closer to the head region of GP1, above
the IFL region epitope of antibody CA45. The binding sites and
approach angles of EBOV-515 and -520 differ from that of
mAb ADI-15878, which binds to a non-overlapping adjacent
epitope on the IFL and with a relative rotation of about 90� about
the long axis (Figures 6A and S5B).
To define the epitope for the bNAbs, we used alanine scan-
ning mutagenesis of GP and tested the binding of mAb EBOV-
515 or -520 to individual GP members of a shotgun mutagen-
esis alanine mutation library of EBOV GP. We also generated
antibody escape mutant viruses by passing infectious EBOV
or rVSV/EBOV-GP in the presence of mAb and determined
the GP sequence of escape variants. Consistent with the EM
data, the virus escaped EBOV-515 neutralization by indepen-
dent mutations at IFL residues P513L or N514D. None of the
single alanine mutants affected binding of EBOV-515, likely
due to its high-affinity binding mode. For EBOV-520, the
N512A (GP2, IFL) and E106A (GP1 head region) mutations
reduced binding to GP, and escape mutation E106K in the
head region of GP1 reduced neutralizing potency (Figure 6B,
top; Figures S5C and S5D). The EBOV-520 epitope is a

 quaternary structure located within a continuous and highly
conserved region that spans the GP1 and GP2 subunits (Fig-
ure 6B, top). The residues critical for EBOV-515 or -520 bind-
ing are 100% identical among multiple ebolaviruses, including
EBOV, BDBV, SUDV, and TAFV (Figure 6B, bottom), which ex-
plains the high level of neutralization breadth of these mAbs.
The EBOV-520 epitope and EM analysis also suggested that,
in addition to any allosteric alteration of the NPC1-C binding
site, this mAb would further impede binding by full-length
NPC1, since a co-crystal of GPCL and NPC1 (PDB: 5JNX)
(Gong et al., 2016) shows that the lumenal N-terminal domain
of NPC1 is in close proximity to N512 and E106 and that
EBOV-520 would sterically hinder access by NPC1.
In summary, epitope mapping studies showed that EBOV-515
and -520 recognized vulnerable epitopes in the ebolavirus GP

EBOV-515 and -520 Mediate
Protection against Heterologous
SUDV or BDBV Challenge
We tested the post-exposure efficiency of
EBOV-515 or -520 against SUDV using a
stringent STAT1-deficient (STAT1 KO)
mouse challenge model (Raymond et al., 2011), in which 100%
of animals in the mock-treated group succumbed to the disease
by 6 dpi. A single treatment with EBOV-515 IgG1 or -520 WT
IgG4 (10 mg/kg) conferred significant protection against mortal-
ity, with 80% or 60% of animals in the respective mAb treatment
group surviving by 28 dpi (Figure 7A). EBOV-520 afforded partial
protection against guinea pig-adapted SUDV (SUDV-GA) after
challenge in a guinea pig model (Wong et al., 2015), when mAb
(�15 mg/kg) was delivered on 1 and 3 dpi (Figure 7B). We next
determined efficacy of mAb EBOV-520 treatment against
BDBV infection using a ferret model (Kozak et al., 2016). Ferrets
were challenged with a lethal dose of BDBV and treated at 3 and
6 dpi with 18 mg of EBOV-520 or DENV 2D22 as a control by i.p.
injection. All control animals became ill by 7 dpi. Two of them
succumbed to the infection between observations, and two

 were euthanized 8 dpi as mandated by IACUC. In the EBOV-520
mAb-treated group, the male animal survived and showed no
disease, while female animals became ill and were euthanized
on 8–10 dpi (Figures 7C and S6). At time of the second i.p. treat-
ment with mAb (6 dpi), all control animals developed high viremia
with an infectious BDBV load that ranged from 104 to 106 PFU
per mL of blood, and >107 at 7 dpi as measured by plaque assay.
In contrast, all EBOV-520-treated animals had undetectable in-
fectious virus levels in blood on 6 dpi, and only one of three an-
imals that succumbed showed detectable viremia on 10 dpi (Fig-
ures 7D and S6). The plaque assay, which detects infectious
virus not neutralized by mAb, suggested that treatment with
EBOV-520
reduced
viremia.
No

was
observed for weight change or blood chemistry markers be-

protection observed, the physiological relevance and the effi-
cacy of monotherapy with EBOV-520 IgG4 isotype against
BDBV is uncertain, and an IgG1 form of the mAb would be
preferred for future development as a therapeutic antibody.

DISCUSSION
Here we describe potent pan-ebolavirus
reactive human mAbs. The work demon-
strates several principles of broad protec-
tion. First,the studiesidentify unique binding
sites for base region human mAbs that
confer broad and potent activity against
EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV, including engage-
ment of a quaternary epitope spanning GP1
and GP2 subunits. Second, the work iden-
tifies bNAbs that mediate protection as
monotherapy in vivo solely by neutralizing
activity, including by a naturally occurring IgG4 antibody. Third,
the EBOV-520 that binds to the GP base region reduces GP bind-
ing to the soluble NPC1-C, by an allosteric effect. Fourth, we
describe pan-ebolavirus glycan cap-specific mAbs that ‘‘prime’’
the GP to enhance accessibility of the deep base region site of
vulnerability, establishing a rational principle for development of
broad mAb cocktails for ebolavirus prevention or therapy.
Two recent studies identified the IFL as a site of broad vulner-
ability on the ebolavirus GP for antibody recognition and re-
ported isolation of potent macaque CA45 (Zhao et al., 2017)
and two clonally related human mAbs, ADI-15878 and ADI-
15742 (Wec et al., 2017). Systematic analysis of EBOV-515
and -520 extended these findings by defining new structural fea-
tures of broad human antibody-mediated responses against
ebolaviruses. We show that the positions and epitopes bound
by EBOV-515 and -520 differ from those of ADI-15878 and
ADI-15742. EBOV-520 recognizes a discontinuous epitope that
spans both GP subunits with a binding pose shifted upward to-
ward the GP head. The EBOV-515 epitope overlaps in part with
370
Immunity 49, 363–374, August 21, 2018
 that of CA45, but the mAb engages GP with different contact res-
idues. CA45 recognized Y517, G546, and N550 residues toward
the C terminus of the IF and residue R64 in the GP1 N terminus
(Zhao et al., 2017). EBOV-515 recognized the P513 and N514
residues toward the N terminus of the IFL. Recognition of diverse
epitopes in the base region near the IFL with differing binding
poses, breadth, potency, and mechanism of action by EBOV-
515, EBOV-520, CA45, ADI-15878, and ADI-15742 is reminis-
cent of findings for recognition of HIV Env by diverse human
mAbs (Wibmer et al., 2015). Study of the epitopes in this region
of GP may inform rational vaccine design against ebolaviruses.
Recent studies have emphasized an important role of Fc-
mediated Ab function for protective human immunity against
many viruses (Lu et al., 2018). The human neutralizing mAbs
that have conferred protection to date in small animal models
of EVD are of the IgG1 or IgG3 isotype, and hence likely also
may function in vivo through the Fc region to protect. It was
not clear whether neutralization alone is sufficient for protection
against EVD with mAb monotherapy, or whether this activity also
must be complemented by Fc-mediated function from the same
mAb or another mAb in a therapeutic cocktail. In this study we
showed that EBOV-520 was fully protective in mice when tested
as a functionally impaired IgG1 LALA. This finding suggests that
some pan-ebolavirus human mAbs can act principally or solely
through neutralization to confer protection in vivo.
Tuning Fc-mediated effector functions of ebolavirus-neutral-
izing Abs is a promising strategy to enhance their activity. Here
we show that the IgG1 form of EBOV-520 also can function
through the Fc in vitro. Further studies are required to determine
whether the protective effect of EBOV-520 and related clones
that act principally by neutralization can be improved by tuning
the Fc-mediated function up or down.
Blocking attachment of viruses to receptors on host cells is an
effective antiviral strategy, but the RBS on the intact ebolavirus
GP is difficult to access prior to cleavage in the endosome.
Here, the findings suggest a new alternate mechanism for inhib-
iting GP attachment to NPC1, mediated by the base region-spe-
cific mAb EBOV-520. Binding of EBOV-520 appears to alter the
conformation of the RBS by an allosteric effect that precludes
proper engagement by NPC1, although the resolution of our
EM studies did not allow us to determine whether a structural
alteration occurred in the RBS on binding. Atomic resolution
crystallography studies in the future will be required to determine
the extent of this effect.
Combination therapy with a cocktail of several potent mAbs
has been considered necessary for treatment of ebolavirus
infections (Saphire and Aman, 2016), because it has been chal-
lenging to achieve a strong protective effect in vivo with mono-
therapy. For example, treatment with the bNAbs ADI-15742 or
ADI-15878 achieved only partial protection when one considers
the results from infection models for each of the three clinically
relevant species (EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV) (Wec et al., 2017).
Our study revealed partial protection by EBOV-520 IgG4 against
BDBV and SUDV. We studied EBOV-520 in vivo as IgG4, since
that was the original isotype isolated, but for therapy IgG1 is
preferred. Direct comparison of the protective potency of
EBOV-520 with that of previously reported broad mAbs would
require tested of each side by side as IgG1s.
The optimal design principles for therapeutic cocktails for
broad action against diverse ebolavirus species are still unclear.
Ideally, one could identify a panel of mAbs that each broadly
recognize all relevant ebolavirus species, but also contribute to
the overall protective effect of the cocktail by complementary
or synergistic activities. Here we identified two broadly reactive
mAbs with synergistic activity, EBOV-437 and -442. Antibody
EBOV-442 appears to be a promising candidate for inclusion in
a combination therapy with EBOV-515 or -520, as a next-gener-
ation therapeutic antibody cocktail for ebolavirus treatment. The
next step will be to assess the efficacy of combination therapy
with a synergistic pair of these mAbs in NHP challenge studies
with each of the three viruses.
In summary, we report here the isolation of potent human
mAbs that recognize a unique site of broad vulnerability on the
ebolavirus GP and that can mediate protection principally by

functional response by which individual human mAbs can exploit
several mechanisms for contributing to broad protective immu-
nity. These mAbs and related clones are promising candidates
for development as broadly protective pan-ebolavirus therapeu-
tic molecules.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human samples
Human PBMCs were obtained from survivors of the 2014 EVD epidemic in Nigeria or of the 2014 Boende outbreak in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) (unpublished). A male human survivor of the 2014 EVD outbreak in Nigeria was age 31 y when infected
and age 32 when PBMCs were collected. A male human survivor of the 2014 Boende outbreak in the DRC was age 36 y when infected
and age 37 y when PBMCs were collected. PBMCs were collected well after the illness had resolved, following informed consent. At
time of blood collection, plasma samples were tested by RT-PCR and found to be negative for the presence of viral RNA. The studies
were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health
and the Kinshasa School of Public Health (DRC).
Cell lines
Vero-E6 (monkey, female origin), THP-1 (human, male origin), and Jurkat (human, male origin) cell lines were obtained from the Amer-
ican Type Culture Collection. Vero-E6 cells were cultured in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) (ThermoFisher Scientific) supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 5% CO2, 37�C. THP-1 and Jurkat cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), 1% GlutaMax
(GIBCO), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO) at 37�C in 5% CO2. The HMAA 2.5 non-secreting mouse-human heteromyeloma
cell line (sex information is not available) was a kind gift from L. Cavacini and was cultured as described previously (Yu et al., 2008). A
293F cell line (human, female origin) stably-transfected to express SNAP-tagged EBOV GP was described recently (Domi et al.,
2018). ExpiCHO (hamster, female origin) and FreeStyle 293F (human, female origin) cell lines were purchased from ThermoFisher
Scientific and cultured according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The Jurkat-EBOV GP cell line stably expressing EBOV GP Makona
on the surface (Davis and Ahmed, personal communication) was a kind gift from Carl Davis (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). An NIH
3T3 engineered fibroblast line (mouse, male origin) constitutively expressing cell-surface human CD154 (CD40 ligand), secreted hu-
man B cell activating factor (BAFF) and human IL-21 was kindly provided by Dr. Deepta Bhattacharya (Washington University in St.
Louis, MO). All cell lines were tested on a monthly basis for Mycoplasma and found to be negative in all cases.
Viruses
The authentic EBOV-eGFP, mouse-adapted EBOV Mayinga (EBOV-MA, GenBank: AF49101), guinea pig-adapted SUDV (SUDV-GA,
GenBank: KT878488), SUDV strain Gulu, and BDBV strain 200706291 Uganda viruses were described previously (Bray et al., 1998;
Sanchez and Rollin, 2005; Towner et al., 2005; Towner et al., 2008; Wong et al., 2015). The chimeric infectious EBOV/BDBV-GP and
EBOV/SUDV-GP viruses expressing eGFP were obtained by replacing the gene encoding EBOV GP with that of BDBV (GenBank:
KU174137) or SUDV (GenBank: KU174142), respectively (Ilinykh et al., 2016), and passaged two times in Vero-E6 cell culture mono-
layers. Recombinant chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus in which the G protein was replaced with EBOV GP (rVSV/EBOV-GP) were
provided by Heinz Feldmann (Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIH, Hamilton, MT) (Garbutt et al., 2004).
Mouse models
Seven- to eight-week old female BALB/c mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, and 7-8 week-old 129S6/
SvEv-Stat1tm1Rds mice (STAT1 KO) were obtained from Taconic Biosciences. Mice were housed in microisolator cages and provided
food and water ad libitum. Challenge studies were conducted under maximum containment in an animal biosafety level 4 (ABSL-4)
facility of the Galveston National Laboratory, UTMB.
Guinea pig model
Five- to six-week-old female Hartley guinea pigs were obtained from the Charles River Laboratories. Animals were housed and chal-
lenged under maximum containment in ABSL-4 facility of the Galveston National Laboratory, UTMB.
Ferret model
Six-month-old male and female ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were obtained from Marshall BioResources. Animals were housed and
challenged under maximum containment in ABSL-4 facility of the Galveston National Laboratory, UTMB.
The animal protocols for testing of mAbs in mice, guinea pigs and ferrets were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other applicable federal
statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals.

 METHOD DETAILS
Mouse challenge with EBOV
Groups of 7-8-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 5 per group) housed in microisolator cages were inoculated with 1,000 PFU of the
EBOV-MA by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Mice were treated i.p. with 100 mg (�5 mg/kg) of individual mAb per mouse on 1 dpi.
Human mAb DENV 2D22 (specific to an unrelated target, dengue virus) served as negative control. Mice were monitored twice daily
from day 0 to 14 dpi for illness, survival, and weight loss, followed by once daily monitoring from 15 dpi to the end of the study at
28 dpi. The extent of disease was scored using the following parameters: dyspnea (possible scores 0–5), recumbence (0–5), unre-
sponsiveness (0–5), and bleeding/hemorrhage (0–5). Moribund mice were euthanized as per the IACUC-approved protocol. All mice
were euthanized on day 28 after EBOV challenge.
Mouse challenge with SUDV
Groups of 7-8-week-old STAT1 KO mice (n = 5 per group) were challenged i.p. with 1,000 PFU wt SUDV (Gulu). Animals were treated
i.p. with 200 mg (�10 mg/kg) of EBOV-specific or control mAb DENV 2D22 per mouse on 1 dpi and were monitored as above.
Guinea pig challenge with SUDV
Groups of 5- to 6-week-old Hartley guinea pigs (n = 5/group) were injected i.p. with 1,000 PFU of SUDV-GA (guinea pig adapted strain
Boniface) (Wong et al., 2015). mAb EBOV-520 was delivered by i.p. route at indicated time points and doses. Control groups were
treated with mAb DENV 2D22 or left untreated. Animals were monitored for the illness, survival, and weight loss. All animals were
euthanized at 28 dpi.
Ferret challenge with BDBV
Groups of 6-month-old male and female animals were challenged intramuscularly with 1,000 PFU of BDBV, as described previously
(Kozak et al., 2016). Animals were treated by i.p. route with 18 mg of mAb EBOV-520 or the control mAb DENV 2D22 on day 3, and the
same dose of the mAb on day 6 after challenge. The disease scores were assessed as follows: healthy, 1; developing clinical disease,
2; advanced disease, 3; moribund, 4. Blood was collected from surviving animals on 0, 3, 6, 9, 14, 21, and 28 dpi to assess virus titers.
Ferrets were monitored for 28 days after virus inoculation and then euthanized.
Generation of human B cell hybridomas producing mAbs
PBMCs from heparinized blood were isolated with Ficoll-Histopaque by density gradient centrifugation. The cells were cryopre-
served in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until use. Human B cell hybridomas were generated as described previously
(Yu et al., 2008) with some modifications. Briefly, previously cryopreserved samples were thawed and expanded on irradiated
NIH 3T3 cells that had been engineered to express human IL-21, CD40L, and BAFF in medium A (STEMCELL Technologies) supple-
mented with CpG, a Chk2 inhibitor (Sigma), and cyclosporine A (Sigma). After 7 days, supernatants from each well of the 384-well
culture plates were assessed by ELISA for reactivity against various ebolavirus proteins using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISAs), as described below. The next day, cells from wells with supernatants reacting with antigen in an ELISA were fused with
HMMA2.5 myeloma cells using an established electrofusion technique (Yu et al., 2008). After the fusion reaction, hybridoma lines
were cultured in ClonaCell-HY Medium E (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with HAT Media Supplement (Sigma) in 384-
well plates for 18 days before screening of supernatants for antibody production. Hybridoma cell lines producing ebolavirus GP-reac-
tive antibodies were cloned biologically by single-cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Hybridomas were expanded in Medium E
until 50% confluent in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning).
mAb isotype and gene sequence analysis
The isotype and subclass of secreted antibodies were determined using murine anti-human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 mouse anti-
bodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotech). Antibody heavy- and light-chain variable region genes were
sequenced from hybridoma lines that had been cloned biologically from flow cytometry. Briefly, total RNA was extracted using
the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of the antibody gene cDNAs was performed
using the PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer’s protocols with gene-specific primers
(Thornburg et al., 2016). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 50�C for 30 min, 94�C for 2 min, 40 cycles of (94�C for
30 s, 58�C for 30 s and 72�C for 1 min). PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter)
and sequenced directly using an ABI3700 automated DNA sequencer. The identities of gene segments and mutations from germlines
were determined by alignment using the ImMunoGeneTics database (Giudicelli and Lefranc, 2011).
mAb production and purification
Hybridoma cells secreting GP-reactive mAbs were grown in serum-free medium (Hybridoma-SFM, Life Technologies). MAbs were
purified from filtered culture supernatants by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on an A
¨ KTA instrument using HiTrap
MabSelect Sure or HiTrap Protein G columns (GE Healthcare). Purified mAbs were buffer exchanged into PBS, filtered using sterile
0.45-mm pore size filter devices (Millipore), concentrated, and stored in aliquots at �80�C until use.

Immunity 49, 363–374.e1–e10, August 21, 2018
 For recombinant mAb production, cDNA encoding the genes of heavy and light chains were cloned into DNA plasmid expression
vectors encoding IgG (IgG1, IgG3, Ig4, or IgG1-LALA) - or Fab- heavy chain (McLean et al., 2000) and transformed into E. coli cells.
mAb proteins were produced following transiently transfection of FreeStyle 293F or ExpiCHO cells following the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol and were purified as described above.
GP expression and purification
The ectodomains of EBOV GP DTM (residues 1-636; strain Makona; GenBank: KM233070), BDBV GP DTM (residues 1-643; strain
200706291 Uganda; GenBank: NC_014373), SUDV GP DTM (residues 1-637; strain Gulu; GenBank: NC_006432), and MARV GP
DTM (residues 1-648; strain Angola2005; GenBank: DQ447653) were expressed transiently in Expi293F cells with a C-terminal
strep II tag using the pcDNA3 plasmid vector. Secreted proteins were purified using 5 mL StrepTrap HP column (GE Healthcare)
following the manufacturer’s protocol, and then purified further and buffer exchanged into PBS using Supedex200 (GE Healthcare)
size exclusion chromatography. Formation of EBOV GP DTM trimer was confirmed by negative stain EM. For some experiments, we
used EBOV GP that was produced in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells. Briefly, recombinant ectodomain of EBOV GP DTM in
modified pMTpuro vector was transfected into S2 cells followed by stable selection of transfected cells with 6 mg/mL puromycin.
GP ectodomain expression was induced with 0.5 mM CuSO4 for 4 days. Protein was purified using Strep-Tactin resin (QIAGEN)
via an engineered strep II tag and purified further by Superdex 200 (S200) column chromatography. Purity of recombinant GP
was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.
ELISA binding assays
Wells of microtiter plates were coated with purified, recombinant EBOV, BDBV, SUDV, or MARV GP DTM and incubated at 4�C over-
night. Plates were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk and 2% normal goat serum in DPBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (DPBS-T) for
1 hr. For mAb screening assays, hybridoma culture supernatants were diluted in blocking buffer 1:5, added to the wells, and
incubated for 1 hr at ambient temperature. The bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-human IgG conjugated with HRP
(Southern Biotech) and TMB substrate (ThermoFisher). Color development was monitored, 1N hydrochloric acid was added to
stop the reaction, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (Biotek).
For dose-response and cross-reactivity assays, serial dilutions of plasma or purified mAbs were applied to the wells in triplicate or
quadruplicate, as detailed above. EC50 values for mAb binding were determined using Prism 7.2 software (GraphPad) after log trans-
formation of antibody concentration using sigmoidal dose-response nonlinear regression analysis. Similarly, a non-linear regression
analysis was performed on the resulting curves to calculate plasma dilution that yielded a half-maximum O.D. 450 nm value. Antibody
titer in plasma was expressed as the inverse of plasma dilution.
Cell surface displayed GP mAb binding
Jurkat-EBOV GP cells were washed with the incubation buffer containing DPBS, 2% of heat-inactivated FBS and 2 mM EDTA
(pH 8.0) by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature. For antibody staining, �5 3 104 cells were added per each
well of V-bottom 96-well plate (Corning) in 5 mL of the incubation buffer. Serial dilutions of antibody were added to the cells in triplicate
or quadruplicate for total volume of 50 mL per well, followed by 1 hr incubation at room temperature, or 4�C in some experiments.
Unbound antibody was removed by washing with 200 mL of the incubation buffer as described above, and cells were incubated
with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled secondary goat anti-human antibodies (Southern Biotech) for 30 min at 4�C. In some experiments,
cells were fixed with 4% PFA in DPBS before staining with secondary antibodies. Staining of cells was measured by flow cytometric
analysis using an Intellicyt iQue high throughput cytometer (Intellicyt), or an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data for up to
20,000 events were acquired, and data were analyzed with ForeCyt (Intellicyt) or FlowJo (Tree Star) software. Dead cells were
excluded from the analysis on the basis of forward and side scatter gate for viable cell population. Binding to untransduced Jurkat
cells, or binding of dengue antigen-specific mAb DENV 2D22 served as negative controls for most experiments.
In some experiments, binding to cell surface displayed GP was assessed with mAbs that were directly fluorescently-labeled.
Briefly, mAbs were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 NHS ester (ThermoFisher) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. Labeled
mAbs were purified further and buffer exchanged into the PBS using desalting Zeba columns (ThermoFisher) and stored at 4�C
with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.01% sodium azide.
To assess binding of mAbs to Jurkat-EBOV GPCL, Jurkat-EBOV GP cells were counted and treated with 0.5 mg/mL of thermolysin
(Promega) in PBS for 20 min at 37�C. Cell staining and flow cytometric analysis was performed as described above. Binding to un-
transfected Jurkat or uncleaved Jurkat-EBOV GP served as controls.
Cell surface displayed GP mAb competition-binding
Jurkat-EBOV GP or Jurkat-EBOVCL cells were pre-incubated with a saturating concentration (typically 20 mg/mL) of the first unla-
beled mAb at room temperature for 30 min, followed by addition of the second fluorescently-labeled mAb (typically 5 mg/mL) and
incubated for an additional 30 min. The second mAb was added after the first mAb and without washing of cells to minimize a disso-
ciation of the first mAb from cell surface GP during a prolonged incubation. Cells were washed, fixed with PFA, and cell staining was
analyzed using an Intellicyt iQue flow cytometer as detailed above. Background values were determined from binding of the second
labeled mAbs to untransfected Jurkat. Results are expressed as the percent of binding in the presence of competitor mAb relative to
primary mAb-only control (maximal binding) minus background. The antibodies were considered competing if the presence of first
Immunity 49, 363–374.e1–e10, August 21, 2018
e7
 antibody reduced the signal of the second antibody to less than 30% of its maximal binding or non-competing if the signal was
greater than 70%. A level of 30%–70% was considered intermediate competition. Of note, mAbs from the GP base region competitor
epitope group revealed much stronger binding to Jurkat-EBOV GPCL than to Jurkat-EBOV GP cells. This finding was revealed by
nearly complete cross-blocking capacity of these mAbs on Jurkat-EBOV GPCL when compared to those determined for Jurkat-
EBOV GP cells (Figure 4A, B).
Cell surface displayed GP cleavage inhibition
Jurkat-EBOV GP cells were pre-incubated with serial dilutions of mAbs in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, then incubated with
thermolysin for 20 min at 37�C. The reaction was stopped by addition of the incubation buffer as described above. Washed cells were
incubated with 5 mg/mL of fluorescently-labeled RBS-specific mAb MR78 at 4�C for 60 min. Stained cells were washed, fixed, and
analyzed by flow cytometry using Intellicyt iQue. Cells were gated for the viable population. Background staining was determined
from binding of the labeled mAb MR78 to Jurkat-EBOV GP (uncleaved) cells. Results are expressed as the percent of RBS exposure
in the presence of tested mAb relative to labeled MR78 mAb-only control (maximal binding to Jurkat-EBOV GPCL) minus background.
Cell surface displayed GPCL soluble NPC1-C binding inhibition
Jurkat-EBOV GPCL cells were prepared as detailed above and resuspended in the incubation buffer. Approximately 5 3 104 cells per
well in V-bottom 96-well plate were incubated with serial 3-fold dilutions of mAbs in a total volume of 50 mL at ambient temperature for
30 min, followed by washing and incubation with pre-titrated concentration (typically 50 mg/mL) of soluble, FLAG epitope-tagged,
recombinant NPC1- C protein (Creative BioMart). Cells were washed, incubated with PE-labeled secondary mouse anti-FLAG tag
antibody (BioLegend) for 2 hr at 4�C, fixed with PFA, and then analyzed by flow cytometry using LSRII cytometer equipped with
535 nm green laser. Cells were gated for the viable population. Results are expressed as the percent of NPC1-C binding inhibition
in the presence of tested mAb relative to NPC1-only control (maximal binding to Jurkat-EBOV GPCL) minus background.
Cooperative binding to cell surface displayed GP
The cell surface display assay was based on principles from previously described enhanced binding ELISA assay (Howell et al.,
2017). Briefly, Jurkat-EBOV GP cells were incubated with a mixture of individual unlabeled glycan cap-specific mAbs at a saturating
concentration (10 mg/mL) and respective dilution of fluorescently-labeled mAbs EBOV-515 or �520. Cells were washed, and anti-
body binding was analyzed by flow cytometry using Intellicyt iQue.
Epitope mapping using an EBOV GP alanine-scan mutation library
Epitope mapping was carried out as described previously (Davidson et al., 2015). Comprehensive high-throughput alanine scanning
(‘shotgun mutagenesis’) was carried out on an expression construct for EBOV GP lacking the mucin-like domain (residues 311-461)
(based on the Yambuku-Mayinga variant GP sequence), mutagenizing GP residues 33-310 and 462-676 to create a library of clones,
each representing an individual point mutant. Residues were changed to alanine (with alanine residues changed to serine). The re-
sulting library, covering 492 of 493 (99.9%) of target residues, was arrayed into 384-well plates, one mutant per well, then transfected
into HEK293T cells and allowed to express for 22 hr. Cells, unfixed or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, were incubated with primary
antibody and then with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing,
cellular fluorescence was detected using the Intellicyt high throughput flow cytometer (Intellicyt). mAb reactivity against each mutant
EBOV GP clone was calculated relative to wild-type EBOV GP reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls
and normalizing to the signal from wild-type GP-transfected controls. Mutated residues within clones were identified as critical to
the mAb epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test mAb but did support reactivity of other control EBOV mAbs. This
counter-screen strategy facilitated the exclusion of GP mutants that were misfolded locally or that exhibited an expression defect.
The detailed algorithms used to interpret shotgun mutagenesis data were described previously (Davidson and Doranz, 2014).
Generation of virus neutralization escape mutants
To generate escape mutants for EBOV-520 and �442 mAbs, 100 PFU of EBOV-eGFP were combined with 2-fold dilutions of the
respective mAb starting at 200 mg/mL in U-bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 1 hr at 37�C. Mixtures were placed on Vero-
E6 cell monolayer cultures in 96-well plates and incubated for 1 hr. Supernatants were removed, freshly-diluted mAb was added
at the same concentrations in 200 mL of MEM supplemented with 2% FBS, and plates were incubated for 7 days at 37�C. Viruses
that replicated in the presence of the highest concentrations of mAb, as determined by monitoring eGFP fluorescence by
microscopy, were collected. 20 mL aliquots were incubated with 2-fold dilutions of mAbs starting at 200 mg/mL, and viruses were
propagated in the presence of mAbs as described above. The procedure was repeated once more with mAb dilutions starting at
400 mg/mL. Viruses that replicated at the highest mAb concentrations were amplified in Vero-E6 cell culture monolayers in
24-well plates in the presence of mAbs at 200 mg/mL for 7 days. Cells were used for isolation of RNA using TRIzol reagent, and
cDNA copies of viral RNA encoding GP were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. To determine susceptibility of the isolated escape
mutants to mAbs, 100 PFU of the viruses in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS in triplicate were combined in U-bottom 96-well plates
with 8 to 12 two-fold dilutions of mAb, starting at 200 mg/mL, in total volumes of 50 mL, and incubated for 1 hr at 37�C. The virus/anti-
body mixtures then were added in triplicate to Vero-E6 cell culture monolayers in 96-well plates, incubated for 1 hr at 37�C, washed
e8
Immunity 49, 363–374.e1–e10, August 21, 2018
 with MEM, overlaid with 200 mL of MEM containing 2% FBS and 0.8% methylcellulose, and incubated for 48 hr at 37�C. Plates were
fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (Fisher). Plaques were counted using a fluorescence microscopy.
To generate EBOV-515 escape mutants, aliquots containing 100 PFU of rVSV/EBOV-GP virus were pre-incubated with serial 2-fold
dilutions starting from 200 mg/mL of mAb for 1 hr at 37�C and inoculated into 96-well plate Vero-E6 cell monolayers. After 48 hr, virus
samples were harvested and titrated. Virus-positive samples from the highest mAb concentration were selected for the next passage.
After seven passages, a 200 PFU virus aliquot was pre-incubated with mAb EBOV-515 and inoculated into a 24-well plate Vero-E6
cell monolayer culture. After 72 hr, the infected cell monolayer was solubilized in TRIzol (Ambion, Life Technologies) and subjected to
total RNA isolation, RT-PCR and sequencing of EBOV GP.
Neutralization assays
Antibody neutralization assays were performed in a high-throughput or plaque reduction format using the recombinant EBOV-eGFP,
rVSV/EBOV-GP, or chimeric EBOV viruses in which GP was replaced with its counterpart from BDBV or SUDV as described previ-
ously (Ilinykh et al., 2016; Towner et al., 2005). For the assays with thermolysin-cleaved virus, rVSV/EBOV-GP virus was propagated
in Vero-E6 cells. At 48 hr after infection, virus suspension was harvested and clarified from cell debris by centrifugation for 10 min at
10,000 x g. Next, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged through a 25% sucrose cushion for 2 hr at 175,000 x g at 4�C. Pelleted virus
was resuspended in thermolysin digestion buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.5 mM CaCl2 pH 8.0) and divided into 2 aliquots: one aliquot was
treated with 0.5 mg/mL of thermolysin (Promega), another one – with equal volume of thermolysin digestion buffer (mock-treated
virus) for 40 min at 37�C. The reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA up to the final concentration 10 mM. Virus samples
were re-pelleted through a 25% sucrose cushion and were washed by ultracentrifugation in buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0)
and 0.1 M NaCl for 1 hr at 175,000 x g at 4�C. Virus pellets were resuspended in the same buffer, incubated with serial mAb dilutions
for 1 hr at 37�C, or mock-incubated, and titrated by applying to Vero-E6 cell culture monolayers in triplicate.
Antibody-mediated cellular phagocytosis by human monocytes (ADCP)
Recombinant EBOV GP DTM (IBT Bioservices) was biotinylated and coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 Neutravidin beads (Life Technolo-
gies). Antibodies were diluted to 5mg/ml in cell culture medium and incubated with beads for 2 hr at 37�C. THP-1 monocytes (ATCC)
were added at 2.5 3 104 cells per well and incubated for �18 hr at 37�C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on
a BD LSRII flow cytometer, and a phagocytic score was determined using the percentage of FITC+ cells and the median fluorescence
intensity of the FITC+ cells. The glycan cap-specific mAb c13C6 (IBT Bioservices) was used as a positive control, and the HIV-specific
mAb 2G12 (Polymun Scientifics) was used as a negative control.
Antibody-mediated neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP)
Recombinant EBOV GP DTM (IBT Bioservices) was biotinylated and coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 Neutravidin beads (Life Technolo-
gies). Antibodies were diluted to 5 mg/mL in cell culture medium and incubated with beads for 2 hr at 37�C. White blood cells were
isolated from donor peripheral blood by lysis of red blood cells, followed by three washes with PBS. Cells were added at a concen-
tration of 5.0 3 104 cells/well and incubated for 1 hr at 37�C. Cells were stained with CD66b (Pacific Blue, Clone G10F5; BioLegend),
CD3 (Alexa 700, Clone UCHT1; BD Biosciences), and CD14 (APC-Cy7, Clone M4P9; BD Biosciences), and fixed with 4% parafor-
maldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD LSR II flow cytometer. Neutrophils were defined as SSC-Ahigh CD66b+, CD3-,
CD14-. A phagocytic score was determined using the percentage of FITC+ cells and the median fluorescence intensity of the FITC+
cells. The glycan cap-specific mAb c13C6 (IBT Bioservices) was used as a positive control, and the HIV-specific mAb 2G12 (Polymun
Scientifics) was used as a negative control.
Antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation
Recombinant EBOV GP DTM (IBT Bioservices) was coated onto a MaxiSorp 96 well plates (Nunc) at 300 ng/well at 4�C for 18 hr. Wells
were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Antibodies were diluted to 5 mg/mL in PBS,
and added to the plates, and were incubated for an additional 2 hr at 37�C. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing three
times with PBS, and human NK cells freshly isolated from peripheral blood of human donors by negative selection (Stem Cell Tech-
nologies, Canada) were added at 5 3 104 cells/well in the presence of 4 mg/mL brefeldin A (Sigma Aldrich) and 5 mg/mL GolgiStop (Life
Technologies) and anti-CD107a antibody (PE-Cy5, Clone H4A3, BD Biosciences). Plates were incubated for 5 hr at 37�C. Cells were
stained for NK cell markers (CD56 PE-Cy7, clone B159, BD Biosciences; CD16 APC-Cy7, clone 3G8, BD Biosciences; CD3 Alexa
Fluor700, clone UCHT1, BD Biosciences), followed by fixation and permeabilization with Fix and Perm (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions to stain for intracellular IFNg (APC, Clone B27, BD Biosciences) and MIP-1b (PE, Clone D21-1351,
BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed on a BD LSRII flow cytometer. The glycan cap-specific mAb c13C6 (IBT Bioservices) was used
as a positive control, and the HIV-specific mAb 2G12 (Polymun Scientifics, Austria) was used as a negative control.
Antibody-mediated complement deposition (ADCD)
Recombinant EBOV GP (IBT Bioservices) was biotinylated and coupled to red fluorescent Neutravidin beads (Life Technologies). An-
tibodies were diluted to 5mg/mL in RPMI-1640, and incubated with GP-coated beads for 2 hr at 37�C. Freshly reconstituted guinea
pig complement (Cedarlane Labs) was diluted in veronal buffer with 0.1% fish gelatin (Boston Bioproducts), added to the antibody-
bead complexes, and incubated for 20 min at 37�C. Beads were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline containing 15 mM

e9
 EDTA, and stained with an anti-guinea pig C3 antibody conjugated to FITC (MP Biomedicals) for 15 min at ambient temperature.
Beads were washed twice more with PBS, and C3 deposition onto beads was analyzed on a BD LSRII flow cytometer and the median
fluorescence intensity of the FITC+ of all beads was measured.
Rapid fluorimetric antibody-mediated cytotoxicity assay (RFADCC)
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of EBOV GP-reactive IgG or Fab was quantified with an EBOV-adapt-
ed modification of the RFADCC assay (Domi et al., 2018; Orlandi et al., 2016). Briefly, a target cell line was made by transfecting 293F
cells with a full-length DNA expressing GP from the EBOV-Kikwit isolate followed by transfecting with two separate DNA constructs
expressing EGFP and the chimeric CCR5-SNAP tag protein. The new cell line, designated EBOV GPkik-293FS EGFP CCR5-SNAP,
expresses EBOV-Kikwit GP on the plasma membrane, EGFP in the cytoplasm and the SNAP-tag CCR5, which can be specifically
labeled with SNAP-Surface Alexa Fluor-647 (NEB), on the cell surface (Domi et al., 2018). A human anti-EBOV GP mAb KZ52
(a neutralizing antibody) (IBT) were used as positive control and the unrelated human mAb DENV 2D22 as a negative control. The
ADCC activity was quantified by incubating three-fold serial dilutions of mAbs with EBOV GPkik-293FS EGFP CCR5-SNAP target
cells for 15 min at ambient temperature and then adding human PBMC as effector cells for 2 hr at 37�C, after which cells were washed
once with PBS, fixed with 2% PFA, stained and analyzed with an LSRII Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was
performed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). The percentage cytotoxicity of the mAb was determined as the number of target
cells losing EGFP (by virtue of ADCC) but retaining the surface expression of CCR5-SNAP.
Analysis of viremia by plaque assay
Virus titration was performed in Vero-E6 cells by plaque assay on serum samples collected from ferrets, as previously described
(Ilinykh et al., 2016) with some modifications. Briefly, duplicate 10-fold serial dilutions of sera were applied to Vero-E6 cell monolayers
in 96 well plates for 1 hr, covered with 100 mL of 0.9% methylcellulose (Sigma) overlay and incubated at 37�C for 6 days. The overlay
was removed, cell monolayers were fixed with formalin, washed three times with PBS, and blocked for 1 hr with 5% non-fat dry milk in
PBS-T. Plaques were immunostained with rabbit anti-GP primary antibodies (IBT Bioservices) at a 1:5,000 followed by goat-anti rab-
bit secondary IgG polyclonal HRP-labeled antibody (KPL) at a 1:1,000 dilution in PBS-T. Virus plaques were visualized by staining
with a 4CN two component peroxidase substrate system (KPL). The limit of detection was 100 PFU/mL.
Serum chemistry markers
Serum samples were tested for concentrations of albumin, amylase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase,
glucose, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorus, calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and globulin by
using a VetScan VS2 Chemistry Analyzer with comprehensive Diagnostic Profile Reagent Rotor Package (Abaxis).
Single particle electron microscopy
Antibody Fab proteins were obtained by recombinant expression as described above or were generated by digestion of the corre-
sponding IgG with papain (ThermoFisher). Fabs of EBOV-515 or EBOV-520 were added in 5 M excess to EBOV GP DTM and allowed
to bind overnight at 4�C. Complexes were purified subsequently by size exclusion chromatography on an S200 Increase column
(GE HealthCare), then deposited on copper mesh grids coated with carbon and stained 2% uranyl formate. Micrographs were
collected using a 120KeV Tecnai Spirit with TVIPS TemCam F416 (4k x 4k) at a defocus of about 1.5e-06 defocus and a dose of
25e-/A
˚ 2. Micrographs were collected using Leginon (Potter et al., 1999) and processed on Appion (Lander et al., 2009). Particles
were picked using DoGpicker (Voss et al., 2009) and aligned with MSA/MRA (Ogura et al., 2003) where excess Fab or blurry particles
were removed. An unbinned, clean dataset was deposited into Relion (Scheres, 2012) where 3D classification and refinement was
performed. Figures were created in Chimera to compare EBOV complexes and show epitope location.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The descriptive statistics mean ± SEM or mean ± SD were determined for continuous variables as noted. Survival curves were esti-
mated using the Kaplan Meier method and curves compared using the two-sided log rank test with subjects right censored, if they
survived until the end of the study. Comparisons of viral titers were performed using a Mann-Whitney U test. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01;
***p < 0.001; ns – non-significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism v7.2 (GraphPad).
