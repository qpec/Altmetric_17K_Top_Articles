There are many examples of apparent manipulation of host phenotype by
parasites, yet few examples of hypermanipulation—where a phenotype-
manipulating parasite is itself manipulated by a parasite. Moreover, few
studies confirm manipulation is occurring by quantifying whether the host’s
changed phenotype increases parasite fitness. Here we describe a novel
case of hypermanipulation, in which the crypt gall wasp Bassettia pallida
(a phenotypic manipulator of its tree host) is manipulated by the parasitoid
crypt-keeper wasp Euderus set, and show that the host’s changed behaviour
increases parasitoid fitness. Bassettia pallida parasitizes sand live oaks and
induces the formation of a ‘crypt’ within developing stems. When parasitized
by E. set, B. pallida adults excavate an emergence hole in the crypt wall, plug
the hole with their head and die. We show experimentally that this pheno-
menon benefits E. set, as E. set that need to excavate an emergence hole
themselves are about three times more likely to die trapped in the crypt.
In addition, we discuss museum and field data to explore the distribution of
the crypt-keeping phenomena.
1. Introduction
Many animals are infected by parasites that modify host phenotype in ways
that benefit the parasites while harming the host [1–4]. This phenomenon is
known as parasite manipulation, and when manipulation is occurring the
host phenotype is an extended phenotype of the parasite [5]. Examples include
parasites that change host behaviour or appearance in ways that increase the
host’s risk of being eaten by the next host in the parasite’s life cycle [6–8],
and parasitoids that induce their insect hosts to commit ‘suicide’ by jumping
into water so the parasitoid can find mates and complete the aquatic phase
of its life cycle [9,10]. These parasites can have important ecological impli-
cations [11,12], and by understanding how parasites induce complex changes
in host phenotype, we are exploring novel links between the immune system,
nervous system and behaviour [13].
Theobservation that the manipulationappearsto befairly widespread maylead
one to wonder—are also the manipulators manipulated? That is, how common is
hypermanipulation? One example of a manipulated manipulator is the fungus
Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, which manipulates its arboreal ant host (Camponotus
leonardi) into leaving its nest in search of a location that is amenable to fungal repro-
duction [14]. Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is itself susceptible to castration by another
fungus [15]. Additionally, the dipteran tree parasite Masakimyia pustulae manip-
ulates its tree host into producing leaf galls, and M. pustulae may be manipulated
by its parasitoid Plastygaster sp. into producing thicker leaf galls that protect the
parasitoid from hyperparasites [16]. Overall, examples of hypermanipulators are
rare, but are important to identify and study as any ecological impacts associated
with parasite manipulation of host phenotype may be modified in the presence of
a hypermanipulator (e.g. [15]).

 Many apparent examples of manipulation lack direct
experimental evidence of a fitness benefit to the parasite associ-
ated with the changed host phenotype [8]. Host phenotype
may also change following infection owing to pathology or
host compensation for infection [17], and in some systems
where manipulationappearedtobeoccurring,itwaslater deter-
mined that the modified host phenotype did not in fact benefit
the parasite (i.e. the host trait in question was probably not
manipulated) [18]. Here, we both introduce a previously undo-
cumented case of hypermanipulation (figure 1, and for an
artist’s illustration see the electronic supplementary material,
figure S1) and manipulate the system to provide strong support
that the observed changes in host behaviour benefit the parasite.
The host in this system is the asexual stage of the crypt gall
wasp Bassettia pallida, a cynipid wasp found on sand live oaks
(Quercus geminata) and southern live oaks (Quercus virginiana)
in the southeastern USA [19–21]. Gall wasps induce changes
in the morphology of their plant host, and in other gall wasp
systems these morphological changes appear to benefit the
host by protecting it from natural enemies [22,23]. The stem
galls induced by B. pallida are known as crypts, which are
tiny compartments in which B. pallida undergoes development
before it excavates through the stem to emerge as an adult.
While working in this system, we observed that many B. pallida
had excavated emergence holes out of their crypts, but had died
with their head plugging the holes. Dissections of 11 head-
plugged crypts revealed clear evidence of a parasitoid in 10
cases, and one case where indirect evidence of a parasitoid
was present. We never observed the egg stage of the parasitoid.
However, in head-plugged crypts, we observed larval and
pupal stages of the parasitoid residing partly within the crypt
and partly within the host’s body. This suggests that the
manipulation of the host occurred sometime between the ovi-
position event and the larval parasitoid stage. The parasitoid

 appears to infect the adult host stage, as the parasitoid was
never observed in a crypt with a larval or pupal host. The para-
sitoid was a previously undescribed eulophid parasitoid wasp,
which we have named the ‘crypt-keeper wasp’ Euderus set
(named after Set, the Ancient Egyptian God of evil and chaos)
and is described elsewhere [24].
Inthispaper,we:(i)provideobservationaldataonthetiming
of E. set emergence; (ii) quantify the fitness benefit to E. set of
the ‘crypt-keeping’ phenomenon; and (iii) present museum
and field data elucidating the temporal and geographical
distribution of crypt-keeping manipulation.
2. Material and methods
(a) Sample collection
Stems infected by B. pallida were collected from Inlet Beach, Flor-
ida (South Walton Beach County Park: 30.273517, 286.002499)
in early August 2015 and mid-October 2015. Infected stems
were found by visual inspection of sand live oaks (Q. geminata)
within a 2 km radius. Stems were cut off the tree and stored in
a plastic bag for transport to the laboratory.
(b) Identification and natural history of host
and parasite
The asexual generation of B. pallida Ashmead 1896 forms crypt-like
stem galls hidden under the bark of host plants Q. geminata
and Q. virginiana across the southeastern USA (FL, GA, AL, MS,
LA and TX) [20,21]. Asexual generation adults emerge in the
spring and adult emergence timing is synchronized with new leaf
growth on its host plant, where the sexual generation is hypoth-
esized to develop within galls on the midvein of new leaves (S. P.
Egan 2016, unpublished data). The crypt-keeper wasp, E. set, is a
parasitoid that appears to specialize on the asexual generation of
the crypt gall wasp B. pallida on American live oaks in the genus
Quercus and the subsection Virentes [19–21]. This is, to our knowl-
edge, the first documented case of a member of the genus Euderus
in this system [25].
(c) Observational data on emergence timing
Stems collected from the field were brought back to Rice Univer-
sity, Houston, TX, USA, where they were processed under a
dissecting microscope. All visible holes were numbered using a
black marker, and hole status was noted as either ‘B. pallida emer-
gence hole’ (an emergence hole that appeared to lead to an
empty crypt), ‘head-plugged hole’ (an emergence hole plugged
with a B. pallida head) and ‘E. set emergence hole’ (an emergence
hole plugged with a B. pallida head, where the host’s head
capsule contained a hole from which a E. set had emerged)
(figure 1). All hole states were re-examined following dissection
at the end of the experiment (see Crypt dissections section).
Each stem was individually placed in a clear plastic cup, and a
coffee filter secured by a rubber band covered the top of the cup.
This housing allowed sunlight and air to penetrate the cup, but
prevented the escape of insects that emerged from the stems.
Cups were placed in bins and kept on a table in a shaded walkway
exposed to natural conditions, but protected from rain and direct
sunlight. The cups experienced natural daylight cycles and were
exposed to naturally fluctuating temperature and humidity
levels. Coffee filters were removed and the cups were misted
with tap water once in February, and were misted weekly in
March to mimic spring rain along the Gulf coast.
Cups were checked 5 days a week for emergences. Emerged
insects were collected, placed in 96% ethanol and stored at
2808C for future analysis. When an emergence occurred, the
stem was placed under a dissecting scope to look for new emer-
gence holes or changes in the status of previous holes. The
emergent insect was classified as E. set, B. pallida, or was ident-
ified as an inquiline or other parasitoid of B. pallida. These data
provide us a first look at the timing of emergence for B. pallida,
E. set, and the community of other parasitoids and inquilines
associated with the asexual phase of this cynipid wasp.
We also observed differences in the diameters of emergence
holes excavated by infected and uninfected B. pallida, which we
discuss in the electronic supplementary material, Emergence
hole analysis section.
(d) Does the crypt-keeping phenomenon benefit
Euderus set?
We hypothesized that the crypt-keeping phenomenon was an adap-
tive manipulation of B. pallida by E. set, and increased E. set fitness
through oneortworoutes: (i) E. set benefits from B. pallidaexcavation
of the emergence hole through the wood and bark of the tree as the
parasitoid is less able or unable to excavate its own hole, and (ii) the
B. pallida head-plug continues to seal the crypt from external abiotic
conditions that may prohibit E. set development.
If E. set is able to manipulate B. pallida to create and sub-
sequently plug an emergence hole, then E. set would only need
to cut through or move aside the head of B. pallida to emerge. To
test this hypothesis, we created a ‘reseal’ treatment where we
resealed a subset of the head-plugged holes with bark, which
would require E. set to excavate through both B. pallida’s head cap-
sule and the bark to emerge as an adult. Euderus set emerging
completely independent of host manipulation would need to
chew through gall-associated plant material, typical woody
tissue and bark to emerge. As chewing through the host’s head
capsule is probably less difficult than chewing through wood,
this treatment may underestimate the difficulty E. set would
experience if forced to emerge independently. Bark came from
freshly harvested Q. virginiana stems on Rice University campus.
A thin piece of bark was removed using a razorblade, and bark
was soaked in tap water to make it pliable. Bark was placed over
the head-plugged hole and secured using thin strips of standard
laboratory labelling tape. The tape was placed so it held the bark
over the hole without covering the hole. This hypothesis is specific
to the adult stages of E. set, as only this stage would need to exca-
vate an emergence hole. We predicted that survival would be
highest for adult E. set in the ‘control’ treatment, and lower in
the ‘reseal’ treatment, as E. set adults would need to emerge
through B. pallida’s head capsule and bark in this treatment.
One hypothesized function of galls is to provide favourable
abiotic conditions for the gall-former residing within [22,26].
To test this hypothesis, we identified a subset of head-plugged
holes and created a ‘breach’ treatment by using an insect pin to
poke a hole in the top of B. pallida’s head. This breached the
crypts and probably exposed the crypt contents to external con-
ditions. However, this method could result in E. set mortality
through two routes: by changing abiotic conditions, or because
poking an insect pin into a crypt damaged E. set. To isolate the
effect of mortality caused by poking an insect pin into a crypt
with a developing parasitoid, we created a ‘breach & reseal’ treat-
ment by covering a subset of the breach treatments with bark
using the methods we described previously. We predicted that
breaching the crypt would reduce the survival of all life stages
of E. set, and E. set survival would be equal in control and
breach & reseal treatments.
Manipulations were performed over two sessions. Head-
plugged holes on stems collected during the August harvest
session received treatments over five consecutive days in late
August and early September, while stems harvested in October
were treated over six consecutive days in early November. Survi-
val status of E. set was determined by daily checks for E. set

 emergence as described earlier, and through dissections (see
Crypt dissections section).
(e) Temporal and geographical observational data on
the crypt-keeping phenomenon
We
encountered
additional
evidence
of
the
crypt-keeping
phenomenon in preserved specimens from the cynipid collections
in the Smithsonian (US National Museum) and the American
Museum of Natural History, as well as in the field. For museum
specimens, we examined preserved Bassettia infested branches
and quantified emergence holes that appeared to be a Bassettia
emergence hole, a head-plugged hole or a Euderus emergence
hole. Observations on museum specimens could not be confirmed
with
dissections.
For
field-collected
specimens
from
other
localities, holes were categorized, and hole status was confirmed
by dissection (see Crypt dissections section).
(f) Crypt dissections
We examined crypt contents during dissections by running a
razorblade across the top of the stem until the inner crypt was
revealed. As described previously, each crypt was categorized
along a continuum as B. pallida emergence hole, head-plugged
hole or E. set emergence hole. When E. set emerges or sometime
after, the exoskeleton of B. pallida (including its head capsule) can
fall back into the depths of the crypt, as many parasitoids will
consume their host from the inside out leaving only the exoske-
leton behind [27]. For this reason, any instance of an emergence
hole containing B. pallida exoskeleton with no evidence of E. set
remaining was deemed an E. set emergence hole. At this time,
we also determined the fate of E. set. If remains of E. set were
found in a crypt, then we recorded whether the remains were
of the larval, pupal or adult stage. If we found an empty crypt
containing B. pallida host remains, we determined that an adult
E. set had emerged.
(g) Statistical analyses
We performed all statistical analyses in RSTUDIO v. 0.99.489 [28] run-
ning R v. 3.2.2 [29]. Models were created using the glmer function in
the lme4 package [30]. Model comparisons were achieved using
Akaike information criterion corrected (AICc) for small sample
sizes [31], and model-averaged beta coefficients with 95% confi-
dence intervals were obtained using the AICmodavg package [32].
We competed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs)
specifying a logit link function to examine how E. set survival
was impacted by the treatments. All models contained a
random intercept for stem ID. We competed four models to
explore how our treatments impacted survival across all life
stages: one null model (containing only the random intercept),
one model containing a predictor for manipulation treatment
(i.e. control, reseal, breach & reseal or breach), one model con-
taining a predictor for stem harvest session, and one containing
predictors for both manipulation treatment and stem harvest ses-
sion. We did not include models with an interaction term, as
sample sizes in August were low and we had no a priori reason
to expect an interaction. We ran these models twice. The
models were first run on a dataset restricted to only instances
in which E. set had survived to adulthood, which allowed us
to test our first hypothesis that E. set may have reduced survival
when adults have to excavate their own emergence hole. We then
ran the models looking at survival across all E. set life stages
(i.e. including E. set that died as a larva, pupa or adult, as well
as E. set that successfully emerged as adults), which allowed us
to test our second hypothesis that breaching a crypt creates abio-
tic conditions unfavourable to E. set survival. Model-averaged
predictor estimates and 95% confidence intervals were obtained
using the modavg function.
3. Results
(a) Observational data on emergence timing
From our Inlet Beach (FL) stems, 150 E. set emerged over the
course of the project. While sporadic emergences occurred
from mid-August through to late March, the main pulse of
emergence (75% of emergences) occurred from mid-February
through to mid-March. Some of these emergences occurred
through crypts from which the head-plugging phenomenon
was not observed, revealing that E. set is rarely able to emerge
from crypts from which hosts have not excavated complete
emergence holes. Two B. pallida emerged, with one emergence
in mid-November and the other in mid-December. The rarity of
B. pallida was not surprising, as adults should emerge in the
spring synchronized with new leaf growth of their host plants
[20]. Based on our observations, it appears that E. set undergoes
development in the crypt during the time when the sexual stage
of B. pallida resides in leaf galls, suggesting E. set only infects the
asexual, crypt-making host stage.
A total of 39 other natural enemies (parasitoids or inqui-
lines) emerged from the branches. Their emergences occurred
throughout the duration of the experiment, and comprised
20% of the emergences we observed. These organisms were
never associated with the crypt-keeping phenomenon, and
all appeared to emerge from the crypts by creating their
own emergence holes. The parasitoids included three species
from the genus Sycophila, two species from genus Ormyrus,
one each from the genera Eurytoma, Acaenacis and Brasema,
and a platygastrid from the subfamily Platygastrinae. The
inquilines included a species from the genus Synergus and
another from the genus Ceroptres.
(b) Does the crypt-keeping phenomenon benefit
Euderus set?
A total of 172 head-plugged holes were included in this exper-
iment. The initial treatment sizes were 59, 37, 38 and 38 for the
control, breach, reseal and breach & reseal treatments, respect-
ively. Eight samples were removed from the analysis because
the state of the crypt could not be determined unambiguously.
The final sample size for analysis was 56, 35, 36 and 37 for con-
trol, breach, reseal and breach & reseal treatments, respectively.
When the data were restricted to include only instances where
E. set survived to adulthood, the sample sizes became 26, 12, 13
and 14 for the control, breach, breach & reseal and reseal treat-
ments, respectively. Mortality was present across experimental
treatments, including only 39% of all E. set surviving in the con-
trol group (figure 2), however, plant-mediated gall former
death greater than 50% is common [33–35].
When we restricted our analysis to include only E. set that
had survived to adulthood, we found that the model contain-
ing predictors for manipulation treatment and harvest date
had the best fit and highest AICc weight (residual d.f. ¼ 59;
DAICc ¼ 0, AICc weight ¼ 0.8). The model containing only
manipulation treatment received the rest of the AICc weight
(residual d.f. ¼ 60; DAICc ¼ 2.83, AICc weight ¼ 0.2). Breach-
ing the crypts did not appear to reduce survival, while the
breach & reseal and reseal treatments were associated with
reliably negative log-likelihoods and thus reduced survival

 (table 1). The log-likelihood for the October harvest session was
negative, but the 95% confidence interval included zero. Bring-
ing stems into the laboratory later in the season either slightly
reduced or did not impact the survival of adult E. set. While we
did not look for interactions specifically, we note that running
GLMMs to look for differences between the control and reseal
treatments on the August and October datasets separately
yielded qualitatively similar results.
The model that best predicted the survival of E. set across
all life stages included terms for manipulation treatment
and harvest session (residual d.f. ¼ 158; DAICc ¼ 0, AICc
weight ¼ 0.96). The model-averaged log-likelihoods for survi-
val (table 1) were negative for breach & reseal and reseal
treatments, and did not overlap with zero. The log-likelihood
for the breach treatment was negative, but the 95% confidence
interval overlapped with zero and so we are unable to say with
certainty whether or not allowing ambient air into a crypt
reduced E. set survival. The log-likelihood for the October
session was negative, suggesting that E. set residing in stems
collected at a later date were less likely to survive than those
collected in August. While we did not look for interactions
specifically, we note that running GLMMs to look for differ-
ences between the control, breach, and breach and reseal
treatments on the August and October datasets separately
yielded qualitatively similar results.
(c) Temporal and geographical observational data on
the crypt-keeping phenomenon
In addition to Inlet Beach (FL), we encountered evidence of
the crypt-keeping phenomena on Q. virginiana and Q. geminata
at four additional field sites across Florida, Mississippi and
Texas
(electronic
supplementary
material,
table
S1).
In
addition, we found historical samples in the cynipid collection
at the Smithsonian, which suggests that this phenomenon has
been ongoing since at least 1983 in this system involving live
oaks, B. pallida and E. set.
In addition to observations in this specific system, we made
observations of the crypt-keeping phenomenon outside of the
live oak–B. pallida–E. set interaction. We observed branches
with Bassettia emergence holes plugged with a Bassettia head
capsule and Bassettia head capsules with Euderus-like emer-
gence holes from field-collected samples on Quercus nigra in
Houston, TX, USA, and on Quercus lobata and Quercus douglasii
galled tissue from the cynpid collections at the American
Museum of Natural History (electronic supplementary material,
figure S2). This suggests that other members of the genus Basset-
tia may be manipulated by other species of Euderus across its
range.
4. Discussion
The manipulation of host behaviour by parasites excites
scientists across the spectrum, including neurobiologists, evol-
utionary biologists, physiologists and ecologists, as well as the
general public [1,11,13,36–38], but few of these documented
interactions provide a clear test of the fitness benefits for the
parasite arising from parasite-associated host phenotypic
changes [8]. In this study, we found that the crypt gall wasp
B. pallida is infected by a previously undescribed parasitoid
in the genus Euderus. Infection by E. set is associated with the

 host excavating a small emergence hole (figure 1 and see the
electronic supplementary material, figure S1), and then plug-
ging this hole with their head. This host behaviour benefits
E. set, as E. set adults that had to excavate through bark them-
selves were about three times more likely to die trapped in the
crypt relative to E. set that only needed to emerge through the
host’s head capsule (table 1 and figure 2). As parasitoids exca-
vating through a breached host’s head had similar survival to
parasitoids that had to breach the host’s head on their own
(95% CIs for the breach & reseal treatment and the reseal treat-
ment overlapped considerably), our experimental results
suggest that the major cost of emergence is cutting through
the bark. Euderus set emerging independently would need to
cut through gall tissue of plant origin, typical woody tissue
and bark, so our treatment (where E. set emerge through host
cuticle and bark) may have underestimated the difficultly of
emergence without host assistance. This system adds to a
small, but growing set of examples of host–parasitoid systems
where manipulation of host behaviour increases parasitoid
fitness [9,14,39–42].
We provided clear evidence that E. set benefits from the
crypt-keeping
phenomenon.
While
this
result
strongly
suggests that the manipulation is occurring, identifying the
mechanism through which manipulation is induced would
provide additional support. Energy drain is a common
strategy used by parasites to manipulate their hosts [43],
and E. set may have induced the crypt-keeping behaviour
by draining enough energy that the host subsequently
created a smaller excavation hole and died plugging the
hole. Alternatively, injection of compounds into the host by
the ovipositing E. set or secretion of compounds by the devel-
oping parasitoid may have induced the manipulation [13,44].
Teasing apart the specific induction methods beyond the
presence of E. set is the next step, thus, we carefully con-
sidered
alternative
explanations
to
manipulation.
One
possible alternative is that this behavioural phenotype is cir-
cumstantial, in that the parasitoid is simply benefiting from a
pre-existing host behaviour. During our dissections, we
noticed instances where adult E. set had died trapped in a
crypt in which B. pallida had not excavated an emergence
hole, or had excavated a partial emergence hole that did
not extend to the stem surface. This observation suggests
there is variability in the ability of E. set to manipulate its
host. However, the parasitoid could rather be searching out
this behaviour and benefit from instances when its host
engages in head-plugging behaviour. We think the ‘imperfect
manipulation’ option is more likely for three critical reasons.
First, traits of either host or parasite may influence the ability
of the parasite to manipulate host phenotype [17,45,46],
making variation in the expression of the manipulated phe-
notype likely (i.e. making it unsurprising that we observed
55 cases of what may be failed or incomplete manipulation).
Second, the crypt-keeping phenomenon is tightly correlated
with the presence of the parasitoid. In the 168 head-plugged
holes in the experiment for which we were able to clearly exam-
ine crypt contents, in only four cases (i.e. 2% of cases) did we
not find clear evidence of E. set. Additionally, dissections
done in 2014 and 2015 found clear evidence of E. set in head-
plugged holes in 37 of 39 instances and 10 of 11 instances,
respectively. In cases where we did not find direct evidence
of E. set, the parasitoid still may have been present, yet died
at an early stage (e.g. when still an egg), decayed and left no
trace. Given the high congruence between the crypt-keeping
phenomenon and the presence of E. set, in order for the parasi-
toid to be benefiting from a pre-existing host behaviour rather
than inducing the behaviour itself the ovipositing E. set would
need to deposit her eggs in crypts where B. pallida was in the
process of excavating an emergence hole, and the host would
need to be paralysed or killed while excavating. When excavat-
ing B. pallida were unavailable, ovipositing E. set would instead
oviposit in less desirable crypts in which B. pallida had not
begun to excavate an emergence hole. We suspect this is not
occurring because we would not expect to see a difference in
emergence hole size between crypts containing E. set and
those that do not (as described in the electronic supplementary
material, Emergence hole analysis section) if B. pallida is simply
being stopped in its tracks at some point in the excavation pro-
cess. Additionally, we expect that E. set would be less tightly
coupled with the crypt-keeping phenomenon if E. set were con-
strained to finding hosts in the process of emerging (rather than
hosts simply residing in their crypts), but mechanistic work or
observations during the E. set ovipositing period would be
necessary to confirm. Finally, if taking advantage of pre-exist-
ing stuck gall wasps was a regular phenomenon, then we
should see it in other gall-forming species in our live oak
system—but we do not. In over 10 years of sampling, six differ-
ent gall wasps species on live oaks (ranging from south Florida
to Texas), we rarely see cynpids getting stuck (S. P. Egan 2006–
2016 personal observation). When they do get stuck, it is
usually between their head and thorax, and sometimes they
get stuck completely intact and still in their gall. We never
see the same head plug just below the surface of the bark
with the head facing out, as we see when E. set infects B. pallida.
Conservatively, our knowledge of this phenomenon in other
gall-forming species arises from detailed observation of over
100 000 galls. In the rare instances we see non-B. pallida gall
wasps get stuck in the gall or between their head and their
larger thorax or abdomen, we have dissected these galls and
never seen Euderus in its abdomen.
We found no evidence of reduced E. set survival in our
breach treatment, despite our predictions that breaching the
head-plugged crypts would result in reduced E. set survival
owing to less than optimal abiotic conditions within breached
crypts. This suggests that the head-plugging part of the crypt-
keeping phenomena may not directly benefit E. set, and may
simply arise because B. pallida manipulated into excavating
small emergence holes get stuck. Alternatively, the benefit
of head plugging may simply be that this behaviour prevents
the host from emerging completely (which is critical as the
parasitoid has not yet completed consuming the host), or
the benefit may be something that we failed to measure.
While keeping the cups outdoors allowed for semi-natural
light and humidity conditions, maintaining the cups in this
way may have excluded some ecologically relevant stressors.
For example, in a previous year we observed a fairy wasp
(Mymaridae, Chalcidoidea and Hymenoptera) emerge from
infected stems, and fairy wasps have been reported to be
hyperparasitoids of other Eulophid wasps (e.g. [47]). The
hyperparasitoid may be an additionally important source of
E. set mortality, but our experimental design did not allow
for possible exposure to fairy wasps or other natural enemies
of E. set. Manipulation to reduce hyperparasitism has been
observed in other systems [16,39], and it is possible that
head plugging makes it more difficult for hyperparasitoids
to access the crypt (relative to breached or completely open
crypts) and infect E. set. Alternatively, the presence of the

Proc. R. Soc. B 284: 20162365
6
 head plug may actually provide to the fairy wasp an obvious
visual cue to the presence of a developing E. set. Increased
risk of encounters with natural enemies owing to manipu-
lation has been observed in other systems [48–50], and
increased hyperparasitoid infection rates due to the head-
plugging phenomenon may constitute an indirect cost of
manipulation.
The host plants for B. pallida (Q. geminata and Q. virginiana)
are found in the southeastern USA, and it is likely that
manipulation by E. set occurs throughout this range as our
field excursions identified the crypt-keeping phenomenon
occurring in Florida, Texas and Mississippi (electronic sup-
plementary material, table S1). This phenomenon was also
observed in museum samples from 1920 to 1948 on two differ-
ent oak species found in California that harbour different
Bassettia species (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).
Parasitoids are often highly host specific [51], and E. set also
appears to be host specific as it has not been observed infecting
other gall wasp species found on Q. geminata or Q. virginiana,
despite extensive work done on the gall formers of these oak
trees [21,52]. We found no evidence of the crypt-keeping
phenomenon in the literature or any similar manipulation of
other gall wasps by their parasitoids, suggesting that the
Bassettia species in California may be manipulated by a closely
related species of Euderus. The undiscovered phenomenon in
museum samples and field observations suggest it may be
worth surveying the Bassettia throughout their range to
explore the extent to which this gall wasp genus is manipu-
lated by Euderus parasitoids. Further exploration of the
extent to which Euderus manipulates its host may reveal
instances in which this parasitoid could be useful as a form
of biocontrol, as Bassettia infection can be associated with
declines in their host tree (e.g. [53]), and other Euderus species
infect insects known to be agricultural pests [25].
5. Conclusion
Few examples of hypermanipulation—where a phenotype-
manipulating parasite is itself manipulated by a parasite—have
been documented. Moreover, few studies confirm whether the
host’s changed behaviour increases parasite fitness, which is
critical for a changed host behaviour to qualify as manipulation.
Herein, we have described a novel case of hypermanipulation, in
which the crypt gall wasp B. pallida, a phenotypic manipulator of
its host plant, is manipulated by the Eulophid parasitoid, the
crypt-keeper wasp E. set, and clearly demonstrate that the
host’s changed behaviour increases parasitoid fitness. Moreover,
using museum specimens, literature review and observational
data from the field, we have highlighted a possible undocumen-
ted complex interaction that may be continental in scale (close to
600 Eulophid species in North America; [54]). This previously
undocumented phenomenon may prove economically impor-
tant, as many Eulophid parasitoids attack and(or) serve as
biocontrol agents for major agricultural pests, including apple
leafminers, Colorado potato beetle, asparagus beetle, fruit tree
leafrollers and western flower thrips [54].
