Background
Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disorder affecting about 300 million people worldwide. As a holistic therapy, yoga has the
potential to relieve both the physical and psychological suffering of people with asthma, and its popularity has expanded globally. A
number of clinical trials have been carried out to evaluate the effects of yoga practice, with inconsistent results.
Objectives
To assess the effects of yoga in people with asthma.
Search methods
We systematically searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic
databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and
PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also searched PEDro. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov
and the WHO ICTRP search portal. We searched all databases from their inception to 22 July 2015, and used no restriction on language
of publication. We checked the reference lists of eligible studies and relevant review articles for additional studies. We attempted to
contact investigators of eligible studies and experts in the field to learn of other published and unpublished studies.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared yoga with usual care (or no intervention) or sham intervention in
people with asthma and reported at least one of the following outcomes: quality of life, asthma symptom score, asthma control, lung
function measures, asthma medication usage, and adverse events.
Data collection and analysis
We extracted bibliographic information, characteristics of participants, characteristics of interventions and controls, characteristics of
methodology, and results for the outcomes of our interest from eligible studies. For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference
(MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to denote the treatment effects, if the outcomes were measured by the same scale across
studies. Alternatively, if the outcomes were measured by different scales across studies, we used standardised mean difference (SMD)
with 95% CI. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI to measure the treatment effects. We performed meta-
analysis with Review Manager 5.3. We used the fixed-effect model to pool the data, unless there was substantial heterogeneity among
1

 studies, in which case we used the random-effects model instead. For outcomes inappropriate or impossible to pool quantitatively, we
conducted a descriptive analysis and summarised the findings narratively.
Main results
We included 15 RCTs with a total of 1048 participants. Most of the trials were conducted in India, followed by Europe and the United
States. The majority of participants were adults of both sexes with mild to moderate asthma for six months to more than 23 years.
Five studies included yoga breathing alone, while the other studies assessed yoga interventions that included breathing, posture, and
meditation. Interventions lasted from two weeks to 54 months, for no more than six months in the majority of studies. The risk of
bias was low across all domains in one study and unclear or high in at least one domain for the remainder.
There was some evidence that yoga may improve quality of life (MD in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) score per item
0.57 units on a 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.77; 5 studies; 375 participants), improve symptoms (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.65;
3 studies; 243 participants), and reduce medication usage (RR 5.35, 95% CI 1.29 to 22.11; 2 studies) in people with asthma. The MD
for AQLQ score exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.5, but whether the mean changes exceeded the
MCID for asthma symptoms is uncertain due to the lack of an established MCID in the severity scores used in the included studies.
The effects of yoga on change from baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (MD 0.04 litres, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.19; 7 studies;
340 participants; I2 = 68%) were not statistically significant. Two studies indicated improved asthma control, but due to very significant
heterogeneity (I2 = 98%) we did not pool data. No serious adverse events associated with yoga were reported, but the data on this
outcome was limited.
Authors’ conclusions
We found moderate-quality evidence that yoga probably leads to small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with
asthma. There is more uncertainty about potential adverse effects of yoga and its impact on lung function and medication usage. RCTs
with a large sample size and high methodological and reporting quality are needed to confirm the effects of yoga for asthma.

Yoga as an additional treatment option for people with asthma
Background
Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects about 300 million people worldwide. Yoga, the popularity of which has expanded
globally, has the potential to relieve some asthma-related problems. However, the effects of yoga for asthma need to be confirmed due
to the inconsistent findings of existing studies.
Study characteristics
We reviewed 15 studies that compared the effects of yoga with usual treatment or a ’sham’ yoga in 1048 participants.
Results
We found that yoga probably improves quality of life and asthma symptoms to some extent. However, our confidence in the results is
low as most of the studies were flawed in various ways. The effects of yoga on lung function were inconsistent, and we found a small
amount of evidence indicating that yoga can reduce medication usage. Information on unwanted side effects was very limited; more
studies are needed to assess this. High-quality studies involving large numbers of participants are required for us to be able to draw a
firm conclusion about the effects of yoga for asthma.

 *The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is
based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CI: confidence interval; FEV1: forced expiratory volume in one second; RR: risk ratio; SD: standard deviation
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1Downgraded once for study limitations; four out of five studies contributing to this outcome are at high risk of performance
and detection bias, and one study is at high risk of attrition bias (see Figure 2).
2Downgraded once for study limitations; all three studies contributing to this outcome are at high risk of performance and
detection bias, and one study is at high risk of selection bias (see Figure 2).
3Downgraded for (1) study limitations: both studies contributing to this outcome are at high risk of performance and detection
bias, and one study is also at high risk of selection bias (see Figure 2), and (2) inconsistency: the studies could not be
combined in a meta-analysis due to very high levels of heterogeneity.
4Downgraded for (1) study limitations: six out of the seven studies contributing to this outcome are at unclear risk of
selection bias (see Figure 2), (2) inconsistency: we detected substantial heterogeneity (I² = 68%) in the meta-analysis, and (3)
imprecision: the confidence intervals include both the possibility of harm or benefit of the intervention.
5Downgraded for (1) study limitations: both studies contributing to this outcome are at high risk of performance and detection
bias and at unclear risk of selection bias, and one study is at high risk of other biases (see Figure 2), and (2) imprecision:
despite the confidence intervals excluding no difference, the breadth of the confidence intervals and the small numbers of
participants in the analysis reduces our confidence in the estimate.
6Downgraded for (1) study limitations: one study reporting adverse events is at high risk of performance, detection, and
attrition bias, another is at high risk of attrition and reporting bias, and a third is at unclear risk of selection bias (see Figure
2), (2) imprecision: the very small number of studies reporting very rare events reduced our confidence in this outcome, and
(3) potential publication bias due to no mention of adverse events (which were specified explicitly as one of the outcomes of
interest in their research protocol) in Prem 2013. We decided not to pool these results.

Description of the condition
Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disorder characterised
by hypersensitivity of the airways and reversible, episodic airway
obstruction (Miller 2001). Typical symptoms of asthma include
wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and dyspnoea (shortness of
breath). In addition to physiologic dysfunction, many people with
asthmaalsosufferfrompsychological distressinthe formof depres-
sion, anxiety, and emotional disorders (Adams 2004; Van Lieshout
2008). Asthma attacks and the associated panic or anxiety can
affect the lifestyle (for example social activities), well-being, and
perceived health status of people with asthma to varying degrees,
making improving quality of life an important issue in asthma
management. The prevalence of asthma has increased dramatically
over the past decade. Globally, asthma affects about 300 million
people, and this figure continues to rise (Masoli 2004; ISAAC
2006). Asthma represents a huge economic burden on society.
In the USA, the management of asthma costs more than USD
12.7 billion per year (Weiss 2001). National studies in Germany,
Switzerland, and Singapore have estimated the annual total costs
for asthma to be USD 4.43 billion, USD 1.41 billion, and USD
49 million, respectively (Chew 1999; Szucs 1999; Stock 2005).
Current guidelines for asthma treatment recommend a severity-
based, stepwise approach (Global Initiative for Asthma 2011).
Common agents used to treat people with asthma include in-
haled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists (Becker 2003).
For severe cases, additional controller medications such as an-
tileukotrienes, oral corticosteroids, and anti-immunoglobulin E
therapy are recommended (Peters 2006; Global Initiative for
Asthma 2011).
Description of the intervention
Yoga originated from ancient India and remains an important as-
pect of India’s diverse culture. Yoga includes such common com-
ponents as breathing exercises (pranayama), postures (asanas), and
meditation (dhyana) (Riley 2004). It is difficult to know exactly
how many types of yoga are being practiced around the world,
as different combinations of and variations in components could
represent a ’new’ type of yoga. To our knowledge, types of yoga
include, but are not limited to, the following: aerial yoga, Ananda
yoga, Anusara yoga, Ashtanga (or Astanga) yoga, Bhakti yoga,
Bikram yoga (hot yoga), Chair yoga, Forrest yoga, Hatha yoga,
ISHTA (Integral Science of Hatha and Tantric Arts), Iyengar yoga,
Jivamukti yoga, Jnana yoga, Kali Ray TriYoga, Karma yoga, Kri-
palu, Kriya yoga, Kundalini yoga, Mantra yoga, Moksha, Power
yoga,prenatal yoga,Purnayoga(integral yoga),Rajayoga,Restora-
tive yoga, Sahaja yoga, Satyananda yoga, Sivananda yoga, stand-up
paddle yoga, Svaroopa yoga, Swara yoga, Tibetan yoga, Viniyoga
yoga, Vinyasa yoga, and White Lotus yoga. There seems to be no
estimate of the proportion of each type of yoga taught by prac-
titioners worldwide. According to polls conducted by Yoga Jour-
nal in 2015, the most commonly practiced yoga in the USA is
Vinyasa, followed by Iyengar and Ashtanga (Yoga Journal 2015).
The common goal of yoga practitioners is to seek to attain a perfect
integration of body, mind, and spirit (Anand 1991; Kappmeier
2006).
The popularity of yoga has expanded globally, in part due to its
reputed physical and psychological benefits. The 2012 National
Health Interview Survey found that 9.5% of adults in the USA (21
million) practiced yoga, significantly more than the 5.1% in 2002
and 6.1% in 2007 (Clarke 2015). According to the available data
(which are not necessarily accurate), there were more than 3 mil-
lion adult yoga practitioners in Germany in 2004, approximately
2 million (3% of the total population) in Great Britain in 2004,
less than 1 million (around 8% of the total population) in Taiwan
in 2005, 0.5 to 1 million (0.4% to 0.8% of the total population)
in Japan in 2004, and 454,000 (2.8% of the total population) in
Australia in 2007 (Lamb 2006; Penman 2008).
Yoga practice often incurs a financial cost, including the expense
of attending classes and purchasing props, clothing, books, mag-
azines, DVDs, and yoga mats. It has been reported that practi-
tioners spend nearly USD 6 billion on yoga classes and products
each year in the USA (Harris Interactive Service Bureau 2008). An
Australian national survey showed that AUD 98.65 were spent on
yoga practice per participant per month on average, amounting to
a total of AUD 537.4 million per year for all yoga participants in
Australia (Penman 2008). According to a “conservative estimate”
made in a 2002 Yoga Journal article, a yoga practitioner spends
USD 1500 on yoga practice yearly (Lamb 2006).
How the intervention might work
As a holistic therapy, yoga contains no asthma-specific posture
or breathing exercises (Goyeche 1982). The exact mechanism by
which yoga may affect asthma symptoms is not fully understood
(Vempati 2009). However, several explanations have been pro-
posed.
The first explanation is related to the breathing pattern in yoga
practice. One trigger of asthma attacks is frictional stress in air-
ways, which could damage the airway wall, affect the dynamics
of airway smooth muscle, and result in mast cell degranulation
(Singh 1990; Solway 1997; Chowdhary 1999). Some studies have
shown that the tidal volume and breathing rate decrease during
yoga practice (Kesterson 1989; Sudsuang 1991), which may inter-
fere with the process that triggers asthma attacks. Empirically, ran-
domised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in people with asthma
have demonstrated that specific breathing exercises or techniques
could help reduce acute exacerbations and rescue bronchodilator
use as compared with no intervention, and could significantly im-
prove quality of life as compared with asthma education (Fluge
6

 1994; Bowler 1998; Opat 2000; Thomas 2003). However, in a
Cochrane review comparing breathing exercises with usual care or
asthma education control, data were insufficient to be able to draw
conclusions to this effect (Holloway 2004). Consequently, yoga
practice involving breathing techniques may have some impact on
asthma symptoms. Breathing exercises in yoga practice could help
release suppressed emotion, reduce anxiety and self consciousness,
and relax muscle tension (Goyeche 1982).
Secondly, certain yoga postures may help expand the chest and
increase breath-holding time as well as vital capacity (Goyeche
1982). This could logically have some effect on the lung function
of people with asthma.
Thirdly, by practicing yoga people with asthma may achieve a
sense of relaxation and a positive mood, thus reducing the auto-
nomic arousal factors (Goyeche 1982; Manocha 2002; Vempati
2009). Meditation, a common component of yoga, may even help
practitioners reach a state of complete mental silence (’Sahaja’ in
Sanskrit), which yoga advocates consider to be an innately thera-
peutic process beneficial to people with chronic diseases, includ-
ing asthma. Meditation may also help the control and feedback of
respiratory muscles which would be adversely affected by asthma
attacks (Nayak 2004).
Why it is important to do this review
Previous literature indicates that yoga might have been used for
obstructive pulmonary disease (Donesky-Curenco 2009), pul-
monary tuberculosis (Visweswaraiah 2004), hypertension (Patel
1975; Sundar 1984; van Montfrans 1990), myocardial infarction
(Bulavin 1993), chronic back pain (Groessl 2008; Tekur 2008),
osteoarthritis (Bukowski 2007), and other medical disorders (Jain
1993; Ramaratnam 2000; Culos-Reed 2006; DiStasio 2008). If its
effects were confirmed, yoga could represent an additional option
for people with asthma to relieve both physical and psychological
suffering, especially in areas where access to traditional drug treat-
ments is limited. However, as the National Center for Comple-
mentary and Alternative Medicine has stated, “there is not enough
evidence to support the use of any complementary health prac-
tices for the relief of asthma” (NCCAM 2012). A number of clin-
ical trials have been carried out to evaluate the efficacy of yoga
for asthma. Some of them suggest that yoga may enhance pul-
monary function and reduce airway hyper-responsiveness, emo-
tional stress, and asthma attacks (Nagarathna 1985; Sodhi 2009;
Vempati 2009), while others showed that yoga conferred rather
limited or even no benefit (Manocha 2002; Sabina 2005). Such
information may confuse people with asthma when they are de-
ciding whether or not to devote time and resources to the practice
of yoga. We conducted the present review to better understand
the current evidence and to investigate potential sources of het-
erogeneity between studies on yoga for asthma.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
RCTs.
Types of participants
People with asthma of any duration and severity, irrespective of
age, gender, ethnicity, or language spoken.
Types of interventions
We included the following comparisons:
1. Yoga versus usual care (or no intervention)
2. Yoga versus sham intervention
The interventions should last for at least two weeks, as a RCT
showed that two weeks was sufficient for yoga-based interventions
to take effect in the management of bronchial asthma (Vempati
2009).
Types of outcome measures
The outcomes of interest in this review are listed below. Our pilot
search suggested that relevant trials normally investigated a selec-
tion, rather than all, of these outcomes. Whether a study reported
all of these outcomes or not was not a determinant of its inclusion
or exclusion.
Primary outcomes
1. Self reported quality of life measured by validated
questionnaires (e.g. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire
(AQLQ))
2. Self reported symptom scores (e.g. asthma symptom scale)
Secondary outcomes
1. Asthma control (e.g. asthma control test)
2. Lung function, such as forced expiratory volume in one
second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced vital
capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75%
of vital capacity (FEF 25-75%), etc.
3. Asthma medication usage (e.g. frequency of inhaler use)
4. Adverse events
7
Yoga for asthma (Review)

 We chose quality of life and symptoms as the primary outcomes
because they are patient-important outcomes (Ozgen Alpaydin
2011). The physiological measures of lung function and medi-
cation usage may indirectly reflect the potential benefit of yoga,
while adverse events indicate the related risk. We only considered
studies with at least one month of follow-up and included the
outcomes measured at the end of the study for analysis.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Regis-
ter of Trials (CAGR), which is derived from systematic searches
of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Reg-
ister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE,
CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO, and handsearching of respi-
ratory journals and meeting abstracts (please see Appendix 1 for
further details). We searched all records in the CAGR using the
strategy in Appendix 2 on 22 July 2015.
We performed an additional search of the Alternative Medicine
Electronic Database (AMED) using the strategy in Appendix
3. We searched PEDro (www.pedro.org.au) as well with the
terms ’yoga’ and ’asthma’, limited to clinical trials. We searched
ClinicalTrials.gov using the terms related to yoga detailed in the
Appendices above as ’Search Terms’, and ’asthma’ as ’Conditions’
under the ’Advanced Search’ tab. We searched the WHO ICTRP
search portal (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx) using
these search terms in the ’Title’, and ’asthma’ as ’Conditions’ un-
der the ’Advanced Search’ tab.
We searched all databases from their inception to 22 July 2015,
and placed no restriction on language of publication.
Searching other resources
We checked the reference lists of eligible studies and relevant re-
view articles for additional studies. We attempted to contact in-
vestigators of eligible studies and experts in the field to learn of
other published and unpublished studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (ZHB, MC) independently screened the ti-
tles and abstracts of the records identified through the literature
search. We retrieved the full texts of potentially eligible studies.
We considered studies meeting all the criteria listed above for in-
clusion. We excluded duplicates, and collated multiple reports of
the same study so that each study, rather than each report, was
the unit of interest in the review. Any disagreements between the
two review authors were resolved by discussion or by consulting a
third review author (TJL).
Data extraction and management
We used a predesigned and pilot-tested data collection form to
extract relevant data from eligible studies, including bibliographic
information (for example title, authors, publication year), char-
acteristics of participants (for example age, ethnicity, severity of
asthma), characteristicsof interventions(forexample components,
duration, frequency), characteristics of methodology (for example
randomisation, blinding, follow-up, methods for data analysis),
and results on the outcomes of interest. This process was also per-
formed independently by two review authors, with any inconsis-
tencies resolved by discussion.
For continuous outcomes, the within-group change from base-
line was equal to post-intervention mean minus pre-intervention
mean. Standard deviation of within-group change was calculated
according to the mean change and corresponding P value using the
RevMan 2014 calculator or according to the formulas in Section
16.1.3.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of In-
terventions (Higgins 2011), assuming a within-group correlation
coefficient of 0.5. With these data and number of participants,
mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD), and
their standard errors and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) could be
calculated using the RevMan calculator. For studies reporting MD
and its 95% CI or standard error, standard deviation of MD was
equal to sqrt(N)*(upper limit - lower limit)/(3.92) or (standard
error)*sqrt(N), where N was total sample size, and then SMD
and its standard error were calculated based on these data and the
number of participants in each group using the RevMan calcu-
lator. To ensure that the meaning of SMD was consistent across
different studies (for example SMD > 0 means that yoga was bet-
ter, while SMD < 0 means that control was better), MD might
be transformed to the same number with an opposite sign (for
example from 0.35 to -0.35) when entered into RevMan software
for meta-analysis or used for calculating SMD. All extracted data
and associated transformations are shown in Appendix 4.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (HYF, WXY) independently assessed the risk
of bias for each included study using the criteria outlined in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011), which involve the following seven domains:
1. Random sequence generation
2. Allocation concealment
3. Blinding of participants and personnel
4. Blinding of outcome assessment
5. Incomplete outcome data
6. Selective reporting
7. Other bias
8

 We classifiedthe riskof biasineach domainashigh, low, orunclear.
Any disagreements between the two review authors were resolved
by discussion or by consulting a third review author (TJL).
Measures of treatment effect
For continuous outcomes such as FEV1 and AQLQ, we used MD
with 95% CI to denote the treatment effects, if the outcomes
were measured by the same scale across studies. Alternatively, if the
outcomes were measured by different scales across studies, we used
SMD with 95% CI. For dichotomous outcomes, such as number
of participants able to reduce their asthma medication, we used
risk ratio with 95% CI to measure the treatment effects.
Unit of analysis issues
The majority of eligible studies we identified were individu-
ally randomised, parallel-group trials, without multiple interven-
tion groups. Hence, unit-of-analysis issues related to cluster-ran-
domised trials and multiple intervention groups did not arise in
this review. There was a cross-over trial (Singh 1990), for which
we calculated SMD using the calculator in RevMan 2014, based
on the standard deviations of the baseline and final scores, rather
than the change (as it is correlated).
Dealing with missing data
We attempted to contact investigators of eligible studies and ex-
perts in the field to identify potential missing studies. However,
we identified no additional studies eligible for this review. We had
planned to use a funnel plot to assess potential publication bias re-
sulting from missing studies, but we did not do this because none
of the meta-analyses we conducted included more than 10 stud-
ies (Higgins 2011). We contacted authors of the original studies
as needed to clarify methodological ambiguity or to obtain addi-
tional results not available from the published data, or both. For
some studies in which the summary data were missing, such as
the difference in outcome between treatment groups, we tried to
estimate it based on reported data.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed heterogeneity across the studies included in the meta-
analysis by Cochran’s Q test and the I² statistic. A P value ≤ 0.10
or an I² statistic ≥ 50% was considered as indicative of substantial
heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
For studies with potential reporting bias (see Selective reporting
(reporting bias)), we attempted to contact the original investiga-
tors to request any missing data. If we were unable to obtain miss-
ing data and we judged the selective reporting bias as high, we
examined the impact of such studies together with other studies
at high risk of bias on the overall results of the meta-analyses by
excluding them in the sensitivity analysis.
Data synthesis
We performed meta-analysis with RevMan 5.3 for each outcome,
provided that the outcome measures were similar enough and the
data reported were sufficient for meta-analysis (RevMan 2014).
We used the fixed-effect model to pool the data, unless there was
substantial heterogeneity among studies, in which case we used
the random-effects model instead. For outcomes inappropriate
or impossible to pool quantitatively, we conducted a descriptive
analysis and summarised the findings narratively.
We created a ’Summary of findings’ table according to the methods
described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of theCochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), and by using
GRADEpro software (http://gradepro.org/). We had planned to
include the following outcomes in the ’Summary of findings’ table:
self reported quality of life, self reported symptom scores, lung
function, asthma medication usage, and adverse events. As lung
function can be measured in a number of ways, we decided to
include FEV1 (L) change from baseline only in the ’Summary of
findings’ table. We chose this outcome because we were able to
combine the result using natural units (L) aiding interpretation,
and because change from baseline scores have a smaller variance.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
In case of substantial between-study heterogeneity, we conducted
prespecified subgroup analyses according to the following factors
to explore the potential source of heterogeneity:
1. Age: adults versus children
2. Gender: male versus female
3. Ethnicity: Asian versus white versus African
4. Severity of asthma: mild versus moderate-to-severe, as
defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma (Yawn 2008; Global
Initiative for Asthma 2011)
5. Yoga subtype: yoga that includes breathing exercises versus
other types
6. Duration of intervention: ≤ 1 month versus 1 to 2 months
versus > 2 months
We restricted subgroup analyses to the primary outcomes to avoid
false-positive results.
Sensitivity analysis
Forthe primaryoutcomes,we conductedsensitivityanalyseswhere
possible to assess the robustness of results by excluding studies at
high risk of bias. We rated a study as having a high risk of bias when
there was high risk of bias in any of the domains of The Cochrane
Collaboration’s ’Risk of bias’ tool. If there was unclear risk of bias
in some domains and low risk of bias in the remaining domains,
we rated the study as having an unclear risk of bias. Having said
9

 that, it should be noted that all thresholds for high or low risk of
bias are arbitrary, and studies may lie anywhere on the spectrum
from ’free of bias’ to ’undoubtedly biased’ (Higgins 2011).

Description of studies
Results of the search
We have summarised the results of the literature search and
flow of study selection in Figure 1. We initially retrieved 190
records from electronic databases and clinical trials registries. Af-
ter de-duplication and reviewing the titles and abstracts, we fur-
ther evaluated 29 records, finally including 15 studies in this
review (Nagarathna 1985; Singh 1990; Fluge 1994; Vedanthan
1998; Cooper 2003; Sabina 2005; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009;
Mekonnen 2010; Bidwell 2012; Lathadevi 2012; Satpathy 2012;
Singh 2012; Kant 2013; Prem 2013). Except for one study (Kant
2013), which was available as an abstract only, we included all
eligible studies in a qualitative synthesis. We twice tried to contact
the investigators for more detailed data, but received no reply. We
manually checked the reference lists of these reports and 10 tra-
ditional narrative or systematic reviews related to the topic of this
review (Galantino 2008; Burgess 2011; Posadzki 2011; Boehm
2012; O’Connor 2012; Barker 2013; Eichenberger 2013; McCall
2013; Cramer 2014; Lorenc 2014), but identified no additional
eligible studies.

 Included studies
See: Characteristics of included studies.
All studies were individually randomised, parallel-group trials, ex-
cept for one cross-over trial (Singh 1990). Eight studies were from
India (Nagarathna 1985; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009; Lathadevi
2012; Satpathy 2012; Singh 2012; Kant 2013; Prem 2013), three
from the USA (Vedanthan 1998; Sabina 2005; Bidwell 2012),
two from the UK (Singh 1990; Cooper 2003), one from Ger-
many (Fluge 1994, published in German), and one from Ethiopia
(Mekonnen 2010). We included 15 studies involving a total of
1048 participants. The number of included participants varied
from 17 in the Vedanthan 1998 study to 276 in the Kant 2013
study.
Most studies were conducted in adults only. Two studies involved
some children and adolescents, but the numbers of these partic-
ipants were not reported, and there was no stratified analysis by
age group (Nagarathna 1985; Mekonnen 2010). Two studies in-
cluded male participants only (Lathadevi 2012; Satpathy 2012),
one study included female participants only (Bidwell 2012), and
the remaining studies included both sexes, with no preference.
In two studies, most or all of the participants were white (Singh
1990; Sabina 2005), in one study, all participants were African
(Mekonnen 2010), and the remaining studies did not report the
ethnic composition of participants.
Where reported, asthma was diagnosed on the basis of objective
pulmonary criteria (Nagarathna 1985; Singh 1990; Vedanthan
1998; Cooper 2003; Sabina 2005; Vempati 2009; Singh 2012;
Prem 2013). Eleven studies reported the severity of asthma,
which was mild in three studies (Singh 1990; Mekonnen 2010;
Lathadevi 2012), mild-to-moderate in seven studies (Vedanthan
1998; Sabina 2005; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009; Bidwell 2012;
Singh 2012; Kant 2013), and varied in one study (Fluge 1994).
The mean duration of asthma varied from six months, in Sabina
2005, to 23 years, in Cooper 2003.
Five studies included yoga breathing alone (Singh 1990; Cooper
2003; Sodhi 2009; Satpathy 2012; Prem 2013); the other stud-
ies assessed yoga interventions that included breathing, postures,
and meditation. In two studies including yoga breathing alone,
a medical device called ’Pink City Lung Exerciser’ was used to
mimic the typical patterns of yoga breathing (Singh 1990; Cooper
2003). The duration of yoga intervention varied from two weeks
to 54 months; it was no more than one month in five studies
(Singh 1990; Fluge 1994; Sabina 2005; Vempati 2009; Mekonnen
2010), one to two months in five studies (Sodhi 2009; Bidwell
2012; Lathadevi 2012; Satpathy 2012; Singh 2012), and more
than two months in the remaining five studies (Nagarathna 1985;
Vedanthan 1998; Cooper 2003; Kant 2013; Prem 2013). In most
studies, the outcomes were measured immediately after the com-
pletion of the intervention.
For the control groups, two studies used placebo (“placebo Pink
City Lung Exerciser”) (Singh 1990; Cooper 2003), one study used
sham yoga (stretching) (Sabina 2005), and six studies used usual
care (Nagarathna 1985; Fluge 1994; Bidwell 2012; Satpathy2012;
Kant 2013; Prem 2013). In one study (Lathadevi 2012), from
which “patients having other lung diseases, tuberculosis, smokers,
and acute exacerbation of asthmatic attack were excluded”, “all
the medications were fully stopped during the study”, which, ac-
cording to the reports, was applicable to the control group. In an-
other study (Vempati 2009), the control group was offered a single
session of health education relevant to their illness. We consider
such a session negligible as compared to the two-week intensive
yoga practiced by the intervention group. This study was thus still
included under the category of yoga versus usual care. Four studies
did not report the control group intervention (Vedanthan 1998;
Sodhi 2009; Mekonnen 2010; Singh 2012).
Lathadevi 2012 reported that “all the medications were fully
stopped during the study”, while another 12 studies explic-
itly allowed routine medication use (Nagarathna 1985; Singh
1990; Vedanthan 1998; Cooper 2003; Sabina 2005; Sodhi 2009;
Vempati 2009; Mekonnen 2010; Satpathy 2012; Singh 2012;
Kant 2013; Prem 2013). The remaining two studies reported that
the control groups received standard or usual care (Fluge 1994;
Bidwell 2012), which would presumably include routine medica-
tion use, but there was no mention of whether or not the yoga
groups received asthma medication during the study. None of the
included studies specified whether or not the participants were on
comprehensive medication programs or whether the spirometry
data were taken before or after use of asthma medication.
Excluded studies
See: Characteristics of excluded studies.
We excluded six studies that did not randomise, three for ineligible
interventions, two for ineligible controls, and one for ineligible
outcomes. Of the three studies excluded for ineligible interven-
tions, one used the Buteyko technique (Cowie 2008), one used
the Papworth method (Holloway 2007), and the remaining study
used yoga as part of a multimodal intervention only (Kligler 2011).
In the two studies excluded for ineligible controls, the control
groups used relaxation methods, group discussion, and cognitive
behaviour therapy, in Manocha 2002, or practiced meditation, in
Saxena 2009, making the net comparison of intervention versus
control not yoga alone. One study assessed the effects of yoga on
biochemical profiles (Agnihotri 2014), which was not relevant to
this review. The results on relevant outcomes from that study were
reported by Kant 2013, which has already been included.

 Risk of bias in included studies
Our judgements of risk of bias on the included studies and support
for these judgements are shown in the Characteristics of included
studies table. The assessment results are presented graphically in
Figure 2. Briefly, we judged one study to be at low risk of bias in all
domains (Cooper 2003), with the remainder as at either high or
unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. We judged the overall
risk of bias in the data for this review to be high, regardless of the
outcome. We have provided details below. We have described the
quality of evidence for different outcomes according to the Grad-
ing of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-
tion (GRADE) Working Group (Guyatt 2008), which incorpo-
rates risk of bias and several other factors into one single grade;
more detail on this is found under Quality of the evidence and is
summarised in the Summary of findings for the main comparison.

 Allocation
Two studies explicitly reported that the random sequence used
was generated by a computer (Cooper 2003; Sabina 2005), and
were thus judged to be at low risk of bias for this domain. We
judged one study using flawed randomisation to be at high risk
of selection bias (Nagarathna 1985). None of the other studies
provided details on random sequence generation, and were thus
judged to be at unclear risk of bias for this domain. Random
numbers for allocation were contained in sealed envelopes in three
studies(Cooper 2003; Sabina 2005; Prem2013). Forthese studies,
we judged the risk of bias arising from allocation concealment
issue to be low. The other studies did not mention allocation
concealment, and were thus judged to be at unclear risk of bias
for this domain.
Blinding
Two placebo- or sham intervention-controlled studies were de-
scribed as “double-blind” (Singh 1990; Sabina 2005), and in an-
other placebo-controlled study, participants and outcome asses-
sors were blinded (Cooper 2003). We judged these studies to be
at low risk of detection and performance bias. Two open-label
studies only assessed lung function measures and were therefore
considered to be at high risk of performance bias (Lathadevi 2012;
Satpathy 2012), as participants’ awareness of group assignment
may have subconsciously affected their performance on these tests,
but were judged to be at low risk for detection bias. The remaining
studies were open-label and did not describe measures to blind
outcomes assessors and were therefore considered to be at high
risk of both performance and detection bias.
We acknowledge that some subjective outcome measures, such
as quality of life, are more prone to performance bias than other
more objective measures, such as adverse events and lung function.
In addition, we recognise that in the case of participant-reported
outcomes, such as asthma control or medication usage, the par-
ticipant is the outcome assessor and therefore these outcomes are
at high risk of detection bias in studies in which the participants
were aware of group assignment, even if the trial outcome assessor
was not. We have taken these considerations into account when
assessing our confidence in the evidence presented.
Incomplete outcome data
We judged the studies with no dropouts (Vedanthan 1998;
Mekonnen 2010; Lathadevi 2012), those with low drop-out rates
(Nagarathna 1985; Singh 1990; Vempati 2009; Singh 2012; Prem
2013), and those with high drop-out rates and similar reasons for
dropouts between the two groups (Cooper 2003), to be at a low
risk of attrition bias. One study reported a low drop-out rate (3
of 12 in the control group, 3 of 24 in total) (Fluge 1994), but the
dropouts were all related to asthma, and so this study was thus
judged to be at a high risk of attrition bias. We also assessed Sabina
2005 to be at high risk of bias as drop-out was unbalanced, with
more participants withdrawing from the the control arm. The re-
maining studies provided no information on dropouts and were
thus judged to be at an unclear risk of attrition bias (Sodhi 2009;
Bidwell 2012; Kant 2013).
Selective reporting
We judged three studies to be at a high risk of reporting bias for not
providing details on outcomes that were said to be investigated in
the protocol (Sabina 2005; Bidwell 2012; Prem 2013); the other
studies did not have this problem.
Other potential sources of bias
Frequent ’errors’ or inconsistencies within a paper, which could
also be due to bias from the other domains of The Cochrane
Collaboration’s ’Risk of bias’ tool, could lead to concerns about
study quality. We judged three studies to be at a high risk of other
bias based on an assessment of the overall quality of the papers
(Sabina 2005; Mekonnen 2010; Singh 2012).

Primary outcomes
1. Quality of life
Eight studies of 736 participants assessed the impact of yoga
on quality of life (Cooper 2003; Sabina 2005; Sodhi 2009;
Vempati 2009; Bidwell 2012; Singh 2012; Kant 2013; Prem
2013). One study used St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire
(Bidwell 2012); six studies used the Asthma Quality of Life Ques-
tionnaire (AQLQ)(Cooper 2003; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009;
Singh 2012; Kant 2013; Prem 2013); and one study used the
Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire(Sabina 2005). We
included five studies using the AQLQ for meta-analysis (Sabina
2005; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009; Singh 2012; Prem2013). There
was no substantial statistical heterogeneity among studies (I2 =
37%, P = 0.17). The fixed-effect summary mean difference (MD)
was 0.57 units on a 7-point scale (95% confidence interval (CI)
0.37 to 0.77; 5 studies; 375 participants; Figure 3), indicating that

 yoga improved the quality of life of people with asthma. Among
the studies not suitable for meta-analysis, Kant 2013 (n = 276)
reported that there was a significant improvement in AQLQ scores
in the yoga group compared with the control group (P < 0.001),
but provided no details; Bidwell 2012 (n = 19) reported no dif-
ferences in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire scores between
groups at baseline, but found that the yoga group demonstrated
a decreased score (-13.49, equal to 45% improvement) compared
to the control group (4.85) (difference: P < 0.05); and Cooper
2003 (n = 59) reported that the median change in AQLQ from
baseline was 0.57 (interquartile range: 0.07 to 1.10) in the yoga
group and 0.61 (interquartile range: -0.11 to 0.95) in the control
group, with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.2).

2. Symptoms
Seven studies assessed the impact of yoga on asthma symptoms
(Nagarathna 1985; Singh 1990; Vedanthan 1998; Cooper 2003;
Sabina 2005; Sodhi2009; Kant2013). Fourstudiesusedsymptom
score (Singh 1990; Cooper 2003; Sabina 2005; Kant 2013), while
the other studies used different severity scores. We included three
studies for meta-analysis (Nagarathna 1985; Vedanthan 1998;
Sodhi 2009). There was no substantial statistical heterogeneity
among studies (I2 = 0%, P = 0.54). The fixed-effect summary
standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.37 (95% CI 0.09 to
0.65; 3 studies; 243 participants; Figure 4), indicating that yoga
improved symptoms of people with asthma. Among the studies
not suitable for meta-analysis, Kant 2013 (n = 276) and Sabina
2005 (n = 62) reported that there was a significant improvement
in asthma symptoms in the yoga group compared to the control
group, but provided no details; Cooper 2003 (n = 59) reported
that the median change in symptom score from baseline was -
1 (interquartile range: -2 to 0.75) in the yoga group and 0 (in-
terquartile range: -1 to 1) in the control group, with a significant
difference between groups in favour of yoga (P = 0.003). Singh
1990 (n = 22) reported that the difference in change from baseline
of the geometric mean of symptom score (doubling increments)
was -0.06 (95% CI -0.45 to 0.32), indicating no significant dif-
ference between groups.

Secondary outcomes
1. Asthma control
Four studies assessed the impact of yoga on asthma control
(Nagarathna 1985; Sodhi 2009; Mekonnen 2010; Prem 2013).
One study used the Asthma Control Questionnaire (Prem 2013),
while the other three studies used number of attacks of asthma as
the outcome measure (Nagarathna 1985; Sodhi 2009; Mekonnen
2010). As the results of the only two studies that were potentially
suitable for meta-analysis were highly heterogeneous (I2 = 98%)
(Nagarathna 1985; Sodhi 2009), we did not combine the studies.
The MD in change of number of attacks of asthma from baseline
between groups was 1.92 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.32) in Nagarathna
1985 (n = 106) and 0.20 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.33) in Sodhi 2009 (n
= 120), respectively, both indicating that yoga improved asthma
control in people with asthma. Mekonnen 2010 (n = 24) reported
that both day and night attacks of asthma were significantly re-
duced by yoga, while no such effects were observed in the con-
trol group (P < 0.001 for both), but provided no details. Prem
2013 (n = 80) reported that the mean change in Asthma Control
Questionnaire from baseline was not significant in either the yoga
group (0.13, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.41; P = 0.356) or the control
group (0.11, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.37; P = 0.383).
2. Lung function
(1) Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
Twelve studies assessed the impact of yoga on FEV1 (Singh 1990;
Fluge 1994; Vedanthan 1998; Cooper 2003; Sabina 2005; Sodhi
2009; Vempati 2009; Bidwell 2012; Lathadevi 2012; Satpathy
2012; Singh 2012; Prem 2013). Three studies measured the
changes in percentage of predicted value (Fluge 1994; Sodhi 2009;
Vempati 2009), while the other studies directly measured the
changes in volume (in L). We included 10 of the studies for meta-
analysis (Singh 1990; Fluge 1994; Vedanthan 1998; Cooper 2003;
Sodhi2009; Vempati2009; Lathadevi 2012; Satpathy2012; Singh
2012; Prem 2013). There was substantial statistical heterogeneity
among studies (I2 = 80%, P < 0.00001).
The random-effects summary was SMD 0.31 (95% CI -0.08 to
0.70; 10 studies; 561 participants; Figure 5), indicating that ev-
idence that yoga improved FEV1 in people with asthma was in-
sufficient. The two studies not suitable for meta-analysis, Sabina
2005 (n = 62) and Bidwell 2012 (n = 19), also reported no sig-
nificant differences between treatment groups, but provided no
details.

Seven of the studies reported change from baseline in FEV1 in
litres, and these have been combined to show the MD in natural
units. When analysed in this way, the MD was 0.04 litres (95%
CI -0.10 to 0.19; 7 studies; 340 participants; Figure 6).

(2) Forced vital capacity (FVC)
Eight studies assessed the impact of yoga on FVC (Vedanthan
1998; Sabina 2005; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009; Bidwell 2012;
Lathadevi 2012; Satpathy 2012; Singh 2012). Two studies mea-
sured the changes in percentage of predicted value (Sodhi 2009;
Vempati 2009), while the other studies directly measured the
changes in volume (in L). We included six of the studies for meta-
analysis (Vedanthan 1998; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009; Lathadevi
2012; Satpathy 2012; Singh 2012). There was substantial statis-
tical heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 77%, P = 0.0005). The
random-effects summary SMD was 0.67 (95% CI 0.20 to 1.14;
6 studies; 376 participants; P = 0.005; Analysis 1.5), indicating
18

 that yoga improved FVC of people with asthma. However, the
other two studies (Sabina 2005; Bidwell 2012), with a total sample
size of 81, reported no significant differences between treatment
groups, but provided no details.
(3) FEV1/FVC
Seven studies assessed the impact of yoga on FEV1/FVC (Sabina
2005; Sodhi2009; Vempati2009; Lathadevi 2012; Satpathy2012;
Singh 2012; Prem 2013). The unit of FEV1/FVC was percent-
age (% predicted). We included six of the studies for meta-analy-
sis (Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009; Lathadevi 2012; Satpathy 2012;
Singh 2012; Prem 2013). There was substantial statistical hetero-
geneity among studies (I2 = 77%, P = 0.0005). The random-ef-
fects summary MD was 0.62 (95% CI -1.63 to 2.87; 6 studies;
435 participants; P = 0.59; Analysis 1.6), indicating that evidence
that yoga improved FEV1/FVC of people with asthma was insuf-
ficient. The remaining study (Sabina 2005), with a sample size
of 62, also reported no significant differences between treatment
groups, but provided no details.
(4) Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)
Ten studies assessed the impact of yoga on PEFR (Nagarathna
1985; Singh 1990; Vedanthan 1998; Sabina 2005; Sodhi 2009;
Vempati 2009; Mekonnen 2010; Bidwell 2012; Lathadevi 2012;
Singh 2012). The units of measurement varied widely across stud-
ies: L/minute in three studies (Nagarathna 1985; Singh 1990;
Vedanthan 1998), L/second in one study (Singh 2012), L in one
study (Lathadevi 2012), percentage in two studies (Sodhi 2009;
Vempati 2009), and unclear in the remaining three studies. We
included seven of the 10 studies for meta-analysis (Nagarathna
1985; Singh 1990; Vedanthan 1998; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009;
Lathadevi 2012; Singh 2012). There was substantial statistical het-
erogeneity among studies (I2 = 68%, P = 0.004). The random-
effects summary SMD was 0.73 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.09; 7 stud-
ies; 433 participants; P < 0.0001; Analysis 1.7), indicating that
yoga improved PEFR of people with asthma. Three studies re-
ported both morning and evening values of PEFR (Singh 1990;
Vedanthan 1998; Singh 2012). In this review, for consistency we
used the morning values for meta-analysis. When the evening val-
ues were used instead, the summary SMD did not change signifi-
cantly (data not shown). Of the three studies not suitable for meta-
analysis, Mekonnen 2010 (n = 24) reported a significant improve-
ment of PEFR after the yoga intervention as compared to control;
Bidwell 2012 (n = 19) reported no significant differences between
treatment groups; and Sabina 2005 (n = 62) claimed to have inves-
tigated PEFR, but did not mention this outcome in their results.
(5) Forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital
capacity (FEF 25-75%)
Four studies assessed the impact of yoga on FEF 25-75%
(Vedanthan 1998; Sabina 2005; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009). Two
studies measured the change in percentage of predicted value
(Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009), one measured the changes in volume
in L (Sabina 2005), and the remaining study measured the changes
over time (L/second) (Vedanthan 1998). We included three of the
studies for meta-analysis (Vedanthan 1998; Sodhi 2009; Vempati
2009). There was substantial statistical heterogeneity among stud-
ies (I2 = 79%, P = 0.008). The random-effects summary SMD
was 0.45 (95% CI -0.28 to 1.19; 3 studies; 197 participants; P =
0.23; Analysis 1.8), indicating that evidence that yoga improved
FEF 25-75% of people with asthma was insufficient. The study
not suitable for meta-analysis, Sabina 2005 (n = 62), also reported
no significant differences between treatment groups, but provided
no details.
3. Asthma medication usage
Nine studies assessed the impact of yoga on asthma medication
usage (Nagarathna 1985; Singh 1990; Vedanthan 1998; Cooper
2003; Sabina 2005; Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009; Mekonnen 2010;
Kant 2013). The drugs used varied across studies; examples in-
clude beta2 agonist inhalers, inhaled steroids, and theophylline.
The outcome measures varied across studies as well, including
change in dose, days requiring rescue medication use, times per
day, drug treatment score, number of participants with decrease in
dosage of asthma medication, etc. Meta-analysis of three studies
measuring frequency of medication usage yielded a SMD of 0.69
(95% CI 0.41 to 0.96; 3 studies; 228 participants; P < 0.00001;
Analysis 1.9) (Nagarathna 1985; Sabina 2005; Vempati 2009),
with no substantial statistical heterogeneity among studies (I2 =
26%, P = 0.26). Meta-analysis of two studies measuring the per-
centage of participants with decreasing dosage of asthma medica-
tion yielded a risk ratio of 5.35 (95% CI 1.29 to 22.11; 2 stud-
ies; 48 participants; P = 0.02; Analysis 1.10), with no statistical
heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 0%, P = 0.64). The summary
SMD and risk ratio indicated that yoga decreased the use of med-
ication in people with asthma. Among the three studies not suit-
able for meta-analysis, Kant 2013 (n = 276) reported that “the
rescue medication use has a significant decrease in comparison to
control group”, but provided no details. Singh 1990 (n = 22) re-
ported that the difference in change from baseline of the geometric
mean of inhaler use (doubling increments) was -0.10 (95% CI -
0.37 to 0.17), indicating no significant difference between groups.
Cooper 2003 (n = 59) reported that the median change in beta2
agonist use (puffs per day) was 0 (interquartile range: -2 to 0) in
both yoga and control groups, with no significant difference.
4. Adverse events
Four studies of 188 participants reported investigating adverse
events during their trials (Singh 1990; Fluge 1994; Sabina 2005;
19
Yoga for asthma (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Prem 2013). In Fluge 1994, three participants from the control
group required oral steroids treatment due to acute exacerbations
of their asthma, as compared with none in the yoga group, but the
investigators argued that this could not be counted as an adverse
effect of yoga. Sabina 2005 reported no adverse events associated
with yogaorthe control. InSingh 1990, one participantinthe yoga
group using the Pink City Lung Exerciser reported mild dyspnoea
during the exercise. Prem 2013 claimed to have recorded adverse
events in the protocol, but did not mention this outcome in their
results.
Subgroup analysis
We had planned to conduct subgroup analyses for quality of life
and asthma symptoms according to age (adults versus children),
gender (male versus female), ethnicity, severity of asthma, subtype
of yoga, and duration of intervention. For age, only two studies
involved children (Nagarathna 1985; Mekonnen 2010), and nei-
ther of them stratified analyses by age group. We were thus unable
to conduct subgroup analysis according to this factor.
For gender, two studies included male participants only (Lathadevi
2012; Satpathy 2012), and one included female participants only
(Bidwell 2012), while the other studies included participants of
both genders and did not stratify analyses by gender. Lathadevi
2012 (n = 48) found that yoga could significantly improve FEV1,
FVC, and PEFR as compared with control, Satpathy 2012 (n =
71) found that yoga could significantly improve FEV1, FVC, and
FEV1/FVC ratio as compared with control, while Bidwell 2012 (n
= 19) found no significant differences between treatment groups.
However, based on these three small studies, especially considering
the small sample size of females in Bidwell 2012, it was difficult
to make a valid comparison of the effects of yoga in males with
those in females.
For ethnicity, only three studies clearly reported the ethnic com-
position of their participants, and it was difficult to make a valid
comparison of the effects of yoga in different ethnic groups. How-
ever, as most studies were from either India or Western countries,
we argue that subgroup analyses according to geographical areas
of studies may to some extent reflect the difference in effects of
yoga, if any, in different ethnic populations. Based on the three In-
dian studies with relevant data (Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009; Prem
2013), the MD in change of quality of life from baseline between
yoga and control groups was 0.47 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.59), and the
corresponding result based on two Western studies was 0.83 (95%
CI 0.39 to 1.28) (P for subgroup difference: 0.12). For asthma
symptoms, the SMD based on the two Indian studies was 0.38
(95% CI 0.09 to 0.67) (Nagarathna 1985; Sodhi 2009), and the
corresponding result from the Western study was 0.28 (95% CI -
0.68 to 1.24) (P for subgroup difference: 0.85) (Vedanthan 1998).
All studies that specified severity of asthma included mild or mild-
to-moderate asthma, and none of them conducted subgroup anal-
ysis according to asthma severity. It was thus impossible for us to
conduct subgroup analysis according to severity of asthma.
For subtype of yoga, we conducted separate analyses for stud-
ies that included yoga breathing alone and those that included
yoga breathing, posture, and meditation together. We did not find
strong evidence that a yoga intervention consisting of breathing,
posture, and meditation led to greater improvements in quality of
life (MD 0.85 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22) as compared
with yoga breathing alone (MD 0.46 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.23
to 0.69). The difference was not statistically significant and should
be interpreted cautiously, as there were numerous differences be-
tween the studies (P for subgroup difference: 0.09; Figure 3).
For the duration of the intervention, the results of subgroup analy-
ses showed little difference in the quality of life improvement with
the yoga intervention at less than one month (MD 0.60 7-point
scale, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.11) (Sabina 2005; Vempati 2009), at one
to two months (MD 0.58 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.82)
(Sodhi 2009; Singh 2012), and at more than two months (MD
0.50 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98) (Prem 2013). Similarly,
we observed no subgroup difference for asthma symptoms.
Sensitivity analysis
We had planned to conduct sensitivity analyses to examine
whether risk of bias would affect the results of our meta-analy-
ses. However, as the only study with a low risk of bias was not
included in the meta-analysis for quality of life or asthma symp-
toms (Cooper 2003), we did not conduct the pre-planned sen-
sitivity analyses. As suggested by the peer referees, we also com-
pared the results of studies in which the control group received
placebo or sham intervention (Singh 1990; Cooper 2003; Sabina
2005), with those of studies in which participants in the control
group received usual care only. Cooper 2003 and Sabina 2005
investigated asthma quality of life. The results of both studies
were statistically insignificant, unlike the other six studies con-
tributing to this outcome, which did not have a sham or placebo
control (Sodhi 2009; Vempati 2009; Bidwell 2012; Singh 2012;
Kant 2013; Prem 2013). The three placebo/sham intervention-
controlled studies all investigated asthma symptoms. The results
of Singh 1990 (n = 22) were statistically insignificant, but Cooper
2003 (n = 59) and Sabina 2005 (n = 62), which had larger sample
sizes, both yielded similar results to the other four studies on this
outcome (Nagarathna 1985; Vedanthan 1998; Sodhi 2009; Kant
2013).

Summary of main results
This review included 15 RCTs with a total of 1048 participants to
evaluate the effects of yoga in people with asthma. There was some
evidence that yoga may improve quality of life (MD in Asthma

 Quality of Life Questionnaire score per item 0.57 units on a 7-
point scale, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.77; 5 studies; 375 participants),
symptoms (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.65; 3 studies; 243 par-
ticipants), forced vital capacity (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.14;
6 studies) and peak expiratory flow rate (SMD 0.73, 95% CI 0.36
to 1.09; 7 studies), and reduce medication usage (SMD 0.69, 95%
CI 0.41 to 0.96; 3 studies) (risk ratio for decreasing dosage 5.35,
95% CI 1.29 to 22.11; 2 studies) in people with asthma. The
effects of yoga on forced expiratory volume in one second (SMD
0.31, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.70; 10 studies; 561 participants) were
not statistically significant. None of the studies reported serious
adverse events associated with yoga, but the data on this outcome
was very limited.
However, the following issues must be considered in interpreting
the above results. First, while the improvement in Asthma Quality
of Life Questionnaire score byyogaexceededthe minimal clinically
important difference (MCID) (0.5 unit per item) (Juniper 1994;
Jones 2002; Bateman 2015), the two trials that included a placebo
or sham intervention found no difference (Cooper 2003; Sabina
2005). For symptom score, the other primary outcome of this re-
view, the improvement by yoga was equivalent to 0.37 standard
deviation units of the severity scores used; however, whether or not
it was clinically important is uncertain, as no established MCID
for those severity scores is available. Second, most of the included
trials were at high risk of bias for one or more domains, especially
those related to blinding. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the
results of meta-analyses were not robust against bias. Third, we
observed substantial heterogeneity in all meta-analyses about lung
functions. Fourth, the data on adverse events of yoga was very
limited. The evidence presented here suggests that while yoga may
improve a number of outcomes for people with asthma, the prob-
lems described preclude us from drawing a firm conclusion. The
findings of this review are at best preliminary and suggestive and
should be interpreted cautiously.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The outcomes evaluated in this review were comprehensive. We
assessed both efficacy and safety, and included both participant-
reported and physiological measures. Several studies were avail-
able for meta-analysis for each outcome. However, one study that
investigated all the outcomes of our interest was available as ab-
stract only (Kant 2013), with no details available in spite of our
efforts to contact the investigators. Data on lung function mea-
sured by spirometry were not reported in detail in another two
studies (Sabina 2005; Bidwell 2012). In addition, data on adverse
events was not available from one study (Prem 2013). The evi-
dence summarised in this review is thus considered incomplete.
The studies included in this review were mostly from India, fol-
lowed by Western countries. The ethnic populations represented
by them are presumably different. However, subgroup analyses ac-
cording to country of study failed to show any significant differ-
ence in the effects of yoga between India and Western countries.
There is thus currently no evidence to suggest that the results of
this review are only applicable to particular ethnic populations. As
most studies included both males and females without preference,
and evidence to suggest that the effects of yoga vary with gender
was insufficient, we cannot conclude that the applicability of re-
sults of this review would be limited by gender.
As most studies were conducted in adults, whether the evidence
summarised here is generalisable to children or adolescents is open
to question. In addition, the majority of studies included people
with mild or mild-to-moderate asthma only; thus, whether the
evidence is applicable to people with severe asthma is also unclear.
Most of the included studies allowed the use of asthma medi-
cation. As meta-analyses showed that yoga may lead to reduced
medication use, the improvement (if any) in outcomes in the yoga
groups were less likely to be a result of asthma medication use,
but more likely to be caused by yoga or other factors (for example
bias). However, most studies provided no details of the medical
regimens used, which could vary across studies. In addition, only
one study explicitly reported that all drugs were fully stopped dur-
ing the study (Lathadevi 2012). It thus remains uncertain whether
the evidence summarised in this review is applicable to different
settings in terms of medical regimens.
Due to the different outcome measures used by different studies,
we had to use SMD in the meta-analyses. However, SMD itself is
difficult to interpret and conveys no information on the absolute
effects of practicing yoga. This may limit the applicability of evi-
dence to some extent. In addition, the effects of yoga were assessed
immediately after the intervention in most of the existing studies,
so we cannot comment on whether any of the potential benefits
identified were sustained.
Quality of the evidence
The studies included in this review were all RCTs. According to
the GRADE Working Group (Guyatt 2008), there are five fac-
tors that may decrease the quality of evidence from RCTs: study
limitations, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, im-
precision, and publication bias. In this review, study limitations
are mainly reflected by risk of bias, which we judged to be high
for all outcomes. This could lead to distorted results by reduc-
ing the comparability of participants between treatment groups
(selection bias), influencing the performance of participants and
clinicians (performance bias), etc. We thus downgraded the qual-
ity of evidence on every outcome due to risk of bias (see Summary
of findings for the main comparison). Inconsistency of results is
mainly reflected by between-study heterogeneity. In this review, we
observed substantial heterogeneity in the meta-analyses for asthma
control and lung functions, but not in the meta-analyses for other
outcomes. We thus downgraded the quality of evidence on asthma
control and lung functions for ’inconsistency’. As this review con-
21

 tains no indirect comparison of yoga with control, we did not con-
sider indirectness of evidence to be a major problem. Imprecision
of results is often seen in the scenario where the point estimate
indicates a likely beneficial or harmful effect while the confidence
interval is wide, usually crossing the null-effect line. This problem
is mainly caused by limited data available for an outcome, either
because few studies investigated the outcome or because the out-
come itself is rare. In this review, we downgraded the quality of
evidence on forced expiratory volume in one second, reduction
in asthma medication usage, and adverse events for ’imprecision’.
Publication bias is usually judged by visual inspection of funnel
plots. As the number of studies in all meta-analyses of this review
was no more than 10, we did not construct funnel plots (which
would have very limited statistical power in this case) to detect
publication bias. It is thus difficult to conclude whether publica-
tion bias existed or not. However, we judged there to be a high risk
of publication bias for adverse events, due to no mention of adverse
events in Prem 2013 (which were specified explicitly as one of the
outcomes of interest in their research protocol). In summary, we
have graded the quality of evidence on different outcomes in this
review as moderate to very low.
Potential biases in the review process
There are several sources of potential bias in the review process.
First, as mentioned above, data on lung function and adverse
events were not available from some studies. Such missing data
could be important to the overall results. Second, some studies did
not report the within-group pre-post changes (mean and standard
deviation) of outcomes, which we had to estimate based on the
reported data, such as baseline and postintervention values. Some
of the estimates might not be sufficiently accurate, and thus could
have influenced the summary estimates of meta-analyses to some
extent. Third, as mentioned above, due to the limited number of
studies available for each meta-analysis, we did not construct fun-
nel plots, and thus cannot exclude the possibility of publication
bias.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
To our knowledge, two systematic reviews on the effects of yoga
for asthma have been published (Posadzki 2011; Cramer 2014).
Posadzki 2011 included seven trials. Among them was Manocha
2002, which we excluded for irrelevant control group (see the
Characteristics of excluded studies). We included all the remain-
ing six trials identified by Posadzki 2011 in the present review.
However, Posadzki 2011 did not include two studies fulfilling its
inclusion criteria and published before its time of literature search
(October 2010) (Singh 1990; Cooper 2003). The other seven
studies included in this review but not in Posadzki 2011 were all
published later than its time of literature search.
Cramer 2014 included 14 trials. It included Manocha 2002 and
Saxena 2009, both of which we excluded for irrelevant control
groups (see the Characteristics of excluded studies). However,
Cramer 2014 missed three studies that met their inclusion criteria
(Lathadevi 2012; Satpathy 2012; Kant 2013).
There are three possible explanations for the difference in included
studies between this review and the previous two reviews. First, the
inclusion criteria are different. In this review, we considered only
studies with a net comparison of yoga versus placebo or no treat-
ment to be eligible, while the previous two reviews also included
trials comparing yoga with behavioural intervention or medita-
tion. Second, our time of literature search is more recent than that
of the previous two reviews, so that we were more likely to identify
a larger number of studies. Third, the previous two reviews could
have missed some eligible studies due to the limitations in their
search strategy or screening process, or both.
Posadzki 2011 did not conduct meta-analyses, without offering
any reasons, and just presented the results of different studies nar-
ratively. Considering that it included a much smaller number of
studies than the present review and that it was not based on quan-
titative synthesis of existing data, we think Posadzki 2011’s find-
ings about the effects of yoga for asthma are not directly compa-
rable to ours. Cramer 2014 found some evidence that yoga may
improve quality of life, asthma control, asthma symptoms, and
lung functions, which is similar to this review. However, Posadzki
2011, Cramer 2014, and the present review all recognised the low
quality of existing trials and emphasised the need for more rigor-
ous studies with larger sample sizes to confirm the effects of yoga
for asthma.

Implications for practice
This review involved evidence from 15 RCTs including a total of
1048 participants. Our findings are preliminary and suggestive,
rather than conclusive, and therefore should be interpreted cau-
tiously. Yoga probably improves quality of life and symptoms in
people with asthma to some extent. However, whether or not the
improvements in symptoms exceed the MCID is uncertain due
to the lack of an established MCID for the severity scores used
in the included studies. Data on adverse events of yoga was very
limited. In view of the moderate to very low evidence quality, both
the efficacy and safety profile of yoga require clarification by more
rigorously designed studies.
Implications for research
This review has several implications for future research. First, as
the included studies were mostly small in sample size and at a high
22

 risk of bias, high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes are needed
to confirm the effects of yoga. Large sample size is important for
the results to reach statistical significance, if any. Improvement
of trial quality refers not only to such issues as true random se-
quence generation, proper allocation concealment, and intention-
to-treat analysis, but also to systematic management and recording
of medical treatment, environmental control, trigger avoidance,
and education of those topics during study. Importantly, in order
to minimise the impact of performance and detection bias on in-
ternal validity, we suggest that future trials should include an active
control, such as a sham yoga intervention. The timing of outcome
measurement, especially spirometry data, should take the phase
of asthma and medication use into consideration. The reporting
quality of studies, for example the consistency and accuracy of
data, should also be improved on in the future. Second, given the
characteristics of participants included in the existing studies, the
effects of yoga in children with asthma and in people with severe
asthma, if ethically feasible, remain to be assessed. Third, as the ef-
fects of yoga were assessed immediately after intervention in most
of the existing studies, it may be of interest to know the long-
term efficacy of yoga. Fourth, studies to determine the MCID for
commonly used severity scores of asthma attacks are warranted.

Bidwell 2012
Methods
• Country: United States
• Setting: research laboratory/center based in Syracuse University, and resident
homes of the participants
• Design: a randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial
Participants
• Inclusion criteria: Quote: “a forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital
capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio of < 80% of predicted, use of a bronchodilator at least once
daily, and symptoms of wheezing and/or coughing for a minimum of 2 years that
improves either spontaneously or with drug therapy.”
• Exclusion criteria: Quote: “Subjects were excluded if they were smokers (smoking
≥ 2 cigarettes/day), participated in yoga therapy in the previous 12 months, were
diagnosed as having hypertension, major orthopedic injuries prohibiting the
performance of various yoga postures, and/or currently taking any medications that
would alter autonomic function (e.g., b-blockers).”
• No. of participants: 19
• Age (years) (range, mean/median): 20 to 65, 42
• Female (%): 100
• White (%): not reported
• Mean duration of asthma: not reported
• Severity of asthma: mild to moderate
Interventions
Yoga group (n = 12): 20 x 1-hour in-class yoga sessions in a group setting (2 times per
week for 10 weeks) and 10 x 30-minute sessions at home (1 time per week for 10 weeks)
• Each class consisted of 10 minutes of relaxation/deep breathing, 40 minutes of
various asanas (postures), and finished with 10 minutes of meditation to control stress
levels. The yoga asanas included forward and backward bends, isometric lunges,
balance poses, and static stretching, all part of a traditional Hatha yoga practice. The
home session was based on a written lesson plan (5 minutes of deep breathing, 20
minutes of asanas, and 5 minutes of meditation and relaxation).
• There was a 98% compliance rate for participants attending and participating in
the in-class yoga sessions and 100% compliance for the home sessions, as reported by a
brief questionnaire given on a weekly basis.
Control group (n = 8): usual care
• Participants were instructed not to participate in any yoga or related breathing
practices for the duration of the study. In addition, they were instructed not to begin
any new activities, but simply to follow the guidelines provided by their physicians.
• Participants were questioned about adherence to these instructions; all stated that
they had been compliant.
Outcomes
• Outcome(s): quality of life (SGRQ), FEV1, FVC, PEFR, tidal volume
• Assessment time point(s): 10 weeks

could still be a high risk of bias because the
sample size was so small (12 in the yoga
group versus 12 in the control group). In
addition, the 3 participants who withdrew
did so for asthma-related reasons. Quote:
“Three subjects from the control group had

Random sequence generation (selection

High risk
This is more like a matched cohort study
than a RCT. The two groups of participants
were balanced on the matched factors, but
not necessarily on others. The randomisa-
tion was conducted separately within ev-
ery pair of two participants, i.e. it was con-
ducted a total of 53 times, once for each
pair. However, to randomise or to just sub-
jectively assign two participants for each
pair into different groups is the same in
terms of potential to introduce bias, be-
cause other factors than the matched ones
could not be balanced in this way. Quote:
“Fifty three pairs of patients matched for
age and sex and type, severity, and duration
of asthma were selected from a bigger group
who came to our outpatient clinic for yoga
therapy. One from each pair was randomly
selected for training in yoga, and the other
served as a control.”
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
High risk
After the assignment status of 1 partici-
pant in a pair was determined, the inter-
vention to be received by the other mem-
ber of the pair, who had not been recruited,
was determined. Whether or not to recruit
a coming patient could thus be affected
by the staff’s knowledge of the assignment
scheme, which could lead to selection bias

• Inclusion criteria: (1) 18 years of age or older; (2) an established diagnosis of
mild-to-moderate asthma for at least 6 months; (3) taking at least 1 of the following:
inhaled beta2 agonists, methylxanthines, anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids,
leukotriene inhibitors or receptor antagonists, or mast cell-stabilising agents for at least
6 months; and (4) stable medication dosing for the past month.
• Exclusion criteria: (1) smoked currently (or in the past year) or had a smoking
history of greater than 5 pack-years; (2) had a concomitant lung disease; (3) had only
exercise-induced asthma; (4) practiced yoga in the past 3 years; (5) were pregnant; (6)
had a chronic medical condition that required treatment with oral corticosteroids in
the past month; (7) had a medical condition that contraindicated exercise; or (8) had
an unstable medical condition.

Interventions
Yoga group (n = 29): 90-minute sessions twice weekly for 4 weeks of Iyengar yoga,
including 15 asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing), and dhyana (meditation); rescue
inhaler use was allowed
Control group(n=33): 90-minute sessionstwice weeklyfor4weeksof shamintervention

We added a paragraph in the Methods section to explain how we transformed reported data to data suitable for meta-analysis and
how we managed data from the one cross-over trial we identified. We had not anticipated including cross-over trials in this review,
which is why this was not included in the original protocol. We added asthma control to the ’Summary of findings’ table, which
we inadvertently missed at the protocol stage. We consider this to be a patient-important outcome, thus justifying the change to the
protocol. In the protocol, we planned to conduct subgroup analysis according to “Ethnicity: Asian versus white versus Australian versus
African”; however, later the editors suggested that it was not appropriate to regard “Australian” as an ethnicity, and actually no eligible
studies from Australia were identified. Thus, in Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity, we deleted “versus Australian”.
