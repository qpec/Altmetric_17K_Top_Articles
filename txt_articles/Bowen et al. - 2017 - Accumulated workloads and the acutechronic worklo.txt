ABSTRACT
Aim The purpose of this study was to investigate the
relationship between physical workload and injury risk
in elite youth football players.
Methods The workload data and injury incidence of
32 players were monitored throughout 2 seasons.
Multiple regression was used to compare cumulative
(1, 2, 3 and 4-weekly) loads and acute:chronic (A:C)
workload ratios (acute workload divided by chronic
workload) between injured and non-injured players for
specific GPS and accelerometer-derived variables:total
distance (TD), high-speed distance (HSD), accelerations
(ACC) and total load. Workloads were classified into
discrete ranges by z-scores and the relative risk was
determined.
Results A very high number of ACC (≥9254) over
3 weeks was associated with the highest significant
overall (relative risk (RR)=3.84) and non-contact injury
risk (RR=5.11). Non-contact injury risk was
significantly increased when a high acute HSD was
combined with low chronic HSD (RR=2.55), but not
with high chronic HSD (RR=0.47). Contact injury risk
was greatest when A:C TD and ACC ratios were very
high (1.76 and 1.77, respectively) (RR=4.98).
Conclusions In general, higher accumulated and
acute workloads were associated with a greater injury
risk. However, progressive increases in chronic
workload may develop the players’ physical tolerance
to higher acute loads and resilience to injury risk.
INTRODUCTION
Football has evolved into a much faster, intensive
and more competitive game, with physical and
technical demands increasing substantially over the
past few years.1 To increase the chances of success,
coaches implement training loads, which challenge
the boundaries of what the players can achieve
without exceeding what their bodies can tolerate.2
According
to
Selye’s
General
Adaptation
Syndrome,3 training stimuli below the optimum are
insufficient to produce adaptations. Conversely,
stimuli above the optimum may lead to overtrain-
ing, which is largely associated with a higher inci-
dence of injury.4 Hence, an appropriate balance
between
training,
competition
and
recovery
is
required to attain peak performance and injury
avoidance.5 However, this balance is not always
adequately maintained, as highlighted by the higher
injury rate in football than in many other team
sports,6 with ∼50 injuries within an elite squad of
25 players per season.7 Thus, understanding and
monitoring the training programmes of football
players is vital to ensure that the optimal training
load is implemented.2 Ultimately, this will poten-
tially increase positive training adaptations and
reduce the prevalence of injury in football.8
The introduction of global positioning system
(GPS) into sports has led to many studies which
objectively
quantify
training
loads.
However,
despite growing interest, research into the relation-
ship between these training loads and injury is still
in its infancy. A higher injury risk has been found
with increased acute GPS-derived workloads in
Australian football and rugby league.2 4 Research
conducted over a longer period of time with larger
sample sizes was required to further understand the
injury–workload relationship. Consequently, Colby
et al9 examined the relationship between accumu-
lated GPS and accelerometer-derived loads and
injury in Australian football players. During pre-
season and in season, 3-weekly workloads were
indicative
of
a
greater
injury
risk.
Ultimately,
studies must consider the effect of the accumulation
of
load
to
fully
understand
the
relationship
between injury and workload.
Furthermore, because of the individual physio-
logical responses to movement demands in foot-
ball,10 categorising risk by absolute workloads
alone may not completely explain relationships
with injury across all players. Previous studies
examining the relationship between workload and
performance have assessed the absolute 1 week
workload
(acute
workload)
relative
to
4-week
chronic workload (4-week average acute work-
load).11 A workload index can then be calculated,
indicating whether the individual’s acute workload
is greater than, less than or equal to the preceding
chronic workload they have been prepared for.
This is the acute:chronic (A:C) workload ratio.12
Using this concept in cricket, fast bowlers were
three times more likely to get injured when the
acute bowling workloads were double the chronic
loads.13 Similarly in rugby, when the chronic total
distance was high, very high spikes in acute total
distance increased the injury risk. However, players
with a high chronic load were more resistant to
injury for moderate and moderate–high A:C work-
load ratios than those with lower chronic work-
loads,
suggesting
certain
higher
loads
have
a
protective effect.12 Furthermore, Gabbett14 recently
proposed that the prescription of training load may
be more indicative of injury than the load itself.
His training-injury prevention paradox states that
excessive, rapid increases in load heighten the risk
of injury, whereas chronic exposure to higher loads
augments the physical capacities of the athletes

 making them more resilient to injury, while also enhancing per-
formance. Thus, the assessment of the A:C workload ratio, for
high and low chronic loads, may provide a more comprehensive
prediction of injury risk than absolute workload alone. Evidence
of this has been recently demonstrated in A-League football,
where metres per minute in the 1 and 4 weeks prior to injury
were significantly higher than the seasonal average.15 Although
this was the first study to examine the relationship between
GPS-derived workloads and injury in football, only 16 injuries
were analysed and match data were not recorded, consequently
warranting further research.
Despite the inflated injury incidence6 and physical demands
of the sport,1 to date, there is very limited research exploring
the
contribution
of
GPS-derived/accelerometer-derived
load
monitoring to injury prediction in football. Furthermore, no
studies have examined the contribution of accumulated work-
loads and A:C workload ratios to injury risk. Therefore, this
study aimed to examine the relationships between accumulated
workloads and A:C workload ratios with injury risk in elite
youth football players across two seasons.
METHODS
Participants
Data were collected from elite youth football players (n=32)
from one English Premier League category 1 academy (age: 17.3
±0.9 years, stature: 180.0±7.3 cm, body mass: 74.1±7.0 kg).
The players trained on a full-time basis and played competitive
fixtures within the Under 18 or Under 21 Premier League during
the 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 seasons. T
wenty (63%) partici-
pants competed in both seasons and 12 (38%) participants com-
peted in one season—resulting in 52 individual football seasons.
Goalkeepers were excluded from the study due to the different
nature of their activity. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Research Ethics Committee of The University of Birmingham.
Quantifying workload
W
orkload was quantified using GPS, with data collected from
all on-pitch training sessions and matches. The GPS units (Viper
V
.2, StatSports, Ireland) were placed between the scapulae of the
players in bespoke vests. These units sampled at 10 Hz and the
accelerometers at 100 Hz. Following each session, the data were
downloaded using the specialised analysis software (Viper,
V
.2.1.3.0).
For sessions when GPS data were unavailable for a participant
(n=480 of 12 117; 4%) because he was not wearing a unit, he
could not complete the entire session or the data were deemed
unreliable due to the intermittent satellite signal; the data were
estimated as follows:
Main training session data were estimated by calculating
squad averages for drills completed.
Game data were estimated using individual season game
averages (from a minimum of three matches) while considering
individual game time.
The variables defined in table 1 were selected for use in this
study due to their relevance to running loads (and potential
injury). All the variables were obtained from the StatSports soft-
ware (Viper).
Definition of injury
Injury information was classified by the academy doctor and
senior chartered physiotherapists, collated, then updated in the
club’s database. A recordable injury was defined as one that
caused any absence from future football participation.16 Injuries
were classified as follows: minimal (1–3 days of football activity
missed), mild (4–7 days of football activity missed), moderate
(1–4 weeks of football activity missed) or severe (4+ weeks of
football activity missed).16
Injuries were also categorised by injury type (description) and
body site (injury location). The mechanism in which a partici-
pant acquired an injury was also classified as being non-contact
or contact in nature.
Data analyses
Data were categorised in weekly blocks from Monday to
Sunday. Every time a player participated in a training session or
match, and data were analysed in two ways. First, the previous
1-weekly, 2-weekly, 3-weekly and 4-weekly loads were calcu-
lated. The loads were then classified into discrete ranges from
very low through to very high using z-scores17 (table 2). The
relationships between these weekly cumulative loads and subse-
quent injury were investigated.
Second, acute workload was calculated as 1-week load and
chronic workload as the 4-week rolling average acute workload.
The A:C workload ratio was calculated by dividing the acute
workload by the chronic workload.13 A value of >1 represents
an acute workload greater than the chronic workload and vice
versa. Chronic workloads were also separated into high and low
categories by the median score for each variable.12 From this,
injury–workload relationships between A:C ratios combined
with high and low chronic workloads were analysed. As with
accumulated workloads, the ratios were categorised based on
z-scores (table 3).
Statistical analyses
The analysis was performed in a manner similar to the previ-
ous work of Colby et al9 and Hulin et al.12 Injury incidence
was determined by dividing total number of injuries by the
‘on-legs’ exposure time and reported as rates per 1000 hours.
Injury risks were calculated as the number of injuries sustained
relative
to
the
number
of
exposures
to
each
workload

sus statement on data collection procedures outlined by the
Fédération
de
Football
Association
Medical
Assessment
Research Centre (F-MARC).16 A binary logistic regression
model was used to compare workloads between injured and
non-injured
players
for
all
GPS/accelerometer
variables.
Accumulated workload and A:C workload ratios were inde-
pendently modelled as predictor variables.
Relative risk (RR) was calculated to determine the injury risk
above and below given workloads or ratios. When an RR was
greater than 1.00, an increased risk of injury was reported (ie,
RR=1.50 is indicative of a 50% increased risk) and vice versa.
For an RR to be significant, 95% CIs did not contain the null
RR of 1.00. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics
V
.21.0 and reported as means and 95% CI. Significance was
accepted at p<0.05.
RESULTS
Injury incidence
A total of 138 injuries (12.1/1000 hours ‘on-legs’ exposure
time) were recorded for the duration of this study (2013–2014,
13.8/1000 hours;
2014–2015,
10.1/1000 hours),
including
contact and non-contact injuries (table 4). The ankle/foot (4.7/
1000 hours) was the most common site of contact and non-
contact injury over the two seasons, with the most common
types
of
contact
injury
being
haematoma/contusion
(3.8/
1000 hours) and non-contact injury being ligament sprains (2.1/
1000 hours). Overall, the incidence of injury in competition was
over four times that of training (33.5/1000 hours and 7.9/
1000 hours, respectively). In particular, the incidence of contact
injuries was considerably greater in competition than in training
(24.2/1000 hours vs 2.3/1000 hours) and despite a lower expos-
ure to competition, 44% of contact injuries occurred in
matches. The total number of days that players were absent was
3110 (22.1±52.8 days per injury).
Absolute accumulated workloads
Total distance
Performing a high total distance (TD; 112 244–143 918 m) over
4 weeks was associated with the greatest significant overall
injury risk compared to all other distances (RR=1.64, 95% CI
1.05 to 2.58, p=0.031). TD above 143 918 m demonstrated a
risk but was statistically non-significant (RR=1.29, 95% CI
0.34
to
4.99,
p=0.710).
Conversely,
a
low
(0–8812 m)
1-weekly TD reduced the risk of overall (RR=0.25, 95% CI
0.11 to 0.82, p=0.018) and non-contact injury (RR=0.30, 95%
CI 0.11 to 0.57, p=0.001).
High-speed running
Moderate–high 4-weekly high-speed distance (HSD; 3502–
5123 m) demonstrated the greatest significant increase in non-
contact
injury
risk
when
compared
to
other
workloads
(RR=2.14, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.50, p=0.003) and moderate–high
1-weekly HSD (856–1449 m) showed the highest significant
overall injury risk (RR=1.73, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.84, p=0.029).
Overall and non-contact injury risks were significantly reduced
at low 1-weekly HSD (0–756 m) (RR=0.30, 95% CI 0.13 to
0.68, p=0.004; RR=0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83, p=0.023,
respectively).

 Accelerations
When many accelerations (ACC; ≥9254) were performed in
3 weeks, there was a significant increase in the risk of overall
(RR=3.84, 95% CI 1.57 to 9.41, p=0.003) and non-contact
injuries
(RR=5.11,
95%
CI
1.75
to
14.96,
p=0.003).
Conversely, a low amount of ACC over 3 weeks (744–2861) sig-
nificantly reduced non-contact (RR=0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to
0.87, p=0.031) and overall (RR=0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.76,
p=0.010) injury risk.
Total load
High 1-weekly total load (TL; 474–648 AU) recorded the great-
est significant relative risk for overall (RR=1.65, 95% CI 1.04
to 2.62, p=0.032) and non-contact injuries (RR=2.20, 95% CI
1.25 to 3.9, p=0.007). Furthermore, a very high 1-weekly TL
(≥648 AU) significantly increased the incidence of a contact
injury (RR=4.84, 95% CI 1.26 to 18.55, p=0.022). On the
other
hand,
a
low
1-weekly
TL
(0–130 AU)
significantly
reduced overall (RR=0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.60, p=0.002),
and non-contact injury risk (RR=0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.86,
p=0.024).
Table 5 summarises the risk of contact, non-contact and
overall injury for all accumulated workloads.
A:C workload ratios
Total distance
The risk of contact injury was significantly increased when the
A:C TD ratio was ≥1.76 (very high) (RR=4.98, 95% CI 1.31 to
19.02, p=0.019). For low chronic TD only (<22 335 m),
overall injury risk was reduced when the ratio between acute
and chronic TD was low (0–0.32) (RR=0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to
0.91, p=0.030).
High-speed running
For low chronic HSD only (<938 m), non-contact injury risk
was heightened when the ratio between the acute and chronic
HSD was high 1.41–1.96 (RR=2.55, 95% CI 1.15 to 5.68,
p=0.022). In addition, for high chronic HSD (>938 m), non-
contact injury risk was also increased when the ratio was moder-
ate–high
(0.91–1.34)
(RR=2.09,
95%
CI
1.06
to
4.12,
p=0.033). However, a low ratio (0–0.36) for all chronic HSD
significantly reduced the overall injury risk (RR=0.47, 95% CI
0.25 to 0.9, p=0.022).
Accelerations
The risk of contact injuries was significantly increased when the
A:C ACC ratio was over 1.77 (very high) (RR=4.98, 95% CI
1.30 to 18.99, p=0.019). Overall injury risk was reduced when
the ratio between acute and chronic ACC was low (0–0.33) for
low chronic accelerations only (<1856) (RR=0.29, 95% CI
0.09 to 0.91, p=0.034).
Total load
The risk of non-contact injury was significantly increased when
the ratio between acute and chronic TL was moderate–high
(0.88–1.32) (RR=1.87, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.12, p=0.016).
Similarly, the risk of contact injury was increased when the ratio
was moderate–low (0.44–0.88) (RR=1.92, 95% CI 1.07 to
3.45, p=0.028).

 Table 6 summarises the risk of contact, non-contact and
overall injury for all A:C workload ratios.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to examine the relationship of accumulated
GPS-derived/accelerometer-derived loads and A:C workload
ratios with contact and non-contact injury incidence in football.
In line with other studies examining load and injury in
sport,2 4 9 15 18 many GPS/accelerometer variables were found
to be significantly related to injury risk. Three-weekly accelera-
tions >9254 were the strongest indicator of overall (RR=3.84)
and non-contact (RR=5.11) injury risk in this study. These find-
ings provide empirical support for monitoring the accumulated
training loads over 3 weeks, and correspond with those of
Colby et al9 who found various 3-weekly workloads to have the
strongest association with injury risk in Australian football
during preseason and in season.
High 4-weekly TD (112 244–143–917 m) and 1-weekly TL
(474–647 AU) also significantly increased the risk of overall and
non-contact injuries (RR=1.64 and 1.65, respectively) similar to
previous literature, where higher training loads resulted in a
greater injury incidence.2 4 Conversely, for HSD, a moderate–
high load over 1 (856–1448 m) and 4 (3502–5122 m) weeks
resulted
in
higher
overall
(RR=1.73)
and
non-contact
(RR=2.14) injury incidence, respectively, compared to lower and
higher HSD. W
orkload classification by z-scores in this study
means that the greatest risk of non-contact injury was associated
with the most commonly performed high-speed running dis-
tances. Non-contact injury risk was also significantly augmented
for a moderate–high A:C TL ratio (A:C=0.88–1.31, RR=1.87)
and a moderate–high A:C HSD ratio combined with high
chronic HSD only (>938 m) (A:C=0.91–1.33, RR=2.09).
Thus, when the acute and chronic stimuli are similar, the inci-
dence of injury is increased. In addition, a high A:C workload
ratio combined with low chronic HSD (<938 m) showed a sig-
nificantly
increased
risk
of
non-contact
injury
incidence
(A:C=1.41–1.96, RR=2.55), which was not evident when com-
bined with high chronic HSD (A:C=1.34–1.77, RR=0.47). This
may be indicative of underpreparedness, similar to that reported
by Hulin et al,12 where the previous 4-week chronic HSD expos-
ure was insufficient to prepare the player for high acute bouts.
The combination of these findings would suggest that optimal
HSD and TL exposure should be periodised to fluctuate across a
4-week period, with the achievement of high and low workloads.
In addition, the chronic exposure of HSD should be high enough
to prepare the players for the necessary spikes in the A:C work-
load ratio. Ultimately, a certain level of training must be achieved
to develop the physical capacities needed to withstand the
demands of the sport.14 Players who can safely train harder may
develop a greater resilience and tolerance for the progressively
increasing intensity and fatigue of competition.1

 The majority of studies that assess training loads and injury
risk focus solely on non-contact, soft tissue injury, as these are
considered largely preventable, whereas contact injuries are con-
sidered mostly unavoidable.8 However, Gabbett et al18 found
higher workloads to be strongly correlated with contact injuries
in professional rugby. Consistent with their findings, the present
study demonstrated that very high 1-weekly TL (≥648 AU) and
very high A:C ratios for TD and ACC (≥1.76 and ≥1.77,
respectively) were significantly related to a higher risk of contact
injury (TL: RR=4.84, TD and ACC: RR=4.98). Banister et al11
reported acute workload as an estimate of an athlete’s ‘fatigue’
and chronic workload as ‘fitness’. In the context of this study, a
larger discrepancy between acute workload (‘fatigue’) and
chronic workload (‘fitness’) resulted in a greater contact injury
risk than when the ratio was moderate or low (the measure of
‘fitness’ was similar to or higher than that of ‘fatigue’).
Furthermore, the ratios above which a significant risk of contact
injury was recorded were higher than those for non-contact
injury in this study, and previous work within Australian foot-
ball, cricket and rugby league (>1.5).14 This suggests that a
higher level of fatigue (acute workload) relates to contact injury
than non-contact injury. Ultimately, by increasing fitness levels
and limiting fatigue, players may be able to respond more
quickly to avoid the rapid, unpredictable movements preceding
contact injury.19 The only exception to this was a significant risk
of contact injury for a moderate–low A:C ratio of TL (0.44–
0.87). Gabbett14 found a ‘sweet spot’ for the A:C ratio between
0.8 and 1.3 to maximise fitness and performance while reducing
injury risk. Therefore, underpreparedness, or low tolerance to
load, may also be a factor in the occurrence of contact injury.
These findings demonstrate the multifactorial nature of injury
and highlight the need for future research, specifically into
contact injuries.
T
otal injury incidence (12.1/1000 hours) and also training
(7.9/1000 hours) and match (33.5/1000 hours) incidences were
similar to those recorded in the UEFA injury study involving 23
top European clubs over seven seasons.7 However, in this study,
the large prevalence of contact injuries in competition goes
further to highlight the importance of monitoring the A:C
workload ratios, particularly during fixture congested periods,
when ensuring adequate recovery between games, while main-
taining optimum training loads is a challenge.
Although low accumulated workloads and A:C workload
ratios demonstrated a significantly reduced injury risk across
all metrics, the authors do not recommend regular training
at these workloads. Football players cover ∼10 000 m during
a match; therefore, low (≤8812 m) weekly distances may
result in the players being underprepared for the physical
demands of the game, and ultimately may increase their risk
of injury. Although there is no doubt that higher training
loads are related to a heightened injury risk, when correctly
prescribed, higher loads can also produce positive adapta-
tions that build tolerance and resilience to fatigue and
injury.14
This was the first study to monitor injury risk using GPS from
training and competition in football, providing comprehensive

analysis.
The
inclusion
of
match
data
accounted for match-to-match variability that has been a limita-
tion of previous studies using estimated data.15 However, the
players participated in a variety of other conditioning workloads
as well as the on-field sessions that could not be quantified by
GPS/accelerometer
loads.9
Ultimately,
the
incorporation
of
Session rating of perceived exertion (RPE) values, as a measure
of internal workload, may provide a more complete insight into
the likelihood of injury, as well as taking into consideration the
athlete’s response to a given workload.13
The greater sampling frequency (10 Hz) and integrated accel-
erometers of the GPS units used in this study allowed for valid
and reliable assessment of high intensity activity and injury
risk20 that was not possible in previous studies using lower sam-
pling devices (1 and 5 Hz).12 However, measurement error has
been found to increase with speed, regardless of sampling rate
and therefore caution must still be taken when interpreting the
data.21
While GPS outcomes may be considered modifiable injury
risk factors, non-modifiable factors such as age and injury
history were not taken into account, despite being associated
with future injury incidence.22 Furthermore, the sample size did
not permit the analysis of position-specific workloads and injury
risk.
Another limitation of the sample size is that the number of
injury cases recorded was enough to detect moderate to strong
associations between training load and injury, but too small to
detect
small
to
moderate
associations.23
Future
research
combining data from multiple clubs would solve this issue;
however, due to the competitive nature of elite sport, it may
prove difficult.
In conclusion, accumulated GPS/accelerometer loads and A:
C workload ratios were significantly related to non-contact and
contact injury risk in elite youth football players. In general,
the higher workloads were associated with the greater injury
risks, corresponding to previous literature. Three-weekly ACC
≥9254 was the strongest predictor of overall and non-contact
injury risk and should therefore be monitored in practice for
injury prevention purposes. In addition, the results suggest that
low chronic HSD underprepare the players for the risk of high
acute workloads, compared to high chronic HSD. As shown in
previous research,14 it may not necessarily be higher workloads
that augment injury risk but the prescription of these higher
loads. Spikes in non-contact injury risk, when the acute and
chronic workloads were similar, highlight the need for system-
atic variation in the training programme. Ultimately, high,
excessive, accumulated and acute loads were related to a
greater injury risk. However, progressive chronic exposure to
higher workloads, including appropriate fluctuations to allow
for adaptation and recovery,3 may protect the players from
injury by developing their physical capacities. The findings of
this study provide initial guidelines for optimal workloads in
elite youth football to reduce injury occurrence. However,
caution should be applied when generalising these data to
different teams and sports due to the specific nature of the
physical demands.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ The findings of this study provide initial guidelines for
implementing optimal accumulated workloads and A:C
workload ratios in elite youth football to reduce injury
occurrence.
▸ Global positioning system-derived/accelerometer-derived
variables can be modelled to predict non-contact and
contact injury risk.
▸ A:C workload ratios should be incorporated into clinical
practice and compared to low and high chronic workloads.
What are the findings?
▸ This is the first study to examine the relationships of
accumulated global positioning system-derived/
accelerometer-derived loads and acute:chronic (A:C) work
load ratios with contact and non-contact injury incidence
in football.
▸ The injury risk was greatest when a very high number of
accelerations were accumulated over 3 weeks.
▸ Optimal high-speed running exposure should be periodised
to fluctuate across a 4-week period, with the achievement of
high and low distances, while ensuring that the chronic
exposure is high enough to prepare the players for the
necessary spikes in the A:C workload ratio.
▸ Contact injuries are significantly related to 1-weekly ‘spikes’
in various workload measures.
