Background: The prevalence of autism has been reported to have increased worldwide. A decrease over time in the
number of autism symptoms required for a clinical autism diagnosis would partly help explain this increase. This
study aimed to determine whether the symptom level of clinically diagnosed autism cases below age 13 had changed
over time. Methods: Parents of Swedish 9-year old twins (n = 28,118) participated in a telephone survey, in which
symptoms and dysfunction/suffering related to neurodevelopmental disorders [including autism, but also attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), and Learning Disabilities (LD)]
in their children were assessed over a 10-year period. Survey data was merged with the National Patient Register
containing clinically registered autism diagnoses (n = 271). Results: In individuals who had been clinically
diagnosed with autism before the age of 13, the symptom score for autism decreased on average 30% over more
than a decade in birth cohorts 1992–2002. There was an average decrease of 50% in the autism symptom score from
2004 to 2014 in individuals who were diagnosed with autism at ages 7–12, but there was no decrease in those
diagnosed at ages 0–6. Conclusions: Over time, considerably fewer autism symptoms seemed to be required for a
clinical diagnosis of autism, at least for those diagnosed after the preschool years. The findings add support for the
notion that the observed increase in autism diagnoses is, at least partly, the by-product of changes in clinical
practice,

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was once consid-
ered rare with prevalence estimates under 0.05%
(Lotter, 1966). Since the late 1990s there has been a
remarkable increase in the rate of clinical diagnoses
of ASD, and it has been estimated that the average
prevalence is about one per cent in both children
(Baird et al., 2006) and adults (Brugha et al., 2011).
Recent studies report even higher estimates. In the
United States, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) reported that 2.3% of boys aged
8 years met the surveillance case criteria for ASD
(Christensen et al., 2016). In South Korea, the
prevalence has been reported to be 2.6% in children
(Kim et al., 2011); finally, a medical record linkage
study from Sweden reported that 2.5% of all teen-
agers residing in Stockholm county had received an
ASD diagnosis in clinical settings (Idring et al.,
2015).
Although it is difficult to definitely rule out an
actual increase in the incidence of ASD, the rising
rates most likely stem from a combination of admin-
istrative secular changes. A recent study reported
that the prevalence of the autism symptom pheno-
type was stable over a decade in young children,
while simultaneously the prevalence of clinically
diagnosed ASD increased substantially (Lundstr€
om,
Reichenberg, Anckars€
ater, Lichtenstein, & Gillberg,
2015). In the United Kingdom, the estimated preva-
lence among adults is similar to that in children,
speaking against an increase in incidence (Brugha
et al., 2011). The possible reasons for the increase in
diagnosed individuals and the observed disparity
between register-based data and questionnaires are
numerous. First, there has been a widening of the
diagnostic criteria (Wing & Potter, 2002) and 1/3 of
the increase in ASD prevalence in Denmark has been
suggested to stem from the transition of ICD-8 to
ICD-10 (Hansen, Schendel, & Parner, 2015). Second,
increased public awareness of autism makes people
more prone to seek diagnostic assessment (Liu, King,
& Bearman, 2010). Third, increasing professional
recognition of ASD may give rise to substitution
across diagnostic categories (Coo et al., 2008). For
instance, the increase in ASD has been shown to be
paralleled by a decrease in diagnosed intellectual
disability/mental retardation and learning disability
(King & Bearman, 2009; Shattuck, 2006). Fourth,
although not fully meeting diagnostic criteria for
ASD, individuals with autistic traits may nonethe-
less be clinically diagnosed with ASD to ensure
support in school or to gain access to disability
services (Taylor et al., 2016).
Autism spectrum disorder is a behaviorally defined
disorder and its assessment is, at a minimum, based
on behavioral observations and developmental his-
tory (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). How-
ever, there is broad consensus, and widely accepted

 quality standards, that any ASD assessment should
also include examinations targeting other neurode-
velopmental and mental health problems, other med-
ical conditions, genetic syndromes, visual, hearing
and speech impairments, as well as observations in
more than one setting (Gillberg, 2010; NICE, 2011).
Nevertheless, diagnostic practice among health pro-
fessionals is not always consistent with internation-
ally established guidelines (Randall et al., 2016;
Taylor et al., 2016).
In view of the increasing ASD prevalence rates and
societal and diagnostic practice changes we hypoth-
esized that the number of autism symptoms/fea-
tures shown by individuals clinically diagnosed with
ASD might have decreased over time. Using the score
of a standardized measure, in a clearly defined
patient population drawn from a total population
twin sample of children born between 1992 and
2007, we aimed to (a) detect whether the number of
ASD symptoms in clinically diagnosed ASD cases
had decreased over time, (b) analyze whether any
changes might be associated with age at diagnosis,
and (c) investigate whether individuals diagnosed
with ASD in childhood would show variation in the
amount of coexisting non-ASD problems and of
dysfunction and suffering over time.
Methods
Participants
Two sources of data were used in this study: (a) The Child and
Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) and (b) the National
Patient Register (NPR).
Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden.
The
CATSS is an ongoing prospective study that started in 2004, in
which parents of all twins born in Sweden are contacted and
asked to participate in a telephone interview in connection with
their twins0 9th or 12th birthday. Twins born between 1 July
1992 and 31 June 1995 were included at age 12, thereafter
only 9-year olds were included. The CATSS has a response rate
of 75% and is described elsewhere (Anckars€
ater et al., 2011).
In this study, we included 28,118 twins born from 1 July 1992
up until 28 February 2007 whose parents had responded to
the Autism-Tics, ADHD and other Comorbidities inventory
(A-TAC) (Hansson et al., 2005).
Autism:
The A-TAC has been included in the CATSS since
the beginning of the study and is a fully structured parental
telephone interview measuring various domains of child and
adolescent psychiatry. It is designed to be used by laymen over
the phone. It consists of 96 symptom questions, which are
asked from a lifetime perspective, and 38 questions that
inquire about the dysfunction/suffering arising from the
symptomatology. The average interview time is 27.5 min
(Larson et al., 2014). Of the 96 questions, 17 constitute the
autism domain (Cronbach0s a = .86), of which six correspond
to a language/communication module (a = .66), six to a social
interaction module (a = .77), and five items to a stereotyped
and repetitive behavior module (a = .70) (Anckars€
ater et al.,
2011). All items are coded ‘no’ (0), ‘yes, to some extent’ (0.5)
and ‘yes’ (1). These 17 items constitute an autism symptom
score, ranging from 0 to 17. The A-TAC has been extensively
validated
with
four
cross-sectional
(Cubo
et al.,
2011;
Hansson et al., 2005; Larson et al., 2010, 2014) and one
longitudinal validation study (Larson et al., 2013) reporting
excellent psychometric properties for ASD. A clinically vali-
dated autism symptom score cut-off of ≥8.5 was used in this
article to define the autism symptom phenotype. This cut-off
has a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.95 when cases
were compared cross-sectionally with controls, and 0.61 and
0.91, compared to cases, controls and a community sample
(Larson et al., 2010). In a 3-year longitudinal clinical follow-up
this cut-off had a sensitivity of 0.30 and a specificity of 0.99
(Larson et al., 2013). The A-TAC is freely available at www.gnc.
gu.se.
Coexisting disorders:
From the A-TAC validated cut-offs
for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Learning
Disability (LD) and Developmental Coordination Disorder
(DCD) were used to identify ASD cases with ‘comorbidity’.
The A-TAC ADHD-domain consists of 19 questions and a cut-
off of ≥12.5 yields sensitivity of 0.56 and specificity of 0.93. The
LD-domain consists of three questions and has a cut-off of 3
and sensitivity of 0.41 and specificity of 0.93. The DCD-
domain contains 1 question and has a cutoff of 1 and a
sensitivity and specificity of 0.32/0.87 (Larson et al., 2010).
ASD-cases were assigned scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on
whether or not they scored at or above cut-off for 0, 1, 2, or all 3
‘comorbidity’ domains.
Dysfunction and suffering:
If, at the A-TAC-telephone
interview, the respondent endorses one or more items in a
module as ‘yes’ or ‘yes, to some extent’, he/she is asked
whether the endorsed symptoms have led to (1) dysfunction in
school, among peers, or at home, and/or (2) suffering on the
part of the child. The questions are scored in the same fashion
as described above. Given that the autism domain comprises
three modules, the possible autism dysfunction/suffering score
ranges from 0 to 6.
The National Patient Register.
A personal identifica-
tion number is assigned to every individual born in Sweden or
upon receiving Swedish citizenship. The NPR currently con-
tains data on all inpatient diagnoses from 1987 through 2014,
and also includes diagnoses assigned in outpatient clinics
from 2001 and onwards. Using the personal identification
number, we merged the CATSS sample with the NPR and
retrieved relevant diagnostic codes for autism: ICD-9 299A,
ICD-10 f84.0, f84.1, f84.5, f84.8, and f84.9, including date of
first diagnosis. The NPR is continuously updated and has been
validated for several conditions. Specifically, for ASD, Idring
et al. (2012) scrutinized medical records in several registers,
including the NPR, and reported an agreement of 96% between
medical records and registered diagnoses (Idring et al., 2012).
Definition of sample.
In the NPR, we identified 430
individuals with a registered ASD-diagnosis whose parents
had also responded in CATSS. Those twins who had their first
ASD diagnosis assigned before their 13th birthday (n = 277)
were included, to ensure equal follow-up time. Of these, six
individuals did not have full data in CATSS and where
therefore excluded from the analyses. Thus, the final sample
included 271 individuals who were born between 1992 and
2007.
Two groups were created to examine the possible effect of
birth year and age at diagnosis. First, to investigate whether
birth year was associated with the degree of phenotypic
expression of ASD, 207 individuals born between 1 July
1992 and 31 December 2002 were included. The end date
was chosen so that all individuals had at least 12 years of
exposure time to be assigned a diagnosis in the NPR, which
contains diagnostic data up until December 31st 2014.
Second, to investigate whether any secular changes in the

 phenotypic expression of ASD would be associated with age at
diagnosis, 233 individuals were included. The 233 individuals
were subdivided into two groups: (a) 51 individuals who had
received a diagnosis between the ages 1–6 during the calendar
years 1998–2007 and (b) 182 individuals who had received a
diagnosis between the ages 7–12 during the calendar years
2004–2014. As the age when being assigned a diagnosis affects
the autism symptom score (r = �.439) only certain calendar
year of diagnosis could be included to ensure comparability.
That is, each calendar year of diagnosis between 1998 and
2007 (those receiving a diagnosis between ages 1–6), but not
before or after, represented the entire spectrum (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 &
6) of age at diagnosis. For instance, the calendar year of
diagnosis of 1997 was not representative as only 5 years of
follow-up were eligible, thus, an age at diagnosis of 6 would not
have been possible. Similarly, during the years 2004–2014,
our sample contained individuals of all ages between 7 and 12.
Statistical analysis
Mean values with 95% Wald confidence intervals were calcu-
lated for individuals who were diagnosed before the age of 13.
Three separate linear regressions were conducted with the
A-TAC autism symptom score as the dependent variable and
the independent variables being (a), birth year, (b) calendar
year of diagnosis in individuals diagnosed at 1–6 years of age,
and (c) calendar year of diagnosis in individuals diagnosed at
7–12 years of age. Linear regression was also used to estimate
changes by calendar year of diagnosis in dysfunction/suffering
score as well as comorbidity score. In addition, the scores of
the three modules constituting the ASD-domain, and the
LD-domain were analyzed separately. Generalized estimation
equations were used in all regressions to derive sandwich
robust standard errors to account for the dependence within
twin pairs. For categorical variables we used the Cochran-
Armitage test for trend. SPSS statistics version 23 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY) was used for all analyses.
Mean values for the subgroups (299A, F84.0, F84.1, F84.5,
F84.8, F84.9) per birth year can be found in Table S1.
Attrition analysis
To assure that variations in attrition would not bias the
results, we tested whether there was a reduction in the autism
symptom score in the total CATSS population over time. A
linear regression was conducted with the autism symptom
score as the dependent variable and year of birth as the
independent variable: an extremely small increase in ASD
symptoms could be detected (coefficient = 0.012, R2 = .001,
F29.636, p < .001). In addition, it has previously been reported
that there is no trend for nonresponders being more likely to be
given a clinical diagnosis of ASD (Lundstr€
om et al., 2015).
Ethics
The CATSS and its linkage to the NPR has ethical approval
from the Karolinska Institutet ethical review board (Dnr 02-
289 and 2010/507-31/1).
Results
During the birth years 1992–2002, the prevalence of
the A-TAC autism symptom phenotype was stable
(p = .962, Table 1, Figure 1). During the same per-
iod, the prevalence of a clinical diagnosis in the NPR
increased almost fivefold from 0.39% to 1.86%
(Table 1, Figure 1, p < .001). For those with a regis-
tered diagnosis in the NPR the mean A-TAC autism
symptom score decreased from 8.3 to 5.7 over the
examined birth years (Table 1, Figure 1). Regression
analysis
demonstrated
a
negative
correlation
between autism symptom score and year of birth,
the regression coefficient being �0.328 (p = .001,
Table 1). The downward trend could also be seen in
all modules constituting the autism symptom score
although it was nonsignificant for the language
domain (p = .142, Table S2).
In individuals who had been given a diagnosis
between ages 1–6 years, mean autism symptom
score did not change over time (Table 2, Figure 2).
This was mirrored in the regression analysis in
which no effect could be discerned (p = .480) with a
coefficient of �0.145 (Table 2). However, in the group

Changes in the symptom level of autism
3
 of individuals who received a clinical diagnosis
between the ages 7–12, mean autism symptom score
in the A-TAC decreased from 8.96 in 2004–2005 to
4.63 in 2014 (Table 2, Figure 2). Linear regression
analysis rendered a significant decrease in autism
symptom
score
(p = .002)
with
a
coefficient
of
�0.341.
The comorbidity score was constant over time in
the two age groups (p = .625 and p = .187, respec-
tively, Table S3). Mean score of the learning disabil-
ity module did not change significantly over time for
those
with
an
assigned
diagnosis
at
ages
1–6
(p = .938) while for 7–12 year olds a borderline
significance could be discerned (p = .08, Table S3).
In the group with a clinical ASD diagnosis between 1
and 6 years of age, the mean dysfunction/suffering
score decreased from 4.00 to 1.95 (p = .009). For
individuals
given
a
diagnosis
between
7
and
12 years of age, the dysfunction/suffering score did
not change significantly (p = .279, Table S3).
Discussion
Using the same validated instrument over more than
a decade to assess autism symptoms independent of
clinical evaluation we found a decrease in average
autism symptom score in clinically diagnosed cases
of ASD. This held true across consecutive birth
cohorts (c. 30% decrease), and especially in individ-
uals who received a clinical diagnosis at age 7–12
(c. 50% decrease). However, the A-TAC autism symp-
tom score was stable in those receiving a diagnosis at
ages 0–6. Simultaneously, the prevalence of regis-
tered ASD diagnoses increased almost five-fold in
spite of the autism symptom phenotype in the total
population remaining stable in this group.
It needs to be emphasized that the observed decrease
in autism‘symptom load’ indiagnosed individuals does
not necessarily correspond to a decrease in the need for
interventions and societal support. For instance, the
presence of coexisting disorders has been suggested to
be a more important factor contributing to the need for
support than ASD symptoms per se (Gillberg & Fernell,
2014). In the group with the largest decrease in autism
symptom score (7–12 years at diagnosis), the comor-
bidity and dysfunction/suffering scores were fairly
constant, despite the decrease in the autism symptom
score. The results may in part be explained by diag-
nostic upgrading, i.e. assignment of an ASD diagnosis
in the faceofuncertainty (Rogers, Goddard, Hill, Henry,
& Crane, 2016; Skellern, Schluter, & Mcdowell, 2005).
Taylor et al. (2016) reported that 17% of clinicians in
Australia had diagnosedASD in individuals with autis-
tic traits not meeting full diagnostic criteria, for pur-
poses such as ensuring support in school or gaining
access to disability services (Taylor et al., 2016). The
number of autism diagnoses in special education
services in the United States and in those eligible for
community support in Sweden has increased (Gurney
et al., 2003; Shattuck, 2006; Socialstyrelsen, 2015).
However, there are concerns that individuals with the
‘correct’ diagnoses (e.g. ASD) are much more likely to
receive support (Fernell, Landgren, Lindstr€
om, John-
son, & Gillberg, 2013; Gillberg & Fernell, 2014). A
consequence of this is that individuals with complex
psychiatric problem constellations and dysfunction,
but without the ‘correct’ diagnosis, run a risk of being
denied community support.
The constant degree of dysfunction/suffering in
spite of a decrease in autism ‘symptom load’ may
also indicate a change in perception of what it is that
is disabling. It is generally agreed that the school
environment has changed to include more coopera-
tion in groups and self-reflecting abilities, which
might increase the demands for sociocommunicative
skills. Sociocommunicative abilities exist on a con-
tinuum with no clear boundary between ‘normal’ and

When
demands
for
sociocommunicative
abilities
in
school
settings
change and exceed the individual0s capacity, a shift
of what is considered a disability may occur. The
findings that the mean autism symptom score was
inversely correlated with age at diagnosis reasonably
implies that cases with the most symptomatology,
presumably the most obvious cases of ASD, are
identified early. Cases with less obvious ASD symp-
tomatology, but with impairments perhaps stem-
ming from ‘comorbid’ problems such as ADHD or LD,
are not recognized until school age, possibly when
demands for social and other skills increase. The
question remains as to whether or not it is reason-
able to apply the label of ASD in all cases with any
kind of sociocommunicative problem. However, it
already seems likely that many cases receiving a
clinical diagnosis of ASD do not meet the diagnostic
criteria of the DSM.
Strengths of the present research include the use
of data from a nationwide study population with a
high response rate, in which the same well-validated
instrument was used and merged with a nationwide
register on clinical ASD diagnoses. The same, ICD-
10,
clinical
diagnostic
system
has
been
used
throughout the time period investigated (Ludvigsson
et al., 2011). Therefore, change in diagnostic criteria
can reasonably be ruled out as a major cause of the
present findings.
There are, however, some limitations that should
be considered. First, the A-TAC is designed for large
scale epidemiological studies with very good – albeit
not perfect – sensitivity and specificity (Larson et al.,
2010). Thus, some measurement error and diagnos-
tic misclassification should be expected. However,
collapsing individual values into large groups should
even out the potentially imprecise measurement by
the A-TAC at the individual level. Also, clinical
assessments would be preferable, however, these
are rarely feasible in nationwide studies. Second, we
assessed symptoms of autism and ASD diagnoses in
a national population-based cohort of twins, not
singletons. However, overall, twins have not been
convincingly shown to have a higher rate of autism
as compared with nontwins, and it seems unlikely
that they would need fewer symptoms than would
singletons to be clinically perceived as having ASD.
In addition, population-based studies have sup-
ported that twins can be considered representative
of the general population in terms of the probability
of acquiring a diagnosis of ASD (Croen, Grether, &
Selvin,
2002;
Hallmayer
et al.,
2002;
Hultman,
Spar�
en, & Cnattingius, 2002). Also, all analyses
were recalculated excluding all pairs concordant (29
pairs) for an ASD diagnosis (for instance as parents
that already have one diagnosed child might be more
prone to notice subtler symptoms, and also be more
likely to seek diagnostic assessment due to familiar-
ity with autism) and no change in the trend could be

Changes in the symptom level of autism

 discerned (data available upon request). Third, as
the introduction of outpatient data in 2001 may have
confounded the results, we performed a sensitivity
analysis excluding inpatient data (7 individuals
before year 2001, 15 individuals in total), and saw
very little difference in the trend (R2 = .039, p = .006.
Coefficient: �0.285 (95% CI: �0.488 to �0.083),
SE = 0.103).
Fourth,
we
cannot
exclude
recall
biases. However, those whose ASD diagnoses had
been assigned after the parental interview still had a
similar
downward
trend
(coefficient:
�0.42,
p = .006). Finally, the number of clinically registered
cases of ASD was not very large and the confidence
intervals overlapped from 1 year to the next making
it difficult to draw definite conclusions. Nevertheless
the downward trend was evident, followed a consis-
tent pattern and was in line with our hypothesis, and
we therefore consider the results to be robust.
Conclusions
The results indicate that in clinical practice, fewer
symptoms/features of autism are now required for
an ASD diagnosis than was the case a decade or two
ago. Our results suggest that there is a need to
develop and work according to agreed comprehen-
sive diagnostic guidelines (Nice, 2011). This study
adds to existing knowledge by showing that a
decrease in the number of autism symptoms is
associated with an increase in the prevalence of
clinical ASD diagnoses in administrative registers.
Societal support for young people with disabilities
should not be offered solely on the basis of one
specific diagnosis but rather on the overall level of
dysfunction and suffering conferred by the (often
more complex) symptomatology, thereby removing
the incentive to assign a clinical ASD diagnosis in
order for children to gain access to support.

Key points
• The prevalence of autism has been reported to have increased worldwide. Numerous factors have been
suggested to account for this increase.
• This study examined whether the number of autism symptoms in children below age 13 and diagnosed with
autism had changed over a decade.
• The average number of autism symptoms in diagnosed individuals decreased substantially, with the most
effect (c. 50% decrease) seen in individuals diagnosed between ages 7–12.
• Fewer autism symptoms seemed to be required for an autism diagnosis. This may partly help explain the
observed increase in registered autism diagnoses.
