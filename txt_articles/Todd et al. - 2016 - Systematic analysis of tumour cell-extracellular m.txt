ABSTRACT
Tumour cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions are fundamental for 
discrete steps in breast cancer progression. In particular, cancer cell adhesion to 
ECM proteins present in the microenvironment is critical for accelerating tumour 
growth and facilitating metastatic spread. To assess the utility of tumour cell-ECM 
adhesion as a means for discovering prognostic factors in breast cancer survival, 
here we perform a systematic phenotypic screen and characterise the adhesion 
properties of a panel of human HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines across six ECM 
proteins commonly deregulated in breast cancer. We determine a gene expression 
signature that defines a subset of cell lines displaying impaired adhesion to laminin. 
Cells with impaired laminin adhesion showed an enrichment in genes associated with 
cell motility and molecular pathways linked to cytokine signalling and inflammation. 
Evaluation of this gene set in the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International 
Consortium (METABRIC) cohort of 1,964 patients identifies the F12 and STC2 genes 
as independent prognostic factors for overall survival in breast cancer. Our study 
demonstrates the potential of in vitro cell adhesion screens as a novel approach for 
identifying prognostic factors for disease outcome.
INTRODUCTION
The extracellular matrix (ECM) in the mammary 
gland microenvironment undergoes dynamic remodelling 
and is deregulated during breast cancer progression [1, 2]. 
By providing adhesive surfaces that promote adhesome 
complex formation and the activation of intracellular 
signalling [3, 4], ECM proteins have been shown to 
accelerate tumour progression and metastatic disease 
in breast cancer [5-8]. Degradation of the basement 
membrane (BM), which is primarily composed of ECM 
components collagen IV and laminin, is also required for 
cancer cell invasion into the surrounding blood vessels 
and lymphatics facilitating metastatic spread [9]. Given 
the important contributions of the ECM in breast cancer 
biology, protein expression levels of specific ECM 
components such as fibronectin and tenascin C are known 
prognostic markers for poor overall patient survival [10-
12]. More broadly, multiple studies demonstrate that 
gene expression signatures of the breast cancer stroma 
encompassing ECM proteins are more robust predictors 
of patient outcome than those of the tumour epithelial [13-
16]. 
While critical for promoting cancer progression, 
tumour cell-ECM interactions are challenging to study 
due to the dynamic remodelling of the matrisome in vivo 
[17], the wide array of ECM receptors expressed in cells 
[18] and the ability of these receptors to synergistically

interact in a complex non-intuitive fashion [19, 20]. 
The multi-factorial nature of these interactions is one 
reason why targeting ECM receptors, while conceptually 
attractive, has yet to translate into successful clinical 
candidates for cancer therapy [21]. To address some of 
these challenges, large-scale ECM arrays have been 
developed to examine tumour cell-ECM interactions in a 
systematic and combinatorial manner [20]. This has led to 
the characterisation of key adhesive changes associated 
with metastatic progression in a mouse model of lung 
adenocarcinoma and provided the first demonstration 
that in vitro cell adhesion screens can be employed as a 
means to identify clinically meaningful biomarkers such 
as galectin-3 for tumour, node and metastasis (TMN) 
staging [20]. 
The prognostic value of cancer cell adhesion 
has remained unexplored and we hypothesize that in 
addition to tumour staging, analysis of tumour cell-ECM 
interactions may reveal new prognostic factors for disease 
outcome. To investigate the relationship between tumour 
cell-ECM interactions and breast cancer survival, in this 
study we undertook an automated image-based phenotypic 
screen to assess tumour cell-ECM adhesion profiles in a 
panel of HER2-amplified (HER2+) breast cancer cell 
lines. We identified a gene expression signature that 
defines breast cancer cell lines with impaired adhesion 
to laminin and correlate these findings with a clinical 
dataset of 1,964 breast cancer cases to isolate genes that 
are prognostic for overall survival in patients. Our study 
demonstrates that cell adhesion screens have the potential 
to identify novel prognostic factors in breast cancer and 
is a general approach that can be readily extended to the 
study of other tumour types.
RESULTS
Analysis of tumour cell-ECM interactions 
reveals a subset of cell lines that display impaired 
adhesion to laminin
To systematically characterise tumour cell-ECM 
interactions in breast cancer, we utilised a panel of seven 
well-annotated HER2+ breast cancer cell lines [22, 23]. 
HER2 overexpression or amplification is present in ~20% 
of breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis 
and aggressive disease [24]. We employed automated 
image-based phenotypic screens to evaluate the manner 
in which HER2+ cells adhere to ECM molecules. 96-well

plates were pre-coated with six ECM components that 
are commonly deregulated in breast cancer (collagen I, 
collagen IV, fibronectin, hyaluronan, laminin, tenascin 
C) with uncoated plastic as a negative control [25]. Cells 
were subsequently seeded and screened for cell adhesion 
at 72 hours using DAPI as a nuclei stain (Figure 1). 
Mining the phenotypic dataset, we identified a subset 
of cell lines (AU565, HCC1954, SkBr3 and ZR75.30) 
that displayed significantly impaired cell adhesion when 
seeded on laminin (Figure 1A). The remaining three 
cell lines BT474, JIMT1 and UACC812 showed normal 
adhesion to laminin versus plastic. To demonstrate that 
the observed decrease in nuclei counts is not the result of 
reduced cell proliferation in response to ECM exposure, 
we assessed BrdU incorporation in the cell line panel 
on the 6 ECM substrates (Figure 1B). ECM substrates 
did not reduce cell proliferation across the panel of cell 
lines while increased proliferation was only found in the 
ZR75.30 cells when exposed to fibronectin and laminin. 
These data confirm that the observed decrease in nuclei 
count in AU565, HCC1954, SkBr3 and ZR75.30 cell lines 
is due to a reduction in cell adhesion on laminin rather 
than a decrease in proliferative rate. 
Combinations of collagens with laminin rescues 
SkBr3 cell adhesion
A previous unbiased screen of lung adenocarcinoma 
cell-ECM adhesion showed that distinct combinations 
of ECM substrates results in unanticipated additive,

synergistic or antagonistic effects on cell adhesion [20]. 
We sought to determine if similar effects were present in 
breast cancer, using the laminin adhesion impaired SkBr3 
cell line as a model. These cells were subjected to pair-
wise combinations of the 6 ECM substrates and plastic for 
72 hours prior to assessment for nuclei counts. This screen 
revealed that both collagen I and collagen IV were able to 
rescue the impaired tumour cell adhesion when combined 
with laminin (Figure 1C & 1D). Assessment of BrdU 
incorporation in the combination ECM format showed 
that there were no significant differences in proliferation 
across all laminin-ECM combinations, indicating that 
the observed rescue of cell adhesion in the presence of 
collagen was independent of cell proliferation (Figure 1E 
& 1F). 
Analysis of publically available transcriptional 
profiles of the seven cell lines finds that cell adhesion 
profiles on single ECMs had no correlation with the 
mRNA expression levels of their cognate laminin or 
collagen receptors such as the integrins (Table 1) [26, 
27]. The exception is the positive correlation between 
collagen IV and Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 (DDR1) 
(correlation coefficient R = 0.88, p = 0.01). It should be 
noted that the data in Table 1 reflects the gene expression

levels of these receptors at steady state in the breast 
cancer cell line panel and not in response to ECM 
exposure. Importantly we show by 2-way clustering of 
mRNA levels of the laminin-binding integrins that there 
is no obvious correlation between laminin adhesion and 
integrin mRNA levels (Supplemental Figure 1A). For 
instance, HCC1954 has high levels of laminin-binding 
integrin mRNA levels but displays impaired adhesion. In

addition, SkBr3 and BT474 are part of the same cluster 
despite displaying opposing laminin adhesion profiles. We 
have also performed a Student’s t-test analysis comparing 
the laminin-binding integrin levels of both groups of cell 
lines (impaired laminin adhesion and preserved laminin 
adhesion) and show that there is no statistical difference in 
the integrin gene expression levels between the two groups 
(Supplemental Table 1).
To validate the observations identified in the 
microarray analysis, we performed real-time quantitative 
PCR measurements (RT-qPCR) of the laminin-binding 
integrins. Correlation analysis with laminin adhesion 
(Supplemental Table 2), 2-way clustering (Supplemental 
Figure 1B) and Student’s t-test (Supplemental Table 1) of 
qPCR data confirms that there is no correlation between 
laminin adhesion and integrin mRNA levels. This data 
provides further evidence that gene expression levels of 
the integrins are not able to classify cells based on their

ability to bind laminin. This finding is consistent with the 
previous tumour cell-ECM screen by Reticker-Flynn et 
al., which showed that unlike protein level measurements, 
mRNA levels of adhesion receptors are poor predictors of 
cell-ECM interactions [20]. 
Identification of molecular pathways associated 
with impaired laminin adhesion
To identify molecular pathways associated with 
impaired laminin adhesion, we mined publically available 
gene expression data for the cell line panel from the 
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE) [28]. We first 
examined the ECM pathway genes that are annotated in 
the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
and found that these genes were not able to distinguish 
cell lines that had impaired laminin adhesion (Figure 2A). 
Given that the panel of cell lines is driven by the HER2 
tyrosine kinase and that the process of cell adhesion is 
propagated by kinase signalling networks [4], we sought to 
establish if RNA expression levels of kinases was capable 
of discriminating the two subsets of cells. An analysis of 
298 genes from the kinome showed that kinase profiles 
have no correlation with the impaired laminin adhesion 
that was observed in the phenotypic screen (Figure 2B). 
Unbiased analysis of the gene expression 
data revealed the top 50 genes, out of 21,009 genes 
incorporated into the analysis, that were positively and 
negatively correlated with impaired laminin adhesion in 
the cell line panel (Figure 3A). A selection of 15 genes 
from this signature was validated by RT-qPCR and 
show good concordance with the CCLE microarray data 
(Supplemental Table 3). Ontology analysis of genes that 
are upregulated in the cells with impaired laminin adhesion 
(AU565, HCC1954, SkBr3 and ZR75.30) using GSEA 
showed an enrichment of genes for cell motility (Figure 
3B). Additionally, there was an unexpected enrichment of

multiple gene sets associated with cytokine signalling and 
the inflammatory response. These included the cytokine 
pathway, NFκB induced, EPO NFκB pathway, Natural 
Killer (NK) cells pathway, Interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R), 
Interleukin-12 (IL12), Interleukin-10 (IL10), Interleukin-6 
(IL6) and Interleukin-3 (IL3) pathways (Figure 4B). 
This analysis suggests that cytokine signalling may play 
a role in the modulation of cancer cell adhesion. Other 
important and well-characterised oncogenic pathways that 
were found to be enriched included the Epidermal Growth 
Factor Receptor (EGFR), Sprouty (SPRY) and Hypoxia 
Inducible Factor (HIF) signalling pathways.
Impaired laminin adhesion identifies prognostic 
genes for breast cancer disease-specific survival
Given the important functional roles of laminin 
in breast cancer progression and metastasis [29], we 
hypothesised that genes enriched in the subset of cell lines 
with impaired laminin adhesion may have prognostic 
value for disease outcome. We focused on the top 50 genes 
that were either positively or negatively correlated with 
impaired laminin adhesion (Figure 3A). The METABRIC 
(Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International 
Consortium) study is a molecular and pathological 
characterisation of almost 2000 clinically annotated 
breast cancer specimens with long-term clinical follow-
up [30]. To examine these genes and their association 
with 10-year breast cancer disease-specific survival, we 
performed univariate Cox regression analysis on the 
100 genes correlated with impaired laminin adhesion 
in the METABRIC dataset. The optimal cut-off for 
dichotomizing each gene was selected using the discovery 
cohort (n = 985) and then tested in the independent 
validation cohort (n = 979). 
This analysis showed that the gene F12 is a 
prognostic factor (discovery cohort: hazard ratio HR 
= 1.65, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.23 - 2.21, p = 
8.0X10-4; validation cohort: HR = 1.58, CI = 1.19 - 2.12, 
p = 0.0017, Figure 4A) while the gene STC2 is a negative 
prognostic factor (discovery cohort: HR = 0.46, CI = 
0.34 - 0.61, p = 5.0X10-8; validation cohort: HR = 0.36, 
CI = 0.26 - 0.49, p = 5.6X10-11, Figure 4B) for overall 
survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis 
demonstrates that the prognostic value of these genes 
was independent of known prognostic variables of node 
status, size, grade, age, ER status and HER2 status in both 
cohorts (F12 discovery cohort: HR = 1.47, CI = 1.09 - 
1.97, p = 0.012; validation cohort: HR = 1.53, CI = 1.13 
- 2.08, p = 0.0064, STC2 discovery cohort: HR = 0.71, CI 
= 0.51 - 0.99, p = 0.043; validation cohort: HR = 0.51, CI 
= 0.35 - 0.75, p = 0.00056, Table 2). 
Combining F12 and STC2 stratified patients into 
4 subgroups (F12-high/STC2-low, F12-low/STC2-high, 
F12-high/STC2-high and F12-low/STC2-low) with F12-
low/STC2-high being associated with favourable outcome 
(10-year survival probability of 90.0% discovery, 90.3% 
validation) and F12-high/STC2-low patients having a 
much poorer prognosis (10-year survival probability 
of 68% discovery, 67.2% validation) (Figure 4C). F12 
expression levels were able to further stratify the STC2-
low group into 2 subgroups with significantly different 
outcomes (discovery cohort: HR = 1.45, CI = 1.03-2.05, 
p = 0.032; validation cohort: HR = 1.57, CI = 1.12 - 2.18, 
p = 0.0069) (Figure 4C). Despite the gene expression 
signature being derived from a HER2+ panel of cell lines, 
we found no subtype specificity for these two genes across 
HER2, Luminal A, Luminal B and Basal breast cancer 
subtypes in the METABRIC cohort (data not shown), 
indicating the general applicability of the in vitro cell 
adhesion phenotypic screen to discover prognostic factors 
independent of subtypes.
DISCUSSION
Cell-ECM adhesion is a fundamental process that is 
important in multiple hallmarks of breast cancer, including 
conferring a proliferative advantage, inducing pro-survival 
pathways and driving cell migration and invasion [31, 32]. 
In this study, we employed a tumour cell-ECM interaction 
screen to systematically assess the cell adhesion properties 
in a panel of breast cancer cell lines across six different 
ECM components. This led to the identification of a subset 
of cell lines which exhibit impaired adhesion to laminin. 
Laminin is a major component of the BM which acts as 
a physical barrier that is degraded to facilitate tumour 
invasion. Immunohistochemistry studies on primary 
and metastatic breast cancer specimens have found that 
laminin positivity itself has no prognostic significance for 
disease-free and overall survival [33-35]. We show that 
the F12 and STC2 genes derived from a gene expression 
signature of impaired laminin adhesion are independent 
prognostic factors for overall survival in breast cancer. 
Specifically, patients with the F12-high/STC2-low profile 
found in the cells with impaired laminin adhesion, had a 
poorer outcome compared to those with F12-low/STC2-
high gene expression. Cell migration is a key determinant 
of cancer cell dissemination and metastasis and it has 
been shown that increased cell adhesion to laminin 
inhibits breast cancer cell migration [36-40]. In keeping 
with this model, the ontology analysis performed in this 
study showed that there is an enrichment of genes for 
cell motility in breast cancer cells with impaired laminin 
adhesion. Given that our data demonstrates that patients 
with a F12-high/STC-low profile have a poorer outcome, 
a possible hypothesis is that poor breast cancer disease-
specific survival may be the result of reduced laminin 
adhesion and increased tumour cell migration, leading to 
elevated cancer cell dissemination from the primary site.
Despite our data demonstrating that cell lines 
with impaired laminin adhesion were enriched in genes

associated with cell motility, there was no correlation 
of laminin receptor mRNA expression levels with cell 
adhesion to laminin (Table 1). Laminins are a class of 
heterotrimeric proteins composed of α, β and γ chains 
which are predominantly found in the basement membrane 
that separates the breast epithelial from the stroma [41, 
42]. Breast cancer cells interact with laminins via the 
integrins which are heterodimeric receptors comprising 
an α and β subunit. Multiple integrins are known to bind 
to laminins including the α3β1, α6β1, α7β1 and α6β4 
receptors [27, 43]. The collagen binding α1β1, α2β1 and 
α10β1 integrins have also been shown to bind to laminins 
[27]. The binding of integrins to laminins triggers the 
formation of a multi-protein signalling complex called 
the adhesome [44]. This dynamic process is known as 
outside-in signalling and involves the recruitment of 
integrin-binding and actin-binding proteins as well as 
kinases [45]. Prominent pathways that are activated 
downstream of integrin binding are the FAK, PI3K, ERK 
and RhoA pathways which drive a range of pathological 
functions including tumour cell migration and invasion 
[46, 47]. Additionally, several studies report significant 
crosstalk between α6β1 and α6β4 integrins and HER2 
in breast cancer cell lines [48, 49]. Our data shows no 
correlation between integrin mRNA levels and laminin 
adhesion which is in agreement with previous reports 
indicating that steady state integrin RNA expression levels 
are poor predictors of the cell adhesion phenotype [20]. 
Given that cell adhesion is mediated by specific integrin 
heterodimers, it is likely that future assessment of cell 
surface levels of integrins as measured by flow cytometry 
will be more predictive of ECM-cell adhesion capacity in 
our assays [50]. 
STC2 encodes for the stanniocalcin 2 protein which 
is a glycoprotein hormone that is decreased in cell lines 
with impaired laminin adhesion. This protein was first 
identified in bony fish and has since been shown to be 
ubiquitously expressed in almost all mammalian tissues 
where it plays a role in the regulation of calcium and 
phosphate transport [51]. In agreement with the poorer 
outcome associated with low STC2 expression presented 
in this study, prior reports have shown that reduced 
stanniocalcin 2 expression promotes breast cancer cell 
proliferation, migration and invasion. Stanniocalcin 2 
expression is regulated by hormone signalling and an 
increase in stanniocalcin 2 expression levels leads to 
a reduction in breast cancer cell viability in vitro [52]. 
Overexpression of stanniocalcin 2 also suppressed breast 
cancer cell migration and inhibited tumorigenesis and 
metastasis in a xenograft model of breast cancer [53]. 
Consistent with our findings, in a previous study STC2 
levels were analysed in 110 breast cancer cases and found 
to be associated with favourable prognosis in hormone 
receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer patients treated 
with adjuvant hormone therapy [54]. Similarly, another 
study showed in a panel of 245 breast tumours that STC2 
positivity was prognostic for favourable disease-free 
survival [55]. Larger cohorts comprising defined stages 
and subtypes of breast cancer will be necessary to evaluate 
the prognostic potential of STC2, especially in the context 
of HR-positive breast cancer.
The F12 gene encodes for the plasma coagulation 
factor XII (FXII) which is a serine protease precursor that 
plays a role in the normal blood clotting process [56]. In 
addition to its role in blood clotting, FXII functions as 
a potent mitogen through the binding of the urokinase 
plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) [57-59]. This 
leads to the activation of both the ERK1/2 and AKT 
pathways which promotes cell proliferation [57, 60]. 
Interestingly blockade of integrins β1, α3 and α5 inhibited 
FXII induced signalling suggesting crosstalk between the 
uPAR and laminin and fibronectin receptor pathways [60, 
61]. It is still unclear if FXII is a bona fide cancer driver 
but it shares remarkable similarities with the activation 
of uPAR by urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), an 
important driver of epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
in breast cancer [62, 63]. To our knowledge, there have 
been no clinicopathological studies performed to evaluate 
the prognostic value of F12 and our study is the first to 
demonstrate a novel association between high F12 gene 
expression levels and unfavourable prognosis in breast 
cancer. Our findings are consistent with the function 
of FXII as a mitogen and warrants further study of its 
potential role as a candidate oncogene in breast cancer. 
Analysis of molecular pathways associated with 
impaired laminin adhesion shows an enrichment of gene 
sets for cytokine signalling and inflammation. Previous 
reports indicate that cytokines have the capacity to 
modulate ECM adhesion in immune cells [64-67]. For 
instance, pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IFNα and 
INFγ promote laminin adhesion while TGFβ1 had the 
opposing effect in microglial cells [65]. Adhesion of 
CD4+ T cells to laminin has been shown to increase in 
response to TNFα [66]. Pro- and anti-adhesive cytokine 
activities are less well studied in cancer cells. Treatment 
of colon carcinoma HT-29 cells with IL-4 and TNFα 
led to an increase in fibronectin adhesion in vitro with 
a corresponding decrease in lung colonizing potential in 
vivo [68]. In the MIA PaCa2 pancreatic cancer cell line, 
IL-1β reduced adhesion to laminin while IL-1α increased 
fibronectin adhesion but impaired collagen I adhesion 
[69]. In another study, both IL-1β and TNFα promoted 
MG-63 osteosarcoma cell adhesion on laminin [70]. Our 
data documents a strong association between cytokine 
signalling, inflammation and the regulation of laminin 
adhesion in breast cancer cells. In view of the increasing 
appreciation of the role of inflammation in driving breast 
cancer progression and the potential for immunotherapies 
in this disease [71], future experimental analysis of the 
impact of cytokines in modulating breast cancer cell 
adhesion will be required to establish if this is a major 
contributor to tumour development.

It should be noted that gene expression profiles 
from the METABRIC dataset are derived from clinical 
specimens composed of a heterogeneous population of 
different cell types, including tumour and stromal cells 
[72]. There may also be considerable intra-tumoural 
heterogeneity within tumour cell populations which is 
masked in population-level gene expression measurements 
[73]. In contrast, the expression profiles from the CCLE 
compendium are generated from breast cancer cell lines 
which are largely homogenous in nature. While we have 
shown that the F12/STC2 gene pair is an independent 
prognostic factor for breast cancer survival, given the 
heterogeneity inherent in clinical specimens we cannot 
exclude the possibility that alterations in F12 and STC2 
levels may be contributed in part by stromal cells. Future 
work using single-cell RNA-sequencing methods may 
shed light on the relative contributions of tumour versus 
stromal cells in breast cancer prognostication [74]. 
One limitation of our study is that all adhesion 
measurements were performed on ECM coated surfaces 
as opposed to 3-dimensional (3D) culture systems. It is 
recognised that cells embedded in 3D ECM cultures 
better simulate the tumour microenvironment in vivo by 
recapitulating features such as hypoxic gradients [75, 76]. 
There may be context-dependent signalling differences 
in 3D versus 2-dimensional (2D) cultures where cells in 
3D ECM conditions may be exposed to spatial cues and 
tensional forces necessary to trigger integrin bidirectional 
signalling [76]. Notwithstanding the limitations of the 
simplified experimental setup of ECM coated surfaces, 
our study demonstrates that novel prognostic factors 
can still be readily identified with this approach. We 
anticipate that the use of more physiologically relevant 
models such as 3D ECM cultures is likely to lead to 
the identification of additional independent adhesion-
associated prognosticators of breast cancer survival. 
In summary, we show for the first time that the 
systematic analysis of cell-ECM interactions has utility in 
defining new prognostic factors for breast cancer disease-
specific survival. Our study also sheds light on a potential 
role of cytokine signalling in the regulation of cancer cell 
adhesion. Future analysis in a larger panel of cell lines 
with additional ECM substrates will ascertain the general 
applicability of this approach in the detection of prognostic 
biomarkers in other cancer types. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Breast cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC 
(Manassas, VI, USA). BT474, SkBr3, UACC812 and 
JIMT1 were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s 
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine 
serum (FBS). ZR75.30, AU565 and HCC1954 were grown 
in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% foetal bovine 
serum. All cells were cultured in a 37°C incubator with 
5% CO2.
Extracellular matrix coating
Collagen I (rat tail; Sigma Aldrich) and collagen 
IV (from human placenta; Sigma Aldrich) were diluted to 
20ug/mL in 0.5M acetic acid, tenascin C (human purified; 
Millipore) was diluted to 5ug/mL in PBS, fibronectin 
(from human plasma; Millipore), laminin (mouse 
purified; Millipore) and hyaluronan (high molecular 
weight; R&D Systems) were diluted to 20ug/mL in PBS. 
Diluted coatings were applied to cover wells or flasks for 
2h at room temperature, then removed and washed with 
PBS. PBS was removed and cells were seeded in their 
appropriate media. 
For assays using pairwise ECM combinations, 
collagen I and collagen IV were diluted to 40ug/mL in 
0.5M acetic acid, tenascin C was diluted to 10ug/mL in 
PBS, and other ECM components were diluted to 40ug/
mL in PBS. These ECM dilutions were mixed 1:1 for 
each pairwise combination prior to plating. Additional 
concentration-matched single ECM controls were 
generated by further diluting single ECM components 1:1 
in PBS. 
Cell adhesion and proliferation assays
For 72 hour assays, cells were seeded at 2-5X103 per 
well (as appropriate per cell line) onto coated or uncoated 
96-well CellCarrier imaging plates (Perkin Elmer). 
Harvest was 72h post-treatment, and 8h (HCC1954, 
SkBr3, JIMT1, AU565) or 24h (BT474, ZR75.30, 
UACC812) prior to harvest, 10uM BrdU (Sigma Aldrich) 
was added to media. To harvest, cells were fixed in 4% 
formaldehyde for 15 minutes, then washed 2x with PBS 
and permeabilised with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 
minutes, washed 2x then blocked with 10% FBS in PBS. 
50uL primary anti-BrdU antibody (BU20a; Affymetrix) 
diluted 1:1000 and RQ1 DNAse (Promega) diluted 1:200 
in DNAse buffer (40mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10mM MgSO4, 
1mM CaCl2) was added to each well and incubated 
at 37°C for 3h. Wells were washed 2x TPBS, then 
secondary AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (Life 
Technologies) and Hoechst 33342 (Tocris) were added 
1:1000 and 1:2000 respectively in 10% FBS in PBS for 1h. 
Plates were washed 2x in TPBS, then plates were imaged 
on an Operetta high-content imager (Perkin Elmer) using a 
10x High NA lens. Images were analysed using Harmony 
software (Perkin Elmer), and BrdU positivity was defined 
as number of Hoechst-stained nuclei also showing 488 
stain positivity > 2 times background staining.

Gene expression analysis
We obtained the microarray gene expression data 
from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (GSE36133). 
These cell lines were profiled using Affymetrix HG-
U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Raw CEL files for these cell 
lines were normalized using Robust Multiarray Average 
(RMA) approach in Affymetrix Power Tools (APT). 
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software version 
2.2.2 from the Broad Institute [77] was used to identify 
genes and pathways enriched in cell lines with impaired 
laminin adhesion. Our input file contained expression data 
for 21,010 genes and 7 cell lines. We used 1000 gene set 
permutations for the analysis and pathways with nominal 
P values < 0.05 were considered significant. We used the 
522 pathways in the curated gene sets (C2.V1) collection 
from MSigDB. Gene sets with less than 10 genes were 
excluded from our analysis. GSEA software was also used 
to identify 50 genes with the strongest positive correlations 
and 50 genes with the strongest negative correlations 
to the impaired laminin adhesion phenotype. Statistical 
significance of gene correlations to the impaired laminin 
adhesion phenotype was determined using the Holm-
Sidak method which corrects for multiple comparisons 
using Graphpad Prism software. P < 0.05 was deemed 
significant. 
Gene expression data of 17,653 genes from the 
METABRIC study were profiled using Illumina HT-12 
v3 microarray. The top 50 genes that were positively and 
negatively correlated with impaired laminin adhesion 
in the cell line panel were subjected to further analysis. 
As outlined in the METABRIC study, the discovery and 
validation cohorts were defined by hospital sites, for 
further details of clinical specimens please refer to [30]. 
Survival analysis was performed with breast-cancer-
specific 10-year survival data. The Kaplan-Meier estimator 
was used, and the log-rank test was performed to test 
differences among groups. For univariate and multivariate 
analysis, the Cox proportional hazards regression model 
was fitted, and 95% confidence intervals computed to 
determine prognostic values; log-rank test p < 0.05 was 
considered significant. In the discovery set, a search for 
optimal threshold for dichotomizing gene expression 
data was carried out by searching stepwise from 40 to 60 
percentiles at an interval of 5. The cut-offs that displayed 
the highest prognostic significance with log-rank test were 
selected and used for the validation cohort. Multivariate 
survival analysis was carried out in both patient cohorts 
using gene expression data, node status, ER status, HER2 
status, age, tumour size and grade.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cell lines 
using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies), treated with 
DNase I (Promega) and reverse transcribed into cDNA 
with SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis kit (Life 
Technologies). qPCR was carried out using SYBR green 
PCR master mix (Life Technologies) on an Applied 
Biosystems 7900HT instrument. Data were normalized 
against β-actin levels and analysed using Applied 
Biosystems RQ manager software. The gene-specific 
primers used are listed in Supplemental Table 4.
