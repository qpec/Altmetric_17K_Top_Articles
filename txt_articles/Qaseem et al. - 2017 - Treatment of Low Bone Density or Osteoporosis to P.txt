 Treatment of Low Bone Density or Osteoporosis to Prevent Fractures in
Men and Women: A Clinical Practice Guideline Update From the
American College of Physicians
Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA; Mary Ann Forciea, MD; Robert M. McLean, MD; and Thomas D. Denberg, MD, PhD; for the Clinical
Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians*
Description: This guideline updates the 2008 American Col-
lege of Physicians (ACP) recommendations on treatment of low
bone density and osteoporosis to prevent fractures in men and
women. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of
Family Physicians.
Methods: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these
recommendations on a systematic review of randomized con-
trolled trials; systematic reviews; large observational studies (for
adverse events); and case reports (for rare events) that were pub-
lished between 2 January 2005 and 3 June 2011. The review was
updated to July 2016 by using a machine-learning method, and
a limited update to October 2016 was done. Clinical outcomes
evaluated were fractures and adverse events. This guideline fo-
cuses on the comparative benefits and risks of short- and long-
term pharmacologic treatments for low bone density, including
pharmaceutical prescriptions, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen.
Evidence was graded according to the GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
system.
Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audi-
ence for this guideline includes all clinicians. The target patient
population includes men and women with low bone density and
osteoporosis.
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians offer
pharmacologic treatment with alendronate, risedronate, zole-
dronic acid, or denosumab to reduce the risk for hip and verte-
bral fractures in women who have known osteoporosis. (Grade:
strong recommendation; high-quality evidence)
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians treat os-
teoporotic women with pharmacologic therapy for 5 years.
(Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence)
Recommendation 3: ACP recommends that clinicians offer
pharmacologic treatment with bisphosphonates to reduce the
risk for vertebral fracture in men who have clinically recog-
nized osteoporosis. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality
evidence)
Recommendation 4: ACP recommends against bone density
monitoring during the 5-year pharmacologic treatment period for
osteoporosis in women. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-
quality evidence)
Recommendation 5: ACP recommends against using meno-
pausal estrogen therapy or menopausal estrogen plus progesto-
gen therapy or raloxifene for the treatment of osteoporosis
in women. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality
evidence)
Recommendation 6: ACP recommends that clinicians should
make the decision whether to treat osteopenic women 65 years
of age or older who are at a high risk for fracture based on a
discussion of patient preferences, fracture risk profile, and bene-
fits, harms, and costs of medications. (Grade: weak recommenda-
tion; low-quality evidence)

O
steoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease charac-
terized by decreasing bone mass and microarchi-
tectural deterioration of bone tissue that leads to an
increased risk for bone fragility and fracture (1). Al-
though osteoporosis can be present in any bone, the
hip, spine, and wrist are most likely to be affected. Os-
teoporosis is found in an estimated 200 million people
worldwide (2), and an estimated 54 million men and
women in the United States have osteoporosis or low
bone density (3). Approximately 50% of Americans
older than 50 years are at risk for osteoporotic fracture
(4). The economic impact of osteoporosis on the health
care system is estimated to be $25.3 billion per year by
2025 (3).

 Risk factors for osteoporotic fracture include (but
are not limited to) increasing age, female sex, post-
menopause for women, hypogonadism or premature
ovarian failure, low body weight, history of parental
hip fracture, ethnic background (white persons are at
higher risk than black persons), previous clinical or
morphometric vertebral fracture, previous fracture due
to minimal trauma (that is, previous osteoporotic frac-
ture), rheumatoid arthritis, current smoking, alcohol in-
take (3 or more drinks daily), low bone mineral density
(BMD), vitamin D deficiency, low calcium intake, hyper-
kyphosis, falling, and immobilization (5). Another risk
factor for osteoporotic fracture is long-term use of cer-
tain medications, the most commonly implicated being
glucocorticoids, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, aro-
matase inhibitors, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, and
gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (5).
Osteoporosis can be diagnosed by the occurrence
of fragility fracture. In patients without fragility fracture,
osteoporosis is often diagnosed by low BMD. Dual-
energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the current gold
standard test for diagnosing osteoporosis in people
without an osteoporotic fracture. Results of DXA are
scored as SDs from a young, healthy norm (usually fe-
male) and reported as T scores. For example, a T score
of –2 indicates a BMD that is 2 SDs below the compar-
ative norm. The international reference standard for the
description of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women
and in men aged 50 years or older is a femoral neck
BMD of 2.5 SD or more below the young female adult
mean (2). Low BMD as measured by DXA is an imper-
fect predictor of fracture risk, identifying less than one
half of the people who go on to have an osteoporotic
fracture.
Bone density can also be classified according to
the Z score, the number of SD above or below the ex-
pected BMD for the patient's age and sex. A Z score of
–2.0 or lower is defined as either “low BMD for chrono-
logical age” or “below the expected range for age,”
and those above –2.0 are “within the expected range
for age” (6). Risk scores that combine clinical risk factors
with BMD testing results, such as FRAX (the World
Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool),
can be used to predict fracture risk among people with
low bone density.
Pharmacologic treatments for osteoporosis include
bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, ibandro-
nate, zoledronic acid), peptide hormones (teriparatide
[the 1,3,4 amino acid fragment of parathyroid hor-
mone] and calcitonin), estrogen (in the form of meno-
pausal hormone therapy) for postmenopausal women,
and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
(raloxifene for postmenopausal women). Most of the
treatments aim to prevent bone resorption. Deno-
sumab (a new biologic agent), dietary and supplemen-
tal calcium, and vitamin D are also used for treatment.
Bazedoxifene, a SERM, has recently been approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with con-
jugated estrogen for prevention of osteoporosis.
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGET POPULATION
This updated guideline presents additional avail-
able evidence on treatments, including new medica-
tions and biologic agents, to prevent fractures in men
and women with low bone density or osteoporosis
since publication of the ACP 2008 guideline, and re-
places the 2008 guideline (7). Several therapies in-
cluded in the 2008 guideline have been excluded from
the update, including calcitonin, which is no longer
widely used for osteoporosis treatment, and both
etidronate and pamidronate, neither of which are FDA-
approved for the prevention of fractures or treatment
of osteoporosis. One new biologic, denosumab, a hu-
man monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for
treatment of osteoporosis, has been added since pub-
lication of the 2008 guideline. Different medications for
the treatment of osteoporosis may affect various parts
of the skeletal system differently. The target audience
for this guideline includes all clinicians and the target
patient population includes men and women with low
bone density and osteoporosis. These recommenda-
tions are based on a systematic evidence review spon-
sored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-
ity (AHRQ) (6, 8). This guideline is endorsed by the
American Academy of Family Physicians.
METHODS
Systematic Review of the Evidence
The evidence review was conducted by AHRQ's
Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center–
RAND Corporation. Appendix 1 (available at Annals
.org) summarizes the methods for the evidence review,
and additional details can be found in the reports (6, 8).
Reviewers searched databases from 2 January
2005 to 3 June 2011. A machine-learning method was
used to update the searches, once in 2014 and then
specifically on bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D,
and estrogen through 12 July 2016 (9). Appendix 2
(available at Annals.org) shows the search methodol-
ogy for the update. Reviewers also did a limited search
on the recently FDA-approved drug bazedoxifene from
1 January 2013 to 26 October 2016. Evidence tables
for studies identified in the 2016 update search are

Grading the Evidence and Developing
Recommendations
This guideline was developed by ACP's Clinical
Guidelines
Committee
(CGC)
according
to
ACP's
guideline development process, details of which can
be found in ACP's methods paper (10). The CGC used
the evidence tables in the accompanying systematic re-
view (8), full report (6), and update when reporting the
evidence and graded the recommendations by using
the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assess-
ment,
Development
and
Evaluation)
methodology
(Table 1).
Peer Review
The AHRQ systematic review was peer-reviewed
and posted on the AHRQ Web site for public com-
ments. The 2014 evidence review was also peer-
reviewed through the journal. The guideline was peer-
reviewed through the journal and posted online for
comments from ACP Regents and ACP Governors, who
represent physician members at the national and inter-
national level.
COMPARATIVE BENEFITS OF TREATMENT
VERSUS PLACEBO FOR REDUCING FRACTURES
IN PATIENTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS
Bisphosphonates
High-quality evidence showed that bisphospho-
nates, including alendronate (11–42-43–45), risedro-
nate (34–36, 42, 46–77-78), and zoledronic acid (79–
85), reduce vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures
compared with placebo in postmenopausal osteopo-
rotic women. High-quality evidence also showed that
ibandronate reduces the risk for radiographic vertebral
fractures, although evidence is insufficient to determine
the effect of ibandronate on hip fractures (38, 86–94).
Moderate-quality evidence showed that zoledronic
acid reduces radiographic vertebral fractures in osteo-
porotic men (95).
Denosumab
High-quality evidence showed that treatment with
denosumab reduces radiographic vertebral, nonverte-
bral, and hip fractures compared with placebo in post-
menopausal osteoporotic women (96–108). One Japa-
nese trial and its 1-year open-label extension study
included postmenopausal osteoporotic women with
prevalent radiographic vertebral fractures and showed
that denosumab protected against radiographic verte-
bral fractures (101, 109).
Teriparatide
High-quality evidence showed that treatment with
teriparatide reduces radiographic vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures compared with placebo in post-
menopausal osteoporotic women (34, 110–120).
SERMs
High-quality evidence showed that raloxifene re-
duces vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women; how-
ever, it did not statistically significantly decrease the risk
for nonvertebral or hip fractures compared with pla-
cebo (34, 121–127).
Bazedoxifene is FDA-approved in combination with
conjugated estrogens for the prevention of osteoporo-
sis (20 mg, with 0.45 mg conjugated estrogen). The
systematic review did not find any randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) with this combination that had pri-
mary fracture outcomes.
Estrogen Therapy for Postmenopausal Women
Moderate-quality evidence showed no difference
in reduced fracture with estrogen treatment in post-
menopausal women with established osteoporosis (40,
41, 123, 128–130). This differs from the 2008 guideline,
which reported high-quality evidence that estrogen
therapy was associated with reduced risk for vertebral,
nonvertebral, and hip fractures in postmenopausal
women (7, 131). Studies included in the 2008 guideline
focused on postmenopausal women or those with low
bone density as opposed to the newer data, which fo-
cused on postmenopausal women with established
osteoporosis.
Calcium or Vitamin D
Moderate-quality evidence showed that the overall
effect of calcium or vitamin D alone on fracture risk is
uncertain. Studies showed no difference between cal-
cium alone and placebo for reduced vertebral and non-
vertebral fracture risk (132–157), although adherence
was low. Data on the efficacy of vitamin D alone for
reducing fracture risk are mixed, and the overall effect
is uncertain (34, 129, 134–139, 142–144, 146, 148, 149,
152, 158–189-190–209).
Physical Activity
Evidence is insufficient to conclusively show the ef-
fect of physical activity on fracture risk (210–218). There
are no studies that evaluated the comparative effective-
ness of physical activity with that of other interventions.
COMPARATIVE BENEFITS OF TREATMENT
WITHIN AND AMONG CLASSES FOR REDUCING
FRACTURES IN PATIENTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS
Evidence is insufficient to determine the compara-
tive effectiveness of pharmacologic therapy or the su-
periority of one medication over another, within the
same class or among classes, for prevention of frac-
tures (21, 29, 40–42, 123, 129, 130, 139, 149, 156, 175,
199, 201, 208, 219–234). Network meta-analyses ad-
dressing the lack of head-to-head comparisons be-
tween the drugs mostly show no statistically significant
differences among the various therapies (235–239).

 BENEFITS OF TREATMENT FOR FRACTURE RISK
REDUCTION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH DIFFERENT
FRACTURE RISKS
Bone Mineral Density
Moderate-quality evidence from post hoc analysis
of 1 RCT showed that low femoral neck BMD did not
predict the effect of alendronate on clinical vertebral or
nonvertebral fracture risk (240).
FRAX Risk Assessment
Moderate-quality evidence from post hoc analysis
of 1 RCT showed no significant interaction between
fracture risk as assessed by FRAX and the efficacy of
raloxifene for reducing the relative risk for vertebral
fractures in women older than 75 years (241).
Prior Fractures (Prevention vs. Treatment)
Evidence is insufficient for prevalent fractures to
predict the efficacy of alendronate or raloxifene treat-
ment in reducing risk for fractures in postmenopausal
women, because studies reported conflicting results
(240, 242–244). Moderate-quality evidence from post
hoc analysis of 1 RCT showed that postmenopausal
women with prevalent vertebral fractures benefited
more from teriparatide treatment than those without
prevalent fractures (245).
Age
High-quality evidence showed that bisphospho-
nates and teriparatide are at least as effective for older
patients as they are for younger patients (246–249).
Sex
Evidence is insufficient regarding the effectiveness
of therapies to prevent fractures or treat osteoporosis
in men, because few relevant studies have been pub-
lished (28, 50–52, 82, 90, 136, 157, 166). Two RCTs
evaluated vitamin D treatment in men and women and
reported on fractures (136, 166). One study showed
that calcium plus vitamin D3 reduced the risk for frac-
ture among elderly women but not elderly men (136).
The other study showed no difference in fracture re-
duction for elderly men treated with intramuscular in-
jection of ergocalciferol, whereas women had in-
creased risk for wrist fractures (166).
Race/Ethnicity
High-quality evidence from post hoc analysis of 2
RCTs showed that compared with placebo, raloxifene
decreases the relative risk for vertebral fracture but not
nonvertebral or hip fracture among Asian women (250),
consistent with findings from U.S. studies.
Glucocorticoid Treatment
Moderate-quality evidence showed that alendro-
nate, risedronate, and teriparatide reduced fracture risk
in patients taking glucocorticoids (30, 219).
Renal Insufficiency
Evidence is insufficient from trials assessing the ef-
fect of renal function on the efficacy of alendronate,
raloxifene, and teriparatide in preventing fractures in
osteoporotic women (251–254).
HARMS OF PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT FOR
REDUCING FRACTURES
Bisphosphonates
Low-quality evidence showed that bisphospho-
nates are associated with atypical subtrochanteric frac-
tures, and the FDA has issued a warning for these
drugs (255). Evidence suggests that this adverse event
may be related to treatment duration, because the rate
of atypical fractures for women taking bisphosphonates
for less than 2 years was 1.78 per 100 000 and in-
creased to over 100 per 100 000 in women taking the
drugs for 8 years or more (256).
Low-quality evidence also showed that bisphos-
phonates are associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw,
although this side effect is rare (257–282).
The 2008 guideline reported that bisphosphonates
may be associated with atrial fibrillation; however, most
new evidence suggests that there is no increased risk
(126, 283–288). A recent post hoc double-blind exten-
sion of the HORIZON-PFT trial found no difference in
atrial fibrillation with 9 years versus 6 years of treatment
with zoledronic acid in osteoporotic postmenopausal
women, although women treated for 9 years had a
higher incidence of any arrhythmia (14.1% vs. 4.2%; P =
0.02) (85). One study showed that bisphosphonates
were associated with increased risk for incident acute
myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR], 1.38 [95% CI,
1.08 to 1.77], after cardiovascular disease risk factors
were controlled for) after a median 3.6 years of
follow-up (289). A population-based cohort study also
showed that bisphosphonates were associated with in-
creased risk for cardiovascular events, including atrial
fibrillation (adjusted HR, 1.55 [CI, 1.04 to 2.39]) and
congestive heart failure (adjusted HR, 1.65 [CI, 1.36 to
1.99]) (290). In contrast, a recent meta-analysis con-
cluded that there is no significant association between
oral or intravenous bisphosphonate use and total car-
diovascular events, stroke, myocardial infarction, or car-
diovascular death (287).
High-quality evidence showed that bisphospho-
nates are associated with mild upper gastrointestinal
symptoms (83, 291–303), and a network meta-analysis
did not show statistically significant differences be-
tween the various bisphosphonates for gastrointestinal
symptoms (304).
High-quality evidence showed that zoledronic acid
is associated with hypocalcemia (odds ratio [OR], 7.22
[CI, 1.81 to 42.7]) (81, 305). High-quality evidence also
showed
that
zoledronic
acid
is
associated
with
influenza-like symptoms (OR, 6.39 [CI, 5.76 to 7.09])
(79, 81, 82, 306–308). A recent secondary analysis of a
double-blind RCT showed an increased incidence of
uveitis (1.1% [CI, 0.5% to 2.1%]) and episcleritis (0.1%
[CI, 0.0% to 0.7%]) in women treated with zoledronic
acid (309).
Ibandronate is associated with myalgias, cramps,
and limb pain (OR, 2.25 [CI, 1.57 to 3.29]) (92, 310), and
zoledronic acid is associated with adverse effects in-
cluding atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.45 [CI, 1.14 to 1.86])
(81), arthritis and arthralgias (OR, 2.82 [CI, 2.32 to

 3.45]), headaches (OR, 3.18 [CI, 2.57 to 3.97]), and uve-
itis (OR, 12.1 [CI, 1.78 to 516]).
Evidence is insufficient to associate bisphospho-
nates with increased cancer risk, because studies re-
port conflicting results (292, 311–326).
Denosumab
High-quality evidence showed that denosumab is
associated with mild upper gastrointestinal symptoms
(OR, 1.74 [CI, 1.29 to 2.38]) (43, 327). Moderate-quality
evidence showed that denosumab is associated with
increased risk for infection (risk ratio [RR], 1.26 [CI, 1.01
to 1.57]) (328). One small RCT reported a slight in-
crease in bacterial cellulitis with patients treated with
denosumab compared with placebo (1.3% vs. 0.6%),
but no increase in serious infection (1.1% vs. 1.5%)
(109). Denosumab has also been associated with rash/
eczema (OR, 1.96 [CI, 1.46 to 2.66]) (43, 96, 97). A post
hoc analysis of the open-label extension of FREEDOM
(Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Os-
teoporosis every 6 Months) confirmed 2 events of atyp-
ical femoral fracture and 8 events of osteonecrosis of
the jaw through 8 years of denosumab therapy (100).
Teriparatide
High-quality evidence showed that teriparatide is
associated with mild upper gastrointestinal symptoms
(OR, 3.26 [CI, 2.82 to 3.78]) (113, 117, 329, 330), head-
ache (OR, 1.46 [CI, 1.27 to 1.69]) (113, 117, 331), and
hypercalcemia (OR, 12.9 [CI, 10.5 to 16]) (116, 117,
331, 332). Other adverse effects include renal side ef-
fects (OR, 2.36 [CI, 2.01 to 2.77]) and hypercalciuria
(OR, 2.44 [CI, 2.08 to 2.86]) (254). There were no inci-
dent cases of osteosarcoma associated with use of this
medication in the first 4 years of the voluntary Forteo
Patient Registry safety study (333), and in a postmarket-
ing case series study encompassing 9 years of osteo-
sarcoma cases, no patient reported use of teriparatide
before diagnosis of osteosarcoma (334).
SERMs
High-quality evidence showed that raloxifene is as-
sociated with hot flashes (OR, 1.58 [CI, 1.35 to 1.84])
(122, 123, 335–340) and thromboembolic events (OR,
1.63 [CI, 1.36 to 1.98]) (122, 336, 341–346). Raloxifene
is also associated with pulmonary embolism (OR, 1.82
[CI, 1.16 to 2.92) (122, 341, 345, 347) and cerebrovas-
cular death (OR, 1.56 [CI, 1.04 to 2.39]) (122, 341, 342,
348–350). A study comparing postmarketing surveil-
lance of raloxifene in younger women (aged <75 y) ver-
sus older women (aged ≥75 y) showed no difference in
overall adverse effects from raloxifene (351).
Estrogen Therapy for Postmenopausal Women
High-quality evidence from the Women's Health
Initiative showed that menopausal hormone therapy
was associated with increased risk for cerebrovascular
accidents and venous thromboembolic events (7, 352).
One subsequent assessment of the trial showed that
the higher incidence of breast cancer decreased after
therapy was discontinued (353). Another study showed
that estrogen plus progestin therapy was associated
with more invasive breast cancer, more node-positive
tumors, and more deaths due to breast cancer than
placebo (354).
Calcium and Vitamin D
Although previous data suggested an association
between calcium supplementation and increased risk
for myocardial infarction, moderate-quality evidence
shows no association (355). One study showed in-
creased risk for hypercalciuria with vitamin D supple-
mentation (356).
MONITORING OF PATIENTS WITH
OSTEOPOROSIS
There is no evidence from RCTs regarding how of-
ten to monitor BMD during osteoporosis treatment.
Moderate-quality evidence suggests that most women
do not need regular monitoring (357–368). Data from 1
study (365) showed that only 10% of women with nor-
mal or mildly osteopenic DXA scores (T score > –1.49)
develop osteoporosis within 15 years; 10% of women
with moderate osteopenia (T score, –1.50 to –1.99) de-
velop osteoporosis within 5 years; and 10% of women
with advanced osteopenia (T score, –2.0 to –2.49) de-
velop
osteoporosis
within
1
year.
Another
study
showed no improvement in prediction of hip or major
fractures in women who had BMD measured 4 years
after baseline (357). Overall data from several studies
(358–363) showed that women treated with bisphos-
phonates, raloxifene, and teriparatide benefited from
reduced fractures with treatment even if BMD did not
increase.
DURATION OF PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY
Low-quality evidence showed that the appropriate
duration of treatment is uncertain, although high-risk
patients may benefit from more than 5 years of treat-
ment (240, 242, 369–371). One study showed no cumu-
lative difference in the risk for nonvertebral fractures in
women continuing alendronate therapy for 5 versus 10
years (18.9% vs. 19%) (240). Post hoc analysis of this
study showed that women with femoral neck T scores
of –2.5 or worse without baseline prevalent vertebral
fracture had reduced fracture risk by continuing alen-
dronate therapy for 10 years versus stopping after 5
years compared with placebo (11.1% to 5.3%) (242).
Another study on zoledronic acid showed no difference
for clinical vertebral fractures, hip fractures, nonverte-
bral fractures, or all clinical fractures in women who

FUTURE RESEARCH
Most of the evidence for treating osteoporotic men
is based on trials that included women, and further
research is needed on the treatment of men. Studies
directly
addressing
the
efficacy
of
pharmacologic
treatments for reducing fractures in patients with os-
teopenia are also needed.

Recommendations
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians offer pharmacologic treatment with alendronate, risedronate, 
zoledronic acid, or denosumab to reduce the risk for hip and vertebral fractures in women who have known osteoporosis.
(Grade: strong recommendation; high-quality evidence)
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians treat osteoporotic women with pharmacologic therapy for 5 years.
(Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence)
Recommendation 3: ACP recommends that clinicians offer pharmacologic treatment with bisphosphonates to reduce the
risk for vertebral fracture in men who have clinically recognized osteoporosis. (Grade: weak recommendation; 
low-quality evidence)
Recommendation 4: ACP recommends against bone density monitoring during the 5-year pharmacologic treatment 
period for osteoporosis in women. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence)
Recommendation 5: ACP recommends against using menopausal estrogen therapy or menopausal estrogen plus 
progestogen therapy or raloxifene for the treatment of osteoporosis in women. (Grade: strong recommendation; 
moderate-quality evidence)
Recommendation 6: ACP recommends that clinicians should make the decision whether to treat 
osteopenic women 65 years of age or older who are at a high risk for fracture based on a discussion of
patient preferences, fracture risk profile, and benefits, harms, and costs of medications. (Grade: weak 
recommendation; low-quality evidence)
Inconclusive Areas of Evidence
High-Value Care
Clinical Considerations
Comparative effectiveness of the different treatments is unknown.
Treatment duration is unknown, although high-risk patients may benefit from longer treatments.
Comparative effectiveness trials evaluating pharmacologic treatments for low bone density or osteoporosis
are lacking. In addition, although FRAX scores are widely used, there is a lack of evidence linking FRAX 
scores to treatment efficacy. 
The current evidence does not support frequent monitoring of women with normal BMD for osteoporosis,
because data showed that most women with normal DXA scores did not progress to osteoporosis within 15
years. Data also does not support monitoring BMD during the initial 5 years of treatment in patients taking
pharmacologic agents to treat osteoporosis. Clinicians should select generic drugs to treat osteoporotic 
patients when possible.
BMD = bone mineral density; DXA = dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; FRAX = World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool; GI =

 RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clini-
cians offer pharmacologic treatment with alendronate,
risedronate, zoledronic acid, or denosumab to reduce
the risk for hip and vertebral fractures in women who
have known osteoporosis. (Grade: strong recommenda-
tion; high-quality evidence)
High-quality evidence showed that pharmacologic
treatment in postmenopausal women who have osteo-
porosis (T scores ≤ –2.5 or those who have experienced
fragility fractures) is beneficial for preventing further
bone loss and reducing the risk for initial or subsequent
fractures. Some bisphosphonates (alendronate, rise-
dronate, and zoledronic acid) and the newer biologic
agent denosumab reduce radiographic vertebral as
well as clinical, nonvertebral, and hip fractures.
Both bisphosphonates and denosumab are associ-
ated with mild gastrointestinal symptoms. Denosumab
is also associated with increased risk for infection and
rash or eczema. Bisphosphonates are associated with
atypical subtrochanteric fractures and osteonecrosis of
the jaw. Although there is no association between bis-
phosphonates and atrial fibrillation, some studies have
reported increased cardiovascular events. Zoledronic
acid is associated with hypocalcemia, influenza-like
symptoms, arthritis and arthralgias, headache, and
uveitis.
When
prescribing
bisphosphonates,
clinicians
should discuss the importance of adherence. Factors
associated with poor adherence include side effects
and the inconvenience of taking medications, absence
of symptoms for underlying disease, comorbid condi-
tions, age, and socioeconomic status.
Although evidence showed that raloxifene and
ibandronate reduce radiographic vertebral fractures,
and teriparatide reduces vertebral and nonvertebral
fractures, studies have shown no benefit for these
drugs to reduce all fracture types; therefore, they are
not recommended as a first-line pharmacologic treat-
ment. Raloxifene is associated with serious harms, such
as thromboembolism. Calcitonin, which is no longer
widely used for osteoporosis treatment, was not con-
sidered in this guideline.
Calcium and vitamin D may be added as dietary
supplements to osteoporosis treatment regimens, al-
though the effectiveness of these regimens on fracture
prevention is unclear. The majority of trials with bispho-
sphonate therapy gave women calcium supplements
and many also gave vitamin D; therefore, supplemen-
tation with these agents may be considered. However,
dosages should be carefully considered, because ex-
cess dosing has been associated with hypercalcemia
(221, 372–377). Moderate-quality evidence showed no
association between calcium supplementation and in-
creased risk for myocardial infarction (355), but a large
trial demonstrated an increase in kidney stones (137).
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clini-
cians treat osteoporotic women with pharmacologic
therapy for 5 years. (Grade: weak recommendation;
low-quality evidence)
Although the direct evidence is insufficient to de-
termine the appropriate duration of pharmacologic
therapy, most studies that evaluated the benefit of
treatment continued therapy for up to 5 years. Continu-
ing treatment after the initial 5 years may be beneficial
for some patients and may be appropriate after reas-
sessing the risks and benefits of continuing therapy.
Post hoc analysis from an RCT (242) suggested that pa-
tients treated with alendronate without preexisting frac-
tures and a BMD of –2.5 or less after 5 years of initial
therapy may benefit from continued treatment, be-
cause these patients experienced a decreased inci-
dence of new clinical vertebral fractures.
Recommendation 3: ACP recommends that clini-
cians offer pharmacologic treatment with bisphospho-
nates to reduce the risk for vertebral fracture in men
who have clinically recognized osteoporosis. (Grade:
weak recommendation; low-quality evidence)
Data that specifically apply to men are sparse.
However, no evidence suggests that outcomes associ-
ated with pharmacologic treatment would differ be-
tween men and women if based on similar BMDs. Data
for men are extrapolated from studies that included
women with T scores of –2.5 or less or those who have
experienced fragility fractures. Moderate-quality evi-
dence from 1 study that detected fractures radiograph-
ically showed that zoledronic acid reduced vertebral
fractures in osteoporotic men (95). In women, some bi-
sphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, and zole-
dronic acid) reduce vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip
fractures. The overall quality of evidence was down-
graded to low owing to indirectness. Bisphosphonates
are associated with adverse effects, including mild gas-
trointestinal symptoms, atypical subtrochanteric frac-
tures, and osteonecrosis of the jaw.
Recommendation
4:
ACP
recommends
against
bone density monitoring during the 5-year pharmaco-
logic treatment period for osteoporosis in women.
(Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence)
Current evidence does not show any benefit for
bone density monitoring during treatment. Moderate-
quality evidence showed that women treated with
antiresorptive treatment (including bisphosphonates,
raloxifene, and teriparatide) benefited from reduced
fractures with treatment, even if there was no increase
in BMD or if BMD decreased. There was no evidence
for BMD monitoring for men.
Recommendation 5: ACP recommends against us-
ing menopausal estrogen therapy or menopausal estro-
gen plus progestogen therapy or raloxifene for the
treatment of osteoporosis in women. (Grade: strong
recommendation; moderate-quality evidence)
Moderate-quality evidence showed that meno-
pausal estrogen treatment did not reduce fracture risk
in postmenopausal women with established osteopo-
rosis. Evidence from a previous systematic review (131)
showed that estrogen decreased fracture risk; how-
ever, many of these studies focused on postmeno-
pausal women with low bone density, or on postmeno-
pausal women in general rather than those with
established osteoporosis. Estrogen treatment is associ-

 ated with serious harms, such as increased risk for cere-
brovascular accidents and venous thromboembolism,
and these harms significantly outweigh the potential
benefits. Although raloxifene has some benefit in re-
ducing vertebral fractures, it does not reduce hip frac-
ture or nonvertebral fractures and is associated with
serious harms, including thromboembolism.
Recommendation 6: ACP recommends that clini-
cians should make the decision whether to treat os-
teopenic women 65 years of age or older who are at a
high risk for fracture based on a discussion of patient
preferences, fracture risk profile, and benefits, harms,
and costs of medications. (Grade: weak recommenda-
tion; low-quality evidence)
Low-quality evidence showed that treatment with
risedronate in women with osteopenia (defined as a T
score of –1.0 to –2.5) near the osteoporosis threshold (T
score of –2.5) may reduce their fracture risk. This evi-
dence comes from a post hoc analysis of 2-year
follow-up data from 4 large RCTs of postmenopausal
women with advanced osteopenia and no prevalent
vertebral fractures that showed that treatment with rise-
dronate significantly reduced the risk for fragility frac-
ture compared with placebo (73% lower than placebo)
(378). This effect is similar to fracture reductions seen in
women with osteoporosis undergoing the similar treat-
ment. Duration of treatment in these studies was 1.5 to
3 years.
Although the current evidence is limited to a post
hoc evaluation of risedronate in women with advanced
osteopenia, the CGC believes that the benefit of frac-
ture reduction is likely to be similar across all bisphos-
phonates, on the basis of data in osteoporotic women.
However, the efficacy of other bisphosphonates has

 not been directly evaluated in osteopenic women,
and no study has been conducted to primarily assess
the effects of fracture prevention in women with
osteopenia.
The rate of progressive bone loss and the risk for
fracture range widely across the osteopenic spectrum
and according to additional factors, such as age. The
risk for severe adverse effects increases with prolonged
use of bisphosphonates. Given the limited evidence
supporting benefit, the balance of benefits and harms
of treating osteopenic women is most favorable when
the risk for fracture is high. Women younger than 65
years with osteopenia and women older than 65 years
with mild osteopenia (T score between –1.0 and –1.5)
will benefit less than women 65 years of age or older
with severe osteopenia (T score < –2.0).
Clinicians can use their own judgment based on
risk factors for fracture, or they can use a risk assess-
ment tool. Several risk assessment tools, such as FRAX
(World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment
Tool), are available to predict fracture risk among un-
treated people with low bone density (379). Although
FRAX is widely used, there is no evidence from RCTs
demonstrating a benefit of fracture reduction when
FRAX scores are used for treatment decision making.
Factors that increase the risk for fracture in women in-
clude lower body weight, smoking, weight loss, family
history of fractures, decreased physical activity, alcohol
or caffeine use, low calcium and vitamin D intake, and
corticosteroid use (7, 380, 381).
INCONCLUSIVE AREAS OF EVIDENCE
Comparative effectiveness trials evaluating phar-
macologic treatments for low bone density or osteopo-
rosis are lacking. In addition, although FRAX scores are
widely used, evidence linking FRAX scores to treatment
efficacy is lacking. One post hoc analysis of a trial with
raloxifene showed that treatment efficacy did not vary
according to FRAX score (241), and at age 75 years, the
risk reduction for vertebral fracture was similar across
FRAX scores.
HIGH-VALUE CARE
The current evidence does not support frequent
monitoring of women with normal bone density for os-
teoporosis, because data showed that most women
with normal DXA scores did not progress to osteopo-
rosis within 15 years. The data also do not support
monitoring BMD during the initial 5 years of treatment
in patients receiving pharmacologic agents to treat os-
teoporosis. Clinicians should select generic drugs to
treat osteoporotic patients when possible (Table 2).

APPENDIX 1: METHODS
This guideline update is based on an AHRQ evi-
dence report and an update of the systematic review
(131, 382). The key questions addressed are:
1. What are the comparative benefits in fracture re-
duction among various pharmacologic treatments for
low bone density?
• Bisphosphonate medications: alendronate, rise-
dronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid
• Denosumab
• Menopausal estrogen therapy for women (nu-
merous brands and routes of administration)
• Parathyroid hormone 1,3,4: teriparatide
• SERMs: raloxifene
• Calcium
• Vitamin D
• Combinations or sequential use of the above
agents
• Exercise compared with the above agents
2. How does fracture risk reduction resulting from
treatments vary between individuals with different risks
for fracture, as determined by the following factors:
• BMD
• FRAX or other risk assessment score
• Prior fractures (prevention vs. treatment)
• Age
• Sex
• Race/ethnicity
• Glucocorticoid use
• Other factors (e.g., whether the individuals were
community dwelling vs. institutionalized, vitamin D de-
ficient vs. not)
3. What are the short- and long-term harms of the
various treatments when used specifically to treat or
prevent low bone density or osteoporotic fracture? Do
these vary by any specific subpopulations?
4. How often should patients be monitored (via
measurement of BMD) during therapy, and how does
the antifracture benefit vary with long term continued
use of pharmacotherapy?
Search Strategy
The literature search included identified trials pub-
lished in the English language by searching MEDLINE,
EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews, the Ameri-
can College of Physicians Journal Club database, the
National Institute of Clinical Excellence, the NHA Tech-
nology Assessment Program, the FDA's MedWatch da-
tabase, and relevant pharmacologic databases from 2
January 2005 to 3 June 2011 and was updated to
March 2014 by using a machine-learning method (9).
Evidence was further updated specifically for bisphos-
phonates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen through 12
July 2016. Reviewers also did a limited search on the
recently FDA-approved drug bazedoxifene from 1 Jan-
uary 2013 to 26 October 2016 (see Appendix 2 for the
search strategy). Only RCTs and published systematic
reviews of RCTs that met inclusion criteria were in-
cluded in the assessment of effectiveness. Where no
RCTs were available, large observational studies (with
more than 1000 participants), systematic reviews, and
case reports (for rare events) were included (for exam-
ple, assessment of effects in subgroups or assessment
of particular serious adverse events).
Quality Assessment
The quality of RCTs, observational studies, and
meta-analyses was assessed by using the Jadad scale,
the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, and the AMSTAR (Assess-
ing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews)
criteria, respectively (383–385). The overall quality
of evidence and strength of recommendations was
graded according to ACPs' clinical practice guidelines
grading system (10).
Population
Studies were limited to those conducted in adults
older than 18 years, healthy adults, those with low bone
density, or those with osteoporosis.
Interventions Evaluated
Pharmacologic agents approved for use in the
United States including bisphosphonates (alendronate,
risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid), teri-

 paratide, raloxifene, and menopausal estrogen thera-
py; the biologic agent denosumab; dietary and supple-
mental calcium and vitamin D; and physical activity.
Comparators
The efficacy or effectiveness of the intervention in
question were compared with that of placebo or an-
other potency or dosing schedule for the same agent
or another agent in the same or another class.
Outcomes
Outcomes evaluated include reduction in fracture
(total, vertebral, nonvertebral, spine, hip, wrist, other)
and adverse events.
Target Audience
The
target
audience
for
this
guideline
is
all
clinicians.
Target Patient Population
The target patient population is all adult men and
women with low bone density or osteoporosis.
Peer Review
The AHRQ systematic review was peer-reviewed
and posted on the AHRQ website for public comments.
The 2014 evidence reviews also underwent a peer re-
view process through the journal. The guideline under-
went a peer review process through the journal and
was posted online for comments from ACP Regents
and ACP Governors, who represent physician members
at the national and international level.

Black et al,
2015 (85);
zoledronic acid
Second extension of
HORIZON-PFT
Women with postmenopausal
osteoporosis
Initial RCT: Women with postmenopausal
osteoporosis randomly assigned to
receive annual zoledronic acid, 5 mg IV
(n = 3889) vs. placebo (n = 3876) for
3 y
First extension: randomly assigned to 3
additional annual infusions of
zoledronic acid vs. placebo
Second extension, double-blind: women
who received first and third doses of
zoledronic acid during the first
extension, and had completed first
extension, were randomly assigned to
receive zoledronic acid once yearly or
placebo for 3 additional years
All participants received oral calcium,
1000–1500 mg/d, and vitamin D,
400–1200 IU/d, as supplements
Primary end point: BMD
change
Secondary end point:
fracture, bone turnover
markers, safety
Clinical fractures at year 9 vs. year 6: Number
of fractures was low and did not
significantly differ by treatment.; too
few for meaningful comparison
Incidence with zoledronic acid for
9 y: 12.2%
Incidence with zoledronic acid for 6 y,
followed by placebo for 3 y: 9.5%
HR, 1.11 (CI, 0.45–2.73)
Nearly all patients who
have completed 6
annual zoledronic acid
infusions can
discontinue medication
for up to 3 y with
maintenance of benefits
Ferrari et al,
2015 (98);
denosumab
Open-label extension of
FREEDOM
Postmenopausal women aged
60–90 y with lumbar spine or
total hip T-score >–2.5 at the
lumbar spine or hip but ≥–4.0 at
both locations
Long-term therapy group: 2343
Crossover group: 1731
Initial RCT: Denosumab, 60 mg SC every
6 mo for 3 y, vs. placebo
All participants received calcium, ≥1 g/d,
and vitamin D, ≥400 IU/d
Open-label extension: 4074 participants
who missed ≤1 dose of denosumab
during the first 3 y of denosumab
treatment continued into the fourth
year (long-term group), and the
placebo group started denosumab
therapy (cross-over group) through
year 7
Nonvertebral fractures, BMD
Nonvertebral fractures:
Crossover group: reduction of 49% (rate
ratio, 0.51; P = 0.005) for year 4 vs.
years 1–3
Long-term therapy group (up to 7 y of
denosumab): reduction of 21 %
(rate ratio, 0.79; P = 0.0046) during
years 4–7 vs. years 1–3
There was a further
reduction in the
nonvertebral fracture
rate that persisted
through 7 y of
denosumab therapy
Harvey et al,
2015 (119);
teriparatide
Post hoc analysis
according to baseline
fracture risk by FRAX
prediction tool in 1537
women
Postmenopausal women aged
42–86 y
Teriparatide, 40 μg/d (n = 544), vs.
teriparatide, 20 μg/d (n = 541), vs.
placebo (n = 544) for 18 mo
The 2 teriparatide dosage groups were
combined owing to similar effects on
fracture occurrence
No mention of calcium or vitamin D dose
Morphometric vertebral
fractures; nonvertebral
fractures
Morphometric vertebral fractures:
Teriparatide treatment was
associated with a statistically
significant 66 % decrease in (HR,
0.34 [CI, 0.23–0.50])
Any nonvertebral fractures: Teriparatide
treatment based on the pooled
doses was associated with an HR of
0.63 [CI, 0.44–0.90]
Teriparatide significantly
reduced the risk for
nonvertebral and
morphometric vertebral
fractures by a similar
extent, regardless of
baseline fracture
probability
Silverman et al,
2012 (386);
bazedoxifene
Preplanned 2-y extension
of the 3-y study in 4216
postmenopausal women
Postmenopausal women aged
55–85 y with osteoporosis by
BMD or prevalent vertebral
fracture
Bazedoxifene, 20 mg/d, was continued;
participants receiving bazedoxifene,
40 mg/d group were transitioned to
20 mg/d after 4 y ("40/20 mg");
placebo was continued
5-year findings: new vertebral
fractures (primary) and
non-vertebral fractures,
changes in BMD, bone
turnover markers
Subgroup analyses were
performed in the high-risk
subgroup, defined as
women with femoral neck T
score ≤–3.0 and/or ≥1
moderate or severe or ≥2
mild vertebral fractures
Incidence of new vertebral fractures at 5 y:
Bazedoxifene, 20 mg/d: 4.5%
Bazedoxifene, 40/20 mg/d: 3.9%
Placebo: 6.8%
P < 0.05
Relative risk reduction:
Bazedoxifene, 20 mg/d: 35%
Bazedoxifene, 40/20 mg/d: 40%
High-risk subgroup: bazedoxifene, 20
mg/d, reduced nonvertebral fracture risk
vs. placebo (37%; P = 0.06); combined
data for bazedoxifene, 20 mg/d and 40/20
mg/d, reached statistical significance (34%
reduction; P < 0.05)
The antifracture efficacy of
bazedoxifene on new
vertebral fractures
continued during 5 y,
and there was
antifracture efficacy
against nonvertebral
fractures in the high-risk
subgroup
Palacios et al,
2015 (387);
bazedoxifene
Second extension of
Silverman et al,
2012 (386): years 6–7
Postmenopausal women aged
55-85 y with osteoporosis by
BMD or prevalent vertebral
fractures
The bazedoxifene group from Silverman
et al (386) continued to receive
bazedoxifene, 20 mg/d
Incidence of new vertebral
and nonvertebral fractures;
BMD change; safety
assessment
Cumulative incidence of new vertebral
fractures at 7 y:
Bazedoxifene, 40/20 mg: 6.4% (36.5%
relative risk reduction vs. placebo)
Bazedoxifene, 20 mg: 7.6% (relative risk
reduction) 30.4%)
Placebo: 9.9%
P < 0.001 for both bazedoxifene groups
vs. placebo
Overall incidence of nonvertebral fracture:
Bazedoxifene, 40/20 mg: 11.2%
Bazedoxifene, 20 mg: 12.0%
Placebo, 10.8%
The efficacy of
bazedoxifene against
new vertebral fractures
was sustained over 7 y,
but there was no effect
on overall incidence of
nonvertebral fracture

 CORRECTION: TREATMENT OF LOW BONE DENSITY OR
OSTEOPOROSIS TO PREVENT FRACTURES IN MEN AND WOMEN
There were mistakes in a recent guideline (1). The last 
sentence in the Monitoring of Patients With Osteoporosis 
section should read, “Overall data from several studies showed 
that women treated with bisphosphonates, raloxifene, and 
teriparatide benefited from reduced fractures with treatment 
even if BMD did not increase.” The third sentence in the 
Duration of Pharmacologic Therapy section should read, “Post 
hoc analysis of this study showed that women with femoral 
neck T scores of −2.5 or worse without baseline pre-valent 
vertebral fracture had reduced fracture risk by continuing 
alendronate therapy for 10 years versus stopping after 5 years 
compared with placebo (11.1% to 5.3%).” The last sentence of 
Recommendation 2 should read, “Post hoc analysis from an 
RCT suggested that patients treated with alendronate without 
preexisting fractures and a BMD of −2.5 or less after 5 years of 
initial therapy may benefit from continued treatment, because 
these patients experienced a decreased incidence of new 
clinical vertebral fractures.”
This has been corrected in the online version.
