Global, regional, and national burden of Parkinson’s disease, 
1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Parkinson’s Disease Collaborators*
Summary
Background Neurological disorders are now the leading source of disability globally, and ageing is increasing the 
burden of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease. We aimed to determine the global burden of 
Parkinson’s disease between 1990 and 2016 to identify trends and to enable appropriate public health, medical, and 
scientific responses.
Methods Through a systematic analysis of epidemiological studies, we estimated global, regional, and country-specific 
prevalence and years of life lived with disability for Parkinson’s disease from 1990 to 2016. We estimated the proportion 
of mild, moderate, and severe Parkinson’s disease on the basis of studies that used the Hoehn and Yahr scale and 
assigned disability weights to each level. We jointly modelled prevalence and excess mortality risk in a natural history 
model to derive estimates of deaths due to Parkinson’s disease. Death counts were multiplied by values from the 
Global Burden of Disease study’s standard life expectancy to compute years of life lost. Disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) were computed as the sum of years lived with disability and years of life lost. We also analysed results based 
on the Socio-demographic Index, a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility.
Findings In 2016, 6·1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5·0–7·3) individuals had Parkinson’s disease globally, 
compared with 2·5 million (2·0–3·0) in 1990. This increase was not solely due to increasing numbers of older people, 
because age-standardised prevalence rates increased by 21·7% (95% UI 18·1–25·3) over the same period (compared 
with an increase of 74·3%, 95% UI 69·2–79·6, for crude prevalence rates). Parkinson’s disease caused 3·2 million 
(95% UI 2·6–4·0) DALYs and 211 296 deaths (95% UI 167 771–265 160) in 2016. The male-to-female ratios of age-
standardised prevalence rates were similar in 2016 (1·40, 95% UI 1·36–1·43) and 1990 (1·37, 1·34–1·40). From 1990 to 
2016, age-standardised prevalence, DALY rates, and death rates increased for all global burden of disease regions except 
for southern Latin America, eastern Europe, and Oceania. In addition, age-standardised DALY rates generally increased 
across the Socio-demographic Index. 
Interpretation Over the past generation, the global burden of Parkinson’s disease has more than doubled as a result of 
increasing numbers of older people, with potential contributions from longer disease duration and environmental 
factors. Demographic and potentially other factors are poised to increase the future burden of Parkinson’s disease 
substantially.

Introduction
Neurological disorders are now the leading source of 
disability globally.1 Among neurological disorders 
examined in the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2015, Parkinson’s disease was 
the fastest growing in prevalence, disability, and deaths. 
In that study,1 the overall number of people affected by 
the disease was estimated to have more than doubled 
globally from 1990 to 2015. Previous studies have 
examined the epidemiology of Parkinson’s disease for 
different parts of the world,2 including systematic reviews 
on the prevalence of Parkinson’s disease.3,4 However, 
none has examined change in prevalence, disability, and 
deaths in detail over the past generation for the entire 
world and across all countries. In GBD 2015, we identified 
larger variation in Parkinson’s disease death rate 
estimates over time and between countries than we 
observed in prevalence estimates.1 This pattern suggested 
that coding practices rather than real changes over time 
and location were responsible, similar to what was 
observed for dementia.1 
The prevalence of a disease reflects both the incidence 
 
and the duration of disease. The incidence of Parkinson’s 
disease is linked to risk and protective factors.2,5,6 The 
most important risk factor is age, but the risk of 
Parkinson’s disease also appears to be associated with 
industrial chemicals and pollutants, such as pesticides,7 
solvents,7 and metals.8,9 Conversely, smoking is associated 
with a decreased risk of Parkinson’s disease,10 but whether 
this association is causal is debatable.11 The factors that

affect disease duration are less well known, but increasing 
longevity also translates into longer disease duration.3,12 
Therefore, as ageing and industrialisation increase 
globally and smoking decreases in some regions, the 
prevalence of Parkinson’s disease seems poised to 
increase.13,14 Detailed estimates of the disease burden can 
help to evaluate the effect of these risk factors and inform 
efforts to prevent the disease and to care for and treat 
those affected by the condition.
As part of GBD 2016, we aimed to examine the changes 
from 1990 to 2016 in counts and age-standardised rates 
of Parkinson’s disease for prevalence, disability, and 
deaths by location and by the Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, 
education, and fertility.15
Methods
Overview
The general methods for the studies on the global, 
regional, and national burden of neurological disorders 
have been published previously,1 and key aspects are 
summarised in the appendix. Additional information on 
derivation of non-fatal and fatal estimates are provided in 
the appendix as well as on Global Health Data Exchange.
Data sources
The International Classification of Diseases ninth 
revision (ICD-9) codes used in cause of death analyses for 
Parkinson’s disease are 332 (Parkinson’s disease), 332.0 
(paralysis agitans), and 332.1 (secondary parkin 
sonism), 
and the corresponding ICD-10 codes are G20 (Parkinson’s 
disease), G21 (secondary parkinsonism), and G22 
(parkinsonism in diseases classified elsewhere). The 
reference case definition for Parkinson’s disease used in 
many epidemiological studies is the presence of at least 
two of the four primary symptoms: rest tremor, 
bradykinesia, stiffness of the limbs and torso, and 
postural instability. We also accepted alternative 
definitions, including the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society 
Brain Bank criteria,16 in addition to ICD-9 and ICD-10 
codes, a doctor’s diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, and the 
prescription of Parkinson’s disease-specific medications. 
We also added 3 years of medical claims data (years 2000, 
2010, and 2012) from the USA; for a disease such as 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2015 examined the epidemiology of Parkinson’s disease 
for different parts of the world and showed that the number of 
people affected by the condition had more than doubled 
globally from 1990 to 2015. The increase in deaths from 
Parkinson’s disease was greater than the increase in prevalence, 
and the large variation in death rates between countries was 
suggestive of a change in coding practices rather than greater 
death rates among Parkinson’s disease cases. For pragmatic 
reasons, systematic reviews for Parkinson’s disease are 
scheduled every other iteration of GBD. For GBD 2016, 
we updated our GBD 2013 PubMed search without language 
restrictions using the terms (((“Parkinson disease” AND 
“epidemiology”) AND (“2011/01/01”[PDat]: 
“2015/12/31”[PDat])) AND (“Parkinson disease” AND 
“epidemiology”)) to identify articles published between 
Jan, 1, 2011, and Dec, 31, 2015. Papers were selected if 
representative of the general population and identification of 
cases was based on our reference case definition (the presence of 
at least two of four primary symptoms: rest tremor, 
bradykinesia, stiffness of limbs and torso, and postural 
instability) or alternative case definitions (UK Parkinson’s 
Disease Society Brain Bank criteria, and doctor’s diagnosis based 
on International Classification of Diseases codes and prescription 
of medications specifically for Parkinson’s disease). 
Added value of this study
We used the results of this search to obtain the data needed to 
estimate global, regional, and country-specific prevalence and 
years lived with disability for Parkinson’s disease from 1990 to 
2016. To address the possible measurement error in Parkinson’s 
disease death rates as reported by vital registration systems, we 
used a method that was previously applied to dementia in GBD 
2015. In a natural history modelling approach, we assume a 
constant risk of death in Parkinson’s disease cases over time and 
between locations and let the death rates be determined by 
variations in prevalence. Although the assumption of similar 
mortality risk in all time periods and countries is problematic, it 
produces less error than the large variation in death rates 
estimated previously. We also explored variation in the burden by 
age, sex, country, region, and Socio-demographic Index. This 
study showed that counts of prevalence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life-years more than doubled from 1990 to 
2016, and that this increase was not solely due to increasing 
numbers of older people because age-standardised rates also 
increased in most regions. In addition, the burden of Parkinson’s 
disease increased with increasing Socio-demographic Index.
Implications of all the available evidence
Neurological disorders are now the leading source of disability in 
the world, and Parkinson’s disease is the fastest growing of these 
disorders. As the population ages and life expectancy increases, 
the number of individuals with Parkinson’s disease will continue 
to increase as well as the duration of the disease, leading to more 
patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. To address this 
burden, primary prevention strategies based on the underlying 
causes of Parkinson’s disease and more effective treatments than 
are currently available are required. Additional incidence and 
prevalence studies are needed, especially in areas in which little 
data are available, to examine time trends and the factors that 
drive them.

Parkinson’s disease, the data from claims sources would 
be expected to match true prevalence under the 
expectation that most patients would be receiving medical 
attention each year. If datapoints from epidemiological 
studies spanned ages of more than 20 years, we split the 
datapoints using the age pattern from the USA, for which 
the most detailed age data were available.
Disease model
For Parkinson’s disease, we have seen large inconsis-
tencies between the cause of death data and the non-fatal 
data. For example, US vital registration data show a 
greater than three times increase in the age-standardised 
rates of death from Parkinson’s disease since 1980 
without a corresponding increase in the prevalence data 
over the same time period (appendix). Likewise, we found 
a greater than 25 times difference across different 
countries in age-standardised mortality rates for the most 
recent year of vital registration data available at the time 
of GBD 2016 (see Causes of Death Visualization), and we 
did not see such heterogeneity between countries in our 
non-fatal data. Therefore, these differences are probably 
the result of changes and inconsistencies in coding 
practices for certifying deaths from Parkinson’s disease. 
To correct for this bias, we jointly modelled the prevalence 
and mortality from Parkinson’s disease. First, we ran an 
initial cause of death model using CODEm, the cause of 
death ensemble model used throughout GBD, and an 
initial non-fatal model using DisMod-MR 2.1, the 
Bayesian meta-regression tool developed for GBD. The 
initial CODEm model used 14 990 site-years of data 
(ie, a unique combination of calendar year and country) 
as well as predictive covariates of SDI,15 cumulative 
cigarette consumption, health-care access and quality,17 
education, and mean cholesterol level (a full list of 
predictive covariates is in the appendix). The initial 
DisMod-MR 2.1 model included settings of no remission 
(ie, no cure) and no incidence before the age of 20 years 
because the disease is exceptional before that age. We 
excluded all incidence data from the model, since we saw 
incon 
sistencies between the available prevalence and 
incidence data, and we considered measurement error 
less likely to occur with prevalence data than with 
incidence data. We let DisMod-MR 2.1 adjust medical 
claims data to correct for any systematic under-reporting 
and datapoints with case definitions that differed from 
the reference. Smoking prevalence and SDI were used as 
predictive covariates in the model.
We used these initial model results to identify 
countries with high-quality vital registration systems, 
age-standardised prevalence of more than five per 
10 000, and a population of more than 1 million that also 
had the highest ratios of cause-specific mortality to 
prevalence, or highest likelihood to code to Parkinson’s 
disease as a cause of death per prevalent case in the 
most recent year of estimates. For GBD 2016, these 
countries were Austria, Finland, and the USA. We then 
used the log-transformed ratios of cause-specific 
mortality rate to prevalence in 2016 to run a fixed-effects 
regression with dummy variables on age and sex. 
Because the ratio between cause-specific mortality rate 
and prevalence is equivalent to an excess mortality rate 
or excess rate of dying among people with Parkinson’s 
disease compared with the general population, we used 
the results of this regression as input data for a second 
DisMod-MR 2.1 model. The excess mortality data 
obtained from the regression model were used as data 
for the entire 1990–2016 period and for every country 
except for the three used in the regression model, which 
retained their own data for 2016, and data for these 
countries were assumed to be constant over the entire 
time series. Apart from this addition of excess mortality 
data, the second DisMod-MR 2.1 model was identical to 
the initial model and used the same settings and 
covariates. We used the cause-specific mortality and 
prevalence results from this model as final outputs 
because they ensured consistency between the available 
non-fatal input data and the excess mortality rate in 
2016 from the three countries most likely to code to 
Parkinson’s disease as a cause of death.
Severity and years lived with disability
To calculate years lived with disability (YLDs) for 
Parkinson’s disease, we split the overall prevalence from 
the second DisMod-MR 2.1 model into three severity 
categories using data reporting on the Hoehn and Yahr 
stages.18,19 We used 30 unique sources, covering nine of 
21 world regions, and equated a score of 2·0 or less on the 
Hoehn and Yahr scale to mild Parkinson’s disease, a score 
of 2·5–3·0 to moderate Parkinson’s disease, and a score of 
4·0–5·0 to severe Parkinson’s disease (appendix). These 
data informed meta-analyses of the proportion of 
Parkinson’s disease that is mild, moderate, and severe. We 
then used these proportions to split the overall prevalence 
of Parkinson’s disease into the severity categories. Finally, 
we multiplied the prevalence of each severity category by 
severity-specific disability weights20 (see appendix for a 
detailed description) to calculate YLDs. YLDs were then 
corrected for comorbidity with a simulation that assigned 
all non-fatal outcomes to hypothetical individuals and 
adjusted disability in patients who had multiple 
conditions.
Risk estimation
Of the 84 risks quantified in GBD 2016,21 only smoking 
was judged to have sufficient evidence for a relationship 
with Parkinson’s disease, with smoking associated with 
decreased risk.10 The main sources of exposure data were 
population-based surveys. We used the estimates of 
exposure, relative risk, and a theoretical minimum level 
of exposure of zero lifetime cigarettes smoked to calculate 
population attributable fractions. Further information on 
risk factor calculations can be found in the GBD 2016 
risk factors paper.21

Compilation of results
We calculated years of life lost (YLLs) by multiplying the 
number of deaths in an age group by the remaining life 
expectancy in that age group, taken from the GBD 
standard life table.22 Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
were then calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs.
Through each computational step, uncertainty was 
propagated by sampling 1000 draws, which allowed us to 
combine the uncertainty from input data, corrections to 
the data, and residual non-sampling error. Uncertainty 
intervals (UIs) were defined as the 25th and 975th values 
of the ordered draws.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. All authors had full access to the study data 
and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
The results of our analyses can be downloaded from the 
Global Health Data Exchange and Institute for Health 
Metrics and Evaluation (Seattle, WA, USA) results tools. 
Through the systematic analysis we identified 127 data 
sources on Parkinson’s disease, including 91 sources on 
prevalence covering 16 of the 21 GBD world regions, 
34 sources on incidence covering nine world regions, 
and 11 sources on mortality risk covering two world 
regions (appendix). The 11 sources on mortality risk are 
used in the non-fatal modelling process and therefore are 
marked as belonging to “non-fatal” in the Global Health 
Data Exchange input data tool. The 11 sources with data 
on mortality risk are easily identified by the words 
“mortality” or “survival” in the title. For prevalence, 
40 (44·0%) studies were done in western Europe, nine 
(9·9%) in east Asia, seven (7·7%) each in high-income 
Asia Pacific, high-income North America, and North 
Africa and Middle East. 21 (23·0%) studies were from 
other regions, except for central Asia, central Latin 
America, tropical Latin America, central sub-Saharan 
Africa, and southern sub-Saharan Africa, for which no 
data were available.
In 2016, 6·1 million (95% UI 5·0–7·3) individuals 
worldwide had Parkinson’s disease, of whom 2·9 million 
(47·5%) were women and 3·2 million (52·5%) were 
men. 2·1 million (34·4%) of these individuals were from 
high SDI countries, 3·1 million (50·8%) from high-
middle or middle SDI countries, and 0·9 million 
(14·8%) from low-middle or low SDI countries (table). 
The number of individuals with Parkinson’s disease in 
2016 was 2·4 times higher than in 1990 (2·5 million, 
95% UI 2·0–3·0). In 1990, 1·1 million (44·0%) cases 
were in high SDI countries, 1·1 million (44·0% ) in high-
middle or middle SDI countries, and 0·3 million 
(12·0%) in low-middle or low SDI countries. The 
increase in the number of patients with Parkinson’s 
disease worldwide between 1990 and 2016 was not 
explained exclusively by an increasing number of older 
people, because global age-standardised prevalence rates 
increased by 21·7% (95% UI 18·1–25·3) from 1990 to 
2016 compared with an increase of 74·3% (69·2–79·6) 
for crude prevalence rates. The increase in the number 
of patients with Parkinson’s disease between 1990 and 
2016 was less pronounced in high SDI countries (9·2%, 
95% UI 5·5–13·2) than in other countries, and the 
largest increase was seen in middle SDI countries 
(59·8%, 53·2–66·1). The increase in age-standardised 
prevalence rates between 1990 and 2016 was similar in 
men (21·4%, 95% UI 17·6–24·9) and women (19·3%, 
15·7–22·7).

Parkinson’s disease by country varied greater than 
five times, with the highest rates generally in high-

and

in 
sub-Saharan Africa (figure 1).
Globally, Parkinson’s disease caused 211 296 deaths 
(95% UI 167 771–265 160; 93 512, 95% UI 73 702–118 421, in 
women and 117 784, 93 729–147 607, in men) and 
3·2 million DALYs (95% UI 2·6–4·0; 1·4 million, 95% UI 
1·1–1·7, in women; 1·8 million, 1·5–2·3, in men) in 2016. 
Of these, high SDI countries accounted for 84 911 (40·2%) 
deaths and 1·1 million (34·4%) DALYs, high-middle or 
middle SDI countries for 98 820 (46·8%) deaths and 
1·6 million (50·0%) DALYs, and low-middle or low SDI 
countries for 27 470 (13·0%) deaths and 0·5 million 
(15·6%) DALYs. The number of deaths was 2·6 times 
higher and the number of DALYs was 2·5 times higher in 
2016 than in 1990. These increases were not explained 
exclusively by an increasing number of older people, 
because age-standardised rates increased from 1990 to 
2016 for both deaths and DALYs by about 20% (table). 
Similar to prevalence, the increases in deaths and DALYs 
were lowest in high SDI countries and highest in middle 
SDI countries, and were seen in both men and women.
Parkinson’s disease was uncommon before 50 years of 
age. Prevalence in 2016 increased with age thereafter and 
peaked between 85 years and 89 years (1·7% for men; 
1·2% for women) and decreased after that age (figure 2). 
Age-standardised prevalence of Parkinson’s disease in 
2016 was 1·40 times (95% UI 1·36–1·43) higher in men 
than in women; the male-to-female ratio was similar in 
1990 (1·37, 95% UI 1·34–1·40). A similar pattern was 
seen for the rates of YLLs and YLDs according to age, 
although the age-related increase was considerably 
steeper for YLLs than for YLDs, suggesting that 
Parkinson’s disease-related case fatality rises with age 
(figure 3).
The age-standardised rate of DALYs of Parkinson’s 
disease by the 21 GBD world regions generally increased 
with SDI (figure 4). Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America 
and the Caribbean (with the exception of southern 
Latin America), south Asia, and high-income Asia Pacific 
had lower age-standardised DALY rates than other 
regions with similar SDI. Southern Latin America and

high-income North America were the regions with 
highest estimates relative to expected values based on 
SDI.
Smoking was found to have a small, protective effect 
on Parkinson’s disease, and would have been expected to 
prevent 461 194 DALYs (95% UI 324 745–599 845) globally 
in 2016 if the association was truly causal.
Discussion
Over the past generation, the number of individuals with 
Parkinson’s disease globally has more than doubled to 
over 6 million. Of all the neurological disorders included 
in GBD 2015,1 Parkinson’s disease was the fastest growing. 
Ageing populations contributed to much of that growth as 
crude prevalence rates increased by about 74% from 1990

to 2016 and age-standardised prevalence rates increased 
by about 22%. However, because age-standardised 
prevalence, DALYs, and death rates all increased from 
1990 to 2016, additional factors are probably important.
First, changes in study methods, availability of higher-
quality studies, and greater awareness of diagnosis24 
might have led to better estimates of prevalence, DALYs, 
and deaths since 1990.3 For example, door-to-door studies 
are less likely to miss individuals who have never been 
diagnosed and would be missed in health records.25 Our 
DisMod-MR 2.1 model did not show evidence in favour 
of a systematic bias between door-to-door surveys and 
studies based on administrative records; however, 
establishing such evidence in a model with relatively 
sparse data is difficult. Although many regions have seen 
improvements in study methods, these changes alone 
are probably insufficient to explain the rising burden of 
Parkinson’s disease. For example, the rates of Parkinson’s 
disease have also increased in high-income countries 
without substantial changes in study methodology.
Second, increasing life expectancy is probably 
contributing to longer disease duration in individuals 
with Parkinson’s disease and thus to higher prevalence, 
even if incidence remains constant and individuals with 
Parkinson’s disease show the same time trends in 
mortality as the general population.12 Indeed, in a meta-
analysis26 of ten studies, recent cohorts showed longer 
disease duration, with an increase of 2·5 years per 
decade. That study26 showed no clear evidence that the 
introduction 
of 
levodopa 
and 
improvements 
in 
Parkinson’s disease care have led to improvement in 
survival of individuals with Parkinson’s disease compared 
with similar individuals without Parkinson’s disease. A 
recent study12 estimated the burden of Parkinson’s 
disease in France from 2010 to 2030 under a constant 
incidence scenario and assuming that the relative risk of 
death of individuals with Parkinson’s disease relative to 
controls had not changed over time. It showed that the 
life expectancy of individuals with Parkinson’s disease 
would be expected to increase by approximately 3 years 
and the age-standardised and sex-standardised prevalence 
rate by 12% over 20 years. As patients live with 
Parkinson’s disease for more years and the number of 
individuals with advanced Parkinson’s disease increases, 
studies will be needed to inform the distribution of the 
severity of the disease in representative samples with 
simple instru 
ments such as the Hoehn and Yahr scale.
Third, the increase in Parkinson’s disease burden might 
be linked to environmental factors tied to the growing 
industrialisation of the world. In general, better health is 
positively associated with socioeconomic level.27–29 How-
ever, with Parkinson’s disease, the opposite is true; age-
standardised DALY rates due to Parkinson’s disease 
increased with SDI. The reason for this association is not 
clear. Some environmental exposures tied to indus-
trialisation, including pesticides,7 solvents,7 or metals,8,9 
which are also more common in high SDI countries, 
might contribute to the increased incidence of Parkinson’s 
disease. For example, in China (a middle SDI country), 
which has undergone rapid industrial growth since 1990, 
the age-adjusted prevalence rates of Parkinson’s disease 
more than doubled between 1990 and 2016, the largest 
increase worldwide. If environmental factors related to 
industrialisation played a part, an increase in incidence 
over time would be expected. A few studies have examined

time trends in incidence of Parkinson’s disease, with 
inconsistent findings. A study in the USA30 suggested that 
incidence increased by 24% (95% CI 8–43) per decade 
between 1976 and 2005 in men but not in women. By 
contrast, in the Netherlands, the Rotterdam Study31 
reported a substantial decrease in Parkinson’s disease 
incidence between 1990 and 2011, without any obvious 
explanation. One study in Canada32 and another in the 
USA33 study showed no significant time trends. In 
Finland, using the Finnish National Prescription Register, 
the incidence of Parkinson’s disease increased between 
1997 and 2014 both in rural and urban regions.34 High-
quality prospective cohort studies and detailed registries 
are needed to survey time trends in the worldwide 
incidence of Parkinson’s disease more accurately and 
understand the factors that might be driving time trends. 
Alternative explanations for the positive association 
between the burden of Parkinson’s disease and SDI 
include better ascertainment of Parkinson’s disease in 
higher SDI countries through better study methods or 
health-care access and disease recognition. However, in 
lower SDI countries, we included door-to-door studies, 
when available, that are considered to be less prone to 
underestimation.25
Fourth, declining smoking rates in some countries,35 
although a global health boon, might contribute to higher 
incidence of Parkinson’s disease.14 The risk of Parkinson’s 
disease is decreased by approximately 40% among 
smokers.10 Whether this association is truly causal or 
explained by reverse causation or other biases is still 
debated.11 If the association between smoking and 
Parkinson’s disease were causal, decreasing smoking rates 
would lead to an increase in the incidence of Parkinson’s 
disease in the future. Assuming a causal inverse association 
and a 10-year lag to account for the temporal effect of 
smoking on the incidence of Parkinson’s disease, one study 
in the USA14 estimated that declining smoking rates in the 
country might increase the projected burden of Parkinson’s 
disease in 2040 by 10%. However, because the lag time 
between exposure and the actual effect on disease risk is 
unknown and might actually be longer than 10 years,36 the 
timing of the potential effect of declining smoking rates on 
Parkinson’s disease incidence is uncertain, and additional 
studies are needed to examine the effects of changing 
smoking habits in different parts of the world with different 
smoking rates and time trends. Regardless of the results of 
such studies, the adverse health consequences of smoking 
far outweigh any potential benefit on Parkinson’s disease. 
Finally, changes in the prevalence of other known (eg, head 
trauma37) or unknown risk or protective factors that were 
not included in GBD 2016 might contribute to changing 
incidence rates of Parkinson’s disease. 
This study confirms that Parkinson’s disease is about 
1·4 times more frequent in men than women, and this 
ratio did not change substantially over the study period. 
Environmental (eg, occupational) exposures to which 
men are more frequently exposed might contribute to 
this pattern. The prevalence of Parkinson’s disease 
increased with age. Underascertainment at older ages 
owing to underdiagnosis, comorbidities, or institutional 
care might explain the decrease seen in the oldest age 
groups after the peak between 85 years and 89 years.
The current estimates for the global burden of 
Parkinson’s disease are generated from imperfect data 
and models that are refined in each iteration of the GBD 
study. Estimates from GBD studies can vary from year to 
year as revised estimates are generated on the basis of 
refined methods and inclusion of more and higher-
quality studies that are less likely to underestimate the 
true burden of the disease. Nonetheless, high-quality 
epidemiological studies (especially on incidence and 
disease severity) are still rare for large portions of the 
world, especially in low-income regions, where such 
studies are needed to understand trends and guide 
efforts to reduce the disease burden. Methodological 
differences for determining prevalence and study 
shortcomings might result in estimates that vary 
considerably and underestimate the true burden of 
Parkinson’s disease.38 This under-reporting is well known 
for Parkinson’s disease in studies based on death 
certificates,39–43 whereas population-based door-to-door 
studies are considered a better approach because they are 
able to capture undiag 
nosed cases.25 However, disease

frequency estimates from population-based studies 
might be affected by selection bias resulting from non-
response, particularly if individuals affected by the 
disease under investigation are less likely to participate. 
Non-response is an important issue as participation rates 
in epidemiological studies have considerably decreased 
over the past 30 years.44 Another limitation is that because 
we lack strong predictors for the occurrence of 
Parkinson’s disease, some of the variation between 
countries is probably due to measurement error that we 
have been unable to correct. Because we rely on 
prevalence data to derive our cause of death estimates, 
any residual measurement error in the prevalence 
estimates is transposed onto the death estimates for 
Parkinson’s disease. Although the the bias in mortality is 
an unwanted property, it is less than would have been the 
case if we had based our estimates on the observed rates 
of death with Parkinson’s disease as the underlying cause 
from vital registration data. The large variation in death 
rates over time within the same countries and the even 
larger variation between countries are implausible and 
probably explained by changing death coding practices.
Neurological disorders are now the leading source of 
disability in the world, and Parkinson’s disease is the 
fastest growing of these disorders.1 As the population 
ages and life expectancy increases, the doubling of the 
number of individuals with Parkinson’s disease between 
1990 and 2016 is projected to occur again in the coming 
generation.12–14,45 To address this great health challenge 
will require action aimed at preventing the disease where 
feasible and improving the lives of those affected by the 
condition.46 Among the potential responses available are 
preventing the disease (eg, by increasing physical activity 
earlier in adulthood47 and reducing exposure to 
pesticides7), improving worldwide access to care and 
effective treatments (eg, levodopa), increasing funding 
for research (eg, to understand the underlying causes), 
and development of new therapies.
