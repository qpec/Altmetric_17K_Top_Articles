Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of copper-impregnated com-
posite hard surfaces and linens in an acute care hospital to reduce health care-associated infections (HAIs).
Methods: We performed a quasiexperimental study with a control group, assessing development of HAIs
due to multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) and Clostridium difficile in the acute care units of a com-
munity hospital following the replacement of a 1970s-era clinical wing with a new wing outfitted with
copper-impregnated composite hard surfaces and linens.
Results: The study was conducted over a 25.5-month time period that included a 3.5-month washout
period. HAI rates obtained from the copper-containing new hospital wing (14,479 patient-days; 72 beds)
and the unmodified hospital wing (19,177 patient-days) were compared with those from the baseline
period (46,391 patient-days). The new wing had 78% (P = .023) fewer HAIs due to MDROs or C difficile,
83% (P = .048) fewer cases of C difficile infection, and 68% (P = .252) fewer infections due to MDROs rel-
ative to the baseline period. No changes in rates of HAI were observed in the unmodified hospital wing.
Conclusions: Copper-impregnated composite hard surfaces and linens may be useful technologies to prevent
HAIs in acute care hospital settings. Additional studies are needed to determine whether reduced HAIs
can be attributed to the use of copper-containing antimicrobial hard and soft surfaces.

Important progress has been made to reduce health care-
associated infections (HAIs) in the United States during the past
decade. However, despite important reductions in certain HAIs, the
nation has not yet reached the goals for HAI reduction set by the
Department of Health & Human Service’
s 2009 National Action Plan
to Prevent Health Care-Associated Infections: Road Map to Elimination.1
Continued improvement in HAI rates will require sustained pro-
motion and use of proven infection prevention strategies; however,
there is a need for new and innovative methods to prevent HAIs.
Development of HAIs are complex processes, involving both host
factors and exposure to health care-associated pathogens. Hospi-
tal environments play a crucial role in the transmission of health
care-associated pathogens. The ability of health care-associated
pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), extended-
spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaeceae (ESBL),
multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp, and carbapenem-resistant En-
terobacteriaceae (CRE), to remain viable on inanimate surfaces for
extended periods of time facilitate their trafficking between pa-
tients and health care providers in complex health care
environments.2,3 The spore-forming bacterium Clostridium difficile
is able to survive for months in a clinical environment.3 Environ-
mental contamination may serve as a reservoir for nosocomial
pathogens, which may then be transmitted to patients through the
hands of health care workers, patient care equipment, or direct
contact with a contaminated environment.3-5 Supporting this hy-
pothesis, efforts to reduce environmental bioburden have been
shown to reduce transmission of microbial pathogens and devel-
opment of HAIs in hospitalized patients.6,7 However, studies suggest

 only 25%-50% of all hospital surfaces are routinely cleaned, and en-
hanced surface cleaning practices in health care settings are difficult
to sustain.8-10 New, “no-touch” automated decontamination tech-
nologies, such as ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide, have been
introduced to supplement surface disinfection in healthcare
environments.11 However, these technologies have several limita-
tions, including the need for integration into standard housekeeping
practices, use that is restricted to unoccupied rooms during termi-
nal cleaning, need for supervised use to avoid accidental worker or
patient exposures, and significant capital expenditures.
Recently, self-disinfecting surfaces have been proposed as a means
to reduce new acquisition of nosocomial pathogens and reduce the
incidence of HAIs. Copper has potent biocidal activity and is re-
ceiving increasing attention for potential applications in health care
settings.12,13 Copper oxide-impregnated composites have been de-
veloped that can be incorporated into hard surface countertops and
molded hard surfaces and woven into textiles.13-15 In this study, we
investigated the real-world application of this technology follow-
ing the replacement of a 1970s-era hospital wing with a 124-bed
tower outfitted with copper-containing composite hard surfaces and
linens.
METHODS
Study setting
The study was conducted at Sentara Leigh Hospital, a commu-
nity hospital in Norfolk, VA, that averages more than 14,000
admissions per year and has specialty services in orthopedic, gy-
necologic, urologic, and comprehensive breast care. The study was
conducted during the replacement of a 1970s-era clinical wing with
a new hospital wing in November 2013. All rooms in both the ex-
isting hospital and the new wing were single-occupancy beds. The
room size was 118 sq ft in the existing hospital and 250 sq ft in the
new wing. Room amenities in the existing hospital included a bath-
room with a sink and toilet; rooms in the new wing had bathrooms
that included a shower in addition to a sink and toilet. The new wing
included 3 24-bed general acute care units as well as a single 20-
bed intensive care unit (ICU) and single 24-bed intermediate medical
care unit (IMCU). Because no comparable ICU or IMCU level beds
remained in the old hospital wing, patients admitted to the ICU and
IMCU within the defined period of evaluation were excluded from
the analysis. Obstetric, neonatal, and newborn nursery patients were
also excluded from the analysis. For the final analysis, the study com-
pared 204 acute care hospital beds of the original hospital from
November 15, 2012-November 16, 2013 (baseline period), and 72
and 84 acute care hospital beds in the new wing and the old wing,
respectively, from March 1-December 31, 2014 (assessment period).
During a 3.5-month washout period between November 17, 2013,
and February 28, 2014, the new hospital wing was opened and the
study linens were deployed in its units.
Patient rooms and select patient care clinical areas of the new
wing were outfitted with 16% copper oxide (weight/weight) im-
pregnated composite countertops and molded surfaces (Cupron
Enhanced EOS Solid Surfaces; Cupron Inc, Richmond, VA, and EOS
Surfaces LLC, Norfolk, VA), targeting high-touch surfaces. Countertops
included sinks, vanities, patient room desks, computer stations, soiled
utility rooms, and nurse workstations (Fig 1). Form-fitting copper-
impregnated composite molded surfaces included over-the-bed tray
tables and bed rails (Fig 1). Between December 1, 2013, and Feb-
ruary 14, 2014, copper-impregnated woven linens (Cupron Medical
Textiles; Cupron Inc) were sequentially deployed in units of the new
wing (1 new unit every few weeks) but not in the old wing. The
linens included patient gowns, pillowcases, fitted and flat sheets,
washcloths, bath towels, bath blankets, and thermal blankets
(Fig 1). Health care workers did not wear copper-impregnated
clothing.
The copper-impregnated linens were beige in color, whereas stan-
dard linens were white. Additionally, the copper-composite hard
surfaces of the new wing had a characteristic beige color. Educa-
tional materials about the products were provided to the patients,
explaining the reason for their distinctive colors. Consequently, staff
and most patients and visitors were aware of assertions for the an-
timicrobial activity of the copper-composite hard surfaces and linens.
Patients were assigned to room based on bed availability and in some
cases, clinical specialty of the unit. Nursing personnel, physicians,
therapy staff, and support staff were shared across units; in general,
nurses tended to remain unit-based, whereas physicians and other
staff tended to move between units. Environmental services per-
sonnel coordinated deployment of copper-impregnated linens to the
new wing alone, and audits by management staff of the units and
infection preventionists (IPs) ensured their correct placement. Laun-
dering protocols were the same for both sets of linens and were in
accordance with established protocols. Patients were prospective-
ly assessed for the development of potential allergic reactions to
copper. Patients who developed possible skin hypersensitivity re-
actions due to the products were referred to dermatology for
dermatologic evaluation.

 Demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic
medical records; these data included the age, gender, and race/
ethnicity of the patients, history of C difficile infection and/or
multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization or infection at
any Sentara Healthsystem Hospital during the prior 6 months, history
of hospitalization at any Sentara Healthsystem Hospital during the
prior 180 days, total length of stay, need for ICU care, and in-
hospital mortality. Classification of hospitalization type was based
on the specialty of the primary provider (medicine or surgery/
surgical subspecialty) at the time of admission.
Infection prevention and control program
Except where noted below, HAI prevention measures and prac-
tice improvement were implemented consistently throughout the
entire hospital between the baseline period and the assessment
period. Additionally, all HAI prevention measures were imple-
mented equally in both the old and new wings during the assessment
period. Hospital room cleaning and disinfection was performed by
an environmental services program, which used education, clean-
ing checklists, and monitoring of cleaning thoroughness using Dazo
fluorescent marking gel (Ecolab, St Paul, MN) in a quality assess-
ment program. Routine daily and terminal cleaning used quaternary
ammonium disinfectants, except for patients with C difficile infec-
tion, when a hypochlorite product was used. Isolation precautions
practices were in accordance with professional guidelines.16 Sur-
veillance cultures for MRSA, VRE, or other MDRO colonization were
not routinely performed. Neither ultraviolet light nor hydrogen per-
oxide was used for environmental decontamination. Routine
chlorhexidine gluconate bathing was performed only for preoper-
ative orthopedic surgery patients throughout the study, and those
patients were usually admitted to the new wing during the assess-
ment period. Unit-level hand hygiene compliance rates were assessed
through an ongoing, anonymous auditing program by IPs and unit-
based staff; no major changes in the hand hygiene program occurred
during the study period.
Infection control practices implemented during the study period
were as follows: In February 2013, a nurse-driven protocol to remove
indwelling bladder catheters was introduced. In March 2013, use
of isopropyl alcohol disinfection caps (Curos Disinfecting Port Pro-
tectors; Ivera Medical Corporation, San Diego, CA) on all unused
central venous catheter (CVC) ports started throughout the hospi-
tal. Efforts to improve CVC dressing maintenance and reduced CVC
use occurred continuously throughout the hospital during the study.
Finally, during October 2014, Det Norske Veritas/Germanischer Lloyd
designated Sentara Leigh Hospital as a Managing Infection Risk
Center for Excellence, based on the efforts of hospital staff and lead-
ership to reduce HAI disease risk and facilitate collaborative practice
improvement.
HAI surveillance and definitions
HAI surveillance was performed retrospectively through the ex-
isting infection prevention and control (IPC) program of the hospital
and was not blinded from the locations of the events. The primary
end point was the incident rate (IR) of hospital-onset (HO) infec-
tions, using National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions,
due to an MDRO or C difficile for patients admitted to acute care unit
rooms during the study period. MDROs included MRSA, VRE,
extended-spectrum β-lactamase, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter
spp, and CRE. HO was defined as events that occurred on or after
the third day of admission to the hospital. The location of attribu-
tion was assigned to the inpatient location where the HO infection
occurred, following (when applicable) the NHSN transfer rule for
events that occurred the day of or after a patient transfer or
discharge.
Secondary end points of the study included IRs of HO MDRO in-
fections, HO C difficile infection (CDI), HO central line-associated
bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and HO catheter-associated urinary
tract infection (CAUTI). IRs of HO infections due to MDROs and/or
C difficile were calculated based on the total number of patient-
days of acute care unit occupancy. CLABSI IRs were calculated based
on the number of catheter-day exposures to ≥ 1 intravascular cath-
eter that terminated in a great vessel; CAUTI IRs were calculated
based on the number of catheter-day exposures to an indwelling
bladder catheter. The study was terminated on December 31, 2014,
due to a substantial revision of NHSN definitions for several end
points in the study. This study was a pragmatic investigation that
assessed summary data without individual identifiers; it was re-
viewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sentara
Healthcare Corporation.
Statistical analysis
For the primary outcome, we used a quasiexperimental design
to compare all-cause HO infections due to an MDRO or C difficile
per 10,000 patient-days (pooled MDRO and CDI divided by total pa-
tient-days ×10,000) for the study periods. We also compared HO
pooled MDRO infections (pooled MDRO divided by total patient-
days ×10,000), HO CDI IRs per 10,000 patient-days (CDI divided by
total patient-days ×10,000), HO CLABSI IRs per 10,000 catheter-
days (CLABSIs divided by total catheter-days ×10,000), and HO CAUTI
IRs per 10,000 catheter-days (CAUTI episodes divided by total cath-
eter-days ×10,000) for the study periods.
Incident rate ratios were calculated, comparing IRs between the
new wing or old wing during the assessment period and the hos-
pital during the baseline period. Device use rates were calculated
by dividing the total number of central venous or indwelling bladder
catheter-days by the total number of patient-days, respectively. Com-
parison of categorical variables was performed using the Pearson
χ2 test. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. All
analyses were performed using SPSS, version 21.0 (IBM-SPSS Inc,
Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
A total of 23,889 hospitalized patients were evaluated during the
study, of whom 13,928 and 9,961 were hospitalized during the base-
line and assessment periods, respectively. During the assessment
period, 5,257 patients were hospitalized in the old wing, equipped
with standard surfaces and linens, and 4,704 patients were hospi-
talized in the new wing, outfitted with copper-composite hard
surfaces and linens through all beds (Fig 1). Demographic and clin-
ical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the
baseline period, individuals hospitalized in the old hospital wing
during the assessment period were primarily medicine patients,
whereas those hospitalized the new wing were more likely to be
surgical or surgical subspecialty patients, reflecting the geograph-
ic admitting practices of the hospital following the opening to the
new wing. Individuals hospitalized in the old wing were more likely
to be black, less likely to be white or Asian, and more like to have
congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease, or HIV
or AIDS compared with the baseline period. Individuals admitted
to the new hospital wing were more likely to be white, less likely
to be black or Asian, and less likely to have congestive heart failure,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, or end-
stage renal disease compared with the baseline period. Individuals
admitted to the old wing but not the new wing were more likely
1567
C.D. Sifri et al. / American Journal of Infection Control 44 (2016) 1565-71
 to have been hospitalized in a Sentara Healthsystem hospital within
the prior 180 days.
A small minority (<1%) of admitted patients had a prior known
history of C difficile infection and/or MDRO colonization or infec-
tion through the study periods. Although there was no difference
in the incidence of prior MDRO colonization/infection in patients
hospitalized in either wing during the assessment period com-
pared with the baseline period, more patients had a history of C
difficile infection in the old wing compared with the baseline period.
During the assessment period, individuals admitted to either the
old or the new hospital wing spent a portion of their admission in
the intensive care unit compared with the baseline period. Finally,
patients admitted to the new wing were more likely to die during
their admission compared with the baseline period, whereas those
admitted to the old hospital wing were less likely to die com-
pared with the baseline period.
The baseline period included a total of 46,391 patient-days. The
assessment period included a total of 33,656 patient-days distrib-
uted between the new wing (14,479 patient-days; 43%) and the old
wing (19,177 patient-days; 57%). Overall, IR of pooled MDRO and
CDI was 6.25 events per 10,000 patient-days during the baseline
period (95% CI, 6.21-6.30). During the assessment period, IR of pooled
MDRO and CDI fell to 1.38 events per 10,000 patient-days in the new
wing (95% CI, 1.32-1.44; P = .023; Table 2). By comparison, IR of
pooled MDRO and CDI was unchanged at 8.34 events per 10,000
patient-days in the old wing (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.29-
8.40; P = not significant) (Table 2). Incident rate ratios for the new
wing and the old wing compared with historic data were 0.221 and
1.335, respectively.
Subanalysis demonstrated a reduction in IR of CDI in the new
wing, with 0.69 (95% CI, 0.65-0.73) events per 10,000 patient-
days during the assessment period (P = .048) (Table 2) compared with
4.10 (95% CI, 4.05-4.14) events per 10,000 patient-days during the
baseline period, whereas the IR of CDI in the old wing during the
assessment period remained stable at 4.69 (95% CI, 4.62-4.76) events
per 10,000 patient-days (P = not significant) (Table 2) compared with
the baseline period. IRs of pooled MDRO in the new and old wings
were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.65-0.73) and 3.65 (95% CI, 3.58-3.72) events
per 10,000 patient-days, respectively, during the assessment period,
compared with an IR of 2.16 (95% CI, 2.12-2.19) events per 10,000
patient-days during the baseline period (both P = not significant)
(Table 2). IRs of CLABSI and CAUTI were not different during the as-
sessment period for either the new wing or the old wing compared
with the baseline period (Table 3).
Hand hygiene compliance was 94% of all observed hand hygiene
opportunities during the baseline period and was 88% and 87% for
the new wing and the old wing, respectively, during the assess-
ment period. A total of 10 patients hospitalized in new wing

hypersensitivity reaction. Nine were evaluated by dermatology and
determined to have an alternative etiology for their skin rash. One
patient was discharged before the reaction could be assessed.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that a newly constructed hospi-
tal wing with broad deployment of copper-composite hard surfaces
and linens had 78% fewer HO infections due to MDROs or C difficile
relative to the baseline period. Compared with historic data, use of
copper-composite hard surfaces and linens was also associated with
83% fewer HO CDI and 68% fewer HO MDRO infections, although
the latter did not reach statistical significance. By contrast, no sig-
nificant changes in HO total MDRO or C difficile infections, HO CDIs,
or total MDRO infections were observed in patients admitted in par-
allel to the old hospital wing compared with the baseline period.
Together, these results suggest that antimicrobial surfaces and linens
may have substantial influence in reducing HAIs due to problem-
atic MDROs in a hospital that has already employed aggressive
infection control measures and has low rates of HAIs. However, no
differences were observed in device-associated infections in pa-
tients cared for in room outfitted with the copper-containing
products.
Contaminated environmental surfaces in hospitals are increas-
ingly being recognized as potential reservoirs for health care-
associated pathogens that may be transmitted to patients, for
example through unclean hands, contaminated medical equip-
ment, or direct interactions with the environment by a patient.2-4,6,17
Hospital staff, even when using protective equipment such as gloves,
may contaminate themselves by touching contaminated surfaces
and then may transfer microorganisms to other patients, either di-
rectly or indirectly by contaminating other surfaces.18,19 Similarly,
textiles in hospitals have been hypothesized to be an important
source of cross-contamination and transmission of MDROs in clin-
ical environments.13 Textiles are an excellent substrate for bacterial
and fungal growth under appropriate moisture and temperature con-
ditions, and studies have shown that bacteria and fungi can survive
for prolonged periods (in some cases up to 3 months) on hospital
fabrics.20 Microbial shedding from the body occurs continuously and
may be greater in hospitalized or ill individuals. Thus a bacterium,
when shed onto a textile fabric between the patient and the bed,
can survive and proliferate in the warm, moist setting of the textile
microenvironment.21 Like hard surfaces, contaminated textiles can
then cross-contaminate the hands of hospital personnel or shared
medical equipment.19 Moreover, activities such as bed making and
undressing may release microbes into the air that contaminate ad-
jacent hospital surfaces.22
Copper has potent intrinsic biocidal activity for a broad spec-
trum of microorganisms.12 Several recent studies have demonstrated
that copper-containing surface materials, including the copper-
composite hard surfaces used in this study, can reduce microbial
loads on various clinical surfaces by 60%-100%.14,23 Copper incor-
porated into hospital textiles has also been demonstrated to have
potent biocidal properties, resulting in hospital linens with 46%-
50% reduced microbial loads compared with standard linens.15
This study represents the largest clinical trial of copper or copper-
containing antimicrobial surfaces reported to date, with more than
14,000 patient care days in 72 copper-furnished acute care hospi-
tal beds. The largest previous clinical trial of copper antimicrobial

 hard surfaces was a randomized control trial performed in 16 medical
ICU rooms (8 copper and 8 control) in 3 hospitals in New York and
South Carolina. The study compared the clinical outcomes of persons
hospitalized in copper-furnished rooms (294 patient-days) to persons
hospitalized in noncopper control rooms (320 patient-days) and
found a 58% reduction in HAIs and a 42% reduction HAIs and/or new
MRSA or VRE colonization in patients in the copper-furnished
rooms.24 Antimicrobial linens containing copper oxide particles have
also been evaluated in a clinical setting. In a quasiexperimental study
conducted at an Israeli chronic care head injury ward across 2
6-month time periods, patients exposed to copper-impregnated
linens (3,940 patient-days) had 24% fewer HAIs, fewer days of fevers,
and reduced antibiotic use than patients who were using stan-
dard linens (4,337 patient-days).15 The reduced incidence of HAIs
observed in this investigation are comparable to those reported in
these earlier studies; however, in contrast to prior studies, this in-
vestigation occurred with patients admitted to an acute care hospital
with low rates of HAI at baseline.
An unexpected finding was that the single largest reduction in
HAIs observed in persons hospitalized in rooms with copper-
impregnated biocidal products was the reduction in CDI. C difficile
endospores are intrinsically resistant to contact killing by copper,
which has led some experts to question whether copper and copper-
containing
products
could
reduce
C
difficile
in
hospital
environments.2,25 However, vegetative C difficile is readily killed by
copper, which could reduce the time available for vegetative C difficile
to successfully undergo sporulation and thereby reduce environ-
mental contamination by C difficile endospores.25 Moreover, the
copper-composite hard surfaces used in this study have some ac-
tivity against C difficile endospores. Under experimental conditions,
exposure to the copper-composite hard surfaces used in this study
leads to a 1.6 log10 reduction in viable C difficile endospores over 24
hours of exposure (A. Monk, personal communication), which is
similar to what has been previously reported for copper and copper
alloys.26
The study has several strengths. It is largest clinical trial of copper
or copper-containing antimicrobial surfaces reported to date, with
more than 67,000 patient-care days distributed between the dif-
ferent arms of the study, including nearly 14,500 patient care days
in copper-furnished acute care hospital beds. To our knowledge, it
is also the first study to explore the combined use of both self-
disinfecting hard surfaces and linens in the same investigation.
Deployment of antimicrobial hospital linens as well as antimicro-
bial hard surfaces in patient rooms and common work areas provides
perhaps the most comprehensive use of self-disinfecting surfaces
used to date. Finally, it reports the real-world experience of using
these products in an institution with low rates of MDRO and device-
associated infections.
However, there are several important limitations to this study.
Differences in patient characteristics, demographic characteris-
tics, or risk factors for HO C difficile and/or MDRO infection in
individuals hospitalized the new hospital wing and/or the old hos-
pital wing may have influenced the study results. Notably, the
admission types of the new wing and old wing were markedly dif-
ferent: A majority of admissions to the new wing were surgical
patients, whereas those hospitalized in the old wing were nearly
exclusively medicine patients. Perhaps reflecting this difference in
admission type, patients admitted to the old wing were more likely
to have medical comorbidities, whereas those admitted to the new
wing were generally less likely to have medical comorbidities. Fur-
thermore, those admitted to the old wing were also more likely to
have been admitted to the hospital in the prior 180 days. Al-
though these could be predicted to influence exposure to MDROs
before hospitalization, no difference was noted in MDRO
colonization/infection of patients hospitalized in either wing during
the assessment period compared with the baseline period. However,
patients in the old wing but not the new wing were more likely to
have a history of C difficile infection in the prior 6 months. Unfor-
tunately, some patient-specific risk factors, such as antibiotic
consumption based on geographic location of admission, could not
be obtained for this analysis. As a quasi-experimental study with
a control group, other potential confounders may not have been rec-
ognized between patient populations over time or by hospital
geography.
In addition to patient-specific factors, differences in the physi-
cal configuration and furnishings of the newly constructed wing and
the rest of the hospital not associated with the use of copper-
composite surfaces may have been another confounder. For example,
the rooms in the new wing were 112% larger than those in the ex-
isting hospital. Interestingly, Jou et al27 recently reported a positive
association between hospital room square footage and risk of CDI.
The authors speculate that this association is the consequence of
increased environmental cross-contamination and/or inadequate
room cleaning. In this study, the lowest rates of CDI observed were
in rooms of the new wing, which were the largest acute care rooms
in Sentara Leigh Hospital.
It should also be noted that data were collected retrospectively
by the IPC program personnel during the study. Although no sig-
nificant changes were made in the IPC program for the duration of
the study, we cannot guarantee that recall bias did not occur as a
consequence of the retrospective review. Lack of blinding may have
also led to reporting bias among staff or even patients. The study
did not assess new colonization of MDROs during hospitalization;
consequently, a thorough evaluation of the effect of copper-
impregnated composite materials on MDRO transmission could not
be performed. Finally, the relative contribution of specific hard sur-
faces or linens to potential protection from HAIs cannot be
determined from this study.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that broad deployment of biocidal
copper-composite hard surfaces and linens was associated with fewer
HAIs, notably including CDI, in a population of acute care hospi-
talized patients. As constitutively active, horizontal infection
prevention measures, self-disinfecting surfaces and linens repre-
sent a novel approach to limiting transmission of MDROs and
reducing HAIs. Like no-touch automated decontamination tech-
nologies, these technologies should not be viewed as replacement
for proper environmental hygiene practices, but rather as means to
augment infection prevention in hospitals. Additional studies using
more rigorous methods and trial designs are needed to better de-
termine the efficacy of copper-containing hard and soft surfaces for
infection prevention in modern clinical environments.
