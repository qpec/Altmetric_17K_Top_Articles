Key Points
• In a pilot study, the
nonanticoagulant
heparin derivative CX-01
was well tolerated
when combined with
chemotherapy for the
treatment of AML.
• Preliminary results
show encouraging
complete remission
rates and rapid platelet
recovery.
Relapses in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) are a result of quiescent leukemic stem
cells (LSCs) in marrow stromal niches, where they resist chemotherapy. LSCs employ
CXCL12/CXCR4 to home toward protective marrow niches. Heparin disrupts
CXCL12-mediated sequestration of cells in the marrow. CX-01 is a low-anticoagulant heparin
derivative. In this pilot study, we combined CX-01 with chemotherapy for the treatment of
AML. Induction consisted of cytarabine and idarubicin (7 1 3) with CX-01. Twelve patients
were enrolled (median age, 56 years; 3 women). Three, 5, and 4 patients had
good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk disease, respectively. Day 14 bone marrows were
available on 11 patients and were aplastic in all without detectable leukemia. Eleven
patients (92%) had morphologic complete remission after 1 induction (CR1). Eight patients
were alive at a median follow-up of 24 months (4 patients in CR1). Three patients received an
allogeneic stem cell transplant in CR1. Median disease-free survival was 14.8 months.
Median overall survival was not attained at the maximum follow-up time of 29.4 months. No
CX-01-associated serious adverse events occurred. Median day to an untransfused platelet
count of at least 20 3 109/L was 21. CX-01 is well tolerated when combined with intensive
therapy for AML and appears associated with enhanced count recovery and treatment
efficacy.
Introduction
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) afflicted 21 380 patients in the United States in 2017, with 10 590
deaths and a 5-year survival of 26.9%.1 The mainstay of therapy is variations on the combination of
cytarabine and an anthracycline (“7 1 3”).2 Relapses are common because of quiescent leukemic stem
cells (LSCs) in marrow stromal niches, where they are resistant to chemotherapy.3
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) migrate to and are anchored by chemotactic signals produced in
bone marrow stroma.4,5 Foremost among these signals is the CXC chemokine CXCL12 (stem cell-
derived factor-1, or SDF-1), which ligates chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) on the HSC surface and
activates migration toward, and attachment in, the marrow.6,7 CXCL12/CXCR4 also activates
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B, enhancing survival.8 In the marrow, HSCs shuttle
between an endosteal osteoblastic niche inducing quiescence and a sinusoidal endothelial vascular

From 
 niche promoting proliferation and differentiation.4 Quiescence
in the endosteal niche is maintained by close association with
megakaryocytes.9,10 Megakaryocytes negatively regulate HSC
proliferation through secretion of platelet factor-4 (PF4), a cationic
chemokine
that
also
enhances
integrin-mediated
endothelial
adhesion during marrow homing.11
LSCs employ the same CXCL12-, CXCR4-dependent mechanisms
as normal HSCs to home toward a marrow niche.3,4 CXCR4 is an
unfavorable AML prognostic factor.12 Disrupting CXCR4 inhibits
transmigration, survival, and chemotherapy resistance in vitro and in
vivo.13,14 The CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor has been tested in AML.15
Plerixafor administered for up to 7 days for stem cell mobilization is
well tolerated,16 but carries the possibility of increased secondary
myeloid malignancies.17
Heparin avidly binds to a cluster of cationic amino acids on the
CXCL12 surface that mediates attachment of the chemokine to
heparan sulfate on cell surfaces.18,19 Heparin can disrupt CXCL12-
mediated sequestration of cells in marrow by competing with
marrow heparan sulfate.20 Heparin’s competitive inhibition of
CXCL12 binding to heparan sulfate is not diminished by removal of
2-O sulfates,20 but is apparent only at concentrations exceeding
therapeutic plasma levels for anticoagulation.20-22 An alternative to
disrupt the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is use of a heparin analog with
reduced anticoagulation. Low anticoagulant 2-O, 3-O desulfated
heparin (ODSH, CX-01) is a porcine intestinal heparin derivative
that retains many heparin anti-inflammatory properties.23 CX-01
binds PF4 with affinity similar to heparin, but the CX-01/PF4
complex does not bind antibodies that mediate heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.24,25 Megakaryopoiesis is negatively regulated
by PF4, and anti-PF4 blocking antibodies diminish chemotherapy-
induced thrombocytopenia in mice.26 By reversing the biologic
activities of PF4, CX-01 is able to mitigate chemotherapy-induced
thrombocytopenia in PF4-overexpressing transgenic mice.27
We conducted a pilot study combining CX-01 with chemotherapy
for AML treatment. Results show no added toxicity from CX-01.
Complete remission (CR) rates and count recovery were encour-
aging. Exploratory in vitro studies suggest CX-01 may interfere with
the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis.
Methods
Clinical trial
This was an open-label pilot study conducted at 3 academic
centers. The protocol was approved by the University of Utah,
Augusta University, and the Medical University of South Carolina
respective Institutional Review Boards (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT02056782). The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Adult patients with previously untreated
AML based on World Health Organization criteria28 with an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 and
adequate organ function were enrolled. Patients with acute
promyelocytic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia were
excluded. Patients needing anticoagulation were excluded.
Treatment protocol.
Induction cycles consisted of cytar-
abine at 100 mg/m2 as a continuous 24-hour infusion on days 1
through 7, and idarubicin at 12 mg/m2 as a slow intravenous push
on days 1 through 3. CX-01 was administered as a bolus of 4 mg/kg
over the course of 30 minutes immediately after the first dose of
idarubicin, followed by a continuous infusion at 0.25 mg/kg per hour
for 24 hours on days 1 through 7. Patients who were aged 60 years
or older received further therapy off study. Patients who were
younger than 60 years remained on study and received up to 4
consolidation cycles consisting of cytarabine at a dose of 3 g/m2
intravenously over the course of 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1,
3, and 5. For consolidation cycles, CX-01 was given as a bolus
of 4 mg/kg over the course of 30 minutes after completion of
the first dose of cytarabine, followed by a continuous infusion at
0.25 mg/kg per hour for 24 hours on days 1 through 5. Eligible
patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant whenever ready
after completion of induction therapy.
Supportive care.
Red blood cell transfusions, antibiotics,
and myeloid growth factors were given per institutional guidelines.
Prophylactic platelet transfusions were given to maintain a platelet
count of at least 10 3 109/L for afebrile patients and of at least
20 3 109/L for febrile patients. Otherwise, platelets were given
as clinically indicated.
End points.
Primary endpoints included safety and tolerability
of CX-01 when combined with chemotherapy and the effect of
CX-01 on platelet transfusion independence, defined as the first of
5 consecutive days with an untransfused platelet count of at least
20 3 109/L. Secondary endpoints included rate of CR, platelet
nadir, number of platelet transfusions, and toxicity using Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.29 Responses
were determined using International Working Group Criteria.30
Statistical analysis.
Platelet recovery and toxicity end-
points were analyzed using descriptive statistics with reporting of
minimum, maximum, mean, median, and 95% confidence interval of
the mean. CR rates were reported as a fraction of enrolled subjects
together with an exact 95% binomial confidence interval con-
structed using the method of Clopper and Pearson.31 Planned
enrollment was 10 evaluable patients. The target rate of unaccept-
able CX-01–related toxicity was 20% with the following decision
rule: If 3 or more subjects experience unacceptable CX-01-related
toxicity, an acceptable dose of CX-01 has been exceeded. If 0-2
patients
experience
unacceptable
CX-01-related
toxicity,
an
acceptable dose of CX-01 has not been exceeded. With this rule,
there is a 7% chance of making an incorrect determination that an
acceptable dose of CX-01 has been exceeded if the true rate of
unacceptable CX-01-related toxicity is 10%. There is a 6% chance
of making an incorrect determination that an acceptable dose of
CX-01 has not been exceeded if the true rate of unacceptable
CX-01-related toxicity is 50%.
Pharmacokinetic studies.
Single-dose and steady-state
pharmacokinetic sampling at 5 points was obtained during
induction cycles for 7 patients. Duplicate samples for each point
were analyzed by BioCascade Incorporated (Arlington, WI), using
the Sta-Chrom anti-Xa assay,23 calibrated to express CX-01
concentration in micrograms per milliliter.

 groups were blocked by ethanoline injection. For direct binding
studies, biotinylated CX-01 and heparin sodium were then injected
at a concentration of 50 mg/mL for 2 min at 5 mL/min, resulting in
approximately 174 to 243 response units CX-01 or heparin sodium
immobilized. Control flow cells were used for background sub-
traction, having biotin captured over the immobilized neutravidin. For
direct binding analysis, CXCL12a was diluted in HBS-EP (0.01 M
HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% v/v Surfactant
P20; GE Healthcare). Different dilutions of the protein were injected
at a flow rate of 30 mL/min for 180 seconds. A dissociation time of
300 seconds was set up, followed by regeneration with 3 M NaCl in
HBS-EP buffer.
Competition for CXCL12 binding between immobilized heparin
sodium and CX-01. For the competition experiment, CXCL12a
(final concentration, 100 nM) was mixed with various concentra-
tions of CX-01 (0, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 1000, and 2000 nM) and then
injected. The effect of CX-01 on CXCL12a binding to immobilized
heparin was monitored as relative response units, used to calculate
50% inhibitory concentration values.
Surface plasmon resonance data evaluation. Surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) data were analyzed by global fitting either to a 1:1
Langmuir binding model or to a 2-state reaction binding model,
using the Biacore T100 BIAevaluation software 2.0.4 (GE Health-
care). For competition studies, data were plotted and the amount of
CX-01 required to inhibit 50% of the CXCL12 binding to heparin
was determined.
Cell migration studies.
To determine the effect of CX-01 on
the migration of AML cells toward CXCL12, we conducted in vitro
migration assays using a cell migration kit from Cell Biolabs (San
Diego, CA) with the U937 monocytic leukemia cell line (ATCC,
Manassas, VA), after verification of CXCR4 expression by flow
cytometry. U937 cells (0.2 3 106 cells/0.1 mL) were loaded in
inserts with 5-mm pore membranes. Inserts were transferred to
wells containing 0.5 mL OPTI-MEM media with CXCL12 (100 ng/mL),
CX-01 (200 mg/mL), or both. To investigate the direct effect of CX-01
on leukemia cells in 1 variable, CXCL12 only was added to the wells,
and U937 cells (2 3 106/mL) were pretreated for 30 minutes with
500 mg/mL CX-01. Cells were then washed before loading into
inserts. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. Cell migration was quantitated with the CyQuant GR dye
stain according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Results
Clinical trial
Patient characteristics.
Enrollment was planned for 10
patients; 12 were enrolled (median age, 54 years; range, 22-74
years; 3 women). Two patients (patients 2001 and 1007) were
taken off study because of adverse events unrelated to CX-01. They
were replaced for the purposes of time to count recovery analysis
and were not included in that analysis. They were included in the
response and toxicity analysis. Patient 2001 was taken off study
after 2 days of induction because of acute recurring angioedema-
like allergic reactions that began before treatment and may have
been from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Patient
1007 developed acute renal failure secondary to tumor lysis and
vancomycin nephrotoxicity, and was taken off treatment after
completing 5 of the 7 days of induction. All patients were evaluable
for safety. Ten completed the induction cycle and were evaluable for
efficacy. Table 1 summarizes patient characteristics. Three, 5,
and 4 patients had good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk disease,
respectively.
Response to induction.
Eleven (92%) of 12 patients
obtained a morphologic CR after 1 induction cycle (CR1), including
the 2 patients who did not complete induction. All patients with de
novo AML (11/11) obtained a CR. Two patients in morphologic CR
had minimal residual disease by molecular testing. Patient 1007
received 5 days of induction and had detectable inv(16) by
polymerase chain reaction. Patient 1006 had a FLT-3/ITD mutation
and an inv(3) that were detectable at the end of induction. The
patient who did not obtain a CR (1003) had presented with
extensive lymphadenopathy with a bone marrow showing chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia-2, but was included in the study on the
basis of evidence of granulocytic sarcoma on lymph node biopsy. It
is worth noting that day 14 bone marrows were available on 11
patients and were aplastic in all without detectable leukemia.
Count recovery after induction.
We analyzed count re-
covery in the 10 patients who completed a full induction cycle. They
had a median time to recovery of an untransfused platelet count of
at least 20 3 109/L and of at least 50 3 109/L of 21 (mean, 21.3 6
1.7; range, 18-22) and 23.5 (mean, 23.1 6 2.0; range, 19-25) days,
respectively. Induction cycles required a median of 6.0 platelet
transfusions (mean, 6.5 6 3.9; range, 0-10 transfusions). Patient
1010 had a platelet count nadir of 11 3 109/L and required no
platelet transfusions. Patient 1002 had an induction course
complicated by a rectal abscess and hematuria and received
10 platelet transfusions. The median platelet nadir count for
induction cycles was 8 3 109/L (mean, 8.4 3 109/L 6 2.6 3 109/L;
range, 0.5-14 3 109/L).
Patient 1010 was the only patient who received filgrastim support at
the discretion of the treating physician and not because of a delay in
count recovery. As we aimed to obtain preliminary results on the
effect of CX-01 on bone marrow recovery, patient 1010 was not
evaluated for total white blood cell (WBC) or neutrophil recovery.
For patients who did not receive filgrastim support, we analyzed
time to recovery to a total WBC of at least 1 3 109/L and a
neutrophil count of at least 0.5 3 109/L. Eight patients were
evaluable for total WBC recovery and had a median time to a WBC
count of at least 1 3 109/L of 21 days (mean, 23 6 4.8; range,
20-35 days). Patient 1009 was not included in the analysis for a
total WBC recovery to a count of at least 1 3 109/L because his
WBC never went below 1 3 109/L during the whole induction
cycle. Five patients were evaluable for neutrophil recovery and had a
median time to a neutrophil count of at least 0.5 3 109/L of 22 days
(mean, 22.6 6 2.4; range, 21-27 days). The other patients were
discharged from the hospital with a rising absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) before achieving the target neutrophil count, and were
therefore not included in the analysis for the time to ANC recovery.
Frequency of platelet transfusions after consolidation.
Four patients received 1 or more consolidation cycles on study, with
median frequencies of platelet transfusions as follows (n 5
evaluable patients): for the first consolidation cycle (n 5 4),
2 (mean, 2.0 6 0.7; range, 1-3) transfusions; for the second
consolidation cycle (n 5 3), 3 (mean, 2.3 6 0.9; range, 1-3)
transfusions; for the third consolidation cycle, (n 5 2), 2 (mean,
2.0 6 0.0; range, 2- 2) transfusions. Patient 1005 received a fourth
consolidation cycle on study and had a prolonged hospitalization

From 
 because of septic shock with multiorgan failure in the setting of
neutropenia. He was therefore not evaluable for the number of
platelet transfusions associated with that cycle. The starting platelet
counts at the beginning of the first consolidation cycle were typically
higher than for other cycles because most patients experienced
some degree of rebound thrombocytosis on full hematologic
recovery from induction. Platelet and WBC nadirs for consolidation
cycles were not evaluated because subjects had blood count
checks only 3 times per week on an outpatient basis on completion
of chemotherapy.
Postinduction therapy and long-term follow-up.
Of the
12 patients enrolled, 7 were not eligible to receive postinduction
treatment on study because of age 60 years or older, induction
failure, or incomplete induction cycles (Table 1). Of the remaining
patients, 1 developed a line-associated deep venous thrombosis
requiring anticoagulation and was taken off study before consoli-
dation. The remaining 4 patients each received 1 or more cycles
of consolidation on study as follows: patient 1005 completed all
4 cycles; patient 1009 received 3 cycles of consolidation and
withdrew from study; patient 3001 completed 1 consolidation
cycle, withdrew from study, and was lost to follow-up; patient 3003
received 2 consolidation cycles before relapsing. Three patients
who completed induction received an allogeneic stem cell trans-
plant in CR1 (patients 1002, 1006, 1010). Two of those patients
were alive without evidence of disease at the time of final data
analysis. Six of 8 patients who obtained a CR with induction therapy
and did not receive a transplant in CR1 relapsed at a median time of
8 months. Among those were patient 2001, who had not completed
induction and relapsed 7 weeks after diagnosis, and patient 3001,
who received only 1 cycle of consolidation and relapsed 13.5
months after diagnosis. With a median follow-up of 24 months, 8
patients were alive. Median disease-free survival was 14.8 months.
Median overall survival was not attained at the maximum follow-up
time of 29.4 months (Figure 1).
Safety and toxicity.
CX-01 was well tolerated and did not
increase the risk of bleeding. Coagulation parameters in induction and
consolidation were not significantly affected by CX-01. Anti-factor Xa
activity before and during administration of CX-01 was not significantly
changed from baseline and remained below published therapeutic
anticoagulant reference ranges. Two patients experienced grade 3 to 4
and 3 patients experienced grade 1 to 2 bleeding episodes, all deemed
to be unrelated to CX-01.
A total of 5 serious adverse events occurred in 5 patients. Grade 4
sepsis occurred in 2 patients during the first and fourth con-
solidation. These events were deemed to be possibly related and
not related to CX-01, respectively. Another patient experienced
febrile neutropenia not related to CX-01 during induction. Patient
1002 had a perirectal abscess during induction requiring surgery
with platelet support, an event that was unrelated to CX-01.
Patients 1007 and 2001 did not complete induction because of
serious adverse events that were unrelated to CX-01 (see “Patient
characteristics”).
The most frequent nonserious adverse events were hematologic,
followed by infectious and organ toxicity complications resulting from
treatment and/or the underlying leukemia. Grade 3 and 4 hematologic
toxicities
were
consistent
with
intensive
AML
chemotherapy.
Transient asymptomatic low-grade elevations of liver transaminases
were observed during chemotherapy administration in induction
cycles. These were deemed by investigators to be possibly related to
CX-01, irrespective of other potential causes of liver function
abnormalities. Transient asymptomatic grade 3 to 4 liver trans-
aminase elevations were observed during consolidation cycles in 2
patients and were deemed possibly related to CX-01. Serum bilirubin
remained normal for all patients, except for an isolated grade 4
hyperbilirubinemia as a consequence of hepatic failure complicating
septic shock in patient 1005 during the fourth consolidation.
Pharmacokinetics.
Single-dose and steady-state pharma-
cokinetic plasma sampling was obtained during induction at 5
points for 7 patients (Figure 2). Peak levels of 38.5 6 7.5 mg/mL
(average 6 SEM) were reached 15 minutes after CX-01 bolus
injection. For unknown reasons, patients 3001 and 3002 had
substantially lower peak levels of CX-01 than the remaining patients

constants, yielding apparent KD values from 26 to 40 nM and 5 to
30 nM, respectively. To determine whether CX-01 inhibits binding of
CXCL12a to immobilized heparin, a constant amount of CXCL12a
was incubated with varying concentrations of CX-01 and injected over
the immobilized heparin. The amount of residual binding was
determined at each concentration of CX-01, and the corresponding
amount of free CXCL12a was determined. Competition experiments
demonstrated that binding of 100 nM CXCL12a to immobilized
heparin was inhibited by progressively higher concentrations of CX-01
(Figure 3A), with 5 nM CX-01 inhibiting 46.8% of the interaction
between CXCL12a and heparin, for a 50% inhibitory concentration of
4.7 nM (0.055 mg/mL) (Figure 3B).
Cell migration studies.
To test the effects of CX-01 on
chemotaxis, we performed in vitro migration studies using U937
AML cells. CXCL12 at a concentration of 100 ng/mL induced
chemotaxis of U937 AML cells. Addition of CX-01 (200 mg/mL) to
CXCL12 in the wells did not inhibit migration. However, pretreating
U937 cells with CX-01 (500 mg/mL) nullified the chemotactic effect
of CXCL12, suggesting a direct effect of CX-01 on leukemic cells
(Figure 4).
Discussion
In this pilot exploratory study, CX-01 in combination with standard
intensive AML therapy was safe and well tolerated, with no
unexpected serious adverse events, suggesting that the approach
is feasible. The combination was associated with an encouraging CR
rate of 92%. Hematologic recovery was also encouraging, with a
median of 22 days to reach an ANC larger than 0.5 3 109/L, and 21
days to reach a platelet count higher than 20 3 109/L in induction
cycles.
From a toxicity point of view, we observed transient asymptomatic
low-grade elevations in liver transaminases during induction cycles.

Figure 4. Effect of CX-01 on U937 cell migration toward CXCL12. The assay
was conducted using a cell migration assay kit from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA),
as detailed in the Methods section. CXCL12 was added at a concentration of
100 ng/mL in the wells. CX-01 was added at a concentration of 200 mg/mL in the
wells. To investigate the direct effect of CX-01 on leukemia cells in 1 variable,
CXCL12 only was added to the wells and U937 cells were pretreated for 30
minutes with 500 mg/mL CX-01 before loading them into inserts. The graph shows
averages and standard errors of the mean of 2 to 3 replicate wells in each group
(the media blank variable had 1 well). The legend indicates CXCL12 and/or CX-01
added to the wells or pretreatment of U937 cells with CX-01. The graph is
representative of 2 separate experiments. RFU, relative fluorescence unit.

From 
 Elevation of liver transaminases is a class effect for heparins.34 It
has also been described for idarubicin and cytarabine induction
regimens in the absence of heparin.35 Transient asymptomatic
grade 3 to 4 liver transaminase elevations were also noted during
consolidation cycles in 2 patients. Simultaneous coadministration of
CX-01 with cytarabine in this study may confound attribution of
causality for this effect, as hepatotoxicity has also been reported for
cytarabine.36 Although the CX-01 dose and schedule were
identical for induction and consolidation cycles (except for the
duration of the CX-01 continuous infusion), consolidation cycles
employed a much higher dose of cytarabine than induction cycles,
raising the possibility of multifactorial causation of elevated liver
transaminase levels.
Pharmacokinetic studies showed a similar pattern of CX-01
clearance as in normal volunteers.23 It should be noted that the
doses we used were lower than doses use in the latter study.23 These
results suggest that CX-01 can be administered with cytarabine and
idarubicin without significant drug-drug interaction. Hematologic
recovery was rapid compared with published data, with a median of
22 days to reach an ANC higher than 0.5 3 109/L, and 21 days to
reach a platelet count higher than 20 3 109/L in induction cycles.
A randomized comparison will be required to confirm these findings.
The combination was associated with an encouraging CR rate of
92%, higher than the 71% CR rate reported by Vogler et al using a
similar regimen of cytarabine and idarubicin.37 None of our
patients needed a second induction cycle to achieve CR,
compared with 23% in the Vogler study.37 Although our study is
small, it is conceivable that the improvement over the expected
response is the result of disrupting the CXCL12/CXCR4-
mediated homing of LSCs to the protective marrow niche.3,4
Intravenous boluses of sulfated polysaccharides mobilize normal
stem cells from the niche into the circulation, suggesting that
sulfated polysaccharides also mobilize LSCs.38 Promoting cell
division and permissive migration closer to the vascular compart-
ment may expose leukemic cells to chemotherapy in a vulnerable
state. Our hypothesis is supported by the similar binding affinity of
CX-01 and unfractionated heparin for CXCL12 and the ability of
CX-01 to inhibit binding of CXCL12 to immobilized heparin at
concentrations below those achieved in the circulation of treated
patients. This suggests similar competition in vivo of CX-01 with
marrow glycosaminoglycans. Interestingly, when CX-01 was
added to CXCL12 in U937 cell migration studies, it did not inhibit
migration of the leukemic cells toward CXCL12. The discrepancy
between the SPR data and the cell migration data may be a result
of differences between a cell-free assay (SPR) and a cell-based
assay (migration). However, pretreatment of U937 cells with CX-01
abrogated migration toward CXCL12, suggesting a direct effect
on the leukemic cells to block the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. As the
CX-01 concentration in these experiments was higher than the
measured drug concentrations in patients, further work will be
required to determine whether that observation can be reproduced
at lower CX-01 concentrations.
The mean days of recovery to a platelet count above 50 3 109/L
and to a WBC count above 1 3 109/L were 23.1 and 23.0 days,
respectively; a more rapid return of platelets (mean of 35.1 days for
a platelet count higher than 50 3 109/L) and WBC (mean of 31.2
days for WBC count higher than 1 3 109/L) than previously reported
with this regimen.37 Furthermore, the median time to recovery of
neutrophils for induction cycles in CX-01-treated patients is essentially
identical (22 days) to that of patients supported with myeloid growth
factors during induction.39 Although the number of patients in our study
is small, and while acknowledging the inherent limitations of such
comparisons, our results are encouraging with respect to WBC and
neutrophil recovery.
PF4 levels inversely correlate with recovery of platelet counts after
chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,40 and
PF4 suppresses the proliferation of normal HSCs.9,10 Because
CX-01 inhibits the biologic action of PF4, our observations suggest
that CX-01 might be abrogating the suppressive effect of PF4
on marrow recovery. Furthermore, the effects on platelet and
neutrophil counts in our study are compatible with the recently
appreciated role of megakaryocytes and PF4 in promoting
quiescence of normal HSCs.9,10 Thus, PF4 might conceivably play
a role in maintaining LSC quiescence, similar to normal HSCs. In
these conditions, CX-01 (a polyanion that charge-inhibits critical
cationic structural sequences of PF4) could remove any PF4
constraint on LSC activation, while simultaneously promoting
megakaryocytic and myeloid recovery through neutralization of the
inhibitory effect of PF4 on HSCs.
Results of this pilot study are preliminary and exploratory in nature.
They require confirmation in large studies, as well as more
extensive evaluation of our mechanistic hypotheses. However, if
confirmed, CX-01 might offer a valuable adjunctive therapy for one
of hematology’s most challenging malignancies.
