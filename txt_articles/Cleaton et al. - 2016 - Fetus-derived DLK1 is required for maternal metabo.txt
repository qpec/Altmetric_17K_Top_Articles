Abstract
Pregnancy is a state of high metabolic demand. Fasting diverts metabolism to fatty acid oxidation, 
and the fasted response occurs much more rapidly in pregnant women than in the non-pregnant 
state. The product of the imprinted Delta-like homologue 1 gene (DLK1) is an endocrine signaling 
molecule that reaches a high concentration in the maternal circulation during late pregnancy. By 
utilising murine models with deleted Dlk1 we show that the fetus is the source of maternal 
circulating DLK1. In the absence of fetally-derived DLK1, the maternal fasting response is 
impaired. Furthermore, we found that maternal circulating DLK1 levels predict embryonic mass in 
mice and can differentiate healthy small for gestational age (SGA) from pathologically small 
infants in a human cohort. Therefore measurement of DLK1 in maternal blood may be a valuable 
method for diagnosing human disorders associated with impaired DLK1 expression, and to predict 
poor intrauterine growth and complications of pregnancy.

 Introduction
Adaptations to maternal carbohydrate and lipid metabolism occur during pregnancy to 
ensure a continuous supply of nutrients to the fetus [1]. In late gestation fasting rapidly 
diverts maternal metabolism to fatty acid (FA) oxidation, and reductions in maternal plasma 
glucose and insulin combined with elevated FAs and ketones are seen in fasted pregnant 
women hours before these changes are observed in the non-pregnant state -a phenomenon 
known as ‘accelerated starvation’ [2].
DLK1 is the product of an imprinted gene that is predominantly expressed from the 
paternally-inherited chromosome during fetal development [3] [4]. It is a single-pass 
transmembrane protein that can be cleaved by extracellular proteases to give rise to a 
circulating form [5]. This soluble moiety reaches a high concentration in the maternal 
circulation during late pregnancy [6] [7] [8]. DLK1, also known as fetal antigen 1 (FA1) and 
pre-adipocyte factor 1 (PREF1), is known to play a crucial role in adipose homeostasis[9]. 
Our previous studies with genetically-modified mice showed that DLK1 shifts nutrient 
metabolism towards FA oxidation, both in the context of the transition from birth to weaning 
[10], and following high-fat feeding, in part through modulation of the growth hormone axis 
[11]. Since pregnancy is similarly associated with global shifts in nutrient partitioning, we 
hypothesised that high DLK1 levels during this period might modulate maternal metabolic 
adaptations.
Here we show that the fetus is the source of maternal circulating DLK1 during pregnancy. In 
the absence of fetally-derived DLK1, maternal ketone levels are not elevated during fasting, 
suggesting that DLK1 is part of the accelerated starvation response. Furthermore, lack of 
DLK1 during the mother’s development additionally impairs her ability to respond to the 
metabolic demands of pregnancy. We demonstrate that circulating DLK1 levels are 
positively associated with embryonic mass in mouse pregnancies and that DLK1 levels are 
significantly lower in pregnant women who go on to deliver a small for gestational age 
(SGA) infant. SGA is simply a descriptive term for an infant whose birth weight falls below 
a statistical threshold, but is of clinical interest because a proportion of these infants are 
small because of fetal growth restriction (FGR) [12]. We found that there is no significant 
difference in DLK1 levels between healthy SGA and controls, but there is a highly 
statistically significant reduction in DLK1 in FGR. These data support our findings in the 
mouse that reducing DLK1 dosage compromises pregnancy. Moreover, measuring DLK1 
has considerable potential utility in the clinic to identify pregnancies that will require 
additional monitoring and obstetrical intervention.
Results
Maternal circulating DLK1 is derived from the conceptus
To determine the source and function of high maternal DLK1 in pregnancy we utilised 
genetically modified mice that lack a functional copy of Dlk1[13]. We first explored the 
effect of loss of a functional Dlk1 gene in breeding-age females. Total body mass did not 
vary between genotypes (wild-type (WT), Null (Dlkm-/p-) and Mat (maternal heterozygotes,

 Dlk1m-/p+), Supplementary Fig. 1a) but body composition was markedly different. At 12 
weeks, virgin Null females had increased abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and 
reduced muscle mass compared to Dlk1-expressing females (Supplementary Fig. 1b, 1c). 
These alterations in body composition are likely to be due to loss of Dlk1 during 
embryogenesis, since Dlk1 Null embryos had reduced size due to a reduction in skeletal 
length and lean mass from at least as early as E18.5 (Supplementary Fig. 1d-f). These 
animals caught up in weight in the preweaning period, but body composition was not 
normalised (Supplementary Fig. 1g, 1b-c). Elevated WAT mass at 12 weeks was 
accompanied by an increase in serum leptin levels (Supplementary Fig. 1h). In humans high 
BMI is associated with elevated DLK1[14], suggesting that levels of this protein might be 
modulated by nutritional status.
Next, we compared DLK1 in plasma from virgin WT females, with levels at 15 days post 
conception (E15.5) in WT females that had been mated to WT males. Plasma DLK1 levels 
increased approximately 5-fold during the first 2 weeks of mouse pregnancy (Fig. 1a). As 
Dlk1 is expressed predominantly from the paternally-inherited chromosome[3] [4], a cross 
between a Null mother and a WT father produces offspring that express Dlk1 at WT levels, 
since they all inherit an intact Dlk1 gene from their father (they are maternal heterozygotes 
for the deleted allele (Dlk1m-/p+, Mats)). Conversely, a cross between a Dlk1-expressing 
mother (either a Mat or WT) and a Null father produces offspring that that do not express 
Dlk1 (they are, respectively, homozygotes or paternal heterozygotes for the deleted allele 
(Dlk1m-/p- or Dlk1m+/p-, Nulls or Pats)) since maternally inherited Dlk1 is repressed by 
imprinting. All crosses are summarised in Fig. 1b. In pregnancies where both the mother and 
the conceptus had inherited the ablated Dlk1 gene (Null x Null), DLK1 could not be 
detected in the maternal plasma (Fig. 1a and 1c), confirming that there was no residual 
DLK1 produced from the ablated Dlk1 allele.
We conducted serial measurements of maternal plasma DLK1 in crosses of mice where the 
mother, the conceptus, or both were unable to express Dlk1 (Fig. 1b, 1c). DLK1 was 
detected at high levels in maternal plasma only if the conceptus retained the ability to 
express Dlk1 (Fig. 1c). Thus, the conceptus is the source of elevated maternal plasma DLK1 
in pregnancy. DLK1 levels in maternal plasma began to rise between E9.5 and E11.5 in all 
crosses that contained Dlk1-expressing conceptuses (Fig. 1c). This rise coincides with the 
time of formation of the definitive placenta in the mouse[15].
Unexpectedly, Null females crossed with WT males had equal or higher levels of plasma 
DLK1 compared with WT or Mat females crossed to WT males (Fig. 1d). Since DLK1 
levels are known to correlate with the number of conceptuses in the litter[6], we investigated 
whether litter size was affected by maternal genotype. Consistently, Null mothers had larger 
litters than mothers with a functional copy of Dlk1 (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). 
This was not due to a sampling error caused by controlling our cohort to exclude extremes of 
litter size and genotype ratio, as when we pooled the data for all crosses generated, Null 
females consistently produced approximately one additional conceptus compared with WT 
or Mat females (WT and Mat mean litter size = 7.0 ± 0.3, n = 40 litters; Null mean litter size 
8.2 ± 0.3, n = 48 litters, p < 0.001, Mann Whitney test). Appropriate maternal leptin levels 
are necessary for conception and survival of the early embryo[16]; leptin increases the

 invasiveness of the early embryo[17] and enhances ovulation[18]. Our finding that Null 
females had increased fecundity is consistent with their elevated leptin levels 
(Supplementary Fig. 1h).
When the amount of maternal plasma DLK1 per expressing conceptus was calculated, those 
in the Null x WT cross produced a similar amount of DLK1 to conceptuses in WT x WT or 
Mat x WT crosses (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). However, litters where only half of 
the conceptuses had an intact Dlk1 allele (Null x Mat cross, Fig. 1b) produced significantly 
more DLK1 per conceptus than litters where all were able to express Dlk1 (Fig. 1f).
Fetal, not placental, origin of maternal circulating DLK1
To distinguish whether the placenta or the embryo is the source of maternal plasma DLK1, 
we utilised additional models of Dlk1 dosage manipulation. We have previously described a 
transgenic line that recapitulates Dlk1 expression in the embryo, but not in the placenta[19] 
(Fig. 2a). We crossed the transgene onto a Dlk1-/- background (Null–TG) and measured 
transgene-specific Dlk1 expression in the embryo and placenta (Fig. 2b, c). As expected, 
DLK1 expression in the embryo closely resembled the WT, but DLK1 was lost from the 
fetal endothelial compartment of the Null–TG placenta. However, DLK1 expression was 
retained in a small population of cells in the placental labyrinth; these cells had large nuclei, 
consistent with a trophoblast identity, and contributed 24% of the WT Dlk1 expression (Fig. 
2d). The placenta is a potential source of circulating DLK1 since, like the embryo, it 
expresses cleavable isoforms Dlk1A and B. As previously reported, the transgene 
recapitulated the isoform-specific Dlk1 expression[11] (Fig2e). We crossed Null–TG fathers 
to Null mothers to generate litters where all Dlk1 was transgene-derived (Supplementary 
Fig. 2). We found that maternal circulating DLK1 levels were not different from WT x WT 
crosses (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Table 1), indicating that DLK1 originates from either the 
embryo or a trophoblast population of the placenta.
We used a conditional allele of Dlk1[20] to ablate expression in all of the cells of the 
embryo and the fetal endothelium of the placenta, using the Meox2Cre[21] (Fig. 2g). DLK1 
was largely absent in the embryo when the conditional allele (Dlk1fl/fl) was crossed to the 
Meox2Cre (Fig. 2h). Confirmation that the Meox2Cre was active in the fetal endothelium of 
the placenta was achieved by crossing to a mTmG reporter line[22] (Fig. 2i). As predicted, 
DLK1 expression in the placenta was absent from the fetal endothelial compartment in the 
conditional knock-out line (Fig 2i). In the embryo and placenta residual Dlk1 expression was 
14–17% of WT levels following conditional targeting (Fig 2j, k). We crossed Meox2Cre+/- 
mothers to either WT or Dlk1fl/fl fathers to generate litters where Dlk1 was undeleted or 
deleted in half of the litter (Supplementary Fig. 2 – since the Meox2Cre is lethal in the 
homozygous state we were unable to generate a fully deleted litter). We found that maternal 
circulating DLK1 levels in Dlk1–deleted litters were approximately 50% of those where 
DLK1 was not deleted (Fig. 2l and Supplementary Table 1), indicating that maternal 
circulating DLK1 does not originate from the trophoblast cells of the placenta. Taken 
together these data show that the source of maternal circulating DLK1 is the embryo, not the 
placenta.

 Pregnancies lacking DLK1 have compromised lipid metabolism
We next investigated whether Dlk1 expression dosage was relevant to the metabolic 
adaptations of pregnancy. Our experimental design allowed us to assess the contribution of 
both maternal Dlk1 genotype, and the presence or absence of circulating DLK1 from the 
conceptus (Fig. 1b). During pregnancy, total body weight and food intake did not 
significantly differ between the groups (Supplementary Table 2) despite the larger litters in 
Null females (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Table 1). When weight gain was normalised for 
number of conceptuses in the litter or total litter mass, Null females gained relatively less 
weight over the course of pregnancy (Fig. 3a, b). WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver 
mass increased during pregnancy (Supplementary Table 3). Virgin and pregnant Null 
females had enlarged abdominal WAT deposits compared to WT and Mat (Supplementary 
Table 3), but consistent with their reduced overall weight gain, Null females gained less 
WAT during pregnancy compared with Dlk1–expressing females (Fig. 3c). This gain was 
depot–specific, since the Null females had a similar retroperitoneal WAT mass to Mat and 
WT females when virgins and when pregnant at E15.5. As in virgins, muscle mass was 
reduced in the pregnant Null females, and brain mass did not differ between the groups 
(Supplementary Table 3). In summary, females lacking Dlk1 during their own development 
had altered body composition as virgins, and gained less adipose tissue during pregnancy, 
suggesting that maternal loss of Dlk1 function limits adipose plasticity during pregnancy. 
Conceptus–derived circulating DLK1 did not modify any of these body composition 
parameters (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).
In contrast, circulating DLK1 did modify levels of circulating maternal metabolites. While 
Null x WT responded to pregnancy with a reduction in total cholesterol and HDL–C, 
pregnant Null females lacking conceptus-derived DLK1 (Null x Null) had a much less 
marked reduction in HDL–C (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, while Mat females with 
a normal pregnancy–induced rise in DLK1 had elevated levels of circulating ketones, Mat 
females without pregnancy-associated DLK1 did not. These changes occurred without 
alterations to circulating insulin levels (Supplementary Table 4) in free–fed females.
Upon fasting, Null females without pregnancy–induced DLK1 production failed to elevate 
their circulating ketones and were relatively hyperglycaemic, suggesting that the switch from 
glucose to fatty–acid fuel utilisation had not occurred (Fig. 3d, e), despite normal insulin 
levels (Fig. 3f). This was supported by the finding that Null mothers with circulating DLK1 
had elevated hepatic expression of Hmgcs2 (encoding a rate limiting enzyme in the 
ketogenesis pathway, Fig. 3g) compared to Null mothers without circulating DLK1. As in 
non–fasted animals, Null mothers without conceptus–derived DLK1 did not experience the 
same magnitude of decrease in circulating HDL–C compared to Null females with 
circulating DLK1 (Fig. 3h, i). Combined, these data suggest that failure to elevate DLK1 
during pregnancy prevents normal maternal metabolic adaptations – specifically reduced 
HDL–C and an accelerated response to starvation by the induction of ketogenesis.
We previously reported that non–pregnant transgenic mice with DLK1 levels elevated to a 
similar level as those during pregnancy (DLK1 levels in Dlk1-transgenic females at 6 
months 343 ± 37ng/mL compared to WT (x WT) females at 12 weeks, E15.5, 223 
± 24ng/mL) have reduced circulating cholesterol levels and increased peripheral FA

 utilisation, in part due to increased growth hormone (GH) production[11]. GH levels are 
elevated in pregnancy in both humans and rodents (although the source of rodent GH in 
pregnancy is not clear[23], as they lack the placental GH gene variant found in 
primates[24]). Since GH-like molecules promote maternal adaptations to pregnancy[24], we 
asked if circulating GH was affected by Dlk1 during gestation. GH levels were elevated 13–
fold by E15.5 of pregnancy in WT mice, but pregnancies entirely lacking Dlk1 had much 
less marked elevation in GH levels (approximately 3–fold in the Null x Null cross, Fig. 3j). 
These changes occurred in the absence of alterations to endocrine regulators of GH; 
estradiol and corticosterone (Fig. 3k, l), and pituitary Gh mRNA levels were unaffected 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). We concluded that pregnancies without a conceptus–derived rise in 
maternal plasma DLK1 have altered fuel metabolism, which may in part be due to impaired 
GH release.
Maternal circulating DLK1 reports fetal outcome
We compared embryo and placental weights of conceptuses with similar genotype in 
different maternal and litter contexts (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 5). Null embryos and 
placentae were smaller than WT or Mats, and neither the maternal genotype (and associated 
litter size) nor the presence/absence of circulating DLK1 affected weight at this stage 
(E15.5, Supplementary Table 5). However, Mat embryos in mixed litters with Null 
littermates (Null x Mat crosses) were significantly larger than Mat or WT embryos in any 
other context. Interestingly, since this group of conceptuses generated a greater amount of 
DLK1 per conceptus (Fig. 1e), this demonstrates a direct link between embryonic size and 
maternal circulating DLK1 levels. Placental size was not similarly increased at this 
gestational stage (Supplementary Table 5).
We therefore sought to determine whether there was any relationship between maternal 
plasma DLK1 levels and fetal growth in pregnant women. We used data and samples from a 
previously described prospective cohort, the Pregnancy Outcome Prediction study[25, 26]. A 
total of 4,512 women having first pregnancies were recruited and outcome data were 
available from 4,200. We studied a sample of 45 women who delivered a baby with a 
customized birth weight percentile less than the 5th (SGA) at term and had a plasma sample 
available which had been obtained around 36 weeks of gestational age (wkGA). We then 
identified two comparison groups: (1) matched controls (available for 43 out of the 45 
cases), (2) a random sample from the cohort. In the former comparison group, women were 
one–to–one matched on the basis of maternal age, body mass index, smoking, fetal sex and 
mode of delivery to controls delivering a normally grown infant, i.e. samples were analysed 
as a matched case control study [27]. The maternal and outcome characteristics of these 
three groups are tabulated (Supplementary Table 6). Analysis of the matched cases and 
controls indicates no significant differences between the groups in either the matching 
characteristics or the gestational age of measurement of DLK1 (Supplementary Table 7). 
However, compared with the matched controls, the birth weights of their infants were 820 g 
lower on average.
Different phenotypes of SGA were classified according to research ultrasonographic 
examination, and the details of this are described elsewhere[26]. Ultrasonic assessment

 included serial Doppler flow velocimetry of the uterine and umbilical arteries. Both women 
and clinicians were blinded to the results of these research scans. High resistance uterine 
artery flow was defined as a mean pulsatility index in the top decile at 20 wkGA, high 
resistance umbilical artery flow was defined as a pulsatility index in the top decile at 36 
wkGA, and low abdominal circumference growth velocity was defined as a difference in 
abdominal circumference z score between the 36 and 20 wkGA scans falling in the lowest 
decile (i.e. this group includes the fetuses which showed the greatest reduction in the relative 
size of the abdominal circumference at the time of the 36 wkGA scan). Among the 43 SGA 
pregnancies with matched controls, 20 (47%) had none of these features and were called 
healthy SGA and 23 (53%) had one or more of these features and were defined as FGR 
(birth outcomes of these 2 groups are presented in Supplementary Table 8).
DLK1 levels were measured in maternal plasma obtained at a mean of 36 weeks and 1 day 
of gestational age (SD 2.7 days), (Fig. 4a). When compared with matched controls 
(Supplementary Table 9), DLK1 was lower overall in women with SGA infants (mean 
difference = –9.44, P=0.0001). However, when this population was divided into healthy 
SGA and FGR, there was no significant difference between healthy SGA and controls (mean 
difference –4.97, P=0.22), but there was a highly statistically significant reduction in DLK1 
in FGR (mean difference = –13.33, P<0.0001). When analyzed by the different phenotypes 
of FGR, there were very strong associations between DLK1 concentration and SGA in the 
presence of either high resistance umbilical artery Doppler (mean difference = –17.13, 
P<0.0001) or low abdominal circumference growth velocity (mean difference = –11.96, 
P=0.007).
The strength of the association was then further evaluated by comparing cases with the 
random sample of the cohort using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
(Fig. 4b). Overall, DLK1 was moderately predictive of SGA: area under the ROC curve 
(AUROCC) 0.65 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.77, P=0.01). Similarly to the comparison with matched 
controls, there was no significant association between DLK1 levels and healthy SGA 
(AUROCC=0.59; 95% CI=0.44 to 0.74; P=0.22), but there was a highly statistically 
significant association with FGR (AUROCC=0.71; 95% CI=0.58 to 0.84; P=0.001). Again, 
the strongest association was with SGA combined with high resistance umbilical artery 
Doppler (AUROCC=0.82; 95% CI=0.70 to 0.93; P<0.0001).
Discussion
During late pregnancy the mother must be able to adapt her metabolism to changes in food 
availability in order to maintain a constant supply of energy to the fetus. Here we have 
shown in the mouse that both DLK1 expression in maternal tissues, and circulating DLK1 
derived from the fetus are necessary for appropriate metabolic adaptations to pregnancy; 
specifically to provide metabolic plasticity by allowing the switch to FA utilisation when 
resources are limited during fasting.
Moreover, since it is derived from the fetus, maternal circulating DLK1 levels provide a 
non–invasive read–out of embryonic state. Our data indicate that maternal plasma DLK1 
levels are lower in pregnancies complicated by FGR, and suggest that DLK1 measurements

 in women may be clinically useful to differentiate healthy SGA infants from those which are 
pathologically small, an area of intense clinical interest. Interestingly, lower DLK1 levels 
were most strongly associated with high resistance patterns of flow in the umbilical artery 
and slow abdominal circumference growth velocity. The potential clinical significance of 
clinical measurement of DLK1 is underlined by the fact that we have previously reported 
that these two measures were the most effective predictors of neonatal morbidity in 
pregnancies where the baby was suspected to be small on the basis of ultrasonic fetal 
biometry[26]. Previous studies have reported contradictory associations between cord blood 
DLK1 levels and birth weight [28], as well as in complications of pregnancy[29]. Those 
studies used a commercial ELISA which reports DLK1 levels that were ˜100x lower than 
values reported in both the original pioneering work on DLK1 as a soluble factor in 
pregnancy[7] and the values measured in this study. This suggests that further assay 
development may be required before DLK1 is a suitable biomarker for clinical use. 
However, our data is consistent with a recent study that reported a genomic variant at the 
imprinted DLK1–GTL2 locus in humans that segregates with birthweight[30], and with a 
study where elevated DLK1 expression was associated with LGA pregnancies[31].
The analysis of human plasma samples focused on blood samples obtained at 36 wkGA. The 
gestational age of analysis was purposeful, as at this stage of pregnancy delivery is a safe 
and effective intervention to mitigate the risks of FGR where it is clinically suspected. We 
have previously outlined a case for screening women for adverse pregnancy outcome in late 
gestation[32]; around one third of all intrauterine fetal deaths (IUFDs) occur at or after 37 
weeks and about 30% of all IUFDs at term are thought to be related to poor fetal growth[12]. 
However, detection of FGR at earlier gestational ages would also be valuable, and further 
work could address whether these associations are present at earlier gestational ages, and 
whether DLK1 is also predictive of other adverse pregnancy outcomes.
In conclusion our findings highlight DLK1 measurement as a valuable prenatal diagnostic 
for known disorders of impaired fetal DLK1 production (such as Temple syndrome[33]), 
and indicate that measuring maternal plasma DLK1 may have more general utility to 
differentiate healthy SGA from pathological complications of pregnancy requiring obstetric 
intervention.
Methods
Animal work
Mice—All animal work was carried out in accordance with UK Government Home Office 
licencing procedures. Mice were housed in a temperature and humidity controlled room 
(21 °C, 55 % humidity) with a 12 hour / 12 hour light-dark cycle. All mice were fed 
standard RM3 (E) diet (Special Diets Services) ad libitum, given fresh tap water daily and 
re-housed in clean cages weekly. Mice were weaned at 21 days postnatum, or a few days 
later if particularly small. Thereafter, they were housed in single-sex groups (5 per cage 
maximum) or occasionally singly housed, except when breeding.
The Dlk1 knock-out line (Dlk1tm1Srba) results in the replacement of 3.8 kb of the 
endogenous Dlk1 allele, including the Dlk1 promoter and its first three exons, with a

 neomycin resistance cassette[13]. The Dlk1 knock-out line was backcrossed onto the 
C57BL6/J background for at least 10 generations, and then routinely maintained by 
homozygous crosses (Dlk1 tm1Srba / tm1Srba x Dlk1 tm1Srba / tm1Srba). For experimental 
purposes, maternal heterozygotes (Dlk1 tm1Srba /+, Mats) and wild-types (Dlk1+/+, WTs) 
were generated. In all cases experimental WT mothers were the age-matched littermates of 
Mat females, both arising from an intercross between a Mat female and a stock C57BL6/J 
male.
Conditional Dlk1 deletion (Dlk1tm1.1Jvs) mice on a C57BL6/J background were obtained 
from JAX, backcrossed to generate homozygotes, and genotyped as described 
previously[20]. Meox2Cre heterozygous (Meox2tm1(Cre)Sor/+) females on a C57BL6/J 
background were maintained as heterozygotes as described[21]. Conditional mutants were 
generated by crossing Meox2Cre+/- females to Dlk1fl/fl males, and the recombination event 
was detected by PCR as described previously[20]. Meox2Cre-induced recombination in the 
fetal endothelium of the placenta was validated by crossing to the mTmG dual reporter line 
(Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato, -EGFP)Luo/J), obtained from JAX and genotyped as 
described previously[22]. These mice ubiquitously express a red fluorescent protein, except 
following recombination by Cre, which causes GFP to be expressed instead.
Experimental cohort—At eight weeks postnatum, female mice were weighed and 
excluded from the study if <15g. The blood glucose level was measured in study females 
and a 20-30 μl blood sample was taken from the tail vein for plasma extraction. Female mice 
were then mated with stud males in the crosses described in Fig 1b. Females were monitored 
once daily between 08:00 and 10:00 for the presence of a vaginal plug. The day of plug 
discovery was designated embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Additional eight-week-old female WT, 
Mat and Null mice were not mated, but remained in their home cage until the experimental 
start day (E0.5-equivalent). Blood sampling was repeated on E0.5, E7.5, E9.5, E11.5, E13.5 
and E15.5, between 10:45 and 12:30. From E0.5, the female mice were singly housed and 
provided with a non-limiting, weighed quantity of standard RM3 (E) diet. The remaining 
food weight was recorded at E7.5 and E15.5 as an indicator of food intake. On E15.5, the 
female mice were killed by terminal anaesthesia using ˜0.8 mg pentobarbitol (Dolethal; 
Vetoquinol) per gram body weight, injected intra-abdominally. Upon cessation of the twitch 
reflex, mice were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. Maternal and conceptus tissues were 
weighed and collected for processing. All dissections were carried out between 12:00 and 
17:00. The following exclusion criteria were applied to all mice: (1) if the female mouse did 
not show evidence of a vaginal plug after 11 days spent with a stud male; (2) if a pregnant 
mouse carried <5 or >12 live conceptuses at E15.5; (3) if a pregnant mouse with a mixed-
genotype litter had an unbalanced conceptus genotype ratio (>3:<1 genotype ratios, when 
the predicted Mendelian ratio was 1:1); (3) if upon dissection the female mouse was found 
to have a confounding anatomical abnormality; (4) if the female mouse died during the 
experiment.
Fasted cohort—On E15.5, the female mice were fasted for 4 hours then their tail blood 
glucose was measured. They were immediately killed by terminal anaesthesia and

 exsanguinated as above. All fasts were started between 09:15 and 11:00 and all dissections 
were carried out between 13:15 and 16:00.
Null-TG mice were generated by crossing Dlk1 70kb BAC transgenic mice (TgDlk1-70C) on 
a C57BL6/J background with the Dlk1tm1Srba knock-out line, and genotyped as described 
above and as previously described[19].
Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining was carried out on wax-embedded material as 
described previously[19], using an anti-DLK1 antibody(R&D AF8277).
Serum and tissue biochemistry—Enzymatic assay kits were used for determination of 
plasma FFAs (Roche), TAGs and glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich), and Cholesterol (Dade-
Behring). ELISA kits were used for measurements of Insulin (Crystalchem), Estradiol 
(Calbiotech), Leptin and Growth Hormone (Millipore), all according to manufacturers’ 
instructions. Blood glucose levels were measured using a glucose meter (One Touch Ultra, 
LifeSpan, UK). The methods for the mouse DLK1 ELISA and tissue determination of TAG 
were described previously [10]. The human DLK1 ELISA was used for measurement on 
maternal plasma according to the manufacturers’ instructions (Adipogen).
Real-time quantitative PCR—mRNAs were analysed by RT-PCR as described [10]. 
Quantification was performed using the relative standard curve method, and target gene 
expression was normalised to the expression of a reporter gene (mean of Hprt and α tubulin 
for liver samples, β actin for pituitary samples, and mean of all 3 for e15.5 placenta and 
embryo samples), the expression of which did not differ between the groups. All primers 
(sequences in Supplementary Table 10) amplified with efficiency greater than or equal to 
85%.
Statistical analysis of animal data—All statistical tests were performed using the 
GraphPad Prism Software version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego 
California USA. Data was tested for Normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and 
statistical evaluation applied accordingly. Tests, significance values and number of samples 
analysed are indicated in the respective figure/table legends, and all error bars represent the 
standard error of the mean (s.e.m).
Human data
Study design and participants—All samples and data were obtained from the 
Pregnancy Outcome Prediction (POP) study as described previously[25, 26]. Ethical 
approval for the study was obtained from the Cambridgeshire Research Ethics Committee 
(reference 07/H0308/163). Participants provided written consent. The plasma had been 
frozen on the day of collection and stored at -80°C. Measurement of DLK1 was performed 
blind to both the ultrasonic and outcome data.
Maternal characteristics of the SGA infants included in this analysis were representative of 
the whole POP study population (Supplementary Table 11). Since the analysis required a 36 
week sample, all SGA infants included were born at term whereas 15% of the SGA cases 
not included in the analysis were born preterm. Therefore, the SGA infants not included in

 the analysis weighed less at birth. However, the distribution of the birth weight percentile 
was not markedly different between the groups. The distribution of DLK1 concentration was 
fairly normal in cases and unmatched controls, and also the difference in DLK1 
concentration between cases and matched controls was normally distributed.
Analysis—The association between DLK1 and SGA was assessed by the ROC curve 
analysis using random controls as a comparison group and this analysis was repeated for 
each SGA phenotype. Group means of DLK1 were compared using independent two-sample 
t tests between SGA cases and random controls. Paired t tests were used to compare SGA 
cases and their matched controls. Power analyses were performed for both types of tests. 
Sample size calculation demonstrated that the paired analyses were well powered. We had 
90% power to detect a 7.3 ng/mL within-pair difference in DLK1 measurements (n=43 
pairs), assuming the observed standard deviation of the difference (14.5 ng/mL) and 
alpha=0.05 (two sided). The power to detect the observed difference of 9.44 ng/mL was 
98.6%. For the analysis of the different phenotypes of FGR we attained 80% power to detect 
a difference of a 9.6 ng/mL, assuming the average observed standard deviation of the 
difference within the extreme decile (9.6 ng/mL), n=10 pairs and alpha=0.05. In our 
unpaired overall analysis, we had 80% power to detect a 7.8 ng/mL difference in DLK1 
between the groups (sample sizes 45 and 41), assuming the observed combined standard 
deviation of the measurement (12.7 ng/mL) and alpha=0.05. All analyses were performed 
using Stata 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
