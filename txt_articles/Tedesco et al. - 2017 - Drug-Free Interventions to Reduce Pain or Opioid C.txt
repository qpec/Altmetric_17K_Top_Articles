IMPORTANCE There is increased interest in nonpharmacological treatments to reduce pain
after total knee arthroplasty. Yet, little consensus supports the effectiveness of these
interventions.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze evidence of nonpharmacological
interventions for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty.
DATA SOURCES Database searches of MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (OVID), Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of
Science (ISI database), Physiotherapy Evidence (PEDRO) database, and ClinicalTrials.gov for
the period between January 1946 and April 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials comparing nonpharmacological interventions
with other interventions in combination with standard care were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Three reviewers independently extracted the data from
selected articles using a standardized form and assessed the risk of bias. A random-effects
model was used for the analyses.
MAINOUTCOMESANDMEASURES Postoperativepainandconsumptionofopioidsandanalgesics.
RESULTS Of 5509 studies, 39 randomized clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis
(2391 patients). The most commonly performed interventions included continuous passive
motion, preoperative exercise, cryotherapy, electrotherapy, and acupuncture. Moderate-
certainty evidence showed that electrotherapy reduced the use of opioids (mean difference,
−3.50; 95% CI, −5.90 to −1.10 morphine equivalents in milligrams per kilogram per 48 hours;
P = .004; I2 = 17%) and that acupuncture delayed opioid use (mean difference, 46.17; 95% CI,
20.84 to 71.50 minutes to the first patient-controlled analgesia; P < .001; I2 = 19%). There was
low-certainty evidence that acupuncture improved pain (mean difference, −1.14; 95% CI, −1.90
to −0.38 on a visual analog scale at 2 days; P = .003; I2 = 0%). Very low-certainty evidence
showed that cryotherapy was associated with a reduction in opioid consumption (mean
difference, −0.13; 95% CI, −0.26 to −0.01 morphine equivalents in milligrams per kilogram per
48 hours; P = .03; I2 = 86%) and in pain improvement (mean difference, −0.51; 95% CI, −1.00
to −0.02 on the visual analog scale; P < .05; I2 = 62%). Low-certainty or very low-certainty
evidence showed that continuous passive motion and preoperative exercise had no pain
improvement and reduction in opioid consumption: for continuous passive motion, the mean
differences were −0.05 (95% CI, −0.35 to 0.25) on the visual analog scale (P = .74; I2 = 52%)
and 6.58 (95% CI, −6.33 to 19.49) opioid consumption at 1 and 2 weeks (P = .32, I2 = 87%), and
for preoperative exercise, the mean difference was −0.14 (95% CI, −1.11 to 0.84) on the Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index Scale (P = .78, I2 = 65%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis, electrotherapy and acupuncture after
total knee arthroplasty were associated with reduced and delayed opioid consumption.

here are 234 million major surgical procedures per-
formed every year worldwide, and most patients expe-
rience moderate to severe postoperative pain.1,2 Inad-
equate postoperative pain management has profound acute
effects, including immune system suppression, decreased mo-
bility that increases deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary em-
bolism rates, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia.3 Long-
term influences of poor pain management include transition to
chronic pain and prolonged narcotic consumption,4 which can
result in opioid dependence, an epidemic in the United States.5
First-line therapies to treat postoperative pain are pharma-
cological,includinganesthetics,opioids,andacetaminophen.6,7
Recently,nonpharmacologicalapproachestopainmanagement
aimed at reducing the use of prescription medications have
increased.8 Physiotherapy is effective in treating postoperative
painandquality-of-lifeimprovementandisstandardtreatment.9
However,othercommonlyusedinterventionsforpainmanage-
ment have conflicting evidence on their effectiveness.10,11 As
opioidaddictionbecomesanationalpriority,5theimportanceof
usingeffectivenonpharmacologicalstrategiesforpostoperative
pain is now a top scientific priority.12
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most fre-
quently performed surgical procedures worldwide. It is used
for patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis, and the goals
of surgery are to decrease pain, restore mobility and function,
and improve health-related quality of life.13 Total knee arthro-
plasty is associated with intense postoperative pain, and many
patients report moderate to severe postoperative pain past the
anticipated recovery period.14 Therefore, many nonpharma-
ceuticaltherapiesareperformedinthispopulation.10,11,15,16En-
suring effective therapies for postoperative pain manage-
ment is an important part of TKA care.17
We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to
evaluate the effectiveness of commonly used drug-free inter-
ventions for pain management after TKA. We gathered evi-
dence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on postopera-
tive pain as measured by established pain metrics and reduced
analgesic consumption, including opioids and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This comprehensive analy-
sis of nonpharmaceutical pain management therapies can in-
form practice and identify effective pain management regi-
mens that could also potentially reduce the prescribing of
opioids after surgery.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in
accord with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).18 The protocol was reg-
istered in the International Prospective Register of System-
atic Reviews (PROSPERO).19
Search Strategy
Databases
In an academic medical setting, we searched electronic data-
bases to identify relevant studies for the period between Janu-
ary 1946 and April 2016, including MEDLINE (PubMed),
EMBASE(OVID),CochraneCentralRegisterofControlledTrials
(CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web
of Science (ISI database), Physiotherapy Evidence (PEDRO)
database, and clinicaltrials.gov. We scanned reference lists of
selected reviews, original articles, and textbooks to find ad-
ditionalarticles.Weconductedagrayliteraturesearchforother
documents and hand searches of key conference proceed-
ings, journals, professional organizations’websites, national
joint replacement registries, and guideline clearing houses.
Snowball technique was applied to the search strategy.20
Search Criteria
Because our aim was to be as comprehensive as possible in the
systematic review, we did not place time or publication sta-
tus limits to the search except for restriction to the English lan-
guage. Two Chinese studies with English abstracts were con-
sidered; however, translation resources were not available to
include them. We used the following search string in each
database: (postoperative pain* OR postoperative pain
OR post-operative pain) AND (total knee* or total knee
arthroplasty OR total knee replacement OR TKA). Asterisks
are used to truncate words, so that every desinence after the
asterisks will be searched. To achieve the highest sensitivity,
we used a combination of keywords and indexed terms (eg,
PubMed Medical Subject Headings).
Patients, Interventions, Comparators, and Outcomes
Our primary search objective addressed the PICO (patients,
interventions,comparators,andoutcomes)question.Thesetar-
getsincluded(P)patientsundergoingprimaryTKA,(I)nonphar-
macological treatments for pain management (plus usual

Study Selection
Design
Postoperative pain management is generally layered, includ-
ing pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions.
Hence, we selected studies comparing nonpharmacological in-
terventionswithroutinepharmacologicaltreatmenteitherwith
Key Points
Question Which of the nonpharmacological interventions used
for postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty are effective?
Findings In a systematic review of 5509 studies, 39 randomized
clinical trials were included in a meta-analysis (2391 patients) and
demonstrated moderate-certainty evidence that electrotherapy
and acupuncture reduce or delay opioid consumption, but there is
low certainty or very low certainty that they improve pain.
Continuous passive motion and preoperative exercise do not
improve pain or reduce opioid consumption (low certainty or very
low certainty), and cryotherapy reduces opioid consumption but
does not improve pain (very low certainty).
Meaning After total knee arthroplasty, electrotherapy and
acupuncture were associated with reduced and delayed opioid
consumption.

 other nonpharmacological approaches or with only routine
pharmacological treatments. We restricted our meta-
analysis to RCTs in which patients were 18 years or older and
hadelectiveprimarysurgicalproceduresthatincludedallforms
of fixation (cemented, hybrid, or cementless), surgical ap-
proaches (medial, lateral, parapatellar, or minimally inva-
sive), and types of prostheses (constrained, semiconstrained,
or mobile platform).
Outcomes of Interest
Three of us (D.T., D.G., and K.R.D.) independently screened all
identified articles by scanning abstracts or portions of the text
to determine if they met the inclusion criteria. Any disagree-
ments were resolved through discussion and consensus be-
tween the reviewers. Postoperative pain relief was defined as
the mean difference in scores on the visual analog scale (VAS)
or the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis In-
dex Scale (WOMAC). Opioid and other analgesic consump-
tion was evaluated in terms of the mean difference in con-
sumption of morphine equivalents in milligrams per kilogram
per 48 hours, while other analgesic consumption was evalu-
ated as the mean difference in the number of tablets per day.
Time to first request for analgesia (patient-controlled analge-
sia [PCA]) in the acupuncture group was defined as minutes
from the end of the intervention to the first PCA.
Information about quality of life was not systematically
provided in the studies. Therefore, it was not included.
Intervention
We restricted our focus to commonly studied postoperative
pain interventions. These included continuous passive
motion (CPM), preoperative exercise, cryotherapy, electro-
therapy, and acupuncture.
Continuous passive motion consists of using an external
machine to provide regular movement to the knee using a pre-
determined range of motion (ROM). Theoretically, the re-
peated movements help increase ROM, while simultane-
ously improving pain.21
Preoperative exercise (or prehabilitation) involves ses-
sions performed by the patients in the weeks preceding sur-
gery. This regimen enables them to cope better with the physi-
cal stress associated with the surgical procedure and aids
postoperative rehabilitation efforts.22
Cryotherapy is based on applying cold to the surgical site
either through ice bags or cooled water to minimize tissue
trauma. The theory is that application of cooler substances re-
duces intra-articular temperatures, which interferes with the
conductionofnervesignalsandreduceslocalbloodflow.These
changes lead to decreased swelling and perceived pain.23
Electrotherapy (based on electrophysical agents) aims to
reduce pain and improve function through an energy trans-
fer to the body. These modalities include transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation and pulsed electromagnetic
fields.24
Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that
requires the insertion of needles at specific points on the body
to alleviate pain and other ailments. The plausible mecha-
nism of acupuncture analgesia is its effect on the central
nervous system, particularly a short-term and long-term
effect on μ-opioid receptors, and consequent regulation of
neurotransmitters and hormones.25,26
Study Quality Assessment
Two of us (D.T. and D.G.) independently assessed the risk of
bias of included studies using the parameters defined by the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
criteria.27 Disagreement was resolved through discussion and
consensus between the reviewers. Based on the information
providedfromincludedstudies,eachitemwasrecordedaslow
risk of bias, high risk of bias, or unclear (lack of information
or unknown risk of bias).
Two of us (D.T. and D.G.) independently assessed the qual-
ity of the body of evidence for the different outcomes consid-
ered through the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, a vali-
dated and widely implemented tool to rate the quality of
scientific evidence.28 According to the GRADE approach, we
assessed 5 domains, grading the strength of evidence for each
outcome.
Data Analysis and Synthesis
Three of us (D.T., D.G., and K.R.D.) independently extracted
the data from included articles. Key information was gath-
ered systematically using a standardized form. These vari-
ables included country, year of publication, number of par-
ticipants, intervention, age, sex, study design, duration of
intervention, outcome time points, statistical method, post-
operative pain, opioid or analgesic consumption, and sum-
mary of the results.
For the pain scores, we standardized the results to a single
scale by converting outcomes reported on a numerical rating
scale to a 10-point VAS. Where possible, the results were ex-
tractedmanuallyfromthepublishedfigures.Datainotherforms
(ie, median, interquartile range, and mean [95% CI]) were con-
verted to means (SDs) according to the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions.27 If data (eg, SDs and SEs)
were not presented in the original article, corresponding au-
thors were contacted to acquire the missing data, although no
responses were received. We also normalized data for pain re-
liefandanalgesicconsumption,opioidandotheranalgesiccon-
sumption, and time before the first analgesic treatment. Spe-
cifically, all data on opioid consumption were converted to
milligramsperkilogramper48hours,otheranalgesicconsump-
tion was converted to the number of tablets per day, and time
before the first analgesic treatment was converted to minutes.
We examined the evidence tables for clinical (partici-
pants, interventions, controls, outcomes, and measurement
tools)andmethodologicalheterogeneitytodeterminewhether
the studies were similar enough to perform a meta-analysis.29
Where appropriate to pool the results, we used weighted mean
differences for continuous data using the same measurement
scales and standardized mean differences for continuous out-
comes using different scales. We pooled both sets of sum-
mary statistics using the inverse variance method, which in-
cluded studies from different time points, and we conducted
sensitivity analyses by single time point.

ined heterogeneity graphically using forest plots and statisti-
cally by calculating the I2 statistic, which describes the
percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to
heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). We consid-
ered an I2 statistic greater than 50% to be substantially hetero-

Reviews of Interventions,27 in cases where the number of stud-
ies was less than 5 or studies were substantially heteroge-

ment. Our search yielded 5509 studies, of which 120 (112 from
selection and 8 added by hand and snowball searching) were
appropriate for further assessment. Of the 77 RCTs we read in
extenso, we extracted the data from 39 RCTs for our meta-
analysis (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Included studies were
published between 1991 and 2015.
Study Characteristics
A pooled total of 2391 patients were examined in the RCTs
(Table 1). We categorized the 39 RCTs based on 2 outcomes
(pain relief and analgesic consumption, including different
measures and types) and 5 interventions, including 18 stud-
ies in the CPM group (14 on pain and 5 on analgesics), 3 stud-
ies in the preoperative exercise group (all on pain), 12 studies
in the cryotherapy group (8 on pain and 10 on analgesics), 4
studies in the electrotherapy group (2 on pain and 2 on anal-
gesics), and 4 studies in the acupuncture group (2 on pain and
3 on analgesics). One study48 recurred in 3 different catego-
ries owing to multiple comparison groups within the article.
For the studies that did not provide sufficient data, we at-
tempted to contact authors but received no response.

Supplement).Themethodologicalheterogeneityreflectsthedif-
ferent range of interventions we examined. We identified that

Publication Bias
To address publication bias, we created funnel plots for all
analyses. No asymmetric patterns were seen (eFigures 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, and 29 in the Supplement).
Interventions
The key findings of the meta-analysis are summarized in
Table 2 for 2 types of pain scales and for 3 types of analgesic
outcomes. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the meta-analyses that
reported statistically significant results.
Assessed Outcomes and Evidence Synthesis
Pain Relief and Analgesic Consumption
We found that the quality of evidence was of low certainty or
very low certainty for pain improvement in all examined in-
terventions(Table2).Meta-analysisof2painreliefstudies(189
patients) suggested a significant improvement in experimen-
tal groups vs controls with electrotherapy, with mean differ-
ences of −1.95 (95% CI, −2.68 to −1.22; P < .001; I2 = 17%) on
the VAS at 1 month, −2.34 (95% CI, −4.49 to −0.19; P = .03;
I2 = 94%) on the VAS at 2 months, and −2.60 (95% CI, −5.12 to
−0.08; P = .04; I2 = 83%) on the VAS at 6 months (Figure 1A).
Meta-analysis of 3 studies (230 patients) suggested a signifi-
cantimprovementinexperimentalgroupsvscontrolswithacu-
puncture, with a mean difference of −1.14 (95% CI, −1.90 to
−0.38; P = .003; I2 = 0%) on the VAS at 6 months (Figure 1B).
Meta-analysis of 8 studies (1383 patients) showed a mean dif-
ference with cryotherapy of −0.51 (95% CI, −1.00 to −0.02;
P < .05; I2 = 62%), but all subgroup analyses showed no sta-
tistically significant mean differences (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment). Meta-analysis of 9 studies (1025 patients) suggested no
significant improvement in experimental groups vs controls
with CPM (mean differences, −0.05; 95% CI, −0.35 to 0.25;
P = .74; I2 = 52% on the VAS at 1 week and 6 months and −0.20;
95% CI, −0.62 to 0.23; P = .54; I2 = 0% on the CPM WOMAC at
6 weeks and 6 months) (eFigure 3 and eFigure 4 in the Supple-
ment) or with preoperative exercise (mean difference, −0.14;
95% CI, −1.11 to 0.84; P = .78; I2 = 65% on the WOMAC at 6 and
12 weeks) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
Toaddresspossibleoverestimationthatcouldoriginatefrom
thestudydesign(ie,painasaprimaryorsecondaryoutcome),we
conducted sensitivity subgroup analyses. No significant differ-
enceswerefound(eFigures20,21,22,and23intheSupplement).

−6.33,to19.49opioidsinmilligramsperhour;P = .32;I2 = 87%)
forCPM(eFigure8intheSupplement).Preoperativeexercisestud-
ies did not report data on opioid consumption.
To address opioid consumption changes across the study
period, we conducted sensitivity analyses stratifying for pe-
riod (before or after 2000). The results were not significant
(eFigure 39 and eFigure 40 in the Supplement).
Time Before the First Analgesic Treatment
In 2 studies (124 patients), we assessed time to first PCA in the
acupuncture group and found moderate-certainty evidence
that acupuncture significantly increases this period (mean dif-
ference,46.17;95%CI,20.84-71.50minutes;P < .001;I2 = 19%)
(eFigure 9 in the Supplement). Also, a subgroup analysis car-
ried out in 1 study69 revealed a stronger difference in the acu-
puncture group compared with controls, with a mean differ-
ence of 57.90 (95% CI, 6.52-99.28 minutes; P = .006; I2 = not
applicable).
Conflict of Interest of Included Studies
Authors of 7 studies reported at least 1 conflict of interest state-
ment. Only 3 studies32,33,49 explicitly identified the funding
sources (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

alleviate pain (measured at different time points and using dif-
ferent scales) or reduce opioid consumption.
Electrotherapyandacupunctureareknowntoreducepost-
operative pain. Electrotherapy is thought to decrease pain by
stimulating the pain fibers with a nonpainful stimulus that
blocks painful stimuli from reaching the brain and is free of
adverse effects.10 One study70 recommended electrotherapy
to reduce analgesic use for various surgical procedures. Our
findings suggest that electrotherapy may not only reduce early
pain but also change the long-term trajectory of recovery from
painafterTKA.Wefoundevidencethatelectrotherapychanged
pain severity at 1, 2, and 6 months, with increasing effect sizes
over time. Hence, electrotherapy might be considered an ef-
fective nonpharmacological ancillary intervention to stan-
dard pharmacological therapy for long-term pain improve-
ment. This finding is an important and underappreciated
contribution to the literature that examines factors influenc-
ingthepropensitytodevelopchronicpainaftersurgery,anarea
of significant general interest in clinical literature.4 However,
because the quality of the studies analyzed for this outcome
was very low, more high-quality RCTs on long-term pain im-
provement after electrotherapy are needed.
Our findings showed that acupuncture pain relief ben-
efits concentrate in the early postoperative phase but are in-
effective in the long run. A delay in opioid consumption can
be considered a proxy of lower pain levels; high postopera-
tivepaincanleadtochronicpain.3Ourresultssuggestthatacu-
puncture led to a modest delay in PCA requests, leading to pos-
siblebenefitsinthiscriticaltimewindow.Similarly,othershave
found that acupuncture provides significant pain improve-
ment in patients undergoing TKA and total hip arthroplasty in
the first 2 days after surgery.16 The acupuncture studies had
less risk of bias than other modalities, so our conclusions re-
garding their benefit are more secure. If confirmed in future
studies, our findings support the use of both electrotherapy
and acupuncture after TKA.
We found less evidence that cryotherapy reduced opioid
and NSAID consumption. While a Cochrane review article re-
ported a small benefit of cryotherapy for pain at 2 days after
surgerybutnotat1and3days,23ourresultsdemonstratedvery
low-certainty evidence for this intervention on postopera-
tive analgesia after TKA. More research about this interven-
tion could focus on opioid consumption effects.
The CPM results are particularly notable. Continuous pas-
sive motion is commonly used after TKA, with the 2 pro-
posed benefits of improved function and reduced pain. How-
ever, recent work has not shown the usefulness of CPM in
improving functionality and rehabilitation.11 The RCTs in-
cluded in our meta-analysis found very low-certainty evi-
dence that CPM reduces opioid consumption during the early
postoperative phase and found low-certainty or very low-
certainty evidence that CPM provides no improvement in per-
ceived pain. Our findings are consistent with a Cochrane re-
view article that also found no benefits of CPM on function,
pain, or quality of life after TKA.11 These results need to be cau-
tiouslyconsideredbecauseCPMisnotwithoutrisk.71Also,CPM
is an expensive and time-consuming procedure.33,71 Because
the results of other studies have suggested that CPM is inef-
fective in improving functionality11 and that CPM is associ-
ated with increased hospital length of stay,71 careful consid-
eration should be exercised before applying this treatment.
Our study also found little evidence to support that pre-
operative exercise improves postoperative pain and thus adds
to conflicting literature. Several studies have reported that pre-
operativeexercisehadnosignificantbenefitinimprovingfunc-
tionality, quality of life, or pain for patients after TKA,72,73
whereas others found that the intervention improved postop-
erative pain, hospital length of stay, and physical function af-
tervarioussurgicalprocedures.74However,giventhepoorqual-
ity of the evidence, our results do not support the use of
preoperative exercise for patients after TKA and advocate for
further high-quality studies on this topic.
Limitations
Several limitations should be considered before interpreting
these findings. First, for each intervention and outcome, we
could only include a small number of studies in the analysis
because of high heterogeneity in the timing and type of inter-
ventions. To address this issue, we pooled studies from dif-
ferent time points to obtain larger sample sizes, and sub-
group analyses showed results similar to the overall findings
(eFigures 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38 in the Supple-
ment). Age and sex were not differently distributed in the
groups (treatment vs control as shown in the meta-
regressions) (eFigure 41 and eFigure 42 in the Supplement).
Second, studies often showed a high risk or unclear risk of bias,
which may have led to overestimations or underestimations
of the reported effects. However, we assessed the quality of
evidence through a validated tool and took into account the
level of certainty of evidence for each outcome. Third, most
studies did not achieve full masking, which also may have
causedoverestimationofeffectsinvariousmeta-analysescon-
ducted. Fourth, some studies lacked sufficient data to mea-
sure dispersion for the effect measurement (SD or SE). We
attempted to address this problem by contacting authors but
never obtained a response.
Conclusions
Although past studies8,10,11,16,23,73 have investigated indi-
vidual nonpharmaceutical interventions for different postop-
erative outcomes after TKA, to our knowledge, this meta-
analysis is the first comprehensive study to examine the most
frequent treatments, adding new evidence on drug consump-
tion. As prescription opioid use is under national scrutiny and
because surgery has been identified as an avenue for addic-
tion, it is important to recognize effective alternatives to stan-
dard pharmacological therapy, which remains the first op-
tion for treatment.5,12 Our study provides modest but clinically
significant evidence that electrotherapy and acupuncture can
potentially reduce and delay opioid consumption. However,
strong supporting research is further needed. Evidence for
other interventions, although limited by the quality of the
underlying literature, had less support.
