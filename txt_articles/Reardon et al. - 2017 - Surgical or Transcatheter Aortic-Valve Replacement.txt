BACKGROUND
Although transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is an accepted alternative 
to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high surgical risk, less 
is known about comparative outcomes among patients with aortic stenosis who 
are at intermediate surgical risk.
METHODS
We evaluated the clinical outcomes in intermediate-risk patients with severe, 
symptomatic aortic stenosis in a randomized trial comparing TAVR (performed 
with the use of a self-expanding prosthesis) with surgical aortic-valve replacement. 
The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or disabling 
stroke at 24 months in patients undergoing attempted aortic-valve replacement. We 
used Bayesian analytical methods (with a margin of 0.07) to evaluate the noninfe-
riority of TAVR as compared with surgical valve replacement.
RESULTS
A total of 1746 patients underwent randomization at 87 centers. Of these patients, 
1660 underwent an attempted TAVR or surgical procedure. The mean (±SD) age 
of the patients was 79.8±6.2 years, and all were at intermediate risk for surgery 
(Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality, 4.5±1.6%). At 24 months, 
the estimated incidence of the primary end point was 12.6% in the TAVR group 
and 14.0% in the surgery group (95% credible interval [Bayesian analysis] for dif-
ference, −5.2 to 2.3%; posterior probability of noninferiority, >0.999). Surgery was 
associated with higher rates of acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, and transfu-
sion requirements, whereas TAVR had higher rates of residual aortic regurgitation 
and need for pacemaker implantation. TAVR resulted in lower mean gradients and 
larger aortic-valve areas than surgery. Structural valve deterioration at 24 months 
did not occur in either group.
CONCLUSIONS
TAVR was a noninferior alternative to surgery in patients with severe aortic steno-
sis at intermediate surgical risk, with a different pattern of adverse events associ-
ated with each procedure. (Funded by Medtronic; SURTAVI ClinicalTrials.gov 
number, NCT01586910.)

T
ranscatheter aortic-valve replace-
ment (TAVR) with the use of a self-expand-
ing prosthesis is superior to medical ther-
apy in patients with severe, symptomatic aortic 
stenosis in whom surgical aortic-valve replace-
ment has been associated with prohibitive risk.1 
Among patients who are at high risk for standard 
surgery, TAVR may be the preferred option.2-4 
The adoption of TAVR in patients with aortic 
stenosis at high risk for surgery has been rapid, 
as shown by enrollment in the ongoing Society 
of Thoracic Surgeons–American College of Car-
diology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry.5
The comparative efficacy of TAVR and sur-
gery has been less well studied among patients 
with aortic stenosis who are at lower surgical 
risk.6-8 A randomized trial comparing balloon-
expandable TAVR and surgery among interme-
diate-risk patients showed that TAVR was non-
inferior to surgery 2 years after randomization.9 
Given the higher rates of residual aortic-valve 
regurgitation and pacemaker use in TAVR pa-
tients,2 and more frequent stroke, atrial fibrilla-
tion, acute kidney injury, and blood transfusions 
in surgical patients,2 a randomized comparison 
of TAVR and surgery among intermediate-risk 
patients was warranted.
The purpose of the Surgical Replacement and 
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (SURTAVI) 
trial was to compare the safety and efficacy of 
TAVR performed with the use of a self-expanding 
bioprosthesis with surgical aortic-valve replace-
ment in patients who were deemed to be at inter-
mediate risk for surgery.
Methods
Trial Design
The SURTAVI trial was a multinational, random-
ized, noninferiority clinical trial designed to com-
pare the safety and efficacy of TAVR and surgery 
in patients with symptomatic, severe aortic steno-
sis at intermediate surgical risk. Eligible patients 
were recruited at 87 centers and underwent ran-
domization in a 1:1 ratio to undergo TAVR with 
the use of a self-expanding bioprosthesis or sur-
gery (Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this arti-
cle at NEJM.org). The trial was conducted in 
compliance with the International Conference 
on Harmonisation and the Declaration of Hel-
sinki. It was approved by the local institutional 
review board or medical ethics committee at each 
center. All the patients provided written informed 
consent.
Medtronic funded the trial and developed the 
protocol (available at NEJM.org) in collaboration 
with the executive committee. Medtronic repre-
sentatives were responsible for site selection, 
data monitoring, and trial management. An in-
dependent academic clinical-events committee 
(Cardialysis) adjudicated all end points using 
standard definitions (Table S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Paradigm Biostatistics per-
formed the Bayesian analysis for all end-point 
comparisons; an independent statistical consul-
tant (Berry Consultants) validated the primary 
Bayesian end-point analysis. The data and safety 
monitoring board provided study oversight with 
periodic safety review and recommendations re-
lating to trial design and conduct.
The first and third authors prepared all drafts 
of the manuscript, and all the authors made the 
decision to submit the manuscript for publica-
tion. No one who is not an author contributed to 
the writing of the manuscript. The authors attest 
that the trial was performed according to the 
protocol and vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the reported data.
Patient Selection
Eligible patients with symptomatic, severe aortic 
stenosis were determined by the local multidis-
ciplinary heart team to be at intermediate surgi-
cal risk, which was defined as an estimated risk 
of 30-day surgical death of 3 to 15%, according to 
the criteria of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 
Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM), as well 
as such nontraditional factors as coexisting ill-
nesses, frailty, and disability. Severe aortic-valve 
stenosis was defined as an initial aortic-valve 
area of 1.0 cm2 or less or an aortic-valve area 
index of less than 0.6 cm2 per square meter of 
body-surface area and a mean gradient of more 
than 40 mm Hg or a maximum aortic velocity of 
more than 4 m per second at rest or with dobuta-
mine provocation in patients with a left ventricu-
lar ejection fraction of less than 55% or a Doppler 
velocity index of less than 0.25 on resting echo-
cardiography. A detailed list of inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria is provided in Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. An international screen-
ing committee confirmed patient eligibility (Ta-
ble S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Surgical or Transcatheter Aortic-Valve Replacement
Trial Procedures
The randomization of patients was stratified ac-
cording to clinical site and the need for surgical 
coronary revascularization, as recommended by 
the multidisciplinary heart team. The choice and 
size of the surgical bioprosthesis were left to the 
discretion of the surgeon. Patients in the surgery 
group underwent coronary revascularization at 
the time of aortic-valve replacement if needed. 
After the procedure, a daily regimen of at least 
81 mg of aspirin was prescribed indefinitely, in-
cluding for patients who were receiving warfarin.
Among the patients in the TAVR group, the 
selection of the bioprosthesis size and access 
site were based on preprocedural computed to-
mography. The CoreValve bioprosthesis was used 
in 724 of 863 patients (84%); the Evolut R bio-
prosthesis was used in 139 (16%) (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Transfemoral access 
was preferred; subclavian or direct aortic approach-
es were used in patients with unsuitable ilio-
femoral anatomy. The use of embolic protection 
during the TAVR procedure was not permitted. 
Percutaneous coronary intervention, when indi-
cated, was performed either as a staged procedure 
before TAVR or at the time of TAVR as a con-
comitant procedure. Dual antiplatelet therapy with 
aspirin (at a dose of 81 to 100 mg) and clopi-
dogrel (75 mg) was recommended for 3 months 
after the procedure; thereafter, the same dose of 
either aspirin or clopidogrel was recommended as 
indefinite monotherapy. Patients requiring war-
farin or another anticoagulant were treated with 
antiplatelet monotherapy after the procedure.
Trial End Points
The primary end point was a composite of death 
from any cause or disabling stroke at 24 months. 
(Trial end-point definitions are provided in Table 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.) Disabling 
stroke was defined according to the criteria of the 
Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2).10 
All the patients were seen by a trained neurolo-
gist or stroke specialist, and neurologic events 
were adjudicated by a neurologist on the clinical-
events committee.
Prespecified analyses of death from any cause 
or disabling stroke at 12 months were completed 
for selected subgroups (Fig. S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Secondary end points included 
major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
events, which consisted of death from any cause, 
myocardial infarction, all types of strokes, and 
any reintervention. Additional secondary safety 
and efficacy end points are described in the pro-
tocol and in the Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
An independent echocardiographic core labo-
ratory at the Mayo Clinic provided serial echocar-
diographic assessments with the use of VARC-2 
criteria,10 which include aortic-valve hemodynam-
ics and total aortic and paravalvular regurgitation 
through 24 months. Health-related quality-of-life 
assessments through 24 months were provided by 
the clinical sites with the use of the Kansas City 
cardiomyopathy questionnaire (KCCQ).11 (KCCQ 
summary scores range from 0 to 100, with a 
correlation between scores of >60 and New York 
Heart Association class I or II and a 10-point 
increase corresponding to moderate clinical im-
provement.)
Statistical Analysis
The trial design called for the use of Bayesian 
statistical methods. We determined that TAVR 
would be declared noninferior to surgery for the 
primary outcome if the posterior probability of 
noninferiority with a margin of 0.07 was more 
than 0.971, as calculated by means of Bayesian 
analysis. The prespecified value of 0.971 was 
selected empirically through simulation to achieve 
a type I error at an alpha level of less than 0.05. 
A sample size of 1600 attempted aortic-valve 
procedures was chosen on the basis of an as-
sumed 17% incidence of death from any cause or 
disabling stroke at 24 months among the pa-
tients undergoing surgery. A Bayesian interim 
analysis was prespecified when 1400 patients had 
reached the 12-month follow-up.
We evaluated the primary and secondary end 
points in a modified intention-to-treat population 
of patients who had undergone randomization 
and an attempted procedure. We imputed the 
outcome of patients without a known outcome at 
24 months according to the prespecified statisti-
cal model, which was based on the patient’s last 
known status at the latest known time point: at the 
time of the procedure or at 1 month, 6 months, 
12 months, or 18 months. A sensitivity analysis 
was performed to account for missing data, in-
cluding the patients who were lost to follow-up 
or withdrew from the study. Secondary end 
points were tested with the use of a hierarchical 
testing procedure. Primary and secondary end

points were also analyzed in the intention-to-treat 
population. Details with respect to the analysis 
populations, sensitivity analyses, and hierarchi-
cal testing methods are provided in the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix.
We used a Bayesian analogue of a two-sample 
t-test to compare continuous variables as means 
(±SD) and a Bayesian version of a comparison of 
proportions to compare categorical variables as 
frequencies and percentages. Event rates are 
summarized as Bayesian posterior medians with 
95% credible intervals, which were calculated 
from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. We also 
performed Kaplan–Meier survival analyses.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
A total of 1746 patients underwent randomiza-
tion at 87 centers in the United States, Europe, 
and Canada from June 19, 2012, to June 30, 2016 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
modified intention-to-treat population included 
1660 patients (864 in the TAVR group and 796 
in the surgery group). In this population, 2 pa-
tients in the TAVR group and 1 in the surgery 
group did not undergo implantation. In addition, 
TAVR was performed in 2 patients in the surgery 
group and surgery was performed in 1 patient in 
the TAVR group, which resulted in 863 patients 
who underwent the assigned procedure in the 
TAVR group and 794 who underwent the assigned 
procedure in the surgery group (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Revascularization was 
recommended in 332 of 1660 patients (20%) in 
the two groups.
Baseline demographic and clinical character-
istics of the patients are provided in Table 1. The 
mean age was 79.8±6.2 years. All the patients 
were at intermediate risk for surgery (STS-PROM 
value, 4.5±1.6%), and most had coexisting ill-
nesses, including diabetes (in 34.5%), chronic 
lung disease (in 34.5%), and frailty (5-meter gait 
speed of >6 seconds, 52.3%; falls within 6 months, 
12.2%). A complete list of coexisting illnesses, 
including frailty and disability, is provided in 
Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix.
A total of 71 patients in the intention-to-treat 
population who were assigned to the surgery 
group did not undergo the procedure (Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). A comparison of 
these patients with the 796 patients who under-
went surgery identified no differences in base-
line demographic characteristics, surgical frailty, 
disability, or coexisting illnesses (Tables S6 and 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Procedural Outcomes
Early (≤30 day) acute kidney injury stage 2 or 3 
and new or worsening atrial fibrillation occurred 
more often in the surgery group than in the 
TAVR group, whereas major vascular complica-
tions and the need for permanent pacemaker 
implantation occurred more often in the TAVR 
group (Table 2). There were no significant differ-
ences in 24-month mortality among the patients 
who required a new pacemaker (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Transfusions were 
more common in the surgery group than in the 
TAVR group, including an increase by a factor of 
3.5 in the need for four or more red-cell units 
(Table 2). Other outcomes were similar in the two 
groups. A detailed description of procedural out-
comes is provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Primary End Point
The primary Bayesian analysis was performed in 
1660 patients in the modified intention-to-treat 
population when 1400 patients had reached 12 
months of follow-up. The incidence of the pri-
mary end point at 24 months was 12.6% in the 
TAVR group and 14.0% in the surgery group 
(95% credible interval [Bayesian analysis] for dif-
ference, −5.2 to 2.3%; posterior probability of non-
inferiority, >0.999) (Table 3 and Fig. 1). Similar 
results were found in the intention-to-treat pop-
ulation (13.2% in the TAVR group and 14.1% in 
the surgery group; 95% credible interval for dif-
ference, −4.7 to 2.7%; posterior probability of 
noninferiority, >0.999) (Table S8 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). A sensitivity analysis that 
was performed to account for patients who were 
lost to follow-up showed no important differ-
ence in the primary conclusions (Results section 
in the Supplementary Appendix). At 24 months, 
the rate of death from any cause was 11.4% in 
the TAVR group and 11.6% in the surgery group 
(95% credible interval for difference, −3.8 to 
3.3%); the rate of disabling stroke was also 
similar in the two groups (Table 3 and Fig. 1). 
No significant differences with respect to geo-
graphic region or trial site were found for the 
primary outcome. Prespecified subgroup analy-
ses of death from any cause or disabling stroke

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
at 12 months identified no significant differences 
in the treatment effect between TAVR and sur-
gery (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary End Points
Results of hierarchical analyses of the secondary 
end points are provided in Table S9 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. New York Heart Associa-
tion symptoms improved significantly in the two 
groups from baseline, an improvement that 
persisted throughout the 24-month follow-up 
period (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Quality of life, as measured by the KCCQ sum-
mary score, improved significantly in the two 
groups through 24 months of follow-up; the 
TAVR group had a higher proportion of patients 
with improvement at 1 month than did the sur-
gery group (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Echocardiographic Findings
Aortic-valve hemodynamics improved in both the 
TAVR group and the surgery group (Fig. 2). The 
TAVR group had lower mean aortic-valve gradi-
ents and larger aortic-valve areas than did the 
surgery group. Moderate or severe residual para-
valvular regurgitation was more common in the 
TAVR group at 1 year (5.3% in the TAVR group 
vs. 0.6% in the surgery group; 95% credible inter-
val for difference, 2.8 to 6.8%) (Table S10 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In this trial, we found that TAVR was statisti-
cally noninferior to surgery in patients who were 
deemed to be at intermediate surgical risk by a 
multidisciplinary heart team. We found that the 
risk of death or disabling stroke at 24 months 
ranged from 12.6 to 14.0% among the patients 
in our trial. Surgery was associated with higher 
rates of acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, and 
transfusion requirements, whereas TAVR had 
higher rates of residual aortic regurgitation and 
need for pacemaker implantation. TAVR resulted 
in better aortic-valve hemodynamics than surgery, 
and neither TAVR nor surgery showed evidence of 
structural valve deterioration at 24 months.
A portfolio of randomized clinical trials com-
pared TAVR with surgery in patients at varying 
surgical risk.1,2,9,12,13 This expanding evidence 
base suggests that the highest mortality benefit 
for TAVR over surgery (or medical therapy) is 
seen in patients at high surgical risk.1,2,12-14 
Among the patients at high risk, those in the 
TAVR group had a lower rate of death than did

of TAVR over surgery will be identified among 
patients at lower surgical risk. Although a com-

Figure 1. Noninferiority Analysis and Time-to-Event Curves for the Primary End Point.
In this Bayesian analysis, the posterior probability distribution for the difference in the primary end point (death from any cause or dis-
abling stroke at 24 months) between patients who underwent transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) and those who underwent 
surgical replacement confirmed that the noninferiority margin for TAVR was met (Panel A). Also shown are time-to-event curves for the 
primary end point (Panel B), death from any cause (Panel C), and disabling stroke (Panel D), findings that were similar in the two groups. 
In Panels B, C, and D, the insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis.

Surgical or Transcatheter Aortic-Valve Replacement
stroke in intermediate-risk populations. The mean 
STS-PROM value was higher in PARTNER IIA 
than in our trial (5.8% vs. 4.5%), as was the 
observed-to-expected 30-day surgical mortality 
ratio (0.71 vs. 0.38).14 The observed-to-expected 
ratio in our trial was one of the lowest such ratios 
for surgical mortality that have been reported in 
randomized studies to date.2,9,13 We attribute this 
result to the best practices of our cardiac surgi-
cal teams, which underscores the importance of 
the similar 30-day rates of death in the TAVR 
group and the surgery group (2.2% and 1.7%, 
respectively). The rates of death from any cause 
at 24 months were similar in the TAVR group 
and the surgery group (11.4% and 11.6%, re-
spectively), which supports the similarity of the 
two techniques at the time of this midterm fol-
low-up. This finding also suggests that the pa-
tients in our trial were at lower risk than those 
in the PARTNER IIA trial, which showed 
24-month mortality of 16.7% with TAVR and 
18.0% with surgery.9
Surgical risk assessment in intermediate-risk 
patients is often problematic, even for an expe-
rienced multidisciplinary heart team. Conven-
tional risk scores, such as the STS-PROM,16 may 
be supplemented with other nontraditional sur-
gical risk factors, such as coexisting conditions, 
frailty, and disability.17,18 We defined our lower 
threshold for the heart-team assessment of 30-
day surgical risk at 3%, and our results provide 
reassurance that TAVR is an alternative to sur-
gery in patients at the lower boundaries of inter-
mediate risk.
Neurologic complications associated with 
aortic-valve replacement are increasingly recog-
nized as critical outcome measures in compara-
tive trials. At 24 months, we found a numeri-
cally lower rate of disabling stroke in the TAVR 
group than in the surgery group, although the 
difference was not significant; these findings 
were similar to those in a previous randomized 
trial involving patients at increased risk for sur-
gery.3,4 We performed neurologic assessments 
before and after the procedures in the two 
groups, although detailed cognitive testing was 
not performed and embolic protection devices 
were not allowed during the procedure. Similar 
to the findings of the pivotal study involving 
patients at high surgical risk,2 we found that the 
rates of acute kidney injury and atrial fibrillation 
were higher in the surgery group, whereas the 
rates of residual aortic regurgitation and perma-
nent pacemaker implantation were higher in the 
TAVR group. Although we might have expected 
a lower rate of permanent pacemaker implanta-
tion with the introduction of the Evolut R valve 
on the basis of rates of 11.7% and 16.4% in previ-
ous studies,19,20 the rates among patients who 
received the CoreValve (25.5%) and the Evolut R 
valve (26.7%) were similar. Whether this finding 
is related to the small number of Evolut R valves 
that were implanted late in the trial is unknown 
and will require further study.1,2,19,20 The 24- 
month mortality among patients who required a 
new pacemaker was similar to that in the overall 
population.
Aortic-valve hemodynamics were substantially 
improved in both the TAVR group and the sur-
gery group and probably contributed to the reduc-
tion in symptoms and improvement in health-
related outcomes that we observed. We identified 
lower aortic-valve gradients and larger aortic-
valve areas in patients treated with TAVR, find-
ings that probably stemmed from the supraannu-
lar design of the self-expanding bioprosthesis. 
Long-term follow-up will be needed to deter-
mine the clinical effect of the improved hemo-
dynamics in the TAVR group. Although we did 
not find evidence of structural valve deterioration 
at this midterm follow-up, more extended follow-
up is needed.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Our study has several limitations. A relatively 
high frequency of unplanned withdrawals oc-
curred in the surgery group, primarily because 
of the withdrawal of patient consent after ran-
domization. We could not identify differences in 
baseline demographic characteristics among the 
patients who underwent the assigned surgery 
and those who did not. The next-generation Evo-
lut R bioprosthesis was used in less than 20% of 
the patients. We also recognized that long-term 
follow-up is needed, since a 24-month end-point 
analysis provides incomplete information about 
the life cycle of TAVR as compared with surgical 
bioprostheses.
In conclusion, in a comparison between TAVR 
and surgical replacement in patients with symp-
tomatic, severe aortic stenosis at intermediate 
risk for surgery, TAVR was a statistically non-
inferior alternative to surgery with respect to 
death from any cause or disabling stroke at 24 
months. However, each procedure had a different 
pattern of adverse events.
