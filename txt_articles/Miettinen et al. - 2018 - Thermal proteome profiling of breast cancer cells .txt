Abstract
Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for metastatic estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer. In addition to G1 cell cycle arrest,
palbociclib treatment results in cell senescence, a phenotype that
is not readily explained by CDK4/6 inhibition. In order to identify a
molecular mechanism responsible for palbociclib-induced senes-
cence, we performed thermal proteome profiling of MCF7 breast
cancer cells. In addition to affecting known CDK4/6 targets, palbo-
ciclib induces a thermal stabilization of the 20S proteasome,
despite not directly binding to it. We further show that palbociclib
treatment increases proteasome activity independently of the
ubiquitin pathway. This leads to cellular senescence, which can be
counteracted
by
proteasome
inhibitors.
Palbociclib-induced
proteasome activation and senescence is mediated by reduced
proteasomal association of ECM29. Loss of ECM29 activates the
proteasome, blocks cell proliferation, and induces a senescence-
like phenotype. Finally, we find that ECM29 mRNA levels are
predictive of relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients treated
with endocrine therapy. In conclusion, thermal proteome profiling
identifies the proteasome and ECM29 protein as mediators of
palbociclib activity in breast cancer cells.

Introduction
The two closely related cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6
together with their binding partners cyclin D1, D2, and D3 are key
regulators of growth and cell proliferation. The main mechanism by
which CDK4/6–cyclin D complexes drive cell cycle progression is
through phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) and
related p107 and p130 proteins, which are among the few known
CDK4/6 substrates (Anders et al, 2011). The phosphorylation of
RB1 drives cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase by allowing
E2F transcription factor to induce coordinated transcription of genes
required for DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. Nonetheless,
cyclin D and CDK4/6 are not universally required for cell cycle
progression in most cell types during development (Kozar &
Sicinski, 2005).
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women with close
to two million cases per year globally. CDK4/6 inhibition has been
recognized to have therapeutic potential in estrogen receptor-
positive (ER+) breast cancers, which constitute up to 75% of all
breast cancers. In breast tissue, the CDK4/cyclin D1 axis appears
critical for cancer initiation, as demonstrated using animal models
and analysis of human breast cancer specimens (Bartkova et al,
1994; Landis et al, 2006; Yu et al, 2006; Choi et al, 2012). In addi-
tion, CDK4/cyclin D inhibition may be additionally beneficial for the
treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and
RAS-driven breast cancers (Yu et al, 2001; Goel et al, 2016) and
potentially many other cancers because cyclin D1 displays most
frequent somatic copy number aberrations of all cancer genes
(Leiserson et al, 2015).
Palbociclib (PD-0332991/Ibrance) is a potent and selective
CDK4/6 inhibitor based on analysis of 36 other kinases tested
(Fry et al, 2004; Toogood et al, 2005). In cell models, palbociclib

 displays preferential activity in ER+ as well as HER2-amplified
cell lines (Finn et al, 2009). In a recent phase 3 trial, the combi-
natory treatment with palbociclib and fulvestrant, a selective

receptor
degrader,
more
than
doubled
the
median
progression-free
survival
as
compared
with
fulvestrant
alone
(Turner et al, 2015; Cristofanilli et al, 2016). While broader speci-
ficity CDK inhibitors have performed poorly in clinical trials, it is
not entirely clear why a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor displays such
a remarkable therapeutic response (Sherr et al, 2015). In addition
to the blockade of cancer cell proliferation, palbociclib also
induces senescence (Anders et al, 2011) and displays other unex-
pected responses such as reduction in tumor volume without
inducing apoptosis (Choi et al, 2012). Many RB1-deficient breast
cancer cells display reduced DNA replication in response to
palbociclib (Dean et al, 2010), and reduced levels of phosphory-
lated RB1 alone do not explain the oncosuppressive effects of
palbociclib, at least in liposarcoma patients where such data are
available (Kovatcheva et al, 2015). Similarly, palbociclib-mediated
growth inhibition cannot be fully recapitulated by knockdown of
CDK4/6 in breast cancer cells (Vijayaraghavan et al, 2017). Thus,
while the RB1 pathway is clearly important for CDK4/6-mediated
cell cycle progression, the therapeutic response to palbociclib
potentially includes additional CDK4/6- or RB1-independent activi-
ties. Consistently, some of the cellular responses to palbociclib,
such as senescence, have been reversed or augmented by knock-
downs of seemingly unrelated proteins (Jansen et al, 2017; Rapis-
arda
et al,
2017),
suggesting
that
the
mode
of
action
of
palbociclib is more complex than previously appreciated. Palboci-
clib is therefore likely to have unanticipated, clinically relevant
targets beyond cell cycle inhibition. Furthermore, clinical trials
with palbociclib have evaluated the role of possible biomarkers,
but, for example, gain of cyclin D1, loss of p16, PI-3 kinase muta-
tions, or hormone-receptor expression level are not predictive of
the treatment response (Finn et al, 2015; Cristofanilli et al, 2016).
Thus, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that could
predict the patient population who would benefit most from
palbociclib.
Cellular thermal shift assay (CeTSA) has recently emerged as a
novel method to identify drug engagement with target proteins in
live cells (Martinez Molina et al, 2013; Miettinen & Bjorklund, 2014;
Savitski et al, 2014; Huber et al, 2015; Reinhard et al, 2015). This
method is based on observing the changes in the thermal stability of
a protein, which may be due to direct drug binding, drug-induced
conformational changes, binding to other cellular components or
post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. When
combined with mass spectrometry, the thermal stability changes in
proteins can be quantified using a quantitative proteomic approach,
holding great promise for identifying drug targets in live cells
(Savitski et al, 2014; Franken et al, 2015; Becher et al, 2016).
Furthermore, alternative sample preparation with NP-40 detergent
has allowed improved detection of membrane proteins (Reinhard
et al, 2015).
Here, we applied mass spectrometry-based cellular thermal
shift assay (MS-CeTSA) also known as thermal proteome profil-
ing to study the effects of palbociclib in MCF7 breast cancer
cells and identified the proteasome as a downstream target of
palbociclib. Palbociclib reduced the association of proteasomal
accessory
protein
ECM29
with
the
proteasome
resulting
in
enhanced proteolysis. Consistent with the notion that proteasome
activation is part of the mode of action for palbociclib, inhibition
of proteasome suppressed the cell cycle and senescence pheno-
types induced by palbociclib. Together, these results show that
thermal proteome profiling can be used to discover novel and
unexpected drug responses with potential implications to clinical
research.
Results
Thermal proteome profiling in MCF7 cells
We performed thermal proteome profiling in MCF7 cells, an ER+
and HER2� cell line with sensitivity to palbociclib (Finn et al,
2009). Palbociclib was used at 10 lM concentration in order to
ensure a complete saturation of ligand binding, which maximizes
the shift in detected protein denaturation temperature (DTm;
Martinez Molina et al, 2013; Miettinen & Bjorklund, 2014; Savitski
et al, 2014; Huber et al, 2015; Reinhard et al, 2015). While a 10 lM
concentration of palbociclib is higher than the typical IC50 for long-
term growth inhibition in cell culture, such concentrations are
present in tumors in preclinical mouse models (Nguyen et al, 2010).
MCF7 cells were treated with palbociclib or vehicle (H2O) in tripli-
cates for 1 h and incubated at temperatures ranging from 37 to 65°C
(Fig 1A). Heat-aggregated proteins were removed by centrifugation,
and soluble proteins were analyzed by multiplexed quantitative
mass spectrometry using isotopically labeled tandem mass tags as in
Savitski et al (2014).
Typical data normalization approaches are not easily applica-
ble for thermal proteome profiling data because the total amount
of
soluble
protein
declines
with
temperature.
We
previously
described that the accuracy of Western blot-based cellular thermal
shift assay is improved by normalization to thermally stable
proteins, such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1; Miettinen &
Bjorklund, 2014). When equal amount of protein is analyzed by
mass spectrometry for each temperature point, thermally stable
proteins display increased abundance with temperature in the raw
data (Fig 1A, middle). We used a set of 32 identified, abundant,
and thermally stable proteins for normalization of the mass spec-
trometry
data
(Table
EV1).
This
single-step
normalization
improved the data quality substantially, reducing the median
standard error of the denaturation temperature for the measured
proteome from 1.1 to 0.6°C (Fig EV1A).
Our analysis quantified 5,515 proteins with high confidence. For
3,707 of these, we could obtain high-quality thermal denaturation
curves (Table EV2). The remaining proteins with poorer quality
thermal denaturation curves were enriched for membrane proteins
and mitochondrial proteins as shown before (Savitski et al, 2014) or
displayed atypical thermal denaturation profiles (see Fig EV1B for
examples). A global denaturation profile of the MCF7 proteome indi-
cated a denaturation catastrophe at 49°C (Fig 1A, right), consistent
with the cellular “thermal death point” of mesophiles (Ghosh & Dill,
2010) and the thermal stability of the erythroleukemia K562
proteome (Savitski et al, 2014; Fig EV2).

 the difference between the palbociclib treatment and control melt-
ing temperatures) of its main targets CDK4 and CDK6, as expected
(Fig 1B and C). While the magnitude of the DTm does not directly
indicate binding affinity (Martinez Molina et al, 2013), CDK4
displayed the second strongest DTm of all kinases, exceeded only
by phosphofructokinase (PFKL, liver isoform), a recently identified
CDK6 substrate (Wang et al, 2017; Fig 1D). DTm of CDK6 was the
8th strongest. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) was
also among the kinases with high DTm value. We also observed
thermal destabilization, a decrease in DTm, which could result
from indirect drug effects (Franken et al, 2015), ligand binding to
partially unfolded state (Cimmperman et al, 2008) or conforma-
tional changes that destabilize the protein structure. The most
destabilized kinases by palbociclib included CDK7 and AKT1
(Figs 1D, and EV3A and B). Overall, we observed substantial over-
lap with previously identified palbociclib binding kinases (Sumi
et al, 2015; Fig 1E) and previously measured palbociclib inhibitory
activity against 22 kinases in vitro (Fig EV3C), indicating high
quality of our dataset. While our data indicated that palbociclib
may affect multiple pathways including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling pathway (Fig EV3D), the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhi-
bition was weak and evident only at higher drug concentrations
(Fig EV3E–G). These findings are consistent with previous observa-
tions that CDK4/6 inhibition can partially attenuate mTORC1 activ-
ity (Goel et al, 2016).
Palbociclib activates the 26S proteasome
To gain a global insight into palbociclib-induced cellular changes,
we analyzed what protein complexes were affected by palbociclib.
To visualize the separation from non-affected complexes, we plot-
ted changes in both DTm and DS, a parameter related to the
change in the slope of the melting curve (see Materials and Meth-
ods). This analysis identified complexes involved in DNA replica-
tion
(RAD17-RFC
and
PCNA-CHL12-RFC2-5
complexes)
and
chromatin modification (E2F-6 complex, STAGA and HMGB1-2
complex; Fig 2A). In addition, we identified the mTORC2 complex
and the 20S proteasome. As proteasomal activity is essential for
ordered progression through the cell cycle (Koepp et al, 1999),
and as the proteasome is regulated by mTOR signaling (Zhao
et al, 2015) and is a potent drug target in human cancers (Gold-
berg, 2012), we decided to study the proteasome in more detail.
The complete 26S proteasome is comprised of the core catalytic
20S proteasome and the regulatory 19S lid. Unexpectedly, all
components in the 20S proteasome displayed an increase in DTm
upon
palbociclib
treatment,
whereas
the
19S
subunits
were
largely unaffected (Fig 2B).
To understand the physiological impact that palbociclib has on the
proteasome, we first measured proteasomal activity in MCF7 cells
using a fluorescent peptide substrate Me4BodipyFL-Ahx3Leu3VS
(Berkers et al, 2007). After 1-h treatment, palbociclib activated the
degradation of the peptide substrate in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig 2C),
whereas
MG-132,
a
proteasomal
inhibitor,
abolished
substrate degradation. Another CDK4/6 inhibitor, ribociclib, also
increased proteasomal substrate degradation, although to a lesser
extent. The proteasomal activation persisted when cells were incu-
bated with palbociclib for 30 h and the level of proteasomal activa-
tion with 1 lM palbociclib was comparable to that observed with a
known proteasomal activator, the mTOR inhibitor Torin-1 at 0.1 lM
concentration (Fig 2D). Note that 1 lM concentration of palbociclib
is lower than the typical range (1.4–4.8 lM) seen in tumor xenografts
after treating mice with 10 mg/kg palbociclib (Nguyen et al, 2010).
Palbociclib also activated the proteasome in T47D and HeLa cells
(Fig EV4A and B), indicating that this is not a cell type-specific effect
of the drug.
Activity changes observed with peptide substrates do not neces-
sarily
reflect
changes
in
proteasomal
activity
toward
protein
substrates. We thus examined palbociclib effects on proteasomal
activation using the ubiquitinG76V-GFP biosensor (Dantuma et al,
2000). 30-h palbociclib treatment of HeLa cells expressing UbG76V-
GFP resulted in a major reduction in GFP signal, starting with
submicromolar
doses,
consistent
with
proteasomal
activation
(Fig 2E). To verify that palbociclib-induced GFP degradation was
specific for protein degradation, and not due to changes in protein
synthesis, we treated UbG76V-GFP expressing cells simultaneously
with palbociclib and protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
(CHX) or proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Palbociclib increased
protein degradation even in the presence of CHX, but not in the
presence of MG-132 (Fig 2F). Increased protein degradation in the
presence of CHX was also seen with ribociclib, a structurally similar
CDK4/6 inhibitor (Fig 2F).
We also examined whether these results could be explained by
increased autophagy, as palbociclib was recently shown to activate
autophagy in specific cancer cell lines (Vijayaraghavan et al, 2017).
However, Western blot analysis of SQSTM1/p62 and LC3A/B
protein levels cells did not reveal any significant increase in auto-
phagy in MCF7 to be caused by palbociclib (Fig EV4C and D).
Finally, we induced protein aggregation in cells using the protea-
some inhibitor MG-132 and observed that palbociclib can enhance
the clearance of aggregated proteins in a proteasome-dependent
manner when MG-132 is washed out (Fig EV4E).
Palbociclib induces polyubiquitin chain degradation without
activating the whole ubiquitin–proteasome pathway
To validate that palbociclib affects proteasomal degradation globally,
we examined the total levels of ubiquitylated cellular proteins by
Western blot. This revealed that 1 lM palbociclib treatment reduced
the overall level of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in MCF7 cells
(Fig 2G and H) without changing the 20S proteasome levels (Fig 2G).
To confirm that the observed reduction in ubiquitin conjugates is
related to polyubiquitin chains that are targeted to proteasomal degra-
dation (Kulathu & Komander, 2012), we treated MCF7 cells with
1 lM palbociclib for 10 h in the presence or absence of the protea-
some inhibitor bortezomib. We then enriched total polyubiquitin and
analyzed the linkages by targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)
mass spectrometry (Heap et al, 2017). This analysis confirmed that
amounts of K48 chains, as well as the K6, K29, and K63 chains, were
significantly reduced upon palbociclib treatment, and this reduction
was dependent on proteasomal activity (Fig 3). Note that the BRCA1/
BARD1 ubiquitin E3 ligase (Kulathu & Komander, 2012) generates K6
chains, and thus, palbociclib-dependent reduction in K6 chains could
be relevant for BRCA1 mutant breast cancers.
If palbociclib activates the whole ubiquitin–proteasome pathway,
palbociclib treatment should increase the levels of ubiquitin chains
when ubiquitin breakdown is blocked by proteasome inhibition.

 However, this was not the case, as none of the ubiquitin chain types
displayed increased levels when cells were co-treated with palboci-
clib and bortezomib (Fig 3). When the experiments were done with
the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, similar conclusions were reached
(Fig EV5). However, it is worth noticing that bortezomib and MG-
132 did not induce fully identical ubiquitin levels, most likely due to
the lower specificity of MG-132. Altogether, these data show that
palbociclib does not cause increases in protein ubiquitylation, and
thus, the palbociclib-induced protein degradation is due to a specific
activation of the proteasome. As the rate of degradation for most
proteins is regulated by ubiquitylation, not proteasome activity, the
palbociclib-induced proteasomal activation may only affect a speci-
fic subset of proteins, such as those with K48/K63 branched link-
ages (Ohtake et al, 2018).

 whether it is mediated by other cellular proteins. In vitro protea-

 cycle-independent activation (Fig EV4F). Altogether, these data
suggest that palbociclib affects proteasome activity in a CDK4,
CDK6, and cell cycle-independent manner.
Palbociclib and ribociclib have overlapping off-target profiles
(Sumi et al, 2015), making it possible that previously unappreciated
targets mediate the proteasomal activation. Furthermore, as mTOR is
a known regulator of proteasome (Zhao et al, 2015), the weak inhi-
bition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling could be involved in the protea-
some activation. To gain insight into the mechanism of how
palbociclib activates the proteasome, we immunoprecipitated protea-
somes with anti-a4 20S subunit antibody after 4-h treatments with
palbociclib or the mTOR inhibitor Torin-1 and used quantitative
mass spectrometry to compare changes in proteasomal protein levels
and in phosphorylation sites in proteasomal proteins to untreated
controls (Figs 4D and EV6A and Table EV4). The identified phospho-
sites were largely non-overlapping between palbociclib and Torin-1,
suggesting independent mechanisms for proteasome activation
(Fig EV6B and Table EV5). Approximately half of the phosphosites
in the pulldown from palbociclib-treated cells were proline-directed
and thus potential substrates for MAPK and CDKs (Wang et al,
2007). The remaining sites were highly enriched for acidic residues
after the phosphorylated amino acid residue (Fig EV6C), suggestive
of phosphorylation by casein kinase 2, which was identified as a
potential palbociclib target (Fig 1E). However, inhibition of casein
kinase 2 by quinalizarin (CK2i; 5 lM for 2 h) did not activate the
proteasome, but slightly reduced it (Fig EV6C, right). Thus, although
palbociclib may affect both casein kinase 2 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling (Figs 1E and EV3), these mechanisms are unlikely to
explain the proteasomal activation by palbociclib.
The lack of strong candidate phosphorylation sites in palbociclib-
treated cells prompted us to analyze whether palbociclib could
mediate its effects on proteasome through protein levels. Palboci-
clib-induced changes on the protein levels were much larger than
those induced by Torin-1 (Fig 4E), suggesting that palbociclib,
unlike Torin-1, may affect proteasome structure and/or assembly.
While many 19S subunits displayed reduced levels in the presence
of
palbociclib,
the
proteasome
activator
complex
subunit
3
(PSME3), and the proteasomal scaffold protein ECM29 had the
largest palbociclib-induced decline in abundance (Fig 4E). ECM29, a
204-kDa protein, has been reported to inhibit proteasomal activity
in yeast (Finley et al, 2016), possibly by disassembling the protea-
some (Wang et al, 2017). ECM29 binding to the 20S proteasome
also changes the proteasome conformation (De La Mota-Peynado
et al, 2013), which likely explains the increased 20S thermal stabil-
ity upon ECM29 dissociation from the proteasome.
We proceeded to examine whether palbociclib-induced proteaso-
mal activation could be mediated by ECM29. Consistent with the
role of ECM29 as a proteasomal inhibitor (Finley et al, 2016),
siRNA-mediated depletion of ECM29 increased proteasomal activity
in both MCF7 and HeLa cells (Figs 5A and EV7A). Combining
ECM29 knockdown with palbociclib treatment did not result in any
further increase in proteasomal activity as measured by both the
proteasomal activity probe Me4BodipyFL-Ahx3Leu3VS and UbG76V-
GFP degradation (Figs 5A and B, and EV7A). Thus, ECM29 is
required for the palbociclib-induced proteasomal activity, suggesting
that ECM29 mediates the palbociclib-induced proteasome effects.
ECM29 is critical for normal cell proliferation
Next, we examined the role of ECM29 in the growth and prolifera-
tion of breast cancer cells. We induced loss of ECM29 using
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in MCF7 cells and established a cell line
which appeared to be heterozygous knockout of ECM29, as vali-
dated by examining protein levels. This cell line displayed extremely
slow proliferation (Fig 5C) compared to the parental unaltered cell
line. We were not able to create homozygous knockout of ECM29,
most likely due to homozygous knockout being lethal for MCF7
cells. Knockdown of ECM29 using siRNA similarly inhibited MCF7
and T47D cell proliferation (Fig EV7B), confirming that ECM29 is
involved in cell proliferation. The ECM29 knockout cells were also
much larger and many of the cells stained positively for acidic b-
galactosidase activity, an established marker for cellular senescence
(Fig 5D). We further studied the role of ECM29 in establishing a
senescence-like state by examining two other senescence-associated

 markers, S139 phosphorylation of Histone H2A.X (cH2AX) and p21
protein levels (Lawless et al, 2010), in MCF7 cells where ECM29
was
silenced
using
siRNAs
(Fig 5E).
Both
of
these
markers
displayed marked increase after silencing of EMC29 (Fig 5F and G).
This suggests that ECM29, or the associated proteasome activity,
may be involved in regulation of cell senescence, a feature previ-
ously associated with palbociclib treatment (Anders et al, 2011;
Vijayaraghavan et al, 2017). However, it should be highlighted that
we only examined short-term consequences of ECM29 knockdown
and the senescence-like phenotype may differ from physiological
senescence. Furthermore, our observation that palbociclib increases
proteasome activity, but not ubiquitination levels, is consistent with
the previous work, suggesting that the presence of ECM29 on the
proteasome induces a closed conformation of the substrate entry
channel of the core particle (De La Mota-Peynado et al, 2013). Alto-
gether, this makes EMC29 a likely mediator of the palbociclib-
induced proteasome activation.
ECM29 expression may predict relapse-free survival in
breast cancer
To characterize the potential role of ECM29 as a mediator of palbo-
ciclib effects in breast cancer, we examined the potential breast
cancer association of ECM29 through the publicly available gene
expression data on relapse-free breast cancer patient survival
(Gyorffy et al, 2010). Lower expression of ECM29 displayed a
marginally longer relapse-free survival time when all breast cancer
cases
were
analyzed
[hazard
ratio
(HR) = 1.26,
log-rank
P = 8.5 × 10�5, n = 3,554; Fig 5H]. However, lower expression of
ECM29 associated with substantially longer survival times in the
patient population with HER2+ cancers (HR = 2.37, P = 0.016,
n = 168; Fig 5I). Consistently, CDK4/6 inhibitors have been shown
to be effective against HER2+ cancers in animal models (Goel et al,
2016). Furthermore, ECM29 expression levels could predict survival
benefit
in
patients
receiving
endocrine
therapy
(HR = 1.59,
P = 0.00029, n = 999; Fig 5J). Additional gene expression datasets
provided further support for the correlation between low expression
levels
of
ECM29
and

cancer
patient
survival
(Fig EV7C). Altogether, our data suggest that the expression of
ECM29 should be investigated as a potential biomarker to better
identify those individuals benefiting from palbociclib alone or in
combination with endocrine therapy.
Proteasomal activity is required for palbociclib-induced
cellular phenotypes
To gain insight into how increased proteasomal activity could
limit breast cancer growth, we examined palbociclib-induced degra-
dation of endogenous proteins in MCF7 cells using Western blotting.
A 6-h treatment with palbociclib-induced proteasome-dependent
degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR;
Fig 6A), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, which
is critical for normal cell growth and proliferation (Miettinen &
Bjorklund, 2015). Levels of housekeeping proteins GAPDH and
SOD1 were not affected by palbociclib. At a later timepoint (30 h),
the levels of CDK4 were also reduced by palbociclib in a protea-
some-dependent manner (Fig 6A and B), suggesting that in addition
to the direct inhibition of CDK4/6 kinase activity, long-term
treatment with palbociclib may also inhibit cell proliferation by a
positive feedback loop resulting from proteasomal CDK4 degrada-
tion.
To understand the role of increased proteasome activity in palbo-
ciclib-induced cell cycle arrest, we isolated MCF7 and T47D cells in
G1 phase using centrifugal elutriation and treated these cells with
palbociclib, bortezomib, or both (Fig 6C). Note that we used borte-
zomib concentrations that do not completely block all proteasomal
activity so that cell viability would be maintained (data not shown).
Cell cycle analysis showed that palbociclib prevented progression
beyond the G1 phase and bortezomib alone induced cell accumula-
tion at G2/M. Unexpectedly, bortezomib, which counteracts the
proteasomal activation by palbociclib, could override the palboci-
clib-induced G1 arrest in both cell lines (Fig 6D and E). Thus, these
data suggest that proteasomal activity is required for palbociclib-
induced cell cycle arrest. Increased proteasomal activation by palbo-
ciclib may be an additional mechanism to ensure the completeness
of the G1 arrest.
If the proteasomal activation by palbociclib is involved in some
of the cellular phenotypes caused by palbociclib treatment, then
resistance to palbociclib should also be seen in the form of lower
proteasomal activity. Recently, MCF7 and TD47 cell lines resistant
to CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors have been created (Jansen et al,
2017), and these cells display normal cell cycle profile and prolifera-
tion rate in the presence of palbociclib and ribociclib. We examined
the proteasomal activity in these cells and observed that the CDK4/
6 inhibitor-resistant cells displayed much lower baseline proteasome
activity than the wild-type cells (Fig 6F). Furthermore, when treated
with 1 lM palbociclib for 6 h, the resistant cells displayed much
smaller increase in proteasome activity, even after normalization for
the baseline difference (Fig 6G). As the resistant cell lines were
obtained by selecting for cells capable of proliferation in the pres-
ence of ribociclib (Jansen et al, 2017), these results link the cell
cycle responses of palbociclib/ribociclib to the proteasomal activity
of the cell.
Palbociclib has been reported to induce a senescence-like state
in multiple cell types (Anders et al, 2011), and at least in MCF7
cells, this senescence-like state is dependent on seemingly unre-
lated cellular components, like integrin b3 and TGF beta pathway
(Rapisarda et al, 2017). We examined the effects of modest protea-
some inhibition by bortezomib on the palbociclib-induced senes-
cence-like state in MCF7 cells. Similarly to the partial loss of
ECM29
(Fig 5D),
palbociclib
(1 lM)
treatment
significantly
increased MCF7 cell size and the activity of senescence-associated
b-galactosidase, while decreasing the levels of Ki67 (Fig 7A–C, E
and F), all common features of senescence. However, all of these
effects were largely or completely suppressed by simultaneous
treatment with bortezomib (7.5 nM). We also examined the levels
of Ser139 phosphorylated Histone H2A.X (cH2AX), which is a
marker of cellular senescence and DNA damage (Lawless et al,
2010). cH2AX was upregulated by palbociclib treatment, and this
effect was dependent on proteasomal activity (Fig 7A and D).
While this is consistent with the other senescence markers, it also
suggests that palbociclib may have a role in DNA damage accumu-
lation and/or repair, especially as our MS-CeTSA results identified
RAD17-RFC
and
PCNA-CHL12-RFC2-5,
which
are
protein
complexes responding to DNA damage as a potential palbociclib
targets. Altogether, these results indicate that the proteasomal

 activation by palbociclib is critical for the induction of a senes-
cence-like state, suggesting that the proteasome activation by
palbociclib is part of the drug’s mode of action.
Discussion
Proteasomal activity must be tightly regulated to maintain cellular
homeostasis. Proteasomal degradation of cyclins and many other
cell cycle regulatory proteins is carefully controlled in order to
maintain
normal
cell
cycle
progression
(Koepp
et al,
1999).
Consequently, both activators of proteasome (rapamycin analogs)
and direct proteasomal inhibitors (bortezomib) have been consid-
ered as treatment options in breast cancer. Using the thermal
proteome profiling approach, we identified the proteasome as a
novel downstream target for the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib.
Further
functional
analyses
revealed
that
palbociclib
causes
proteasomal activation at least partly by reducing the proteasomal
association of EMC29, which normally suppresses proteasome
activity. Similar, albeit less potent, proteasome activation was
also observed with ribociclib, a structurally related CDK4/6 inhi-
bitor. Further studies are required to identify the direct targets of
palbociclib that mediate the proteasomal disassociation of EMC29,
and our thermal proteome profiling datasets are likely to be
useful in this. Curiously, the proteasomal activation by palbociclib
was not associated with increased protein ubiquitylation, and the
palbociclib treatment led to a decrease in several ubiquitin chain
types in cells. Nonetheless, palbociclib treatment increased prote-
olysis, including degradation of endogenous proliferation-related
proteins such as HMGCR and CDK4. Consistently, proteasome
activation by palbociclib seems to be involved in the reduction in
cancer cell proliferation and, especially, in the induction of a
senescence-like state (Fig 7G). Overall, our data, together with a
recently published “atlas for drug interactions” (Klaeger et al,
2017), suggest that palbociclib has additional targets with func-
tional consequences.
Palbociclib has been a highly effective compound in the treat-
ment of patients with advanced ER+ and HER2� breast cancer (Finn
et al, 2015; Cristofanilli et al, 2016). Given that breast cancers
constitute up to 15% of all cancer cases and more than 70% of
breast cancers are ER+ and HER2�, palbociclib potentially targets
the largest population of cancer patients. A major need to be
addressed is the identification of the most responsive patient
subpopulation. Although further studies are required, analysis of
existing mRNA expression data related to breast cancer survival
suggests that ECM29 could be a useful biomarker for HER+ cancers
and those patients receiving endocrine therapy. We observed that
palbociclib reduces the proteasomal association of ECM29 which
causes a major reduction in cell proliferation. Palbociclib could
therefore be more beneficial in the population with high ECM29
levels, which predict poorer relapse-free survival in patients receiv-
ing endocrine therapy.
Recently, proteasomal inhibition by DYRK2 kinase knockout was
shown to reduce cell cycle progression (Guo et al, 2016). However,
we find that high proteasomal activity associates with G1 arrest
induced by CDK4/6 inhibition, which may lead to senescence. Our
finding is consistent with earlier observations in other model
systems where inhibition of the ubiquitin–proteasome system may
override CDK4/6-mediated G1 arrest (Zhang et al, 2002; The et al,
2015). Overall, the current and previous works indicate that the role
of the proteasome in cell cycle progression is complex, likely context
dependent and, importantly, exploited by cancer cells to promote
cell proliferation. Instead of a simplistic view where more proteaso-
mal activity is always better for the cell, it seems that appropriate
proteasomal homeostasis is required for the maintenance of cell
proliferation. Proteolytic homeostasis that supports proliferation
and cancer growth may also be dependent on autophagy, inhibition
of which was recently reported to synergize with palbociclib
(Vijayaraghavan et al, 2017). Preclinical data suggest that palboci-
clib sensitizes myeloma cells to bortezomib-induced cell death
(Menu et al, 2008), but our work raises the question of whether
proteasome inhibition and palbociclib are a good combination for
breast cancer therapy due to their partly antagonist activity. Indeed,
proteasomal activators may have therapeutic potential in certain
cancers and this is worthy of further preclinical and translational
investigation.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture, elutriations, and transfections
MCF7 and T47D cells were cultured in RPMI and HeLa-TREx cells
were cultured in high-glucose DMEM. Media were supplemented
with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin
and streptomycin and for T47D additionally with 10 lg/ml human
insulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were checked for mycoplasma infec-
tions. All experiments were performed in non-confluent cells. For
CRISPR/Cas9 knockout, ECM29 was targeted using a dual cleavage
strategy with paired guide sequences CCTGAGACTCGACTTGC
TATTCA and GGTTGGAGCGTATAGTACTTTGG cloned into the
Cas9 D10A vector pX335 and pBABED puro U6. MCF7 cells were
transiently transfected with Cas9 and the targeting vectors using
Fugene HD. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, edited cells were
enriched by culturing them for 48 h in the presence of 2 lg/ml
puromycin. Individual cell clones were recovered by limiting dilu-
tion in the absence of puromycin, and ECM29 protein levels were
assessed by Western blotting.
For cell counting and fluorescence measurements, Accuri C6
cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) was used so that only cells of viable
size were included in the analysis as estimated using FSC-A and
SSC-A values. All fluorescence values were normalized to cell size
(FSC-A), as prolonged incubations with, for example, palbociclib
increased the cell size.
siRNAs were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. Two
independent siRNAs (20 nM each) were combined to target each
gene, and the siRNAs were transfected using Qiagen’s HiPerFect
transfection reagent. The following siRNAs were used: CDK4
(HSC.RNAI.N000075.12.1
and
HSC.RNAI.N000075.12.2),
CDK6
(HSC.RNAI.N001145306.12.1 and HSC.RNAI.N001145306.12.2), RB1
(HSC.RNAI.N000321.12.1 and HSC.RNAI.N000321.12.2), and ECM29
(HSC.RNAI.N001080398.12.1
and
HSC.RNAI.N001080398.12.2).
UbG76V-GFP was transfected using Promega’s FuGENE transfection
reagent. For proliferation assay after ECM29 RNAi in MCF7 and T47D
cell culture, cells were cultured in complete medium and absolute cell
count was measured every 24 h for 4 days.

HMGCR and ECM29 antibodies were from Abcam (ab98018 and
ab28666, respectively). For the Pathscan Intracellular Signaling
array (Cell Signaling Technology), T47D cells were incubated with
0, 0.1, 1, and 10 lM palbociclib for 1 h. Samples were processed as
per manufacturer’s instructions for fluorescent detection. In all
assays, antibodies were used at the concentrations recommended by
the supplier and detected using infrared dye-conjugated secondary
antibodies and a LICOR Odyssey detection system. Protein levels
were quantified using ImageJ, and both GAPDH and SOD1 levels
were used to control equal sample loading in Western blots.
Thermal profiling sample preparation
Sample preparation was performed similar to the previous protocols
(Miettinen & Bjorklund, 2014; Savitski et al, 2014) with the follow-
ing modifications. MCF7 cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS,
and suspended in PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cock-
tail (Sigma-Aldrich). Suspended cells (2 × 104 cells/ll) were treated
with 10 lM palbociclib or H2O for 1 h at 37°C with gentle mixing.
Each sample was then separated into 10 fractions, each with 5 × 106
cells for thermal profiling. Fractions were heated at the indicated
temperatures (37–65°C) for 3 min using an Eppendorf Thermomixer
with mixing (500 rpm). Fractions were then incubated for 3 min at
room temperature and frozen on dry ice. Samples were lysed with
four freeze–thaw cycles using dry ice and 35°C water bath. Cell
lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C to separate
protein
aggregates
from
soluble
proteins.
Supernatants
were
collected and used for mass spectrometry and Western blots.
Proteasome activity assays
Live cell proteasome activity was assessed by pretreating cells with
the indicated chemicals followed by 1-h incubation in the presence
of 0.5 lM proteasome activity probe (Me4BodipyFL-Ahx3Leu3VS;
BostonBiochem; Berkers et al, 2007). After incubation, cells were
washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. The specificity of
the proteasome activity probe was also validated on a SDS–PAGE
gel, where an equal amount of each sample was loaded to assess
proteasome staining.
GFP degradation was measured by reverse transfecting HeLa-
TREx cells with the short-lived UbG76V-GFP (Dantuma et al, 2000),
12 h later treating the cells with doxycycline to induce GFP expres-
sion and another 12 h later adding the indicated chemicals. GFP
levels were measured using flow cytometry, and the protein degra-
dation % was calculated by normalizing the data to control (0%
degraded) and negative control without the GFP construct (100%
degraded). When examining GFP levels in the absence of protein
synthesis, cells were treated with 100 lM cycloheximide at the same
time as when chemicals of interest were added.
Proteasome
activity
toward
protein
aggregates
was
also
measured using the ProteoStat Aggresome detection reagent (Enzo
Life Sciences). MCF7 cells were first treated with control or palboci-
clib and cultured in the presence of MG-132 for 18 h to accumulate
protein aggregates. The cells were then washed twice and treated
with palbociclib or control. After 4 h, the protein aggregate levels
were measured using flow cytometer according to the supplier’s
instructions. Data were normalized to that 0% represents the basal
level of protein aggregates in a control untreated with MG-132 and
that 100% represents the level to which MG-132 increased the
protein aggregates.
20S proteasome activity in vitro was assayed as previously
described (Cui et al, 2014). Briefly, MCF7 cells were lysed in assay
buffer [25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% (v/v)
NP-40, 0.001% (w/v) SDS]. 40 lg clarified lysate was preincubated
with the inhibitors for 10 min in assay buffer containing 100 lM
ATP before the addition of chymotrypsin-like substrate Suc-LLVY-
AMC (Enzo Life Sciences), caspaselike substrate Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-
AMC (Enzo Life Sciences), or trypsinlike substrate Z-ARR-AMC (Mil-
lipore) to 100 lM final concentration. Final reaction volume was
100 ll.
Cell senescence assays and proliferative markers detection
MCF7 cells were cultured with either 7.5 nM bortezomib, 1 lM
palbociclib, or both for 10 days, with media change every second
day. Note that higher concentrations of bortezomib became toxic
to the cells in long term (data not shown). For b-galactosidase
activity, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained
with 0.1% b-gal, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium
ferricyanide, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl2 in 40 mM citric
acid/sodium phosphate solution, pH 6.0 for overnight at 37°C. The
cells were washed with PBS and imaged using Nikon Eclipse
TS100 microscope. For Ki67 and phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139)
assays, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed twice with 5% BSA in
PBS, and stained with antibodies o/n in +4°C. Ki67 (D3B5) Alexa
Fluor 488 conjugate antibody and phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139;
20E3) Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate antibody were obtained from CST
(#11880 and #9720, respectively). The following day cells were
washed twice with 5% BSA in PBS, and antibody staining levels
were analyzed using LSR II flow cytometer from BD Biosciences.
The antibody staining was validated using microscopy, for which

media (VectorLabs) using a 60× objective.
Immunoprecipitation of proteasomes
MCF7 cells cultured in 10-cm dishes were treated for 4 h with
10 lM palbociclib or 1 lM Torin-1 in triplicates or left untreated.
Cells were lysed in 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 5 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail.
Clarified lysates were incubated with agarose-immobilized 20S a4
subunit
monoclonal
antibody
(BML-PW9005-0500,
Enzo
Life
Sciences) for 1 h at +4°C, and the beads washed three times with
500 ll lysis buffer without inhibitors.
Protein extraction and digestion
Protein concentration of samples was determined (BCA Protein
Assay) and used to normalize the volume corresponding to the
protein quantity necessary for tandem mass tag labeling (100 lg).
Final concentration of 50 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine
(TCEP), 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 in 10%
2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) was added to protein lysates and heated
at 55°C for 30 min. Cysteines were then alkylated in 10 mM iodo-
acetamide (Sigma), and excess reagent was quenched with 10 mM
dithiothreitol (Sigma) and digested overnight at 37°C by adding
porcine trypsin (1:50, w/w) (Pierce). Peptides were desalted via C18
Macro SpinColumns (Harvard Apparatus) and dried under vacuum
centrifugation.
Tandem mass tagging labeling
Isobaric labeling of peptides was performed using the 10-plex
tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents (Thermo Scientific). TMT reagents
(0.8 mg) were dissolved in 40 ll of acetonitrile, and 20 ll was
added to the corresponding fractions, previously dissolved in 100 ll
of 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The reaction was
quenched by addition of 8 ll of 5% hydroxylamine after 1-h incuba-
tion at room temperature. According to the different temperature
points, labeled peptides were combined, acidified with 200 ll of
0.1% TFA (pH ~2) and concentrated using the C18 SPE on Sep-Pak
cartridges (Waters).
Hydrophilic Strong Anion Exchange (hSAX) chromatography
TMT-labeled peptides were subjected to hydrophilic Strong Anion
Exchange
(hSAX)
fractionation
(Ritorto
et al,
2013).
Labeled
peptides were solubilized in 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 10.0 and sepa-
rated on a Dionex RFIC IonPac AS24 column (IonPac series,
2 × 250 mm, 2,000 A
˚ pore size; Thermo Scientific). Using a DGP-
3600BM
pump
system
equipped
with
a
SRD-3600
degasser
(Thermo Scientific) a 30 min gradient length from 8 to 80% of
1 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 10 (flow rate of 0.25 ml/min),
separated the peptide mixtures into a total of 34 fractions. The 34
fractions were merged into 15 samples, acidified with 1% trifluo-
roacetic acid (TFA; pH ~2), desalted via C18 Macro SpinColumns
(Harvard Apparatus), dried under vacuum centrifugation and
resuspended in 2% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% TFA for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
Peptide samples were separated on an Ultimate 3000 Rapid Separa-
tion LC Systems chromatography (Thermo Scientific) with a C18
PepMap,
serving
as
a
trapping
column
(2 cm × 100 lm
ID,
PepMap C18, 5 lm particles, 100 A
˚
pore size) followed by a
50-cm EASY-Spray column (50 cm × 75 lm ID, PepMap C18,
2 lm particles, 100 A
˚ pore size) (Thermo Scientific) with a linear
gradient consisting of 2.4–28% [ACN, 0.1% formic acid (FA)] over
150 min at 300 nl/min. Mass spectrometric identification and
quantification were performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) operated in data-dependent, posi-
tive ion mode. FullScan spectra were acquired in a range from 400
to 1,500 m/z, at a resolution of 120,000, with an automated gain
control (AGC) of 300,000 ions and a maximum injection time of
50 ms. The 12 most intense precursor ions were isolated with a
quadrupole mass filter width of 1.6 m/z, and CID fragmentation
was performed in one-step collision energy of 32% and 0.25 acti-
vation Q. Detection of MS/MS fragments was acquired in the
linear ion trap in a rapid mode with an AGC target of 10,000 ions
and a maximum injection time of 40 ms. Quantitative analysis of
TMT-tagged peptides was performed using FTMS3 acquisition in
the Orbitrap mass analyzer operated at 60,000 resolution, with an
AGC target of 100,000 ions and a max injection time of 120 ms.
Higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD fragmentation) on MS/MS
fragments was performed in one-step collision energy of 55% to
ensure maximal TMT reporter ion yield and synchronous precursor
selection (SPS) was enabled to include 10 MS/MS fragment ions in
the FTMS3 scan.
Data processing and quantitative data analysis
Protein identification and quantification were performed using
MaxQuant Version 1.5.1.7 (Cox & Mann, 2008) with the following
parameters: stable modification carbamidomethyl (C); variable
modifications oxidation (M), acetylation (protein N terminus),
deamidation (NQ), hydroxyproline (P), quantitation labels with 10
plex TMT on N-terminal or lysine with a reporter mass tolerance
of 0.01 Da and trypsin as enzyme with two missed cleavages.
Search was conducted using the Uniprot-Trembl Human database
(42,096 entries, downloaded March 17, 2015), including common
contaminants. Mass accuracy was set to 4.5 ppm for precursor
ions and 0.5 Da for ion trap MS/MS data. Identifications were fil-
tered at a 1% false-discovery rate (FDR) at the protein level,
accepting a minimum peptide length of 5 amino acids. Quan-
tification of identified proteins referred to razor and unique
peptides, and required a minimum ratio count of 2. Normalized
ratios were extracted for each protein/conditions and were used
for downstream analyses.
Protein complexes were identified based on annotations in the
Corum database (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/genre/proj/
corum/) using the Core Complexes dataset. Only complexes with
four or more proteins were included in the analysis. Mean DTm
and DS for each complex was used for plotting the average change

 of the complex. Outlier complexes were identified by plotting a
95% confidence interval based on normal-probability contour over
the two-dimensional scatter plot data using the dataEllipse func-
tion in R.
Data normalization
Stable proteins were classified as those with increasing relative
abundance at higher temperatures in control samples. Preliminary
analyses showed that those proteins with an average of at least five
times higher abundance at 59°C compared to 37°C and which were
identified by at least five unique peptides minimized the standard
error in denaturation curve fitting. Keratins were omitted from the
list of stable proteins as they could be a contamination from sample
handling. The 59°C data point rather than any higher temperature
point was used as the identification of stable proteins as it had the
minimum standard error of the curve fitting. Mean abundance for
the identified 32 stable proteins were calculated for each tempera-
ture, and the relative abundancies of the proteins at each tempera-
ture were divided with the mean abundance for the 32 proteins at
the same temperature. For immunoprecipitated proteasomes, protein
abundance data were normalized to the total abundance of 20S sub-
units, excluding the less abundant immunoproteasome subunits.
Denaturation curve fitting
For the 5,515 proteins quantified by mass spectrometry, only those
identified with two to three replicates in both control and palboci-
clib-treated cells were included for the final analysis. The sigmoid
curve from Savitski et al (2014),

where f0 is the plateau at temperature T ? ∞, while a and b
control the shape of the function. The melting temperature is
defined as f(Tm) = 1/2, and expressed by
Tm ¼

lnð1 � 2f0Þ þ b :
The slope of the sigmoid, S = f0(Ti), is calculated at the inflection
point, Ti, where f″(Ti) = 0.
The sigmoid function can be reparameterized to fit for the melt-
ing temperature directly, by replacing b with Tm,

This form of the sigmoid curve was fit to all protein profiles
using the nonlinear least squares method (package “nls” in R). Each
protein was fit ten times with randomized initial parameters to mini-
mize the chance of finding a false local v2 minimum.
To exclude poorly fitting data, Z scores were calculated for the
residual mean variation from the curve fitting and included only if
|Z score| < 3. Finally, we included only proteins where the standard
error of DTm was less that median + 3 × median average deviation
(MAD) for the standard error of DTm. The final list consisted of
3,707 proteins.
Mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitated proteasome
Protein extracts from each biological replicates were loaded on
NuPAGE 4–12% bis–tris acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Running of
protein was stopped as soon as proteins stacked in a single band,
stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon), cut from the gel and digested
with trypsin protease, MS Grade (Pierce) as described previously
(Shevchenko et al, 1996). Mass spectrometry analysis was carried
out by LC�MS/MS using similar settings as described above except
that samples were measured in “Top Speed” data-dependent acqui-
sition mode. Statistical significance was analyzed from the three
replicate samples by two-tailed t-test without adjusting for multiple
hypothesis testing.
Tandem ubiquitin-binding entity (TUBE) pulldown of
ubiquitylated proteins
MCF7 cells were cultured in three replicates with and without 1 lM
palbociclib for 24 h. Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 100 mM
N-ethylmaleimide and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).
Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged to remove insoluble materi-
als. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay
(Pierce), and 10 mg of protein was pre-incubated with 50 ll of
HaloLink resin (Promega) for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants were
then incubated with 50 ll of Halolink-UBA resin (UBA domain of
Ubiquilin-1, amino acids Q539-Q587) for 3 h at 4°C.
The poly-ubiquitin (polyUb) chains captured by the UBA domain
of Ubiquilin (Hjerpe et al, 2009) were washed three times with lysis
buffer, and Halo-tagged UBA containing polyUb proteins were solu-
bilized by adding reducing Laemmli sample buffer (Invitrogen).
Extracts were loaded on NuPAGE 4–12% bis–tris acrylamide.
Running of protein was stopped as soon as proteins stacked in a
single band, stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon), cut from the gel,
reduced with 10 mM TCEP for 10 min at 65°C, and digested with
trypsin before analysis by mass spectrometry.
Preparation of Ub-AQUA peptide mixtures
Concentrated
stocks
of
isotopically
labeled
internal
standard
(heavy) peptides and light synthetic peptides (M1, K6, K11, K27,
K29, K33, K48, K63) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technolo-
gies. All stock solutions were stored at �80°C, working stock solu-
tion of individual peptides was prepared at 25 pmol/ll in 2% ACN,
0.1% FA and used to prepare an experimental mixture consisting of
eight peptides at 1 pmol/ll in 2% ACN, 0.1% FA. The mixtures
were frozen at �80°C in triplicate use aliquots for direct addition to
samples.
Targeted mass spectrometry of ubiquitin chain types
Absolute analysis of ubiquitin chain types was performed similar to
reported previously (Huguenin-Dezot et al, 2016). Quantitation
using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was performed on an Orbi-
trap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an
Easy-Spray source coupled to an Ultimate 3000 Rapid Separation LC
system (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Samples were loaded via a 5 ll
full loop injection directly onto an EASY-Spray column (15 cm ×

a flow rate of 1 ll/min where solvent A was 98% H2O, 2% ACN,
0.1% FA and solvent B was 98% ACN, 2% H2O, 0.1% FA. Upon LC
direct injection, peptides were resolved with an isocratic gradient of
0.1% of solvent B over 10 min, followed by a step from 0.1 to
25.5% of solvent B over 41 min, 5 min of high organic wash (90%
solvent B) and 12 min re-equilibration at 0.1% of solvent B. The
Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer was operated in targeted mode
“tMS2” for the detection of light and synthetic heavy peptides. The
included m/z values were selected by the quadrupole, with 4-m/z
isolation window, a maximum injection time of 100 ms and a maxi-
mum AGC target of 50,000. HCD fragmentation was performed at
30% collision energy for all included peptides, and MS/MS frag-
ments were detected in the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a FMWH reso-
lution of 30,000 (at m/z 200). Peak integration of MS/MS spectra
and quantification of Ub peptides were performed on Skyline (ver-
sion 3.5.0.9191; http://proteome.gs.washington.edu/software/sky
line; MacLean et al, 2010).
Kinase inhibitor data
The in vitro activity data for palbociclib were downloaded from
http://www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/kinase-inhibitors.
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
Kaplan–Meier curves for ECM29 in breast cancer were generated
using the KMplot online service (http://www.kmplot.com), which
combines publicly available mRNA expression datasets and associ-
ated clinical information (Gyorffy et al, 2010). The cohorts are
divided into high/low according to the median expression of the
gene. The survival was assessed for the whole population, and vari-
ous subpopulations of which HER2 expressing and endocrine ther-
apy
receiving
patient
populations
displayed
most
significant
survival benefits.
