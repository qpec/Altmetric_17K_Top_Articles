Expected eff
 ects of adopting a 9 month regimen for 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a population modelling 
analysis
Emily A Kendall, Anthony T Fojo, David W Dowdy
Summary
Background In May, 2016, WHO endorsed a 9 month regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that is cheaper and 
potentially more eff
 ective than the conventional, longer (20–24 month) therapy. We aimed to investigate the 
population-level implications of scaling up this new regimen. 
Methods In this population modelling analysis, we developed a dynamic transmission model to simulate the 
introduction of this short-course regimen as an instantaneous switch in 2016. We projected the corresponding 
percentage reduction in the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by 2024 compared with continued use of 
longer therapy. In the primary analysis in a representative southeast Asian setting, we assumed that the short-course 
regimen would double treatment access (through savings in resources or capacity) and achieve long-term effi
  cacy at 
levels seen in preliminary cohort studies. We then did extensive sensitivity analyses to explore a range of alternative 
scenarios.
Findings Under the optimistic assumptions in the primary analysis, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
in 2024 would be 3·3 (95% uncertainty range 2·2–5·6) per 100 000 population with the short-course regimen and 
4·3 (2·9–7·6) per 100 000 population with continued use of longer therapy—ie, the short-course regimen could reduce 
incidence by 23% (10–38). Incidence would be reduced by 14% (4–28) if the new regimen aff
 ected only treatment 
eff
 ectiveness and by 11% (3–24) if it aff
 ected only treatment availability. Under more pessimistic assumptions, the 
short-course regimen would have minimal eff
 ect and even potential for harm—eg, when 30% of patients are ineligible 
for the new regimen because of second-line drug resistance, we projected a change in incidence of –2% (–20 to +28). 
The new regimen’s eff
 ect was greater in settings with more ongoing transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, 
but results were otherwise similar across settings with diff
 erent levels of tuberculosis incidence and prevalence of 
multidrug resistance.
Interpretation The short-course regimen has potential to substantially lessen the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
epidemic, but this eff
 ect depends on its long-term effi
  cacy, its ability to expand treatment access, and the role of 
second-line drug resistance.

Introduction
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis—present in 3–4% of 
new tuberculosis cases and 20% of previously treated 
cases worldwide (with much higher prevalence in some 
countries)—causes 190 000 deaths each year and is a 
major challenge to clinicians and policy makers.1 Fewer 
than half of all notifi
 ed cases with underlying multidrug 
resistance are identifi
 ed as such, and with the scale-up of 
Xpert MTB/RIF, many patients diagnosed with rifampin 
resistance have no access to appropriate treatment. In 
individuals appropriately treated for multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis, conventional, 20–24 month regimens 
(subsequently referred to as longer therapy) have a 
success rate of only 50% worldwide2 because of factors 
such as low drug eff
 ectiveness,2,3 lengthy and toxic 
regimens that are diffi
  cult to complete,4 and high rates of 
prevalent5 and acquired resistance6 to second-line drugs. 
Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is also 
resource intensive, costing thousands of US dollars per 
patient7 and consuming up to half of tuberculosis control 
budgets in high-burden countries.1
A potential solution to these challenges is the use of a 
shorter, cheaper, more eff
 ective, and more tolerable new 
regimen to expand treatment capacity and improve 
treatment success. In May, 2016, WHO made a 
conditional recommendation for a new short-course 
regimen that can treat most patients with multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis in 9–12 months.8 This regimen 
consists of an initial 4–6 month phase of seven drugs 
including a second-line injectable, followed by a 5 month 
continuation of four of the oral drugs including 
pyrazinamide and a fl
 uoroquinolone. It costs less than 
US$1000 per patient and has shown promising 
eff
 ectiveness, with more than 80% of patients cured in

initial observational cohorts.9–12 WHO now recommends 
this short-course regimen for patients with multidrug-
resistant pulmonary tuberculosis without confi
 rmed or 
probable resistance to key drugs in the regimen, while 
acknowledging the low capacity to test for such resistance 
in many settings.13
However, unknowns about this new short-course 
regimen exist. First, although this regimen seemed highly 
eff
 ective in observational cohorts,8 the fi
 rst rigorous 
comparison of its effi
  cacy with that of longer therapy will 
not be completed until 2018.14 Second, use of this regimen 
necessitates testing for susceptibility to additional drugs 
(fl
 uoroquinolones and second-line injectables, resistance 
to which is common in some populations with multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis15). Moreover, great uncertainty exists 
regarding treatment outcomes in patients with resistance 
to other components of the regimen8 (particularly 
pyrazinamide, to which half or more multidrug-resistant 
strains are resistant5), raising concerns about the 
regimen’s eff
 ectiveness and usefulness in geographical 
settings with more extensive resistance than the settings 
where the regimen was developed and fi
 rst tested.16 
Furthermore, whether tuberculosis programmes and 
health systems can truly use resources freed by a shorter 
regimen to expand treatment access remains uncertain. 
Finally, the eff
 ect of this regimen might diff
 er substantially 
from one epidemiological setting to another.
In light of these uncertainties, we aimed to use a 
dynamic transmission model to investigate the potential 
eff
 ect of this new short-course regimen and to project 
outcomes under diff
 erent assumptions regarding regimen 
eff
 ectiveness, treatment access, treatment outcomes in 
patients with additional drug resistance, and underlying 
epidemiology of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
Methods
Model overview
In this population modelling analysis, we developed a 
compartmental transmission model of a multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis epidemic, similar to previous 
tuberculosis models,17,18 with explicit representation of 
diagnosis and treatment of multidrug resistance (fi
 gure 1; 
see appendix for description of the full model). In brief, 
both drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant strains 
circulate in a population, with multidrug resistance 
emerging 
during 
treatment 
of 
drug-susceptible 
disease19 and subsequently also spreading through 
person-to-person transmission. Active tuberculosis, once 
symptomatic, is identifi
 ed and treated at a given rate, but 
only a proportion of patients are tested for multidrug 
resistance and treated accordingly. Treatment is either 
apparently eff
 ective (ie, symptoms and infectiousness 
resolve, followed by lasting cure or by temporary 
resolution with subsequent relapse to active disease) or 
ineff
 ective (ie, associated with ongoing tuberculosis 
mortality risk and infectiousness). Longer therapy was 
modelled as lasting a median of 20 months and 
representing a full attempt at treatment, including any 
changes made to the initial regimen based on clinical 
response or drug susceptibility testing results; outcomes 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis has a tremendous toll on 
patients who have to endure nearly 2 years of treatment, while 
exerting pressure on the budgets of tuberculosis control 
programmes and posing a major barrier to tuberculosis 
elimination worldwide. In May, 2016, WHO recommended a 
short-course regimen on the basis of promising individual-level 
eff
 ectiveness in several observational studies; however, to the 
best of our knowledge, the population-level implications of this 
recommendation have not been assessed. 
Added value of this study
In this study, we estimated the epidemiological benefi
 t of 
adopting the newly endorsed short-course regimen for 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. We also explored the extent to 
which the anticipated eff
 ect depends on characteristics of the 
regimen that remain to be determined, such as treatment success 
under programmatic conditions, durability of eff
 ectiveness, 
exclusions on the basis of additional drug resistance, treatment 
outcomes after such exclusions, and the extent to which cost 
savings from the new regimen can be used to expand treatment 
access. We provided a numerical estimate of the potential 
population-level eff
 ect of the short-course regimen in a 
representative setting—a 23% reduction in incidence after 
8 years—and explored factors that modify this projection under 
diff
 erent conditions. Under some reasonable sets of assumptions 
(eg, lower eff
 ectiveness of the short-course regimen than that 
suggested in initial observational studies or a higher prevalence of 
resistance to second-line drugs), the new regimen was projected 
to result in minimal, or even negative, eff
 ects on the incidence of 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
Implications of all the available evidence
The new short-course regimen can potentially have an important 
role in the control of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. However, 
this eff
 ect needs to be balanced against uncertainties related to 
long-term eff
 ectiveness and the importance of additional drug 
resistance. To optimise the eff
 ect of this new regimen, 
early-adopter countries should simultaneously expand diagnosis 
and treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and closely 
monitor treatment outcomes in both patients receiving the 
regimen and those ineligible because of additional drug resistance. 
An important, positive population-level eff
 ect of introducing this 
regimen is realistic but cannot be assumed without further 
evidence on the role of resistance to second-line drugs and 
long-term effi
  cacy data from ongoing clinical trials.

were based on results in observational cohorts.3 We 
assumed that those who do not respond to a full 
treatment attempt for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
remain infectious until either death or spontaneous 
resolution.
Calibration
To explore a large and representative number of scenarios 
consistent with these data, we considered 2 million sets of 
model parameters drawn from distributions based on the 
literature (table 1; appendix pp 7–8). We used log-normal 
distributions for continuous measures bounded from 
0 to infi
 nity, logit-normal distributions for continuous 
measures bounded from 0 to 1, and uniform distributions 
when data to suggest a most likely value were missing or 
sparse. In the primary analysis, we calibrated the model 
to a setting characterised by WHO estimates of incidence, 
prevalence, and mortality of tuberculosis, as well as 
prevalence of multidrug resistance in new and 
retreatment tuberculosis notifi
 cations, in people aged 
15 years and older for the WHO southeast Asian region—
ie, Bangladesh, Bhutan, North Korea, India, Indonesia, 
Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and 
Timor-Leste—in 2014 (table 2; appendix pp 10–11).1
To model the expansion of diagnosis and treatment of 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the past decade, we 
linearly increased the proportions of patients who are 
identifi
 ed as having drug resistance (eg, by Xpert MTB/
RIF) and considered for treatment over time, from zero 
in 2004 to reported levels (3·8% of new tuberculosis 
cases and 67% of retreatment cases) in 2014. For the 
primary analysis, we assumed that, in absence of a short-
course regimen, the probability of receiving multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis treatment would subsequently 
remain constant (refl
 ecting a relatively fi
 xed treatment 
budget), whereas the short-course regimen allows

 rst-line drug susceptibility testing is performed and indicates fi
 rst-line resistance, 
assignment to an MDR-TB treatment regimen depends on the availability of the short-course regimen and the prevalence of additional resistance as detected by the 
accompanying second-line drug susceptibility tests. Mortality from all compartments (higher during active tuberculosis) and stratifi

history were also modelled but not shown. DS-TB=drug-susceptible tuberculosis. MDR-TB=multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. *Individuals on treatment with apparent

 ective fi
 rst-line treatment of DS-TB.

compartments—were modelled as having an ongoing risk of tuberculosis-related mortality and an ongoing possibility of spontaneous resolution.

 ecting 
the lower cost and resource requirement of the new 
regimen.
Modelling of short-course regimen
We modelled the introduction of a short-course regimen 
as an instantaneous switch from the conventional, longer 
therapy in 2016 for patients who are diagnosed with 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and not found to have 
additional drug resistance that makes them ineligible. 
This scenario refl
 ects a simulated policy change with 
rapid restructuring of the treatment programme for 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
To estimate the number of additional patients who 
could be treated in a budget-neutral introduction of the 
new regimen, we compared the costs of drugs and 
clinical care for each regimen. Drug costs for the 
short-course regimen are less than half of those of longer 
therapy, and the shortened durations of the intensive 
phase and the overall treatment course also reduce other 
associated health-care costs,8 whereas added costs of 
second-line drug susceptibility testing are small relative 
to the total cost of treatment.26 For simplicity, we assumed 
in the primary analysis that introduction of the 
short-course regimen would allow twice as many patients 
to be treated on the same multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
treatment budget. We implemented this doubling by 
expanding the number of patients with multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis off
 ered treatment, fi
 rst to 
previously treated patients and then to new patients.
In the primary analysis, we modelled a scenario in 
which roughly 10% of patients with multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis have additional drug resistance (or suspected 
resistance) that disqualifi
 es them from the short-course 
regimen, leading to very poor outcomes. We used a 
median duration of 10 months for the short-course 
regimen and 20 months for longer therapy,9 and assumed 
that loss to follow-up is reduced by half with the 
short-course regimen. Treatment success for people 
remaining in treatment was set at 92·5% for the 
short-course regimen9 and 66–85% for longer therapy;3 
these percentages include only those who are not lost to 
follow-up and are therefore higher than reported fi
 gures 
that do not distinguish between loss to follow-up and 
other adverse outcomes. Relapse risk after successful 
treatment was set at 1% for the short-course regimen and 
1–10% for longer therapy. The estimated outcomes of the 
short-course regimen were based on results from 
an observational cohort study in Bangladesh;9 similar 
results were obtained elsewhere.8,12 The estimated 10% 
ineligibility for the short-course regimen is based on the 
assumptions that patients would be screened for 
second-line drug resistance with a line probe assay (of 
imperfect sensitivity),27 moxifl
 oxacin resistance would be 
similar to levels observed in Pakistan and Bangladesh,5 
and monoresistance to second-line injectables would be 
rare.28,29 We also assumed, conservatively, that patients

found to have such disqualifying additional drug 
resistance would have very poor outcomes, comparable to 
those reported for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis1 
and to tuberculosis outcomes in the pre-antibiotic era30 
(ie, that half of these patients will ultimately die of 
tuberculosis, although such deaths might occur well after 
treatment is completed).
We explored several alternative scenarios to the above 
assumptions (table 3). Alternatives involving inter-related 
aspects of prevalence, diagnosis, and associated 
treatment outcomes of second-line drug resistance were 
explored combinatorially (table 4).
The primary outcome for each scenario was the 
percentage reduction in multidrug-resistant tuber 
culosis 
incidence in 2024, compared with projections under 
continued use of longer therapy. Results are reported as 
the median simulated value and corresponding 95% 
uncertainty range (UR), refl
 ecting the 2·5th to 97·5th 
percentile of data-consistent simulations.
Sensitivity analyses
We assessed the sensitivity of the primary results to the 
value of all underlying model parameters. We also 
assessed the sensitivity of our results to assumptions 
about ongoing scale-up of drug susceptibility testing 
even in the absence of the short-course regimen, to 
underlying dynamics of acquisition, transmission, and 
reactivation of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and to 
alternative epidemiological scenarios refl
 ecting a range 
of tuberculosis incidence and multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis prevalence (appendix).

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of

the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Our model generated 11 289 data-consistent simulations, 
which fi
 tted well with our epidemiological calibration 
targets (table 2). Posterior distributions of model 
parameters favoured lower rates of acquisition and trans-
mission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (refl
 ecting 
that multidrug resistance is present in only 2% of new 
tuberculosis notifi
 cations, despite decades of treatment 
with isoniazid and rifampin) but otherwise suggested no 
strong support for specifi
 c parameter values within the 
ranges of the specifi
 ed prior distributions (appendix p 13).
Assuming that current practices continue, we projected 
that the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
would decrease by a median of 14% (95% UR –36 to 39) 
from 4·9 [95% UR 4·2–5·9] per 100 000 population in

2014 to 4·3 [2·9–7·6] per 100 000 population in 2024 
(fi
 gure 2A), refl
 ecting higher levels of treatment than in 
the past. However, the large 95% UR refl
 ects the paucity 
of longitudinal data. Despite this uncertainty in the 
overall trajectory of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
incidence, the short-course regimen was consistently 
projected to have benefi
 t under the assumptions of the 
primary scenario. We projected that, 8 years after intro-
duction of the short-course regimen, the incidence of 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis would be 3·3 (2·2–5·6) 
per 100 000 population—ie, the incidence in 2024 would 
be 23% (10–38) lower with the short-course regimen 
(fi
 gure 2B). A slightly larger reduction in multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis mortality (31%, 14–46) was 
projected than for incidence.
The magnitude of the short-course regimen’s eff
 ect 
on the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
was dependent on several key assumptions (fi
 gures 3, 4). 
If the short-course regimen only improved outcomes in 
patients treated but did not facilitate treatment access 
(alternative scenario 1), it was projected to reduce 
incidence by only 14% (95% UR 4–28). Similarly, if 
the short-course regimen’s benefi
 t was restricted to 
expansion of treatment access alone and did not change 
the average treatment outcome (alternative scenario 2), 
then the incidence in 2024 was projected to fall by 
11% (3–24). Furthermore, if we assumed that a fi
 nding 
of equivalent effi
  cacy between the two regimens was 
dependent on the short-course regimen only being 
used in those without additional resistance—while 
those excluded from the short-course regimen had very 
poor outcomes (alternative scenario 3)—then the 
short-course regimen could have a minimal eff
 ect on 
the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic as a 
whole (relative change in incidence –3%, –16 to 9), 
despite doubling the number of people treated. 
Similarly pessimistic pro 
jections were seen when the 
prevalence of disqualifying drug resistance was 
increased to 30% (alternative scenario 5). Figure 4 
shows the projected eff
 ects of the short-course regimen 
in a given setting as a function of three measurable 
parameters: treatment outcomes in those who take the 
short-course regimen; treatment outcomes in those 
excluded from the regimen (and instead given longer 
therapy); and the proportion of the population excluded 
from the short-course regimen.
In sensitivity analyses, the relative eff
 ect of the 
short-course regimen did not depend substantially on 
the degree of future scale-up of drug susceptibility testing 
(appendix p 14). Other variables that strongly infl
 uenced 
the eff
 ect of the short-course regimen included the 
long-term effi
  cacy of longer therapy and assumptions 
about the duration and trajectory of the multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis epidemic (appendix pp 15–16). The 
regimen’s eff
 ect showed little sensitivity to the balance of 
acquired versus transmitted multidrug resistance and 
was only moderately sensitive to the balance of recent 
versus remote transmission (appendix p 17). Similarly, 
the short-course regimen had a greater potential eff
 ect in 
high-prevalence settings; results were otherwise similar 
across a range of simulated epidemiological settings 
(appendix p 18).
Rationale
Proportion of patients receiving short-course regimen with apparent treatment response
98%, with 1% relapse
As reported with short-course regimen for patients susceptible to both 
fl
 uoroquinolone and pyrazinamide8
92·5%, with 1% relapse
Average across all patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis receiving the 
short-course regimen in Bangladesh9
85%, with 2·5% relapse
As reported with short-course regimen (with large uncertainty) for patients 
resistant to pyrazinamide only8
77%, with 4% relapse
Average outcomes of longer therapy
Outcome of longer therapy for patients ineligible for short-course regimen
Fair: 77% apparent 
response, with 4% relapse
Outcomes equivalent to the average outcome of longer therapy in the baseline 
scenario; might refl
 ect eff
 ective individualisation of treatment or limited drug 
resistance in ineligible patients (eg, resistance to pyrazinamide only)
Poor: 50% durably cured 
at end of therapy*
Corresponds to outcomes of longer therapy for patients with multidrug 
resistance and fl
 uoroquinolone resistance8
Very poor: 20% cured at 
2 years†
Most conservative assumption; those excluded have typical outcomes of 
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis on longer therapy
Proportion of patients ineligible for short-course regimen on the basis of second-line resistance and 
drug susceptibility testing practices
0%
No second-line drug susceptibility testing or no second-line resistance
10%
Line probe assay (for fl
 uoroquinolones and second-line injectables); levels of 
resistance similar to Pakistan and Bangladesh
30%
Line probe assay; levels of resistance similar to eastern Europe
50%
Exclusion of all patients with pyrazinamide or second-line drug resistance in a 
typical setting
*Corresponds to two-thirds having “fair” outcomes and a third having “very poor” outcomes. †Modelled as an ongoing 
probability of roughly 13% per year of cure and an ongoing tuberculosis mortality risk, resulting in roughly 23% death,

Discussion
This epidemic model suggests that implementation of 
the short-course regimen could have an important eff
 ect 
on the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic, with an 
estimated 23% reduction in incidence over 8 years relative 
to continued use of longer therapy. This eff
 ect depends 
on key assumptions, including improved long-term 
eff
 ectiveness, the ability to use resource savings to expand 
access, and minimised poor outcomes resulting from 
additional drug resistance. If these assumptions prove 
incorrect, then the short-course regimen could have 
minimal or even detrimental eff
 ect—eg, possibly having 
no eff
 ect on the incidence of multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis even if the number of people treated could 
be doubled. These fi
 ndings emphasise the need for 
additional data collection as the short-course regimen is 
rolled out and highlight that implementation of this 
regimen could have important population-level eff
 ects, 
but also that this result is far from certain.
More eff
 ective regimens for multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis are sorely needed, and a substantial 
proportion of the projected impact of a shorter regimen 
derives from the assumption of superior effi
  cacy in those 
treated. The high treatment success rates (>80%) and low 
relapse risks (<1%)8 of the short-course regimen observed 
in initial cohorts are promising compared with longer 
therapy (50% success rate worldwide1 and 62% in those 
who would have met inclusion criteria for the short-course 
regimen).8 Whether effi
  cacy of this new regimen is truly 
superior (and durable) awaits the results of an ongoing 
clinical trial.14 Our results suggest that if the short-course 
regimen is not more effi
  cacious than longer therapy in 
eligible patients, then its impact will largely depend on 
whether it can facilitate expansion of treatment access 
and whether patients with disqualifying resistance can be 
appropriately triaged and successfully treated. In hotspots 
of more extensive drug resistance, the conditions under 
which the short-course regimen off
 ers benefi
 t will be 
more limited and will depend even more on the achievable 
gains in effi
  cacy and resource use.
Because of the high cost of traditional care, the 
potential to diagnose and treat more patients within 
constrained budgets contributes strongly to the 
short-course regimen’s potential eff
 ects. Our projections 
are similar to an estimate of the eff
 ect of universal Xpert 
use in India, accompanied by gradual improvement in 
treatment outcomes (ie, 25% reduction in incidence of 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis over a decade).31 
However, unlike that analysis, we explored a mechanism 
(short-course regimen) by which such increased 
treatment access and improved treatment outcomes 
could potentially be achieved in a budget-neutral 
manner, if per-patient savings were used to identify and 
treat more patients. If resources were reallocated 
elsewhere, the eff
 ect of the short-course regimen on 
incidence would shrink, but the overall impact on 
burdened tuberculosis control programmes and health 
systems, as well as on patients for whom multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis can be economically devastating, 
could remain substantial. Future analyses to explicitly 
assess the economic eff
 ects of the short-course regimen 
are warranted. We also assumed that availability of 
clofazimine will meet demands, that second-line drug 
susceptibility can be tested before patients are lost to 
follow-up, and that the short-course regimen will be 
scaled up rapidly. To the extent that scale-up is slow, 
incomplete, or associated with increased pretreatment 
losses to follow-up, the eff
 ect will be diminished. 
Moreover, although children and extrapulmonary 
tuberculosis contribute little to tuberculosis trans-
mission, the still-uncertain usefulness of the short-
course regimen in such populations will aff
 ect its ability 
to reduce morbidity and mortality of multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis.
Our model highlights an important drawback of the 
short-course regimen: its reliance on component drugs 
to which resistance is prevalent in some populations.5,32 
At baseline, we assumed that 10% of people without 
previous treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
would be identifi
 ed as having resistance to fl
 uoro-
quinolones 
or 
second-generation 
aminoglycosides 
(ie, contraindications to the short-course regimen) and 
excluded on that basis. In settings where this proportion 
is 30%33 or higher,34 we projected a substantially 
diminished eff
 ect of the new regimen. Similarly, 
settings that implement the short-course regimen 
without suffi
  cient capacity for rapid second-line drug 
susceptibility 
testing 
might 
experience 
reduced

eff
 ectiveness and diminished short-term benefi
 t, as well 
as long-term risk of amplifi
 ed second-line drug 
resistance. Pyrazinamide resistance also could limit the 
eff
 ect of the short-course regimen. Pyrazinamide is 
included for the whole duration of the regimen and 
might be important for ensuring good treatment 
outcomes or preventing additional drug resistance, but 
37–81% of multidrug-resistant strains might be 
pyrazinamide resistant.5 Therefore, assess 
ment of 
pyrazinamide’s role is urgently needed; if further study 
determines 
that 
individuals 
with 
resistance 
to 
pyrazinamide should also be excluded from this 
regimen (resulting in exclusion of nearly 50% of 
patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 
southeast Asia5 and a greater proportion in some other 
settings35), then the regimen’s population-level eff
 ect is 
likely to be very small.
As with all modelling studies, our analysis has some 
limitations. Our model projections refl
 ect uncertainty 
related to trends in resistance to fi
 rst-line and 
second-line drugs, rapidly changing diagnostic and 
treatment practices, and the scarcity of data on the 
population dynamics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. 
Importantly, our homogeneously mixed model could 
have overestimated the eff
 ect of this regimen in specifi
 c 
settings. We also simplifi
 ed the dynamic representation 
of drug resistance to only two strains. Resistance to other 
drugs was implicitly factored into treatment outcomes, 
but transmission of multiple drug-resistant strains was 
not explicitly modelled. For this reason, we limited 
projections to a relatively short (<10 year) timeframe over 
which the selection of resistance to second-line drugs is 
expected to have relatively little epidemiological eff
 ect. 
Mounting second-line resistance, if it occurs, could lead 
to worse outcomes over time than those projected here, 
especially in the long term. Future modelling analyses 
could assess the eff
 ect of the short-course regimen on the 
acquisition and emergence of fl
 uoroquinolone resistance. 
We were also unable to model all the complexities of 
tuberculosis epidemics—for example, we did not 
explicitly model individual heterogeneity in HIV or 
diabetes status or variation in tuberculosis-associated or 
background mortality over time, but these factors might 
be important considerations in certain settings.
In summary, this modelling analysis illustrates the 
potential important eff
 ects of a newly recommended 
short-course regimen on the multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis epidemic. However, it also highlights that 
this eff
 ect is dependent on certain key factors, including 
the regimen’s long-term effi
  cacy, the ability to facilitate 
scale-up of treatment access through resource savings, 
and the number and outcomes of patients who are 
excluded on the basis of additional drug resistance. 
Crucial data in estimating the ultimate eff
 ect of this 
regimen include evidence of durable effi
  cacy from 
randomised controlled trials and data for the eff
 ect of 
pyrazinamide resistance, which is highly prevalent in 
patients with multidrug resistance. Additional research 
to develop improved regimens in the future will be 
essential, in view of the key limitations of the present 
short-course regimen. Ultimately, in making urgent 
decisions about whether to implement this new 
regimen at the country and global levels, the potential 
to reduce incidence by 20% or more needs to be 
weighed against the substantial uncertainty still 
surrounding the long-term eff
 ects of this regimen on 
the 
population 
dynamics 
of 
multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis.

 erent 
combinations of apparent response to short-course regimen and regimen exclusions, by treatment outcome 
in those excluded
(A) Fair—77% apparent response, with 4% relapse. (B) Poor—50% durably cured at end of therapy. (C) Very poor—20% 
cured at 2 years. Data are median (95% uncertainty range). Diff
 erences in modelled treatment outcomes refl
 ect not 
only the effi
  cacy of the regimen but also the prevalence of additional drug resistance in the population and the drug 
susceptibility test used. Since these underlying values are diffi
  cult to measure, this fi
 gure provides decision makers with 
projections of impact according to three measurable parameters. The rationale for these characteristics is explained in 
table 4. Specifi
 c scenarios of interest, which assume published point estimates of effi
  cacy of the short-course regimen 
in diff
 erent subgroups,8 are indicated as follows. *Second-line line probe assay screening in an area of very low 
prevalence of additional resistance. †Full phenotypic drug susceptibility tests (or full rapid drug susceptibility tests if 
available in the future) used in an area of moderate prevalence of second-line resistance. ‡Regimen implemented 
without having second-line drug susceptibility tests available in an area of moderate prevalence of second-line 
resistance. §Second-line line probe assay screening in an area of moderate prevalence of additional resistance.
