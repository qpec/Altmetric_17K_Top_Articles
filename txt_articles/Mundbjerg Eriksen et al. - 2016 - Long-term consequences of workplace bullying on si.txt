ABSTRACT 
 
Long-term Consequences of Workplace Bullying on 
Sickness Absence* 
 
Bullying in workplaces is a problem thought to harm individual productivity. This paper 
investigates whether being exposed to bullying in the workplace increases long-term 
sickness absence. We analyze employees from a selection of workplaces from The Bullying 
Cohort Study conducted in Denmark in 2006. The Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised was 
used to avoid bias related to self-labeling as being bullied. We account for important 
confounders, such as historical information on sickness absence and mental health, obtained 
through rich registry data. Our results show that gender does not significantly explain 
exposure to bullying and that exposure to bullying is associated with negative immediate self-
reported health for both genders. We also find, however, that only bullied females have 
higher, persistent increases in long-term sickness absence and adverse long-term health. 
This suggests that men and women have different coping strategies. We investigate plausible 
explanations for this and find that the differences cannot be explained by, for example, 
turnover or lack of employment. Although insignificant, our results nonetheless indicate that 
men are twice as likely to leave the labor force immediately after exposure to bullying.

Introduction
Public expenditures related to sickness absence are staggering. In 2008 the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries spent an average of
1.2% of their gross domestic product on disability and 0.8% on sickness benefits (OECD,
2010). According to OECD (2010), 50-90% of the individuals receiving disability benefits
did so after a period of sickness absence. Sickness absence can therefore be considered
very costly to society.1 While various economic research, e.g. Ziebarth and Karlsson
(2010, 2014) and Johansson and Palme (2005), has mainly focused on how economic
incentives affect the duration of sickness absence, only few researchers investigate how
factors pertaining to the work environment affect sickness absence. Ose (2005) finds that
a poor work environment increases long-term sickness absence, while Røed and Fevang
(2007) find that the process of downsizing increases the level of sickness absence among
nurses still working.
One relevant factor related to the work environment is bullying. Previous research
shows that bullying can have severe detrimental consequences for the individual’s health
and well-being, which is likely to induce reduced productivity in firms and society (Vartia,
2001, Kivim¨
aki et al., 2003, Niedhammer et al., 2006). At the same time, prevalence rates
are high, ranging from an average of 4-10% of workers in Scandinavian countries to 14-
25% of workers in other non-Scandinavian countries (Nielsen et al., 2010).2 Despite this,
studies documenting the effect of bullying on economic outcomes are scarce. Kivimaki
et al. (2000) find a positive relationship between bullying and sickness absence in hospital
staff, while Ortega et al. (2011) find the same in a sample of employees in the elderly care
sector. These studies, however, only correct for previous health and sickness absence to a
minor extent, and they only consider spells of absence within the first year after bullying
is observed. If exposure to bullying leads to severe health issues, such as depression, it
is likely that individuals will also suffer in the long run. This paper investigates the
long-term consequences of workplace bullying for men and women while, in contrast
to previous literature, adjusting for important confounders such as previous employee
health and sickness absence history.
1Additional costs that should be considered include, e.g., healthcare costs and foregone productivity.
2Prevalence rates depend on the measure of bullying being used.
3
 We contribute to the existing literature in several ways. First, as mentioned above,
little knowledge is available on the impact of workplace bullying on sickness absence,
especially the long-term consequences remain to be investigated. Second, the empirical
analyses are based on a unique dataset combining information on bullying, psychosocial
work environment, negative acts, and other related work environmental measures from
The Bullying Cohort Study with rich Danish registry data such that issues concerning
common variance bias and reverse causality are limited.3 Third, our analysis employs
the well-documented Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R) to measure bul-
lying (Einarsen et al., 2009).
Instead of employing a self-assessment of whether the
individual feels bullied, the NAQ-R asks about exposure to specific actions, making it
a more objective measure of bullying comparable across individuals. The NAQ-R con-
sists of 21 items on various negative actions. We follow the literature (e.g. Mikkelsen
and Einarsen, 2001 and Nielsen et al., 2009) and define individuals as a target of bul-
lying if they have been subject to a minimum of two negative actions weekly within
the past six months. Fourth, while we acknowledge that identification is particularly
difficult due to non-random selection of targets, our study controls for a rich set of
variables descriptive of both exposure to bullying and worker health. The conditioning
set includes previous sickness absence, prescription drug usage, mental and behavioral
diagnoses, socio-economic status, workplace fixed effects, and demographics.4 As pos-
sible confounders may still be a concern, we test the robustness of our results to the
inclusion of personality traits and work environment characteristics. Finally, we investi-
gate whether health, turnover, presenteeism (attending work while sick), and health are
channels through which bullying may affect sickness absence.
Seven percent of the respondents in our sample can be identified as having been
exposed to bullying in 2006.
Our results show that, while gender does not explain
exposure to bullying once we condition on workplace fixed effects, a significant and
negative relationship only exists between workplace bullying and sickness absence for
women. For females, being exposed to workplace bullying is associated with more than
double the amount of long-term sickness absence compared to their non-bullied female

ronment (NRCWE) in Denmark in 2006.

 coworkers.
This suggests that reducing bullying by 50% corresponds to an effect of
increasing the cost of sickness absence by 5% if Johansson and Palme’s (2005) cost
elasticity for long-term spells of absence for women is applied. The relationship persists
for two years before fading away. The results are robust to the inclusion of personality
and work environment characteristics.
A further investigation of the health of the individuals shows that, although men
and women are bullied to the same extent and being exposed to bullying is associated
with adverse immediate self-reported health for both genders, bullying is only related to
adverse long-term health for women. This suggests that men and women have different
coping strategies. We investigate a number of plausible explanations and find that when
exposed to workplace bullying, neither men nor women have more short-term (< 2 weeks)
sickness spells of absence than their non-bullied coworkers. Differences do not appear to
be due to either turnover or lack of employment either, although women appear to be
significantly more likely to have left the workplace after four years, which could explain
the reduction in long-term sickness absence after 2009 for this subgroup. Our findings,
show, however, that men report higher levels of presenteeism and are four percentage
points more likely to leave the labor force immediately after exposure to bullying (the
coefficients are insignificant, possibly due to the small sample size). These may explain
why men do not have more long-term sickness absence when exposed to bullying.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The next section discusses why
workplace bullying is likely to have negative consequences for the individual. Section
3 then presents the available data, explains how we identify bullying and describes our
outcomes and the conditioning set. Next, section 4 presents the results and section 5
carries out a range of robustness checks, while section 6 discusses possible mechanisms.
Finally, section 7 concludes.

Why Does Bullying Affect Sickness Absence?
Bullying can be defined as a situation where a person is repeatedly, over a longer
period of time, subject to negative actions from which he or she finds it difficult to
defend him- or herself.
5
 (e.g., Hansen et al. (2011)).
Negative actions are defined as behaviors which, when they occur on a regular basis,
can cause severe harm to the individual (Einarsen et al., 2009). Examples include social
exclusion, being yelled at, and physical violence. According to this definition, in order for
the actions to qualify as bullying, they have to persist over a longer period of time5 and
the power relationship between the target and the perpetrator(s) must be asymmetrical,
such that the target is unable to defend him or herself. As mentioned above, however,
little is known about the long-term consequences of these negative actions.
According to psychological stress theory, stress occurs when an imbalance exists
between the demands or challenges individuals face and their own resources (Bakker and
Demerouti, 2007). At the workplace these stressors, as they are often called, typically
consist of e.g., workload, role uncertainty, time pressure, and conflicts. Most people
will experience stressful events during the course of their life but if the events persist
over a longer period, it may be harmful to the individual’s health. As the definition
above highlights, bullying must persist for a longer period to result in the likely adverse
health effects. Similarly strain theory (Agnew, 1992) also suggests that bullying has
negative consequences for the individual’s health. Individuals who experience a strain
(such as bullying) may produce negative emotions such as anger, frustration, anxiety, or
depression, which may lead to a corrective action in terms of, for instance, wrongdoing,
self-harm or suicide. Thus, from a theoretical perspective, bullying is likely to affect the
individual’s health, which may in turn affect sickness absence.
Economists have mainly focussed on how economic incentives affect sickness absence.
In their analysis, Johansson and Palme (2005) utilize changes in the replacement rates
of sickness benefits in Sweden. Using a differences-in-differences model and Cox propor-
tional hazard regressions, they find that the duration of sickness absence is negatively
related to cost increases but positively related to cost decreases. Using the results from
the Cox regressions, they find a cost elasticity of -0.87 for durations between eight and
90 days for women. Ziebarth and Karlsson (2010) exploit a reduction in the replacement
rate from 100 to 80% for private employees in Germany in 1996. Comparing the affected
private employees with a matched sample of non-affected public employees, they find
5The norm within the existing literature is six months.
6
 that the reduction of 20% in the replacement rate increases the share of non-absent em-
ployees by 6.5%. At the same time, the reduction cuts the number of days of absence
in the 50-70th percentile by approximately 12%. Some unions were able to negotiate
retainment of a 100% replacement rate, which meant that a selection of private employ-
ees were not affected by the cut in the replacement rate. When Ziebarth and Karlsson
(2010) compare the non-affected private employees with affected private employees, they
find that the reduction in the replacement rate increases absence by 28%. Ziebarth and
Karlsson (2014) exploit that the same reform was rolled back in 1999 such that replace-
ment rates returned to 100%. Using the same approach, as in their previous paper, they
find that increasing the replacement rate by 25% increased the number of sick days for
the treated individuals by 10%. The resulting arc elasticity resembles the cost elasticities
in Johansson and Palme (2005).
While we have been unable to find economic papers that study the effect of working
conditions on health, a few studies do investigate how working conditions affect absen-
teeism. Røed and Fevang (2007) study how downsizing, which can be thought to affect,
e.g., job security, workload, and role uncertainty, leads to increased sickness absence
among nurses in Norway. Using a competing risks hazard model, they find that down-
sizing exceeding 20% increases the hazard into sickness absence by 7% and decreases the
hazard out of sickness by 10% of nurses still employed.
Bratberg and Monstad (2015) utilize a financial shock in Norway in 2007 that only hit
some local authorities. Using a differences-in-differences approach, they compare public
employees hit by the shock to public employees not hit by the shock. Their findings
indicate that an increase in job insecurity has a disciplinary effect in that experiencing
the shock decreased the level of sickness absence by 10% for women and 23% for men.
This is in line with results by Ichino and Riphahn (2005), who find, that at the end of
the initial probationary period when full job protection is granted, absenteeism increased
among white-collar workers in an Italian bank.
Ose (2005) incorporates working conditions in an efficiency wage model to explain
voluntary and involuntary absences. She tests the model on Norwegian data. In Nor-
way, long-term sickness absence require a doctor’s note, whereas short-term (< 3 days)
spells of sickness absence do not. As a result, short-term absence is considered voluntary
7
 absence, while long-term absence is considered involuntary absence due to actual illness.
Ose’s results support the theoretical model in that wages only affect short-term absence.
The working environment factors influence both short-term and long-term absence, in-
dicating that workers are not fully compensated. Johansson and Palme (1996) find that
accidents at work and work-related diseases increase work absence.
To our knowledge no economic studies exist examining the effect of bullying on health
or sickness absence.
Studies within the field of organizational psychology, however,
show that bullying is associated with increased levels of sickness absence. In a study
of hospital staff in Finland, Kivimaki et al. (2000) find that being subject to bullying
is associated with an increase in medically certified sickness absence.6 In a sample of
elderly care workers (96.3% were women), Ortega et al. (2011) find that frequent bullying
is associated with increased levels of long-term (> 6 consecutive weeks) sickness absence
within the year after bullying was observed.78 Other studies find that being exposed to
bullying as well as witnessing bullying is associated with depressive symptoms, general
stress and mental stress reactions, psychosomatic and psychological stress symptoms
(Niedhammer et al., 2006, Agervold and Mikkelsen, 2004, Hansen et al., 2011, Vartia,
2001). In general, targets of bullying report lower well-being, lower self-esteem, sleep
problems, anxiety, concentration difficulties, fatigue, burnout, anger, depression, and
stress symptoms (see, e.g., Nielsen and Einarsen, 2012). The previous literature thus
suggests that bullying leads to increased absenteeism and adverse health, although causal
relationships have not been established.
While this section discussed how bullying may affect sickness absence and highlighted
health as a possible mechanism through which bullying affects health, other plausible
channels are conceivable. Individuals may choose to leave the workplace or the workforce,
or attend work although they feel sick, in which case we would expect to see little or
no effect on sickness absence. Section 6 investigates whether bullying affects short-term
or long-term health, whether it affects short-term sickness absence, whether it leads to

risks, chronic diseases, and baseline sickness absence.

 increases in turnover or changes in employment and labor force participation. Finally 6
also studies whether bullying affects presenteeism.

Data
This section summarizes the data used in the empirical analysis. We start by introducing
the sample. Second, we describe how we identify targets of bullying. We then explain
the outcomes that we employ in the main analysis. The final subsection describes our
conditioning set and conducts a probit regression of the propensity to be bullied.
The data stem from the Bullying Cohort Study conducted in 2006 by the Danish
National Research Centre for the Working Environment (NRCWE)9 which recruited
workplaces via an online open invitation on the websites of professional organizations.
Ninety companies (28 private and 62 public) showed interest in the study, but only com-
panies with more than 30 employees were asked to attend, leaving 79 eligible companies
of which 60 (22 private, 38 public) agreed to participate.10 The companies provided
NRCWE with employee email addresses, after which questionnaires were sent directly
to employees with a return envelope to NRCWE. There were 3358 people who responded
to the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 45.9%.11
The questionnaire does not focus solely on bullying but instead contains a long list
of questions of a demographic nature and items on the psychosocial work environment,
negative acts, bullying, physical and psychological stress reactions, health, sleep, and
sickness absenteeism. The survey data are merged with the Danish registry data using
the respondents’ civil registration number. The registry data contain information on
a large number of important characteristics such as demographics, socio-economic sta-
tus, current employment, workplace identifiers, prescription drug use, and somatic and
psychiatric diagnoses from general hospitals. In addition, the data are augmented with
data from the Danish Register for Evaluation of Marginalization (DREAM) collected by
the Danish Ministry of Employment. DREAM contains weekly information on everyone
in Denmark who collects government benefits, thus enabling us to obtain precise infor-

 mation on sickness absenteeism as well as information on, for example, unemployment,
previous labor market history, and previous sickness absence history.
We restrict the sample to the 54 companies that had more than ten employees respond
to the questionnaire to make sure that we match workers and workplaces correctly.12
We are able to identify the corresponding workplaces in the registries, resulting in 136
workplaces. A workplace is defined as a physical place. A company can, however, have
multiple branches placed throughout the country, in which case we may be comparing
individuals who, for instance, are not generally in contact with one another, answer to
the same manager, or have the same colleagues, if we conduct the fixed effect analysis
based on companies. We further delete workplaces where less than three employees re-
spond to the items on bullying as we use fixed effects in the empirical analysis. This gives
us a sample of 54 companies divided into 104 workplaces with 3227 respondents. We
delete another 27 respondents because the data indicate that they are retired before the
survey period. Finally, we delete 18 respondents as they did not respond to the NAQ-R,
thus reducing the final number of respondents to 3182 employees in 104 workplaces.13
An obvious concern is whether the companies who attended the study did so because
they faced problems related to bullying and sickness absence. Unfortunately, we cannot
determine the level of bullying in firms that did not participate in the survey. Data on
levels of long-term sickness absence for all working individuals in Denmark are, however
obtainable. Comparing means, we find that, although the differences in long-term sick-
ness absence are significant, there seems to be no systematic pattern between the firms
who participate in the survey and the general population of firms within industries (see
B).
3.1
Identifying bullying
We identify exposure to workplace bullying using the 21-item NAQ-R (Einarsen et al.,
2009), a scale widely used in workplace bullying literature whose external validity has
12The employees were surveyed from September 2006 to November 2006 and information on place of
employment in the Danish registry data is based on employment in November 2006.
13The main results are unchanged using the full sample of respondents (3312 observations) who are
not retired prior to the survey period.
10
 been confirmed by a number of studies.14
The questionnaire measures various nega-
tive actions (NA) such as “Someone withholding information which affects your per-
formance”, “Being humiliated or ridiculed in connection with your work,” and “Being
ignored or excluded”. The respondents are asked how often they have been exposed
to the NA (“Never”; “Now and then”; “Monthly”; “Weekly”; or “Daily”) within the
past six months. C shows the full questionnaire. The scale shows good internal validity
with a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO) of 0.93 and a Cron-
bach’s Alpha of 0.88 (see F). Note in particular that the NAQ-R was asked before any
mentioning of the word bullying in the questionnaire.
Following the literature (e.g. Mikkelsen and Einarsen, 2001 and Nielsen et al., 2009),
we identify a respondent as being a target of bullying if individuals reply that they have
been subject to at least two NA daily or weekly during the past six months.15 Based on
this definition 7% of the respondents are exposed to workplace bullying, which is similar
to previously reported prevalence rates using two NA as the cut-off criteria (Nielsen et al.,
2009 and Mikkelsen and Einarsen, 2001). Forty-nine percent of the bullied individuals
report more than two NA, and the average number of actions reported is approximately
three. More than 30% of the bullied individuals report that they experience that “some-
one withholds information that affects their performance”, “they are given unreasonable
deadlines”, and “are ordered to work below their level of competence” weekly or daily.
About 13% report that they are “being excluded”, “humiliated” or “subject to gossip”
at least weekly, 9% even say that they are “being shouted at or subject to spontaneous
anger” weekly or daily. We observe more NA related to the respondent’s work, but still
a fair amount of individuals are subject to actions related to their person. The full list
of frequencies are reported in the table in C.16
A common concern when measuring bullying is measurement error. Although the
14Nielsen et al. (2010) find 16 studies based on the NAQ-R in a meta-analysis of measurement methods
for workplace bullying.
15The conclusions are robust to alternative definitions of bullying. In general we find that just experi-
encing one NA compared to zero NA does not increase long-term absence. Experiencing two or more NA
significantly increases sickness absence. Using a continuous measure of the number of NA, the coefficient
is positive and significant (at a 10% level in 2007 and at a 5% level in 2008 and 2009). We also find
indications that the more NA an individual is exposed to, the larger the coefficient on bullying. Results
available from the authors upon request.
16The results do not appear to be driven by any particular negative action. Results available from the
authors upon request.
11
 individuals are asked to rate exposure to a set of specific actions instead of self-labeling
themselves as being bullied, whether someone, for example feels that they are “being
excluded” is still a subjective evaluation. Thus, what may make one person feel excluded
may not be the case for someone else. The questionnaire also presents the respondents
with a definition of bullying and asks whether any of their colleagues have been exposed
to bullying within the past six months. We use this to study the connection between
being identified as bullied and having coworkers report that a colleague is subject to
bullying. Only two out of 104 workplaces have an individual identified as a target of
bullying without colleagues reporting that they witness bullying.
In 72 workplaces,
someone is a target of bullying and coworkers also reporting that they witness bullying.
In 16 workplaces a colleague reports witnessing bullying but no one is identified as a
target of bullying. These figures indicate that there may be a tendency to underreport
NA as there are plausible negative connotations associated with them. Another possible
explanation is that the non-respondents in a workplace are more likely to be exposed to
bullying. Insofar that bullying leads to poorer health and more sickness absence, this
selection will tend to bias our results downwards.
3.2
Outcomes
Our main outcome is the average amount of long-term sickness absence annually from
2007 to 2011. In Denmark, people are entitled to compensation due to sickness absence
for 52 out of the past 78 weeks regardless of whether they receive unemployment benefits,
are in subsidized employment, or are in regular employment.17 If someone is employed,
the right to wages during sick leave depends on the contract. However, the employer
is, in any case, obliged to pay the equivalent of sickness benefits during the first three
weeks of absence. Afterwards, the local authority covers payments equal to the amount
of sickness benefits (about USD700/week in 2013). DREAM only registers the benefits
covered by the local authority, which means that we only observe spells of sickness
absence with durations of more than three weeks for individuals employed in the private
sector. For this reason, we only consider spells of absence that last more than three
weeks. From 2001 to 2011, we add together the individual’s weeks of sickness absence
17In special cases, it can be extended by up to a year.
12
 annually in excess of three weeks if the spells are at least three weeks long.

Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations of yearly long-term sickness
absence. From 2001 to 2005, we observe no significant differences between targets and
their non-bullied co-workers. In 2006, the year of the survey, individuals exposed to
bullying have significantly more sickness absence. This is to be expected as respondents
are asked whether they have been subject to NA within the past six months prior to
the time of the survey, which was conducted in the latter half of 2006. Thus, if bullying
increases sickness absence, we should already observe a difference in 2006. We will return
to this issue in section 4.1. We continue to observe significant differences in weeks of
long-term sickness absence between bullied employees and their non-bullied coworkers
from 2007 to 2010. The average amount of sickness absence ranges from two to three
weeks. In section 4, we investigate whether these differences persist when controlling for
possible confounders and workplace fixed effects.
3.2.1
A note on employment
Although sickness absence is also registered for the individuals who receive unemploy-
ment benefits or are in subsidized employment, the incentives for these people to register
sickness absence may be less pronounced. A relevant argument is therefore that the lack
of difference in sickness absence before 2006 and the decrease in the difference in absence
after 2009 in Table 1 is due to the fact that the individuals who were exposed to bullying
13
 are now unemploymed, or even worse, outside the labor force. Table 2 shows employ-
ment rates from 2001 to 2011.18
Only in 2001 and 2002 do we observe a significant
difference in employment rates between the bullied and non-bullied.19 The employment
rates increase up until 2006, which is to be expected since being employed in 2006 is
a stipulation for participating in the survey. The rates then drop again subsequently.
The trend seems to be the same for bullied and non-bullied individuals, suggesting that
employment is not a particular concern. In section 6, however, we will investigate a mea-
sure of being out of the labor force in order to address the decrease in sickness absence
in 2010 and 2011.

3.3
The conditioning set
The relationship between bullying and sickness absence is likely to be confounded by
a large range of different characteristics. In this section we describe the characteristics
previously identified as important antecedents and traits of targets of bullying. This is
followed by a description of the conditioning set employed in the analysis below.
Researchers in psychology and sociology have long tried to identify traits that increase
18Employment is defined as having at least six months of accumulated work experience within the
given year.
19If we define employment as having at least nine months accumulated work experience, employment
levels show the same pattern and are only significantly different for bullied and non-bullied individuals
in 2001 at a 10% significance level. Results are available from the authors upon request.
14
 the risk of exposure to bullying. According to the definition of bullying some asymmetry
in the power relationship between the parties has to persist in order for episodes to
classify as bullying. This suggests that characteristics such as seniority, age, level of
education, and ethnicity are likely antecedents of bullying. However, previous findings
are inconclusive as to whether demographic characteristics, like being older and having
a higher education, reduce the probability of being bullied (See, e.g., Mikkelsen and
Einarsen, 2001, Hogh et al., 2005).
Work related characteristics such as demands, management style, job security, and
organizational changes have been associated with workplace bullying. Although gender
does not seem to affect whether the individual is exposed to bullying (e.g., Hogh et al.,
2005), bullying does seem to thrive in workplaces dominated by one gender (Matthiesen
and Einarsen, 2007 and Eriksen and Einarsen, 2004). Minorities are more frequently
subject to bullying as they create an implicit difference in power (see the definition of
bullying). Belonging to the dominated gender is similar to belonging to a minority. At
the same time, the perception of the pattern of gender roles may further induce bullying
of the minority (e.g., male nurses, female carpenters). Similarly, employees with lower
hierarchical status in the workplace are more frequently exposed to bullying (Aquino,
2000).
Aquino and Bradfield (2000) investigate whether certain personality traits are more
likely to foster exposure to bullying compared to others. They find that highly aggressive
personalities, as well as individuals with high negative affectivity, are more often subject
to bullying.20
We see that a long list of characteristics, both related to the individual and to the
workplace, may influence whether the individual is exposed to workplace bullying. At the
same time, these characteristics may be related to sickness absence. Failure to account
for variables that affect both the propensity to be bullied and the outcome of interest
will bias our results.
We utilize our access to the extremely rich Danish Registry Data. Our models control
20Aggressiveness is defined as the underlying trait that predisposes some individuals to attack more
readily than others in response to environmental stimuli (Aquino and Bradfield, 2000). The fact that a
person reacts more aggressively to threats might encourage retaliation by the other part. Negative affec-
tivity refers to a unidimensional, pervasive disposition to experience high levels of distressing emotions
such as anger, hostility, fear, or anxiety.
15
 for individual characteristics such as gender, age, education, ethnicity, and civil status.
To minimize bias due to endogeneity, all conditioning variables are measured in the year
prior to the survey (2005) or earlier. As mentioned above, previous literature points to
the importance of personality traits, but, unfortunately, we do not have information on
traits, such as negative affectivity, prior to observed bullying status. We do, however,
have access to information on whether the individual has received any diagnoses of a
mental or behavioral disorder through the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, which
covers all contacts with the regional psychiatric treatment system prior to observed bul-
lying.
These diagnoses include, for example, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Such cases can involve medical treat-
ment without diagnosis. As a result, we include pre-2006 use of antidepressants and
psycholeptics used to treat the diagnoses mentioned above. To our knowledge, no other
study includes registry-based information on diagnoses and prescription drug use.
We also account for work-related factors such as tenure, sector, average earnings from
2001 to 2005, and working hours. In order to account for workplace-specific factors, we
include a workplace fixed effect. This accounts for organizational traits that are constant
within the firms in 2006, such as a particularly bad manager, high workloads, and
industry. A workplace fixed effect further accounts for the gender ratio and overall level of
sickness absence in the workplace. We include information on historic prescription drug
use in terms of whether the individual has received any antidepressants and psycholeptics
from 2001 to 2005, as well as the sum of weeks of sickness absence from 2001 to 2005.
Finally, we control for pre-survey unemployment history, again measured by the sum of
unemployment weeks from 2001 to 2005.
Table 3 presents the means and standard deviation of a selection of characteristics by
bullying status. We see that targets of bullying differ from their non-bullied colleagues
on most demographic characteristics. They are younger, more likely to be male, less
likely to be married, and more likely to be divorced.
They also differ on a range of work-related characteristics. Targets have less tenure
in the company and are more likely to be employed in the public sector. The individual’s
position in the company does not seem to matter for exposure to bullying. Unemploy-
ment history also differs by bullying status in that targets have a history of more weeks

 of unemployment than their non-bullied coworkers prior to 2006. In relation to informa-
tion on pre-2006 sickness absence and health, we find that targets of bullying have less,
though insignificant, sickness absence prior to 2006.21 Mean values on the use of antide-
pressants and psycholeptics are higher for individuals exposed to bullying, but again the
differences are only borderline significant for the use of antidepressant medication.
3.3.1
Propensity to be a target of bullying
We model the propensity to be exposed to workplace bullying with the following equa-
tion:
Bulliediw = 1
�
Z�
iγ + νw + �i > 0
�
,
where
(1)
Z =
�
X, W, H
�
.
where X is a vector of individual characteristics, W is a vector of work and employment-
related characteristics, and H is a vector of previous health history. We include work-
place fixed effects νw. Equation (1) is estimated by a standard probit regression. Table 4
reports the marginal effects evaluated at the mean of the independent variables. In con-
trast to the implications of Table 3, once we condition on all the covariates and workplace
fixed effects, we see that not many characteristics matter for the probability of being
exposed to bullying. Being married and having more tenure decrease the probability of
being a target. Being unemployed in 2005 makes you less likely to be bullied, compared
to being a lower level employee, which indicates that people needs to be settled in the
workplace to a certain extent in order to experience bullying.
In general, the workplace fixed effects seem to be of high importance. The joint signif-
icance test of the fixed effects is very high, indicating that there is something important
going on within the workplaces related to bullying. While the data do not allow us to
distinguish selection of individuals into workplaces from workplace characteristics, such
as poor management, the questionnaire does contain an item on whether the respondent
had previously been subject to bullying and if so, where.22 We use this item to construct
21Sickness absence for unemployed individuals is also registered in DREAM under the same rules that
apply to public employees. In this case, the unemployment fund is considered their employer.
22The exact wording of the item is: “Have you previously been bullied?” and the response categories
are: “No.”; “Yes, in school.”; “Yes, in a previous workplace.”; “Yes, in the present workplace.”; “Yes,

 four different mutually exclusive groups: Never Bullied (NB); Newly Bullied (NWB);
Always Bullied (AB); and Previously Bullied (PB). NWB comprises respondents who
experience two or more NA in 2006 and who state that they have not previously been
bullied, etc.23 If PB individuals are only bullied in their previous workplace, it suggests
that bullying is a feature of the workplace. If, on the other hand, AB individuals are
bullied in both a previous and current workplace, it suggests that bullying is due to
individual characteristics. We find that 18% of PB and 27% of AB individuals report
being bullied in a previous workplace while 8% of PB and 11% of AB report that they
were previously bullied in their current workplace. This suggests that 1) leaving the
workplace does not necessarily stop bullying and that 2) a significant amount of individ-
uals stay in a workplace and bullying discontinues. It thus appears that a workplace can
take measures to stop bullying. A regression of the number of shifts between workplaces
in 2001 to 2006 for each of the four categories of bullying shows that bullied individuals
have significantly more shifts than non-bullied individuals, and that AB individuals have
significantly more shifts than PB individuals.24 Although we cannot observe whether a
change of workplace was a result of being bullied, the results still imply that individuals
change workplace until they find a place where they are not bullied. In section 6, we
will discuss plausible coping strategies, such as leaving one’s workplace.
Taken together, the results demonstrate that both individual and workplace char-
acteristics matter, and insofar that these have a direct effect on sickness absence, it is
important to account for them in our subsequent analysis.

Results
This section starts by comparing the development in sickness absence of bullied and
non-bullied employees around the survey period in order to address reasonable worries
about reverse causality. We then present and estimate our model, gradually increasing
our conditioning set. This allows us to investigate how the relationship between being
exposed to bullying and long-term sickness absence depends on observable character-
while studying.”; “Yes, in my free time.”; and “Yes, somewhere else.”
23Note that the respondents answer to whether they have been bullied previously based on the defini-
tion of bullying (see section 2) and not according to the NAQ-R.

 istics. Finally we investigate the heterogeneity of our results by splitting the sample
according to gender.
4.1
Measuring bullying and the development in weekly sickness ab-
sence
An important concern is whether individuals are being bullied due to their sickness
absence, in which case we cannot rule out reverse causality. Figure 1 plots average long-
term sickness absence for bullied and non-bullied individuals on a weekly basis. The
bar shaded grey indicates the weeks in which individuals were surveyed. We do not
observe a spike in sickness absence before the survey, which would give rise to concerns
about reverse causality. It does seem as if the targets of bullying have slightly more
sickness absence prior to the survey, but recall that they are asked about NA within the
past six months. We would therefore expect to see some differences in sickness absence
prior to the survey period.25
Figure 1, however, may also imply that there is little
Figure 1: Weekly Average Long-term Sickness Absence by Bullying Status in 2006
25As mentioned above employment may be an issue in that there are less incentives to register absence
for unemployed individuals which is why we reconstruct Figure 1 conditioning on being in employment.
The figure is practically unchanged, further emphasizing that employment is not an issue for this analysis.

21
 or no persistence in bullying, or at least that the individuals who had previously been
exposed to bullying did not experience higher levels of sickness absence. As our sample
is implicitly conditioned on being employed in the weeks of the survey in 2006, it is
conceivable that the people hurt most by bullying in the past will not be in the sample.
As mentioned above, the questionnaire includes an item asking whether the respondent
had previously been subject to bullying. A mean comparison of the targets and non-
targets shows that targets were no more likely to have been bullied previously than
non-targets, suggesting that persistence is not a big issue in this sample. We also exploit
the item to create the four groups AB, NWB, PB and NB, as described in subsection
3.3.1. Figure 2 replicates Figure 1 using the new definitions of exposure to bullying.
Figure 2: Weekly Average Long-term Sickness Absence by Bullying Status in 2006
There does not appear to be a significant difference in sickness absence between NB and
PB individuals.26 The development in sickness absence is more volatile for NWB and
26A raw mean comparison shows that between 2001 and 2008, PB individuals only have significantly
more absence compared to NB individuals in 2002 (Coef. equals 0.33 weeks). Furthermore 73% of PB
individuals indicate that the bullying happened in school. This could explain why we do not observe a
higher level of sickness absence for this group (except in 2002) compared to NB individuals (The table
can be found in D).
22
 AB individuals, probably due to the smaller sample size (95 individuals are identified
as AB and 109 individuals as NWB), but before 2006 they fluctuate around the same
mean as the NB and PB individuals.27 After 2006, we see a spike, which is larger for AB
than NWB individuals. This could reflect that recurring exposure to bullying is more
harmful.28 Again, the findings suggest that we need not worry about the persistence of
bullying.
Another concern is that being asked about bullying may cause people to call in sick.
By Figure 1 we cannot rule out that this is the case. We do, however, find it highly
implausible that merely asking individuals about bullying leads to the large persistence
in sickness absence that Figure 1 shows. Recall that Figure 1 only contains spells of
sickness absence with a total duration of more than three weeks.
4.2
The relationship between bullying and sickness absence: Account-
ing for observable characteristics
Table 1 and Figure 1 indicate that targets of bullying experience significantly more long-
term sickness absence than their non-bullied colleagues. Other factors that influence both
exposure to bullying and sickness absence, however, may explain this relationship, as
mentioned above. In order to take these factors into account, we estimate the relationship
between workplace bullying and long-term sickness absence using ordinary least squares
(OLS) estimation, gradually expanding the conditioning set in the regressions.
The
regression can be summarized by the following equation:
yiw = Z�
iγ + β�Bullied + νw + �i,
where
(2)
Z =
�
X, W, H
�
.
27Comparing raw means, we find no significant differences in absence between NWB and NB before
2007. Comparing AB to NB, absence is slightly higher for the AB individuals. However, all differences
are insignificant prior to 2006. See D.
28The conclusions are robust to the alternative specification of exposure to bullying where we only
compare NWB to NB individuals. However, unlike in our main results (presented below), the relationship
now only persists for two years (2007 and 2008). We also restrict the sample to new employees (individuals
who changed workplace between 2005 and 2006) since previous bullying should be less of an issue for this
subsample. Again, our conclusions are robust to this specification, and we now find that the persistence
in sickness absence appears to be even more widespread. Results available from the authors upon request.
23
 yiw refers to sickness absence from 2007 to 2011 of individual i in workplace w. Bullied
is an indicator for being a target of workplace bullying and the coefficient β is our
parameter of interest. β captures everything happening between our identification of
being a target of bullying in 2006 up until the year in which the outcome is measured.
As a result we cannot distinguish whether the relationship is due to lasting scares or
because bullying causes bullying. Z is the rich set of conditioning variables mentioned in
section 3.3 and νw is a workplace fixed effect. We begin by estimating the relationship
between bullying and the outcome excluding any confounders. Next, we include the
individual characteristics X. This conditioning set resembles what is most often available
to researchers through registries. We then expand Z to also include registry information
on labor market history and employment related characteristics W, as well as workplace
fixed effects νw. Finally we include pre-2006 sickness absence, prescription drug use, and
diagnosis of a behavioral or mental disorder H in the conditioning set. Again, note that
all conditioning variables are measured in 2005 or earlier.
According to the results presented in Table 5, targets of workplace bullying have a
significantly higher level of long-term sickness absence than their non-bullied colleagues
in the first three years after we observe bullying. The relationship fades away and is com-
pletely gone in 2011. The results are only affected, to a minor extent, by the expansion
of the conditioning set, which means that they are not driven by certain individual char-
acteristics, pre-2006 sickness absence, poor management, or a bad company culture at
the workplace, previous use of antidepressant medication, or even a diagnosis of mental
or behavioral disorder.
The estimates are also significant in an economic sense. The final model suggests
that being exposed to workplace bullying in 2006 increases long-term sickness absence
in 2007-2009 by about 1.3 weeks. In other words, individuals exposed to bullying have
more than twice the sickness absence than their non-bullied colleagues.
Since 2010, employers are required to speak with employees who are off sick within
the first four weeks of absence. Primarily, the purpose of this talk is first of all to provide
the local authority with information regarding the absence and to talk about how best
to tackle the situation to facilitate a quick return to work. The employee is not required
to submit a doctor’s note, but the employer may ask for it (for Labour Market and

Recruitment, 2010). Similar to Ose (2005), we expect our observed sickness absence to
reflect actual absence due to illness. In section 6, we will discuss, however, that bullying
affects the individual’s health as an explanation of why absence increases.
4.3
Gender heterogeneity
We investigate the heterogeneity of the results by splitting the sample by gender.29
There is no reason to believe that men and women will react similarly when experiencing
workplace bullying, and it is not obvious that the different characteristics will affect the
exposure to bullying in the same way across genders. For instance, a highly educated
man may induce respect, whereas a highly educated woman may be seen as a threat
(Derks et al., 2011). Table 6 presents the results of the separate regressions for the
male and female sample. We now only observe a positive and significant correlation
between bullying and sickness absence for women from 2007 to 2009. Excluding any
other explanatory variables from the regressions, women exposed to bullying have, on
average, 2.3 weeks more of long-term sickness absence than their non-bullied female
29However, we cannot reject the Chow test of equal coefficients for men and women.
25
 colleagues in 2007. Including the full conditioning set only reduces this results by 0.13
weeks, equal to about one day. If we compare this to an average of 1.6 weeks of long-
term sickness absence for non-bullied women, bullying more than doubles the amount
of absence. If we apply the cost elasticity on the duration of long-term spells of absence
for women found in Johansson and Palme (2005), our results imply that reducing the
probability of being bullied by 50% corresponds to an increase in the cost of sickness
absence of 5%. Ziebarth and Karlsson (2014) obtain a similar elasticity, their findings
showing that an increase in the replacement rate from 80 to 100% increased the number
of sickness days by 20% for the compliers.
As before, the relationship is persistent but now only significant at a 10% level in
2009. Before, the size of the estimates was constantly equal to 1.2 weeks from 2007 to
2009 but now appears to decrease by about one day per year. In contrast to the results
for women, we observe no significant differences for men. The coefficients are small, and
they are only slightly affected by the expansion of the conditioning set. This suggests
that the lack of relationship is not merely due to the small sample size. Men apparently
do not seem to have more long-term sickness absence when exposed to bullying.
A possible explanation for the gender differences in the results is that men and
women are exposed to different bullying behavior. A thorough investigation of the type
and frequency of the NA shows that men are exposed to more NA than women and at
a higher frequency. When the sample is divided into work-related, person-related, and
physically intimidating bullying, men are at least as likely to be exposed to work and
person-related bullying and more likely to be physically intimidated.30
Observe also that the relationship for women disappears after three years. There
are different explanations for this. Either bullying is dealt with, or the composition of
workers in the workplace has changed such that either the target or the perpetrator(s)
do not work together anymore. This is very plausible in Danish workplaces, as more
than 50% of employees in this sample have left their workplace after four years. We will
return to turnover below.
According to the propensity score in subsection 3.3.1, gender does not explain expo-
sure to bullying once we include workplace fixed effects. It also appears as if men and

 women are exposed to the same type of bullying behavior. Still, our results show that
being bullied at work only significantly increases long-term sickness absence for women
and not for men. These results point toward that 1) the health of men and women are
affected differently or that 2) they employ different coping strategies when exposed to
workplace bullying. See, for example, Kristofferzon et al. (2003), who find that men
often want to go back to work when they are recovering from health problems, whereas
women need more time at home.
In order to understand why the differences in sickness absence emerge, we investigate
the relationship between bullying, health, turnover, and labor force attachment in section
6. First, however, we conduct a series of robustness checks on the results above.
5
Robustness
In the previous section, we showed that our results are robust to the inclusion of an
extensive conditioning set. In order to further increase our confidence in the results, we
conduct a series of additional robustness checks. We add plausible confounders such as
personality and work environment characteristics. These robustness checks are reported
for the female employees as the results presented above were still not significant for male
employees when expanding the conditioning set to include variables on personality and
the working environment.31 In all models, we condition on the full set of individual and
work-related characteristics, workplace fixed effects, and pre-2006 health.
5.1
Personality characteristics
As mentioned previously, personality characteristics are likely to affect whether a person
is subject to bullying and the individual’s level of sickness absence. Previous studies
have, for example found positive correlations between personality traits such as negative
affectivity and workplace bullying (Aquino and Bradfield, 2000). People with high nega-
tive affectivity view themselves and aspects of the world negatively. Negative affectivity
roughly corresponds to the personality factor of anxiety/neuroticism from the Big Five
personality traits questionnaire. Positive affectivity, on the other hand, refers to how
31We find that in 2011 at a 10% significance level, men who are subject to bullying have one less
sickday when including all work environment variables.
28
 people experience positive emotions and roughly corresponds to the extraversion person-
ality factor (Costa and McCrae, 1980). Both measures of affectivity are believed to be
fairly stable over time, and having high negative affectivity does not imply low positive
affectivity or vice versa (Watson and Clark, 1984). The questionnaire contains the Posi-
tive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measuring negative and positive affectivity
by asking individuals to what extent they have experienced 20 different emotions within
the past four weeks (Watson et al., 1988).32 The questionnaire also contains Setterlind
and Larsson’s (1995) Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, which measures to what extent
people believe events happen to them by intent or chance. This is important in relation
to coping strategies. If people do not believe that they can change the course of an
event, they are probably less likely to try. We measure SOC using nine different items.33
We do not include the personality measures in our main specification as they are likely
to be affected by exposure to bullying as everything is measured simultaneously in the
questionnaire. Affectivity is believed to be a stable trait, but the questionnaire asks
about feelings experienced within the past four weeks which we believe are likely to be
affected by exposure to bullying.
All three factors are extracted through confirmatory principal component analysis,
and scores are obtained using the regression method. Table 7 reports the results of our
preferred specification and the results when extending the conditioning set to include
all three personality characteristics. We see that the size of the estimates is slightly
reduced when conditioning on personality characteristics, but they remain significant
at a 10% level in 2007 and a 5% level in 2008. When significant, the coefficients on
the personality characteristics have the expected sign: positive affectivity is negative,
negative affectivity is positive, and SOC is only marginally significant and positive in
2011 (results not shown here).
32We exclude one item “Alert,” as it loads on negative affectivity instead of positive affectivity, in
contrast to the original scale. Cronbach’s alpha on negative affectivity is 0.88, and 0.87 on positive
affectivity, indicating excellent internal validity. F contains loadings and Cronbach’s alphas.
33Cronbach’s alpha on SOC is 0.78.

5.2
Work environment characteristics
The questionnaire also contains a wide variety of items related to various aspects of the
working environment. As mentioned previously, a vast amount of work environment
characteristics has been considered as antecedents of bullying. In addition, they may in-
dependently affect sickness absence. The items in the survey come from the Copenhagen
Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ II) (Pejtersen et al., 2010), which was developed
to measure the psychosocial work environment among Danish employees. The factors
are extracted using confirmatory factor analysis on the COPSOQ II scales and then
grouped as proposed in Pejtersen et al. (2010). The validity of the factors is assessed by
Cronbach’s alpha. All alphas range between 0.535 and 0.878.34 Table 8 summarizes the
results. Again, we see that the results are robust to the expansion of the conditioning
set. In 2007, the coefficient on bullying is only significant at a 10% level after adjusting
for job content. It remains significant at a 10% level after including additional controls.
The results in 2008 are not affected by the inclusion of the workplace characteristics. We
stress that caution should be exercised when interpreting these results as we believe that
characteristics like “perception of the manager”, “trust in colleagues”, “meaning”, and
“loyalty” are likely to be affected by the exposure to bullying. Nevertheless, our results
34See F for the full set of scales, Cronbach’s alphas, and loadings.
30
 are, to a large extent, robust to the inclusion of work environment characteristics.
The robustness checks support our previous findings. Being exposed to workplace
bullying is associated with increases in long-term sickness absence for women even when
conditioning on personality and work environment characteristics.35 The next section
discusses different explanations as to why we find a relationship for women and not for
men.
6
Health and coping strategies
The results above show that being exposed to workplace bullying increases sickness
absence for women but not for men. If bullying deteriorates health, we would expect
equal effects for men and women, but this is not what we find. A plausible explanation
is that men and women have different coping strategies. It may be the case that men
leave the workplace, whereas women stay, or men attend work even though they feel
sick. A third explanation could be a greater tendency among men to shirk. We can
identify this type of behavior in our subsample of public employees, insofar that short-
term absence can be viewed as shirking behavior, as described in Ose (2005).
The
relevant question is thus whether bullying affects health differently for men and women or
whether the results reflect different coping strategies for men and women. In this section,
we discuss the following possible explanations: health, short-term sickness absence or
shirking behavior, presenteeism, turnover, employment, and labor force participation.
As before, regressions are performed controlling for the main conditioning set, including
individual characteristics, work-related characteristics, workplace fixed effects, and pre-
2006 health.
6.1
Health measures
The questionnaire allows us to address an immediate measure of the respondent’s health,
which cannot be obtained through the registries. Respondents were asked to assess their
35The results are also robust to previous exposure to bullying for both men (insignificant) and women.
We do not know, however, exactly when bullying occurred, and it could be the case that the previous
episode actually reflects the current episode. Furthermore, the results for men (insignificant) and women
are robust to the inclusion of indicator variables for being underweight, normal weight, overweight, and
extremly overweight (defined by body mass index) measured in 2006. Results available from the authors

 overall health: “How good do you find your health?”, which is measured on a five-point
Likert scale and recoded on a scale from one to five, five indicating excellent health.
In this case, we are faced with common concerns when using self-reported measures,
such as common source bias and reverse causality, and we stress that the results should
be interpreted with caution. We still believe, however, that a subjective measure may
provide additional information as objective measures may not reflect whether the person
actually feels hampered due to health issues.
From the registry data, we obtain information on prescription drug use and diagnoses.
As mentioned above, bullying has been positively related to anxiety and depression in a
number of studies (e.g. Nielsen and Einarsen, 2012). We construct two dummy variables:
antidepressants are equal to one if the respondent purchased antidepressant medication
(Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System code N06A), and psy-
choleptics are equal to one if the individual purchased psycholeptics (ATC code N05)
between 2007 and 2011. Psycholeptics are usually used in the treatment of neuroses and
psychosomatic disorders related to anxiety and tension. Finally we construct a dummy
variable indicating whether the respondent had been diagnosed with a mental or behav-
ioral disorder five years after we observe bullying (International Classification of Diseases
(ICD-10) code F).36
Table 9 shows that targets of bullying report worse self-rated health than non-bullied
colleagues, and men seem to report health at least as bad as women’s. However, bullied
men do not tend to receive more antidepressant medication or psycholeptics or to be
diagnosed with a mental or behavioral disorder by 2011 compared to non-bullied men.
Bullied men thus have worse immediate health than their non-bullied coworkers, but
this difference is not observed in the health variables measured through the registries,
suggesting that health consequences for men are temporary or that they cope with the
issues themselves and do not involve general practitioners.
For women, we only see
significant differences in the use of antidepressants.
Women exposed to bullying are
more likely to use antidepressants than their non-bullied colleagues. Women’s health
thus seems to suffer both in the short and long-run when exposed to bullying.
36We constructed two other variables, a depression diagnosis variable and an anxiety diagnosis variable.
Cases of these diagnoses in the data, however, were limited to 13 cases each out of the 3182 respondents
in 2007. Results were therefore not reliable and hence not reported.

6.2
Public sector employees
In the main analysis, we were only able to consider long-term sickness absence since
spells below three weeks are not recorded in DREAM for private sector employees.37
For public sector employees we are able to observe absence from day one. We use this
subsample of employees to investigate two issues. Figure 3 plots average weekly sickness
absence (both long and short-term absence) for public employees. One potential concern
in Figure 1 is that being exposed to workplace bullying is driven by many short-term
spells of absence, which would indicate potential problems with reverse causality. If this
is the case, this graph would pick it up. Figure 3 is very similar to Figure 1. Thus,
short-term sickness spells of absence do not seem to drive bullying, at least in the public
sector.
Second, we use the sample to investigate whether short-term absence is used as a
coping strategy. It is conceivable that the reason we do not observe any increase in
long-term sickness absence for the subsample of men is that they are more likely to have
short-term absence spells, thus allowing them to cope with bullying. As a result, we run
our regressions on the restricted sample of public sector employees. The outcome is now
37This is due to a liability payment period for private companies in Denmark for the first three weeks
of sickness absence.
34
 Figure 3: Weekly Average Sickness Absence by Bullying Status in 2006
Public Sector Employees
sickness absence weeks measured from week one and contains both short and long-term
spells. Table 10 reports these results.
Targets of bullying employed in the public sector have, on average, two weeks more
absence than non-bullied public sector employees. As found previously, these results
are persistent for two years before gradually decreasing. The results are thus robust to
the inclusion of short-term absence. In terms of magnitude, the estimates are slightly
larger compared to the estimates using the full sample, but this is due to public sector
employees having more long-term sickness absence than private sector employees. When
we run the regressions on short-term absence (spells < 2weeks), we find no difference
among targets and non-bullied coworkers for men and women.38
A priori one would
think that bullying would lead to an initial level of discomfort and an increased level
of short-term sickness absence before accelerating into a higher level of impairment and
long-term absence. According to the results, this does not appear to be the case. Based
on conservation of resources theory, Conway et al. (2016) argue that targets of bullying
38Results available from the authors upon request.
35
 may refrain from taking sick leave in order to avoid being subject to further harassment
as a consequence of the leave. Bullied individuals may choose to go to work until their
health deteriorates to such an extent that long-term sickness absence is a last resort.
This theory is related to presenteeism, which we will discuss below.
Our results further support Ose’s (2005) theoretical model. She argues that a bad
work environment affects health and therefore only long-term and not short-term sickness
absence, as long-term absence should reflect actual health impairment, whereas short-
term absence is likely to reflect shirking behavior. In Denmark, individuals who are
away from work due to long-term illness are in contact with the workplace on a regular
basis, and the employer can ask for a doctor’s note in which case they would catch
shirking behavior, whereas short-term absence is not monitored. Consequently, if being
exposed to workplace bullying increases shirking behavior, we expect to see differences
in short-term and not in long-term sickness absence, which is not the case.

Presenteeism
More recently, psychologists and sociologists have addressed the phenomenon of presen-
teeism, which is defined as attending work while sick. Researchers argue that the effect
of bullying on sickness absence might not be as obvious as first expected because bul-
lied individuals will have a greater tendency to attend work even though they feel sick.
There are several reasons for this. Not attending work might be thought to imply a lack
of commitment to the workplace. In highly stressful workplaces, where notification of
illness causes grief for colleagues, targets might be afraid of creating yet another reason
to be harassed. The targets will also lose control of their work when they are away. They
might be excluded from important decisions, or they might be deprived of their original
work tasks (Conway et al., 2016). Conway et al. (2016) also find that frequently bullied
individuals more often attend work even though they are ill compared to non-bullied
individuals; however, the significance of the results disappears once they condition on
baseline presenteeism.39 The questionnaire asks respondents to state how many days
they went to work during the past year. Again, this measure is subject to issues such as
recall bias, reverse causality, and common source bias, and results should be interpreted
keeping this in mind. The coefficient on presenteeism in Table 11 is equal to 1.2 days
for women and 2.8 days for men. Both estimates, however, are insignificant due to large
standard errors. We cannot reject that the bullied individuals have the same amount
of presenteeism as non-bullied individuals, but the results point in the direction that
men may have a greater tendency to attend work even though they feel sick. This is
a possible explanation as to why we do not observe more sickness absence among men
subject to workplace bullying.
6.4
Turnover and employment
As mentioned above, bullying is also likely to affect the individual’s attachment to the
workplace. It is possible that men are more likely to leave the workplace if they are
exposed to workplace bullying, whereas women stay and try to mend things. Or it could
be that men’s outside options in the labor market are better compared to women’s,
39Their analysis is based on the same data source as used in this paper. They define bullying by
self-labeling according to the definition of bullying (see section 2).

making it easier for men to change workplace or occupation compared to women. We
construct a dummy variable equal to one if the respondent is still employed in the same
workplace in 2011 as at the time of the survey in 2006. The results are reported in
Table 11. Both point estimates for men and women are negative, suggesting that bullied
individuals are more likely to have left the workplace by 2011.
However, none are
significant. A further analysis shows that women are significantly more likely to leave in
2010, implying that leaving the workplace is a possible coping strategy for women. This
may explain why we observe that the significant difference in long-term sickness absence
disappears after 2009.
Turnover, of course, relies on the fact that an individual is in employment. If targets
of bullying in general are less likely to be employed, it will affect the results above. We
construct a variable employment equal to one if an individual has accumulated at least
six months of work experience in a given year. According to this definition, 82% of the
women and 83% of the men are in employment in 2011. Table 11 shows no significant
differences in employment rates between bullied and non-bullied individuals in 2011 for
either men or women.
Consequently, being a target of bullying does not mean that
individuals are less likely to be employed over time.40
40If we define employment to be at least nine months of work experience, we do find that men are less
38
 Leaving one’s workplace if subject to bullying is of course only effective if bullying is
due to workplace characteristics and not personal characteristics. In case of the latter,
we would expect bullying to reoccur in a new workplace. In subsection 3.3.1, 27% of AB
reported being bullied in a previous workplace, indicating that changing one’s workplace
does not eliminate the threat of being bullied.
Eight percent of the PB individuals
reported being bullied in their current workplace, suggesting that either the bullying
stopped or they made a transition within the workplace. Thus, although bullying does
not appear to affect employment, it may still affect the individual’s experience profile
through an increase in transitions within and between workplaces, which could be costly
in terms of, for instance, loss of promotions, future benefit levels, and pensions. While we
cannot observe transitions within workplaces we can investigate differences in logwage
income in 2011 between the individuals who were bullied in 2006 and those who were
not. We restrict this analysis to individuals in employment. Table 11 shows the results.
Bullied men earn 4% less than non-bullied men, which in monetary terms translates
into approximately USD1,900 a year. It is, however, insignificant with a p-value of 0.11.
The point estimate indicates a wage increase of 1.6% for women who are subject to
bullying, but it is highly insignificant. These results suggest that, although exposure to
bullying does not appear to affect employment rates, bullying may affect the individual’s
experience profile in the labor market. Future research should take a deeper look at the
dynamics between bullying and the transitions within and between workplaces to gain
a better understanding of the potential costs of bullying briefly touched upon in this
section.
6.5
Leaving the labor force
A final reason for why we may see that the relationship between bullying and sickness
absence is lacking for men and disappears for women could be that the individuals who
are exposed to bullying leave the labor force, in which case it is not possible to observe
sickness absence. In order to measure whether an individual is outside the labor force,
we construct a measure which is equal to one if an individual has spent more than six
months outside DREAM, in which case we do not observe any public transfer, and more
likely to be employed in 2011 if exposed to bullying.
39

Table 12 reports the results. We see that women are neither statistically nor econom-
ically more or less likely to leave the labor force after exposure to bullying.41 For the
male sample, the numbers indicate that 3-4% of men may in fact be more likely to leave
the labor force in the two years following being bullied. This is compared to an average
of 7% of non-bullied men being outside the labor force in 2006 and 2007. Thus, bullied
men appear to be almost twice as likely to leave the labor force than their non-bullied
colleagues, which could explain why we do not observe that bullying is associated with
increases in long-term sickness absence for men. The numbers, however, are insignificant
(the coefficient in 2007 is significant at a 10% level), probably due to the small sample
size. Five years after being exposed to bullying, men are, just like women, no more or
less likely to leave the labor force than their non-bullied colleagues.
41On average 2% of the women are observed to be outside the labor force in 2007-2011.
40
 Although men and women seem to be exposed to the same kind of bullying behavior
and both genders have significantly worse immediate health when exposed to bullying,
this section indicates that bullying only has adverse long-term effects on health for
women. Either the health of men is not severely affected by bullying (as seeking medical
attention due to bullying is perhaps too stigmatizing), or they have a tendency to attend
work while sick. Our results are consistent with this explanation, but it is difficult to
draw inferences from them. The results do not appear to be due to the shirking behavior
of either men or women. We also test whether the lack of results for men is due to the
fact that they leave the workplace, employment, or the labor force. Our findings indicate
that men leave the labor force for a short period of time, but the results are insignificant.
We do not address the perception of bullying in this paper. Although men report at
least as many, if not more, and more frequent NA, they might not perceive the actions to
be as negative as women do. Similarly, we cannot address who commits the NA. From
the questionnaire, we know that 10% of the women and 15% of the men report that they
have committed at least one of the NA themselves. It could be the case that the actions
are more harmful if committed by the opposite gender, in which case we would expect
women to be more affected. Another concern is that women are highly overrepresented
in this sample. It would be relevant to conduct the same analysis on a representative
sample of workplaces before concluding that men are not affected by bullying in terms
of deteriorated health and increased sickness absence.

Conclusion
This paper investigates the detrimental effects on sickness absence of being exposed
to workplace bullying in a sample of Danish workplaces. As a measure of workplace
bullying, we employ the NAQ-R, which is thought to be more reliable than the self-
labeling of being bullied. In addition, we obtain registry-based information on previous
sickness absence as well as mental health measures, such as prescription drug use, and
diagnoses of behavioral and mental disorders.
Both are plausible confounders.
Our
results show that, although men and women are exposed to the same types of negative
behavior and both have significantly worse immediate health when exposed to bullying,
we only observe a significant relationship on long-term sickness absence for women. The
41
 estimates show that being exposed to workplace bullying doubles long-term sickness
absence (by about two weeks a year) for women. In other words, a 50% reduction in the
probability of being bullied causes the same decrease in sickness absence as a 5% increase
in the cost of sickness absence. The results are robust to the inclusion of personality
traits and workplace characteristics.
It is puzzling that the exposure to bullying does not lead to increased levels of absence
for men. We test whether health and coping strategies can explain this. We find that
bullying is not associated with short-term sickness absence for either gender in the sample
of public employees. Insofar that we consider long-term sickness absence to reflect poor
health and not shirking behavior, being exposed to workplace bullying is only associated
with adverse health for women, and neither gender is more likely to shirk as a result of
bullying. For women, we found increases in the use of antidepressant medication in the
years after bullying, indicating long-term health consequences of exposure to bullying.
For men, we found no significant effects on long-term health, although there was some
indication that men reported higher levels of presenteeism when exposed to bullying.
Finally, we investigated whether the absence of significant differences could be explained
by turnover or lack of labor force participation. We found that women are significantly
more likely to leave their workplace in 2010, possibly explaining why the relationship
with long-term sickness absence disappears after 2009. Men, however, appear to receive
lower wage income when exposed to bullying, which could indicate that bullying affects,
e.g., their within workplace transitions and promotion probabilities. Furthermore, the
findings on men may indicate that they are more likely to leave the labor force when
exposed to bullying, which may explain why we did not observe more sickness absence for
men after the exposure to bullying. The results, however, were insignificant,42 possibly
due to a relatively small sample size of men.
We were not able to investigate whether the differences in the results for men and
women were due to differences in characteristics of the perpetrators of bullying. Previ-
ous studies (Kivimaki et al., 2000, Ortega et al., 2011), unfortunately, do not consider
heterogeneity in gender, which means that further investigation is needed in order to ob-
serve whether our findings are general. Finally, we want to stress that the effects of the

 exposure to workplace bullying are particularly difficult to identify, and our estimates
should be interpreted with this in mind.
The results point toward significant benefits from reducing workplace bullying. From
a manager’s point of view, implementing strategies to reduce workplace bullying thus
appears to be best practice.
So why does bullying still take place in firms?
First,
we cannot reject that bullying is a consequence of personal characteristics. At the same
time, we also find that workplace characteristics seem to matter. Only a few intervention
studies on workplace bullying have been conducted, and their level of quality is not
satisfactory enough to permit unambiguous recommendations (Hodgins et al., 2014).
This is probably a reflection of the fact that we still lack knowledge on what causes
bullying. As a result, an important next step for future research is to look into the
dynamics of bullying and the transitions within and between workplaces. This will give
us a better understanding of whether it is the workplace itself, the composition of the
employees, or the personal characteristics of the individuals that can explain exposure
to bullying.

 A
Attrition
The response rate in the questionnaires was 45.9%. The Integrated Database for La-
bor Market Research (IDA) contains all individuals registered to be working at the
workplaces of the respondents, thus allowing a comparison of characteristics of the re-
spondents and non-respondent observed in the Danish registry data.
Note that our
sample here is larger than the original sample of respondents who received the ques-
tionnaires. Only workplaces are observed in IDA, but it may be particular departments
of a workplace that received the questionnaire. Unfortunately, we do not have access
to the civil registration numbers of the non-respondents.
Our results, however, give
an indication of the differences between the respondents and the population of workers
at their workplaces. We run a probit regression on a binary indicator of whether the
individual answered the questionnaire or not using a range of characteristics. Table A
summarizes marginal effects and standard errors. We observe significant differences in
many demographic characteristics; however, these differences are likely to be due to a
large sample size since the coefficients are close to zero, e.g., age and tenure. In general,
there is no clear pattern in the coefficients. Respondents are slightly less likely to have
a higher education (bachelor degree and above); however, they are at the same time
much more likely to be employed in a top management position. Full-time employees
and private sector employees are much more likely to answer the questionnaire. The sum
of weeks of sickness absence from 2001 to 2005 is significant at a 10% level, but, again,
the coefficient is very small. If anything, the table indicates that individuals who have a
better job, are married, and of Danish origin, and thus individuals we would expect to
be less likely to be bullied, who responded to the questionnaire. In so far that bullying
increases sickness absence, this would downward bias our results.

*These two scales are constructed from the three scales, horizontal and vertical trust, and justice and respect.
The three scales do not discriminate well against one another. As a result, an explorative principal component
analysis was conducted and items that were cross loading were deleted. Two factors were extracted with loadings
above 0.68 and named as shown.
