ABSTRACT 
Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease, resulting in 
significant morbidity. A hallmark of AD is disruption of the critical barrier function of 
upper epidermal layers, causatively linked to environmental stimuli, genetics and 
infection, and a critical current target for the development of new therapeutic and 
prophylactic interventions. S. aureus is an AD-associated pathogen producing 
virulence factors which induce skin barrier disruption in vivo and contribute to AD 
pathogenesis. We demonstrate, using immortalised and primary keratinocytes, that S. 
aureus protease SspA/V8 is the dominant secreted factor (in laboratory and AD 
clinical strains of S. aureus) inducing barrier integrity impairment and tight junction 
damage. V8-induced integrity damage was inhibited by an IL-1β-mediated 
mechanism, independent of effects on claudin-1. Induction of keratinocyte expression 
of the antimicrobial / host defence peptide human beta defensin 2 (hBD2) was found 
to be the mechanism underpinning this protective effect. Endogenous hBD2 
expression was required and sufficient for protection against V8 protease-mediated 
integrity damage, and exogenous application of hBD2 was protective. This 
modulatory property of hBD2, unrelated to antibacterial effects, gives new 
significance to the defective induction of hBD2 in the barrier-defective skin lesions of 
AD, and indicates therapeutic potential.

INTRODUCTION 
Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a common relapsing inflammatory skin disease affecting 
15-20% of children (Asher et al., 2006) and 2-10% of adults (Bieber, 2008) 
worldwide (<10.7% and 10.2% in the U.S.A., respectively (Shaw et al., 2011; 
Silverberg and Hanifin, 2013) with significant morbidity. The disease is characterised 
by chronic, inflamed, itchy lesions, typically on the face, scalp and limbs. A key 
hallmark of AD is disruption of upper epidermal layer barrier function, causatively 
linked to environmental stimuli, genetics (e.g. Filaggrin mutations), and infections 
(Bieber, 2008).  
AD lesions are particularly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus 
(Bieber, 2008; Hata and Gallo, 2008). S. aureus is found on the skin of <30% of 
healthy individuals, mainly in intertriginous areas (Park et al., 2013). However 
75-100% of AD patients have S. aureus on their lesional skin and 30-100% of AD 
patients have S. aureus on their non-lesional skin (Breuer et al., 2002; Gong et al., 
2006; Park et al., 2013). S. aureus secrete a range of virulence factors, including 
extracellular toxins and proteases which contribute to disease pathogenesis 
(Nakamura et al., 2013). Serine protease A (SspA), also known as V8 protease, is a 
well-characterised extracellular protease widely expressed among different S. aureus 
strains (Drapeau et al., 1972; Kolar et al., 2013). The pathogenic effect of V8 protease 
has been demonstrated in vivo, damaging murine skin integrity via effects on stratum 
corneum (SC) (Hirasawa et al., 2010; Ohnemus et al., 2008). Although the targets for 
V8-mediated damage remain unclear, S. aureus extracellular proteases can cleave 
tight junction (TJ) proteins, including Claudins, Occludin and ZO-1, and Desmogleins 
(Hirasawa et al., 2010; Ohnemus et al., 2008), aggravating skin barrier dysfunction. 
The capacity of proteases to induce barrier dysfunction is proposed as a key driving 
force in the initiation and exacerbation of AD (Takai and Ikeda, 2011). Thus, 
understanding the host factors that maintain barrier function is a priority in developing 
novel therapeutic approaches. 
AD is also characterised by the altered expression of antimicrobial / host defence

peptides (HDP), including members of the β-defensin family. β-defensins hBD2 and 
hBD3 are induced by skin wounding and inflammatory stimuli, and are highly 
expressed in inflamed psoriatic skin lesions. In contrast, β-defensins are present at 
significantly lower levels in the inflamed skin lesions from AD individuals (Ong et al., 
2002). Although some β-defensin induction is observed in AD lesions compared to 
non-lesional skin (Harder et al., 2010), impaired β-defensin induction and/or release 
in AD is proposed to result from the effects of Th2 cytokines, and to be insufficient to 
protect against infection. The expression of HDP in psoriasis and AD correlates with 
susceptibility to infection (Breuer et al., 2002; Schauber and Gallo, 2009), suggesting 
a key microbicidal role. However, these HDP also have a wide range of modulatory 
activities, raising the possibility of additional roles in skin host defence (Cox et al., 
2014).  
Here we demonstrate that V8 is the dominant factor in S. aureus-mediated 
keratinocyte barrier integrity damage, that IL-1β can induce keratinocyte production 
of factors with potent protective activity, and that hBD2 is required and sufficient for 
this protection. These data reveal a protective function for the antimicrobial HDP 
hBD2, informing potential therapeutic approaches to prevent S. aureus mediated 
aggravation of skin barrier dysfunction in AD.

RESULTS 
 
S. aureus secreted proteases damage keratinocyte barrier integrity. 
The effect of secreted S. aureus proteases were examined in an in vitro 
monolayer damage assay, using HaCaT keratinocyte cells grown to confluency 
(Figure 1a-f). Application of bacterial supernatant from two different wild-type strains 
of S. aureus (83225-4 and USA300 JE2) produced visible areas of integrity damage 
(Figure 1b,c). No damage was observed in media-only controls (Figure 1a). 
Significantly less damage occurred when supernatants from mutant strains of S. 
aureus deficient in serine proteases SspABC (strain LES22 (Shaw et al., 2004)) or 
mutated to specifically delete SspA/V8 protease (strain USA300 DV8 (Fey et al., 
2013) were applied, compared to parent strains 83225-4 (Figure 1d,e,f). These data 
demonstrate a model of barrier integrity damage, induced by S. aureus-secreted 
proteases and requiring V8 protease. 
 
S. aureus serine protease A (SspA/V8) damages barrier integrity without causing 
cell death. 
To establish whether V8 protease was sufficient to induce barrier integrity 
damage in the absence of other S. aureus secreted factors, HaCaT cells were treated 
with recombinant V8 protease for 24 hours. Integrity damage was observed in a 
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2a-c), with a phenotype similar to that 
observed using bacterial supernatant. Significant damage was observed at 3µg/ml V8, 
a concentration previously equated to protease levels found at S. aureus colonised 
sites 
of 
AD 
patients 
(Miedzobrodzki 
et 
al., 
2002). 
Significant 
and 
concentration-dependent V8 protease-mediated monolayer damage was also 
demonstrated using human primary epidermal keratinocytes (HPEK) (Figure 2d-f), 
but showing a more diffuse integrity disruption phenotype (Figure 2d,f). These data 
demonstrate that V8 protease alone is sufficient to induce barrier integrity damage, 
both in primary and immortalised keratinocyte cultures.

barrier integrity (Ohnemus et al., 2008). Consistent with this report, western blotting 
of HaCaT keratinocyte lysates showed a significant reduction in claudin-1 after 
treatment with V8 protease in a dose dependent manner (Figure 2g,h). 
Measurements of cellular cytotoxicity (LDH release, Figure 2i) or apoptosis 
(Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)) staining, 
Figure 2j) showed no significant impact of V8 treatment in either HaCaT or HPEK 
cells. In contrast, treatment with staurosporine (as a positive control for apoptosis) 
induced a significant level of TUNEL staining in both cell types (Figure 2h,i), but did 
not induce the barrier integrity damage mediated by V8 (data not shown), 
demonstrating that this phenotype was not dependent upon cell death.  
 
Pre-treatment with IL-1β induces protection of keratinocyte monolayers against 
S. aureus V8 protease–mediated damage. 
IL-1β is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine proposed to modulate expression of TJ 
proteins and to have impaired production in AD (Abe et al., 2003; Jakob et al., 1995; 
Nomura et al., 2003). To establish whether IL-1β induced protection against S. aureus 
proteases, HaCaT cells were treated with IL-1β for 24 hours, and exposed to 3µg/ml 
V8 protease (Figure 3a) or S. aureus supernatant (Figure 3b). IL-1β exposure induced 
significant protection against integrity damage from V8 protease (88% reduction; 
Figure 3a) and S. aureus supernatant (99% reduction; Figure 3b), in a 
concentration-dependent manner (Supplemental Figure S1). This was also observed in 
primary cells exposed to 6µg/ml V8 protease (Figure 3c).  
Baseline levels of claudin-1 were significantly increased in HaCaT cells 
following IL-1β exposure (58% increase; Figure 3d), compatible with TJ-mediated 
enhanced protection against V8-induced integrity damage. However, IL-1β 
stimulation did not prevent V8 protease-mediated reduction of claudin-1 levels, with 
decreases of 53% and 46% (without and with IL-1β respectively) induced by 10µg/ml 
V8 protease (Figure 3d). Furthermore, in HPEK cells, claudin-1 was not significantly 
affected by pre-treatment with IL-1β (Figure 3e), indicating dependence upon 
alternative or additional IL-1β-induced mechanisms.

IL-1β treatment of keratinocytes induces expression of a soluble protective 
factor. 
To determine the nature of IL-1β-induced protection against V8, media transfer 
studies were conducted between IL-1β-treated keratinocytes and naïve cells, prior to 
V8 exposure (Figure 4a). After 24 hours exposure to IL-1β, media was discarded, 
cells were washed to remove residual IL-1β, and fresh media was added for 48 hours 
to generate conditioned media (CM) which was transferred onto naïve cells. Both 
naïve HaCaT and HPEK cells exposed to CM from IL-1β-treated cells (but not from 
control cells) were significantly protected against V8 protease (Figure 4a). These data 
demonstrate that IL-1β induces keratinocyte production of a secreted, transferrable 
protective factor. 
IL-1β can stimulate expression of human β-defensins in keratinocytes; including 
hBD2 and hBD3, but not hBD1 (King et al., 2002). HaCaT cell expression of DEFB1, 
DEFB4 and DEFB103 (encoding hBD1, hBD2 and hBD3 respectively) was therefore 
quantified by RT-PCR in cells exposed to IL-1β, or to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or heat-killed skin commensal S. epidermidis (HKSE; 
previously shown to suppress pathogens by stimulating HDP expression (Lai et al., 
2010)). Transcription of DEFB4 (hBD2) was not detected in unstimulated HaCaT 
cells, but was significantly induced by IL-1β stimulation (Figure 4b), but not by the 
other stimuli. In contrast, DEFB103 (hBD3) expression was not detected (data not 
shown) and, in agreement with published data, DEFB1 (hBD1) expression was not 
significantly induced by any of these stimuli (Figure 4b). Keratinocyte production of 
hBD2 peptide was therefore examined by ELISA, and found to be significantly 
induced by exposure to IL-1β exposure (6-fold increase, to approximately 300pg/ml), 
but not to LTA or LPS (Figure 4c). Interestingly, HKSE also stimulated hBD2 release 
(9-fold increase), despite not affecting DEFB4 transcription. Production of hBD2 
correlated with protection against V8-mediated damage, with significant protection 
observed in cells treated with IL-1β or HKSE, but not LTA or LPS (Figure 4d).

Given the correlation between hBD2 induction and protection, hBD2 was 
assessed as a candidate secreted, protective factor. A time course of IL-1β-mediated 
hBD2 induction in HaCaT cells showed a significant increase of secreted hBD2 at 
48-72 hours after treatment with IL-1β (Figure 4e). These findings are compatible 
with the time point used in V8 damage and CM transfer studies above (Figure 3a, 3b, 
4a). Significant induction of hBD2 was also observed in IL-1β-stimulated HPEK cells 
to approximately 1000pg/ml (9-fold increase; Figure 4f), correlating with significant 
protection from V8 damage (Figure 3c).

against

protease-mediated damage. 
To determine whether hBD2 induction was causatively associated with protection 
against V8 protease, a DEFB4 stably over-expressing HaCaT cell line (hBD2 OE) and 
corresponding vector-only control line (VO control) were constructed. Constitutive 
DEFB4 transcription was demonstrated in hBD2 OE cells without IL-1β stimulation 
(Figure 5a), and significant hBD2 peptide secretion detected (at approximately 
100pg/ml, compared to <20pg/ml in VO control cells; Figure 5b). Correspondingly, 
hBD2 OE cells were significantly protected against V8 protease, compared to VO 
control cells (Figure 5c). In addition, transfer of CM from hBD2 OE cells, but not 
from VO control cells, significantly protected naive HaCaT cells against V8 
protease-mediated damage (Figure 5d). These data demonstrate that constitutive 
endogenous hBD2 expression, in the absence of IL-1β, is sufficient to replicate the 
IL-1β-mediated protective phenotype against V8-induced integrity damage. 
Claudin-1 levels were also assessed in hBD2 OE (Figure 5e). V8-mediated 
significant reduction in claudin-1 levels in hBD2 OE and VO controls, but in contrast 
to IL-1β-stimulation of HaCaT cells (Figure 3d), constitutive endogenous hBD2 
expression did not increase claudin-1. These data confirm that hBD2-mediated 
protection is not a result of increased claudin-1 expression.

Keratinocyte hBD2 production is required for IL-1β-mediated protection against 
V8 protease-induced damage. 
To establish whether hBD2 expression was required for IL-1β-mediated 
protection against V8 protease-induced keratinocyte integrity damage, two different 
stable HaCaT hBD2 shRNA knock-down keratinocyte cell lines (DEFB4 shRNA 1 
and 2) and a non-targeting control shRNA line were generated. hBD2 knock-down 
was verified by ELISA, demonstrated by failure to induce hBD2 in response to IL-1β 
in either DEFB4 shRNA line, with levels significantly (~80%) lower than the control 
(Figure 5f). Both DEFB4 shRNA lines showed significant impairment of 
IL-1β-mediated protection against V8-induced monolayer damage, compared to the 
non-targeting shRNA control line (Figure 5g). These data demonstrate that 
IL-1β-induced endogenous hBD2 expression is required for this protective phenotype. 
 
Addition of exogenous hBD2 protects against V8 protease-mediated damage. 
Having established that induction of endogenous hBD2 expression is protective 
against V8 protease-induced damage, the therapeutic potential of exogenously applied 
peptide was determined. Addition of either purified recombinant hBD2, or chemically 
synthesised hBD2 (but not a scrambled sequence version of the peptide, nor vehicle 
control) to unstimulated keratinocytes prior to V8 protease exposure, significantly 
protected HaCaT cells (Figure 5h) and HPEK cells (Figure 5i) against damage. These 
data demonstrate that exogenously applied hBD2 can reconstitute the protective 
phenotype against V8 protease and raise the possibility of therapeutic applications.

DISCUSSION 
The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and the role of innate host defence-mediated 
protection of epidermal integrity in AD remains incompletely understood. However, 
defects in epidermal barrier function in AD are highly associated with dry skin and 
hyperactive immune response to allergens (Cork et al., 2006; Sabin et al., 2012). In 
addition, recent clinical trials demonstrate that restoring and maintaining barrier 
integrity is critical in preventing AD onset in neonates (Horimukai et al., 2014; 
Simpson et al., 2014), confirming the fundamental importance of epidermal integrity. 
The capacity of proteases to induce barrier dysfunction is proposed as a key driving 
force in AD initiation and exacerbation (Takai and Ikeda, 2011). We therefore 
hypothesised that innate host defence against proteolytic virulence factors produced 
by the common AD skin pathogen S. aureus may be vital to maintaining barrier 
function. 
In order to determine the impact of bacterial proteases on keratinocyte function, the 
effects of S. aureus-conditioned media (in the absence of live bacteria) were evaluated 
using immortalised and primary keratinocyte monolayer culture models. These studies 
generated an integrity damage model and established that the primary S. aureus 
secreted factor was V8 protease (SspA). Interestingly V8 exposure generated discrete 
“holes” in HaCaT monolayers, without inducing cell death. Indeed, experimental 
induction of apoptosis did not replicate this phenotype. In live cell imaging, rapid 
contraction from the centre of such “holes” was observed (data not shown), with a 
concentrated band of phalloidin-positive signal seen around the “hole” edge (Figure 
2c), suggestive of central foci of TJ failure and cell retraction from that point. In 
keeping with this, we demonstrate V8-cleavage of claudin-1 in this model. 
Interestingly, primary keratinocytes were less sensitive to V8, perhaps due to higher 
baseline hBD2 production, requiring higher concentration of protease to reproducibly 
induce significant damage, but then undergoing a more catastrophic failure of 
monolayer integrity. These findings are compatible with previously demonstrated 
V8-mediated damage to murine skin integrity in vivo (Hirasawa et al., 2010; 
Ohnemus et al., 2008), confirming the validity of this model and significance of this

protease for keratinocyte barrier integrity. 
 
A wide range of factors can promote keratinocyte defence against the deleterious 
effects of pathogens, including cytokines released by immune cells (e.g. IL-1β, IL-22), 
and bacterial factors such as LPS and LTA (Ganz and Lehrer, 1998; Liu et al., 2002; 
O'Neil et al., 1999). Evaluation of host and bacterial inflammatory agonists 
established that IL-1β, previously shown to modulate TJ protein expression and be 
diminished in AD (Abe et al., 2003; Jakob et al., 1995; Nomura et al., 2003), induced 
protection of keratinocytes against frank V8-mediated integrity damage. This effect 
was not observed following stimulation with LPS or LTA, but was also generated by 
exposure to heat-killed S. epidermidis (HKSE). Notably, although IL-1β upregulated 
claudin-1 expression in HaCaT cells, claudin-1 degradation was not inhibited, and 
protection was independent of claudin-1 levels in primary cells. These data indicated 
an alternative mechanism of protection, revealed to be via secretion of an unidentified, 
transferrable innate host factor. 
  
In contrast to patients with psoriasis, individuals with AD have impaired 
expression of HDPs, in particular hBD2, hBD3, and the cathelicidin LL-37 in 
inflamed lesions (Gambichler et al., 2008; Ong et al., 2002). Whilst several HDPs 
appear to have impaired expression in AD, hBD2 is reported to have the closest 
correlation with AD severity and skin infections (Clausen et al., 2013). In addition to 
direct antibacterial and antiviral properties (Gwyer Findlay et al., 2013; Lehrer et al., 
1989; Mookherjee and Hancock, 2007), hBD2 also has modulatory effects on both the 
innate and adaptive immune system and promotes wound healing (Beaumont et al., 
2014; Choi et al., 2012; Semple and Dorin, 2012; Yeung et al., 2011). Modulatory 
functions of HDP have key roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis (Morizane and Gallo, 
2012) and rosacea (Yamasaki et al., 2007) but are undescribed in AD. Unlike hBD1, 
which is constitutively expressed in skin, hBD2 and hBD3 expression is induced by 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and bacterial products from commensals 
such as S. epidermidis (via a TLR-2 mediated pathway (Lai et al., 2010) as well as 
skin wounding ((Ganz and Lehrer, 1998; Liu et al., 2002; O'Neil et al., 1999)). 
Induction of hBD2 in our keratinocyte models was found to correlate with the

inducible protection phenotype in response to IL-1β and HSKE. Genetic manipulation 
of hBD2 expression was then utilised to demonstrate that hBD2 production is the 
mechanism underpinning IL-1β-mediated protection against V8-induced barrier 
integrity damage. Keratinocyte production of hBD2 was required and sufficient (in 
the absence of IL-1β) for the protection phenotype, which was independent of effects 
upon claudin-1 expression or degradation. 
  
The cellular consequences of hBD2 production that lead to protection against V8 
remain to be determined, and are the subject of ongoing studies. Although hBD2, at 
concentrations of 7µg/ml and above, can promote cell proliferation, tissue 
remodelling, and induce MMPs and TIMPs (Li et al., 2006), overexpression of hBD2 
in our study did not affect cell proliferation (data not shown). β-defensins are not 
characterised as exhibiting direct anti-protease activity, however, this has been 
reported for neutrophil α-defensins (Van Wetering et al., 1997), and other 
antimicrobial proteins including SLPI and Elafin (Moreau et al., 2008; Williams et al., 
2006). Furthermore, hBD2 and hBD3 contain an evolutionarily conserved 
‘gamma-core’ structural motif sufficient for antimicrobial activity and, interestingly, 
also for resistance to proteolytic degradation (Nigro et al., 2015). The significance of 
these structural features with respect to protection against V8 protease remains to be 
determined. Alternatively, hBD2 may induce keratinocyte production of anti-proteases, 
TJ proteins other than claudin-1 or alternative factors. Interestingly, recent studies 
have demonstrated that exposure to high concentrations of exogenously applied hBD3 
and LL-37 can selectively increase keratinocyte expression of claudins and occludin 
to enhance tight junction function (Akiyama et al., 2014; Kiatsurayanon et al., 2014). 
However, in keeping with our study, hBD2 was found not to enhance TJ function and 
the consequence of these HDP-mediated effects on susceptibility to bacterial 
proteases was not determined. hBD3 was not expressed in our models, nor was LL-37 
induced by IL-1β (data not shown) in our keratinocyte models. Despite an inability to 
enhance TJ function, we demonstrate that therapeutic application of exogenous 
recombinant or synthetic hBD2 (but not a scrambled sequence peptide control) could 
protect keratinocytes from V8-mediated barrier integrity damage without induction of

endogenous peptide. This has clear implications for the development of novel 
therapies. 
Due to the early onset and chronic relapsing nature of AD, safe, long-term 
therapeutics are required. However, the current principal treatment, topical 
corticosteroid, can have detrimental effects (e.g. perioral dermatitis and skin atrophy), 
and individuals becoming refractory to topical application require systemic treatment, 
with potentially severe adverse effects (Schakel et al., 2014). Indeed development of 
novel interventions to restore barrier integrity was recently identified by researchers, 
clinicians, patients and policy makers as a top-10 translational dermatology research 
priority in an e-Delphi exercise (Healy et al., 2015). Our data demonstrate that 
interventional approaches aimed at promoting endogenous hBD2 expression and/or 
the therapeutic application of hBD2 (or synthetic analogues) may have the potential to 
enhance/restore skin barrier integrity, protect against S. aureus V8 protease-mediated 
damage and reduce the reliance on corticosteroids.

maintained in CnT57 media (CELLnTEC), replaced with CnT02 media (CELLnTEC) 
at 100% confluency. All cells were cultured at 37˚C, 95% relative humidity, 5% CO2. 
 
To create hBD2 OE and VO control HaCaT lines, TrueORF Gold 
pCMV6-DEFB4 gene expression clone or pCMV6 vector only backbone (OriGene 
Technologies, U.S.A.) were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, 
Renfrew, U.K.), followed by selection with 500µg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). 
Individual hBD2 shRNA knock down lines were made by stable transfection of 
HaCaT cells with pLKO.1 lentiviral shRNA target gene set targeting DEFB4A (GE 
Healthcare, catalogue no. RHS4533) or pLKO.1 vector containing a scrambled

non-targeting shRNA hairpin (Addgene plasmid 1864, (Sarbassov et al., 2005)), 
followed by 5µg/ml puromycin selection. 
 
Keratinocyte monolayer damage assay 
HaCaT or HPEK cells were seeded at 3 x 105 cells / well in 12-well plate at 37˚C, 
until monolayer formation (48-72 hours). Media was removed, cells washed twice 
with PBS, and serum-free media added. As required, monolayers were stimulated with 
100ng/ml IL-1β (Peprotech, New Jersey, U.S.A.), 10µg/ml LTA (Invivogen, 
California, U.S.A.), 5µg/ml LPS (Invivogen), heat killed S. epidermidis, or pre-treated 
with 3µg/ml recombinant hBD2 peptide (ProSpec, New Jersey, U.S.A.), custom 
synthetic hBD2 (GIGDPVTCLKSGAICHPVFCPRRYKQIGTCGLPGTKCCKKP) or 
scrambled 
(IGKILKHVGLSGYCKGDCTRGPCGPFVITCCQCRKPPPAKT) 
peptides (Almac, East Lothian, U.K.) for 24 hours. Subsequently, recombinant S. 
aureus V8 protease (Worthington, New Jersey, U.S.A.) was added as indicated. Cell 
supernatant was collected for ELISA, and protein lysate or RNA was extracted from 
treated cells.  
Damage was assessed from images acquired using an EVOS fl digital inverted 
microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific, U.K.). Representative images (>3 per condition) 
were analysed using ImageJ software, quantifying breaks in the keratinocyte 
monolayer, with damage expressed as a percentage loss of monolayer integrity. For 
phalloidin staining, treated keratinocyte monolayers were fixed in 4% PFA, washed in 
PBS, and incubated with Alexa488 phalloidin (Life Technologies) as per 
manufacturer’s instructions. 
 
 
SDS-PAGE and Western-Blot 
Cell lysates were prepared using M-PER® Mammalian Protein Extraction 
Reagent (Life Technologies), equalised, and boiled at 96˚C for 5 min in 
loading/reducing buffer. 20µg samples were electrophoresed on 4-12% SDS-PAGE 
Novex gels (Life Technologies), transferred to 0.2µM Nitrocellulose membrane (Life 
Technologies) using Towbin buffer, blocked with 5% milk in TBS + 0.1% Tween-20,

(Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, U.K.) and incubated with antibodies as detailed. Western 
Blots were visualised and quantitated using the LI-COR Biosciences Odyssey system.  
 
Real Time PCR  
RNA was extracted from keratinocytes using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, 
Manchester, U.K.), and reverse transcribed to cDNA using the TaqMan RT-PCR kit 
(Life Technologies). StepOne Real Time PCR machine (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 
48-well MicroAmp optical plates were used for amplification reactions. Copy number 
was analysed according to (McNeilly et al., 2008). Standard curves were performed 
using plasmids for DEFB1, DEFB4 (Origene #SC116851, RC219487), and DEFB103 
(generated by J. Dorin). 
 
ELISA 
hBD2 ELISA development kit (Peprotech) was used to determine hBD2 peptide 
levels in culture media, as per manufacturer’s protocol. Peptide levels were 
determined in neat supernatant, in triplicate. 
 
Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis measurements 
LDH release was assayed using the LDH cytotoxicity detection kit (Abcam, 
Cambridge, U.K.). Absorbance was measured at 450nm with a reference wavelength 
of 650nm. Cytotoxicity was calculated using the formula: Cytotoxicity(%) = (Test 
Sample – Low Control (untreated cells))/(High Control (Lysed cells) – Low Control) 
x100. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay using the In Situ Cell Death 
Detection Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Cells were treated with the conditions 
indicated, and compared to treatment with Staurosporine 1µM for 3 hours as a 
positive control. 
 
Statistical analysis. 
Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad PRISM5 statistical package 
(GraphPad software, La Jolla, U.S.A.) by student’s t-test (Figures 1f; 2i (HPEK), 4a, f;
