Summary
Background HIV transmission in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK has shown no sign of decreasing in 
the past decade. Additional prevention measures are needed. We aimed to estimate the eff
 ect of various potential 
interventions implemented individually and in combination on prevention of HIV infection.
Methods We extended a deterministic partnership-based mathematical model for HIV transmission, informed by 
detailed behavioural and surveillance data, to assess the eff
 ect of seven diff
 erent HIV interventions implemented in 
MSM (aged 15–64 years) in the UK during 2014–20, including increasing rates of HIV testing, test-and-treat 
programmes, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and sexual behavioural changes. We did sensitivity analyses on risk 
compensation.
Findings We predicted a baseline of 16 955 new infections (IQR 13 156–21 669) in MSM in the UK during 2014–20. At 
a coverage of ≤50%, testing twice a year outperformed all other interventions. Of all intervention combinations, only 
the combined eff
 ect of test and treat and annual HIV testing (61·8%, IQR 47·2–81·8, of total incidence) was greater 
than the sum of eff
 ects of the two interventions individually (32·6%, 23·7–46·0, and 23·9%, 16·5–33·3, respectively). 
Simultaneous PrEP, expansion of HIV testing, and initiation of test-and-treat programme in 25% of high-activity 
MSM could save 7399 (IQR 5587–9813) UK MSM from HIV infection (43·6%, IQR 32·9–57·9, of total incidence). An 
increase in unsafe sex or sexual partners to 50% or more could substantially reduce the eff
 ect of interventions, but is 
unlikely to negate the prevention benefi
 t completely. 
Interpretation PrEP could prevent a large number of new HIV infections if other key strategies including HIV testing 
and treatment are simultaneously expanded and improved. Without PrEP, HIV incidence in MSM in the UK is 
unlikely to decrease substantially by the end of this decade.

Introduction
In the UK, an estimated 103 700 people were living with 
HIV in 2014, around 43% of whom were men who have 
sex with men (MSM), which was equivalent to 4·9% 
prevalence in MSM aged 15–44 years.1 On the basis of 
estimates from a CD4 back-calculation model,2 about 
2600 MSM in England and Wales have been infected 
with HIV every year in the past 10 years, with a slight 
increase to 2800 in 2014, and without alternative 
prevention measures incidence is expected to remain at 
this level throughout the decade.3
Attempts to prevent HIV transmission in the UK have 
focused on promotion of proper and consistent condom 
use and increasing coverage and frequency of HIV 
testing.1 But because these interventions alone have 
been insuffi
  cient to reduce HIV incidence in UK MSM 
over time, more attention has been paid to alternative 
strategies of HIV infection control, including use of 
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Two PrEP trials—the 
PROUD study in England4 and the IPERGAY study in 
France and Canada5—had to discontinue the placebo 
group and provide PrEP to all eligible participants after 
their interim results showed the high protective eff
 ect 
of PrEP.
Because the combination of conventional and 
alternative prevention measures is now being considered, 
an increased understanding is needed of their potential 
eff
 ect on HIV transmission in MSM in the UK. We did 
this mathematical modelling study to assess the potential 
eff
 ect of various HIV prevention interventions, both 
individually and in combination, on HIV transmission 
during 2014–20. We also investigated the sensitivity 
of our results to variation in intervention coverage, 
PrEP eff
 ectiveness, and the eff
 ects of potential risk 
compensation.
Methods
Modelling and data sources
For our mathematical modelling analysis, we extended a 
previous deterministic partnership-based model for HIV 
transmission in MSM aged 15–64 years in the UK.3 We 
used the R software package (version 2.15.3)6 for model 
building and analysis. The model time step was 1 day. 
The model consisted of 15 compartments (appendix, p 28).

The fi
 ve disease stages (primary HIV infection; and 
CD4 counts of 500 cells per μL or higher, 350–499 and 
200–349 cells per μL, and less than 200 cells per μL) had 
diff
 erent HIV transmission probabilities derived from 
the average viral load in each stage. Once individuals 
progressed to the treatment stage, they remained there 
until being removed from the model because of mortality 
or age older than 64 years.
MSM were divided into current and past MSM. Current 
MSM reported having sex with men in the past 5 years and 
were assumed to continue to have new male sexual 
partners. Past MSM reported having no sex with men in 
the past 5 years and were assumed in our model no longer 
to have sex with men. We used this categorisation to 
exclude individuals who might have no contribution 
towards further HIV transmission in MSM. Men were 
further divided into those with low sexual activity, defi
 ned 
as MSM with, on average, one or fewer new male sexual 
partners per year, and those with high sexual activity, 
defi
 ned as MSM with more than one new sexual partner a 
year. We assumed that MSM did not change activity level 
except after diagnosis with HIV. If diagnosed, 66% of high-
activity MSM were assumed to become low activity and 7% 
of low-activity MSM were assumed to become high activity, 
as derived from a cohort study in UK MSM.7 Model MSM 
were categorised into two age groups: 15–34 years (group 1) 
and 35–64 years (group 2). We assumed that the sizes of 
the two age groups changed over time in line with the 
general UK male population. The initial model population 
size in 2000 was 648 500 MSM, 259 500 of whom were 
aged 15–34 years and 389 000 aged 35–64 years.3
The model simulated two types of sexual partnerships: 
one-off
  partnerships and repeat partnerships. One-off
 
 
sexual partnership consists of a single sex act, whereas the 
repeat partnership lasts for a fi
 nite period of time and 
consists of more than one sex act with the same partner. 
We assumed non-random mixing between partners, with 
a method based on odds ratios,8 and, in line with data, that 
MSM were more likely to select new sexual partners of the 
same age group, sexual activity level, and perceived HIV 
serostatus.3 HIV can only be transmitted through fi
 ve 
types of sex between men: protected and unprotected 
receptive anal intercourse, protected and unprotected 
insertive anal intercourse, and unprotected receptive oral 
intercourse. We describe further details of the model and 
the force of infection derivation elsewhere.3
The main sources for estimation of demographic and 
behavioural parameters were the 2000 National Survey of 
Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL),9 the 2000–06 
Gay Men’s Sexual Health Survey (GMSHS) in London,10 
and the 2000–08 London Gym Survey (GYM).11 We 
adjusted data from the community-based convenience-
sample GMSHS and GYM surveys to match key important 
variables from the national-based probability-sample 
NATSAL survey.3 The national HIV
/AIDS surveillance 
databases including HIV
/AIDS diagnoses and CD4 
surveillance provided data used extensively throughout 
parameterisation. We estimated unknown parameters 
through model fi
 tting with the Monte Carlo fi
 ltering 
method.12 We sampled 20 000 diff
 erent combinations of 
the fi
 tted parameters with  Latin Hypercube sampling and 
ran 20 000 model simulations to match the 2001–09 
estimates of the overall and undiagnosed HIV prevalence 
simultaneously. 1093 para 
meter sets fi
 tted to the data and 
were used to simulate the HIV epidemic in MSM in the 
UK from 2001 to 2020. We then did model validation by 
comparing the model estimates to the national estimates 
of annual new HIV infections, the number of new HIV 
diagnoses, and the number of ART-treated MSM during 
2001–09.3
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for studies published in English up to 
Nov 30, 2015, with the search terms “HIV”, “intervention” or 
“prevention”, “men who have sex with men” or “MSM” or 
“homosexual” or “gay”, and “model”. We identifi
 ed fi
 ve studies 
that used a mathematical model to estimate the potential eff
 ect 
of combinations of HIV interventions in men who have sex with 
men (MSM) in China, South Africa, South Korea, the UK, and the 
USA. Four studies assessed the eff
 ect of increasing HIV testing and 
early treatment but only three studies included pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP showed a promising eff
 ect against HIV 
infection in MSM in many settings and seemed to be more 
eff
 ective than other included interventions. No studies assessed 
the eff
 ect of PrEP in MSM in the UK.
Added value of this study
We used a mathematical model to estimate the effect of 
seven different HIV interventions implemented individually 
and simultaneously in MSM in the UK during 2014–20. Most 
of the included interventions have not previously been 
assessed. The model incorporated many important 
heterogeneities and was calibrated and validated against 
multiple surveillance datasets and national estimates. Our 
findings show that PrEP can be highly effective against HIV 
transmission at the population level and could outperform 
other interventions at the same level of programme 
coverage.
Implications of all the available evidence
A feasible combination of PrEP, test-and-treat strategies, and 
HIV testing programmes implemented in small groups of MSM 
could prevent a substantial number of new infections, even 
with a high level of risk compensation. Future work may 
investigate the eff
 ect of changes in other behavioural factors 
on the result of interventions.

HIV interventions
Model simulations were done for the period 2001–20 and 
intervention programmes were introduced in 2014. We 
assessed the eff
 ect of interventions with the number of 
HIV infections prevented during the intervention period 
compared with the existing scenario in which no 
additional interventions have been implemented. We 
additionally assessed the changes over time in the 
number of new infections and the number of individuals 
living with HIV. The model outputs are presented as 
median estimates with IQRs.
Findings from our previous study3 suggested that 
undiagnosed HIV, repeat sexual partnerships, and young 
and high-activity MSM were the most important drivers 
of the HIV epidemic in UK MSM. Several interventions 
have been proposed in modelling studies13 and have 
garnered interest.14,15 We consequently formed and 
investigated seven individual HIV interventions: (1.1) test 
for HIV once a year; (1.2) test for HIV twice a year; (1.3) a 
test-and-treat programme assuming the ART initiation 
rate of those with CD4 count of less than 350 cells per μL 
to all diagnosed MSM regardless of CD4 count; (1.4) 
PrEP; (1.5) reducing the number of repeat sexual partners 
by 0·5 times; (1.6) reducing the number of one-off
  sexual 
partners by 0·5 times; and (1.7) reducing unprotected 
anal intercourse with repeat sexual partners by 0·5 times. 
The appendix summarises key parameters and details for 
modelling of the individual interventions.3,16 Each 
intervention was implemented in three target groups: all 
MSM, MSM aged 15–34 years, and high-activity MSM. 
The intervention coverage, which we defi
 ned as the 
proportion of MSM who adopted each intervention, was 
assumed to be 100% for clarity of exposition in all 
scenarios of individual and combined interventions, and 
should be considered as the maximum eff
 ect of the 
intervention because this coverage is highly unlikely. We 
also assessed the eff
 ects of reducing the coverage of the 
individual interventions to 75%, 50%, and 25%. We also 
analysed changes to PrEP coverage in conjunction with 
changes to PrEP eff
 ectiveness from 44% to 20%, 60%, 
80%, and 100% to show the joint eff
 ects these two 
parameters have on incidence reduction.
We modelled the seven combinations of the 
individual interventions: (2.1) test once a year and 
decrease unprotected anal intercourse with repeat 
sexual partners, (2.2) reduce the number of repeat 
sexual partners and decrease unprotected anal 
intercourse with repeat sexual partners, (2.3) test once 
a year and test and treat, (2.4) PrEP and test and treat, 
(2.5) PrEP and decrease unprotected anal intercourse 
with repeat sexual partners, (2.6) PrEP and reduce the 
number of repeat sexual partners, and (2.7) all 
individual interventions except test once a year. The 
combined interventions are applied only to all MSM. 
All parameter values in individual intervention 
scenarios remained unchanged in the combined 
intervention scenarios.
We then assessed the eff
 ect of various combinations of 
selected interventions at more realistic levels of coverage. 
We used the results from the previous intervention 
analyses to inform several practical scenarios of 
implementation of various interventions simultaneously 
on the basis of more conservative coverage assumptions. 
We mainly focused on the interventions that performed 
well individually or in combination with specifi
 c 
interventions. We assumed that all interventions 
achieved 25% coverage of the target populations. We 
used the extreme risk-compensation assumption to 
represent a near worst-case scenario.
Sensitivity analysis
We explored the eff
 ects of risk compensation—having 
more sexual partners, increasing unsafe sex, and with 
less HIV testing—resulting from implementation of the 
individual interventions. In the target groups of 
interventions,  we  specifi
 cally  increased  the  repeat 
 
sexual  partner  change  rates  and  the  proportion  of 
MSM who have unprotected anal intercourse with repeat 
sexual partners as well as decreasing the HIV diagnosis 
rates, all by 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The sensitivity

Results
The model estimates of the number of new HIV 
infections in UK MSM in the past decade showed good 
consistency with the national estimates (fi
 gure 1). The 
status-quo scenario estimated a total of 16 955 HIV 
infections in MSM in the UK, with around 2400 new 
infections annually during 2014–20 (table 1), which is 
equivalent to about 6·6 new HIV infections every day. 
Without additional interventions, 52 268 MSM are 
expected to be living with HIV in the UK by 2020, with 
an annual incidence of 0·34% (table 1).
With 100% programme coverage, PrEP prevented the 
greatest number of HIV infections (table 1). Even when 
targeted only at high-activity men, PrEP was more eff
 ective 
than all other individual interventions that targeted the 
entire UK MSM population (table 1, appendix p 32). A 
large number of MSM could also be protected from HIV 
infection by decreasing the number of repeat sexual 
partners by 0·5 times (table 1). Decreasing the proportion 
of men who had unprotected anal intercourse with repeat

sexual partners by 0·5 times reduced incidence by almost 
a third during the intervention period (table 1).
An estimated 5522 new infections (32·6% of total 
incidence) would be prevented by testing annually at 100% 
coverage (table 1). Twice-yearly testing in all UK MSM 
increased the number of prevented infections to 7089, 
which is equivalent to a 41·8% reduction in incidence 
(table 1). Early provision of ART (test and treat) reduced 
total incidence by 23·9%; one test-and-treat participant 
could prevent 0·322 new infections during 2014–20, which 
is around 17 times higher than PrEP (unit eff
 ect 0·019; 
table 1).
Alteration of the coverage of interventions had a large 
eff
 ect on prevention of new infections (fi
 gure 2). 
Reducing repeat sexual partnerships was the most 
aff
 ected intervention, with a decrease of about 75% in 
eff
 ect as coverage reduced from 100% to 25%, whereas 
the same reduction in coverage resulted in a 55%

Data are median (IQR), unless otherwise indicated. Estimates were derived from 1093 simulations. The status-quo scenario shows the estimates without any additional interventions. The combined 
interventions were only applied to all MSM. Coverage was assumed to be 100% for both individual and combined interventions. PrEP was provided only to HIV-negative current MSM. MSM=men who have sex 
with men. PrEP=pre-exposure prophylaxis. *The total number of participants covered by each intervention during the intervention period. For the combined interventions, this number is simply the sum of the 
coverage of the individual interventions. The number of test-and-treat participants represents only those who were treated with ART early in their disease course because of the programme. †Numbers were 
derived from the diff
 erence between the median estimates of infections in the status-quo scenario and the numbers of infections in the scenarios with interventions. ‡Percentages were calculated by dividing 
the median estimates of infections in the status-quo scenario by the number of infections prevented by the interventions. §Number of infections prevented per programme participant.

decrease in eff
 ect for testing once a year, and of 37% for 
testing twice a year (fi
 gure 2). The robustness to variation 
in programme coverage suggests that expansion of HIV 
testing and treatment might still be eff
 ective even when 
adopted by a smaller proportion of MSM. At 25% 
coverage of all interventions, testing twice a year 
produced the greatest eff
 ect; the eff
 ect of test-and-treat 
programmes 
was 
greater 
than 
for 
most 
other 
interventions and was on par with PrEP (fi
 gure 2). The 
other individual interventions tended to show a roughly 
linear association between coverage and eff
 ect (fi
 gure 2).
With an assumed eff
 ectiveness of 44%, if coverage was 
50% rather than 100%, PrEP would fail to prevent 
4144 new infections (fi
 gure 2). Increasing the eff
 ectiveness 
raised the number of infections prevented, irrespective of 
the coverage (fi
 gure 2). The PrEP intervention with 100% 
coverage and 20% eff
 ectiveness was able to prevent 
1275 more cases than 25% coverage with 100% 
eff
 ectiveness (6893 cases vs 5618 cases). However, at low to 
moderate eff
 ectiveness (≤60%) but high coverage (≥75%), 
increasing PrEP coverage seemed to have a slightly greater 
eff
 ect than did increasing eff
 ectiveness (fi
 gure 2). On 
average, a 1% increase in PrEP coverage led to an increase 
of 1·90% in eff
 ect, whereas a 1% increase in PrEP 
eff
 ectiveness led to an increase of 1·25% (fi
 gure 2).
We recorded diminishing returns for most combined 
interventions. For example, programmes to increase 
frequency of HIV testing and decrease unprotected anal 
intercourse with repeat sexual partners were estimated to 
each prevent about a third of new infections when 
implemented separately at 100% coverage, whereas 
combining both programmes achieved only 49·2% 
incidence reduction (table 1). Only the combination of 
annual HIV testing with the test-and-treat programme was 
able to provide an incidence reduction greater than the 
sum of the eff
 ects of the two individually (appendix, p 36).
We investigated 12 practical scenarios (table 2). The fi
 rst 
scenario (3.1) assumed that PrEP was provided to 25% of 
the high-activity HIV-negative MSM in the UK and, for 
high-activity men who did not use PrEP, 25% had an 
annual HIV test. This strategy prevented 26·4% of HIV 
infections, an eff
 ect that increased to 37·2% when PrEP 
coverage was increased to 50% (scenario 3.2). Addition of 
test and treat to scenario 3.1 prevented 7399 cases (43·6% 
of total incidence), the highest number among all the 
practical scenarios assessed (scenario 3.3). Scenario 3.3 
also provided the largest unit eff
 ect (0·053). Replacement 
of test-and-treat strategies with programmes to encourage 
fewer sexual partners (scenario 3.4) and less unprotected 
anal intercourse (scenario 3.5) had a lower eff
 ect than the 
test-and-treat scenarios (appendix, p 40).
In the analysis of risk compensation in PrEP users, 
scenario 3.6 assumed that all PrEP men in scenario 3.1 
completely stopped using condoms with repeat sexual 
partners. This assumption resulted in HIV incidence 
eff
 ect falling to 11·5% (table 2). Surprisingly, scenario 3.7,

Estimates for varying intervention coverage (A) and PrEP coverage and eff
 ectiveness (B). Dashed line shows the median estimate of the total number of HIV 
infections in the status-quo scenario. For HIV testing programmes, coverage excluded men who had already been tested at least once a year in the status-quo 
scenario. For test and treat, the coverage is the proportion of men diagnosed with HIV at CD4 counts of 350 cells per μL or higher and excluded men who had 
already been treated in the status quo. PrEP=pre-exposure prophylaxis.

which assumed that all PrEP men in scenario 3.1 
acquired twice as many repeat sexual partners, increased 
incidence eff
 ect to 28·0% compared with scenario 3.1 
(26·4%; table 2). This result was because more sexual 
partnerships in PrEP men would require a larger number 
of non-PrEP partners, including infected men, which

would reduce the probability that non-PrEP susceptibles 
had sero 
discordant relationships, particularly with 
undiagnosed MSM. Combining the two risk com-
pensations from scenarios 3.6 and 3.7 resulted in the 
incidence eff
 ect of 22·3% (scenario 3.8; table 2).
In scenario 3.9, we assumed that 25% of the entire 
MSM population reduced repeat sexual partnerships by 
half, and 25% of high-activity MSM had an annual HIV 
test. The eff
 ect was 22·2% in this scenario (table 2). 
When the test-and-treat programme with 25% coverage 
was added to scenario 3.9, the eff
 ect increased to 40·6% 
(scenario 3.10; table 2). However, the benefi
 t of early ART 
was completely negated if high-activity men tested for 
HIV half as frequently (scenario 3.11; table 2). If even 
more risk-compensation behaviour took place, with the 
assumption that all ART-treated MSM completely 
stopped using condoms with repeat sexual partners on 
the basis of the benefi
 t of immediate ART, the eff
 ect 
would fall to 15·8% (scenario 3.12; table 2).
The number of new infections prevented was sensitive 
to sexual risk compensation, particularly an increase in 
the number of repeat sexual partners. Most interventions 
could tolerate up to 75% or more increase in both risk 
compensations before the benefi
 ts were completely 
negated. However, the sensitivity of the model outcomes 
to decreasing frequency of HIV testing was relatively less 
pronounced compared with the sexual risk compensation 
(appendix, p 19).
Discussion
Our analysis confi
 rmed the importance of imple-
mentation of a combination of interventions for eff
 ective 
HIV control in MSM.13,17 The provision of PrEP as part of 
a combination strategy, even to a quarter of highly 
sexually active individuals, could prevent more than 
7000 new HIV infections in the UK before the end of 
this decade. The relatively small coverage the 
programme requires is feasible because around half of

Data are median (IQR), unless otherwise indicated. Estimates were derived from 1093 simulations. PrEP=pre-exposure prophylaxis. MSM=men who have sex with men. ART=antiretroviral therapy. *The total 
number of participants covered by each intervention during the intervention period. For the combined interventions, this number is simply the sum of the coverage of the individual interventions. The number 
of test-and-treat participants represents only those who were treated with ART early in their disease course because of the programme. †Numbers were derived from the diff

MSM in the UK have shown interest in participating 
in PrEP18 and treatment-as-prevention programmes.19 
Combined program 
matic launch would be aided by the 
fact that the most at-risk men are more likely to use 
PrEP than are other high-risk MSM.20
One of the main concerns about PrEP is that risk 
compensation could reduce the eff
 ectiveness of the 
intervention.21 Our risk-compensation analyses suggested 
that a substantial increase in unprotected anal intercourse 
would be needed to negate the population-level benefi
 ts of 
PrEP. However, in reality, the negative eff
 ect of risk 
compensation could be multiplied, for example, in PrEP 
users with poor drug adherence in whom there is an 
increase in unsafe sex and number of partners simul-
taneously. Thus, approximation of increased risk-taking in 
real-world situations, with the behavioural insights 
gathered from clinical trials, is highly important but might 
require more appropriate study designs other than a 
conventional longitudinal analysis.22 With suffi
  cient 
knowledge and understanding, the complementary risk-
reduction programmes could be tailor-made to help adjust 
perceptions of risks and benefi
 ts underlying the 
mechanism of risk compensation in PrEP users.
Another issue regarding PrEP is its protective 
eff
 ectiveness against HIV. In the present study we 
assumed a baseline eff
 ectiveness of 44% for the daily 
tenofovir and emtricitabine, which was suggested by a 
clinical trial in MSM in six non-European countries.16 
The HIV protective eff
 ects of PrEP relied greatly on drug 
adherence of programme participants,14,16 which could 
diff
 er greatly between the trial and actual implementation 
in the UK. Findings from the PROUD open-label trial 
suggested a relative incidence reduction of 86% in 
participants who received PrEP immediately compared 
with those who received PrEP after a 12 month deferral 
period.4 Moreover, the PrEP programme is not a 
stand-alone intervention, but rather a combination of 
several components including medicine use, HIV 
testing, motivational interviewing, and risk reduction. 
The eff
 ectiveness of PrEP will thus rely greatly on the 
quality of these complementary programmes and might 
exceed our estimates if all are successfully adopted.
By comparison with PrEP, our fi
 ndings showed that 
the test-and-treat programme has a smaller eff
 ect on 
HIV prevention at the population level, which is 
consistent with modelling studies in other settings.23,24 
This fi
 nding might be explained by the already small 
contribution of MSM with diagnosed HIV to total 
infections,3 because after diagnosis there are reductions 
in high-risk behaviours, and many of these men in whom 
infection is diagnosed begin ART promptly, especially as 
the CD4 count threshold for treatment eligibility has 
changed in the UK.25 Moreover, now that the individual 
benefi
 t of immediate ART has been established for 
people with HIV infection, the high proportion of MSM 
with HIV infection beginning immediate or very early 
ART is likely to increase still further.
The key strengths of test and treat lie in various aspects. 
First, the robustness of the programme in relation to 
risk-compensation behaviour. This robustness could be 
explained by the benefi
 ts of ART in reducing the 
probability of HIV transmission between serodiscordant 
couples,26 which exceed the adverse eff
 ects of plausible 
risk compensation. Second, the capability of the 
programme to be eff
 ective at low coverage makes it 
suitable for use in various practical situations in which 
full coverage is almost impossible to reach. Third, 
because early ART is only off
 ered to diagnosed MSM, the 
number of participants needed to reach the targeted 
incidence reduction is much smaller than that needed by 
other programmes focusing on a pool of susceptibles 
and undiagnosed men. Finally, test and treat was the only 
intervention investigated here that, when implemented 
along with increased HIV testing frequency and 
coverage, provided additional benefi
 ts over the sum of 
the two independent eff
 ects. This result is because of the 
completely non-overlapping target groups (undiagnosed 
vs diagnosed MSM) between the two interventions and 
the increased number of diagnosed individuals to be 
treated early with ART.
In a modelling study in UK MSM, Phillips and 
colleagues27 reported that immediate ART would prevent 
32% of new infections during 2006–10 compared with 
our 100% coverage estimates of 24% during 2014–20. The 
slight diff
 erence in the estimates is probably due to 
diff
 erent timescales and the underlying assumptions of 
the interventions. We assumed that men diagnosed at a 
CD4 cell count of 350 cells per μL or more, except in 
those with primary HIV infection, had the same ART 
initiation rate as those diagnosed at counts of less than 
350 cells per μL, whereas in Phillips and colleagues’ 
study,27 ART was initiated immediately in all MSM 
diagnosed with HIV after 2000. That study also reported 
a 25% decline in incidence if HIV test rate has been 
increasing since 2000 until 2010, when 68% of all MSM 
were tested each year,27 whereas in our study testing once 
a year with 50–75% coverage would lower the incidence 
by 25–30%. Both our and Phillips and colleagues’27 
studies suggested the same 62% incidence reduction at 
the maximum coverage if more frequent testing and 
early ART were implemented simultaneously.
The three ambitious 90-90-90 targets proposed by 
UNAIDS are intended to reduce HIV incidence by 90% 
by 2030, compared with that in 2010.28 The fi
 rst target 
called for 90% of people living with HIV in 2020 to be 
aware of their infection.28 An estimated 84% of MSM 
living with HIV in the UK in 2013 were aware of their 
infection, so the 90% target should be achievable in the 
near future. The other two targets that expected 90% of 
diagnosed individuals to be treated with ART, and 90% of 
those receiving ART to achieve an undetectable viral 
load,28 have already been reached in the UK.1 Despite 
these achievements, the reduction in incidence by 2030 
is unlikely without additional interventions. Our baseline

e103
scenario suggested a constant level of 2000–3000 new 
infections in UK MSM every year up to 2020, with no 
sign of a decrease. Through using linear regression on 
our 2014–20 estimates to extrapolate the future incidence, 
we concluded that at least 50% of MSM would need to be 
consistently tested annually or to use PrEP to attain a 
90% incidence reduction by 2030. Both testing and PrEP 
strategies each raised the proportion of MSM living with 
HIV and aware of their infection to around 95% while 
maintaining the proportion of MSM living with HIV 
who were on treatment at around 90%. Thus, 
achievement of the three 90-90-90 targets might not lead 
to the 2030 goal29 and, in the UK MSM setting, 
achievement of and sustaining a 95-90-90 target by 2020 
would be required.
Our study has several limitations. First, our analyses 
are, by necessity, a simplifi
 cation of the real world, and 
might overestimate actual programme eff
 ectiveness. 
For illustrative purpose we show results at 100% 
coverage, but this is clearly unrealistic. However, the 
overall conclusions remained similar when the coverage 
was reduced and we also applied a much smaller level 
of coverage in the practical scenarios to refl
 ect more 
conservative outcomes. Second, we did not explicitly 
include the eff
 ects of ART resistance30 and co-infection 
with other sexually transmitted diseases31 on HIV 
transmission. Unless the prevalence of co-infection and 
drug-resistant strains changes substantially during the 
intervention period, their eff
 ects on the eff
 ect of 
interventions are not likely to be infl
 uential. Third, we 
did not account for the UK regional diff
 erence. 
Although this limitation might not have a substantial 
eff
 ect on the eff
 ect of interventions at the national level, 
the regional diff
 erence might play an important part in 
some specifi
 c areas. Fourth, changes of risk within 
individuals was also not accounted for. High-risk 
behaviour may be relatively transient and take place 
occasionally over time. However, this should have no 
substantial eff
 ect on our fi
 ndings because we saw no 
evidence of a major fl
 uctuation in the overall 
proportions of high-risk MSM in the UK over the past 
decade. Fifth, even with our practical scenarios the 
scale of the modelled interventions could be practically 
too large, and a more targeted programme aimed at 
groups with highest risks could be more feasible. 
Finally, our analysis did not include cost-eff
 ectiveness, 
which is also crucial to inform public health decision 
making. That any highly eff
 ective programmes against 
HIV transmission suggested in this study might not be 
cost eff
 ective in the real UK setting is a possibility. 
Although a simple cost approximation of imple-
mentation of the interventions can be done with the 
estimated 
numbers 
of 
programme 
participants 
provided in the tables, further in-depth economic 
analyses are needed to inform timely and accurate 
decision 
making. 
Future 
work 
should 
include 
investigation of the eff
 ect of changes in other 
behavioural factors (eg, partnership duration and 
mixing preferences) on the eff
 ect of interventions.
In conclusion, our analysis suggests that a combination 
of PrEP, expansion of HIV testing, and test-and-treat 
programmes implemented in small groups of MSM in 
the UK could prevent thousands from HIV within a few 
years of implementation, particularly if risk-com-
pensation behaviour is successfully avoided. Integration 
of this enhanced version of conventional interventions 
with novel biomedical technologies is likely to deliver the 
optimum approach to HIV prevention that could 
determine the future course of the HIV epidemic in 
the UK.
