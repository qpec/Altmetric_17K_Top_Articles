ABSTRACT
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death
worldwide. While COPD is a mainly chronic disease, a substantial number of patients suffer from
exacerbations. Severe exacerbations are related to a significantly worse survival outcome. This review
summarises the current knowledge on the different aspects of COPD exacerbations. The impact of risk
factors and triggers such as smoking, severe airflow limitation, bronchiectasis, bacterial and viral infections
and comorbidities is discussed. More severe exacerbations should be treated with β-agonists and
anticholinergics as well as systemic corticosteroids. Antibiotic therapy should only be given to patients
with presumed bacterial infection. Noninvasive ventilation is indicated in patients with respiratory failure.
Smoking cessation is key to prevent further COPD exacerbations. Other aspects include choice of
pharmacotherapy, including bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, long-
term antibiotics and mucolytics. Better education and self-management as well as increased physical
activity are important. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination is recommended. Treatment of
hypoxaemia and hypercapnia reduce the rate of COPD exacerbations, while most interventional
bronchoscopic therapies increase exacerbation risk within the first months after the procedure.
Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide [1]. While
COPD is a mainly chronic disease, a substantial number of patients suffer from exacerbations, which are
defined as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring a change in treatment. Exacerbations are
an important medical and healthcare problem, e.g. it is evident that severe exacerbations of COPD are
related to a significantly worse survival outcome [2].
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 report refined the ABCD
assessment tool, to utilise respiratory symptoms and exacerbations alone to assign ABCD categories [3]. It

 is recommended that symptoms and future risk of exacerbation be assessed as a basis for pharmacological
management of stable COPD.
This article summarises the current knowledge on risk factors and triggers, treatment and prevention of
exacerbations of COPD (figure 1).
Risk factors and triggers
There are several risk factors and triggers of exacerbations of COPD. Since many patients with COPD have
significant comorbidities, the final paragraph in this section focuses on important differential diagnoses
that should be taken into account.
Smoking and air pollution
Tobacco smoke is the major risk factor for developing COPD [4, 5]. Therefore, smokers should be
provided with counselling for smoking cessation. COPD is more common in males than in females [6],
but there is an increase in tobacco smoking among females. This is of special importance, because studies
have shown that the susceptibility to smoking and frequent exacerbations in COPD is stronger in females
than in males [7, 8].
The effect of air pollution on COPD exacerbations is still under debate. Some studies have demonstrated
that air pollution significantly increases the risk of exacerbations [9, 10], while older studies found no
relevant correlations. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that short-term exposure to
major air pollutants could significantly increase the risk for exacerbations of COPD [11]. In summary,
there is a trend towards an association of air pollution with exacerbations.
Severe airflow limitation
In a prospective study, patients were followed-up for 4 years after the first hospitalisation due to
exacerbation of COPD [12]. The highest mortality was seen in the group with severe airflow limitation. In
addition, patients in that group had more frequent hospitalisations due to COPD. Data on 2164 patients
from the ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints) cohort
revealed five subgroups using cross-sectional clinical features [13]. The subgroup with most exacerbations
of COPD had the second highest mortality within 3 years. Mortality was only slightly higher in the
subgroup with many comorbidities and evidence of systemic inflammation.

 Bronchiectasis
A meta-analysis of six observational studies demonstrated a correlation between the detection of
bronchiectasis in (high-resolution) computed tomography in patients with COPD and the frequency of
exacerbations (weighted mean difference 1.54 times in the previous year) [14]. Since these patients with
bronchiectasis had more chronic colonisation by pathogenic microorganisms (odds ratio 7.33) and a
higher rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation (odds ratio 3.5), this coexistence is considered a potential
mechanism for frequent exacerbations.
Microorganisms
COPD patients may have evidence of chronic lower respiratory tract colonisation with bacteria, but the
detection of bacteria in the sputum of patients with COPD does not mean that in general these patients
have a higher risk of exacerbations. Older studies did not find differences between the rates of isolation of
bacteria from sputum during stable disease and exacerbation [15]. More recent studies found an association
between exacerbation and the isolation of a new strain of a bacterial pathogen [16]. In addition, the
reported efficacy of long-term antibiotic treatment with macrolides in reducing exacerbation frequency may
suggest that bacteria are relevant for the induction of exacerbations, although this is a matter of debate [17].
Viral infections are an even more important risk factor for exacerbations of COPD. A case–control study
found viral respiratory pathogens more often in respiratory specimens of hospitalised patients with
exacerbated COPD than in control patients (56% versus 19%) [18]. The most common viruses detected
were picornaviruses (36%), followed by influenza A (25%), respiratory syncytial virus (22%) and
parainfluenza (10%). A review of 24 studies of viral infections in COPD exacerbations (from 2001 to 2015)
showed virus detection rates in respiratory specimens of 22–64% [19]. The investigation of the impact of
seasonality on COPD exacerbation frequency in the TORCH (Towards a Revolution in COPD Health)
study showed an almost two-fold increase in the winter months in both the northern and southern
regions, while no seasonal pattern occurred in the tropics [20]. The authors suspected increased exposure
to viral infections to be a potentially contributing factor.
Biomarkers
Many potential biomarkers have been tested with the goal of predicting the development of exacerbations.
The COPD Foundation Biomarker Qualification Consortium showed that patients with elevated levels of
fibrinogen had a nearly two-fold increased risk of death from any cause over 3 years [21]. This led to the
United States Food and Drug Administration qualification of plasma fibrinogen as a prognostic biomarker
for all-cause mortality and COPD exacerbations. A study published more recently tested ∼90 biomarkers
from the two patient cohorts SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcomes Measures in
COPD Study) and COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of COPD) [22]. Although within each cohort a
subset of biomarkers was associated with exacerbations, replication across the two cohorts was poor.
Fibrinogen was not a predictive biomarker of exacerbation in SPIROMICS nor COPDGene. The only two
blood biomarkers predictive of future severe exacerbations were decorin and α2-macroglobulin. The
authors concluded that these blood biomarkers had only little additive value.
Another widely examined study parameter is the eosinophil count. A high eosinophil count in blood is
associated with an increased risk of COPD exacerbations [23]. Accordingly, other studies found
associations between treatment with corticosteroids or their withdrawal and the eosinophil count. In
patients with high eosinophil counts there were more exacerbations per year: the higher the eosinophil
count, the more exacerbations [24]. This increased exacerbation rate could be decreased by an inhaled
corticosteroid. A similar result was seen in a post hoc analysis of the WISDOM (Withdrawal of Inhaled
Steroids during Optimised Bronchodilator Management) study [25]. Patients with blood eosinophils
counts >300 cells·µL-1 had a higher exacerbation rate after complete withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids.
The results of prospective studies with patient stratifcation based on blood eosinophil count must be
awaited before eosinophil counts can be recommended for wider use.
Prior exacerbations
Prior exacerbations of COPD have an impact on the long-term course of the disease. In a study by SUISSA
et al. [26], the risk of subsequent severe exacerbation was increased three-fold after the second severe
exacerbation and 24-fold after the 10th, relative to the first. Additionally, the median time from one to the
next hospitalised exacerbation decreased with the number of previous exacerbations. In the POET-COPD
(Prevention of Exacerbations with Tiotropium in COPD) trial, frequent exacerbators had a three-fold
increase in mortality [27]. The most important prognostic factor was exacerbation-related hospitalisation.
In particular, readmission within 30 days after COPD exacerbation was correlated with an increased risk of
mortality [28]. The most important predictor of frequent exacerbations is a history of exacerbations [29].

 Comorbidities
Most patients with COPD have comorbidities. The five most prevalent comorbidities are hyperglycaemia,
atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and osteoporosis [30]. The importance of the different
comorbidities for hospitalisation and mortality has been presented in “comorbidomes” [31, 32].
Psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression may have a negative impact on exacerbation
frequency.
In addition, some comorbidities may mimic an exacerbation of COPD (e.g. decompensated heart failure or
ischaemic heart disease).
Treatment of COPD exacerbations
The goal of treatment is to minimise the negative impact of the current exacerbation. This can be achieved
by a number of medical interventions.
β-agonists and anticholinergics
Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, there is a consensus that short-acting inhaled β2-agonists and
short-acting anticholinergics are the initial treatment of COPD exacerbations [3, 33]. Before hospital
discharge, maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated. Based on currently
available data, long-acting antimuscarinic antagonists (LAMA) seem to have a greater effect on exacerbation
rates than long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) [34, 35]. Therefore, in the pharmacological treatment algorithm,
the GOLD 2017 report [3] recommends starting therapy with a LAMA, in group C patients especially.
Patients with further exacerbation(s) should be treated with a LAMA/LABA combination.
Corticosteroids
Systemic corticosteroids have been used as standard treatment for exacerbations for a long time [36]. They
have been shown to improve lung function and oxygenation, to shorten recovery time and duration of
hospitalisation and to reduce treatment failures. The REDUCE (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in
Exacerbated COPD) randomised clinical trial revealed that 5-day treatment with systemic corticosteroids
compared to 14-day treatment had similar rates of re-exacerbation within 6 months of follow-up [37].
Therefore, systemic corticosteroids should not be administered for >5–7 days. The recently published
European Respiratory Society (ERS)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for the management of
COPD exacerbations suggest a short course (⩽14 days) of oral corticosteroids for ambulatory patients with
an exacerbation of COPD [38]. Even for patients who are hospitalised due to a COPD exacerbation, the
guidelines suggest the administration of oral rather than i.v. corticosteroids.
Moreover, a pharmacoepidemiological cohort study came to the conclusion that lower dosage strategies
should be encouraged for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [39]. The group with
lower-dose methylprednisolone had a similar rate of mortality, but was associated with reduced hospital
and ICU length of stay as well as reduced hospital cost, length of invasive ventilation, need of insulin
therapy and fungal infections.
Antibiotics
A systematic review of COPD guidelines revealed that criteria for treatment with antibiotics were mainly an
increase in respiratory symptoms [40]. The ERS/ATS guidelines for the management of COPD exacerbations
suggest the administration of antibiotics for ambulatory patients having a COPD exacerbation [38]. It seems
obvious that antibiotics should only be given in patients with presumed bacterial infection. The expectoration
of purulent sputum is the clinical parameter that suggests that a relevant bacterial infection is present. To
differentiate between chronic colonisation and acute infection, procalcitonin levels can be assessed as a
marker for antibiotic treatment [41, 42]. If the procalcitonin level is elevated, antibiotic treatment should be
given. The duration of antibiotic therapy should usually be 5–7 days.
Noninvasive ventilation
A meta-analysis from 2003 concluded that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is the first-line intervention in
patients with COPD exacerbation in addition to usual medical care [43]. NIV should be used early in the
course of disease. The numbers needed to treat to reduce mortality was only 8. At present, NIV is a
standard of care in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure [3, 38, 44].
Prevention of COPD exacerbations
The primary goal should be to prevent the first exacerbation. If that cannot be achieved, appropriate
measures for prevention of a subsequent exacerbation should be initiated [3].

 Smoking cessation
Smoking cessation is key to prevent further morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD [45]. It has
been shown that smoking cessation can slow decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) over time
in patients with COPD [46].
Although there is some evidence for lower annual exacerbation rates in smokers who switch to electronic
cigarettes [47], there is also evidence that electronic cigarettes may have significant pulmonary toxicity
[48]. Therefore, some organisations have suggested caution in using electronic cigarettes as a form of
nicotine replacement therapy until further data are available [49].
Pharmacotherapy
Bronchodilation with LABA and/or LAMA is recommended for most COPD patients. Several studies have
shown that long-acting bronchodilators reduce the risk of COPD exacerbation [50].
LABA monotherapy
Bronchodilation with the LABA salmeterol has been shown to reduce the annual rate of COPD
exacerbations by 20%, compared with placebo [51]. A reduction in exacerbation rate was also seen with
other LABAs [52]. The effect of LABA on exacerbations is irrespective of previous exacerbation history.
LAMA monotherapy
LAMAs seem to be more effective in preventing exacerbations compared to LABA [34, 35]. Bronchodilation
with LAMAs reduce exacerbation rates compared with placebo by ∼35% overall [50]. Therefore, both the
GOLD 2017 report and the recently published ERS/ATS guidelines for prevention of COPD favour LAMA
monotherapy over LABA monotherapy in patients with a history of exacerbations [3, 53].
Inhaled corticosteroids
While long-term therapy with oral corticosteroids is not recommended, long-term treatment with inhaled
corticosteroids (ICS) may be considered for patients with a history of exacerbations (GOLD groups C and
D) [3]. ICS therapy should always be combined with long-acting bronchodilators. Nevertheless, long-term
use of ICS in patients with COPD is still controversial. The most important adverse effects are increased
risks of pneumonia, diabetes and fractures [54–56]. In the WISDOM study, withdrawal of ICS was not
associated with an increased risk of exacerbations [57].
Recent studies have recommended using the peripheral blood eosinophil count as a biomarker for
directing corticosteroids in exacerbations of COPD [24], as discussed earlier, in the section on biomarkers.
In particular, patients with overlap of asthma and COPD and potentially high blood eosinophil counts
may benefit from the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to a bronchodilator therapy.
Combination therapies
With the many available fixed combinations (LABA/ICS and LABA/LAMA) it is easier to escalate therapy.
A significant reduction in terms of exacerbation can be achieved by combining a LABA and LAMA
compared to both LAMA alone or LABA/ICS [58, 59]. This further highlights that ICS should only be
used thoughtfully.
Most recently, GROSS and BARNES [60] summarised the latest developments in upcoming therapies for
COPD, including triple inhalers (fixed combinations of LABA/LAMA/ICS). The studies TRILOGY (Single
Inhaler Triple Therapy versus Inhaled Corticosteroid plus Long-acting β-Agonist Therapy for Chronic
Obstructive
Pulmonary
Disease)
and
TRINITY
(Single
Inhaler
Extrafine
Triple
Therapy
versus
Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonist Therapy for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) both showed a
reduction of exacerbations with triple therapy compared to LABA/ICS [61, 62]. There are no data yet on
triple therapy versus LABA/LAMA, but it is expected that two large trials will publish data later this year.
Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor
Both the GOLD 2017 report and the ERS/ATS guidelines for prevention of COPD recommend a
phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (roflumilast) as a treatment option for patients with COPD who have severe
and very severe airflow limitation, chronic bronchitis and a high risk of exacerbations [3, 53]. In a
Cochrane review of 29 randomised controlled trials (15 trials with roflumilast and 14 trials with
cilomilast), treatment with roflumilast compared with placebo was associated with a reduced likelihood of
COPD exacerbation (odds ratio (OR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.71–0.83) [63]. The most common adverse effects are
gastrointestinal in nature. Some concerns have been raised about psychiatric adverse effects (insomnia,
anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviour).

 Prophylactic antibiotics
In patients with cystic fibrosis, there is a well-established indication for the long-term use of inhaled
antibiotics to prevent exacerbation [64]. Since bacterial infections can trigger exacerbations in patients,
long-term antibiotic treatment has been considered in COPD, too. A Cochrane review of seven
randomised controlled trials in patients with COPD showed a clinically significant benefit with use of
continuous prophylactic antibiotics compared with placebo, while the benefit of intermittent antibiotic
prophylaxis remained uncertain [65]. With continuous prophylactic antibiotics both the number of
patients experiencing an exacerbation (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39–0.77) as well as the frequency of
exacerbations (rate ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.58–0.91) was reduced, compared with placebo.
Most evidence is available for macrolide antibiotics, while there are few data on fluoroquinolones. The
GOLD 2017 report states that macrolides can be considered in former smokers who have exacerbations
despite appropriate therapy [3]. The ERS/ATS guidelines for prevention of COPD exacerbations suggest
treatment with macrolide antibiotics for patients with moderate to very severe airflow obstruction and
exacerbations despite optimal inhaled therapy [53]. Nevertheless, potential risks such as antibiotic resistance
and specific adverse effects need to be considered when treating patients with prophylactic antibiotics [66].
Mucolytics
A Cochrane review of 34 studies showed that a mucolytic therapy in patients with COPD increases the
likelihood of being exacerbation free [67], compared with placebo. The number needed to treat (to keep an
additional patient free from exacerbations for an average of 10 months) was eight. However, due to much
heterogeneity between the studies, these data should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, the GOLD
2017 report recommends the use of mucolytics only in selected patients. The recently published ERS/ATS
guidelines for prevention of COPD exacerbations [53] suggest treatment with an oral mucolytic agent for
patients with moderate to severe airflow obstruction and exacerbations despite optimal inhaled therapy.
Monoclonal antibodies
In a recently published study on patients with COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype, mepolizumab (a
monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin-5) was associated with a lower annual rate of moderate
to severe exacerbations compared to placebo [68]. This was especially true for patients with higher blood
eosinophil counts at screening. While there are no data yet to generally recommend this treatment, it
suggests that eosinophilic airway inflammation may contribute to COPD exacerbations.
Physical activity and pulmonary rehabilitation
Activity is the strongest predictor of mortality in patients with COPD [69, 70], i.e. patients with low levels
of physical activity have a higher risk of mortality. While a Cochrane review showed high-quality evidence
for pulmonary rehabilitation versus controls to improve health-related quality of life and exercise capacity,
the results for reducing hospital readmissions were heterogeneous and the evidence of moderate quality
(pooled OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21–0.91) [71]. Nevertheless, beside smoking cessation and pharmacotherapy,
patients should be especially encouraged to increase their physical activity.
Education and self-management
The current GOLD 2017 report recommends better education and self-management of patients [3]. A
Cochrane review on self-management interventions for patients with COPD showed significant advantages
in terms of respiratory-related hospital admissions and dyspnoea [72].
Nutrition
While nutritional status is important for general outcome of COPD, there are no reliable studies on
nutrition and prevention of COPD exacerbations [73]. A Cochrane review showed only slight
improvements of nutritional supplementation in COPD [74].
Vaccination
Current guidelines recommend influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for patients with COPD [3]. Two
systematic Cochrane reviews showed a reduction in exacerbations in COPD patients for both vaccinations
versus control [75, 76].
Treatment of hypoxaemia and hypercapnia
Two trials undertaken in the 1970s showed a decrease in mortality in patients with COPD and severe
resting hypoxaemia when receiving home oxygen therapy (HOT) compared to nocturnal oxygen therapy
or control [77, 78]. In a more recent study from the Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial Research Group,
patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation had no benefit of HOT
versus the no supplemental oxygen group in terms of mortality, exacerbations or functional status [79].

ACUTE EXACERBATIONS | C. VINIOL AND C.F. VOGELMEIER
 The widely discussed study by KÖHNLEIN et al. [80] showed a dramatic improvement of 1-year mortality
(12% versus 33%) in patients with hypercapnic, stable COPD when home mechanical ventilation (HMV)
was targeted to reduce hypercapnia. Most recently, the first results from the HoT-HMV trial were
published in a late-breaking abstract [81]. 116 patients on HOT with persistent hypercapnia 2–4 weeks
after COPD exacerbations were randomised to either additional HMV or HOT alone. The addition of
HMV to HOT improved the admission-free survival (median 4.3 months versus 1.4 months). Although
both studies may be impacted by selection bias, the data emphasise the need for close monitoring of
hypercapnia after hospital discharge from severe exacerbation of COPD.
Intervention bronchoscopy
Several interventions have been tried to reduce emphysema-associated lung hyperinflation in patients with
COPD. For most patients, there were only modest treatment effects. In contrast, the rate of exacerbations
was even increased within the first 3 months after the intervention. Endobronchial coil treatment resulted
in a nonsignificant increase of risk for COPD exacerbation compared to usual care alone (27.7% versus
20.4%, p=0.15) [82]. For endobronchial valve therapy (7.9% versus 1.1%, p=0.03) and thermal vapour
ablation (24% versus 4%) there was a significant increase of exacerbation risk compared to control [83, 84].
9–12 months after the interventions the exacerbation risk was similar to that of the control groups.
Conclusions
COPD is and will remain a significant health burden. The prevention of exacerbations is one of the most
important treatment goals. To achieve that goal, patient education and smoking cessation programmes as
well as patient-tailored pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments are mandatory.
