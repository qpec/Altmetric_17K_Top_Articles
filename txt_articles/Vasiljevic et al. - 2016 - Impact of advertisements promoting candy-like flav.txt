ABSTRACT
Background There are concerns that the marketing of
e-cigarettes may increase the appeal of tobacco smoking
in children. We examined this concern by assessing the
impact on appeal of tobacco smoking after exposure to
advertisements for e-cigarettes with and without candy-
like flavours, such as, bubble gum and milk chocolate.
Methods We assigned 598 English school children
(aged 11–16 years) to 1 of 3 different conditions
corresponding to the adverts to which they were
exposed: adverts for flavoured e-cigarettes, adverts for
non-flavoured e-cigarettes or a control condition in
which no adverts were shown. The primary endpoint
was appeal of tobacco smoking. Secondary endpoints
were: appeal of using e-cigarettes, susceptibility to
tobacco smoking, perceived harm of tobacco, appeal of
e-cigarette adverts and interest in buying and trying
e-cigarettes.
Results Tobacco smokers and e-cigarette users were
excluded from analyses (final sample=471). Exposure to
either set of adverts did not increase the appeal of
tobacco smoking, the appeal of using e-cigarettes, or
susceptibility to tobacco smoking. Also, it did not reduce
the perceived harm of tobacco smoking, which was
high. Flavoured e-cigarette adverts were, however, more
appealing than adverts for non-flavoured e-cigarettes
and elicited greater interest in buying and trying
e-cigarettes.
Conclusions Exposure to adverts for e-cigarettes does
not seem to increase the appeal of tobacco smoking in
children. Flavoured, compared with non-flavoured,
e-cigarette adverts did, however, elicit greater appeal
and interest in buying and trying e-cigarettes. Further
studies extending the current research are needed to
elucidate the impact of flavoured and non-flavoured
e-cigarette adverts.
INTRODUCTION
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have the poten-
tial for benefit if they assist tobacco smokers to quit
or harm if they result in children smoking tobacco
cigarettes.1 While uncertainty remains regarding
their potential for benefit, evidence is accumulating
to suggest that e-cigarettes can successfully be used
as cessation aids by smokers.2 Uncertainty also
remains regarding their potential for harm, with
some
cross-sectional
studies
reporting
that
e-cigarette use among children is associated with
intention to smoke tobacco,3 4 and a recent longi-
tudinal study of US individuals aged 16–26 years
finding
that
use
of
e-cigarettes
at
baseline
is
associated with progression to tobacco smoking
1 year later.5
E-cigarettes are now the most commonly con-
sumed nicotine product among children in coun-
tries with strong tobacco control policies.6
7 A
recent WHO report suggested that e-cigarettes
could provide a gateway to tobacco smoking by: (1)
increased initiation of nicotine use which would
not have occurred if e-cigarettes did not exist and/
or (2) product swap from e-cigarettes to tobacco
among those who initially become addicted to
nicotine via e-cigarettes.8 The report also suggested
that e-cigarettes could renormalise tobacco smoking
by
enhancing
the
attractiveness
of
tobacco
smoking.8 On the basis of the social learning
theory, users of cigarettes of any kind may serve as
social role models to children observing them.9–11
Whereas the gateway hypothesis proposes that the
impact of e-cigarettes on tobacco smoking is indir-
ect, whereby children and adult non-smokers may
be at risk of migrating to tobacco smoking after
using e-cigarettes, the renormalisation hypothesis
proposes a direct route, whereby the presence of e-
cigarettes in the public arena is sufficient to encour-
age
children
and
adult
non-smokers
to
start
smoking tobacco without the intervening step of
first using e-cigarettes. In the present study our
primary aim was to test the impact of exposure to
e-cigarette
adverts
on
the
appeal
of
tobacco
smoking among children (renormalisation). Our
secondary aim was to test the impact of exposure
to e-cigarette adverts on the appeal of using e-
cigarettes (gateway hypothesis).
The increasing experimentation and use of e-
cigarettes by children could be due, in part, to the
lack of a regulatory framework surrounding e-
cigarette advertising.12 13 For example, in the USA,
exposure of children to TV e-cigarette adverts
increased by 256% from 2011 to 2013.14 Of par-
ticular interest are the possible attitudinal and
behavioural shifts in children that may result from
marketing of flavoured e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes are
marketed in 7764 different flavours.15 Particularly
concerning is the use of candy-like flavours (eg,
bubble gum, milk chocolate) used successfully in
the past to attract children to tobacco smoking.16
As
described
above,
candy-like
flavoured
e-
cigarettes may serve as a renormalising or gateway
product to tobacco cigarettes. Even if candy-like
flavoured e-cigarettes do not serve as gateway, or
renormalising products into tobacco smoking, they
may increase experimentation and eventual addic-
tion to nicotine delivered through e-cigarettes, a

 developing adolescent.8 17 The above concerns are supported by
research into candy-flavoured and liqueur-flavoured traditional
tobacco products which were heavily marketed to young people
since the 1970s until 2009 when regulations were imposed.18 19
Internal tobacco industry documents reveal that the use of fla-
vours in nicotine products targets potential new young custo-
mers: ‘It’s a well known fact that teenagers like sweet products.
Honey
might
be
considered’
(memo
recommending
the
company consider Coca-Cola or other sweet-flavoured cigar-
ettes).20 Internal documents describing research by the tobacco
industry also report that younger smokers are indeed more open
to unique and exotic flavours21 with these products, also
making smoking appear less risky and more acceptable.16 22
While this evidence suggests the potential for e-cigarettes to
increase the appeal of tobacco smoking, against this, the increas-
ing rates of e-cigarette use among children has not been paral-
leled by an increase in rates of tobacco smoking. In the USA,
e-cigarette use tripled from 2013 to 2014 among high schoolers
rising from 4.5% to 13.4%, and among middle school students
increasing from 1.1% to 3.9%, while tobacco smoking rates
declined from 15.8% to 9.2%, and 4.3% to 2.5%, respectively,
among these two groups from 2011 to 2014.7 These figures are
mirrored in England where e-cigarette use has risen from 5% in
2013 to 8% in 2014 among individuals aged 11–18 years,23
while tobacco smoking has declined from 5% in 2010 to 3% in
2014 among children aged 11–15 years.24
To date, there is no empirical evidence concerning the impact
of marketing of e-cigarettes with or without flavours on the
appeal of tobacco smoking in children. This study aims to
address this gap by estimating the impact of advertisements for
candy-like flavoured and non-flavoured e-cigarettes on the
appeal of tobacco smoking and e-cigarette use. The study was
conducted among English school children in the age range 11–
16 years when children are most likely to try and initiate daily
tobacco smoking.25
METHODS
Design
A between-subjects experiment with one independent factor of
three levels corresponding to the advertisements to which parti-
cipants were exposed:
A. Advertisements of candy-like flavoured e-cigarettes
B. Advertisements of non-flavoured e-cigarettes
C. No advertisements (control condition)
Participants
These comprised 598 English children aged 11–16 years attend-
ing two schools, one in Cambridgeshire and one in Hampshire
(for demographics see table 1). Randomisation was successful;
there were no significant differences between the three experi-
mental groups on any of the characteristics.
Those
who
reported
ever
having
smoked
tobacco
or
e-cigarettes were excluded from the analyses (n=127) resulting
in a final sample of 471 participants (for demographics of the
final sample see table 2). This sample size provided over 90%
power at α=0.05 to detect a medium-sized effect of either type
of advert on the appeal of tobacco smoking (based on a study of
the impact of standardised tobacco packaging using a similar
endpoint).26
Intervention
T
wenty-four adverts (12 for candy-like flavoured and 12 for
non-flavoured e-cigarettes) were chosen and pilot tested from a
larger sample of adverts sampled from the Stanford Adverts
Repository.27 T
wo authors (MV and DCP) selected adverts that
either explicitly showed candy-like flavours or not. With the
exception of flavouring descriptions, care was taken to choose
adverts as similar as possible in all other aspects (eg, showing an
e-cigarette pack with an e-cigarette next to it), including the
presence of a person (with three adverts in each of the
e-cigarette
advert
conditions
showing
a
person
using
an
e-cigarette).
Measures
Primary endpoint
Appeal of tobacco smoking
This was measured using 3 of the 11 bipolar items used by Ford
et al26 to measure tobacco pack appeal. W
e asked participants:
‘Please cross the circles that best describe how you feel about
smoking tobacco cigarettes’: unattractive-attractive, not cool-
cool and boring-fun (rated from 1 to 5, with 1 denoting lowest
appeal and 5 denoting highest appeal). Items were averaged into
a single index (α=0.85).
Secondary endpoints
Appeal of using e-cigarettes
This was measured with an adapted version of the scale used to
assess appeal of tobacco smoking, asking ‘Please cross the circles
that best describe how you feel about using e-cigarettes’
(α=0.87).
Perceived harm of smoking tobacco cigarettes
This was measured using three items developed by W
akefield
et al:28 ‘Smoking can harm your health’ rated from 1=Strongly
disagree to 5=Strongly agree, ‘How dangerous do you think it is
to smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day?’, and ‘How dangerous
do you think it is to smoke one or two cigarettes occasionally?’
both rated on five-point scales, 1=Not very dangerous to
5=Very dangerous. The inter-item reliability was low for this
scale (α=0.53). W
e therefore assessed this using the composite
score and separately just the first item which has been most
often used in the literature.

 Susceptibility to tobacco smoking
Three items based on the scale of Pierce et al29 and adapted by
Ford et al26 were used to assess participants’ susceptibility to
tobacco smoking: ‘If one of your friends offered you a cigarette,
would you smoke it?’, ‘Do you think you will smoke a cigarette
at any time during the next year?’, and ‘Do you think you will
be smoking cigarettes at 18 years old?’ All were rated on four-
point scales: definitely not, probably not, probably yes, definitely
yes. Participants were considered susceptible if they selected any
option other than definitely not.
Measures taken only in the groups exposed to e-cigarette adverts.
Appeal of e-cigarette adverts
This was assessed by asking: ‘How much do you like the advert
(not the product)?’ rated on scales from 1=Not at all to 4=A
lot.30 Responses to all 12 adverts were averaged into a single
index (α=0.83).
Interest in buying and trying e-cigarettes following adverts
This was assessed by responses to one item: ‘Does this advert
make you want to buy and try this product?’ with scores
ranging from 1=Not at all to 4=Yes, a lot.30 Responses were
averaged across the 12 adverts (α=0.90).
Other measures
Smoking status
This was assessed using two items ‘Have you ever smoked a cig-
arette?’ and ‘Have you ever tried or experimented with cigarette
smoking, even a few puffs?’ both answered on a binary yes–no
scale.29
E-cigarette awareness and use
T
wo
items
assessed
participants’
awareness
and
use
of
e-cigarettes (‘Before today, had you ever heard of e-cigarettes?’,
and ‘Have you ever used e-cigarettes?’) both answered on a
binary yes–no scale.
Demographic characteristics
The following characteristics were assessed: gender, age and
ethnicity.
Procedure
The study was conducted in schools. Ethics approval was
obtained
from
the
University
of
Cambridge’s
Psychology
Research Ethics Committee. Prior passive parental consent was
obtained, and the head-teachers of the schools acted in-loco par-
entis while the study was carried out. During data collection in
the schools, participating children were reminded that they
could withdraw from the study at any point.
The study materials were presented in paper–pencil format,
with each child receiving a booklet corresponding to one of the
three experimental conditions depending on randomisation.
Participants in the flavoured and non-flavoured e-cigarette
adverts conditions were each exposed to a series of 12
print-adverts in their booklets. To ensure that the children
engaged with the adverts, after each advert, we asked the chil-
dren to rate the appeal of the advert, and also their interest in
buying and trying the product shown in the advert (see
Measures section).
Participants were assigned to one of the three experimental
versions of the experiment by the experimenters. Prior to the
testing session the different versions of the booklets were
arranged in a fixed sequence (ABC, ABC). On arrival, children
chose any of the available seats. Booklets were then distributed
in class. Care was taken to ensure that the starting position for
issuing the sequence of booklets differed randomly between
classes. To maximise the independence of individual responses
children sitting on adjacent seats did not receive the same book-
lets. Experimenters made sure that children finishing earlier
than other children remained seated until the rest of the chil-
dren had finished. Once participants had completed their ques-
tionnaires, they were provided with verbal and written debrief
about the nature of the study and took part in a workshop on
tobacco smoking and e-cigarette use.
RESULTS
Examination of the distribution of the data revealed that
responses to the primary and secondary outcome measures were
not normally distributed. The subsequent analyses were there-
fore carried out using non-parametric statistical tests (for
descriptive statistics see table 3). Participants who answered yes
on either of the two smoking status questions (n=98), or who
affirmed that they had ever used e-cigarettes (n=73, including
29 non-smokers who had only used e-cigarettes) were removed

 from subsequent analyses. Sensitivity analyses carried out on the
full sample (including smokers and e-cigarette users) replicated
the reported results.
Appeal of tobacco smoking
The appeal of tobacco smoking was similarly low across the
three experimental groups: Kruskal-W
allis test, χ2(2)=1.673,
p=0.433, with a mean rank appeal score of 231.29 for the
control condition, 229.89 for the flavoured e-cigarettes condi-
tion, and 246.22 for the non-flavoured condition.
Appeal of using e-cigarettes
The appeal of using e-cigarettes was also similarly low across
the three experimental groups: Kruskal-W
allis test, χ2(2)=0.235,
p=0.889, with a mean rank appeal score of 239.04 for the
control condition, 233.74 for the flavoured e-cigarettes condi-
tion, and 232.15 for the non-flavoured condition.
Perceived harm of tobacco
The perceived harm of smoking tobacco cigarettes was similarly
high across the three experimental groups: Kruskal-W
allis test,
χ2(2)=1.955, p=0.376, with a mean rank harm score of 245.10
for the control condition, 224.61 for the flavoured e-cigarettes
condition, and 237.54 for the non-flavoured condition.
Since reliability analyses of the perceived harm of smoking
tobacco cigarettes showed that item reliability for the scale was
low, we also analysed the single item that is most often used in
the literature; ‘Smoking can harm your health’. This replicated
the null effect reported above when using the composite
measure: χ2(2)=1.222, p=0.543, with a mean rank harm score
of 240.07 for the control condition, 230.11 for the flavoured
e-cigarettes
condition,
and
236.71
for
the
non-flavoured
condition.
Susceptibility to tobacco smoking
Susceptibility to tobacco smoking was similar across the three
groups. A series of logistic regression analyses contrasting the
effects of the three experimental conditions on susceptibility to
tobacco smoking yielded no significant results, all p values
>0.441.
Measures taken only in the groups exposed to e-cigarette
adverts.
Appeal of e-cigarette adverts
Exposure
to
the
flavoured
e-cigarette
adverts
increased
the
appeal
of
e-cigarette
adverts:
Mann-Whitney
test,
U=10 056.500, Z=−2.777, p=0.005, whereby those who saw
the flavoured e-cigarette adverts rated them as more appealing
(mean rank=170.92) than those who saw the non-flavoured
e-cigarette adverts (mean rank=142.45).
Interest in buying and trying e-cigarettes
Exposure to the flavoured e-cigarette adverts increased interest
in
buying
and
trying
e-cigarettes:
Mann-Whitney
test,
U=9140.000, Z=−3.949, p<0.001, whereby those who saw the
flavoured e-cigarette adverts expressed greater interest in buying
and trying e-cigarettes (mean rank=176.44) than those who saw
the non-flavoured e-cigarette adverts (mean rank=136.26).
DISCUSSION
In an experimental study, we found no evidence that exposing
English children aged 11–16 years to adverts for candy-like fla-
voured and non-flavoured e-cigarettes increased the low appeal
of smoking tobacco, the low appeal of using e-cigarettes, or low
susceptibility to tobacco smoking. Nor did it reduce the high
perceived harm of tobacco smoking. Flavoured e-cigarette
adverts compared with non-flavoured adverts were, however,
more appealing, and elicited greater interest in buying and
trying e-cigarettes.
Our data provide no support for the renormalisation hypoth-
esis, since exposure to e-cigarette adverts did not increase the
appeal of tobacco smoking in this sample of children. However,
our data suggest that certain types of e-cigarette advertising (eg,
for candy-like flavoured e-cigarettes) may provide a gateway into
tobacco smoking by increasing the appeal of e-cigarette adverts,
and increasing interest in buying and trying e-cigarettes. Future
studies could use the social learning theory and other relevant
theories to test the proposed gateway and renormalisation
hypotheses for the impact of e-cigarette exposure on tobacco
use.9
These results provide the first evidence regarding the impact
of exposure to e-cigarette adverts on the appeal of tobacco
smoking. Whether the observed null effect of e-cigarette adverts
on appeal also indicates the absence of an effect on tobacco
smoking depends on the relationship between appeal and
smoking behaviour. Appeal is an attitude, affective in origin,
involving positive or negative feelings towards an object or
behaviour (see Ajzen31 for a discussion of the relationship
between attitudes and behaviour). Affect takes primacy in influ-
encing many judgements and much behaviour (for reviews and
models see refs 32 and 33). In keeping with this, the appeal of
tobacco smoking predicts subsequent tobacco smoking in young
people.34
35 Replicating the current study using more vivid
adverts, other measures of appeal (eg, IAT36), as well as tobacco
cigarette use assessed prospectively, will increase the confidence
attached to the current findings.
While we found no evidence that exposure to adverts
increased the appeal of tobacco smoking, exposure to candy-like
flavoured as opposed to non-flavoured e-cigarettes did increase
the appeal of e-cigarette adverts and interest in buying and
trying these products. This fits with the extant literature on
flavoured nicotine products and their appeal to children.16 20 22
The plethora of different flavoured e-cigarettes (documented as
7764 in 2014, and rising,15) may explain the increases in
e-cigarette
use
documented
in
the
UK,
the
USA
and
Canada.6 7 37 Our findings, combined with recent prevalence
figures of e-cigarette use, highlight the need for more research
into the effects of flavoured e-cigarettes on young non-smokers,
and how this may impact uptake of e-cigarettes, and the poten-
tial
for
eventual
migration
to
tobacco
smoking
(gateway
hypothesis).
While adverts did not affect the appeal of using e-cigarettes,
they affected children’s interest in buying and trying e-cigarettes.
There are two main possible reasons for such a difference in
effects. First, one of the outcome measures taps into more
general appeal of long-term use of e-cigarettes, whereas the
other measure taps into shorter term interest in buying and
trying e-cigarettes without necessarily making a commitment for
long-term use. Second, appeal of using e-cigarettes was mea-
sured in general terms, whereas interest in buying and trying e-
cigarettes was measured specifically with reference to the
adverts participants were exposed to. Future studies should
further examine these differential effects.
Strengths, limitations and suggestions for future work
Our study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to use an
experimental design to examine the impact of exposing children
to adverts for flavoured and non-flavoured e-cigarettes.

 One limitation pertains to the primary endpoint, which was a
measure of attitude and not behaviour. Future studies would
benefit from measuring actual smoking behaviour. Similarly,
tobacco smoking carries a stigma, therefore, it is possible that
children gave socially desirable answers regarding the appeal of
tobacco smoking. Future studies would benefit from using impli-
cit measures to examine the appeal of tobacco smoking. Since
interest in buying and trying e-cigarettes was examined after
each advert, it was not possible to ask children for their interest
in buying and trying tobacco cigarettes, since adverts of tobacco
were not shown in this study. Future research could consider a
condition where tobacco adverts are shown, in order to gauge
parallel responses to all the measures for both e-cigarette and
tobacco products.
Furthermore, children were exposed to still images of adverts.
Future studies should examine the effects of e-cigarette adverts
using different formats such as videos. Examining children’s
exposure to e-cigarettes via their peers in their naturalistic envir-
onments would also complement the current findings. In add-
ition, we only had one control condition in which children were
not exposed to any adverts. Future studies could extend the
design to incorporate a control condition similar to those in the
e-cigarette advert conditions (eg, adverts for neutral products,
like stationery). This would ensure that task demands are kept
equal across all conditions.
While we found the same pattern of results when carrying
out sensitivity analyses on the full randomised sample including
tobacco smokers and e-cigarette users, it is possible that our
results underestimate the effects of e-cigarette adverts on
tobacco smoking, since by removing the smokers and e-cigarette
users we may have ended up with a sample of the least suscep-
tible children. Future studies should extend the present findings
by specifically sampling children who are tobacco smokers and
e-cigarette users.
Implications for policy
Currently, across Europe and the USA, marketing and advertise-
ment of e-cigarettes is unregulated. In the UK, before EU-wide
regulation takes place in 2016, the Committee on Advertising
Practice has issued rules for the advertising of e-cigarettes.12
Key aspect of these rules is that e-cigarette adverts must not be
likely to appeal to people under 18 years, to non-smokers or
non-nicotine users, and must not have models appearing
younger than 25 years. These interim rules do not provide any
explicit prohibitions regarding the advertising of candy-like
flavours.
Our results point to a need for further examination of the
rules surrounding e-cigarette advertising especially in light of
the growing popularity of e-cigarettes among children.6 7 37
While our study suggests that e-cigarette adverts do not increase
the appeal of tobacco smoking, allowing us to be cautiously
optimistic that e-cigarette advertising does not directly renor-
malise tobacco smoking, our results provide evidence that chil-
dren find adverts for candy-like flavoured e-cigarettes more
appealing than adverts for non-candy-like e-cigarettes, poten-
tially serving as a gateway into tobacco smoking. In addition to
the gateway concerns, the heightened appeal of the adverts and
interest in buying e-cigarettes in children arising from adverts
promoting candy-like flavoured e-cigarettes is of concern in and
of itself in view of the dangers to the developing brain arising
from nicotine exposure and addiction,8 17 38 as well as the
unknown long-term physiological effects of using e-cigarettes
and secondhand exposure to vaping.39
What this paper adds
▸ E-cigarette use is rising among children and adolescents,
with fears that their use could lead to tobacco smoking.
▸ Internal tobacco industry documents show that young
people find nicotine products with candy-like flavours more
appealing than those without.
▸ E-cigarettes are currently marketed in over 7764 different
flavours.
▸ There are currently no studies examining the impact of
e-cigarette adverts, with or without flavours, on the appeal
of tobacco smoking in children.
▸ Adverts promoting candy-like flavoured or non-flavoured
e-cigarettes did not increase the current low appeal of
tobacco smoking.
▸ Adverts promoting candy-like flavoured compared with
non-flavoured e-cigarettes were more appealing and elicited
greater interest in buying and trying e-cigarettes among
English children aged 11–16 years.
▸ Further studies replicating and extending the current
research are needed to elucidate the impact of candy-like
flavoured and non-flavoured e-cigarette adverts.
