Abstract
Background: Early-life exposure to household pets has the capacity to reduce risk for overweight and allergic disease,
especially following caesarean delivery. Since there is some evidence that pets also alter the gut microbial composition of
infants, changes to the gut microbiome are putative pathways by which pet exposure can reduce these risks to health. To
investigate the impact of pre- and postnatal pet exposure on infant gut microbiota following various birth scenarios, this
study employed a large subsample of 746 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Study
(CHILD) cohort, whose mothers were enrolled during pregnancy between 2009 and 2012. Participating mothers were
asked to report on household pet ownership at recruitment during the second or third trimester and 3 months
postpartum. Infant gut microbiota were profiled with 16S rRNA sequencing from faecal samples collected at the mean
age of 3.3 months. Two categories of pet exposure (i) only during pregnancy and (ii) pre- and postnatally were compared
to no pet exposure under different birth scenarios.
Results: Over half of studied infants were exposed to at least one furry pet in the prenatal and/or postnatal periods, of
which 8% were exposed in pregnancy alone and 46.8% had exposure during both time periods. As a common effect in
all birth scenarios, pre- and postnatal pet exposure enriched the abundance of Oscillospira and/or Ruminococcus (P < 0.05)
with more than a twofold greater likelihood of high abundance. Among vaginally born infants with maternal intrapartum
antibiotic prophylaxis exposure, Streptococcaceae were substantially and significantly reduced by pet exposure (P < 0.001,
FDRp = 0.03), reflecting an 80% decreased likelihood of high abundance (OR 0.20, 95%CI, 0.06–0.70) for pet exposure
during pregnancy alone and a 69% reduced likelihood (OR 0.31, 95%CI, 0.16–0.58) for exposure in the pre- and postnatal
time periods. All of these associations were independent of maternal asthma/allergy status, siblingship, breastfeeding
exclusivity and other home characteristics.
Conclusions: The impact of pet ownership varies under different birth scenarios; however, in common, exposure to pets
increased the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been negatively associated with
childhood atopy and obesity.

 Background
Microbial colonization of the infant gastrointestinal tract
is an essential process in our life cycle, and microbiota-
host interactions during this developmental stage of life
have a significant influence on future health. Following
birth, the gut microbiota of newborns is characterized by
low diversity, dominated by facultative anaerobes such
as the Proteobacteria, after which the diversity of strict
anaerobes within the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla
increases towards an adult-like profile by 1 year of age
[1–3]. Throughout this development, microbial compos-
ition is shaped by a number of factors including gesta-
tional age, mode of delivery (vaginal vs. caesarean),
infant diet (breast milk vs. formula) and antibiotic treat-
ment (direct vs. indirect via mother) [4, 5]. Among sev-
eral environmental determinants that influence postnatal
gut microbial development, rising rates of pet ownership
globally have stimulated interest on the impact of house-
hold furry pets.
The notion that pets provide an immune benefit to
human health stems from the hygiene hypothesis, first
proposed by David Strachan in 1989 [6] and subse-
quently supported by several epidemiological studies
[7–12], which attributes risk of allergic disease to overly
hygienic environments. With further evidence that gut
microbial dysbiosis during infancy is associated with the
development of allergic disease, this notion has been re-
vised as the ‘microbiota hypothesis’ [13]. Despite rapid
microbial colonization of the gut after birth, environ-
mental microbes in the antenatal and/or early postnatal
period represent a critical exposure for early-life im-
mune programming that may have long-term conse-
quences.
A
pooled
analysis
of
7000
households
documented that dog ownership during the first 2 years
of life reduced sensitization to allergens in early child-
hood, although the evidence for asthma prevention was
less clear [14]. In a meta-analysis of six studies that eval-
uated prenatal exposure to household pets, a lowered
risk for allergic disease (atopic dermatitis, asthma) in off-
spring was found, especially for prenatal dog ownership
[10]. Havstad et al. [15] documented lowered IgE levels
until 2 years of age following pet exposure during preg-
nancy, which were not altered by postnatal pet owner-
ship. Further, the prenatal pet association was strongest
for children born by caesarean section (CS). Still others
have found that postnatal pet ownership modified early-
life risk factors for metabolic diseases. In the absence of
household pets, Cassidy-Bushrow et al. [16] reported a
twofold higher risk of obesity at the age of 2 in CS-
delivered infants compared to those born vaginally.
However, no association was found between CS delivery
and toddler obesity in the presence of pet ownership.
In a pilot study of 24 infants, our group observed higher
microbial richness and diversity of the infant gut in the
presence of household pets at 3 months of age with
under-representation
of
Bifidobacteriaceae
and
over-
representation of Peptostreptococcaceae [17]. Nermes et
al. [11] found counts of Bifidobacterium breve to be lower
but Bifidobacterium longum to be higher in non-wheezing
infants exposed to pets. In their subsequent analysis [18],
pet-exposed infants harboured more animal-specific Bifi-
dobacterium pseudolongum, indicating the bacterial trans-
fer from pets to infants. Moreover, our previous findings
also highlighted that pets can alter house dust microbiota
[19]. This study is a follow-up to our previous pilot study,
undertaking an evaluation of the influence of household
pets on faecal microbial composition at 3–4 months after
birth in a large subsample of 746 infants from the Canad-
ian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD)
national population-based birth cohort. In this study, we
aimed to determine the existence of gut microbial associa-
tions with prenatal and/or postnatal pet exposures under
different scenarios, independent of siblingship and other
covariates.
Methods
Study design
This study involved a subsample of 804 infants from
three study sites (Edmonton, Vancouver and Winni-
peg) of the CHILD cohort (www.canadianchildstu-
dy.ca). Mothers of the studied infants were enrolled
during
pregnancy
between
2009
and
2012.
The
mothers were asked about pet ownership in a stan-
dardized questionnaire at recruitment in the second
or
third
trimester
of
pregnancy
and
3
months
postpartum. Microbiota analysis was performed on
faecal samples collected from infants at 3–4 months,
with complete pre- and postnatal pet exposure data
(n = 753). A pet exposure variable denoting four mu-
tually exclusive categories was created as follows: (1)
no pet exposure in the pre- or postnatal periods, (2)
only prenatal pet exposure, (3) both pre- and postna-
tal pet exposure and (4) only postnatal pet exposure
(Fig. 1a). Due to the limited number of infants (n = 7)
in the fourth category, we excluded that category
from the analysis, leaving 746 with complete data for
subsequent analysis. Table 1 shows demographic char-
acteristics of the studied infants with differential pet
exposure status. Data on other covariates were ob-
tained from hospital records (mode of delivery, intra-
partum
antibiotic
prophylaxis
(IAP))
or
from
standardized
questionnaires
completed
by
mothers
(maternal race, maternal asthma and allergy status
during pregnancy, type of home, size of household,
type of floor, presence of siblings, breastfeeding status
and
infant
antibiotic
exposure
before
3
months).

board at the University of Alberta.
Faecal microbiota analysis
Faecal samples of infants were collected at the mean age
of 3.34 months (range 2.7–4.3) using a standard protocol
during a planned home visit. Methods of sample collec-
tion, DNA extraction and amplification, 16S rRNA se-
quencing
and
taxonomic
classification
have
been
previously described [20, 21]. Briefly, samples were refrig-
erated immediately after collection and during transport
and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Genomic DNA was ex-
tracted from 80 to 200 mg of stool using the QIAamp
DNA Stool Mini kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands).
The V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA
gene was amplified by PCR using universal bacterial
primers: V4-515f: 5′ AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC
GAG ATC TAC ACT ATG GTA ATT GTG TGC CAG
CMG CCG CGG TAA-3′, V4-806r:5′–CAA GCA GAA

CAG TCA GCC GGA CTA CHV GGG TWT CTA AT-
3′. For sample multiplexing, reverse primers were bar-
coded uniquely for each sample (barcoded sequence was
denoted in the primer sequence by Xs). Each 25 μl PCR
mixture contained 12.5 μl 2x Kapa2G Hotstart mix (Kapa
Biosystems, Wilmington, MA), 0.6 μM of both forward
and reverse primers and 2 μl genomic DNA (5 ng/μl).
PCR amplification consisted of an initial denaturation step
for 3 min at 94 °C, followed by 20 cycles of denaturation
for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 50 °C and an exten-
sion step for 30 s at 72 °C. PCR reactions for each sample
were performed in triplicate with a negative control in

 each run. One hundred nanograms of pooled PCR prod-
uct from each sample was concentrated using an Amicon
Ultra-4 30K centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA), run on a 1.4% agarose gel, extracted and cleaned
with the GENE-CLEAN Turbo Kit (MP Biomedicals Inc,
Solon, OH, USA).
Pooled PCR amplicons were subjected to paired-end
sequencing by Illumina Miseq platform. Using a QIIME
pipeline (v1.6.0, qiime.org) [22], forward and reverse
reads were assembled using PandaSeq for a final length
of 144 bp (unassemblable sequences discarded), demulti-
plexed and filtered against the GREENGENES reference
database (v13.8) [23] to remove all sequences with <60%
similarity. Remaining sequences were clustered with
Usearch61
at
97%
sequence
similarity
against
the
GREENGENES database (closed picking algorithm), and
taxonomic assignment was achieved using the RDP clas-
sifier [24] constrained by GREENGENES. After taxo-
nomic assignment, operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
representing bacterial origin were selected, and bacterial
OTUs with overall relative abundance below 0.0001
were excluded from subsequence for downstream ana-
lyses. To avoid the bias due to variation in sequencing
depths among samples, data were rarefied to 13,000 se-
quences per sample.
Statistical analysis
With the recommended pipeline in QIIME, relative abun-
dance of bacterial OTUs was summarized at the phylum,
family and genus levels. Microbial alpha diversity within
samples was calculated with three standard indices
(Chao1, Shannon and Simpson). Microbial community
differences between samples (beta diversity) were exam-
ined by the
permutational multivariate analysis of vari-
ance
(PERMANOVA)
comparison
of
unweighted
UNIFRAC distance matrices, with 1000 permutations.
Spearman correlation analyses were performed to address
associations between pet exposure, other covariates and
microbiota measures, and illustrated using the R package
corrplot. Median richness, diversity and relative abun-
dance of dominant taxonomic groups were compared by
non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test, followed by
post hoc comparisons between non-exposed and pet ex-
posure groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. As shown
in previous reports [20, 25], ratios of specific taxa are
commonly evaluated due to the co-existence nature of gut
microbiota. We evaluated three ratios: Firmicutes to Bac-
teroidetes (F/B) ratio, Firmicutes to Proteobacteria (F/P)
ratio and Enterobacteriaceae to Bacteroidaceae (E/B) ratio.
Since caesarean birth and maternal IAP are major micro-
biota disruption exposures [21], we performed our ana-
lyses within four different birth scenarios for infants born:
(1) vaginally without IAP, (2) vaginally with IAP, (3) by
scheduled CS and (4) by emergency CS. To restrict the
effects of siblingship and exclusively breastfeeding, com-
parisons were conducted for specific groups with or with-
out siblings, non-exclusively breastfed infants, as well as
non-exclusively breastfed infants without siblings. Inde-
pendent associations between microbiota abundance and
pet exposure were tested by multiple variable logistic re-
gression, with microbiota measures categorised as above
and below the median.
To identify discriminative taxonomic biomarkers, the
linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSE) was deter-
mined with a LDA log score cut-off of 2, followed by the
Kruskal-Wallis test with the Dunn’s multiple comparison
test, using no pet exposure as the reference group. Ex-
cluded were infants from non-Caucasian mothers, those
with direct antibiotic exposure from birth to 3 months of
age and infants exclusively breastfed.
Results
Study population and exposures to household furry pets
In this population cohort of 746 infants, less than half of
households had no pets (45.2%, n = 337), 8% (n = 60) of
households owned pets only during the index pregnancy
(48.3% dog only, 36.1% cat only, 8.3% both dog and cat,
and 7.3% other furry pets) and 46.8% (n = 349) owned
furry pets both in the pregnancy and postnatal time pe-
riods (44.1% dog only, 33.8% cat only, 20.1% both dog
and cat, 2% other furry pets). Table 1 shows household
characteristics for each pet exposure category. Signifi-
cant differences by pet ownership were found according
to study location (P < 0.001), maternal race (P < 0.001)
and type of home (P = 0.007).
Overall community structure of gut microbiota, diversity
and richness of gut microbiota
Significant microbial community differences were de-
tected by PERMANOVA by prenatal (pseudo F = 2.03, P
= 0.001), as well as pre- and postnatal exposures (pseudo
F = 1.51, P = 0.005) in all children. Under individual birth
scenarios, the impact of any pet exposure was significant
only for infants born by emergency CS (pseudo F = 2.02,
P = 0.001) (Additional file 1: Table S1). Overall microbial
richness of the infant gut and species richness within the
Firmicutes phylum were significantly elevated with pet
exposure during pregnancy alone (Additional file 2:
Table S2). Upon stratification by birth mode, these
trends remained but statistical significance was lost, ex-
cept for species richness of Firmicutes in vaginally born
infants without IAP exposure (Additional file 3: Table
S3). Reduced species richness within the Proteobacteria
phylum became more statistically significant among in-
fants who were born vaginally without IAP exposure (es-
pecially for prenatal exposure alone) and who were born
by emergency CS (for both pre- and postnatal exposure)
(Additional file 3: Table S3). Although there was no
Tun et al. Microbiome  (2017) 5:40 
Page 5 of 14
 significant impact on overall microbial diversity (Shan-
non index), pre- and postnatal pet exposure significantly
increased the species richness (Chao1) and diversity
(Shannon) within the Firmicutes phylum (Additional file
2: Table S2). After stratification by birth scenario, these
trends were consistent but were not statistically signifi-
cant (Additional file 3: Table S3).
Taxonomic composition of gut microbiota
Vaginal with no IAP
Among the dominant phyla, Proteobacteria were under-
represented among infants born vaginally with no IAP
when pets were present (P = 0.005, FDRp = 0.07, Table 2).
This reduced abundance was more prominent when pet
exposure was solely prenatal, whereas the impact of pre-
and postnatal pet ownership became more statistically
significant in non-exclusively breastfed infants (Add-
itional file 4: Table S4). In conjunction with depleted
Proteobacterial abundance, significant increases to the
Firmicutes/Proteobacteria (F/P) ratio were observed by
pet exposure (P = 0.003, FDRp = 0.05, Table 2). The im-
pact of pre- and postnatal exposure on the F/P ratio also
became more significant in non-exclusively breastfed in-
fants (Additional file 4: Table S4).
With prenatal pet exposure alone, there was a twofold
odds for high abundance of Vellionellaceae and unclassi-
fied Lachnospiraceae; high F/P ratios were also more
likely (Fig. 2 and Additional file 5: Table S5). These
microbiota associations were attenuated when exposure
to furry pets continued in the postnatal period. Collect-
ively, pre- and postnatal pet ownership was associated
with 1.5-fold increases to high Firmicutes species rich-
ness in infants, and high abundance of Verrucomicrobia-
ceae and of genus Clostridium (Fig. 2 and Additional file
5: Table S5).
Vaginal with IAP
At the family level, median abundance of Streptococcaceae
were substantially and significantly reduced by prenatal
pet exposure (P < 0.001, FDRp = 0.03, Table 2). However,
the prenatal only association was attenuated in the ab-
sence of older siblings at home. Pre- and postnatal pet ex-
posure also enriched the Bacteroidaceae, an elevation not
seen in non-exclusively breastfed infants (Additional file 4:
Table S4).
Twofold increases were found in the odds of high di-
versity within the Firmicutes and of high abundance
with Bacteroidaceae. The E/B ratio was reduced by 53%
(95%CI 0.25–0.89) and high abundance of Streptococca-
ceae by almost one third (95%CI 0.16–0.58) compared
to infants without pet exposure in the pre- and postnatal
time periods (Fig. 2 and Additional file 5: Table S5).
High Streptococcaceae levels were also substantially less
likely for infants exposed to pets only during pregnancy
(unadjusted OR 0.20, 95%CI 0.06–0.70) (Fig. 2 and
Additional file 5: Table S5).
Following exposure to pets during pregnancy and
postnatally, a rare member of Proteobacteria, genus Bilo-
phila, was depleted after vaginal birth with maternal IAP
and no exclusive breastfeeding (P = 0.02, log LDA score
of 3.5, Additional file 6: Table S6 and Additional file 7:
Figure S1).
Emergency CS
Enrichment of the median abundance of Bifidobacteria-
ceae was observed in infants born by emergency CS with
pet exposure (P = 0.003, FDRp = 0.05, Table 2), an associ-
ation which disappeared in non-exclusively breastfed in-
fants
(Additional
file
4:
Table
S4).
There
was
a
substantial and significant link between prenatal pet ex-
posure
and
high
abundance
of
Bifidobacteriaceae
(unadjusted OR 7.53, 95%CI 1.44–39.50, Additional file
5: Table S5). Concurrently, high species richness within
Proteobacteria and high levels of Enterobacteriaceae
were much less likely to be present (Fig. 2 and
Additional file 5: Table S5). When emergency CS
was
not
followed
by
exclusive
breastfeeding,
the
combined impact of pet exposure during pregnancy
and postpartum was reduced abundance of the genus
Citrobacter (P = 0.03, log LDA score of 3.4) and
genus Lactococcus (P = 0.03, log LDA score of 2.5,
Additional file 6: Table S6 and Additional file 7:
Figure S1).
All birth scenarios
At the genus level, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira were
over-represented in infants exposed to pets in all birth
scenarios (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1b and Table 3). With the ex-
ception of vaginal birth with no IAP, these associations
were less statistically significant among infants with
non-exclusive breastfeeding (Additional file 8: Table S7).
Prenatal pet exposure alone was associated with high
abundance
of
Ruminococcus
(unadjusted
OR
2.98,
95%CI 1.30–6.81) and Oscillospira (unadjusted OR 2.56,
95%CI 1.19–5.53, Fig. 2 and Additional file 5: Table S5)
following vaginal birth with no IAP. Associations with
genus Oscillospira were unchanged with continuing pet
exposure in these infants. More than twofold increases
in the odds for high abundance of Ruminococcus (un-
adjusted OR 2.43, 95%CI 1.29–4.59) were also observed
following IAP in vaginal birth. In a subgroup of these
IAP-exposed infants who were not exclusively breastfed
afterwards, the Ruminococcaceae population was signifi-
cantly enriched by prenatal pet exposure alone (P =
0.002, and log LDA score of 4.2, Additional file 6: Table
S6 and Additional file 7: Figure S1).
Among the few associations found in infants delivered by
scheduled CS, a threefold likelihood in high abundance of

 Oscillospira (95%CI 1.27–7.67) was observed with com-
bined prenatal and postnatal pet exposure. High levels of
both genus Oscillospira (unadjusted OR 3.54, 95%CI 1.54–
8.14) and genus Ruminococcus (unadjusted OR 2.53, 95%CI
1.11–5.75) were more likely among infants born via emer-
gency CS. In the absence of exclusive breastfeeding after

 logistic regression (Fig. 2 and Additional file 5: Table
S5). Sequential adjustment for potential confounding
variables (Table 1) such as study location, maternal
race, maternal history of allergy and asthma during
pregnancy, type of home, siblingship, antibiotic ex-
posure and breastfeeding status at 3 months showed
that associations between pet ownership and infant
gut microbiota were generally robust and independ-
ent of these early-life events and environmental ex-
posures.
Some
associations
were
moderately
attenuated with adjustment, especially for breastfeed-
ing status, maternal race and siblingship (Fig. 2 and
Additional file 5: Table S5).
Discussion
In this general population cohort of 746 Canadian in-
fants, we observed higher overall species richness and
changes to taxon abundance in gut microbiota of infants
exposed to furry pets during pregnancy or continuing to
the postnatal period. These findings are in agreement
with our previous report [17] of postnatal pet exposure
on 3-month gut microbiota but not with studies in later
infancy [26]. Moreover, elevations in microbial species
richness in this study were evident with prenatal pet ex-
posure. Since several studies including our own within
the same cohort have reported low microbiota richness
in early life to be associated with food sensitization and
other atopic diseases [20, 27, 28], higher microbial rich-
ness with prenatal pet exposure may confer protection
against the development of atopy.
Our study revealed that pet exposure significantly in-
creased species richness in the phylum Firmicutes, com-
posed of families like the Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae
and Ruminococcaceae. These families of the Firmicutes
are obligate anaerobes which reduce the oxidative state of
the gut [29]; they are common constituents of the gut
microbiota of healthy infants and severely depleted in
malnourished infants [30]. In particular, we found Rumi-
nococcus, or Oscillospira, belonging to the Ruminococca-
ceae, to be more abundant (median levels and levels above
the median) among infants exposed to pets pre- and post-
natally across all birth scenarios. Associations with rumi-
nococcal abundance above the median were independent
of all covariates, but attenuated after adjustment for
breastfeeding status and maternal race. Prenatal pet ex-
posure alone was sufficient to produce associations with
Ruminococcus or Oscillospira, even under conditions of
undisturbed gut microbiota following vaginal birth and no
IAP. Of note, enrichment in faecal Oscillospira was among
the few changes observed for pet ownership within infants
delivered by scheduled CS.
Oscillospira is an enigmatic bacterium which has never
been isolated in culture, but has been detected by 16S
rRNA gene surveys of the human microbiome in
Fig. 2 Likelihoods of infant gut microbiota measures at 3–4 months according to pet exposure (parental alone vs. both pre- and postnatal) and
various birth scenarios (a Vaginal, IAP-, b Vaginal, IAP+, c Shecduled Caesarean, and d Emergency Caesarean), with individual adjustments for
potential confounding variables: Model A: location, B: Maternal race, C: Maternal asthma and D: maternal allergy during pregnancy, E: Type of

 association with leanness or lower body mass index in
both infants and adults [31–35]. Members of the genus
Oscillospira are highly heritable, predominate in the lean
host and are positively associated with the leanness-
promoting bacterium, Christensenella minuta [32]. Esco-
ber et al. [34] also reported decreasing abundance of
Oscillospira with obesity in three different geographical
regions, despite substantial differences in gut microbial
composition. As confirmed by meta-analysis [33], the
abundance of Oscillospira has also been found to be
negatively associated with paediatric inflammatory bowel
disease [36]. The health-promoting effects of Oscillospira
are not fully understood. Unlike Ruminococcus, they are
not fibre degraders but rather, produce butyrate by rely-
ing on fermentation products secreted by other bacterial
species or on sugars liberated from host mucins [37].
This is supported by an elegant animal study comparing
the microbiota response to fasting across different verte-
brates [38]. In this study, Oscillospira were observed to
be the only genus whose levels increased during fasting,
indicating their ability to degrade host glycans such as
fucose, sialic acids and glucuronic acid.
Members of Ruminococcus have also been detected in
the stool of neonates and infants [39] but are reportedly
absent in some infants delivered vaginally or by CS [40].
Like the Oscillospira, they are also present in dogs and
cats [41]. The role of ruminococci in infant health is also
poorly understood. Among their noticeable functions,
these microbes stimulate the production and degrad-
ation of mucin [42], vital to the maintenance of an intact
microbiota-mucin barrier. They are also fibre degraders
[43] and predominant in formula-fed infants [44, 45].
Yet, ruminococci are still found in breastfed infants and
interestingly,
their
colonization
depends
on
the
oligosaccharide content of breast milk [46]. Lastly, they
produce ruminococcin A, a bacteriocin which can in-
hibit various pathogenic species of Clostridium [47]. In
our previous study within the same cohort, we observed
a strong link between low levels of Ruminococcaceae
and food sensitization at age 1, even after adjustment for
major microbiota-disrupting events [20].
Our current study also suggests the potential for pet
ownership to assist in reducing the burden of group B
Streptococcus (GBS) in infants by lowering the abundance
of its family, Streptococcaceae. According to a recent
paper from McCloskey et al. [48], antenatal pet exposure
has been linked to reduced cardiovascular risk of infants
born to mothers colonized with GBS during pregnancy. In
Canada and elsewhere, the major indication for providing
IAP is to prevent GBS infection in newborns [49]. Within
vaginally born infants with IAP, we found that prenatal pet
exposure reduced the abundance of faecal Streptococca-
ceae; this association could not be explained by sibling-
ship, breastfeeding status or other covariates. With
mechanisms for microbe interactions to be elucidated, it
is conceivable that bacteriocin produced from Ruminococ-
cus, a microbe which was more abundant in study infants
when Streptococcaceae were depleted, inhibits growth of
streptococci. However, others have found lowered abun-
dance of Oscillospira but elevated levels of Ruminococcus
to co-occur with a greater abundance of Streptococcaceae
at 6 months following vaginal GBS colonization in primar-
ily formula-fed infants [50].
Under birth scenarios involving vaginal delivery, Pro-
teobacteria became less abundant in infants with postna-
tal pet exposure which commenced prenatally. After
emergency CS, the following changes with pet exposure
were
observed
for

 richness, and abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and of
Citrobacter. Pet exposure was also significantly associ-
ated with reduced Enterobacteriaceae among infants
born vaginally without IAP but not exclusively breastfed
afterwards. While our findings appear to contradict re-
ports of greater Escherichia coli colonization in the vagi-
nal microbiome of pregnant women who own pets [51],
the timing of microbial changes in the developmental
trajectory of infant microbiota is important to consider.
Following vaginal delivery, Proteobacteria (especially En-
terobacteriaceae) are dominant within 3 months after
birth, while Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes become more
prevalent as the gut microbiota matures towards an
adult-like profile [52]. A bloom of Proteobacteria in the
gut can indicate instability in the microbial community
[53]; greater abundance (along with a higher abundance
of streptococci) in 6-month-old infants has predicted fu-
ture adiposity [54]. Using the E/B ratio as an indicator
for gut microbiota maturity, we previously reported that
a higher ratio predicted food sensitization at age 1 [20];
in the current study, pet exposure lowered the E/B ratio
in vaginally born infants exposed to IAP. Using another
ratio to represent gut microbiota maturity in the current
study, pet exposure was linked to a higher F/P ratio fol-
lowing vaginal birth in the absence of maternal IAP. Of
note, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira were also elevated
under these circumstances.
Additional discussion of the differential impact of pet
exposure on scheduled versus emergency CS is warranted.
When compared to scheduled CS, our previous study also
reported a distinct microbiota profile in infants born via
emergency CS, posited to be a function of the multiplicity
of exposures, such as repeated antibiotic treatment and
prolonged hospitalization [21]. Here, we also found a
greater number of pet-associated microbial changes in in-
fants born by emergency CS. Recurrent antibiotic expos-
ure or hospitalization may render gut microbiota more
sensitive to colonization by other microbes [55]. It is also
conceivable that pet-induced changes of the maternal
microbiome are transmitted to a greater extent during
labour prior to an emergency CS than in the absence of
labour with scheduled CS.
Our current study has several strengths, including the
application of high-throughput deep sequencing to pro-
file gut microbiota in a longitudinal population cohort,
with a representative and large sample size. Predomin-
ance of Proteobacteria in gut microbiota at 3 months
and its higher prevalence in CS-delivered infants were
consistent with observations in other birth cohorts. Un-
like other studies, our study tested the differential im-
pact of pet exposure according to various birth modes,
with the aim of providing more translational information
for practitioners. Finally, we implemented statistical
modelling and sensitivity analyses to explore whether
observed associations were attributable to confounding
covariates. On the other hand, the use of 16S rRNA se-
quencing in our study may have resulted in under-
representation of organisms such as bifidobacteria. The
sensitivity of this technique also did not allow identifica-
tion at the species level, which is possible with high-
throughput microbial culturomics [56], as well as tar-
geted PCR or phenotypic culturing [57]. Metagenomic
sequencing was not conducted, which would enable
characterization of the functional properties of microbial
changes with pet exposure. Since the majority of house-
holds in our study owned at least one dog, a larger sam-
ple is required to differentiate the effects of different pet
species (e.g. dog and or cat) in future studies.
Conclusions
With increasing ownership of pets in our modern life-
style and reports of their beneficial effects, the question
of pet ownership is becoming a common one for preg-
nant women. Our findings highlighted the differential
impact of pet exposure on infant gut microbiota follow-
ing variant birth scenarios; however, in common, the
abundance of Ruminococcus and Oscillospira were found
to be increased independent of other factors. In addition,
our finding of reduced streptococcal colonization with
prenatal pet ownership may lower the risk for childhood
metabolic and atopic disease. Further research is needed
to link the pet-related microbiota changes with health
outcomes of infants in the CHILD cohort, as well as in
other populations.
