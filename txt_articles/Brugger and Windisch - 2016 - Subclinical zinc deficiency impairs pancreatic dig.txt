Abstract
This study investigated the effects of short-term subclinical Zn deficiency on exocrine pancreatic activity and changes in digestive capacity. A total
of forty-eight weaned piglets were fed ad libitum a basal diet (maize and soyabean meal) with adequate Zn supply (88 mg Zn/kg diet) during a
2-week acclimatisation phase. Animals were then assigned to eight dietary treatment groups (n 6) according to a complete randomised block
design considering litter, live weight and sex. All pigs were fed restrictively (450g diet/d) the basal diet but with varying ZnSO4.7H2O additions,
resulting in 28·1, 33·6, 38·8, 42·7, 47·5, 58·2, 67·8 and 88·0 mg Zn/kg diet for a total experimental period of 8 d. Pancreatic Zn concentrations and
pancreatic activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase A and B, elastase and α-amylase exhibited a broken-line response to stepwise
reduction in dietary Zn by declining beneath thresholds of 39·0, 58·0, 58·0, 41·2, 47·5, 57·7 and 58·0 mg Zn/kg diet, respectively. Furthermore,
carboxypeptidase B and α-amylase activities were significantly lower in samples with reduced pancreatic Zn contents. Coefficients of faecal
digestibility of DM, crude protein, total lipids and crude ash responded similarly to pancreatic enzyme activities by declining below dietary
thresholds of 54·7, 45·0, 46·9 and 58·2 mg Zn/kg diet, respectively. In conclusion, (1) subclinical Zn deficiency impaired pancreatic exocrine
enzymes, (2) this response was connected to pancreatic Zn metabolism and (3) the decline in catalytic activity impaired faecal digestibility
already after 1 week of insufficient alimentary Zn supply and very early before clinical deficiency symptoms arise.
Key words: Digestion: Enzyme activity: Pancreas: Subclinical zinc deficiency: Zinc deficiency
Clinically manifest Zn deficiency in growing individuals is
associated with various unspecific symptoms such as growth
depression, feed refusal and impaired immunity(1), highlighting
the ubiquitous essentiality of this certain trace metal. However,
this phenotype marks the end point in response to long-term
insufficient supply at which the animals’ mobile Zn stores are
exhausted and the homoeostatic regulation is no longer capable
of maintaining a stable equilibrium of body Zn. Moreover,
this physiological state is rare in nature. Most likely, the
predominant Zn malnutrition phenotype in men and animals is
a subclinical deficiency associated with reduction of Zn status
parameters without development of visible symptoms. There-
fore, an experimental approach was recently developed that
induces subclinical Zn deficiency in weaned piglets(2). It has
been shown that Zn status parameters in plasma, bone and liver
respond very sensitively to graduations in analysed dietary Zn
supply. At the same time, no overt signs of Zn deficiency were
evident throughout the entire study. Using this approach, it is
now possible to investigate the early and truly Zn-dependent
metabolic adaptions in the development of a clinically manifest
Zn deficiency.
The pancreas is essential for the regulation of feed digestion
and energy homoeostasis(3). Moreover, significant amounts of
endogenous Zn are secreted via the pancreatic duct into the
gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in order to maintain a basal body Zn
level(4,5). Hence, it can be hypothesised that the regulation of
pancreatic Zn metabolism and exocrine pancreatic digestive
function could be somehow connected. Feed digestion is an
important biological function, especially for growing livestock.
In this context, the first few weeks after weaning are critical
with regard to the maintenance of gut health and integrity(6).
Hence, dietary fluctuations that negatively influence the GIT
have to be avoided. Indeed, there are already reports on
the effects of clinically manifest Zn deficiency on digestive
function(7,8). However, as stated above, these findings may
not be related to Zn homoeostatic adaption but a result of
secondary metabolic imbalances arising in the course of clinical
Zn deficiency. Data on the pancreatic response and related
measures of digestive capacity under subclinical Zn deficiency
are currently scarce.
Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate the
effects of subclinical Zn deficiency on exocrine pancreatic

apparent faecal digestibility of crude nutrients were estimated in
order to monitor the effects on digestive capacity.
Methods
This animal study was registered and approved by the
responsible animal welfare authorities (district government

Upper
Bavaria,

of

(Germany)
(Az. 55·2·1·54-2532·3·63-11).
Animals and diets
The experimental conditions of the present study, including
animal housing conditions, diet design and trial conduction,
have already been published in detail(2). In brief, forty-eight
individually housed weaned piglets from six litters (eight ani-
mals per litter; 50 % castrated male, 50 % female, initial average
body weight 8·5 (SEM 0·27) kg, 28 d of age) were fed a
Zn-adequate (added Zn amount from ZnSO4.7H2O (analytical
grade; Merck 108883; Merck KGaA): +60 mg Zn/kg diet;
analysed dietary Zn content: 88 mg Zn/kg diet) basal diet ad
libitum. The basal diet consisted mainly of maize and soyabean
meal, and was fed for 2 weeks before the study for acclimati-
sation purposes and to ensure full body Zn stores at day 1 of the
experimental period (Table 1). The basal diet met all the
recommendations for sufficient nutrient supply of growing
piglets as published by the National Research Council(9)
(Table 1). Following the acclimatisation period, all animals were
assigned to eight dietary treatment groups according to a
complete randomised block design. Each block represented
eight animals from the same litter (six litters per blocks in total)
consisting of eight castrated male and eight female piglets. An
animal from each block was assigned to one of eight treatment
groups (yielding six animals per treatment group). Thereby, it
was possible to establish a balanced distribution of life weight,
genetics (litter mates) and sex over treatment groups. The total
experimental period consisted of 8 d, during which all treatment
groups received the same basal diet from the acclimatisation
period restrictively (450 g diet/d; all animals consumed the total
amount of feed) but with varying analysed dietary Zn contents
as modulated by varying supplementation with ZnSO4.7H2O
(added Zn amounts: +0, +5, +10, +15, +20, +30, +40, +60 mg
Zn/kg diet; analysed dietary Zn contents: 28·1, 33·6, 38·8, 42·7,
47·5, 58·2, 67·8, 88·0 mg Zn/kg diet). The group receiving
88·0 mg Zn/kg diet was considered to serve as control as it
represented the feeding situation during the acclimatisation
phase, from which the Zn contents of all other groups were
gradually reduced. TiO2 was admixed to all diets (3 g/kg diet) to
serve as an indigestible marker for assessing apparent faecal
crude nutrient digestibility.
Sampling conditions
Feed samples were stored at −20°C in air-tight polyethylene
bottles, whereas faeces samples from the last 3 experimental
days (days 6–8) were pooled animal-wise in plastic bags
and stored at −20°C until freeze-drying before chemical
analyses.
At experimental day 8, all animals were killed without fasting
and the pancreases were removed. Pancreatic samples for the
measurement of enzyme kinetics and tissue Zn contents were
immediately snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80°C until
further use.
Chemical analyses
In order to assess treatment-dependent shifts in digestive
capacity, chemical analyses included Zn, crude nutrient and
TiO2 contents in feed and faeces, pancreatic Zn content as well
as pancreatic exocrine enzyme activities (trypsin, chymotrypsin,
carboxypeptidase A, carboxypeptidase B, elastase, α-amylase).
Total zinc contents. Analyses of total Zn contents in feed, faeces
and pancreatic tissue were performed as described earlier(2)
using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) (novAA 350;

MLS GmbH). Calibration was based on certified AAS standard
solutions (Merck 109953; Merck Millipore).
Contents of DM, crude nutrients and TiO2 in feed and
faeces. DM, crude nutrients and TiO2 in feed and faeces were
assessed by standard procedures(10,11). In brief, all samples
were milled through a 0·5-mm screen before analysis (faeces
samples were freeze-dried before analysis). DM contents were
assessed using 5 g of sample material by re-weighing after
drying with heat (103°C) for 4 h. Crude ash (CA) was deter-
mined in 5 g of sample material by mineralising in platinum
dishes at 550°C for 2 d. Crude protein (CP) contents were
determined using 1 g of sample material according to the
method of Kjeldahl, in which the sample was oxidised with
H2SO4 (1·84 g/ml). After addition of 0·5 M-NaOH, the released
ammonia was measured through titration. In order to estimate
the CP content of the sample, the amount of ammonia-
associated N was multiplied with factor 6·25, assuming aver-
age N contents in protein of 16 %. Total lipid (TL) contents were
analysed in 2·5 g of sample material by treating all samples with
hot 3 M-HCl for 3 h. The remaining solid residue was washed
with double-distilled water, dried (1·5 h, 100°C) and used for
lipid extraction with petroleum diethyl ether for 6 h in the
Soxhlet apparatus. Crude fibre (CF) contents were assessed by
treating 1 g of sample material for 30 min successively with
boiling 0·13 M-H2SO4 and boiling 0·23 M-KOH. The solid residue
was mineralised in Pt dishes at 475°C for 30 min. The difference
between the residue weight and the remaining ash represented
the CF content.
Determination of TiO2 contents was performed by extracting
1 g of sample in a hot solution consisting of 30 ml 96 % H2SO4,
9·75 g K2SO4 and 0·25 g CuSO4.5H2O for 3 h. The supernatant
(10 ml) was treated with 1 ml of an aqueous solution consisting
of 350 µl 96 % H2SO4, 150 µl 85 % H3PO4, 100 µl 35 % H2O2 and
400 µl double-distilled H2O and was incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. The resulting yellow product was measured at
405 nm on the UV MC2 spectrophotometer (SAFAS Scientific
Instruments) using plastic semi-micro cuvettes.
Pancreatic
enzyme
activities.
Pancreatic
tissue
samples
(100 mg frozen sample/animal) were placed in 1-ml, ice-cold
154 mM-NaCl and homogenised using the FastPrep® System
with Matrix Green Beads (MP Biomedicals). The homogenate
was centrifuged at 13 800 g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant
was removed and stored at −80°C until further usage.
The protein concentration within pancreatic tissue lysates
was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay(12). This
information was subsequently used to normalise the respective
enzyme kinetics for the mg content of proteins within the
reaction mix.
Activation of pancreatic trypsinogen to trypsin was per-
formed by in-vitro incubation with exocrine enteropeptidase
(E0885;
Sigma-Aldrich)(13).
All
other
zymogens
(chymo-
trypsinogen, pro-carboxypeptidase A, pro-carboxypeptidase B,
pro-elastase)
were
activated
by
in-vitro
incubation
with
exocrine trypsin (T4549; Sigma-Aldrich)(13–16).
Enzyme kinetics were measured using either ninety-six-well
microplates (Rotilab®-microtest plates; Carl Roth GmbH & Co.
KG) on the LEDETECT 96 system (Deelux Labortechnik GmbH)
(trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase) or quartz cuvettes (carboxy-
peptidase A and B) and plastic semi-micro cuvettes (α-amylase),
respectively, on the UV MC2 spectrophotometer.
Pancreatic enzyme activity was determined colourimetrically by
monitoring the increase in absorption due to hydrolysis of
respective substrates (trypsin: Nα-benzoyl-L-arginine 4-nitroanilide
hydrochloride (B3133; Sigma-Aldrich) to p-nitroaniline at 405nm;
chymotrypsin: N-glutaryl-L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide (G2505;
Sigma-Aldrich) to p-nitroaniline at 405 nm; carboxypeptidase A:
hippuryl-L-phenylalanine to hippuric acid at 254nm; carboxy-
peptidase B: hippuryl-L-arginine to hippuric acid at 254 nm;
elastase:
N-succinyl-ala-ala-ala-p-nitroanilide
(S4760;
Sigma-
Aldrich) to p-nitroaniline at 405 nm; α-amylase: reduction of
3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid by reducing groups of soluble starch
(S9765; Sigma-Aldrich) at 540nm). Enzyme activities were defined
as units (U) per mg protein and minute reaction time (U/mg per
min); 1U represented 1nmol (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase) or
1 µmol (carboxypeptidase A, carboxypeptidase B, α-amylase) of
released product, respectively. Reaction conditions for trypsin,
chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase A, carboxypeptidase B, elastase
and α-amylase were pH 7·8/37°C, pH 7·6/25°C, pH 7·5/25°C,
pH 7·65/25°C, pH 7·9/25°C and pH 6·9/25°C, respectively.
Estimation of apparent faecal digestibility coefficients
for DM and crude nutrients
The percentage apparent faecal digestibility coefficients of
DM, CP, diethyl ether extract (subsequently referred to as
total lipids; TL), CA and CF were calculated on the basis of the
respective ratios of DM and crude nutrients to TiO2 in feeds and
faeces using the following formula:

Statistical analyses
All procedures were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute
Inc.). The individual animal represented the experimental unit.
All assessed parameters were subject to a one-way ANOVA
(independent variables: analysed dietary Zn content with block
as covariate) using the general linear model procedure.
Significantly different treatment means were identified using
the Student–Newman–Keuls test. Furthermore, an orthogonal
contrast was estimated with the function CONTRAST between
the groups with <58 and ≥58 mg Zn/kg diet, in order to
highlight
potential
differences
in
response
between
insufficiently and sufficiently supplied Zn treatment groups.
This threshold was chosen in light of an earlier study in which
the point of sufficient Zn supply under the present experimental
conditions was recognised at 58 mg Zn/kg diet using broken-
line response analysis of apparently digested feed Zn data(2).

 orthogonal contrast between animals with the 50 % lowest
pancreatic Zn contents compared with those with the 50 %
highest Zn contents was calculated.
In order to assess the mathematical relationships between feed
Zn supply and the measured pancreatic and faecal parameters,
broken-line (y= a+bx+cx) regression analysis was conducted
using the procedure NLMIXED (nonlinear mixed model).
A threshold of P ≤ 0·05 was considered as indicator of
statistical significance.
Results
Effects of the dietary treatment on analysed pancreatic zinc
and exocrine pancreatic activity
Table 2 presents the results of one-way ANOVA and orthogonal
contrasting with the data on analysed pancreatic Zn and pan-
creatic enzyme activities relative to dietary Zn supply. Reduc-
tion of dietary Zn supply reduced the analysed pancreatic Zn
contents. The minimum was achieved already at 38·8 mg Zn/kg
diet. Significant differences have been determined between
groups receiving 38·8 and 42·7 mg Zn/kg diet compared with
the
highest
supplied
group
(P = 0·01).
All
other
groups
expressed no significant differences. Orthogonal contrasting
revealed significantly lower pancreatic Zn contents in groups
fed <58 mg Zn/kg diet (P < 0·001). The activity of all investi-
gated pancreatic exocrine enzymes numerically declined with
fine-graded reduction in alimentary Zn supply. This relationship
occurred to be significant for chymotrypsin and α-amylase as
indicated by ANOVA (P = 0·05 and P = 0·01, respectively) and
orthogonal contrasting (P < 0·05 and P < 0·01, respectively) as
well as for elastase based on orthogonal contrasting only
(P = 0·05). However, the Student–Newman–Keuls test was not
able to identify significant differences between treatment
groups, except for α-amylase (significant difference between
groups receiving 33·6 and 38·8 mg Zn/kg diet compared with
the control group receiving 88·0 mg Zn/kg diet).
Table 3 shows the results of broken-line regression analyses
of analysed pancreatic Zn and pancreatic enzyme activities
relative to dietary Zn supply. A highly significant break point in
pancreatic Zn response was evident at 39 mg Zn/kg diet as
indicated by significant parameter estimates for the X and Y
intercept of the break point (P < 0·0001, respectively). After a
significant decrease of 0·41 mg pancreatic Zn/mg dietary Zn
(P < 0·0001) over doses ≥39 mg Zn/kg diet, the behaviour
changed towards a replenishment of pancreatic Zn contents by
0·38 mg/mg dietary Zn at doses ≤39 mg Zn/kg diet. However,
the latter slope in response missed the threshold of statistical
significance. The suitability of the model to explain the
response of pancreatic Zn to dietary Zn was indicated by a high
R2 of 0·92. All investigated pancreatic enzyme activities also
exhibited highly significant break points in parameter response
to variations in dietary Zn levels. This was evident by significant
parameter estimates for the respective X and Y intercepts of the
break points in response to varying dietary Zn supply
(P = 0·0001 and P < 0·0001 for trypsin, P = 0·01 and P < 0·0001
for chymotrypsin, P < 0·0001 and P < 0·0001 for carboxy-
peptidase A, P < 0·0001 and P < 0·0001 for carboxypeptidase B,
P = 0·002 and P < 0·0001 for elastase, P < 0·0001 and P < 0·0001
for α-amylase). Trypsin and α-amylase declined by 2·29 U/mg
per min and 1·92 mU/mg per min per mg reduction in dietary
Zn, respectively, until a break point in response of 58·0 mg
Zn/kg diet. Below this threshold, the slopes in response
decreased to 0·52 U/mg per min and 1·53 mU/mg per min with
every mg further reduction in dietary Zn supply, respectively.
All other assessed enzyme activities exhibited plateaus in
response above the respective dietary thresholds of 58·0, 41·2,
47·5 and 57·7 mg Zn/kg diet for chymotrypsin, carboxy-
peptidases A and B as well as elastase, respectively. Below
these thresholds, a reduction in enzyme activities occurred by
4·69 U/mg per min, 6·50 mU/mg per min, 0·04 U/mg per min
and 1·97 U/mg per min per mg reduction in dietary Zn supply,
respectively. In most cases, the estimated slopes in response
over dietary Zn doses were significant (P = 0·005 for b2 of
trypsin, P = 0·008 for b1 of carboxypeptidase A, P = 0·006 for
b1 of carboxypeptidase B, P = 0·05 and P = 0·03 for b1 and b2 of
α-amylase, respectively) except for b1 of trypsin, chymotrypsin
and elastase, respectively. Estimated broken-line models for
trypsin, carboxypeptidases A and B, elastase as well as
α-amylase were of high precision (R2 0·90, 0·82, 0·63, 0·61, 0·77,
respectively) apart from chymotrypsin (R2 0·35).
Comparing exocrine enzyme activities between animals with the
50% lowest pancreatic Zn contents and their counterparts with the
50% highest pancreatic Zn contents indicated a decline in activity

results were only significant for carboxypeptidase B and α-amylase
(P=0·04 and P=0·03, respectively).
Effects of the dietary treatment on measures
of digestive capacity
Table 4 presents the results of one-way ANOVA and orthogonal
contrasting of apparent faecal digestibility coefficients relative
to changes in dietary Zn supply.
Except for CF (average percentage faecal digestibility: 66·9
(SD 1·64)%, CF data are not further shown in a table), all coeffi-
cients of apparent faecal digestibility exhibited a significant
relationship with the analysed dietary Zn. This was characterised
by a decline in response with fine-graded reduction in alimentary
Zn supply. However, reductions were only significant for

to ANOVA and post hoc testing in all assessed digestibility coeffi-
cients except for CF (P < 0·01, P = 0·01, P < 0·0001 and P < 0·01
for DM, CP, TL and CA, respectively). Orthogonal contrasting
revealed significantly lower faecal digestibility coefficients for
DM, CP, TL and CA in the groups receiving <58 mg Zn/kg diet
(P < 0·001, P < 0·01, P < 0·001 and P < 0·001, respectively). Again,
CF digestibility was not affected in a significant manner.
Table 5 presents results on broken-line regression analysis of
apparent faecal digestibility coefficients relative to dietary Zn
supply. Except for CF digestibility (data not shown), all assessed
parameters
revealed
significant
thresholds
in
parameter
response as indicated by highly significant parameter estimates
of X and Y intercepts of the respective break points (P < 0·0001
for X and Y intercepts of DM, CP, TL and CA, respectively).
Above respective dietary break points of 54·7, 45·0, 46·9 and
58·2 mg Zn/kg diet, DM, CP, TL and CA digestibility coefficients
exhibited a plateau in response to dietary Zn supply. Below
these break points, significant reductions in digestibility by 0·07,
0·18, 0·54 and 0·12 %/mg reduction in dietary Zn were evident
for DM, CP, TL and CA digestibility coefficients, respectively
(P = 0·003, P = 0·006, P = 0·001 and P = 0·002, respectively). All
broken-line models were of high precision as indicated by
R2 values of 0·88, 0·80, 0·90 and 0·74 for DM, CP, TL and CA,
respectively. In the case of faecal CF digestibility, no significant
regression model could have been estimated.
Discussion
Methodological explications
At present, there is a lack of comprehensive data sets regarding
the effects of subclinical Zn deficiency on the organism, as
appropriate experimental approaches to induce this phenotype
are missing. Therefore, an experimental model was recently

 developed to induce fine-graded differences in Zn supply status
of weaned piglets, ranging from deficient states to mild over-
supply (28·1–88 mg Zn/kg diet) under practical feeding condi-
tions(2). The basis of this approach was the short experimental
period of 8 d during which the organism was able to respond to
the insufficient alimentary Zn supply without exceeding its
capacities in terms of bone Zn mobilisation. This time frame has
been chosen on the basis of earlier published data, which stated
that the mammalian Zn homoeostasis needs between 3 and 5 d to
adapt to changes in dietary Zn supply(17,18). Otherwise, the time
during which growing piglets under practical feeding conditions
develop clinically manifest Zn deficiency is approximately
10–12 d from which on the first visible symptoms (e.g. reduced
feed intake) are evident(19–21). Previously published data obtained
under the present experimental conditions clearly indicate fine-
graded differences in the examined Zn supply status parameters
(e.g. bone Zn, blood plasma Zn parameters, etc.) without
promotion of Zn-deficiency symptoms(2). This was evident by
complete absence of any changes in zootechnical performance
data of all experimental groups(2). Moreover, the point of gross
Zn requirement was recognised to lie at 58 mg Zn/kg diet as
indicated by broken-line response analysis of, for example,
apparent Zn digestion(2). This value corresponds to the gross
Zn requirement threshold of growing pigs under practical
feeding conditions as stated by the National Research Council
(60 mg Zn/kg diet)(9).
However, it might be questioned whether an experimental
approach that used restrictive feeding is comparable with an ad
libitum feeding situation. Obviously, too intense feed restric-
tions could cause a stronger depletion of body Zn over time,
and hence might change measurements of the gross Zn
requirement. However, under the present experimental condi-
tions, the level of feed restriction was adapted on the basis of
the average ad libitum feed intake of all animals through the
last 3 d of the acclimatisation period (450 g diet/animal and
day). Thereby, it was possible to adjust the amount of diet
provided per animal and day very closely to the average
amount
consumed
under
non-restrictive
conditions.
The
success of this approach was highlighted by the fact that all
animals were able to fully exploit their potential in terms of
growth development during the experimental phase. Another
possible point of criticism refers to the fact that none of the
administered Zn doses met the recommendations for piglets
within the life weight range monitored in the present investi-
gation (100 mg Zn/kg diet)(9). In light of the considerably long
acclimatisation phase of 2 weeks, one might argue that the
control group (88 mg Zn/kg diet) was insufficiently supplied,
and hence all the animals were challenged with alimentary Zn
deficiency. However, it has to be clearly different between
net/gross Zn requirements and feeding recommendations. The
first represents the amounts of Zn that have to be present
behind the gut barrier and within complete feed, respectively,

 to enable the animal maintenance of its developmental stage
and biological performance (growth, lactation, reproduction,
etc.). The latter is the net/gross Zn requirement extended by a
safety margin, which, in case of weaned piglets, represents a
surplus of approximately 67 % of the gross Zn requirement. This
is a practical tool for pig feeders in order to establish a dietary
Zn content that is always high enough to fulfill the animal’s Zn
demand also in times of higher requirements (e.g. increased
immune activity). The extent of the safety margins is a result of
uncertainties regarding feed Zn bioavailability as data on the
matter are scarce. Given the good biological performance of all
animals throughout the whole study and the response of Zn
status parameters (especially the broken-line response of
apparently digested feed Zn), it leads to the conclusion that five
groups received insufficient alimentary supply (28·1–47·5 mg
Zn/kg diet), and hence expressed fine-graded differences in
the development of subclinical Zn deficiency. In contrast,
the groups receiving ≥58 mg Zn/kg diet were considered as
sufficiently Zn supplied.
Therefore, it is now possible to investigate the early meta-
bolic shifts before the development of clinically manifest Zn
deficiency during which the organism is still capable of com-
pensating deficiency symptoms by mobilisation of body Zn
stores. In a first attempt, the early effects of varying alimentary
Zn supply on the exocrine pancreas and related measures of
digestive capacity have been studied.
Effects of the dietary treatment on exocrine
pancreatic activity
Exocrine proteases are present within the pancreatic tissue as
inactive forms (so-called zymogens) to prevent the tissue from
uncontrolled self-digestion(3). In order to assess the activities of
these enzymes within a pancreatic tissue lysate, in-vitro acti-
vation of zymogens had to be conducted before the enzymatic
assay. The activity of digestive enzymes (activated zymogens as
well as α-amylase) within tissue homogenates should serve as
an indicator of the amount of enzymes within the pancreas. In
the present study, a decline in the respective enzyme activities
within tissue homogenates was evident in response to changes
in dietary Zn supply. These findings are in line with earlier
published data(22–27). Therefore, it can be proposed that one of
the first pancreatic responses during the early states in the
development of Zn deficiency is an increased degradation of
exocrine enzymes and maybe enzyme-containing granules
themselves in order to decline zymogen secretion to reduce
endogenous Zn losses. It has yet to be evaluated whether this is
accompanied by reduced transcription and/or translation of
exocrine enzyme mRNA.
All assessed enzyme activities followed a broken line over
dietary treatment groups, with significant break points in
response between 41·2 and 58 mg Zn/kg diet, below which
their activities declined in a linear fashion. This is in line with
earlier findings under the present experimental conditions
regarding apparent Zn digestion, liver Zn as well as hepatic
metallothionein gene expression(2). On the basis of these
data, the point of gross Zn requirement was estimated to lie
at 58 mg Zn/kg diet. This corresponds precisely to the threshold
of 60 mg Zn/kg diet published by the National Research
Council(9). Therefore, the assessed response patterns of enzyme
activities indicate a relationship between the amount of pan-
creatic zymogens as well as α-amylase and the Zn supply status
of the organism. In summary, a reduction in dietary Zn supply
below the point of gross Zn requirement impaired pancreatic
zymogen and α-amylase activity. Furthermore, this is to our
knowledge the first report of a Zn-dependent regulation of
pancreatic elastase activity.
Response of the analysed pancreatic zinc content and its
potential role as a mediator of exocrine pancreatic activity
Regarding the response of exocrine enzyme activity over the
range of dietary treatment groups, an involvement of Zn
homoeostatic regulation would represent a possible explana-
tion for the basic mode of action. Indeed, in the present study, a
reduction in analysed dietary Zn supply caused a decline in the
response of pancreatic Zn. Furthermore, based on the broken-
line analysis, a replenishment of tissue Zn stores in groups fed
dietary doses <39·9 mg Zn/kg diet was evident. Interestingly,
comparable response patterns regarding the analysed Zn
contents of other tissues (heart, muscle, lymph nodes, thymus)
were observed within the same experiment (D Brugger and
WM Windisch, unpublished results). Furthermore, cardiac stress
metabolism was investigated, and a decrease in antioxidative
capacity accompanied by an increase in stress-responsive pro-
apoptotic gene expression became evident (D Brugger and WM
Windisch, unpublished results). Therefore, replenishment of
certain tissue Zn stores at the expense of body Zn stores in the
lowest supplied groups might represent a compensation
mechanism to counteract increased stress levels in order to
maintain tissue integrity. Indeed, whether comparable adap-
tions with regard to pancreatic stress metabolism are evident
has to be investigated in follow-up studies. In order to prove
whether decreased pancreatic Zn contents had an effect on the
above-discussed measures of exocrine pancreatic enzyme
activity, potential differences in response of enzyme activity
between samples in the range of 50 % higher and 50 % lower
pancreatic Zn contents have been investigated. On the basis of
these secondary statistical analyses, a decrease in pancreatic Zn
load reduced pancreatic enzyme activities. However, con-
siderable variation within the data set was evident by the fact
that only a few enzyme responses to changes in pancreatic Zn
turned out to be statistically significant (carboxypeptidase B, α-
amylase). This might indicate that there was some interference
with other regulative stimuli. It has been shown that the small
intestine communicates with the exocrine pancreas via a
cholecystokinin-dependent signalling in order to increase its
synthesis and secretory activity in times of reduced digestive
capacity – for example, in the presence of enzyme inhibitors
within the GIT(28). Presumably, there is a conflict of interest
between
Zn
homoeostasis-dependent
suppression
and
cholecystokinin-dependent stimulation of exocrine pancreatic
activity. These potential interconnections should be addressed
in appropriate follow-up studies.
Subclinical zinc deficiency impairs digestion

 Effects of the dietary treatment and exocrine pancreatic
activity on measures of digestive capacity
The response of coefficients of apparent faecal digestion of DM,
CP, TL and CA followed a broken line over the whole range of
analysed dietary Zn doses, which is in good context to the
response of pancreatic exocrine enzyme activity. Again, clear
break points in response ranging between 47 and 58 mg Zn/kg
diet were evident. This further confirms clear differences in the
response of animals fed sufficient amounts of dietary Zn
(≥58 mg Zn/kg diet) and insufficiently supplemented diets
(<58 mg Zn/kg diet). Moreover, these findings are in con-
cordance with earlier published results, which suggest a
decrease in apparent feed digestibility under the terms of
clinically manifest Zn deficiency(7,8). The clear relationship with
certain pancreatic enzyme activities suggests a loss in luminal
catalytic activity as a major cause of increased faecal DM and
crude nutrient losses under the terms of short-term subclinical
Zn deficiency. The efficiency by which the feed matrix is
digested within the intestinal lumen determines the amount of
soluble and hence absorbable, nutrients at the gut barrier.
Therefore, impairment of digestive capacity would foster a
translocation of indigested feed components to lower intestinal
segments. Indeed, concerning the TL digestibility, the activity of
pancreatic lipase has not been assayed in the present study, as it
was not possible to establish a suitable method in an appro-
priate amount of time at the laboratory responsible for these
analyses. However, it has been shown that clinically manifest
Zn deficiency can affect pancreatic lipase activity(29). Therefore,
in light of our TL digestibility data, it seems plausible that
pancreatic lipase was affected by the treatment similar to all
other assessed enzymes.
The slope in response of TL digestibility to varying dietary Zn
supply was approximately 3-fold higher compared with CP
digestibility. This might be interpreted as an effect of Zn
metabolism being stronger in case of fat compared with protein.
However, apparent faecal digestibility reflects digestion of
dietary protein only in part as most of faecal CP is of microbial
origin(30). A higher influx of fermentable substrates into the
hindgut
promotes
microbial
growth,
and
hence
reduces
apparent faecal digestibility of CP(31). Reduction in faecal
coefficients of CP digestibility is therefore indicative of impair-
ment of pre-caecal nutrient digestion in general, including
dietary protein and carbohydrates. Therefore, quantifying the
effects of Zn metabolism on digestive capacity requires addi-
tional measurements such as pancreatic lipase activity, bile
secretion, and, most importantly, in vivo experiments addres-
sing pre-caecal (= ileal) digestion.
The reductions in faecal digestibility coefficients, although
statistically significant, are minor in terms of absolute numbers,
and might question the biological significance of the data.
However, it should not be forgotten that these data were evaluated
in animals that were subclinically Zn deficient compared with
animals with satisfied Zn demands. This means that we compared
differences in Zn status and related metabolic response between
healthy animals, as subclinical states are defined by a total absence
of pathological symptoms. Therefore, we did not expect to see
drastic differences in response of certain biological functions. The
monitored shifts in digestive capacity represent early adaptations
that contribute to the development of clinical deficiency on a
mid-term scale. Indeed, based on earlier published data(19–21), we
would expect the assessed differences to increase in the course of
Zn deficiency and to promote the development of digestive
depression.
Clinically manifest Zn deficiency has been associated with
anorexia and decreased growth. The first intention would be to
speculate that feed refusal promotes the reduction in growth
development of Zn-deficient animals. Potential connections
between Zn homoeostasis and leptin signalling, vagus nerve
stimulation as well as reduced ghrelin synthesis/secretion have
been discussed as possible modes of action in order to explain
the anorexia(32–34). However, some authors suggest the growth
depression occurs earlier than the reduction in feed consump-
tion(8,35). This indicates both symptoms develop to some extent
independent of each other in the time course of clinical Zn
deficiency. In the present study, declines in digestive capacity
were evident before the onset of Zn deficiency symptoms.
A decrease in digestive efficiency may lead to an enrichment of
indigested feed within the GIT in the course of Zn deficiency,
thereby establishing a higher filling level and associated
response of mechanoreceptors of the gut. This may be another
plausible explanation for the repeatedly reported Zn deficiency-
associated anorexia. However, as we neither assessed the filling
level of the GIT in the present study nor the response of gas-
trointestinal mechanoreceptors, this hypothesis has to be pro-
ven in further studies.
Conclusion
Significant reductions in exocrine pancreatic enzyme activities
under the terms of subclinical Zn deficiency have been recog-
nised in weaned piglets. Remarkably, these shifts were evident
after just 8 d of insufficient Zn supply under practical feeding
conditions. These effects may be related to pancreatic Zn
metabolism as analysed pancreatic Zn contents were also
affected by the treatment, and the activities of carboxypeptidase
B and α-amylase exhibited a significant reduction in animals
with the 50 % lowest pancreatic Zn contents. Furthermore, the
reduction
in
exocrine
pancreatic
enzyme
activities
was
accompanied by a decrease in faecal digestibility coefficients of
DM, CP, TL and CA, indicating a direct impairment of feed
digestion under the terms of subclinical Zn deficiency. The
practical consequence of the present study is that even short
periods of insufficient alimentary Zn supply have to be urgently
avoided in order to maintain digestive function.
