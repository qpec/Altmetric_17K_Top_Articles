Little is known about the amount and infectiousness of influenza
virus shed into exhaled breath. This contributes to uncertainty
about the importance of airborne influenza transmission. We
screened 355 symptomatic volunteers with acute respiratory illness
and report 142 cases with confirmed influenza infection who pro-
vided 218 paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and 30-minute breath samples
(coarse >5-μm and fine ≤5-μm fractions) on days 1–3 after symptom
onset. We assessed viral RNA copy number for all samples and
cultured NP swabs and fine aerosols. We recovered infectious virus
from 52 (39%) of the fine aerosols and 150 (89%) of the NP swabs
with valid cultures. The geometric mean RNA copy numbers were
3.8 × 104/30-minutes fine-, 1.2 × 104/30-minutes coarse-aerosol
sample, and 8.2 × 108 per NP swab. Fine- and coarse-aerosol viral
RNA were positively associated with body mass index and number
of coughs and negatively associated with increasing days since
symptom onset in adjusted models. Fine-aerosol viral RNA was
also positively associated with having influenza vaccination for both
the current and prior season. NP swab viral RNA was positively
associated with upper respiratory symptoms and negatively asso-
ciated with age but was not significantly associated with fine- or
coarse-aerosol viral RNA or their predictors. Sneezing was rare,
and sneezing and coughing were not necessary for infectious
aerosol generation. Our observations suggest that influenza infec-
tion in the upper and lower airways are compartmentalized and
independent.

T
he nature of infectious contacts and the relative importance
of contact, large-droplet spray, and aerosol (droplet nuclei)
transmission remain controversial (1–6). Nonpharmaceutical
interventions have been employed to control and reduce the
impact of influenza epidemics and pandemics (7). However, to
design effective nonpharmaceutical interventions, it is necessary
to accurately define the relative and absolute contribution of
each route of transmission (8) and implement interventions that
impede those of principal importance.
Mathematical models that have been used to understand and
estimate the contribution of each mode are very sensitive to
estimates of unmeasured parameters (9, 10), such as the viral
load in exhaled breath and coughs and the frequency of sneezing
by influenza cases (8). However, due to limitations inherent to
sampling virus shedding via various routes from infected indi-
viduals, and the difficulty of distinguishing routes of transmission
in observational studies, the quantitative dynamics and relative
contributions of each route remain elusive (4, 8). Recent reports
have shown that infectious influenza virus can be recovered from
exhaled aerosols (11–13). These studies, based on small numbers
of cases or artificial breathing maneuvers, do not provide sufficient
data to quantify the extent of aerosol shedding during natural
breathing, nor do they identify the contributions of spontaneous
coughs and sneezes commonly thought to be the most important
mechanism for viral shedding, or identify other factors that may
impact viral aerosol shedding. We address these key knowledge
gaps by characterizing influenza virus in exhaled breath from
community-acquired influenza cases during natural breathing,
prompted speech, coughing, and sneezing, and assess the in-
fectivity of naturally occurring influenza aerosols.
Results
We screened 355 volunteers with acute respiratory illness; the
178 volunteers who met enrollment criteria provided 278 visits for
sample collection. We confirmed influenza infection in 156 (88%)
of the enrolled participants using qRT-PCR; 152 had at least one
positive nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and 4 (3%) were confirmed
based on positive aerosol samples alone. NP swab analysis was
positive for 8 (33%) of 24 randomly selected volunteers from
among the 177 screened who did not meet enrollment criteria;
thus, sensitivity and specificity of our enrollment criteria, during the
2012–2013 season, were ∼73% [95% confidence interval (CI) 62–
84%] and 84% (95% CI 80–88%), respectively. In the reported
analyses, we excluded 8 visits made on the day of symptom onset,
10 made >3 d after onset, 7 with missing data for cough, and 3 with
Significance
Lack of human data on influenza virus aerosol shedding fuels
debate over the importance of airborne transmission. We
provide overwhelming evidence that humans generate in-
fectious aerosols and quantitative data to improve mathe-
matical models of transmission and public health interventions.
We show that sneezing is rare and not important for—and that
coughing is not required for—influenza virus aerosolization.
Our findings, that upper and lower airway infection are inde-
pendent and that fine-particle exhaled aerosols reflect infection
in the lung, opened a pathway for a deeper understanding of
the human biology of influenza infection and transmission. Our
observation of an association between repeated vaccination and
increased viral aerosol generation demonstrated the power of
our method, but needs confirmation.

 incomplete qRT-PCR data (Fig. S1 and Table S1). The resulting
dataset for confirmed cases with complete data on RNA copies,
cough, and symptoms included 218 visits by 142 cases: 89 influenza
A (83 H3, 3 pdmH1, 3 unsubtypable), 50 influenza B, and 3 dual
influenza infection cases.
Our study population (Table 1) consisted mostly of young
adults (19–21 y) with a high asthma prevalence (21%), normal
body mass index (BMI, median = 22.7; 7% underweight, 20%
overweight, and 8% obese) (Table S2), and a low self-reported
influenza vaccination rate (22%). We observed at least one
cough during 195 (89%) and one or more sneezes during 11
(5%) of the 218 visits. Cough frequency varied considerably,
from 5 per 30 min at the 25th percentile to 39 per 30 min at the
75th. Most volunteers rated their upper respiratory symptoms as
mild to moderate, systemic symptoms as moderate to severe, and
lower respiratory symptoms as mild (Fig. 1).
Infectious virus was recovered from 52 (39%) fine-aerosol
samples and 150 (89%) NP swabs (Table 2). Quantitative cul-
tures were positive for 30% of the fine-aerosol samples, with a
geometric mean (GM) for positive samples of 37 fluorescent focus
units (FFU) per 30-min sample (Fig. 2A) and for 62% of NP swabs
with GM for positive samples of 2,500. Using Tobit analysis to
adjust the estimate of the GM for the presence of samples below
the limit of detection, we obtained a GM 1.6 (95% CI 0.7–3.5) for
fine aerosols and a GM 60.6 (95% CI 22.7–1.6 × 102) for
NP swabs.
Influenza virus RNA was detected in 76% of the fine-aerosol
samples, 40% of the coarse-aerosol samples, and 97% of the NP
swabs of enrolled volunteers. For the positive samples, the GM
viral RNA content of fine-aerosol samples was 3.8 × 104, for
coarse aerosols was 1.2 × 104, and for NP swabs was 8.2 × 108
(Fig. 2B). The adjusted GMs were 1.2 × 104 (95% CI 7.0 × 103 to
1.9 × 104) for fine aerosols and 6.0 × 102 (95% CI 3.0 × 102 to
1.2 × 103) for coarse aerosols. Quantitative culture was corre-
lated with RNA copies in both NP swabs (Fig. 2C) (r = 0.58) and
fine aerosols (Fig. 2D) (r = 0.34). The time course of shedding is
shown in Fig. 2E.
Viral RNA in NP swabs was not correlated with cough fre-
quency (number of coughs per 30 min) (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2A)
(r = 0.02). Viral RNA in coarse aerosols was weakly correlated
with cough frequency (Fig. 2G and Fig. S2B) (r = 0.24). How-
ever, viral RNA copy number in fine aerosols was moderately
well correlated with cough frequency (Fig. 2H and Fig. S2C) (r =
0.45). Only 3 (13%) of 23 coarse-aerosol samples where no
coughs were observed had detectable viral RNA, while 11 (48%)
of the corresponding 23 fine-aerosol samples had detectable viral
RNA and 8 were positive by culture. RNA copies in the fine-
aerosol, no-cough samples ranged up to 3.7 × 105 (adjusted GM

 1.5 × 103, 95% CI 4.2 × 102 to 5.3 × 103) and infectious virus to
1.4 × 102 FFU per 30-min sample. The few sneezes observed
were not associated with greater RNA copy numbers in either
coarse or fine aerosols (Fig. S3).
Results of regression analyses to identify predictors of viral
RNA shedding are shown in Table 3, controlled for random
effects of subject and repeated observations on individuals.
The day after symptom onset (comparing day 1 postonset with
days 2 and 3) was associated with a significant decline in viral
RNA shed into fine aerosols (P < 0.05 for day 2 and P < 0.01 for
day 3 in adjusted models), a borderline significant decline in
coarse-aerosol shedding (P < 0.10), and was not associated with
a significant change in shedding detected in NP swabs (P > 0.10).
In regression analyses, cough frequency was significantly as-
sociated with increased fine- (P < 0.001 to <0.0001) and coarse-
(P < 0.01) aerosol shedding, but was not associated with NP
shedding. Fine-aerosol shedding was significantly greater for
males. Analysis of an interaction of cough with sex indicated
that males produced, on average, 3.2 times more virus than did
females per cough. However, females also coughed significantly
(P = 0.005) more frequently than males: 33 (SD 39) per 30-min
observation and 21 (SD 21), respectively (Fig. S4).
BMI was positively associated with shedding in fine and coarse
aerosols in unadjusted models (P < 0.10). BMI was retained in
the best-fitting adjusted models for both fine and coarse aero-
sols, where it was significantly associated with fine-aerosol
shedding (P < 0.05). However, BMI was not associated with
shedding detected in NP swabs (P > 0.10). Standard categories of
BMI were not as good a fit as the continuous BMI and were not
significantly associated with shedding (Table S3), although a
positive trend is evident for overweight and obese individuals in
the adjusted model.
Self-reported vaccination for the current season was associ-
ated with a trend (P < 0.10) toward higher viral shedding in fine-
aerosol samples; vaccination with both the current and previous
year’s seasonal vaccines, however, was significantly associated
with greater fine-aerosol shedding in unadjusted and adjusted
models (P < 0.01). In adjusted models, we observed 6.3 (95% CI
1.9–21.5) times more aerosol shedding among cases with vacci-
nation in the current and previous season compared with having
no vaccination in those two seasons. Vaccination was not associated
with coarse-aerosol or NP shedding (P > 0.10). The association of

 vaccination and shedding was significant for influenza A (P = 0.03)
but not for influenza B (P = 0.83) infections (Table S4).
Viral load in NP swabs was not a significant predictor of aerosol
shedding (P = 0.16 for fine and P = 0.48 for coarse aerosols).
Temperature measured at the time of sampling, asthma history,
smoking, and influenza type were not significantly associated with
the extent of measured shedding. While self-reported symptoms
were not associated with aerosol shedding, they were significantly
associated with shedding measured by the NP swab; only upper
respiratory symptoms remained significant when adjusted for other
symptoms and age. Increasing age was associated with a significant
decrease in shedding in the NP swab; however, age was not asso-
ciated with aerosol shedding.
Discussion
We recovered infectious influenza virus from 52 samples of fine
aerosols collected from exhaled breath and spontaneous coughs
produced by 142 cases of symptomatic influenza infection during
218 clinic visits. Finding infectious virus in 39% of fine-aerosol
samples collected during 30 min of normal tidal breathing in a
large community-based study of confirmed influenza infection
clearly establishes that a significant fraction of influenza cases
routinely shed infectious virus, not merely detectable RNA, into
aerosol particles small enough to remain suspended in air and
present a risk for airborne transmission. Because these data were
collected without volunteers having to breathe through a mouth-
piece or perform forced coughs, they allow us to provide estimates
of average shedding rates, variability, and time course of and risk
factors for shedding that can be used to provide well-grounded
parameter estimates in future models of the risk of airborne in-
fluenza transmission from people with symptomatic illness.
The first published estimates of the numbers of influenza virus
variants transmitted from donor to recipient host indicated that
the bottleneck for transmission between humans is fairly wide
and highly variable (mean 192 with 95% confidence 66–392) (14,
15). Our observation that cases shed considerable quantities of
virus into aerosols, GM >104 RNA copies per 30 min, and up to
103 infectious virus particles per 30 min, suggests that large
numbers of variants could be transmitted via aerosols, especially
via the short-range mode (16). However, longer-range aerosol
transmission, as might be observed in less-crowded environments
than in the initial report from Hong Kong, would be expected to
usually result in lower exposures and transmission of fewer var-
iants, consistent with the narrower bottleneck described in ferret
models (17, 18).
Sobel Leonard et al. (14) suggested that the width of the
bottleneck increased with severity of illness, as indicated by a
borderline significant positive association between temperature
and number of variants transmitted. We did not see a significant
association between measured temperature and shedding by any
route. In contrast, symptoms were not a significant predictor of
bottleneck size, and in our data, symptoms were not significant
predictors for shedding into aerosols. Symptoms were, however,
significant predictors for nasal shedding as measured in NP swabs.
Thus, if aerosols were the more important route of transmission,
our observations would be consistent with the currently available
bottleneck analysis.
We observed that influenza cases rarely sneezed, despite
having just undergone two NP swab collections (a procedure that

 generally makes one feel an urge to sneeze). Sneezing was not
observed in the absence of cough and was not associated with
greater aerosol shedding than we observed with cough alone
(Fig. S3). Thus, sneezing does not appear to make an important
contribution to influenza virus shedding in aerosols. Sneezing
might make a contribution to surface contamination. Because
sneezes generate considerable amounts of large-droplet spray
composed of many ballistic droplets not collected by our sam-
pler, we cannot assess that possibility with our data.
Cough was prevalent and was a strong predictor of virus
shedding into both coarse and fine aerosols. However, cough was
not necessary for infectious aerosol generation in the ≤5-μm (fine)
aerosol fraction; we detected culturable virus in fine aerosols
during 48% of sampling sessions when no coughs were observed.
This suggests that exhaled droplets, generated by mechanisms
other than cough, are responsible for a portion of the viral load
observed in the fine-aerosol fraction. Several researchers have re-
cently shown that exhaled aerosol particles are frequently gener-
ated from normal healthy lungs by small airway closure and
reopening (19–21). It has been hypothesized that during respiratory
infections, airway closure and reopening frequency would be in-
creased due to inflammation with a commensurate increase in
aerosol generation and contagiousness (22).
Cough is thought to produce aerosols from large airways by
shear forces that produce relatively coarse-aerosol droplets (23).
Our finding that only 13% of cases not observed to have coughed
during sample collection produced detectable viral RNA in their
coarse aerosols is consistent with that hypothesis. The remaining
aerosols may have resulted from speaking; each subject was re-
quired to recite the alphabet three times. One might expect that
viral replication in the large airways combined with cough-
generated coarse-aerosol droplets would produce the majority
of viral aerosols. However, we observed a weak correlation of
coarse-aerosol RNA copy number with cough frequency and a
much stronger association of fine-aerosol copy number with
cough frequency, even though cough would be expected to be the
primary source of coarse aerosols. These observations suggest
that cough is, at least in part, an epiphenomenon, more of a
response to irritation associated with high viral loads in distal
airways than a direct source of infectious aerosols.
A striking finding was the association of gender with shedding
into fine aerosols. This relationship appears to have resulted
from a threefold greater impact of coughing on shedding in males.
We observed these gender and gender-by-cough interaction effects
only for the fine-aerosol fraction. Absence of a gender effect in the
coarse-aerosol fraction suggests that this is not an effect of cough
on aerosol generation by shear forces in the upper airway. We did
not measure lung volumes and therefore cannot control for a lung
size effect. An equally plausible explanation may be that women
tend to have more sensitive cough reflexes (24). Thus, women may
have tended to cough in response to lower viral loads and coughed
more frequently at a given viral load, which could have produced
the observed steeper slope of viral load regressed on cough fre-
quency in males compared with females. Consistent with this sug-
gestion, we did observe a significantly greater cough frequency in
females (P = 0.005) and a steeper slope of fine-aerosol viral RNA
with cough in males (Fig. S4).
BMI was a borderline significant predictor of aerosol shedding
in most models, was retained as an important predictor of both
coarse and fine aerosols in adjusted models, and reached sta-
tistical significance for fine aerosols when adjusted for other
factors; it was not a significant predictor of nasal shedding. This
observation might be consistent with reports of increased in-
flammation in models of obesity and influenza and severity of
influenza-like illness in obese persons (25–30). Alternatively,
increasing BMI is associated with increased frequency of small
airways closure, and the resulting increased aerosol generation
during airway reopening as described above may explain the stronger
association of BMI with fine than coarse aerosols and lack of asso-
ciation with NP swabs (31).
Our analysis found a clear separation of factors associated
with shedding from the nose and those with shedding into
aerosols, especially fine-particle aerosols. Upper airway symp-
toms, as would be expected, were strongly associated with
shedding detected in NP swabs, and greatly reduced the size and
significance of lower respiratory and systemic symptoms in the
fully adjusted model. Age was negatively associated with nasal
shedding but not a predictor of aerosol shedding. More sur-
prisingly, no symptoms, including lower respiratory and systemic
systems, were strongly associated with shedding into aerosols, in
this population with relatively mild lower respiratory symptoms
(Fig. 1). Furthermore, nasal shedding was not a significant pre-
dictor of aerosol shedding and none of the strong predictors of
aerosol shedding were associated with nasal shedding. Thus, we
can conclude that the head airways made a negligible contribu-
tion to viral aerosol generation and that viral aerosols represent
infection in the lung. Moreover, upper and lower airway infection
appear to behave as though infection is compartmentalized and
independent. In this context, it is notable that Varble et al. (18)
observed that intrahost viral variants differ in the nasopharynx
and lung of ferrets.
We did not observe a significant decline over time of viral load
detected in NP swabs. If day 1 after onset of symptoms (used as
baseline for these analyses) in our cases was equivalent to a
mixture of day 1 and day 2 after experimental influenza virus
inoculation in the report by Hayden et al. (32), then our lack of
finding a clear drop in nasal shedding over the next 2 d is rea-
sonably consistent with the pattern reported for experimental
infection. There is no available data for comparison of aerosol
shedding from published experimental infections. That we saw a
much clearer pattern of rapid decline over time in aerosol
shedding again suggests a separation of infection into upper and
lower airway compartments in humans.
The association of current and prior year vaccination with
increased shedding of influenza A might lead one to speculate
that certain types of prior immunity promote lung inflammation,
airway closure, and aerosol generation. This first observation of
the phenomenon needs confirmation. If confirmed, this obser-
vation, together with recent literature suggesting reduced pro-
tection with annual vaccination, would have implications for
influenza vaccination recommendations and policies.
Materials and Methods
Study Population and Sample Collection Procedures. We recruited volunteers
with acute respiratory illness on the University of Maryland–College Park campus
and surrounding community from December 2012 through March 2013. The
University of Maryland Institutional Review Board approved the study, and we
obtained a signed consent (or assent and parental verbal assent) from volun-
teers who reported fever with a cough or sore throat (Fig. S5).
During the initial visit, we administered a brief screening questionnaire,
measured oral temperature, height, weight, and collected two NP swabs
(Copan) for each volunteer screened. One swab was used to perform
QuickVue A/B rapid tests for influenza (except when results of a rapid test
performed by medical provider were available). The second NP swab was used
for viral culture and PCR for those meeting enrollment criteria and for PCR in
a random sample of 24 of those not enrolled.
Participants were asked about sex, age, antipyretic use, vaccination status,
use of steroid medications, medical and smoking history, to rate current
symptoms on a four-level scale (none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, severe = 3),
and to rate the worst symptoms during the illness thus far. We defined
symptoms as upper respiratory (runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, sore
throat, and earache), lower respiratory (chest tightness, shortness of breath,
and cough), and systemic (malaise, headache, muscle/joint ache, fever/sweats/
chills, and swollen lymph nodes).
Volunteers were enrolled in exhaled breath collection if they met the fol-
lowing criteria: (i) positive QuickVue rapid test, or oral temperature >37.8 °C
plus cough or sore throat, and (ii) presented within the first 3 d of symptom
onset. Exhaled breath samples were collected using the Gesundheit-II (G-II)

 human source bioaerosol sampler, as previously described (12, 33). We collected
exhaled breath for 30 min while the participant was seated with their face
inside of the large open end of a cone-shaped inlet for the G-II. The inlet cone
draws in 130 L of air per minute and allowed participants to breathe, talk,
cough, and sneeze naturally throughout sample collection while maintain-
ing >90% collection efficiency for exhaled and coughed droplets ≤100 μm.
Subjects were asked to breathe normally and to recite the alphabet once at 5,
15, and 25 min. We collected “coarse” (>5 μm) aerosol droplets by impaction on
a Teflon surface and “fine” droplets (≤5 μm and >0.05 μm) by condensation
growth and impaction on a steel surface constantly rinsed into a buffer con-
taining (PBS with 0.1% BSA) liquid reservoir. Audible spontaneous coughs and
sneezes during breath collection were counted by direct observation in real-
time (n = 59) or by playback of digital recordings (n = 159).
Participants enrolled before the third day after symptom onset were asked
to come in for up to two consecutive daily follow-up visits (Fig. S5) with
repeat questionnaire, NP swab, and exhaled breath collections. Final anal-
yses included only visits for enrolled cases occurring on days 1–3 after
symptom onset with complete data on cough and sneeze, symptoms, PCR
results for swab and aerosol samples.
Laboratory Methods. Detailed methods are described in the SI Materials and
Methods. Briefly, NP swabs were eluted in 1 mL of PBS with 0.1% BSA (PBS/
0.1% BSA) or universal transport medium (Copan), and Teflon impactors
were scrubbed with a nylon swab saturated with PBS/0.1% BSA. The swab
was eluted in 1 mL PBS/0.1% BSA. Fine-aerosol samples were concentrated
to 1 mL using centrifugal ultrafiltration.
RNA was extracted from NP swab, fine- and course-aerosol samples, and
whole-virion standards using an automated Qiagen system and viral RNA was
quantified by one-step real-time RT-PCR using Taqman primer probe sets
designed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and made
available through our cooperative agreement. Standard curves were cali-
brated for virus copy number using plasmids containing a cDNA copy of the
qRT-PCR target amplicon. Experimentally determined limits of detection and
quantification for each of the qRT-PCR reactions are shown in Table S5.
Virus culture on Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was used to
detect infectious virus in NP swab and fine-aerosol samples. Coarse-aerosol
samples were not cultured for infectious virus because impaction on a dry
Teflon surface was expected to reduce infectivity of those samples. In-
fectious influenza virus was quantified using an immunofluorescence assay
for influenza nucleoprotein, and positive cells were counted as FFU by
fluorescence microscopy. Details of laboratory methods can be found in SI
Materials and Methods.
Statistical Analysis. We entered and cleaned data using locally hosted REDCap
data-capture tools (34) and performed data management and analyses in R
(v3.2.3 R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and SAS (v9.4, Cary, NC),
and produced graphics with Prism Software (PRISM software v7.0; Graph-
Pad). We used the delta method to estimate confidence limits for sensitivity
and specificity. We used Spearman correlation, generalized linear models
(SAS Proc GENMOD), and Tobit regression (35) with nested random effects
of sample within subject in (SAS Proc NLMIXED) to analyze infectious virus
counts, RNA copy numbers, and compute GM virus concentrations. Tobit
regression accounted for uncertainty and censoring of the observations by
the limit of quantification. We included all independent variables with un-
adjusted P < 0.10 in initial adjusted models and selected final models using
the Akaike information criterion while retaining adjustment for age and sex.
Regression model results are presented as the ratio of shedding at the 75th
percentile to shedding at the 25th percentile of the distribution of the in-
dependent variable, so that clinical and epidemiological meaning of the
relationship can be more easily interpreted.
