Abstract
Objective. While efficacy of massage and other non-
pharmacological treatments for chronic low back
pain is established, stakeholders have called for
pragmatic studies of effectiveness in “real-world”
primary health care. The Kentucky Pain Research
and Outcomes Study evaluated massage impact on
pain, disability, and health-related quality of life for
primary care patients with chronic low back pain.
We report effectiveness and feasibility results, and
make comparisons with established minimal clini-
cally important differences.
Methods. Primary care providers referred eligible
patients for 10 massage sessions with community
practicing licensed massage therapists. Oswestry
Disability Index and SF-36v2 measures obtained
at baseline and postintervention at 12 and 24 weeks
were analyzed with mixed linear models and Tukey’s
tests.
Additional
analyses
examined
clinically
significant
improvement
and
predictive
patient
characteristics.
Results. Of 104 enrolled patients, 85 and 76 com-
pleted 12 and 24 weeks of data collection, respec-
tively. Group means improved at 12 weeks for all
outcomes and at 24 weeks for SF-36v2’s Physical
Component Summary and Bodily Pain Domain.
Of those with clinically improved disability at 12
weeks, 75% were still clinically improved at 24
weeks (P < 0.01). For SF-36v2 Physical and Mental
Component Summaries, 55.4% and 43.4%, respec-
tively, showed clinically meaningful improvement at
12 weeks, 46.1% and 30.3% at 24 weeks. For Bodily
Pain Domain, 49.4% were clinically improved at 12
weeks, 40% at 24 weeks. Adults older than age 49
years had better pain and disability outcomes than
younger adults.
Conclusions. Results provide a meaningful signal
of massage effect for primary care patients with
chronic low back pain and call for further research
in practice settings using pragmatic designs with
control groups.

 Introduction
Low back pain is a prevalent health condition that leads
all disorders in years lost to disability in the United States
[1]. While most patients improve rapidly [2], one-third re-
port persistent back pain [3] and 15% develop chronic
low back pain (CLBP) with significant physical limitations
[4]. Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and sys-
tematic reviews have found clinical massage therapy to
have efficacy for CLBP [5–10]. Clinical massage therapy
refers to massage applied and practiced by trained mas-
sage professionals and delivered within a professional
and therapeutic setting to support optimal health and
functioning. The most recent and comprehensive low
back pain treatment guidelines (2007) recommend mas-
sage specifically for CLBP [11,12], noting its “proven ben-
efits” [12]. However, a recent meta-analysis [13] highlights
methodological weaknesses in massage research, and
CLBP treatment guideline authors [11,12] and others [14]
have expressed concern that massage effectiveness has
not been evaluated in primary care. For example, mas-
sage is rarely integrated into primary care, limiting the
potential for interdisciplinary awareness, knowledge, or
communication between the fields. In the event that
health care providers recommend patients to massage,
the likelihood of them knowing the massage therapist or
practice-specific patients accessed would be low. The ex-
tent to which massage treatments applied in real-world
settings replicates those examined in controlled research
settings would also be reasonably unknown to health care
providers. Research designs reflective of real-world prac-
tice situations (of both primary care and massage applica-
tion) are needed for CLBP stakeholders to understand the
extent to which patients will benefit from massage if rec-
ommended by their primary care provider (PCP).
This report details outcomes of the Kentucky Pain
Research and Outcomes Study (KYPROS). KYPROS
was selected by a National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funding opportunity specifically designated for pragmatic
studies
using
practice-based
research
networks
(PBRNs) [15]. With a focus on pilot and pragmatic re-
search, the funding opportunity announcement consid-
ered applications with control groups as nonresponsive
[15]. Thus, this study does not employ a control group.
As a pilot and feasibility study, KYPROS was designed
and powered to detect and descriptively compare out-
comes to established, minimal clinically important differ-
ences as a means to determine if real-world massage
could produce a meaningful benefit signal for CLBP pa-
tients referred by their PCP. A secondary aim of
KYPROS
was
to
examine
study
design
feasibility.
KYPROS provided participants with cost-free access to
10 massage treatments provided by licensed massage
therapists practicing in their community with five or
more
years
of
experience.
We
expected
KYPROS
participants would be satisfied with massage for their
CLBP and report benefit from provided treatment. Our
primary aim was to evaluate health-related outcomes
of
real-world
massage
for
CLBP
compared
with
established minimal clinically important differences for
our measures of interest: pain with disability and health-
related quality of life.
Methods
The University of Kentucky’s Office of Research Integrity
provided ethical review and approval (#09-0687-FIV) for
KYPROS. Written informed consent was collected from
all participants.
Study Design
KYPROS was a repeated measures cohort study (clini-
caltrials.gov registration # NCT01147120). It had no
comparison group focused on feasibility and outcomes
(Figure 1) in urban and rural central Kentucky counties of
the Kentucky Ambulatory Network, a large, statewide
practice-based research network. Evaluation of out-
comes was based on statistically significant change from
baseline and recommended methodology [16], applying
nonstatistical comparisons of outcomes for achievement
of identified clinically meaningful changes. We report pa-
tient data from three data collection time points: Visit 1
(V1) at baseline, Visit 2 (V2) at 12 weeks (immediately fol-
lowing course of treatment), and Visit 3 (V3) at 24 weeks
(12-week follow-up from course of treatment).
Study Participants
All CLBP patients enrolled in KYPROS were referred by
their PCP, which ultimately led to two study participant
groups: referring PCPs and CLBP patients.
Referring Primary Care Providers
We randomly selected from Kentucky Ambulatory Network
practice locations then serially invited PCPs from 18 prac-
tices (14 being group practices) to refer patients into our
study. Practice locations included four rural sites (all group
practices) and one major academic medical facility. The
study team visited each practice to orient the PCPs and
staff, including a 20-minute discussion of massage along
with risks and benefits. PCPs who consented to participate
were asked to: 1) complete and return a point-of-care
pocket card for each patient with CLBP they saw in their
practice for any reason during their study participation win-
dow and 2) refer eligible patients to the study if they thought
the study intervention would be of benefit. PCPs were in-
structed to document their referral on the pocket card, add
patient contact information if the patient agreed, and return
pocket cards to study personnel weekly. Study personnel
contacted patients to explain the study, confirm eligibility,
answer questions, and schedule an informed consent/
baseline study visit.

 Patient Participants
CLBP patients were eligible for referral if having a PCP
visit for any reason during their PCP’s participation win-
dow. CLBP was defined as pain in the lumbar or sacral
regions persisting for three months or longer. Table 1
outlines full exclusion/inclusion criteria. Participants re-
ceived a $25 gift card after each data collection point
was completed.
Massage Intervention and Providers
Participants referred and enrolled into the study were
each assigned to a KYPROS-affiliated massage therapist.
KYPROS protocol stipulated that study massage thera-
pists schedule, develop treatment plans, and apply 10
massage treatments during the 12 weeks between study
V1 and V2 for study participants. Study therapists pro-
vided treatments at no cost to study participants and

 were compensated $25 per completed massage session.
Details of KYPROS massage therapists are described
elsewhere [17], but, briefly, assignment was informed by
participant convenience to therapist practice location and
distribution. All KYPROS-affiliated massage therapists
were licensed in Kentucky, had to have at least five years
of professional experience, provide treatment space and
supplies, complete study personnel training, and com-
plete and submit treatment documentation forms specific
to KYPROS. Study massage therapists scheduled visits,
provided treatments in their usual treatment setting, and
utilized any massage technique within the purview of their
training experience. Techniques included: Swedish mas-
sage, active isolated stretching, myofascial techniques,
lymphatic drainage, movement, trigger point therapy,
neuromuscular therapy, cranialsacral therapy, reflexology,
Reiki, acupressure, and positional release. Included tech-
niques represent those typically taught in foundation mas-
sage education (i.e., Swedish massage; the United States
has no consistent massage training parameters with re-
gards to duration of training or necessary content taught,
although efforts to establish such parameters exist among
professional organizations), as well as those inconsistently
taught in foundation massage education but taught in
continuing education (most professional massage certifi-
cations and licensures maintain continuing education re-
quirements for renewal) or advanced/specialized training
settings (e.g., cranialsacral therapy, lymphatic drainage,
Reiki, trigger point).
Measures
Patient Descriptors
Patient descriptors were collected from both PCPs (via
pocket cards) and patients (via self-report). Descriptor
variables included: PCP reported/perceived health, pain
severity, function ability, and pain-related medications
(categorized
as
pain-specific,
muscle
relaxers,
and
mood-specific); patient age, gender, race, body mass
index (BMI), CLBP duration, education, and means of
health care payment. Three medication-related variables
were created from PCP-provided medication lists: 1)
total
number
of
pain-related
medications
reported
(continuous), 2) dichotomous US Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) scheduled medications usage (i.e.,
opioids, benzodiazepines, and Tramadol), and 3) total
number of reported scheduled medications (continuous).
A dichotomous age variable was created to better con-
sider age-related differences between younger and older
study participants. We rounded the average sample age
to determine the dichotomous cut-point (50 years),
which also happened to neatly divide the sample be-
tween the established Baby Boomer and X generations.
Outcomes
Primary outcome measures were the Oswestry Disability
Index (ODI) [18] and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-
Item Short Form, version 2 (SF-36v2) [19]. The ODI is a
frequently used condition-specific measure for pain with
disability [20]. Examination of internal consistency yields
Cronbach’s
alphas
between
0.71
and
0.87
[21].
Researchers have found that ODI scores of 12 and
higher indicate pain with disability in the Japanese pop-
ulation (a country with a higher population age, lower
obesity rates, and better population health than the
United States) [22] and changes of six points or more
are clinically meaningful (group means and for individ-
uals) [21,23]. Sample size was sufficient to detect such
change with greater than 90% power. The SF-36v2 is a
widely used and validated 36-item patient questionnaire
to assess health-related quality of life. It includes eight
health
domains
and
yields
two
summary
scales.
Dimensions of interest from the SF-36v2 were the
Physical Component Summary, the Mental Component
Summary, and the Bodily Pain Domain.
Table 2 displays specific point change thresholds showing
clinically meaningful improvement for the ODI and SF-
36v2 Physical Component Summary, Mental Component
Summary, and Bodily Pain Domain when considering
group means and individual change scores [19]. Based
on
V1/V2
and
V1/V3
change
scores,
dichotomous
success variables were calculated for each participant to
signify whether clinically meaningful change occurred in
each of the measures [19,23].
Participant satisfaction and perceived treatment effects
can be used to judge whether delivery of the intervention
is complete and acceptable [24]; thus they are important

 low back pain measure domains [25]. KYPROS measured
perceived treatment effects and satisfaction in two ways.
At V2 and V3, an 11-point numeric scale was used for
the question “How helpful do you believe this therapy was
for your chronic low back pain?”, with 0 ¼ “not at all help-
ful” and 10¼ “extremely helpful.” This variable was treated
as continuous. At V2, participants completed a satisfaction
survey that used a seven-point Likert scale for the extent
to which participants agreed with statements such as
“This therapy relieved my pain.” Dichotomous positive sat-
isfaction and perceived effectiveness variables were cre-
ated for each question that combined responses of
“strongly agree” and “very strongly agree,” as recom-
mended by Ostelo and de Vet [25].
Data Collection, Management, and Analysis
Data were collected at V1, V2, and V3 with paper and
pencil surveys either on the University of Kentucky cam-
pus or in a neutral, participant-convenient place where
relative privacy could be provided (most often a public li-
brary). Study data were double-entered by research as-
sistants into and managed using Research Electronic
Data Capture (REDCap) [26], a secure, web-based ap-
plication designed to support data capture for research
studies, providing an intuitive interface for data entry,
audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export,
and automated export procedures. Participants did not
interact with REDCap in any way, nor were the com-
pleted surveys printed from REDCap.
Statistical analyses used SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA). Comparisons of baseline variables were
made for loss to follow-up status at V2 and V3 using
chi-square tests for categorical variables and t tests for
continuous variables. This study was powered to detect
a six-point change in mean ODI, which constitutes
meaningful clinical change [21,27]. Our main analyses
were completed in two steps. Step 1: Mean changes
were examined for each primary outcome (ODI and per-
tinent SF-36v2 components/domains) using repeated
measures (time: V1, V2, V3) mixed linear models and
Tukey’s post hoc tests. Step 2: Where Step 1 analysis
indicated that significant outcomes changes occurred,
descriptive analyses examined the extent of clinically
significant improvement and exploratory Spearman cor-
relations, chi-square, odds ratio, and logistical regres-
sion analyses identified predictive patient characteristics.
Large numbers of PCPs (N ¼ 67) and practices (N ¼ 18),
relative to number of referred patients (N ¼ 177), obvi-
ated the use of practice as a variable in analyses.
Results
Sixty-seven urban and rural (N ¼ 14) PCPs from 18 provider
sites (rural ¼ 4) consented to participate in the study, with
one to 25 PCPs participating from each site (median¼ 2).
Forty-eight PCPs returned pocket cards for 177 recommen-
dations to massage. Of the recommended 177 CLBP
patients, 151 (81%) were interested in being contacted by
study personnel. One-hundred four (69%) patients enrolled
and completed baseline measures (N¼ 104).
Sixty percent of participants completed all 10 massage
treatments and 75% received at least five treatments.
No adverse events were attributed to the study. Three
complaints about massage therapists were recorded
(personality/belief conflicts): Two participants were reas-
signed to a different massage therapist, and the third is-
sue was resolved by notifying the massage therapist of
patient concerns [17].
Baseline Measures and Attrition
To limit rates of participants lost to follow-up, data col-
lection at V2 and V3 was vigorously pursued for all
study participants regardless of the extent to which
treatments were accessed. Of the 104 participants, 85
completed V2 (18% attrition) and 76 completed V3
(27% attrition). Baseline measures for study participants
are reported in Table 3. Those lost to follow-up at V2
had a higher mean number of PCP-reported pain-re-
lated prescriptions (2.9 61.7 vs 2.1 6 1.4, P ¼ 0.03),
had a lower mean age (38 years 6 9.9 vs 51.1 years 6
12.7, P < 0.0001), and were more likely to be under age
50 years (v2¼7.6); those who reported current smoking
behavior were more likely to be lost to follow-up at V2
(v2¼5.8). Study participants lost to follow-up at V3 (in-
cludes V2 attrition) had lower mean age (40.4 years 6
11.4 vs 51.8 years 6 12.5, P < 0.0001) and were more
likely to be younger than age 50 years (v2¼8.1).
Intervention Effectiveness
Step 1 Analysis – Group Means
Mixed model linear regressions were used to examine
change in scores across time points for each of the four main
outcomes. Significant improvements were demonstrated
for the ODI (F¼ 22.72, P< 0.0001), SF-36v2 Physical
Component Summary (Physical, F ¼ 19.8, P < 0.0001)
and Mental Component Summary (F ¼ 9.77, P ¼ 0.0001),
and SF-36v2 Bodily Pain Domain (F ¼ 24.4, P < 0.0001).
Figure 2 graphs the pattern of mean score improvement
from V1 to V2 and subsequent decrement from V2 to V3
for each outcome. Significant improvements in mean
scores for all measures were evident from V1 to V2, and
significant improvements in disability, functioning, and pain
were retained at V3 for the ODI, Physical Component
Summary, and Bodily Pain Domain.
Table 4 provides the mean point change scores from
V1 to V2, V2 to V3, and V1 to V3, as well as whether
reported change is clinically significant according to es-
tablished guidelines. Clinically meaningful improvements
in group mean scores were evident from V1 to V2 for all
outcomes
and
from
V1
to
V3
for
the
Physical
Component Summary and Bodily Pain Domain of the
SF-36v2. Decrements in mean scores were clinically

 significant from V2 to V3 for the SF-36v2’s Mental
Component Summary and Bodily Pain Domain.
Step 2 Analysis – Clinically Meaningful
Improvement
Clinically meaningful changes in pain- and health-related
quality of life were the outcomes of most interest for the
study team. Table 5 displays the proportion of partici-
pants who had clinically meaningful improvement from
baseline at V2 and V3 for each outcome measure. More
than half (54.1%) of participants had clinically improved
pain at V2 following the 12-week intervention period,
with 42.1% continued to report clinically meaningful
change at three months post–intervention application
(V3). Of those who had clinically meaningful change on
the ODI at V2 (N ¼ 46), 24 (75%) retained clinically
meaningful change at V3 (P < 0.01). For the SF36v2
Physical and Mental Component Summaries, 55.4%
and 43.4% reported clinically meaningful change follow-
ing the intervention period, with 46.1% and 30.3%
reporting clinical improvement at V3. For Bodily Pain,
49.4% and 40% were clinically improved at V2 and V3.

Seventy percent of adults age 50 years and older
achieved clinically significant improvement compared with
38% of younger adults (X2¼8.6, P� 0.01).
Retention of V2 Demonstrated Clinically Meaningful Change
at V3. Spearman correlations revealed only one baseline
characteristic associated with V3 retention of clinically
meaningful change demonstrated at V2. Specifically, non-
obese participants had smaller but still clinically meaningful
changes at 12 weeks for the ODI retained at 24 weeks.
Obese participants had much larger improvement in ODI at
12 weeks but failed to retain this change at 24 weeks
(repeated measures mixed linear modeling including time/
obesity interaction term; F¼ 10.9, P< 0.001).

Discussion
Treatment options for CLBP are numerous, with care of-
ten discordant with clinical guidelines [28]. While com-
peting
demands,
patient
preferences,
and
costs
influence treatment decisions, clinician perception of
whether a treatment works for patients in their practice
likely plays a critical role in the selection of treatments
[29,30]. Our findings of statistically and clinically mean-
ingful benefit to CLBP after a course of real-world mas-
sage therapy suggest the need for further study of
massage when recommended by PCPs.
We sought to address concerns that massage is insuffi-
ciently studied in primary care and embraced a pragmatic
approach [31]. Briefly, PCPs made the decision as to
which patients to recommend to massage. Patients were
not excluded due to comorbidities. The broad inclusion
criteria permitted a wider range of patient characteristics,
including age and obesity, that proved to be significant
factors. The ability of study massage therapists to develop
and apply individualized specific treatment plans informed
by their unique training and continuing education experi-
ences enhances confidence that specific massage inter-
ventions need not be selected by the PCP but left up to
the clinical decision-making of massage therapists. These
are marked differences from methods of more controlled
studies and are reflective of how a course of massage
therapy would typically be applied and accessed in the
United States.
Patient-Related Factors Uncovered
Not limiting advanced age allowed for a broad age
range (23–82 years) in KYPROS. This contributed to our
finding that CLBP patients 50 years of age and older
may have a greater probability of receiving clinically
meaningful benefit from massage. This is an important
finding considering that CLBP prevalence is high in the
Baby Boomer cohort (born 1946–1964) [32] and our di-
chotomous age variable categorized this cohort in our
older age category (50þ years).
Another novel methodology aspect of KYPROS permit-
ted inclusion of patients on DEA scheduled medications.
While the number of scheduled medications was nega-
tively associated with ODI improvement, the fact that
participants were on scheduled medications at all was
not associated with the likelihood of clinically meaningful
benefit in pain and disability. It may be the quantity of
such medications that affects massage benefit rather
than whether the patient is simply on scheduled medi-
cations. However, we are unsure of the extent to which
our study sample is representative of those on sched-
uled medications for CLBP. First, there were differences
in total number of pain-related medications between
those who were lost to follow-up or completed V2;
those with higher pharmacological burden were less
likely to complete data collection at 12 weeks. In
addition, patients who were prescribed at least one
scheduled medication made up a larger proportion
(70%) of those for whom PCPs completed pocket cards
but did not refer into the study or specifically recom-
mend massage (P < 0.01). Of those who were referred
to the study from PCPs and agreed to be contacted,
CLBP patients prescribed at least one scheduled medi-
cation had a lower proportion of enrollment (63%) than
those not reported as being on a scheduled medication
(73%; nonsignificant P values). Understanding the extent
to which massage is beneficial for those on scheduled
medications is important, especially in light of efforts to
reduce the use of opioids and other scheduled medica-
tions in pain populations [33,34]. Accordingly, targeted
methods to recruit and retain more pharmacologically
burdened (and specifically, opioid-using) CLBP patients
should be incorporated in future studies.
Brief Feasibility Findings
KYPROS incorporated novel design features, the feasibil-
ity of which had not been examined previously. Novel de-
sign features of note included the use of community
practicing massage therapists for intervention delivery
and research participants accessing real-world massage
as they would in a nonresearch setting. While a single
massage therapist was assigned to each participant, all
therapist/participant communication and contact were ini-
tiated and maintained by study therapists and partici-
pants. Research study personnel were not involved with
the scheduling or management of treatments accessed or
applied. By taking these key elements out of the hands of
the researchers, a less controlled and more pragmatic ap-
proach was employed. Ultimately, we did not know the
extent to which study participants would access and
schedule the stipulated 10 massage sessions on their
own. We found that 90% of patients initiated at least one
massage treatment and 60% received all 10 treatments.
The extent to which our CLBP participants accessed and
completed the course of massage treatments allowed in
this protocol gives us confidence that adequate treatment
exposure can be delivered with our study design.
We also found age differences in attrition at V2 and V3, with
those younger than age 50 years more likely to drop out of
the study. Younger people may have more obligations,
making the extra care visits required for massage treatment
to address their CLBP harder. This finding is important: low
adherence rates in younger patients may make these treat-
ments less advisable from a clinical perspective and from a
research perspective; design considerations to support ac-
cessibility may be needed for younger patients.
The proportion of completed massage treatments was also
considered in regards to feasibility of KYPROS’s novel study
design. Adherence to protocols of similar massage dosage
(10 sessions over 10–12 weeks) for CLBP was considered
Elder et al.

 as completing eight treatments in prior research, with
88–93% of participants meeting adherence [35]. By com-
parison, our study found that approximately 78% of those
who completed data collection at 12 weeks (N¼ 85) had
accessed at least eight sessions, and so could be consid-
ered compliant to treatment utilization. We recognize that
our numbers are lower than those of other studies, but
KYPROS is the only study to our knowledge in which re-
search study personnel were in no way responsible for inter-
vention scheduling and follow-up. All responsibility for
scheduling and access fell to study participants and mas-
sage therapists, again reflecting real-world massage ac-
cess/utilization for most in the United States. To this end,
our finding suggests that CLBP patients will access real-
world massage treatment if recommended to do so by their
PCP, at least under the conditions studied here, in which
fee barriers were alleviated.
Limitations and Future Directions
Several limitations of KYPROS could be addressed by a
larger, more comprehensive study. As a pilot study de-
veloping methods to examine massage in real-world
practice, KYPROS made no comparison to usual care.
To elucidate the extent to which benefits experienced
by KYPROS participants were specifically attributable to
massage, a no-treatment control or placebo comparison
group is needed [36]. However, changes reported here
were sufficient to be clinically meaningful; specifically,
psychometric
research
has
determined
a
six-point
change as representing meaningful differences in low
back pain with disability for the ODI [21,23,27]. While a
10-point change has been suggested as the minimally
clinically important change for the ODI, Ostelo and de
Vet also state the 10-point threshold is not set and, de-
pending on aims, “should be used as an indication”
[25]. For our pilot and feasibility purposes and consider-
ing that many participants not meeting the six-point
change threshold in KYPROS still reported treatment
satisfaction (69%), pain improvement (41%), pain relief
(36%), and the desire to have massage again if the pain
were to return or get worse (62%), we are confident in
our use of the validated ODI six-point change threshold
as indicative of meaningful change in low back pain and
disability. Without a control group, we cannot unequivo-
cally determine that massage was efficacious; however,
KYPROS results serve as a signal of real-world massage
effect for CLBP and further study using our piloted
treatment application methods is needed. Finally, this
study was conducted exclusively with Kentucky PCPs
and patients; attitudes toward and availability of the
treatments
may
differ
elsewhere
[37].
However,
KYPROS results do speak to a region where massage
is more novel [38] and not covered by health plans.
Conclusion
KYPROS results provide a meaningful signal of massage
effect and call for further research in practice settings
employing pragmatic designs with control groups to ex-
amine real-world massage effectiveness for primary care
patients with CLBP. Our exploratory findings about the
role of age, medications, and obesity on clinically mean-
ing benefit and retention of benefit from massage for
CLBP patients are promising. Increased study breadth
will allow further examination of these variables, includ-
ing physician perceptions by treatment effects as well
as other patient-oriented variables in relation to health
outcomes. Ultimately, our results and efforts may move
us closer to giving PCPs comprehensive, multiple option
strategies for select patient characteristics.
