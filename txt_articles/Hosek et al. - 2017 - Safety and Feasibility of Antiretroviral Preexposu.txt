IMPORTANCE Adolescents represent a key population for implementing preexposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) interventions worldwide, yet tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine
(TDF/FTC) for PrEP is only licensed for adults.
OBJECTIVE To examine the safety of and adherence to PrEP along with changes in sexual risk
behavior among adolescent men who have sex with men (MSM).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS
Interventions 113 (Project PrEPare) was a PrEP demonstration project that evaluated the
safety, tolerability, and acceptability of TDF/FTC and patterns of use, rates of adherence, and
patterns of sexual risk behavior among healthy young MSM aged 15 to 17 years. Participants
were recruited from adolescent medicine clinics and their community partners in 6 US cities,
had negative test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but were at high risk for
acquiring an infection, and were willing to participate in a behavioral intervention and accept
TDF/FTC as PrEP.
EXPOSURES All participants completed an individualized evidence-based behavioral
intervention and were provided with daily TDF/FTC as PrEP for 48 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main objectives were to: (1) provide additional safety
data regarding TDF/FTC use among young MSM who had negative test results for HIV;
(2) examine the acceptability, patterns of use, rates of adherence, and measured levels of
tenofovir diphosphate in dried blood spots; and (3) examine patterns of risk behavior when
young MSM were provided with a behavioral intervention in conjunction with open-label
TDF/FTC.
RESULTS Among 2864 individuals screened (from August 2013 to September 2014), 260
were eligible and 78 were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 16.5 [0.73] years), of whom 2 (3%) were
Asian/Pacific Islander, 23 (29%) were black/African American, 11 (14%) were white, 16 (21%)
were white Hispanic, and 26 (33%) were other/mixed race/ethnicity. Over 48 weeks of PrEP
use, 23 sexually transmitted infections were diagnosed in 12 participants. The HIV
seroconversion rate was 6.4 (95% CI: 1.3-18.7) per 100 person-years. Tenofovir diphosphate
levels consistent with a high degree of anti-HIV protection (>700 fmol/punch) were found in
42 (54%), 37 (47%), 38 (49%), 22 (28%), 13 (17%), and 17 (22%) participants at weeks 4, 8,
12, 24, 36, and 48, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS
Interventions 113 enrolled a diverse sample of adolescent MSM at risk for HIV who consented
to study participation. Approximately half achieved protective drug levels during the monthly
visits, but adherence decreased with quarterly visits. Youth may need additional contact with
clinical staff members to maintain high adherence.

n July 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration
approved the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/
emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) based on 3 stud-
iesthatdemonstratedefficacyforpreventingHIV.1-3Sincethen,
several open-label clinical trials and demonstration projects
have supported the effectiveness of administering daily oral
PrEP to prevent HIV.4-7 None of these clinical trials included
adolescent participants younger than 18 years, precluding
regulatory agencies from considering the approval of
TDF/FTC use for minors. Thus, a critical gap in approved pre-
vention products exists for adolescents, a population that is
highly vulnerable to HIV worldwide.
According to the World Health Organization,8 AIDS is the
leading cause of death among adolescents in sub-Saharan
Africa and the second leading cause for adolescents world-
wide. In 2015, there were an estimated 1.8 million adoles-
cents aged 10 to 19 years who were living with HIV, and an ado-
lescent aged 10 to 19 years was infected with HIV every 2
minutes.9 In the United States, adolescents and young adults
aged 13 to 24 years made up 22% of all new infections in 2014,
and 80% of those infections were among young men who have
sex with men (YMSM).10
To expand regulatory approvals and inform PrEP imple-
mentation efforts for young people, we designed Adolescent
Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions113 (ATN
113) as an open-label demonstration project and phase 2 safety
studyforadolescentMSMage15to17yearsintheUnitedStates.
Methods
Study Participants and Procedures
Participants were recruited in person and online through clini-
calsitesthatwereaffiliatedwithATN.Eligibleparticipantswere
aged 15 to 17 years, born male, and had negative test results
for HIV as determined by a blood-based antibody assay and an
HIV RNA assay at the screening visit. An additional require-
ment, based on similar criteria from the Preexposure Prophy-
laxis Initiative open-label trial,4 was self-reported risk for HIV
acquisition via any of the following in the last 6 months: con-
domless anal intercourse with a male partner with an HIV in-
fection or unknown HIV status, anal intercourse with at least
3 male partners, exchange sex, or sexually transmitted infec-
tion (STI). We excluded participants who had an estimated glo-
merular filtration rate of less than 75 mL/min using the bed-
side calculation by Schwartz and colleagues,11 and we also
excluded those with a reactive hepatitis B surface antigen, a
history of bone fractures, confirmed baseline hypophospha-
temia, proteinuria or glycosuria, and liver function and hema-
tology abnormalities that were grade 3 or more.
Eligible participants received 1 individual behavioral risk
reduction session using Personalized Cognitive Counseling12
before the PrEP medication initiation. Study visits were con-
ducted at baseline and monthly for 3 months, then quarterly
through week 48. Participants received a comprehensive HIV
prevention package that included regular HIV testing, sexual
health and adherence promotion using Integrated Next Step
Counseling,13 STI testing, and safety assessments at all visits.
At each study visit, participants also completed behavioral as-
sessments via an audio computer-assisted self-interview, re-
ceived condoms, and were given the study drug.
The protocol was approved by the institutional review
boards at all participating sites (Supplement 1). Adolescents
were allowed to consent to study participation without pa-
rental consent and all participants provided written in-
formed consent before undergoing any study procedures. A
descriptionoftheprocesstoallowadolescentconsenthasbeen
described elsewhere.14,15 Participants were provided compen-
sation for each study visit as determined by each site (range,
$50-$75).
Measures
PrEP Acceptability
Assessmentsofacceptabilitywereconductedatthe12-and48-
week visits using a questionnaire previously used with youth
(eg, “How much did you like or not like taking a pill every
day?”).16 Beliefs about PrEP were assessed using questions
adapted from the Preexposure Prophylaxis Initiative open-
label extension4 study to explore how PrEP may influence the
healthofparticipants,condomuse,andsexualbehavior,aswell
as reasons that participants would choose not to take PrEP (eg,
“If I took PrEP, I would worry it was hurting my health”).
Adherence
The AIDS Clinical Trials Group Adherence Follow-up
Questionnaire17 was adapted to examine the possible reasons
for missing PrEP doses and how often doses were missed for
those reasons over the past month. Preexposure prophylaxis
medication levels were assessed on dried blood spots col-
lected at each visit to quantify intracellular tenofovir diphos-
phate (TFV-DP) and emtricitabine triphosphate (FTC-TP) con-
centrations in red blood cells.18 Results were translated into
the dosing categories that were previously used in PrEP ran-
domized clinical trials with adult MSM.4 Dosing categories in-
cluded a below lower limit of quantitation, a lower limit of
quantitation to 349 fmol per punch (fewer than 2 tablets per
week), 350 to 699 fmol per punch (2-3 tablets per week), and
700 or more fmol per punch (4 or more tablets per week).
Key Points
Question Is human immunodeficiency virus preexposure
prophylaxis safe and feasible to use for adolescent men who sex
with men?
Findings In this study, preexposure prophylaxis was found to be
safe and well-tolerated, but adherence to the daily pill waned.
Rates of sexually transmitted infections were high and human
immunodeficiency virus infections occurred among those with
poor adherence.
Meaning Adolescent men who have sex with men who are at risk
of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus should be
offered access to preexposure prophylaxis with appropriate
behavioral support to maintain adherence.

 Sexual Behavior
A self-report questionnaire was used to assess each partici-
pant’
s general sexual history, as well as detailed sexual
behavior with last partner. Participants were tested for syphi-
lis at baseline and week 48, and as clinically indicated at
other visits. Rectal swabs for nucleic acid amplification test-
ing for gonorrhea (GC) and chlamydia (CT) were collected and
assayed at baseline, 24 weeks, 48 weeks, and as clinically
indicated at other visits. Urine-based nucleic acid amplifica-
tion testing for GC and CT occurred at every visit. An STI was
considered present based on a positive test result for urethral
or rectal GC or CT or serologic evidence of syphilis (adjudi-
cated based on current and prior rapid plasma reagin titers
and history).
Data and Safety Monitoring
The investigative team monitored the study for clinical ad-
verse events and abnormal laboratory values using the ATN
Table for Grading Severity of Adolescent Adverse Events
(October 2006–March 2011). Renal safety was monitored by
measuring serum creatinine, dipstick urine protein, and glu-
cose levels at each study visit. Bone mineral density (BMD)
levels were measured by dual-energy radiography absorpti-
ometry in the hip, spine, and total body at baseline, 24 weeks,
and 48 weeks. An external data and safety monitoring board
reviewed study safety data at 6-month intervals while the trial
was being conducted and uniformly recommended that the
study be completed.
Statistical Analysis
The demographic and risk characteristics of the study popu-
lation at baseline were examined using simple descriptive sta-
tistics. Categorical-scaled variables were described using fre-
quencies and percentages, while continuous variables were
examined in terms of medians and interquartile ranges (IQR).
Some exploratory analyses were conducted. For example,
bivariable relationships between study outcomes and charac-
teristics of interest were examined using the Fisher exact
test for categorical characteristics and the nonparametric
Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous characteristics when
based on comparisons between independent groups. The
McNemar test was used when comparing binary measures
between time points among participants or using a general-
ized estimating equations approach for repeated measures to
account for correlations among participants; an exchangeable
(compound symmetry) correlation structure was assumed.
The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to
assess changes in continuous measures between time points
among participants.
Cumulative STI incidence rates (and 95% CIs) were esti-
mated separately for the 0- to 24- and 24- to 48-week period
using a repeated-measures Poisson regression model; an
unstructured correlation was specified in the models. In ad-
dition to yielding model-based estimates of the STI incidence
rates, this approach also provided a statistical assessment that
compared the rates between the study periods. Statistical sig-
nificance was set at P = .05. All analyses were conducted using
SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Between August 2013 and September 2014, 78 participants
enrolled in the study (Figure 1). Their mean (SD) age was 16.5
(0.73) years, and 23 (29%) self-identified as black/African
American, 16 (21%) as white Hispanic, and 26 (33%) as other/
mixed race/ethnicity. Most identified as gay (n = 45, 58%) or
bisexual (n = 22, 28%). Most (n = 69, 88%) lived with their
families and were currently in school (n = 67, 86%). In the
month before baseline, 49 participants (67%) reported that
they drank alcohol and 47 (64%) reported smoking mari-
juana. Twelve participants (15%) had been expelled from
their homes because of their sexual orientation at some
point, and 13 (17%) reported having exchanged sex for
money. Twenty-four participants (60%) reported having
condomless receptive anal intercourse with their last sexual
partner, and 12 (15%) had a prevalent STI at study entry
(Table 1).
Five participants failed to complete the week 0 visit within
30 days of screening and were prematurely discontinued from

tionsadjustedforrace/ethnicityandageandmedian−0.1,−0.1,
and −0.2 in the spine, hip, and total body, respectively). At 48
weeks, results were available for 43 participants, for whom
there were statistically significant increases from baseline in
BMD in the spine (median 2.6%; IQR, 0.0-4.6; P < .001), hip
(1.2%;IQR,−0.9to4.3;P = .02),andtotalbody(0.7%;IQR,−0.2

significantlyfrombaselineto48weeks,butthetotalbodyBMD
z score decreased (−0.20; IQR, −0.3 to 0.0; P < .001). Explor-
atory subgroup analyses revealed no statistically significant
differences in change in BMD between participants with 48-
week dried blood spot TFV-DP levels commensurate with 4 or
more doses per week (>700 fmol/punch; n = 10), when com-
pared with changes in those with levels associated with fewer
than2dosesperweek(<350fmol/punch;n = 24),orthosewith
no evidence of recent dosing (below lower limit of quantifi-
cation; n = 17).
Sexual Behavior
At baseline, study participants reported a median of 1.0 (IQR,
1-3) male sexual partners in the past month. Numbers of sexual
partners and condomless sex acts did not change signifi-
cantly over time (eTable in the Supplement 2). Before PrEP ini-
tiation, 19 prevalent STIs were diagnosed in 14 participants (5
rectalGC,8rectalCT,4urineCT,and2syphilis).Over48weeks
of PrEP use, 23 STIs were diagnosed in 12 participants (6 rec-
tal GC, 8 rectal CT, 5 urine CT, 3 urine GC, and 1 syphilis). Sexu-
ally transmitted infection incidence rates that were esti-
mated based on a Poisson regression model were higher in the
first 24 weeks of the study (18.1/100 person-years; 95% CI,
9.7-34.0) compared with weeks 24 to 48 of the study (9.4/
100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.4-25.6), but not significantly so
(rate ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.62-5.96; P = .25).
Adherence

levels over the first 12 weeks of treatment with declining levels
thereafter.Amongthe72participantswhowereprescribedPrEP

levels of TFV-DP that were associated with high levels of pro-
tection against rectal HIV exposure (ie, consistent with taking
a mean of 4 pills or more per week [>700 fmol/punch]) were
found in 42 (54%), 37 (47%), 38 (49%), 22 (28%), 13 (17%), and
17 (22%) participants at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48, respec-
tively. Based on generalized estimating equations modeling,

follow-up: 1 each at 32, 36, and 48 weeks for an annualized HIV
incidence of 6.4 (95% CI, 1.3-18.7) infections per 100 person-
years. Tenofovir diphosphate levels for seroconverters are
shown in Figure 3 and are all consistent with taking fewer than
a mean of 2 doses per week at the likely time of HIV acquisi-
tion. No genotypic mutations conferring resistance to tenofo-
vir or emtricitabine were detected by consensus sequencing
at the time of diagnosis.
Compared with participants with protective levels of TFV-
DP, those without protective levels were more likely to en-
dorse the statement “I worry others will see me taking pills and
thinkIamHIV-positive”(baseline,4participants[22.2%];week
48, 5 participants [29.4%]; P = .03). The most commonly re-
ported reasons for missing doses of the study medication were
being away from home (n = 105, 32%), being too busy (n = 91,
28%), forgetting (n = 85, 26%), and changes in routine (n = 61,
18%). Participants could contribute more than once to the re-
porting of each reason. The acceptability of the pill size and
pill taste decreased from 12 weeks to 48 weeks (“Liked a lot”
range, 6 [10.2%] to 3 [7.1%]; P = .06; and “Liked a lot” range, 3
[5.0%] to 1 [2.4%]; P = .002; respectively), coincident with de-
clines in biomarkers of adherence.
Discussion
To our knowledge, ATN 113 is the first study on the safety and
implementation of PrEP among adolescent MSM. This study

 demonstrates that adolescents who are at risk for HIV and
therefore likely to benefit from PrEP can be enrolled in a bio-
medical HIV prevention clinical trial. A major challenge of this
study was to ensure safe and unfettered access for at-risk
minors to provide consent for their own participation in a clini-
cal trial and to contribute crucial data for licensure.18,19
Acceptability ratings of PrEP, the overall study, and the
study components were high. Preexposure prophylaxis was
well tolerated by participants with no documented discon-
tinuations because of adverse effects and no confirmed ab-
normal laboratory results. Peak bone mass, which is a potent
predictor of fractures in later life19 is typically not achieved un-
til late adolescence or early adulthood,20 so we expected to see
overall increases in BMD among young men aged 15 to 17 years.
On the other hand, the slight but statistically significant de-
cline in total body BMD z score suggests that growth may have
been less than would be predicted among this age group. The
apparent lack of a strong association of change in BMD with
magnitude of TFV exposure (week 48 dried blood spot TFV-DP
levels) differs from results seen among adult MSM who use
PrEP.21 However, we would caution that the relatively small
samplesize,coupledwiththecompetingforcesofbonegrowth
and TDF-associated bone loss, make it difficult to draw con-
clusions about the effects of TDF on bone density levels in this
age group. Further study, including follow-up measurements
of changes in BMD after discontinuation of PrEP, is warranted
to fully assess the potential risks and benefits of using TDF/
FTC PrEP in this vulnerable population.
The incidence of STIs decreased among participants, but
the HIV incidence rate was high compared with other open-
label clinical trials in the United States4,6 and almost twice the
rate found in the companion ATN 110 study that enrolled MSM
who were aged 18 to 22 years.22 Those who had seroconver-
sion had very low levels of drugs detected, if any, at the time
of seroconversion. These results continue to strengthen and
support the conclusion of the data that PrEP works when taken
according to the prescribed dose.
Challenges with adherence to medication are common-
place among adolescents, regardless of whether it is adher-
ence to a treatment or prevention regimen. Nonadherence
among youth is often a reflection of both the biological and be-
havioraltransitionsthatoccurduringthisdevelopmentaltime,
including increased autonomy from parents/caregivers, in-
creased importance of peers and corresponding vulnerability
to peer influence and stigma, and an undeveloped cognitive
capacity for organization and planning. Furthermore, low per-
ceived HIV risk has been associated with low adherence in pre-
vention clinical trials.23 Thus, it is not surprising that a pro-
portion of adolescents in this study were unable to adhere with
enoughfrequencytoconferhighlevelsofHIVprotection.How-
ever, most participants were able to take at least 2 doses per
week as estimated by TFV-DP levels, indicating that they were
attempting to adhere to the regimen, albeit with less fre-
quency than prescribed. Of critical importance will be the de-
velopment and testing of long-acting PrEP agents for HIV pre-
vention among adolescents that would likely reduce (although
not eliminate) the adherence issues that are associated with
daily pills.
A noticeable trend in the adherence data from this study,
also seen in ATN 110, is the striking drop in TFV-DP levels once
participants began the quarterly visit schedule. We have sug-
gested that an augmented visit schedule, or at least the op-
tionofadditionalvisits,mightbemostappropriateforyouth.22
Indeed, this approach would be consistent with the US con-
traceptive practice recommendations, which already recog-
nize that adolescents are a special population who might ben-
efit from more frequent follow-up than adults.24 Additional
developmentally appropriate methods of sustaining PrEP
engagement and adherence include more frequent interac-
tions via mobile technology for medication reminders or sup-
portive check-ins, adherence support through clubs or groups,
peer buddies, and other youth-focused methods of service
delivery.25
In addition to addressing the individual-level barriers to
adherence, more work is needed to address community-level
barriers, such as the stigma and homophobia associated with
PrEP.AKaiserFoundationsurveyfoundthat84%ofyouthaged
15 to 24 years reported recognizing stigma around HIV in the
United States26 and other studies have found that black MSM
were more likely than other MSM to report experiencing
PrEP-related stigma,27 as well as sexuality-related stigma.28
Anticipatory stigma from sexual partners has also been
reported as a barrier to PrEP use.29 These multifaceted expe-
riences with stigma ultimately limit access to PrEP for those
who may benefit from it the most.
To our knowledge, ATN 113 is the first adolescent-specific
PrEP clinical trial to be completed, but it will certainly not be
the last, and there is much work to do. We need to better
understand the barriers to adherence and develop more effec-
tivewaystoenhanceadherenceforyouthwhoareclinicallypre-
scribed PrEP. More research is needed to explore PrEP knowl-
edge, the accuracy of risk perception, stigmas, and access
problems among adolescents, as well as clinician competence.
For youth who are vulnerable to HIV infection, biomedi-
cal tools need to be leveraged and integrated with behavioral
interventions. While it may be challenging to enroll youth into
biomedical clinical trials, if youth are not enrolled then they
cannot benefit from the regulatory approval of these life-
saving tools. Conversely, if they are simply used off-label with-
out the support of contextual and biomedical data from such
trials, then the safest and most appropriate manner in which
to use these tools in youth will remain unclear and barriers to
access could become insurmountable.
Limitations
This study has several limitations to be considered when in-
terpreting the results. The small sample size of the study, along
with lack of participation from some ATN sites, may limit the
generalizability of the findings as representative of adoles-
cent MSM in other geographic areas or sociodemographic cat-
egories. In addition, while rectal swabs and urine were col-
lected for STI testing in this study, we did not conduct
pharyngeal testing and samples were only routinely col-
lectedatbaseline,24weeks,and48weeks.Thissamplingstrat-
egy may ultimately have underestimated the rates of STIs
among this sample. Finally, the time and resources that were

 needed to conduct this study were substantial and may limit
the ability to replicate these findings in future clinical trials.
Conclusions
The high incidence rates of HIV and STIs among YMSM,
along with the lack of any significant safety signals from
this study, strongly support the need for an adolescent PrEP
indication for TDF/FTC. The waning adherence, especially
with quarterly visits, demonstrates that more time, atten-
tion, and resources may need to be allocated to adolescents
whoareseekingpreventionservices.Developmentallyappro-
priate visit schedules within adolescent-friendly service
facilities will be important additions to PrEP implementa-
tion programs.
