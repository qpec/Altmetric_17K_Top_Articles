OBJECTIVE: To investigate buprenorphine exposures among children and adolescents  
≤19 years old in the United States.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from calls to US poison control centers for 2007–2016 from the 
National Poison Data System.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2016, there were 11 275 children and adolescents ≤19 years old 
exposed to buprenorphine reported to US poison control centers. Most exposures were 
among children <6 years old (86.1%), unintentional (89.2%), and to a single substance 
(97.3%). For single-substance exposures, children <6 years old had greater odds of hospital 
admission and of serious medical outcome than adolescents 13 to 19 years old. Adolescents 
accounted for 11.1% of exposures; 77.1% were intentional (including 12.0% suspected 
suicide), and 27.7% involved multiple substances. Among adolescents, the odds of hospital 
admission and a serious medical outcome were higher for multiple-substance exposures 
than single-substance exposures.
CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine is important for the treatment of opioid use disorder, but 
pediatric exposure can result in serious adverse outcomes. Manufacturers should use unit-
dose packaging for all buprenorphine products to help prevent unintentional exposure 
among young children. Health providers should inform caregivers of young children about 
the dangers of buprenorphine exposure and provide instructions on proper medication 
storage and disposal. Adolescents should receive information regarding the risks of 
substance abuse and misuse. Suspected suicide accounted for 12% of adolescent exposures, 
highlighting the need for access to mental health services for this age group.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Buprenorphine-
containing products are increasingly prescribed in 
the United States and, in recent years, have become 
a commonly ingested medication by children. 
Children <6 years old account for the majority of 
pediatric buprenorphine exposures, which can have 
serious medical outcomes.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Among children <6 years 
old, 48.1% of buprenorphine exposures resulted in 
hospital admission and 21.4% in a serious medical 
outcome. Among adolescents 13 to 19 years old, 
21.5% of exposures resulted in hospital admission 
and 22.0% in a serious medical outcome.

 There is an opioid crisis in the United 
States. In 2016, an estimated 2.1 
million people had an opioid use 
disorder, and 11.5 million people 
misused prescription opioids.1 
Buprenorphine is a prescription 
opioid which, relative to others, 
has a lower maximum effect and 
reported lower risk of abuse or 
misuse.2 In 2002, the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
buprenorphine, either alone or in 
combination with naloxone, for the 
treatment of opioid dependence.2 
From 2005 to 2010, the annual 
number of individual patients 
who received a buprenorphine 
prescription increased from 100 000 
to ˃800 000.2
US children have been affected by 
the opioid crisis. Ninety percent of 
buprenorphine exposures reported 
to US poison control centers (PCCs) 
from 2000 to 2015 occurred among 
children <6 years old, and, from 
2010 to 2011, the combination 
of buprenorphine and naloxone 
was the most common medication 
ingestion resulting in hospitalization 
among young children.3, 
 
4 In 
2016, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics recommended expanding 
access to buprenorphine for the 
treatment of severe opioid use 
disorder in adolescents; therefore, 
buprenorphine access is anticipated 
to increase in the pediatric 
population.5
Authors of previous studies on 
pediatric buprenorphine exposures 
have investigated buprenorphine 
toxicity and clinical outcomes among 
children, but the majority of studies 
were case studies, emergency 
department visits and/or hospital 
admissions only, or those in which 
authors focused solely on young 
children.4, 
 
6 
– 
10 With the current 
study, we use the National Poison 
Data System (NPDS) database from 
2007 to 2016 to investigate the 
epidemiology of buprenorphine 
exposures among US children 19 
years of age and younger.
METHODS
Data Sources
Data regarding buprenorphine 
exposures among US children 
were obtained from the NPDS, a 
database owned and maintained 
by the American Association of 
Poison Control Centers (AAPCC). The 
NPDS includes data from regional 
PCCs throughout the United States 
regarding telephone calls they 
receive in which a poison exposure 
is reported.11 US Census Bureau 
July 1 intercensal and postcensal 
population estimates from 2007 
to 2016 were used to calculate 
population-based exposure rates.12
Case Selection Criteria
By using the AAPCC’s proprietary 
product codes for buprenorphine-
containing products, the NPDS 
was queried for all buprenorphine 
exposures involving children 19 
years and younger that occurred 
from January 1, 2007, through 
December 31, 2016. Exposures to 
multiple substances were included 
only if the first-ranked substance 
(the substance most likely to have 
contributed to the clinical effect[s] 
observed) was a buprenorphine-
containing product. Cases were 
excluded if (1) the medical outcome 
was a “confirmed non-exposure” 
or “unrelated effect, the exposure 
was probably not responsible 
for the effect(s)” or (2) it was a 
multiple-substance exposure and 
buprenorphine was not the first-
ranked substance.
Study Variables
Child age was grouped as <6 years, 
6 to 12 years, and adolescents 
(13–19 years). The AAPCC’s 
proprietary product codes were 
used to segregate buprenorphine-
containing products into formulation 
categories (tablet, film, injection 
or patch, and unknown). Reasons 
for exposure were categorized as 
unintentional (exposure resulted 
from an unforeseen or unplanned 
event), intentional (exposure 
resulted from a purposeful action), 
other (including adverse reaction and 
other known reasons), and unknown. 
Unintentional reasons were 
subcategorized into general (includes 
exposure associated with child 
exploratory behavior), therapeutic 
error, and other and/or unknown 
reasons. Intentional reasons were 
subcategorized into misuse and/
or abuse, suspected suicide, and 
unknown. Exposure site was grouped 
into residence (own or other), other, 
and unknown.
The level of care received at a health 
care facility (HCF) was categorized 
as no HCF care received, treated and 
released from an HCF, admitted to 
an HCF (including to a critical care 
unit [CCU], non-CCU, or psychiatric 
facility), and other (patient refused 
referral, did not arrive at the HCF, 
was lost to follow-up, or left against 
medical advice). Medical outcomes 
were grouped into serious outcome 
(including death, major effect, and 
moderate effect), minor effect, no 
effect, not followed (at most minimal 
clinical effect expected), and unable 
to follow (potentially toxic). As 
defined by the NPDS, major effects 
are life-threatening or result in 
significant residual disability or 
disfigurement. Moderate effects are 
more pronounced, prolonged, or 
systemic relative to minor effects 
and involve some form of indicated 
treatment. Minor effects are 
minimally bothersome and usually 
resolve rapidly.13 Other variables 
included the year of exposure, 
number of products involved, related 
clinical effects and their duration, and 
therapies performed.
Statistical Analysis and Ethical 
Concerns
IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM 
SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation, 
Armonk, NY) and SAS Enterprise 
Guide 7.11 HF3 (SAS Institute, 
Inc, Cary, NC) statistical software 
were used to analyze NPDS data.

 Descriptive statistics and odds ratios 
(ORs) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were calculated. Although we 
included both single-substance and 
first-ranked multiple-substance 
exposures in this study, only 
single-substance exposures were 
included in analyses of the clinical 
effects and clinical effect duration 
associated with buprenorphine. 
This eliminated the possibility of 
misattribution of effects and drug 
interactions associated with the 
multiple-substance exposures. 
For the same reasons, only single-
substance exposures were included 
when comparing HCF admission and 
serious medical outcome between 
age groups and between tablet and 
film exposures (excluding injection 
or patch and unknown formulations) 
among children <6 years old. The 
institutional review board at the 
authors’ institution judged this study 
as exempt.
RESULTS
General Characteristics and Trends
A total of 11 275 children ≤19 years 
old exposed to buprenorphine were 
reported to PCCs during 2007–2016. 
The mean age of children exposed  
to buprenorphine was 3.8 years  
(SD = 4.9; median = 2.0; interquartile 
range = 1.5–3.0). Children <6 years 
old accounted for 86.1% of exposures 
with exposure frequency peaking 
among 1- and 2-year-olds (Fig 1). The 
overall exposure rate per 1 000 000 
children increased by 215.6% from 
6.4 in 2007 to 20.2 in 2010, followed 
by a 42.6% decline from 2010 to 
11.6 in 2013 before increasing by 
8.6% to 12.6 in 2016. The overall 
trends were driven by trends 
among children <6 years old (Fig 
2). Most of the exposures involved 
a single buprenorphine product 
(93.7%), occurred at a residence 
(96.0%), and occurred by ingestion 
(97.8%). Male patients accounted 
for the majority of all exposures 
(53.1%) and within each age group 
(Table 1). “Unintentional” was the 
most common (89.2%) reason for 
exposures, but the reason varied by 
age group. Tablets (65.8%) and film 
(20.8%) were the most common 
buprenorphine formulations 
involved, and these proportions 
persisted within each age group. 
Many exposures (44.6%) resulted 
in an HCF admission (including 
21.9% admitted to a CCU), 29.9% 
were treated and released from 
an HCF, and 21.2% resulted in a 
serious medical outcome (including 
11 fatalities) (Table 1). Multiple-
substance exposures resulted in 
a higher percentage of an HCF 
admission (50.8% vs 44.2%) and 
serious medical outcome (34.3% 
vs 20.3%) than single-substance 
exposures.
Clinical Effects and Therapies Among 
Single-Substance Exposures
Among the 10 570 children exposed 
to a single buprenorphine product, 
59.0% (n = 5456) experienced at 
least 1 related symptom. The most 
common symptoms were drowsiness 
and/or lethargy (46.8%), vomiting 
(17.0%), and miosis (12.6%) (Table 2).  
Serious clinical effects included 
respiratory depression (n = 891), 
bradycardia (n = 98), coma (n = 65), 
cyanosis (n = 36), respiratory arrest 
(n = 23), seizure (n = 10), and cardiac 
arrest (n = 6). Among children 
who experienced at least 1 related 
symptom, 6.8% of symptoms lasted 
≤2 hours, 31.6% lasted ≤8 hours, 
and 77.7% lasted ≤24 hours (Table 
2). Of the 4905 (46.4%) children who 
received at least 1 therapy, naloxone 
(19.2%; n = 2027), intravenous fluids 
(16.8%; n = 1773), and single-dose 
or multiple-dose charcoal (8.0%; n = 
850) were among the most common 
therapies given. Most (96.3%) of the 
children who received naloxone were 
<6 years old. In addition, 52 children 
(0.5%) received endotracheal 
intubation.
Children <6 Years Old
Most (96.4%) buprenorphine 
exposures among children <6 years 
old were single-substance exposures, 
and the reason for exposure for 
98.3% was “unintentional-general” 
(Table 1). The exposure rate per 
1 000 000 children <6 years old 
increased 229.9% from 18.4 in 2007

 to 60.7 in 2010, decreased 46.1% 
from 2010 to 32.7 in 2013, and then 
increased by 17.1% to 38.3 in 2016 
(Fig 2). Exposure trends during 
2007–2010 were driven by exposures 
to buprenorphine tablets, which 
accounted for 96.3% of exposures 
during this period. From 2007 to 
2010, buprenorphine tablet exposures 
increased by 236.2%, followed by an 
82.1% decrease from 2010 to 2014 
and a gradual decrease of 7.8% from 
2014 to 2016 (Fig 3). The increase 
in exposures during 2013–2016 was 
related to increases in exposure to 
buprenorphine film (29.9%) and 
unknown forms of buprenorphine 
(138.9%) (Fig 3). This followed a 
35.7% decrease in the number of 
exposures to buprenorphine film 
during 2011–2013.
Almost half (48.1%) of children <6 
years old were admitted to an HCF 
(including 23.6% to a CCU), and 
21.4% experienced serious medical 
outcomes (including 2.0% with major 
effects and 7 deaths) (Table 1).  
Compared with single-substance 
exposures, a greater percentage of 
multiple-substance exposures were 
admitted to an HCF and had a serious 
medical outcome (Table 3). Among 
the 7 deaths, all were single-substance 
exposures, 6 were children 1 and 2 
years old, and 6 involved tablet (n = 4) 
or film (n = 2) formulations.
For single-substance exposures, 
children <6 years old had greater 
odds of an HCF admission (OR: 2.13; 
95% CI: 1.66–2.73) and a serious 
medical outcome (OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 
1.41–2.84) than the 6- to 12-year-
old age group. Children <6 years 
old also had greater odds of an HCF 
admission (OR: 5.84; 95% CI: 4.81–
7.10) and a serious medical outcome 
(OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.13–1.63) than 
adolescents 13 to 19 years of age. 
In addition, children <6 years old 
exposed to buprenorphine film had 
similar odds of experiencing a serious 
medical outcome compared with 
those exposed to tablets (OR: 1.03; 
95% CI: 0.91–1.17) (Table 3).
Children 6 to 12 Years Old
Children 6 to 12 years old accounted 
for 2.8% (n = 315) of exposures. 
Although 6- to 12-year-old children 
represent a behavioral transition 
group between children <6 years 
old and adolescents, similar to 
younger children, most of their 
exposures were unintentional 
(83.2%), specifically, unintentional-
general (57.5%) and unintentional-
therapeutic errors (17.8%) (Table 1).  
HCF admission occurred for 29.8% 
of exposures, and 11.7% of children 
experienced serious medical 
outcomes but no fatalities.
Adolescents 13 to 19 Years Old
Adolescents accounted for 11.1% 
of exposures. In contrast to young 
children, 77.1% of buprenorphine 
exposures among adolescents were 
intentional, and 27.7% involved ˃1 
substance. The exposure rate per 
1 000 000 adolescents increased by 
195.0% from 2.0 in 2007 to 5.9 in 
2010, followed by a 47.5% decline 
from 2010 to 3.1 in 2016 (Fig 2). 
More than one-fifth (21.5%) of 
adolescent exposures resulted in 
an HCF admission (including 11.5% 
admitted to a CCU), and 22.0% 
experienced a serious medical 
outcome (including 2.6% with a 
major effect and 4 deaths). All 4 
deaths were multiple-substance 
exposures; 2 involved buprenorphine 
with benzodiazepines, ethanol, 
and other substances; 1 involved 
buprenorphine with benzodiazepines 
and marijuana; and 1 involved 
buprenorphine with ethanol. The 
odds of an HCF admission (OR: 4.74; 
95% CI: 3.56–6.31) and serious 
medical outcome (OR: 2.97; 95% 
CI: 2.24–3.93) were higher for 
adolescents exposed to multiple 
substances than those exposed to 
buprenorphine alone.
Of the 150 (12.0%) adolescents 
suspected of a suicide attempt, 
58.7% were multiple-substance 
exposures, 65.3% were admitted 
(including 32.0% to a CCU), and 
42.7% experienced a serious medical 
outcome (including 12 with major 
effects and 1 death; Table 4). Female 
patients accounted for 58.7% of 
suspected suicides.
Of the 759 (60.7%) adolescents with 
intentional abuse and/or misuse 
exposures, 17.9% were admitted 
(including 9.9% to a CCU), and

 20.6% experienced a serious medical 
outcome (including 13 with major 
effects and 2 deaths; Table 4). Male 
patients accounted for 62.7% of abuse 
and/or misuse exposures. Among the 
193 (25.4%) intentional abuse and/or 
misuse exposures involving multiple 
substances, buprenorphine was 
commonly used with benzodiazepines 
(31.1%; n = 60), ethanol (18.7%;  
n = 36), and marijuana (13.5%;  
n = 26).
DISCUSSION
During the 10-year study period, 
˃11 000 buprenorphine exposures 
among individuals ≤19 years old 
were reported to US PCCs. Most 
were among children <6 years old 
(86.1%) and adolescents 13 to 19 
years old (11.1%); therefore, we 
will focus on these age groups in our 
discussion. Approximately 45% of 
children exposed to buprenorphine 
were admitted to an HCF, and 
more than one-fifth had a serious

 medical outcome. The proportion 
of exposures resulting in an HCF 
admission for buprenorphine 
was higher than that reported 
for other prescription opioids 
during 2000–2015, as was the 
proportion of exposures resulting 
in serious medical outcomes, with 
the exceptions of methadone and 
fentanyl.3
Children <6 Years Old
Because children <6 years 
old accounted for 86% of all 
buprenorphine exposures, trends 
in this age group were the major 
influence on overall exposure trends. 
From 2007 to 2010, exposure rates 
increased ˃200%, which is likely 
attributable to the increasing number 
of buprenorphine prescriptions 
dispensed since the FDA approved 
its use as a treatment of opioid 
dependence in 2002.14 
– 
16 Despite the 
number of dispensed buprenorphine 
and naloxone prescriptions almost 
tripling from 2008 to 2016, 
4  
there was a transient decrease 
in buprenorphine exposures 
during 2010–2013, which may 
have been influenced by several 
factors. One factor may be a shift in 
buprenorphine prescriptions to a 
population less likely to have young 
children in the home. From 2003 to 
2013, office visits for buprenorphine 
treatment among individuals 20 to 
39 years old decreased by 20.2% 
with a concomitant 22.3% increase 
among individuals 40 to 59 years 
old.17 In addition, the Prevention of

 Away and Out of Sight medication 
safety program may have influenced 
exposure trends.18
In addition, the observed decrease in 
buprenorphine exposures was likely 
associated with concurrent changes 
in buprenorphine packaging, which 
also have the potential to reduce the 
severity of exposures that do occur. 
Similar to previous study findings, 
8, 
 
19  
tablets accounted for almost all 
exposures in this study from 2007 
to 2010. This is because almost all 
of the buprenorphine and naloxone 
prescriptions dispensed from 2008 to 
2010 were tablets.4 The decline in the 
exposure rate in this study coincided 
with the August 2010 FDA approval 
of a buprenorphine film17 that was 
sold only in unit-dose child-resistant 
packaging.4 The observed decrease in 
the exposure rate from 2010 to 2013 
was associated with a decrease in both 
tablet and film exposures. The decline 
in tablet exposures was driven, in 
part, by a 19% decrease in sales of 
the leading brand-name tablets as 
the manufacturer transitioned to a 
film formulation.20 Then, in 2013, 
the leading brand-name tablets were 
voluntarily withdrawn from the US 
market because of potential risk of 
unintentional pediatric exposures, 
21  
which likely contributed to a further 
decrease in tablet exposures. It 
is unknown why the number of 
exposures to buprenorphine film 
decreased by 35.7% from 2011 to 
2013, despite a doubling in sales 
to ˃$764 million from 2011 to 
2012.20 The unit-dose packaging of 
buprenorphine film may make it less 
accessible to young children.
From 2013 to 2016, there was a 
30% increase in the frequency of 
exposures to buprenorphine film, 
which may be attributable to the 
continued increase in the number of 
prescriptions for this formulation. 
During the same period, there 
was a 139% increase in exposures 
to buprenorphine of unknown 
formulation. If these unknown 
formulation exposures were 
dominated by 1 type of formulation, 
such as tablets, this would alter the 
trends of tablets versus film observed 
during 2013–2016 in this study.
In this study, the type of formulation 
(tablet versus film) did not affect 
the odds of a serious medical 
outcome among young children. 
Therefore, regardless of formulation, 
buprenorphine is dangerous to young 
children, and primary prevention of 
access is key. Unit-dose packaging is a 
proven strategy for limiting access to 
medications by young children22 and 
is the preferred type of packaging 
for buprenorphine products. Proper 
storage out of sight and reach of 
young children, preferably in a 
locked location (which limits access 
to adolescents as well), is important. 
In May 2016, the FDA approved the 
first buprenorphine subcutaneous 
implant for the treatment of opioid 
use disorder, which may also help 
limit child access.23
Among single-substance exposures, 
children <6 years of age had greater 
odds of an HCF admission and of 
experiencing a serious medical 
outcome than adolescents. Therapeutic 
doses of buprenorphine-naloxone for 
pediatric patients are 2 to 6 µg/kg, so 
ingestion of a single 2 mg sublingual 
tablet in a 10 kg child can result in 
more than a 30-fold overdose.6 This 
is particularly dangerous, because 
children exposed to buprenorphine do 
not display the “ceiling effect” reported 
in adults, in which escalating doses 
do not lead to additional increases in 
respiratory depression.24 In addition, 
young children may be admitted to an 
HCF more often because physicians 
may exercise more caution in this age 
group. In this study, almost half of 
exposed children <6 years old were 
admitted to an HCF, but only 21.4% 
experienced serious medical outcomes. 
Young children also often experience 
a delay in the onset of symptoms after 
buprenorphine exposure; the median 
time from exposure to respiratory 
depression was 4.4 hours in 1 study.25 
This known delay in symptom onset 
likely contributes to the higher 
admission rate for young children.

 adolescents were intentional. 
Although buprenorphine abuse 
has been reported, it is regarded 
as 1 of the least-abused opioids.1, 
 
26 
However, in non-opioid dependent 
individuals, buprenorphine 
produces the euphoric effects and 
positive reinforcement properties 
associated with other opioids.26 
As medical prescribing of opioids 
(including buprenorphine) 
increased, so did abuse and 
diversion of these medications.27 
Friends and relatives are a major 
source for young adult nonmedical 
opioid users, who state that the main 
motivations for illicit buprenorphine 
use are self-medication of 
withdrawal symptoms and getting 
high.28
More than one-fourth of exposures 
among adolescents involved 
˃1 substance; specifically, 
benzodiazepines were used 
concurrently with buprenorphine in 
60 of the intentional abuse and/or 
misuse exposures. Benzodiazepine 
use has previously been reported 
to increase the high of other drugs 
and lessen withdrawal symptoms, 
both of which coincide with the 
main motivations identified 
for buprenorphine use.29 The 
combination of benzodiazepines 
with buprenorphine is known to 
enhance central nervous system 
and respiratory depression.30  
Three of the 4 deaths of 13- to 
19-year-old individuals  
involved this combination of 
medications.
Suspected suicide accounted for 12% 
of exposures among adolescents. 
Female patients accounted for almost 
60% of suspected suicides, whereas 
male patients accounted for ˃60% 
of abuse and/or misuse exposures. 
Female patients tend to use less 
violent methods to commit suicide, 
such as ingestion of medications.3, 
 
31  
Our findings corroborate previous 
reports of higher rates of illicit 
buprenorphine use by male 
patients.28

In 2016, the American Academy 
of Pediatrics issued a statement 
advocating for increased access to 
buprenorphine for opioid-addicted 
adolescents in primary care 
settings.5 This recommendation is 
warranted because of the high and 
increasing prevalence of opioid 
dependence among adolescents. 
However, caution should be used, 
because increased prescriptions 
among adolescents could lead to 
increased diversion and abuse 
and increased access to younger 
children in the home. Therefore, 
patient education for adolescents 
should include information about the 
dangers of misusing and/or abusing 
prescription drugs and the proper 
storage of medications.
Study Limitations
Because not all pediatric 
buprenorphine exposures are 
reported to PCCs, the true number 
of buprenorphine exposures is 
underestimated, and the results of 
our study may not be representative 
of those exposures not reported 
to PCCs. Reported exposures 
do not necessarily represent a 
poisoning or overdose. The NPDS 
does not collect patient identifiers, 
so repeat exposures cannot be 
identified. Newer generic forms 
of buprenorphine do not have 
specific product codes in the 
NPDS, which limited some of our 
analyses. Although authors of 1 
small study suggested less-common 
clinical effects and treatments may 
be undercoded in NPDS, 
32 other 
analyses have revealed the accuracy 
of PCC data to be as good as, or better 
than, other hospital or emergency 
department databases.33 
– 
35 The 
NPDS relies on self-reports, which 
cannot fully be verified by the 
PCCs or AAPCC. However, highly 
qualified poison experts enter NPDS 
data using strict quality controls 
and case follow-up methods. 
Despite its limitations, the NPDS 
is an appropriate and informative 
data source for research on 
buprenorphine exposures among US 
children. Although population-based 
rates were calculated, these rates 
were not adjusted for increasing 
buprenorphine prescriptions or sales 
during the study period; we did not 
have access to these data.
CONCLUSIONS
Buprenorphine is important for the 
treatment of opioid use disorder, 
but pediatric exposure can result 
in serious adverse outcomes. 
Prevention efforts should be tailored 
according to children’s age group. 
Manufacturers should use unit-dose 
packaging for all buprenorphine 
products to help prevent 
unintentional exposure among young 
children. Health care providers 
should inform caregivers  
of young children about the dangers 
of buprenorphine exposure and 
provide instructions on proper 
storage and disposal of medications. 
Adolescents should receive 
information regarding the risks 
of substance abuse and misuse. In 
addition, suspected suicide was 
the second most common reason 
for exposure among adolescents, 
highlighting the need for access to 
mental health services for this age 
group.
