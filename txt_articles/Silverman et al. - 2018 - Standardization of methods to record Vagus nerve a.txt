Abstract
Background: The vagus nerve plays an important role in the regulation of organ function, including reflex
pathways that regulate immunity and inflammation. Recent studies using genetically modified mice have improved
our understanding of molecular mechanisms in the neural control of immunity. However, mapping neural signals
transmitted in the vagus nerve in mice has been limited by technical challenges. Here, we have standardized an
experimental protocol to record compound action potentials transmitted in the vagus nerve.
Methods: The vagus nerve was isolated in Balb/c and B6.129S mice, and placed either on a hook or cuff electrode.
The electrical signals from the vagus nerve were digitized using either a Neuralynx or Plexon data acquisition
system. Changes in the vagus nerve activity in response to anesthesia, feeding and administration of bacterial
endotoxin were analyzed.
Results: We have developed an electrophysiological recording system to record compound action potentials from
the cervical vagus nerve in mice. Cuff electrodes significantly reduce background noise and increase the signal to
noise ratio as compared to hook electrodes. Baseline vagus nerve activity varies in response to anesthesia depth
and food intake. Analysis of vagus neurograms in different mouse strains (Balb/c and C57BL/6) reveal no significant
differences in baseline activity. Importantly, vagus neurogramactivity in wild type and TLR4 receptor knock out mice
exhibits receptor dependency of endotoxin mediated signals.
Conclusions: These methods for recording vagus neurogram in mice provide a useful tool to further delineate the
role of vagus neural pathways in a standardized murine disease model.

Background
Neural reflex circuits maintain physiological homeo-
stasis by regulating the function of organ systems.
Recent advances in neuroscience and immunology
have revealed that neural reflexes also provide func-
tional control over immune responses. This neural
mediated immune regulation has evolutionary origin
in worms with primitive neural and immune systems
(Tracey, 2002; Andersson & Tracey, 2012; Styer et al.,
2008). We have previously mapped a neural circuit,
termed “the inflammatory reflex”, that is activated
during infection, inflammation and injury when in-
creasing levels of inflammatory mediators are sensed
by the afferent vagus nerve (Tracey, 2002; Andersson
&
Tracey,
2012).
The
ascending
information
is
relayed to the brainstem; and the resulting efferent
response is mediated by the vagus nerve to the
spleen and other organs (Rosas-Ballina et al., 2008).
In spleen, these neural signals terminate on acetyl-
choline producing T cells (TChAT) to release acetyl-
choline
(Rosas-Ballina
et
al.,
2011).
Binding
of
acetylcholine to its cognate receptor, α-7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), on cytokine pro-
ducing cells inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-kB
and inflammasome activation, and suppresses cyto-
kine production (Wang et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2014).

 Activation of the inflammatory reflex by direct electrical
stimulation of the vagus nerve significantly attenuates
cytokine release and ameliorates inflammation-mediated
injury in endotoxemia, sepsis, colitis, and pre-clinical ani-
mal models of inflammatory diseases (Borovikova et al.,
2000; Huston et al., 2008; van Westerloo & Giebelen,
2005; Ghia et al., 2006; Bernik et al., 2002; Levine et al.,
2014). Recent clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and Crohn’s disease indicate that stimulation of
the inflammatory reflex significantly improves disease ac-
tivity scores (Koopman et al., 2016; Bonaz et al., 2016).
Prior work demonstrated that afferent vagus nerve
fibers play an important role in immune-to-brain
communication
(Tracey,
2002).
Sub-diaphragmatic
vagotomy prevents fever and sickness behavior after
intraperitoneal
administration
of
either
cytokine
interleukin-1β
(IL1β)
or
lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)
(Watkins et al., 2015; Watkins et al., 1995; Watkins et
al., 1994; Milligan et al., 1997; Gaykema et al., 1995;
Hansen & Krueger, 1997). Further, binding of IL1β to
glomus cells of vagus paraganglia results in activation
of afferent vagus nerve signals (Goehler et al., 1997;
Goehler et al., 1999). Intraperitoneal IL1β or LPS ad-
ministration induce the expression of the activation
marker c-Fos in vagal primary afferent neurons, indi-
cating that cytokines activate vagus afferents and relay
this information to the brain (Goehler et al., 1998;
Gaykema et al., n.d.). Direct electrophysiogical record-
ings of compound action potentials in the vagus nerve
have identified afferent and efferent activity following
administration of IL1 (Niijima et al., 1991). Intraportal
administration of IL1β increases the afferent activity
in the hepatic vagus nerve, and reflex activation of ef-
ferent activity in the splenic nerve (Niijima, 1996).
Hepatic vagotomy inhibits this reflex activation of the
splenic nerve indicating that the hepatic vagus stimu-
lated by IL1β in the portal venous blood initiates a re-
flex regulation of the splenic nerve (Niijima, 1996;
Niijima et al., 1995). Together, these studies indicate
that the vagus nerve responds to cytokines and trans-
mits that information to the brainstem.
To date, development of neural recording techniques
for rodent research has been limited. Here, we have
developed an electrophysiological recording system to
record compound action potentials (CAPs) from the
cervical vagus nerve in mice and observed compound
neurograms that vary in response to anesthesia, feed-
ing, and administration of bacterial endotoxin (LPS).
Methods
Animals
All experimental protocols were approved by the Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the
Feinstein Institute for Medical Research,
Northwell
Health, which follows the NIH guidelines for ethical
treatment of animals. Male Balb/c and B6.129S mice
were purchased from Charles River and Jackson Labs
and used between 8 and 16 weeks of age. TLR4 knock-
out mice (TLR4 KO) were bred at the Feinstein Institute
for Medical Research and used between the same age
range. Mice were housed under reverse day/light cycle
and had access to food and water ad libitum. In studies
examining effect of food intake on vagus nerve activity,
food was withheld for the 3–4 h prior to nerve record-
ing; animals continued to have access to water.
Electrode fabrication
The hook electrodes with three leads were fabricated in-
house (Fig. 1a). The hook electrode was fabricated with
three 6.5 cm (hooks) and one 8 cm piece (ground) of
0.38 mm of silver wires soldered to the EIB. Prior to use,
the hook electrode along with the ground were cleaned
with bleach for 1 h to corrode the silver, and improve the
contact with the nerve. In between experiments, the elec-
trodes were cleaned with either 1 N hydrochloric acid or
bleach. Impedance level of approximately ≤50kΩ was re-
corded in the hook electrode. The cuff electrodes with
two leads were purchased from CorTec GmbH (Fig. 1b).
Prior to use, the cuff was submerged in ethanol to both
clean and strengthen the flexible outer material as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. In between experiments, the
cuff was cleaned with either saline or ethanol. The cuff
electrode showed an impedance level of ≤150kΩ. Each
electrode was connected to the electrode interface board
(EIB), with slots for both the electrode and ground wire
connections. The EIB then serially interfaced with the
acquisition system through a head stage.
Surgical isolation of cervical vagus nerve
Mice were induced in a supine position with general
anesthesia using isoflurane at 2.5% in 100% oxygen, and
maintained at 2.0% isoflurane during surgery. Once the
nerve
was
isolated,
anesthesia
was
maintained
at
approximately 1.75% during recordings for BALB/c mice
and approximately 1.25% for B6.129S mice. For experi-
ments comparing effects of different doses of isoflurane,
the levels were maintained at either 2.0% or 1.75% or
1.5% in different groups of animals during recordings.
The core body temperature was monitored with a rectal
probe and maintained around 37 °C with a heating pad
and heat lamp. To expose the cervical vagus nerve, the
neck area was shaved, cleaned with povidone iodine, and
a midline cervical incision was made from the level of
larynx to the sternum. The submaxillary salivary glands
were exposed by blunt dissection and separated through
the midline fascial plane to expose the trachea. The left
cervical vagus nerve, located within a neurovascular
bundle with the left carotid artery lateral to the trachea,
Silverman et al. Bioelectronic Medicine  (2018) 4:3 
Page 2 of 13
 was separated from the surrounding tissue using fine
forceps. The bundle is readily identified by the pulsation
of the artery. The cervical vagus nerve, a white fiber
travelling parallel to the carotid artery, was delicately
separated from the artery using fine forceps (size 7). The
vagus nerve was de-sheathed by gently removing the
thin connective tissue surrounding the nerve under
magnification using forceps (size 7S or 7). For record-
ings using hook electrode, the nerve was suspended on
the hook away from the surrounding tissue and the
surgical field bathed in mineral oil to both electric-
ally insulate the nerve and prevent its desiccation.
For recordings using cuff electrode, the cuff was sub-
merged briefly in saline prior to nerve placement
within the cuff.
Recording procedure
The electrophysiological signals were digitized from the
vagus nerve using either a Neuralynx data acquisition
system (Digital Lynx 4SX, Cheetah v5 software, Neura-
lynx, Bozeman, MT) or a Plexon data acquisition system
(Omniplex, Plexon Inc., Dallas, Texas). Recordings were
sampled at 32 kHz and band-pass filtered between 10
and 9000 Hz for the Neuralynx, and 40 kHz with a
120 Hz filter and 50 gain for the Plexon. All signals were
referenced to the animal ground placed between the
right salivary gland and the skin. For recordings with
three-lead hook electrodes, the signals from the most
proximal lead were referenced with the most distal lead
to minimize noise and improve the signal to noise ratio.
The experimenter was always grounded while manipu-
lating the animal during recordings. In experiments with
LPS challenge, following acquisition of the baseline ac-
tivity (10 min), 8.0 mg/kg ultra-pure LPS (Invitrogen,
San Diego, California) was administered intraperitone-
ally, and recordings were continued for 10 min post-
injection.
Neurogram analysis
Vagus nerve recordings (termed “neurograms”) were ana-
lyzed using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronics Design
Limited, Cambridge, England). Raw recordings were fil-
tered using a high-pass filter at 160 Hz followed by a
“smoothing” algorithm consisting of a finite impulse
response filter. Waveform analysis was done on the filtered
recordings using a user-defined adaptive threshold method,
and wave mark parameters (spike shape with a total spike
time of 3 ms). Identified waveforms were manually catego-
rized as neural spikes or other signals (cardiac, respiratory).
The signals corresponding to cardiac and respiratory com-
ponents were manually removed. Neural component with
a CAP occurrence of >3X baseline was then analyzed to
calculate rate and temporal distribution. Baseline and LPS
neurograms were subjected to Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) to 0.0064 s with a Hanning window and 156.3 Hz
resolution.

 Statistical analysis
Data are presented as individual samples, mean ± SD,
and mean ± SEM. ANOVA, Student t test, and Mann-
Whitney U test were used to examine for statistical sig-
nificance. The variance within group was analyzed using
Excel VAR function. P values < 0.05 were considered
significant.
Results
We developed an electrophysiological recording system
to record compound action potentials transmitted in the
cervical vagus nerve in mice, evaluated the performance
of the electrophysiological recording system under vari-
ous experimental conditions, and analyzed the recorded
neural signals to identify stimulation specific neurogram
patterns.
Electrophysiological recording system for the cervical
vagus nerve
Compound action potentials from the cervical vagus
nerve were recorded using either a three-lead custom-
built silver wire electrode (Fig. 1a) or a two-lead com-
mercially available bipolar sling platinum-iridium cuff
electrode (Fig. 1d) (CorTec, Germany). The silver wire
leads are spaced 0.20 ± 0.04 cm apart and the ends are
bent up into a hook shape. The leads in the cuff elec-
trode with 200-μm inner diameter are flat and spaced
approximately 0.10 cm apart. These electrodes are
attached by solder or by cap and pin method to an
electrode interface board (EIB). The electrode-EIB set-
up is then attached to a head-stage that is wired to the
acquisition system. For recording from the cervical
vagus nerve, anesthetized mice are placed in a supine
position. The vagus nerve is then exposed as described
in the Methods; extreme care is taken to prevent any
nerve trauma. The exposed nerve is placed over the
three-lead silver hook electrode or a two-lead cuff elec-
trode (Fig. 1c). A silver ground wire attached to the
EIB is placed between the salivary gland and skin. In
all recordings using the hook electrode, mineral oil
was added to the surgical field to protect the vagus
nerve from desiccation.
Electrophysiological signals were recorded from the
cervical vagus nerve using two different electrodes. The
signals were acquired at either a 32 kHz and 40 kHz
sampling rate (Neuralynx or Plexon respectively) and
referenced to an animal ground electrode as described
in methods. The electrical recording of compound ac-
tion potential is obtained as the voltage tracings of the
neural activity, and termed a neurogram (Fig. 2a and d,
hook and cuff recordings respectively). Using a user-
specified adaptive threshold method, action potential
spikes are identified in the neurogram (Fig. 2c and f).
Signals corresponding to noise, cardiac and respiratory
components are removed to isolate the neural spikes
within the recording (Fig. 2b and e). Neurograms re-
corded with three-lead hook electrode have an average
spike rate of 4.2 ± 0.4 spikes/s for 10 min period (Fig. 3a).
Analysis of 1 min segments revealed that more than
80% of the signal recorded with the three-lead hook
electrode has a firing rate between 0 and 5 spikes/s
(Fig. 3b). Recordings obtained using the two-lead cuff
electrode has an average spike rate of 5.3 ± 0.8 spikes/s
for 10 min period (Fig. 3c). Occurrence rate of 0–5
spikes/s over 80% of the recording was observed in cuff
and hook recordings (Fig. 3b and d). We next analyzed
the signal to noise ratio in hook and cuff electrodes. A
power analysis of the entire neurogram after a 160 Hz
high pass filter using Fast Fourier Transform showed a
significantly higher amount of power in the hook
recordings as compared to cuff recordings (Fig. 3e)
(two-way ANOVA p = 0.0003). While comparing the
frequency components of the recordings, a shift to-
wards frequency components > 250 Hz in the cuff is
observed (Fig. 3e and f). Percent of total power was
significantly decreased at 0-250 Hz (Mann-Whitney,
p < .005) in the cuff, while from 500 to 1000 Hz was
significantly increased (Fig. 3f). This is further em-
phasized when identifying area under the curve, with
a significant increase in power at > 250 Hz (Mann-
Whitney, p < 0.0001, U = 476.5) in the cuff, as well as
normalized
power
(two-way
ANOVA,
p
< 0.0001)
(data not shown).
The effect of isoflurane on the baseline vagus nerve
activity
The experimental protocol for acute vagus nerve re-
cordings requires animals to be maintained under
anesthesia for the duration of the procedure. In general
inhalation anesthesia slows or blocks nerve impulses
and affects synaptic transmission and neuronal func-
tion (Antkowiak, 1999; Antkowiak, 2001; Rudolph &
Antkowiak, 2004). Isoflurane is a common choice of
anesthetic due to its ease of use and easy monitoring
during surgery. Here, we optimized the level of isoflur-
ane that reduces background signals but did not sig-
nificantly
block
spontaneous
nerve
activity.
In
these studies, anesthesia was maintained at three dif-
ferent levels of isoflurane (1.5%, 1.75% and 2.0%) with
an oxygen flow rate of 1.0 L/min. To determine the op-
timal isoflurane level that allows a consistent low firing
rate (0–10 spikes/s) the neurogram data is analyzed
using Spike 2 analysis software. A significant difference
in 30 min neurograms was found between the three
different levels of isoflurane (Two-way ANOVA, p <
0.0001).
Higher
variability
over
30-min
recording
period was observed at a lower level of isoflurane
(1.5%) with a range of 0–127 spikes/s (Fig. 4a).
Silverman et al. Bioelectronic Medicine  (2018) 4:3 
Page 4 of 13
 Increasing
levels
of
isoflurane
induced
a
dose-
dependent suppression of the baseline activity with an
average spike rate over the thirty-minute recording of
35.5 ± 3.6 spikes/s for 1.5% of isoflurane (n = 5), 2.7 ±
0.8 spikes/s for 1.75% (n = 5), and 1.9 ± 0.3 spikes/s for
2.0% (n = 5) (Fig. 4a). Thus, there is a significant de-
crease in total spikes over the 30-min recording period
with higher anesthesia levels (Fig. 4b). Next, we ana-
lyzed the spike rates for the 10-min neurogram. The
low level of isoflurane (1.5%) resulted in higher base-
line activity (34.1 ± 6.2 spikes/s) in the 10-min period
as compared to 1.75% (0.6 ± 0.2 spikes/s) and 2% levels
(2.3 ± 0.4 spikes/s). In addition, significantly higher
total spikes are observed at 1.5% isoflurane compared
to 1.75% and 2% isoflurane levels (Fig. 4c). Analysis of
the variance of the spike rate for each individual mouse
over the 30-min recording period (Fig. 4d) revealed
that the recordings obtained at 1.5% isoflurane level
have a significantly higher variance as compared to
1.75% and 2% levels. Moreover, with lower level of iso-
flurane (1.5%), the animals have high variance within
the group as compared to higher levels of isoflurane.
Together, this data demonstrates that the 1.5% of iso-
flurane fails to ablate the background noise activity
level whereas the highest level of isoflurane studied,
2%, blunted the neural response almost completely. In
contrast, 1.75% isoflurane produced anesthesia while
enabling a low level of baseline activity (2.7 ± 0.8
spikes/s).
The effect of food intake on the baseline vagus nerve
activity
The vagus nerve is the main conduit of a bidirectional
communication between the central nervous system
and the gut. The rich innervation of the gastrointes-
tinal tract by both sensory and motor fibers of the
vagus nerve is essential for normal homeostasis, and
plays an important role in regulating food intake,

 digestion, GI barrier function and immunity (Berthoud
& Neuhuber, 2000; Berthoud et al., 1991; Stakenborg et
al., 2013). To evaluate the effects of the food intake
and digestion on the acute vagus nerve activity, we re-
corded vagus nerve activity in two groups of mice. One
group, the ‘fed-group’
, was allowed to have access to
food till the time of the experiment (n = 8). For the
other group, the ‘un-fed group’
, food was removed 3 to
4 h prior to recording (n = 25). Significantly higher
baseline vagus nerve activity was observed over 10-min
recordings in the ‘fed-group’ mice that were allowed to
have access to food prior to recordings compared to
the un-fed group (p < 0.05, unpaired t-test) (Fig. 5a).
The average spike rate over 10-min period in fed mice
was significantly higher (55.9 ± 2.1 spikes/s, p < 0.05,
unpaired t-test) compared to the fasted mice (5.3 ± 0.8
spikes/s). Significantly higher numbers of total spikes
over this interval was also observed in the fed group
compared to the un-fed group (fed animals: 33,533.8 ±
10,129 spikes, un-fed animals: 7,043 ± 794 spikes; p <
0.05, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 5b). Together, these
findings indicate that food intake significantly modu-
lates vagus neurograms in mice.
Baseline vagus nerve activity is comparable between
different mouse strains
C57BL/6 and Balb/c strains are among the most widely
studied mouse strains in immunology, neuroscience,
electrophysiology and experimental disease research.
C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice differ as Th1-type and Th2-

 type mouse strains, respectively, and respond differen-
tially to innate immune challenges (Kyuwa et al., 2003;
Watanabe et al., 2004). Balb/c strain is often used as
an experimental model of acute inflammation whereas
C57BL/6.129S (B6.129S) strain is usually used as a
background in the generation of knockout and trans-
genic animals. To determine if baseline vagus nerve
activity differs between these strains, we recorded
vagus neurograms in B6.129S and Balb/c mice using a
cuff electrode. The average spike rate over the period

 of 10-min baseline recording in B6.129S mice is 3.9 ±
0.8 spikes/s (Fig. 6a, n = 31) which is comparable to
the average spike rate of Balb/c mice 5.3 ± 0.8 spikes/s
(Fig. 3b, n = 25) (p = 0.53, U = 349, Mann Witney T-
test). Most vagus nerve activity (80%) in B6.129S and
Balb/c mice is between 0 and 5 spikes/s at baseline
(Fig. 6b). No significant difference in the total power of
the 10-min signal recorded using cuff electrode is ob-
served between Balb/c and B6.129S strains (Fig. 6c, p =
0.51, two-way ANOVA). Together, this data indicates
that there is no significant strain specific difference in
baseline activity of the vagus nerve in murine Balb/c
and B6.129S strains.
LPS induces increased rate of cervical vagus nerve activity
We next evaluated the changes in neural activity associ-
ated with inflammatory stimuli by recording vagus
nerve activity in response to LPS administration. LPS is
a cell-wall component of the gram-negative bacteria,
and administration of LPS leads to induction of a
robust inflammatory response in a toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4)-dependent manner (Nijland et al., 2014; Lu,
2008; Poltorak et al., 1998). Changes in vagus nerve ac-
tivity were recorded in wild type mice as described in
the methods. After recording 10 min of baseline activ-
ity, animals received intraperitoneal administration of
LPS. Injection of LPS lead to a significant increase in
vagus nerve activity (26.7 ± 3.6 spikes/s) as compared to
baseline activity (4.1 ± 0.4 spikes/s, p < 0.0001, T = 7.67,
Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 7a and c). Vagus neurograms
from TLR4 KO mice failed to exhibit changes (1.6 ± 0.1
spikes/s) as compared to baseline activity (1.8 ± 0.3
spikes/s, p > 0.99, U = 8, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 7b
and c). Total spike count over the entire 10-min re-
cording after LPS administration is significantly less in
TLR4 KO mice compared to wild type mice (Fig. 7d)
(Mann-Whitney, p < 0.001, U = 00). Together, these
data provide direct evidence that LPS-TLR4 ligand-
receptor interaction is required for inducing changes in
vagus nerve activity during endotoxemia.

 Discussion
Here, we have established and evaluated a method for
recording compound action potentials of the murine
cervical vagus nerve in real time. By optimizing the ex-
perimental conditions to reduce the magnitude of the
baseline activity, the method enables recording of the
changes in vagus nerve activity in response to exogenous
challenges. Multiple factors may affect baseline vagus
nerve activity including electrode design, degree and
type of anesthesia, gut functions, and genetic back-
ground of the mouse strains. Although the spike events
in the recordings obtained with hook electrode and cuff
electrode are similar, the power analysis of the recorded
signal provides clear evidence that the cuff electrodes
offer a better signal to noise ratio (Fig. 3e and f). There
is ample evidence that cuff electrodes offer a stable
platform for peripheral nerve signal recording (Sahin &
Durand, 1998; Dweiri et al., 2015; Durand, 2007).
Inhalation anesthetics have profoundly suppressive
effects on neuronal function. Isoflurane is commonly
used for surgical procedures due to its multiple posi-
tive features. Induction of isoflurane anesthesia results
in less stress, the doses can be monitored or modified
during procedure, and in general isoflurane is easy to
use. However, isoflurane may lead to immunomodula-
tory effects in the experimental models of vagus nerve
stimulation (Picq et al., n.d.). Importantly, isoflurane
induces a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on nerve
activity, nerve conduction velocity and neural network
functions (Detsch et al., 2002; Picker et al., 2001;
Skovsted & Sapthavichaikul, 1977; Lv et al., 2016;
Malinowsky et al., 1995; Sellgren et al., 1994). Here, we
compared the effect of increasing doses of isoflurane
on baseline activity of vagus nerve. Baseline vagus
nerve activity at 1.5% is very variable over time. In
contrast, the nerve activity is significantly suppressed
at 2%. This is in accordance to the previous observa-
tions
that
isoflurane
exhibited
a
dose
dependent
change in the renal nerve activity with a significant
suppression of nerve activity at 2.5% isoflurane as
compared to both control and 1.5% isoflurane (Seagard
et al., 1984). In contrast, a low level of baseline activity
was observed at 1.75% isoflurane indicating an optimal
dose of isoflurane that can be used for recording vagus

 nerve signals without blunting the neural response.
Studies with another inhalation anesthetic, halothane,
showed that increasing halothane levels from 1% to 4%
decreased both hypoglossal nerve and phrenic nerve
activities in a dose-related manner. However, halo-
thane had a distinct temporal response on hypoglossal
nerve and phrenic nerve, suggesting that respiratory
control of the tongue muscles and the diaphragm are
in part mediated by different neural pathways (Nishino
et al., 1984). Moreover, type of anesthetic further
determines the level of suppression of nerve activities.
Thiopental and diazepam but not ketamine induces a
dose-dependent differential suppression of hypoglossal
nerve and phrenic nerve activities (Nishino et al.,
1984). Together, these findings emphasize the import-
ance of selecting an appropriate anesthetic and titrat-
ing the dose of anesthetic for individual experimental
set-up for recording nerve activity.
The vagus nerve is the primary sensory nerve in the
gut-brain axis, transmitting signals related to food intake
to the central nervous system, and play a vital role in
the feedback loop controlling food intake (Schwartz,
2000). Electrophysiological recording studies have identi-
fied mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, osmoreceptors
and temperature receptors in the gut (Berthoud & Pow-
ley, 1992; Cummings & Overduin, 2007; Lal et al., 2001;
Moriarty et al., 1997; Buyse et al., 2001). The sensory
vagus nerve detects various food related signals and
transmits information concerning levels of lipids, chole-
cystokinin, leptin, peptide YY, insulin and glucose to the
brain (Yi et al., 2010) in real time leading to appropriate
efferent output from the dorsal motor nucleus. These
motor signals are transmitted via the efferent vagus nerve
to the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas and modu-
late metabolic and dietary function (Stakenborg et al.,
2013; Yi et al., 2010). Our studies clearly demonstrate that
animals with access to food prior to the recording proced-
ure have active baseline vagus nerve activity that is dimin-
ished when animals are fasted prior to neural recording
(Fig. 5). Gastrointestinal vagus nerve afferents are involved
in the regulation of short-term feeding behavior (Yi et al.,
2010; Owyang & Heldsinger, 2011). Cholecystokinin is
secreted from small intestinal I cells in response to food
ingestion (Polak et al., 1975; Buchan et al., 1978) and func-
tion as a postprandial satiety signal (Weller et al., 1990;
Crawley & Corwin, 1994). Electrophysiological studies
have provided evidence that vagus nerve afferents mediate
signals related to cholecystokinin to the brainstem (Li &
Owyang, 1993; Blackshaw & Grundy, 1990). Food intake
also regulates effects of leptin on afferent vagus nerve
activity (Kentish et al., 2013). Both cholecystokinin and
leptin activate vagus afferents synergistically and mediate
an efferent vagus response leading to inhibitory effects on
food intake (Owyang & Heldsinger, 2011). Together these
studies provide clear evidence that food intake prior to
nerve recordings will influence both the afferent and effer-
ent baseline vagus nerve activity. In experiments designed
to identify activation signals in the vagus nerve in re-
sponse to exogenous challenge, it is therefore important
to not feed the animals prior to collecting neurograms in
order to minimize baseline vagus nerve activity.
Mice are the most widely-used species used as the ex-
perimental models of human diseases due to the avail-
ability of the immunological and molecular reagents as
well as transgenic and knockout models. Further, gen-
etic analysis has revealed that mouse genome shares
high degree of homology with the human genome
(Mural et al., 2002; Chinwalla et al., 2002). The avail-
ability of inbred strains further offers a maximum gen-
etic uniformity. However, strain specific differences
have been reported for phenotypic, behavior, stress-
induced and immunological responses in mice strains
(Van Bogaert et al., 2006; Cramer et al., 2015; Marques
et al., 2011; De Vooght et al., 2010; Crawley et al.,
1997). Spontaneous rhythmic electroencephalographic
(EEG) activity, a hallmark of the central nervous system
activity, varies significantly in different mouse strains
(Franken et al., 1998). Circadian rhythms analysis in in-
bred mouse strains further demonstrate significant dif-
ferences between Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice (Schwartz
& Zimmerman, 1990). Strain-specific differences in
neural serotonergic pathways have also been observed
in Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice (Neal et al., 2009). Further,
naturally occurring variability in anesthetic potency
have been demonstrated in different mouse strains
(Sonner et al., 2000). However, the differences in vagus
neurograms in two commonly used mouse strains,
Balb/c and C57BL/6 had not been previously character-
ized. Here, our studies clearly show that Balb/c and
B6.129S vagus neurograms are comparable. Although
the baseline vagus nerve activity is comparable it
remained possible that the induced vagus nerve activity
in response to inflammatory challenges may differ in
these two strains. Specifically, Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice
exhibit Th2 type and Th1 type phenotype respectively
and respond differentially to stress (Cramer et al., 2015;
Savignac et al., 2011), bacterial clearance (Watanabe et
al., 2004) and various immunological challenges (Wata-
nabe et al., 2004; Marques et al., 2011; De Vooght et al.,
2010; Barone et al., 1993; Gueders et al., 2009). Future
work will determine if there are strain-specific differen-
tial changes in induced vagus nerve activity in response
to different inflammatory conditions.
We have recently demonstrated that the cytokine in-
duced vagus nerve activity can be recorded in real time.
By electrically stimulating or suppressing the vagus
nerve activity with lidocaine or tetrodotoxin, we have
confirmed that recorded vagus nerve activity is a

 function of neuronal activity (Steinberg et al., 2016).
Here, we have established methodologies for recording
stable baseline vagus nerve activity, and recording
vagus nerve activity in real time in response to exogen-
ous challenges such as lipopolysaccharide, a bacterial
endotoxin. Our previous studies using surgical vagot-
omies have verified that the majority of the signals re-
corded on the cervical vagus nerve are mediated by the
afferent fibers (Steinberg et al., 2016) that relay inflam-
mation specific signals to the brain. To study the recep-
tor dependency of LPS-induced responses, we used
LPS-receptor TLR4 knock out (TLR4 KO) mice. Wild
type mice but not the TLR4 KO mice showed enhance-
ment in the vagus neurograms in response to LPS indi-
cating that TLR4 receptor-LPS interaction is required
to mediate the neurogram response. These studies cor-
roborate the previous findings that vagus afferent neu-
rons express TLR4, and that LPS can activate afferent
vagus nerve activity (Hosoi et al., 2005). Together, these
methods for recording vagus neurograms in mice pro-
vide a useful tool to further delineate the role of vagus
neural pathways in different murine disease models.
Conclusion
Vagus afferents innervating the visceral organs including
pancreas, liver, gut provide a rapid and discrete account
of the changes in the physiological conditions in real
time. In addition, the vagus nerve also senses and trans-
mits information about the inflammatory phenotype of
the host to the central nervous system. Selective activa-
tion of the vagus nerve in response to different chal-
lenges suggests the intriguing possibility that vagus
neurograms might serve as a monitoring system for de-
lineating the host’s inflammatory status in real time.
Currently, there are many devices that modulate elec-
trical impulses in the vagus nerve to treat rheumatoid
arthritis, Crohn’s and epilepsy. However, these devices
are dependent on external monitoring and modulation
to alter the stimulation paradigm. This study establishes
methodology for recording vagus nerve activity in real
time at baseline condition and in response to exogenous
challenges. A detailed mapping of the neural responses
in real time could enable development of a ‘close-loop’
system that can record sensory vagus nerve activity and
physiological parameters, analyze the data in real time
and modulate the electrical stimulation and neural
activity accordingly.
