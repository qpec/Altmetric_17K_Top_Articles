Adolescents are spending an unprecedented amount of time using digital technologies (especially mobile tech-
nologies), and there are concerns that adolescents’ constant connectivity is associated with poor mental health,
particularly among at-risk adolescents. Participants included 151 adolescents at risk for mental health prob-
lems (Mage = 13.1) who completed a baseline assessment, 30-day ecological momentary assessment, and 18
month follow-up assessment. Results from multilevel regression models showed that daily reports of both
time spent using digital technologies and the number of text messages sent were associated with increased
same-day attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD) symptoms. Adolescents’
reported digital technology usage and text messaging across the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) per-
iod was also associated with poorer self-regulation and increases in conduct problem symptoms between the
baseline and follow-up assessments.
The majority of adolescents in the United States now
own a mobile phone and are frequently using mobile
technologies as their primarily means of access to
the Internet and engagement with social media
(Lenhart, 2015). Adolescents spend, on average, 9
hours (h) a day using screen-based media including
about 3 h/day on their mobile phones (Rideout, Pai,
Saphir, Pritchett, & Rudd, 2015), and with a typical
teen (the median) sending and receiving 30 texts
per day (Lenhart, 2015). This high degree of connec-
tivity has raised concerns about potential negative
effects of mobile technology usage in particular, and
digital technology use more broadly, on adolescents’
mental health (George & Odgers, 2015).
There are a number of theories about how the
amount of time spent using digital technologies
(i.e., social networking tools, text messaging, and
the Internet) may influence adolescents’ mental
health symptoms, especially for adolescents already
experiencing mental health problems. It has been
argued that spending time online “displaces” time
spent on social or cognitively stimulating activities
(i.e., displacement hypothesis), which in turn may
increase feelings of social isolation or depression
(Kraut et al., 1998; Nikklen, Valkenburg, & Hui-
zinga, 2014). Others suggest that adolescents with
preexisting problems may spend more time online
to compensate for a lack of social skills (i.e., social
compensation); that is, technology related problems
may stem from, or simply reflect, adolescents’ pre-
existing mental health problems (Shapira et al.,
2003;
Valkenburg
&
Peter,
2007;
Widyanto
&
Griffiths,
2006).

 hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression, there
are also concerns that digital technology use may
amplify offline symptoms by, for example, further
isolating at-risk adolescents through solitary (com-
pared to communicative) online activities (Kraut
et al., 2002; Selfhout, Branie, Delsing, ter Bogt, &
Meeus, 2009) and/or leading to problems with sus-
tained attention and focus due to multitasking
(Scott, Valley, & Simecka, 2016). In short, it is possi-
ble that an association between time spent online
and
mental
health
problems
represents
causal,
selection-driven, or bidirectional effects and that
adolescents with existing mental health problems
may be at especially heightened risk for any nega-
tive effects. In the present study, we intensively fol-
low a sample of young adolescents at risk for
mental health problems via a mobile phone-based
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study and
test whether reported digital technology use is asso-
ciated with elevations in same day mental health
symptoms and subsequent self-regulation and con-
duct problem behaviors.
Historically, the amount of time spent online has
been associated with increased mental health prob-
lems among adolescents,
including internalizing
(Bickham, Hswen, & Rich, 2015; Kraut et al., 1998;
van den Eijnden, Meerkerk, Vermulst, Spijkerman,
& Engels, 2008; Ybarra, Alexander, & Mitchell,
2005) and externalizing (Leena, Tomi, & Arja, 2005;
Swing, Gentile, Anderson, & Walsh, 2010; Zheng
et al., 2014) problems. For example, a nationally
representative,
cross-sectional
study
of
approxi-
mately 1,500 adolescents in the late 1990s found
that adolescents who used the Internet more fre-
quently also reported greater symptoms of depres-
sion
(Ybarra
et al.,
2005);
27%
of
adolescents
reporting major depressive symptoms also reported
spending 3 or more hours per day on the Internet
as compared to only 15% of adolescents with minor
and 13% with no symptoms. A recent meta-analysis
of 45 studies found that time spent using electronic
media
(i.e.,
watching
television,
playing
video
games) had significant, but often small, positive
associations
with
ADHD
symptoms,
including
impulsivity and attention symptoms (Nikklen et al.,
2014).
Longitudinal studies have also shown that chil-
dren who spend more time online are at increased
risk for later mental health problems. For example,
the HomeNet study of 93 families found that ado-
lescents’ average weekly number of hours spent
online (as measured by computer logs for 50–
100 weeks) after the Internet was first introduced
into their homes predicted increases in depressive
symptoms 1–2 years later (Kraut et al., 1998). A
more recent 14-day diary study of 82 college stu-
dents found that daily Facebook use was associ-
ated with more negative daily mood and that
greater average weekly usage predicted increased
depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction at
the end of the week (Kross et al., 2013). Similarly,
a longitudinal study of nearly 1,300 children (ages
8–11) showed that time spent watching television
and playing video games predicted increases in
attention problems 13 months later (Swing et al.,
2010).
It is difficult to draw conclusions from past
research about the potential effects of digital tech-
nology usage on mental health problems among
contemporary adolescents for the following reasons.
First, many of the studies reporting associations
between time spent online and mental health prob-
lems were conducted in the late 1990s and early
2000s when only a small minority of adolescents
were online frequently and when online communi-
cation was characterized by conversing with stran-
gers
in
online
chatrooms.
Today,
nearly
all
adolescents are online and primarily communicate
with friends and family from adolescents’ “offline”
lives (Underwood, Ehrenreich, More, Solis, & Brink-
ley, 2015). For reference, in 1995, only 14% of the
U.S. adult population had access to the Internet
and by the year 2000, only 53% owned a mobile
phone and 46% had access to the Internet, com-
pared to 92% and 87%, respectively, in 2015 (see
national data from the Pew Research Center, Fox &
Rainie, 2014). Historical differences are important to
consider when interpreting findings and definitions
as technology usage has changed immensely over
the last 20 years, with greater ease of online access,
modes of contact, and variety of partners and
spaces to explore. Second, research linking mental
health and digital technology use has often focused
on the amount of time spent viewing passive media
(i.e., TV) or violent media (i.e., video games) versus
time spent with digital devices and in more active
forms
of
online
communications
and
activities.
Third, the majority of research has relied on cross-
sectional and retrospective reports of technology
usage patterns and mental health symptoms (with
some notable exceptions, e.g., Ehrenreich, Under-
wood, & Ackerman, 2014; Underwood et al., 2015).
Daily methods, like the EMA (Shiffman, Stone, &
Hufford, 2008) study presented here, are useful for
capturing adolescents’ reported digital technology
usage
and
mental
health
symptoms
“in
the
moment” and for examining the within-individual
coupling of these phenomena over time. Research
Digital Technology Use and Mental Health
79
 with contemporary adolescents is needed to under-
stand the daily interplay between digital technology
usage and mental health symptoms and to test
whether digital technology use during early adoles-
cence predicts later problems. This is especially true
for at-risk adolescents, given evidence of what has
been referred to as a “new digital divide” whereby
more affluent adolescents are reported to spend
more time engaged in online activities with parents
and other adults, which may confer benefits asso-
ciated
with
adult
mediated
technology
usage,
whereas lower income children spend more time
interacting with technology alone or with peers in
unstructured activities, which may carry more risks
(Micheli, 2016).
The
present
study
examines
the
associations
between reported daily digital technology usage
and symptoms of anxiety, depression, ADHD, and
conduct disorder (CD) among young adolescents.
In this study, we address two about high-risk ado-
lescents from from low socioeconomic neighbor-
hoods: (a) Is the amount of reported daily digital
technology
usage
associated
with
adolescents’
same-day and next-day mental health symptoms?
and (b) Does the amount of reported digital tech-
nology usage during early adolescence predict their
later self-regulation deficits and conduct problems?
Method
Participants
The miLife Study used EMA via mobile phones
to track the daily experiences, behaviors, and emo-
tions of 151 young adolescents at heightened risk
for mental health problems (for full study details,
see Russell, Wang, & Odgers, 2015). Approximately
80% of the adolescents reported the presence of at
least one CD symptom (e.g., fighting, destroying
property, use of weapons, stealing), whereas 50%
endorsed three or more symptoms of CD (the mini-
mum number required for a CD diagnosis), placing
this sample well above population-based estimates
of CD prevalence in the United States, which is
approximately
9.5%
(male = 12.0%,
female =
7.1%; Nock, Kazdin, Hiripi, & Kessler, 2006) and
ranges from 4.4% to 9.6% for severe behavioral dis-
orders in more recent studies (Merikangas et al.,
2010).
Participants
ranged
in
age
from
11
to
15 years (M = 13.1, SD = 0.91). The sample was
48% female and ethnically diverse (57.3% White,
23.3%
Hispanic,
4.0%
African
American,
4.7%
Native American, 4.0% Asian, with the remaining
identifying as belonging to another category). The
participants were from low socioeconomic status
neighborhoods. One in three families in the sample
“occasionally” or “often” had difficulty paying for
food or other necessities, 40% reported difficulties
paying for bills, and 8% reported that they were
currently receiving government services or assis-
tance. The University of California Irvine Institu-
tional Review Board approved all measures and
procedures in the study.
Procedure
Adolescents were recruited if the parent reported
the presence of three or more risk factors during a
brief telephone screen (i.e., behavioral difficulties,
inattention or hyperactivity, substance use, or expo-
sure to substances). Parents and their children pro-
vided
their
consent/assent
to
participate.
This
study had three phases: a baseline assessment, an
EMA, and an 18-month follow-up assessment (Fig-
ure S1). The follow-up assessment completed in
spring 2012 when 93% of the original study mem-
bers (n = 141) completed in-person assessments. At
baseline, parents and adolescents both completed a
set of self-report inventories about family character-
istics,
experiences,
and
the
adolescents’
mental
health
problems.
During
the
EMA,
adolescents
were provided smart phones programmed with the
adolescents’ normal schedules to “beep” three times
a day for 30 consecutive days. The morning survey
(i.e., 7–10 a.m.) took approximately 2.3 min, the
afternoon survey (2–5 p.m.) took approximately
3.8 min, and the evening survey (5 p.m.–12 a.m.)
took approximately 8.3 min to complete. The aver-
age response rate across the mobile assessment per-
iod was 92%, resulting in over 13,000 assessments
and 4,329 person days for analysis. At the follow-
up assessment, adolescents’ self-regulation and con-
duct problem symptoms were reassessed. (See Fig-
ure S1 for a diagram of the study design.)
Measures
Daily Digital Technology Usage
Digital technology usage was reported by adoles-
cents each night during the EMA and was measured
in the following three ways. First, adolescents esti-
mated the amount of time they spent using digital
technologies each day, including the number of
hours each day spent: (a) using social media, (b)
using the Internet, and (c) texting. Second, these
three daily measures were combined into a global
measure of “time spent online (hours)” using digital
80
George, Russell, Piontak, and Odgers
 technologies. Figure 1a illustrates the daily reports
of hours spent using digital technologies each day for a
single adolescent and illustrates how the iMean (the
mean of reported daily usage for this individual
across the 30 days) and the iSD (the intraindividual
standard deviation for this individual across the
30 days) were computed for each adolescent. In
Table 1, we report the EMA summary statistics (the
iMean and iSD) to summarize adolescents’ average
daily digital technology usage across the 30 day
EMA. As shown in Table 1, adolescents reported
spending, on average, approximately 2.3 h using
digital technologies per day, with, on average, 1.15 h
spent text messaging. Third, adolescents reported
the number of text messages they had sent each day.
Adolescents reported sending, on average, 41 text
messages per day across the 30-day EMA.
The intraclass correlations (ICCs) were calculated
in a multilevel modeling (MLM) framework for
time spent online (.44) and the number of texts sent
(.45) which shows, for example, that 44% of the
variance in reported daily time spent online was
between adolescents, whereas the remaining 56%
[(1 � ICC) 9 100] of the variance was within ado-
lescents over time.
Two of the measures (number of hours spent
texting and number of text messages sent) capture
usage from mobile phones only. However, for the
reported hours spent on social media and on the
Internet
it
was
not
possible
to
separate
the
amount of time that adolescents’ engaged in these
activities using mobile versus other devices. It
was
likely,
but
not
tested,
that
much
of
the
reported daily social media and Internet usage
occurred via mobile devices, as most adolescents,
and
especially
those
from
low-income
families,
have access to smart phones and report daily
access to the Internet via their phones (Lenhart,
2015). Thus, only two “pure” measures of mobile

Digital Technology Use and Mental Health
81
 device
usage
(reported
time
spent
texting
and
number
of
text
messages
sent
each
day)
are
reported here, alongside two hybrid measures of
digital technology usage (time spent using social
media and the Internet), which may include usage
across multiple platforms (e.g., mobile devices and
desktop computers).
Adolescents’ reported digital technology use was
assessed via daily EMAs
administered
through
mobile phones. EMA offer three key benefits in
relation
to
traditional
self-reported
assessments.
First, most surveys and interviews ask participants
to recall their past experiences, symptoms, and
behaviors across a given length of time (e.g., over
the last “6 months” or “week”). However, recall
bias in self-reported experiences is well documented
(Bradburn, Rips, & Shevell, 1987; Stone, Bachrach,
Jobe, Kurtzman, & Cain, 1999), especially when
reporting on mundane and frequent experiences
(Schwarz, 2007), such as adolescents’ digital tech-
nology usage. Second, EMA allowed for the capture
of reported technology usage in adolescents’ natu-
ralistic environment as they went about their daily
lives. Context has well-documented effects on ado-
lescents’ behaviors (Duncan & Raudenbush, 1999),
and EMA strategies have been shown to both
reduce recall bias and enhance ecologically validity
of self-reports (Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli, 2003; Shiff-
man, 2009; Shiffman et al., 2008). Third, the high-
resolution data gathered via by EMA allow for an
analysis of dynamic processes over time (Stone
et al., 2007), including tests of daily within-individual
coupling of symptoms and technology usage, while
also capturing novel assessments of daily digital
technology usage that could be used to predict later
mental health symptoms.
Daily Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, and CD Symptoms
Mental health symptoms were measured each
day using items adapted for use in the EMA con-
text from (a) diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [DSM–
IV]; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), (b)
widely used symptom scales for child and adoles-
cent psychopathology (e.g., Beck Depression Inven-
tory,
Rutter Child Scales),
and (c)
prior
EMA
protocols developed for assessing children and ado-
lescents’ symptoms in daily life (Whalen et al.,
2006).
Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured
three times throughout the day: in the morning,
after school, and in the evening. Depressive symp-
toms were measured using items modified for EMA
from the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Sterr, &
Brown, 1996). Adolescents responded to five items
measuring symptoms such as sadness (e.g., “I feel
sad”), hopelessness (e.g., “I feel hopeless, like noth-
ing matters”), and guilt (e.g., “I feel guilty for no
reason”; yes/no). Adolescents reported on the pres-
ence (yes/no) of four anxiety symptoms (e.g., “I am
worried,” “I feel afraid”) adapted from the Multidi-
mensional
Anxiety
Scale
for
Children
(March,
1997). Daily depression (ICC = 0.42) and anxiety
(ICC = 0.37) symptom measures were created by
summing the total number of symptoms across the
day. Figure 1b displays the reported depression
symptoms each day by a single adolescent in our
study and illustrates how the iMean and iSD for
the adolescent were computed across the EMA
series.
Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder symptoms
were measured once daily in the after school diary
as the presence (yes/no) of four ADHD symptoms
(e.g., “I had a hard time concentrating/focusing,”
“I felt restless or like I was always on the go”)
using items adapted from the DSM–IV symptom
checklist and used in prior EMA studies with
ADHD children (Whalen et al., 2006). Daily symp-
tom
measures
were
created
by
summing
the
total number of symptoms across the day. Daily
ADHD symptom measures were created by sum-
ming the total number of symptoms across the day
(ICC = 0.35).
Conduct problem symptoms were measured in the
evening diary each day using six items (yes/no)
measuring aggression (e.g., “Today did you hit or
hurt someone?”), vandalism (e.g., “Today did you
damage someone else’s property?”), and theft (e.g.,
“Today did you steal something that did not belong
to you?”), and bullying (e.g., Did you bully, ignore,
say mean
things, or tell lies about someone?)
adapted for the EMA based on CD symptoms listed
in the DSM–IV (American Psychiatric Association,
1994)
and
from
the
Child
Behavior
Checklist
(CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). Daily conduct
problem symptom measures were created by sum-
ming the total number of symptoms across the day
(ICC = 0.22).
Baseline and Follow-Up Measures of Mental Health
Conduct problem symptoms were assessed at both
baseline and the 18-month follow-up using a con-
duct problem symptom scale developed for use in
large-scale
epidemiological
studies
(Kim-Cohen
et al., 2005) based on DSM–IV CD symptoms and
modified
items
from
the
CBCL
(Achenbach
&
82
George, Russell, Piontak, and Odgers
 Rescorla, 2001). Parents and adolescents completed
the measure at the baseline and the adolescent was
assessed
at
the
follow-up.
The
symptom
scale
includes 11 symptoms of CD (e.g., Does your child
get into many fights? Does your child destroy
things that belong to other people?). Each item was
rated on a three-point scale of 0 (not true), 1 (some-
what/sometimes true), and 2 (very/often true) in the
past 6 months. A summary score of the 11 conduct
problem behaviors assessed at both waves was cre-
ated at the baseline (M = 2.46, SD = 2.07) and fol-
low-up assessments (M = 2.47, SD = 2.19).
Symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity disor-
der were assessed at the baseline assessment from
parents’ reports of seven items concerning inatten-
tion, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (e.g., Does your
child often forget what he/she is doing?) using
items derived from the DSM–IV diagnostic criteria
for ADHD (American Psychiatric Association, 1994)
and the Rutter Child Scales indexing ADHD symp-
toms (Sclare, 1997; M = 4.23, SD = 3.19). Poor self-
regulation was measured via adolescent self-report
at the follow-up assessment using the 13-item Brief
Self-Control Scale (Tangney, Baumeister, & Boone,
2004), which rated each item on a three-point scale
ranging from 0 to 2 (M = 10.62, SD = 4.77).
Analytic Strategy and Statistical Models
Analyses proceeded in three steps. First, to test
whether reported daily digital technology usage
was
associated
with
mental
health
symptoms,
multilevel
models
(Raudenbush
&
Bryk,
2002),
specified in Stata version 13, were used to account
for the nesting of days within adolescents and to
estimate within-person associations between usage
and symptoms. Symptom counts were modeled
using a Poisson distribution. Incident rate ratio
(IRR)
effect
sizes
were
calculated
by
exponentiating the fixed effects from the Poisson
multilevel models and display the proportional
change in symptom counts with each unit increase
in digital technology use.
Second,
cross-lagged
multilevel
models
were
specified using Mplus Version 6 to test whether
technology use predicted next-day mental health
symptoms and similarly whether mental health
symptoms were associated with next-day symptom
use. Lagged mental health and technology use mea-
sures were centered around each adolescent’s mean
to remove between-person variance in the within-
person lagged effects (Bolger & Laurenceau, 2013).
Third, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
analyses were conducted to assess whether the par-
ticipants’ reported average daily digital technology
usage during the 30-day EMA predicted poor self-
regulation and conduct problems 18 months later,
controlling for baseline reported ADHD symptoms
(when predicting poor self-regulation) and for base-
line CD symptoms (when predicting later conduct
symptoms).
Results
Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations
of daily digital technology usage and mental health
symptoms among the sample. Adolescents reported
spending, on average, 2.29 h online each day and
sending, on average, 41 text messages. The propor-
tion of study days where the adolescents reported
more than one symptom of anxiety, depression,
ADHD, and CD are also displayed. Across over
4,300 study days, adolescents reported experiencing
at least one anxiety symptom on 32% of days and
at least one depression symptom on 27% of study
days; ADHD and CD symptoms were recorded on
28% and 9% of study days, respectively.

between reported digital technology use and contin-
uous symptoms of anxiety, depression, ADHD, and
CD. Findings from this table illustrate two main
points. First, the amount of time that adolescents
reported spending online on a given day was posi-
tively
associated
with
their
reported
same-day
symptoms of ADHD and CD (b = 0.05, p = .002,
IRR = 1.05
and
b = 0.13,
p < .001,
IRR = 1.14,
respectively). For CD symptoms, there was a posi-
tive and significant coupling of same-day symp-
toms across all five measures of reported daily
digital technology usage, including for number of
texts sent (b = 0.02, p = .01, IRR = 1.02). For ADHD,
reported time spent on social media and time spent
texting on the mobile phone were significantly asso-
ciated with daily symptoms, whereas reported time
spent on the Internet was not. There was no evi-
dence of a same-day association between daily
reports of the number of text messages sent and
ADHD symptoms.
Second, although the effect sizes were small, ado-
lescents reported slightly fewer anxiety (b = �0.03,
p = .03, IRR = 0.97) symptoms on days when they
spent more time online, with a statistically signifi-
cant association between more reported time spent
texting and fewer anxiety symptoms on a given day.
Adolescents also reported fewer anxiety (b = �0.006,
p = .007,
IRR = 0.99)
and
depression
symptoms
(b = �0.008, p = .006, IRR = 0.99) on days where
they sent more text messages, which represent statis-
tically significant but small associations.
Reported ADHD Symptoms Are Associated With Next-
Day Digital Technology Usage
Cross-lagged MLMs were used to estimate the
same (concurrent) and next-day (lagged) associa-
tions between daily reports of time spent online
and mental health symptoms. This model was used
to test for associations between reported daily digi-
tal technology use and the four types of mental
health symptoms assessed during the EMA (full
details of each of the eight models are reported in
Table S1). Two main sets of findings emerged from
these analyses. First, there were significant autore-
gressive associations for reported time spent online
lagged on itself by 1 day (b = .35, p < .001), for
reported number of text messages sent lagged on
itself by 1 day (b = .31, p < .001), and for all mental
health symptoms lagged by 1 day (autoregressive
correlations ranged from b = .14 to 0.27). Second,
across eight models, evidence for a next-day (cross-
lagged) association between daily technology use
and mental health symptoms was found for only
one pathway. That is, increases in reported daily
ADHD symptoms were associated with increases in
next-day time spent online (see Figure S2, path d;
b = .05, p = .006). However, more reported time
spent online was not associated with increases in
next-day ADHD symptoms (b = .03, p = .19; see
path e). No other cross-lagged associations were
statistically significant.
Daily Digital Technology Usage Predicts Later
Self-Regulation and Conduct Problems
Finally, we tested if there were predictive associ-
ations between reported daily digital technology
use during early adolescence and later self-regula-
tion
or
conduct
problems.
Adolescents
who
reported more time spent using digital technologies
and sending more text messages across the EMA
exhibited higher levels of conduct problems at the
follow-up assessment (Figure S3a and b). These
associations held after controlling for baseline con-
duct
problem
symptoms.
That
is,
the
average
amount of reported time spent online and the aver-
age number of text messages sent during the EMA
predicted increases in conduct problems symptoms
from the baseline to the follow-up assessment,
b = 0.31, 95% CI = [.06, 0.57], p = .02, b = .19 and
b = 0.06, 95% CI = [.02, 0.11], p = .007, b = .20.
In addition, the average amount of reported time
spent online during the EMA period predicted later
self-regulation problems, also after controlling for
baseline ADHD symptoms, b = 1.18, 95% CI = [.58,
1.77], p < .001, b = .32. For each additional hour
spent online during the EMA, the adolescent’s self-
regulation score was predicted to increase by over
1 point on the self-regulation score. In standardized
terms, for each additional 1.5 reported hours online
an adolescent’s self-regulation score was predicted
to increase by 0.32 of a standard deviation. The
average number of texts sent across the EMA did
not predict later self-regulation problems after con-
trolling for baseline ADHD symptoms, b = 0.08,
95% CI = [�.04, 0.20], p = .21, b = .11.
Discussion
This study used EMA to examine the momentary
and longitudinal associations between daily digital
84
George, Russell, Piontak, and Odgers
 technology usage and mental health symptoms dur-
ing early adolescence and advances what is known
about this topic in three ways. First, although the
effects were small (IRRs ranged from 1.02 to 1.4),
there was a robust association between adolescents’
reported daily digital technology usage and same-
day symptoms of ADHD and CD. Recent research
suggests that the content of adolescents’ text mes-
sages may also be a marker of adolescents’ involve-
ment in antisocial behavior (Ehrenreich et al., 2014).
Future research is required to test whether digital
and mobile technology usage may mark, or create,
opportunities for offline deviant behaviors.
Interestingly, on days that adolescents reported
spending more time online and sending more text
messages, they also reported fewer symptoms of
anxiety.
Similarly,
on
days
that
adolescents
reported sending more text messages, they reported
fewer symptoms of both depression and anxiety.
The same-day associations between internalizing
problems and digital technology use were very
small (IRRs around 0.99). Nonetheless, these effects
are inconsistent with older research that docu-
mented positive associations between depression
and greater amounts of time spent on the Internet
or social media (Kraut et al., 1998; Kross et al.,
2013; Willoughby, 2008; Ybarra et al., 2005). These
findings are consistent with an emerging body of
research suggesting that the association between
depression and time online may not hold in sam-
ples of contemporary adolescents who may be
using their time online to connect in more positive
ways with their social network (Valkenburg &
Peter, 2009). It is also possible that these adoles-
cents, who were already suffering from mental
health problems, used digital technologies to cope
with or distract themselves from ruminative and
negative thoughts and symptoms. Alternatively,
adolescents may simply be more active online (and
offline) on asymptomatic days. Future research is
required to test whether these findings generalize
beyond this high-risk sample.
Second,
on
days
when
adolescents
reported
experiencing ADHD symptoms they also reported
spending more time online the following day. There
were no next-day
associations from
technology
usage to symptoms. Our finding suggests that
when adolescents are experiencing attentional prob-
lems they may be more likely to use (or overuse)
digital technologies the next day, which is consis-
tent with the idea that adolescents with preexisting
mental health problems may be selecting into more
frequent usage patterns. A recent 7-day study of
college
students
found
that
sleep
debt
was
associated with greater next-day attentional prob-
lems and social media use (Mark, Wang, Niiya, &
Reich, 2016); additional research connecting offline
symptoms and behaviors with daily technology
usage is needed.
Third, higher levels of digital technology usage
during early adolescence predicted poor self-regula-
tion and increases in conduct problems between the
baseline and 18 month follow-up assessment. These
effects fell within small to moderate range (bs ran-
ged from .11 to .32) and are consistent with other
studies showing that time spent using electronic
devices is associated with greater attentional prob-
lems and externalizing symptoms (Nikklen et al.,
2014). Unfortunately, we were unable to examine
whether digital technology usage predicted later
internalizing symptoms, as depression and anxiety
were not assessed at the follow-up assessment. The
findings are novel in that they suggest that the
amount of daily digital technology use during early
adolescence predicts increases in conduct problems
over time and later self-regulation problems. For
conduct problem symptoms this was true for our
aggregate measure of time spent online and for our
specific measure of “text messages sent,” which
reflect a mobile-only form of digital technology
engagement. Given the importance of early self-regu-
lation abilities for later mental health and well-being
(Moffitt et al., 2011; Tangney et al., 2004), it will be
important to test the interplay among digital tech-
nology usage, attention, and self-regulation in larger,
more representative samples and within experimen-
tal paradigms that facilitate causal inference.
This study also had limitations. First, self-reports
of technology usage and mental health symptoms
were used in this study raising the possibility that
shared method variance bias could be driving the
associations. Ideally, high-resolution measures of
digital technology usage across devices would have
been available from both self-reported and more
objective phone record and/or device log data to
help assess and account for same-day recall bias.
The inclusion of objective measures of digital tech-
nology usage in future studies will be especially
important given that traditional self-report assess-
ments tend not to be well correlated with objective
measures of usage, such as phone logs (Boase &
Ling, 2013; Gold, Rauscher, & Zhu, 2015). Future
EMA research with adolescents is also required to
evaluate whether daily reports provide an improve-
ment over traditional self-report data for these pur-
poses. Newer methods of tracking digital online
use across adolescents’ devices should be consid-
ered in future studies, especially for studies that
Digital Technology Use and Mental Health
85
 conduct mobile phone-based EMA on the adoles-
cent’s own phone. This is an important limitation
and area for future research.
Second,
we
were
not
able
to
separate
the
reported time spent on social media or on the Inter-
net from mobile versus other devices each day. We
assumed based on large-scale surveys that most
adolescents are accessing the Internet and social
media from their mobile versus other devices (Len-
hart, 2015), but we did not collect the information
required to determine whether associations between
digital technology usage and mental health symp-
toms differed depending on mobile versus other
forms of access.
Third, study participants included adolescents
already at risk for mental health problems, and it is
not known whether the findings will generalize to
the broader population of adolescents. Although
our focus on at-risk adolescents allowed us to test
questions that are of great interest to clinicians and
parents of children suffering from mental health
problems, replications in larger and more represen-
tative samples of young people are needed.
Fourth, although we examined the association
between digital technology usage and mental health
symptoms over time within an individual (control-
ling for important between-person fixed effects such
as age, socioeconomic status, and gender), experi-
mental work is needed to move beyond our obser-
vational design and test causal theories about the
interplay between technology usage and adoles-
cents’ mental health.
Taken together, our findings reinforce the need
for more research with contemporary populations
of adolescents to rigorously test assumptions about
the potential negative (and positive) effects of digi-
tal technology usage on adolescents’ mental health.
On the negative side, our findings suggest that con-
temporary adolescents’ usage of digital technologies
may mark, or exacerbate, problems related to poor
self-regulation
and
conduct
problems
among
already at-risk adolescents. On the positive side, we
did not find evidence, among this population of
adolescents with preexisting mental health prob-
lems, to support past research with older cohorts
consistently
linking
more
time
spent
online
to
greater depressive and internalizing symptoms. In
fact, when a signal emerged from the daily assess-
ments, it suggested that more time online and
greater online communication was associated with
fewer same-day internalizing symptoms. This may
be explained in part by the nature of the online
activities, as increased time spent online communi-
cating with others (compared to solitary activities)
has
been
associated
with
decreased
depressive
symptoms (Selfhout et al., 2009). More research is
needed to understand whether at-risk adolescents
may be using digital technologies to manage symp-
toms and whether such technologies can be effec-
tively
leveraged
to
improve
mental
health.
Similarly, experimental studies are now needed to
test whether reductions in digital technology usage
during early adolescence can prevent or reduce
future self-regulation and behavioral problems.
