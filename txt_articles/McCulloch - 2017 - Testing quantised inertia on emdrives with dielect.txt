Abstract – Truncated-cone–shaped cavities with microwaves resonating within them (emdrives)
move slightly towards their narrow ends, in contradiction to standard physics. This effect has
been predicted by a model called quantised inertia (MiHsC) which assumes that the inertia of the
microwaves is caused by Unruh radiation, more of which is allowed at the wide end. Therefore,
photons going towards the wide end gain inertia, and to conserve momentum the cavity must
move towards its narrow end, as observed. A previous analysis with quantised inertia predicted a
controversial photon acceleration, which is shown here to be unnecessary. The previous analysis
also mispredicted the thrust in those emdrives with dielectrics.
It is shown here that having
a dielectric at one end of the cavity is equivalent to widening the cavity at that end, and when
dielectrics are considered, then quantised inertia predicts these results as well as the others, except
for Shawyer’s first test where the thrust is predicted to be the right size but in the wrong direction.
As a further test, quantised inertia predicts that an emdrive’s thrust can be enhanced by using a
dielectric at the wide end.

Introduction. – Shawyer [1] demonstrated that when
microwaves resonate within a truncated-cone–shaped cav-
ity a small, unexplained thrust and acceleration occurs
towards the narrow end. There is no explanation for this
behaviour in standard physics because it violates the con-
servation of momentum, and Shawyer’s own attempt to
explain it using special relativity is not convincing, as this
theory also should obey the conservation of momentum [2].
Nethertheless, this anomaly has also been seen in [3],
tentatively in [4] and more solidly by a NASA team [5,6],
most recently in a vacuum, proving that the effect is not
due to moving air.
Their results are shown in table 1
(rows 4–7 and 9–11).
One way to explain the emdrive involves a modification
of inertial mass. The present author [7,8] has proposed a
new model for inertia that assumes that when an object
accelerates, say, to the right, an information horizon forms
to its left and the object perceives Unruh radiation which
is also suppressed by the horizon to the left. Therefore,
a gradient in the Unruh radiation appears that pushes
the object back against its initial acceleration, predicting
(a)E-mail: mike.mcculloch@plymouth.ac.uk
standard inertia [8,9]. Furthermore, this model predicts
that some of the Unruh radiation will also be suppressed,
this time isotropically, by the distant cosmic horizon which
will make this mechanism less efficient for very low accel-
erations for which Unruh waves are of cosmic scale, reduc-
ing inertia in a new way [7]. Quantised inertia modifies
the standard inertial mass (m) to a modified one (mi) as
follows:
mi = m

1 − 2c2
|a|Θ

where c is the speed of light, Θ is twice the Hubble
distance, |a| is the magnitude of the relative accelera-
tion of the object relative to surrounding matter and λU
is the peak wavelength of the Unruh radiation it sees
(λU ∼ 8 c2/a).
Equation (1) predicts that for terres-
trial accelerations (e.g., 9.8 m/s2) the second term in the
brackets is tiny and standard inertia is recovered, but in
low acceleration environments, for example at the edges of
galaxies (when a is small and λU is large) the second term
in the brackets becomes significant and the inertial mass
decreases in a new way. In this way, quantised inertia can

explain galaxy rotation without the need for dark mat-
ter [10,11] and cosmic acceleration without the need for
dark energy [7,12].
The difficulty of demonstrating this model on Earth is
the huge size of Θ in eq. (1) which makes the effect neg-
ligible unless the acceleration is tiny, as in deep space.
One way to make the effect more obvious is to reduce the
distance to the horizon Θ, and this is what the emdrive
may be doing since the photons within it are accelerat-
ing so fast that the Unruh waves they see will be short
enough to interact, at least electromagnetically, with the
metal cavity walls.
The present author [13,14] showed
that assuming that the inertial mass of the photons is de-
termined by quantised inertia and the width of the cavity,
and assuming the conservation of momentum, a new force
is predicted of size
F = −6PQL

where P is the power input, Q is the quality factor of
the cavity, L is the axial length, c is the speed of light
and ws and wb are the widths of the small and big ends,
respectively. This formula predicts that the photons input
into the cavity continually gain mass when going to the
wide end and lose it going the other way (so their collective
centre of mass is continually being shifted rightwards) so to
conserve momentum the cavity itself must move the other
way (see fig. 1, upper panel). Equation (2) predicted the
observed emdrive thrusts quite well, except for the tests
of Shawyer1 and the various NASA tests. Interestingly,
these tests all used dielectrics. In this paper the previous
derivation is improved and the effects of dielectrics are
considered. The predictions are shown, in all but one case,
to be much better.
Fig. 1: The emdrive cavity without a dielectric (top panel)
showing that the centre of mass (CoM) of the input photon
cloud of microwaves is continually being shifted towards the
wide end. So the emdrive cavity, to conserve the momentum of
the combined system, moves the other way, towards its narrow
end. With a dielectric (bottom panel) the photons’ centre of
mass moves towards the dielectric.
This paper considers an
emdrive with both effects.
Method. – We first calculate the collective mass of the
microwave photons in the cavity (mL) from the energy
input by the magnetron, E:
mL = E
c2 .
(3)

 Testing quantised inertia on emdrives with dielectrics
The energy (E) is equal to the power input (P) times the
time that the photons last before dissipating (t):
mL = Pt
c2 .
(4)
The time for a photon to dissipate is the Q factor (num-
ber of bounces from end to end) times the time taken to
go from end to end, so
mL = P
c2 × Q × L
c/n,
(5)
where n is the average refractive index inside the cavity. So
mL = PQLn
c3
.
(6)
Now we consider the conservation of momentum for the
cavity of constant mass mc and speed vc and the light
inside it of mass mL (as above) and speed c which is
d
dt(mcvc + mLc) = 0 = mcac + mL
dc
dt + cdmL
dt .
(7)
The first term on the right-hand side is the force on the
cavity, to be found. The second term, the acceleration of
light, is zero. Note that unlike in [13,14] this derivation
assumes that there is no change in light speed in the cavity,
just a change in photon mass. So
Fc = −cdmL
dt
= −cdmL
dx
dx
dt = −c2 dmL
dx .
(8)
In quantised inertia (see eq. (1)) the mass of the photons
inside a cosmic horizon of radius S would be m = mL(1 −
λU/4S), where mL is the unmodified mass (eq. (6)). In
this case, as in the previous paper, it is assumed that the
cavity walls act like a horizon for the Unruh waves that
are assumed to cause the photons’ inertia.
The previous derivation is now generalised by assuming
there is a dielectric in the cavity, so that m = mL(1 −
λU/4nS), where n is the refractive index of the dielectric,
since n reduces the light speed and reduces the wavelength
(since the frequency is constant) so that more waves fit
within the horizon or cavity. Therefore, changing the par-
tial derivative in eq. (8) to a finite difference, and noting
that a dielectric can change the refractive indices at the
ends to ns and nb (for the small and big ends) we get
Fc = −c2mL

(9)
Since λU ∼ 8c2/a, where a is the acceleration of the
photons as their speed changes direction from c to −c
as they bounce between the two ends of the cavity, then
a = dv/dt = 2c/(L/c) = 2c2/L (see [13,14]). So λU = 4L,
leaving,
Fc = mLc2

In the emdrive, the average cavity size measured from
the central axis at each end plate (averaged from all di-
rections) is approximately (L + 4w)/6 (see [14]), where w
is the cavity width. So, substituting for Ss and Sb,
Fc = 6mLc2

nb(L + 4wb) −

Using eq. (6) for the unmodified mass of the microwaves
(mL) we get
Fc = 6PQLn

nb(L + 4wb) −

Since the dielectric occupies only about one tenth or
less of the cavity’s length then the average refractive index
n ∼ 1, so
Fc = 6PQL

In this paper it is assumed that if one end has no dielec-
tric then ns,b = 1, and if it does, then either ns,b = 1.46
(the refractive index of the polyethylene used in the NASA
tests) or ns,b = 6.16 for Shawyer’s first test [15].
Results. – Table 1 summarises the various experimen-
tal results from Shawyer [1] in rows 1 and 2, the Cannae
drive in row 3 [3], the earlier NASA tests done in air in [5],
in rows 4–7, the vacuum test in [4] and the 2016 NASA
tests done in vacuum [6] in rows 9–11.
In table 1, column 1 names the experiment. Column 2
shows the input power (in watts). Column 3 shows the Q
factor (dimensionless). Column 4 shows the axial length
of the cavity. Column 5 shows the width of the big and
small ends (metres).
Column 6 states whether the di-
electric was absent (–), or at the narrow end (narrow).
Column 7 shows the thrust predicted by quantised iner-
tia ignoring the dielectric (using eq. (2)), column 8 shows
the prediction of quantised inertia considering the dielec-
tric (eq. (13)) and column 9 shows the thrust observed in
the experiments. For the NASA experiments in 2016 the
observed thrusts can be summarised to be 1.2 mN/kW.
A comparison of the results ignoring the dielectric with
those observed shows that the earlier formula (eq. (2)) pre-
dicted the experiments without dielectrics but not those
with dielectrics (Shawyer1 and the NASA tests). It tended
to overpredict the NASA results by up to a factor of ten.
This can also be seen in fig. 2 which shows a compari-
son of the thrust predicted by quantised inertia (along the
x-axis) and that observed (on the y-axis). Accurate pre-
dictions should line up along the diagonal line, but the
predictions using eq. (2) (ignoring the dielectric), which
are shown in fig. 2 by the open squares, are well to the
right of the diagonal line for all the NASA experiments,
which had dielectrics at the narrow end of the cavity, and
to the left of it for Shawyer1 which also had a dielectric
at the narrow end.

Fig. 2: A comparison between the eleven observed emdrive
thrusts (on the y axis) and the thrusts predicted by quan-
tised inertia (on the x-axis) without considering the effect of
dielectrics (the empty squares) and considering the effect of
the dielectrics (the black diamonds). When the dielectrics were
considered, the results were far better (closer to the diagonal
line), except for Shawyer1 where the prediction was the right
size but in the wrong direction.
The predictions of quantised inertia considering the di-
electric (eq. (13)) agree far better with the NASA observa-
tions, but not with the first Shawyer result where the pre-
diction is now the right size but in the opposite direction.
See table 1 and the black diamonds in fig. 2. Quantised
inertia is particularly close for the latest batch of NASA
experiments which arguably had the greatest experimen-
tal controls. This is encouraging given that this model is
rather approximate and does not yet take account of the
resonance modes of the cavity, which should also affect
the results. It should also be noted, in its favour, that
quantised inertia has no adjustable parameters.
Discussion. – Quantised inertia predicts that for a
standard dielectric-less emdrive, see fig. 1, top panel, the
inertial centre of mass of the highly accelerated cloud of
photons being input into the emdrive is continually being
shifted towards the wide end (curved arrow) since more
Unruh waves fit there, so the emdrive cavity itself has to
move towards its narrow end (see the straight arrow) to
conserve the momentum of the combined system.
The
additional effect considered in this paper is the insertion
of the dielectric, see fig. 1, bottom panel, which reduces
the speed of the photons, and the wavelength of the Un-
ruh radiation (frequency being constant) so that more Un-
ruh waves fit in the end with the dielectric. This has the
same effect as widening the cavity at that end, producing
a thrust away from the end with the dielectric.
This is why a consideration of the dielectrics in most
cases improved the fit of quantised inertia to the data. For
example, in the case of the NASA tests, the dielectric was
at the narrow end, thus it reduced their thrust. When the
dielectric is considered, then the thrust predicted by quan-
tised inertia is reduced and agrees better with the NASA
data (see table 1, rows 4–7 and 9–11, and fig. 2). The
exception was the first experiment of Shawyer where the
thrust is now predicted to be opposite to that observed.
More data is needed for comparison, and a more accu-
rate modelling of the effects of quantised inertia is needed.
This analysis for simplicity, assumed the microwaves only
travelled along the axis and the three-dimensional reso-
nance of the waves was only crudely modelled: a full 3-d
model is needed.
This proposal predicts the observations quite well, but
assumes that the inertial mass of photons is finite.
In
defence of this, it can be experimentally shown that they
carry momentum. The inertial mass considered here is a
collective one caused by their confinement in the cavity.
Both eq. (13) and the simpler equation in [14], eq. (2),
predict that the thrust can be increased by increasing P
and Q, and it should be possible to reverse the sign of
the thrust by shortening the usual cavity length (L) or
changing the frequency so that the Unruh waves fit bet-
ter into the short end (ws) than into the wide end (wb).
This thrust reversal may have been seen in recent NASA
experiments.
A new prediction is that the anomalous emdrive thrust
could be enhanced by increasing the overall refractive in-
dex in the cavity (see eq. (12)), and also by inserting a
dielectric at the wide end (see eq. (13)).
Conclusion. – Nine tests in four independent labs have
shown that when microwaves resonate within an asymmet-
ric cavity, an anomalous thrust is generated pushing the
cavity towards its narrow end.
This thrust is predicted well, except for the case of
Shawyer’s first test, by a new model for inertia (quan-
tised inertia) which assumes that the inertial mass of the
photons is caused by Unruh radiation whose wavelengths
have to fit exactly inside the cavity so that more are al-
lowed at the wide end. This increases the photons’ inertial
mass as they travel towards the wide end, and to conserve
momentum the cavity itself moves towards its narrow end.
It has been shown here that a change in the speed of
the microwave photons, a criticism of a previous paper,
is not needed and that the model predicts the data more
successfully, except for Shawyer first experiment, when the
effect of dielectrics is also considered.
Quantised inertia (eq. (13)) suggests that the thrust can
be changed or reversed by altering the cavity’s aspect ra-
tio, by increasing P or Q, by using a dielectric uniformly
within the cavity, or, more effectively, by adding a dielec-
tric at the wide end.
