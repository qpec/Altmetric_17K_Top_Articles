IMPORTANCE Neuropsychiatric symptoms, depressive symptoms in particular, are common
in patients with dementia but whether depressive symptoms in adulthood increases the risk
for dementia remains the subject of debate.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the trajectory of depressive symptoms over 28 years prior to
dementia diagnosis to determine whether depressive symptoms carry risk for dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Up to 10 308 persons, aged 35 to 55 years, were
recruited to the Whitehall II cohort study in 1985, with the end of follow-up in 2015.
Data analysis for this study in a UK general community was conducted from October to
December 2016.
EXPOSURES Depressive symptoms assessed on 9 occasions between 1985 and 2012 using
the General Health Questionnaire.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of dementia (n = 322) between 1985 and 2015.
RESULTS Of the 10 189 persons included in the study, 6838 were men (67%) and 3351 were
women (33%). Those reporting depressive symptoms in 1985 (mean follow-up, 27 years) did
not have significantly increased risk for dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% CI, 0.95-1.54)
in Cox regression adjusted for sociodemographic covariates, health behaviors, and chronic
conditions. However, those with depressive symptoms in 2003 (mean follow-up, 11 years)
had an increased risk (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.44). Those with chronic/recurring depressive
symptoms (�2 of 3 occasions) in the early study phase (mean follow-up, 22 years) did not
have excess risk (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.72-1.44) but those with chronic/recurring symptoms in
the late phase (mean follow-up, 11 years) did have higher risk for dementia (HR, 1.67; 95% CI,
1.11-2.49). Analysis of retrospective depressive trajectories over 28 years, using mixed models
and a backward time scale, shows that in those with dementia, differences in depressive
symptoms compared with those without dementia became apparent 11 years (difference,
0.61; 95% CI, 0.09-1.13; P = .02) before dementia diagnosis and became more than 9 times
larger at the year of diagnosis (difference, 5.81; 95% CI, 4.81-6.81; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Depressive symptoms in the early phase of the study
corresponding to midlife, even when chronic/recurring, do not increase the risk for dementia.
Along with our analysis of depressive trajectories over 28 years, these results suggest that
depressive symptoms are a prodromal feature of dementia or that the 2 share common
causes. The findings do not support the hypothesis that depressive symptoms increase the
risk for dementia.

 A
lzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of de-
mentia, is a progressive disorder. The histopathologi-
cal hallmarks of AD begin decades prior to its clinical
expression1,2; a recent study estimated that amyloid-β depos-
its form over a period of more than 2 decades.3 The long pre-
clinical phase of dementia has implications for the timing of
interventions. There is growing consensus that interventions
should target the earliest possible phase, perhaps the asymp-
tomatic stage,4,5 to be effective. The other major implication,
which has received less attention to date, is the analytic frame-
work used to identify putative risk factors for dementia. When
measured in the years immediately prior to dementia diagno-
sis, these factors are likely to reflect common causes, the ef-
fects of preclinical disease (reverse causation), or prodromal
changes rather than risk factors for dementia.
Thereisconsiderableresearchontheassociationofdepres-
sion or depressive symptoms with dementia. A meta-analysis
publishedin2006suggestedthatdepressionisassociatedwith
a 2-fold increased risk for AD,6 but studies covering the same
period also concluded that depression may be a prodromal fea-
ture of dementia,7-9 implying no causal effect of depression on
dementia. Recent studies using repeat assessments of depres-
sive symptoms have shown increasing symptoms to be associ-
ated with the risk for dementia.10,11 In these studies, depres-
sion trajectories were assessed over 5 years in one study10 and
over 11 years in the other study,11 not long enough to cover the
preclinical phase of dementia. Furthermore, the analytic strat-
egy did not allow depressive symptoms in the follow-up
period for dementia to be examined. Thus, whether depres-
sion is a risk factor for dementia or a symptom of an underly-
ing neurodegenerative process could not be determined.
The objective of our study is to characterize trajectories
of depressive symptoms starting at dementia diagnosis using
a backward timescale over 28 years and compare them with
changes in depressive symptoms over the same period in those
free from dementia. A secondary objective is to assess whether
dementia risk is higher in those with chronic/recurring de-
pressive symptoms in midlife and late life.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
TheWhitehallIIstudyisanongoingcohortstudyof10 308per-
sons (6895 men and 3413 women), aged 35 to 55 years at study
recruitment in 1985.12 Participants responded to a question-
naire and underwent a structured clinical evaluation, consist-
ing of measures of anthropometry and cardiovascular and
metabolic risk factors and diseases. Follow-up assessment in-
cluding postal questionnaire, and clinical examinations have
taken place approximately every 5 years. A postal question-
naire–only wave was also undertaken in between these waves.
Participants provided written informed consent. Participant
consent and research ethics approvals (University College
London ethics committee) are renewed at each contact; the
latest approval was by the Joint University College London/
University College London Hospitals Committee on the
Ethics of Human Research (Committee Alpha; reference
85/0938). Data analysis for this study was conducted from
October to December 2016.
Depressive Symptoms
Depressive symptoms were self-reported on 9 occasions (1985,
1989, 1991, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2012) using the
30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30),13 a well-
established screening questionnaire for nonpsychotic psycho-
logical distress, largely depression, suitable for use in general
population studies. Response options to 30 questions are not
at all, no more than usual, rather more than usual, and much
more than usual. The binary scoring method was used (the 2
least symptomatic answers scoring 0 and the 2 most sympto-
matic answers scoring 1), and so the total score ranged from 0
to 30. Scores of 5 or more defined caseness or the presence of
depressive symptoms.14 Depressive symptoms were also
assessed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale (CES-D)15 on 3 occasions (2003, 2007, and
2012). The CES-D is a 20-item inventory of the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health Center for Epidemiological Studies to
assess the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms
using a standard cutoff score of 16 or greater. Relative perfor-
mances within the cohort of GHQ-30 and CES-D against the
interviewer-administered revised Clinical Interview Sched-
ule as criterion for detecting a depressive episode were simi-
lar; sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 83% for the
GHQ-30 and 89% and 86% for the CES-D, respectively.16
Chronic/recurring GHQ depressive symptoms were de-
fined in 2 ways: during the early phase of follow-up using data
from1985,1989,and1991,andinthelatephaseusingdatafrom
1997, 2001, and 2003.
Dementia
We used comprehensive tracing of electronic health records
for dementia ascertainment using 3 databases: the national
Hospital Episode Statistics database, the Mental Health Ser-
vices Data Set, and the mortality register. The UK National
Health Service uses in-house codes mapped onto Interna-
tional Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems, Tenth Revision codes for dementia. The National
Key Points
Question Does the course of depressive symptoms over
adulthood in those who develop dementia differ from those who
remain dementia free?
Findings This cohort study found that depressive symptoms in
late life but not midlife were associated with increased risk for
dementia; analysis of depressive symptoms spanning 28 years
showed them to emerge approximately a decade prior to
dementia diagnosis. No substantive differences in depressive
symptoms were apparent between those who went on to develop
dementia and dementia-free persons 12 to 28 years prior to
dementia diagnosis.
Meaning The association between depressive symptoms and
dementia in older adults may be primarily due to common causes
or depressive symptoms being a feature of the preclinical phase
of dementia.

 Health Service provides most of the health care; the Hospital
Episode Statistics database and Mental Health Services Data
Set are national databases with information on both inpa-
tient and outpatient care, with the latter also including data
on care in the community. Record linkage until March 31, 2015,
identified 322 cases of dementia: 172 cases were first re-
corded in the hospitalization register, 142 in the mental health
register, and 8 in the mortality register.
The validity of dementia cases in our study is supported
by modeling changes in the global cognitive score, composed
oftestsofmemory,reasoning,andphonemicandsemanticflu-
ency administered to the participants in 1997, 2003, 2007, and
2012.17 These results show accelerated decline in global cog-
nitive score in the 8 to 10 years before dementia diagnosis, as
has been shown in studies that use a gold-standard dementia
ascertainment procedure (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).18
Covariates (1985, 1991, 1997, and 2003)
Sociodemographic factors included age, sex, race/ethnicity
(white and nonwhite), marital status (married/cohabiting vs
other), education (no formal education, lower secondary
school, higher secondary school, university, or higher de-
gree), and occupational position, a 3-level variable related to
salary, social status, and level of responsibility at work.12
Health behaviors included smoking (current, former, and
never smoker), alcohol consumption (categorized as no/
occasional, moderate [1-21 alcohol units per week for men and
14 alcohol units per week for women], and heavy [≥21 units
per week for men and 14 units per week for women]), physi-
cal activity (hours per week of moderate or vigorous physical
activity), and frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption
(less than once daily, once daily, or more than once daily).
Health status included diabetes (fasting glucose level
≥126.1 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0555], a 2-hour postload glucose level ≥200 mg/dL, reported
physician-diagnosed diabetes, or use of diabetes medication);
clinically assessed cardiovascular disease including coronary
heart disease (International Statistical Classification of Diseases
andRelatedHealthProblems,TenthRevisioncodes:I20-I25)and
stroke (International Statistical Classification of Diseases
and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes: I60-I64);
cardiovascular disease medication; and antidepressant use.
Statistical Analysis
Associations between GHQ-30 caseness and participant char-
acteristics in 1985 and 2003 were examined using the t test and
χ2 test. Two sets of analyses were performed, described here.
As there were no sex differences in effect estimates (all P for
interaction between .13 and .98), men and women were com-
bined in the analyses.
Depressive Symptoms and Incidence of Dementia
TheassociationofGHQ-30casenessandincidenceofdementia
was modeled using Cox regression; participants were censored
atdateofrecordofdementia,death(toaccountforcompetingrisk
of mortality), or March 31, 2015, whichever came first. These
analyses were first undertaken using GHQ-30 (and covariates)
drawn from 1985 and repeated using data from 1991, 1997, and
2003, with mean follow-up of 26.6, 21.7, 16.3, and 11.1 years, re-
spectively.WealsoexaminedtheassociationofCES-Dcaseness
in2003andincidenceofdementia.Allanalyseswerefirstadjusted
for sociodemographic measures (model 1), then also for health
behaviors(model2),andfinallyforhealthcovariates(model3).
We then examined the association of chronic/recurring de-
pressive symptoms (never, once, or ≥2 times) over the early
studyperiod(1985,1989,and1991)andlatestudyperiod(1997,
2001,and2003)withincidenceofdementia;covariatesinthese
analyses were drawn from 1991 and 2003, respectively.
Follow-upfordementiabeganin1991forearly-phaseand2003
for late-phase depressive symptoms.
Retrospective Analysis of 28-Year Depressive Symptoms Trajectory
Trajectories of GHQ-30 depressive scores (range, 0-30) over 28
years were modeled using a backward timescale such that year
0 (index date) was year of dementia for dementia cases, year
of death for those who died during the follow-up, and March
31, 2015 (end of follow-up), for all others. The GHQ-30 score
in each of the 28 years (year 0 to year −28) was modeled using
mixed-effects models with the intercept and slope as random
effects.18 Dementia (coded as 1 or 0) and its interaction with
slope terms (time, time-squared, and time-cubed to allow for
nonlinear change) were added to the model to test for differ-
encesinGHQ-30trajectoriesbetweenthosewithdementiaand
all others. This modeling strategy implies that year 0 (the in-
dex date) was the intercept in the analysis and the beta asso-
ciatedwiththedementiatermyieldedthedifferenceinGHQ-30
score between those with and without dementia diagnosis. We
examined whether the terms dementia by time, dementia by
time-squared, and dementia by time-cubed improved fit of the
model using the Wald test. Analyses were adjusted for age at
year 0, sex, race/ethnicity, education, year of birth (5-year
categories), time-dependent occupational position, and
marital status. These analyses on GHQ-30 trajectories were
repeated using the CES-D score (range, 0-60) within a 12-year
time window prior to dementia diagnosis.
Analyses were undertaken using STATA version 14
(StataCorp) for analysis. A 2-sided P < .05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Of the 10 308 participants recruited to the study, data on
GHQ-30 were available on 10 189 participants in 1985 and 6728
participants in 2003; the study design flowchart is in eFigure
2 in the Supplement. Of the 3461 participants lost to
follow-up over this period, 15.3% had died and 0.4% had a de-
mentia diagnosis before 2003. Those without data at the 2003
assessment were more likely to be older (44.9 vs 44.7 years in
1985; P = .04), to be women (41.1% vs 29.4%; P < .001), and not
have a university degree (79.6% vs 70.9%; P < .001). Cases of
dementia accrued mainly between 1995 and 2015, with 73%
of cases recorded in the last 5 years of follow-up. Increasing
age (hazard ratio [HR] for 1 year greater age at study baseline,

 dementia. In effect, this association was evident only when de-
pressivesymptomsweremeasuredinthedecadeprecedingde-
mentia diagnosis. Even chronic/recurring midlife depressive
symptoms,assessedintheearlyyearsofthestudy,werenotas-
sociated with an increased risk for dementia. The retrospec-
tivetrajectoryofdepressivesymptomsover28yearsshowsthe
emergence of depressive symptoms a decade before dementia

at dementia diagnosis. Taken together, these findings are con-
sistentwiththehypothesisthatdepressivesymptomsareapro-
dromalfeatureofdementiaorthatthe2sharecommoncauses.
Thus, our findings do not support the hypothesis that depres-
sive symptoms increase the risk for dementia.
In up to 50% of people with AD or dementia, depression is
comorbid.19,20Atolderages,markersofADpathology21andcog-
nitive impairement22 have been shown to be associated with
subsequent depressive symptoms and the presence of depres-
sivesymptomswithsubsequentacceleratedcognitivedecline.23
It has been hypothesized that depression increases the risk for
dementiathroughhyperactivityofthehypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis24; prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids in per-
sons with depression would lead to hippocampal atrophy and
development of dementia.25 However, there is limited support
for this hypothesis in relation to hippocampal and amygdalar
volume26 or other neuropathologic markers.23
Datafrommeta-analysesofprospectivestudieshavefound
depressive symptoms in late life to be associated with an ap-
proximate 2-fold increase in the risk for dementia.6,27 None-
theless, these findings are compatible with several alternative
explanations: a causal effect of depressive symptoms, depres-
sionbeingaprodromalfeature,andcommoncauses.Totestthe
first of these explanations, studies have used long follow-ups,
most recently, 17 years28 and 24.7 years.29 It has been sug-
gested that severe30,31 or repeated depressive episodes32 carry
risk, although our findings do not support this hypothesis. The
analytical approach in these studies is time to event analysis,
such as Cox regression where even in studies with very long
meanfollow-up,dementiaoccurringinthefirstfewyearsoffol-
low-up is likely to influence estimates of associations with de-
pressive symptoms. Furthermore, the remitting and relapsing
nature of depressive symptoms is not accounted for in such
analyses. Recent use of a 2-step design where latent class tra-
jectory models on repeat data on depression are used to
categorize individuals and then time to event analysis for as-
sessment of risk for dementia shows higher risk for dementia
inthosewithincreasinglevelsofdepression.10,11 Evenwiththis
design,depressivesymptomsinthefollow-upfordementiaare
not taken into account in Cox regression, a limitation ad-
dressed in our analysis of the 28-year trajectory of depressive
symptoms, which models them over the entire follow-up.
The need to assess the risk for dementia associated with
earlier-lifedepressivesymptoms,before60yearsofage,wasem-
phasized in a recent review.20 The evidence from these studies
is inconclusive as studies show no association with early-life
depression,33 and when they do, the use of a 1-item measure of
depressivesymptoms,34self-reportofpreviousdepression,35or
associations seen only in men36 do not allow firm conclusions
tobedrawn.Ourresultswithdepressivesymptomsassessedonce
(Table2),3timesbeforeage60years(Table3),oratage50years
(eTable 1 in the Supplement) provide no robust evidence of
increased risk for dementia. A complementary analytic frame-
work,reflectedinouranalysisofdepressivetrajectoriesover28
years,uptotheyearofdementiadiagnosisisnovelandsuggests
that a rapid increase in depressive symptoms over 10 years
before dementia diagnosis may be the primary explanation for
the association of depressive symptoms and dementia at older
ages. One previous study used a similar analytic approach in a
cohort of adults 65 years and older followed up for 14 years to
assess prodromal changes in AD and showed the emergence of
depressive symptoms 8 years before diagnosis.18
Besides the prodromal explanation, it is possible that risk
factors common to both depression and dementia explain the
observedassociationbetweentheseconditions.Impairmentin
memory,sleepdisturbances,andimpairedsocialfunctioningare
common to both conditions and common pathophysiological
pathways, such as neurodegeneration, inflammation, vascular
risk factors, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregu-
lation, may well explain their association. Irrespective of the

Conclusions
Depression is common at older ages and often comorbid with
many chronic diseases, and it is associated with greater risk
for mortality, higher health care costs, and disability. How-
ever, our study provides no support for the hypothesis that
depressive symptoms increase the risk for dementia. The ob-
served association between the 2 is likely to be due to com-
mon causes or the effects of preclinical dementia.
