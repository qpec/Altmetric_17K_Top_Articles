Mental and Physical Health of 
Children in Foster Care
Kristin Turney, PhD, 
a Christopher Wildeman, PhDb
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Each year, nearly 1% of US children spend time in foster care, with 
6% of US children placed in foster care at least once between their birth and 18th birthday. 
Although a large literature considers the consequences of foster care placement for 
children’s wellbeing, no study has used a nationally representative sample of US children 
to compare the mental and physical health of children placed in foster care to the health of 
children not placed in foster care.
METHODS: We used data from the 2011–2012 National Survey of Children’s Health, a nationally 
representative sample of noninstitutionalized children in the United States, and logistic 
regression models to compare parent-reported mental and physical health outcomes of 
children placed in foster care to outcomes of children not placed in foster care, children 
adopted from foster care, children across specific family types (eg, single-mother 
households), and children in economically disadvantaged families.
RESULTS: We find that children in foster care are in poor mental and physical health relative 
to children in the general population, children across specific family types, and children 
in economically disadvantaged families. Some differences are explained by adjusting for 
children’s demographic characteristics, and nearly all differences are explained by also 
adjusting for the current home environment. Additionally, children adopted from foster 
care, compared with children in foster care, have significantly higher odds of having some 
health problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Children in foster care are a vulnerable population in poor health, partially as a 
result of their early life circumstances.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Data limitations 
to date have made it impossible to compare the 
mental and physical health of children placed in 
foster care to the mental and physical health of the 
general population of US children.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study uses data from 
the nationally representative 2011–2012 National 
Survey of Children’s Health to provide a descriptive 
portrait of the mental and physical health outcomes 
of children placed in foster care relative to other 
children.

TURNEY and WILDEMAN 
Each year, nearly 1% of US children 
spend time in foster care. 
1 Yet only 
considering children placed in care 
annually dramatically understates 
the number of children ever 
experiencing this event. Recent 
estimates show that between 5% and 
6% of US children will ever be placed 
in foster care, with roughly 10% of 
African-American children and 15% 
of Native American children ever 
experiencing this event. 
2
Children placed in foster care endure 
a number of disadvantages, both 
because of the maltreatment they 
have endured and other risk factors 
associated with their placement, 
including poverty, parental drug 
and alcohol abuse, neighborhood 
disadvantage, and epigenetics. 
3

Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising 
that children in foster care 
experience more depression/anxiety, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), and behavioral/
conduct problems than children 
living with 2 biological parents and 
children living with never-married 
biological single mothers. 
16 Children 
ever placed in foster care, compared 
with their counterparts, also 
disproportionately struggle in school, 
have trouble finding employment, 
and abuse drugs and alcohol in 
adolescence and early adulthood.17

Data limitations to date have 
made it impossible to compare 
the mental and physical health of 
children placed in foster care to the 
general population of US children. 
Data limitations have also made it 
impossible to compare the mental 
and physical health of children placed 
in foster care to children across most 
specific family types or to children 
in economically disadvantaged 
families. 
16 Therefore, in this article, 
we use data from the 2011–2012 
National Survey of Children’s Health 
(NSCH), a nationally representative 
sample of noninstitutionalized 
children in the United States, to 
provide a descriptive portrait of 
the health outcomes of children 
placed in foster care relative to 
children not placed in foster care, 
children adopted from foster care, 
children across specific family types 
(eg, single-mother households), 
and children in economically 
disadvantaged families.
METHODS
Participants
We estimated the association 
between foster care placement 
and children’s health with the 
cross-sectional 2011–2012 NSCH, 
a nationally representative survey 
of 95 677 noninstitutionalized 
children ages 0 to 17 years in the 
United States. 
24 During the survey, 
interviewers first selected a focal 
child and then interviewed the 
household adult with the most 
information about the focal child 
(the child’s mother or father in 93% 
of observations, hereafter referred 
to as the parent respondent). The 
survey completion rate was 41% and 
54% for the cell phone and landline 
samples, respectively, and sampling 
weights adjust for nonresponse. 
The large sample size of the NSCH 
allows for an examination of children 
placed in foster care, a typically 
difficult-to-reach population. The 
analytic sample excludes the 2443 
observations missing data on 
household living arrangements.
Measures
Outcome Variables
The outcome variables include 13 
binary indicators of children’s mental 
and physical health, all reported by 
the parent respondent. These include 
2 general indicators of health: (1) 
fair or poor health (compared with 
excellent, very good, or good health), 
and (2) activity limitations (1 = child 
is limited or prevented in ability to do 
things because of medical, behavioral, 
or other health condition). These 
also include 11 specific indicators 
of health conditions, measured 
affirmatively if the parent respondent 
reports the child has been diagnosed 
with the condition by a doctor or 
other health care provider and if the 
parent respondent reports the child 
has the condition at the time of the 
interview. These indicators include 
the following: (1) learning disability; 
(2) attention deficit disorder (ADD) 
or ADHD; (3) depression; (4) anxiety; 
(5) behavioral or conduct problems; 
(6) developmental delay; (7) asthma; 
(8) obesity (95th percentile or 
higher, only ascertained for children 
ages 10–17 years); (9) speech or 
other language problems (including 
stuttering or stammering); (10) 
hearing problems; and (11) vision 
problems that cannot be corrected 
with standard glasses or contact 
lenses.
Explanatory Variables
The primary explanatory variable, 
foster care placement, is a binary 
indicator that the parent respondent 
answered affirmatively to the 
following question: “Is [focal child] 
currently in foster care? That is, are 
you or another adult in the household 
acting as a foster parent to [focal 
child] under the supervision of a state 
or county child welfare agency?” In 
addition to measuring current foster 
care placement, we also included 
a binary variable indicating that 
the child was placed in foster care 
before being legally adopted. A series 
of binary variables also indicate 
household living arrangements 
constructed from the household 
roster, the list of individuals 
living in the household and their 
relationship to the focal child. These 
mutually exclusive household living 
arrangements are as follows: (1) 
married biological parents; (2) 
cohabiting biological parents; (3) 
married step-parents; (4) cohabiting 
step-parents; (5) single mother; (6) 
single father; (7) only grandparents; 
(8) grandparents and parents; (9) 
only relatives; (10) relatives and 
parents; (11) nonrelatives; and (12) 
other complex family. Importantly, 
foster care placement (and adoption

from foster care) supersede the 
measures of household living 
arrangements. For example, a child 
placed in foster care with a single 
mother is coded as being placed in 
foster care.
Covariates
The multivariate analyses adjusted 
for variables commonly used when 
estimating children’s health. 
16, 
 
25 
– 
27 
Child characteristics include the 
following: age (a continuous measure 
ranging from 0–17 years), sex 
(1 = girl), birth weight (1 = born 
<2500 g), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, 
Hispanic, non-Hispanic other race), 
and nativity status (1 = first- or 
second-generation immigrant). 
Household characteristics include 
the following: mother’s age (age 
20–29 years, age 30–39 years, 
age 40–49 years, ≥50 years), 
parent’s educational attainment 
(less than high school, high school 
diploma, postsecondary education), 
parent’s unemployment status (1 = 
unemployed), economic hardship 
(1 = family often has difficulty getting 
by on its income), welfare receipt 
(1 = household member receives 
welfare), Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, 
and Children (WIC) receipt (1 = 
household member receives WIC), 
poverty (1 = household income below 
the poverty line), home ownership 
(1 = parent owns home), child’s 
health insurance (private insurance, 
public insurance, no insurance), 
child’s health care access (1 = saw 
doctor in past year), parent’s health 
(1 = fair or poor health), child’s 
exposure to smoking (1 = household 
member smokes inside home), and 
neighborhood safety (1 = not always 
safe for child). Importantly, for 
children placed in foster care, these 
household characteristics represent 
the characteristics of the foster family 
and not the family of origin.
Statistical Analyses
 
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics 
of all variables.  
Table 2 presents 
frequencies of outcome variables by 
foster care placement. In  
Table 3, 
logistic regression models estimate 
children’s health as a function of 
foster care placement (temporarily 
excluding children adopted from 
foster care). Model 1 estimates the 
unadjusted association, Model 2 
adjusts for child characteristics, 
and Model 3 adjusts for both child 
and household characteristics. 
Because children placed in foster 
care experienced difficulties in their 
families of origin, 
 
3, 
22 which are not 
captured due to data limitations, 
Model 3 provides a conservative 
test of the association between 
foster care placement and children’s 
health. In  
Table 4, logistic regression 
models estimate children’s health as 
a function of foster care placement, 
comparing children placed in foster 
care to children adopted from foster 
care and children across a variety 
of household living arrangements 
(eg, single-mother households). 
Providing these family-level 
comparisons is essential for showing 
pediatricians how the health and 
wellbeing of children in foster care 
compares to children in other sorts 
of family arrangements. Finally, 
in  
Table 5, logistic regression 
models estimate children’s health, 
comparing children placed in foster 
care to children in the following 
groups: (1) children in households 
with income below the poverty 
line; (2) children in households 
receiving welfare; (3) children 
with public health insurance; (4) 
children with no health insurance; 
(5) children of parents who have 
less than a high school diploma; 
(6) children with unemployed 
parents; (7) children living in not 
always safe neighborhoods; and (8) 
children with ≥3 of these indicators 
of socioeconomic status (SES) 
disadvantage. In  
Tables 4 and  
5, we 
present models that adjust for both 
child and household characteristics 
(the equivalent of Model 3 in 
Table 3).
All analyses were conducted in 
Stata version 14.1 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX). 
28 The median 
control variable was missing 2% 
of observations, and we imputed 
missing values with multiple 
imputation. All analyses account 
for the complex sampling design 
(including sampling weights, stratum, 
and primary sampling units). This 
study was deemed exempt from 
human subjects research by the 
institutional review boards at the 
University of California, Irvine and 
Cornell University.
RESULTS
 
Table 1 presents weighted 
descriptive statistics of all dependent, 
independent, and control variables 
included in the analyses. In the full 
sample, 3.2% of parents reported 
their child was in fair or poor health, 
and 4.9% of parents reported their 
child had an activity limitation. In 
terms of specific health conditions, 
obesity was most commonly reported 
(15.8% of children), followed by 
asthma (8.8%), learning disability 
(7.9%), ADD/ADHD (7.7%), and 
speech problems (4.8%). A total 
of 0.5% of children were placed in 
foster care (and an additional 0.8% 
were legally adopted from foster 
care).
 
Table 2 shows vast descriptive 
differences between the health 
of children placed and not placed 
in foster care. Children placed in 
foster care, compared with their 
counterparts, were more likely to 
be in fair or poor health (4.2% vs 
3.1%) and have activity limitations 
(9.8% vs 4.8%). Children placed in 
foster care were twice as likely to 
have learning disabilities (14.7% 
vs 7.6%), developmental delays 
(7.3% vs 3.4%), asthma (18.0% vs 
8.7%), obesity (24.1% vs 15.7%), 
and speech problems (11.2% vs

4.7%). They were 3 times as likely to 
have ADD/ADHD (21.8% vs 7.4%), 
hearing problems (3.9% vs 1.2%), 
and vision problems (3.4% vs 1.3%); 
5 times as likely to have anxiety 
(14.2% vs 3.1%); 6 times as likely to 
have behavioral problems (17.5% vs 
2.9%); and 7 times as likely to have 
depression (14.2% vs 2.0%).
 
Table 3 presents results from 
logistic regression models. Model 
1, the unadjusted model, shows 
that children placed in foster care, 
compared with their counterparts 
not placed in foster care, have 
higher odds of experiencing 9 of 
the 13 outcome variables. These 
statistically significant associations 
remain in Model 2, which adjusts 
for child characteristics. Finally, in 
Model 3, which adjusts for household 
characteristics, children placed in 
foster care have a greater likelihood 
of ADD/ADHD (odds ratio [OR] = 
3.00; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 1.91–4.71), depression 
(OR = 4.92; 95% CI = 2.63–9.18), 
anxiety (OR = 3.94; 95% 
CI = 2.36–6.60), behavioral or 
conduct problems (OR = 4.22; 
95% CI = 2.59–6.88), and speech 
or other language problems 
(OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.01–3.61) 
than their counterparts. Therefore, 
in these conservative models, the 
differences between children placed 
and not placed in foster care are most 
apparent for mental health outcomes.
 
Table 4 presents results from 
the logistic regression models 
that compare children placed 
in foster care to other children 
across a variety of household 
living arrangements, adjusting for 
an array of child and household 
characteristics (see Supplemental 
Table 6 for frequencies). These 
analyses show that children placed in 
foster care, compared with children 
in nearly all other types of household 
living arrangements, have a greater 
likelihood of having mental health 
problems, including ADD/ADHD, 
depression, anxiety, and behavioral 
or conduct problems. For example, 
compared with children placed in 
foster care, children have a lower 
likelihood of ADHD when they are in 
households with married biological 
parents (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.13–
0.33), cohabiting biological parents 
(OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.12–0.38), 
married step-parents (OR = 0.39; 
95% CI = 0.23–0.67), cohabiting 
step-parents (OR = 0.40; 95% CI = 
0.23–0.71), single mothers (OR = 
0.29; 95% CI = 0.18–0.48), single 
fathers (OR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.11–
0.35), grandparents and parents 
(OR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.17–0.48), 
relatives and parents (OR = 0.26; 
95% CI = 0.15–0.45), nonrelatives 
(OR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.15–0.51), and 
other complex families (OR = 0.39; 
95% CI = 0.21–0.72). There are few 
differences in fair or poor health, 
learning disability, developmental 
delay, asthma, obesity, speech 
problems, hearing problems, vision 
problems, and activity limitations 
between children placed in foster 
care and children in most other 
household living arrangements.
 
Table 5 presents results from 
the logistic regression models 
that compare children placed 
in foster care to children who 
experience 8 types of socioeconomic 
disadvantages, again adjusting for 
an array of child and household 
characteristics (see Supplemental 
Table 7 for frequencies). These 
analyses show that children placed in 
foster care, compared with children

who experience socioeconomic 
disadvantages, have a greater 
likelihood of having mental health 
problems. For example, compared 
with children who experience 
≥3 indicators of socioeconomic 
disadvantage, children placed in 
foster care have a greater likelihood 
of ADD/ADHD (OR = 3.13; 95% CI = 
1.91–5.13), depression (OR = 4.78; 
95% CI = 2.47–9.25), anxiety 
(OR = 3.67; 95% CI = 2.11–6.39), and 
behavioral or conduct problems 
(OR = 4.14; 95% CI = 2.44–7.03).
DISCUSSION
Foster care placement is a common 
event for US children, 
 
2 yet no 
previous research had considered 
how the mental and physical health 
of children in foster care compared 
with children in the general 
population not in foster care. 
22 In 
a similar vein, research that had 
compared children in foster care 
to other children in the population 
had focused initially only on a small 
number of types of households 
and did not consider comparisons 
with children in economically 
disadvantaged families. 
16 The goal 
of this article was to document the 
differences in mental and physical 
health outcomes of children placed 
in foster care to outcomes of 
children not placed in foster care, 
children adopted from foster care, 
children across specific family 
types, and children in economically 
disadvantaged families by using the 
2011–2012 NSCH.
The results support 3 key 
conclusions. First, children placed 
in foster care had more mental 
and physical health conditions 
than children not placed in foster 
care. For instance, these children 
were about twice as likely to have 
a learning disability and 3 times 
as likely to have ADD or ADHD. 
They were also roughly twice as 
likely to have asthma and speech 
problems and 3 times as likely to 
have hearing problems and vision 
problems. Differences were even 
more substantial for other mental 
health conditions; they were 5 times 
as likely to have anxiety, 6 times as 
likely to have behavioral problems, 
and 7 times as likely to have 
depression.
Second, although some of the mental 
and physical health differences of 
children in foster care compared 
with other children were explained 
by characteristics of these children 
and their households, many of 
the differences in mental health 
persisted after adjusting for these 
child and household characteristics, 
suggesting possible effects of foster 
care placement on mental health. 
However, unlike much other research 
in this area, our primary goal was

Each row represents a separate dependent variable. OR for foster care placement presented (1 = placed in foster care, 0 = not placed in foster care). Children adopted from foster care 
(N = 1075) excluded from table. Model 2 adjusts for the following: child age, child is a girl, child born low birth weight, child race/ethnicity, and child fi
 rst- or second-generation immigrant. 
Model 3 adjusts for all variables in Model 2 and the following: mother age, parent highest educational attainment, parent married to child's biological father, parent unemployed, family 
often has diffi
 culty getting by on its income, household member receives welfare, household member receives WIC, household income below the poverty line, parent owns home, child 
health insurance, child saw doctor in past year, parent in fair or poor health, household member smokes inside home, and neighborhood not always safe for child. All analyses account 
for the sampling design.

Across each outcome variable, the reference category is children who were neither placed in foster care nor adopted from foster care. All models adjust for the following: child age, child is a girl, child born low birth weight, child race/ethnicity, 
child fi
 rst- or second-generation immigrant, mother age, parent highest educational attainment, parent married to child's biological father, parent unemployed, family often has diffi
 culty getting by on its income, household member receives welfare, 
household member receives WIC, household income below the poverty line, parent owns home, child health insurance, child saw doctor in past year, parent in fair or poor health, household member smokes inside home, and neighborhood not 
always safe for child. All analyses account for the sampling design.
a Coeffi
 cient is statistically different from “adopted from foster care” coeffi
 cient (P < .05).

Across each outcome variable, the reference category is children who were neither placed in foster care nor adopted from foster care. All models adjust for the following: child age, child is a girl, child born low birth weight, child race/ethnicity, 
child fi
 rst- or second-generation immigrant, mother age, parent highest educational attainment, parent married to child's biological father, parent unemployed, family often has diffi
 culty getting by on its income, household member receives welfare, 
household member receives WIC, household income below the poverty line, parent owns home, child health insurance, child saw doctor in past year, parent in fair or poor health, household member smokes inside home, and neighborhood not 
always safe for child. All analyses account for the sampling design.

care placement has an effect on 
children.

–33 Rather, our goal was to 
use these large and representative 
cross-sectional data to provide a 
descriptive portrait of the health of 
children in foster care relative to 
other children.
Third, children placed in foster 
care were in poor mental and 
physical health relative to children 
in virtually every other type of 
family situation and in children 
in economically disadvantaged 
families. The differences in mental 
health outcomes (ADD/ADHD, 
depression, anxiety, behavioral or 
conduct problems) were statistically 
significant. The differences in 
physical health outcomes, although 
sometimes substantial, were not 
statistically significant. Additionally, 
the results show that children 
adopted from foster care had worse 
health than their counterparts placed 
in foster care. These differences could 
be driven partially by the fact that 
children in foster care only become 
available for adoption after parental 
rights have been terminated (and 
therefore these children have likely 
experienced more maltreatment than 
children who remain in the system) 
or because adoption subsidies 
offered in some states encourage 
adoption of children with health 
conditions.
Although this article significantly 
expands our understanding of the 
mental and physical health conditions 
of children in foster care, it has some 
key limitations. First, the data are 
cross-sectional, meaning we are unable 
to assess whether the associations 
shown are causal. We consider this to 
be only a small limitation because the 
core goal of this article was to paint 
a descriptive portrait of the mental 
and physical health of children in 
foster care. Second, some children in 
foster care, including those in group 
homes or those institutionalized (eg, 
juvenile justice system, hospital), are 
not included in the sampling frame. 
Because there are strong reasons 
to expect these children are in 
significantly worse mental and physical 
health than other foster children, the 
differences we show between children 
in foster care and other children are 
likely conservative. Third, measures 
of children’s health are reported by 
children’s caregivers. Although an 
ideal survey design would measure 
physician-reported health and/or 
anthropometric measures of health, 
parent-reported children’s health is 
correlated with physician-reported 
children’s health and is often used 
when physician-reported measures are 
not available. 
34 
 
 
–38 Finally, and relatedly, 
reports of specific health conditions are 
based on caregiver reports of physician 
diagnoses, suggesting that children’s 
health conditions are underreported. 
If children placed in foster care are 
less likely than other children to have 
physician visits, which is likely given 
their relatively low socioeconomic 
status, the differences in children’s 
health by foster care placement are 
underestimated.
These limitations notwithstanding, 
this article makes an important 
contribution to knowledge in the 
field by showing, for the first time, 
that children who are in foster 
care are in significantly worse 
mental and physical health than 
children in the general population. 
As such, they are indeed a highly 
vulnerable population of children, 
something that both previous 
research and their histories of 
maltreatment implied, but that has 
never been demonstrated before. 
This is important information for 
the research community. Yet the 
implications for pediatricians are also 
important because they suggest that 
foster care placement is a risk factor 
for health problems in childhood.
