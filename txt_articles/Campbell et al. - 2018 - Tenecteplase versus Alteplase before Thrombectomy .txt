BACKGROUND
Intravenous infusion of alteplase is used for thrombolysis before endovascular thrombec-
tomy for ischemic stroke. Tenecteplase, which is more fibrin-specific and has longer activ-
ity than alteplase, is given as a bolus and may increase the incidence of vascular reperfusion.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients with ischemic stroke who had occlusion of the internal 
carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery and who were eligible to undergo thrombec-
tomy to receive tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight; maximum 
dose, 25 mg) or alteplase (at a dose of 0.9 mg per kilogram; maximum dose, 90 mg) 
within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The primary outcome was reperfusion of greater 
than 50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the 
time of the initial angiographic assessment. Noninferiority of tenecteplase was tested, 
followed by superiority. Secondary outcomes included the modified Rankin scale score 
(on a scale from 0 [no neurologic deficit] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. Safety outcomes were 
death and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.
RESULTS
Of 202 patients enrolled, 101 were assigned to receive tenecteplase and 101 to receive 
alteplase. The primary outcome occurred in 22% of the patients treated with tenecteplase 
versus 10% of those treated with alteplase (incidence difference, 12 percentage points; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 2 to 21; incidence ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.4; P 
= 
0.002 
for noninferiority; P 
= 
0.03 for superiority). Tenecteplase resulted in a better 90-day func-
tional outcome than alteplase (median modified Rankin scale score, 2 vs. 3; common 
odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8; P 
= 
0.04). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage oc-
curred in 1% of the patients in each group.
CONCLUSIONS
Tenecteplase before thrombectomy was associated with a higher incidence of reperfusion 
and better functional outcome than alteplase among patients with ischemic stroke treated 
within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Research 
Council of Australia and others; EXTEND-IA TNK ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02388061.)

I
ntravenous thrombolysis with alte­
plase is used in eligible patients with acute 
ischemic stroke before endovascular throm-
bectomy.1,2 Alteplase is given as an infusion over 
a period of approximately 1 hour and has been 
associated with a low incidence of reperfusion 
for large-vessel occlusion before thrombectomy 
in several trials.3-5 Tenecteplase is a genetically 
modified variant of alteplase with greater fibrin 
specificity and a longer half-life that permits 
bolus administration.6 In one trial involving pa-
tients with ST-segment elevation myocardial in-
farction, tenecteplase resulted in 30-day mortal-
ity similar to that with alteplase and led to a 
lower incidence of systemic hemorrhage.7 In pa-
tients with stroke, one trial that used computed 
tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging and large-
vessel occlusion for the selection of patients 
showed a higher incidence of reperfusion at 24 
hours and better clinical and functional out-
comes with tenecteplase than with alteplase.8 
Other trials that did not use imaging-based selec-
tion have shown similar clinical outcomes with 
tenecteplase and alteplase.9,10 Tenecteplase can 
be infused more rapidly than alteplase and is 
less expensive. We conducted the Tenecteplase 
versus Alteplase before Endovascular Therapy for 
Ischemic Stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK) trial to com-
pare tenecteplase with alteplase in establishing 
reperfusion in patients before endovascular 
thrombectomy when it was administered within 
4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms.
Methods
Trial Design
We conducted an investigator-initiated, multicen-
ter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-
outcome trial11 involving patients with ischemic 
stroke within 4.5 hours after onset who had 
large-vessel occlusion of the internal carotid, 
middle cerebral, or basilar artery and who were 
eligible to undergo intravenous thrombolysis 
and endovascular thrombectomy. The methods 
of the trial have been published previously,12 and 
the protocol is available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org.
The design, analysis, and data collection for 
this trial, as well as the writing of the manu-
script, were performed by members of the execu-
tive committee and investigators at the trial sites 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). The first author wrote the first draft 
of the manuscript, and the third author per-
formed the statistical analysis. The investigators 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data, for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol, 
and for the complete reporting of adverse events. 
Medtronic provided an unrestricted grant to sup-
port trial infrastructure but was not involved in 
the design or conduct of the trial or the prepara-
tion of the manuscript. A research version of 
RAPID software was provided free of charge to 
trial sites by iSchemaView, which had no other 
involvement with the trial.
Patients
We enrolled patients at 13 centers in Australia 
and New Zealand. Patients were eligible if they 
could undergo intravenous thrombolysis within 
4.5 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke and 
had cerebral vascular occlusion on CT angiography 
of the internal carotid artery, the first segment of 
the middle cerebral artery, the second segment 
of the middle cerebral artery, or the basilar artery 
and if treatment to retrieve the intraarterial clot 
could commence (arterial puncture) within 6 hours 
after stroke onset. There was no upper age limit 
and no restriction on clinical severity as assessed 
with the use of the National Institutes of Health 
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (scores range from 0 
[normal function] to 42 [death], with lower scores 
indicating less severe stroke). However, patients 
with severe preexisting disability, defined as a 
modified Rankin scale score of more than 3 
(scores range from 0 [no neurologic deficit] to 6 
[death]), were excluded.
The entry criteria originally required CT-per-
fusion mismatch for anterior circulation strokes. 
The hypoperfused region was defined according 
to a delayed arrival of an injected tracer agent 
(time to maximum of the residue function ex-
ceeding 6 seconds), and irreversibly injured ische-
mic core was estimated with the use of relative 
cerebral blood flow less than 30% of that in 
normal brain. Mismatch was defined as a ratio 
of greater than 1.2 between the volume of hypo-
perfusion and the volume of the ischemic core, an 
absolute difference in volume greater than 10 ml, 
and an ischemic core volume of less than 70 ml. 
The criteria of CT-perfusion mismatch were re-
moved on October 12, 2016, after approximately 
80 patients had been enrolled, because analysis 
of pooled data from other trials showed a benefit

Tenecteplase vs. Alteplase for Ischemic Stroke
of thrombectomy in patients with larger ischemic-
core volumes.13
The trial was approved by an institutional 
ethics committee at each site, and written in-
formed consent was obtained from each patient 
or a legal representative before enrollment ex-
cept in jurisdictions that allowed deferral of 
consent for emergency treatment, in which case 
consent to continue participation was obtained. 
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Treatment
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive intravenous tenecteplase (at a dose of 
0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight; maximum 
dose, 25 mg) or alteplase (at a dose of 0.9 mg per 
kilogram; maximum dose, 90 mg). Randomiza-
tion was performed with the use of a centralized 
Web server, with stratification according to the 
site of the involved vessel (internal carotid artery, 
basilar artery, first segment of the middle cere-
bral artery, or second segment of the middle 
cerebral artery). All other treatments were guid-
ed by the standard of care for thrombolysis and 
thrombectomy for ischemic stroke.
Assessments and Outcomes
The primary outcome of substantial reperfusion 
was defined as the restoration of blood flow to 
greater than 50% of the involved territory or an 
absence of retrievable thrombus in the target 
vessel at the time of the initial angiographic as-
sessment. Perfusion was assessed with the use 
of the modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia 
classification (scores range from 0 [no flow] to 
3 [normal flow]).14 If no lesion was suitable for 
thrombectomy, the endovascular procedure was 
terminated. If intracranial angiography could not 
be performed, the primary outcome was assessed 
as reperfusion of at least 50% of the involved 
territory on CT perfusion imaging 1 to 2 hours 
after thrombolysis.
Secondary outcomes were the modified Rankin 
scale score at 90 days, assessed centrally by a 
clinician by means of a telephone conversation, 
and early neurologic improvement, defined as a 
reduction of at least 8 points or a score of 0 or 
1 on the NIHSS at 72 hours, as assessed by site 
personnel. Safety outcomes were death due to 
any cause and symptomatic intracranial hemor-
rhage, which included subarachnoid hemorrhage 
that was associated with clinical symptoms and 
symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage that was 
adjudicated centrally by a panel as parenchymal 
hematoma type 2 within 36 hours after treat-
ment, combined with an increase from baseline 
in the NIHSS score of at least 4 points.15 All 
these assessments were performed by personnel 
who were unaware of the treatment assignment. 
An angiogram was obtained at the conclusion of 
the thrombectomy procedure and graded cen-
trally to gauge angiographic revascularization 
and embolization into previously unaffected ter-
ritories. Details of the adverse-event definitions 
and angiographic criteria are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
A blinded adaptive sample-size reestimation16 was 
performed after 100 patients had been enrolled.12 
This reestimation determined a final sample size 
of 202 patients for the determination of non-
inferiority. Sequential testing of superiority after 
testing of noninferiority was planned for the 
intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, but 
no patients were excluded from the per-protocol 
analysis of the primary outcome and only one 
set of analyses is presented.
The noninferiority boundary for the current 
trial was based on a meta-analysis of the 
 
EXTEND-IA (Extending the Time for Thromboly-
sis in Emergency Neurological Deficits — Intra-
Arterial),3 SWIFT PRIME (Solitaire with the Inten-
tion for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular 
Treatment),4 and ESCAPE (Endovascular Treat-
ment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation 
Proximal Occlusion with Emphasis on Minimiz-
ing CT to Recanalization Times)5 endovascular 
trials, in which 19 of 253 patients (7.5%; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 4.6 to 11.5) who received 
alteplase had reperfusion at the initial angio-
graphic assessment. The noninferiority bound-
ary was defined to preserve at least 50% of the 
most conservative estimate of the reperfusion 
efficacy of alteplase from the meta-analysis (that 
estimate being 4.6%).12 Noninferiority would be 
established if the lower boundary of the two-
sided 95% confidence interval of the difference 
in the percentages of patients with substantial 
reperfusion at the initial angiographic assess-
ment in the tenecteplase group versus the alte-
plase group was greater than −2.3 percentage 
points.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
The two-sided 95% confidence interval of the 
incidence difference was estimated by generat-
ing incidence differences with corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals for each of the four strata 
of patients (those with occlusion of the internal 
carotid artery, basilar artery, the first segment of 
the middle cerebral artery, or the second seg-
ment of the middle cerebral artery) with subse-
quent pooling across strata with the use of the 
Mantel–Haenszel method. If noninferiority was 
established, superiority of tenecteplase was test-
ed with the use of binary logistic regression, 
with adjustment for the site of vessel occlusion. 
Incidence ratios were estimated with the use of 
modified Poisson regression with robust error 
estimation,17 with adjustment for the site of ves-
sel occlusion.
The analysis of the secondary outcome of the 
modified Rankin scale score was performed with 
the use of ordinal logistic regression if propor-
tional-odds assumptions were satisfied or, other-
wise, with the use of assumption-free ordinal 
analysis on the full range (0 to 6) of the modi-
fied Rankin scale.18,19 The proportions of patients 
with a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1 (or 
no change from baseline in patients with a pre-
existing modified Rankin scale score of 2 or 3) 
and with a score of 0 to 2 (or no change from 
baseline in patients with a preexisting modified 
Rankin scale score of 3) were to be compared 
between the tenecteplase group and the alteplase 
group of the trial, with adjustment for age and 
baseline NIHSS score with the use of a logistic-
regression model. The proportions of patients 
with early neurologic improvement were com-
pared between the two groups, with adjustment 
for age and baseline NIHSS score, with the use of 
logistic regression. The differences in the distri-
butions of the NIHSS scores between the tenecte-
plase group and the alteplase group at 24 hours 
and at 72 hours were analyzed with the use of 
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney generalized odds ratios, 
with stratification according to baseline NIHSS 
score.18
Results
Characteristics of the Patients
From March 2015 through October 2017, we 
enrolled 204 patients at 12 centers in Australia 
and at 1 center in New Zealand. A total of 101 
patients were assigned to receive tenecteplase, 
101 were assigned to receive alteplase, and 2 were 
excluded owing to withdrawal of consent (1 pa-
tient) and to withdrawal by the enrolling physi-
cian before treatment was commenced because of 
an error in assessing patient eligibility (1 patient) 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
characteristics of the patients at baseline are 
listed in Table 1, and in Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. There were no significant 
differences between the two groups at baseline. 
In 6 patients, the primary outcome was assessed 
with the use of CT perfusion imaging only.
Outcomes
Reperfusion of greater than 50% of the involved 
territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus 
at the time of the initial angiographic assess-
ment was observed in 22 patients (22%) who 
received tenecteplase, as compared with 10 (10%) 
who received alteplase (incidence difference, 12 
percentage points [95% CI, 2 to 21, not crossing 
the noninferiority margin of −2.3 percentage 
points; P 
= 
0.002 for noninferiority]; adjusted in-
cidence ratio, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.1 to 4.4; P 
= 
0.03 for 
superiority]; and adjusted odds ratio, 2.6 [95% 
CI, 1.1 to 5.9; P 
= 
0.02 for superiority]) (Table 2). 
Thrombectomy was not performed in patients 
who met the primary outcome of reperfusion at 
the initial angiographic assessment, with the 
exception of 1 patient in the tenecteplase group 
who had substantial reperfusion but residual 
thrombus that was treated with thrombectomy. 
Of the patients with reperfusion at the initial 
angiographic assessment, 20 of 22 patients in 
the tenecteplase group and 6 of 10 in the alte-
plase group had initial occlusion of the middle 
cerebral artery. Procedural characteristics and 
the incidence of reperfusion according to the site 
of vessel occlusion are shown in Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
In patients who were transferred to another 
hospital, the delay between thrombolysis and 
arterial puncture did not differ significantly be-
tween the tenecteplase group and the alteplase 
group (median, 65 minutes [interquartile range, 
54 to 80] and 75 minutes [interquartile range, 
60 to 81], respectively; P 
= 
0.18). Among patients 
who were treated on-site, the delay did not differ 
significantly between the tenecteplase group and 
the alteplase group (median, 32 minutes [inter-
quartile range, 21 to 50] and 37 minutes [inter-
quartile range, 27 to 50], respectively; P 
= 
0.44).

Tenecteplase vs. Alteplase for Ischemic Stroke
In an ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin 
scale score at 90 days, patients in the tenecte-
plase group had a median score of 2 (interquar-
tile range, 0 to 3), which indicated significantly 
better function than the median score of 3 (in-
terquartile range, 1 to 5) among patients in the 
alteplase group (common odds ratio, 1.7; 95% 
CI, 1.0 to 2.8; P 
= 
0.04) (Fig. 1). There was no 
significant difference in the incidence of recov-
ery to independent function (modified Rankin 
scale score of 0 to 2 or no change from baseline 
function) at day 90, which occurred in 65 of 101 
patients (64%) in the tenecteplase group and in 
52 of 101 (51%) in the alteplase group (adjusted 
incidence ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.5; P 
= 
0.06; 
adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.4; 
P 
= 
0.06).
There were also no significant differences in 
the incidence of early neurologic improvement at 
72 hours (Table 2). The median NIHSS score at 
24 hours was 3 (interquartile range, 1 to 12) 
among patients in the tenecteplase group and 6 
(interquartile range, 2 to 14) among those in the 
alteplase group (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to

Substantial reperfusion was defined as the restoration of blood flow to greater than 50% of the involved territory or no retrievable throm-
bus at the time of the initial angiographic assessment. The analysis was adjusted for the site-of-vessel-occlusion strata. The P value for the 
difference is for noninferiority, and the P values for the incidence ratio and odds ratio are for superiority.

Scores on the modified Rankin scale range from 0 (no neurologic deficit) to 6 (death). A functionally independent outcome was defined as 
a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 2 or no change from baseline. An excellent outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 
0 or 1 or no change from baseline.

§ 
 
The analysis was adjusted for the NIHSS score and age at baseline. The effect size was assessed as an incidence or risk ratio from 
Poisson regression and as an odds ratio from logistic regression.
¶  
Early neurologic improvement was defined as a reduction of 8 points in the NIHSS score between baseline and 72 hours or as a score of 0 or 
1 at 72 hours. An 8-point reduction is considered to be highly clinically significant.
‖ 
 
Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was defined as a large parenchymal hematoma (blood clot occupying >30% of the infarct volume 
with mass effect) and an increase of 4 points or more in the NIHSS score.

score). At 72 hours, the median NIHSS score was 
2 (interquartile range, 0 to 10) among patients 
in the tenecteplase group and 3 (interquartile 
range, 1 to 13) among those in the alteplase 
group (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.9;

Safety
Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred 
in two patients. One patient in the tenecteplase 
group, who also received intravenous heparin 
during carotid endarterectomy, had symptomat-
ic intracerebral hemorrhage. Symptomatic intra-
cerebral hemorrhage also occurred in one pa-
tient in the alteplase group; thrombectomy had 
not been performed in this patient because of 
reperfusion before the initial angiographic assess-
ment, but parenchymal hematoma contralateral 
to the infarction developed, resulting in death.
There were 10 deaths in the tenecteplase 
group and 18 in the alteplase group, but the dif-
ference was not significant in the prespecified 
logistic-regression analysis (Table 2). A list of 
adverse events, including causes of death, and 
a list of serious adverse events are provided in 
Tables S3 and S4, respectively, in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Discussion
Among patients with acute ischemic stroke from 
major cerebral vessel occlusion within 4.5 hours 
after the onset of symptoms, intravenous tenecte-
plase resulted in a higher incidence of reperfu-
sion of the occluded vascular territory before 
endovascular thrombectomy than did intravenous 
alteplase. We expected the effect on the clinical 
outcome of endovascular thrombectomy to ob-
scure any potential difference between tenecte-
plase and alteplase and therefore chose the tech-
nical efficacy of substantial reperfusion for the 
primary outcome. The trial was powered for 
noninferiority, not for superiority, and the sig-
nificance of superiority for the primary outcome 
of reperfusion was therefore less robust. Patients 
in the tenecteplase group had significantly bet-
ter functional outcomes than those in the alte-
plase group in an ordinal analysis of the modi-
fied Rankin scale scores but not according to 
Figure 1. Modified Rankin Scale Scores at 90 Days in the Intention-to-Treat 
Population.
Shown are the results of the ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin scale 
scores at 90 days. Scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no neurologic 
deficit, 1 no clinically significant disability, 2 slight disability (able to handle 
own affairs without assistance but unable to carry out all previous activities), 
3 moderate disability requiring some help (e.g., with shopping, cleaning, 
and finances but able to walk unassisted), 4 moderately severe disability 
(unable to attend to bodily needs without assistance and unable to walk 
unassisted), 5 severe disability (requiring constant nursing care and atten-
tion), and 6 death. Patients in the tenecteplase group had a median score 
of 2, as compared with a median score of 3 among patients in the alteplase 
group (common odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8; P = 0.04). Percentages 
may not total 100 because of rounding.

the proportion of patients who were left with 
minimal or no deficit or to the proportion of 
patients with early clinical improvement of their 
stroke deficit. There was no significant differ-
ence in the incidence of symptomatic or asymp-
tomatic cerebral hemorrhage.
Most patients who are treated with intravenous 
thrombolysis do not have reperfusion of the oc-
cluded vessel before thrombectomy. The inci-
dence of reperfusion of 10% that was observed 
with alteplase in the present trial was similar to 
the incidence of 11% that was observed in the 
EXTEND-IA trial of endovascular thrombectomy, 
which included patients with a distribution of 
vessel occlusions that is similar to the distribu-
tion in the present trial.3 These two trials enrolled 
patients at the initial treating hospital, in con-
trast to most other thrombectomy trials, which 
enrolled patients after transfer to a center that 
performs endovascular thrombectomy.2 Enroll-
ment at the initial hospital ensures the capture 
of data regarding a potential early response to 
thrombolysis in patients who otherwise might 
have been excluded if recruitment had been de-
layed by interhospital transfer. The higher inci-
dence of early reperfusion that was observed 
with tenecteplase than with alteplase occurred 
predominantly among patients with occlusion of 
the middle cerebral artery.
The median time from the commencement of 
thrombolysis to arterial puncture in this trial 
was 46 minutes and did not differ between the 
treatment groups. Although tenecteplase was 
associated with a numerically shorter delay than 
alteplase between the commencement of throm-
bolysis and arterial puncture of approximately 
10 minutes in patients who were transferred and 
approximately 5 minutes in patients who were 
treated on site, the between-group differences 
were not significant.
However, the ability to administer tenecte-
plase in a single bolus, as compared with the 
1-hour infusion of alteplase, may be of practical 
benefit in patients with stroke with large-vessel 
occlusion who are transported between, as well as 
within, hospitals to access endovascular throm-
bectomy, but this was not formally assessed in 
this trial. In some systems, transport cannot 
occur until the infusion of alteplase is complete.
Given the relationship of functional outcome 
to the time between the onset of stroke symp-
toms and reperfusion,20,21 earlier reperfusion by 
means of thrombolysis in an additional 12% of 
patients treated with tenecteplase, as compared 
with alteplase, may have contributed to improved 
outcomes. However, other mechanisms, includ-
ing the dissolution of residual thrombus after 
thrombectomy, may have played a role. Function-
al outcomes in the alteplase group in our trial 
were less favorable than those in the EXTEND-IA 
trial.3 However, we enrolled a broader group of 
patients, including patients with a preexisting 
modified Rankin scale score of 3, who were ex-
cluded from the EXTEND-IA trial. Our trial 
required that the ischemic-core volume be less 
than 70 ml only for approximately the first 80 
patients, which led to the enrollment of patients 
with larger infarcts than in previous trials. These 
negative prognostic factors would have been 
expected to lead to fewer patients with an out-
come of a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 2 
than were seen in the EXTEND-IA trial.3
A limitation of the trial is that the results ap-
ply to patients with ischemic stroke and large-
vessel occlusion who are eligible for thromboly-
sis. These patients represent approximately 13% 
of all patients with ischemic stroke,22 although 
this group contributes disproportionately to 
the disability burden from ischemic stroke.23 A 
phase 3 trial comparing tenecteplase with alte-
plase in patients in whom endovascular throm-
bectomy is not planned, with a primary outcome 
of functional recovery, is ongoing (Tenecteplase 
versus Alteplase for Stroke Thrombolysis Evalua-
tion [TASTE]; Australian New Zealand Clinical 
Trials 
Registry 
number, 
ACTRN12613000243718). 
The results of the present trial are consistent 
with those of a meta-analysis of previous trials 
showing a higher incidence of recanalization 
with tenecteplase than with alteplase among 
patients with stroke and arterial occlusion.24
We chose a dose of tenecteplase of 0.25 mg 
per kilogram on the basis of previous data that 
showed better outcomes with this dose than 
with a dose of 0.1 mg per kilogram.8 During the 
recruitment phase of EXTEND-IA TNK, the re-
sults of the Norwegian tenecteplase stroke trial 
(NOR-TEST), in which tenecteplase (at a dose of 
0.4 mg per kilogram) was compared with alte-
plase, were reported.10 Contrary to results in a 
previous dose-finding trial,25 this higher dose 
was not associated with an increased incidence 
of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The 
use of the dose of 0.4 mg per kilogram in pa-

tients with large-vessel occlusion may be benefi-
cial, given the large clot burden, and this dose is 
being studied in a trial (EXTEND-IA TNK Part 2; 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03340493).
In conclusion, tenecteplase, which can be 
administered more rapidly than alteplase before 
thrombectomy in patients with ischemic stroke, 
was noninferior to alteplase in restoring perfu-
sion in the territory of a proximal cerebral-artery 
occlusion. Overall functional outcome was bet-
ter with tenecteplase than with alteplase in the 
ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin scale 
scores, but the incidence of recovery to indepen-
dent function did not differ significantly. There 
was no significant difference in the incidence of 
cerebral hemorrhage.
