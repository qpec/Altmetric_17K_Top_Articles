abstract
Anaphylaxis is a severe, generalized allergic or hypersensitivity reaction 
that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Epinephrine (adrenaline) can 
be life-saving when administered as rapidly as possible once anaphylaxis is 
recognized. This clinical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics is 
an update of the 2007 clinical report on this topic. It provides information to 
help clinicians identify patients at risk of anaphylaxis and new information 
about epinephrine and epinephrine autoinjectors (EAs). The report also 
highlights the importance of patient and family education about the 
recognition and management of anaphylaxis in the community. Key points 
emphasized include the following: (1) validated clinical criteria are available 
to facilitate prompt diagnosis of anaphylaxis; (2) prompt intramuscular 
epinephrine injection in the mid-outer thigh reduces hospitalizations, 
morbidity, and mortality; (3) prescribing EAs facilitates timely epinephrine 
injection in community settings for patients with a history of anaphylaxis 
and, if specifi
 c circumstances warrant, for some high-risk patients who 
have not previously experienced anaphylaxis; (4) prescribing epinephrine 
for infants and young children weighing <15 kg, especially those who 
weigh 7.5 kg and under, currently presents a dilemma, because the lowest 
dose available in EAs, 0.15 mg, is a high dose for many infants and some 
young children; (5) effective management of anaphylaxis in the community 
requires a comprehensive approach involving children, families, preschools, 
schools, camps, and sports organizations; and (6) prevention of anaphylaxis 
recurrences involves confi
 rmation of the trigger, discussion of specifi
 c 
allergen avoidance, allergen immunotherapy (eg, with stinging insect venom, 
if relevant), and a written, personalized anaphylaxis emergency action 
plan; and (7) the management of anaphylaxis also involves education of 
children and supervising adults about anaphylaxis recognition and fi
 rst-aid 
treatment.

Clinical presentation and severity 
can vary among patients and in the 
same patient from 1 anaphylactic 
episode to another.

is the primary initial treatment of 
anaphylaxis.

from the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) updates and 
amplifies the previous report on this 
topic.

CLINICAL FEATURES OF ANAPHYLAXIS
Clinical criteria for anaphylaxis have 
been proposed and validated. 
3, 
 
5 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when 
any 1 of the following 3 criteria is 
fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness 
(minutes to several hours), with 
involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized 
urticaria, itching or flushing, 
swollen lips/tongue/uvula), and 
at least 1 of the following: (1) 
respiratory compromise (eg, 
dyspnea, wheeze/bronchospasm, 
stridor, hypoxemia) or (2) 
reduced blood pressure or 
associated symptoms of end-
organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence); 
OR
2. Two or more of the following that 
occur suddenly after exposure to 
a likely allergen for that patient 
(minutes to several hours): 
(1) involvement of the skin/
mucosal tissue (eg, generalized 
urticaria, itch/flush, swollen lips/
tongue/uvula), (2) respiratory 
compromise (eg, dyspnea, 
wheeze/bronchospasm, stridor, 
hypoxemia), (3) reduced blood 
pressure or associated symptoms 
(eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence), or (4) persistent 
gastrointestinal symptoms 
(eg, crampy abdominal pain, 
vomiting); OR
3. Reduced blood pressure after 
exposure to a known allergen 
for that patient (minutes to 
several hours): (1) for infants 
and children, low systolic blood 
pressure (age-specific) or greater 
than 30% decrease in systolic 
blood pressure, and (2) for 
teenagers and adults, systolic 
blood pressure of less than 90 
mm Hg or greater than 30% 
decrease from that person’s 
baseline. 
3
These clinical criteria for the 
diagnosis of anaphylaxis have been 
validated in emergency department 
studies in children, teenagers, and 
adults. They have high sensitivity 
(96.7%), reasonable specificity 
(82.4%), and a high negative 
predictive value (98%). 
3, 
 
5 
Disorders such as acute asthma, 
acute generalized urticaria, 
aspiration of a foreign body such as 
a peanut, vasovagal episode, 
and anxiety or panic attacks 
can present with some similar 
symptoms. 
1 There are age-
related differences in the clinical 
presentation and differential 
diagnosis of anaphylaxis. 
6, 
7 The 
clinical criteria have not yet been 
validated in infants.
Foods, especially peanut, tree 
nuts, milk, eggs, crustacean 
shellfish, and finned fish, are by 
far the most common triggers 
of anaphylaxis in the pediatric 
population. 
8, 
 
9 Insect stings, drugs 
such as antibiotics, and various 
other allergens can also trigger 
anaphylaxis 
1, 
 
2, 
10, 
 
11; however, 
vaccinations to prevent infectious 
diseases seldom trigger it. 
12
Cofactors that lower the threshold 
at which triggers can cause 
anaphylaxis include exercise, 
upper respiratory tract infections, 
fever, ingestion of nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drugs or ethanol, 
emotional stress, and perimenstrual 
status. 
13 
– 
15 Fatal anaphylaxis is 
often associated with adolescence, 
concomitant asthma (especially 
if severe or poorly controlled), 
and failure to inject epinephrine 
promptly. 
16– 
18
PRIMARY ROLE OF EPINEPHRINE
Epinephrine is the medication of 
choice for the first-aid treatment of 
anaphylaxis. Through vasoconstrictor 
effects, it prevents or decreases 
upper airway mucosal edema 
(laryngeal edema), hypotension, and 
shock. In addition, it has important 
bronchodilator effects and cardiac 
inotropic and chronotropic 
effects. 
1 
 
– 
4, 
19 
 
 
 
–24
Delayed epinephrine administration 
in anaphylaxis is associated with an 
increased risk of hospitalization 
22 
and poor outcomes, including 
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy 
and death. 
16 
– 
18 Conversely, prompt 
prehospital epinephrine injection 
is associated with a lower risk of 
hospitalization22 and fatality. 
1, 
 
2, 
 
16 
–18 
H1-antihistamines prevent and 
relieve itching and hives but 
do not relieve life-threatening 
respiratory symptoms, hypotension, 
or shock 
1, 
 
2, 
 
4, 
 
8, 
25, 
 
26; therefore, 
like H2-antihistamines and 
glucocorticoids, they are adjunctive 
treatments and are not appropriate 
for use as the initial treatment or 
the only treatment. 
1, 
 
2, 
 
8, 
25, 
 
27, 
 
28 For 
children with concomitant asthma, 
inhaled β2-adrenergic agonists (eg, 
albuterol) can provide additional 
relief of lower respiratory tract 
symptoms but, like antihistamines 
and glucocorticoids, are not 
appropriate for use as the initial or 
only treatment in anaphylaxis.

EPINEPHRINE ADMINISTRATION AND 
DOSING
Epinephrine can be life-saving 
when injected promptly by the 
intramuscular (IM) route in the mid-
outer thigh (vastus lateralis muscle) 
as soon as anaphylaxis is recognized 
( 
Table 1).

24 For first-
aid management of anaphylaxis in 
health care settings, traditionally 
an epinephrine dose of 0.01 mg/kg 
is injected IM, to a maximum of 0.3 
mg in a prepubertal child and up to 
0.5 mg in a teenager. Epinephrine

autoinjectors (EAs) can be used in 
health care settings to deliver a 
0.15-mg dose in a young child and a 
0.3-mg dose in a child or teenager.
If the response to the first 
epinephrine injection is inadequate, 
it can be repeated once or twice at 
5- to 15-minute intervals. 
1, 
 
2, 
 
8 From 
6% to 19% of pediatric patients 
treated with a first epinephrine 
injection in anaphylaxis require a 
second dose. 
29– 
31 A third dose is 
needed infrequently. Subsequent 
doses are typically given by a 
health care professional along 
with other interventions. 
1, 
 
2, 
 
4, 
8 In a 
retrospective chart review study in 
emergency department patients with 
anaphylaxis, most of whom were 
children, 17% of those who received 
1 epinephrine injection required 1 
or more additional doses. The need 
for subsequent injections did not 
correlate with obesity or overweight 
status. 
31
Subsequent epinephrine doses 
are needed for severe or rapidly 
progressive anaphylaxis and for 
failure to respond to the initial 
injection because of delayed injection 
of the initial dose, inadequate initial 
dose, or administration through 
a suboptimal route. 
23 Subsequent 
doses also might be needed in 
biphasic anaphylaxis, defined as 
recurrence of symptoms hours 
after resolution of initial symptoms 
despite no further exposure to the 
trigger, which is reported in up to 
11% of pediatric patients. Food-
induced anaphylaxis is associated 
with biphasic anaphylaxis less often 
than is venom- or drug-induced 
anaphylaxis. 
32, 
 
33
Reluctance to inject epinephrine 
promptly at the onset of anaphylaxis 
symptoms is best overcome by 
awareness that the severity of an 
anaphylactic episode can differ from 
1 patient to another and in the same 
patient from 1 episode to another. 
21 
At the onset, it is impossible to 
predict whether the patient will 
respond promptly to treatment, 
die within minutes, or recover 
spontaneously because of secretion 
of endogenous epinephrine.
SAFETY OF EPINEPHRINE
Pharmacologic effects of epinephrine 
include transient pallor, tremor, 
anxiety, and palpitations, which, 
although perceived as adverse 
effects, are similar to the symptoms 
caused by increased endogenous 
epinephrine levels produced in the 
“fight or flight” response. These 
effects cannot be dissociated from the 
beneficial effects of epinephrine. 
23
Epinephrine given by IM injection 
achieves peak concentrations faster 
than that given by subcutaneous 
injection. 
20 Epinephrine, 0.3 mg IM, 
is 10 times safer than epinephrine 
given as an intravenous bolus. 
34 
Serious adverse effects of IM 
epinephrine are rare in children. 
There is no absolute contraindication 
to epinephrine treatment in 
anaphylaxis.

DILEMMAS IN EPINEPHRINE DOSING
Only 2 premeasured, fixed doses 
of epinephrine, 0.15 mg and 0.3 mg, 
are currently available in EA 
formulations in the United States and 
Canada. 
35 EA manufacturers advise 
prescribing the 0.15-mg dose for 
patients weighing 15 to 30 kg and the 
0.3-mg dose for those weighing 30 kg 
and over. These doses are optimal for 
many children but not necessarily for 
all children. 
The 0.15-mg dose is high for infants 
(a twofold dose for those weighing 
≤7.5 kg) and for some young 
children. 
6, 
 
21 Some EA manufacturers 
have suggested that an alternative 
approach for infants is to have 
caregivers draw up the dose from

TABLE 1  
Anaphylaxis: Recognition and First-aid Treatment
How to recognize anaphylaxisa
 Anaphylaxis has a sudden onset (minutes to a few hours) after exposure to a food, drug, insect sting, or other trigger. It potentially involves some of the 
following symptoms and signs:
 • skin: itching, redness, hives, or swelling; oral and nasal mucosa: itching, swelling; conjunctivae: itching, swelling, redness;
 • respiratory tract: hoarseness, throat itching, throat tightness, stridor, cough, diffi
 culty breathing, chest tightness, wheeze, cyanosis;
 • cardiovascular symptoms: tachycardia, chest pain, hypotension, weak pulse, dizziness, collapse, incontinence, shock;
 • gastrointestinal tract symptoms: nausea, crampy abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, diarrhea; and
 • central nervous system: behavioral changes (infants), sense of doom, headache, altered mental status, confusion, tunnel vision.
How to treat anaphylaxis
 Be prepared! Have a written anaphylaxis emergency action plan.
 When anaphylaxis occurs, promptly assess the patient’s airway, breathing, circulation, and skin and call for help: 911 or EMS in community settings, a 
resuscitation team in health care settings.
 Inject epinephrine (adrenaline) IM in the mid-outer aspect of the thigh by using an EA. If needed, give a second injection 5 to 15 minutes after the fi
 rst.
 Place the patient on his or her back or in a position of comfort if there is respiratory distress and/or vomiting. Elevate the lower extremities. Do not allow 
standing, walking, or running.
 Transport the patient to an emergency department, preferably by an EMS vehicle, for further assessment and monitoring. Additional treatment, including 
supplemental oxygen, intravenous fl
 uids, and other interventions may be needed.

a Note that only a few anaphylaxis symptoms may be present during an episode. Also, symptoms
can differ among patients, and even in the same patient from 1 episode to the next. Typically, 
more than 1 body organ system is involved.

a 1-mL ampule by using a 1-mL 
syringe. However, dose preparation 
can take laypersons as long as 3 to 4 
minutes; moreover, doses typically 
are inaccurate and can sometimes 
contain no epinephrine at all when 
the solution is ejected from the 
syringe along with the air. 
36 Although 
unsealed 1-mL syringes prefilled 
by a health care professional with 
infant epinephrine doses also have 
been recommended, the doses can 
be lost, and the epinephrine solution 
typically degrades within a few 
months as a result of air exposure. 
37
After consideration of the 
aforementioned alternatives that 
potentially lead to delay in dosing, 
incorrect dosing, or no dose at all 
and consideration of the favorable 
benefit-to-risk ratio of epinephrine 
in young patients with anaphylaxis, 
many physicians recommend the 
use of the 0.15-mg EA in infants. 
6 
Most pediatricians (80%) report that 
they would prescribe the 0.15-mg 
EA for an infant or a child weighing 
10 kg (22 lb). 
38 International 
guidelines suggest that, when using 
EAs, patients weighing 7.5 to 25 kg 
should receive the 0.15-mg dose. 
39 
Physicians can discuss the benefits 
and risks of these options with 
families and prescribe on a case-by-
case basis. 
21
On the basis of a pharmacokinetic 
study 
40 and expert consensus, it is 
appropriate to switch most children 
from the 0.15-mg dose to the 0.3-mg 
dose when they reach a body weight 
of 25 to 30 kg (55–66 lb).

PRESCRIBING EAS
Most anaphylaxis deaths occur in 
community settings rather than in 
health care settings 
1, 
 
16 
– 
18; yet, some 
physicians fail to prescribe EAs for 
their patients at risk of anaphylaxis 
in the community.41 These patients 
include those with a history of 
anaphylaxis who can re-encounter 
their triggers, such as foods or 
stinging insects, those with idiopathic 
anaphylaxis, and those at increased 
risk of anaphylaxis who might not 
yet have experienced it (see next 
paragraph), 
 
1, 
 
2, 
 
8 
–10 including patients 
living in remote areas with minimal 
or no access to emergency medical 
services (EMS). 
1, 
 
2, 
 
4, 
 
35, 
39
EA prescriptions also can be 
considered for patients with known 
sensitization to peanut, tree nuts, 
cow’s milk, crustacean shellfish, and 
fish, which potentially are associated 
with severe and fatal anaphylaxis and 
can be difficult to avoid (eg, when 
peanut or milk are hidden ingredients 
in manufactured foods). 
8, 
 
9 
Consideration of prescribing an EA 
is especially important if the patient 
has had a previous food-induced 
allergic reaction, such as generalized 
acute urticaria, has reacted to trace 
amounts of a food, or has food allergy 
and concomitant asthma, which 
increases the risk of fatality from 
anaphylaxis. In fact, some experts 
have suggested that consideration 
be given to prescribing EAs for all 
patients with immunoglobulin E–
mediated food allergy, because it 
is difficult or impossible to predict 
the occurrence or severity of future 
reactions. 
8, 
 
9 It can be beneficial to 
prescribe EAs for children with a 
history of acute generalized urticaria 
after an insect sting, because if 
re-stung, the risk of a more severe 
systemic reaction is approximately 
5% in this population.10, 
 
35
Definitive evaluation by an allergy/
immunology specialist can provide 
confirmation of the diagnosis 
of anaphylaxis and the trigger 
and, for patients with idiopathic 
anaphylaxis, can clarify the 
diagnosis by performing additional 
investigations that reveal a trigger 
or identify comorbidities, such as 
systemic mastocytosis. 
1, 
 
2, 
 
42 Allergy/
immunology specialists also initiate 
comprehensive preventive care: 
prescription of EAs in the context of 
written, personalized anaphylaxis 
emergency action plans; education 
about anaphylaxis recognition and 
EA use; detailed information about 
how to avoid specific allergens; and 
allergen immunotherapy (eg, venom 
immunotherapy, if relevant) to 
prevent the recurrence of insect sting 
anaphylaxis. 
1, 
2, 
 
10, 
 
43, 
 
44
USING EAS
Guidelines recommend prompt 
epinephrine injection for the sudden 
onset of any anaphylaxis symptoms 
after exposure to an allergen that 
previously caused anaphylaxis in 
that patient. 
1, 
 
2, 
 
8 
–10 Systemic allergic 
reactions can rapidly progress from 
mild to life-threatening symptoms, 
and early treatment before, or at 
the first sign of, symptoms can 
sometimes prevent escalation 
of symptoms. 
35 As an example, 
generalized acute urticaria is not 
life-threatening; yet, in a community 
setting, in the context of a known 
exposure to an allergen (eg, peanut 
or milk) that previously triggered 
anaphylaxis, it could be beneficial 
to inject epinephrine to prevent 
additional symptoms. 
8, 
 
35 It can 
sometimes be difficult to distinguish 
anaphylaxis from other diagnostic 
entities such as acute asthma, acute 
generalized urticaria, aspiration of 
a foreign body such as a peanut, a 
vasovagal episode, or an anxiety or 
panic attack. 
35 In such situations, if 
unsure, erring on the side of caution 
and injecting epinephrine, then 
observing the patient closely, is 
advised.
Even physicians with years of 
experience in diagnosing and 
treating anaphylaxis cannot 
determine, at the onset of an episode, 
whether that episode will remain 
mild or escalate over minutes to 
become life-threatening. In this 
situation, although some oral 
H1-antihistamines relieve itching and 
hives within 30 or 40 minutes, 
 
25, 
 
26 
severe, life-threatening respiratory 
and/or cardiovascular symptoms 
can appear suddenly after the hives 
have disappeared.

settings, patients experiencing 
anaphylaxis or caregivers without 
medical training may be so anxious 
that they cannot assess the situation 
accurately and remember what to 
do. It is therefore important that 
physicians instruct patients and 
caregivers to err on the side of 
prompt epinephrine injection. 
1, 
 
3, 
 
8, 
 
35
Many patients and caregivers 
fail to carry EAs consistently or 
to use them when anaphylaxis 
occurs, even for severe symptoms, 
including throat tightness, difficulty 
breathing, wheezing, and loss of 
consciousness. 
41, 
 
45, 
 
46 People may 
have different reasons for not 
using EAs, including failure to 
recognize anaphylaxis symptoms, 
spontaneous recovery from a 
previous anaphylactic episode 
and the assumption that this will 
happen in every episode, reliance 
on oral H1-antihistamines and/
or inhaled bronchodilators, no 
EA available, fear of needles, 
and concerns about epinephrine 
adverse effects. 
41, 
45 
 
– 
48
Many parents fear using an EA 
because they worry about hurting 
or injuring their child or a bad 
outcome. 
46, 
 
47 Unintentional injections 
into digits and other body parts, with 
or without injuries, 
 
48 and lacerations 
incurred when an inadequately 
restrained child moves during the 
injection are reported from pen-type 
EAs. 
49
Teenagers are at increased risk of 
death in anaphylaxis 
16 
– 
18 because 
of high-risk behaviors, including 
ethanol and/or recreational drug use, 
failure to recognize triggers, denial 
of symptoms, and failure to carry 
their EAs and inject epinephrine 
promptly when anaphylaxis 
occurs. 
16– 
18 Additional efforts to 
provide anaphylaxis education for 
adolescents, their peers, and their 
communities are needed. 
50
Patients and caregivers need 
training in how to recognize 
anaphylaxis and use an EA. 
Epinephrine injections can be given 
through clothing, although care 
must be taken to avoid obstructing 
seams or items in pockets. Regular 
review (eg, annually) of anaphylaxis 
recognition and injection technique 
is advisable, because errors are 
common and acquired skills may 
not be retained permanently. 
51, 
 
52 
Technique can be practiced at home 
by using a “trainer.” Various EAs 
may come to market having different 
mechanisms of activation and 
variations in ease of use. 
53, 
 
54 
Education about anaphylaxis 
recognition and injection technique 
is advised to ensure familiarity with 
the specific device prescribed.
After treatment with epinephrine 
for anaphylaxis in community 
settings, it is important for patients 
to be assessed in an emergency 
department to determine whether 
additional interventions are 
needed. 
1, 
 
2, 
 
8 It may be helpful for 
families to know they are seeking 
additional medical care not because 
of the use of the EA, a safe treatment, 
but rather to assess and monitor the 
anaphylactic episode.
Pediatric allergists who are 
members of the AAP Section on 
Allergy and Immunology were 
surveyed about when they typically 
begin to transfer responsibilities 
for anaphylaxis recognition and 
EA use from adult caregivers to 
children and teenagers at risk of 
anaphylaxis in community settings. 
They expected that by age 12 to 
14 years, their patients should begin 
to share these responsibilities. 
They started to train early and 
individualized the time of transfer 
on the basis of patient factors, 
such as the presence of asthma and 
absence of cognitive dysfunction. 
55 
In contrast, caregivers of at-risk 
children and teenagers who were 
surveyed expected to begin transfer 
of responsibilities considerably 
earlier, by 6 to 11 years of age. 
56 
In both of these studies, the 
investigators commented that 
adults (parents, teachers, coaches, 
and others) have the ultimate 
responsibility for children and 
teenagers under their supervision 
who experience anaphylaxis. 
55, 
 
56
It is advised not to store EAs 
under conditions of excessive 
heat or cold (eg, in a car or beach 
bag on a hot day). Manufacturers 
recommend keeping them at 
20° to 25°C (68°–77°F), with 
excursions permitted to 15° to 
30°C (59°–86°F). Degradation of 
the epinephrine solution in EAs can 
occur without visible discoloration 
or precipitates. It is beneficial to 
check EA expiration dates and 
renew prescriptions in a timely 
manner. However, if the only EA 
available during an episode of 
anaphylaxis is past the expiration 
date, it can be used in preference to 
no epinephrine injection at 
all.

ANAPHYLAXIS EMERGENCY ACTION 
PLANS AND MEDICAL IDENTIFICATION
EAs are best prescribed in the 
context of written, personalized 
anaphylaxis emergency action plans. 
Such plans typically list common 
symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis 
and outline initial anaphylaxis 
treatment ( 
Table 1): specifically, 
prioritize calling for help (911 or 
EMS), injecting epinephrine from an 
EA, and positioning the patient supine 
or in a position of comfort.

plans can also provide information 
such as the individual’s anaphylaxis 
triggers and, if relevant, any history 
of severe anaphylaxis and/or 
comorbid conditions such as asthma. 
In addition, they can remind readers 
that H1-antihistamines and asthma 
inhalers should not be used as the 
initial treatment or only treatment of 
anaphylaxis.
Patients at risk of anaphylaxis 
recurrences can wear medical 
identification jewelry and/or 
carry a wallet card that states 
“anaphylaxis” and lists their

confirmed triggers and relevant 
comorbidities such as asthma. 
Knowledge about the recognition 
and treatment of anaphylaxis 
increased significantly after brief 
study of an anaphylaxis wallet 
card.

are best reviewed and updated 
regularly, such as annually.

SPECIAL ISSUES FOR SCHOOLS AND 
OTHER PUBLIC VENUES
Prevention and treatment of 
anaphylaxis in schools, child care 
settings, camps, and other venues 
for young people are multifaceted 
and require a comprehensive 
approach, including awareness 
training and practical preparation. 
61 
Approaches are outlined in an AAP 
clinical report 
61 and in guidelines 
from the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
healthyyouth/ 
foodallergies). 
In many US schools, unassigned 
EAs are available for use when 
anaphylaxis occurs in a student 
who does not have a personal EA 
available 
62; clinicians can check with 
their state legislature regarding such 
regulations.
SUMMARY
1. Epinephrine is the medication 
of choice for the initial 
treatment of anaphylaxis. If 
injected promptly, it is nearly 
always effective. Delayed 
injection can be associated 
with poor outcomes, including 
fatality. All other medications, 
including H1-antihistamines and 
bronchodilators such as albuterol, 
provide adjunctive treatment 
but do not replace epinephrine. 
After treatment with epinephrine 
for anaphylaxis in community 
settings, it is important for 
patients to be assessed in an 
emergency department to 
determine whether additional 
interventions, including oxygen, 
intravenous fluids, and adjunctive 
medications, are needed.
2. When anaphylaxis occurs in 
health care settings, epinephrine 
(0.01 mg/kg [maximum dose: 
0.3 mg in a prepubertal child 
and up to 0.5 mg in a teenager]) 
by IM injection in the mid-outer 
thigh (vastus lateralis muscle) is 
recommended. IM epinephrine 
achieves peak epinephrine 
concentrations promptly and is 
safer than an intravenous bolus 
injection.
3. When anaphylaxis occurs in 
community settings, EAs are 
preferred because of their ease 
of use and accuracy of dosing 
as compared with the use of 
an ampule, syringe, and needle 
by laypersons or the use of an 
unsealed syringe prefilled with 
epinephrine. In the United States 
and Canada, EAs are currently 
available in only 2 fixed doses: 
0.15 mg and 0.3 mg. International 
guidelines suggest that when 
using EAs, patients weighing 
7.5 kg (16.5 lb) to 25 kg (55 lb) 
should receive the 0.15-mg dose; 
although this dose is not ideal 
for those who weigh less than 15 
kg (33 lb), the alternatives are 
associated with delay in dosing, 
inaccurate dosing, and potential 
loss of the dose. It is reasonable 
to recommend EAs containing 
a 0.3-mg epinephrine dose for 
those weighing 25 kg (55 lb) or 
more.
4. It is beneficial to prescribe 
EAs for all patients who have 
experienced anaphylaxis and who 
may re-encounter their trigger in 
a community setting. If specific 
circumstances warrant, EAs may 
also be prescribed for some high-
risk patients without a history of 
anaphylaxis.
5. Epinephrine is best prescribed 
in the context of a written, 
personalized anaphylaxis 
emergency action plan, 
developed by the medical home 
with input from the family. 
A relevant AAP clinical report 
provides an example of such a 
written plan with instructions 
on completing it. 
63 Protocols 
for the use of unassigned EAs 
may also be beneficial. Children 
at risk of anaphylaxis require 
a comprehensive approach to 
management. It is important to 
teach patients and caregivers 
how to recognize anaphylaxis 
symptoms; when, why, and how 
to use an EA; and the rationale for 
calling 911 or EMS.
6. Children who have experienced 
anaphylaxis benefit from 
evaluation by an allergy/
immunology specialist for 
confirmation of the diagnosis, 
confirmation of specific triggers, 
and preventive care.
