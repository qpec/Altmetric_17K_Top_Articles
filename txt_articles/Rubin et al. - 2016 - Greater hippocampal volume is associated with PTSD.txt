Abstract
Previous research associates smaller hippocampal volume with posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD). It is unclear, however, whether treatment affects hippocampal volume or vice versa. 
Seventy-six subjects, 40 PTSD patients and 36 matched trauma-exposed healthy resilient controls, 
underwent clinical assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, and 10 weeks 
later, during which PTSD patients completed ten weeks of Prolonged Exposure (PE) treatment. 
The resilient controls and treatment responders (n=23) had greater baseline hippocampal volume 
than treatment non-responders (n=17) (p=0.012 and p=0.050, respectively), perhaps due to more 
robust fear-extinction capacity in both the initial phase after exposure to trauma and during 
treatment.

 1. Introduction
Previous studies suggest smaller hippocampal volume is a heritable vulnerability for 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Gilbertson et al., 2002). Hippocampal volume has not 
evinced change over the course of PTSD post onset (Bonne et al., 2001), suggesting a trait-
like quality. However, current research has not clarified whether treatment affects 
hippocampal volume (Apfel et al., 2011), or whether hippocampal volume influences 
treatment response (van Rooij et al., 2015).
Although hippocampal volume increases following psychopharmacological treatment 
(Vermetten et al., 2003), whether psychotherapy affects hippocampal volume is unclear. 
Whereas previous research indicated increased hippocampal volume following cognitive 
behavioral therapy (N=39) (Levy-Gigi et al., 2013) and Eye Movement and Desentization 
and Reprocessing (EMDR) (N=10) (Bossini et al., 2011), other studies failed to find any 
relationship between hippocampal volume changes and psychotherapy (Lindauer et al., 
2005, (N=18); van Rooij et al., 2015, (N=47)).
If hippocampal volume predicts risk of developing PTSD after trauma, it may also influence 
treatment response. To examine this possibility, we evaluated patients with PTSD and 
resilient trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHCs), matched for trauma type and 
demographic variables, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and 10 weeks 
later, during which interval PTSD patients received Prolonged Exposure (PE), a first line 
cognitive-behavioral PTSD treatment (Foa et al., 2008). We hypothesized that larger 
baseline hippocampal volume would positively predict PE treatment response. We also 
assessed whether PE was associated with changes in hippocampal volume.
2. Methods
Seventy-six participants with adult trauma (PTSD=40, TEHC=36) received assessment by 
medical examination, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (First 
and Gibbon, 2004), Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (Blake et al., 1995), and 
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17). Participants answered the Life Events 
Checklist (LEC) to assess trauma history and determine duration and number of exposures 
to potentially traumatic events. PTSD group exclusion criteria included substance/alcohol 
dependence within the past six months, or abuse within the past two months; psychotropic 
medication use four weeks prior to participation; HAM-D >24, and CAPS <50. TEHC group 
exclusion criteria included current or past Axis I disorders and CAPS >19. PTSD 
participants’ index trauma was to have occurred after age 16. Participants in the PTSD and 
TEHC groups were matched on demographic variables and trauma type. Treatment response 
was defined a priori as ≥30% reduction from baseline CAPS score (Brady et al., 2000).
T1-weighted structural images were acquired on a 1.5 T GE Twin Speed MRI Scanner 
(TR/TE/Flip angle=7.25ms/3ms/7°; 1×1mm in plane × 1.3mm). After inspection for motion 
artifacts or gross abnormalities, volume values for both left and right hippocampus were 
obtained using Freesurfer 5.1(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) standard surface-based 
reconstruction pipeline (Dale et al., 1999). PTSD participants received 10 weekly PE

 sessions. The New York State Psychiatric Institute Institutional Review Board approved all 
procedures, and all participants provided written informed consent.
Analyses compared three groups: treatment responders (n=23), TEHCs (n=36), and non-
responders (n=17). Fourteen non-responders dropped out before PE ended (five patients 
dropped out pre-treatment; four after completing the PE psychoeducational component; and 
five after the first exposure session). Within the non-responder group, completers and 
dropouts did not differ on any demographic, clinical, or brain volume variables. Kruskal 
Wallis tests, t-tests, and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) compared baseline clinical 
and demographic data. Baseline hippocampal volumes were compared among the responder, 
non-responder, and TE-HC groups using ANCOVA with post hoc LSD tests; a Group-by-
Time repeated-measures ANCOVA compared post-treatment volume change. Both analyses 
controlled for age, sex, and total brain volume (TBV, included to rule out non-ROI specific 
trends). All tests were two-tailed with significance α <.05.
3. Results
The treatment responders, non-responders and TEHCs did not differ on demographics or 
number of traumatic events. In addition, there were no statistically significant baseline 
differences in total brain volume pre-F(2, 74)=0.070; p>0.25, or post-treatment 
F(2,50)=0.93; p>0.25. Expected clinical symptom differences and treatment effects appeared 
pre-(F (2, 74) =337; p<0.001), and post-treatment (F (2, 46) =27.0; p<0.001) (see Table 1).
Baseline hippocampal volume showed a significant main effect of group F(2, 71)= 3.42, 
p=0.038, η2 = 0.088. Post hoc analyses indicated treatment responders had larger 
hippocampal volumes at trend level than non-responders (p=0.050), and TE-HCs had larger 
hippocampal volume than non-responders (p=0.012). Treatment responders and TE-HCs did 
not differ in hippocampal volume (p=0.686) (see Figure 1). Examination of longitudinal 
effects of PE treatment on hippocampal volume revealed no time × group interaction: F(2, 
46)=0.16, p=0.850, η2 =0.007, suggesting that hippocampal volume did not change over the 
course of the treatment.
4. Discussion
Our study found that PTSD patients responsive to PE treatment and trauma-exposed resilient 
controls had greater baseline hippocampal volume than treatment non-responders. These 
findings support evidence that suggests the hippocampus is key to contextual modulation of 
fear extinction (Ji and Maren, 2007), which is necessary for accurately distinguishing 
between contextual cues that signal safety and those that signal threat (Shin et al., 2006). 
Indeed, recent research linked deficits in this process to a smaller hippocampus (Negash et 
al., 2015). Taken together, our findings indicate that greater hippocampal volume may not 
only predict better prognosis when facing exposure to a traumatic event, but also better 
outcome of exposure-based PTSD treatments. This may be explained by the purported 
mechanism of change in PE, enhancement of safety discrimination during imaginal and in 
vivo exposure (Foa, 2007). We found no significant association between symptomatic

 improvement following Prolonged Exposure and change in hippocampal volume, 
corroborating some previous research (Lindauer et al., 2005; van Rooij et al., 2015).
Several study limitations warrant attention. While the between-group analysis was 
significant, the post-hoc analysis revealed only a trend level difference between responders 
and non-responders on baseline hippocampal volume. Additionally, the combination of MRI 
resolution and version of FreeSurfer used precluded collecting and analyzing hippocampal 
sub-region data. Other limitations include that we did not assess childhood trauma, 
overrepresentation (albeit non-significant) of females among PTSD responders, overall 
number of dropouts and, more specifically, the large number of drop-outs in the non-
responder group, raising the possibility that the finding reflects a relationship between 
smaller hippocampal volume and treatment drop-out. Treatment attrition may reflect a 
difficulty tolerating exposure treatment (Imel et al., 2013), which may also be tied to similar 
underlying mechanisms as lack of response. The study deserves replication, and future 
studies may be advised to examine the issue of attrition vs. lack of response, which we were 
underpowered to explore. Despite these limitations, we provide new evidence extending 
current knowledge with regard to the relationship between hippocampal volume and PTSD. 
Future research might consider investigating whether smaller dorsal hippocampus 
(specifically, CA1 and CA3) subregions influence treatment response for PTSD, as lesions 
to these subregions have been previously associated with impaired contextual extinction (Ji 
and Maren, 2008), a process critical to exposure therapies. We suggest hippocampal volume 
is a clinically relevant trait in PTSD, potentially critical to the outcome of PE, a first-line 
PTSD treatment for war veterans and civilians.
