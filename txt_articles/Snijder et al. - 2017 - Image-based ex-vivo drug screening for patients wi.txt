Summary
Background Patients with refractory or relapsed haematological malignancies have few treatment options and short 
survival times. Identification of effective therapies with genomic-based precision medicine is hampered by 
intratumour heterogeneity and incomplete understanding of the contribution of various mutations within specific 
cancer phenotypes. Ex-vivo drug-response profiling in patient biopsies might aid effective treatment identification; 
however, proof of its clinical utility is limited.
Methods We investigated the feasibility and clinical impact of multiparametric, single-cell, drug-response profiling in 
patient biopsies by immunofluorescence, automated microscopy, and image analysis, an approach we call 
pharmacoscopy. First, the ability of pharmacoscopy to separate responders from non-responders was evaluated 
retrospectively for a cohort of 20 newly diagnosed and previously untreated patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. 
Next, 48 patients with aggressive haematological malignancies were prospectively evaluated for pharmacoscopy-guided 
treatment, of whom 17 could receive the treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in 
pharmacoscopy-treated patients, as compared with their own progression-free survival for the most recent regimen on 
which they had progressive disease. This trial is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03096821.
Findings Pharmacoscopy retrospectively predicted the clinical response of 20 acute myeloid leukaemia patients to 
initial therapy with 88·1% accuracy. In this interim analysis, 15 (88%) of 17 patients receiving pharmacoscopy-guided 
treatment had an overall response compared with four (24%) of 17 patients with their most recent regimen (odds 
ratio 24·38 [95% CI 3·99–125·4], p=0·0013). 12 (71%) of 17 patients had a progression-free survival ratio of 1·3 or 
higher, and median progression-free survival increased by four times, from 5·7 (95% CI 4·1–12·1) weeks to 
22·6 (7·4–34·0) weeks (hazard ratio 3·14 [95% CI 1·37–7·22], p=0·0075).
Interpretation Routine clinical integration of pharmacoscopy for treatment selection is technically feasible, and led to 
improved treatment of patients with aggressive refractory haematological malignancies in an initial patient cohort, 
warranting further investigation.

Introduction
Genetic studies have identified several genomic 
alterations associated with the development of haema­
tological malignancies. However, barriers remain in fully 
translating this genomic information into direct clinical 
benefit for patients. Current efforts to introduce per­
sonalised medicine in patients with cancer, which focus 
on genetic and molecular patient stratification, have 
produced varying results.1–5 In a pioneering study,4 which 
used each patient as their own control, 27% of patients 
with recurrent metastatic cancer of any kind had a 
30% longer progression­free survival with treatment 
selected on the basis of genetic profiling than they did 
with their previous treatment. However, the SHIVA 
study,5 one of the first randomised trials of genomic­
based precision medicine, did not show a benefit in 
progression­free survival for patients assigned to genome­
based targeted treatment compared with treatment 
according to physician’s choice in heavily pretreated 
patients with cancer. Genome­based therapy decisions 
are limited by our incomplete understanding of the 
relationship between cancer phenotype and genotype,

and the complex genetics underlying cancer are the result 
of dynamic microevolutionary processes.6 For instance, 
whereas several studies have linked cytogenetic and 
molecular abnormalities with distinct clinical outcomes 
in acute myeloid leukaemia,7 accurate prediction of 
treatment response of individual patients with acute 
myeloid leukaemia to induction therapy remains 
challenging.8–12 Furthermore, patients with aggressive 
haematological malignancies, who have failed at least two 
lines of therapy, are often without further standard 
treatment options and have a poor prognosis.13 These 
patients will usually receive either best available therapy, 
supportive care, or will be enrolled in clinical trials. 
Therefore, dynamic approaches that measure drug 
responses in cancer cells derived from patient biopsies 
might complement such static genetic measurements. 
For example, ex­vivo chemosensitivity tests have been 
done in samples from patients with chronic or acute 
leukaemia and multiple myeloma,14–21 in breast cancer­
derived stable cell lines,22 in patient­derived xenografts in 
mice,23,24 and in gut stem­cell­derived organoids.25,26 These 
pioneering functional assays have provided proof of 
concept by showing that ex­vivo responses might match 
clinical response; however, these studies have not been 
integrated into clinical routine because of practical 
limitations and scarce proof of clinical benefit.27–29 
Here, we investigate the clinical impact of a newly 
developed technology platform that combines multi­
parametric immunofluorescence with high­throughput 
automated microscopy and single­cell image analysis, 
called pharmacoscopy.30 Pharmacoscopy enables tumour­
cell specific quantification of biological parameters of 
millions of adherent and non­adherent individual cells 
with high sample efficiency, minimal sample mani­
pulation, extensive automation, and fast turn­around 
times. We thus aimed to evaluate the feasibility of 
integrating pharmacoscopy into the clinic, and to assess 
clinical response in patients who received a treatment 
according to pharmacoscopy results as an individual 
healing attempt.
Methods
Study design and participants
For this single­arm, open­label, pilot study, we collected 
samples and clinical data from patients with late­stage 
haematological malignancies. Patients were eligible for 
inclusion if no further standard treatments or clinical trials 
were available for the patient; the patient had undergone at 
least two lines of previous therapy; the patient gave written 
informed consent; cancer cell­containing samples could be 
biopsied after written informed consent; the clinical 
decision was made by a board consisting of haematologists, 
pathologists, pharmacists, and molecular biologists; and 
candidate treatments identified by pharmacoscopy were 
clinically available and considered safe given the patient’s 
health condition. Pharmacoscopy­guided therapy was 
provided to individual late­stage patients as an individual 
healing attempt, in accordance with European Union and 
Austrian named­patient use legislation. Ethical approval 
was granted by the Ethics Commission of the Medical 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a systematic search of PubMed using the search terms 
(“functional screening” [Title/Abstract] OR “chemosensitivity 
test” [Title/Abstract] OR “chemoresistance test” [Title/Abstract] 
OR “drug profiling” [Title/Abstract] OR “drug response” 
[Title/Abstract]) AND (“leukemia” [Title/Abstract] OR 
“leukaemia” [Title/Abstract] OR “lymphoma” [Title/Abstract] 
OR “myeloma” [Title/Abstract] OR “hematologic” 
[Title/Abstract]). We did not restrict the search by date, 
language, or article type. We did one search before initiating 
this study on Sept 1, 2015, and we repeated this search on 
Oct 13, 2017. Several studies have shown the potential for 
retrospective patient stratification based on a variety of ex-vivo 
drug-response profiling techniques; however, no reports were 
found of studies in which patient treatment for haematological 
malignancies were adapted to ex-vivo drug-response profiling 
across large panels of drugs. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov 
for published clinical trials using the search terms described 
above. This search retrieved only one other clinical trial 
(currently recruiting patients and with feasibility as endpoint), 
in which patient treatment for haematological malignancies is 
being adapted to the drug-response profiles of primary biopsies 
across at least 100 different drugs tested.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, our study is the first prospective study 
showing feasibility and efficacy of ex-vivo drug-response 
profiling to guide personalised treatment selection across large 
panels of possible treatments for patients suffering aggressive 
haematological malignancies. We do so with a new 
image-based, drug-response profiling technique that we call 
pharmacoscopy, which uses high-throughput, automated, 
confocal microscopy; immunofluorescence; and single-cell 
image analysis.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our interim study results indicate that adapting treatment 
regimens of patients with aggressive haematological 
malignancies to pharmacoscopy is feasible, safe, and effective. 
More patients whose treatment protocols were selected by the 
haematological tumour board based on pharmacoscopy results 
had an overall response and had longer progression-free 
survival with pharmacoscopy than their previous treatment. 
Further studies with randomised trial designs and larger patient 
cohorts than our study are justified to further elucidate the 
clinical impact of our novel, image-based, ex-vivo 
drug-response profiling platform.

Procedures
Mononuclear cells from bone marrow aspirates, peripheral 
blood, pleural effusion, ascites, or excised lymph node 
samples were purified using Ficoll density gradient (bone 
marrow, peripheral blood, pleural effusion, ascites; Axis­
Shield, Oslo, Norway) or homogenised and filtered 
through a 70­μm mesh filter (lymph tissue). The resulting 
single­cell suspensions of mononuclear cells were seeded 
in 384­well imaging plates containing small compound 
libraries which were incubated overnight (18 h at 37°C and 
5% CO2). For most patients, libraries included 139 different 
drugs in two concentrations and five technical replicates 
total (appendix p 9). Bone marrow samples for the 
retrospective acute myeloid leukaemia study came from 
frozen biopsies, whereas biopsies used for the prospective 
study were all freshly acquired and not stored frozen. 
A comparison of pharmacoscopy results from fresh and 
frozen material from the same biopsy showed good 
consistency in results (appendix p 2). Immunofluorescence 
staining, imaging by automated microscopy (Opera 
Phenix; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA), image ana­
lysis (CellProfiler; Broad Institute of Harvard and 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, USA), 
and data analysis (Matlab; versions R2015a, R2015b, 
R2016a, R2016b, R2017a, R2017b) were done as described 
pre 
viously.30 The antibodies used to identify the target blast 
population were selected based on clinical pathology 
antigen expression assessment reports, and included CD3 
(HIT3a), CD19 (HIB19), CD20 (2H7), CD79a (HM47), 
CD34 (4H11), CD117 (104ED2), and CD138 (DL­101; 
eBiosciences [Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA]). 
Relative blast fractions (RBFs) were calculated as the 
fraction of marker­positive viable cells after drug treatment 
divided by the average fraction of marker­positive viable 
cells measured in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)­containing 
control wells. For hierarchical clustering of ex­vivo drug 
responses, all RBF values per patient and marker 
combination were first averaged over technical replicates 
and concentrations per drug, and subsequently normalised 
into pharmacoscopy scores via (1 – RBF)/max (1 – RBF). 
Thus, a pharmacoscopy score of 1 represents the strongest 
on target ex­vivo response, a pharmacoscopy score of 0 
indicates no ex­vivo effect, and negative pharmacoscopy 
scores indicate ex­vivo chemoresistance.
To explore whether pharmacoscopy is predictive of 
clinical response, we designed a retrospective study using 
samples from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia 
collected before receiving standard first­line remission 
induction therapy (figure 1A). Roughly 60% of patients 
typically respond with complete remission to induction 
therapy,31 which consists of cytarabine combined with 
daunorubicin and etoposide.32,33 Each patient sample 
was screened through a drug combination matrix of all 
three first­line drugs, consisting of 125 unique drug 
concentration combinations in four technical repeats. To 
determine the ex­vivo drug­induced cytotoxicity, we 
quantified the number of non­fragmented nuclei in each 
image after drug treatment. Drug­induced cell death based 
on nuclear morphology was measured after overnight 
drug incubation, and subpopulation specificity was 
assessed on the cells that stained positive for CD34 or KIT 
(CD117). Both markers are commonly present on leu­
kaemic blasts in acute myeloid leukaemia.34 Because all 
patient samples contained a combination of blast cells and 
non­malignant cells, we calculated the RBF of drug­treated 
cells to compare on target drug­induced cytotoxicity with 
that of drug­induced cytotoxicity in blast­marker­negative 
cells (figure 1A). The RBF is thus defined as the fraction of 
viable blasts surviving drug treatment relative to the 
average fraction of viable blasts observed in negative 
control samples. Drug sensitivity per patient was integrated 
over the drug matrix by averaging the number of RBF 
datapoints above (scored with +1) or below (–1) the 
hyperplane that best separated responders from non­
responders (figure 1G), weighted by the area under the 
receiver­operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of each 
cor 
responding concentration point in the drug matrix. 
We also compared clinical response with cytogenetic and 
molecular risk classification.
For the prospective study, eligible patients were assessed 
by the board (PBS, UJ, GIV, KM, CK, GH, IS­K, KO, WRS) 
and those who met inclusion criteria were tested by 
pharmacoscopy as outlined above. The markers used to 
identify the blast populations were selected individually 
for each patient based on their disease indication and 
clinical diagnostics. For the prospective study, on­target 
cytotoxicity was identified by calculating the RBF as in the 
acute myeloid leukaemia retrospective analysis, in which 
blast, in this context, now referred to any cancer cell. Thus, 
top­scoring drugs achieved the most specific reduction of 
the tumour­cell­enriched cell fraction ex vivo, while 
causing minimal cytotoxicity to the marker­negative 
healthy cells also present in the sample. The board then 
assessed the results, taking into account an individual 
patient’s previous treatment outcomes to recommend the 
next treatment regimen. Patients assessed by the board, 
but who had further standard treatment options, were 
used as an observational cohort. Integration of data from 
both patient groups allowed us to test whether chemo­
resistance measured by pharmacoscopy (eg, ex­vivo 
survival of blast cells coinciding with death of non­
malignant cells) is predictive of poor clinical response. To 
gain an overview of the complete dataset, we first set out 
to cluster the drug­response profiles. For this purpose, 
RBF values were normalised to pharma 
coscopy scores; 
negative values indicate drug resistance (blast survival and 
non­malignant­cell death), and positive values indicate on­
target chemosensitivity (blast death and non­malignant­
cell survival; appendix p 5).
To account for the complicating fact that for most 
treatment regimens comprised of multiple drugs, ex­vivo

testing was in fact done with single drug treatments, and 
that multiple and varying number of blast markers were 
measured in different patients depending on their clinical 
diagnostic results, we summed the relevant pharma­
coscopy values over all drugs and markers per patient, 
resulting in an integrated pharmacoscopy (i­PCY) score. 
We quantified overall response as 1=progressive disease, 
2=stable disease, 3=partial response, 4=complete remis­
sion, and determined the correlation with i­PCY.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the proportion of 
patients achieving progression­free survival, and the 
secondary outcome measure was the proportion of patients 
with an overall response (achieving either a complete 
remission or partial response). Progression­free survival 
was calculated as the time from the first day of treatment 
to the date of the first reported disease progression or 
relapse, initiation of a new (unplanned) anticancer treat­
ment, or death as a result of any cause. Overall response 
was defined by achieving either complete remission or 
a partial response, defined by standard response definition 
guidelines.35,36 For patients with lymphoma, responses 
were classified as complete remission, partial response, 
stable disease, or progressive disease according to the 
criteria proposed by the international working group on 
malignant lymphoma.35 For patients with leukaemia, 
responses were assessed following the response criteria 
defined by the recommen 
dations of the European 
LeukemiaNet.36 All patients that were included in the 
prospective trial had uniform follow­up intervals of 
4 weeks.
Statistical analysis
The treatment was deemed to be of clinical benefit for the 
individual patient who has a progression­free survival ratio 
(progression­free survival on pharmacoscopy­guided 
therapy/progression­free survival on prior therapy) of 1·3 
or higher. In such cases, we rejected the null hypothesis, 
defined as 15% or fewer patients having a progression­free 
survival ratio of 1·3 or higher. Thus, the individual patient 
was their own control. Comparisons of the overall response 
to previous treatment and pharmacoscopy­guided treat­
ments were calculated using a one­sided McNemar’s test 
for paired binomial data with continuity correction. The 
odds ratio (OR) could not directly be calculated as one of 
the discordant values (those patients who did respond to 
the most recent treatment, but who did not respond to 
pharmacoscopy­guided treatment) was equal to zero. We 
therefore calculated the overall response­associated OR 
using the standard calculation for contingency tables. 
Significance testing for progression­free survival dif­
ferences was done using the log­rank (Mantel­Cox) test. All 
correlations are Pearson correlation coefficients. All other 
p values are two­tailed t tests, unless stated otherwise. 
Statistical analyses were done in GraphPad Prism 
(version 7), Matlab (versions R2015a, R2015b, R2016a, 
R2016b, R2017a, R2017b), and Microsoft Excel (version 
2016).
The trial was registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov trial 
registry, number NCT03096821.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. PBS and UJ had access to patient annotated 
clinical data, BS, GIV, and GS­F had access to the 
anonymised patient clinical data and correlated drug 
responses. The corresponding author had full access to all 
the anonymised results and final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
The retrospective acute myeloid leukaemia study to 
determine whether pharmacocopy is predictive of clinical 
response used 20 biobanked bone marrow samples; 
ten samples from patients achieving stable complete 
remission to induction therapy, and ten from non­
responders to induction therapy.32,33 The correlation 
coefficient (r) when examining the number of non­
fragmented nuclei in each image after drug treatment was 
0·99 with immunofluorescence against activated caspase­3 
as a measure of cell death over samples from three patients, 
confirming the nuclear morphology readout (figure 1B). 
Bone marrow immunohistochemistry from clinical 
diagnostics confirmed the presence of CD34 and CD117 on 
blasts of all 20 patients. The 20 patients represented both 
sexes and diverse ages, had diverse genetic lesions and 
karyotypes, and blast fractions at time of sampling ranging 
from 30% to over 90% (appendix p 6). The clinical response 
to treatment in our retrospective cohort of patients with 
acute myeloid leukaemia only partially followed the 
cytogenetic and molecular risk classification (appendix 
pp 3, 6), with, for instance, all four patient who had a FLT3-
ITD mutation in the non­responders group and both 
inv(16) patients in the complete remission group.
The RBF was significantly different between complete 
remission and non­responders groups, with significantly 
stronger on­target effects observed with ex­vivo dauno­
rubicin treatment for the complete remission patient 
cohort (p<0·0001; figures 1C, 1D, appendix pp 3, 7). 
Conversely, population­averaged cytotoxicity measure­
ments (total cell death) did not correctly stratify patients 
based on their clinical response (figures 1E, 1F), indicating 
the need for the relative drug sensitivity measurements. As 
expected, the integrated response score for drug sensitivity 
revealed good separation of responders and non­
responders (figure 1H, appendix p 3). One particularly 
strong outlier was observed, complete remission in 
patient 10 for whom no ex­vivo response was measured. 
This discrepancy could not be attributed to differences in 
clinical parameters nor technical issues. Cross­validation 
by leaving out and reclassifying every possible combination 
of two patient samples, and calculation of the ideal

hyperplane based on the remaining 18 samples, revealed 
an average classification accuracy of 88·1% for the RBF 
(figure 1I), and an average AUROC of 0·97 (figure 1J). 
Consistently, we observed reduced classification power for 
this cohort with population­averaged readouts: overall cell 
death, quantified by the total cell number, led to a

classification accuracy of 68·5% (AUROC 0·86), and cell 
death of marker­positive cells, quantified as the total blasts, 
led to a classification accuracy of 78·1% (AUROC 0·91; 
figures 1I, 1J).
In the prospective study of the 57 patients with 
aggressive haematological malignancies, nine patients 
were not assessed by the board for reasons given in 
figure 2A. Of 48 patients who were assessed by the board, 
18 were not included and 13 still had further treatment 
options, leaving 17 patients who met the inclusion criteria 
to receive pharmacoscopy­guided treatment (figure 2A). 
For these 17 patients, pharmacoscopy was always done on 
the same day as the biopsy procedure, and median time to 
report pharmacoscopy results back to clinicians was 5 days 
(IQR 2–8). The trial started on Sept 1, 2015, the censoring 
date for the interim analysis for all patients was Nov 11, 
2016, and the median follow­up time was 7·6 months 
(IQR 4·5–8·7). The characteristics of the 17 patients who 
had pharmacoscopy­guided treatment are listed in the 
table. The 13 patients reviewed by the board that received 
treatments not guided by pharmacoscopy served as an 
observational cohort (appendix p 8). A comparison be­
tween the percentage of marker­positive cells measured 
from the same biopsies by clinical diagnostics­based 
flow cytometry, the current gold standard, and by pharma­
coscopy revealed strong consistency between the 
two methods (r=0·92, p<0·0001; figure 2B).
Pharmacoscopy­guided treatment regimens resulted in 
encouraging partial and complete remissions (table), 
documented as indicated by the type of malignancy, for 
example by PET­CT or PET­MRI for lymphoma. To visualise 
the workflow, we present data for the first four patients who 
had partial or complete response, as documented by PET­
CT or PET­MRT. Patient 2, a 69­year­old man with diffuse

large B­cell lymphoma, relapsed after seven lines of 
previous treatment. Lymphoma cells of the sample were 
resistant to most of the 104 drugs tested, and only 
six compounds had significant on­target effects ex vivo 
(figure 2C). Cisplatin and oxaliplatin were not regarded as 
feasible given the patient’s history, age, and comorbidities; 
however, the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib 
had the second strongest ex­vivo efficacy (RBF 0·61, 
p=0·00048; figure 2C). PET­CT imaging on day 49 of 
ibrutinib treatment confirmed a complete remission for 
the patient (figure 2G). Good clinical responses have been 
reported for a small subset of patients with diffuse large 
B­cell lymphoma carrying MyD88 mutations.37 Subsequent 
sequencing confirmed that patient 2 had a MyD88 mutation 
(table). Patient 3, a 51­year­old women with precursor B­cell 
lymphoblastic lymphoma, had three lines of previous treat­
ment, and was progressive after immuno 
therapy with the 
bispecific CD3–CD19 antibody blinatumomab (table). Cells 
isolated from a pleural effusion were tested by pharma­
coscopy against a panel of 266 compounds in duplicate, 
which revealed significant ex­vivo sensitivity to the 
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (RBF 0·498, p=0·00015) 
and the thiopurine 6­mercaptopurine (RBF 0·580, 
p=0·00095; figure 2D). 6­mercaptopurine and bortezomib 
were combined with anti­CD20 obinutuzumab. After 
28 days PET­CT confirmed a partial response (figure 2H). 
For patient 5, cells from an excised lymph node were tested 
for 139 drugs (figure 2E). The patient achieved a complete 
remission (figure 2I) to a combination of the single 
strongest ex­vivo acting drug bortezomib (RBF 0·589, 
p<0·0001), with cladribine ranked fifth (RBF 0·727; 
p=0·00029) and dexamethasone ranked 15th (RBF 0·866; 
p=0·050; figure 2E). And after ex­vivo sensitivity to 
cladribine was measured for patient 9 (figure 2F), 
complete remission was observed with cladribine treat­
ment in combination with CD30­targeted immuno 
therapy 
brentuximab vedotin (figure 2J). Data for patient 7, one of 
the two patients who did not respond to pharmacoscopy­
guided treatment, is shown and further discussed in the 
appendix (p 4).
Overall response and progression­free survival of 
pharmacoscopy were compared with overall response and 
progression­free survival for the most recent regimen on 
which the patient had progressed. Four (24%) of 17 patients 
achieved an overall response with the most recent regimen 
compared with 15 (88%) of 17 patients who achieved an 
overall response with pharmacoscopy­guided treatment 
(odds ratio 24·38 [95% CI 3·99–125·4], p=0·0013; 
figure 3A). Five (38%) of 13 patients receiving standard 
salvage treatment based on physician’s choice achieved 
an overall response (appendix p 8). Notably, none of the 
17 patients receiving pharmacoscopy­guided treatments 
had progressive disease as best overall response, whereas 
seven patients had progressive disease in response to their 
most recent regimen (figure 3A). Furthermore, pharma­
coscopy­guided treatments also led to a significantly 
improved median progression­free survival (22·6 weeks 
[95% CI 7·4–34·0]) compared with a median of 
5·7 weeks (4·1–12·1) in the same patients with the most 
recent regimen (hazard ratio 3·14 [95% CI 1·37–7·22], 
p=0·0075; figure 3B). 12 (71%) of 17 patients had a 
progression­free survival ratio of 1·3 or higher (figure 3C). 
The null hypothesis was therefore rejected. Notably,

eight (47%) of 17 patients that received pharma 
coscopy­
guided treatment regimens still had ongoing responses at 
the time of analysis (figure 3C), including patients 5, 6, 
and 9, who could proceed to allogenic stem­cell 
transplantation, and patient 7, who proceeded to CART­19 
transfusion. Five (29%) of 17 patients received treatment 
regimens that included immunotherapy as part of their 
pharmacoscopy­guided treatment, potentially confounding 
our interpretation of the results. We therefore re­tested

of less than –0·2, less than –0·3, or less than –0·4. Patients 
who had received no or only one previous treatment line 
showed ex­vivo chemoresistance (a pharmacoscopy score 
less than –0·1) to 9% of tested drugs, whereas patients 
that had received five or more previous treatment lines 
showed ex­vivo chemoresistance to 17% of tested drugs 
(p=0·016; figure 4D).
Patient outcomes correlated positively with the integrated 
pharmacoscopy scores (r=0·49, p=0·0065; figure 4B). 
18 (94%) of 19 responding patients (partial response and 
complete remission) had i­PCY scores between 0 to 3, 
whereas four (67%) of six patients with progressive disease, 
all of whom did not receive pharmacoscopy­guided 
treatments, had i­PCY scores in the negative range 
between –0·75 and –7
. Patient treatments associated with 
high i­PCY scores combined drugs acting on­target on all 
tested blast markers, or combined neutral, ex­vivo acting 
drugs with ex­vivo on­target acting drugs. Conversely, 
patients res 
ponding with progressive disease as best 
overall response had treatments including drugs to which 
strong, ex­vivo chemoresistance was measured. One of two 
non­responding (stable disease) patients receiving pharma­
coscopy­guided treatments had an i­PCY score of below –1, 
indicating that the pharmacoscopy test did not strongly 
support the final personalised treatment regimen for this 
non­responding patient, due to ex­vivo discordance 
depending on the used blast markers (figure 4B). Overall, 
the i­PCY score separated progressive disease from 
patients who had achieved a partial response and complete 
remission with a classification accuracy of 92% and an 
AUC of 0·84 (figure 4B).
Discussion
This single­centre study shows technical feasibility of 
integrating automated microscopy­based, ex­vivo drug­
response profiling for patients with aggressive haemato­
logical malignancies into clinical practice. The test­guided 
treatment regimens led to significantly longer progression­
free survival and improved overall response in patients 
with various haematological malignancies compared with 
their most recent regimens, warranting further disease­
specific clinical studies that include larger patient cohorts 
and randomised control groups.38 Although the trial did 
not include a randomised control group and had a 
relatively small cohort size of 17 patients, our results 
suggest that a wide array of working chemotherapeutics 
and targeted inhibitors already exist, which, in principle, 
are capable of breaking drug resistance even in 
multirefractory cancers, if the right drugs are selected at 
the right time for each individual patient. We found that an 
integrative combination of chemosensitivity of the 
leukaemic blasts and chemoresistance of the marker­
negative, non­malignant cells predicted clinical response 
to first­line acute myeloid leukaemia treatment with the 
highest accuracy. Furthermore, the same readout guided 
selection of treatments associated with favourable clinical 
responses, and predicted both good as well as poor clinical 
which showed that both overall response (p=0·0002) 
and progression­free survival (p=0·025) remained signif­
icantly improved for pharma 
coscopy­guided treatments 
compared with the most recent regimen. This reanalysis 
allowed us to exclude the possibility that the addition of 
antibody­based immuno 
therapies affected our interpre­
tation of the results. Taken together, pharmacoscopy­
guided treatment regimens de 
monstrated strongly im­
proved clinical responses and survival benefit in an initial 
cohort of 17 late­stage patients with aggressive relapsed 
and refractory haematological malignancies.
To test whether chemoresistance measured by pharma­
coscopy is predictive of poor clinical response we did 
a cluster analysis including the 17 patients receiving 
pharma 
coscopy­guided treatment with the 12 observation 
cohort patients whose subsequent treatments were also 
tested ex­vivo before treatment initiation. Hierarchical 
clustering of the pharmacoscopy response profiles per 
patient and blast­markers as determined by clinical 
diagnostics, overlaid with the best overall response 
corresponding to drug and patient pairs, revealed 
extensive patient­to­patient vari 
ability in both the number 
and identity of drugs to which either chemo 
resistance or 
chemosensitivity was measured (appendix p 5). Similar 
indications displayed remarkable heterogeneity in 
response profiles, indicating an absence of character­
istic ex­vivo responses for the tested indications in this 
partially heavily pretreated cohort. Hierarchical clustering 
repeatedly grouped drug classes with the same mode of 
action, including immuno 
modulatory drugs (thalidomide, 
lenal 
idomide, and pomalidomide), anthra 
cycline chemo­
therapies (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and valru 
bicin), 
and histone deacetylase inhibitors (belinostat, pano­
binostat, and vorinostat). The clustering further high­
lighted the diversity of treatments given to the patients. 
30 unique drugs, distributed across the clus 
tering, were 
tested by pharmacoscopy and subsequently administered 
to patients, enabling robust pan­treatment statistical 
analysis (figure 4, appendix p 5).
Further analyses demonstrated the association between 
ex­vivo chemoresistance and poor clinical outcome. First, 
plotting the average pharmacoscopy scores over all 
markers and drugs in relation to associated overall 
response to those drugs showed that treatments leading to 
progressive disease were associated with negative pharma­
coscopy scores, whereas treatments leading to partial 
response or complete remission resulted in significantly 
positive pharma 
coscopy scores (figure 4A). Second, the 
treatments to which the patient had relapsed before 
pharmacoscopy 
testing 
had 
on 
average 
negative 
pharmacoscopy scores (p=0·0079; figure 4C). Third, the 
percentage of tested drugs to which ex­vivo resistance was 
measured (at pharmacoscopy score less than –0·1) 
increased with the number of previous treatment rounds 
of each of the 29 patients (r=0·44; p=0·016; figure 4D). 
Similar significantly positive correlations were found 
when defining chemoresistance as pharmacoscopy scores

responses. The positive relation observed between the 
number of previous treatment lines and ex­vivo drug 
resistance is intuitive, and might reflect acquired drug 
resistance as well as refractory disease being more resistant 
from disease onset.
Our investigation was designed as a prospective, non­
randomised study in which every patient acted as their 
own control. This approach allowed us to assess the overall 
effect across heterogeneous diseases and treatment 
regimens; however, the absence of random 
isation could 
have led to bias.6,38 Future randomised trials testing 
pharmacoscopy­guided therapies versus physician’s choice 
are therefore warranted, and should focus on individual 
disease entities.
Not all patients in our study had correlation between 
pharmacoscopy results and outcome, in particular one 
outlier patient (patient 10 in the retrospective acute myeloid 
leukaemia study). Identifying the causes for such outliers 
will thus require repetition with larger cohort sizes and 
integration with systematic molecular data. In our 
comparison of con 
ventional genetics with response 
in the retrospective acute myeloid leukaemia cohort, our 
results matched those in previous studies.39
A benefit of pharmacoscopy resides in the analytical 
power derived from monitoring with computer­aided 
precision millions of individual single­cell drug responses, 
which combined with the ability to discriminate cell types 
allows us to score specific rather than general and averaged 
cytotoxic effects. Pharmacoscopy will likely be instructive 
for the personalised identification of clinically effective 
therapies for other malignancies beyond those tested here. 
The selection of personalised therapy by pharmacoscopy 
benefits from the ability to measure hundreds to thousands 
of drug exposures using small patient samples, in which 
each ex­vivo treatment includes healthy cell controls from 
the same patient sample. Pharmacoscopy detects cancer 
cells with fluorescently labelled antibodies against clinically 
used diagnostic markers, which means the test synergises 
with, and uses similar antibodies as, clinical flow 
cytometry­based diagnostics. Both microscopy and flow 
cytometry or optometry share the limitations of detection 
of cancer cells by antibody­based immuno 
fluorescence, 
whereas pharmacoscopy allows for reduced sample 
processing and increased throughput and automation. 
Our results show that single­cell detection of blast markers 
by pharma 
coscopy enables a clinically useful comparison 
of on­target and off­target cytotoxicity, while the minimal 
ex­vivo culturing of cells, and compatibility with clinical 
diagnostic markers, ensure fast and relevant feedback. 
Specifically, the platform allowed us to test 768 conditions 
for almost all of the 17 patient samples, returning results to 
the clinic within 5 days of receiving a sample. A crucial 
trade­off nonetheless remains between the number of 
different drugs, technical replicates, concentration ranges, 
timepoints, and drug combinations that can be tested from 
one biopsy. In that regard, the observation made in this 
study that ex­vivo testing of single treatments can aid 
selection of clinically beneficial combination treatments 
suggests that not every drug combination needs to be 
tested in combination ex vivo, thus allowing for larger drug 
panels to be tested; future studies are needed to further 
refine optimal, ex­vivo drug­testing regimens.
Comprehensive drug response profiles of individual 
people, as generated here, represent the outcome of 
interplay between various molecular parameters of the 
responding cells, including not only the genetic, proteomic, 
and metabolic state of the cells, but also the direct and 
indirect molecular interactions with other cells.30 We 
therefore hypothesise that such comprehensive drug­
response profiles can offer novel functional insight into 
the underlying health status of an individual, with 
potentially wide­ranging implications in preventive and 
participatory medicine. Given the fast throughput of the 
method, both experimentally and analytically, future 
studies can include higher patient numbers that will be of 
great interest to investigate the translatability of pharma­
coscopy further.
Pharmacoscopy provided useful treatment­guidance in 
an initial late­stage patient cohort, warranting further 
investigation in larger and indication­specific clinical trials. 
It is likely that the approach will synergise well with 
molecular profiling techniques such as genomics and 
proteomics for personalised treatment identi 
fication. Such 
studies could lead to improved patient treatment and be a 
useful route to mechanistic elucidation of clinically 
relevant genotype­to­phenotype relationships.
