Abstract
Patients with severe grades of life-threatening brain injury are commonly characterized as having devastating brain
injury (DBI), which we have defined as: ‘any neurological condition that is assessed at the time of hospital admission as
an immediate threat to life or incompatible with good functional recovery AND where early limitation or withdrawal of
therapy is being considered’. The outcome in patients with DBI is often death or severe disability, and as a consequence
rapid withdrawal of life sustaining therapies is commonly contemplated or undertaken. However, accurate prognosti-
cation in life-threatening brain injury is difficult, particularly at an early stage. Evidence from controlled studies to guide
decision-making is limited, and there is a risk of a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’, with early prognostication leading to early
withdrawal of life sustaining therapies and death. The Joint Professional Standards committee of the Faculty of Intensive
Care Medicine and the Intensive Care Society convened a consensus group with representation from stakeholder pro-
fessional organizations to develop clear professional guidance in this area. It recognized that the weak evidence base
makes GRADE guidelines difficult to justify. We have made 12 practical, pragmatic recommendations to help clinicians
deliver safe, effective, equitable, and justifiable care within resource constrained healthcare systems. In the situation
where patient-centred outcomes are recognized to be unacceptable, regardless of the extent of neurological improve-
ment, then early transition to palliative care is appropriate. These recommendations are intended to apply where the
primary pathology is DBI, rather than where DBI has compounded a progressive and irreversible deterioration in other
life-threatening comorbidities.

 Accurate prognostication in life threatening brain injury is
difficult, particularly at an early stage. The eventual outcome
for such patients is often death or survival with severe
disability. Many consider that admitting such patients to the
critical care unit (or intensive care unit: ICU) has little to offer
in the absence of a therapeutic option, or that admission is
inappropriate because it prolongs the dying process and
is wasteful of precious resources. Therefore, in these circum-
stances withdrawal of life sustaining treatments (WLST) is
common practice and considered justifiable.
A UK neurosciences ICU that sought to change current
practice by admitting this patient cohort for observation, pri-
marily to aid prognostication, has recently published their
experience.1 This has confirmed in a UK context what many
intensivists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons already accept:
that occasionally patients go on to make a good recovery
despite very poor early prognostic signs.2
Without controlled studies the evidence to guide decision
making will be weak when compared with other interventions
in critical care. Such studies are unlikely and the risk of a self-
fulfilling prophecy, with early prognostication leading to early
WLST and death, continues to exist. Case series and the
development of appropriate registries can be helpful in
increasing the evidence base. Evidence based guidelines as
constructed by agreed GRADE criteria in such circumstances
will often lead to weak recommendations. Nonetheless the
Neurocritical Care Society in the USA has recently undertaken a
systematic review and made several recommendations3 that
have helped inform this consensus statement. The Joint Pro-
fessional Standards Committee of Faculty of Intensive Care
Medicine (FICM) and the Intensive Care Society (ICS) recognizes
that the weak evidence base makes the development of guide-
lines and protocols difficult to justify, but believes that guidance
in this area would help practicing clinicians deliver safe,
effective, equitable, and justifiable care within a resource-
constrained UK National Health Service (NHS). The Joint Pro-
fessional
Standards
committee
therefore
convened
a
consensus group with representation from stakeholder pro-
fessional organizations to produce this guidance.
This statement is intended to help consultants when
making decisions on the management of patients admitted
with a perceived devastating brain injury (DBI), and should not
replace their clinical judgment.
Definition of devastating brain injury
For the purpose of this statement, devastating brain injury
(DBI) is defined as:
Any neurological condition that is assessed at the time of
hospital admission as an immediate threat to life or incom-
patible with good functional recovery AND where early lim-
itation or withdrawal of therapy is being considered.
This definition emphasizes both the importance of an early
clinical assessment of the mortality risk and the likely func-
tional outcomes and the proposed clinical course of action. It
is derived from the recommendations of the Neurocritical Care
Society3 and from UK experience in admitting such patients
from the emergency department (ED) to the ICU.1,4 Many pa-
tients admitted with neurological conditions that are an im-
mediate threat to life or considered as incompatible with a
good functional recovery are still treated actively and aggres-
sively. The definition is only met when a treatment limitation
or withdrawal decision is also being considered at this early
stage. This definition of DBI is not dependent on the underly-
ing diagnosis. It can be used in patients with any primarily
neurological
diagnosis,
most
commonly
traumatic
brain
injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracerebral haemor-
rhage, stroke, and hypoxic brain injury from a range of causes.
The early limitation or WLST is usually considered in DBI
because the presenting neurological insult is not thought to be
compatible with survival and not amenable to active inter-
vention. In practice this usually means that a short period
of
organ
and
airway
support
is
provided
in
the
ED
followed quickly by a transition to palliative care and terminal
extubation.
Although
many
patients
with
hypoxic
brain
injury
following the return of spontaneous circulation after a cardiac
arrest may have met the criteria for DBI in the past, currently
only a minority of these patients have an early treatment
limitation decision applied since current international post
resuscitation guidelines5 recommend the admission of such
patients to ICU and delayed prognostication.
In
the
situation
where
patient-centred
outcomes
are
recognized to be unacceptable, regardless of the extent of
neurological improvement, then early transition to palliative
care without admission to ICU would be appropriate. This
consensus statement is intended to apply where the primary
pathology is DBI, rather than to the situation where DBI has
compounded a progressive and irreversible deterioration in
other life-threatening comorbidities.
Recommendations
1. Patients who present with severe brain injury often
require time sensitive interventions. Where these are
potentially meaningful in the overall clinical context, such
interventions should be undertaken without delay.
2. There
are
patients
in
whom
severe
brain
injury
is
perceived to be devastating and active intervention not
thought to be appropriate. However, prognostication at
this stage can be inaccurate, and a period of physiological
stabilization and observation is recommended to improve
the quality of decision making.
3. Patients who are intubated will require admission to crit-
ical care for this period of observation, unless the extent of
comorbidity makes continued organ support of no overall
benefit regardless of the extent of potential neurological
recovery. Patients not requiring stabilization with airway,
ventilatory, or circulatory support can be observed on a
medical ward.
4. During the period of observation, the therapeutic aim is to
provide cardiorespiratory stability in order to facilitate
accurate neurological prognostication. If the patient’s
neurological function continues to deteriorate despite
cardiorespiratory stability the multidisciplinary team (MDI)
may consider this to be an appropriate trigger for a decision
to WLST. If the patient shows signs of improvement the MDI
should reconsider the treatment limitation decision.
5. Communication of the aims and goals of treatment should
be consistent and made clear to the family and members
of the MDI from the outset. Admission to ICU may raise
unrealistic expectations. The patient’s family should be
informed of the expectation of continued deterioration
with death the most likely outcome, but that additional
time will increase the certainty of this prognosis.

 6. The duration of the period of observation should be deter-
mined by a combination of clinical judgement, changes in
neurological function, the degree of support required to
maintain physiological stability, and communication with
patient’s family to determine patient preferences.
7. The diagnosis of brainstem death often aids communica-
tion and decision making at the end of life. Continuation of
intensive care in order to support the diagnosis of brain-
stem death is appropriate in such circumstances.
8. Organ donation should be a routine consideration in end-
of-life care planning.
9. An approach for consent to organ donation should only
occur after the family understand and accept the diagnosis
of brain death or the reasons for WLST, and then under-
taken in collaboration with a specialist nurse for organ
donation.
10. The Joint Standards Committee of the FICM/ICS should
engage with other stakeholder organizations to remove
barriers
to
the
adoption
of
these
recommendations.
Stakeholder organizations should work with the Intensive
Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) and the
Society of British Neurological Surgeons to ensure data are
captured on this cohort within critical care, the emergency
department, and the wider hospital environment.
11. Mortality is an inappropriate performance metric in this
patient cohort. Detailed analysis is required to assess the
effect of implementation of these recommendations on
both individual consultant and unit mortality statistics,
and to explain possible outliers that may result.
12. Audit and analysis of outcome data for these patients
should be routinely collected nationally to ensure good
governance.
Prognostication
Prognostication of outcome from neurological disease has
received much attention. Some variables have prognostic sig-
nificance across several diagnostic categories. These include
age, conscious level at presentation, physiological status,
extent of brain injury identified by imaging, and the presence
and severity of comorbidities.6,7 These have been integrated to
varying
extents
in
disease-specific
prognostic
schemes
for traumatic brain injury (TBI),8,9, aneurysmal subarachnoid
haemorrhage,10e12
intracerebral
haemorrhage,13
ischaemic
stroke,14, and cardiac arrest.15,16 These schemes are based on
probabilistic models that relate clinical features and in-
vestigations at presentation to outcome, and display varying
degrees of accuracy and precision. While the performance of
many of these schemes has been subject to validation in pop-
ulations of patients, they all suffer from problems that make
their application to individual patients unsatisfactory.
First, although their performance in groups of patients may
be acceptable, the precision of prediction is either not
routinely provided, or tends to be inadequate for decision-
making in individual patients. For example, the CRASH prog-
nostic model9 often shows confidence intervals (CI) of up to 5%
when predicting mortality in TBI. Consequently, a predicted
mortality close to 100% may have a lower CI of ~95%, sug-
gesting survival of one in 20 patients. Such imprecision may be
particularly relevant when prognostic schemes that have been
developed in one context are applied to a different clinical
environment, where they may need recalibration to restore
even baseline levels of precision.17
Second, many prognostic schemes tend to provide predic-
tion of mortality, rather than functional outcome, a substan-
tial failing when the quality of survival is seen as important by
patients and their families. Where functional outcomes are
provided, precision tends to be either unreported, or imper-
fect, as for mortality.
Third, even recently published prognostic schemes are
reliant on large retrospective datasets, and consequently do not
reflect current therapeutic possibilities. In several conditions,
accumulating data, emerging advances, changed management,
or all three may invalidate prognostic expectations (as for the
prognostic import of motor responses and myoclonus following
cardiac arrest),16 or a prognostic feature may undergo refine-
ment in a way that was not appreciated when the original
prognostic scheme was devised (as for myoclonus).18 The
sensitivity of prognostic features may be altered by changes in
therapy (e.g. the common use of prehospital sedation has
diminished the prognostic power of the Glasgow Coma Scale,19
and the significance of motor responses following cardiac arrest
has been altered by the use of therapeutic hypothermia).20
Further, newer therapies and more aggressive management
may mean that current outcomes are often better than estab-
lished
prognostic
schemes
and
past
experience
might
suggest, even for conditions that might be perceived to be
devastating.21,22
Fourth, the validation of existing prognostic schemes is
heavily confounded by the likelihood that patients with the
worst expected prognosis often have less aggressive therapy or
have therapy withdrawn,23 making prediction of mortality a
self-fulfilling prophecy.24,25 This phenomenon can result in
erroneous reinforcement of prognostic schemes. Even where
patients do not die, their functional outcomes may not be as
favourable as might have been achieved by continued aggres-
sive therapy. Also there is an emerging realization that severe
brain injury takes a long time to achieve maximal outcome, and
the typical assessment of outcome at hospital discharge, or
even at 6 months, may underestimate the quality of survival,
particularly
in
patients
who
have
undergone
extremely
aggressive management.26
Finally, societal expectations of what is accepted as a ‘life
worth living’ are constantly being recalibrated, and many pa-
tients who are severely disabled express satisfaction with
quality of life.27e29 Understanding these changing trends is
important if clinicians and clinical services are to reflect the
expectations of the populations we treat.
However, notwithstanding these imperfections in predic-
tion of outcome in individual patients, clinical care of patients
with severe brain injury demands that clinicians make judg-
ments regarding the advisability of continued active therapy
in the face of a high risk of undesirable functional outcome.7
Consequently, we need to find ways to provide greater assur-
ance of prediction of such undesirable outcome. The change in
status with physiological stabilization, and the initial response
to active therapy provides one route to such greater assurance.
Most prognostic schemes are populated by variables that are
recorded at a single time pointdtypically at admission.
Assessment of response to stabilization and active therapy not
only refines the precision of such prognostication, but also
ensures that potentially retrievable patients are not mistak-
enly abandoned, and that the potential of clinical outcome in
survivors is maximized.7 Indeed, it is precisely this group of
patients with the worst expected prognosis, who might have
their outcome substantially benefitted by aggressive man-
agement
and
specialist
care.23,30,31
The
period

 stabilization and interval to reassessment will depend on the
individual patient, but may lie between 24 and 72 h.
Observation and limitations of therapy
The purpose of an admission to ICU in the context of DBI is to
provide physiological support whilst allowing further time for
observation and monitoring, rather than the prolongation of
an inevitable death. Observations and further investigations
are aimed at confirming the initial prognostication and the
exclusion of potential confounders. Treatment limitations
should be agreed and communicated with the patient’s family
and ICU team at the outset. This may include limitation of
additional organ support and interventions, for example, renal
replacement therapy, neurosurgical interventions, intracra-
nial pressure monitoring, and the application of a do not
attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) decision.
The key observation is simple repeated clinical monitoring
of conscious level (Glasgow Coma Scale score) and pupillary
reactions after physiological stability has been achieved and
any confounders (Table 1) recognized and treated. This man-
agement can be provided in the patient’s local ICU. The devel-
opment of physiological instability and organ dysfunction
during the period of observation is common. Mechanical
ventilation and inotropic support are usually required and are
appropriate. When a rapid and significant escalation in therapy
is required to maintain physiological stability, the responsible
consultant should review the relative harms and burdens of
continued intensive care regularly.
In patients who show an improvement in their neurology,
further discussion with a regional neurosciences centre is
recommended; repeat imaging, neurophysiological studies,
patient transfer, or all three may be required.
The use of sedative medication early in the presentation of
patients with DBI is recommended as a part of emergency
resuscitation to prevent secondary brain injury, for example,
during intubation.32 After that, sedatives should only be used
if required to control seizures, allow tolerance of mechanical
ventilation, and to manage any concerns about pain or
distress. Concerns of this kind often suggest neurological re-
covery and consideration should be given to transitioning to
active therapy. The doses used should be kept minimal to
allow continued observation of the pupils and motor re-
sponses, and sedation holds practiced as usual.
A proportion of patients with DBI will develop raised intra-
cranial pressure with subsequent brainstem compression and
secondary hypertension during the period of observation. This
is the expected progression of many conditions presenting as
DBI. Short-acting sedative agents may be used to manage the
hypertension but there are advantages to the use of short-acting
b-blocking agents (e.g. esmolol) in this context. It may be
considered appropriate to continue and indeed escalate support
to allow a diagnosis of brain stem death when this is a possi-
bility. The diagnostic certainty of death confirms prognostica-
tion and futility, and can aid communication with families.
Comorbidity
Age is recognized to significantly worsen the outcome of pa-
tients with critical illness and brain injury,9 a relevant factor
may be the incidence of comorbidity. The influence of co-
morbidity on the decision to admit a patient to ICU should be
the same for a patient with DBI as for patients with other di-
agnoses. Even in the minority of cases that may have good
neurological outcomes, there will usually be functional defi-
cits. Recovery will be prolonged and may require aggressive
interventions. If these aspects are unacceptable or inappro-
priate for a patient, then the additional prognostic certainty as
to the exact neurological deficit resulting from DBI is not
helpful in decision-making. In the situation where patient
centred outcomes are recognized to be unacceptable, regard-
less of the extent of neurological improvement, then early
transition to palliative care without admission to intensive
care would be appropriate. This consensus statement is
intended to apply where the primary pathology is DBI, rather
than to the frequent situation where DBI has compounded
progressive and irreversible acute or chronic deterioration in
other organ function.
Communication
An admission to intensive care is usually for therapeutic pur-
poses, which can improve the patient’s chances of achieving an
outcome acceptable to them. Intensive care admission usually
leads to hope and expectations amongst patients, families, and
the wider MDT (including their treating intensive care team). In
the situation of admission of DBI for the purposes of prognos-
tication, such hopes and expectations need to be managed by
honest and realistic discussions of the most likely outcome.
Multispeciality
communication
is
important
in
ensuring
consistency.
It is important that all parties understand the reasons for
ICU admission, any limitations in applied therapies, and the
likely trajectory of deterioration and subsequent death. Diffi-
cult conversations may need to occur in stages, and commu-
nication should be tailored to the needs of patients and
families. Establishing the patient’s values and preferences is
useful in planning end-of-life care. Intensive care teams are
experienced in the transition from active therapy to palliative
care, and it may be that the emotional impact of this experi-
ence is reduced with intensive care admission.
Transition to active therapy
Improvements in neurological status should prompt rapid
clinical re-evaluation and consideration of escalation in ther-
apy to continue to support recovery and other specific mea-
sures to protect the brain. The patient should be discussed
once again with the regional neurosciences centre, as a change
of focus to active management of intracranial pathology may
necessitate further investigation, transfer to a tertiary neuro-
critical care facility, or both.
It is important that the treating MDT remains clear about
the aims and goals of treatment at all times. If there is

 improvement and the patient is transitioned to active therapy
this should be clearly documented, along with any limitations
that remain in force, and the new treatment goals communi-
cated to the patient’s family and the MDT. It is essential to
ensure
that
the
family’s
expectations
remain
realistic,
explaining that any initial improvement may be transitory and
is a trigger for continued observation and support, and not
necessarily an indication of an improved prognosis.
A clear understanding of patient wishes and preferences
will influence decision making in such circumstances, as dis-
cussed in the next section.
Transition of end-of-life care and organ
donation
A crucial intervention in the DBI pathway is delaying the de-
cision to WLST and achieving physiological stability.3 The
primary objective is to stabilize the patient and allow more
time to observe the patient ensuring accurate prognostication.
A
minority
of patients will
show
signs
of neurological
improvement and their treatment plan should be revised
accordingly. The majority will, however, deteriorate further or
even progress to neurological death. The increased time
afforded by delaying the WLST will also allow secondary ob-
jectives to be met, i.e. better communication, planning, and
delivering individualized end-of-life care and the consider-
ation of organ donation when appropriate.1,4
End-of-life care planning should begin at the time of
admission to the ED or ICU rather than at the time of making a
decision to WLST. This begins with a frank and open discus-
sion with the relatives including the high likelihood of death
and the possibility of survival with disability. The interview
with the relatives should also explore the patient’s values and
preferences and incorporate these into a bespoke end-of-life
care plan.33 A shared decision making approach between the
clinical staff and the family should be adopted as recom-
mended by many international critical care societies34 and
required by the Mental Capacity Act (Adults with Incapacity
Act in Scotland). This avoids both a paternalistic approach to
decision making or an informed approach where relatives
have to make difficult decisions at a stressful time.33 All
treatment plans must identify clear objectives and outcomes
within a specific time frame and these should be agreed with
the patient’s relatives.35 The value of incorporating palliative
care as part of the end-of-life care in ICU is increasingly
accepted as a means of improving the quality of care.36 It aims
to prevent and relieve suffering by means of early identifica-
tion, assessment and treatment of pain, and other physical,
psychosocial, and spiritual problems.37,38
Consideration of organ donation should begin when a pa-
tient continues to deteriorate and WLST is being considered, or
alternatively when it appears likely that a patient will meet the
criteria for confirming death using neurological criteria. Both
scenarios should lead to an early notification and discussion
with a specialist nurse in organ donation as recommended by
the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence39 and
best
practice
guidelines.40
The
relatives
should
not
be
approached to request organ donation until they have accepted
the futility of continued organ support and the reasons for the
WLST and the consequent inevitability of death, or after the
confirmation of death using neurological criteria. It is good
practice to decouple the conversation about neurological
testing or the WLST from the family approach regarding organ
donation.41 A planned and collaborative approach between the
ICU team and the specialist nurse in organ donation team
should be routine practice.35 This not only improves the quality
of the information and support provided to the family, but also
improves consent rates.42
Governance
1. There should be an identified lead clinician for the man-
agement of DBI patients within each trust. This could be
incorporated within existing clinical management roles, for
example, within the ED, ICU, or neurology/neurosurgical
services.
2. Prospective audit of patients admitted with DBI should be
undertaken locally and nationally.
3. Cases from this patient cohort should be regularly reviewed
in a multidisciplinary meeting, for example, morbidity and
mortality meetings.
4. In clinical environments where the transfer of DBI patients
is sometimes necessary, joint case review with regional
centres would be ideal.

Barriers to implementation and other
considerations
Resources
ICU capacity
Even in countries with considerably higher ICU capacity than
the UK the practical, moral, and financial impacts of using
increased ICU resources at the end of life are increasingly
recognized.43 The equitable and ethical management of scarce
ICU beds and resources is an everyday challenge for ICU con-
sultants in the UK and a skill that is expected of this role.
Relevant General Medical Council (GMC) guidance is useful, for
example, Good Medical Practice states ‘Decisions about what
treatment options can be offered may be complicated by
resource constraints e such as funding restrictions on certain
treatments in the NHS, or lack of availability of intensive care
beds. In such circumstances, you must provide as good a
standard of care as you can for the patient, while balancing
sometimes competing duties towards the wider population,
funding bodies and employers.’

Harvey et al.
 ED capacity
It is envisaged that admission of patients with DBI to critical
care units will have little impact on emergency department
capacity. While there may be a delay while a critical care bed is
obtained this is likely to be similar to, or less than, the time
taken to manage treatment withdrawal with in the ED.
Equipment
Access to specialized investigations (magnetic resonance im-
aging, EEG) or techniques (intracranial pressure monitoring)
may hamper decisions on prognostication and optimal man-
agement of the DBI patient outside a regional centre. Early
communication with the regional neuroscience centre is
recommended.
Communication and referral pathways
The frequency with which some critical care staff will manage
DBI patients will be low, particularly in smaller units. Confi-
dence in decision making will be improved by good commu-
nication and referral pathways between regional neuroscience
centres and secondary care hospitals.
Quality metrics
ICNARC, unit, and hospital mortality
The available data on outcomes for patients with DBI are
limited for the reasons outlined in the introductory section.
This lack of outcome data, and potentially the impact of high
mortality, may hamper acceptance of the potential benefit of a
prognostication window. Lack of demographic, subgroup, and
length of stay information may prejudice appropriate resource
allocation by both providers and commissioners.
Surgical outcomes
There are good reasons to question the use of mortality sta-
tistics as a measure of the quality of surgical practice44 and the
abuse of such statistics serves as a potential barrier, and a
disincentive, to decision making in the patient’s best interest
in the setting of DBI. We recommend that these patients are
excluded from the neurosurgical/ICU’s quality metrics, which
make use of standardized mortality ratios as an outcome
measure. It may be helpful if the admitting consultant were to
be the duty intensivist.
Education
Improved understanding of which patient subgroups may
benefit from a prognostication window will require collection
of quality data, and our recommendations include the capture
of robust data. The existing evidence base and the results of
future data analysis need to be understood by clinicians and
this subject area would be an appropriate topic for local
continuing professional development (CPD) sessions.
Staff training
Communication skills
Managing the expectations of relatives and staff when a pa-
tient is admitted with limited prospect of recovery will require
excellent communication skills. Advanced communication
training
can
be
a
useful
addition
to
ICU
educational
programs.45
Psychological issues
The multiprofessional staff who look after patients with
limited prospective of recovery may need psychological sup-
port. Existing unit resources may be supplemented by specific
support mechanisms, for example, Swartz rounds.
