Abstract
Objective—To investigate associations between reproductive factors and survival to age 90 years.
Methods—This was a prospective study of postmenopausal women from the Women's Health 
Initiative recruited from 1993-1998 and followed until the last outcomes evaluation on August 29, 
2014. Participants included 16,251 women born on or before August 29, 1924 for whom survival 
to age 90 during follow-up was ascertained. Women were classified as having survived to age 90 
(exceptional longevity) or died before age 90. Multivariable logistic regression models were used 
to evaluate associations of ages at menarche and menopause (natural or surgical) and reproductive 
lifespan with longevity, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive characteristics.

 Results—Participants were on average aged 74.7 years (range, 69-81 years) at baseline. Of 
16,251 women, 8,892 (55%) survived to age 90. Women aged ≥12 years at menarche had 
modestly increased odds of longevity (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.00-1.19). There was a significant trend toward increased longevity for later age at menopause 
(natural or surgical; Ptrend =0.01), with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.19 (1.04-1.36) and 1.18 (1.02-1.36) 
for 50-54 and ≥55 compared with <40 years, respectively. Later age at natural menopause as a 
separate exposure was also significantly associated with increased longevity (Ptrend =0.02). Longer 
reproductive lifespan was significantly associated with increased longevity (Ptrend=0.008). The 
odds of longevity were 13% (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.25) higher in women with >40 compared 
with <33 reproductive years.
Conclusions—Reproductive characteristics were associated with late-age survival in older 
women.

Introduction
The number of women aged 90 years or older in the United States has increased 
dramatically in the past century. Currently estimated at 1.3 million, this demographic is 
expected to quadruple by 2050.1 Despite this rapid increase, exceptional longevity is still 
considered a rare phenomenon.2 Factors predisposing to a long lifespan in women are not 
fully understood.
Although ages at menarche and menopause have been studied in relation to cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, and mortality in previous reports,3-26 their association with longevity has 
received little attention. Later ages at menarche and menopause have been associated with 
reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk in some4-6,9,13 but not all7,8,11 studies. 
Longer reproductive lifespan, defined as the time interval between menarche and 
menopause, has also been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality.26-28 These 
findings suggest that later age at menopause and longer reproductive lifespan may increase 
the likelihood of long-term survival. However, as prior studies were largely focused on 
mortality, no study to date has evaluated the association of reproductive factors with survival 
to a specific advanced age, such as 90 years.
We investigated the associations of ages at menarche and menopause and reproductive 
lifespan with survival to age 90 years in a large, ethnically diverse cohort of postmenopausal 
women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). We also determined whether associations 
varied by race/ethnicity, baseline smoking behavior, or use of hormone therapy (HT).
Methods
Study Population
The WHI is a large, prospective study investigating major determinants of chronic diseases 
in postmenopausal women. Details of the study have been previously described.29,30 Briefly,

 a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years old 
was recruited from 40 clinical centers across the United States between 1993 and 1998. A 
total of 68,133 women were randomized into one or more of three clinical trials (CT), 
including one of two HT trials, and 93,676 were enrolled in an observational study (OS). In 
2005, 76.9% of 150,075 eligible women consented to further follow-up for an additional five 
years in the Extension Study (ES), and in 2010, 86.8% of 107,706 women consented for 
another five years of follow-up. All participants provided written informed consent, and 
Institutional Review Board approval was received by all participating institutions.
The present study was restricted to CT, OS, and ES participants born on or before August 
29, 1924 who had potential to survive to age 90 years during follow-up ending August 29, 
2014. Only those with complete information on ages at menarche and menopause whose 
survival status could be ascertained were included, resulting in a cohort of 16,251 women 
aged 69 to 81 years at baseline with up to 21 years of follow-up (Figure 1).
Data Collection and Study Variables
At baseline, participants completed self-administered questionnaires assessing demographic 
characteristics, medical history, reproductive history, and lifestyle behaviors. Age at 
menarche was defined as age at first menstrual period and categorized into <12 (early 
menarche) or ≥12 (average or late menarche) years according to the literature.3,7 Age at 
natural menopause was defined as the age at which a woman last had any menstrual bleeding 
among those without a self-reported history of hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy 
before age at last menstrual bleeding. Women whose age at natural menopause was >60 
years were considered to have experienced menopause at age 60 years. Age at surgical 
menopause was defined as age at bilateral oophorectomy among those who reported having 
this procedure performed before the age at last menstrual bleeding. A separate variable 
representing age at natural or surgical menopause combined was also created. Age at 
menopause was classified into the following categories according to the literature: <40, 
40-44, 45-49, 50-54, or ≥55 years.14,15,19 Reproductive lifespan was defined as the 
difference between ages at menopause (natural or surgical) and menarche and categorized 
into quartiles (<33, 33-37, 38-40, or >40 years). Parity was defined as the number of term 
pregnancies. Information on past oral contraceptive (OC) use was also collected. HT use was 
defined according to self-reported use and participation in the HT trials as part of the CT.
Additional covariates collected at baseline included race/ethnicity, marital status, education, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, and self-rated health. Race/ethnicity was self-selected as 
American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, black/African-American, Hispanic/
Latina, white, or other. Physical activity was summarized into metabolic equivalents (MET)/
week based on the duration, frequency, and intensity of walking and other recreational 
activities.31 Trained clinic staff measured height and weight at baseline. Body mass index 
(BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, and 
categorized according to standard cutpoints.32
A history of major age-related diseases was defined as occurrence of one or more of the 
following diseases, each of which greatly increases a woman's risk of morbidity and 
mortality: coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer (excluding non-melanoma

 skin cancer), diabetes, and hip fracture. Disease status was self-reported at baseline, and 
incident diseases were identified via periodic clinic visits and mailed questionnaires 
conducted biannually for CT participants through 2005, annually for OS participants, and 
then annually by mail for all ES participants. Incident diseases except for diabetes were 
adjudicated by physician medical record review.33 Diabetes was defined as self-reported 
physician diagnosis of diabetes treated with oral medication or insulin.34
Study Outcome
Women were classified as having survived to age 90 years (exceptional longevity) or died 
before age 90 years. Death was confirmed by trained physician adjudicators based on 
hospital records, autopsy or coroner's reports, or death certificates. Periodic linkage to the 
National Death Index was performed for all participants, including those lost to follow-up. 
Survival status was ascertained for 82% of participants born on or before August 29, 1924.
Statistical Analysis
Comparisons of baseline characteristics across categories of ages at menarche and 
menopause and survival were performed using χ2 tests for categorical variables. Categories 
of age at menarche and survival were compared using two-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-
sum tests for normally distributed and non-normally distributed continuous variables, 
respectively. Analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparisons of 
continuous variables across menopausal age categories.
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine reproductive characteristics 
associated with longevity, with results reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). All multivariable models adjusted for potential confounders including 
baseline age, WHI study membership (CT or OS), race/ethnicity, education, marital status, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI, HT use, past OC use, and 
parity.7,9,10,14,19,25 Models for age at menarche were also adjusted for age at menopause 
(natural or surgical) and vice versa. Models for reproductive lifespan were adjusted for all of 
these factors except for age at menopause because of multicollinearity. Additional models 
were adjusted for a history of age-related diseases and self-rated health to determine whether 
these factors explain associations between reproductive characteristics and longevity. Tests 
for linear trend were performed by including reproductive variables as continuous predictors 
in the models. Interactions between reproductive characteristics and race/ethnicity, HT use, 
and smoking were assessed using likelihood ratio tests. To determine whether age at 
menopause was associated with longevity irrespective of type (i.e., natural vs. surgical), an 
interaction between age at menopause and a binary variable indicating whether menopause 
occurred due to natural or surgical reasons was also tested in the multivariable model. P-
values were two-tailed and considered nominally statistically significant at P<0.05. All 
analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
At baseline, women were on average 74.7 (standard deviation [SD] 2.3) years old (Table 1). 
Average ages at menarche and menopause (natural or surgical) were 12.8 (SD 1.4; range

 9-17) and 49.0 (SD 6.4; range 30-60) years, respectively. Women had a mean of 36.1 (SD 
6.5; range 13-51) reproductive years. Reproductive lifespan was highly correlated with age 
at menopause (r=0.98; p<0.001) but weakly correlated with age at menarche (r=−0.19; 
p<0.001).
At baseline, women with later ages at menarche and menopause were more likely to be in 
very good health and have never smoked, and less likely to be obese or have a history of 
diabetes (Table 1). Women with later menarche were also less likely to be college graduates 
or have a history of CHD and more likely to have later age at menopause and higher parity. 
Women with later age at menopause were more likely to be married or living as married, be 
college graduates, report higher levels of physical activity, have a history of past OC use, and 
have higher parity.
Of 16,251 women who met the inclusion criteria for this study, 8,892 (55%) survived to age 
90. Average age at death was 83.7 (SD 3.9) years, and the most common causes of death 
were cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer. At baseline, women who 
lived to 90 years were more likely to report higher levels of physical activity and be older, 
college graduates, current drinkers, and in excellent or very good health (Table 2). Women 
achieving longevity were also less likely to be current smokers, be obese, or have a history 
of age-related diseases.
The odds of longevity were modestly higher in women with menarche at ≥12 years (adjusted 
OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.19) than <12 years (Table 3). There was a significant linear trend 
toward increased longevity for later age at natural or surgical menopause (Ptrend=0.01), with 
adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of 1.19 (1.04-1.36) and 1.18 (1.02-1.36) for 50-54 and ≥55 
compared with <40 years, respectively. There was no significant interaction between age at 
menopause and natural vs. surgical menopause in the multivariable model (data not shown). 
In a separate model, later age at natural menopause was significantly associated with 
increased longevity (Ptrend=0.02).
There was a significant association of reproductive lifespan with longevity (Ptrend=0.008). 
Compared with women with <33 reproductive years, the odds of longevity were elevated 
across all other quartiles of reproductive lifespan. When defining reproductive lifespan as the 
difference between ages at natural menopause and menarche, findings were similar 
(Ptrend=0.01; adjusted OR 1.09 [95% CI 0.99-1.20]; OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.06-1.29]; and OR 
1.12 [95% CI 1.02-1.24] for 33-37, 38-40, and >40 compared with <33 years).
Findings for age at menarche were no longer significant after adjustment for a history of 
age-related diseases (and specifically, CHD) and self-rated health. Findings for age at 
menopause (natural or surgical) were no longer significant after adjustment for self-rated 
health, but persisted after adjustment for age-related diseases. Findings for reproductive 
lifespan were similar after additional adjustment for these factors. No interactions between 
reproductive factors and race/ethnicity, smoking, or HT use were observed (data not shown).

 Discussion
In this large, prospective study in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of postmenopausal 
women with up to 21 years of follow-up, survival to age 90 years was significantly higher in 
women with later menarche and menopause. Additionally, longer reproductive lifespan was 
significantly associated with survival to age 90 years. Findings were independent of 
demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, BMI, reproductive factors, past OC use, and 
HT use.
Some studies have observed decreased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality at older 
menarcheal ages.3-6,22 In a meta-analysis, each one-year increase in age at menarche was 
associated with a 3% lower risk of all-cause mortality.3 Another study observed that the 
association of later menarche with lower mortality was attenuated in women older than 80 
years, suggesting that age at menarche may become less important over time as a risk factor 
for survival.5 Concordantly, we observed a modest increase in survival to age 90 years 
associated with an average or later age at menarche.
We found that later age at menopause overall, age at natural menopause as a separate 
exposure, and longer reproductive lifespan were associated with increased odds of longevity. 
Age at natural menopause has been associated with mortality in some10,14,16 but not all25 
studies. The association of age at surgical menopause with mortality has also been 
inconsistent across studies.16,17,19,20,24,25 A prior study among white women observed 
reduced mortality with increased (i.e., ≥40) reproductive years.28
Inconsistent associations of age at menopause with mortality may be due to varying 
definitions of age at menopause, an important consideration when interpreting associations 
of this reproductive factor with health outcomes. Previous studies used varying methods to 
determine age at natural or surgical menopause, making direct comparisons with our results 
difficult.14,17-20 For example, some studies determined age at menopause by asking whether 
menstruation stopped due to natural or surgical reasons, without querying history of 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy;17,20 thus, misclassification may have biased 
findings. Our definition of age at menopause was comprehensive by taking into account age 
at final menstrual period, hysterectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. However, few studies 
have examined age at menopause as a variable including both natural and surgical 
menopause.19,24 A study in >12,000 Dutch women observed a 2% reduction in mortality 
risk for every one-year increase in age at menopause occurring naturally or surgically, and 
life expectancy was two years longer among women aged at ≥55 compared with <40 years at 
menopause.19 It is also possible that the association of later age at menopause with longevity 
may be partly explained by lower odds of survival due to comorbidities and adverse health 
status among women who experienced premature menopause, irrespective of the cause.35
Several mechanisms may explain the association of reproductive characteristics with 
longevity. Early menarche has been associated with increased risk of adult obesity, diabetes, 
and CVD.9,12,36,37 Later age at menopause and longer reproductive lifespan have been 
associated with decreased CVD risk, suggesting that prolonged endogenous ovarian 
hormone exposure may be cardioprotective23,27,38, or conversely, that factors such as

 smoking that may damage the ovary causing earlier menopause also damage the 
cardiovascular system.39,40 Although our findings persisted after adjustment for BMI and 
diabetes, age at menarche was no longer significant after adjustment for CHD and self-rated 
health, and age at menopause was no longer significant after adjustment for self-rated health. 
We did observe that women with later age at menarche were less likely to have a history of 
CHD and those with later age at menopause were more likely to be in excellent health at 
baseline, suggesting a possible explanation for our findings.
Reproductive events, such as menarche, menopause, and pregnancy, may simply be 
indicators of underlying health status. For example, hypertension of pregnancy and 
gestational diabetes, which typically resolve after delivery, may be harbingers of later type 2 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease that were unmasked by pregnancy.41,42 In-utero 
exposures and childhood exposures (e.g., obesity) can also play a role in reproductive health 
status.43,44 Genetic factors have been associated with age at menarche, ages at natural and 
surgical menopause, and longevity45-48, suggesting that a common set of genetic factors may 
explain the link between these reproductive factors and longevity. For example, a genome-
wide association study of age at natural menopause identified genetic variants involved in 
DNA replication and repair pathways, which are pathways central to aging.46 Specifically, 
the DNA repair gene exonuclease 1 (EXO1) was significantly associated with age at 
menopause and has been previously associated with increased life expectancy among female 
centenarians.49
This study had several limitations. Women who participated in the WHI may have been 
healthier at baseline than the general population of postmenopausal women. Furthermore, 
women who enrolled for additional follow-up were more likely to be white, educated, and 
healthier at baseline than those who withdrew, thus our findings may be biased by selective 
attrition. This may explain the large number of exceptional survivors in our cohort. Ages at 
menarche and menopause were reliant on self-reported recall of past events that could not be 
verified with medical records, which could result in misclassification. However, a previous 
study showed recall of age at menarche to be highly reproducible.50 Age at menopause has 
been shown to be reproducible but more variable with increasing years since menopause.51 
However, any misclassification of age at menopause is likely to be non-differential, given 
that survivors and non-survivors had similar average baseline age. The WHI cohort was 
recruited using extensive community-based outreach, and principally using mass mailings, 
which does not represent a national probability sample. Although information was available 
on a large array of covariates, we did not have information on family history of longevity, 
and we did not examine occupation, stress, or dietary variables, which may also predict 
longevity.
Strengths of this study include the prospective design with 21 years of follow-up, high 
retention of study participants over time, adjudicated outcome ascertainment, and large, 
multi-ethnic sample of postmenopausal women who reached nonagenarian status. The large 
sample size gave us excellent power to detect even small associations with precision. This 
study included a cohort of women with a narrow age range, thus limiting potential bias due 
to birth cohort effects.

 Conclusions
Average or later age at menarche, later age at menopause, and longer reproductive lifespan 
were associated with higher likelihood of survival to age 90 years among postmenopausal 
women. Further studies are needed to elucidate lifestyle, genetic, and environmental factors 
associated with ages at menarche and menopause and reproductive lifespan to determine 
potential mechanisms explaining the link between characteristics of reproductive lifespan 
and longevity. With secular trends showing decreasing age at menarche, increasing age at 
menopause, and a concurrent rise in longevity,2,52,53 additional studies in younger birth 
cohorts will be needed in the future to precisely define the relationship between the timing 
of reproductive events and a woman's length of life.
