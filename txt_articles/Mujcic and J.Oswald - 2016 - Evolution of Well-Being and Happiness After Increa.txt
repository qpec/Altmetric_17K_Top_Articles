 Evolution of Well-Being and Happiness After
Increases in Consumption of Fruit and Vegetables
Redzo Mujcic, PhD, and Andrew J.Oswald, DPhil
Objectives. To explore whether improvements in psychological well-being occur after
increases in fruit and vegetable consumption.
Methods. We examined longitudinal food diaries of 12 385 randomly sampled Aus-
tralian adults over 2007, 2009, and 2013 in the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics
in Australia Survey. We adjusted effects on incident changes in happiness and life sat-
isfaction for people’s changing incomes and personal circumstances.
Results. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption was predictive of increased
happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being. They were up to 0.24 life-satisfaction
points (for an increase of 8 portions a day), which is equal in size to the psychological
gain of moving from unemployment to employment. Improvements occurred within
24 months.
Conclusions. People’s motivation to eat healthy food is weakened by the fact that
physical health benefits accrue decades later, but well-being improvements from in-
creased consumption of fruit and vegetables are closer to immediate.
Policy implications. Citizens could be shown evidence that “happiness” gains from
healthy eating can occur quickly and many years before enhanced physical health. (Am J

ruits and vegetables are known to provide
important health benefits.1,2 Yet, in
Western society, the typical citizen eats an
unhealthy diet (US data are available at
http://www.cdc.gov/brfss and European
data at http://www.eufic.org). The difficulty
of persuading people to consume more fruits
and vegetables remains a serious one.3–7
In this study, we explored a new approach
to the problem. The article is designed partly
for the scientific researcher and partly for the
public health practitioner. It uncovers evi-
dence consistent with a longitudinal con-
nection between the consumption of certain
foods (especially fruits and vegetables) and
later subjective well-being, and a channel that
appears to be independent of long-run health.
In disciplines beyond public health research,
the study of happiness and well-being has
generated a large modern literature.8,9 The
potential influence of food has been virtually
ignored. Traditional research on well-being has
focused upon the role of economic, personal,
and political influences,9–11 and in character
has been steadily moving in emphasis from
cross-sectional to longitudinal analysis.12 That
the scholarly literature has developed in the way
described is perhaps unsurprising. First, most
data sets do not record information on the foods
eaten by individuals; second, the main con-
tributors to the happiness and well-being lit-
erature have been researchers from the classic
social science disciplines. Hence, it is perhaps
understandable that the role of foodin thelist of
determinants of well-being has so far been
given little attention, even though, in an im-
portant line of work, researchers have, within
a different literature, drawn attention to the
potential social significance of diet.13
We used a representative panel of 12 000
individuals to trace the potential linkages
running from diet to later life satisfaction and
happiness. The study is intended as a comple-
ment to the aforementioned literature on so-
cioeconomic influences. In its style, the study
fits within an emerging panel-data literature on
human well-being. The analysis was first done
by following individuals between 2007 and
2009. Just as the project was completed,
however, new data were released, which made
it possible to check the calculations also for
the period 2009 to 2013 (these replication
findings are reported in Tables A, B, and C,
available as supplements to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org).
There are precursors to this article. In-
novative research by Tamlin Conner and
collaborators14 has found—using data on
daily food diaries on 281 students tracked over
a 3-weekperiod—that a high level of fruit and
vegetable consumption appears to be pre-
dictive of greater emotional well-being on the
following day. Various cross-sectional papers
have also pointed to the possible existence of
a statistical connection between psychological
well-being and the amount of fruits and
vegetables eaten, and have shown that this
correlation survives the inclusion of a large
number of covariates.15
There is also a small longitudinal literature
that suggests there may be positive benefits
from a high intake of fruits and vegetables,
although, crucially, that literature has not
been able to control for some of the key
confounders such as individuals’ levels of
income.16–19 There have also been 3 im-
portant small randomized controlled trials on
nutritional counseling and on the provision of
healthy food and snacks,20–22 which find
some evidence that a higher intake of fruits

 and vegetables may be associated with im-
proved psychological health (as well as
physical health). Another set of writings has
tried to understand obesity and its links to
subjective well-being.23,24 These suggest that
there is an inverse—although relatively
small—correlation between body mass index
(BMI; defined as weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in meters) and
mental well-being.
This article documents not cross-sectional
patterns but rather the longitudinal (the
so-called “change-on-change”) linkages be-
tween fruit and vegetable consumption and
mental well-being; such an approach helps
ensure that any observed relationship is not
merely a spurious cross-sectional pattern caused
by omitted confounding factors such as per-
sonality, background wealth, or family up-
bringing. Cognizant of the work of others,25
we examined whether the level of fruit and
vegetable consumption today is predictive of
the level of later well-being, while inquiring
into reverse-causality concerns hitherto un-
addressed in the happiness literature.
METHODS
The main data in this study come from
waves 7 and 9 (years 2007 and 2009) of the
Household, Income, and LabourDynamics in
Australia (HILDA) Survey, a nationally rep-
resentative panel survey that began in 2001.
The HILDA Survey collects annual longi-
tudinal information from members of Aus-
tralian households who are aged 15 years and
older. It provides information on a total of
13 969 individuals from 7682 different
households interviewed since the first wave.
Data are collected each year by face-to-face
interviews and self-completion question-
naires. The former technique ismainly used to
gather the demographic and socioeconomic
information, and the latter is adopted to
measure health and lifestyle choices.
After we excluded respondents with
missing information on the key outcome and
control variables, the total sample available for
this study consisted of 12 389 individuals
(aged 15–93 years) and 20 136 person-year
observations. No observations were de-
liberately dropped. As would be expected,
however, the sample sizes vary slightly across
the different well-being measures.
Two questions relating to fruit and veg-
etable consumption were available in waves 7
and 9. The corresponding questionnaires
asked: “Including tinned, frozen, dried and
fresh fruit, on how many days in a usual week
do you eat fruit?” and “Including tinned,
frozen and fresh vegetables, on how many
days in a usual week do you eat vegetables?”
with possible responses ranging from 0 (“do
not eat any fruit or vegetables in a usual
week”) to 7 days per week. For individuals
who responded with some positive frequency
to these questions, the following was also
asked: “On a day when you eat fruit, how
many serves of fruit do you usually eat?” and
“On a day when you eat vegetables, how
many serves of vegetables do you usually eat?”
The survey respondents were shown
flashcards to visually define a serving size or
portion (photographs of these are given as
Figures A and B, available as supplements to
the online version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org), with possible answers rang-
ing from “1” to “6 or more” portions. This
visual approach is for simplicity and clarity.26
We multiplied the responses to the previously
mentioned paired (frequency and quantity)
questions to form a weekly consumption
amount of fruits and vegetables, respectively.
We then divided each resulting product by 7
to arrive at the average daily amount. We then
added the average intake of fruit by survey
respondents to their average intake of vege-
tables to compute the combined average daily
consumption of fruits and vegetables. The
mean value was 3.84 servings per day with
a standard deviation of 2.01. Some re-
spondents said they did not consume any
fruits or vegetables in a typical week. This
group forms the “none” or “zero” con-
sumption category. Approximately 85% of
respondents had fewer than 3 daily servings
of fruit; 60% consumed fewer than 3 daily
servings of vegetables. A small fraction of
people consumed, on average, both more
than 5 servings of fruit (1.83%) or vegetables
(7.75%) each day. Table D, available as
a supplement to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org, contains
more detailed summary statistics on the
separate fruit and vegetable intake measures.
The first dependent variable examined is
self-reported life satisfaction, derived from the
question, “All things considered, how satis-
fied are you with your life?” Respondents
were told to “Pick a number between 0 and
10 to indicate how satisfied you are,” and
that “the more satisfied you are the higher
number you should pick.” Overall, the mean
score for the sampled individuals in Australia
was 7.91 with a standard deviation of 1.41.
About two thirds of respondents reported
a life satisfaction score of more than 7 out of
10. As an additional check, we used a second
measure. A generic health variable available
in the HILDA data set is the Medical Out-
comes Short Form (SF-36) Questionnaire.
The SF-36 is one of the most widely used and
validated self-completion measures of health
status available, consisting of 36 items or
questions; 35 of them are used to derive 8
health subscales or indices. The respondent is
asked, “How much of the time in the past 4
weeks” did he or she experience particular
types of feelings or symptoms, including
“been a happy person.” The resulting re-
sponse distribution for the latter question is as
follows: 1% (none of the time); 4.8% (a little of
the time); 13.9% (some of the time); 19.5%
(a good bit of the time); 51.9% (most of the
time); 8.9% (all of the time). The individuals’
responses were coded from 1 (none of the
time) to 6 (all of the time), with a mean
happiness score of 4.43 out of 6.
RESULTS
Figure 1 is a simple graphical illustration of
the study’s key result for life satisfaction. A
similar histogram holds also for happiness data.
The plot in Figure 1 is based on a so-called
fixed-effect regression equation. It depicts the
(uncorrected) longitudinal relationship—the
change-on-change relationship—between
people’s subjective well-being and 9 different
levels of fruit and vegetable consumption.
Further descriptive information is provided in
the material available as a supplement to the
online version of this article at http://www.
ajph.org. Alternative kinds of scatter plots are
given as Figures C and D in that material.
The regression analyses reported in Table 1
provide formal evidence. These correct for
other influences following sources.8,29 The
key coefficient in the first column of Table 1 is
0.03 (B = 0.03; 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 0.01, 0.04; P = .002). This implies that
a change from the lowest levels to the highest
levels of fruit and vegetable consumption

 would, on average, be associated with a rise
in life satisfaction of approximately 0.24
life-satisfaction points.
The implied effect size is substantial. At
first glance, the number 0.24 might be
thought to indicate that the consequences of
fruit and vegetable intake are minor. That
interpretation is mistaken; it stems from
a blurring of the distinction between inter-
person variance and intraperson variance.
As in much of the longitudinal public health
research, in this study we tried to understand
not the (inevitably high) cross-sectional var-
iation in human well-being but instead
intraperson changes that might be capable of
being influenced by public interventions.
In column 1 of Table 1, this requires that
a number such as 0.24 (which is 8 times the
coefficient of 0.03) has to be added to the
number 7.81. As can be seen from models 2
and 3 in Table 1, the effect is the equivalent in
absolute size to (a negative direction) that of
becoming unemployed or approximately half
the size of the emotional consequence of
marital separation. Such an effect size is large.
If model 1 of Table 1 were the only re-
gression result available, it would be plausible
to believe that the relationship is spurious. It
might be being driven by omitted variables—
for example, someone becoming richer
through time and becoming happier and
simultaneously eating in a healthier way be-
cause they could now afford it, or divorcing
a spouse and becoming less happy and also
eating in a less healthy way. However, models
2 and 3 in Table 1 imply that such in-
terpretations would be incorrect. The ana-
lyses here include extra covariates: the natural
logarithm of household income, age, edu-
cation, whether working, marital status,
health, children, alcohol and food patterns,
BMI, and exercise (for a detailed specification
of these variables see Tables D and E, available
as supplements to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org). In Table 1,
there is no detectable influence from BMI.
Table F in the supplemental material, how-
ever, is consistent with the existence of an
inverse relationship between current BMI
and future well-being.
Figure 1 uses coefficients from longitudinal
estimates. Fixed-effect estimation is equiva-
lent here to a first-difference estimator,28 so
they emerge, in effect, from regressing the
change in well-being between 2007 and 2009
on the change over that period in variables
such as food consumption, income, marital
status, and so on. This is why, in Table 1,
attributes such as gender and ethnicity are
omitted; they are unchanging and thus have
automatically been differenced out. Table 2
repeats the calculations for the alternative
dependent variable of feeling happy. Results
are similar.
An open scientific issue is whether diet
might have slow-acting effects on mental
well-being. The analyses reported in Table 3
explore this. They treat the data as if from
a prospective setting. Here the regression
equations reveal that fruit and vegetable
consumption in the current year is predictive
of higher well-being—measured either as life
satisfaction or as happiness—in the future
even after control for current well-being (as
well as control for the list of covariates in the
tables). Hence, in the life-satisfaction equa-
tion in Table 3, for example, where the de-
pendent variable is life satisfaction measured
in period t+1, a variable for fruit and vegetable
consumption in period t is statistically sig-
nificant at the 99.9% confidence level
(B = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.04; P < .001),
while holding constant life satisfaction in
period t, which itself enters, as would be
expected, with a large positive coefficient.
Similar results are found for happiness in
Table 3. Tables F and H, available as sup-
plements to the online version of this article,
provide the equation specifications.
Such prospective analysis is subject to
a potential objection. It is that some form of
correlation might run in both directions si-
multaneously. To check for this, we did
a form of Granger causality test, and it is given
in the supplemental material. Tables I and J
test whether fruit and vegetable consumption
in the future can be predicted from the level of
life satisfaction or happiness in the current
period. In neither case is there evidence for
such reverse-causality; the effect does not
achieve statistical significance in either of the
tables. In Table I, in fact, the variable has the
wrong point-estimate sign (B = –0.003; 95%
CI = –0.03, 0.02; P > .250).
We checked whether the findings can be
reproduced on a new round of the panel data
set, which was released toward the end of our
project, for the year of 2013. The paper’s key
results can be replicated; the findings are
presented in Tables A, B, and C, available as
supplements to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org. It can be seen
in Tables A, B, and C that the coefficients
remain essentially identical to those presented
in the main body of the paper.

 independent variables—rather than com-
bined into the number of daily fruit and
vegetable portions variable that has been
traditional in research on physical health. The
results (not reported) suggested that for
happiness and life-satisfaction equations it was
appropriate to combine them into a single
fruit-and-vegetable variable. We could not
reject the null hypothesis of an identical
well-being gradient for fruit intake and
vegetable intake.
Last,we made another effort, in addition to
the Granger causality tests, to tackle the in-
evitably complex issue of causality. To do so,
we exploited a public campaign that was
designed to encourage healthy eating in
Australia. Scientifically, the advantage of such
a campaign is that, from a researcher’s point
of view, an advertising campaign of this
kind could be seen as an exogenous posi-
tive “shock” to people’s motivation to eat
a greater number of portions of fruit and
vegetables. Hence it offers the possibility of
a form of natural experiment: as the campaign
came in, with different timings in different
states, it might be expected that it would shift
people’s consumption decisions at these
particular points in time. Any consequences
for mental well-being and physical well-
being might then go on to be detectable.
Known as the“Go for 2&5 Campaign,” this
initiative began in the state of Western Australia
in the year 2004. It spread, at different speeds,
into most of the other Australian states.
Two-stage least squares estimation can then be
done.30 The instrumental variable estimates are
provided in Tables K through N, available as
supplements to the online version of this article
at http://www.ajph.org.
In this form of inquiry, we exploited the fact
that different Australian states had different
number of years over which they systematically
promoted the consumption of fruits and veg-
etables. Victoria did so for zero years; New
South Wales for 2 years; Tasmania for 4 years;
South Australia for 4 years; Queensland for
5 years; the Northern Territories for 7 years;
Australian Capital Territory for 7 years; and
Western Australia for 10 years. Thus, we cre-
ated a variable for intensity of campaign. This
adds up the length (i.e., number of years) that
a state had previously had a campaign. We
thereby gave all states in our analysis an
integer-valued entry, from 0 for Victoria to
10 for Western Australia, as a measure of the
different intensities of the public fruit-and-
vegetable campaign in the different states. In
plainer English, the citizens of each region can
be thought of as having a different level of
“publicly sponsored push” to eat in a healthy
way. That policy variable can be viewed as an
extraneous influence upon later state levels of
consumption of fruit and vegetables.
Analytically, we then took 2 steps. The first
was to estimate a consumption of fruit plus

Note. CI = confidence interval. First dependent variable is life satisfaction (range = 0–10) in period t+1
(year 2009). Second dependent variable is “been a happy person” (range: 1–6) in period t+1 (year 2009).
Period t denotes the year 2007. The full estimation results (with a complete set of control variable
coefficient estimates) are available in Tables F and H, available as supplements to the online version of
this article at http://www.ajph.org.The table’s title uses the term “prospective” for simplicity; it would be
possible to object to this on strict semantic grounds; we obtained the data after the wave-2 information
on year 2009 had been collected.

 vegetables equation (not a well-being equa-
tion) for the year 2013. We then tested
whether a variable for campaign intensity
came in positively in that equation. We found
that it did, with a statistically significant co-
efficient. Hence, there is evidence that the
Australian healthy-eating campaign had an
effect on fruit and vegetable intake. Then, in
the second stage of our 2-stage least-squares
estimation, we estimated a set of instrumented
well-being regression equations for the year
2013. The purpose was to correct for si-
multaneity bias and the possibility of reverse
causality. After doing so, we found an
instrumented variable for fruit and vegetable
consumption to enter positively in a well-
being equation (as in Table K, available as
a supplement to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org). Hence,
there is some evidence that the Australian
healthy-eating campaign may have improved
people’s levels of life satisfaction and happi-
ness. Nevertheless, it is not possible statisti-
cally to be certain of that conclusion. As is
often found in the statistical literature on
2-stage least-squares estimation, the level of
statistical power here was insufficient for us to
obtain truly small standard errors in the
second-stage equations. The study’s confi-
dence levels did not exceed 75% when we
used this final form of statistical method.
DISCUSSION
These findings are consistent with the idea
that eating certain foods is a form of in-
vestment in future happiness and well-being.
The implications of fruit and vegetable
consumption are estimated to be substantial
and to operate within the space of 2 years—
too quickly to be a reflection of the physical
advantages of diet for outcomes such as car-
diovascular disease documented by earlier
researchers.2 Moreover, as shown in Table O,
available as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org, the
fruit-and-vegetables effect is still visible if the
regression equation includes an extra covar-
iate for self-reported health.
In this study, we examined data on the lives
of a nationally representative sample of ap-
proximately 12 000 individuals between 2007
and 2009. We are able to check, and replicate,
its main findings for additional newly released
data over the period 2009 to 2013. We also
did prospective analysis and Granger causality
tests. By using information on the Australian
“Go for 2&5 Campaign,” we also attempted
to offer instrumental-variable estimates.
In a sense, this article offers a new possi-
bility for future public-policy programs to
encourage healthy eating—the possibility
that citizens in western society could be given
evidence that happiness gains from healthy
eating may occur much more quickly than
any long-distant improvement to people’s
physical health. If individuals weigh the likely
benefits of fruit and vegetables in their diet,
and set that against any perceived costs, both
pecuniary and nonpecuniary, of doing so,
then scientific evidence of extra psychological
gains from a healthy diet might help to per-
suade people to raise their intake of fruit
and vegetables.
Two main issues remain to be tackled.
First, although at the end of this study we
attempted to address the causality problem by
using instrumental variable methods, a huge
randomized trial would lead to a natural form
of scientific evidence. The well-being re-
search literature is, however, far from such
a point; a randomized trial would have its own
inherent difficulties, because a double-blind
procedure would not be feasible, so placebo
effects would be hard to disentangle; and
large-scale longitudinal studies, of the sort
described in this study, would still be required
as part of a body of persuasive evidence.
Second, the channels from eating certain food
types to subjective well-being remain to be
properly understood. Other studies discuss
a variety of intriguing possibilities.18,31 These
include a potential influence from vitamin
B12 upon the eventual production of human
serotonin, as well as the idea of a role for folate
deficiency.32 A further potential channel33 is
that microbiota may modulate brain chem-
istry. Lastly, it may be possible eventually to
link the current research to a new literature on
antioxidants that is suggestive of a connection
between human optimism and carotenoid in
the blood.34 Further connections between
the biology and practical public health policy
of healthy eating35 remain to be forged. Such
issues demand attention.
