IMPORTANCE Very preterm infants are at risk of developing encephalopathy of prematurity
and long-term neurodevelopmental delay. Erythropoietin treatment is neuroprotective in
animal experimental and human clinical studies.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether prophylactic early high-dose recombinant human
erythropoietin (rhEPO) in preterm infants improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years’
corrected age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Preterm infants born between 26 weeks 0 days’ and 31
weeks 6 days’ gestation were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicenter trial in Switzerland between 2005 and 2012. Neurodevelopmental assessments
at age 2 years were completed in 2014.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to receive either rhEPO (3000 IU/kg)
or placebo (isotonic saline, 0.9%) intravenously within 3 hours, at 12 to 18 hours, and at 36 to
42 hours after birth.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was cognitive development assessed
with the Mental Development Index (MDI; norm, 100 [SD, 15]; higher values indicate better
function) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second edition (BSID-II) at 2 years
corrected age. The minimal clinically important difference between groups was 5 points
(0.3 SD). Secondary outcomes were motor development (assessed with the Psychomotor
Development Index), cerebral palsy, hearing or visual impairment, and anthropometric
growth parameters.
RESULTS Among 448 preterm infants randomized (mean gestational age, 29.0 [range,
26.0-30.9] weeks; 264 [59%] female; mean birth weight, 1210 [range, 490-2290] g), 228
were randomized to rhEPO and 220 to placebo. Neurodevelopmental outcome data were
available for 365 (81%) at a mean age of 23.6 months. In an intention-to-treat analysis, mean
MDI was not statistically significantly different between the rhEPO group (93.5 [SD, 16.0]
[95% CI, 91.2 to 95.8]) and the placebo group (94.5 [SD, 17.8] [95% CI, 90.8 to 98.5])
(difference, −1.0 [95% CI, −4.5 to 2.5]; P = .56). No differences were found between groups in
the secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among very preterm infants who received prophylactic early
high-dose rhEPO for neuroprotection, compared with infants who received placebo, there
were no statistically significant differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years.
Follow-up for cognitive and physical problems that may not become evident until later in life
is required.

Methods
Study Design
This phase 3 study was designed as a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with 1:1 allocation
of patients to high-dose rhEPO or placebo. Five Swiss perinatal
centers, 3 university hospitals (Basel, Geneva, and Zurich) and
2districthospitals(AarauandChur),wereincludedinthestudy.
Enrollment occurred between 2005 and 2012, with the date of
last neurodevelopmental evaluation in 2014. Vials containing
the study drug were prepared in the pharmacy of Zurich Uni-
versity Hospital according to a randomization list stratified per
center and labeled, shipped, and stored according to the Swiss
TherapeuticProductsAct.16 Therandomizationlistwasknown
only to the pharmacist. Parents, physicians, nurses, and exter-
nal statisticians were unaware of treatment allocation. All neu-
rodevelopmentalassessmentswereconductedinablindedman-
ner. Approval to conduct this study was granted by the ethical
committeeoftheZurichUniversityChildren’
sHospital,theethi-
calcommitteeofCantonZurich,andtheSwissAgencyforThera-
peutic Products (Swissmedic). Written informed consent was
obtained from the parents of eligible infants.
Study Population
The study protocol (Supplement 1) has been described
previously.17 Briefly, very preterm infants born between 26
weeks 0 days’and 31 weeks 6 days’gestation were eligible for
enrollment within the first 3 hours after birth. Exclusion cri-
teria were a genetically defined syndrome, a severe congeni-
tal malformation adversely affecting life expectancy or neu-
rodevelopment, severe intraventricular hemorrhage before
randomization, and a priori palliative care.
Intervention
rhEPO or an equivalent volume of isotonic saline (NaCl, 0.9%)
placebo was administered intravenously before 3 hours, at 12
to 18 hours, and at 36 to 42 hours after birth. A single dose con-
sisted of 25μg (3000 IU) rhEPO per kg of body weight dis-
solved in 1mL distilled water. One mL per kg birth weight was
administered intravenously during a period of 3 minutes. The
maximal dose was 1.5 mL (37.5μg [4500 IU]) rhEPO for in-
fants weighing 1.5 kg or more. Similarly, the placebo dose con-
sisted of 1 mL of NaCl (0.9%) per kilogram birth weight.
Monitoring
Serial cerebral ultrasound assessment was carried out on day
1, days 7 to 10, and then every 14 days until 36 weeks 0 days’
postmenstrual age or at discharge if discharged before. Study
drug and all other medications were documented, as well as
any complications.
The Swissmedic temporarily suspended the study after an
infant in the study died of severe intracranial hemorrhage and
the parents lodged a claim for compensation. The parents con-
sidered this critical event to be attributable to the experimen-
tal drug; disclosure of group allocation revealed that the in-
fant was in the rhEPO group. The ethics committees and
Swissmedic asked for a review by independent experts, who
concluded that there was no evidence for a causal relation be-
tween rhEPO and intracranial hemorrhage. Neither the inves-
tigators nor the statisticians were involved in the review by the
independent experts and remained blinded to the outcomes.
After an 11-month hold, enrollment continued with the fol-
lowing constraint: Infants with hemorrhage grade 2 or more
detected before dose 3 of rhEPO had to be excluded.

velopment, second edition (BSID-II).26 Infants who were so se-
verelyimpairedthatstructuredtestingwiththeBSID-IIcouldnot
beperformedwereassignedamentaldevelopmentindex(MDI)
andpsychomotordevelopmentindex(PDI)of49(≤3SD).Norm
value of both MDI and PDI is 100 (SD, 15), with high values indi-
cating better function. Cerebral palsy was graded according to
theGrossMotorFunctionClassificationSystemofPalisanoetal27

either by direct examination or parents’report. Severe hearing
impairment was defined as the absence of useful hearing, even
withaids(ie,>90dBhearinglevel);severevisualimpairmentwas
definedasblindnessoronlyperceptionoflightorlight-reflecting
objects. The composite outcome category “severe neurodevel-
opmental impairment” was defined as 1 or more of the follow-
ing: a BSID-II index less than 2 SDs below the mean (ie, MDI or
PDI <70); cerebral palsy with Gross Motor Function Classifica-
tion System level 3 to 5; severe hearing or visual impairment.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the MDI at 2 years’corrected age,
while secondary outcomes were motor development as as-
sessed by the PDI; cerebral palsy, severe hearing impairment,
and severe visual impairment; and weight, length, and head
circumference. Post hoc exploratory outcomes were defined
as the binary outcomes of MDI or PDI less than 70, which are
indicative for neurodevelopmental impairment, and the com-
posite outcome survival without severe neurodevelopmen-
tal impairment. Reports of other secondary outcomes, ie, neo-
natal outcomes12 and cerebral MRI14,15 at term equivalent in a
subgroupofstudyinfants,havealreadybeenassessedandpub-
lished. No excess in mortality or major adverse events were
found in the rhEPO group vs placebo at hospital discharge.12
An association between early high-dose rhEPO and a reduced
incidence of white and gray matter injuries was found.14,15
Statistical Analysis
The study hypothesis was that the mean MDI at 2 years’cor-
rected age in the rhEPO group was 5 points (0.3 SD) higher than
in the placebo group, based on the experience of the investi-
gators and other study groups. A minimal sample size of 176
infants per group was calculated, assuming a 2-sided α error
of .05 and a power (1 − β) of 0.8. To compensate for dropouts,
we added 20%, targeting at least 211 infants per group. χ2 test
and independent t test were used to compare baseline char-
acteristics between groups.
The primary investigation was an intention-to-treat (ITT)
analysis, the infants being compared according to the treat-
ment they were assigned at study entry. The unadjusted treat-
ment effect was determined using a linear regression model,
which is equivalent to an unpaired t test. The model assump-
tion was that the observations in both groups come from a nor-
mal distribution. This assumption was not violated.
An unadjusted per-protocol analysis was also performed,
restricted to patients who were actually treated as in the pro-
tocol.ThesametypeofITTandper-protocolanalyseswereper-
formed for all secondary and exploratory outcomes.
Two post hoc exploratory investigations of the ITT analy-
sis of the primary outcome were performed. First, a sensitiv-
ity analysis including the 25 infants who died before follow-up
and so were excluded from the primary investigation was per-
formed by imputing the worst MDI, ie, 49. Second, analyses
of subgroups of study infants with especially high risk for de-
velopmental delay were performed; ie, infants with gesta-
tional age less than 28 weeks and infants with intraventricu-
lar hemorrhage grade 2 or higher. In addition, the MDI in the
subset of infants included in the previous examination of the
associationofearlyhigh-doserhEPOandtheincidenceofwhite
andgraymatterinjuriesattermequivalentwasdetermined.14,15

Outcome Assessment
Primary Outcome
In the ITT analysis, MDI was 93.5 (SD, 16.0) in the rhEPO group
and 94.5 (SD, 17.8) in the placebo group. The difference of −1.0
(95% CI, −4.5 to 2.5; P = .56) was not statistically significant
(Table 2). The sensitivity analysis including infants who died
confirmed this result (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
In the per-protocol analysis, the mean difference in MDI
was also not significant, ie, −0.7 (95% CI, −3.0 to 4.4; P = .70)
(eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Secondary Outcomes
A secondary outcome, PDI, was 89.5 (SD, 16.1) in the rhEPO
group and 92.1 (SD, 17.7) in the placebo group; the difference of
−2.6 (99% CI, −7.7 to 1.7; P = .15) was not statistically signifi-
cant.Furthersecondaryoutcomes,whichwereuncommon,are
listed in Table 2 and were not statistically significantly differ-
ent between groups. Mean body weight, length, and head cir-
cumference at 2 years were similar between groups (Table 2).

Discussion
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-
center trial enrolling very preterm infants treated with either
early high-dose rhEPO or saline placebo after birth, no effect of
rhEPO on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years’corrected
age could be demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this
study evaluated the largest population to date of very preterm
infantstreatedwithhigh-doserhEPOduringthefirstdaysoflife.
It is possible that rhEPO does not have a neuroprotective role.
However, differences with previous studies suggest the re-
sults of this study may be related to the timing and duration of
rhEPOadministration.Twoprevioussmallerrandomizedclini-

randomization, which occurred
before 3 hours of life, exclusion
criteria (n = 5) or nonadherence to
inclusion criteria (attributable to
errors in reporting of gestational
age, n = 2) were discovered for
some infants; thus, they were

In extremely low birth weight infants, high-dose rhEPO
(2500 IU/kg) achieves neuroprotective plasma concentrations
over 12 hours after injection, and in case of repeated adminis-
trations, steady-state conditions are achieved within 24 to 48
hours.33 We decided on a high-dose regimen over a short dura-
tion immediately after birth to rapidly saturate erythropoietin
receptorswhilereducinganyadverseeffectsofhigh-doserhEPO

of rhEPO and higher cognitive scores assessed by the BSID-II in
very preterm infants at a median age of 26 months, suggesting
a possible dose-response relationship between rhEPO and the
outcome measure. The regimen used in this study might be in-
sufficientinachievingneuroprotectionduringthepostnatalpe-
riod, and the standard application of rhEPO for neuroprotec-
tion in very preterm infants still needs to be clarified.
To date, 2 other large trials have been designed to analyze
the neuroprotective role of rhEPO in very preterm infants: one
is completed (NCT02036073), and the other is still ongoing
(NCT01378273). According to their protocols, rhEPO is given in
lower dose and more often (ie, 500 IU/kg every day for 14 days,
beginning at <24 hours of age; and 1000 IU/kg intravenously
every 48 hours for 6 doses, then 400 IU/kg subcutaneously 3
times per week until 32 weeks 6 days postmenstrual age) than
in the present study. The results of these studies should help
in assessment of the different rhEPO strategies.
Inaretrospectivecohortstudyofextremelypreterminfants,
Neubauer et al10 reported improvement in neurodevelopmen-
tal outcome in infants who were exposed to EPO and had neo-
natalbrainlesions.Thiswasnotobservedinthistrial.However,
lowergestationalagegroups,ie,lessthan26weeks,andinfants
withseveremorbidities,suchasmajorbrainlesionsthatcanaffect

whichmighthavepreventedidentificationofaneuroprotective
role of rhEPO in high-risk preterm subpopulations. It is surpris-
ing that we found no treatment effect of rhEPO on the primary
outcome, MDI, in the subgroup of study infants in which an as-
sociation between rhEPO and reduced incidence of white and
graymatterinjuriesattermequivalentwaspreviouslyshown.14,15
However, correlation between quantitative measures using ce-
rebral MRI at term-equivalent age and qualitative measures of
cognitiveoutcomeat2yearsinpreterminfantshasnotbeenes-
tablished,andthesearchforimagingbiomarkerscontinues.The
neurodevelopmental outcome at age 5 years in this cohort will
be important. An ongoing trial (NCT02076373) is examining
whether a selected group of very preterm infants with
intraventricularhemorrhagegrade2ormorecouldbenefitfrom
high-dose rhEPO administered as a rescue therapy.29
The negative results of the trial also raise a question about
the timing of measurement of the primary outcome. As re-
cently pointed out by Marlow, assessment of outcomes at 2
years may not be the most appropriate point to assess the ef-
ficacy of an intervention, and the time point may rather re-
flect proof of safety.34 The predictive validity of long-term neu-
rodevelopmental outcome for individuals assessed at 2 years
is relatively poor if infants with major disabilities are
excluded.35-37 Thus, the present study assessing outcomes at
2 years’corrected age may primarily confirm the previously
reported safety of high-dose rhEPO administration to very pre-
term infants born between 26 and 32 weeks’gestational age.12
Assessment at school age may be a better measure of efficacy,
when children’
s cognitive performance becomes more differ-
entiated than at 2 years, and reevaluation of the cohort at this
age is planned. To date there is not enough evidence to sup-
port the administration of rhEPO for neuroprotection in very
preterm infants.

Thestrengthsofthisstudyincludeitsrandomized,double-
blind, placebo-controlled design and the large sample size.
However, some limitations also need to be mentioned. A first
weakness is the administration of supplemental rhEPO to treat
anemia in about one-tenth of the whole cohort, and the ad-
ministration of a lower dose of rhEPO or placebo than allo-
cated in 7 infants. Notwithstanding this protocol violation,
similar results were observed in both the ITT and the per-
protocol analyses, making the possibility of bias less rel-
evant. A second limitation is the relatively long duration of en-
rollment, mainly caused by an 11-month enrollment stop by
the Swissmedic and the ethics committees because of con-
cernaboutthedeathofaninfantallocatedtotherhEPOgroup.17
A third limitation is that 5 follow-up centers were involved
in outcome data collection, potentially increasing variability in
the quantification of neurodevelopment. To reduce this poten-
tial source of bias, the follow-up examinations were performed
byexperiencedinvestigators,videotaped,anddiscussedatregu-
lar meetings. Fourth, the 19% rate of loss to follow-up is of con-
cern, although 6% represented deceased infants. Fifth, the pla-
cebogrouphadaconsiderablyhigherMDIthanhypothesizedin
the planning phase of the study, which may have reduced the
powerofthestudy.Thismighthaveoccurredbecausenopreterm

Conclusions
Among very preterm infants who received prophylactic early
high-dose rhEPO for neuroprotection, compared with in-
fants who received placebo, there were no statistically signifi-
cant differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years.
Follow-up for cognitive and physical problems that may not
become evident until later in life is required.
