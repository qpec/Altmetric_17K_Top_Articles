Endovascular versus open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm 
in 15-years’ follow-up of the UK endovascular aneurysm repair 
trial 1 (EVAR trial 1): a randomised controlled trial
Rajesh Patel, Michael J Sweeting, Janet T Powell, Roger M Greenhalgh, for the EVAR trial investigators*
Summary
Background Short-term survival benefi
 ts of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) versus open repair of intact 
abdominal aortic aneurysms have been shown in randomised trials, but this early survival benefi
 t is lost after a few 
years. We investigated whether EVAR had a long-term survival benefi
 t compared with open repair.
Methods We used data from the EVAR randomised controlled trial (EVAR trial 1), which enrolled 1252 patients from 
37 centres in the UK between Sept 1, 1999, and Aug 31, 2004. Patients had to be aged 60 years or older, have aneurysms 
of at least 5·5 cm in diameter, and deemed suitable and fi
 t for either EVAR or open repair. Eligible patients were 
randomly assigned (1:1) using computer-generated sequences of randomly permuted blocks stratifi
 ed by centre to 
receive either EVAR (n=626) or open repair (n=626). Patients and treating clinicians were aware of group assignments, 
no masking was used. The primary analysis compared total and aneurysm-related deaths in groups until mid-2015 in 
the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered at ISRCTN (ISRCTN55703451).
Findings We recruited 1252 patients between Sept 1, 1999, and Aug 31, 2004. 25 patients (four for mortality outcome) 
were lost to follow-up by June 30, 2015. Over a mean of 12·7 years (SD 1·5; maximum 15·8 years) of follow-up, we 
recorded 9·3 deaths per 100 person-years in the EVAR group and 8·9 deaths per 100 person-years in the open-repair 
group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·11, 95% CI 0·97–1·27, p=0·14). At 0–6 months after randomisation, patients in 
the EVAR group had a lower mortality (adjusted HR 0·61, 95% CI 0·37–1·02 for total mortality; and 0·47, 0·23–0·93 
for aneurysm-related mortality, p=0·031), but beyond 8 years of follow-up open-repair had a signifi
 cantly lower 
mortality (adjusted HR 1·25, 95% CI 1·00–1·56, p=0·048 for total mortality; and 5·82, 1·64–20·65, p=0·0064 for 
aneurysm-related mortality). The increased aneurysm-related mortality in the EVAR group after 8 years was mainly 
attributable to secondary aneurysm sac rupture (13 deaths [7%] in EVAR vs two [1%] in open repair), with increased 
cancer mortality also observed in the EVAR group.
Interpretation EVAR has an early survival benefi
 t but an inferior late survival compared with open repair, which needs 
to be addressed by lifelong surveillance of EVAR and re-intervention if necessary.

Introduction
Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a common disease that 
particularly aff
 ects men older than 60 years. As the size 
of the aneurysm increases the risk of rupture increases. 
Since 1951, surgical repair has been practised.1 Minimally 
invasive vascular repair was fi
 rst reported in 1986.2 Three 
principal, randomised controlled trials3–5 for abdominal 
aortic aneurysm have shown marked benefi
 ts of 
endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with respect to 
30-day mortality. However, the total mortality benefi
 t was 
lost (catch-up of mortality) in these randomised 
controlled trials after 2 years (in the UK Endovascular 
Aneurysm Repair trial 1 [EVAR trial 1]),6 1–2 years 
(DREAM),7 and 5 years (OVER).8 
Schermerhorn and colleagues9 assessed peri-operative 
and long-term survival, re-interventions, and com-
plications after endovascular repair compared with open 
repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm in cohorts of US 
Medicare benefi
 ciaries (US Government health-care 
insurance programme) matched by propensity score who 
underwent repair during 2001–08 and followed up until 
2009. They found that endovascular repair, compared 
with open repair, was associated with early survival 
advantage that gradually decreased over time, with catch-
up of mortality after 3 years.9 The rate of rupture after 
aneurysm repair was signifi
 cantly higher in those who 
had EVAR than in those who had open repair. An 
observational study10 from a single institution in 
Queensland, Australia, reported no diff
 erences in 5-year, 
10-year, and 15-year survival between open repair (n=982; 
median follow-up 6·5 years) and EVAR (n=358; median 
follow-up 4·0 years), but had incomplete patient 
reporting. 
The EVAR trial 16 previously reported aneurysm-
related mortality and total mortality up to 10 years of 
follow-up, at which point no diff
 erence was reported

between endovascular and open abdominal aneurysm 
repair, but the problem of secondary sac rupture after 
EVAR was emerging.11 The original trial protocol stated 
that if concerns became apparent about the durability of 
EVAR, the trial should be extended to address the issue. 
No previous comprehensive report of follow-up longer 
than 10 years of EVAR or open repair exists. We report 
the long-term follow up results of up to 15 years of the 
EVAR trial 1, in terms of aneurysm-related and total 
mortality, cause of death, and aneurysm-related re-
interventions.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this randomised controlled trial, our participants 
were from the EVAR trial 1.12 The EVAR trial 1 enrolled 
men and women who were aged 60 years or older 
between Sept 1, 1999, and Aug 31, 2004, from 
37 hospitals in the UK. Patients were off
 ered enrolment 
if they had an aortic aneurysm of at least 5·5 cm in 
diameter (assessed with CT), with aortic morphology 
compatible with endograft placement within the 
manufacturers’ instructions for use, and were deemed 
fi
 t for open repair (decided by surgeon, radiologist, 
anaesthetist, and cardiologist) with an acceptable risk 
of postoperative death for both procedures. Our 
exclusion criteria have been previously reported13 and 
included unsuitability for an EVAR device, abdominal 
aortic aneurysm smaller than 5·5 cm in diameter, 
refusal to enter into the trial, or refusal to any CT scan 
or further treatment. The protocol is available online. 
We gained ethical approval for our extended patient 
follow-up after Sept 1, 2009,6 from the UK’s North West 
Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, who did not 
require patients to provide consent again for the 
ongoing follow-up of the EVAR trial 1 of up to 15 years.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE and Embase on June 7, 2016, for all 
articles published from Jan 1, 2006, to May 31, 2016, using 
search terms “15 year follow up of EVAR for intact abdominal 
aortic aneurysm”, “long-term elective repair”, “abdominal aortic 
aneurysm”, “minimally invasive surgery”, “vascular surgical 
procedures”, endovascular surgery”, and “open surgery”. 
Three principal randomised controlled trials for abdominal 
aortic aneurysm have shown marked benefi
 ts of endovascular 
aneurysm repair (EVAR) for 30-day mortality, but total mortality 
benefi
 t was lost in these trials after 2 years (EVAR trial 1), 
1–2 years (DREAM), and 5 years (OVER; catch-up of mortality). 
A comparison of endovascular with open repair of abdominal 
aortic aneurysm in propensity-score matched cohorts of 
Medicare benefi
 ciaries found that endovascular repair was 
associated with early survival advantage that gradually 
decreased over time, with catch-up of mortality after 3 years. 
The rate of rupture after aneurysm repair was signifi
 cantly 
higher in those who had EVAR than open repair. The UK EVAR 
trial 1 previously reported follow-up for aneurysm-related and 
total mortality up to 10 years, at which point no diff
 erence was 
recorded between EVAR and open abdominal aneurysm repair. 
No previous trial has used follow-up of endovascular repair or 
open repair after this time. An observational study done during 
1990–2013, published in 2016, from a single institution in 
Queensland, Australia, reported no diff
 erences in 5-year, 
10-year, and 15-year survival between open repair (n=982; 
median follow-up 6·5 years) and EVAR (n=358; median 
follow-up 4·0 years), but had incomplete patient reporting. 
A previous report from the EVAR trials data defi
 ned a “cluster” 
of complications (eg, type I endoleak, type III endoleak, type II 
endoleak with sac expansion, kinking, and migration), which 
was associated with secondary aortic sac rupture with 67% risk 
of death. The Eurostar database reported that the rate of 
secondary sac rupture after endovascular repair is low for the 
fi
 rst 4 years, but after this time the rate appears to increase, 
particularly in those with known sac expansion.
Added value of this study
Late aneurysm-related and total mortality were both greater in 
patients who were randomly assigned to EVAR than those who 
had open repair. The rate of re-interventions, including those 
free from re-intervention after 2 years or 5 years, was higher in 
the EVAR group at all timepoints. Despite the operative benefi
 t 
for the EVAR group with lower aneurysm and total mortality 
after 6 months, this benefi
 t was lost partly due to secondary 
rupture and aneurysm-related causes of death. The main cause 
of aneurysm-related mortality in the EVAR group was 
secondary aortic sac rupture which together with a larger 
contribution from cancer-related deaths led to higher total 
mortality in late follow-up. We followed up patients for 
15 years; no previous comprehensive report of comparative 
follow-up longer than 10 years of EVAR versus open repair 
seemed to have been reported.
Implications of all the evidence available
The loss of early EVAR survival benefi
 t, followed by inferior late 
survival benefi
 t and durability compared with open repair, 
needs to be addressed by lifelong surveillance of EVAR and 
prompt re-intervention if necessary. There is no time when it is 
safe to discontinue surveillance in patients who have had EVAR. 
Sac expansion needs to be tracked for all time periods and the 
underlying cause corrected. Novel ways to sense sac expansion 
would be useful to prompt early awareness of risk of secondary 
aortic sac rupture. Eff
 orts should be made to understand the 
underlying aortic dilating disease process and to attempt to 
limit it. Device design might take into account the expected 
ongoing dilating process of the aorta. A possible increase in 
cancer deaths in the EVAR group in very late (>8 years) 
follow-up merits further consideration.

Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to undergo 
either open repair or endovascular repair by computer-
generated sequences of randomly permuted blocks 
stratifi
 ed by centre, at the trial hub (Charing Cross 
Hospital, London, UK). Patients and treating clinicians 
were aware of group assignment. 
Procedures
The procedures we used have been previously described.13 
Participating trial centres were reminded that all patients 
should continue in regular follow-up (the protocol 
specifi
 ed annual follow-up) and all patients, including 
those with lapsed follow-up, should be recalled for a fi
 nal 
clinical and imaging follow-up in 2014. The maximum 
aortic or sac diameter and presence of complications 
were recorded at each patient follow-up. Patients were 
followed up once a year for clinical and imaging 
assessment and serum creatinine concentrations. The 
management of aneurysm-related complications was left 
to the discretion of the trial centre. For our extended 
follow-up of patients, the grading of aneurysm-related re-
interventions and the associated use of high-dependency 
or intensive care were obtained by questionnaire to the 
principal investigators at the trial centres (appendix). The 
Trial Endpoint Committee adjudicated the cause of 
death, aneurysm-related mortality, and other events 
based on International Classifi
 cation of Diseases 
(version 10) causes listed and dates of aneurysm-related 
re-interventions. The committee were unaware of study 
group assignment.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was aneurysm-related mortality 
and total mortality. Aneurysm-related mortality was 
defi
 ned as all deaths from aneurysm rupture before 
repair, within 30 days of the primary procedure, within 
30 days of any re-intervention attributable to the 
aneurysm, from other aneurysm-related causes (in-
cluding graft infection or fi
 stula), or from secondary 
aneurysm rupture after repair. Our secondary outcomes 
included re-intervention (time to fi
 rst re-intervention, 
fi
 rst re-intervention for a life-threatening problem, and 
fi
 rst serious re-intervention); complications, sac growth 
and risk of late complications, and costs and cost-
eff
 ectiveness will be reported separately.
For the primary mortality outcome, patients were 
followed up from Sept 1, 1999, to June 30, 2015 
(using record linkage from the Offi
  ce of National 
Statistics, with death classifi
 cation based on death 
certifi
 cates and clinical information provided to the 
endpoint committee6). Patients were followed-up for 
graft-related complications and re-interventions from 
Sept 1, 1999, to March 31, 2015. For graft-related re-
interventions between Sept 1, 2009, and March 31, 2015, 
follow-up was predominantly using record linkage to 
administrative data for hospital readmissions and 
re-interventions 
via 
Hospital 
Episode 
Statistics. 
Re-interventions, including incisional hernia repair 
throughout the trial, and other operative procedures 
preceding death were subsequently checked with the trial 
centres, with 89% concordance between administrative 
and 
clinical 
site 
data 
(appendix). 
Graft-related 
complications and re-interventions were also directly 
obtained from the trial centres with a new case record 
form for our follow-up between Sept 1, 2009, 
and March 31, 2015 (appendix). The primary analysis 
compared rates of total mortality and aneurysm-related 
mortality until June 30, 2015. 
Statistical analysis
As of Sept 1, 2009, 711 patients with an mean age of 80 years 
were reported alive and under follow-up in the EVAR trial 1 
(357 in the EVAR group and 354 in the open repair group). 
This number gave us 80% power at the 5% signifi
 cance 
level to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1·25 during the 
extended period from Sept 1, 2009, to June 30, 2015, 
assuming 10% of patients to be still alive at the end of 
June 30, 2015. We completed all analyses according to a 
pre-defi
 ned statistical analysis plan and were based on the 
intention-to-treat principle, with outcomes assessed from 
the time of randomisation. We used Cox regression 
modelling to compare total mortality, aneurysm-related 
mortality, and time to fi
 rst graft-related re-intervention. 
Hazard ratios (HR) were presented as the EVAR group 
relative to the open-repair group. Due to non-proportional 
hazards during the fi
 rst 8 years of follow-up,6 we analysed 
data by splitting follow-up into four groups of time: from 
randomisation to 6 months, 6 months to 4 years, 4 years to 
8 years, and after 8 years’ follow-up. We assessed deviations 
from the proportional hazards assumption as overall and 
within these periods by regressing-scaled Schoenfeld 
residuals against log of time. Regression estimates are 
presented both unadjusted and adjusted for baseline 
covariates. We used Kaplan-Meier estimates to show 
survival probabilities up to 15-years’ follow-up in each 
group.
Additionally, we did a per-protocol analysis on data 
from patients who had undergone their randomly 
assigned treatment and did two sensitivity analyses to 
allow inclusion of patients with missing covariates in the 
adjusted models (appendix).
We completed time to fi
 rst re-intervention analyses 
separately for any graft-related re-intervention, any 
serious re-intervention and any life-threatening condition 
(appendix). The criteria used to censor individuals are 
provided in the appendix. We also did further analyses 
for patients without any re-intervention between 
randomisation and at 2 years of follow-up and without 
any re-intervention between randomisation and 5 years 
of follow-up. We did all analyses with Stata (version 13). 
The oversight committee, data monitoring and ethical 
committee, approved the statistical analysis plan. The 
trial is registered at ISCRTN (ISRCTN55703451).

Results 
From Sept 1, 1999, to Aug 31, 2004, we recruited 
1252 patients to participate in this trial, who were equally 
randomly assigned to the two treatment groups 
(626 patients per group; fi
 gure 1; appendix). No substantial 
diff
 erences were noted in baseline characteristics between 
the groups. Overall mean age of patients was 74 years, 
and 1135 (91%) were men (appendix).12
Patients were followed up until June 30, 2015 (mean 
12·7 years; median 12·4 years; range 1·8–15·8 years); 
mean person-years observation to either death or end of 
the study was 8·0 years. By June 30, 2015, only 
four patients were lost to follow-up for mortality and 
25 for re-interventions (fi
 ve in the EVAR group and 20 in 
the open-repair group), but data were available from 
record linkage for 13 [76%] of 17 patients previously lost to 
mortality follow-up (fi
 gure 1). For these 13 individuals 
found from record linkage, a cause of death was 
established on the basis of only a death certifi
 cate. Annual 
clinical follow-up with either CT or duplex imaging 
reduced steadily over the trial and was consistently lower 
in the open-repair group than in the EVAR group 
(appendix). Over the course of follow-up a median of 
six CT scans (IQR 3–8) were done per patient in the EVAR

group and three (1–6) per patient in the open-repair 
group. Of the patients who had not had death reported by 
Sept 1, 2009, 655 (90%) of 728 patients were tracked with 
Hospital Episode Statistics, including 13 patients 
previously lost to follow-up, with local hospital follow-up 
reported in 48 (70%) of the 69 remaining patients (21 [3%] 
patients had no further hospital admissions or follow-up; 
fi
 gure 1). After publication of the 30-day mortality results 
from the EVAR trial 1,3 26 of the 37 trial centres remained 
in equipoise and continued recruitment into a separate 
study from Sept 1, 2004, to June 15, 2005, when primary 
outcome results were published,12 with a further 
175 patients (appendix) not previously reported but used 
in our sensitivity analyses for only mortality.
During 9968 person-years of follow-up 910 deaths 
occurred, 101 (11%) of which were aneurysm related 
(table 1). Overall aneurysm-related mortality was 
1·1 deaths per 100 person-years in the EVAR group and 
0·9 deaths per 100 person-years in the open-repair group 
(adjusted HR 1·31, 95% CI 0·86–1·99, p=0·21). For total 
mortality, we recorded 9·3 deaths per 100 person-years in 
the EVAR group and 8·9 deaths per 100 person-years in 
the open-repair group (adjusted HR 1·11, 95% CI 
0·97–1·27, p=0·14). Our results for sensitivity analyses 
that included patients with missing baseline covariates 
were similar for aneurysm-related and total mortality 
(appendix).
We noted evidence of deviation from proportional 
hazards assumption for aneurysm-related mortality 
(p<0·0001), with a signifi
 cant early benefi
 t of EVAR 
during the fi
 rst 6 months after randomisation, 
counteracted by an increase in aneurysm-related mortality 
after 4 years, the diff
 erence being most signifi
 cant after 
8 years (table 1). Additionally, we reported deviation from 
the proportional-hazards assumption for total mortality 
(p=0·0232), with a signifi
 cant early benefi
 t of EVAR 
during the fi
 rst 6 months after randomisation, similar 
mortality between the groups from 6 months to 8 years, 
but after 8 years a signifi
 cant increase in patient mortality 
in the EVAR group (table 1). Kaplan-Meier curves for 
patient survival for aneurysm-related and any cause are 
shown in fi
 gure 2. Aneurysm-related mortality curves 
cross-over between 6 years and 8 years and total mortality 
curves diverge after 10 years. Survival was not signifi
 cantly 
improved in EVAR compared with open repair (median 
8·7 years in EVAR group vs median 8·3 years in open-
repair group; log-rank p=0·49). Sensitivity analyses 
including the additional 175 patients from the separate 
2004–05 study yielded very similar results (appendix).
The full causes of death, by time since randomisation, are 
in table 2. Overall, rupture after aneurysm repair resulted 
in 31 deaths in the EVAR group and fi
 ve in the open-repair

group. Two patients in the open-repair group had ruptures 
in 2010 and 2012, having refused the operation. Overall 
there was no diff
 erence in cancer-related mortality between 
the groups (adjusted HR 1·09, 95% CI 0·84–1·40, p=0·53), 
although an increase was recorded in the EVAR group after 
8 years (adjusted HR 1·87, 95% CI 1·19–2·96, p=0·0072; 
appendix).
No signifi
 cant interactions were noted between patients 
randomly assigned treatment group and age, sex, or 
aneurysm diameter for either aneurysm-related or total 
mortality (p>0·10 for all comparisons; appendix).
Per-protocol analysis was of 598 patients in the EVAR 
group and of 567 patients in the open-repair group, and 
again strongly showed the benefi
 t of EVAR during the 
fi
 rst 6 months, counteracted by an increase in aneurysm-
related mortality at all subsequent time periods 
(appendix), the increase being proportionately greater 
than for the analysis by randomised group. Overall 
aneurysm-related mortality was signifi
 cantly higher in 
the EVAR group (1·0 per 100 person-years) than in the 
open repair group (0·6 per 100 person-years; adjusted 
HR 1·76, 95% CI 1·07–2·89, p=0·026). Total mortality 
was not signifi
 cantly higher in the EVAR group at 9·1 per 
100 person-years than in the open-repair group at 8·4 per 
100 person-years (adjusted HR 1·14, 95% CI 0·99–1·31, 
p=0·07).
During 9715 person-years of follow-up, 258 graft-related 
re-interventions were undertaken in 165 patients in 
the EVAR group and 105 were done in 74 patients in 
the open-repair group, with higher rates to fi
 rst 
re-intervention in the EVAR group (table 3). The 
re-intervention rate was signifi
 cantly higher in the EVAR 
group for any re-intervention and serious re-interventions 
in the fi
 rst 4 years and for life-threatening re-interventions 
(including conversion to open repair, repeat EVAR and 
treatment of graft infection) in the follow-up of 6 months 
to 4 years and after 8 years (table 3, fi

re-intervention, new life-threatening re-interventions 
occurred at any time up to 15-years of follow-up (fi
 gure 3). 
The relative diff
 erence in re-intervention rate between 
the groups was highest from 6 months to 4 years after 
randomisation, particularly for the most serious 
re-interventions (table 3). A similar pattern, by timepoint, 
was observed for second and subsequent re-interventions 
(appendix).
Discussion
Our long-term results showed aneurysm-related and 
total mortality are greater in late follow-up for patients 
who had EVAR than those who had open repair, but over 
the whole follow-up the mean total and aneurysm-related 
mortality were not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent between groups. 
The signifi
 cant late divergence of the survival curves in 
favour of open repair (fi
 gure 2) can be partly explained 
through greater increase in late mortality from aneurysm-
related deaths in the EVAR group.
Total and aneurysm-related mortality were lower in 
patients who received EVAR in the fi
 rst 6 months. 
However, after this time deaths in the EVAR group 
increased, and after 8 years of follow-up both total and 
aneurysm-related mortality were signifi
 cantly higher in 
the EVAR group than in the open repair group. After the 
fi
 rst 6 months, the increased aneurysm-related deaths in 
the EVAR group were predominantly from secondary sac 
rupture. Over the whole follow-up, two aneurysm-related 
deaths followed re-intervention, but the 31 deaths from 
secondary sac rupture were partly due to not having 
underlying causes of sac expansion from endoleak 
corrected.11 Of patients allocated to open repair, 
fi
 ve secondary ruptures occurred, of which four were 
originally assigned to open repair but received EVAR, 
and the last secondary rupture occurred more than 
8 years after the open-repair procedure. Secondary sac 
rupture is much more common after EVAR, occurring at 
any period after the procedure, whereas sac rupture after 
open repair is rare and tends to occur in late follow-up. 
Re-interventions occurred in both groups throughout 
our study follow-up, including in patients who were free 
from re-intervention after 2 years or even 5 years. 
The rate of re-intervention was higher in the EVAR 
group at all follow-up timepoints. These late re-
interventions included those with a high severity score, 
indicating that it was not safe to stop follow-up for 
patients with EVAR. However, in this trial some patients 
were discharged from surveillance and therefore lost the 
option of planned re-intervention. With a mean age of 
74 years at randomisation, there could have been some 
pressing clinical reasons not to re-intervene for some 
patients after long-term follow-up because of old age and 
frailty. A criticism of earlier reports from this trial that 
not all incision-related re-interventions, after open 
repair, were reported was addressed in this long-term 
follow-up.

Limitations of this trial include that devices we used 
were implanted between 1999 and 2004 and newer 
devices since then might be expected to have better 
results.14 Additionally, imaging to establish size and 
placement of endografts has improved since 2004. The 
original trial protocol was for annual follow-up by CT 
scan, which was used in the early stages of the trial. 
However, in the later stages, many of the patients in the 
EVAR group were followed up with ultrasonography. 
This change from CT to ultrasonography was aff
 ected by 
increasing concern about radiation exposure.15 Moreover, 
imaging follow-up declined over time, particularly for the 
patients in the open-repair group. Consequently, 
re-interventions became less likely once surveillance 
ceased. We cannot assume that follow-up practice is the 
same in the rest of the world as it is in the UK where 
many patients were discharged from surveillance after 
several years. Since the patients in the EVAR group had 
more diligent follow-up than those in the open-repair 
group, aneurysm-related mortality might have been 
underestimated in the open-repair group, although this 
factor does not aff
 ect our fi
 ndings for total mortality. 
A further limitation is that because of decreasing clinical 
follow-up at the original trial hospitals the methodology 
to identify re-interventions changed after 2009 to 
predominantly use record linkage through the Hospital 
Episode Statistics administrative dataset, with these 
re-interventions subsequently being validated at the trial 
hospitals. However, these data also captured information 
for patients whose care had moved to non-trial hospitals 
and recovered some patients who had been previously 
lost to follow-up.
Patients seem to prefer EVAR16 to open repair, and 
currently it is the method of choice for repair of abdominal 
aortic aneurysm. EVAR devices are constantly being 
improved and sizing and imaging methods available for

deployment are better now than they were between 1999 
and 2004: a corollary is that experience in open repair is 
declining. However, aortas with aneurysmal disease 
continue to dilate and over time a good device could leak 
or migrate and even an open repair can rupture. 
Challenges in the future to maintain the initially better 
results of being in the EVAR group include the need to 
halt the dilating disease process as well as devices that 
allow for this inevitable dilating process over the years. 
The long-term results of this study can act as a benchmark 
against which new endovascular technologies for 
aneurysm repair can be compared with at each timepoint. 
In the meantime, surveillance must be addressed in 
clinical guidelines: to be diligent, regular, easy, and avoid 
CT scan if possible, and perhaps concentrate on the sac 
diameter after EVAR either by ultrasonography or novel 
implantable sensor devices.17–21
