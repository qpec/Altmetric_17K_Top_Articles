BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer often experience frequent and prolonged hospitalizations; however, the factors associ-
ated with greater health care utilization have not been described. We sought to investigate the relation between patients’ physical
and psychological symptom burden and health care utilization. METHODS: We enrolled patients with advanced cancer and unplanned
hospitalizations from September 2014-May 2016. Upon admission, we assessed physical (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System
[ESAS]) and psychological symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 4 [PHQ-4]). We examined the relationship between symptom
burden and healthcare utilization using linear regression for hospital length of stay (LOS) and Cox regression for time to first
unplanned readmission within 90 days. We adjusted all models for age, sex, marital status, comorbidity, education, time since
advanced cancer diagnosis, and cancer type. RESULTS: We enrolled 1,036 of 1,152 (89.9%) consecutive patients approached. Over
one-half reported moderate/severe fatigue, poor well being, drowsiness, pain, and lack of appetite. PHQ-4 scores indicated that
28.8% and 28.0% of patients had depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. The mean hospital LOS was 6.3 days, and the 90-
day readmission rate was 43.1%. Physical symptoms (ESAS: unstandardized coefficient [B], 0.06; P < .001), psychological distress
(PHQ-4 total: B, 0.11; P 5 .040), and depression symptoms (PHQ-4 depression: B, 0.22; P 5 .017) were associated with longer hospital
LOS. Physical (ESAS: hazard ratio, 1.01; P < .001), and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-4 anxiety: hazard ratio, 1.06; P 5 .045) were associated
with a higher likelihood for readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with advanced cancer experience a high symptom bur-
den, which is significantly associated with prolonged hospitalizations and readmissions. Interventions are needed to address the
symptom burden of this population to improve health care delivery and utilization. Cancer 2017;123:4720-7. V

INTRODUCTION
Patients with advanced cancer use substantial health care resources, and recent trends suggest that rates of health care utili-
zation are increasing.1,2 Hospitalizations account for a significant proportion of this health care use. Over one-half of
patients with cancer are admitted to the hospital at least once during their last month of life, and nearly 10% experience a
hospital readmission during this time.1,3-6 Importantly, patients with advanced cancer often prefer to avoid hospitaliza-
tions, especially near the end of life, yet many still die in the hospital.3,7-9 Thus, there is a critical need to explore factors
that may contribute to the rising healthcare utilization in patients with advanced cancer.
Hospital admissions are not only inconsistent with patients’ preferences, but incur significant costs.10 Rising health
care costs represent a major challenge in the United States, affecting both patients and providers.11,12 Medical care for
patients in their last year of life accounts for >25% of Medicare spending, and over one-half of these costs occur in the last
60 days of elife.13,14 Notably, hospitalizations represent the largest component of health care spending for patients with
cancer.15,16 Both long hospital stays17 and readmissions cost the health care system billions of dollars each year.18 Conse-
quently, programs like the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program and value-based purchasing models, including

 accountable care organizations, have placed a considerable
emphasis on decreasing the use of health care services, par-
ticularly hospital length of stay and readmissions.19-22
Patients with cancer often require hospitalizations
for physical symptoms, such as pain,23-26 fever,23,24 dys-
pnea,24,25 and fatigue.26 However, much of the existing
literature on symptom prevalence and severity in patients
with cancer has focused primarily on those in the ambula-
tory care setting, with very little attention to either the
physical or psychological symptom burden of hospitalized
patients.27-31 It is important to note that the relation
between patients’ physical and psychological symptoms
and their hospital length of stay and risk of readmissions is
currently unknown. Developing a more comprehensive
understanding of the symptom burden of hospitalized
patients with advanced cancer and their relation to
patients’ health care use is an essential first step to enhanc-
ing the quality of life and care for this population. By
identifying potentially modifiable factors, hospital lengths
of stay and readmissions in oncology may be reduced.
In the current study, we prospectively collected
patients’ self-reported symptom burden to comprehen-
sively describe the physical and psychological symptoms
of hospitalized patients with advanced cancer and to
explore the relation between their symptoms and health
care utilization. We hypothesized that patients with
higher physical and psychological symptoms would have
longer hospital lengths of stay and greater risk for
unplanned readmissions compared with those who
reported lower symptom burden.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Procedures
This study was approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard
Cancer Center Institutional Review Board. From Septem-
ber 2, 2014, to May 6, 2016, we enrolled 1036 patients
with advanced cancer who had an unplanned hospital
admission at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in
a longitudinal cohort study. We identified and recruited
consecutive patients who had an unplanned hospital
admission (index hospitalization) during the study period
by screening the daily inpatient oncology census. Each
participant contributed 1 unique hospitalization. A
research assistant obtained written, informed consent
from eligible patients on the first weekday following
admission (within 2-5 days of hospitalization). After con-
sent was obtained, participants completed a symptom
burden questionnaire.
Participants
Patients were eligible for study participation if they were
aged �18 years and admitted to MGH with a known
diagnosis of advanced cancer. We defined patients with
advanced cancer as those not being treated with curative
intent. We identified patients not being treated with cura-
tive intent based on the chemotherapy order entry treat-
ment intent designation (palliative vs. curative), or based
on documentation in the oncology clinic notes for those
not receiving chemotherapy. Study participants also had
to be able to read and respond to study questionnaires in
English or with minimal assistance from an interpreter.
We excluded patients with elective or planned hospital
admissions, defined as hospitalizations for chemotherapy
administration, scheduled surgical procedures, or chemo-
therapy desensitization. We also excluded patients with
leukemia and those who were admitted for stem cell
transplantation.
Study Measures
Sociodemographic and clinical factors
Each patient registering for care at MGH is required to
provide demographic information, which is documented
in the demographics section of the electronic health
record (EHR). We reviewed the demographics section of
the EHR to obtain participants’ date of birth, sex, race,
relationship status, education, and religion. We also
reviewed patients’ oncology clinic notes in the EHR to
determine the Charlson Comorbidity Index, date of diag-
nosis with advanced cancer, and cancer type.
Patient-reported symptom burden
We used a modified version of the self-administered,
revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS-
r) to assess patients’ symptoms.32 The ESAS-r assesses
pain, fatigue, drowsiness, nausea, appetite, dyspnea,
depression, anxiety, and well being over the previous 24
hours. We also included constipation, as this is a highly
prevalent symptom in patients with advanced cancer.33
Individual symptoms are scored on a scale from 0 (reflect-
ing absence of the symptom) to 10 (reflecting the worst
possible severity). Consistent with prior research, we
scored the severity of ESAS scores as 0 (none), 1 to 3
(mild), 4 to 6 (moderate), and 7 to 10 (severe).34 We com-
puted the composite ESAS physical and total symptom
variables that included scores of patients’ physical symp-
toms (pain, fatigue, drowsiness, nausea, appetite, dyspnea,
constipation) and total symptoms (pain, fatigue, drowsi-
ness, nausea, appetite, dyspnea, depression, anxiety, well
being, constipation). The ESAS physical and total

 symptom scores are well validated and have been used pre-
viously in the oncology setting, with minimal clinically
important differences of 3 points for each of these com-
posite scores.32,35
To assess patients’ psychological symptoms, we used
the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4),36,37 which
is a 4-item tool that contains two 2-item subscales assess-
ing depression and anxiety symptoms. Both subscales and
the composite PHQ-4 score can also be evaluated contin-
uously, with higher scores indicating worse psychological
distress.36 Scores on each subscale range from 0 to 6, with
scores �3 denoting clinically significant depression or
anxiety.36 We added the PHQ-4 to the study question-
naires on November 15, 2014, to have a validated mea-
sure specifically for psychological distress rather than the
single depression and anxiety items of the ESAS-r.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome of the study was hospital length of
stay, which we defined as the number of days from hospi-
tal admission to hospital discharge. The secondary out-
come focused on unplanned hospital readmissions.
To account for mortality, as patients who die after their
index hospitalization have less time at risk for readmis-
sion, we used the time to first unplanned admission
within 90 days of hospital discharge as the outcome
measure, defined as the number of days from hospital dis-
charge to the first unplanned readmission within 90 days.
We censored patients without a readmission at their
90-day postdischarge date and those who died within 90
days at their death date. In addition, we created a compos-
ite dichotomous outcome categorizing patients as dead
and/or readmitted within 90 days (yes vs no) versus those
who were alive and had no readmissions within 90 days to
account further for early mortality.
Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to evaluate the frequencies,
means, and standard deviations (SDs) for participants’
characteristics and symptom burden. To investigate the
relationship between physical and psychological symp-
toms and hospital length of stay, we computed linear
regression models adjusted for age, sex, marital status,
education level, comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity
Index), time since advanced cancer diagnosis, and cancer
type. Given collinearity between physical and psychologi-
cal symptoms, we created separate models for each of the
following: PHQ-4 total score (total psychological dis-
tress), PHQ-4 depression subscale, PHQ-4 anxiety sub-
scale, ESAS physical score, ESAS total score, ESAS
depression score, and ESAS anxiety score. We used Cox
proportional-hazards regression models adjusted for the
same variables described above to assess the relation
between physical and psychological symptoms and the
time to readmission within 90 days. Finally, we used logis-
tic regression models adjusted for the same variables
described above to assess the relationship between physical
and psychological symptoms and the odds of death or
readmission within 90 days.
With a sample size of 1000 patients, the study has
>95% power to detect a 0.2 difference in hospital length
of stay in days for a 1-point increase in symptom burden,
as measured by the ESAS, and a 1-point increase in psy-
chological distress, as measured by the PHQ-4, with a 2-
sided a of .05. Less than 1% of patients had missing data
for each individual symptom, precluding the need for
missing data imputations. All reported P values are 2-
sided, and P < .05 is considered statistically significant.
We used the Stata version 9.3 software package (Stata
Corporation, College Station, Texas) for all statistical
analyses.

In total, we screened 2353 patients for eligibility (Fig. 1).
We approached 1152 eligible patients and enrolled 1036
(89.9%) participants. Participants (mean 6 SD age,

mean time since diagnosis of advanced cancer of 510.01
6 SD5722.66 days. Participants had a mean hospital
length of stay of 6.26 6 SD54.82 days. The 90-day read-
mission rate was 43.1%, and the 90-day mortality rate
was 41.6%. Nearly two-thirds of participants (65.0%)
died or were readmitted within 90 days.
Patient-Reported Symptom Burden
Figure 2 depicts the severity of symptom burden in hospi-
talized patients with advanced cancer. Over one-half of
patients reported moderate/severe fatigue (86.7%), poor
well being (74.2%), drowsiness (71.7%), pain (67.7%),
and lack of appetite (67.3%). Of the 10 ESAS symptoms
we evaluated, patients reported experiencing a mean 6
SD of 5.76 6 2.38 moderate/severe symptoms. In our
sample, only 17 patients (1.7%) reported experiencing no
moderate/severe symptoms. More than one-quarter of
participants had clinically significant symptoms of depres-
sion (28.8%) and anxiety (28.0%) based on their PHQ-4
scores.
The Relationship Between Symptom Burden
and Hospital Length of Stay
Table 2 depicts the relation between patients’ physical
and psychological symptoms and their hospital length of
stay after controlling for age, sex, marital status, education
level, comorbidities, time since advanced cancer diagno-
sis, and cancer type. Patients’ physical symptoms (ESAS
physical: unstandardized coefficient [B], 0.06; 95% CI,
0.04-0.09; standard error [SE], 0.01; P < .001) and total
symptom burden (ESAS total: B, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.03-
0.06; SE, 0.01; P < .001) were both significantly associ-
ated with longer hospital length of stay. In addition,
patients’ total psychological distress (PHQ-4 total: B,
0.11; 95% CI, 0.005-0.21; SE, 0.05; P 5 .040), PHQ-4
depression scores (B, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.04-0.40; SE, 0.09;
P 5 .017), and ESAS depression scores (B, 0.10; 95% CI,
0.01-0.19; SE, 0.05; P 5 .034) were also associated with
longer hospital length of stay. However, patient-reported
anxiety symptoms were not related to length of hospitali-
zation (PHQ-4 anxiety: B, 0.12; 95% CI, 20.06 - 0.30;
SE, 0.09; P 5 .190; ESAS anxiety: B, 0.09; 95% CI,
20.004 - 0.18; SE, 0.05; P 5 .061).

.012) were all significantly associated with a higher likeli-
hood of death or readmission within 90 days (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we demonstrated that hospitalized
patients with advanced cancer experience an immense
physical and psychological symptom burden, with >50%
reporting moderate-to-severe physical symptoms, such as
fatigue, pain, drowsiness, and poor appetite. Notably,
>25% of patients also reported clinically significant
depression and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, hospitalized
patients’ physical and psychological symptoms were sig-
nificantly associated with longer hospital length of stay
and greater risk for unplanned hospital readmissions
within 90 days. Collectively, these findings underscore
the prevalence and severity of symptoms experienced by
hospitalized patients with cancer and illustrate the pat-
terns of health care utilization within this highly symp-
tomatic population.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demon-
strate the relation between patients’ self-reported physical
symptoms and health care utilization among hospitalized
patients with advanced cancer. Patients’ physical symp-
tom burden was significantly associated with both their
hospital length of stay and their risk of unplanned hospital
readmission within 90 days. As previous studies have
demonstrated that patients’ symptoms may result in hos-
pital admissions,23,24 our investigation provides novel
insights to help clinicians and policymakers critically
assess the potential contribution of uncontrolled symp-
toms to excessive and costly cancer care. Interventions
such as symptom monitoring and the integration of

 patient-reported outcomes into routine processes of care
are promising strategies to reduce symptom burden and
enhance patient-reported outcomes.38,39 Future research
should also focus on testing the potential efficacy of such
interventions on reducing patients’ use of health care
services.
Interestingly, we also observed that patients’ psycho-
logical symptoms were significantly associated with their
hospital length of stay and their risk of unplanned read-
missions. Although studies of patients with cardiovascular
and pulmonary disease have reported an association
between psychological distress and increased use of health
care services,40-43 no prior investigations have explored
this
relationship
among
hospitalized
patients
with
advanced cancer. Given the proportion of patients with
depression and anxiety symptoms in the current sample,
these findings are noteworthy. Possible explanations for
the relation between psychological distress and increased
health care use include the tendency for individuals with
psychological distress to present with multiple physical
complaints.44-46 In addition, depression and anxiety
symptoms may influence patients’ health behaviors,
including treatment nonadherence, which, in turn, can
increase the risk for hospitalizations.47 Notably, we
observed differences in the relation between anxiety and
readmissions depending on use of the ESAS or PHQ-4
assessments of anxiety. ESAS anxiety is a single-item mea-
sure and may lack sensitivity for significant anxiety symp-
toms compared with the PHQ-4, which is a well
validated, multi-item tool for detecting anxiety and
depression. Future studies are needed to fully explore the
potential mechanisms of the associations we observed
between patients’ psychological symptoms and their use
of health care services. However, our findings suggest that
hospitalized patients with advanced cancer who experi-
ence clinically significant psychological distress represent
a highly vulnerable population at risk for prolonged hos-
pitalizations and unplanned readmissions. Consequently,
strategies to screen hospitalized patients for psychological
distress and provide them with adequate psychological
resources should be tested in the future to improve the
quality of their care.
Our work represents the largest study to date
highlighting the immense symptom burden of hospital-
ized patients with advanced cancer. It is important to note
that patients’ symptoms represent a potentially modifiable
risk factor that, if properly addressed, may improve health
care quality and delivery. Indeed, studies have demon-
strated that targeted interventions aimed at improving
symptom management can enhance patient-reported
outcomes.38,48,49 However, most of these efforts are tar-
geting the symptom burden of patients with cancer in the
ambulatory care setting.38,48,49 Hospitalized patients with
advanced cancer often experience a higher symptom bur-
den than those in the outpatient setting30,31; thus, there is
a critical need to determine the efficacy of supportive care
interventions in this population to reduce symptom bur-
den and prevent excess use of health care services.
Several limitations of this study warrant discussion.
First, we performed the study at a single, tertiary care site
in a patient sample with limited socioeconomic diversity,
which may limit the generalizability of findings to other,
more diverse populations or to patients in other geo-
graphic areas. Second, it is possible that differences in ill-
ness severity and other factors could confound the relation
between symptom burden and health care utilization.
Nonetheless, patients’ symptom burden remained a sig-
nificant predictor of health care use after adjusting for
potential confounders, including comorbidity, cancer
type, and time since the diagnosis of advanced cancer.
Third, although we report the association between symp-
tom burden and higher health care utilization, we are
unable to determine the mechanism of this association or
comment on causality. Finally, we examined the relation-
ship between patients’ symptoms collected within 5 days
of their admission, but we lack information regarding
changes in symptom severity during hospitalization.
Future research should include daily symptom assess-
ments to understand better how patients’ symptom trajec-
tories relate to their use of health care services.
In summary, hospitalized patients with advanced
cancer experience high rates of uncontrolled physical and
psychological symptoms that are significantly associated
with prolonged hospitalizations and a higher risk for
unplanned hospital readmissions. Most, if not all, of
the symptoms identified are treatable with intensive
supportive care measures, which can be feasibly imple-
mented, especially during hospital admissions. These
findings highlight the critical need to monitor and address
the physical and psychological symptom burden of hospi-
talized patients with advanced cancer. Interventions to
identify and treat symptomatic patients hold great poten-
tial for improving patients’ experience with their illness,
enhancing their quality of life, and reducing their health
care utilization.
