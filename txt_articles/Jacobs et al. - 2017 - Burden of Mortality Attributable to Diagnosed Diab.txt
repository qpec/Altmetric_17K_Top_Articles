Analysis Based on Claims Data
From 65 Million People in
Germany
Diabetes Care 2017;40:1703–1709 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc17-0954
OBJECTIVE
In Germany, as in many other countries, nationwidedata on mortality attributable to
diagnosed diabetes are not available. This study estimated the absolute number of
excess deaths associated with diabetes (all types) and type 2 diabetes in Germany.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A prevalence approach that included nationwide routine data from 64.9 million
people insured in the German statutory health insurance system in 2010 was used
for the calculation. Because nationwide data on diabetes mortality are lacking in
Germany, the mortality rate ratio from the Danish National Diabetes Register was
used. The absolute number of excess deaths associated with diabetes was calculated
as the number of deaths due to diabetes minus the number of deaths due to diabetes
with a mortality that was as high as in the population without diabetes. Furthermore,
the mortality population-attributable fraction was calculated.
RESULTS
A total of 174,627 excess deaths were due to diabetes in 2010, including 137,950 due
to type 2 diabetes. Overall, 21% of all deaths in Germany were attributable to di-
abetes and 16% were attributable to type 2 diabetes. Most of the excess deaths (34%
each) occurred in the 70- to 89-year-old age-group.
CONCLUSIONS
In this first nationwide calculation of excess deaths related to diabetes in Germany,
the results suggest that the official German estimates that rely on information from
death certificates are grossly underestimated. Countries without national cohorts or
diabetes registries could easily use this method to estimate the number of excess
deaths due to diabetes.
For the year 2013, the Diabetes Atlas Group estimated that 5.1 million deaths world-
wide and 619,847 deaths in Europe were attributable to diabetes (1). Diabetes is
among the 10 most common causes of death worldwide (2). Between 1990 and
2010, the number of deaths attributable to diabetes has doubled (2). People with
diabetes have a reduced life expectancy of ;5 to 6 years (3). The most common cause
of death in people with diabetes is cardiovascular disease (3,4). Over the past few
decades, a reduction of diabetes mortality has been observed in several countries

 (5–9). However, the excess risk of death is
still higher than in the population without
diabetes, particularly in younger age-
groups (4,9,10). Unfortunately, in most
countries worldwide, reliable data on di-
abetes mortality are lacking (1). In a few
European countries, such as Denmark (5)
and Sweden (4), mortality analyses are
based on national diabetes registries
that include all age-groups. However,
Germany and many other European
countries do not have such national reg-
istries. Until now, age-standardized
hazard ratios for diabetes mortality be-
tween 1.4 and 2.6 have been published
for Germany on the basis of regional
studies and surveys with small respon-
dent numbers (11–14). To the best of
our knowledge, no nationwide estimates
of the number of excess deaths due to
diabetes have been published for Ger-
many, and no information on older age-
groups .79 years is currently available.
In 2012, changes in the regulation of
data transparency enabled the use of na-
tionwide routine health care data from
theGermanstatutoryhealthinsurancesys-
tem, which insures ;90% of the German
population (15). These changes have al-
lowed for new possibilities for estimat-
ing the burden of diabetes in Germany.
Hence, this study estimates the number
of excess deaths due to diabetes (ICD-10
codes E10–E14) and type 2 diabetes (ICD-
10 code E11) in Germany, which is the
number of deaths that could have been
prevented if the diabetes mortality rate
was as high as that of the population with-
out diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Data
Routine health care data are collected
and checked for plausibility and com-
pleteness by the Federal Social Insurance
Authority for morbidity-related risk strat-
ification reimbursement among the stat-
utory health insurance funds in Germany.
All insurees are assigned a unique pseu-
donym to avoid double counting when
they change their statutory health insur-
ance fund during the year (16). Data
completeness and plausibility are exam-
ined according to a plausibility concept by
the Federal Social Insurance Authority
(§273 and §268 of the Code of Social
Law V, §3 Data Transparency Regula-
tion) (15,16). Aggregated data are pro-
vided by the German Institute of Medical
Documentation and Information (DIMDI)
for health service analysis in accordance
with strict data protection regulations.
Thus, information about insurees are
grouped into 5-year age-bands (16). For
analyses, people continuously insured
for $360 days by statutory health insur-
ance in 2010 were included. People who
died, moved abroad, or switched to or
from private insurance during the year
2010 and those with implausible infor-
mation were excluded from the analysis
(n = 4.6 million) (17). Altogether, we esti-
mated the prevalence of an ascertained
diagnosis of diabetes (ICD-10 codes E10–
E14) and type 2 diabetes (ICD-10 code
E11) on the basis of 64.9 million people,
representing 93% of the entire popu-
lation insured by the German statu-
tory health insurance system. Overall,
10.1% of the German statutory health in-
surance system population had diabe-
tes and 7.3% had type 2 diabetes in
2010 (17).
To estimate the absolute number of
people with diabetes in each age-group,
the respective prevalences were multi-
plied by the overall number of people in
each age-band (18). Furthermore, the
overall mortality of Germans was calcu-
lated by using the German period life ta-
ble and age distribution of Germany from
2010 (18,19).
Nationwide data on mortality ratios for
diabetes and no diabetes are not avail-
able for Germany. Although estimates of
diabetes-specific mortality are available
fromcohort studies, these aretoohetero-
geneous because they originate from var-
ious regions in Germany and use different
age-groups as well as different age stan-
dardizations (11–13). Thus, the age- and
sex-specific mortality rate ratios between
people with diabetes and without dia-
betes were used from a Danish study
wherein the Danish National Diabetes
Register was linked to the individual
mortality data from the Civil Registra-
tion System that includes all people resid-
ing in Denmark (5). Because the Danish
National Diabetes Register is one of
the most accurate diabetes registries in
Europe, with a sensitivity of 86% and pos-
itive predictive value of 90% (5), we are
convinced that the Danish estimates are
highly valid and reliable. Denmark and
Germany have a comparable standard of
living and health care system. The diabe-
tesprevalencein these countriesis similar
(Denmark 7.2%, Germany 7.4% [20]) and
mortality of people with and without
diabetes comparable, as shown in the
European mortality database, an initia-
tive from the World Health Organization.
The crude death rate of non–insulin-
dependent diabetes (ICD-10 code E11)
per 100,000 deaths in 2010 was 9.8 in
Denmark and 9.6 in Germany. The crude
death rate of all causes per 100,000
deaths was 930 in Denmark (2012) and
1,072 in Germany (2014) (21). Further-
more, several examples can be found in
the literature that show that relative risks
are stable measures across many differ-
ent populations (22). Nevertheless, resid-
ual differences in mortality between
Denmark and Germany may still be pre-
sent; hence, we conducted two sensitivity
analyses that reflect the uncertainty of
the estimations. In the first sensitivity
analysis, we assumed that the mortality
rate ratio in Germany can differ from the
Danish population by 615%, as we previ-
ously assumed in a similar study (17). In
the second analysis, we considered the
average annual decrease in mortality
rate ratio, which was 1.4% (95% CI 0.9–
1.8) in men and 0.7% (95% CI 0.2–1.2) in
women (5).
Statistical Analysis
The number of excess deaths stratified by
age E(a) was calculated as E(a) = D1(a) 2
D0(a), where D1(a) is the number of
deaths within the population of people
with diabetes who were age a in 2010
and D0(a) is the age-specific number of
deaths of people with diabetes if mortal-
ity was the same as that in the population
without diabetes. D1(a) and D0(a) were
calculated as follows: D1(a) = C(a) 3
{1 2 exp[2m1(a)]} and D0 = C(a) 3
{1 2 exp[2m0(a)]}, where m1 and m0
are the mortality of people with and with-
out diabetes, respectively, and C(a) is the
number people with diabetes. To estimate
C(a), the number of people in Germany,
N(a), was multiplied by the age-specific
prevalence of diabetes, p = p(a).
Mortality m1 and m0 for Germany were
calculated by using the mortality rate
ratio R from the Danish National Diabe-
tes Register. For this, we decompo-
sed the general mortality of people in
Germany (m) into the mortality of
people with and without diabetes: m =
p 3 m1 + (1 2 p)m0, which can also be
written as m = m0 [p(R – 1) + 1]. Hence,
mortality m0 and m1 of people without
and with diabetes can be determined
1704
Burden of Mortality Attributable to Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 40, December 2017
 as m0 = m/[p(R 2 1) + 1] and m1 = R 3 m0.
In addition to excess deaths, the mortality
population-attributable fraction (PAF)
was estimated. PAF(a) is defined as the
proportion of deaths attributable to dia-
betes and was calculated as the number
of excess deaths divided by the number
of total deaths: PAF(a) = E(a)/[N(a){1 2
exp[2m(a)]}].
All analyses were stratified by sex.
Statistical analyses were performed by
using R version 3.2.1 software (The R
Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria). The code for the primary
analysis can be found in the Supplemen-
tary Data. Because of strict regulations
on data protection, German routine stat-
utory health insurance system (DIMDI)
data are only available in anonymous
and aggregated form (§5 Data Transpar-
ency Regulation, paragraph 4); therefore,
ethics committee approval was not nec-
essary. Moreover, all data used for the
analysis have already been published
(5,17).
RESULTS
In total, 174,627 excess deaths (137,950
from type 2 diabetes) could have been
prevented in 2010 if mortality was the
same in people with and without diabe-
tes. Overall, 21% of all deaths in Germany
were attributable to diabetes, and
16% were attributable to type 2 dia-
betes (Tables 1 and 2). Slightly more
male than female excess deaths occurred
in 2010 (Tables 1 and 2). Altogether,
92,924 male excess deaths related to di-
abetes (73,427 due to type 2 diabetes)
and 81,703 female excess deaths related
to diabetes (64,523 due to type 2 diabe-
tes) were found. Most of the excess
deaths occurred in the 70- to 79- and 80-
to 89-year-old age-groups (;34% each)
(Figs. 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2). Sub-
stantial sex differences were found in
diabetes-related excess deaths. From the
age of ;40 years, the number of male
excess deaths due to diabetes started to
grow, but the number of female excess
deaths increased with a delay. Thus, the
highest number of male excess deaths due
to diabetes occurred at the age of ;75
years, whereas the peak of female excess
deaths was ;10 years later. The same
pattern was observed for the analysis of
excess deaths due to type 2 diabetes.
The age-specific mortality rates of pa-
tients with diabetes and type 2 diabetes
were similar (Supplementary Figs. 1–4).
The diabetes mortality rates increased
with age and were always higher than in
the population without diabetes. The
largest differences in mortality rates
between people with and without diabe-
tes were observed in the younger age-
groups.
Sensitivity Analyses
The first sensitivity analysis assumed that
the mortality rate ratio R in Germany
differs from the Danish population. Thus,
we calculated the excess deaths by
modifying R by 615%. With this assump-
tion, the number of excess deaths would
have been within the range of 137,459–
212,108 (and between 107,294 and
169,588 for type 2 diabetes). Further-
more, we took the annual decrease of
the mortality rate ratio into account,
which was observed in the Danish study
(21.4% in men and 20.7% in women).
Thus, the total number of excess deaths
would have been 160,773 due to diabe-
tes and 126,424 due to type 2 diabetes
(Tables 1 and 2). More information on age-
specificanalysesisshowninSupplementary

CONCLUSIONS
To the best of our knowledge, these na-
tionwide estimates of the number of ex-
cess deaths due to diabetes are the first
in the German population. To calculate
these estimates, we included nationwide
prevalence data from 64.9 million people
insured by the German statutory health
insurance system and mortality rate ra-
tios from the Danish National Diabetes
Register, which are comparable to the
mortality ratios of the German popula-
tion. The analysis revealed that 174,627
deaths (137,950 due to type 2 diabetes)
could have been prevented if the mortal-
ity was the same in people with diabetes
as in the population without diabetes.
Approximately 21% of all deaths were
attributable to diabetes in Germany
(16% attributable to type 2 diabetes).
Similar to the current analysis, the
global burden of mortality attributable
to diabetes was estimated from the Inter-
national Diabetes Federation (IDF) (1,23).
In 2010, an estimated number of 634,054
(619,847 in 2013) excess deaths were due
to diabetes in Europe in the 20- to 79-
year-old age-group, comprising 11%
(10.2% in 2013) of all causes of death.
The differences between our estimates
of attributable deaths (21% for diabetes)
and those of the IDF may be explained by
the different data sources used for the
calculations. The IDF used age- and sex-
specific relative risks of death for people
with diabetes compared with those
without diabetes from the Diabetes Epi-
demiology:CollaborativeAnalysisofDiag-
nostic Criteria in Europe (DECODE) study,
which were derived from 30,000 sub-
jects from 20 European studies (1,23).
The analysis from the Danish National
Diabetes Register included records from
;360,000 people with diabetes; these re-
cords were linked to the mortality data

 from the Civil Registration System, which
includes all people in Denmark (5). The
mortality rate ratios found in the DECODE
study (23) and an analysis of the Danish
National Diabetes Register (5) decreased
with increasing age. Within the various
age-groups, the estimates were slightly
lower in the DECODE study than in the
Danish National Diabetes Register anal-
ysis. However, the IDF reported an in-
creasing number of excess deaths with
increasing age. The highest number of ex-
cess deaths was observed in the oldest
age-group of 70–79 years (1,23), which
is in accordance with the current findings
because we identified most of the excess
deaths in the 70- to 79- and 80- to 89-
year-old age-groups (;34% each for all
types of diabetes and type 2 diabetes).
The high number of deaths in these age-
groups can partly be explained by the
general life expectancy in Germany. Fur-
thermore, there was a synergy effect of
age and diabetes duration with longer
durations in older age-groups, which
also was found in a U.S. study in 72,000
people with type 2 diabetes (24). Accord-
ingly, the number of severe complica-
tions, such as end-stage renal disease,
eye disease, lower-extremity amputation,
stroke, and heart failure, and mortality
also increased considerably in the older
age-groups (24). In summary, the esti-
mated PAF reflects not only the cause-
and-effect relationship between diabetes
and death but also the relationship be-
tween all diabetes-related diseases and
death. Most people with diabetes die as a
result of micro- and macrovascular com-
plications. In addition, people with diabe-
tes may have an elevated risk for other
life-threatening diseases, such as cancer
(25). Thus, the attributable risk provides
information on the absolute excess mor-
tality risk in people with diabetes com-
pared with those without diabetes.
The analysis also revealed that mortal-
ity in people with diabetes is much higher
than that of the population without dia-
betes, irrespective of age. In addition, the
largest differences in mortality were pre-
sent in the younger age-groups. These re-
sults are in accordance with previous
studies worldwide (3,4,7,9) and regional
studies in Germany (11–13).
According to official numbers from the
Federal Statistical Office, 858,768 people
died in Germany in 2010, with 23,131
deaths due to diabetes, representing
2.7% of the all-cause mortality (26).
Hence, in Germany, diabetes is not
ranked among the top 10 most common
causes of death, although this has been
an established fact worldwide for several
years (2). We found that 21% of all deaths
were attributable to diabetes and 16%
were attributable to type 2 diabetes;
hence, we suggest that the number of
excess deaths attributable to diabetes is
strongly underestimated if we rely on re-
ported causes of death from death certif-
icates, as official statistics do. Estimating
diabetes-related mortality is challenging
because most people die as a result of
diabetes complications and comorbid-
ities, such as cardiovascular disease and
renal failure, which often are reported as
the underlying cause of death (1,23). For
this reason, another approach is to focus
not only on the underlying cause of death
but also on the multiple causes of death
to assess any mention of a disease on the
death certificate (27). In a study from
Italy, the method of assessing multiple
causes of death revealed that in 12.3%
of all studied death certificates, diabe-
tes was mentioned, whereas only 2.9%
reported diabetesasthe underlyingcause
of death (27), corresponding to a four
times higher proportion of death related

Burden of Mortality Attributable to Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 40, December 2017
 to diabetes. Another nationwide analysis
from Canada found that diabetes was
more than twice as likely to be a contrib-
uting factor to death than the underlying
cause of death from the years 2004–2008
(28). A recently published study from the
U.S. that was based on two represen-
tative surveys from 1997 to 2010 found
that 11.5% of all deaths were attributable
to diabetes, which reflects a three to
four times higher proportion of diabetes-
related deaths (29). Overall, these results,
together with the current calculations,
demonstrate that deaths due to diabetes
contribute to a much higher burden than
previously assumed.
The number of deaths attributable to
diabetes continues to rise. In the Global
Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD
2015), a 32% increase in the total num-
ber of deaths due to diabetes was esti-
mated between 2005 and 2015 (30),
which among the 30 leading causes of
death worldwide, is the second largest in-
crease after Alzheimer disease and other
dementias during that period. Hence, di-
abetes was the seventh most common
cause of death after lower tracheal, bron-
chus, and lung cancer and before road in-
juries in 2015 (30). However, the increase
in the total number of deaths due to di-
abetes was mainly attributed to demo-
graphic changes (30). Age-standardized
death rates have decreased over the
past few decades (5–9) possibly because
of more-stringent treatment regimens
with lipid-lowering and antihypertensive
medications (4) and earlier detection of
disease (9). More data are necessary to
address to what extent these trends are
applicabletoGermany(i.e.,improvedtreat-
ment, medication, and disease manage-
ment programs).
The strength of the current study is the
method we used to estimate the number
of excess deaths attributable to diabetes
and type 2 diabetes at the national level.
This method has been used for many
years for various causes of death, such
as cancer (31). Countries without nation-
wide cohorts or diabetes registries could
easily use this approach to estimate the
number of excess deaths due to diabetes
for public health decisions. For this pur-
pose, the use of the best available esti-
mate of country-specific prevalence is
necessary, as well as to identify a country
with reliable mortality data available and
that has a similar standard of living and
health care system. For the calculation,
we used nationwide German routine
health care data, in which ;90% of the
population is included, containing ICD-10
codes E10–E14 for diabetes and E11 for
type 2 diabetes to estimate the respective
diabetes prevalence and the mortality
rate ratio from the Danish National Di-
abetes Register. Denmark and Germany
are comparable according to their health
care systems, standards of living, and
mortality rates. Moreover, the Danish Na-
tional Diabetes Register covers nearly
90% of all people with diabetes in Den-
mark; thus the Danish mortality rate ra-
tios were ideally suited for our approach.
This analysis was not based on the un-
derlying cause of death listed on death
certificates because individual decisions
on the cause of death often do not rep-
resent the primary cause of death, but
rather a secondary disease of diabetes,
which leads to an underestimation of
deaths attributable to diabetes. Further-
more,thismethodenabled usto estimate
excess deaths for the elderly population
by using the prevalence of diabetes from
all insurees in the German statutory
health insurance system.
Several limitations should be men-
tioned. Because of the origin of the data
used to estimate the diabetes prevalence
(routine health claims data provided by
DIMDI), the type of diagnosis may be
fraught with inaccuracies. For this reason,
we used a conservative approach for the
prevalence estimation of all diabetes
types and type 2 diabetes (only people
with a confirmed diagnosis of diabetes).
Prevalence estimates of type 2 diabetes
are solely based on ICD-10 diabetes code
E11 (17), which may explain the lower-
than-expected proportion of all diabetes
identified as type 2 (i.e., 70% vs. the ex-
pected proportion of 90–95%) because
other ICD-10 codes, such as E12–E14
(malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus,
other specified diabetes mellitus, and
unspecified diabetes mellitus); double
diagnoses; and implausible combinations
of these ICD-10 codes were excluded from
the data set. Moreover, a slightly over-
or underestimation of diabetes preva-
lence could be present, as previously
mentioned by Tamayo et al. (17), because
the data set only included people with
statutory health insurance for $360
days per year, indicating that we were
unable to consider the health conditions
of those who died, moved abroad, or
changed to or from a private health in-
surance. Furthermore, we could not esti-
mate the prevalence of people with
undiagnosed diabetes because health
claims data do not contain information
on standardized glucose measurements
or glycated hemoglobin values. Overall,
we consider the current data set to be
of high quality. First, incorrect codings
seldom occur because the manipula-
tion of ICD-10 codes is against the law.

 However, false codings of diabetes type
may occur in cases of an untypical diabe-
tes course. Second, the data are primarily
used for morbidity-related risk stratifica-
tion reimbursement between insurance
funds; thus, data handling is deter-
mined by strict regulations prescribed
by German law (§273 and §268 of the
Code of Social Law V, §3 Data Transpar-
ency Regulation). Finally, other studies
have revealed similar prevalence esti-
mates, which are in line with the current
results (32,33).
Another limitation is that we used the
Danish mortality rate ratios to calculate
German mortality of people with and
without diabetes because of the lack of ap-
propriate data. Although we assume that
theDanishestimatesarehighlyreliableand
the general and diabetes-specific mortality
are comparable between Germany and
Denmark, residual differences may be pre-
sent. As a consequence, we conducted two
different sensitivity analyses to account for
uncertainties.
In conclusion, we have estimated for
the first time in our knowledge the abso-
lute number of excess deaths for people
with diabetes and type 2 diabetes in
Germany. The study found that 174,627
excess deaths were attributable to dia-
betes (deaths due to type 2 diabetes:
137,950) in 2010, which is considerably
higher than the official German esti-
mates that relied on information from
death certificates. The method can be
applied to other countries without na-
tional diabetes registries to determine
the national burden of mortality attrib-
utable to diabetes.
