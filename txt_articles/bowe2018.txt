The 2016 global and national burden of diabetes mellitus 
attributable to PM2·5 air pollution
Benjamin Bowe, Yan Xie, Tingting Li, Yan Yan, Hong Xian, Ziyad Al-Aly
Summary
Background PM2·5 air pollution is associated with increased risk of diabetes; however, a knowledge gap exists to 
further define and quantify the burden of diabetes attributable to PM2·5 air pollution. Therefore, we aimed to define 
the relationship between PM2·5 and diabetes. We also aimed to characterise an integrated exposure response function 
and to provide a quantitative estimate of the global and national burden of diabetes attributable to PM2·5.
Methods We did a longitudinal cohort study of the association of PM2·5 with diabetes. We built a cohort of US veterans 
with no previous history of diabetes from various databases. Participants were followed up for a median of 8·5 years, we 
and used survival models to examine the association between PM2·5 and the risk of diabetes. All models were adjusted 
for sociodemographic and health characteristics. We tested a positive outcome control (ie, risk of all-cause mortality), 
negative exposure control (ie, ambient air sodium concentrations), and a negative outcome control (ie, risk of lower 
limb fracture). Data for the models were reported as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Additionally, we reviewed studies 
of PM2·5 and the risk of diabetes, and used the estimates to build a non-linear integrated exposure response function to 
characterise the relationship across all concentrations of PM2·5 exposure. We included studies into the building of the 
integrated exposure response function if they scored at least a four on the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale 
and were only included if the outcome was type 2 diabetes or all types of diabetes. Finally, we used the Global Burden of 
Disease study data and methodologies to estimate the attributable burden of disease (ABD) and disability-adjusted life-
years (DALYs) of diabetes attributable to PM2·5 air pollution globally and in 194 countries and territories.
Findings We examined the relationship of PM2·5 and the risk of incident diabetes in a longitudinal cohort of 
1 729 108 participants followed up for a median of 8·5 years (IQR 8·1–8·8). In adjusted models, a 10 µg/m³ increase 
in PM2·5 was associated with increased risk of diabetes (HR 1·15, 95% CI 1·08–1·22). PM2·5 was associated with 
increased risk of death as the positive outcome control (HR 1·08, 95% CI 1·03–1·13), but not with lower limb 
fracture as the negative outcome control (1·00, 0·91–1·09). An IQR increase (0·045 µg/m³) in ambient air sodium 
concentration as the negative exposure control exhibited no significant association with the risk of diabetes (HR 1·00, 
95% CI 0·99–1·00). An integrated exposure response function showed that the risk of diabetes increased substantially 
above 2·4 µg/m³, and then exhibited a more moderate increase at concentrations above 10 µg/m³. Globally, ambient 
PM2·5 contributed to about 3·2 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·2–3·8) incident cases of diabetes, about 8·2 
million (95% UI 5·8–11·0) DALYs caused by diabetes, and 206 105 (95% UI 153 408–259 119) deaths from diabetes 
attributable to PM2·5 exposure. The burden varied substantially among geographies and was more heavily skewed 
towards low-income and lower-to-middle-income countries.
Interpretation The global toll of diabetes attributable to PM2·5 air pollution is significant. Reduction in exposure will 
yield substantial health benefits.

Introduction
Air pollution is an important global health problem.1 
PM2·5—the most widely studied air pollutant—is 
associated with increased risk of cardio 
vascular disease, 
pulmonary disease, kidney disease, and other non-
communicable diseases,2,3 and contributed to about 
4·2 million premature deaths in 2015.4 A growing body of 
evidence strongly suggests an association between PM2·5 
pollution and the risk of diabetes.5–11
The Lancet Commission12 on pollution and health 
published its report in October, 2017, and it provided a 
comprehensive review of the effect of the so-called 
pollutome on human health. The Commission outlined a 
glaring deficiency in evidence and provided a set of 
recommendations to fill important knowledge gaps. 
One of the recommendations outlined by the Commission 
is to “define and quantify the burden of diabetes 
attributable to PM2·5 air pollution”.12 An assessment of the 
global and national burden of diabetes attributable to 
PM2·5 would provide a better understanding of the 
epidemiology of diabetes, identify endemic areas, and 
further contribute to the global and national discussions

on the hazardous effect of air pollution on diabetes. 
Therefore in this study, we aimed to further define the 
relationship of PM2·5 and diabetes, using a longitudinal 
cohort study design. We also aimed to characterise an 
integrated exposure response function, using the body of 
evidence on the relationship of PM2·5 pollution and 
diabetes; and to provide a quantitative estimate of the 
global and national burden of diabetes attributable to 
PM2·5 in 194 countries and territories, using the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) methodologies.
Methods
Longitudinal cohort study design
We did a longitudinal cohort study of the association of 
PM2·5 with diabetes. A cohort of US veterans with no 
previous history of diabetes was built by linking the US 
Department of Veterans Affairs’ databases13–23 with the US 
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Community 
Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System of PM2·5,24,25 
where time of cohort entry was set as date of last 
outpatient blood panel between Oct 1, 2003, and 
Sept 30, 2004. Further details on these datasets and 
cohort construction are provided in the appendix 
(pp 2–3). Participants were followed up for a median 
duration of 8·5 years. The outcome of incident diabetes 
was defined by International Classification of Diseases-9 
code, diabetes medication prescription, or an HbA1c 
measurement more than 6·4% (>46·4 mmol/mol); and 
participants were censored at death or end of follow-up 
(Sept 30, 2012). PM2·5 exposure value was assigned on the 
basis of county of residence at time of cohort entry.
Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine 
the relationship between PM2·5 and the risk of diabetes, 
with censoring at death or end of follow-up. Selection of 
covariates was informed by previous studies.15,16–18,26 All 
models were adjusted for age, race, sex, estimated 
glomerular filtration rate, systolic blood pressure, hyper-
lipidaemia, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, 
cancer, body-mass index, smoking status, use of an 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin 
receptor blocker, percentage of people in poverty in each 
county of residence, population density of county of 
residence, number of admissions to hospital before 
beginning of follow-up, and how many times serum 
creatinine was measured before beginning of follow-up. 
Further details on data sources, variable definitions, and 
statistical analyses are included in the appendix (pp 2–11). 
Missing data were not imputed. In analyses, a 95% CI of 
a hazard ratio (HR) that does not include unity was 
considered significant. In all analyses, p<0·05 was 
considered significant.
We additionally curated data from the US County Health 
Rankings datasets and controlled for US county level char-
acteristics in the following six domains: health outcomes, 
health behaviours, clinical care, social and economic 
factors, physical environment, and demo 
graphics.27,28 We

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous epidemiological evidence suggests that environmental 
exposure to PM2·5 is associated with risk of diabetes. However, 
the Lancet Commission on pollution and health identified 
knowledge gaps and outlined several research recommendations 
including the need to further “define and quantify the burden of 
diabetes attributable to PM2·5 air pollution”.
Added value of this study
This study addresses the research recommendation and provides 
evidence that ambient PM2·5 pollution is associated with 
increased risk of diabetes. We examined the association in a 
longitudinal cohort of about 1·7 million US veterans, in which we 
control for relevant individual-level variables and ecological 
characteristics. We tested a positive control, as well as negative 
outcome and exposure controls to address concern about 
spurious causal inference. The study synthesised previous 
evidence to build an integrated exposure response function to 
characterise the risk of diabetes across all PM2·5 concentrations 
experienced by humans. The integrated exposure response 
function was non-linear in that risk increased substantially above 
PM2·5 concentrations of 2·4 µg/m3, and then exhibited a more 
moderate increase in risk at concentrations above 10 µg/m3. 
Additionally, the study suggests that in 2016, there were about 
3·2 million cases of incident diabetes, and about 8·2 million 
healthy life years lost due to diabetes attributable to air pollution. 
The burden varied substantially by geography and was most 
pronounced in less developed countries.
Implications of all the available evidence
Taken together, the findings address the knowledge gap 
outlined in the Lancet Commission on pollution and health to 
“define and quantify the burden of diabetes attributable to PM2·5 
air pollution”. Most importantly, the study shows that 
substantial risk exists at concentrations well below those 
outlined in the air quality standards of WHO and national and 
international regulatory agencies. Although the non-linearity of 
the integrated exposure response function suggests modest 
reduction in risk unless PM2·5 is decreased substantially in 
high-pollution areas, given the considerable number of people 
living in heavily polluted geographies, even incremental 
reductions in PM2·5 will ameliorate the burden of diabetes. 
Finally, we observed that the burden of diabetes attributable to 
PM2·5 exhibited substantial geographical variability, and was 
more skewed towards regions that are least prepared to cope 
with the consequences of this excess burden. The results will 
possibly be helpful to promote the public’s awareness about the 
effect of PM2·5 pollution on the risk of diabetes, and serve to 
inform and guide policy making aimed at addressing health 
consequences of environmental air pollution.

also did a restricted cubic spline analysis to characterise 
the morphology of a non-linear association between PM2·5 
and the risk of diabetes;29 assessed exposure in quartiles; 
assessed exposure in time-varying models, where geo-
graphical location was updated as partici 
pants moved and 
average annual exposure was matched to geographical 
location at any specific time; used the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration’s (NASA) Socioeconomic Data 
and Applications Center’s Global Annual PM2·5 Grids 
from Moderate Resol 
ution Imaging Spectroradiometer, 
Multi-angle Imaging Spectro 
radiometer, and Sea-Viewing 
Wide Field-of View Sensor’s aerosol optical depth remote 
spaceborne satellite sensing data30,31 as an alternative data 
source for exposure; varied the spatial resolution of 
exposure definition where we assigned exposure levels on 
the basis of the nearest air monitoring station within 
30 miles, 10 miles, and 5 miles; assessed the relationship 
between PM2·5 and risk of all-cause mortality as a positive 
control;1,32 assessed the relationship between ambient air 
sodium concentrations and risk of diabetes as a negative 
exposure control;33 assessed the relationship between 
ambient air sodium concentrations and risk of all-
cause mortality; and assessed the relationship between 
PM2·5 and the risk of lower limb fracture. Further de-
tails on these sensitivity analyses are provided in the 
appendix (pp 5–11).
The use of a negative control is a valuable complement 
to other epidemiological methods and serves to identify 
and resolve both suspected and unsuspected sources of 
spurious causal inference including confounding, 
mismeasurements, and other biases, as well as design 
or analytic flaws.34 Ambient air sodium concentration is 
measured by air monitoring stations; however, there 
is no biological basis to support an association 
between sodium concentrations in the air and the risk 
of diabetes. Therefore, ambient air sodium is an 
appropriate negative exposure control.34 The negative 
outcome control was selected on the basis of the criteria 
outlined by Lipsitch and colleagues.34 There is no 
previous knowledge of and no biological or mechanistic 
plausibility to explain an association between PM2·5 and 
the risk of lower limb fracture. We therefore considered 
it a suitable negative outcome control.
Integrated exposure response function
An integrated exposure response function based on 
GBD methodologies was built to assess the risk of 
diabetes due to PM2·5 across the spectrum of PM2·5 
exposure concentrations around the world.4,35,36 A 
literature review was done, where we evaluated currently 
available literature on the associations between risk of 
diabetes and PM2·5, passive smoking, and active smoking 
for the use in building an integrated exposure response 
function.5–11,37–60 Passive smoking and active smoking 
were used as proxy exposures for high concentration of 
PM2·5, because published literature on PM2·5 tends to be 
from developed countries with these values on the lower 
end of the spectrum, therefore, leaving a scarcity of 
evidence on the relationship at higher concentrations of 
exposure.4,35,36,61 Exposure attribution, as estimated by 
previous studies,32,35 is derived from breathing rate (ie, 
average volume of air breathed per minute), and the 
PM2·5 mass per cig 
arette, or ambient exposure due to 
living with someone who smokes.
Studies were included in the building of the integrated 
exposure response function if they scored at least a four 
on 
the 
Newcastle-Ottawa 
Quality 
Assessment 
Scale10,62—a nine-point scale for assessing quality of 
cohort studies—and were only included if the outcome 
was type 2 diabetes or all types of diabetes. Active 
smoking studies were only included if they contained a 
recorded dose-response of cigarettes per day, which was 
necessary for assigning a corresponding PM2·5 exposure 
value, and if the reference group consisted of those who 
had never smoked. Passive smoking studies were 
included if the reference group had never smoked and 
were not exposed to passive smoke. Passive smoke was 
assigned a PM2·5 exposure of 35 µg/m³, and active 
smoking 667 µg/m³ per cigarette per day.4,35,36 Selected 
studies, along with the Veterans Affairs longitudinal 
cohort study presented here, were included in building 
the integrated exposure response function; details on 
included studies are presented in the appendix 
(pp 12, 19–28).
The integrated exposure–response function fits avail-
able epidemiological data using a Bayesian hierarchical 
modelling approach, and is based on GBD methodology, 
which has been described elsewhere in detail.4,35,36 The 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) was 
assigned on the basis of a uniform distribution of PM2·5 
from 2·4 μg/m³ to 5·9 μg/m³, representing exposure 
values between the minimum and fifth percentiles of 
exposure distributions from outdoor air pollution 
cohort studies.4,35,63 TMREL by its definition should 
mini 
mise individual-level and population-level risk and 
be theoretically possible to achieve, but not necessarily 
affordable or feasible to achieve.63 Studies were 
weighted using the quality effects approach.64 Results 
were obtained from 1000 sets of simulated values.4,35,36 
The mean and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) are 
presented.
Estimation of the burden of diabetes due to PM2·5
National annual PM2·5 exposure estimates, which are 
population weighted and derived from the integration of 
satellite data, surface measurements, geographical data, 
and a chemical transport model, were obtained from 
GBD 2015.4,65 Estimates are population weighted. Incident 
rates, years of life lived with disability (YLD), years of life 
lost (YLL), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of 
diabetes and all causes, and their UIs were obtained 
from GBD 2016.66,67 The GBD methodology, explained 
elsewhere in detail,36,68 estimates these measures by using 
data from specific published literature on diabetes

and mortality in hierarchical models.66,68–71 The GBD 
Population Estimates dataset provided population size.72 
Country income classifications were obtained from the 
World Bank.73
The population attributable fraction (PAF) of diabetes 
due to PM2·5 represents the proportion of diabetes that 
would be eliminated if the PM2·5 exposure was reduced to 
concentrations equal to or less than the TMREL. The PAF 
of diabetes due to PM2·5 exposure above the TMREL was 
calculated with a GBD 2016 equation,71 using risk 
estimates from the integrated exposure response 
function. The TMREL was set as a uniform distribution 
between 2·4 μg/m³ and 5·9 μg/m³, for which levels 
under the TMREL were treated as contributing no risk.4 
The attributable burden of disease (ABD), defined as the 
number of incident cases of diabetes per year attributable 
to PM2·5 exceeding the TMREL, was calculated using 
estimates of diabetes from the GBD 2016 study68 
multiplied by the PAF of diabetes due to PM2·5 exceeding 
the TMREL.
YLD due to diabetes is a measure of the burden placed 
on a population due to the ill-effects of living with diabetes. 
YLL due to diabetes is a measure of the burden placed on 
a population due to dying prematurely from diabetes. The 
DALY due to diabetes is a summary measure of YLD and 
YLL, and represents the total years of healthy life lost due 
to ill-health, disability, or early death due to diabetes.74 
YLD, YLL, and DALYs of diabetes due to PM2·5 were 
estimated by multiplying the diabetes- specific GBD 
values of the corresponding measure by the PAF of 
diabetes due to PM2·5 exceeding the TMREL.36,68 Details of 
these measures are discussed in the appendix (pp 13–15).
Uncertainty in measurements was factored in our 
estimations 
through 
the 
generation 
of 
measures 
from a distribution of 10 000 estimates, and the med-
ian and 95% UIs are reported. Further details on 
estim 
ation and UIs are presented in the appendix 
(pp 14, 15). Burden measures are reported as values, rates 
per 100 000 population, and age-standardised rates 
per 100 000 population. World maps of age-standardised 
ABD, YLD, YLL, and DALY rates are presented. 
Age-standardised DALY rates were additionally analysed 
by World Bank income classification and the socio-
demographic index quintile.
Statistical analysis
We did all analyses in SAS (version 7
.1). We generated 
maps using ArcMap (version 10.5). The study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of the VA Saint Louis 
Health Care System (Saint Louis, MO, USA).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to all 
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
We examined the relationship of PM2·5 and the risk 
of incident diabetes in a longitudinal cohort of 
1 729 108 part 
icipants followed up for a median of 8·5 years 
(IQR 8·1–8·8). The demographic and health char-
acteristics of the cohort participants are detailed in the 
appendix (pp 16–17). PM2·5 concentrations obtained from 
EPA ranged from 5·0 µg/m³ to 22·1 µg/m³. In models 
adjusted for individual-level sociodemographic and health 
character 
istics, a 10·0 µg/m³ increase in PM2·5 exposure 
was associated with increased risk of diabetes (HR 1·15, 
95% CI 1·08–1·22; table 1). Because characteristics of 
geographies might confound the association between 
PM2·5 and the risk of diabetes,75 we curated the US County 
Health 
Rankings’ 
datasets27,28 
and 
built 
analyses 
additionally controlling for 55 US county-level variables 
in the six domains aforementioned. Models addition-
ally adjusting for US county characteristics yielded 
consistent results in that an increase in PM2·5 was 
associated with increased risk of diabetes (HR 1·12, 
95% CI 1·02–1·24; table 1). A spline analysis sug-
gested that the relationship between PM2·5 con 
centrat-
ions and the risk of incident diabetes increased 
with increased concentrations of PM2·5 and then nearly 
plateaued at concentrations exceeding 12·0 µg/m³ 
(figure 1). The results were consistent in analysis con-
sidering PM2·5 in quartiles; in that compared with 
quartile 1 (5·0–10·1 μg/m³), the risk was increased in 
quartile 2 (consisting of PM2·5 concentrations of 
10·2–11·8 μg/m³; HR 1·08, 95% CI 1·05–1·12) and then 
nearly plateaued in quartiles 3 and 4 (consisting of PM2·5 
concentrations ≥11·9 µg/m³; HR 1·13 [95% CI 1·07–1·18] 
for quartile 3, and 1·14 [1·10–1·19] for quartile 4; table 1). 
Results were consistent when exposure was treated 
as time varying (HR 1·18, 95% CI 1·10–1·25), where it was 
up 
dated as cohort partici 
pants moved from one location to 
another and as PM2·5 estimates changed over the dur 
ation 
of follow-up (table 1).
We additionally considered PM2·5 estimates derived 
from NASA’s spaceborne satellite sensors as an 
alternative data source to define ambient PM2·5 exposure 
concentrations. Analyses considering these data yielded 
results consistent with those shown using exposure 
data obtained from the EPA ground-based air 
monitoring stations (HR 1·13, 95% CI 1·11–1·15; 
table 1). Results were consistent in models where 
exposure concentrations were assigned on the basis of 
the nearest air monitoring station within 30 miles, 
10 miles, and 5 miles (appendix p 18).
We examined the association of PM2·5 and risk of all-
cause mortality where a priori observations suggest that 
an association is expected (ie, the positive outcome 
control).1,76 Our results showed a significant association 
between PM2·5 concen 
trations and the risk of death 
(HR 1·08, 95% CI 1·03–1·13; table 1). We tested the 
association between ambient air sodium concentrations 
and the risk of diabetes (ie, a negative exposure control); 
 Articles

e305
the results showed a non-significant association 
(HR 1·00, 95% CI 0·99–1·00; table 1). There was also 
no 
significant 
association 
between 
air 
sodium 
concentrations and the risk of all-cause mortality as a 
negative exposure control (HR 1·00, 95% CI 1·00–1·01) 
and no significant association between PM2·5 and risk of 
lower limb fracture as a negative outcome control (1·00, 
0·91–1·09; table 1).
A summary table listing the studies used in 
the analysis of synthesising the integrated exposure 
response function is provided in the appendix 
(pp 19–28). The integrated exposure response function 
showed that the risk of diabetes increased substantially 
for PM2·5 concentrations above the lower bound of the 
TMREL of 2·4 µg/m³ then exhibited a more moderate 
increase in risk at concentrations above 10 µg/m³ 
(figure 2).
In 2016, the global burden of incident diabetes 
attributable to PM2·5 was, in 1000s, 3002·9 (95% UI 
2208·6–3798·9). Globally, ABD per 100 000 population 
was 40·62 (95% UI 29·9–51·4), and age-standardised 
ABD per 100 000 population was 40·4 (29·7–51·1; 
table 2). Global diabetes DALYs attributable to long-
term exposure to PM2·5 were 8·2 million (95% UI 
5·8–11·0), consisting of 4·1 million (2·4–6·2) YLD and 
4·1 million (3·1–5·1) YLL. The 2016 global YLD, YLL, 
and DALYs of diabetes attrib 
utable to PM2·5 in 1000s, in 
rate per 100 000 population, and age-standardised rate 
per 100 000 population are reported in table 3. Age-
standardised DALY rates per 100 000 population 
increased as World Bank income classification 
decreased, and also as sociodemographic index 
decreased (figure 3).
Tables 2 and 3 also report the ABD, YLD, YLL, and 
DALYs for the ten most populated countries. ABD, YLD, 
YLL, and DALYs for the 194 countries and territories are 
provided in the appendix (pp 29–53). Among the 
ten most populated countries, China had the highest 
ABD of 600·3 (95% UI 447·2–757·3), followed by India 
with an ABD of 590·5 (447·0–737·1), and then the USA, 
with an ABD of 149·5 (85·2–210·3) in 1000s (table 2). 
Pakistan had an ABD per 100 000 population of 
58·8 (95% UI 44·1–74·3), followed by the USA with an 
ABD per 100 000 pop 
ulation of 46·3 (26·4–65·1), and 
then India with an ABD per 100 000 population of 
44·9 (34·0–56·0). Age-standardised ABD showed 
that Pakistan had the highest with 72·6 (95% UI 
54·4–91·8), followed by India with 48·7 (36·9–60·8), and 
then Bangladesh with 48·6 (37·2–60·2) incident cases 
of diabetes per 100 000 population. There was substan-

graphical heterogeneity in age-standardised 
ABD per 100 000 population; the burden was high in 
several geographical regions including Central America, 
north Africa and the Middle East, southern sub-
Saharan Africa, south Asia, Oceania, and several coun-
tries in southeast Asia (figure 4A; appendix pp 29–35). By 
contrast, several countries had low age-standardised 
ABD per 100 000 population, including Australia, 
New Zealand, and Greenland, as well as some of those in 
central Europe and central Asia (figure 4A; appendix 
pp 29–35).
Among the ten most populated countries, India had the 
highest DALYs (1625·8, 95% UI 1193·7–2104·8), followed 
by China (1251·5, 828·5–1753·3), and then Indonesia 
(400·0, 261·7–544·5), in 1000s (table 3). DALYs per 
100 000 population showed Indonesia as the highest with 
155·1 DALYs (95% UI 101·5–211·1), followed by India 
with 123·4 (90·7–159·9), and then the USA with 
108·5 
(59·3–163·9). 
Age-standardised 
DALYs 
per 
100 000 population showed Pakistan as the highest with 
an age-adjusted DALY rate of 221·7 (95% UI 159·0–291·6), 
followed by Indonesia with 189·4 (124·4–255·7), and then 
India with 165·5 (122·5–212·3; table 3).
Mapping of the geographical distribution of age-
standardised DALYs across the world showed pop-
ulations in Central America, north Africa and 
the Middle East, southern sub-Saharan Africa, south 
Asia, and several countries in southeast Asia exhibited 
high age-standardised DALYs (figure 4B; appendix 
pp 36–51). Canada, Greenland, several countries in 
central and eastern Europe as well as central Asia, 
Russia, and Australia and New Zealand had low 
estimates of age-standardised DALYs (figure 4B; 
appendix pp 36–51). Finally, our estimates suggest that 
in 2016 there were 206 105 (95% UI 153 408–259 119) 
global deaths from diabetes attributable to PM2·5 
exposure.
Discussion
Our results suggest that there is a significant associ-
ation between increased PM2·5 exposure and the risk of 
diabetes. Additionally, our integrated exposure res-
ponse function suggests that risk is significant at 
concentrations below those recommended by regulatory 
agencies. Finally, we observed substantial geograph-
ical variation in the burden of diabetes attributable 
to air pollution, for which we estimated that in 
2016, there were about 3·2 million cases of incident 
diabetes and about 8·2 million years of healthy life lost 
due to diabetes attributable to elevated concentrations 
of PM2·5.
The association of PM2·5 pollution and the risk of 
diabetes is remarkably consistent across a number of 
studies from different populations; it is consistent when 
using EPA or NASA data to define exposure, and it 
passed the scrutiny of application of both positive and 
negative controls. The application of negative exposure 
and outcome controls is especially important to identify 
non-causal associ 
ations and serves as an important 
complement to other epidemiological methods for 
improving causal inference.34 The biological mechanism 
underpinning the association is based on the premise 
that pollutants enter the bloodstream where they might 
interact with tissue components to produce pathological 
effects. This mech 
anism is now supported by evidence 
both in experimental models and humans that inhaled 
nano 
particles, which when sufficiently small can enter 
the bloodstream and interact with distant organs—
including liver tissue—and exhibit affinity to accumulate 
at sites of vascular inflammation.77,78 Furthermore, 
experimental and human evidence suggests that 
exposure to ambient air pollutants can lead to clinically 
significant disturbances in the autonomic nervous

system, oxidative stress, inflam 
mation, endoplasmic 
reticulum stress, apoptosis, and broad metabolic 
derange 
ments in glucose and insulin homoeostasis 
including 
glucose 
intolerance, 
decreased 
insulin 
sensitivity and impaired secretion, and increased 
blood lipid concen 
trations, thus providing biological 
mechanistic plausibility to the association of PM2·5 
exposure and the risk of diabetes.79–87
Our integrated exposure response function suggests 
that the risk of diabetes increased substantially between 
the TMREL and the air quality standards recommended 
by WHO (10 µg/m³) and the EPA (12 µg/m³); there was 
a more moderate increase in the risk at PM2·5 
concentrations greater than 10 µg/m³. The findings are 
consistent with recent data2,3,88 suggesting that even low 
concentration of air pollution might be unsafe, in 
which the unfortunate effect of air pollution becomes 
obvious at relatively low concentrations below those 
currently considered safe by regulatory agencies. The 
morphology of our integrated exposure response 
function is congruent with observations from other 
studies that examined the effect of PM2·5 and other non-
communicable diseases,4 in which following an initial 
sharp increase the risk also nearly plateaued and 
subsequently exhibited minimal increase in risk.4 The 
non-linear integrated exposure response function 
implies that in the most polluted countries a modest 
reduction in PM2·5 will yield small reduction in risk; 
however, given the large populations living in heavily 
polluted 
geographies, 
even 
small 
incremental 
reductions in PM2·5 will yield substantial reduction in 
the burden of diabetes.
The toll of diabetes attributable to PM2·5 pollution is 
substantial; long-term exposure to PM2·5 contributed to 
about 3·2 million cases of diabetes in 2016, representing 
14% of total incident diabetes globally. It contributed to 
about 8·2 million DALYs representing 14·4% of DALYs 
due to diabetes and 0·3% of the overall global toll of 
DALYs due to all diseases. The high toll is driven in part 
by the fact that more people breathe polluted air than 
ever before, as average population-weighted PM2·5 
exposure has increased by 11·2% from 39·7 µg/m³ in 
1990 to 44·2 µg/m³ in 2015. Estimates of PM2·5 
attributable diabetes at the global and national levels 
reflect the influence not only of the increase in 
population-weighted PM2·5 exposure, but also of 
demographic expansion and underlying epidemiological 
trends of increased burden of non-communicable 
disease in general, and more specifically diabetes.
Our results suggest substantial geographical variation 
in the burden of diabetes attributable to air pollution and 
that the burden is more heavily skewed toward regions 
that are less developed (low-income and lower-to-
middle-income countries, and countries with a lower 
socio 
demographic index). As countries develop econ-
omically and undergo an epidemiological transition, 
non-communicable diseases are likely to become even

more prominent as major causes of disease and death, and 
the contribution of air pollution to non-communicable 
diseases in general, and specifically to diabetes will 
probably become even more pronounced. The forces 
of demographic expansion, ageing, epi 
demiological 
transition, and rapid industrial 
isation in low-income and 
lower-to-middle-income countries will probably increase 
the burden of health loss and death due to air pollution. 
The burden of health loss from diabetes attributable to 
PM2·5 pollution is not insignificant in well developed 
countries and in geo 
graphies with relatively lower air 
pollution. Develop 
ing a better understanding of the 
effect of low concentrations of pollution (those currently 
considered safe) on health should be also be addressed by 
funding agencies and the scientific community.88 Scientific 
evidence to define concentrations of particulate matter 
that are safe is needed to inform advocacy and guide 
policy making.
This study has several limitations. Our analyses neither 
considered the source of PM2·5 nor the chemical 
composition and toxic content of PM2·5, which might vary 
within and among countries; however, studies have shown 
that estimates using non-specific PM2·5 biomass alone will 
underestimate the burden of disease attributable to PM2·5 
pollution.1,4,65 Our study focused on quantitating the 
burden of diabetes associated with PM2·5 exposure 
(ie, the Lancet Commission on pollution and health 
research recommendation number two); however, 
evaluation of the burden of diabetes associated with 
exposure to other pollutants including carbon monoxide, 
nitrogen dioxide, and others should be undertaken in 
future research.86,89 Although we accounted for several 
individual-level and county-level health characteristics, 
used two different data sources to define exposure, and 
took care to vary the spatial resolution of exposure 
definition, our analyses do not account for individual-level 
differences in socioeconomic status, physical activity,90–92 
and PM2·5 exposure; however, the successful application of 
both a negative exposure control and negative outcome 
control lessens the concern about residual confounding. 
Our analyses do not provide insight into the subnational 
level; this level is particularly important because several 
countries are especially large and there is likely to be 
substantial national geographical variation in both PM2·5 
and underlying morbidity and mortality rates related to 
diabetes (eg, in India and China) that is not captured in 
our analyses. In this study, we used estimates for incident 
diabetes generated by the GBD study group, and although 
these Bayesian estimates are considered robust, they are 
limited by the quality of the available data.93 Furthermore, 
variability and inconsistency of data collection methods 
and tools across the countries could influence geographical 
variations.93 Because data for the relationship of PM2·5 and 
the risk of diabetes was primarily derived from studies 
done in countries with relatively lower PM2·5 air pollution 
(eg, USA, Canada, and western Europe), we relied on 
active and passive smoking as proxies for exposure to 
higher concentrations of PM2·5 pollution to build our 
integrated exposure response function;35 this analytical 
strategy is well accepted, widely used, and represents the 
optimal methodological approach to quantitate the risk of 
disease associated with PM2·5 exposure given the available 
data.1,4,35,65,94
Our study also had key strengths, such as the 
examination of the relationship between PM2·5 and the 
risk of diabetes in a longitudinal cohort for which we also 
tested a positive control, negative exposure control, and 
negative outcome control to resolve concerns about causal 
inference. We also leveraged the availability of data from 
GBD 2016, which is the most comprehensive compilation 
and analysis of global health information available. We 
use GBD methodologies including the concept of DALYs 
to comprehensively capture the burden of disease across 
the world and a measure of uncertainty.
In conclusion, we provided evidence for a relationship 
between PM2·5 and the risk of diabetes, we synthesised 
available evidence and integrated it to build an exposure 
response function describing the risk of diabetes at each 
level of ambient PM2·5 exposure, and we quantitated the 
burden of diabetes including the number of incident cases 
of diabetes per year, and the years of healthy life lost due to 
diabetes attributable to PM2·5.
