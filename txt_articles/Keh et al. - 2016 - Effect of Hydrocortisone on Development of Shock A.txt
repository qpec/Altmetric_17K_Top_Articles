IMPORTANCE Adjunctive hydrocortisone therapy is suggested by the Surviving Sepsis
Campaign in refractory septic shock only. The efficacy of hydrocortisone in patients with
severe sepsis without shock remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether hydrocortisone therapy in patients with severe sepsis
prevents the development of septic shock.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from
January 13, 2009, to August 27, 2013, with a follow-up of 180 days until February 23, 2014.
The trial was performed in 34 intermediate or intensive care units of university and
community hospitals in Germany, and it included 380 adult patients with severe sepsis who
were not in septic shock.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 either to receive a continuous infusion
of 200 mg of hydrocortisone for 5 days followed by dose tapering until day 11 (n = 190)
or to receive placebo (n = 190).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was development of septic shock
within 14 days. Secondary outcomes were time until septic shock, mortality in the intensive
care unit or hospital, survival up to 180 days, and assessment of secondary infections,
weaning failure, muscle weakness, and hyperglycemia (blood glucose level >150 mg/dL
[to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]).
RESULTS The intention-to-treat population consisted of 353 patients (64.9% male; mean
[SD] age, 65.0 [14.4] years). Septic shock occurred in 36 of 170 patients (21.2%) in the
hydrocortisone group and 39 of 170 patients (22.9%) in the placebo group (difference,
−1.8%; 95% CI, −10.7% to 7.2%; P = .70). No significant differences were observed between
the hydrocortisone and placebo groups for time until septic shock; mortality in the intensive
care unit or in the hospital; or mortality at 28 days (15 of 171 patients [8.8%] vs 14 of 170
patients [8.2%], respectively; difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.6% to 6.7%; P = .86), 90 days
(34 of 171 patients [19.9%] vs 28 of 168 patients [16.7%]; difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, −5.1% to
11.4%; P = .44), and 180 days (45 of 168 patients [26.8%] vs 37 of 167 patients [22.2%],
respectively; difference, 4.6%; 95% CI, −4.6% to 13.7%; P = .32). In the hydrocortisone vs
placebo groups, 21.5% vs 16.9% had secondary infections, 8.6% vs 8.5% had weaning failure,
30.7% vs 23.8% had muscle weakness, and 90.9% vs 81.5% had hyperglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with severe sepsis not in septic shock, use of
hydrocortisone compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of septic shock within 14 days.
These findings do not support the use of hydrocortisone in these patients.

D
espite decades of study and debate, the role of
adjunctive “low-dose” hydrocortisone treatment
(200-300 mg/d) in patients with severe sepsis and sep-
tic shock remains controversial.1 The current recommenda-
tion for hydrocortisone use is mainly based on 2 randomized
clinical trials (RCTs).2 In the study by Annane et al,3 hydro-
cortisone improved survival and reversal of septic shock in pa-
tients with relative adrenal insufficiency. In the CORTICUS
study,4 septic shock was reversed more quickly but mortality
was not significantly reduced. The higher risk of mortality and
septic shock severity in the study by Annane and colleagues
resulted in more restrictive recommendations for hydrocor-
tisone use only in patients with inadequate response to fluid
and vasopressor resuscitation.2 However, septic shock rever-
sal in the CORTICUS study was reported to be significantly ac-
celerated by the administration of hydrocortisone irrespec-
tive of the adrenal response to corticotropin. An international
consensus statement recommended replacing the terms rela-
tive or absolute adrenal insufficiency, which reflect only adre-
nal cortisol release, by the critical illness–related corticoste-
roid insufficiency (CIRCI) concept.5
Althoughmeta-analysesreportcontroversialresultsonmor-
tality reduction by administration of corticosteroids,6,7 there is
consistency regarding shock reversal irrespective of disease se-
verity or the presence of CIRCI.5-7 In a smaller RCT in patients
with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hydrocortisone
significantly improved survival and prevented progression to
shock.8Furthermore,2recentRCTs9,10andameta-analysis11re-
vealed positive effects of steroids in patients with CAP. Assum-
ing that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect a disease con-
tinuum, it was hypothesized that early hydrocortisone
administrationmightpreventshockdevelopmentowingtothe
attenuation of an exaggerated inflammatory response. To our
knowledge, this is the first RCT investigating the effects of hy-
drocortisone to prevent progression to shock in patients with
severe sepsis presenting without shock.
Methods
Study Design
The Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock (HYPRESS)
study is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, placebo-
controlled, double-blind RCT supported by the German Fed-
eral Ministry of Education and Research. The study was con-
ducted in cooperation with the German Sepsis Competence
Network (SepNet) and the Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig, which
provided internet-based randomization and data capture, as-
surance of accuracy and completeness of data, biostatistical
analysis, and pharmacovigilance. Monitoring of sites was per-
formedondefinedintervals.Theprotocolwasapprovedbythe
responsible ethics committees of all 34 participating sites. The
trial protocol is available in Supplement 2.
Study Patients
Patients were screened in intermediate care units or intensive
care units (ICUs) of university and community hospitals for eli-
gibility, and written informed consent was obtained from pa-
tients, patient-authorized representatives, or legal represen-
tatives. Patients were enrolled if they met all inclusion criteria
(for details, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1): (1) provided in-
formed consent; (2) had evidence of infection; (3) had evi-
dence of a systemic response to infection, defined as at least 2
systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria12; and
(4) had evidence of organ dysfunction present for not longer
than 48 hours. The main exclusion criterion was septic shock.
Other exclusion criteria were being younger than 18 years, hav-
ing known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or mannitol
(placebo),orhavingahistoryofglucocorticoidmedicationwith
indication for continuation of therapy or other indications for
treatment with glucocorticoids. Patients were not excluded for
using etomidate within 72 hours before enrollment, using a
short course of glucocorticoids within 72 hours before enroll-
ment, or using topical or inhaled glucocorticoids.
Definitions
Septic shock was defined as sepsis-induced hypotension de-
spite adequate volume status for longer than 4 hours (ie, mean
arterial pressure <65 mm Hg, systolic arterial pressure
<90 mm Hg, or the use of vasopressors to keep mean arterial
pressure ≥65 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressure ≥90 mm Hg).
Patients who had a transient need for vasopressors during ini-
tial resuscitation but were not hypotensive and did not use va-
sopressorsforatleast2hourswereeligibleforenrollmentwhen
septic shock was not present at the time of randomization. Ad-
equate volume status was defined as a central venous pressure
of 8 mm Hg or greater (≥12 mm Hg in ventilated patients) and a
centralvenousoxygensaturationgreaterthan70%.Forfluidre-
placement, patients were to receive at least 500 to 1000 mL of
crystalloids or 300 to 500 mL of colloids over 30 minutes. The
use of hydroxyethyl starch preparations was discouraged ow-
ing to possible harmful effects on kidney function.13,14 Use of
vasopressors was defined as therapy with dopamine at a dos-
ageofatleast5μg/kg/minorwithanydoseofepinephrine,nor-
epinephrine, vasopressin, or other vasopressors. For further
details and definitions, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.
Randomization
Randomization was stratified by participating center and sex.
It was performed with an internet-based computerized ran-
domization tool that uses a modified version of the Pocock
minimization algorithm15 with a random component to gen-
erate balanced 1:1 randomization in the strata at any time. All
Key Points
Question Does adjunctive early hydrocortisone therapy prevent
the development of septic shock in patients with severe sepsis
who are not in shock?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 380 adults,
occurrence of septic shock was not significantly different between
patients who received hydrocortisone or placebo (21.2% vs 22.9%,
respectively).
Meaning Administration of hydrocortisone did not prevent the
development of shock in patients with severe sepsis.

patients, study personnel, sponsors, medical staff, and nurs-
ing staff were blinded regarding the allocation of study medi-
cation throughout the entire study period.
Study Medication
The study medication (hydrocortisone and placebo) was pro-
duced and released by BAG Health Care GmbH. The medica-
tion was delivered in boxes, each containing 17 brown glass vi-
als for 1 patient. Each vial contained 100 mg of lyophilized
hydrocortisone hydrogen succinate or the same amount of ly-
ophilized mannitol as placebo, which was indistinguishable
from hydrocortisone. The medication was administered as an
intravenous bolus of 50 mg, followed by a 24-hour continu-
ous infusion of 200 mg on 5 days, 100 mg on days 6 and 7,
50 mg on days 8 and 9, and 25 mg on days 10 and 11. Hydro-
cortisone dose corresponded to those used in the 2 major RCTs
performed earlier,3,4 which had shown significant effects on
septic shock resolution. A continuous infusion was preferred
to avoid possible undulation of the blood cortisol concentra-
tionsbybolusadministration,whichhadbeenreportedtocom-
plicate blood glucose control.16 A continuous infusion was also
recommended in the recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign
guidelines.2 To reduce possible hemodynamic and immuno-
logicalreboundeffects,17hydrocortisonewastaperedoversev-
eraldaysasintheCORTICUSstudy.4Studymedicationwasdis-
continued for safety reasons or when patients were discharged
from the ICU or reached the primary end point.
End Points
The primary end point was the occurrence of septic shock
within 14 days, which was assessed daily until day 14, or dis-
charge from the ICU. Secondary end points were time until
development of septic shock or death (whichever came first),
mortality in the ICU and hospital, vital status at 28, 90, and
180 days, duration of stay in the ICU and hospital, organ dys-
functions (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA]
score, ranging from 0-24 with higher values indicating
greater severity), duration of mechanical ventilation, and
renal replacement therapy. In the subgroup of patients
who underwent a corticotropin test at baseline, the occur-
rence of septic shock, mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the
ICU or hospital, mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunctions
(SOFA score), renal replacement therapy, and secondary
infection were evaluated. Critical illness–related corticoste-
roid insufficiency was defined as an increase of cortisol of
9 μg/dL or less (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by
27.588) 1 hour after stimulation with 250 μg of corticotropin
(Synacthen). Frequency of delirium was assessed daily until
ICU discharge by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale18,19
(ranging from −5 [unarousable; no response to voice or physi-
cal stimulation] to 4 [combative; overly combative or violent;
immediate danger to staff]) to quantify the level of sedation
and by the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU for
detection of delirium. Adverse events were assessed until day
28, with special emphasis on muscle weakness, weaning fail-
ure, secondary infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding. All
events not typically associated with the course of disease had
to be reported (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).
Data Acquisition, Cortisol Measurement,
and Patient Treatment
Disease severity was assessed by the SOFA score,20 Simpli-
fied Acute Physiology Score II (ranging from 0-163),21 Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (ranging from
0-71),22 and Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (ranging from
0-217) (with higher scores indicating greater severity on all
instruments).23 Serum cortisol concentration was batch ana-
lyzed by mass spectrometry in a reference laboratory in blood
samples stored at −80°C and taken before and 60 minutes af-
ter administration of 250 μg of corticotropin at baseline. All
patients had to be treated according to guidelines of the
German Sepsis Society13 (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).
Statistical Analysis
The study was planned to detect an absolute difference of 15%
in the proportion of patients with septic shock within 14 days
with a significance level of .05 and a power of 0.8. The differ-
ence of 15% was postulated to be a meaningful difference that
could change clinical practice, and was supported by similar
differences of hydrocortisone on 7-day septic shock resolu-
tion in patients with septic shock,24 assuming that hydrocor-
tisone might be as effective in preventing septic shock as in
resolving it.
Assuming 40% of patients in the placebo group had septic
shock,8,25-27 169 evaluable patients per arm were required. Ac-
counting for an expected dropout rate of about 10%, 190 pa-
tients per arm (380 in total) had to be included. The statistical
analysis was conducted consistent with the intention-to-
treat (ITT) principle. The primary end point was assessed by χ2
test; heterogeneity between centers with more than 10 re-
cruited patients was assessed by I2. Secondary end points were
analyzed by χ2 test, Fisher exact test, t test, Mann-Whitney
U test, or log-rank test, as appropriate. All reported P values are
2-sided,andP < .05wasregardedasstatisticallysignificant.Sec-
ondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing be-
cause these statistical comparisons were performed with ex-
ploratoryratherthanconfirmatoryintention.Plannedsubgroup
analyses included the ITT population and the per-protocol (PP)
population, administration of study medication for at least 48
hours, medical and surgical patients, and patients with pneu-
monia. Post hoc subgroup analyses were performed for CIRCI,
delirium,andCAP.Amultivariablelogisticregressionmodelwas
performed to investigate adjusted treatment effects. Two in-
terim analyses were performed after recruitment of one-third
and two-thirds of the planned sample size. Statistical analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc),
Rversion3.1.0(RFoundation),andSPSSversion22.0(IBMCorp)
statistical software. For details of the statistical analyses, see
eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.

from screening to enrollment was 12.5 hours (interquartile
range[IQR],6-21hours)intheplacebogroupand14hours(IQR,
6.5-23 hours) in the hydrocortisone group (P = .49). The ITT
population excluded 27 patients and included 353 patients
(64.9% male; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [14.4] years) (Figure 1). The
PP population consisted of 322 patients, and the safety analy-
sis set included 375 patients. Six patients (2 in the placebo
group, 4 in the hydrocortisone group) received a reduced dose
(<80% of total dose according to protocol). Ten patients (5 in
the placebo group, 5 in the hydrocortisone group) received an
increased dose (quotient of applied dose and expected dose
>1.2). These patients were excluded from the PP analysis.
Follow-up was conducted until February 23, 2014.

nificant difference between the groups was observed regard-
ing time to septic shock development (Figure 2), or in time to
septic shock in those patients who developed septic shock
(eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Subgroup analysis of medical or
surgical patients, patients with pneumonia, or study medica-
tion treatment for at least 48 hours did not reveal a benefit for
shockprevention(eFigure2inSupplement1).Toexcludeacen-
ter effect, 11 sites that recruited at least 10 patients (n = 279)
were analyzed; there was no heterogeneity for the primary end
point (I2 = 0%; P = .74).
Secondary End Points
There were no significant differences in 28-day, 90-day, 180-
day, ICU, or hospital all-cause mortality; LOS in the ICU or hos-
pital; ventilation- or renal replacement–free days; or median
SOFA score until day 14 between patients treated with pla-
cebo or hydrocortisone (Table 2 and eFigure 3 in Supplement
1). At 28 days, mortality occurred in 15 of 171 patients (8.8%)
in the hydrocortisone group and 14 of 170 patients (8.2%) in
the placebo group (difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.6% to 6.7%;

to 11.4%; P = .44). At 180 days, mortality occurred in 45 of 168
patients (26.8%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 37 of 167 pa-
tients (22.2%) in the placebo group (difference, 4.6%; 95% CI,
−4.6% to 13.7%; P = .32). Analysis of the PP population re-
vealed no significant differences for secondary end points be-
tween the treatment arms. A post hoc analysis of 54 patients
with CAP did not reveal significant differences for the pri-
mary or secondary end points between patients treated with
hydrocortisone (n = 24) or placebo (n = 30).
Adverse Effects
There were more episodes of hyperglycemia (blood glucose
level >150 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply
by 0.0555]) in the hydrocortisone group (169 of 186 patients
[90.9%])thanintheplacebogroup(154of189patients[81.5%])
(difference, 9.4%; 95% CI, 2.4% to 16.4%; P = .009) (Table 3).
The total amount of administered insulin was not signifi-
cantly different between the hydrocortisone and placebo
groups (safety set analysis: mean [SD], 264.6 [312.2] vs 212.2
[246.8] IU, respectively; difference, 52.4 IU; 95% CI, −21.8 to
126.7 IU; P = .17) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Two patients de-
veloped severe hypertension during hydrocortisone admin-
istration, which required antihypertensive therapy. Both pa-
tients recovered without sequelae. Secondary infections,
weaningfailure,muscleweakness,hypernatremia,orotherad-
verse events were not significantly different between treat-
ment groups (Table 3).
Critical Illness–Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency
Cortisol data from corticotropin tests were available from 206
of 353 patients (58.4%), of whom 69 (33.5%) had CIRCI. Base-
linecharacteristicswerecomparablebetweenpatientswithand
withoutCIRCI(eTable4inSupplement1).Intheplacebogroup,
septic shock occurred in 10 of 37 patients with CIRCI (27.0%)
andin9of66patientswithoutCIRCI(13.6%)(difference,13.4%;
95% CI, −2.1% to 30.5%; P = .09). In a multivariate analysis,
SOFA score (per SOFA point: odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-
1.49; P = .007) and CIRCI (odds ratio = 2.58; 95% CI, 1.13-5.91;
P = .03) at baseline, but not age or sex, were independently
prognostic for development of septic shock (eTable 5 in
Supplement1).Inthissubpopulationof206patients,therewas
no significant difference regarding the primary or secondary

ceived hydrocortisone or placebo (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).
Delirium
Delirium was assessed by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation
Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU in
286 of 353 patients (81.0%). The median number of assess-
ments per patient was 7 (IQR, 4-12) in the placebo group and
6.5 (IQR, 4-10.5) in the hydrocortisone group (difference, 1.61
assessments; 95% CI, −0.36 to 3.58 assessments; P = .21).
Twenty-six patients were excluded from analysis owing to
low Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score or incomplete
data. In the remaining 260 patients, delirium was less fre-
quent in patients who received hydrocortisone than in those
who received placebo (11 of 130 patients [8.5%] vs 25 of 130
patients [19.2%], respectively; difference, −10.8%; 95% CI,
−19.2% to −2.3%; P = .01). The results remained significant
after exclusion of another 60 patients (28 from the placebo
group, 32 from the hydrocortisone group) who were diag-
nosed by the investigator to have no delirium but had at least
1 incomplete delirium assessment or had only 1 baseline
assessment (n = 6 in the hydrocortisone group) (with
delirium occurring in 11 of 98 patients [11.2%] in the hydro-
cortisone group vs 25 of 102 patients [24.5%] in the placebo
group; difference, −13.3%; 95% CI, −23.7% to −2.6%; P = .01)
(Table 2).
Discussion
In this RCT, low-dose hydrocortisone did not prevent the evo-
lution from severe sepsis to septic shock. There were no sig-
nificant differences between treatment groups with regard to
mortality or LOS in the ICU or hospital, or mortality up to 180
days. Patients treated with hydrocortisone had a signifi-
cantlyhigherriskofdevelopinghyperglycemiaandalowerrisk
of developing delirium in a post hoc analysis.
The rationale for this study was based on the notion that
severe sepsis and septic shock reflect stages of a disease con-
tinuum with increasing mortality.28 Occurrence of septic
shock was chosen as the primary outcome variable for the
following reasons. First, hydrocortisone in septic shock
showed conflicting results in terms of mortality, but con-
sistent hemodynamic effects and faster septic shock res-
olution.6,24 Second, administration of hydrocortisone was
associated with immunomodulatory effects including
reduced inducible nitric oxide formation—a key mediator of
septic shock pathophysiology.17 Thus, it was hypothesized
that attenuation of inflammation in early severe sepsis could
prevent progression to shock. Third, this hypothesis was sup-
ported by data of Confalonieri et al8 showing that septic
shock was prevented by hydrocortisone in patients with CAP.
Fourth, because occurrence of septic shock is associated
with an increased risk of mortality,28 it was hypothesized
that prevention of septic shock leading to organ dysfunction
could also affect secondary outcome variables such as LOS
in the ICU or mortality. If prolonged administration of hydro-
cortisone was able to prevent septic shock development,
this beneficial effect of hydrocortisone could outweigh
adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, which can be readily
treated by administration of insulin. Vasopressor-dependent
(volume-resistant) septic shock in patients with sepsis is
still the key indication for suggesting hydrocortisone in the
current international guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis
Campaign.2 Hence, it seems plausible to take this as a pri-
mary end point if prevention of septic shock is tested. We
assumed a rate of septic shock of 40% in patients with severe
sepsis based on previous studies8,25-27 and data from the Sep-
Net Clinical Trials Group. However, owing to different study
populations, effect sizes, and septic shock criteria, only a
rough estimation was possible (see limitations described
later). According to recommendations of the German Sepsis
Society to transfer patients with severe sepsis to an interme-
diate care unit or ICU, only patients treated in these units
were enrolled in HYPRESS. This was different from a recent
retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis and similar
lactate values but lower hospital mortality (7.9% mortality in
the study by Liu et al29 vs 13.1% mortality in this study), who
were treated predominantly in the general ward.29
However, the current study did not show a protective ef-
fect on shock development, time to septic shock, mortality, or
LOS in the ICU or hospital. The results are in contrast to a small
study in 46 patients with severe CAP, in which hydrocorti-
soneadministrationwasassociatedwithimprovedsurvivaland
significantly lower rates of septic shock. This study was pre-
maturely stopped after an interim analysis owing to improve-
ment of oxygenation and hospital mortality.8 The presented
data did not support that hydrocortisone was more effective
with regard to the primary or secondary end points in pa-
tients with pneumonia or in the subgroup of patients with CAP.
However, recent larger RCTs of steroids in patients with CAP
did not reveal reduction of mortality but did show some ben-
eficial effects on other outcomes. In 304 non-ICU patients, a
4-day treatment with 5 mg of dexamethasone reduced me-
dian hospital LOS by 1 day.30 Another RCT enrolled 120 pa-
tients with severe CAP and a high inflammatory response who
received methylprednisolone at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg twice
daily or placebo for 5 days.10 Primary end points were para-
metersofearly(<72hours)orlate(72-120hours)treatmentfail-
ure. Treatment failure rates were lower in patients who re-
ceivedsteroidsthaninthosewhoreceivedplacebo(13%vs32%,
respectively;P = .02),withlateradiographicprogressionasthe
onlysignificantlydifferentparameter;notably,latesepticshock
was rare and less frequent in patients who received steroids
than in those who received placebo (0 vs 4 patients, respec-
tively). In the largest RCT to date, with 785 patients with CAP,
patients received either 50 mg of prednisone or placebo for 7
days.9 The primary end point was time to clinical stability for
at least 24 hours. Treatment with prednisone shortened time
to clinical stability by 1 to 4 days irrespective of severity of CAP,
and it shortened time to hospital discharge and duration of an-
tibiotic therapy by 1 day. Thus, there is some evidence that
moderate doses of steroids may be more effective in patients
with CAP than other causes of sepsis.11
Another interesting finding in this study was that despite
a higher risk of septic shock in patients with CIRCI, there was

no detectable difference in septic shock development be-
tweentreatmentgroups;however,samplesizeandeventnum-
bers were small. The results are in line with results of the
CORTICUS trial, in which effects of hydrocortisone on septic
shock resolution were independent from CIRCI. Moreover, in
a CORTICUS subgroup analysis, etomidate administration was
associated with a significantly higher risk for CIRCI and 28-
day mortality. However, hydrocortisone treatment did not re-
ducemortalityinpatientswithCIRCIwhoreceivedetomidate.31
Whether combined biomarkers may be more suitable to de-
tect eligible patients needs further investigation. A subgroup
analysis of patients with CAP showed most effects in patients
who had low basal cortisol levels combined with high proin-
flammatory cytokine profiles.32
The results from this study do not support an increased
risk for secondary infections. Reasonable concerns were am-
plified by results of the CORTICUS trial, which showed higher
numbersofsecondaryinfectionsincludingnewsepsisandsep-
tic shock in patients who received hydrocortisone.4 A Bayesian
analysis, mainly based on CORTICUS results, of patients with
septic shock reported an increased risk of infections.33 How-
ever, other studies in patients with septic shock,3 acute respi-
ratory distress syndrome,34 trauma,35 or CAP8-10,30 and a
meta-analysis7 did not report any increased risk.
An unexpected finding was that delirium developed less
frequentlyinpatientstreatedwithhydrocortisone.Indeed,sev-
eralobservationalstudiesreportedanassociationbetweenhigh
serum cortisol concentration and delirium after noncardiac36
andcardiac 37surgeryandseveresepsisorsepticshock.38There
is compelling evidence that systemic inflammation plays an
important role in the pathogenesis of delirium, but it remains
controversial whether high cortisol concentration mirrors an
activation of the stress response to cope with inflammation,
or whether delirium is caused by high cortisol concentration.
A prospective cohort study in 330 mechanically ventilated pa-
tients with acute lung injury reported a significant dose-
independent association between systemic corticosteroid ad-
ministration and development of delirium.39 However, in an
RCT with 737 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who re-
ceived dexamethasone, 1 mg/kg, or placebo at anesthesia in-
duction did not reveal a significant difference of postopera-
tive delirium between treatment groups.40 Thus, the results
question the concept of cortisol-induced delirium in critical
illness and provide some evidence of protective effects of pro-
longed administration of low-dose hydrocortisone in early se-
vere sepsis.
There are limitations of the study to be addressed. First,
inclusion in the trial was possible only after informed con-
sent could be obtained, so that patients who developed sep-
tic shock early may have been missed. Second, data from cor-
ticotropin tests were available in a subgroup of 206 patients
only, because adrenal function assessment was not an abso-
lute inclusion criterion and therefore was not performed at all
study sites or in all patients at a single site. Analyses of CIRCI
were post hoc and should be regarded as hypothesis generat-
ing only. Third, mortality in the study population was more
comparable to the mortality reported in recent studies with
CAP9,10,30 than to the mortality (approximately 30%) re-
ported in the study by Confalonieri et al8; thus, it cannot be
excluded that hydrocortisone would have been more effec-
tive in patients with a higher risk of death. Fourth, data on de-
liriumshouldbeinterpretedwithcautionbecausepatientshad
to be excluded owing to incomplete data sets, only 1 daily as-
sessment was performed in most patients, and interrater re-
liability was not assessed. Analyses were performed post hoc
and results should therefore be regarded as hypothesis gen-
erating. Fifth, secondary analyses were not adjusted for mul-
tiple testing, as these statistical comparisons were performed
with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention. Adjust-
ment for clustering within site was not performed because site
was a stratification factor for randomization. Sixth, the ob-
served rate of septic shock in the placebo group (23%; 95% CI,
17%-30%) was lower than originally presumed for sample size
calculation (40%). The point estimate of the difference of sep-
tic shock occurrences was −1.8% (ie, close to 0) with a 95% CI
of −10.7% to 7.2%. Hence, the trial gives no indication of a clini-
callyrelevantmajorbenefitofhydrocortisonetreatment,which
it was designed to detect.

Among adults with severe sepsis not in septic shock, the use
of hydrocortisone compared with placebo did not reduce the
risk of septic shock within 14 days. These findings do not sup-
port the use of hydrocortisone in these patients.
