Lateral movements of a massive 
tail influence gecko locomotion: an 
integrative study comparing tail 
restriction and autotomy
Kevin Jagnandan

Tails are an intricate component of the locomotor system for many vertebrates. Leopard geckos 
(Eublepharis macularius) possess a large tail that is laterally undulated during steady locomotion. 
However, the tail is readily shed via autotomy, resulting in the loss of tail function, loss in body mass, 
and a cranial shift in the center of mass. To elucidate the function of tail undulations, we investigated 
changes in limb kinematics after manipulating the tail artificially by restricting tail undulations 
and naturally by removing the tail via autotomy. Restricting tail undulations resulted in kinematic 
adjustments similar to those that occur following tail autotomy, characterized by more flexed hind 
limb joints. These data suggest that effects of autotomy on locomotion may be linked to the loss of tail 
movements rather than the loss of mass or a shift in center of mass. We also provide empirical support 
for the link between lateral tail undulations and step length through the rotation of the pelvic girdle and 
retraction of the femur. Restriction and autotomy of the tail limits pelvic rotation, which reduces femur 
retraction and decreases step length. Our findings demonstrate a functional role for tail undulations in 
geckos, which likely applies to other terrestrial vertebrates.
A defining feature of chordates is the post-anal tail, which has evolved many key functions across taxa1. These 
include courtship2, signaling3, 4, the maintenance of fat stores5, 6, and defense/combat7, 8. Tails also have functional 
roles in animal locomotion, most notably when used directly for propulsion, as in countless swimming animals9, 10  
and when used to power pentapedal locomotion in kangaroos11. Perhaps less obvious is the tail’s role in main-
taining balance and enhancing maneuverability or stability12–16. Although prehensile tails serve as an extra limb 
to reduce the risk of falling in arboreal environments17, 18, several taxa utilize non-prehensile tails for a similar 
advantage. Mice have been documented undulating the tail for balance when crossing a narrow perch19. Primates 
with long tails utilize sweeping movements of the tail when navigating narrow supports to alter the momentum 
of their body20, and cats utilize tail adjustments to realign their hips over a perch to avoid falling21. Even on broad 
level terrain, tails can adjust the balance of the body to counteract pitching effects of leg movements22, and tails 
have been shown to be useful for initiating turns and maneuvering23.
Lizards are ideal for studying tail function because all of the functions described above are represented within 
their tremendous diversity. The tail can be dragged behind the lizard, pushed against the substrate during climb-
ing, raised, curled, used as a prehensile “fifth limb”
, used for counter-rotation during jumping, or undulated as 
they walk, run, and/or climb8, 24–26. Despite the importance of the tail in various forms of locomotion15, 27–31, most 
lizard species voluntarily shed the tail (autotomy) as a predator-escape strategy8, 32. How tail autotomy impacts 
locomotion has thus become a topic of much interest in recent years15, 33–35. Performance effects are variable 
across species, likely due to differences in the role of the tail in locomotion25. Species for which locomotor perfor-
mance is improved after autotomy generally have large fatty tails that impede faster running36, while locomotion 
is impaired by tail loss in species that depend on the tail for balance, stability, and/or maneuverability29, 30.
In some species, autotomy does not influence performance, but significant changes in locomotor mechan-
ics occur. Changes in locomotor kinematics and hind limb ground-reaction forces were recently investigated 
in the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius37, a padless desert-dwelling species and an established system for

tail autotomy and regeneration38–42. Geckos lower their center of mass by taking a more sprawled posture after 
autotomy, a change that was attributed to a reduction in stability due to the significant loss of caudal mass and 
cranial shift of the center of mass (E. macularius have one of the largest tails relative to body size among lizards)37. 
However, it is unclear if stability is impaired by the change in mass or the loss of tail function. The tail of E. mac-
ularius serves a primary role in the storage of fats41, but unlike many other large-tailed reptiles, the tail is not 
dragged behind the animal as it walks. Instead, the tail is lifted off the ground and swings laterally. Undulations of 
the vertebral column generate a standing wave in the trunk that transforms into a traveling wave moving caudally 
along the tail as the lizard walks43.
The function of lateral undulations of the tail during locomotion remains unclear, although several hypotheses 
have been presented. Tail movements in arboreal mammals are suggested to aid in balance and stability when 
traversing narrow perches19–21. Recent data on green anoles demonstrate that mediolateral tail movements are 
most prominent on the narrowest perches and compensate for instabilities imposed by a small perch diameter15. 
Undulating the tail during otherwise steady locomotion may also be a useful mechanism for rapidly respond-
ing to unexpected perturbations by imparting angular momentum on the body and resisting the destabilizing 
motion20, 21, 31, 44. The tail may also play a role in force generation by the caudofemoralis, the muscle that retracts 
the femur28, 45–50. Undulating the tail could alternately lengthen the caudofemoralis muscles attached to each hind 
limb as the tail is swung from side to side. Lengthening the muscle to a more optimal length would lead to greater 
actin-myosin overlap within the muscle sarcomere, which could thus enhance the force generated for propulsion 
by the caudofemoralis. Tail undulations could also contribute to rotation at the pelvic girdle due to inertial effects. 
A large undulating tail could provide the momentum necessary for rotating the pelvic girdle in the yaw axis, 
which could influence both the length of a hind limb step as well as the angle at which the femur can retract to 
drive propulsion.
For both axial and appendicular structures that move during locomotion, function can be revealed by either 
removing all or some of the structure37, 51, by adding to the structure12, 52, or by restricting motion of the struc-
ture53, 54. Although the voluntary loss of the tail has been studied, little is known about the differential role of mass 
versus motion of the tail during locomotion. We examined how the tail is used in leopard geckos walking on level 
terrain and determined how these tail movements change with speed. We then disabled normal tail movements, 
both artificially by restricting tail undulations with a graphite rod and naturally by autotomizing the tail in the 
same individuals (Fig. 1). We hypothesized that restricting the motions of the tail will cause changes in locomo-
tion that are comparable to those that occur following tail autotomy37. Thus, we predicted that autotomy-induced 
changes in locomotion result from the loss of tail undulations, not a loss of mass. We specifically investigated 
changes in limb joint angles that may augment balance or stability, as well as changes in the rotation of the pelvic 
girdle when an undulating tail is compromised.
Results
In running trials, geckos ran at speeds ranging from 0.59 to 3.36 SVL s−
1, which was not significantly affected by 
restricting or autotomizing the tail (repeated measures ANOVA, F2,8 = 4.075, P = 0.060). Lateral displacement of 
the tip of the tail relative to the pelvic girdle exhibited a significant negative relationship with speed (F1,8 = 5.870, 
P = 0.042, R2 = 0.423) (Fig. 2), although no relationship was observed between the height of the tail and speed 
(F1,8 = 0.100, P = 0.759, R2 = 0.012). Restricting the tail reduced the lateral displacement of the tail as intended 
(t = 3.112, d.f. = 9, P = 0.012) and did not affect the tail height off the ground (t = 0.734. d.f. = 9, P = 0.482).
Stride lengths, stance times, and duty factors of the fore- and hind limbs were not significantly impacted by 
restricting or autotomizing the tail (Table 1). Forelimb joint kinematics were also unaffected. However, step length 
(the distance traveled during the stance phase of the hind limb) was significantly reduced by restricting (t = 3.509, 
d.f. = 9, P = 0.007) and autotomizing (t = 3.447, d.f. = 9, P = 0.007) the tail. Both restricting and autotomizing 
the tail also significantly decreased the maximum angles of femur depression (restriction, t = 6.225, d.f. = 9, 
P < 0.000; autotomy, t = 7.869, d.f. = 9, P < 0.000), femur retraction (restriction, t = 2.94, d.f. = 9, P = 0.016; auto-
tomy, t = 3.305, d.f. = 9, P = 0.009), knee flexion (restriction, t = 4.541, d.f. = 9, P = 0.001; autotomy, t = 4.627,

the lateral distance of the tail tip relative to the pelvic girdle, as measured on the left side of the body. Data points 
are means for each individual. Error bars are s.e.m. Regression analysis demonstrates a significant negative 
relationship of lateral displacement of the tail tip with speed when the tail is unaltered (P = 0.042). Lateral 
displacement of the tail is significantly reduced when the tail is restricted, with no relationship to speed.

reduced after tail restriction (femur depression, t = 3.069, d.f. = 9, P = 0.013; femur retraction, t = 3.527, d.f. = 9,

Discussion
Tail autotomy in lizards can result in a significant loss of body mass, a cranial shift in the center of mass, and a loss 
of function that results from tail motion. While the loss of mass and shifted center of mass occur simultaneously 
and cannot be decoupled, we investigated the functional role of the tail by experimentally restricting its lateral 
movement. Analysis of locomotor kinematics of E. macularius under experimental conditions in which the tail 
was compromised revealed the function of tail motions when walking and their relationship to pelvic rotation and 
step length. Specifically, we observed a more sprawled posture when lateral undulations of the tail were restricted 
and when the tail was completely autotomized, suggesting that geckos must compensate for not only the loss of 
caudal mass, but also for the loss of tail motion after an autotomy event. Additionally, restricting tail undulations 
reduced the lateral rotation of the pelvic girdle, retraction of the femur, and step length, thereby providing evi-
dence for a significant role of the tail in gecko locomotion. These results, elaborated below, reveal key functions 
of tails during locomotion that are likely applicable to any terrestrial vertebrate that relies on tail motion to move 
effectively.
Despite having a large fatty tail that accounts for one-fourth of the animal’s body mass, the tail of E. macularius 
is slightly raised and laterally undulated instead of being dragged on the ground while walking. As the base of 
the tail moves laterally, the femora are alternately retracted to generate propulsion. The base of the tail is flexed 
towards the protracted hind limb during each cycle of hind limb movement, and the remainder of the tail follows 
this basal movement in an undulatory manner. Interestingly, we found that lateral displacement of the tip of an 
intact tail exhibits a negative relationship with the speed at which the gecko walks (Fig. 2), suggesting that the 
tail swings less at higher speeds. This more rigid posture of the tail straightens the profile of the lizard, and is sug-
gested to be appropriate when lizards are moving forward quickly12. It is likely that laterally undulating the tail is 
inefficient at higher speeds given its substantial mass. Accelerating and decelerating the large tail when moving 
at high speeds would require more force and power due to the reduced amount of time available for swinging the 
tail from side to side, which might simply not be possible for the geckos.
After losing its tail, E. macularius adopts a more sprawled posture during locomotion, as previously indicated 
by decreases in femur depression, femur retraction, knee angle and ankle angle37. This locomotor response to 
autotomy is hypothesized to augment stability and balance that may be impaired due to the altered mass distribu-
tion and/or the loss of tail as a stabilizing appendage. Restricting the tail allowed us to tease apart the locomotor 
effects of autotomy due to altering mass/center of mass versus losing tail function. By effectively modifying the 
tail into a stiff rod, the gecko was permitted to lift the tail off the ground to prevent friction, but prevented from 
swinging and laterally undulating the tail as it walked. This modification produced the same locomotor response 
as autotomizing the tail (Fig. 5). Both removing and restricting the tail can impact the location of the center of 
mass, with removal shifting the center of mass forward37, 55 and restriction limiting lateral displacements of the 
center of mass15, 28. Forelimb kinematics were unaffected by restriction and autotomy, but maximum joint angles 
and angular excursions in the hind limbs decreased (Fig. 3). These results suggest that tail undulations have a 
functional role in locomotion on level terrain, a role that is lost after autotomy and requires compensation by 
altering hind limb kinematics. In fact, it is likely that the impacts of autotomy on locomotion are a result of losing 
potentially beneficial tail movements, and not necessarily related to the loss of mass.
The function of tail undulations during steady locomotion is more clearly elucidated by the observed changes 
in pelvic rotation and its downstream effects on femur retraction and step length. Both restricting and autotomiz-
ing the tail reduced the degree of rotation of the pelvic girdle throughout the stride (Fig. 4). We hypothesize that 
swinging the heavy tail laterally provides momentum for rotation at the pelvic girdle via an inertial effect. As the 
base of the tail is rotated laterally, the length of the tail follows this movement in an undulatory manner. Given the 
substantial mass of the tail being shifted at the caudal end, the angular momentum of the tail contributes to rotat-
ing the pelvic girdle in the yaw axis. Lizards generally exhibit greater pelvic rotation in order to facilitate a more 
sprawled posture compared to most other terrestrial quadrupeds56–59. Thus, a reduction in pelvic rotation should 
be expected to generate a more upright posture. This is in stark contrast to what is observed after tail autotomy, in 
which lizards become more sprawled to maintain stability37. Decreased pelvic rotation after autotomy thus results 
in a reduced step length during steady locomotion to maintain the sprawled posture. Although walking speed

was not affected by the observed reduction in step length, we suspect that maximal sprint speed would likely be 
negatively impacted. We did not assess this in our study as we were mainly interested in the impact of tail autot-
omy and immobilization on kinematics. Additionally, pelvic rotation influences the angle at which the femur can 
protract and retract28, 49, 50. The reduction in the angle of femur retraction observed in lizards with restricted and 
autotomized tails (Table 1) coincides with the reduction in pelvic rotation. Our data provide empirical support for 
the proposed link between lateral tail undulations and step length by rotation of the pelvic girdle and retraction 
of the femur60. Autotomy is therefore likely to impact lizards that have a functional tail that provides momentum 
for rotating the pelvic girdle.
Our findings demonstrate that the tail serves a functional role in locomotion by undulating and rotating the 
pelvic girdle, thus contributing to femur retraction and step length. To further reveal the locomotor function of 
tail undulations in terrestrial lizards, we propose a series of future experiments that will elucidate how the tail is 
used and how animals compensate for the lost appendage. First, the effects of tail loss on dynamic stability and 
maneuverability should be tested by examining if/how lizards utilize the tail to navigate obstacles, drops, and 
turns. Experiments that record the timing and intensity of muscle activation in the tail will reveal whether these 
movements are passively or actively controlled, providing important insight into how tail undulations are modu-
lated. Passive control may suggest that undulating the tail occurs by simply dissipating energy from the laterally 
undulating body during locomotion, while active control would suggest neuromuscular input that may be neces-
sary for regulating balance or stability. Electromyography experiments would also be insightful when testing how 
the tail undulations affect the activation of the caudofemoralis and its role in retracting the femur45, 46. Finally, we 
hope to explore the evolution of tail function by using these methods to explore the diversity of tail morphologies 
and their related locomotor functions across lizard taxa.
Tail autotomy in lizards provides an effective and natural system for understanding tail function. Hypothesized 
functions of tails commonly arise from studies on tail autotomy and locomotion. A negative impact of tail loss 
on performance suggests that the tail serves a role in balance, stability, maneuverability, or propulsion29, 30, 61. 
Other attempts at assessing tail use in locomotion involve invasive surgeries with irreparable effects on the study 
animals19, 21, 27. However, tail autotomy allows for a removal of the tail in a natural manner with minimal physio-
logical effects62 in order to study its function.
Materials and Methods
Study organisms. 
Ten adult E. macularius (mass, 36.3 ± 1.9 g; SVL, 104.6 ± 2.1 mm) with original tails intact 
were obtained from commercial suppliers and housed in terraria (50.8 ×
 25.9 ×
 2.0 cm) maintained at 28–33 °C. 
Geckos were fed a diet of live crickets ad libitum, but fasted the day before the experiment until trials were com-
plete. Prior to experimental trials, white nail polish was applied to the following points on the animals to visualize 
body and joint movements in high-speed videos: dorsal midpoint of the body, center of the pectoral/pelvic gir-
dles, shoulder/hip, elbow/knee, wrist/ankle, and the metapodial-phalangeal joint of the middle toe. Joints were 
marked on the right forelimbs and hind limbs. Five points were also evenly distributed from the base of the tail 
to the tail tip to track the tail movements. All animal research was conducted in accordance with the University 
of California, Riverside Animal Care and Use Protocols (A-20110025 and A-20110038) with approval from the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

 0.13 m) with sandpaper substrate to prevent slipping. A mirror mounted at 45° above the trackway provided 
a dorsal view for the trials. The temperature of the experimental room was maintained at ~30 °C. Lizards were 
recorded moving along the trackway under three tail treatments: original, restricted, and autotomized (Fig. 1). 
After recording trials with a lizard’s original tail intact, a lightweight (<1.0 g) hollow graphite rod was attached 
along the entire length of the tail using non-toxic glue. The rod restricted undulations of the tail, while still per-
mitting the lizard to lift its tail off the ground to prevent friction drag while walking. Locomotor trials were then 
repeated with the restricted tail. Following these trials, the rod was gently removed from the tail, and the base of 
the tail was gently pinched to initiate autotomy at the proximal-most fracture plane. Trials were then repeated for 
lizards with autotomized tails. Between trials for each treatment, each individual was allotted 20–30 minutes to 
rest in order to minimize potential effects of fatigue or stress associated with the restriction and removal of the 
tail62. However, we limited the amount of walking between trials to avoid any short-term adjustments.
Stride kinematics. 
Locomotor movements were captured at 250 frames s−
1 with a shutter speed of 1/2000 
s using two Photron APX-RS cameras (Photron USA, San Diego, CA, USA), one aimed at the lateral view of the 
lizard and the other recording a dorsal view from the mirror. Cameras were synchronized with an external trigger. 
A pre-measured calibration object constructed of LEGO™ blocks was used to generate 3D coordinates for digi-
tizing. Three to five forelimb and hind limb strides were recorded for each individual under each tail treatment, 
providing a total of at least nine strides per individual. Each stride was representative of an individual moving 
at a relatively constant speed, at least two strides after the initial acceleration. We digitized the points marked on 
the animals using DLT DV5 custom software63 for MATLAB (version R2012a, The MathWorks, Natick, MA, 
USA) to obtain x, y, and z coordinates to describe antero-posterior, medio-lateral, and dorso-ventral movements, 
respectively. These coordinates were then used to calculate speed, stride length, stance time, duty factor, and joint 
angles for the fore- and hind limb throughout each stride. Details of these calculations are available elsewhere37, 64. 
Tail coordinates were used to calculate the height of the tail off the ground and lateral displacement of the tail 
(measured as the lateral displacement of the tail tip relative to the pelvic girdle) throughout each stride. Only the 
movements of the tail in the yaw axis were considered here.

Statistical analyses. 
Averages of each kinematic variable for each individual per tail treatment were used 
for all statistical analyses. For the tail variables (tail height and lateral displacement), a regression analysis was 
used to examine the relationship between tail movements and walking speed. The effects of speed on fore- and 
hind limb joint kinematics were removed by regressing the variables against body speed. Residuals of the varia-
bles that had a significant relationship (α
 ≤
 0.10) with speed were used for subsequent statistical analyses, while 
all other data were analyzed in their original form. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare each var-
iable between original, restricted, and autotomized tail treatments, and post hoc tests with Bonferroni corrections 
were used for pair-wise comparisons among the treatments. Assumptions for normality and equal variances were 
not violated for any of the variables measured. All statistical analyses were performed using SYSTAT 13.00.05.
