Abstract
Background. Prodrug-activator gene therapy with Toca 511, a tumor-selective retroviral replicating vec-
tor (RRV) encoding yeast cytosine deaminase, is being evaluated in recurrent high-grade glioma patients. 
Nonlytic retroviral infection leads to permanent integration of RRV into the cancer cell genome, converting 
infected cancer cell and progeny into stable vector producer cells, enabling ongoing transduction and viral 
persistence within tumors. Cytosine deaminase in infected tumor cells converts the antifungal prodrug 5-flu-
orocytosine into the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil, mediating local tumor destruction without significant 
systemic adverse effects.
Methods. Here we investigated mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of this approach in orthotopic 
brain tumor models, employing both human glioma xenografts in immunodeficient hosts and syngeneic murine 
gliomas in immunocompetent hosts.
Results. In both models, a single injection of replicating vector followed by prodrug administration achieved 
long-term survival benefit. In the immunodeficient model, tumors recurred repeatedly, but bioluminescence 
imaging of tumors enabled tailored scheduling of multicycle prodrug administration, continued control of dis-
ease burden, and long-term survival. In the immunocompetent model, complete loss of tumor signal was 
observed after only 1–2 cycles of prodrug, followed by long-term survival without recurrence for >300 days 
despite discontinuation of prodrug. Long-term survivors rejected challenge with uninfected glioma cells, indi-
cating immunological responses against native tumor antigens, and immune cell depletion showed a critical 
role for CD4+ 
T cells.

Hiraoka et al. Toca 511 gene therapy induces antitumor immunity
Neuro-
Oncology
Unique among replicating viruses being developed as 
anticancer agents, retroviral replicating vectors (RRVs) 
maintain viral persistence in tumors through the combined 
characteristics of nonlytic replication, stable integration 
into the cancer cell genome, and reduced viral immuno-
genicity.1–3 RRVs lack signals for active uptake into nuclei 
in quiescent cells and integrate into the host genome only 
when the nuclear membrane dissolves during mitosis4; 
they are highly restricted in normal tissues by innate and 
adaptive immune mechanisms, which are generally inac-
tive in tumors.5,6 In pre-established intracranial glioma 
models, tumor-selective viral replication enables RRVs to 
achieve up to >98% transduction throughout entire tumor 
masses within a few weeks after injection at multiplicities 
of infection (MOI; ie, virus to glioma cell ratios) as low as 
0.01.7–12 In contrast, tumor transduction levels were ≤1% 
after injecting the same dose of conventional nonreplicat-
ing retroviral vectors.7
,13
While not intrinsically cytolytic, RRVs can be engi-
neered with a prodrug-activator gene such as yeast 
cytosine deaminase (yCD), which generates 5-fluoroura-
cil (5-FU) directly within cancer cells from its precursor 
5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), an antifungal agent approved 
for clinical use and commonly used to treat CNS fungus 
infections.7
,8 For clinical use, we developed a new RRV 
construct, Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec), con-
taining genome-stabilizing modifications in the virus 
backbone and a codon-optimized/temperature-stabi-
lized yCD transgene.14 Toca 511 and Toca FC (extended 
release formulation of 5-FC) have been evaluated in 
first-in-human clinical trials of RRV-mediated prodrug-
activator gene therapy in patients with recurrent high-
grade glioma, with the vector administered via different 
routes of administration (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01156584, 
NCT01470794, NCT01985256). To date, the treatment has 
been well tolerated and shows promising signs of clinical 
benefit, radiological responses, and increased survival 
compared with historical controls,15–17 and an interna-
tional phase IIB/III randomized trial in recurrent high-
grade glioma is now under way (NCT02414165).
In the present study, we further investigated mechanisms 
underlying the therapeutic efficacy of 
Toca 511 followed by 
5-FC (Toca 511 
+ 
5-FC) in intracranial xenograft models of 
human glioma and syngeneic models of murine glioma. 
Previous studies in immunodeficient models had indi-
cated that long-term tumor control could be achieved but 
was dependent upon continued administration of prodrug 
using a cyclic dosing schedule.7
,8 In contrast, prodrug could 
be discontinued after a few cycles without further recur-
rence in immunocompetent syngeneic models.9 However, 
the equivalence of these models in terms of virus repli-
cation kinetics and transduction efficiency had not been 
established, and the specific role of the immune system in 
contributing to therapeutic efficacy has not been evaluated 
to date. As noted, RRV itself is not highly immunogenic, 
and in fact is capable of suppressing interferon signaling.3 
Hence, to date, it has not been clear whether RRV could 
activate antitumor immune responses.
Our present results now definitively demonstrate that 
the therapeutic efficacy of direct tumor cell killing after 
Toca 511 
+ 
5-FC treatment, as demonstrated in the immu-
nodeficient tumor model, is significantly augmented by 
induction of anticancer immunity in the immunocom-
petent tumor model. In the accompanying manuscript 
(Mitchell et al), we further investigate the mechanisms by 
which antitumor immune responses are generated. Taken 
Importance of the study
Prodrug-activator gene therapy with an RRV, Toca 
511, has shown promising evidence of clinical ben-
efit, radiographic responses, and increased survival 
in multicenter first-in-human phase I dose-escalation 
trials for recurrent high-grade glioma, and a phase 
IIB/III registrational trial is now under way. This study 
improves our understanding of mechanisms of action 
underlying the therapeutic efficacy of this approach, 
by demonstrating through real-time optical imag-
ing that persistent infection by Toca 511 achieves 
long-term disease control through repeated cycles of 
prodrug-activated tumor mass reduction after a sin-
gle virus injection in immunodeficient human glioma 
models. Furthermore, despite the low intrinsic immu-
nogenicity of RRV, we definitively demonstrate for the 
first time that long-term cellular antitumor immunity 
develops after Toca 511–mediated prodrug-activator 
gene therapy in immunocompetent syngeneic glioma 
models. Together with its companion paper (Mitchell 
et al), this study provides an important conceptual 
foundation for developing further immunotherapeutic 
strategies with RRV.
Conclusion. These results support dual mechanisms of action contributing to the efficacy of RRV-mediated 
prodrug-activator gene therapy: long-term tumor control by prodrug conversion-mediated cytoreduction, 
and induction of antitumor immunity.

together, our results indicate that repeated cycles of intra-
tumoral prodrug conversion by RRV not only achieves 
long-term disease control but, through local “bystander 
effects” on immunosuppressive tumor stroma, also per-
mits development of durable cellular immune responses 
directed against endogenous tumor antigens, contributing 
to apparent complete eradication of residual disease.
Materials and Methods
Please see the Supplementary material for additional 
details.
Cell Culture
The human glioma cell line U-87MG (American Type 
Culture Collection) and the mouse glioma cell line 
Tu-2449 
were cultured as previously described.8–11,18
Viral Vector Plasmids
Plasmids encoding RRV (pAC3-GFP
, pAC3-yCD2 [Toca 511]; 
Fig. 1A) and lentiviral vector pRRL
-sin-cPPT
-hCMV-FLuc2 
have been described previously.14,19
Replication Kinetics of RRV In Vitro
AC3-GFP or Toca 511 was used for infection of U-87 or 
Tu-2449 cells at MOI of 0.005 with Polybrene (Sigma). At 
serial time points, viral copy number was determined by 
genomic quantitative (q)PCR. As nonreplicating controls, 
50 µmol 3ʹ-azide-3ʹ-deoxythymidine (AZT) was added to 
the culture medium to prevent virus spread.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis
Quantitative analysis of RRV copy number in the infected 
cells was performed as described previously19 (see also the 
Supplementary material).
Cytotoxicity Assay In Vitro
To assess drug cytotoxicity, cell viability was determined 
 
using 
3-(4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-
phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium 
(MTS) 
assay 
(Promega) in triplicate 96-well plates cultured with various 
concentrations of 5-FC. Cytotoxicity was determined by 
calculation of the absorbance of viable cells as measured 
against wells without 5-FC on day 9.
Prodrug-Activator Gene Therapy in Intracranial 
Tumor Models
All animal protocols and experiments were approved 
by the UCLA or Explora institutional animal care and 
use committees. Six- to 8-week-old female nude mice 
(Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo) or B6C3F1/J mice 
(Jackson Laboratory) were bred and maintained under 
specific pathogen-free conditions. To establish intrac-
ranial gliomas, U-87 (1 × 105) or Tu-2449 (1 × 104) cells 
were stereotactically injected into the right frontal lobe 
in mice, as described previously.8 In U-87 tumor models, 
Toca 511 (low dose: 3.4 × 104 transducing units [TU] or 
high dose: 2 × 106 
TU) was given by stereotactic injection 
on day 5, and daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration 
of 5-FC (500 mg/kg once daily or twice daily) or phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS) was started on day 18 for 7

0. Infected cells were analyzed for integrated viral copy number 
by genomic qPCR every third day after virus infection. (C) MTS 
assay to assess 5-FC drug cytotoxicity. U-87 and Tu-2449 were

viability was measured by MTS dye conversion after exposure 
to 5-FC at the indicated concentrations, and normalized to non-
treated cells. Note: “No vector” almost completely coincides 
with “AC3-GFP” for both cell lines.

consecutive days. This 7-day cycle was repeated at inter-
vals of every 1–2 weeks. In Tu-2449 tumor model studies 
conducted at UCLA, Toca 511 (2 × 106 TU) was given by 
stereotactic injection on day 4, and daily i.p. administra-
tion of 5-FC or PBS was started on day 10 for 7 consecu-
tive days. This cycle was repeated at intervals of every 
10 days. In independent Tu-2449 studies conducted at 
Tocagen, Toca 511 was administered as above at 3 × 106 
TU followed by 4 cycles of 5-FC administered twice a day 
for 4 days every 2 weeks, or at a lower dose (1.6 × 104 
TU), 
and continuous 5-FC administered once a day for 14 or 21 
consecutive days.
Optical Imaging Analysis
Bioluminescent signals were analyzed 5 min after adminis-
tration of D-luciferin (126 mg/kg, i.p.) in anesthetized mice, 
with a 1 min acquisition time on a charge-coupled camera 
system (IVIS Lumina II, Caliper Life Sciences) with Living 
Image software.
Tumor Rechallenge and Immunological Assays
Tumor rechallenge was performed on all cured mice from 
intracranial Tu-2449 tumor long-term survival studies, 
by subcutaneous inoculation with uninfected Tu-2449SC 
cells on day 0 (= days 105, 182, and 303 after initial tumor 
establishment, respectively) at low (1 × 105) or high (2 × 
106) cell doses, and tumor growth was measured twice a 
week.
For enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) 
assay, purified splenocytes were stimulated with anti-
CD3 and recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL
-2) (100 
U/mL) and plated in the Mouse IFN-γ [interferon gamma] 
ELISPOT Kit (1 × 104 cells/well; BD Bioscience) and the 
number of IFN-γ–producing cells counted with an ELISPOT 
plate reader (CTL Laboratories) at the Immuno/BioSpot 
and Cytometrics Core, UCLA.
Lymphocyte subset depletions were performed by i.p. 
injection of 50 µg anti-CD4 (GK1.5) or anti-CD8 (2.43), or 
25 µg anti-NK1.1 (PK136) antibodies (Bio X Cell) on days 
−1, 1, 3, and then twice a week, in previously cured ani-
mals. Depletion was verified by immunophenotyping sple-
nocytes from one animal from each group on days −1 and 
8 before and after rechallenge.
xCELLigence Analysis
Cytotoxicity of stimulated versus unstimulated spleno-
cytes, from previously cured mice or naïve B6C3F1/J mice, 
respectively, against Tu-2449SC cells was determined by 
xCELLigence analysis (ACEA Biosciences) (see also the 
Supplementary material). For an immune boost, previ-
ously cured mice were subcutaneously rechallenged with 
Tu-2449SC cells on day 0. On day 8, harvested splenocytes 
from immune-boosted cured mice were cultured without 
rhIL
-2 overnight, then plated in triplicate with target cells 
on E-Plate 96 at several effector-to-target ratios. Up to 400 
sweeps were run at 2-min intervals until data collection 
24 h later.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test 
and 1-way or 2-way ANOVA. Survival data were analyzed 
according to the Kaplan–Meier method. P-values of <.05 
were considered statistically significant in all analyses, 
performed with GraphPad Prism 5 software.
Results
RRVs Mediate Efficient Delivery and Functional 
Expression of Yeast Cytosine Deaminase 
Transgene in Glioma Cells
In preliminary studies, AC3-GFP
, an RRV expressing the 
green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene (Fig. 1A), 
was used to evaluate the equivalence of RRV replica-
tion and gene transfer efficiency in vitro in both human 
U-87 and murine Tu-2449 glioma cells. In both cell 
lines, RRV transduction levels increased from 0.5% to 
>90% within 5–10 days in vitro, and stably maintained 
1–2 integrated vector copies per cell (Supplementary 
Fig. S1).
We employed 
Toca 511 (AC3-yCD2),14 a vector designed 
for clinical use which expresses an improved yCD2 prod-
rug-activator gene (Fig. 1A). To evaluate possible differ-
ences in replication kinetics between AC3-GFP and Toca 
511, we also analyzed the integrated vector copy number 
by genomic qPCR analysis of cells initially infected with 
Toca 511 at an MOI of 0.005, using primers targeting the 
amphotropic envelope gene, at serial time points after 
infection in the presence or absence of AZT in vitro. In 
both U-87 and Tu-2449 glioma cells, the time course of 
changes in Toca 511 vector copy numbers was similar 
to that of AC3-GFP
, showing an initial rapid increase fol-
lowed by gradual decrease to a plateau level (Fig. 1B). 
In U-87 human glioma cells, the vector copy number 
increased rapidly to reach >10 copies/cell by day 6, fol-
lowed by gradual decrease to plateau at ~2 copies/cell 
within 15 days. In Tu-2449 murine glioma cells, the viral 
copy number increased rapidly to reach >4 copies/cell 
within 9 days, followed by a gradual decrease to plateau 
at ~3 copies/cell within 15 days.
As the CD enzyme converts the well-tolerated prodrug 
5-FC into the antimetabolite 5-FU intracellularly within 
infected cancer cells, in vitro cytotoxicity was examined 
after exposure of fully transduced glioma cells to 5-FC at 
various concentrations (Fig. 1C). Control U-87 cells trans-
duced with AC3-GFP or no vector showed no loss of viabil-
ity at concentrations of 5-FC up to 10 mM 5-FC treatment. 
In contrast, the viability of Toca 511 transduced cells was 
reduced to below 40% even after exposure to only 0.1 mM 
5-FC, and complete cell killing was observed after 9 days of 
exposure to 10 mM 5-FC. Similar results were obtained in 
Tu-2449 cells transduced with the Toca 511 vector. Control 
Tu-2449 cells showed no loss of viability up to concentra-
tions of 1 mM, whereas the viability of 
Toca 511 transduced 
cells was reduced over 70% even after exposure to only 
0.01 mM of 5-FC, and 95% cell killing was achieved at 
1 mM 5-FC.

Toca 511 and Cyclic 5-FC Achieve Long-Term 
Survival in Intracranial Glioma Models
We previously showed in the intracranial U-87 xenograft 
model in athymic mice that a single dose of a preclinical 
prototype RRV expressing the CD prodrug-activator gene 
followed by continuous administration of 5-FC for over 2 
weeks resulted in doubling of median survival time, but 
animals all eventually succumbed to tumor recurrence.8 In 
contrast, multiple cycles of 5-FC could achieve prolonged 
survival, which we have now confirmed using the clinical 
vector Toca 511. After establishment of intracranial U-87 
gliomas, 2 × 106 TU of Toca 511 was given by stereotactic 
injection at the same coordinates, and multicycle daily 
5-FC prodrug treatment was commenced on day 18 for 7 
consecutive days at intervals of 1–2 weeks. As expected, 
none of the mice in the control groups, either untreated or 
treated with vector only without prodrug, survived longer 
than 38 days. In contrast, the group treated with Toca 
511 
+ 
5-FC showed significant survival benefit (P < .0001) 
and 87
.5% survival for over 120 days (Fig. 2A).
We then evaluated the survival of Toca 511 + 5-FC in 
intracranial Tu-2449 syngeneic models in immunocompe-
tent B6C3F1/J mice. Tu-2449, derived from a spontaneous 
tumor in GFAP-v-src-transgenic mice, has morphological 
features and growth characteristics reminiscent of human 
gliomas.20,21 In previous studies, we found that Toca 
511 + 5-FC could achieve eradication of intracranial 
Tu-2449 
tumors in syngeneic hosts,9 but not in immunodeficient 
hosts.11
We hypothesized that local intratumoral production 
of 5-FU avoids drug-induced myelosuppression as seen 
with systemic 5-FU treatment, thereby permitting induc-
tion of antitumor immune responses. However, while 
the 5-FC prodrug itself is well tolerated in humans and 
only extended high-level exposure can result in clini-
cally relevant myelotoxicity, it is also possible that pro-
longed production of 5-FU from the tumor might be 
counterproductive.
Therefore we investigated different dosing regimens for 
efficacy and induction of antitumor immunity. First, we 
examined 
Toca 511 at a low dose (104 
TU), followed by con-
tinuous daily 5-FC for 14 or 21 days. This is equivalent to 
the dose used in previous U-87 studies with the preclini-
cal vector followed by continuous 5-FC, and as there is a 
dose response effect for 
Toca 511 in the 
Tu-2449 model, this 
lower vector dose enables us to see either improvement or 
detriment compared with our previous 5-FC dosing regi-
mens. Results in Fig. 2B show that these continuous dosing 
regimens give similar outcomes: significantly improved 
survival compared with controls (P < .005) and 40% sur-
vival for >240 days after a continuous 14- or 21-day single 
course of 5-FC. It should be noted that long-term survival 
is significantly improved compared with that seen after 
the equivalent dose of virus followed by continuous 5-FC 
in the U-87 model,8 again suggesting the critical role of an 
intact immune system in achieving long-term survival, and 
indicating that the 5-FC dosing regimen or Toca 511 dose 
can impact induction of antitumor immunity.
We next investigated a shorter and more intense cyclic 
dosing regimen with high dose Toca 511 (3 × 106 TU) fol-
lowed by 5-FC for twice-daily 4-day cycles, spaced 10 days 
apart. This regimen also results in significantly improved 
survival compared with controls (P < .0001) and 82% sur-
vival for >160 days without further prodrug treatment after 
4 cycles (Fig. 2C). Notably, previously published results 
from a 4-day on/10-day off dosing regimen using a lower 
dose of virus also showed long-term survival benefit, but 
in a lower percentage of animals,9 again suggesting that 
the initial effectiveness of prodrug-activator gene ther-
apy may impact subsequent development of antitumor 
immunity.
Finally, we evaluated the survival of prodrug-activa-
tor gene therapy in the Tu-2449 model using the same 
cyclic 5-FC dosing regimen employed in the U-87 studies 
described above, that is, 2 × 106 TU Toca 511 injected into 
pre-established intracranial tumors followed by daily 5-FC 
prodrug treatment for 7 days at 1- to 2-week intervals. As 
expected, both control groups (no vector and 
Toca 511 fol-
lowed by saline vehicle instead of 5-FC) showed similar 
results and did not survive beyond 28 days. However, 
the group treated with Toca 511 plus 5-FC for 7-day cycles 
showed significantly longer survival than control groups 
(P < .0001), achieving 100% survival for over 360 days 
even without further prodrug treatment after the third 
cycle (Fig. 2D).
In Vivo Bioluminescence Imaging of Tumor 
Response to Toca 511 and Multicycle 5-FC
To enable real-time assessment of the therapeutic effect 
of Toca 511 followed by multicycle 5-FC in individual ani-
mals, U-87 and Tu-2449 cells used in the optimized cyclic 
5-FC studies above were pre-transduced with a replica-
tion-defective lentivirus vector expressing firefly lucif-
erase. Stable expression of luciferase in these cells was 
confirmed by optical imaging in vitro (Fig. 3A), which 
showed a quantitative correlation between cell number 
and luminescent signal intensity (Supplementary Fig. 
S2). After intratumoral injection of Toca 511 into estab-
lished U-87 intracranial gliomas, each mouse was ana-
lyzed by optical imaging weekly. In both tumor models, 
control mice that received saline instead of 5-FC showed 
tumor progression, as evidenced by increasing biolumi-
nescence signal intensities. However, animals treated 
with Toca 511 followed by 5-FC exhibited stable disease 
or decreased tumor burden, and overall, average tumor 
growth was significantly inhibited compared with control 
groups after the initial cycle of 5-FC treatment in both U-87 
(P < .0001) and 
Tu-2449 (P < .0001) tumor models (Fig. 3BC, 
Supplementary Fig. S3).
Subsequently, in the U-87 human glioma xenograft 
tumor model, the Toca 511 
+ 
5-FC treated mice repeatedly 
showed reemergence of increased luminescence signal 
intensities during intervals between 5-FC treatment cycles, 
indicating tumor recurrence upon cessation of prodrug 
treatment after each cycle (Fig. 3B). Increased tumor bur-
den as indicated by luminescence imaging was associated 
with characteristic behavioral changes, including hunched 
posture and reduced feeding and grooming activity, 
while reduction of tumor burden with each prodrug cycle 
restored normal activity without obvious ill effects. Thus, 
with repeated cycles of prodrug treatment, long-term

tumor control was possible without incurring any adverse 
effects.
Consistent with imaging results, qPCR for both human 
genomic and RRV sequences showed residual signals 
in brain tissues in this immunodeficient model, sup-
porting the existence of a reservoir of stably infected 
glioma cells enabling continued therapeutic benefit with 
prodrug administration upon tumor recurrence for at 
least 125 days until study termination (Supplementary 
Fig. S4).
In contrast, in the immunocompetent Tu-2449 model, 
bioluminescent signals of all treated tumors decreased 
rapidly after the initial cycle of 5-FC prodrug, stayed below 
detection threshold after the second cycle, and never 
recurred even without further prodrug treatment after the 
third cycle (Fig. 3C). At the molecular level, firefly lucif-
erase and RRV sequences were both undetectable by qPCR 
analysis of brain tissues from long-term surviving animals 
even 280 days after the last prodrug injection (ie, at study 
termination on day 361 after initial tumor establishment) 
(Fig. 3D, Supplementary Fig. S4).
Immunological Memory Induced in Long-Term 
Survivors After Toca 511 
+ 
5-FC Treatment
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens are not 
highly expressed on Tu-2449 cells at baseline, but MHC 
class I expression is upregulated by IFN-γ (Supplementary 
Fig. S5). Accordingly, tumor engraftment is robust in naïve 
syngeneic hosts, but pre-immunization leads to rejection,21 
indicating that antitumor immunity can be elicited in this 
model. 
To evaluate whether antitumor immunity had devel-
oped in immunocompetent hosts with 
Tu-2449 intracranial 
gliomas after administration of different dosing regimens, 
we challenged surviving animals subcutaneously with a 
low dose (1 × 105) of uninfected 
Tu-2449SC cells (previously 
passaged as subcutaneous tumors) at earlier time points

Low dose: 1.6 × 104 TU. Daily 5-FC was commenced continuously on day 10 for either 14 or 21 consecutive days (Toca 511 + 5-FC × 14 or 21). Toca 
511 + 5-FC showed significantly increased survival compared with Toca 511 + PBS (40% survival for >240 days; P < .005). Hatched area: daily 5-FC

post-establishment of the original intracranial tumors (Fig. 
4A). Some mice that had shown long-term survival with 
low-dose Toca 511/continuous 5-FC (Fig. 2B) completely 
controlled growth of subcutaneous tumors (4/8 treated 
vs 0/4 control) after rechallenge on day 105, although the 
mean tumor volume difference did not reach significance 
(Fig. 4B). However, mice that had been cured of brain 
tumor after receiving high-dose Toca 511/cyclic 5-FC (Fig. 
2C) showed significant inhibition of subcutaneous tumor 
growth after rechallenge on day 182, compared with naïve 
animals (P < .005, Fig. 4B). To further evaluate the durabil-
ity of antitumor immunity, we challenged cured mice after 
high dose Toca 511/cyclic 5-FC with a higher inoculum (2 
× 106) of uninfected Tu-2449SC cells (ie, uninfected with 
either RRV or lentiviral luciferase marking vector) on day 
303 post-original tumor implantation (Fig. 4A). Tumors 
successfully engrafted in all control animals, which had 
not previously been exposed to Tu-2449 tumors and were

naïve to any prior treatment. In contrast, in the previously 
cured mice, although subcutaneous tumors were observed 
initially on day 7 after challenge, these tumors all sponta-
neously disappeared by day 14 without recurrence (Fig. 
4C).
Cellular immunity was evaluated in splenocyte popula-
tions obtained from these previously cured mice by meas-
uring the number of IFN-γ producing cells with ELISPOT 
assay. Target cell–stimulated IFN-γ responses of spleno-
cytes derived from cured mice were significantly higher 
than splenocytes obtained from naïve control mice (P = 
.0005; Fig. 5A). Furthermore, mixed lymphocyte–target 
cell reactions using splenocytes from previously cured 
animals, monitored by xCELLigence electrical impedance 
analysis, showed progressive killing of 
Tu-2449 target cells 
over time in an effector:target ratio–dependent manner, 
compared with splenocytes from naïve mice (Fig. 5B, C), 
and were similar to those obtained after stimulating sple-
nocytes from naïve animals with INF-γ treated 
Tu-2449 cells 
(Supplementary Fig. S6). 
Taken together, these results indi-
cate that RRV-mediated prodrug-activator gene therapy 
stimulated endogenous antitumor responses that could be 
reactivated >300 days later.
Specific lymphocyte subsets that contribute to tumor 
eradication upon tumor rechallenge were assessed by 
antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+, CD8+, and natural 
killer (NK) cells. Depletion was verified by flow cytometry 
of splenocytes isolated from a randomly selected animal 
from each depletion group, and tumor establishment ver-
sus rejection was compared between lymphocyte sub-
set–depleted groups and nondepleted controls. Notably, 
tumors were still rejected in all previously cured animals 
subjected to NK or CD8+ 
T
-cell depletion, as in nondepleted 
controls. In contrast, CD4+ T
-cell or combination CD4+/
CD8+ T
-cell depletion prevented tumor rejection in previ-
ously cured animals (Fig. 6).
Discussion
The present studies underscore the advantages of RRV 
therapy, which integrates a prodrug-activator transgene 
into the cancer cell genome nonlytically, thereby convert-
ing infected cancer cells permanently into virus-produc-
ing cells. Previous studies relied solely on survival and 
endpoint immunohistochemical analyses to evaluate the 
efficacy of multicycle prodrug treatment in intracranial 
brain tumor models.8–11 This represents the first study to 
monitor RRV-mediated prodrug-activator gene therapy in 
intracranial glioma models using bioluminescence optical

imaging, which allowed more detailed assessments of 
tumor response to each cycle of treatment by sequentially 
visualizing and quantifying tumor burden in the same 
individual over time, and by qPCR analysis for sensitive 
detection of residual disease.
In the U-87 immunodeficient intracranial tumor model, 
the group treated with 
Toca 511 
+ 
5-FC showed a significant 
reduction of tumor burden compared with control groups 
after the initial cycle of 5-FC. However, bioluminescence 
imaging revealed the ongoing presence of residual dis-
ease, resulting in periodic tumor recurrence, and variable 
responses to repeated 5-FC were observed in individual 
animals (ie, tumor responses were either attenuated, lost, 
or recovered).
Theoretically, response to prodrug treatment depends 
on the number of RRV-transduced tumor cells undergoing 
division at the time of prodrug administration. Although 
transduction efficiencies were relatively uniform among 
infected tumors at the initial cycle of 5-FC treatment, vari-
ation in the number of residual infected cells at later time 
points may have caused variations in response to prod-
rug treatment. Nonetheless, relatively consistent control 
of tumor burden could be achieved over long durations 
with continued prodrug cycles, although not completely 
eliminated.
Viral replication kinetics and overall transduction levels 
were confirmed to be relatively equivalent between U-87 
and Tu-2449 models. However, with optimal vector dose 
and prodrug scheduling in the Tu-2449 model, intracranial 
tumor signals became undetectable, without recurrence 
even upon cessation of prodrug, and tumor eradication 
was confirmed by qPCR analysis for residual tumor cells in 
brain tissues from long-term survivors. An obvious differ-
ence between these models is the presence of a functioning 
cellular immune system in the immunocompetent syn-
geneic host. As noted, previous studies showed that Toca 
511 
+ 
5-FC was not curative in intracranial Tu-2449 models 
established in immunodeficient mice.11 Furthermore, base-
line levels of MHC expression are low in 
Tu-2449 cells in the 
absence of IFN-γ (Supplementary Fig. S7), and intact RRVs 
cause inhibition of type I interferon responses,3 so it was 
not clear whether antitumor immunity would develop after 
RRV-mediated gene therapy in this model.
In fact, our results indicate that the strong therapeu-
tic efficacy with apparent tumor clearance observed in 
the immunocompetent model was achieved not only 
by cytoreduction, but also by the development of antitu-
mor immune responses. Once denatured, RRV particles 
show immunostimulatory activity3 and hence may act as 
an adjuvant. Uninfected parental tumor cells were used 
to rechallenge long-term survivors after Toca 511 
+ 
5-FC, 
so the rejection responses observed were not directed 
against viral or luciferase reporter epitopes, but presum-
ably against endogenous tumor antigens released by 
Toca 
511 
+ 
5-FC–induced cell killing.
ELISPOT and xCELLigence assays confirmed the pres-
ence of cellular immunity against the parental tumor cells. 
As this was observed in animals that had survived for over 
300 days without further prodrug treatment beyond the 
third cycle, these responses may be mediated by memory 
T cells. Notably, lymphocyte subset–depletion studies 
demonstrated that CD4+ T cells were required for tumor 
rejection, while NK and CD8+ cell depletion did not abro-
gate rejection. Recent data indicate the importance of CD4+ 
T effector cells in antitumor and antiviral immunity, and

responses. (A) ELISPOT assay quantitating the number of IFN-γ–

CD4+ cells may be even more efficient as cytolytic effec-
tors than CD8+ cells, even with MHC class II–negative can-
cer cell targets.22 It has also recently been reported that 
cytolytic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can cooperatively attack 
retrovirus-infected cells,23 as also suggested by the data 
from our studies suggesting that depletion of both CD4+ 
and CD8+ subsets together was more effective in inhibit-
ing tumor rejection than depletion of CD4+ cells alone. 
While Tu-2449 cells do not appear to express class II MHC 
(Supplementary Fig. S5), it has been reported that CD4+ 
T cells may exert class II–unrestricted cytolytic effects via 
Fas signaling.24 An alternative possibility is that class II–
negative tumor cells are killed by CD4+ 
Th1 cell-dependent 
IFN-γ stimulated M1-like macrophages.25 Of note, detailed 
studies of intratumoral cell populations show reduction of 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells and initial reduction fol-
lowed by increased percentage of CD4+ cells overall, but 
with reduced Th2 and Th17 subsets, after Toca 511

5-FC 
treatment in 
Tu-2449 subcutaneous tumor models (Mitchell 
et al, accompanying manuscript).
In previous studies, a dose-response effect was noted, 
with fewer animals showing long-term survival with lower

anti-CD8, or anti-NK antibodies for immunocyte depletion prior to subcutaneous challenge with parental Tu-2449SC cells. Tumor measurements 
were performed twice a week.

vector doses,9 suggesting a threshold for effective RRV 
infection. However, in the present studies employing high-
dose vector, therapeutic results were robust with respect 
to 5-FC dosing schedules, as either daily 7-day cycles or 
twice-a-day 4-day cycles showed similar survival and 
tumor rejection. Furthermore, while longer-term continu-
ous 5-FC dosing yielded some long-term survivors, cyclic 
5-FC dosing schedules resulting in intermittent release 
of tumor antigens may be more effective at inducing 
long-term immune memory, analogous to prime-boost 
vaccination.
In summary, one major advantage of the use of a replica-
tive integrating vector compared with other virotherapies 
is the ability to trigger repeated cycles of cytoreduction by 
systemic administration of a well-tolerated prodrug. A sec-
ond major advantage as demonstrated here is the ability 
to induce antitumor immune responses after 
Toca 511 
+ 
5-FC 
mediated tumor ablation. Importantly, prodrug conversion 
is intracellular and metabolic inactivation of 5-FU is rapid, 
so that cytotoxicity is confined locally to the tumor. Adverse 
systemic effects characteristic of conventional chemo-
therapy, such as myelosuppression, are avoided and the 
immune system remains intact. Antitumor immunity can be 
further enabled by local generation of 5-FU leading to abla-
tion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells selectively within 
the tumor26 (Mitchell et al, accompanying manuscript).
As noted, Toca 511 
+ 
Toca FC is now being evaluated in 
phase II/III trials for recurrent high-grade glioma, and we 
are investigating whether anticancer immunity is similarly 
induced and contributes to clinical activity. Given recent 
interest in cancer immunotherapy and immune checkpoint 
blockade, the pro-immunogenic effects of RRV-mediated 
prodrug conversion for tumor cell killing and tumor anti-
gen release and for bystander killing of immunosuppres-
sive tumor stromal cells may prove widely useful.
