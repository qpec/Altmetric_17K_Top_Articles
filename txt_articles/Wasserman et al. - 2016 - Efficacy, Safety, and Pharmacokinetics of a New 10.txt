Abstract
Purpose Immune globulins for IgG supplementation have
been produced for over 35 years with essentially no differen-
tiating features regarding their specific antibody composition.
Furthermore, the compositions of plasma donor pools used for
IG manufacturing are not standardized. While all immune
globulin products meet the specifications set by the US FDA
for antibodies to pathogens like measles and polio, they have
variable levels of antibodies to other important viruses and
infectious pathogens, particularly respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV).
Methods An IVIG was developed that satisfies the require-
ments for treating patients with primary immune deficiency
disease (PIDD) and also has standardized elevated levels of
RSV neutralizing antibodies (RI-002). Plasma donors who
have naturally occurring high circulating levels of neutralizing
anti-RSVantibody were selected as the source for manufactur-
ing IVIG to treat patients with PIDD to prevent serious bacte-
rial infections. While the introduction of the monoclonal anti-
body Palivizumab has had a dramatic impact in diminishing
the burden of RSV disease in the pediatric population, it does
not meet the standards for replacing the deficient immune
compartments of patients with PIDD.
Results Fifty-nine patients with PIDD at 9 different sites
across the US were enrolled in this study and received regular
infusions of RI-002 over the course of 1 year.
Conclusions There were zero serious bacterial infections, thus
meeting the primary endpoint for this trial. The secondary
endpoints including days missed from work due to infection,
unscheduled visits to the physician, and days of hospitaliza-
tion due to infection compared favorably to published reports
of other IVIG products.

 Introduction
Immunoglobulin (IG) supplementation has been the standard
treatment for patients with disorders of antibody production
due to B cell or combined B and T cell abnormalities (PIDD)
[1–5]. Regularly scheduled infusions of IG replace or supple-
ment antibodies that decrease the risk of the serious bacterial
and viral infections experienced by PIDD patients [6–8].
Although all available preparations of immune globulin pro-
vide sufficient antibodies to significantly decrease the fre-
quency of infections in immunodeficient patients, infections
continue to occur [2, 6]. Previous studies have suggested that
some infections in antibody-deficient PIDD patients occur
when the titer of protective antibody is inadequate [9–12].
While many of these reports have focused on bacterial patho-
gens, additional evidence supports the proposition that high
titer anti-viral antibody preparations may provide advantages
over conventional IG [13, 14].
Studies of an early RSV-IVIG, RespiGam®, in prema-
ture infants demonstrated the ability of this polyclonal
anti-RSV hyperimmune globulin to reduce not only respi-
ratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections but also other viral
respiratory infections as well as otitis media [15, 16].
When this product was available, the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated that for children with
severe immunodeficiencies receiving IG therapy during
the winter months, physicians could consider the addition
and/or substitution of the high titer RSV-IVIG for stan-
dard IG supplementation [17]. These data suggested that a
polyclonal anti-RSV hyperimmune globulin would confer
enhanced protection from infection. Despite the success-
ful use of this RSV-IVIG in premature infants, it was
voluntarily withdrawn after the introduction of a mono-
clonal anti-RSV (Synagis®) antibody that could be admin-
istered intramuscularly rather than intravenously as was
required for the polyclonal antibody [14]. Consequently,
a new IG formulation that meets all the standard criteria
for treatment of PIDD (RI-002) was developed using plas-
ma collected from individuals tested to have high titer
anti-RSVantibodies [18].
The present study was a prospective, open-label, non-
randomized multicenter phase 3 study in the USA to evaluate
the efficacy and safety of RI-002 in patients with PIDD. The
primary objective was to evaluate the annualized acute serious
bacterial infection rate. Secondary objectives including eval-
uation of missed days of work due to infection, unscheduled
visits to the physician, days hospitalized due to infection as
well as the safety and tolerability of RI-002 were also studied.
Pharmacokinetic studies measured not only concentrations of
total immune globulin, but also measured the concentrations
of antibodies to RSV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), tetanus tox-
oid, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), measles, and 13
serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Methods
Study Product
The investigational new drug used in this study (RI-002) was
provided by ADMA Biologics (Ramsey, NJ).
RI-002 was manufactured from source plasma, obtained
from approved donors, and screened for blood borne patho-
gens by binding assays and nucleic acid testing, which was
purchased and obtained from domestic plasma donation cen-
ters licensed by US FDA and certified by Plasma Protein
Therapeutic Association (PPTA). The plasma pool for each
lot of RI-002 included sufficient plasma from donors with
high neutralizing titers to RSV to meet a standardized value.
The manufacturing method included Cohn-Oncley frac-
tionation followed by ion exchange chromatography followed
by other downstream purification steps. The final product
contains 100 ± 10 mg/mL protein. At least 96 % of the protein
is human IgG with a monomer plus dimer content greater than
95 %. The distribution of IgG subclasses in the final product is
similar to the distribution in the starting plasma.
The potency of the product meets 21 CFR 640.104 criteria
for the required levels of antibody to measles, polio, and diph-
theria in addition to having standardized elevated neutralizing
titers to RSV. The RSV neutralizing titers for all lots used in
the study were similar and have been found to be comparable
to the former RespiGam® product.
Study Design
This was an open-label, phase III study to evaluate the effica-
cy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of subjects with documented
PIDD (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01814800). Intravenous infu-
sions were given at the study centers at doses of 300–
800 mg/kg every 3 or 4 weeks for approximately 1 year.
Dosing interval was determined by each subject’s pre-study
infusion schedule. Infusion rates began at 0.5 mg/kg/min and
were incrementally increased every 15 min until reaching a
maximum of 8 mg/kg/min. Doses of RI-002 were adjusted
during the study to maintain minimum trough IgG concentra-
tions >500 mg/dL or at the investigator’s discretion.
A subset of subjects participated in the PK portion of the
study. PK data was analyzed for total IgG concentrations as
well as specific antibody titers to RSV, CMV, tetanus, Hib,
measles, and 13 serotypes of S. pneumoniae.
Study Subjects
Eligible subjects were male and female aged 2–75 years, in-
clusive with a confirmed diagnosis of primary immunodefi-
ciency. Prior to enrollment, subjects were required to have
received IVIG infusions every 3 or 4 weeks at a dose that
had not been changed by >50 % of the mean dose on a mg/

 kg basis for ≥3 months. Subjects were excluded if they had a
history of adverse reactions to blood or blood-derived prod-
ucts, selective IgA deficiency, and history of allergic reaction
to products containing IgA or antibodies to IgA, abnormal
liver function, deep vein thrombosis, hemolysis, or positive
Coombs test or were pregnant or lactating.
Efficacy Evaluation
The primary efficacy endpoint was the demonstration of a
serious bacterial infection (SBI) rate of less than 1.0 per
person-year during the 12-month treatment with RI-002.
Secondary efficacy endpoints included: the incidence of all
infections of any kind, the number of days lost from
work/school/usual activity due to infection and their treat-
ment, the number of unscheduled visits to physician/ER due
to infections, the time to resolution of infections, the number
of hospitalizations and days of hospitalizations due to infec-
tions, the number of days of antibiotic therapy (prophylactic
and treatment), the relationship among dose, trough level and
risk of serious and non-serious infections, and trough total IgG
and specific antibody levels.
Safety Evaluation
Subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs) and serious
adverse events (SAEs) during each infusion and between each
visit using subject diaries. AEs were defined as any untoward
medical occurrence whether or not the AE was determined to
be product related. Subjects regularly completed a subject
diary to capture data between study infusions. Subject diaries
were used to capture the incidence and duration of infections
(SBIs and other infections), use of antibiotics, sick days
(missed work or school), unscheduled doctor or hospital visits
due to infection, and the incidence of adverse events. These
data were reviewed with study personnel at each study visit to
confirm their accuracy and completeness. Temporally associ-
ated AEs (TAAEs) were adverse events occurring within 72 h
of RI-002 infusion. Safety endpoints included the incidence of
TAAEs, SAEs, and related SAEs, discontinuation of study
treatment, and PIDD related deaths, infusion site reactions,
change in vital signs before or after infusion, proportion of
infusions with one or TAAEs, and changes in laboratory
values.
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation
The blood samples for PK analysis were obtained beginning
after Infusion 7 or Infusion 9 in order to allow for wash out of
the previous IG product. Scheduled sampling times were as
follows: immediately prior to the infusion, end of the infusion,
60 min, 2 h, 24 h, 48 h, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and
28 days post-infusion. All PK parameters were calculated
using non-compartmental analysis. Only those plasma con-
centrations equal to or greater than the validated lower limit
of quantitation of the individual antibody assays were used in
the analysis. Actual sampling times were used in all pharma-
cokinetic analyses. Per protocol times were used to calculate
mean plasma concentrations for graphical displays.
Calculated PK parameters included: elimination constant
(K), elimination half-life (t½), area under the curve (AUC(0-
t)) over the 21 or 28-day dosing interval, total plasma clear-
ance (CL), and volume of distribution (Vz). Levels of specific
antibody to CMV, tetanus, Hib, measles, and RSV were de-
termined at each time point.
Statistical Analysis
The Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population included all screened
subjects who fulfilled eligibility criteria for RI-002 treatment.
All ITT subjects who received at least one RI-002 infusion in
the study (referenced to as mITT) were the primary population
for efficacy and safety analyses. The PK population includes
all mITTsubjects who enrolled to participate in the PK portion
of the study and who had sufficient plasma samples drawn to
derive PK parameters.
Descriptive statistics were provided for the overall popula-
tion and by treatment regimen (n, mean, SD, minimum, me-
dian, and maximum for continuous variables and counts and
percentages for categorical variables). Infections were identi-
fied based on reported treatment emergent adverse events that
were mapped to MedDRA ‘Infection and Infestations’ System
Organ Class. The concomitant medications records were used
to identify all antibiotic medications based on the WHO Drug
Coding of ATC level, route and indication. Annualized rate
(per person per year) was calculated by total episodes (e.g.,
total infection events) or total days (e.g., days lost due to
infection) divided by total person-years. The one-sided 95 %
upper bound for annualized rate was estimated from a general
linear model for Poisson distribution with only the intercept
parameter. Quartiles and mean days to resolution of infections
were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates.
The two-sided 90 % confidence intervals were calculated
using normal approximation with a continuity correction for
proportion of infusions with ≥ 1 TAAEs.
Results
Subject Demographics
A total of 75 subjects were screened and 59 subjects, 28 males
and 31 females, were enrolled and received at least 1 RI-002
infusion (mITT population). The majority of study subjects
were Caucasian (98.3 %), average age was 41.8 years ranging
from 3 to 73 years. The study included 48 adult subjects
592

 (>16 years of age) and 11 pediatric subjects. The most com-
mon PIDD type was common variable immunodeficiency
(CVID) in 45 subjects (76.3 % of the subjects). Mean time
from diagnosis to study enrollment was 8.66 years (ranged
from 0.3 to 32.9 years). Demographic characteristics were
similar between the two regimens (Table 1).
Efficacy
RI-002 was efficacious in the treatment of subjects with PIDD
aged 3 to 74 years, over a 1-year period. The efficacy of RI-
002 (Table 2) was demonstrated by the absence of any SBIs in
the study population. The observed incidence of zero (0) SBIs
in 55.88 subject years (20,396 total study days) of treatment
resulted in a SBI rate below the criteria of <1.0 SBI per subject
per year set by FDA. Other key efficacy secondary endpoints
included lost days from work/school/daycare due to infection
(1.66 days per subject per year), unscheduled emergency
room/medical visits due to infection (0.966 visits per subject
per year), and hospitalizations due to infection (0.018 hospi-
talizations per subject per year).
Analysis of trough concentrations of IgG and specific an-
tibodies demonstrated that administration of RI-002 at doses
of 284–1008 mg/kg every 3 or 4 weeks generally maintained
concentrations similar to those present at baseline. Trough
RSV titers, however, were an exception to this observation
with levels increasing after the first RI-002 infusion and re-
maining elevated throughout the study. Increase in antibody
levels to all pathogens tested were observed in subjects who
received RI-002 and those subjects who received doses of
≥500 mg/kg demonstrated even higher specific antibody
levels to all pathogens compared to those receiving
doses ≤ 500 mg/kg.
Although this study was not powered to identify differ-
ences in safety or efficacy between 3 and 4-week cycles, sub-
jects dosed with RI-002 on a 3-week cycle were observed to
have higher trough IgG concentrations compared to subjects
on a 4-week cycle but there was no evidence suggesting a
difference in efficacy or safety outcomes based on the treat-
ment cycle. Both treatment cycles were successful in main-
taining trough IgG concentrations well above the targeted
threshold of 500 mg/dL, with mean IgG trough levels ranging
from 1051.6 to 1194.9 mg/dL for subjects on a 3-week cycle,
and 913.3 to 978.5 mg/dL for subjects on a 4-week cycle.
Pharmacokinetics
Thirty subjects, 20 subjects on a 4-week infusion cycle and 10
subjects on a 3-week infusion cycle, participated in the PK
portion of the study. Administration of RI-002 with either
regimen resulted in increases in IgG and in CMV, tetanus,
Hib, measles, RSV, and S. pneumoniae serotype antibodies
with the greatest increase in Cmax observed in antibodies to
RSV. There was a 5.47-fold increase in the titer of anti-RSV
neutralizing antibody immediately after infusion of the IVIG
and a 6.79-fold increase in those subjects who received greater
than 500 mg/kg (Table 3). In this calculation, baseline was that
value of anti-RSV measured immediately prior to entry into
the trial. Figure 1 shows the pharmacokinetics of anti-RSV
antibodies, and in this situation, baseline was the value of
anti-RSV that was measured in the subjects enrolled in the
PK portion of the study immediately prior to infusion of the
seventh or ninth dose of IVIG. RI-002 is manufactured to
contain standardized, elevated levels of neutralizing antibod-
ies to RSV, and all lots are tested for release potency for RSV
antibody levels. There was no apparent difference between
groups in the mean plasma concentrations of IgG and the
mean values for Cmax despite a slightly larger AUC over the
dosing interval due to the 7-day longer period. Although the
mean values for t½ should be considered as qualitative be-
cause of the period of time over which λz was measured, they
are consistent with literature values for the t½ of IgG.

 Although there was a range of RI-002 doses within each
group, there was no apparent relationship between AUC over
the dosing interval and either total dose or weight adjusted
dose for either cohort (Table 4). Taken as a whole, the in-
creases in the RSV, CMV, tetanus, Hib, measles, and
S. pneumoniae antibodies were not affected by the treatment
intervals used in this study. The mean values for all antibodies
measured at baseline were comparable to the pre-infusion ti-
ters for both cohorts, and the maximum titers were higher than
the baseline and pre-infusion titers. There did not appear to be
a difference in exposure to IgG as a function of sex or age
group. Analysis of baseline corrected plasma IgG concentra-
tions resulted in comparisons between the 3 and 4-week cycle
cohorts that were comparable to those using plasma concen-
trations without baseline correction.
Safety
RI-002 was well tolerated in this study. The proportion of
study infusions with a TAAE was 0.142 with an upper one-
sided 95 % confidence limit of 0.164, indicating that the study
met the target (<0.40) for this safety endpoint. During the

 study, 43 (72.9 %) subjects experienced at least one TAAE,
and TAAEs were experienced during 113 (14.2 %) study in-
fusions (Table 5).
There were 793 infusions administered during the study,
with an average of 13.4 infusions administered per subject. Of
793 study infusions, one was not completed as planned, and
two infusions (in 2 different subjects) were interrupted due to
an AE and completed on the next day. The mean (SE) planned
weight adjusted dose of RI-002 administered during this study
was 505.2 (4.84) mg/kg, with a range of 284 to 1008 mg/kg.
The majority of subjects in this study did not experience
any infusion-related AEs or complications. Study infusions
were generally well tolerated with 95.8 % of infusions admin-
istered at the maximum allowed infusion rate of 8 mg/kg/min
RI-002 infusion rates ranged from 0.5 to 13.3 mg/kg/min
during the study. The use of pre-medication was limited to
seven study infusions (out of a total of 793 total infusions)
in seven subjects (0.009 %).
No serious bacterial infections occurred during the study. A
total of 618 treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) were experi-
enced by 58 subjects (98.3 %) during the course of this study
(Table 6). The most frequently reported TEAEs, regardless of
relationship to study drug, included: headache, sinusitis, diar-
rhea, viral gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, and upper respira-
tory tract infection. A total of 55 TEAEs were determined to
be study drug related in 26 (44.1 %) study subjects. The most
frequently reported study drug-related TEAE was headache.
There were no SAEs reported during the trial attributable to
the study drug. Two serious adverse events (SAEs) were re-
ported, one instance each of post-operative wound infection

drug; each event was experienced as a single occurrence in a
single subject.
There was a low incidence of adverse infusion reac-
tions, with a total of 31 events experienced by 18 subjects
(30.5 %) during 29 infusions (3.7 %). The most frequently
reported events included headache and myalgia. A total of
four infusion site reactions were reported in this study in
two subjects. The infusion site reactions reported included
infusion site extravasation and infusion site pain. There
was no evidence of a trend towards significant changes
in any of the laboratory assessments during treatment with
study medication. End of study laboratory assessments
were generally similar to screening assessments, with no
trends noted. There was no laboratory evidence of any
instances of a thrombotic event, acute renal failure, hemo-
lysis event, viral transmission, aseptic meningitis, or
transfusion-related acute lung injury.
Discussion
Among the viral infections that cause substantial morbidity,
respiratory syncytial virus is a particular problem, especially
in patients with coexistent pulmonary disease [19, 20]. In
1996, an anti-RSV hyper-immune globulin product, RSV-
IVIG (RespiGam®), was approved for the prevention of se-
vere respiratory syncytial virus infection in premature infants
whose gestational age was less than 32 weeks. Studies sug-
gested that RSV-IVIG reduced disease severity in infants who
became infected with RSV, shortening hospital stays com-
pared to age-matched controls [15, 16, 21]. Despite these ben-
eficial effects, RSV-IVIG was voluntarily removed from the
market by the manufacturer in favor of an intramuscularly
administrated monoclonal anti-RSV antibody palivizumab
(Synagis®). There are no direct head to head clinical studies
comparing the efficacy of RSV-IVIG to palivizumab [17].
While both appear comparable in their ability to prevent

 RSV infections in low birth weight infants, there appear to be
certain clinical advantages of the polyclonal antibody [17]. In
the PREVENT study, not only was RSV-IVIG able to prevent
RSV infections but it also reduced the incidence of other, non-
RSV-related upper respiratory diseases [15]. Another study
demonstrated that high-risk infants receiving RSV-IVIG had
a statistically significant reduction in the overall frequency of
otitis media compared with placebo-treated subjects, also sug-
gesting that polyclonal antibody activity to other pathogens
may have contributed to this reduction observed in the inci-
dence of otitis media [21]. Interestingly, in the current study,
there was only one single reported case of otitis media, an
exceedingly low incidence for this population of subjects in
the study. Recently published studies in the cotton rat demon-
strated that RI-002 can not only reduce the viral load in normal
and immune suppressed cotton rats that have been infected
with RSV, but that it can dramatically reverse the intense in-
flammatory changes that are observed in their pulmonary tis-
sue [22].
Because of the historical data suggesting the potential value
of a polyclonal anti-RSV, IG product for the immune-
compromised patient population, a new Ig formulation was
developed. The new product, RI-002, is an IVIG that is
manufactured and standardized to contain elevated levels of
anti-RSV neutralizing antibody and, in this regard, is
comparable to RespiGam® [22–24]. However, this new prod-
uct has the added advantage that it is manufactured to comply
with the FDA guidance for IG products for the treatment of
patients with PIDD [18]. Similar to other IGs, this IVIG (RI-
002) was made from plasma collected from more than 1000
plasma donors and was manufactured using an FDA-
approved fractionation and purification process [25, 26].
Unlike other IGs, the plasma that was used to produce RI-
002 was collected from donors who were identified and se-
lected to have high neutralizing antibody titers to RSV. The
selection was based on testing results obtained utilizing a val-
idated RSV live-virus microneutralization assay. There was as
great as a 6.79-fold increase in the levels of anti-RSV neutral-
izing antibody that was measured in subjects who were on the
dosing regimen of greater than 500 mg/kg. Interestingly, the
lots of IVIG produced from RSV hyperimmune donors were
also found to have significantly elevated antibody titers to
other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza type 1 and 3, influen-
za, coronavirus, and metapneumovirus) as compared to ten
other commercial lots of IG [27]. This preparation of RI-
002, therefore, can be regarded as having a unique antibody
profile for multiple respiratory viruses that differentiates it
from other commercially available IGs. Viewed in the context
of data from other IG trials, there are many of the secondary
efficacy endpoints, for example number of days missed from

 work/school/daycare (1.66 per subject per year), hospitaliza-
tion per subject per year (0.018), and unscheduled visits to the
physician or emergency room (0.72 per subject per year) com-
pared favorably to these published trials [25, 28–30]. This
study demonstrated excellent outcomes that might reflect the
unique antibody profile of RI-002.
The efficacy of RI-002 is likely the result of the mainte-
nance of stable IgG trough levels as well as specific antibody
levels throughout the study conferring the expected protective
effects of IG therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of RI-
002 were comparable to previous reports of IVIG prepara-
tions. All subjects maintained average trough levels of serum
Ig of approximately 1000 mg/kg. There were significant post-
infusion increases in all of the specific antibody titers mea-
sured with a greater than 6-fold increase seen in the concen-
tration of RSV-neutralizing antibody immediately post-
infusion in patients receiving greater than 500 mg/kg of IG.
There were no acute serious bacterial infections reported.
The single infection that required hospitalization was believed
to be secondary to a cat scratch that infected a recovering,
post-operative, shoulder joint repair wound. That subject
was non-compliant and missed his regularly scheduled dose
of RI-002.
RI-002 was safe and well tolerated. The rates of temporally
associated and treatment associated adverse events were well
within the FDA guidance and comparable to the rates of ad-
verse events that have occurred in studies of other IVIG prod-
ucts. Infusions were completed without interruption, discon-
tinuation or rate reduction in 790 of 793 (99.6 %) infusions.
Two subjects each reported one SAE (post-operative
wound infection and migraine) during this study, and neither
was associated with study drug. The subject with the post-
operative wound infection SAE discontinued from the study
whereas the subject with SAE of migraine completed the
study. One subject had an adverse drug reaction and
discontinued from the study. Three other discontinuations
were due to other causes (one subject became pregnant, one
subject was relocated, and 1 was discontinued due to sponsor
because of subject non-compliance).
Conclusions
RI-002 is a safe, well-tolerated, highly effective immunoglob-
ulin replacement for PIDD, manufactured with a unique anti-
body profile from a donor population tested to have elevated
anti-RSV-neutralizing antibody titers. The unexpectedly low
rate of infection-related outcomes suggests that the unique,
anti-viral antibody profile of RI-002 may be important in the
prevention of infections in PIDD subjects and raises novel
questions about the role of viral infections in the pathogenesis
of the infectious complications of PIDD. Since it has been
reported that pulmonary viral infections are often the
antecedent to bacterial pulmonary infections, it is tempting
to speculate that an IVIG that has high titer antibodies to
viruses may also have an impact on reducing the incidence
of bacterial infections.
