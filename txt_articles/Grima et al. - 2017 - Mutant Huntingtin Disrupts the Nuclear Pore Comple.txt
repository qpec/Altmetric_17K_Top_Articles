SUMMARY
Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by an expanded
CAG repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. The mech-
anism(s) by which mutant HTT (mHTT) causes dis-
ease is unclear. Nucleocytoplasmic transport, the
trafficking of macromolecules between the nucleus
and cytoplasm, is tightly regulated by nuclear
pore complexes (NPCs) made up of nucleoporins
(NUPs). Previous studies offered clues that mHTT
may disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport and a mu-
tation of an NUP can cause HD-like pathology. There-
fore, we evaluated the NPC and nucleocytoplasmic
transport in multiple models of HD, including mouse
and fly models, neurons transfected with mHTT, HD
iPSC-derived neurons, and human HD brain regions.
These studies revealed severe mislocalization and
aggregation of NUPs and defective nucleocyto-
plasmic transport. HD repeat-associated non-ATG
(RAN) translation proteins also disrupted nucleocy-
toplasmic transport. Additionally, overexpression of
NUPs and treatment with drugs that prevent aberrant
NUP biology also mitigated this transport defect and
neurotoxicity, providing future novel therapy targets.
INTRODUCTION
Huntington’s disease (HD) is the most common inherited neuro-
degenerative disorder, caused by an expanded CAG repeat in
the first exon of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene coding for a polyglut-
amine (polyQ) tract within the protein Huntingtin (HTT) (Fink-
beiner, 2011). This autosomal-dominant disease results in the
selective degeneration of striatal medium spiny projection neu-
rons and cortical pyramidal neurons as well as the formation of
intracellular neuronal aggregates. How mutant HTT (mHTT) can
induce this selective neuronal loss despite ubiquitous expres-
sion throughout the nervous system is unknown. Disease onset
and severity are dependent on CAG repeat length, with a longer
expansion resulting in an earlier onset and greater severity of
illness. The HTT gene in asymptomatic individuals contains
less than 35 CAG repeats, whereas pathologic expansions
contain greater than 39. A juvenile variant exists in which expan-
sion lengths in excess of �60 or more can result in symptom
onset earlier than 20 years of age (Vonsattel and DiFiglia,
1998). The underlying mechanisms by which mHTT causes neu-
rodegeneration have not been fully elucidated. Studies have pro-
vided clues that nuclear pore complex (NPC) dysfunction may be
a pathogenic contributor (Basel-Vanagaite et al., 2006; Hosp
et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Suhr et al., 2001; Woerner et al.,
2016), although very little is known about the NPC and the role
of nucleocytoplasmic transport defects in human HD or in
models of the disease.
The NPC is one of the largest molecular complexes in eukary-
otic cells and serves as the main transport conduit between the
nucleus and the cytoplasm. NPCs span the entire nuclear enve-
lope and consist of multiple copies of approximately 30 different
protein subunits called nucleoporins (NUPs). NUPs differ in func-
tions including protein import, protein export, RNA export, and
membrane anchoring and are organized into five unique anatom-
ical regions of the NPC (cytoplasmic ring/filaments, central chan-
nel, nuclear ring/basket, transmembrane, and scaffold) (Raices
and D’Angelo, 2012; Wente and Rout, 2010). The NPC has nucle-
ocytoplasmic transport-independent functions such as regu-
lating genome organization, gene expression, cell differentiation
and development, and RNA processing and quality control
(Raices and D’Angelo, 2012, 2017). During nuclear import, cargo
is released into the nucleus when the transport receptor interacts

93
 with Ran-GTP, a GTP-binding nuclear protein. During nuclear
export, cargo is released into the cytoplasm upon GTP hydroly-
sis of Ran-GTP by RanGAP1, a GTPase-activating protein
located on the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC that is also
required for nuclear import. Higher levels of Ran-GTP in the nu-
cleus compared to the cytoplasm are essential for fueling active
transport through the NPC and defining nucleocytoplasmic
transport directionality (Floch et al., 2014). The proper mainte-
nance of this nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) Ran gradient by
RanGAP1 is critical, and its loss has been shown to cause cell
death within minutes (Hetzer et al., 2002). Finally, molecules
less than �40 kDa can freely migrate through the NPC via pas-
sive transport.
Recent work from our group and others has shown that nucle-
ocytoplasmic transport is disrupted by a hexanucleotide repeat
expansion (HRE) in the C9orf72 gene, the most common muta-
tion in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) and a common cause of HD phenocopies (Frei-
baum et al., 2015; Hensman Moss et al., 2014; Jovi�
ci�
c et al.,
2015; Zhang et al., 2015). A direct interaction between the
HRE-containing RNAs and RanGAP1 can cause a disruption of
the Ran energy gradient required for active transport. In addition,
nucleocytoplasmic transport function can be disrupted by
repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation produced polydi-
peptides encoded by the HRE RNAs, which cause NUPs to
aggregate (Zhang et al., 2016) or block the central channel of
the NPC (Shi et al., 2017). RAN translation occurs not only in dis-
eases with noncoding region repeat expansions like C9orf72
HRE, but recent work has shown that RAN translation also
occurs in diseases with coding region expansions, including
HD (Ban
˜ ez-Coronel et al., 2015).
HD is pathologically characterized by intracellular inclusions in
the striatum and cortex, which consist of aggregates of HTT, HD-
RAN proteins, and other proteins including NUP62 (Suhr et al.,
2001). NUP62, located in the central channel of the NPC, plays
a direct role in nuclear import of proteins containing a nuclear
localization signal (NLS) as well as roles in transcription and
chromatin organization (Capelson et al., 2010; Kalverda et al.,
2010; Liang and Hetzer, 2011). It is also a member of the phenyl-
alanine-glycine (FG) repeat-containing NUPs, and the FG-rich
domain makes NUP62 important for controlling nuclear pore
permeability and selective trafficking of macromolecules to
and from the nucleus. Many transport receptors like importin-b
and NTF2 can traffic cargo containing an NLS or NES (nuclear
export signal) through the NPC via dynamic hydrophobic inter-
actions with the FG-rich domain of FG-NUPs (Wente and Rout,
2010). Intriguingly, a mutation in NUP62 causes autosomal-
recessive infantile bilateral striatal necrosis (IBSN), a fatal disor-
der characterized by striatal and globus pallidus degeneration
(Basel-Vanagaite et al., 2006). Also, mHTT exhibits preferential
binding to RanGAP1 and ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1), an
mRNA export factor (Hosp et al., 2015). In addition, nuclear
membrane distortions can be observed in various cell culture
models, transgenic animal models, and ultrastructural studies
of HD brain (Brettschneider et al., 2015; Cornett et al., 2005).
Perinuclear inclusions of mHTT disrupt the nuclear membrane
and cause striatal cell death in mouse and cell models of HD
(Liu et al., 2015). Finally, cytoplasmic protein aggregates can
disrupt nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of protein and RNA
(Woerner et al., 2016). Given these findings, we hypothesized
that mHTT may directly disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport at
the NPC.
We screened several NUPs and NPC-associated proteins
from all anatomical regions of the NPC in the R6/2 and zQ175
mouse models of HD and identified a subset that co-localize
with mHtt intracellular aggregates. These NUPs also aggregate
or mislocalize in HD and juvenile HD (JHD) postmortem human
tissue. Using HD induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
neurons (iPSNs), primary neurons transfected with full-length
mHTT, and a Drosophila model of HD, we show that several
NUPs are severely mislocalized and that there are deficits in
both passive and active nucleocytoplasmic transport, and
demonstrate correction of these deficits and neurotoxicity using
small molecules and overexpression constructs that target the
nucleocytoplasmic transport pathway. Finally, we demonstrate
that the recently discovered HD-RAN proteins can also directly
disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport. These data suggest that
mHTT disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport directly at the
NPC and that targeting this pathway may provide a therapeutic
route for HD.
RESULTS
NUPs Aggregate and Co-localize with mHtt in the R6/2
Mouse Model of HD
To analyze the integrity of the NPC in HD, we assessed the local-
ization of the majority of NUPs and NPC-associated proteins
(Table S1) in 10-week-old R6/2 mice using immunofluorescence.
The R6/2 mouse model expresses exon 1 of human HTT with
highly expanded CAG repeats (approximately 125–160 CAGs)
and exhibits HD-like symptomology with motor symptom onset
at 5 weeks, body weight decline onset at 10 weeks, and a life-
span ranging from 10 to 13 weeks (Pouladi et al., 2013). These
animals also develop accumulation of aggregated mHtt. We
frequently found that RanGAP1 and NUP62 form intranuclear
inclusions that co-localize with EM48+ mHTT aggregates in
neurons of the striatum and cortex of these mice (Figures 1A–
1D and S1).
We next examined insoluble and soluble mHtt and RanGAP1
levels in the striatum throughout disease progression in the
R6/2 mice. We previously showed the presence of an insoluble
high molecular weight (HMW) mHtt species along with other
modified proteins in the detergent-insoluble fraction from R6/2
striatum (Ochaba et al., 2016); therefore, detergent-soluble and
detergent-insoluble proteins were evaluated. The detergent-sol-
uble fraction contains mainly cytoplasmic proteins, monomeric
forms of Htt (including the R6/2 mHTT fragment encoding human
transgene), endogenous mouse full-length Htt, and soluble olig-
omeric species of Htt, which do not fully resolve on standard
PAGE gels (O’Rourke et al., 2013; Sontag et al., 2012). In
contrast, the detergent-insoluble fraction contains primarily
nuclear proteins such as HMW mHtt species (likely multimers
or potentially insoluble oligomers and fibrils) and insoluble
accumulated forms of SUMO- and ubiquitin-modified proteins.
As anticipated, levels of soluble monomeric transgene mHtt pro-
tein significantly decreased throughout disease progression

 (Figure 1E), with a corresponding age-dependent increase of an
insoluble, HMW accumulated species of mHtt (Figure 1E).
Notably, levels of insoluble RanGAP1 significantly decreased
throughout the progression of the disease, with little RanGAP1
observed by 11 weeks of age in this fraction from R6/2 striatum
(Figures 1E and 1F). This likely reflects a decrease in the levels of
nuclear envelope RanGAP1.
If chronic expression of mHtt causes the mislocalization and
nuclear envelope reduction of RanGAP1, then a molecular inter-
vention that reduces the aberrant accumulation of HMW mHtt
species in R6/2 mice might restore nuclear envelope RanGAP1
levels. Therefore, we evaluated striatal tissues from mice that
had been treated with microRNA (miRNA) directed against
PIAS1, an E3-SUMO ligase that modulates SUMO-1 and
SUMO-2/3 modification of HTT (O’Rourke et al., 2013; Ochaba
et al., 2016). Reduction of PIAS1 through intrastriatal injection
of a PIAS1-directed miRNA in vivo in R6/2 mice reduces forma-
tion of the HMW species of mHtt. Using the same fractionation
procedure, the detergent-insoluble fraction of non-transgenic
(NT) and R6/2 striatum plus and minus PIAS1 knockdown
(miPIAS1.3 treatment) at 10 weeks was analyzed for the pres-
ence of insoluble RanGAP1 (Figures S2A and S2B). Treatment
significantly restored levels of nuclear RanGAP1 to normal (NT)
levels in R6/2 striatum compared to miSAFE (control)-treated
mice. There were no significant differences either by genotype
or treatment for soluble RanGAP1 levels (Figure S2A). We also
assessed whether RanGAP1 was correspondingly reduced in
mHtt aggregates using a filter retardation assay to examine
levels of RanGAP1 that may be caught up in insoluble fibrils.
We found that RanGAP1 levels were higher in aggregates
resolved on filter blots in miSAFE-treated R6/2 striatum than in
miPIAS1.3 (Figure S2C), suggesting again the restoration of
RanGAP1 dyshomeostasis upon PIAS1 knockdown and that
RanGAP1 may be sequestered in aberrant protein inclusions
and complexes in the disease state.
NUPs Aggregate and Co-localize with mHtt in the zQ175
Mouse Model of HD
We next assessed the localization of many NUPs and NPC-asso-
ciated proteins (Table S1) in the zQ175 mouse model of HD at
2, 6, 9, and 12 months. This knockin mouse model contains
the human HTT exon 1 sequence with an �193 CAG (193 ± 7)
repeat tract, replacing the mouse Htt exon 1 within the native
mouse Htt gene (Pouladi et al., 2013). Heterozygous zQ175
mice begin exhibiting motor symptoms after 3 months of age
and demonstrate significant brain atrophy by 8 months. We
found that RanGAP1 and NUP88 form intracellular inclusions
that co-localize with EM48+ mHtt aggregates in the striatum
and cortex of these mice (Figures 2A–2D). On average, �70%
of all RanGAP1 aggregates co-localize with EM48+ mHtt aggre-
gates at 12 months (Figure S3). Using the spot detection function
in IMARIS software, these RanGAP1 aggregates increase in fre-
quency with age in both the striatum and cortex but are signifi-
cantly more prevalent in the striatum (Figures 2E–2G). Similarly,
quantification of the size of these inclusions indicates that the
diameter increases with age in both brain regions but is signifi-
cantly greater in the striatum (Figures 2H–2J).
NUP Pathology in Human HD and JHD Brain Tissue
To determine whether RanGAP1 and NUP62 mislocalization
and/or aggregation occurs in human disease, we assessed post-
mortem human brain tissue from HD and JHD patients. Brain
cells in HD and JHD frontal cortex and striatum commonly
exhibit either a mislocalization (arrow heads) or aggregation
(arrows) of RanGAP1 compared to smooth perinuclear staining
observed in controls (Figures 3A and 3B; Table S2). Similar
pathology was detected in HD and JHD cerebellum (Figure S4A).
Quantitatively, the pathologic mislocalization or aggregation of
RanGAP1 was more common in JHD than in adult-onset HD
brain regions, which might be predicted given that greater
mHTT CAG repeats are found in JHD. We then investigated
whether NUP62 also exhibited abnormal localization and/or
aggregation. Although we did not detect NUP62 aggregation,
NUP62 was dramatically mislocalized to either the cytoplasm
(arrows) or inside the nucleus (arrow heads) in HD and JHD stria-
tum, but not in cortex (except slightly for JHD) (Figure 3C) or
cerebellum (Figure S4B). This is consistent with the observations
that human mutations in NUP62 cause selective striatal pathol-
ogy in IBSN (Basel-Vanagaite et al., 2006). NUP62 cytoplasmic
or intranuclear mislocalization was also more pronounced in
JHD than in adult-onset HD brains regions (Figure 3C). Addition-
ally, we saw no pathology in translocated promoter region (TPR)
(data not shown), an NUP located in the nuclear basket of the
NPC and involved in nuclear export of N-terminal Htt (Cornett
et al., 2005). This was expected given that polyQ expansion
and aggregation of mHtt decrease its interaction with TPR (Cor-
nett et al., 2005) and would presumably render TPR unaffected.
Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Defects in Human
HD iPSNs
To validate our observations in human HD patient neurons (Table
S3), we quantified nuclear and cytoplasmic (N/C) endogenous
Ran in HD iPSNs via immunofluorescence. Higher levels of
Ran-GTP in the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm are required
to fuel canonical active transport through the NPC. We observed
a significant reduction in the N/C ratio of endogenous Ran in our
HD iPSN lines, suggesting that active transport is deficient in HD
(Figure 4A). We next assessed passive transport through the
NPC by quantifying N/C MAP2 via immunofluorescence. MAP2
(�70 kDa) is a cytoplasmic protein that is normally excluded
from the nucleus by the NPC (�40 kDa passive diffusion limit)
(Izant and McIntosh, 1980). We found a significant increase in

 the N/C ratio of endogenous MAP2, indicating that the NPC may
be leaky and compromised in HD (Figure 4B). We next quantified
the N/C ratio of RanGAP1 and NUP62 via immunofluorescence
and found significant decreases in both, providing additional ev-
idence that these NUPs and NPC-associated proteins are
severely mislocalized in HD (Figures 4C and 4D).
Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Defects in Primary
Neurons Transfected with Full-Length mHTT
As an additional model system, we investigated the disruption of
neuronal nucleocytoplasmic transport by employing rodent
cortical neurons transfected at 5 days in vitro (DIV5) with full-
length HTT 22Q (control) or HTT 82Q (HD) and examined active
nucleocytoplasmic transport via assessment of the Ran N/C
gradient. We observed a marked mislocalization of Ran (green)
to the cytoplasm in primary cortical neurons transfected with
HTT 82Q, with an �50% decrease in the Ran N/C gradient
upon quantification compared to cortical neurons transfected
with HTT 22Q (Figure 5A). To directly measure the nucleocyto-

we co-transfected primary cortical neu-
rons at DIV5 with HTT 22Q or HTT 82Q
and NLS-tdTomato-NES, a tdTomato
protein fused with a classical NLS and
NES, and measured the N/C ratio of
NLS-tdTomato-NES. Again, we observed
mislocalization
of
NLS-tdTomato-NES
(red) to the cytoplasm in primary cortical
neurons transfected with HTT 82Q and
an �50% loss of nuclear stain (Figure 5B). Collectively, these re-
sults may indicate that nuclear import is especially deficient
in HD.
HD-RAN Proteins Disrupt Nucleocytoplasmic Transport
It was recently demonstrated that in addition to the HTT
polyGln-expansion
protein,
four
additional
homopolymeric
expansion proteins (polyAla, polySer, polyLeu, and polyCys)
are generated in HD (Ban
˜ ez-Coronel et al., 2015) from the nucle-
otide repeat. These sense and antisense HD-RAN proteins are
also toxic to neural cells. In order to initially assess whether
HD-RAN proteins can alter nucleocytoplasmic transport, we
transfected cortical primary neurons with a CAG HTT-exon
1 minigene with a 6x STOP codon cassette (two stops in each
frame) upstream of HTT exon1 (Ban
˜ ez-Coronel et al., 2015) to
generate these HD-RAN proteins (Figure S5) and quantified
N/C Ran (active transport) and N/C MAP2 (passive transport)
via immunofluorescence. We observed a significant reduction
in the N/C ratio of endogenous Ran (Figure 6A) and a significant
98
Neuron 94, 93–107, April 5, 2017
 increase in the N/C ratio of endogenous MAP2 (Figure 6B),
indicating that HD-RAN proteins can cause defects in both
active and passive nucleocytoplasmic transport. Finally, we
co-expressed the aforementioned HD-RAN construct with a
tdTomato protein tagged with an NLS and NES and quantified
N/C NLS-tdTomato-NES. We observed a significant decrease
in the N/C ratio of NLS-tdTomato-NES (Figure 6C), indicating
that HD-RAN proteins may also contribute to defects in nuclear
import.
Overexpression of Ran and RanGAP1 Is Neuroprotective
in HD
To assess the extent to which the nucleocytoplasmic transport
pathway may contribute to HD, we overexpressed a functional
RanGAP1-GFP fusion protein in primary mouse cortical neu-
rons that were co-transfected with either full-length HTT 22Q
(control) or HTT 82Q (HD) and eGFP and performed a nuclear

We
found
that
overex-
pression of RanGAP1-GFP significantly
reduced cell death in primary cortical

protein also significantly reduced cell death (Figure 7B) and
significantly increased cell viability as assessed with the
alamarBlue assay (Figure 7C). Finally, to test whether overex-
pression of Ran could modulate the mHTT phenotype in vivo,
we tested the genetic interaction of Ran with Htt in an HD
expanded repeat Drosophila model (Figure 7D). Using the
GAL4/UAS system to express an N-terminal fragment of the
human HTT protein in Drosophila tissues results in HTT aggre-
gate formation and neurodegeneration (Lee et al., 2004). Expres-

produced disruption in the external eye morphology including
ommatidial disorganization and loss of pigment consistent with
previous observations, a phenotype not observed upon expres-
sion of HTT 0Q. These phenotypes are rescued when we overex-
press wild-type (WT) Ran and enhanced when we express
a dominant-negative (DN) form of Ran (Figure 7D). To confirm

 this genetic interaction in another neuronal subtype, we ex-
pressed HTT 128Q in motor neurons using the OK371-GAL4
driver causing complete pupal lethality (Figure 7E). However,
when WT Ran without GFP or DN Ran is coexpressed with Htt
128Q, there is a marked rescue of lethality with �40% of flies sur-
viving to adulthood.
Pharmacological Rescue of Nucleocytoplasmic
Transport Defects and Neurotoxicity in HD
We next evaluated two additional pathways that might regulate
function of NUPs and NPC-associated proteins and restore
their proper homeostasis. First, O-GlcNAcylation is a post-
translational
modification
in
which
b-N-acetylglucosamine
(GlcNAc) is added to serine or threonine residues within intra-
cellular proteins (Zachara and Hart, 2006). Interestingly, NUPs
are the most heavily O-GlcNAc-modified proteins and are
among the best substrates of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT),
the enzyme that catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc to pro-
teins (Li and Kohler, 2014; Ruba and Yang, 2016). Because
O-GlcNAcylation is essential for NPC integrity and function
as well as maintenance of the pore selectivity filter (Zhu
et al., 2016), and ten O-GlcNAc residues have been detected
on NUP62, we quantified the nuclear levels of O-GlcNAc found
specifically on NUPs using immunofluorescence in the cortex
of 12-month-old zQ175 animals (Figure 8A). Using the RL2
antibody that predominantly recognizes this post-translational
modification on NUPs (Li and Kohler, 2014), we observed
that O-GlcNAc is significantly decreased in cortical cells of
Het zQ175 mice (Figure 8A). This suggests that NUPs like
NUP62, which is mislocalized in HD cultured neurons (Fig-
ure 4D) and in rodent (Figures 1C and 1D) and human
brain (Figure 3C), may be susceptible to mislocalization due
to decreased levels and/or misregulation of O-GlcNAc. We
therefore treated primary cortical neurons cotransfected with
full-length HTT 22Q (control) or HTT 82Q (HD) and eGFP
with Thiamet-G (0.5 mM). Thiamet-G is a potent selective inhib-
itor of O-GlcNAcase (OGA) that catalyzes the removal of
O-GlcNAc, resulting in elevated levels of O-GlcNAc (Yuzwa
et al., 2014). We observed that treatment with Thiamet-G
significantly reduced cell death in primary cortical neurons
transfected with Htt 82Q (Figure 8B) and increased cell
viability (Figure S6A). Treatment with Thiamet-G also rescued
nucleocytoplasmic trafficking defects with the nuclear restora-
tion of both endogenous Ran (Figure 8C) and exogenous
NLS-tdTomato-NES (Figure 8D).
Next, we assessed the therapeutic potential of KPT-350, a
potent inhibitor of Exportin-1 (XPO1 or CRM1), an NPC-associ-
ated protein responsible for the nuclear export of proteins
bearing a leucine-rich NES and RNAs (Wente and Rout, 2010).
KPT-350 was recently shown to be neuroprotective in models
of inflammatory demyelination (Haines et al., 2015), and KPT-
276, a closely related molecule, was shown to be neuroprotec-
tive in C9orf72-ALS models (Zhang et al., 2015). Treatment
with KPT-350 (0.01 and 0.1 mM) significantly reduced cell death
in primary cortical neurons transfected with HTT 82Q (Figure 8E)
and significantly increased cell viability (Figure S6B). Treatment
with
KPT-350
also
rescued
nucleocytoplasmic
trafficking
defects as seen with nuclear restoration of exogenous NLS-
tdTomato-NES (Figure 8F). This suggests that inhibiting nuclear
export may be neuroprotective and able to mitigate nucleocyto-
plasmic transport defects in HD by compensating for disrupted
nuclear import.

 DISCUSSION
Using mouse models, postmortem human tissue, a Drosophila
model, human patient-derived neurons, and primary neurons
transfected with full-length mHTT, we demonstrate that prod-
ucts of the CAG triplet repeat expansion within the HD gene
cause disruption of the NPC and nucleocytoplasmic transport.
First, multiple proteins of the NPC, particularly those from the
cytoplasmic ring/filaments and central channel regions, misloc-
alize and/or aggregate in the striatum and cortex of both an
N-terminal mutant HTT transgenic and full-length mutant Htt
knockin mouse model of HD, human HD, and JHD postmortem
tissue, iPSNs from HD human patients, and primary neurons
transfected with full-length mHTT. These NUP aggregates co-
localize with mHtt and increase in frequency and diameter
with disease progression. Second, the insoluble levels of one
of these proteins, RanGAP1, which is essential for maintaining
the energy gradient (Ran) that fuels active nucleocytoplasmic
transport, decreases in the nuclear-enriched fraction with dis-
ease progression. This can be rescued when knocking down
levels of PIAS1, which was recently shown to decrease aberrant
mHtt accumulation (Ochaba et al., 2016) and thus may free up
proteins like NUPs that are caught up in insoluble protein
aggregates and complexes. Third, iPSNs from human HD
patients and primary neurons transfected with full-length
mHTT show a disruption in the Ran gradient and increased
permeability of the NPC, indicating that both active and passive
nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted in HD. Also, exoge-
nous NLS-tdTomato-NES mislocalizes to the cytoplasm in pri-
mary neurons transfected with full-length mHTT, suggesting
that nuclear protein import may be especially deficient in HD.
Additionally, recently discovered HD-RAN proteins can also
contribute to deficits in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Finally,
we can rescue cell death, increase cell viability, and restore
nucleocytoplasmic transport function when overexpressing
RanGAP1 or Ran in primary neurons transfected with full-length
mHTT and in a Drosophila model of HD as well as when treating
with Thiamet-G, an inhibitor that increases O-GlcNAc levels that
highly regulate NPC homeostasis, or KPT-350, an inhibitor of
canonical nuclear export.

 There are prior clues to support our hypothesis that a disrup-
tion of nuclear events by mHTT is important for expanded CAG-
repeat-mediated pathophysiology. Previous studies showed
that adding an exogenous NLS to polyQ expanded proteins
such as small HTT amino-terminal fragments (Schilling et al.,
2004) and full-length HTT (Saudou et al., 1998) results in
increased toxicity in cell and animal models, suggesting that nu-
clear localization of HTT polyQ expansions contributes to its
toxicity. Additionally, adding an NES to full-length HTT, restrict-
ing it to the cytoplasm, reduces toxicity. However, the real target
of nuclear disruption remained unknown. The comprehensive
studies that we have amassed in human brain and multiple hu-
man cell and animal models, in vivo and in vitro, strongly suggest
that mHTT compromises the gatekeeper of the nucleus, the
NPC, and ultimately nucleocytoplasmic transport function. This
pathophysiology may extend to other polyQ diseases given
that nuclear shuttling and accumulation are common to the
majority of polyQ disease proteins such as ataxin-2 in spinocer-
ebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) (La Spada and Taylor, 2010). This may
partially explain why the R6/2 mouse model exhibits such an
extreme phenotype. This model uniquely expresses just the
N-terminal fragment of HTT, which contains no classic NLS or
HEAT repeats but may be small enough to readily cross the
NPC into the nucleus and potentially sequester significantly
more NUPs compared to full-length Htt mouse models. In fact,
the current study indicates that NUP aggregates are larger in
diameter in the R6/2 mouse model compared to zQ175; alterna-
tively, this could also be due to different expression levels of
HTT. Further comparative studies in different animal models
are needed.
Nucleocytoplasmic transport, the trafficking of protein and
RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm, is critical for the

(Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.0001), whereas co-expression of RanDN or GFP alone was not sufficient to rescue.

 proper functioning of cells. This regulated and efficient commu-
nication of macromolecules is essential for signal transduction,
neuronal plasticity, glial function, and overall cellular survival
(Dickmanns et al., 2015; Schachtrup et al., 2015). Altered nucle-
ocytoplasmic distribution of proteins such as transcription
factors is commonly seen across several neurodegenerative dis-
eases and may be the result of defective nucleocytoplasmic
transport. Examples include mislocalization of activating tran-
scription factor 2 (ATF2), nuclear factor E2-related factor 2
(Nrf2), and importin-a1 in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Lee et al.,
2006; Yamada et al., 1997); phosphorylated cyclic AMP
response element-binding protein (pCREB) and phosphorylated
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) in Parkin-
son’s disease (PD) (Chalovich et al., 2006; Ferrer et al., 2001);
and TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in FTD and ALS (Neu-
mann et al., 2006). Recent work from our group and others, using
human, fly, and yeast models, revealed that an expanded hexa-
nucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat (HRE) within a non-coding region
of the C9orf72 gene causes dysfunction in nuclear import, which
may explain the hallmark cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 in
ALS and FTD (Zhang et al., 2015). Given these prior studies in
ALS, FTD, and now HD, as well as a recent study demonstrating
that certain cytoplasmic protein aggregates can interfere with
nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of protein and RNA (Woerner
et al., 2016), dysfunction in nucleocytoplasmic transport may
be a shared common defect across multiple neurodegenerative
disorders.
Whether
this
pathway
contributes
to
sporadic
forms of these age-related degenerative diseases awaits further
research.
Interestingly, altering NPC function has been shown to impact
longevity (Lord et al., 2015). The NPC regulates not only nucleo-
cytoplasmic transport but also genome organization, gene
expression, cell differentiation, and development, and may be
fundamental to brain aging. Some of the longest-lived proteins
in the mammalian brain are components of the NPC and thus
may represent a ‘‘weak link’’ in the aging proteome (Savas
et al., 2012; Toyama et al., 2013). Because these NUPs persist
for so long without being recycled, they have been shown to
accumulate molecular damage over time, and this age-related
deterioration results in an increase in nuclear permeability and
the leaking of cytoplasmic proteins and toxins inside the nucleus
(D’Angelo et al., 2009). In fact, the current study provides evi-
dence of nuclear leakage of MAP2, a cytoplasmic protein, in
several in vitro models of HD, indicating a dysfunctional NPC.
This could result in alterations in DNA and cellular aging. Given
that aging is an independent risk factor for neurodegeneration,
defects in the NPC may underlie neurodegeneration, and this
injury may be mitigated by utilizing small molecules that act on
this pathway such as Thiamet-G and KPT-350, as detailed in
the current studies. In fact, Thiamet-G has already been shown
to be neuroprotective in models of AD (Borghgraef et al., 2013;
Yuzwa et al., 2012, 2014), and KPT-350 and related SINE (selec-
tive inhibitor of nuclear export) compounds were recently shown
to be neuroprotective in models of C9orf72-ALS (Zhang et al.,
2015) and inflammatory demyelination (Haines et al., 2015).
Therefore, these compounds may also prove therapeutic for
other diseases that involve defects in NPC and nucleocytoplas-
mic transport function.
A question that often arises when studying neurodegeneration
is why only some cells undergo injury when the mutant proteins
or pathways are often ubiquitous. Very little is known about the
neurobiology of the NPC in the CNS. Although the overall struc-
ture of the NPC is conserved across different cell types, studies
suggest that cells may express unique combinations of NUPs to
generate NPCs with specialized functions (Ori et al., 2013). There
is evidence to suggest that individual NUPs may be responsible
for the trafficking of unique macromolecules, thus adding a layer
of diversity and specificity to the NPC (Raices and D’Angelo,
2012). This is best supported by the fact that mutations in various
NUPs result in tissue-specific diseases. For instance, a missense
mutation in NUP62 (Q391P) causes IBSN, an autosomal-reces-
sive neurodegenerative disease that results in the selective
degeneration of the corpus striatum in infants (Basel-Vanagaite
et al., 2006). This suggests that NUP62 may play a critical role
for the proper functioning of the corpus striatum. We now
show that NUP62 mislocalizes and/or aggregates in several
HD animal models, HD human tissue, and HD iPSNs. In fact,
NUP62 pathology was primarily found in HD human striatum,
not cortex or cerebellum. Purified HTT fragment polyQ aggre-
gates have been shown to sequester NUP62 (Suhr et al.,
2001). The mechanism that underlies sequestration of NUP62
may mediate the selective degeneration of the striatum in HD.
Future studies could address whether the composition of the
NPC is different across the CNS at a regional and cellular level,
yielding NPCs with distinct properties and specialized functions
given brain cell-type-specific constraints and context-depen-
dent needs. If the composition of the NPC differs across CNS
cell types and tissues, this may provide a plausible explanation
for tissue-specific neurological diseases that arise from muta-
tions in various NUPs like GLE1 in fetal motoneuron disease

 (Nousiainen et al., 2008) and rare forms of ALS (Kaneb et al.,
2015) and NUP62 in IBSN.
Our findings highlighting the contribution of O-GlcNAc and
NPC proteins in HD provide a new avenue for investigation
and therapeutics discovery. While we cannot rule out that
our
Thiamet-G
treatment
may
have
also
modified
other
O-GlcNAc-modified proteins that indirectly altered nucleocyto-
plasmic transport to mitigate the injury observed, the current
studies do show that altering nucleocytoplasmic transport func-
tion is one such candidate and not previously studied. Also, the
O-GlcNAc antibody used in the current study, ‘‘RL2,’’ predom-
inantly recognizes the O-GlcNAc modification on NPC proteins,
and these NUPs are the most heavily O-GlcNAc-modified pro-
teins and are among the best substrates for O-GlcNAc trans-
ferase (OGT) (Li and Kohler, 2014; Ruba and Yang, 2016). For
example, downregulation of O-GlcNAcylation selectively affects
NUP62 and NUP88, but not TPR, in vitro (Mizuguchi-Hata et al.,
2013), which directly supports what we observe in our HD
models. NUP88 homeostasis is also regulated through its inter-
action with O-GlcNAcylated NUP62, which suggests that the
NPC defect in HD could be initiated with NUP62 mislocaliza-
tion. O-GlcNAc also helps maintain NPC homeostasis by pre-
venting the inappropriate aggregation and degradation of
NUPs by decreasing ubiquitination or disturbing the ubiquitin-
proteosomal degradation pathway (Zhu et al., 2016). Given
the relationship between O-GlcNAc and NUP homeostasis
and the fact that O-GlcNAc integrates metabolic information
(Bond and Hanover, 2015; Hart, 2014), it is enticing to speculate
whether distinct metabolic profiles across different regions of
the brain (Magistretti and Allaman, 2015) may dictate NPC
composition via O-GlcNAc signaling. Lastly, recent work
showed that cytoplasmic aggregates such as tau can disrupt
nucleocytoplasmic transport of protein and RNA (Woerner
et al., 2016). Given we now show that Thiamet-G can restore
nucleocytoplasmic transport function, it may also provide an
additional explanation as to why Thiamet-G has already been
shown to be neuroprotective against tauopathy (Borghgraef
et al., 2013).
Overall, the current study provides compelling and compre-
hensive new data using multiple model systems and human
brain, implicating aberrant NPC function, specifically its role in
regulating nucleocytoplasmic transport, in the pathogenesis of
HD and potentially other polyQ-expansion and neurodegenera-
tive disorders. The mHTT polyQ protein is sufficient to induce nu-
cleocytoplasmic trafficking deficits; however, future studies are
required to further elucidate the contribution of newly discovered
HD-RAN proteins in altering nucleocytoplasmic transport func-
tion. Although we demonstrate that the HD-RAN proteins can
generally alter nucleocytoplasmic transport, it is still unknown
as to which one of these specific protein(s) (polyAla, polySer,
polyLeu, and polyCys) is/are mostly mediating this dysfunction.
Interestingly, HD-RAN proteins appear to be more abundant in
the cerebellum than the polyQ aggregates (Ban
˜ ez-Coronel
et al., 2015) and thus may be selectively responsible for the mis-
localization or aggregation of RanGAP1 detected in HD, but
mostly JHD, cerebellum in the current studies. This is consistent
with recent reports demonstrating cerebellar pathology and
atrophy in both adult and juvenile HD cases, which may explain
some of the balance and gait abnormalities found in patients
(R€
ub et al., 2013).
Lastly, future work should not only focus on further elucidating
the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport in HD but also on other
critical functions mediated by the NPC such as potential genome
organization and gene expression alterations. Given the crucial
role that the NPC plays in regulating the transport of macromol-
ecules to and from the nucleus and local transcription, these new
studies suggest that defects in the NPC may be playing a sub-
stantial role in HD pathogenesis and provide a new target for
therapeutic interventions.

 R6/2 mice
R6/2 transgenic mice and their NT littermates were obtained from either Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) or breeding colonies
maintained at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (line 2810 �160 ± 5 CAG repeats) or University of California, Irvine (line
6494 �120 ± 5 CAG repeats). Offspring were genotyped using tail DNA. 10 week old R6/2 transgenic mice and their NT littermates
were used for the immunofluorescence studies. 5, 7, 9, and 11 week old R6/2 transgenic mice and their NT littermates were used for
the soluble/insoluble fractionation experiments and filter retardation assay.
zQ175 mice
zQ175 mice and wild-type littermate controls were acquired from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Genotyping and CAG repeat
count were determined at Laragen (Culver City, CA, USA) by PCR of tail snips. The CAG repeat length was 193 ± 7 in heterozygous
zQ175 mice used in the study. 2, 6, 9, and 12 month old zQ175 mice and wild-type littermate controls were used in this study. All mice
were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were
post-fixed overnight followed by immersion in 30% sucrose for 24 hr. Coronal brain sections (40 mm) were cut on a cryostat and used
for immunofluorescence. All animals have been described previously.
iPS Cell Culture
Human patient demographic information for control and HD iPSC lines is provided in Table S3. Products were purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA USA), unless otherwise specified. A control unaffected and apparently healthy non-disease
GM03814human fibroblast cell line was obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, under their consent and privacy
guidelines as described. The parental fibroblast for the 109Q (Coriell, ND39258) repeat HD line was obtained from John’s Hopkins
University under Dr. Russell Margolis’s IRB protocol #NA00018358 and the parental fibroblast line for the 53Q repeat HD line was
obtained from UC Irvine IRB protocol #2008-6556. All procedures were performed in accordance with the institutional review board’s
guidelines at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center under the auspices of IRB-SCRO Protocols Pro00028429 (Transplantation of iPSC-
derived human neural progenitors), Pro00021505, and Pro00032834. Upon iPSC generation at Cedars Sinai, they were renamed
CS14CTR-28nXX, CS03iHD53nXX, and CS109iHD-109nXX to reflect, 1) last two digits of parental lines identifier, 2) non-disease
or HD line, 3) CAG repeat number, and 4) XX is the clone number (PMID: 21474098). These iPSC lines are referred herein as 28Q,
53Q and 109Q, respectively. Fibroblasts were reprogrammed into non-integrating and virus-free iPSC lines with non-integrating
episomal factors as described previously (PMID:25740845). iPSC colonies were maintained at 37�C, 95% air/5% CO2, in mTeSR1
complete media (StemCell technologies, Vancouver, Canada) on hESC qualified Matrigel (Corning, Union City, CA, USA) coated,
6 well tissue culture dishes (Corning, USA). Cells were passaged every 3-4 days using Versene.
Primary Neuron Culture
Primary mouse cortical and striatal neurons were prepared as described previously (Watkin et al., 2014). Cortices and striatum of CD1
mice at embryonic day 17 were dissected out, digested with trypsin (0.05% Trypsin EDTA, GIBCO) for 10 min and mechanically
dissociated. Neurons were resuspended in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) plated at 1x106 cell/cm2 on
poly-D-lysine coated 24 well plates (Corning). Cells were kept in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and 2mM GlutaMAX
(GIBCO, Rockville, MD, USA) in 5% CO2 at 37’C until the day of the experiment.
Drosophila Genetics
Flies were raised on standard food at 25�C unless otherwise noted. OK371-GAL4 and GMR-GAL4, and UAS-NLS-NESP12-GFP
(referred to as UAS-GFP) were from Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. UAS-Ran (Kumita et al., 2012)-HA and UAS-Ran
[T24N]-HA (dominant negative) were obtained from Kim McKim. UAS-Htt.Q128 and UAS-Htt.Q0 were obtained from Troy Littleton.
To assess genetic interaction, OK371-GAL4; UAS-Ran* and GMR-GAL4; UAS-Ran* were crossed to either UAS-Htt.Q128 or UAS-
Htt.Q0. For the eye phenotype, at least 20 flies per genotype were examined for ommatidial disorganization, loss of interommatidial
bristles, photopigment loss, retinal collapse, and presence of necrotic spots. For pupal lethality assay, pupal cases were scored as
eclosed (alive) or non-eclosed (dead) 15 days after the cross had been set.
METHOD DETAILS
Immunofluorescence in Mouse Brain Tissue
40 mm-thick free-floating coronal sections were obtained from R6/2 mouse brains at 10 weeks of age and control and heterozygous
zQ175 mouse brains at 2, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Sections were incubated in blocking solution (1x PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100
and 10% normal goat serum (NGS)) for 1 hr. Next, sections were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight at
4�C. Primary antibodies used are as follows: anti-RanGAP1 (1:100, Santa Cruz H-180 Cat# SC-25630), anti-NUP62 (1:50, Santa Cruz
H-122 Cat#SC25523), anti-NUP88 (1:100, Abcam Cat#AB79785), and anti-O-GlcNAc (RL2) (1:1000, generously provided by
Dr. Natasha Zachara and the Johns Hopkins O-GlcNAc Core). Summary of primary antibodies used to detect other NUPs and
NPC-associated proteins are described in Table S1. After incubating overnight, sections were washed 3 times in 1x PBX (1x PBS
with 0.1% Triton X-100) at room temperature (RT) for 30 min (10 min/wash). Sections were then incubated with goat secondary
antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000), 555 (1:1000) and 633 (1:500) (Life Technologies) in blocking solution at RT for
e3

 1 hr. Sections were washed twice with 1x PBX for 20 min (10 min/wash), washed with 1x PBS and Hoescht dye (1:5000, Cell Signaling
Technology Cat#4082S) for 10 min, and then transferred to a final 1x PBS wash. Sections were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade
Mountant with DAPI (Life Technologies).
Immunocytochemistry in Primary and iPS Neurons
Immunocytochemistry in neuronal cell lines has been described previously (Zhang et al., 2015). In brief, neurons were first washed
with 1x PBS (1x), fixed with 4% PFA (diluted in 1x PBS) for 13 min, washed with 1x PBS (1x), permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100
(diluted in 1x PBS) for 10 min, washed with 1x PBS (2x), blocked with 1x PBS and 5% NGS for 1 hr, and incubated with primary
antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4�C. Primary antibodies used are as follows: anti-RanGAP1 (1:100, Santa Cruz H-180,
Cat# SC-25630), anti-NUP62 (1:100, Santa Cruz H-122, Cat#SC25523), anti-NUP88 (1:200, Abcam, Cat#AB79785), anti-Ran
(1:200, BD Biosciences, Cat#610341), anti-MAP2 (1:1000, Synaptic Systems, Cat#188004), and HD-RAN C-terminal antibody
anti-polySer-Ct (1:500) (Ban
˜ ez-Coronel et al., 2015). After incubating overnight, neurons were washed 3x with 1x PBS at room
temperature (RT), incubated with goat secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000), 555 (1:1000) and 633 (1:500)
(Life Technologies) in blocking solution at RT for 1 hr. Neurons were then washed 3x with 1x PBS and mounted using ProLong
Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Life Technologies).
Immunohistochemistry in Human Brain Tissue
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the human autopsy tissue has been described previously (Zhang et al., 2015). To determine if nuclear
pore pathology is present in HD we performed IHC to analyze the subcellular distribution of RanGAP1 as previously described (Zhang
et al., 2015). Paraffin embedded sections of human brains from 5 adult HD, 5 juvenile HD (JHD) and 10 age/sex matched controls
were subjected to immunohistochemical staining. Human patient demographic information for postmortem control and HD/JHD
brain tissue is provided in Table S2. Paraffin sections (5um) from cerebellum, caudate and putamen (collectively labeled striatum),
and medial frontal cortex were deparaffinized in xylene then rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (100%, 100%, 95%, and
70%). Following rehydration, sections were steamed for 1 hr in HC-TekTM Epitope Retrieval Solution. Sections were then treated
with 50/50 mixture of acetone/methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Afterward, sections were permeabilized with
PBST (0.3% Triton X-100) then blocked overnight (4C) in 10% normal goat serum PBST (0.2% Triton X-100). To determine subcellular
distribution of RanGAP1 and NUP62, sections were stained overnight at 4C with anti-RanGAP1 (1:100, Santa Cruz H-180 Cat# SC-
25630) and anti-NUP62 (1:50, Santa Cruz H-122 Cat#SC25523). Sections were stained with goat anti-Rabbit-biotinylated (1:200,
Vector Laboratories) at RT for 1 hr. Following secondary incubation sections were treated with Vectastain Elite ABC HRP Kit (Vector
Laboratories, Cat#PK-6100) then developed with DAB (Vector Laboratories, Cat#SK-4100) for 2 min 30 s. After DAB development,
sections were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies). Once the mounting media cured, slides were sealed
with nail polish and then imaged using brightfield on the Zeiss Apotome as described in the Histological Quantification Strat-
egy (below).
Immunofluorescence in Human Brain Tissue
Human patient demographic information for postmortem control and HD/JHD brain tissue is provided in Table S2. Paraffin sections
(5mm) were deparaffinized in xylene (3x/5min each), then rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (100%, 100%, 95%, and 70%/5min
each), and washed in dH2O (3x/5min each). Following rehydration, sections were steamed for 1 hr in HC-TekTM Epitope Retrieval
Solution. Sections were then washed with 1x PBS (3x/5min each) and treated with a 50/50 mixture of acetone/methanol to block
endogenous peroxidase activity (10min). Afterward, sections were washed with 1x PBS (2x/5min each), permeabilized with 0.4%
Triton X-100 in 1x PBS (8min), washed with 1x PBS (3x/5min) and blocked with Serum-free Protein Block (DAKO, X0909/2hrs).
Next, sections were incubated with anti-RanGAP1 (1:100, Santa Cruz H-180 Cat# SC-25630) diluted in Antibody Diluent with Back-
ground Reducing Components (DAKO, S3022) overnight at 4�C. After incubating overnight, sections were washed in 1x PBS
(3x/5min each) then incubated with goat secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (1:1000) (Life Technologies) in Antibody
Diluent with Background Reducing Components at RT for 1 hr. Sections were then washed with 1x PBS (2x/5min each), 1x PBS and
Hoescht dye (dilution 1:5000/5 min), and then transferred to a final 1x PBS wash (2x/5min each). Sections were mounted using
ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Life Technologies). Once the mounting media cured, slides were sealed with nail polish
and subjected to confocal microscopy.
Histological Quantification Strategy
RanGAP1
To assess RanGAP1 pathology in HD/JHD human brain tissue, we randomly sampled 3-4 fields of view at 40x magnification from 3
different brain regions (cerebellum, striatum, frontal cortex) from 5 HD, 5 JHD, and 10 age/ sex-matched controls. Images were taken
primarily in gray matter regions anatomically. To best assess pathology across the tissue, we quantified the distribution of RanGAP1
in all cells stained positive for RanGAP1. Grey matter neurons and glia that displayed positive RanGAP1 staining were included in the
counts. The number of cells containing either mislocalized and/or aggregated RanGAP1 were included in the analysis. The percent-
age of cells containing abnormal subcellular localization or aggregation of RanGAP1 out of the total RanGAP1-positive cells were

e4
 quantified for each section (N = �300 cells). To determine statistical significance, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis
was performed and displayed as average percent. (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.002,***p < 0.0001).
NUP62
To quantify the extent of NUP62 pathology in HD/JHD human brain tissue we applied a similar method as stated above for RanGAP1.
Cells in each brain region with mislocalization of the NUP62 protein from the nuclear envelope to either the cytoplasm or an intense
nuclear staining were considered abnormal. Similarly, we performed a comprehensive sampling of multiple areas from each brain
region noted in the RanGAP1 study. Percent of total cells displaying NUP62 were counted using ImageJ cell counter. The percentage
of cells containing abnormal subcellular localization of NUP62 out of the total NUP62-positive cells were quantified for each section
(N = �300 cells). To determine statistical significance, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis was performed and displayed
as average percent. (*p < 0.05,**p < 0.002,***p < 0.0001).
Neuronal Differentiation
iPSC colonies were differentiated as described previously (PMID:26718628). Briefly, iPSCs were differentiated after reaching
60%–70% confluency, cells were washed with PBS pH7.4 and medium was switched to SLI medium (Advanced DMEM/F12
(ADF) supplemented with 2 mM Glutamax, 2% B27 without vitamin A (all Life Technologies), 10 mM SB431542 (Stem Cell Technol-
ogies), 1 mM LDN 193189 (Miltenyi Biotec) and 1.5 mM IWR1 (Tocris)) and cultured for 8 days with daily medium changes. At day 4 the
cells were passaged 1:2 with accutase. At day 8, cells were passaged as above and transferred into LI medium (ADF supplemented
with 2 mM Glutamax, 2% B27 without vitamin A, 0.2 mM LDN 193189 and 1.5 mM IWR1. Cells were cultured in LI medium, with daily
medium changes, until day 16, when they were dissociated from the dishes as above and frozen in Cryostor CS10 (StemCell Tech-
nologies) containing 10 mM Y27632 dihydrochloride until needed. Vials of day 16 cells were thawed in a 37�C water bath, washed in
ADF with 10 mM Y27632 dihydrochloride, centrifuged at 250 xg for 3 min, and re-suspended in 1 mL SCM1 medium (ADF supple-
mented with 2 mM Glutamax, 2% B27 supplement, 2 mM PD 0332991 (Tocris, USA), a CDK4/6 inhibitor, 10 mM DAPT (Tocris,
USA), 10 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, Peprotech), 10 mM Forskolin, 3 mM CHIR 99021, 300 mM g-amino butyric
acid (GABA, all Tocris), supplemented with CaCl2 to final concentration of 1.8 mM) and 200 mM Ascorbic acid (both Sigma-Aldrich).
A live/dead cell count was performed with trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich) using a hemocytometer to allow accurate plating of 80,000
cells per well of a 4 well chamber slide in 80 ml of SCM1 medium on 100 mg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-/hESC-qualified
Matrigel coated wells and allowed to settle for 60 min, prior to adding 500 ml SCM1 medium. A 50% medium change was performed
every 2-3 days, then fully changed on day 23 to SCM2 medium (1:1 ADF:Neurobasal A supplemented with 2 mM Glutamax, 2% B27
supplement, 2 mM PD 0332991, 10 ng/ml BDNF, 3 mM CHIR 99021, 1.8 mM CaCl2 and 200 mM Ascorbic acid). 1:1 medium changes
continued every 2-3 days. The cells were then fixed on day 37 with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and
shipped at 4�C in 1 x PBS pH 7.4.
Microscopy and Image Analysis
For all confocal imaging a Zeiss LSM 800 was used and quantifications were performed as previously described (Zhang et al., 2015).
In brief, Z-stack images were taken at 1.0 uM intervals at identical settings within given experiments and individual planes were then
projected into maximum intensity images for fluorescence intensity quantification using ImageJ. To determine quantity and diameter
of aggregates, and percent colocalization using Z-stack images, IMARIS software spot detection in conjunction with the colocaliza-
tion channel in 3D View was used in an unbiased manner.
Constructs
The HTT 22Q and 82Q constructs are full-length HTT expression plasmids described previously (Ratovitski et al., 2015). To generate
HD-RAN proteins, a 6xStop-(CAG)80 construct was used as previously described (Ban
˜ ez-Coronel et al., 2015). In brief, this is a CAG
and CAA HTT-exon1 minigenes with a 6x STOP codon cassette (two stops in each frame) upstream of HTT exon1 and C-terminal
epitope tags in each of the three reading frames.
Cell Death and Viability Assays
Nuclear Condensation Assay (% cell death)
Neurons were cotransfected at DIV5 with HTT 22Q or HTT 82Q and eGFP (10:1 ratio) with lipofectamine 2000 per the manufacturer’s
recommendations. After 48h of expression, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 33258 (bis-benzimide, Sigma-Aldrich). Treatments with KPT-350 were started at the time of transfection and neurons
were exposed to two different doses (0.01uM and 0.1uM). Treatments with Thiamet-G (0.5uM) were started either 24 hr or 44 hr after
transfection. Image acquisition was done using the Axiovision imaging software on an Axiovert 100 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss).
Analysis and quantification were performed using Volocity (Perkin-Elmer). Dapi intensity of GFP positive cells was measured. Cells
were considered alive when the nuclear intensity was less than 200% of the intensity of control healthy cells. Results are shown as
percentage of dead cells and each independent experiment represents the average of 4 wells per condition.
alamarBlue Assay (% cell viability)
The alamarBlue Cell Viability Reagent (Cat# DAL1025) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific and the cell viability assay was
performed as recommended by the manufacturer.

 Soluble/Insoluble Fractionation Experiments
Whole mouse striatum tissue was processed for soluble/insoluble fractionation as previously described (Ochaba et al., 2016). Protein
concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford), and 30 g of protein was reduced, loaded on 3%–8% bis-acrylamide
gels/4%–12% bis-tris mini gels (Life Technologies) for SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and nonspecific proteins
were blocked with SuperBlock Blocking Buffer (Thermo Scientific). Primary antibodies used were: Anti-Huntingtin (Millipore Cat#
MAB5492 RRID: AB_347723), Anti-RanGAP1 (Santa Cruz Cat# sc-25630) and anti-a-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# T6074 RRID:
AB_477582). Blots were developed using Pico/Dura Western Blotting Detection System (Pierce) and exposed to film for images. Pro-
tein quantification was performed using Scion Image analysis software. Band densities were normalized to a-tubulin.
Filter Retardation Assay
A total of 30 mg of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble protein in 200 mL of 2% SDS was boiled for 5 min and run through a dot
blot apparatus under a vacuum onto a cellulose acetate membrane. Membrane was then washed 3x with 0.1% SDS and then
blocked in 5% milk and subject to western blot analysis (previously described by Sontag et al., 2012; Wanker et al., 1999).
Experimental Design
Multiple independent experiments were carried out using several sample replicates as detailed in the figure legends. For example, in
Figure 4 involving the HD iPSC-derived neurons, each independent experiment represents the average of 6 wells total per condition
per line repeated over three separate differentiations. Sample sizes were not chosen based on a pre-specified effect size. All quan-
tifications and experiments were performed blinded. A strategy for randomization and/or stratification was not carried out.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t test or One-Way Analysis of Variance with the Turkey’s or Dunnet’s posthoc
test and the Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software).
