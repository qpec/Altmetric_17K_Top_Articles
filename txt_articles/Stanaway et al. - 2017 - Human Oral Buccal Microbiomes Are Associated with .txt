ABSTRACT In a longitudinal agricultural community cohort sampling of 65 adult
farmworkers and 52 adult nonfarmworkers, we investigated agricultural pesticide
exposure-associated changes in the oral buccal microbiota. We found a seasonally
persistent association between the detected blood concentration of the insecticide
azinphos-methyl and the taxonomic composition of the buccal swab oral micro-
biome. Blood and buccal samples were collected concurrently from individual sub-
jects in two seasons, spring/summer 2005 and winter 2006. Mass spectrometry
quantified blood concentrations of the organophosphate insecticide azinphos-
methyl. Buccal oral microbiome samples were 16S rRNA gene DNA sequenced, as-
signed to the bacterial taxonomy, and analyzed after “centered-log-ratio” transfor-
mation to handle the compositional nature of the proportional abundances of
bacteria per sample. Nonparametric analysis of the transformed microbiome data for
individuals with and without azinphos-methyl blood detection showed significant
perturbations in seven common bacterial taxa (�0.5% of sample mean read depth),
including significant reductions in members of the common oral bacterial genus
Streptococcus. Diversity in centered-log-ratio composition between individuals’micro-
biomes was also investigated using principal-component analysis (PCA) to reveal
two primary PCA clusters of microbiome types. The spring/summer “exposed” micro-
biome cluster with significantly less bacterial diversity was enriched for farmworkers
and contained 27 of the 30 individuals who also had azinphos-methyl agricultural
pesticide exposure detected in the blood.
IMPORTANCE In this study, we show in human subjects that organophosphate pes-
ticide exposure is associated with large-scale significant alterations of the oral buccal
microbiota composition, with extinctions of whole taxa suggested in some individu-
als. The persistence of this association from the spring/summer to the winter also
suggests that long-lasting effects on the commensal microbiota have occurred. The
important health-related outcomes of these agricultural community individuals’
pesticide-associated microbiome perturbations are not understood at this time. Fu-
ture investigations should index medical and dental records for common and
chronic diseases that may be interactively caused by this association between pesti-
cide exposure and microbiome alteration.

ral microbiome taxonomic diversity and community composition are variable both
within and between individuals, but as a whole microbiomes are relatively stable
in an individual adult developed host (1). Xenobiotic-microbiome interactions have
been targeted as important to drug metabolism and biotransformation (2) which also
makes the microbiome an important interaction term in the study of toxicology.
Understanding of the microbiome, environmental exposure, and potential impacts on
human health is currently growing: It has been elucidated that the microbiome can
affect cognition (3–5), metabolic syndrome and obesity (6–8), and social development
(9, 10). Many common environmental exposures (11–18) can change the microbiome
composition; these can be as simple as dietary differences (13, 14) and can be induced
by probiotics (16) and antibiotics (11). It has also been shown that community com-
position changes in the microbiome are persistent when they occur as the result of
extinction events and are rescued only when both nutrients (diet as environment) and
microbiome transplantation (reseeding or exposure) allow recovery (19). Additionally,
changes in the microbiome can have particularly compelling effects on tertiary phe-
notypes, which can affect the well-being of individuals. For example a Danish cohort
study of prenatal exposure to antibacterial agents found an increased risk of being
obese and overweight later in life in individuals with prenatal exposure to systemic
antibacterials (20). Another study, in Canada, showed that the alteration of microbial
compositions affects the risk of childhood asthma (21). These reports point at the
microbiome as a common determinant of other phenotypes with pleiotropic effects on
human health. Understanding the environmental effects of exposure on the micro-
biome is thus particularly important for public health.
Organophosphate pesticides (OPs), including azinphos-methyl, are a class of toxi-
cants that have had favor in the agricultural industry due to their relatively low
persistence in the environment (22, 23). Acute OP toxicity in higher organisms operates
primarily via a common mechanism of covalently binding a serine residue in the active
site of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE); inactivating this site results in a
systemic inhibition of enzyme activity (24). AChE cleaves the neurotransmitter acetyl-
choline, which is released in synapses when they fire. By inhibiting the enzyme cleavage
of acetylcholine, synapses are not allowed to reset, which may result in death at high
doses in adults and in neurodevelopmental abnormality in children at lower doses.
Residential studies of exposure to the OP chlorpyrifos have shown reductions in
working memory, reductions in intelligence, and brain anomalies in the babies of
exposed mothers (25–29), as well as in laboratory animal experiments (30). Studies of
acute exposure to these compounds have resulted in restrictions on the use of some
OPs in both occupational and residential settings. As a result, the EPA has phased out
any use of azinphos-methyl as of 30 September 2013 (http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/
reregistration/Azinphos-methyl/phaseout_fs.htm).
The �200-household Yakima Valley community agricultural cohort studied here
provides seasonal longitudinal measures of exposure to OPs using blood samples
collected in the spring/summer of 2005 and winter 2006 for adults and children (31).
Sequenced buccal samples from 117 adult individuals were used to determine propor-
tional abundances of oral microbiome bacteria detected in buccal swabs. Blood con-
centrations of azinphos-methyl have been determined by mass spectrometry in this
family-based community pesticide exposure study (31). Samples were collected in
spring/summer 2005 to measure pesticide exposure during the spring-to-summer
fruit-thinning season, when the workers had a high likelihood of OP exposure. The
winter 2006 samples assessed exposure during the off-season, when the likelihood of
exposure was low. Seventy individuals had buccal samples 16S rRNA sequenced from
both longitudinal collection seasons. Bacterial detection was performed by DNA se-
quencing of the V5 and V6 regions of the 16S rRNA gene from 206 adult buccal swab
samples. Counts of reads mapping to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (32) with
�97% sequence identity were converted to sample proportional abundances. The
microbiota OTUs were assigned bacterial taxonomies by the Ribosomal Database
Project (RDP) Classifier (33). Proportional taxonomic data fall into the category of

 compositional data analysis with simplex geometry, where the correlation structure of
reductions in abundance of one bacterial taxon is autocorrelated with compensatory
proportional increase in another taxon due to the remaining read counts being
occupied by other compositional members (34). The “centered log ratio” of each
sample’
s taxonomic proportional abundances applied here has been proposed as an
appropriate transformation to correct for this compositional nature of the data (34–36).
To avoid the complications due to limits of detection of rare member of the microbiota
when read depths vary between samples, we have chosen to analyze associations in
only common taxonomic genus members of the community composition (�0.5% mean
proportion of sample read depth) as defined by the spring/summer 2005 samples. We
adopted a slightly less stringent definition for common (�0.1% sample mean OTU
proportion) when conducting exploratory principal-component analysis (PCA) at the
OTU taxonomy resolution, in contrast to the genus-level taxonomy used in hypothesis
testing of exposed groups. To model read depths and the probability that we would
detect a taxonomic proportion, we used the negative binomial probability, Pr[missed
taxon] � e�pn, where p is the proportion of reads identified to that taxon and n is the
total number of reads for that sample (37, 38). This allowed us to establish criteria from
the samples’taxon mean proportions (e.g., genera � 0.005, OTUs � 0.001) for which
taxa to investigate at the read depth of sequencing sampled. Using only deeply
sequenced samples (minimum threshold, 2,500 reads; median, 38,454; mean, 55,321),
we fix a high probability at the median read depth, Pr[missed 0.001] � 1.99 � 10�17,
that we will observe the identified common taxon in the Dirichlet process if the taxon
exists in the sample above the proportion threshold. This common taxon analysis with
deeply sequenced samples mitigates the false zero inflation of nondetects, which can
occur when analyzing various depths of reads sampled and rarely detected taxa. We
have also adopted this common genus detection limit threshold to limit the number of
hypotheses tested to only common microbiota; to further reduce the possibility of bias,
nonparametric Wilcoxon’
s rank sum tests were used to test for differences in microbial
abundances. Using this approach, we identified robust false-discovery-adjusted asso-
ciations between the identified microbiota abundance and azinphos-methyl exposure
in this Hispanic Yakima Valley (Washington State) community agricultural cohort. We
additionally extended this result to an exploratory PCA of the centered-log-ratio
common OTU sample proportions present in buccal microbiomes of pesticide-exposed
individuals and other members of the Yakima Valley Hispanic community.
RESULTS
Azinphos-methyl blood exposure measures. The blood concentrations of
azinphos-methyl were measured by gas chromatography-linked high-resolution mass
spectrometry (GC-HR-MS) (39). Of the 117 individuals presented here, azinphos-methyl
was detected in 36 farmworkers and one nonfarmworker for whom we also had buccal
microbiome data passing quality control. The detected concentration range in individ-
uals was 0.021 to 6.192 ng azinphos-methyl/g blood serum. The limit of detection was
0.04 ng/g of plasma. One sample had a value less than the limit of detection that was
nonzero (0.021); this sample was treated as a nondetect. The remainder of the assayed
nondetects were zeros. In File S1 in the supplemental material we have formatted the
range of the numbers such that values from the limit of quantification (0.04) to 1 ng/g
(the median) are coded as 0.1 and values greater than 1 are coded as 1.1 ng/g plasma.
This was to help ensure another level of privacy for the human subjects in the
published form and does not affect the results, as we use the data categorically as
detect or nondetect in this analysis. Only farmworkers had detected levels of azinphos-
methyl in the spring/summer 2005 blood serum samples. All sampled individuals from
the spring/summer collection had an azinphos-methyl blood assay result. Blood sam-
ples collected in the winter 2006 nonspray season included one nonfarmworker sample
with a detected concentration of azinphos-methyl. This individual was a nondetect in
the matched spring/summer 2005 blood sample. Thirteen of 95 individuals with winter
microbiome data did not have blood sample azinphos-methyl assay results from the

 winter blood samples. They did have azinphos-methyl blood results from the spring/
summer collection, and this value was used to categorize these individuals as to their
blood detection category in the spring/summer season microbiome analysis. Since we
did not have a winter blood azinphos-methyl assay value for these individuals, they
were removed from the winter microbiome analyses. File S1 presents the azinphos-
methyl blood detection for those individuals for whom buccal 16S rRNA sequencing
also was performed.
Buccal bacterial taxonomic assignments. We observed DNA bands at �300 bp in
size by agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR amplicon of the 16S rRNA V5 and V6
regions, as expected. Sequencing of the PCR amplicons was performed with the Ion
Torrent DNA sequencer. Reads were quality control discarded if the primers were not
detected during trimming, if the read had more than three expected errors, or if
chimeras were detected (32). The remaining mean read length was 247 bp (221 to
279 bp), putting the effective error rate at less than 0.012 error per base after
quality control. The median sequencing depth of the 196 adult samples with more
than 2,500 reads passing quality control was 38,454 total reads (mean, 55,321),
making these samples deeply sequenced. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clus-
tering by USEARCH (32) with 97% read DNA sequence identity resulted in 2,520
OTUs with measured differences between taxonomy members in excess of 7.41
nucleotide bases [(1 � 0.97) � 247 bp], with fewer than three of these being
sequencing errors. These OTUs were classified to 286 bacterial reference taxono-
mies with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier java program (33). The
RDP classifier reports to the lowest taxonomic level it can, down to the genus level.
Among the common taxa we analyzed, suborders Micrococcineae and Actinomy-
cineae and the family Coriobacterineae are identified as the lowest taxonomy level
classified for these phylogenies. We refer to these taxa collectively as “genera” with
the genera in this text. Sample bacterial DNA sequences were mapped onto the
2,520 de novo OTU reference taxonomies with USEARCH (32). Reads that did not
match an OTU were assigned to the category OTU_NA and treated like the other
OTUs. File S1 provides a summary of read sequence counts for each sample’
s OTUs
as classified.
Nonparametric buccal bacterial analysis by azinphos-methyl blood detection
group. The microbiome data from buccal samples in spring/summer 2005 (n � 101)
and winter 2006 (n � 82) were categorized to factor groups by detection of azinphos-
methyl in blood. Twenty-nine spring/summer individuals and 26 winter individuals for
whom sequencing was performed had concurrent winter or previous spring/summer
blood azinphos-methyl detection by mass spectrometry as evidence of pesticide
exposure. Each buccal sample’
s genus proportion was transformed by the centered log
ratio, and the common genera (n � 22 genera, by spring/summer sample mean genus
proportion of �0.005) were tested by the Wilcoxon rank sum test (34, 35) between the
sample groups in which azinphos-methyl was detected and not detected. Table 1
presents the false-discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted (40) significance, the estimated non-
parametric location difference, and the unadjusted 95% confidence interval (CI) for
each genus’
s centered log ratio abundance between these two sample groups for both
seasons.
Seven taxa (Streptococcus, Micrococcineae, Gemella, Haemophilus, Halomonas, Acti-
nomycineae, and Granulicatella) were significantly reduced in the azinphos-methyl
group at an FDR of �0.1 in the spring/summer 2005 data (Table 1, bold). Two of these
(Streptococcus and Halomonas) maintained suggestive negative association significance
(P values of �0.01, FDR of �0.14) in the following winter (Table 1, underlined). We
observed winter values with the same direction but lower magnitude than the spring/
summer collection values for Wilcoxon’
s location difference between groups showing
reduced abundance in those with detected azinphos-methyl. This is not surprising, as
of the 26 individuals in the winter azinphos-methyl detection group, only one (the
nonfarmworker) had concurrent winter exposure measured in blood. This suggests a

 relaxation but persistence of the exposure effect into the winter. Mannheimia, Hermi-
niimonas, Actinobacillus, Neisseria, and Prevotella appear also to be suggestively per-
turbed in the spring/summer azinphos-methyl group. Actinobacillus and Prevotella were
suggestively (0.1 � FDR � 0.2) perturbed taxa that were decreased in the azinphos-
methyl detection group, whereas the other three were increased in relative abundance.
In Fig. 1 (spring/summer 2005) and Fig. 2 (winter 2006), each tested common taxon’
s
mean proportional abundance in buccal samples by blood azinphos-methyl detection
group is presented.
Samples sequenced at very high depth have zero proportions of some genera. This
can be seen in the whisker bars for many genera which extend to the 10�6 extreme
value. The lowest common population genus proportions measured that were nonzero
in individual samples were �10�5, two orders of magnitude below the mean propor-
tion threshold and one order of magnitude above the zero order of the log scale. Two
model assumptions were used in the application of the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank
sum to hypothesis testing of the taxonomic proportion centered log ratios by azinphos-
methyl detection groups: (i) we deeply sequenced samples with many reads, and (ii)
only common population sample mean taxonomic proportion members were tested.
These assumptions will mitigate the zero-inflation statistical effects that can occur in
count-based proportional data at various depths sampled. As an example, Streptococcus
was absent in three individuals (H161A, H153A, and H125A) with azinphos-methyl
detected in the spring/summer collection with sequenced samples at the depths (2,695,
3,884, and 5,788 reads; Pr[missed at 0.005], 1.4 � 10�6, 3.7 � 10�9, and 2.7 � 10�13,
respectively), whereas Streptococcus was detected in all individuals from the group with
azinphos-methyl not detected. Two samples (H160A and H149A) from the winter
collection with azinphos-methyl detected also had no Streptococcus detected in their
buccal microbiota data. The depth of sequencing for these samples (84,158 and 30,611
reads, respectively) gave very low probabilities (�10�183 and 10�67, respectively) at the
mean proportion threshold (0.005) that we missed Streptococcus in these individuals,

individuals and proportionally different between the exposure groups are likely due to
a true difference in the composition of the microbiota community structure. Strepto-

PCA exploration of oral buccal microbiota proportional abundances. The buccal
samples in the spring/summer 2005 and winter 2006 microbiome data revealed two
primary clusters of oral microbiome types in each season. A two-dimensional PCA of the
samples’centered log ratio of OTUs detected at �0.001 mean proportional abundance
is plotted in Fig. 3. The left panels depict the spring/summer scores for PC1 and PC2.
The right panels depict the winter OTUs in the spring/summer PC loading space as
supplementary out-of-sample PC1 and PC2 projections. In the plots for both seasons,
the point colors represent azinphos-methyl detection in blood as red and orange versus
blue nondetects in the top panels, farmworker occupational status as red versus
nonfarmworkers as blue in the middle panels, and the Gaussian model-based PC1
cluster calls as red for exposed (E) and blue for unexposed (U) clusters.
We observed two clusters evident in both seasons. The less aggregated left cluster
is visibly enriched for those individuals with detected azinphos-methyl in the blood
(Fig. 3, top panels) and farmworker status (middle panels). A similar clustering pattern
is also seen in the following winter 2006 buccal microbiomes (right panels), suggesting
a persistence of the microbiome state induced by previous exposure. Azinphos-methyl
was detected in only one nonfarmworker in the winter. If azinphos-methyl was
detected in either season, the color in the plots for both seasons reflects this
detection to track migration of pesticide-exposed subjects’microbiome types while
those same individuals are azinphos-methyl nondetects in the winter. t tests of the
PC1 scores for spring/summer and winter showed that the microbiome composition
PC1 score was significant for azinphos-methyl detection in the left direction of PC1.
The spring/summer mean azinphos-methyl group PC1 score was �2.8, versus 1.1 in
the nondetect samples. In the winter projection, the azinphos-methyl group PC1 mean
score was �1.6, while the nondetected samples had a PC1 mean score of 0.73. The
spring/summer P value of 4 � 10�7 and winter P value of 1.7 � 10�4 show a persistent
significant association between the buccal microbiome composition PC1 score and
azinphos-methyl detection. The data points for the samples with lower blood concen-
tration (�1 ng azinphos-methyl/g blood, the median) are colored orange to show that
there is no simple evidence of a dose response within the exposed individuals. t test P
values of �0.49 result from the comparison of PC1 values for high (red) and low
(orange) azinphos-methyl concentrations in spring/summer and winter. The middle
two panels of Fig. 3 show the farmworker-versus-nonfarmworker distribution in the
OTU microbiota PCA. In the spring/summer, the t test of the PC1 scores for farmworker
occupational status also showed that farmworkers had significantly lower mean micro-
biome PC1 scores (�1.01) than nonfarmworkers (1.16) (Welch’
s t test, P value of �0.01).
This farmworker occupational PC1 microbiome exposure was not persistent in the
winter (P value of �0.45). The bottom two panels present the mClust cluster call
assignments using the spring/summer 2005 PC1 as input to Gaussian model-based
cluster assignments (65). To train the model, the spring/summer 2005 PC1 data were
used to determine a decision value of 0.72 based on the midpoint between the
maximum PC1 value in the spring/summer left cluster and the minimum PC1 value in
the right cluster. This midpoint (0.72) between clusters was then used to classify the
winter 2006 buccal samples in the respective clusters based on the projection PC1 of
winter OTUs through the spring/summer PC1 loadings. This allowed us to compare PC1
cluster memberships between seasons in the space defined by the spring/summer
data. The left spring/summer and winter clusters are assumed as “exposed” based on
the coclustering of samples in which azinphos-methyl was detected in blood. Categor-
ical analysis of occupation status and cluster membership showed that the spring/
summer 2005 buccal microbiomes’left exposed PC1 cluster contains 57 individuals (38

summer sample reads). The top panels show mass spectrometry results for azinphos-methyl blood
detection as colored points (red, �1 ng/g; orange, �1 ng/g; blue, none detected) overlaid at the PC
coordinates of the buccal microbiome composition. The color coding in all panels represents azinphos-
methyl detection in either season so that the spring/summer azinphos-methyl detection may be
visualized with the winter microbiome PCA. The azinphos-methyl limit of detection is 0.04 ng/g of
plasma. The middle panels show the occupational status of individuals. The bottom panels depict the
PC1 Gaussian model-based cluster calls of the data projected in the PC coordinates. Two groups are
observed in both seasons; the left cluster group is enriched for farmworkers and azinphos-methyl
detection in blood samples. We interpret the left cluster as “exposed” based on the coclustering of
individuals with blood detection of azinphos-methyl and the enrichment of farmworkers. The OTU
percentage of variance explained (�18%) by PC1 and PC2 is reported in the axis labels. The right winter
panels are supplementary out of sample projections through the spring/summer PC1 and PC2 loadings.

 and one nonfarmworker with both buccal microbiome data and detected azinphos-
methyl concentrations in blood were compared with spring/summer buccal micro-
biome cluster membership, the left cluster, enriched with farmworkers, contained
nearly all (27/30) of the individuals with spring/summer microbiome data with
azinphos-methyl detected (including the one nonfarmworker with detection in the
winter) and 30 individuals in whom none was detected. The right cluster contained
almost exclusively individuals with nondetects of azinphos-methyl (41/44), except for
three farmworkers with azinphos-methyl detected in blood. Those with detected levels
of azinphos-methyl were significantly enriched in one of the two clusters from the
spring/summer 2005 buccal collection (P value of �6.5 � 10�6; odds ratio, �12.0; 95%
CI, 3.2 to 67). We refer to the left cluster enriched with farmworkers and containing the
majority of individuals with azinphos-methyl detection as the “exposed”cluster and to
the right cluster enriched with nonfarmworkers as the “unexposed” cluster. In winter
2006, 48 individuals (28 farmworkers and 20 nonfarmworkers) cluster in the left
exposed PC cluster and 34 individuals (14 farmworkers and 20 nonfarmworkers) in the
right unexposed cluster (Fisher’
s exact test P value of �0.18; odds ratio, �1.98; 95% CI,
0.74 to 5.4). Comparison of azinphos-methyl blood detection in any season to the
winter 2006 microbiome PC clusters showed that azinphos-methyl detection in blood
was still significantly enriched in the exposed cluster (Fisher’
s exact test P value of
�0.008; odds ratio, �4.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 17.2), with 21 individuals having azinphos-
methyl detected and 27 with none detected, compared to the unexposed cluster
containing five individuals with azinphos-methyl detected and 29 with none detected.
Many individuals with azinphos-methyl not detected in the blood (spring/summer,
30/57; winter, 27/48) cluster with individuals in whom it was detected. This would be
expected, as azinphos-methyl is metabolized and excreted with a half-life clearance of
�30 h (66), making the temporal window in which one must capture an exposure
important. We analyzed the persistence of cluster membership using the 70 individuals
with both spring/summer 2005 and winter 2006 microbiome sequence data. The
majority (94%, 66/70) of individuals sampled remained in their original cluster the
following winter. The one nonfarmworker with azinphos-methyl detected in the winter
of 2006 remained as an exposed cluster member in both seasons. This overall pattern
suggests a persistence to the exposed microbiome state as detected by model-based
PC1 clustering state. The two individuals who migrated from the exposed to the
unexposed microbiome cluster were a farmworker and a nonfarmworker. The farm-
worker who changed from the exposed to the unexposed cluster had azinphos-methyl
detected in blood in the spring/summer of 2005 but none detected in the winter.
Among just the exposed spring/summer cluster individuals, the composition effect of
the spring/summer azinphos-methyl-exposed cluster as measured by PC cluster mem-
bership at the later winter collection date had 95% (39/41) remaining in the exposed
cluster for both seasons. This cluster membership concordance in combination with the
extremely low bacterial taxon abundances measured for some exposed individuals
suggests that these microbiomes have undergone extinctions of the affected microbi-
ota with minor regrowth. The consequence of bacterial extinction with little regrowth
has been shown in mice when gut recolonization is not facilitated by microbiome
seeding (19). Two nonfarmworkers with no azinphos-methyl detected switched from
unexposed to exposed microbiome PC clusters, suggesting exposure events since the
last spring/summer’
s pesticide applications which we did not ascertain. We speculate
that more of the individuals from the unexposed cluster would have been found to
migrate to the exposed cluster if sample collections had continued to include a
following spring/summer 2006 agricultural cycle, when pesticide spraying begins again.
The nonfarmworkers’ microbiomes that cluster with individuals with detected
azinphos-methyl blood concentrations suggest that other, unobserved exposures have
occurred throughout the spring/summer and fall and into winter, as observed in the
one nonfarmworker with detected azinphos-methyl in the winter 2006 collection. We
suspect that stochastic differences in exposure in the home and community environ-
ment, as well as differential geographic location, azinphos-methyl dose, and clearance

nonparametric analysis of the common genus composition in the azinphos-methyl

 for vector group 1 (spring/summer). Streptococcus is the most increased in samples in
the direction of vector group 2 (spring/summer) to the unexposed cluster. Neisseria is
a common driver in the left exposed cluster direction of PC1. While not associated by
the nonparametric analyses, it is possible that Neisseria is less susceptible to the
exposure and, as the most common microbiota detected, is among the majority of the
reads left when other taxa are not present in the compositional relative abundance.
This leaves Neisseria as even more common in the exposed individuals. Neisseria is a
large genus with many diverse members, many of which do not normally cause disease
(67). The PC cluster discerning taxa is split as to which Fusobacterium OTUs are indicator
taxa for the respective exposure clusters, reflective of the Wilcoxon test, where it is not
significant (Table 1; Fig. 1 and 2). OTUs in loading vector groups 1 and 3 are pointed in
opposite directions of PC2 and not at the central mass in the left direction of PC1. This
heterogeneity in PC2 OTU genera may be explained in part by complex relationships in
the composition. The perturbed taxa may have lower abundance but are still present
in some exposed individual subjects, as seen for Streptococcus in the nonparametric
test. This PC2 heterogeneity may be interpreted as a less tractable community ecology
and homeostatic dysbiotic state that would occur when a normal apex community
member such as Streptococcus is depleted. This community perturbation would have
effects on many members of the community that are reliant on amino acids from
syntrophic metabolic niches (68) generated by Streptococcus. The winter exposed
cluster projected from these spring/summer OTU loadings (Fig. 3) also shows this less
aggregated “dysbiotic” pattern, where individuals are more heterogeneous in PC2 if
they have a low score in PC1.
Alpha diversity. Using both the azinphos-methyl detection group subject identities
and the cluster identity calls from PC analysis, we investigated the alpha species
richness diversity of the samples using the method of Chao and Shen (69). The Chao
diversity metric estimates the total number of organisms in a sample (count of OTUs)
given an adjustment based on the number of rare members observed. Figure 5
presents box plots of the seasons by azinphos-methyl detection group and exposure
cluster definitions for Chao alpha diversity values.
There is no significant difference in the OTU richness or diversity in the individuals
with azinphos-methyl detected in blood in either season. However, within both the
spring/summer and winter sample collections, the exposed PC cluster had significantly
reduced counts of organisms compared to the unexposed cluster as seen in the Chao
diversity (Welch’
s t test, P � 0.009).
DISCUSSION
We identify both a direct association and a principle-component clustering pattern
of individuals indicating that the compositional diversity profile of the oral buccal
microbiome is associated with environmental exposure consistent with an agricultural

 signal. This agricultural signal was measured in members of the Yakima Valley Hispanic
community in Washington State by blood concentrations of the organophosphate
insecticide azinphos-methyl and self-reported status as apple and pear orchard farm-
workers. These exposed individuals have reduced abundances of several common oral
indicator genera in this molecular epidemiology analysis of the buccal microbiota
profile of agricultural pome fruit orchard workers and community members. The
spring/summer 2005 sample collection timing targeted occupational farmworker and
community exposures at times when seasonal agricultural applications of azinphos-
methyl insecticide were known to occur. The microbiome PC cluster group membership
of nonfarmworkers and farmworkers exposed to azinphos-methyl suggests that many
individuals in the community may have unobserved exposures to pesticides which we
did not capture in blood. We observed one such exposure in a nonfarmworker with
blood azinphos-methyl detection from the winter 2006 collection season, when expo-
sure is not likely based on the seasonal nature of pesticide applications. This underlines
the need for data sets with fine temporal resolutions to discover modes of exposure for
community pesticide exposures. Previously published household dust data from this
same cohort suggest that azinphos-methyl exposures may occur via take-home path-
ways in cars and houses, where dry, stale air and low UV light conditions can allow
environmental persistence (70).
Only three nonfarmworker households had self-reported resident smokers, making
smoking unable to explain the scale of exposure difference associated here with the
microbiome composition. Soil bacteria have been known to degrade organophos-
phates since the early 1970s (71–75) and have been well studied with the intent of
developing a bioengineered solution to environmental remediation and industrial uses
(76). The earliest report (2013) that OPs such as azinphos-methyl may cause changes in
the composition of a host microbiome were conducted with chlorpyrifos in an intestinal
in vitro simulation reactor model and in vivo in the rat (77). Azinphos-methyl, chlorpyr-
ifos, and other OPs are closely related compounds with the same covalent mechanism
of primary toxicity, cholinesterase inactivation. The same authors showed that chronic
chlorpyrifos exposure changes the gut permeability and permits translocation of
bacteria across the rat intestine (78), and they quickly followed this in vivo rat model
study with a perinatal exposure study in which they also showed that dysbiotic
microbiota and exposure affected the intestinal development of the rat pups (79). Two
other very recent articles show that other OPs cause changes in the gut microbiome.
One of the OPs, trichlorfon, induced intestinal dysbiosis and reductions in many taxa at
low doses in the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) (80). In another study, low-level
dosing of mice with the organophosphate diazinon induced gut microbiota and
metabolomic changes in both sexes (81). These orthogonal studies provide evidence to
support our finding that human exposure to OPs is associated with the composition of
the human buccal microbiome. These studies also found significant reductions in the
abundances of Lactobacillus, the name-defining genus member of the order Lactoba-
cillales, of which Streptococcus is also a common phylogeny member. We also found
another common genus member of the order Lactobacillales, Granulicatella, to be
significantly decreased in abundance (Table 1, spring/summer) (�0.89; 95% CI differ-
ence, �1.64 to 0; P value of �0.026; FDR, �0.08) and an indicator OTU in cluster
analysis (Fig. 4). This suggests that the order Lactobacillales may in general be suscep-
tible to organophosphate pesticide exposure. The in vivo rat studies reported recently
(77–79) also showed increased intestinal permeability, reductions in tight-junction gene
expression, and increased translocation of bacteria to distal organs in chlorpyrifos-
dosed animals. The in vitro digester microbiome gut model did not contain a mem-
brane equivalent of the intestine or an immune system and showed differences in the
bacterial composition of human feces used to inoculate the culture system upon
organophosphate exposure to chlorpyrifos (77). These orthogonal findings suggest that
at least two independent mechanisms of microbiome perturbation exist, host mem-
brane permeability and direct microbial action. While our findings are limited to the
oral-buccal body site, these other authors have found that similar OP-induced pertur-

 bations can affect the gut microbiome and gut-derived neurotransmitters that are
systemically circulated. Gut metabolomic analysis of mice dosed with the OP diazinon
indicates that there are changes in gut-derived neurotransmitters and amino acid
metabolism products. These organophosphate microbiome-mediated neurotransmit-
ters can affect both host behavioral phenotypes and the niches of other gut bacteria
present (81). Future functional validations of antibiotic and other etiological properties
by in vitro and in vivo methods could distinguish between the membrane permeability,
immune and inflammatory responses, and potential for direct antimicrobial properties,
as these other studies suggest. The systemic bacterial ecology and interaction with the
human immune system and tight-junction tissue sites may contribute to the holistic
compositional effect in the buccal context. In any of these cases, agricultural pesticide
exposure is associated here with significant community composition changes in these
Hispanic individuals’buccal microbiomes. The community ecology of organisms sig-
nificantly dependent on Streptococcus will likely be affected, as it is the second most
common oral member detected with significant reductions in abundance.
We specifically timed the sampling of the population in the spring/summer and
winter seasons to capture the azinphos-methyl exposure well in the respective seasons
to well inform a molecular epidemiology exposure effect study such as this. The
farmworkers were actively working in the recently azinphos-methyl-sprayed orchards,
thinning the fruit and pruning, in the April to July 2005 spring/summer sample
collection time, as shown by direct blood detection as the measure of exposure. The
health impacts of these agricultural exposure-associated bacterial community struc-
tures and composition in the oral context and at other body sites (i.e., the gut, nasal
passages, etc.) have not been investigated in this cohort to date. Hispanics have a
disproportionate disease burden for many common diseases related to vasculature (i.e.,
diabetes and cardiovascular disease) (82–90) that have also been shown to have
microbiome-related disease variables in many other experimental contexts (91–104).
Dental health, bacterial infection, and peripheral vascular disease have many indepen-
dent associations (105), and some of the etiology could be affected by systemic
loosening of tight junctions as induced by organophosphates (78). In many other
contexts, environmental pollutants have been shown to affect the microbiome (106),
and here we show in humans the association between the composition of the micro-
biome and agricultural pesticide exposure.
Conclusions. Given the large microbiome differences at the oral buccal site, the
Hispanic cohort studied in this paper should continue to be followed for repeated
measures of buccal samples, with additional sampling, dental history, and investigation
of the pleiotropy to other health outcomes that may have resulted from these agri-
cultural exposures. These future investigations should also include molecular functional
studies on individual bacterial taxa and in community ecology system biology contexts
for their susceptibility to organophosphates. Additionally, more evaluation of the oral
microbiome composition as a simple-to-collect molecular biomarker of past exposures
as a whole for use in epidemiological studies would be able to greatly inform public
health and practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Agricultural cohort. The individuals in the cohort are �50% self-identified Hispanic farmworkers in
apple and pear orchards and �50% Hispanic nonfarmworker community members. The cohort was
established in 2005 and consisted of 200 adults and 200 children from the same households (31); 117 of
these individuals were studied for this buccal microbiome analysis report. The Center for Community
Health promotion of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center collected the samples from the human
subjects in the Yakima Valley agricultural region of Washington State. Samples are housed by the
University of Washington’
s Center for Child Environmental Health Risks Research.
Seasonal sampling design. Human oral buccal swabs and intravenous blood samples were col-
lected in spring/summer 2005 and winter 2006. The spring/summer 2005 sample collection was timed
for spring through early summer (April to July 2005), when farmworkers thin the fruit trees and were
potentially exposed to pesticides recently applied to control insects. The winter 2006 sample collection
was timed for the off-season (December 2005 to March 2006), when pesticides were not in use. Each
participating adult provided written informed consent. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’
s
Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the collection procedures for this study (file IR 5946).

 Measurements of azinphos-methyl blood concentrations. Isotope dilution gas chromatography-
linked high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HR-MS) (39) was used to determine blood serum concen-
trations of azinphos-methyl at the Pesticide Laboratory in the National Center for Environmental Health
at the Centers for Disease Control.
Collection of oral buccal mucosa samples. The Catch-All sample collection swab (Epicentre,
Madison, WI) was used for oral buccal mucosa sample collection. Participants were asked to not smoke,
eat, or drink (except water) for 30 min before sampling. The oral cavity was rinsed twice with water
before sampling. The swab was moved circularly inside the mouth on each cheek 20 times and then
stored in a 15-ml polypropylene tube with the tip down in 1 ml of RNAlater (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands).
Samples initially were stored in the field office at �10°
C and then were moved to a �80°
C freezer at the
University of Washington laboratory.
DNA preparation. Buccal swab samples were thawed and diluted in 9 ml of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The swabs were agitated in a circular motion continuously while the technician viewed the
PBS for oral buccal debris turbidity, and then the swab was discarded. The PBS suspensions were then
centrifuged at 400 � g at room temperature for 10 min, and the supernatants aspirated and discarded.
The manufacturer’
s protocol for the Maxwell 16 buccal swab LEV DNA purification kit (Promega,
Fitchburg, WI) for sample DNA extraction and elution was performed. Quantification of the sample
extract’
s double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) concentrations was performed with the Quant-iT PicoGreen
dsDNA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’
s instructions.
16S rRNA PCR and bead DNA cleanup. Eurofins (Eurofins Scientific, Luxembourg) primers, 10 ng of
sample DNA extract template, and EmeraldAmp GT PCR master mix (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.,
Mountain View, CA) were combined in PCR tubes with nuclease-free water to primer concentrations of
0.9 �M in a volume of 50 �l. Molecular-grade water negative-control blanks were also thermocycled with
the same reagents. The 16S ribosomal subunit RNA gene primers were designed following the gene
placement described by Cai et al. (107). Primer sequences targeted the 16S rRNA gene variable region
5 (V5) (ATTAGATACCCNGGTAG) and variable region 6 (V6) (CGACAGCCATGCANCACCT). Primer design
was bidirectional with four oligonucleotides in total, the two above-mentioned sequences and their
reverse complements. Primer synthesis included the Ion sequencing adaptors and DNA barcodes. All
primers with barcodes and sequencing adaptors are listed in File S1 in the supplemental material. PCR
mixtures were thermocycled using an MJ Research PTC 200 Peltier thermal cycler (MJ Research, St. Bruno,
Quebec, Canada) with the temperature cycle protocol (step 1, 95°
C for 10 min; step 2, 95°

C) and
is also in File S1. PCR amplicons were purified with the Agencourt AMPure XP PCR purification system
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).
Buccal DNA PCR amplicon pooling. Sample PCR amplicon fragment length and concentration for
sequencing were quantified with the Agilent high-sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa
Clara, CA). Amplicons with peaks greater than the high-sensitivity DNA reference markers were diluted
and reanalyzed. Amplicon templates were diluted to a concentration of �26 pM in low-Tris-EDTA
(low-TE) buffer and pooled for sequencing.
Template preparation, enrichment, and sequencing. DNA template preparation of the PCR
amplicons was performed using the Ion PGM Template OT2 400 kit (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA)
on the Ion OneTouch 2 system (Life Technologies), and sequencing was on the Ion Torrent PGM System
(Life Technologies) with the Ion PGM Sequencing 400 kit (Life Technologies) and Ion 318 Chip v2 (Life
Technologies). The default Ion Torrent Browser template program for 16S metagenomics target sequenc-
ing was used.
Read sequence preprocessing. Sequences for each barcoded sample were provided in individual
FASTQ files by the Ion Torrent native software suite. Quality control included removing reads without
both 5= and 3= primer sequences, primer trimming, and removing reads with greater than three expected
errors based on the PHRED base quality score (32). This reduced the error per read on an Ion Torrent
system to less than 0.012 (3/247 bp mean read length).
De novo 16S rRNA OTU reference generation. A single FASTQ file was concatenated from all
samples and quality controlled as stated above, resulting in a FASTA file. Exact duplicate-read derepli-
cation was performed via the USEARCH software (32) with the -derep_fullength and -sizeout flags. The
FASTA file was organized in descending order of number of observations, with singleton sequences
being removed using the USEARCH -minsize 2 -sortbysize functions. Sequence reads were then clustered
to operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) of 97% sequence identity, and the selected cluster consensus
sequence representative for each OTU cluster was output to an OTU FASTA file with the USEARCH
-cluster_otus function. Chimera read removal using the USEARCH -uchime_ref -strand plus flags and the
-db gold.fa reference file removed PCR artifacts from the OTU FASTA file. This file was labeled with the
USEARCH fasta_number.py script. The alignment target file for later use in individual sample read
sequence alignments to OTUs was then made with the USEARCH -makeudb function. OTU reference
sequences assignments to bacterial taxonomies down to the genus level were done with the default
settings of the RDP Classifier v2.6 java program (33). At a read sequence alignment of 0.97 in OTU
generation and with a mean read length of 247 bp, there will be in excess of �7.41 bases different
between OTUs, with fewer than 3 of the base differences between OTUs being sequencing errors
inflating the count of rare members of the OTU taxonomy. This margin between OTU sequence identity
definition and known sequencing error profile gives a balanced taxonomic resolution in the face of
known errors that all sequencers have and can be modeled efficiently with a PHRED score (108, 109).

 Sample 16S rRNA read sequence alignments. Read sequences were quality controlled as stated
above. Two-step chimera detection with the USEARCH -uchime_denovo and the USEARCH -uchime_ref
-strand plus flags with the -db gold.fa reference file removed PCR artifacts. Each sample’
s reads were
aligned by USEARCH with the command-line flags -usearch_global -strand both -id 0.97 to the de novo
OTU references to result in a count of reads matching each OTU.
Data analysis. Custom Perl scripts were used to organize taxonomy, sample OTU count, and sample
categorical descriptor tables from the 16S rRNA gene USEARCH alignment files and RDP Classifier into
formats imported to R for association and categorical analysis. The R package phyloseq (110) was used
with these tables for species richness Chao alpha diversity measures. Analyses in phyloseq were
conducted at the OTU classification level. When conducing total diversity measures that depend on the
numbers of singletons, doubletons, and so on in the tail of the distribution, no proportional frequency
cutoffs were employed. Whenever analyses required statistical comparisons between orthogonal detec-
tion groups (i.e., azinphos-methyl blood detection), OTUs were pooled by genera identified with the RDP
classifier; genera identified at �0.5% mean proportional abundance in the spring/summer 2005 sample
were used in subsequent analyses. PCA was performed using the R base function prcomp() with
centered-log-ratio-transformed proportions via the R package “compositions” (111). OTUs detected at
�0.1% mean proportion of the spring/summer 2005 sample reads were included in the PCA. This PCA
allowed an exploratory examination of the beta diversity differences between individuals within the
cohort. Cluster analysis of the spring/summer PC1 scores was performed with the mclust() R package (65).
PC loadings from the spring/summer data were used to project the winter OTU centered-log-ratio-
transformed proportions into the spring/summer data space generating projected PC1 and PC2 scores
and to assign cluster based on the spring/summer fit for the winter data. The base R implementations
of statistical tests (Fisher’
s exact test, Wilcoxon’
s rank sum test, and Welch’
s t test) were used where noted
to identify enrichment of categorical variables.
