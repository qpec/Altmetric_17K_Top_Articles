Introduction
Fucoidans are fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharides 
derived from brown seaweeds and marine invertebrates like 
sea urchins and sea cucumbers.1 Fucoidans consist of differ-
ent combinations of monosaccharides such as galactose, glu-
cose, and mannose, and other groups, including proteins, 
uronic acids, and acetyl groups. Natural polysaccharides such 
as fucoidans display the highest biological properties, nota-
bly anticancer properties, among macromolecules. Studies

Abstract
Objective: To determine the activity of fucoidan from Undaria pinnatifida (UPF) and Fucus vesiculosus (FVF) when given in 
combination of chemotherapy drugs using selected human breast or ovarian cancer orthotopic mouse models. Methods: 
Mice were inoculated with 1 × 106 cells of TOV-112d, MCF-7, or ZR-75 subcutaneously or SKOV3-GFP-Luc intraperitoneally 
on day 0. MCF-7 and ZR-75 mice were administered with estradiol valerate 2 mg/kg in 0.2 mL castor oil subcutaneously two 
days prior to cell inoculation. Mice were randomized to one of six arms (N = 10/arm) paclitaxel, UPF/paclitaxel, FVF/paclitaxel, 
tamoxifen, UPF/tamoxifen, or FVF/tamoxifen. Tumors were measured three times per week for 28 days. Results: Improved 
activity was observed with UPF or FVF in combination with tamoxifen in both the MCF-7 and ZR-75D breast cancer mouse 
models. Decreased activity of paclitaxel was observed when given in combination with UPF or FVF in both breast cancer 
mouse models. The combination of FVF/tamoxifen in the TOV-112d ovarian cancer mouse model had improved activity but 
no there was difference observed with the UPF/tamoxifen in either ovarian cancer mouse model. No difference was observed 
with combination of UPF or FVF with paclitaxel in human ovarian cancer SKOV3 or TOV-112d orthotopic mouse models. 
Conclusion: This study did confirm that UPF/FVF in combination with tamoxifen did not decrease tamoxifen activity in both 
breast and ovarian cancer, with some potential to improve activity compared to tamoxifen alone in breast cancers. Previous 
in vitro studies had suggested UPF and FVF had overall synergistic activity with paclitaxel; however, in the current in vivo human 
cancer mouse model studies there was no change in paclitaxel activity when given in combination with UPF or FVF in either 
of the two human ovarian cancer models. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that UPF or FVF given in combination with 
paclitaxel had a potential antagonistic effect in breast cancer models. Additional studies are warranted to delineate mechanisms 
contributing to variation in the in vivo activity when given in combination with paclitaxel. As a first step, a clinical pharmacokinetic 
study evaluating impact of FVF/UPF given in combination with chemotherapy in patients with solid tumors is underway.

on fucoidans have enumerated numerous biological proper-
ties that include anticoagulation and antithrombotic proper-
ties, antiviral, antitumor, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, 
and anticomplement functions.2-4
The potential toxicity and acquired drug resistance of 
certain cancers to chemotherapy drugs have warranted other 
options to improve the effectiveness of these drugs. New 
strategies have been proposed that use the cancer-treating 
properties of natural polysaccharides in conjunction with 
anticancer agents that lack physiochemical and biopharma-
ceutical properties to increase the success of these drugs.5-7 
Current treatment for ovarian and breast cancers includes 
paclitaxel and tamoxifen. Paclitaxel is a taxane compound 
extracted from the bark of the Pacific yew tree with antimi-
totic activity that will induce cell cycle arrest and ultimately 
apoptosis in treated cells. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen 
receptor modulator (SERM) agent, is used to treat 
ER-positive breast cancer in both early and late stages. 
Tamoxifen has shown limited success in patients with ovar-
ian cancer as a primary treatment, however, has had some 
limited use in management of recurrent ovarian cancer.8 
Studies have demonstrated that fucoidan has improved 
treatment efficiency with taxane compounds through 
enhancing apoptosis and cell growth induction.9,10
Previously, an in vitro screening of the Undaria pinnati-
fida (UPF) and Fucus vesiculosus (FVF), demonstrated that 
both compounds appeared to have overall synergistic activ-
ity on inhibition of cancer cell growth given in combination 
with paclitaxel or tamoxifen.11 Mathew and colleagues11 
conducted combined agent growth inhibition assays using 
IC50 concentration of chemotherapy agents, which included 
paclitaxel and tamoxifen, and 0.3 mg/mL fucoidan UPF and 
1.3 mg/mL fucoidan FVF. The interaction indices of these 
drug combinations were used to confirm the synergistic 
activity of fucoidan with paclitaxel and tamoxifen in vitro. 
Hypothetically, in vitro the fucoidans’ antiapoptotic activity 
contributes to the paclitaxel cytotoxicity and cytostatic 
activity of tamoxifen. The current study also proposed that 
in vivo the fucoidans’ immune modulating activity may 
improve the overall antitumor benefits that were observed in 
the in vitro studies.11 The overall objective of this study was 
to evaluate the potential for synergistic activity between 
fucoidan compounds and paclitaxel and tamoxifen for pos-
sible clinical use in cancer treatment regimens and for poten-
tial use in prevention of breast/ovarian cancer. This can be 
studied using in vivo orthotopic mouse models to evaluate 
and confirm synergistic activity in the presence of tumors.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
Fucoidans (UPF and FVF) were provided by Marinova Pty 
Ltd, 249 Kennedy Drive, Cambridge, TAS 7170 Australia. 
Fetal bovine serum (FBS), cell media, and trypsin-EDTA 
were purchased from GIBCO Invitrogen Co (Carlsbad, CA) 
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co (St Louis, MO).
Cell Culture
All human cancer cell lines, comprising MCF-7 and ZR-75 
(breast cancer cell lines), SKOV3-GFP-Luc and TOV112d 
(ovarian cancer cell lines), were obtained from the American 
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The 
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was propagated in a medium 
consisting of EMEM and the ZR-75 breast cancer cell line 
was propagated in a medium consisting of RPMI 1640. The 
SKOV3-GFP-Luc adenocarcinoma cell line was propagated 
with media consisting of McCoy’s 5a medium and TOV-
112d was propagated in a mixture of 1:1 MCDB 105 and 
medium 199 with 2 mM l-glutamine and Earle’s BSS (bal-
ances salt solution) adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium 
bicarbonate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mM 
sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines 
were grown in 75-cm2 culture flasks in 5% CO2 in air at 
37°C to 90% confluence. Cell lines used for this study were 
maintained for less than 15 passages to minimize the 
changes in cell line characteristics.
Orthotopic Mouse Models
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the institu-
tional animal care and use committee (IACUC) prior to ini-
tiating any animal work. For this study, 40 female nude 
mice, 6 to 8 weeks old, were obtained from Charles River 
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). All the mice 
weighed from 22 to 26 g. They were maintained 5 per cage 
in specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier room, with a tem-
perature of 22°C ± 3°C and 45°C ± 3°C relative humidity% 
and with free access to autoclaved food and reverse osmosis 
autoclaved water. The experiment procedures and the han-
dling of the mice were in strict accordance with the guid-
ance for the care and use of laboratory animals. MCF-7, 
ZR-75, TOV-112d cells (10 × 106) were dispersed in phos-
phate buffered saline with 20% matrigel and were injected 
subcutaneously whereas SKOV3-GFP-LUC (10 × 106) cells 
were injected intraperitoneally in female nu/nu mice on day 
zero. Each mouse grew one tumor on the dorsal surface. 
Tumor measurements were obtained three times per week 
with electronic calipers (Mitutoyo, Utsunomiya, Japan), 
intraperitoneal tumors were imaged under Kodak Imaging 
Station (Kodak, Rochester, NY) once in a week and abdom-
inal girth was measured by using measuring tape twice a 
week. Mice were monitored daily for signs/symptoms of 
morbidity, including but not limited to, lethargy, weight 
loss, anorexia, hunching, and so on. Mice were sacrificed 
via CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation, when 
tumor diameter was greater than 12 mm2, or if a 10% or 
 Burney et al 
757
greater decrease in body weight was found during the study 
period. At the end of the study, all the remaining mice were 
sacrificed. After sacrifice, the total tumor burden was deter-
mined by macroscopic dissection. Immediately after sacri-
fice, tumors were surgically removed from all mice and 
stored at −80°C.
Study Treatment
The mice were divided into six groups of ten for each cell 
line (N = 60 for four cell lines). There were six arms in this 
study: paclitaxel 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) given once 
 
(n = 10); paclitaxel 10 mg/kg IV with UPF 30.4 mg/kg in 
0.2 mL per os (PO) once daily via gastric gavage (n = 10); 
paclitaxel 10 mg/kg IV with FVF 30.4 mg/kg in 0.2 mL 
PO once daily via gastric gavage (n = 10); tamoxifen 10 
mg/kg in 0.2 mL PO once daily via gastric gavage 
 
(n = 10); tamoxifen 10 mg/kg PO in 0.2 mL PO once daily 
via gastric gavage with UPF 30.4 mg/kg in 0.2 mL PO 
once daily via gastric gavage (n = 10); or tamoxifen 
 
10 mg/kg in 0.2 mL PO once daily via gastric gavage with 
FVF 30.4 mg/kg in 0.2 mL PO once daily via gastric 
gavage (n = 10). Treatment was continued for total of 28 
days starting from day one.
Results
The UPF/paclitaxel combination did not alter tumor 
growth in human ovarian cancer orthotopic models with 
SKOV3-GFP-Luc or TOV-112d cell lines (Figure 1a). 
Similarly, there was no significant change or reduction of 
tumor growth with FVF/paclitaxel combination in human 
ovarian cancer orthotopic models with SKOV3-GFP-Luc 
or TOV-112d cell lines (Figure 2a). The SKOV3-GFP-Luc 
human ovarian cancer mouse model demonstrated no sig-
nificant change when treated with either UPF or FVF in 
combination with tamoxifen compared with tamoxifen 
alone (Figure 1b). In the TOV-112d human ovarian cancer 
models, FVF/tamoxifen showed a statistically significant 
(P < 0.05) increase in tumor growth. However, UPF/
tamoxifen had no significant effect on tumor growth rate 
in the TOV-112d group (Figure 2b).
In the MCF-7 breast cancer mouse model, the combina-
tion of UPF/paclitaxel and FVF/paclitaxel resulted in a

statistically significant increase of tumor growth (P < 0.05) 
when compared with paclitaxel alone (Figure 3a). In the 
ZR-75 human breast cancer mouse model, UPF/paclitaxel 
and FVF/paclitaxel also showed a statistically significant 
increase in tumor growth (P < 0.001) compared with pacli-
taxel alone (Figure 4a). In the MCF-7 human breast cancer 
mouse model, the UPF/tamoxifen (P < 0.001) and FVF/
tamoxifen (P < 0.001) combinations resulted in significant 
reduction of tumor growth compared with tamoxifen alone 
after 28 days supplementation (Figure 3b). Also, ZR-75 
mouse models showed similar reduction of tumor growth 
after treatment with UPF/tamoxifen (P < 0.001) and FVF/
tamoxifen (P <0 .001) in combination (Figure 4b).
Discussion
Evaluation of nutritional supplements with current anti-
cancer agents is of considerable interest. Fucoidan, a 
brown seaweed extract, has gained a lot of attention for its 
antitumor properties, which include the apoptotic destruc-
tion of cells. Current literature has suggested additive or 
synergistic activity of fucoidan in combination with che-
motherapy agents to improve clinical outcomes. Zhang 
and colleagues9 studied the therapeutic efficiency of fucoi-
dan in combination with cisplatin, tamoxifen, and pacli-
taxel and their findings showed an improvement in cell 
proliferation reduction in MCF-7 cell line. Another study 
by Atashrazm et al12 determined the synergistic potential 
of fucoidan with lapatinib and results showed a reduction 
in cell growth of a breast cancer cell line, OE33, through 
activity comparable to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
Treatment with fucoidan alone in orthotopic mouse mod-
els resulted in downregulation of vascular endothelial 
growth factor expression in 4T1 breast cancer cell line and 
reduction in tumor weight.13 These results are in accor-
dance with this study which demonstrated the reduction of

tumor cell growth in MCF-7 and ZR-75 human breast can-
cer cell lines with tamoxifen in combination with both 
fucoidans, UPF and FVF.
However, the results in this study also showed an increase 
in cell growth with fucoidans in combination with paclitaxel 
compared with paclitaxel alone in MCF-7 and ZR-75 cell 
lines. However, both fucoidans with paclitaxel or tamoxifen 
showed no significant reduction or inhibition of tumor cell 
growth in ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV3-GFP-Luc and 
TOV112d. It can be noted that in this study, treatment con-
centration of UPF and FVF in orthotopic mice models was 
30.4 mg/kg, which translates to an estimated 0.76 mg/mL 
dose concentration considering average weight of mouse to 
be 25 g and assuming 100% oral absorption, which initial 
pharmacokinetic studies estimate to be less than 3%.14 This 
is slightly above the concentration of UPF (0.3 mg/mL) and 
below the concentration of FVF (1.3 mg/mL) used to 
determine IC50 concentrations in the previous study.11 Likely 
the in vitro application of concentrations above achievable 
concentrations in vivo contributed to the inconsistencies in 
the translation of the data from the in vitro studies to the in 
vivo human cancer mouse models.
Based on the findings of this study, the next step is to 
evaluate the benefits of adding supplementation with fucoi-
dans with tamoxifen in clinical setting for patients undergo-
ing treatment for breast cancer. Because of tamoxifen’s 
unique metabolism, pharmacokinetic/safety studies should 
be completed to define efficacy and evaluate drug/supple-
ment interactions before proceeding to phase II studies. 
Toxicology studies with UPF using dose of 1350 mg/kg/d 
for four weeks in rats showed it to be safe with regard to 
oral safety and with no abnormal clinical manifestations or 
alterations to body biochemistry.15 Li et al16 have shown no 
significant harmful changes when 300 mg/kg body weight

per day of fucoidans were administered in rat models. The 
results of the fucoidans in breast cancer models were statis-
tically significant, supporting an avenue to continue to 
explore and define the role of fucoidans in optimizing can-
cer therapy. Furthermore, additional preclinical studies are 
necessary to provide statistical significance to support our 
finding that fucoidan in combination with paclitaxel and 
tamoxifen in ovarian cancer cell models does not have any 
therapeutic effect on reducing tumor growth.
The strengths of this study are that it was the first study 
to look at the tumor inhibitory effect of fucoidan in combi-
nation with chemotherapy agents as well as tamoxifen in 
both in vivo human ovarian cancer and breast cancer ortho-
topic mouse models. There are currently no data available 
to determine concentrations achieved in the gastrointestinal 
tract where most of the fucoidans’ proposed immune 
modulation would occur. A limitation of this study was that 
tumor growth activity did not reach statistical significance 
in TOV-112d and SKOV3-GPF-Luc human ovarian cancer 
cell models. Therefore, data to support the hypothesis that 
fucoidan in combination with paclitaxel and tamoxifen 
results in synergistic/additive activity was not achieved.
This study did confirm that UPF/FVF in combination with 
tamoxifen did not decrease tamoxifen activity in both breast 
and ovarian cancer with some potential to improve activity 
compared to tamoxifen alone in breast cancers. Previous in 
vitro studies had suggested UPF and FVF had overall synergis-
tic activity with paclitaxel; however, in the current in vivo 
human cancer mouse model studies there was no change in 
paclitaxel activity when given in combination with UPF or 
FVF in either of the two human ovarian cancer models. 
Furthermore, this study demonstrated that UPF or FVF given

in combination with paclitaxel had a potential antagonistic 
effect in breast cancer models. Additional studies are war-
ranted to delineate mechanisms contributing to variation in the 
in vivo activity when given in combination with paclitaxel. As 
a first step, a clinical pharmacokinetic study evaluating impact 
of FVF/UPF given in combination with chemotherapy in 
patients with solid tumors is currently underway.
