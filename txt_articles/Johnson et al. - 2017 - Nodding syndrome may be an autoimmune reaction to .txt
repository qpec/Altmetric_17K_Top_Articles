Nodding syndrome is an epileptic disorder of unknown etiology that occurs in children in East Africa. There is
an epidemiological association with Onchocerca volvulus, the parasitic worm that causes onchocerciasis (river
blindness), but there is limited evidence that the parasite itself is neuroinvasive. We hypothesized that nodding
syndrome may be an autoimmune-mediated disease. Using protein chip methodology, we detected autoanti-
bodies to leiomodin-1 more abundantly in patients with nodding syndrome compared to unaffected controls
from the same village. Leiomodin-1 autoantibodies were found in both the sera and cerebrospinal fluid of patients
with nodding syndrome. Leiomodin-1 was found to be expressed in mature and developing human neurons in vitro
and was localized in mouse brain to the CA3 region of the hippocampus, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and cor-
tical neurons, structures that also appear to be affected in patients with nodding syndrome. Antibodies targeting
leiomodin-1 were neurotoxic in vitro, and leiomodin-1 antibodies purified from patients with nodding syndrome
were cross-reactive with O. volvulus antigens. This study provides initial evidence supporting the hypothesis that
nodding syndrome is an autoimmune epileptic disorder caused by molecular mimicry with O. volvulus antigens and
suggests that patients may benefit from immunomodulatory therapies.
INTRODUCTION
Nodding syndrome is an epileptic disorder typified by atonic seizures
that affects children between 5 and 15 years of age in geographically
localized regions of Tanzania, Uganda, and the Republic of South Su-
dan (1). The atonic seizures are characterized by a head-dropping mo-
tion, but patients may also develop clonic-tonic seizures, atypical
absence seizures, mild to severe cognitive impairment, and cerebellar,
cerebral, and hippocampal atrophy (1–5). Nodding syndrome is a
disabling disease, resulting in neurological deterioration and, in some
cases, death (1, 2). The clinical characteristics of nodding syndrome are
distinct from other epileptic disorders in children.
Because of an increase in reports of nodding syndrome (6), rigorous
efforts to understand this disease have been undertaken (2). These studies
have resulted in a consensus case definition and clinical characterization
of nodding syndrome (1–4). However, the pathophysiology and etiology
of nodding syndrome remain unknown. Extensive investigation of
environmental neurotoxins, nutritional deficiencies, genetic disorders, or
infectious organisms has been unrevealing (2). An increased rate of
nodding syndrome in areas where the parasite Onchocerca volvulus is
endemic led to the hypothesis that the infection may play a role in
nodding syndrome pathogenesis (6). Case-control studies have
consistently documented an association between nodding syndrome
and O. volvulus infection but have failed to find evidence of invasion
of the brain or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the mature parasite (2, 5, 7),
although prelarval worms (microfilariae) have been detected in the CSF
(8). It has thus been hypothesized that an immune-mediated mecha-
nism may be involved. Previous investigations of autoantibodies known
to be associated with neurological illness have been unrevealing in
nodding syndrome [as described in (2, 9)]. The aim of the current study
was to further investigate whether autoantibodies could be a contributing
factor to the pathogenesis of nodding syndrome.
RESULTS
Autoantibodies in patients with nodding syndrome
An unbiased approach for profiling autoantibodies using a protein
array detected a >2-fold increase in reactivity to 167 probes represent-
ing 137 individual proteins and a >100-fold increase in four proteins
in pooled sera from patients with nodding syndrome compared to
pooled sera from unaffected control villagers (Fig. 1A and table S1).
The top two signals were from autoantibodies to leiomodin-1 (increased
33,000-fold) and autoantibodies to DJ-1 (increased 750-fold). Further
examination of the top four enriched autoantibodies in patients with
nodding syndrome (table S2) demonstrated differential immuno-
reactivity by immunoblot analyses between pooled serum samples
from patients with nodding syndrome and controls for only two
of the proteins, leiomodin-1 and DJ-1 (Fig. 1B). However, only anti-
bodies to leiomodin-1 (and not to DJ-1) were detected in the CSF of
patients with nodding syndrome (Fig. 1C). Serum samples from each
of the patients with nodding syndrome and unaffected village controls
were analyzed for reactivity to leiomodin-1 by enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 1D and Table 1); a subset of samples was

 confirmed by immunoprecipitation (fig. S1). Leiomodin-1 antibodies
were more frequently detected in patients with nodding syndrome com-
pared to unaffected village controls: 29 of 55 (52.7%) patients with
nodding syndrome versus 17 of 55 (30.9%) unaffected village controls
[P = 0.024, mOR, 2.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1 to 6.5]. In
patients with nodding syndrome with determined O. volvulus status
(n = 54), 44 patients were O. volvulus–positive. Of these, 24 patients
(54.5%) were positive for both O. volvulus and leiomodin-1 antibodies.
Twenty patients (45.5%) were O. volvulus–positive and leiomodin-1 antibody–
negative. In unaffected village controls, there were 54 individuals with
determined O. volvulus status. Of these controls, 29 were O. volvulus–positive.
Twelve of these 29 controls (41.4%) were leiomodin-1 antibody–positive
and O. volvulus–positive, and 58.6% were leiomodin-1 antibody–
negative and O. volvulus–positive. Thus, in patients with nodding
syndrome, there was a higher percentage of O. volvulus–positive status
in leiomodin-1 antibody–positive cases than in leiomodin-1 antibody–
negative cases. The same did not hold
true for unaffected village controls.
Additionally, patients with nodding
syndrome had increased titers of anti-
bodies to leiomodin-1 compared to un-
affected village controls (P = 0.04,
ANOVA with Holm-Sidak correction
for multiple comparisons). Both immu-
noglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies
directed against leiomodin-1 were pres-
ent in the sera of patients with nodding
syndrome (fig. S2). Fifty percent (8 of
16) of patients with nodding syndrome
showed antibodies to leiomodin-1 in
the CSF, whereas none (0 of 8) of the
North American patients with epilepsy,
as a control, demonstrated antibodies to
leiomodin-1 in their CSF (P = 0.022,
Fisher’s exact test).
To confirm that antibodies in the sera
from patients with nodding syndrome
recognized leiomodin-1, human embry-
onic kidney (HEK) cells transfected
with leiomodin-1 DNA were co-stained
with rabbit anti–leiomodin-1 antibody
and sera from a patient with leiomodin-1
antibodies or sera from an unaffected
village control without antibodies to
leiomodin-1. Colocalization of nodding
syndrome patient sera, but not the sera
from unaffected village controls, with
leiomodin-1 was observed (Fig. 1E and
fig. S3). To confirm that the antibodies
in the CSF from patients recognized
neuronal leiomodin-1, we stained hu-
man neurons with CSF from two pa-
tients with leiomodin-1 antibodies in
conunction with rabbit anti–leiomodin-1.
Colocalization of the human anti-
bodies from CSF and the rabbit anti–
leiomodin-1 antibodies was observed
on neurons (fig. S4).
Expression of leiomodin-1 in the CNS
Because leiomodin-1 has been reported to be expressed primarily in
smooth muscle tissue and in the thyroid (10, 11), we next examined
the expression of leiomodin-1 in the central nervous system (CNS).
Using multiple approaches, we confirmed that leiomodin-1 is ex-
pressed in the CNS and in neurons. Immunostaining of human neurons
with rabbit anti–leiomodin-1 antibody demonstrated leiomodin-1 expres-
sion throughout the cytoplasm of neurons (Fig. 2A). Immunoblots
demonstrated the presence of leiomodin-1 in adult human brain homo-
genates (Fig. 2B). Localization of leiomodin-1 in mouse brain by im-
munohistochemistry using rabbit anti–leiomodin-1 antibody showed
that it was focally expressed in cortical neurons in the cerebral cortex,
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and pyramidal cells in the CA3 region
of the hippocampus. Other regions of the hippocampus including CA1
and the dentate gyrus did not express leiomodin-1 (Fig. 2C). Smooth
muscle from blood vessels and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2D) were used as

 positive controls. Mining publicly available RNA sequencing data, we con-
firmed that leiomodin-1 is expressed in the human brain (fig. S5). This was
confirmed by detecting leiomodin-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in human
brain tissue extracts and human neuronal stem cells and cultured neurons
(Fig. 2E and table S3). There was a higher expression of leiomodin-
1 mRNA in brain extracts compared to the expression in human neural
stem cells and differentiated neurons.
Leiomodin-1 antibodies are neurotoxic
To determine whether antibodies to leiomodin-1 could cause neuronal
dysfunction, we treated cultured human neurons with leiomodin-1 anti-
bodies or control serum and assayed them for viability. Neurons treated
with anti–leiomodin-1 antibody showed decreased viability (mean vi-
ability ± SD, 40.9 ± 9.3%) compared to treatment with normal rabbit
sera (mean viability ± SD, 75.5 ± 12.8%; P = 3.4 × 10−9, two-way Student’s
paired t test) (Fig. 3A and table S4). Neurons treated with sera from
a patient with nodding syndrome (1:200) with detectable leiomodin-
1 antibodies demonstrated neurotoxicity (mean viability ± SD, 14.7 ±
1.0%) that was abrogated by antibody depletion from the patient sera
(mean viability ± SD, 78 ± 12.8%; P = 0.0003, two-way Student’s
paired t test) (Fig. 3B and table S5). Neurons exposed to sera from
patients with detectable leiomodin-1 antibodies (n = 4) showed
increased neurotoxicity (mean toxicity ± SD, 52.71 ± 24.9%) com-
pared to sera selectively depleted of leiomodin-1 antibodies by affinity
purification (mean toxicity ± SD, 33.16 ± 19.8%; P = 0.0048, two-way
Student’s paired t test) (Fig. 3C and table S6). The neurotoxicity induced
by autoantibodies to leiomodin-1 from patients with nodding syndrome
in conjunction with the expression of leiomodin-1 in the CNS suggests
that antibodies directed against leiomodin-1 may play a role in nodding
syndrome disease pathogenesis.
Leiomodin-1 antibodies cross-react with
O. volvulus proteins
Epidemiological studies have indicated that nodding syndrome is
associated with O. volvulus (2, 4–6, 12–14). Therefore, we investigated
whether autoantibodies to leiomodin-1 could be related to infection
with O. volvulus. Screening of antigen prepared from adult male
and female O. volvulus with pooled sera from patients with nodding
syndrome and from unaffected village controls by immunoblotting
showed limited differential immunoreactivity profiles (Fig. 4A). Bands
to which nodding syndrome patient sera demonstrated increased im-
munoreactivity were excised from the gel and identified by mass spec-
trometry (table S7). O. volvulus tropomyosin was one of the proteins
identified. O. volvulus tropomyosin protein has 25.5% sequence identity
and 37% sequence similarity to leiomodin-1 (Fig. 4B). Although the
overall homology is low, regional homology analyses indicated that
the conserved N-terminal DAIKK sequence of O. volvulus tropomyosin
(15), amino acids 2 to 14, showed 57.1% identity and 71.4% similarity to
amino acids 107 to 117 of human leiomodin-1. The conserved signature
sequence LKEAExRAE (15), amino acids 230 to 240 of O. volvulus
tropomyosin, showed 66.7% identity and 83.3% similarity to amino
acids 362 to 372 of human leiomodin-1. Although many of the proteins
from O. volvulus remain uncharacterized, we hypothesized that there
may be homology between human leiomodin-1, a member of the tro-
pomodulin gene family (10), and tropomodulin from O. volvulus.
Modeling of human leiomodin-1 and O. volvulus tropomodulin demon-
strated regions of structural overlap (Fig. 4C, left). Further modeling
showed that the second hit in our screen, human DJ-1, also had strong
homology to the O. volvulus homolog (Fig. 4C, right). This in silico analysis
suggested that infection with O. volvulus may generate antibodies cross-
reactive to host proteins. We therefore aimed to determine whether
autoantibodies to leiomodin-1 cross-reacted with O. volvulus proteins.
Affinity-purified leiomodin-1 antibodies from four patients with
nodding syndrome showed a single band after addition of lysates from
HEK cells expressing leiomodin-1, indicating that these antibodies were
specific for human leiomodin-1 (Fig. 4D). However, these antibodies
also robustly recognized several proteins in an O. volvulus whole-organism
lysate, suggesting that several O. volvulus proteins may share homology with
human leiomodin-1 (Fig. 4D). Further confirmation of the cross-reactive
nature of these antibodies was demonstrated by competing for the
binding of leiomodin-1 by nodding syndrome patient sera (n = 4) after
preincubation of patient sera with either O. volvulus whole-organism lysate
or a nonspecific protein, BSA. Sera that were preincubated with O. volvulus
lysate showed decreased immunoreactivity to leiomodin-1 (mean OD, 78.3 ±
89.3) compared to sera preincubated with BSA (mean OD, 236.7 ± 124; P =
0.042, one-way Student’s unpaired t test) (Fig. 4E and table S8).
DISCUSSION
Nodding syndrome is a devastating disease for children, families, and
communities. A 2012–2013 survey estimated that there were about 2000
cases in Northern Uganda alone (2, 16). Despite international efforts to
identify the etiological factors, the pathophysiology of nodding syn-
drome remains elusive, and no cure is available (12). Here, we hypothe-
sized that an autoimmune process contributes to nodding syndrome.
To address this hypothesis, we compared affected patients and un-
affected village controls by conducting detailed immunotyping for auto-
reactive antibodies. Our initial attempt to discover autoantibodies by

 using a protein chip showed the presence of antibodies to multiple anti-
gens. Four of these had levels greater than 100-fold higher in patients
compared to the unaffected village controls, demarcating them from
the other antibodies that showed less than a 10-fold increase. Of the four
proteins, autoantibodies to only two, DJ-1 and leiomodin-1, were con-
firmed biochemically to have increased reactivity in patients compared
to controls. Although we were able to con-
firm the presence of antibodies to DJ-1 in
sera from patients with nodding syn-
drome, it was not detectable in CSF. In
contrast, antibodies to leiomodin-1 were
present in the sera and CSF of about half
the patients with nodding syndrome.
Heretofore, leiomodin-1 was known to
be present primarily in muscle (10, 11),
but its location in the brain had not been
characterized. Further analyses in our
study showed that leiomodin-1 transcripts
and protein were detectable in the CNS.
The immune response to leiomodin-1 is
of particular interest because we demon-
strated that leiomodin-1 is expressed in
neurons in distinct regions of the mouse
brain, the cerebral cortex, the CA3 region
of the hippocampus, and Purkinje cells in
the cerebellum, areas that correspond with
those hypothesized to be associated with
the clinical manifestations of nodding syn-
drome. For example, patients with nodding
syndrome have cerebral atrophy and asso-
ciated cognitive abnormalities (1, 3, 4, 17).
In animal models of epilepsy, retraction
of dendrites and loss of neurons in the
CA3 region are associated with epilepto-
genesis (18). This is also consistent with
hippocampal and cerebellar atrophy
seen upon magnetic resonance imaging
of some patients with nodding syndrome
(1, 3–5). Leiomodin-1, previously described
as human 64-kDa autoantigen D1 (19),
acts as an actin nucleator in muscle cells
(20). Except for the description of cold
extremities (3), patients with nodding syn-
drome are not known to develop vascu-
lar symptoms. The specificity of CNS
involvement may indicate that leiomodin-1
is differentially expressed, modified, or regu-
lated in the CNS compared to other tissue
compartments.
In contrast to other autoimmune epi-
lepsies, where the antibodies are targeted
against surface receptors such as AMPAR
(AMPA-selective glutamate receptor),
NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor),
AMPAR (AMPA-selective glutamate recep-
tors), GABAR (g-aminobutyric acid recep-
tor), VGKC (voltage-gated potassium
channel), and the glycine receptor (21),
leiomodin-1 is an intracellular antigen.
Other intracellular antigens that have been associated with encephalitis
and epilepsies include Hu, CRMP-5 (collapsin response mediator pro-
tein 5), GAD-65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65), and Ma (21). It may
be that autoreactive T cells are the main mediators of the immuno-
pathology of nodding syndrome with the production of leiomodin-
1 autoantibodies as a consequence of this T cell activation. Alternatively,

 antibodies to leiomodin-1 may be directly contributing to disease. Al-
though antibodies to intracellular antigens are not classically thought
to be pathogenic, antibodies to intracellular neuronal targets such as am-
phiphysin have been shown to cause stiff person syndrome in an animal
model (22). While the molecular mechanisms for antibodies that target
intracellular antigens are not completely elucidated, some studies suggest
cell-penetrating antibodies (22), alterations in antigen localization during
apoptosis (23, 24), and changes in antigen expression within the target
tissue during repair of injury (25). Additional studies of leiomodin-1 ex-
pression in the CNS, especially confirming subcellular localization during
damage and repair processes, will be important.
Epidemiological studies have consistently shown an association
between nodding syndrome and infection with O. volvulus (2, 4–6).
We found that leiomodin-1 antibodies cross-reacted robustly with
O. volvulus antigens and found sequence and structural homology
between leiomodin-1 and O. volvulus tropomyosin and tropomodulin.
Not all O. volvulus proteins have been fully characterized, and other
parasite proteins could share homology. Further, our second hit, DJ-1,
had structural homology to its O. volvulus homolog. We speculate that
the typical immune response to O. volvulus infection may be generating
multiple cross-reactive antibodies and that, in some patients, autoanti-
bodies develop, enter the CNS, and cause distinct pathology recognized
as nodding syndrome. However, not all patients with nodding syndrome
had detectable antibodies to leiomodin-1. We speculate that nodding
syndrome may not be a single antibody syndrome, and other investi-
gations have suggested that patients with nodding syndrome may have
antibodies to other neuronal proteins (26). The patients we investi-
gated had multiple autoantibodies, as demonstrated by proteomics.
Here, we have characterized the autoantibody with the highest titer
that best distinguished the patients with nodding syndrome from
unaffected village controls. This syndrome is likely not a disease
mediated by a single immune specificity.
We postulate that the age of onset of nodding syndrome may be
related to the initial burden of exposure to O. volvulus in early childhood.
However, it is not clear why the syndrome is not seen in adults. It is
possible that the developing immune system, or ongoing brain devel-
opment, may make children more vulnerable to nodding syndrome. Ad-
ditionally, some patients also have delayed sexual development, suggesting
pituitary-hypothalamic dysfunction (27). In the current study, we have
not investigated whether leiomodin-1 is expressed in these regions of
the brain. The geographical restriction of nodding syndrome relative to
the presence of O. volvulus may be due to interruption of parasite con-
trol in these regions (28) or may suggest that other as yet unidentified
cofactors may also contribute to the pathobiology of nodding syndrome.
This study has several limitations that future studies need to ad-
dress. We examined only a limited number of well-defined patients
and unaffected village controls collected in the public health responses
in Uganda and South Sudan in this cross-sectional discovery study.
Although we found a statistically significant association between
leiomodin-1antibodiesandnodding syndrome, one-thirdof unaffected
village controls also had detectable antibodies. It may be that these in-
dividuals had early, asymptomatic disease that would progress to recog-
nizable nodding syndrome. However, in this cross-sectional study, it
was not possible to determine whether leiomodin-1 serum antibodies
were an early marker of disease. Future studies, especially longitudinal
studies examining leiomodin-1 antibody titers, are needed, but because
of the nature of the epidemic and the remote location, such studies will
be challenging. It is possible that other pathophysiological changes in
patients with nodding syndrome allow for penetration of leiomodin-1
antibodies into the CNS. However, at the time of sample collection,
it was not appropriate to collect CSF from village children not dis-
playing neurological disease. Future studies may be able to determine
whether differences in antibody status in the CNS correlate with dis-
ease. Additionally, using a limited number of patients with antibodies to
leiomodin-1, we demonstrated that these antibodies were neurotoxic.
Although we did not investigate the toxicity of serum samples from un-
affected village controls or patients with nodding syndrome who lacked
detectable leiomodin-1 antibodies and hence could not exclude the pos-
sibility of other neurotoxic substances in these patients, we think that
this is unlikely because the depletion of leiomodin-1 antibodies de-
creased the neurotoxicity. Another limitation of this study was that only
sera and CSF were investigated, and therefore, potentially important
immune cells such as leiomodin-1–specific T cells could not be charac-
terized. Autoreactive T cells may be the mediators of nodding syndrome
with the production of leiomodin-1 autoantibodies as a result of this
immune response. Further studies investigating the T cell repertoire
of patients in both the periphery and CNS would be informative. De-
spite these limitations, the work reported here provides insight into the
pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the development
of nodding syndrome. This syndrome can now be added to a grow-
ing list of autoimmune epilepsies (29, 30).
One mechanism through which autoreactive immune components
may be generated is molecular mimicry. Four criteria have been
established to define a molecular mimicry process, including (i) evi-
dence of an epidemiological association between the pathogen and the
immune-mediated disease, (ii) demonstration of immune cells or anti-
bodies directed against patient tissue containing the antigen, (iii) dem-
onstration of cross-reactivity of immune cells or antibodies specific
to the host antigen with the pathogen, and (iv) immune response to
and reproduction of disease in an animal model by infection or im-
munization (31). Here, we have demonstrated (i) the presence of

O. volvulus proteins, both with sequence data and biochemical assays

proteins; and (iv) that leiomodin-1 antibodies induce neurotoxicity. In
combination, these data fulfill the second and third criteria for molec-
ular mimicry. An epidemiological association between patients with
nodding syndrome and O. volvulus infection previously fulfilled the first
criterion for molecular mimicry. Further studies are needed to determine
whether the autoantibodies can reproduce the clinical manifestations in
an animal model. Such studies would provide direct evidence of an auto-
immune process (32) and fulfill the fourth criterion for molecular mimicry.
The data presented here may have direct clinical translational
value. Currently, patients with nodding syndrome are treated em-
pirically with antiepileptic medications in an effort to control the
seizures (33). Our data suggest that patients with nodding syndrome
may benefit from immunomodulatory therapies, especially early in
the course of disease before development of cognitive impairment.
However, it is also possible that the immune responses may cause
monophasic neurotoxicity, in which case immunotherapy may not
be beneficial. Nevertheless, we provide evidence for specific CNS
autoantibodies in patients with nodding syndrome, strengthen the as-
sociation between nodding syndrome and O. volvulus infection, and
suggest further areas of research that are critical for elucidating the
pathobiology of nodding syndrome.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The overall objective of this work was to determine whether patients
with nodding syndrome had autoantibodies that could contribute to
disease pathogenesis. This was a cross-sectional study design con-
ducted as a secondary analysis to the public health response activities
initiated in Uganda and South Sudan. The comparisons made for
discovery were between sera from patients with nodding syndrome
(n = 19) and sera from unaffected village controls (n = 19). The
sample size was based on the number of volunteers obtained within
the collection period of 1 to 30 December 2009 from a single remote
region in Northern Uganda affected in the epidemic. A second cohort of
patients with nodding syndrome (n = 36) and unaffected village con-
trols (n = 36) from South Sudan were included in the leiomodin-1
serum antibody analysis. Further comparisons between CSF from
patients with nodding syndrome (n = 16) and U.S. patients with epi-
lepsy (n = 8) were performed. Sample size for CSF was again based
on the number of volunteers within the village. No CSF from unaf-
fected village controls was obtained; therefore, U.S. patients were used
as a control group. Investigators were blinded to the identity of the
serum samples (patients or controls) during the initial screening for
autoantibodies.
Patient samples
In response to an epidemic of nodding syndrome, the Ministry of
Health in Uganda requested assistance with an investigation, which
included the collection and testing of serum and CSF samples from
patients with nodding syndrome, diagnosed using the consensus
case definition (2), and serum samples from village controls unaffected
by nodding syndrome or any other neurodevelopmental condition.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls. All
samples were collected from 1 to 30 December 2009. Neuroimaging
or electroencephalography was not performed on these persons at the
time the samples were obtained because they lived in remote regions
of Uganda. Onchocerca infection status was determined in this cohort
by serology. Nineteen patients and 19 unaffected controls were matched
for age within 5 years and were obtained from the same village. CSF
was obtained from 16 patients with nodding syndrome. It was not
considered appropriate to obtain CSF from unaffected village controls
at that time. Deidentified CSF samples from eight U.S. patients with
epilepsy and eight U.S. patients with pseudotumor cerebri were ob-
tained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from the CSF repo-
sitory at Johns Hopkins University, and their use for this study was
approved by the NIH Office of Human Subjects Protection and Re-
search. In South Sudan, serum samples from 36 patients with nodding
syndrome and 36 unaffected village controls were obtained and
screened for the presence of autoantibodies to leiomodin-1. Samples
were collected between 26 May 2011 and 8 June 2011 by a joint team
from the Ministry of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO), with
previous approval by the Ministry of Health in South Sudan. Informed
consent was obtained from all patients and controls. In this cohort,
Onchocerca infection status was determined by skin snip. Both of these
public health investigations underwent regulatory review at the CDC
and were determined to be nonresearch public health investigations.
Unbiased screening for autoantibodies in sera
To determine the diversity of autoantibodies in patients with nodding
syndrome, we incubated two sets of pooled sera, one from patients
with nodding syndrome and another from unaffected village controls
on membranes spotted with >9000 full-length human proteins using
an unbiased approach (that is, not restricted to known autoantigens)
(Human ProtoArray v5.0; Invitrogen). The investigators were blinded
to the identity of the pooled sera. Absolute differences in abundance of
antibody recognition greater than twofold were further investigated,
and the corresponding proteins were identified.
Mass spectrometry
Proteins were electrophoretically fractionated, and specific bands were
excised and subjected to a modified in-gel digestion (34). Nanoflow
reversed-phase liquid chromatography was performed using an Eksigent
NanoLC-Ultra HPLC system (AB Sciex) directly coupled to a nano–
electrospray ionization ion source mounted on an LTQ Orbitrap
Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS1 spectra were
acquired with a resolution of 30,000 at a mass/charge ratio of 400; MS2
spectra were acquired in the data-dependent mode. Tandem mass
spectra were extracted from .RAW files using the MSConvert utility
in the ProteoWizard Toolkit (version 3.0.3569) and output in .mgf
format. Data sets were analyzed using the Mascot search engine
(version 2.4.0; Matrix Science) against protein sequence libraries.
The genomic data set of O. volvulus was downloaded from the Well-
come Trust Sanger Institute.
Immunoblotting
After approval by the Institutional Review Board at the NIH, adult hu-
man brain homogenate extracts (temporal cortex) from patients under-
going surgery for epilepsy, whole-organism lysates from O. volvulus, or
overexpressed or recombinant proteins (leiomodin-1, OriGene; DJ-1,
Abcam) were resolved by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
analyzed by immunoblotting pooled sera (1:5000), pooled CSF samples
(1:1000), affinity-purified antibody (1:1000), or commercially available
antibodies. Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at
4°C. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibodies (anti-human
HRP or anti-rabbit HRP; 1:5000) were incubated at room temperature
(RT) for 1 hour. Membranes were developed with enhanced chemi-
luminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blocking experiments were
performed by incubating patient sera (n = 4) with either 10 mg of BSA
or 10 mg of O. volvulus whole-organism lysates for 1 hour, followed by
a 12-hour incubation with nitrocellulose-immobilized leiomodin-1.
Immune subtyping was performed by immunoblotting leiomodin-
1 with patient sera (1:5000) and using chain-specific HRP-linked sec-
ondary antibodies. Blots were visualized with ProteinSimple FluorChem
E/M Imager.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
High-binding plates were coated with purified recombinant leiomodin-1.
Serum samples from patients and controls were diluted (1:200) and
incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were incubated with anti-human
HRP–coupled antibody for 1 hour at RT (1:5000). Plates were de-
veloped with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine for 10 min at RT, and
development was stopped with 0.5 M sulfuric acid. OD was read at
480 nm with a 560-nm background correction on a FlexStation 3
(Molecular Devices). Positivity was defined by the mean ± 3 SD from
American healthy control blood donors (n = 20). Intraplate coefficient
of variation (CV) was 6%, and interplate CV was 15.5%. To ensure
specificity of the assay, we used a subset of samples with the same
protocol without antigen coupled. No signal was detected from these
samples.

 Immunoprecipitation
Leiomodin-1 (accession number NP_036266; Life Technologies) (clone
6177902) was subcloned into the Pet16b expression vector (EMD Milli-
pore), and in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) was performed
using the Promega T7 TNT expression system as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. One microliter of sera or CSF was incubated with 2 ml of
IVTT product for 1 hour at 4°C. Antibodies were then captured with
protein G beads and eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS buffer.
Proteins were resolved by gel electrophoresis. Densities for each sample
were calculated by the number of pixels per area after background cor-
rection. The cutoff for determining positive samples was mean intensity
± 1 SD of readings obtained from American patients with pseudotumor
cerebri (CSF; n = 8). Samples from patients with pseudotumor cerebri
were used to establish the assay but were not included in comparisons
betweengroupsofpatientswithepilepsy(U.S.patientsversuspatientswith
nodding syndrome).
Overexpression of leiomodin-1
HEK293T cells were plated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin-
streptomycin. Cells were transfected with either 0.4 mg of leiomodin-1
using Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Life
Technologies), empty vector control, or control pcDNA3.1-GFP (green
fluorescent protein) vector to determine the transfection efficiency.
Transfection efficiency was 90 to 95%.
Immunofluorescence
Human neural progenitor cells were derived, cultured, and differen-
tiated as previously described (35) after approval by the Office of Hu-
man Subjects Research and Protection at the NIH. Cells were fixed
with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and immunostained with rabbit
anti–leiomodin-1 (1:100) for 16 hours at 4°C and goat anti-rabbit
Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies, 1:400) for 2 hours at RT. Vybrant
Dil cell-labeling solution (Invitrogen) was used to visualize the plasma
membrane, and DAPI (1 mg/ml; Roche Diagnostics) was used for nu-
clear staining (35). A Nikon Eclipse Ti total internal reflection fluores-
cence (TIRF) microscope equipped with a 488/561/405/647 LU4A
Lasers System and an Andor iXon3 electron-multiplying charge-
coupled device camera by using an Apo TIRF (100× objective; numer-
ical aperture, 1.49) was used for imaging with acquisition (NIS-
Elements Advanced Research) and processing (ImageJ) to obtain the
composite RGB images. For coimmunofluorescence with patient serum
and CSF samples, cells were fixed, permeabilized with acetone, and
incubated with rabbit anti–leiomodin-1 (1:100), patient sera (1:100),
and patient CSF (1:25) for 1 hour at RT. Controls included secondary
antibody–only staining (no primary antibody). After washing, cells
were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor
594 (anti-rabbit) and Alexa Fluor 488 (anti-human) before incuba-
tion with DAPI. Cells were visualized on a laser scanning micro-
scope (Zeiss LSM 510).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for leiomodin-1 was performed on sagittal
sections of adult mouse brain using leiomodin-1 polyclonal antibody
(1:100; Proteintech). Murine smooth muscle from blood vessels and
skeletal muscle were used as positive controls. Briefly, sections were de-
paraffinized and rehydrated with xylene substitute, followed by an
ethanol gradient. Citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was used for antigen retriev-
al. Primary antibody was incubated overnight at RT. PowerVision
anti-rabbit HRP (Leica Biosystems) was applied for 2 hours at RT.
Diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) was used as a chromogen.
Images were processed using aNikon Eclipse Ci microscope. Allmurine
tissues were collected according to the recommendations in the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH, and the use of
these tissues was approved by the NIH.
Quantitative PCR
qPCR was performed on total RNA extracted using the RNeasy Plus
Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with ribonuclease-free deoxyribonuclease
fromtwoindependentadulthumanbrainspecimens,humanneuralstem
cells, human neurons, HeLa cells, and H9C2 (myoblast) cells. RNA
(375 ng) from each sample was reverse-transcribed into comple-
mentary DNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Gene expression
levels for leiomodin-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
were acquired on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). All primers and standards were obtained from
OriGene.
Affinity purification of leiomodin-1 antibodies
Antibodies to leiomodin-1 were affinity-purified from patient serum
samples (n = 4). Purified recombinant leiomodin-1 was coupled to
tosylactivated M280 beads as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Life
Technologies). Serum samples were incubated with leiomodin-1–
coupled beads for 1 hour at 37°C. Sera depleted of leiomodin-1 antibodies
were used in neurotoxicity assays. Captured leiomodin-1 antibodies were
eluted from the beads with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.0) and quickly returned
to physiological pH. Purified anti–leiomodin-1 antibodies were used
in cross-reactivity studies.
Neurotoxicity of leiomodin-1 antibodies
Human primary neurons (iCell; Cellular Dynamics International) were
cultured in laminin-coated (Sigma-Aldrich) 96-well plates at 37°C [5%
(v/v) CO2] and in iCell Complete Maintenance Medium (Cellular Dy-
namics International) at 80,000 cells per well. Before treatment, medi-
um was replaced with Opti-MEM reduced-serum medium (Life
Technologies). Neurons were treated with Opti-MEM only (negative
control), rabbit IgG polyclonal anti–leiomodin-1 antibody (20 mg/ml),
normal rabbit serum (20 mg/ml), patient sera (n = 1, selected at random
from patients with nodding syndrome; dilution of 1:200) or the same
patient sera sample with all antibodies depleted (n = 1; dilution of
1:200), patient sera (n = 4, selected at random from patients with
nodding syndrome with detectable leiomodin-1 antibodies; dilution
of 1:200), the same patient samples with leiomodin-1 antibodies de-
pleted (n = 4; dilution of 1:200), or 0.1% (v/v) saponin for 24 hours.
Cell death was determined by uptake of propidium iodide (Cayman
Chemical) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Neurons exposed
to patient sera with and without antibody depletion or to CSF were
tested for toxicity and viability using MultiTox-Fluor Multiplex Cyto-
toxicity Assay as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Fluo-
rescence was measured using FlexStation 3 Microplate Reader and
SoftMax Pro software.
Sequence homology analysis
Sequences for human leiomodin-1 and O. volvulus were obtained
from UniProt, and pairwise sequence alignment was performed using
EMBOSS (EMBL-EBI). Local alignment was completed using the
Smith-Waterman algorithm. Protein alignments and models were
generated in ClustalW (version 12.0; Lasergene).

 Statistics
Results are presented as average OD for two replicates (ELISA), mean
and SD of mean (qPCR), mORs with asymptotic 95% CI (frequency
of leiomodin-1 antibodies), or as percent of totals (viability and toxic-
ity). Differences in OD of leiomodin-1 antibody binding in sera among
cases and unaffected village controls were compared using ANOVA
with Sidak-Holms correction for multiple comparisons. Frequency of
leiomodin-1 antibodies in sera among cases and unaffected village con-
trols was compared using an mOR test. Frequency of leiomodin-1 anti-
bodies in CSF among cases and controls was compared using Fisher’s
exact test. Differences in neurotoxicity were assessed using two-way
paired t test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Software 6.01 or SAS
version 9.3.
