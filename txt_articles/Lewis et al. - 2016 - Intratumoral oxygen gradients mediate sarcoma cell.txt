Hypoxia is a critical factor in the progression and metastasis of
many cancers, including soft tissue sarcomas. Frequently, oxygen
(O2) gradients develop in tumors as they grow beyond their vas-
cular supply, leading to heterogeneous areas of O2 depletion.
Here, we report the impact of hypoxic O2 gradients on sarcoma
cell invasion and migration. O2 gradient measurements showed
that large sarcoma mouse tumors (>300 mm3) contain a severely
hypoxic core [≤0.1% partial pressure of O2 (pO2)] whereas smaller
tumors possessed hypoxic gradients throughout the tumor mass
(0.1–6% pO2). To analyze tumor invasion, we used O2-controllable
hydrogels to recreate the physiopathological O2 levels in vitro.
Small tumor grafts encapsulated in the hydrogels revealed in-
creased invasion that was both faster and extended over a longer
distance in the hypoxic hydrogels compared with nonhypoxic
hydrogels. To model the effect of the O2 gradient accurately, we
examined individual sarcoma cells embedded in the O2-controlla-
ble hydrogel. We observed that hypoxic gradients guide sarcoma
cell motility and matrix remodeling through hypoxia-inducible fac-
tor-1α (HIF-1α) activation. We further found that in the hypoxic
gradient, individual cells migrate more quickly, across longer dis-
tances, and in the direction of increasing O2 tension. Treatment
with minoxidil, an inhibitor of hypoxia-induced sarcoma metasta-
sis, abrogated cell migration and matrix remodeling in the hypoxic
gradient. Overall, we show that O2 acts as a 3D physicotactic agent
during sarcoma tumor invasion and propose the O2-controllable
hydrogels as a predictive system to study early stages of the met-
astatic process and therapeutic targets.

S
oft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant
cancers derived from transformed cells of mesenchymal origin
(1, 2). Approximately 13,000 new cases per year are diagnosed in
the United States alone, with 25–50% of patients developing re-
current and metastatic disease (3–5). Current clinical data suggest
that undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) is one of the
most aggressive sarcoma subtypes, which frequently results in le-
thal pulmonary metastases that are insensitive to radio/chemo-
therapy. It has recently become apparent that sarcoma progression
and metastasis are regulated by microenvironmental cues, such as
extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, stiffness modulation, cell-
to-cell/matrix interactions, signaling factors, and spatial gradients
(6–8). Of all these factors, low intratumoral oxygen (O2; hypoxia)
is most dramatically associated with pulmonary metastasis and
poor clinical outcomes (9, 10).
Intratumoral hypoxia occurs when the partial pressure of O2
(pO2) falls below 5%, and it is a commonly observed feature of
many sarcomas. Regional hypoxia develops as rapidly growing
tumors outstrip their blood supply and as a consequence of ab-
errant tumor angiogenesis. As a result, O2 gradients develop
throughout the growing tumor. Tumor hypoxia promotes che-
moresistance and radiation resistance, primarily due to limited
perfusion and reduced generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), respectively (11). Moreover, the stabilization and activation
of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcriptional regulators pro-
mote adaptation to hypoxic stress by modulating tumor cell me-
tabolism, survival, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and metastasis.
Elevated HIF expression has been associated with poor prognosis in
many cancers (12) and correlates with reduced survival for patients
with sarcoma. Recent transcriptome analyses have identified HIFs
and HIF target genes as independent prognostic indicators (13) of
clinical outcomes. Finally, high levels of intratumoral hypoxia and
HIF-1α accumulation are among the most important predictors of
metastatic potential in patients with sarcoma (14), although the
underlying mechanisms for this correlation remain incompletely
characterized. Importantly, although the effect of overall reduced
O2 on sarcoma cell responses has been studied, these cells are ac-
tually subjected to O2 gradients. Currently, the impact of specific O2
gradients on sarcoma cell migration is unclear.
In previous studies, we found that deposition of immature
collagen networks facilitated tumor cell metastasis to the lung in
an HIF-1α–dependent manner (15). We also demonstrated that
the HIF-1α regulated sarcoma metastasis through up-regulation
of procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase (PLOD2),
and the resulting increase in lysine hydroxylation of collagen
molecules (15). We have shown that PLOD2 expression pro-
motes metastasis in a hypoxia- and HIF-1α–dependent manner
Significance
Previous works demonstrated the role of hypoxia in tumor de-
velopment and metastasis. However, the understanding how
oxygen (O2) gradients regulate early stages of tumor metastasis
is lacking. Leveraging our O2-controlling hydrogel, we generated
a 3D in vitro model that enables us to analyze cancer cell re-
sponses to O2 gradients and small-molecule inhibitors. Using this
approach, we present a previously unidentified concept in which
O2 acts as a 3D physicotactic agent during sarcoma tumor in-
vasion, findings that are important for the understanding of the
metastatic process. Through this concept, we also establish the
3D in vitro model as a platform for testing therapeutic targets
and interventions for the treatment of sarcoma and potentially
other cancers.

 in a genetic in vivo model of UPS (15). However, we do not yet
know how sarcoma cell migration/invasion is altered in the
presence of the O2 gradients that develop in tumors.
Using in situ O2 measurements, we found that hypoxia gra-
dients exist in small primary mouse sarcoma tumors, whereas
large primary mouse sarcoma tumors contain severe hypoxic
cores (≤0.1% pO2). To model intratumoral O2 gradients, we
used novel O2-controlling hydrogels that can serve as 3D hypoxic
microenvironments (16). In these hypoxia-inducible (HI) hydro-
gels, O2 is consumed while polymerization occurs, resulting in
spatial O2 gradients. Thus, with these hydrogels, we can mimic
physiopathological O2 gradients. By encapsulating small tumor
grafts in the hydrogels, we found that hypoxic gradients promoted
cell invasion with faster speeds and longer distances, compared
with nonhypoxic gradients. We next demonstrate that the HI
hydrogel culture system replicates HIF-1α–dependent collagen
remodeling by sarcoma cells. Using this system, we then show that
the hypoxic gradients guide the speed, distance, and direction of
sarcoma cell motility compared with nonhypoxic hydrogels.
Finally, we show that treatment of the encapsulated sarcoma cells
with minoxidil abrogates cell migration and matrix remodeling in
the O2 gradient.
Results and Discussion
Primary Sarcoma Grafts Invade Hypoxic Hydrogels. To ascertain the
physiological range of O2 gradients in the developing sarcoma
tumor, we began by measuring dissolved O2 (DO) levels during
the growth of primary mouse sarcoma tumors. The primary sar-
coma tumors were generated in nude mice using murine sarcoma
cells derived from KrasG12D/+; Ink4a/Arf fl/fl (KIA) tumors (17) as
described in previous studies (15). O2 gradient measurements dur-
ing growth of s.c. primary sarcomas showed that in large tumors
(>300 mm3), about 50% of the tumor mass is hypoxic (≤0.1% pO2).
Smaller tumors exhibit hypoxic gradients throughout the tumor
mass, ranging from 0.1% pO2 at the center to >6% pO2 in the outer
layer bordering the edge of the tumor (Fig. 1A). Histological
analysis further revealed the severe hypoxic tumor core with cells
expressing HIF-1α localized to the nuclei in the larger tumors,
whereas weaker and more diffused HIF-1α signal was observed
throughout the entire smaller tumors (Fig. 1 B and C and Fig. S1).
Previously, we have established O2-controlling hydrogels and
found that after hydrogel formation, the DO levels at the bottom
of hydrogels decreased as gel thickness increased due to O2 dif-
fusion limitation, resulting in a broad range of O2 tensions within
the gel matrices (16). Based on the O2 gradient found in the xe-
nograft tumors, we sought to use the O2-controllable hydrogel
system to provide a more physiologically relevant 3D microenvi-
ronment to study cell migration. Using the hypoxic hydrogel sys-
tem, we recreated the hypoxic DO conditions found in the s.c.
in vivo tumors and evaluated the role of O2 in 3D tumor cell
migration assay. Tumor biopsy punches from smaller tumors were
cut into 8-mm sections and grafted into the hypoxic and non-
hypoxic hydrogels (Fig. 1D). Using noninvasive DO measurements
at the bottom of the hydrogels, we found that DO levels in the
hypoxic hydrogels reached <5% pO2 within the initial 30 min and
remained there during the entire week of measurements. Non-
hypoxic hydrogels exhibited a higher level of O2 (>5% pO2) during
this culture period (Fig. 1E). The tumor engrafted within hypoxic
matrix demonstrated increased invasion compared with tumors
engrafted within nonhypoxic matrix. Specifically, tumors in hyp-
oxic matrix invaded further into the hydrogel and away from the
primary graft (after 1 wk, 610 ± 210 μm) compared with those tu-
mors encapsulated in nonhypoxic gels (after 1 wk, 410 ± 130 μm)
(Fig. 1F). Moreover, migrating cells exiting tumor grafts in the
hypoxic hydrogel deposited new collagen compared with nonhypoxic
hydrogels (Fig. 1G), consistent with our previous findings (15).
Cell Migration from Sarcoma Grafts Is Regulated by O2 Gradients. To
investigate further the effect of O2 gradients on sarcoma tumor
migration, we performed real-time confocal analysis. Tumors
generated from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive KIA
cells were engrafted in hypoxic and nonhypoxic hydrogels and
imaged on day 3 when we first detected cell invasion into the
hydrogel (Fig. 2A). We then analyzed cell migration on day 3,
when we could first detect cell invasion from the tumor to the
hydrogel. We observed dynamic cell movement in the hypoxic
constructs compared with the nonhypoxic constructs, with more
cells migrating out of the grafts under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2B
and Fig. S2). Cell velocity analysis did not indicate specific di-
rectionality of migration, with most cells moving in the x and y
planes, suggesting a random migration path independent of O2
tension (Fig. S3). However, we found a higher migration speed in
hypoxic grafts compared with nonhypoxic grafts (Fig. 2C). Ex-
amining mean square displacement (MSD) in the three planes, we
found that cells migrating in the hypoxic gradients move larger
distances compared with the nonhypoxic gradients, with a signif-
icantly longer distance in the z direction (Fig. 2D) suggesting that

 although cells typically migrated in the x and y directions, those
cells that migrated in the z direction exhibited higher persistence.
Overall, these data show that hypoxic gradient promotes tumor
cell migration.
Sarcoma Cells Remodel Collagen in Hypoxic Hydrogels. Although the
tumor graft model provides vital information, the inherited
heterogeneity of the system limited the mechanistic insights that
such systems can provide. To model the effect of DO gradients
on sarcoma cell invasion/migration within a complex tumor mi-
croenvironment more accurately, we next examined individual
sarcoma cells embedded in the HI hydrogels (16). Noninvasive
measurements of DO at the bottom of the hydrogel confirmed
that the hypoxic matrix maintains low O2 levels during the 7 d of
culture compared with nonhypoxic matrix (Fig. 3A). Notably, by
day 7 in culture, O2 levels have decreased to ∼0.5%, likely to due
to expansion of the cell number over the longer culture period
and the associated cellular O2 consumption (18). An important
feature of this culture system is the ability to maintain the hyp-
oxic gradient environment without exposure to high O2 levels,
thus minimizing the introduction of ROS. This hydrogel allows
for the ability to perform live imaging of the cells while moni-
toring DO levels, presents a unique opportunity to link cellular
responses to DO gradients. Growing evidence suggests that ECM
remodeling is critical in sarcoma migration and metastasis. In
particular, proteolytic degradation and abnormal collagen de-
position and modification within hypoxic tumor microenviron-
ments have been implicated as important parameters that enhance
tumor invasion and metastasis (19–21). The gelatin (Gtn)-based
HI hydrogels provide matrix adhesion and degradation sites
similar to those sites in the tumor microenvironment, yet are
collagen-free to prevent confounding results. We first tested whether
sarcoma cells embedded in hypoxic hydrogel remodel the matrix
material. We examined the proteolytic degradation of the HI
Gtn matrices using DQ Gtn (Invitrogen), which emits green
fluorescence when degraded by a protease secreted by the cells
(22, 23). Interestingly, we observed higher fluorescence intensity in
the cells cultured within the hypoxic microenvironments [480
relative fluorescent units (RFU)] compared with the nonhypoxic
matrix (50 RFU) (Fig. 3B). Rheological analysis further con-
firmed the softening of the hypoxic matrix (Young’s modulus of
20 Pa) compared with nonhypoxic matrix (Young’s modulus of
45 Pa) within 3 d of culture (Fig. 3C). The Gtn-based HI
hydrogels further enabled us to examine whether sarcoma cells
modify collagen in the hypoxic matrix. We next examined the
upstream effect of HIF-1α activation on relevant genes on days 3
and 7. Although no change in gene expression was detected on
day 3 of culture, we observed an up-regulation of collagen 1 A1
(COL1A1), lysl oxidase (LOX), and PLOD2 expression after 7 d
of culture in the hypoxic hydrogel compared with the nonhypoxic
hydrogel (Fig. 3D). Moreover, at this time point, we detected
collagen expression and deposition (Fig. 3E), as well as HIF-1α
expression (Fig. S4), by the sarcoma cells in the hypoxic hydro-
gel. To determine whether ECM remodeling is regulated by the
HIF-1α in the hypoxic matrix, we used short hairpin RNA. We

 detected significant down-regulation of the genes that code for
collagen-modifying proteins Col1A1, LOX, and PLOD2 when
HIF-1α expression was inhibited (Fig. 3F), resulting in less col-
lagen deposition in hypoxic hydrogel-encapsulated cells compared
with controls (Fig. 3G). Overall, these results demonstrate that the
3D hypoxic hydrogel regulates sarcoma matrix remodeling through
hypoxic induction of HIF-1α expression. These results are consis-
tent with various sarcoma studies in vivo (15, 24, 25), suggesting
that the HI hydrogels are an appropriate 3D model with the
necessary biological attributes to study sarcoma cell invasion
and migration.
O2 Gradients Modulate the Speed, Distance, and Directional Bias of
Sarcoma Cell Motility. As we have previously shown, the HI hydro-
gel system is designed to create an O2 upward gradient, wherein
DO levels increase toward the interface between the construct and
O2-saturated culture media (16). Encapsulation of individual cell
suspension would provide us the opportunity to document single-
cell movement in relation to the O2 gradient (Fig. 4 A, i). Because
these constructs are cultured in air-oxygenated media, hypoxic and
nonhypoxic upward gradients are maintained in each of the gel
types (16). Invasive DO measurements validated hypoxic and
nonhypoxic gradients in the hydrogel cell constructs (Fig. 4 A, ii and
Fig. S5). These results confirm that we are able to mimic suc-
cessfully the gradients seen in the primary tumor in vivo. Thus,
we next examined how sarcoma cell motility is regulated by the O2
gradients in the 3D hypoxic and nonhypoxic gradients. We en-
capsulated KIA-GFP in the HI hydrogels and analyzed movement
on day 3 using real-time 3D cell tracking. Upon examining the 3D
trajectory profiles of the KIA-GFP–encapsulated cells, we ob-
served greater overall cell movement in the hypoxic gradients
compared with the nonhypoxic gels (Fig. 4B and Fig. S6). We
also found that cells in the hypoxic gradient gels are moving
faster than cells in the nonhypoxic gels. The cells moving
through the gel have faster velocity profiles in the x, y, and z
directions as well as for the overall speed. (Fig. 4 C and D).
Interestingly, we found that cells also moved in the z direction,
which has not been reported before. Importantly, cell velocity in
the z direction was primarily upward, in the direction of in-
creased O2 tension (Fig. 4D). We further computed and ana-
lyzed the MSD in the three planes (Fig. 4E). Here too, O2
gradient seemed to affect cell motility, as indicated by the MSD
in the z direction. Cells exposed to the hypoxic gradient are
traveling over larger distances compared with cells in the non-
hypoxic gradients (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, nongradient hypoxic
constructs (i.e., hydrogel constructs cultured in hypoxic condi-
tions) showed slower cell movement and a lower MSD com-
pared with hypoxic gradient constructs (Fig. S7). Overall, these
data show that increased DO levels enhance the speed, dis-
tance, and direction of sarcoma cell movement.
Inhibiting 3D Hypoxic Gradient Migration. We previously demon-
strated that PLOD2 promotes metastasis in a hypoxia- and
HIF-1α–dependent manner in an in vivo model of UPS (15). To
examine whether the O2-controllable hydrogel faithfully repre-
sents the intratumoral hypoxic environment, we examined the
effect of minoxidil, a pharmacological inhibitor of PLOD2 ex-
pression (26), on sarcoma cell migration. Minoxidil treatment
(0.5 mmol/L) for 12 h of sarcoma cells encapsulated in the
hypoxic hydrogels significantly reduced KIA cell movement (Fig.
5A and Fig. S8), concomitant with reduced overall cell speed as
well as velocity and MSD in the x, y, and z directions (Fig. 5 B–
D). Minoxidil treatment of sarcoma cells encapsulated in the
nonhypoxic hydrogels did not significantly affect cell migration
in the x and y directions, with slight inhibition of migration in the
z direction (Fig. S9). Examining matrix remodeling, we found
that minoxidil treatment reduced collagen deposition (Fig. 5E)
and inhibited the proteolytic degradation of the hypoxic matri-
ces (Fig. 5F). As expected, we found that hypoxia-induced
PLOD2 expression is inhibited with minoxidil treatment (Fig.
5G). Together, these data show that hypoxia gradients determine the
direction and speed of sarcoma cell migration in an HIF1/PLOD2-
dependent manner. Importantly, these findings also highlight the
utility of hydrogel encapsulation assays for the identification of
novel therapeutic targets and inhibitors for the treatment of
metastatic sarcoma and potentially other cancers as well.
Conclusions
Leveraging our O2-controlling hydrogel, we generated a 3D
in vitro model that enables us to analyze cancer cell responses to
O2 gradients and the effect of small-molecule inhibitors. Using this
approach, the current study presents a previously unidentified
concept in which O2 acts as a 3D physicotactic agent during early
stages of sarcoma tumor invasion. We found that an O2 gradient is
present in early stages of sarcoma development and that during
this stage, cells respond to the hypoxic gradient by aggressively
invading the matrix, followed by fast and long-distance migration.
Moreover, we demonstrated that in hypoxic gradients, individual
sarcoma cells not only migrate faster and over a longer distance
while remodeling the matrix but also migrate in the direction
of increased O2 tension. Finally, we showed that treatment
with minoxidil inhibits the migration and matrix remodeling in

 3D in vitro model as a platform for testing therapeutic targets
and interventions for the treatment of cancer.
Materials and Methods
Detailed materials and methods are provided in SI Materials and Methods. Briefly,
Gtn-based HI hydrogels were synthesized by a carbodiimide-mediated coupling
reaction as we previously reported (16). For cancer cell encapsulation, cell pellets
of KIA, KIA-GFP, or KIA–HIF-1α, or KIA-Scr [1.0 × 106 cells; derived from a genetic
murine model of sarcoma, LSL-KrasG12D/+; Ink4a/Arf fl/fl as established previously
(15)] were mixed with polymer stock solution followed by addition of laccase.
After mixing the enzyme, the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 2 min and then
cultured under standard cell culture conditions in cancer cell KIA media.
Primary Tumor Formation, DO Measurements, and Encapsulation. For primary
tumor encapsulation, we generated mouse sarcomas as previously reported
(15), which were extracted and sliced on day 10. The tumor specimens were
encapsulated within the hydrogels of different thicknesses and cultured un-
der standard cell culture conditions in KIA media. The O2 levels during the
culture period were monitored using noninvasive O2 sensors, as described
above. To monitor real-time tumor invasion and migration, we encapsulated
tumors generated from KIA-GFP cells.
Noninvasive O2 Measurement During Cell and Tumor Graft Culture. The DO
levels were monitored noninvasively at the bottom of hydrogels using com-
mercially available sensor patches (PreSens), as previously established (16, 27). To
vary O2 tension, we controlled the thickness of hydrogels in a volume-
dependent manner. We generated hydrogels with different minimum DO
levels (defined as hypoxic gels and nonhypoxic gels, >8% O2). For example, to
generate hypoxic gels, we plated 100 μL (2.5-mm thickness) of a mixture that
included polymer, cells, and laccase solutions into a well, whereas 50 μL
(1.25-mm thickness) of the mixture was plated into a well for preparing
nonhypoxic gels.
Invasive O2 Gradient Measurements. The O2 levels in vivo were measured
using a Needle-Type Housing Fiber-Optic O2 Microsensor (PreSens). These
needle sensors were mounted on a micromanipulator with 10-μm precision
(PreSens). Hydrogel cell constructs were generated as detailed above. Tu-
mors were generated as previously stated, and DO measurements were
performed once tumors were visible. O2 gradient measurements were per-
formed using the needle sensor and a micromanipulator (PreSens). The tu-
mor diameter was measured using a caliper, and the needle was placed at
the center of the tumor and moved outward in 0.5-mm increments, re-
cording a DO reading at each distance, until reaching the edge of the tumor.
The volume of the tumor was calculated using an established method (28).
The tumor O2 measurements were averaged, and the SE of the mean was
calculated for each distance from the center of the tumor. This same ap-
proach was used to evaluate the O2 gradient in the hydrogel at days 1, 3, 5,
and 7 in the KIA-encapsulated samples.
Matrix Degradation, Migration Assays, and Drug Treatment. To assess the ef-
fect of O2 levels on matrix degradation, we incorporated 10 μg/mL DQ Gtn
(Invitrogen) into polymer solutions when preparing cell suspensions and
then mixed the solutions with the laccase solution as described above. After
day 3, the hydrogels with DQ-Gtn were observed by the fluorescence mi-
croscopy (BX60; Olympus) and quantified by measuring the fluorescence
intensity using a fluorescence spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 495 nm
excitation and 515 nm emission (Molecular Devices).
For the 3D cancer cell migration assay, we encapsulated KIA-GFP cells and
tumor grafts in hydrogel to generate constructs with different O2 levels as
reported previously (16). For nongradient hydrogel controls, constructs were
formed and incubated in 1% O2 for 3 d and then tracked in that chamber at
day 3. Cells were tracked at day 3 using live-cell 3D confocal microscopy (LSM
780; Carl Zeiss) equipped with a cell incubator (5% CO2 and 37 °C). To op-
timize the experiment properly, only cells that started in-frame were in-
cluded, with a shorter time frame used for the tumor-encapsulated samples.
The time-lapse and z-stack images (>200-μm thickness) were collected every
30 min up to 24 h at five randomly selected positions. The images were
analyzed using Imaris spot analysis software (Imaris 8.1; Bitplane) to track
the time-dependent mobility. The 3D migration analysis was performed
following the strategy developed by Wirtz and coworkers (29, 30). A mini-
mum of 100 individual cells at each point were tracked to generate x, y, and
z coordinates at each time point. These data were then sorted to include
only cells that were present at time 0. From these sorted data, the time that
the cells were in-frame was calculated, and the most common time was used
to pick cells for tracking analysis. By choosing the time frame with the most
visible cells we could maximize the sample size of cells that could be ana-
lyzed. Finally, velocity and speed profiles, MSDs, and trajectory plots were
calculated using code adapted from Wirtz and coworkers (29, 30) for trip-
licate tracking trials (n = 3). The statistical analysis was performed using
MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.) to calculate the mean, SD, and SE of the mean. A t
test was performed where appropriate to determine significance (GraphPad
Prism 4.02; GraphPad Software, Inc.). Graphed data are presented as av-
erage ± SD. Significance levels were set at *P < 0.05, ^P < 0.01, and #P <
0.001 (29, 30).
For minoxidil treatment, the cells were cultured in hypoxic hydrogels as
stated above for 3 d. On the third day, 0.5 mM minoxidil (dissolved in KIA cell
culture media) was added to the wells and the cells were tracked for 24 h.
Untreated cultures served as controls. Cell tracking and data analysis were
performed as described above.
