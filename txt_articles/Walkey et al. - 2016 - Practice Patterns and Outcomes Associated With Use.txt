 OBJECTIVE—To determine clinician practice patterns and patient risk of stroke and bleeding 
associated with use of anticoagulation for AF during sepsis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A retrospective cohort study using enhanced 
administrative claims data from approximately 20% of patients hospitalized in the United States 
July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2013, examined patients with AF during sepsis who did not have 
additional indications for therapeutic anticoagulation. Propensity score and instrumental variable 
analyses were used to evaluate risks of in-hospital stroke and bleeding associated with 
anticoagulation during sepsis.
EXPOSURES—Parenteral anticoagulants administered in doses greater than those used for 
prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Ischemic stroke and clinically significant bleeding 
events during hospitalization.
RESULTS—Of 113 511 patients hospitalized with AF and sepsis, 38 582 were included in our 
primary analysis (18 976 men and 19 606 women; mean [SD] age, 74.9 [11.7] years). A total of 13 
611 patients (35.3%) received parenteral anticoagulants, while 24 971 (64.7%) did not. Hospital 
utilization rates of parenteral anticoagulants for AF during sepsis varied (median, 33%; 25th–75th 
percentile, 25%-43%). CHA2DS2VASc scores (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 
years [doubled], type 1 or type 2 diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism 
[doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic 
plaque], age 65–75 years, sex category [female]) poorly discriminated the risk of ischemic stroke 
during sepsis (C statistic, 0.526). Among 27 010 propensity score–matched patients, rates of in-
hospital ischemic stroke events did not differ significantly between patients who did (174 of 13 
505 [1.3%]) and did not (185 of 13 505 [1.4%]) receive parenteral anticoagulation (relative risk 
[RR], 0.94; 95% CI, 0.77–1.15). Clinically significant bleeding occurred more often among 
patients who received parenteral anticoagulation (1163 of 13 505 [8.6%]) than patients who did 
not receive parenteral anticoagulation (979 of 13 505 [7.2%]; RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10–1.32). Risk 
of ischemic stroke associated with parenteral anticoagulation did not differ significantly between 
patients with preexisting (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86–1.44) or newly diagnosed AF (RR, 0.85; 95% 
CI 0.57–1.27; P = .31 for interaction). Results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses, 
including hospital utilization rates of parenteral anticoagulation for AF as an instrument for 
anticoagulation exposure (RR for stroke, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.62–1.90; RR for bleeding, 1.23; 95% CI, 
0.88–1.72).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among patients with AF during sepsis, parenteral 
anticoagulation was not associated with reduced risk of ischemic stroke and was associated with 
higher bleeding rates.
Sepsis, a dysregulated immune response to infection that results in life-threatening organ 
dysfunction,1 leads to approximately 1 million hospitalizations in the United States yearly.2 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia to complicate the course of sepsis3; 
approximately one-fourth of patients 65 years or older hospitalized with sepsis have 
concomitant AF.4 Although risk of ischemic stroke among patients with AF during sepsis 
exceeds the risks of both the general population with AF and patients with sepsis who do not 
experience AF,5 little evidence exists to support the use of anticoagulation for prophylaxis of

 arterial thromboembolism for patients with AF during sepsis.6,7 Management decisions 
regarding the use of anticoagulation for prophylaxis of arterial thromboembolism during 
sepsis are complicated by changes to the coagulation cascade and acute organ dysfunction 
that may increase risks of bleeding and thrombosis.8,9 Because stroke during sepsis is a 
relatively rare (eg, 2%-3% of patients with newly diagnosed AF during sepsis)5 but 
clinically important outcome, we used a large pharmacoepidemiologic database to evaluate 
associations between anticoagulation use during hospitalization and stroke and bleeding 
outcomes among patients with sepsis and AF.
Methods
Sepsis Cohort
As described previously,10 we used an administrative database enhanced with a date-
stamped, detailed log of all medications as well as laboratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic 
services (Premier Inc) to identify a cohort of adult patients 18 years or older hospitalized 
from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2013, with sepsis (defined according to the 1992 American 
College of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus conference11) 
present on admission. These data represent approximately 20% of hospitalized patients in 
nonfederal US hospitals.12 Patients with sepsis present on admission were selected through 
use of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) codes for sepsis (038.x) with high positive predictive value (>90%)13 combined 
with receipt of an antibiotic. Atrial fibrillation was identified via ICD-9-CM code 427.31 
(positive predictive value, 70%-96%; median, 89%)14 and patients with AF were 
subclassified as having preexisting AF (eg, diagnosed prevalent AF that was present on 
admission) or newly diagnosed AF (eg, incident AF that was not present on admission).5 We 
excluded patients with other potential indications for anticoagulation, including patients with 
prosthetic heart valves, acute myocardial infarction, or venous thromboembolic disease. To 
maximize the positive predictive value of our primary AF cohort we included patients with 
clinically significant AF during sepsis as our primary analysis cohort,10 defined by receipt of 
intravenous agents to control heart rate or rhythm concomitant with antibiotics. However, 
sensitivity analyses broadened inclusion criteria to include patients with an ICD-9-CM code 
for AF, without necessitating receipt of medications to control heart rate or rhythm.
All study procedures were determined as nonhuman participants research due to the 
deidentified nature of the study data by the Boston University Medical Campus Institutional 
Review Board.
Anticoagulation
Anticoagulation use during sepsis was defined as anticoagulants given on the same day as an 
antibiotic during the first 14 days of a hospital admission for sepsis. Anticoagulation data 
were extracted from pharmacy billing files and included hospital day of administration, 
quantity, route, and dosing. To attenuate unmeasured confounding by illness severity owing 
to patients’ ability to take oral anticoagulant medications during sepsis,15 we restricted our 
definition of anticoagulant exposure in the primary analysis to initial use of parenteral 
intravenous or subcutaneous administration of anticoagulants in doses greater than those

 used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (ie, intravenous heparin sodium, >20 000 
U daily, subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium twice daily [total daily dose >80 mg], 
subcutaneous dalteparin sodium, >5000 IU daily, and fondaparinux sodium, >2.5 mg daily). 
We allowed for oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin sodium) later during hospitalization among 
patients who received an intravenous or subcutaneous anticoagulant initially, but excluded 
patients who received oral anticoagulants as their initial anticoagulant in the primary 
analysis. Given the clinical importance of understanding the risks and benefits of continuing 
oral anticoagulation among patients with preexisting AF and sepsis, we performed 
exploratory analysis evaluating oral anticoagulants as the initial anticoagulant during 
hospitalization (ie, warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) among patients with 
preexisting AF.
Covariates and Subgroups
We included year of hospitalization, patient demographics, co-morbid conditions, acute 
organ failure present on admission, organ-supportive therapies (given on hospital day 1), 
source of sepsis, health care professional, and hospital characteristics as covariates (eTable 1 
in the Supplement). We performed subgroup analysis and explored interactions between 
outcomes and anticoagulation status based on whether AF was newly diagnosed vs 
preexisting.
Outcomes
We investigated patient and hospital factors associated with use of parental anticoagulation 
among patients with AF during sepsis and evaluated in-hospital stroke incidence and risk of 
bleeding associated with use of anticoagulation. Stroke was defined in the primary analysis 
using the ICD-9-CM codes for stroke (433.x1, 434.x1, and 436)16 that was not present on 
admission. Bleeding not present on admission was defined using previously validated 
algorithms (eTable 2 in the Supplement).17
Statistical Analysis
We used χ2 tests or t tests, as appropriate, as well as standardized differences (the ratio of 
between-group difference to SD) to assess balance in baseline characteristics between 
patients receiving or not receiving parenteral anticoagulation. Consistent with prior reports, a 
standardized difference threshold of 0.1 or greater was chosen to denote potentially 
important differences between treatment groups.18
To our knowledge, the ability of CHA2DS2-VASc6 scores (congestive heart failure, 
hypertension, age ≥75 years [doubled], type 1 or type 2 diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic 
attack or thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction, 
peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque], age 65–75 years, sex category [female]) to 
predict ischemic stroke associated with AF has not previously been evaluated in patients 
with sepsis. We used C statistics generated from a logistic regression model to summarize 
the ability of the CHA2DS2-VASc score to discriminate risk of ischemic stroke in our cohort 
with sepsis.

 A propensity score approach was used to adjust for measured confounding in the selection 
of patients who received parenteral anticoagulation during hospitalization with AF during 
sepsis. Nonparsimonious propensity scores were calculated using generalized estimating 
equations with robust SE calculations accounting for within-hospital clustering19 to 
determine the probability that each patient would receive parenteral anticoagulation, 
conditional on measured variables. Propensity score models included independent variables 
representing hospital characteristics, patient demographics, comorbid conditions, use of 
intensive care, measures of acute organ dysfunction, source of infection, and year of 
hospitalization (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Our primary analysis used the propensity score 
to match patients with AF during sepsis who did and did not receive parenteral 
anticoagulation based on each patient’s predicted probability of receiving anticoagulation. 
We determined risk-standardized, between-hospital variation in the use of parenteral 
anticoagulation for AF during sepsis using the hospital random-effects output from 
hierarchical logistic regression models.
Sensitivity Analysis
We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our findings to different 
specifications of our cohort definition for AF during sepsis, stroke and bleeding outcomes, 
and analytic methods to adjust for confounding. We performed a sensitivity analysis 
including all patients with ICD-9 codes for AF during sepsis, regardless of whether they 
received medication for AF to control heart rate or rhythm. Another analysis used the timing 
of computed tomographic scans of the head (for stroke) and transfusion of blood products 
(for bleeding) before or after the anticoagulation start date. A further analysis used inverse 
probability of treatment weighting among all eligible patients.20 We performed 2-level 
analysis using hospital-level rates of parenteral anticoagulation among patients with AF 
during sepsis as an ecological-level exposure instrument in logistic regression (with robust 
SEs), using patient-level outcomes and covariates.21,22
Exploratory Analyses of Initial Oral Anticoagulants
We explored practice patterns associated with oral anticoagulants as initial anticoagulants 
during hospitalization among patients with preexisting AF. Stroke and bleeding outcomes 
associated with initial use of oral anticoagulants during sepsis were examined using a 
propensity score–matching approach as well as an ecological exposure instrument approach 
using hospital-level rates of oral anticoagulation among patients with preexisting AF during 
sepsis.
We used SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute), for all analyses and selected a 2-sided P < .05 for 
statistical significance.
Results
Among 113 511 patients with sepsis and AF, we identified 38 582 eligible patients in our 
primary analysis cohort (18 976 men [49.2%] and 19 606 women [50.8%]; mean [SD] age, 
74.9 [11.7] years), of whom 13 611(35.3%) received an initial intravenous or subcutaneous 
anticoagulant in doses greater than those generally used for prophylaxis of venous

 thromboembolism and 24 971 (64.7%) did not receive such an anticoagulant (Figure 1). 
Hospital risk-adjusted use of intravenous or subcutaneous anticoagulation varied (median, 
33%; 25th-75th percentile, 25%-43%); 170 of 520 hospitals (32.7%) had rates of 
anticoagulation utilization that differed significantly from the mean hospital rate (Figure 2). 
Patients received the initial intravenous or subcutaneous anticoagulant dose on a median of 
hospital day 2 (25th–75th percentile, day 1–4). Enoxaparin was the most commonly selected 
initial parenteral anticoagulant (6991 of 14 121 [49.4%]) and warfarin (8289 of 9294 initial 
anticoagulants [89.2%]) was the most commonly chosen initial oral anticoagulant (eTable 3 
in the Supplement).
Patient Characteristics, Anticoagulation, and Stroke
Patients with AF during sepsis who received intravenous or subcutaneous anticoagulation 
differed from patients who did not receive any anticoagulation on multiple baseline factors, 
and anticoagulation use decreased over time (Table 1). For example, patients receiving 
parenteral anticoagulation during sepsis were younger (mean [SD] age, 73.2 [11.7] vs 75.8 
[11.7] y; P < .001), and were less likely to have prior bleeding events (930 [6.8%] vs 2845 
[11.4%]; P < .001), acute hematologic failure (1839 [13.5%] vs 4552 [18.2%]; P < .001), 
acute kidney failure (7612 [55.9%] vs 15 814 [63.3%]; P < .001), chronic kidney disease 
(3971 [29.2%] vs 8696 [34.8%]; P < .001), cancer (1540 [11.3%] vs 3786 [15.2%]; P < .
001), or metabolic acidosis (3296 [24.2%] vs 6756 [27.1%]; P = .002). The ability of 
CHA2DS2-VASc scores to predict ischemic stroke during sepsis was nominally greater than 
chance, with a C statistic of 0.526.
Anticoagulation and Outcomes
Unadjusted rates of ischemic stroke among patients who did not receive intravenous or 
subcutaneous anticoagulation (342 [1.4%]) and did receive anticoagulation (174 [1.3%]) did 
not differ significantly (relative risk [RR], 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78–1.12). Unadjusted risk of 
bleeding was higher among patients who received parenteral anticoagulation (1174 [8.6%]) 
compared with those who did not receive anticoagulation (1773 [7.1%]) (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 
1.13–1.36) (Table 2).
After matching patients on propensity scores, measured covariates were well balanced 
between patients who did and did not receive intravenous or subcutaneous anticoagulation 
(eTable 4 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement). In the propensity score–matched analysis, 
ischemic stroke events did not differ significantly based on receipt of intravenous or 
subcutaneous anti-coagulation, occurring among 174 of 13 505 patients (1.3%) who 
received anticoagulation and 185 of 13 505 (1.4%) who did not receive anticoagulation (RR, 
0.94; 95% CI, 0.77–1.15). Bleeding events were increased among patients who received 
intravenous or subcutaneous anticoagulation (1163 of 13 505 [8.6%]) compared with 
patients who did not receive anticoagulation (979 of 13 505 [7.2%]) (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 
1.10–1.32).
Outcomes Stratified by Newly Diagnosed and Preexisting AF
Rates of parenteral anticoagulation did not differ significantly between patients with newly 
diagnosed and preexisting AF (Table 1). Although patients with newly diagnosed AF had

 significantly higher rates of ischemic stroke (104 of 5585 [1.9%]) than did patients with 
preexisting AF (255 of 21 425 [1.2%]), the RR of ischemic stroke associated with 
anticoagulation did not differ significantly between patients with preexisting AF (1.12; 95% 
CI, 0.86–1.44) or newly diagnosed AF (0.85; 95% CI, 0.57–1.27; P = .31 for interaction). 
The risk of bleeding was higher among patients with newly diagnosed AF (703 of 5585 
[12.6%]) than patients with preexisting AF (1439 of 21 425 [6.7%]), but the RR of bleeding 
associated with parenteral anticoagulation was lower among patients with newly diagnosed 
AF (0.97; 95% CI, 0.83–1.14) than patients with preexisting AF (1.23; 95% CI, 1.10–1.36; P 
= .008 for interaction).
Sensitivity analyses using different specifications for cohort definition, stroke and bleeding 
outcomes, and analytic methods to adjust for confounding either did not identify differences 
in risk of stroke or bleeding based on receipt of intravenous or subcutaneous anticoagulants 
during AF and sepsis or showed results generally similar to those of the primary analysis 
(Table 3).
Oral Anticoagulants
Exploratory analyses demonstrated that patients receiving oral anticoagulants as the initial 
anticoagulant during hospitalization were more likely to have a history of preexisting AF 
than newly diagnosed AF (adjusted RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.89–3.49), as well as more frequent 
cardiovascular comorbidity and lower incidence of acute organ failures (eTable 5 in the 
Supplement). In propensity score–matched analysis among patients with preexisting AF, 
those who received initial oral anticoagulants experienced lower rates of stroke (44 of 8364 
[0.5%]) and bleeding (434 of 8364 [5.2%]) than did matched patients who did not receive 
anticoagulants (stroke, 236 of 18661 [1.3%]; bleeding, 1121 of 18 661 [6.0%]) (RR for 
stroke, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32–0.66; RR for bleeding, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74–0.97). However, 
results were not robust to instrumental variable approach using rates of oral anticoagulation 
in the hospital; risk for stroke (highest hospital quartile vs lowest: adjusted odds ratio, 0.85; 
95% CI, 0.60–1.20) and bleeding (highest hospital quartile vs lowest: adjusted odds ratio, 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.88–1.34) were similar at hospitals with high and low rates of oral 
anticoagulant use.
Discussion
We investigated the practice patterns and outcomes associated with receipt of systemic 
anticoagulation during hospitalization with AF and sepsis. Hospital practices for the use of 
parenteral anticoagulation in patients with AF during sepsis varied widely, with one-third of 
hospitals deviating significantly from mean rates of anticoagulation use. Patients with AF 
during sepsis who received parenteral anticoagulation generally had fewer comorbid and 
acute conditions associated with bleeding risk compared with patients who did not receive 
anticoagulation. Rates of ischemic stroke during sepsis were generally low and did not differ 
based on initial receipt of parenteral anticoagulation; however, risk of bleeding was greater 
among patients receiving parenteral anticoagulation during sepsis. Evaluations of initial 
parenteral anticoagulation were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses, including evaluation 
in cohorts defined by broader inclusion criteria and use of different methods to address

 measured and unmeasured confounding, demonstrating no reduction in risk of ischemic 
stroke with use of parenteral anticoagulants during sepsis. Although exploratory analyses of 
patients with preexisting AF showed potentially lower rates of stroke with initial use of oral 
anticoagulants, the findings on use of oral anticoagulants should be viewed in the context of 
increased risk of bias from unmeasured confounding. Our findings demonstrate large 
variation in practice patterns, suggesting clinical equipoise for use of parenteral 
anticoagulation for AF during sepsis; however, we did not find consistent evidence that the 
potentially increased risk of bleeding associated with parenteral anticoagulation during 
sepsis was offset by significantly lower rates of stroke.
To our knowledge, few studies have investigated outcomes associated with anticoagulation 
use among patients with AF during sepsis. A retrospective, single-center study by Darwish 
et al9 evaluated 115 patients with preexisting AF and sepsis; no ischemic stroke events were 
recorded and an increased risk of bleeding was observed among the 30% of patients who 
received any anticoagulation during sepsis. The results of this study were similar to our 
results among an approximate 20% sample of patients in the United States: about one-third 
of patients with AF and sepsis received parenteral anticoagulation, rates of ischemic stroke 
during hospitalization were low, and risks of bleeding risks higher among patients receiving 
anticoagulation.
Parenteral anticoagulation for AF during hospitalization for sepsis may be considered 
analogous to using intravenous anticoagulants to bridge to oral anticoagulation for AF 
during a perioperative period. Similar to our findings, a recent randomized trial 
demonstrated an increase in bleeding without significant reductions in rates of ischemic 
stroke with the use of perioperative parenteral anticoagulation for AF.23 Given relatively low 
in-hospital rates of ischemic stroke (1%-2% in our study, 2.5% reported previously5 during 
sepsis with acute organ dysfunction and AF), moderate rates of bleeding complications, and 
poor performance of CHA2DS2-VASc scores to stratify risk of stroke during sepsis, current 
evidence does not support a benefit associated with use of parenteral anticoagulation to 
reduce AF-associated thromboembolic complications during sepsis.24
Exploratory analyses of initial oral anticoagulant use among patients with preexisting AF 
suggested a benefit for lower risk of stroke during hospitalization for sepsis, a finding 
supported by studies investigating continuation of oral anticoagulants for AF in clinical 
settings that do not involve sepsis (eg, during placement of a pacemaker).25 Given the lower 
rates of bleeding among patients given oral anticoagulants compared with those not 
receiving anticoagulants (potentially related to prevalent user bias),26 and the lack of 
supporting results from instrumental variable analysis, we urge caution in interpreting the 
analysis of oral anticoagulants. In addition, because we did not have access to patients’ 
medication history before admission, we could not reliably ascertain new vs continued use 
of oral anticoagulants. Furthermore, our study did not examine postdischarge outcomes 
among patients prescribed an oral anticoagulant at discharge. Our findings do not address, 
nor do we advocate, changes to chronic anticoagulant therapy for preexisting AF following a 
resolution of sepsis or discharge from hospitalization for sepsis. Further study is necessary to 
evaluate the optimal timing of reinitiating oral anticoagulants for patients receiving chronic

 therapy and the risk-to-benefit ratio of longer-term anticoagulation after sepsis among 
patients with newly diagnosed AF during a sepsis-related hospitalization.
Multiple factors complicate the use and evaluation of therapeutic anticoagulation during 
sepsis as prophylaxis against thromboembolic complications of AF. The dysregulated 
immune response of sepsis may produce both prothrombotic and antithrombotic states that 
predispose patients to both thrombotic and bleeding complications27 unrelated to prior 
cardiovascular risk, potentially explaining the poor predictive ability of CHA2DS2-VASc 
scores for stroke during sepsis. In addition, complications and treatments of sepsis may 
result in seizures, encephalopathy, and delirium that produce transient stroke-like symptoms 
unrelated to thromboembolism. Furthermore, cerebral hypoperfusion during sepsis may 
cause watershed ischemia, which is difficult to distinguish from cardioembolic infarcts 
related to AF. Finally, emergency procedures for critically ill patients with sepsis (eg, 
placement of a central catheter) may also increase risk for bleeding among patients receiving 
anticoagulants. Our findings suggest that the physiological changes and clinical demands of 
sepsis may attenuate benefits and increase risks of anticoagulation for AF in the short term 
during hospitalization with sepsis.
Some limitations should be considered in evaluation of our findings. Claims data may 
insufficiently characterize comorbidities or acute severity of illness, although prior studies 
have suggested that predictive ability of claims data approaches that of severity of illness 
scores such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II.28 Subgroup analysis 
may be underpowered to show interaction between groups with preexisting and newly 
diagnosed AF for stroke and bleeding outcomes. We could not compare among intravenous 
or subcutaneous anticoagulation regimens, type of anticoagulation, or patients with 
supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic levels of anticoagulation. We acknowledge that 
individuals with newly diagnosed AF may have actually had AF that was previously 
clinically unrecognized; however, patients with newly diagnosed AF were unlikely to have 
had prior anticoagulant treatment for AF. In addition, because we did not have access to 
medication history before admission, we could not analyze new vs continued use of oral 
anticoagulants. Although we stratified analyses by preexisting and newly diagnosed AF 
during sepsis, we lacked sufficient granularity of data to distinguish between paroxysmal or 
permanent AF. Finally, the observational nature of our study design limits etiologic 
inference. Although large randomized trials would eliminate unmeasured residual 
confounding that may be present in our observational study, trials that could achieve 
adequate power to detect relatively rare outcomes of stroke associated with AF during sepsis 
would be difficult to conduct.
Conclusions
We investigated practice patterns and outcomes associated with use of therapeutic 
anticoagulation for AF that occurs during sepsis. After adjusting for differences in measured 
patient characteristics, large variation among hospitals remained in the use of parenteral 
anticoagulation for AF during sepsis. Younger patients with fewer risk factors for bleeding 
were more likely to receive parenteral anticoagulation. In multiple analyses adjusting for 
measured and unmeasured confounding, use of therapeutic parenteral anticoagulation during

 hospitalization with sepsis and AF was not associated with reduction in ischemic stroke, and 
showed a potentially higher bleeding risk. Whereas current evidence suggests that benefits 
may not outweigh risks of parenteral anticoagulation for AF during sepsis, further study is 
warranted to determine optimal timing for restarting treatment with oral anticoagulants 
among patients with preexisting AF and long-term anticoagulation strategies after 
hospitalization for patients with newly diagnosed AF during sepsis.

 Key Points
Question
What are the risks of ischemic stroke and bleeding associated with use of parenteral 
anticoagulants for prophylaxis of arterial thromboembolism for patients with atrial 
fibrillation during sepsis?
Findings
In a cohort study of 38 582 hospitalized patients with atrial fibrillation and sepsis, receipt 
of parenteral anticoagulants during sepsis was not associated with a significantly reduced 
risk of in-hospital ischemic stroke (1.3%) compared with patients who did not receive 
anticoagulants (1.4%). However, rates of clinically significant bleeding were markedly 
higher among patients receiving anticoagulation (8.6%) than those not receiving 
anticoagulation (7.2%) of atrial fibrillation during sepsis.
Meaning
Use of parenteral anticoagulation for prophylaxis of arterial thromboembolism in patients 
with atrial fibrillation during sepsis may be associated with greater risk than benefit.

aPropensity score models used to match patients or produce inverse probability of treatment weights included the following variables: age, sex, 
race, hospital teaching status, hospital geographical location, attending physician specialty, presence of preexisting or newly diagnosed atrial 
fibrillation, prior stroke, prior bleeding, intensive care, history of heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney 
disease, chronic lung disease, valvular heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cancer, dementia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, 
acute circulatory failure, acute neurologic failure, acute hematologic failure, acute hepatic failure, acidosis, source of infection, use of vasopressors, 
and year of hospitalization. Propensity scores matched 13 505 of 13 611 (99.2%) patients who received anticoagulation, including all patients 
receiving anticoagulation who experienced stroke, with 13 505 of 24 971 (54.1%) patients who did not receive anticoagulation.
