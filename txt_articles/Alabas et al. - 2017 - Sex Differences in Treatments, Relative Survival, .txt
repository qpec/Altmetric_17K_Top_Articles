Background-—This study assessed sex differences in treatments, all-cause mortality, relative survival, and excess mortality
following acute myocardial infarction.
Methods and Results-—A population-based cohort of all hospitals providing acute myocardial infarction care in Sweden
(SWEDEHEART [Swedish Web System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated
According to Recommended Therapies]) from 2003 to 2013 was included in the analysis. Excess mortality rate ratios (EMRRs),
adjusted for clinical characteristics and guideline-indicated treatments after matching by age, sex, and year to background
mortality data, were estimated. Although there were no sex differences in all-cause mortality adjusted for age, year of
hospitalization, and comorbidities for ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI at 1 year (mortality
rate ratio: 1.01 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96–1.05] and 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95–0.99], respectively) and 5 years (mortality rate
ratio: 1.03 [95% CI, 0.99–1.07] and 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95–0.99], respectively), excess mortality was higher among women
compared with men for STEMI and non-STEMI at 1 year (EMRR: 1.89 [95% CI, 1.66–2.16] and 1.20 [95% CI, 1.16–1.24],
respectively) and 5 years (EMRR: 1.60 [95% CI, 1.48–1.72] and 1.26 [95% CI, 1.21–1.32], respectively). After further adjustment
for the use of guideline-indicated treatments, excess mortality among women with non-STEMI was not significant at 1 year
(EMRR: 1.01 [95% CI, 0.97–1.04]) and slightly higher at 5 years (EMRR: 1.07 [95% CI, 1.02–1.12]). For STEMI, adjustment for
treatments attenuated the excess mortality for women at 1 year (EMRR: 1.43 [95% CI, 1.26–1.62]) and 5 years (EMRR: 1.31
[95% CI, 1.19–1.43]).
Conclusions-—Women with acute myocardial infarction did not have statistically different all-cause mortality, but had higher
excess mortality compared with men that was attenuated after adjustment for the use of guideline-indicated treatments. This
suggests that improved adherence to guideline recommendations for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction may reduce
premature cardiovascular death among women.

 C
oronary artery disease is a major health problem that
contributes considerably to the global mortality and
disease burden in men and women.1 Estimates of the impact
of sex on survival following acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
have varied to some extent.2,3 The reasons for these
inconsistent findings are numerous and include the use of
different populations with regard to age and type of AMI, as
well as differing times to censorship and adjustments for
confounders.
Several studies have suggested that sex is no longer a major
independent predictor of death, after adjustment for age and
comorbidities.4–12 However, these studies have not adjusted
for the fact that women without AMI have a better underlying
prognosis than men without AMI. Notably, most of the literature
reporting survival has used all-cause mortality as the clinical
outcome.5,6 Such analyses are not able to disentangle deaths
related to the disease of interest (ie, AMI in this study) from
deaths due to competing risks. To correct for estimated
mortality due to other causes using background population
mortality data, the method of choice is relative survival.13–16
To our knowledge, no large-scale studies have used this
technique to evaluate sex differences in survival after AMI.
Consequently, we aimed to estimate the impact of sex on
relative survival and excess mortality following AMI using a
population-based cohort within a relative survival framework
and to identify factors associated with differences in survival.
Methods
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be
made
available
to
other
researchers
for
purposes
of
reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. Institu-
tional review board approval was obtained, according to the
JAHA guidelines. No informed consent was required.
Patients, Setting, and Inclusion Criteria
We included all hospitals in Sweden (n=73) that provided care
for patients with AMI. Eligible patients (n=180 368) were
those aged >18 years who had been hospitalized for AMI
between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2013 (Table S1).
All patients were censored on December 31, 2013. For
multiple admissions, we used the earliest record. Patient-level
data concerning demographics, comorbidities, cardiovascular
risk factors, and treatments at discharge were extracted from
SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web System for Enhancement and
Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease
Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies), a popula-
tion-based registry of outcomes for patients hospitalized with
acute coronary syndrome. SWEDEHEART is a Web-based
system, and all data are registered by the caregiver (physi-
cians and nurses) during acute care. The registry is regularly
monitored with 95% to 96% agreement between register and
electronic health records; more details about the registry and
validity have been published elsewhere.17 Baseline data were
also enriched by linking SWEDEHEART to the National Patient
Register, including all International Classification of Diseases
codes for all admissions to Swedish hospitals since 1987.
Cases of AMI were defined as ST-segment–elevation myocar-
dial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI), according to
the current European Society of Cardiology, American College
of Cardiology, and American Heart Association guidelines and
determined at the local level by the attending physician.18 The
data flow for the derivation of the analytical cohort is shown in
Figure 1.
Observed Survival
Data
for
all-cause
mortality
for
patients
recorded
in
SWEDEHEART were extracted through linkage to the National
Population Registry in Sweden using each patient’s unique
identifier. Patients were followed up for their vital status after
hospitalization for AMI, with censoring at the end of follow-up
on December 31, 2013 (Figure 1). Survival time was defined
as the duration between date of hospital admission for AMI
and date of death, date of last follow-up for vital status, or end
of the study censoring period.
Expected Survival
Expected survival was derived from the general population of
Sweden matched by age, sex, and year of hospitalization to
observed survival for the SWEDEHEART registry patients. This
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• We found a survival disadvantage for women with ST-
segment–elevation
myocardial
infarction
and
non–ST-
segment–elevation myocardial infarction who were followed
for 10 years after acute myocardial infarction.
• These sex differences in excess mortality persisted after
adjusting for age and comorbidities.
• However, the differences in excess mortality decreased or
disappeared after adjusting for the use of evidence-based
treatments.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Our novel findings suggest that if treatments for acute
myocardial infarction were provided equally between sexes,
then differences in deaths between men and women would
be smaller and premature cardiovascular deaths among
women would be reduced.

 analysis was undertaken using life tables obtained from the
Human Mortality Database of Sweden (http://www.mortality.
org) and included 1 093 480 matched deaths.
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was excess mortality at 6 months,
1 year, and 5 years following hospitalization with AMI.
Statistical Analyses
Differences in baseline characteristics by sex were evaluated
using percentages to describe categorical variables and
means and standard deviations for continuous normally
distributed variables (all continuous variables were normally
distributed). Logistic regression, with and without adjustment
for age and comorbidities, was used to evaluate sex
differences in the odds of receiving treatment at discharge,
represented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs).
Relative survival was defined as the observed survival
among patients with STEMI and NSTEMI divided by expected
survival in the age-, sex-, and year-matched populace of
Sweden.
We used flexible parametric survival models to calculate
excess mortality following AMI, associated with sex. The
flexible parametric approach allowed the incorporation of
time-dependent effects and used restricted cubic spline

 functions to estimate the baseline cumulative hazard func-
tion.19 The base model (model 1) included age (≤55, 56 to
≤65,
66
to
≤75
[reference
group],
76
to
≤85,
and
>85 years), sex, and year of hospitalization (2003–2005
[reference group], 2006–2008, 2009–2011, and 2012–
2013). Subsequently, a case mix model (model 2) was fitted
that included the base variables (age, sex, year of hospital-
ization) and comorbidities (history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vas-
cular disease, heart failure, chronic renal failure, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease) to test whether the effect of
sex on excess mortality would change. To this model we then
added (model 3) the use of guideline-indicated treatments for
AMI including reperfusion therapy (fibrinolysis or primary
percutaneous coronary intervention, only for patients with
STEMI), any revascularization (percutaneous coronary inter-
vention or coronary artery bypass grafting surgery), and
medications at discharge from the hospital (aspirin, b-
blockers, HMG-CoA [5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl–coenzyme A]
reductase inhibitors [statins], angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, P2Y12 inhibitors).
Obtained estimates from these incremental models were
presented at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years of follow-up and
calculated separately for STEMI and NSTEMI. Results were
presented
as
adjusted
excess
mortality
rate
ratios
(EMRRs).20,21 Evidence of excess mortality is observed when
the EMRR is >1 (an EMRR of 1.5 for women compared with
men indicates that women experience 50% higher excess
mortality than men).
For all models, the hazard was selected as the model’s
scale. The degrees of freedom for the fitted model were
determined using the Akaike information criterion, the
Bayesian information criterion, and the likelihood ratio test.
The proportional excess hazards assumption was assessed
by incorporating time-dependent effects among age, sex,
year, and timescale and assessed using the likelihood ratio
test. Given the effects of age, sex, and year of hospitaliza-
tion varied across time, interaction terms between age, sex,
and year of hospitalization and time were added to the
models. Adding the age9sex interaction to the models had
no significant effect on improving the model fit, as assessed
using the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian infor-
mation criterion, and the likelihood ratio test. We compared
mortality rate ratios (MRRs) calculated using a Cox model
(all-cause mortality) with those from the flexible parametric
relative survival model. Finally, we investigated the impact
of increasing age on excess mortality from AMI due to sex
by
fitting
the
full
flexible
parametric
survival
models
according to age group and comparing the relative risk of
change of EMRR between patients aged ≤55 years with
those aged >85 years. All analyses were performed using
complete case data because of the limited number of
missing values (Table S2). All tests were 2-tailed, with the
level of statistical significance prespecified at 5% (P<0.05).
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version
14.2 (StataCorp).
Results
There were 60 712 (33.7%) patients with STEMI (mean age:
68.9 years [SD: 12.6]; 33.2% women) and 119 656 (66.3%)
with NSTEMI (mean age: 72.4 years [SD: 12.0]; 37.8%
women). Women with STEMI (mean age: 73.7 years [SD:
12.2] versus 66.5 years [SD: 12.1]) and NSTEMI (mean age:
75.6 years [SD: 11.5] versus 70.4 years [SD: 11.9]) were
older than men and also more comorbid, being more likely
to have diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, they were
less likely to be smokers and to have had prior myocardial
infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary
artery bypass grafting surgery (Table 1 and Tables S3 and
S4). At presentation to the hospital, women were more
likely to have a systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, heart
rate >110 beats/min, and receive loop diuretics during
their hospital stay (Table 1). Women were less likely than
men to receive guideline-indicated pharmacological and
invasive
coronary
treatments
(Table 1,
Figure 2,
and
Table S5).
Standard Survival of All-Cause Mortality (Cox
Model)
For
women,
there
were
30 202
(46.2%)
deaths
over
271 824 person-years at risk, and for men there were
39 702 (34.5%) deaths over 540 771 person-years at risk.
The median time to death was shorter for women than for
men (1.7 years [interquartile range: 0.3–4.3 years] versus
1.9 years (interquartile range: 0.3–4.6 years]; P<0.001). For
STEMI, all-cause mortality analysis showed no sex difference
in mortality adjusted for age, year of hospitalization, and
comorbidities at 6 months (MRR: 1.02 [95% CI, 0.98–1.06]),
1 year (MRR: 1.01 [95% CI, 0.96–1.05]), and 5 years (MRR:
1.03; 95% CI, 0.99–1.07]). For NSTEMI, women showed a
small
reduction
in
mortality
compared
with
men
at
6 months (MRR: 0.96 [95% CI, 0.94–0.99]), 1 year (MRR:
0.97 [95% CI, 0.95–0.99]), and 5 years (MRR: 0.97 [95% CI,
0.95–0.99]). However, after further adjusting for treatments,
women with STEMI and NSTEMI each had reduced all-cause
mortality at 6 months (MRR: 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91–0.98]) and
0.88 [95% CI, 0.86–0.90]), 1 year (MRR: 0.92 [95% CI,
0.89–0.96] and 0.88 [95% CI, 0.87–0.90]), and 5 years
(MRR: 0.93 [95% CI, 0.89–0.96] and 0.89 [95% CI, 0.87–
0.91]; Table 2).

 Relative Survival and Excess Mortality
The estimated average relative survival adjusted for age and
year was lower for women with STEMI than for men at
6 months (84.8% versus 87.6%), 1 year (83.2% versus 86.8%),
and 5 years (75.1% versus 82.4%). For NSTEMI, the difference
in relative survival between men and women was not evident
at 6 months (90.0% versus 89.6%) and 1 year (86.9% versus
87.0%); however, women with NSTEMI had lower relative
survival than men at 5 years (73.1% versus 76.0%).
Women with STEMI had a 2-fold increase in excess
mortality after adjustment for age and year of hospital
admission at 6 months (EMRR: 2.12 [95% CI, 1.85–2.42]), a
3-fold increase at 1 year (EMRR: 3.29 [95% CI, 2.40–4.51]),
and an almost 2-fold increase at 5 years (EMRR: 1.91[ 95% CI,
1.73–2.10]). For NSTEMI, the effects were smaller but
statistically significant at 6 months (EMRR: 1.14 [95% CI,
1.10–1.18]), 1 year (EMRR: 1.24 [95% CI, 1.19–1.29]), and
5 years (EMRR: 1.35 [95% CI, 1.28–1.42]; Table 2 and
Figure 3).
After additive adjustment for comorbidities, women with
STEMI and NSTEMI continued to demonstrate significant
excess mortality at each of the follow-up time points (Table 2
and Figure 3). After further adjustment for the use of
guideline-indicated
treatments,
excess
mortality
among
women with NSTEMI was no longer significant at 6 months
(EMRR: 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94–1.00]) and 1 year (EMRR: 1.01
[95% CI, 0.97–1.04]), but remained at 5 years (EMRR: 1.07
[95% CI, 1.02–1.12]). For STEMI, adjustment for treatments
reduced excess mortality for women compared with men at
6 months (EMRR: 1.26 [95% CI, 1.16–1.37]), 1 year (EMRR:
1.43[ 95% CI, 1.26–1.62]), and 5 years (EMRR: 1.31 [95% CI,
1.19–1.43]; Table 2 and Figure 3). With increasing age, the
risk of excess mortality after adjustment for comorbidities
and treatments increased for women with STEMI (age
>85 versus ≤55 years, EMRR: 2.85 [95% CI, 2.26–3.60])
and NSTEMI (age >85 versus ≤55 years, EMRR: 4.07 [95% CI,
3.38–4.92]). A similar association of excess mortality and
increased age was found for men with STEMI (age >85 versus
≤55 years, EMRR: 2.27 [95% CI, 1.85–2.80]; Figure 4A) and
NSTEMI (age >85 versus ≤55 years, EMRR: 2.93 [95% CI,
2.56–3.35; Figure 4B), and there was no significant interac-
tion between sex and age.
Discussion
This nationwide study of >180 000 patients with AMI
contains several novel and important findings relevant to
clinical practice. We found that women after AMI, despite
similar adjusted all-cause mortality, had much worse relative
survival and higher excess mortality than men. This was most
evident for patients with STEMI. Whilst the magnitude of the

 association was reduced when comorbidities were consid-
ered; however, after additional adjustment for the use of
evidence-based treatments, the differences in excess mortal-
ity between women and men were further reduced for STEMI
and eliminated at up to 1 year for NSTEMI. Moreover, sex-
dependent differences in excess mortality increased with
increasing age. Taken together, these data suggest that the
impact of AMI is greater in women and that better adherence
to guideline-indicated care for women may result in improved
survival of AMI and more equitable cardiovascular outcomes
between the sexes.
In line with results of previous studies, we found that
women were older than men and more likely to have
comorbidities but less likely to smoke.5,6,22 Despite the
international
recommendations
for
equal
treatment
of
women and men presenting with AMI,23 we found that
women were less likely to receive reperfusion and revascu-
larization therapies and to be prescribed guideline-indicated
pharmacological therapies at the time of discharge from the
hospital. We found that the lower rates of use of evidence-
based medications and invasive procedures could not be
fully explained by confounding factors such as age and
comorbidities. These differences may partly be explained by
a higher incidence of myocardial infarction with nonobstruc-
tive
coronary
arteries
in
women,24,25
for
which
most
treatments lack evidence from clinical trials. Still, this may
indicate inequalities in medical care provision between sexes
and may lead to increased mortality among women with AMI
compared with men.
When we studied all-cause mortality in patients with AMI
(rather than relative survival), we found that sex differences
were no longer significant for STEMI, whereas women with
NSTEMI had a better prognosis than men. These findings
agree with most earlier studies4–12,26 in which standard
survival analyses were applied. Using the relative survival
approach, we found that women with STEMI and NSTEMI had
higher excess mortality rates compared with their male
counterparts.
Unlike
standard
survival,
relative
survival
accounts for differences in background mortality across
groups, allowing for the distinction between death due to the
index AMI and deaths due to other causes, and avoids the risk
of classification errors in cause-of-death records.27 Our
results and the findings of a recent study by Baart et al13
illustrate that measuring relative survival and excess mortality
may have important implications for acute coronary care.
Earlier studies suggested that sex differences following
AMI could be due to the higher cardiovascular risk factor
profile, older age, later presentation, delayed revasculariza-
tion, underdiagnosis, and less aggressive and evidence-based
treatment in women compared with men.28–33 Although these
remain plausible, we found that women with STEMI and
NSTEMI had excess mortality compared with men despite
adjustment for their demographics and cardiovascular profile.
It was only after we further adjusted for treatments used that
the differences in excess mortality between the sexes
decreased and, for NSTEMI, disappeared. For NSTEMI, the
differences in excess mortality were mitigated after adjust-
ment for the use of treatments at up to, but not beyond

risk cases of AMI require more intensive and persistent or
novel therapeutic interventions to achieve ongoing equipoise
in outcomes between the sexes.34,35
We also found that excess mortality increased with
increasing age. This was evident both for STEMI and NSTEMI
in women >85 years, with >2-fold higher excess mortality
than their younger counterparts. Similarly, men with STEMI

 and NSTEMI who were aged >85 years had 2-fold higher
excess mortality compared with men <55 years. Age was
significantly associated with excess mortality even after
adjusting for sex, comorbidities, and treatments. However,
care must be taken in interpreting this result because it is
possible that other unmeasured comorbidities were present in
the older adults that may have biased the estimates.36,37
Our findings have important implications regarding care
and outcomes in women, particularly as patients with AMI are
living much longer.38 We clearly showed that the gap in
mortality between the sexes decreased for STEMI and almost
disappeared for NSTEMI after adjusting for treatments at
discharge. Thus, there may be greater potential to realize the
benefits of healthcare quality improvement efforts in women
than in men.
Although this study has strengths, including the size, the
high quality, and the completeness of the data set, there are
also
limitations.
Expected
survival
probabilities
were
calculated from general population life tables that are
stratified only by age, sex, and calendar year. The concept
of relative survival relies on comparing the survival probabil-
ities of a diseased population (eg, patients with AMI) to the
survival probabilities of the general population of the same
demographic structure. However, we were not able to match
for other factors influencing outcome, such as comorbidities,
socioeconomical status, and ethnicity. Consequently, the
excess mortality may be related not only to AMI but also to
other differences between the diseased and the general
population. Such differences may be more pronounced in
older adults.39 We did not correct for the prevalence of AMI in
the general population, and this may have overinflated survival
estimates in our AMI population group.20,40 However, because
the prevalence of AMI in the Swedish general population is
small, adjustment to address this issue would most likely have
a small impact. Although extensive adjustments have been
made, our study still lacks data regarding some important

 patient characteristics, such as coronary anatomy, left
ventricular ejection fraction, and signs of hemodynamic
instability and subsequent outpatient follow-up data, which
may have shed more light on the reasons for the differences
in outcome. Another limitation is that data were available only
at discharge. It is important to investigate the level of
adherence to evidence-based treatments after AMI discharge
and its impact on long-term survival.
Conclusion
Women with AMI in Sweden had lower relative survival and
higher excess mortality compared with men, which persisted
from date of hospitalization and increased with age. Excess
mortality among women reduced only after adjustment for the
use of guideline-indicated treatments. This finding suggests
that improved adherence to guideline recommendations for
the treatment of AMI may reduce premature cardiovascular
death among women.
