The effect of replacing saturated fat with
mostly n-6 polyunsaturated fat on coronary
heart disease: a meta-analysis of
randomised controlled trials
Steven Hamley
Abstract
Background: A cornerstone of conventional dietary advice is the recommendation to replace saturated fatty acids
(SFA) with mostly n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Many
clinical trials aimed to test this advice and have had their results pooled in several meta-analyses. However, earlier
meta-analyses did not sufficiently account for major confounding variables that were present in some of those trials.
Therefore, the aim of the study was to account for the major confounding variables in the diet heart trials, and
emphasise the results from those trials that most accurately test the effect of replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA.
Design: Clinical trials were identified from earlier meta-analyses. Relevant trials were categorised as ‘adequately
controlled’ or ‘inadequately controlled’ depending on whether there were substantial dietary or non-dietary differences
between the experimental and control groups that were not related to SFA or mostly n-6 PUFA intake, then were
subject to different subgroup analyses.
Results: When pooling results from only the adequately controlled trials there was no effect for major CHD events
(RR = 1.06, CI = 0.86–1.31), total CHD events (RR = 1.02, CI = 0.84–1.23), CHD mortality (RR = 1.13, CI = 0.91–1.40) and total
mortality (RR = 1.07, CI = 0.90–1.26). Whereas, the pooled results from all trials, including the inadequately controlled
trials, suggested that replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA would significantly reduce the risk of total CHD events
(RR = 0.80, CI = 0.65–0.98, P = 0.03), but not major CHD events (RR = 0.87, CI = 0.70–1.07), CHD mortality (RR = 0.90,
CI = 0.70–1.17) and total mortality (RR = 1.00, CI = 0.90–1.10).
Conclusion: Available evidence from adequately controlled randomised controlled trials suggest replacing SFA with
mostly n-6 PUFA is unlikely to reduce CHD events, CHD mortality or total mortality. The suggestion of benefits reported
in earlier meta-analyses is due to the inclusion of inadequately controlled trials. These findings have implications for
current dietary recommendations.

 Introduction
A cornerstone of conventional dietary advice is the
recommendation to reduce the intake of saturated fatty
acids (SFA) as a means of reducing the risk of coronary
heart disease (CHD). There are a few variations of this
recommendation, these include: 1) advice to reduce the
intake of SFA; 2) advice to replace SFA with monoun-
saturated fatty acids (MUFA) and mostly n-6 polyunsat-
urated fatty acids (PUFA); and 3) advice to replace SFA
with mostly n-6 PUFA. Altogether, it is perhaps the sin-
gle most influential recommendation in conventional
dietary advice. It provides the basis to recommend low
fat dairy and lean meats over full fat dairy and fattier
cuts of meat; to recommend margarine and vegetable
oils instead of butter and animal fats; and may lead to a
greater emphasis on plant foods over animal foods.
However, the evidence underlying this recommendation
has been questioned by recent meta-analyses of observa-
tional studies and clinical trials [1–5].
Fatty acids and plasma cholesterol: the total concen-
tration of plasma cholesterol (total-C) was one of the
earliest risk factors identified for CHD and formed the
basis of the lipid hypothesis, which is that reducing
total-C would be expected to lower the risk of CHD [6].
A number of metabolic studies beginning in the 1950’s
identified SFA and n-6 PUFA as major dietary influences
of total-C [7]. This led to the development of the diet
heart hypothesis, that decreasing SFA and/or increasing
n-6 PUFA would be expected to lower the risk of CHD
[8]. However, more recent evidence has identified the
total-C:HDL-C ratio as being the measure of plasma
cholesterol that is most predictive of CHD and is twice
as predictive as total-C [9]. Therefore, the original lipid
hypothesis and diet heart hypothesis should be modified
to make predictions based on the total-C:HDL-C ratio,
rather than total-C. When compared to carbohydrate,
SFA does not significantly affect the total-C:HDL-C ratio
as it raises both LDL-C and HDL-C [10], a point that is
often ignored [11], although replacing SFA with either
MUFA or PUFA would still lower the total-C:HDL-C
ratio [10]. Consequently, as the fat in food is a mix of
SFA,
MUFA
and
PUFA,
isocaloric
substitution
of
carbohydrates with fat would be expected to reduce the
total-C:HDL-C ratio [10].
Evidence from observational studies: meta-analyses of
observational studies have consistently found that the
intake of SFA is not independently associated with the
incidence of CHD [1, 3, 12–16]. While some meta-
analyses have found replacing SFA with PUFA is associ-
ated with a lower risk of CHD [12, 15], those results are
not specific for SFA. Jakobsen et al. [12] found that
replacing SFA with either MUFA or carbohydrate was
not associated with a lower risk of CHD, while Farvid et
al. [15] found that a higher intake of linoleic acid (18:2
n-6) was associated with a lower risk of CHD both inde-
pendently and regardless of whether SFA or carbohy-
drate was replaced with linoleic acid. However, other
meta-analyses of observational studies have not consist-
ently found an inverse association between PUFA intake
and CHD [3, 13, 14].
Evidence from clinical trials: there are several meta-
analyses of clinical trials that aimed to test the diet heart
hypothesis [3–5, 14, 17–20]. Half of these meta-analyses
found a significant (P < 0.05) or near significant (P < 0.10)
reduction in risk for CHD or cardiovascular disease
(CVD) events when SFA was reduced or was replaced
with mostly n-6 PUFA [14, 17–19]. Only Mozaffarian et
al. [19] found a significant or near significant reduction in
risk for CHD mortality, and only Skeaff & Miller [14]
found a significant or near significant reduction in risk for
total mortality (Table 1). The variation in results between
the meta-analyses is partially due to differences in the
clinical trials each of them included and, where relevant,
how they were categorised, both of which are presented in
Table 2. Despite slightly different aims, there is some
consistency in the clinical trials included in these meta-
analyses, with eight of the nineteen trials being included
in a majority of them. Those eight trials [21–28], and an-
other three [29–31], all involved replacing SFA with
mostly n-6 PUFA. Those eleven trials will be referred
to as the diet heart trials, with regard to the diet
heart hypothesis, and are the focus of this study. The
remaining trials included two with a Mediterranean
diet intervention [32, 33] and six with a reduced fat
intervention [34–39], neither of which strictly reduced
SFA intake or replaced SFA with either carbohydrates,
MUFA and/or PUFA, and each of which were only
included in just one of the modified fat and reduced
SFA meta-analyses respectively. As such, there is little
evidence from clinical trials on the effect that reducing
SFA in isolation, or replacing it with MUFA or carbohy-
drate, has on the risk of CHD or CVD outcomes, with the
only trial to test either of these being the olive oil arm of
the Rose Corn Oil Trial [21]. With disagreement between
the meta-analyses on which trials to include, how they
should be categorised and whether replacing SFA with
mostly n-6 PUFA reduces CHD/CVD, closely examining
the diet heart trials may help to resolve these issues.
Upon inspection of the diet heart trials it is clear that
many of them had substantial dietary or non-dietary
differences between the intervention groups that were
not related to SFA or mostly n-6 PUFA intake. The first
indication of this is the categorisation of the diet heart
trials by Hooper et al. [17] as either modified fat or both
modified and reduced fat and by Ramsden et al. [5] as
replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA or also increasing
long chain n-3 PUFA. But the differences in the diet
heart trials go beyond reduced fat or higher long chain

 n-3 PUFA diets, and many of those differences have
rarely been or yet to be acknowledged by the earlier
meta-analyses.
Trans fatty acids: in some of the diet heart trials, only
the experimental group (the high n-6 PUFA group) re-
ceived advice to avoid major sources of industrial trans
fatty acids (TFA), such as common/hard margarines, short-
enings and/or hydrogenated oils [21, 22, 25, 28, 40, 41].
While in the other trials, the experimental group were pro-
vided with a lower amount of these foods compared to the
control group (the high SFA group) [26, 29, 31, 42, 43]
(Additional file 1). Therefore, in all the diet heart trials, the
experimental group would be expected to have a lower in-
take of TFA compared to the control group. This was dis-
cussed by Ramsden et al. [2] in an earlier version of their
meta-analysis, who described the diet heart trials as re-
placing both SFA and TFA with PUFA. TFA intake was
only directly measured in STARS, where the experimental
group had a much lower intake of TFA compared to the
control group (1.08 vs. 1.80% of total energy intake) [44].
Ramsden et al. [2] estimated TFA intake in the control
groups based on national food consumption data, but
was only able to describe the TFA intake in most of
the experimental groups as ‘restricted’. These estima-
tions suggested most of the control groups had TFA
intakes of approximately 1.5–2.5% of total energy
intake, consistent with the control group in STARS,
except that the
control group in ODHS had an
estimated TFA intake of 9.6% of total energy intake,
due to the high use of hydrogenated marine oils in
Norway at the time of the trial [2]. Due to the more
detailed dietary information provided in FMHS [43],
Ramsden et al. [2] was able to estimate TFA intake in
both of the groups and found TFA intake to be lower
in the experimental group in both hospital K (0.0 vs.
2.0% of total energy intake) and hospital N (0.2 vs.
0.6% of total energy intake). Ramsden et al. did not
include NDHS or HDAT in any version of their
meta-analysis or discuss TFA intake in either of those
trials [2, 5, 45], but the diets provided to the control
group in both NDHS and HDAT were most likely
very high in TFA. Specifically, in NDHS, diet D in
the first study and half the D diet groups in the sec-
ond study were instructed to purchase ‘filled’ foods in
which the fat was taken out and replaced with “either
animal fat or hydrogenated shortening” [29]. Whereas
in HDAT, the major source of fat for most of the
participants in the control group was reported to be
“saturated margarines” [31]. As the average choles-
terol intake in the control group was identical to the
experimental group and was 41% lower than the
participants in the control group who ate butter, the
‘saturated margarines’ were not of animal origin and
most likely comprised of hydrogenated vegetable oils [31].
The relative intake of TFA between the experimental
group and control group in SDHS is controversial and less

 clear. The experimental group was advised to replace
common margarines and shortenings with both liquid
safflower
oil
and
Miracle
Margarine
[45],
which
would be expected to reduce TFA intake. However, it
is argued that the experimental group may have had
a higher intake of TFA due to the use of Miracle
Margarine, which has been suggested to have been
rich in TFA at the time of the trial [46]. Therefore, it
is possible that TFA intake in the experimental group
was either higher, lower or similar to the control
group. In response to Gutierrez [46], Ramsden et al.
[47] argued that TFA intakes were likely similar be-
tween the groups based on the dietary differences
briefly described above, the observed group differ-
ences in serum cholesterol and that adjusting for
MUFA intake (an imperfect surrogate for trans fats as
noted by Ramsden et al. [45]) did not have a notice-
able effect on the results [47]. Differences in TFA in-
take between the experimental and control groups
was not discussed by any of the other meta-analyses.
Multifactorial
dietary
interventions:
ODHS
and
STARS both used a multifactorial dietary intervention,
in which the dietary advice given to the experimental
group included much more than just replacing SFA with
mostly n-6 PUFA. Other dietary differences besides TFA
intake included: 1) a higher intake of long chain n-3
PUFA (2.0% vs. usual intake (ODHS) [2] and 0.21 vs.
0.10% (STARS) [44]; 2) advice to consume more whole
plant foods (ODHS [22] and STARS [44]); 3) advice to
moderate sugar consumption and to increase fish and
shellfish (ODHS) [22]; 4) sardines canned in cod liver oil
that were supplied to the experimental group (ODHS)
[22]; 5) advice to “avoid processed foods (eg, cookies,
pastry, cakes)” (STARS) [28]; 6) advice to increase “plant-
derived
soluble
fibre
(chiefly
pectin)”
by
3.6
g/
1000 kcal (STARS) [28]; and 7) a low calorie diet (1000–
1200 kcal) that was prescribed for overweight participants
(STARS) [28] (Additional file 1). Hooper et al. [17] judged
ODHS and STARS as having a ‘high risk’ of bias related to
being ‘free of dietary differences other than fat’
, but

aHooper et al. (2012) categorised trials as either modified fat (M) or both modified and reduced fat (M,R) trials. NDHS included several experimental groups, some
of which were prescribed a modified fat diet and others were prescribed a reduced and modified fat diet. Hooper et al. (2012) included these experimental
groups individually and categorised them according to their dietary advice (Both). bHooper et al. (2012), Harcombe et al. (2015) and Hooper et al. (2015) included
both the olive oil (MUFA) and the corn oil (n-6 PUFA) arms of RCOT as these meta-analyses examined the effect of fat modification. cRamsden et al. included trials
that replaced SFA with mainly n-6 PUFA in their main analysis (MA) and conducted a sensitivity analysis (SA) that included trials that also increased intake of long
chain n-3 PUFA in addition to replacing SFA with mainly n-6 PUFA (ODHS and STARS) or where participants were only provided with dietary advice (DART)

 included ODHS as a fat modification trial and STARS as a
reduced and modified fat trial. Ramsden et al. discussed
this issue in the 2010 and 2016 versions of their
meta-analysis [2, 5], but included ODHS and STARS
in a sensitivity analysis and categorised them as trials
that increased both n-6 and long chain n-3 PUFA [5].
The use of a multifactorial dietary intervention in
either ODHS or STARS was not discussed by any of
the other meta-analyses [3, 4, 14, 18–20].
Vitamin E: in LAVAT, α-tocopherol intake in the con-
trol group was 9.4-fold lower than the experimental
group (22.6 mg vs. 2.4 mg) [48] and only 16.0% of the
current RDA (15 mg) [49]. Based on the average energy
intake of the control group reported in the vitamin E
paper (2400 kcal) [48] and the estimated energy intake
(3150 kcal) and vitamin E (11.54 mg of α-tocopherol
equivalents) per capita in the United States food supply
between 1959–1968 [50], the vitamin E intake of the
control group would be expected to be about 8.79 mg of
α-tocopherol equivalents. This was not discussed by any
of the meta-analyses.
Cardiotoxic medication: the control group in FMHS
received more thioridazine in hospital N (0.82 vs. 1.79 aver-
age number of ‘normal doses’ per patient per day) and
slightly less in hospital K (0.43 vs. 0.14), which averaged to
an overall greater use in the control group (0.63 vs. 0.97)
[43]. Ramsden et al. [2] discusses this issue and cites re-
search that found thioridazine can cause electrocardiogram
anomalies, which was the measure of CHD events in
FMHS, and substantially increases the risk of sudden death.
This was not discussed by any of the other meta-analyses.
An important aspect of randomised controlled trials is
that the groups in the trial are treated identically except
for the experimental treatment. This is to ensure that any
differences between the groups in the outcome measures
being tested are due to the experimental treatment and
not due to another factor [51]. This can be challenging
with dietary interventions but, at the very least, they
should be free of the major differences that are mentioned
in the previous paragraphs. These critical differences
between the intervention groups have most likely substan-
tially affected the results of those trials. The earlier meta-
analyses either did not sufficiently acknowledge these
issues or were simply not aware of such confounding fac-
tors. Therefore the aim of this meta-analysis is to account
for the differences not related to SFA or mostly n-6 PUFA
intake in the diet heart trials and to emphasise the results
from those trials that most accurately test the effect of
replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA.
Methods
I followed the PRISMA (www.prisma-statement.org)
guidelines [52] throughout the design, implementation,
analysis, and reporting of this meta-analysis.
Literature search and eligibility criteria
A protocol for this meta-analysis has not been regis-
tered. The literature on clinical trials that examined the
effect that replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA has on
CHD has already been thoroughly and recently searched
by earlier meta-analyses [3–5, 14, 17–20], including two
Cochrane meta-analyses by Hooper et al. [17, 18] that
each
contain
a
very
comprehensive
reference
list.
Clinical trials and their manuscripts were identified from
these earlier meta-analyses. Trials were included if CHD
events, CHD mortality or total mortality were reported,
and if the trial involved replacing SFA with mostly n-6
PUFA. The latter was assessed on whether the trial had
a control group and simultaneous decrease in SFA and
increase in mostly n-6 PUFA of at least 20% in an
experimental group, or if not reported, where the dietary
advice provided strongly suggests that this occurred.
Nineteen trials were identified (Table 2). Eleven trials
were included (RCOT [21], ODHS [22], NDHS [29],
MRCT [23, 40], LAVAT [24, 48, 53, 54], FMHS [30, 43,
55–58], SDHS [25, 45], HDAT [31], MCS [5, 26], DART
[27, 41, 59] and STARS [28, 44]). RCOT, ODHS, MRCT
and HDAT did not report SFA and PUFA intakes for
both the experimental and control groups. However, the
dietary advice provided to the experimental group in
RCOT, ODHS and MRCT included comprehensive
advice to substantially reduce SFA intake and very
large doses of mostly n-6 PUFA rich oils to be taken daily
[21, 22, 40], while the control group in HDAT was de-
scribed as rich in SFA (“saturated fats 35 cal%”) and had a
4-fold lower intake of PUFA [31] (Additional file 1). Eight
trials were excluded (Ball et al. [34], Black et al. [35], Moy
et al. [36], Sondergaard et al. [32], Ley et al. [37], WHI
[38], WINS [39] and MeDiet [33]), as the dietary informa-
tion reported from each of these trials indicates that none
had an intervention group that had a simultaneous de-
crease in SFA and increase in PUFA of at least 20% in an
experimental group. Authors were contacted directly to
request missing data or to clarify methods or results when
necessary.
Categorisation of the diet heart trials as ‘adequately
controlled’ or ‘inadequately controlled’
As discussed in the introduction, there were many differ-
ences in the diet heart trials that were not related to
SFA or mostly n-6 PUFA intake. In all of the diet heart
trials the dietary advice or foods provided to participants
would be expected to result in a lower TFA intake in the
experimental group compared to the control group,
particularly in ODHS, NDHS and HDAT. However, it is
debated whether the experimental group in SDHS may
have had a higher intake of TFA due to the use of a
margarine that was potentially high in TFA. Further-
more, ODHS and STARS used a multifactorial dietary

 intervention, the control group in LAVAT had an insuf-
ficient vitamin E intake that was also 9.4-fold lower than
the experimental group, and the control group in FMHS
was prescribed more cardiotoxic medication on average.
Therefore, to account for these differences, the clinical
trials in this meta-analysis were categorised as ‘ad-
equately controlled’ or ‘inadequately controlled’ and
were subject to different subgroup analyses. Clinical tri-
als categorised as adequately controlled are those that
most accurately test the effect of replacing SFA with
mostly n-6 PUFA, while the clinical trials categorised as
inadequately controlled have too many dietary and/or
non-dietary differences between the groups to be consid-
ered a valid test of replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA.
The clinical trials categorised as inadequately controlled
include ODHS, NDHS, LAVAT, FMHS, HDAT, and
STARS due to reasons discussed in the introduction and
summarised
above.
The
remaining
trials,
including
RCOT, MRCT, SDHS, MCS, and DART, were cate-
gorised as adequately controlled. Due to debate over
whether TFA intake in the SDHS experimental group
was higher or lower than the control group, this trial
was excluded in a sensitivity analysis of the adequately
controlled trials.

total mortality in FMHS. Calculating the risk ratio (RR)
using person years is important to do as the participants
in those trials were patients in mental hospitals who
could be discharged and readmitted, and any events/
deaths that occurred during their absence would go un-
reported. The difference between calculating the RR
using number of participants in each group rather than
using person years is quite low in MCS [26], whereas
in FMHS calculating the RR using the number of
participants in each group often substantially underes-
timates the RR [30, 57]. The RevMan software auto-
matically
calculates
the
RR
using
the
number
of
events and participants in each group that has been
entered. Therefore the value entered for number of
participants in each group has been altered to pro-
duce the correct RR when measured using person
years or age-adjusted person years, but equal to the
total number of participants in the trial so as to not
affect the weighting of the trial. This was done by
using the following equations. The equation for the
RR using person years, where E is events/deaths and
PY is person years, is: RR = (Eexp∕PYexp)∕(Econ∕PYcon). To
not affect the weighting, the total number of person
years needs to equal the total number of participants:
PYexp + PYcon = Nexp + Ncon. Therefore: PYexp = (Nexp +
Ncon)∕(1 + (RR x Econ∕Eexp)); and PYcon = (Nexp + Ncon)∕(1
+ (Eexp∕(Econ x RR)))
FMHS as an inadequately randomised trial
FMHS has been included in three earlier meta-analyses
that are self-described as a meta-analysis of randomised
controlled trials [3, 14, 19], but has been excluded by
four for inadequate randomisation [2, 4, 17, 18] and its
crossover design [4, 17, 18]. Participants were allocated
by hospital and were not individually randomised in
FMHS, and while it has been suggested to be a cluster
randomised trial [19], there would only have been 2
clusters and there is actually no mention of random
allocation of the hospitals in the publications from the
trial [30, 43, 55–58]. The purpose of randomisation is to
ensure that there as few differences between the groups
at baseline as possible [51] and, in this respect, FMHS
appears to be inadequately randomised. There were a
number of confounding variables, including minor dif-
ferences in baseline characteristics such as age, BMI,
smoking and blood pressure, as well as the critical differ-
ence in cardiotoxic medication use [43, 57]. In addition,
the fact that on average the participants in the control
group remained in the hospitals longer than those in the
experimental group, which led to an overestimation of
the effect size (see above), also points to inadequate ran-
domisation
or
differences
in
treatment.
Therefore,
FMHS was excluded in a separate analysis that only
includes adequately randomised trials.
Statistical analysis
For each outcome measure, a random-effects inverse-
variance meta-analysis was performed to calculate the
RR for: 1) the overall pooled effect for all trials; 2) the
adequately randomised trials (which excluded FMHS); 3)
the adequately controlled trials; 4) the inadequately con-
trolled trials; and 5) the adequately controlled trials
where SDHS was excluded in a sensitivity analysis. All
statistical tests were 2-sided and significance was set at
P < 0.05. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 test,
and considered significant where I2 > 50% [60]. The
potential of publication bias was assessed by visual in-
spection of funnel plots. All data were analysed using
the REVIEW MANAGER V.5.1 software, provided by
the
Cochrane Collaboration (http://ims.cochrane.org/
revman).
Results
Characteristics of the diet heart trials are outlined in
Table 3. Many of the diet heart trials only included
males with pre-existing CHD. Only FMHS, HDAT and
MCS included both men and women, NDHS and HDAT
included participants without pre-existing CHD, and

aData for CHD events in FMHS comes from male and female patients aged 34–64 and 44–64 respectively and “whose initial electrocardiogram was free from coronary patterns”, whereas data for mortality comes from
all patients aged >15. bFor an unknown reason, there were five fewer participants for total CHD events compared to major CHD events [57]. cG Watts, personal communication, April 28, 2016

 LAVAT, FMHS, MCS included participants both with
and without pre-existing CHD. All the trials used a
parallel design, except FMHS, which used a crossover
design.
Dietary information is presented in Additional file 1.
There is a substantial difference in the reported in-
takes of SFA and PUFA between the experimental
and control groups (Table 4), indicating a high level
of compliance. The only exception is STARS, where
PUFA intake differed by only 2.6% of total energy in-
take, reflective of the more modest PUFA target in
STARS (8% of total energy intake) [28]. The relatively
high level of compliance in the diet heart trials is
supported by the consistent reductions in total-C in
the experimental group at follow up, which occurred
in all the diet heart trials except DART and HDAT,
often
with
minimal
change
in
the
control
group
(Table 5).
Major CHD events
When pooling the results of all trials together there
was a total of 1069 major CHD events (includes myo-
cardial infarction and sudden death) in 17077 partici-
pants. The total pooled RR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.70–
1.07, P = 0.19). Exclusion of FMHS as an inadequately
randomised trial increased the pooled RR to 0.93
(95% CI 0.77–1.11, P = 0.40). When only pooling re-
sults from the adequately controlled trials the pooled
RR was 1.06 (95% CI 0.86–1.31, P = 0.59) and exclud-
ing SDHS from this subgroup in a sensitivity analysis
decreased the pooled RR to 0.98 (95% CI 0.83–1.16,
P = 0.80). The results of the adequately controlled
trials
and
the
inadequately
controlled
trials
as
subgroups were significantly different (P = 0.007) and
there was evidence of significant heterogeneity (I2 =
60%; Fig. 1).
Total CHD events
When pooling the results of all trials together there was
a total of 1349 CHD events (also includes soft CHD
events such as angina) in 17072 participants. The total
pooled RR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.65–0.98, P = 0.03). Exclu-
sion of FMHS as an inadequately randomised trial in-
creased the pooled RR to 0.83 (95% CI 0.67–1.03, P =
0.10). When only pooling results from the adequately
controlled trials the pooled RR was 1.02 (95% CI 0.84–
1.23, P = 0.85) and excluding SDHS from this subgroup
in a sensitivity analysis decreased the pooled RR to 0.95
(95%
CI
0.83–1.09,
P = 0.45).
The

trials
and

CHD Mortality
When pooling the results of all trials together there was a
total of 924 deaths due to CHD in 24022 participants. The
total pooled RR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.70–1.17, P = 0.43).
Exclusion of FMHS as an inadequately randomised trial
increased the pooled RR to 0.98 (95% CI 0.79–1.23,
P = 0.88). When only pooling results from the ad-
equately controlled trials the pooled RR was 1.13
(95% CI 0.91–1.40, P = 0.29) and excluding SDHS
from this subgroup in a sensitivity analysis decreased
the pooled RR to 1.04 (95% CI 0.85–1.27, P = 0.71).
The results of the adequately controlled trials and the
inadequately
controlled
trials
as

were

dence of significant heterogeneity (I2 = 65%; Fig. 3).
Total mortality
When pooling the results of all trials together there was
a total of 2614 deaths in 24022 participants. The total
pooled RR was 1.00 (95% CI 0.90–1.10, P = 0.99). Exclu-
sion of FMHS as an inadequately randomised trial did
not alter the RR (RR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.86–1.15, P = 0.91).
When only pooling results from the adequately con-
trolled trials the pooled RR was 1.07 (95% CI 0.90–1.26,

aRCOT did not report either SFA or PUFA intake or the P:S ratio. However, the
corn oil group reported consuming an average of 64 g of corn oil and
2070 kcal per day [21], so the corn oil alone would provide approximately
35.0 g of PUFA [88] or 15.2% of total energy intake from PUFA [21]. bODHS

participants in the experimental group and from none of the participants in
the control group [22]. cThe values for NDHS come from a weighted average
of the experimental and control groups respectively. dMRCT did not report SFA
or PUFA intake for either group. However, the experimental group reported
consuming an average of 80 g of soybean oil and 2380 kcal per day, so the
soybean oil alone would provide approximately 46.2 g of PUFA [88] or 17.5%
of total energy intake from PUFA

 P = 0.45) and excluding SDHS from this subgroup in a
sensitivity analysis decreased the pooled RR to 1.03 (95%
CI 0.90–1.17, P = 0.69). The results of the adequately
controlled trials and the inadequately controlled trials
as subgroups were not significantly different (P = 0.30)
and there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity
(I2 = 26%; Fig. 4).
A summary of the results is presented in Table 6.
Publication bias
Visual inspection of the funnel plots (Additional file 2,
Additional file 3, Additional file 4, Additional file 5: Fig-
ure S4) shows a fairly symmetric distribution. There was
some asymmetry for the funnel plots for major CHD
events (Additional file 2), suggesting the possibility that
some small studies with more major CHD events in the
experimental group may be missing from this review.
Analysis for publication bias is limited by some incon-
sistency in the funnel plots and the small number of
studies included (N = 11), and may simply reflect meth-
odological differences rather than publication bias. How-
ever, it should be noted that CHD and CVD mortality
were not reported in the original publication for SDHS
[25, 45] and that it took approximately 16 years from
the end of the trial (1973) for MCS to be published in a
peer-reviewed article in 1989 [26]. Both SDHS and MCS
were unfavourable trials for the popular diet heart
hypothesis.
Discussion
Available evidence from adequately controlled randomised
controlled trials suggest replacing SFA with mostly n-6
PUFA is unlikely to reduce CHD events, CHD mortality
or total mortality. When the results of all eleven trials are
pooled together it appears that replacing SFA with mostly
n-6 PUFA significantly reduces total CHD events, but not
major CHD events, CHD mortality or total mortality.
However, those analyses include results from inadequately
randomised trials
and inadequately controlled trials.
Excluding FMHS as an inadequately randomised trial
increases the pooled RR towards 1.00 for all outcomes
except total mortality and the reduced risk for total CHD
events loses statistical significance. Excluding the inad-
equately controlled trials and just pooling results from the
adequately controlled trials, shows no significant effect on
any outcome measure, whether SDHS is excluded in the
sensitivity analysis or not. As the adequately controlled tri-
als most accurately test the effect of replacing SFA with
mostly n-6 PUFA, the results of this meta-analysis suggest
that replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA is unlikely to
have either a beneficial or an adverse effect on CHD
events, CHD mortality and total mortality.
A novel approach of this meta-analysis was identifying
the diet heart trials with substantial confounding vari-
ables and then excluding them from the final analysis,
thereby obtaining results from those trials that most
accurately test the effect of replacing SFA with mostly
n-6 PUFA. This was achieved by categorising the tri-
als as adequately controlled or inadequately controlled
depending on whether there were substantial dietary
or non-dietary differences between the experimental
and control groups that were not related to SFA or
mostly n-6 PUFA intake, and then perform a separate
subgroup analysis for each category. Limitations of
this method include that the categorisation is difficult
to be based on criteria developed prior to the litera-
ture review, and that it is an estimation of the effects

aThe values for NDHS come from a weighted average of the experimental and control groups respectively. bDue to the crossover design used in FMHS, only the
values for total cholesterol at the end of each diet period are presented in this table. cThe actual numbers for total plasma cholesterol were not reported in HDAT
and the numbers in this table were estimated from graphs reported in the study. This estimation is consistent with Hooper et al. [18], as they estimated from the
graph that the average plasma cholesterol of the experimental group was 18 mg/dl lower than the control group at the end of the trial

 of the confounding variables in the trials. However,
ODHS, LAVAT, FMHS and STARS had clear evidence
of substantial differences between the experimental
and control groups that were not related to SFA or
mostly n-6 PUFA intake as discussed in the introduc-
tion. In addition, the results add some support to this
method. There was significant heterogeneity for major
CHD events, total CHD events and CHD mortality,
indicating a strong likelihood of there being methodo-
logical differences between the diet heart trials. Fur-
thermore, there was a significant difference between
the two subgroups for major CHD events, total CHD
events and CHD mortality. Another limitation of this
method is that NDHS and HDAT were classified as
inadequately controlled as the control groups in those
trials most likely had a substantially higher TFA in-
take than the experimental groups, but this is not
certain. However, the results add some support to the
categorisation of these trials as inadequately con-
trolled as well. Notably, NDHS had a stronger effect
size than the pooled result of the inadequately con-
trolled trials and HDAT had a stronger effect size
than all the other inadequately controlled trials. These
results add concern that those trials were indeed con-
founded by substantial differences in TFA intake.
There is debate over whether TFA intake in the SDHS
experimental group was higher or lower than the control
group. Therefore, the second method was to exclude
SDHS in a sensitivity analysis of the adequately con-
trolled trials. The results add some support to this
method as well. SDHS was an outlier in the adequately
controlled trials and responsible for most of the hetero-
geneity in this subgroup, suggesting that TFA intake
may have been higher in the experimental group of
SDHS. However, this could alternatively be explained by
the other adequately controlled trials being confounded
by small differences in TFA intake and other small diet-
ary differences, in combination with the explanations by
Ramsden et al. that TFA is unlikely to been a major fac-
tor in SDHS [45, 47]. The experimental groups of the
adequately controlled trials were instructed to avoid
“fried foods, pastry and cakes (except plain sponge)”
(RCOT) [21]; “other margarines, cooking fat, other oils
and most biscuits and cakes” (MRCT) [23]; and to limit
other sources of fat “(e.g. cakes, pastries, biscuits, meat
pies and pasties, crisps, chocolates and toffees)” to four
portions per week with at least two to be made with a
polyunsaturated fat (DART) [41]; and in the case of
MCS, using corn oil in place of the usual hospital cook-
ing fats that included hydrogenated oils, and from the
control group receiving common margarines and short-
enings [5]. Therefore, the actual RR of replacing SFA
with mostly n-6 PUFA may be higher than what is re-
ported in this study had TFA intake been better con-
trolled for in those trials, and excluding SDHS in the
sensitivity analysis may have been inappropriate.
CHD events and mortality: half the earlier meta-
analyses reported a significant or near significant reduc-
tion in risk for CHD/CVD events [14, 17–19], and
almost all the earlier meta-analyses did not find a
significant reduction in risk for CHD/CVD mortality
[3–5, 14, 17, 18, 20]. When pooling the results of all tri-
als together this meta-analysis obtained a similar result,
with a significant reduction in risk for total CHD events,
but not for major CHD events and CHD mortality. When
only pooling results from the adequately controlled trials,
the RR for both CHD events and CHD mortality was
higher than most other meta-analyses due to the exclusion
of the inadequately controlled trials, but similar to the
main analysis by Ramsden et al. [5]. Therefore, the

 suggestion of benefits reported in most earlier meta-
analyses is due to the inclusion of inadequately controlled
trials.
Mozaffarian et al. [19] was the only meta-analysis to
find a significant reduction in risk for CHD mortality,
which is mostly due to their inclusion of FMHS and
their exclusion of SDHS. Skeaff and Miller [14] was the
only other meta-analysis that included FMHS for CHD
mortality and excluded SDHS. However, Skeaff and
Miller [14] did not find a significant reduction in risk for
CHD mortality. This is most likely because their values
for CHD mortality came from the small subgroup of
participants for assessing CHD events. Therefore, those
values were much lower than the values for all CHD
mortality in the trial and this substantially lowered the
weighting of FMHS in their meta-analysis.
Total mortality: this meta-analysis found no effect for
total mortality regardless of whether FMHS or all the
inadequately controlled trials were excluded. This is
consistent with almost all the earlier meta-analyses
[3–5, 17–20]. Skeaff and Miller [14] is the only meta-
analysis that found a significant or near-significant re-
duction in risk for total mortality. Despite including
the same trials and using similar figures as Mozaffar-
ian et al. [19] for total mortality, Skeaff and Miller
[14] obtained a near-significant result for total mor-
tality, whereas Mozaffarian et al. [19] found no effect.
This is most likely because Skeaff and Miller [14] calcu-
lated the RR for FMHS using the number of participants
in each group, whereas Mozaffarian et al. [19] calculated
the RR for total mortality in FMHS using age-adjusted
person years for women, and obtained an RR similar to
non-age-adjusted person years for men. This had a large
impact on the results, as FMHS contributed 36.27% of the
weighting in the meta-analysis by Skeaff & Miller [14],
and in FMHS, calculating the RR for total mortality using
the number of participants in each group rather than
using age-adjusted person years underestimates the RR by

Replacing SFA with PUFA reduces the total-C:HDL-C
ratio [10], which appears to be the most predictive blood
cholesterol risk factor for CHD [9]. In addition, some
meta-analyses of observational studies [12, 15], but not
all [3, 13, 14], have found an inverse association between
PUFA intake and the incidence of CHD. Therefore, it
could be hypothesised that replacing SFA with PUFA
would reduce CHD. However, this hypothesis is refuted
by the currently available evidence from randomised
controlled trials, which are higher on evidence hierarch-
ies than observational studies (while risk factors and
mechanisms such as cholesterol are not included on
these evidence hierarchies) and are the gold standard in
evidence-based medicine [61]. While clinical trials are
not perfect, this discordant result is most likely due to
the limitations inherent in observational studies and in
the use of risk factors or proposed mechanisms.
Observational studies are not randomised, and there-
fore it can be quite likely for there to be other differ-
ences between groups of people besides the specific diet
or lifestyle aspect that is being measured. These other
differences may substantially affect the results and are
referred to as confounding variables [62, 63]. While
many observational studies attempt to control for a
number of confounding variables, this does not suffi-
ciently work all the time as was the case with hormone
replacement therapy for CVD [64], antioxidant vitamin
supplementation for CVD [65, 66] and dietary fibre sup-
plementation for colorectal cancer [67]. It is possible
that confounding variables also explain the discordant
result between observational studies and clinical trials
regarding the replacement of SFA with PUFA for CHD.
SFA intake is associated with behaviours indicating
lower health consciousness [68–70], whereas PUFA
intake is either associated with behaviours indicating
greater health consciousness [71] or does not appear to
be related to health consciousness [69]. In addition, a
meta-analysis found that smokers have a significantly
lower intake of PUFA [72].
Replacing SFA with PUFA reduces the total-C:HDL-C
ratio, and a higher total-C:HDL-C is associated with a
greater risk of CHD. Therefore, it could be claimed that
replacing SFA with PUFA will reduce the risk of CHD.
However, this assumes that replacing SFA with PUFA
only affects the total-C:HDL-C ratio and/or that the
total-C:HDL-C ratio is the only factor in the develop-
ment of CHD. Despite reducing the total-C:HDL-C
ratio, replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA does not ap-
pear to affect the incidence of CHD or CHD mortality
in randomised controlled trials. This suggests that the
larger risk associated with a higher total-C:HDL-C ratio
is mediated through other environmental and/or genetic
factors; and that the likely beneficial effect that replacing
SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA has on the total-C:HDL-C
ratio may be counterbalanced by other mechanisms,
such as higher n-6 PUFA intake increasing LDL oxida-
tion [73–75]. In addition to the three examples men-
tioned above, there are further examples where targeting
risk factors or proposed mechanisms have yielded unex-
pected results. These include the use cholesterol ester
transfer protein inhibitors to reduce the total-C:HDL-C
ratio for CHD [76]; vitamin B6, B9 and B12 supplemen-
tation to lower homocysteine for CHD [77, 78]; and that
carnitine reduces CHD events and total mortality [79]
even though it increases trimethylamine N-oxide, which
is associated with a higher risk of CHD [80].
Similarly, the methods used to alter nutrient intakes
can also influence the results of a trial. The diet heart
trials used a number of methods to reduce SFA intake,
Hamley Nutrition Journal  (2017) 16:30 
Page 13 of 16
 including advice to limit consumption of fatty meats
and full fat dairy, and advice to reduce ‘commercial
baked goods’ or ‘cakes and biscuits’ (Additional file
1); and some of these methods would be expected
produce more or less favourable results than others.
This is well illustrated by some contradictory clinical
trials investigating the effect that increasing SFA in-
take has on endothelial function, where the difference
between these trials is most likely due to what foods
were used to represent SFA, other fatty acids and
carbohydrate [81]. The first trial found that SFA im-
pairs endothelial function, but compared butter (SFA)
to almonds and high MUFA margarine (MUFA), wal-
nuts and high PUFA margarine (PUFA), and sultanas
and jam/marmalade (high glycemic load) [82]. This
made the first trial confounded by the extra protein,
fibre, micronutrients and phytonutrients that are nat-
urally present in whole foods such as almonds, wal-
nuts and sultanas [81]. Whereas the second and third
trials had far more balanced interventions regarding
food quality and found that SFA does not impair
endothelial function [81, 83]. In the case of the first
trial, the cumulative effect from differences in all the
other nutrients and chemicals found in whole foods
most likely influenced the results, and are likely to be
more influential than the fatty acids and carbohydrates
that are being intentionally manipulated. As such, there
are likely to be issues in generalising the effect of a nutri-
ent to foods rich in that nutrient and vice versa. This has
important implications for current conventional dietary
advice, which tends to be nutrient-based rather than food-
based.
There are a few other limitations of this study. The ad-
equately controlled trials are those that most accurately
test the effects of replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA.
However, this subgroup only includes five trials, or four
trials when SDHS is excluded in the sensitivity analysis,
and so this meta-analysis is limited by a small number of
appropriate randomised controlled trials. In addition,
the participants in the experimental groups of the diet
heart trials often reported a very high intake of PUFA.
The average intake of PUFA across all trials was at least
14.3% of total energy intake, and this extreme dietary
shift helped the participants achieve solid reductions in
plasma cholesterol. Almost all the experimental groups
had average PUFA intakes above 10% of total energy in-
take, except for DART (9.5%) and STARS (7.3%), and
this exceeds current recommendations from a number
of health bodies such as the American Heart Association
(5–10%) [84], the Institute of Medicine (5–10%) [85]
and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (3-10%)
[86]. However, even these recommendations, and current
intakes (~7.21%), are high compared to the average n-6
PUFA intake in the United States at the beginning of the
20th century (2.79%), before the widespread use of mod-
ern vegetable oils [87]. In light of this modern shift in n-6
PUFA intake, it is important to test these recommenda-
tions against historical intakes using high quality rando-
mised controlled trials. Lastly, the method to raise mostly
n-6 PUFA intake in the diet heart trials relied heavily on
vegetable oils: either in ‘filled foods’ [26, 29, 43, 53], using
them in place of other added fats [22, 23, 25, 31, 41, 43],
and/or prescribing daily doses as a form of nutritional
supplementation [21–23]. Therefore, these results should
not be generalised to other foods high in mostly n-6 PUFA
such as nuts and seeds.
Conclusion
In conclusion, available evidence from adequately con-
trolled randomised controlled trials suggest replacing SFA
with mostly n-6 PUFA is unlikely to reduce CHD events,
CHD mortality or total mortality. The suggestion of bene-
fits reported in earlier meta-analyses is due to the inclusion
of inadequately controlled trials. This has implications for
current dietary advice where recommendations to reduce
SFA and/or replace SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA feature
prominently, as maintaining these recommendations is un-
likely to have the intended effect and may reduce efforts to
get people to adopt other lifestyle changes that are more
likely to be beneficial.
