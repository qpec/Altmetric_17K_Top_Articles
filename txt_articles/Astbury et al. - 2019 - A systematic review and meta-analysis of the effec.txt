Summary
Meal replacements (MR) are generally not recommended in clinical guidelines for the
management of obesity. The aim of this review is to provide an up‐to‐date systematic
evaluation of the effect of weight loss interventions incorporating MR compared with
alternative interventions on weight change at 1 year in adults with overweight or obe-
sity. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to the end of August 2018
for randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of MR with interventions that did
not include MR on weight at 1 year. We excluded studies using diets providing
<3347 kJ/(800 kcal)/day and those which used total diet replacement (TDR) from this
review. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Twenty‐three
studies with 7884 adult participants were included. Six out of 23 studies were judged
at low risk of bias across all domains, and 5/23 studies were judged at high risk of bias
in at least one domain. Studies with similar intervention and comparators were grouped
into five comparisons for analysis. Mean weight change at 1 year favoured the MR
group relative to the control group in each comparison. In those comparisons where
we conducted meta‐analysis, in people assigned to a diet incorporating MR, mean dif-
ference was −1.44 kg (−2.48 to −0.39 kg; I2 = 38%) compared with alternative kinds
of diets. In those assigned to a MR diet along with support, mean difference was
−2.22 kg (−3.99 to −0.45, I2 = 81%) compared with other diets with support and
−3.87 kg (−7.34 to −0.40; I2 = 60%) compared with other kinds of diet without support.
In those assigned a MR diet with an enhanced level of support, mean difference was
−6.13 kg (−7.35 to −4.91, I2 = 19%) compared with alternative diets and regular sup-
port. Programmes incorporating meal replacements led to greater weight loss at 1 year
than comparator weight loss programmes and should be considered as a valid option
for management of overweight and obesity in community and health care settings.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a condition of excess accumulation of body fat that
causes premature mortality. It also causes substantial morbidity,
including significantly increased risks of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascu-
lar disease, and several nonsmoking‐related cancers, as well as
physical impairments linked to excess weight such as breathlessness,
joint problems, and back pain.1,2 Nevertheless, the health risks of
obesity are offset by weight loss,3-6 with greater weight losses
associated with greater health benefits.7 The prevalence of excess
weight is high and rising throughout the world;8 thus, unless effec-
tive obesity treatment and prevention strategies are implemented,
the increasing incidence of preventable diseases will place a growing
burden on health systems and the global economy.9 There is a
pressing need to identify effective interventions to treat obesity that
can be delivered at scale.
Weight
loss
programmes
that
incorporate
self‐management
strategies, such as the use of meal replacements (MR), may be a
particularly useful approach, as they can be delivered within the
community, potentially without support by health care professionals.
For the purposes of this review, we defined MR as discrete foods,
food products, or drinks that are used to replace foods usually
consumed at one or more meals with the intent to reduce daily energy
intake for the purposes of achieving weight loss or weight mainte-
nance following weight loss. MR programmes replace at least one
meal per day and include at least one meal comprising conventional
foods.
This
definition
not
only
includes
products
purposefully
marketed as MR for weight loss such as soups, shakes, and bars but
also includes portion‐controlled ready meals as well as discreet
portions of readily available conventional foods such as breakfast
cereal or rice. This review does not include very‐low‐energy diets
(VLED) providing less than 3347 kJ (800 kcal)/day, or those that use
low‐energy total diet replacement (TDR), which use formula food
products to replace all meals and snacks, but the impact of these types
of programs on weight has been reviewed by others recently.10,11
A previous systematic review and meta‐analysis of interventions
that incorporated MR for weight loss, using a similar definition as here,
identified only six studies of MR programmes versus comparator. It is
reported that the use of MR significantly increased short‐term weight
loss (3 months) compared with control. However, at 1 year, there was
no statistically significant difference in weight change between the
groups, though the point estimate favoured the intervention.12 Uncer-
tainty over the long‐term effectiveness of MR may explain why many
national guidelines do not reference MR,13-16 or advise against their
use17 for the routine management of overweight and obesity.
However, in recent years, several further studies of the effects of
MR with longer term follow‐up have been conducted. We therefore
set out to conduct an up‐to‐date systematic review of randomized
controlled trials to examine the effectiveness of MR in people with
overweight and obesity, compared with interventions that do not
include MR, on weight loss at 1 year. The effects on cardiometabolic
risk and any adverse effects were also investigated. We included
interventions intended for the treatment of overweight or obesity
and considered suitable for use in the community, without medical
supervision.

METHODS
A protocol for this review was published in advance and implemented
without changes.18
2.1
|
Search strategy
MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the
Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from
database inception to August 2018. We also screened references from
systematic reviews identified through our search and requested papers
from authors for those we were unable to obtain or for which we had
abstracts only. The searches were not restricted by country or language.
The search strategy (MEDLINE) is included in Supplementary Table S1.
Studies were included if they recruited adults (≥18 years) with a
body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2. Studies in pregnant women,
people with eating disorders, those who had undergone bariatric
surgery, or in those that included concomitant use of pharmacother-
apies for the purposes of weight loss were excluded. We included
randomized controlled trials of interventions incorporating the use of
one or more MR daily, as part of a hypoenergetic diet intended for
weight loss. We excluded interventions in which daily energy intake
was restricted to <3347 kJ (800 kcal)/day, as these diets (VLEDs)
require medical supervision and have been systematically reviewed
previously.10 Studies that used formula TDR were also excluded. To
be included, studies must have had as a comparator either a weight
loss intervention that did not include MR or offered no or minimal
intervention. Studies which compared different types of MR but did
not include a control arm were excluded. Studies were required to
report participants' weight at least 1 year after enrolment.
Covidence (Cochrane) was used for abstract and full‐text screen-
ing and data extraction.19 Data were extracted on weight and adverse
events at all reported time points as well as on fasting glucose; insulin;
HbA1c; total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol; triglycerides; and systolic and
diastolic blood pressure at 1 year. Studies were excluded if they did
not present sufficient information to allow data extraction or quality
assessment and if this information was not available in a trial protocol
or provided to us on request by the authors. Initially, titles and
abstracts were assessed for inclusion by two independent reviewers
with disagreements resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer. Full
papers of the included studies were obtained and independently
assessed for inclusion by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved
by discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer.

Data extraction
Two reviewers independently used a prespecified and piloted data
extraction form to characterize the population, intervention, control
groups, and outcomes and to assess risk of bias. Disagreements were
resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer. Authors were contacted
for missing data and clarifications as required. Risk of bias was
assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool,20 consistent with the
methods used in previous reviews of weight loss interventions.21 If
the outcome assessors were not blinded, we judged studies at low risk
570
ASTBURY ET AL.
 of detection bias where the outcome was objective (eg, body weight
measured by study staff). Studies were judged at high risk of attrition
bias if fewer than 50% of participants were measured at follow‐up or
if there was a difference of ≥20% drop‐out rate between groups, for
the primary outcome of weight at 1 year from baseline.
We categorized interventions including MR, and their compara-
tors, to ensure that we compared effectiveness within meaningful
groups. There were three types of active intervention. The first was
stand‐alone dietary advice which recommended the use of MR to
replace one or more eating occasions with the remainder of the diet
provided by conventional food (MR diet). The second included
interventions which recommended the use of MR and also provided
participants with additional support to lose weight (MR diet + support).
If the “support” offered was at a higher intensity than the support
offered to the comparator group, we called this enhanced support,
and this made up the third intervention group (MR diet + enhanced
support). There were three types of comparators. The first comprised
advice on dietary changes to aid weight loss that did not include the
use of MR (diet only). The second was broader support for weight loss,
which include advice on diet and other behavioural strategies, though
the details may not be specified (diet + support). The third type of
comparator intervention offered a nominal intervention for weight
loss, either in the form of a printed leaflet or one‐off educational
lecture (minimal intervention).

Analysis
Meta‐analyses were conducted in Review Manager 5.2 (Cochrane)22
to examine the difference between intervention and comparator
groups for weight change at 1 year (primary outcome). Additionally,
where available, we extracted interim weight change (~3 months,
typically at the end of the main intervention) and weight change at 2
and 4 years after baseline. Further analyses were conducted to
examine the changes in biomarkers of diabetes and cardiovascular risk
at 1 year. Studies varied in whether and how they imputed data for
participants lost to follow‐up, and as the practices adopted for this
can impact on the reported effect size, we recalculated weight change
using the method of baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) to
reduce spurious heterogeneity.23
In studies that did not report baseline weight for the randomized
participants, we assumed that there was no difference in baseline
weight between those randomized and those who completed the study
unless it was stated otherwise. In one study, it was unclear how many
participants were lost to follow‐up in each group, and we assumed equal
drop‐out for the purposes of the BOCF calculation.24 A sensitivity
analysis was conducted removing this study from the comparison.
Because the definitive numbers of participants achieving ≥5% or
≥10% weight loss were inconsistently reported in the included papers,
we estimated these numbers based on the mean and standard
deviation of the reported weight loss, assuming a normal distribution
as a post hoc analysis.
All meta‐analyses used a random effects model to account for
differences in the intervention programmes and populations. Pooled
results were calculated as mean differences in kilograms (kg) with
95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous variables; weighted
means were used to report individual group means. For the proportion
of participants achieving ≥5% or ≥10% weight loss, pooled results are
reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. The I2 statistic
was used to quantify statistical heterogeneity.25 We used Cochrane
guidance for interpretation of I2: 0% to 40% might not be important,
30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90%
may represent substantial heterogeneity, and 75% to 100% consider-
able heterogeneity.20 Where a study contributed more than one
intervention arm to a meta‐analysis, the control group was divided
equally between interventions to avoid double counting in the pooled
result.
In the preregistered protocol, we planned to use meta‐regression
to investigate whether characteristics of the MR interventions
impacted the observed effect. However, there were few studies in
each meta‐analysis, and the data reporting the details of the
programmes were limited such that we judged that the outcomes
would not be robust, and this was omitted from our analysis.

RESULTS
The literature search identified a total of 2924 papers. One hundred
eighteen full papers were retrieved, and 24 papers reporting the
results
of
23
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
with
8253
participants were eligible for inclusion. The main reason studies were
excluded is that they did not report body weight at 1‐year follow‐up
or longer, and this information could not be obtained from authors.
For some studies, additional data were obtained from the authors.26-
28 The PRISMA flow chart is displayed in Figure 1.

Characteristics of included studies
There were 4411 people allocated to an intervention including MR
and 3852 people to a comparator in the included studies. One study
was conducted in Australia, 1 in China, 3 in Germany, 1 in Malaysia,
1 in Singapore, 1 inThailand, and 15 in the United States. Most studies
were small; the median number of participants per study was 110 [IQR
92.5 to 165.5]. Over three quarters of participants were women,
median 79.0% [IQR 54.2 to 94.2]; the mean participant age was
47.7 years [IQR 41.9 to 52.6], and mean baseline BMI was 34.5 kg/
m2 [IQR 31.3 to 36.1] (Table 1). There was no significant difference
in baseline body weight between intervention and control groups
(mean ± SD; 93.7 ± 12.5 and 98.4 ± 12.3 kg in MR and control groups,
respectively).
Fourteen studies were conducted in people who were overweight
but with no specific clinical condition,24,27-39 five in people with type 2
diabetes,40-44
two
in
participants
with
metabolic syndrome or
impaired glucose regulation,45,46 one in men with type 2 diabetes
and erectile dysfunction,47 and one in adults with developmental
disabilities and obesity.48
From the 23 studies reporting weight change data at 1 year
(Figure 2), 17 of these studies reported weight change at a point
earlier than 1 year (Figure 3), which was collected at a median
18 weeks (range 8 to 34 weeks). Six studies also reported weight

 outcomes at 2 years (range 64 to 108 weeks) (Figure 4), and two
studies reported weight outcomes at 4 years (range 204‐208 weeks)
(Figure 5). Twelve studies reported information on biomarkers of car-
diovascular and diabetes risk at 1 year (Table 3 and Figures S1‐S9).

Interventions and comparators
In 15 studies (65%), the MR used consisted of specially formulated
shakes, soups, or bars.24,27,29,30,32-34,37-39,41,43-45,47 In four studies
(17%), the MR consisted of prepackaged portion‐controlled meals
which participants reconstituted or cooked at home,28,35,36,42 and in
four studies (17%), the MR was a combination of prepackaged
portion‐controlled meals and specially formulated shakes, soups, or
bars.31,38,40,48
The median duration of the active weight loss intervention in all
23 included studies was 20 weeks [IQR 12 to 52 weeks]. Twelve
studies also included a second MR phase for continued weight loss
or weight maintenance where continued use of MR was recom-
mended, generally at a reduced level. The median duration of this
phase was 42 weeks [IQR 30 to 52 weeks].28,30-34,38,42,44,46-48
During the weight loss phase, 13 studies advised participants to
replace two eating occasions each day with a MR.24,27-30,32-34,41,43-
45,47 One study advised participants to replace one eating occasion,39
and one, two, and four studies advised participants to replace three,37
four,26,48 or five31,38,40,42 eating occasions (meals or snacks) with one
MR, respectively. Two studies (four intervention arms) did not specify
the number of MR products participants were advised to consume,
but rather recommended that participants replace a proportion of
their daily energy intake with the MR products.35,36
In six of the included studies, the active intervention consisted of
advice to use and/or provision of MR products along with dietary
guidance on the quality and quantity of food to be consumed in the
remainder of the diet (MR diet).4,12,19,33,47,49 In 15 studies, in addition
to the MR diet, participants also received support for weight loss
during the active intervention. This support consisted of 12 sessions
[IQR 7 to 19] over 24 weeks, ranging from 12 to 52 weeks [IQR 12
to 52 weeks] (MR diet + support).27-31,34,36,38,39,41,43-46,48 In two stud-
ies (four intervention arms), an enhanced level of support was offered
to the MR group (73 sessions [IQR 57.5 to 88.5 sessions] over
78 weeks [IQR 65 to 91 weeks]) compared with the support provided
to the control group which consisted of two sessions [IQR 2 to 2] over
78 weeks [IQR 65 to 91 weeks]) (MR diet + enhanced support).35,42
In eight studies, the control intervention was dietary advice or a
diet plan providing guidance on what to eat to achieve weight loss
(diet only).24,32,33,36-38,40,47 In a further 12 studies, the control diet
was combined with support for weight loss, consisting of 11.5
sessions [IQR 4.75 to 18.25] over 52 weeks ranging from 12 to
52 weeks [IQR 45 to 52 weeks] (diet + support).26-31,34,35,42,43,45,48
In three studies, the control intervention consisted of an information
leaflet, educational lecture, or usual care (minimal control).39,41,44
Accordingly, the included studies fell into one of five distinct compar-
isons for analysis:
• MR diet versus diet only24,32,33,37,40,47
• MR diet + support versus diet + support27-31,34,43,45,46,48
• MR diet + support versus diet only36,38
• MR diet + enhanced support versus diet + support35,42
• MR diet + support versus minimal intervention39,41,44

Risk of bias
Summary risk of bias for the included studies is provided inTable 2, and
justifications for any unclear of high judgments are provided in the sup-
plementary material (Table S3). Six of the included studies were judged
to be at low risk of bias across all domains.33,38,41,44,45,48 Five studies
were judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain,24,26,31,34,40
with all other studies judged to be at unclear risk of bias in at least one
domain.27-30,32,34-37,39,40,42,47 Twelve studies were judged to be at low
risk of sequence generation bias,28,32-34,38,40-45,48 with the remaining
studies at unclear risk,24,26,27,29-31,35-37,39,47 mainly due to insufficiently
detailed reporting. Six studies were judged to be at low risk of alloca-
tion concealment bias,33,38,41,44,45,48 with the other 17 studies judged
to be at unclear risk of this bias because they did not report whether
allocation was concealed or not. Five studies were judged to be at high
risk of attrition bias,24,31,34,40,46 mainly because of unequal follow‐up
rates between groups, with all other studies judged to be at low risk
of attrition bias (Table 3).27-30,32,33,35-39,41-45,47,48

Weight change
Twenty‐three studies were included in the primary analysis (weight
change at 1 year) across the five comparisons, defined based on
FIGURE 2

control interventions by comparison group [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
ASTBURY ET AL.
579
 intervention and comparator type (Figure 2). Where reported, the
difference in weight change reported earlier than 1 year consistently
favoured the MR treatment (Figure 3). Results for 1 year or longer
follow‐up are reported narratively below. Odds ratios of achieving
weight change ≥5% and ≥10% baseline weight at 1 year were
calculated for each comparison (Table 4).
3.4.1

MR diet vs diet only
Six studies compared a MR diet with diet only.24,32,33,37,40,47 Mean
weight change among participants randomized to an intervention
incorporating the use of MR (n 229) was −3.0 kg at 1 year compared
with participants in the diet only intervention (n 225) who had weight
change of −1.5 kg (mean difference = −1.44 kg; 95% CI −2.48, −0.39,
I2 = 38%)24,32,33,37,40,47 (Figure 2).
Two of the studies in this comparison also reported weight change at
2 years32,40 where mean weight change in participants randomized to the
MR diet intervention (n 81) was −3.4 kg while those randomized to the
diet only intervention (n 67) lost −3.0 kg (mean difference = −0.39 kg;
95% CI −2.07, 1.29, I2 = 0%) (Figure 4). One of these studies32 reported
that 4 years after randomization, mean weight change in those allocated
to the MR diet intervention (n 50) was −7.2 kg, while in the comparator
group (n 50), it was −3.0 kg (mean difference = −4.2 kg; 95% CI −6.59,
−1.81), reflecting continued weight loss in the MR group but little change
in weight since 1 year in the comparator group (Figure 5).
3.4.2

MR diet + support vs diet + support
Ten studies (12 intervention arms and 10 control arms) were included in
the MR diet + support versus diet + support comparison.27-31,34,43,45,46,48
One study was omitted from the meta‐analysis as weight data were not

 normally distributed, were reported in the paper as median and inter-
quartile ranges, and we could not obtain further data.45 In the nine stud-
ies
included
in
the
meta‐analysis,
mean
weight
change
among
participants randomized to a MR diet plus support programme (n 622)
was −2.4 kg at 1 year, compared with −1.34 kg in a comparator group
(n 576) with a diet but no MR and a similar support programme (mean
difference = −2.22 kg; 95% CI −3.99 to −0.45, I2 = 81%) (Figure 2). Sta-
tistical heterogeneity was high, but attributable to one small outlier,27
which showed greater weight loss favouring the intervention. In the
study omitted from the meta‐analysis, weight change was consistent
with the other included studies, in that the median weight change was
greater in the MR group (median −1.8 kg, IQR −4.13, 0.43) compared

 with the control group (median −0.8 kg, IQR −4.0, 1.05).45 Two of the
included studies also reported weight at 2 years,27,30 with weight
change favouring MR over control interventions (mean difference
−2.2 kg, 95% CI −4.02 to −0.38, I2 = 67%) (Figure 4).
3.4.3
|
MR diet + support vs diet only
Two studies compared interventions involving a MR diet and support
programme (n 95) with a diet‐only comparator (n 95).36,38 Mean
weight change at 1 year was −5.3 kg for the MR diet + support and
−1.5 kg in the diet only group (mean difference = −3.87 kg; 95% CI
−7.34 to −0.40, I2 = 60%) (Figure 2). Neither of these studies reported
weight beyond 1 year.
3.4.4
|
MR diet + enhanced support vs diet + support
Two studies tested a MR diet together with an enhanced support
programme.35,42 At 1 year, mean weight change among participants ran-
domized to MR diet plus enhanced support (n 482) was −8.5 kg while
among those receiving the diet + support (n 187), it was −2.4 kg (mean
difference = −6.13 kg; 95% CI −7.35, to −4.91, I2 = 19%) (Figure 2). One
study (two intervention arms) followed up participants at 2 years,35 with
weight change (−5.5 kg MR with in person support, −6.3 kg MR with
telephone support, and −4.5 kg in control group) continuing to favour
the MR diet (n 331) over the comparator (n 111) (mean differ-
ence = −1.37 kg; 95% CI −2.64 to −0.10) (Figure 4).
3.4.5
|
MR diet + support vs minimal intervention
Three studies (four intervention arms) compared a MR diet plus
support with a minimal intervention control.39,41,44 Statistical hetero-
geneity was considerable (I2 = 98%); therefore, we do not present
pooled results here. In all three studies, participants in the intervention
arm lost significantly more weight than those in the control arm at
1 year. In a study in China (n = 88), the mean difference was
−1.10 kg (95% CI −2.09 to −0.11), favouring the MR group. In a study
in Germany (n = 409), mean difference in weight change from baseline
was −7.01 kg (95% CI −9.87, to −4.15) in the moderate use of MR
group and −6.82 kg (95%CI −9.81 to −3.83) in the stringent use of
MR groups compared with control group, respectively.44 In the Look
Ahead study in the USA (n = 5145), mean difference in weight change
between participants in the MR diet + support group compared with
the control (usual care) group was −7.70 kg (95% CI −8.07 to −7.33)
(Figure 2). In the latter study, the mean difference in weight change

(mean difference = −5.20 kg, 95% CI −5.25 to −5.15) and 4 years
(mean difference −3.4 kg, 95% CI −3.45 to −3.35) (Figures 4 and 5).
The other two studies did not report weight change beyond a year.

Participants achieving >5% and >10% weight
loss at 1 year
For each comparison, we calculated the odds ratio that participants
would achieve a weight loss ≥5% and ≥10% from baseline at 1 year
in the MR group compared with the control (Table 4).
For weight change of ≥5% baseline weight, all comparisons
showed that the odds of achieving this were statistically significantly
greater in the MR group compared with control. For weight change
≥10%, four out of the five showed that participants allocated to MR
intervention had statistically greater odds of achieving the cut‐point
compared with those assigned to the control.

42,44,46,47 Across all studies that reported outcomes, results consis-

Adverse events
Only two studies reported information on adverse events (AE).26,41
Neither of these studies gave details on the total number of AEs
reported by intervention arm, but the Look Ahead Research Group
2007 reported that there were no between‐group differences in the
frequency of hypoglycaemia, fractures, amputations, congestive heart
failure, or occurrence of gallstones among 5145 participants.50
Flechtner‐Mors et al reported that there were no adverse events that
could be attributed to the intervention.26 We also considered nutri-
tional deficiencies to be an AE. Five studies assessed diet quality dur-
ing the interventions, and these studies reported that diet quality was
improved in those randomized to MR.29,30,32,46,48

DISCUSSION
The use of discrete foods, food products, or drinks a replacement for
usual foods on some occasions during the day leads to significantly
greater weight loss at 1 year than comparator interventions based
wholly on conventional foods, with commensurate improvements in
HbA1c and mixed findings for markers of diabetes and cardiovascular
disease risk. All of the included studies individually reported that inter-
ventions including MR products were either equally as effective or
superior to the comparator interventions for interim weight change
as well as weight change at 1 year. Only two studies reported out-
comes at 4 years, but both reported that weight change from baseline
to 4 years favoured the MR groups over control. Only two studies
assessed adverse events; there was no evidence from these studies

 of any excess adverse events associated with the use of MR
products.26,41
A strength of this review is the rigorous methodology, including
use of a consistent approach to address missing data (BOCF).23 Given
the scope of this review, the included studies are inherently clinically
diverse. We tried to overcome this by grouping studies according to
a predefined protocol to offer a meaningful insight into some of the
variation in weight losses seen in studies using different treatment
or comparator protocols. However, there is still moderate to substan-
tial statistical heterogeneity in some of the groups. It is plausible that
the effect of MR on weight could be affected by the factors that vary
between studies, most obviously variations between interventions
(nature, frequency, duration, or composition of the MR used) or differ-
ences in participant characteristics. However, there were insufficient
studies in each comparison to fully explore study characteristics which
may explain the observed heterogeneity between studies through
meta‐regression or subgroup analyses.
For each domain of bias, the majority of studies were judged at
low or unclear risk of bias. Five studies were judged at high risk of
attrition bias.24,31,34,40,46 These studies were judged at high risk of bias
because fewer than 50% of participants were measured at follow‐up
or if there was a difference of ≥20% drop‐out rate between groups,
and in these cases, it is possible that there is a plausible intervention
effect among participants with missing data.
We endeavoured to identify unpublished studies by searching
study registries and grey literature and contacting experts in the field,
but we cannot rule out publication bias. We are not aware of unpub-
lished studies with negative results, but given the nature of this
research and the fact that many studies were funded or supported
by industry, it is possible that smaller studies with nonsignificant
results may be less likely to be published. Reporting of the content
of the interventions was poor, and there were insufficient studies
within each comparison to enable us to conduct a meta‐regression
to identify the effective components of the interventions. There was
no
information
reported
on
the
cost‐effectiveness
of
these
programmes or the costs to individuals compared with diets based
on conventional food.
This review expands on the indicative findings of a previous
review.12 By including more studies, and reducing the confidence
interval around the point estimate, the present findings demonstrate
that the weight loss at 1 year in interventions that include MR prod-
ucts is statistically significantly greater than in interventions that do
not use these products. Other recent reviews have included weight
loss interventions incorporating meal replacements.49,51 but these
reviews have considered the use of meal replacements alongside other
weight loss interventions, and have therefore been unable to deter-
mine the specific effect of meal replacements per se. TDR have also
been reviewed in various populations.10,11,52 Although TDR products
are like MR in that they are designed to replace usual food‐based
meals, TDR products are formulated to be used as the sole source of
nutrition, that is, to replace all food in the diet. MR aims to replace
one or more usual meals, but the instructions for use suggest eating
a food‐based meal at least once a day to ensure adequate intake of
nutrients and vitamins. MR can be purchased over the counter and
used without guidance from a health professional, whereas weight
loss programmes incorporating TDR are advised to be undertaken
under supervision. Given these differences between MR and TDR
programmes,
it
is
important
to
consider
their
effectiveness
independently.
The key finding of this review is that participants assigned to a
MR diet compared with a diet only approach (akin to a self‐directed
weight loss attempt) lose an additional 1.44 kg at 1 year, and this dif-
ference appears to be maintained up to 4 years. Likewise, many peo-
ple join behavioural weight loss programmes to provide support to
lose weight. The results of the present study suggest that all other
things being equal, incorporating meal replacement products into such
behavioural weight loss programmes enhances their effect (reflected
in the MR diet + support versus diet + support comparison), with a
2.22 kg greater weight loss at 1 year in the MR group. Although these
differences may appear to be modest, currently around 70% of the UK
population with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 are trying to lose weight,53 and a
sustained weight loss of even 1 kg will bring substantial benefits to
public health.54,55 Moreover, since the comparative interventions also
lead to weight loss, by and large incorporating MR into weight loss
programmes increases the proportion of participants who achieve
≥5% and ≥10% weight loss at 1 year.
Meal replacement products are consumer food products (as
opposed to medical devices or drugs), widely available to be purchased
over the counter without prescription, but at present are infrequently
used by those attempting weight loss in their weight loss attempts.56
Advice and guidance provided by clinicians to encourage their use
could deliver benefits at minimal cost to health care providers. Few
studies included in the review reported adverse events, including the
impact on the nutritional quality of the data. Two studies found no
evidence of adverse events arising from the use of these prod-
ucts,26,41 and five studies report that they may improve the overall
nutritional quality of the diet.5,6,18,19,35
The greater weight loss observed in programmes incorporating
MR suggests that this approach makes it easier to adhere to a reduced
energy diet. However, there has been little detailed study of eating
behaviours. It is possible that these fixed‐energy, portion‐controlled,
or prepacked foods contain less energy than most self‐selected meals
and snacks, or that the structure and external control associated with
their use facilitate adherence. Further work could usefully examine the
behavioural processes that facilitate weight loss which would be of
use when designing effective weight loss programmes to enhance
effectiveness and reach.
These findings provide important new evidence to inform clinical
guidelines. At present in many countries, clinical recommendations
for the treatment of obesity advise that individuals attempting weight
loss should be advised to aim for an energy deficit of 2092 to
4184 kJ/day (500‐1000 kcal), but they do not suggest that MR could
be used to help individuals achieve this deficit nor do they recommend
MR as an effective dietary strategy for weight loss.13,15 Guidelines in
some countries do refer to meal replacement programmes. In the
United States, the guidelines state that the strength of evidence on
the longer term effect on weight of MR is low.57 Singaporean guide-
lines note that meal replacements may induce greater acute reduc-
tions in weight but are not advised for the long‐term management
of
overweight
and
obesity.17
Australian

 recommend meal replacements for weight loss beyond their use as
part of a VLED.16
In conclusion, this review provides evidence that MR is an effec-
tive intervention for the treatment of overweight and obesity at a
year, especially when used together with a support programme. MR
could
be
recommended
for
inclusion
in
weight
management
programmes offered by professionals or as part of a self‐management
strategy for people with overweight or obesity.
