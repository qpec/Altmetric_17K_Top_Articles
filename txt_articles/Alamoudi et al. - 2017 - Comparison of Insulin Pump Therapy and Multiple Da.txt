Abstract
Introduction: Fasting Ramadan carries a high risk for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Data on the
optimum insulin regimen in these patients are limited.
Objectives: To compare glucose profiles in patients with T1DM who use continuous subcutaneous insulin
infusion (CSII) compared with those who use multiple daily injections (MDI) insulin regimen during Ramadan
fast. The primary outcome was rates of hypoglycemia. Other outcomes included glycemic control, number of
days needed to break fasting, and acute glycemic complications.
Methods: Patients with T1DM who were on CSII or MDI and decided to fast Ramadan were recruited. Glucose data
collected using self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were com-
pared in the two groups, CSII and MDI, and glucose control was assessed by measuring serum fructosamine levels.
Results: A total of 156 patients were recruited, 61 on CSII and 95 on MDI. There was no difference in the rate of
mild hypoglycemia <4.4mmol/L (<80mg/dL) (8.6%– 6.1% in the CSII group and 9.85%– 9.34% in the MDI
group, P = 0.96). The mean rate of severe hypoglycemia <2.7 mmol/L (<50mg/dL) was also not different in both
groups (0.99%– 1.7% in the CSII group compared to 1.7%– 4.7% in the MDI group, P = 0.23). There was no
difference in glycemic control as measured by fructosamine levels or the number of days that patients have to stop
fasting. Glucose variability was significantly better in CSII group (SMBG; standard deviation [SD] 66.9– 15.3 vs.
76.9– 29.9, P = 0.02) (CGM; SD 68.1– 19.6 vs. 78.7– 24.9, P = 0.04). No diabetic ketoacidosis was reported in
either group.
Conclusion: In patients with T1DM who fast Ramadan, there was no difference in rates of hypoglycemia or
hyperglycemia between CSII and MDI. However, CSII was associated with less glucose variability.

Introduction
M
uslim adults are required to fast during the month of
Ramadan if their health condition allows. Fasting the
month of Ramadan constitutes abstinence from food, drink,
and the use of oral medications from dawn till sunset. Be-
cause this month follows a lunar calendar, the number of
hours of fasting varies from year to year. The number of hours
of fasting also varies significantly depending on geographic
location. The main health risk associated with fasting Ram-
adan for patients with diabetes is glycemic deterioration,
including hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.1–3 Professional
guidelines are available to help physicians decide on the
category of patients who can fast safely and those in whom

 fasting can pose a risk and therefore should be advised not to
fast.2,3 Patients with type 1 diabetes are considered high risk
for fasting Ramadan and it is recommended that they do not
fast.3,4 However, a significant number of those patients insist
on fasting, thereby creating a medical challenge for themselves
and their healthcare providers.5 Because of the development of
glycemic deterioration, mainly hypoglycemia, in these pa-
tients, a significant number of them have to stop fasting.
Large gaps remain in understanding the best treatment
choices needed to help patients with diabetes fast Ramadan
safely. Published studies comparing different treatment mo-
dalities in patients with type 1 diabetes who fast Ramadan are
very sparse and do not extend beyond observational reports
and case series.6–16
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (or In-
sulin pump therapy) is an appealing strategy that offers
flexibility and precision to administering insulin. In selected
patients, insulin pump therapy has been shown to be associ-
ated with better glucose control and a possible reduction in
the incidence of hypoglycemia when compared with multiple
daily injections (MDI) insulin regimen.17,18
The primary aim of this study was to compare rates of
glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes who use in-
sulin pump and those who are on a multiple daily insulin
injection regimen during Ramadan fast.
Materials and Methods
The study was a prospective cohort study that involved three
National Guard Hospitals located in three cities (Dammam,
Alahsa, and Riyadh) in Saudi Arabia. The primary aim of the
study was to compare rates of glucose control in patients with
type 1 diabetes who use insulin pump and those who are on a
multiple daily insulin injection regimen during Ramadan fast.
Other studied outcomes included glucose variability, weight
changes, and number of days that patients had to stop fasting.
Patients were recruited from the diabetes clinics and were
eligible if their age was 14 years or older, had a diagnosis of
type 1 diabetes for at least 6 months, and were on either
insulin pump or multiple daily insulin injection regimen.
Patients had to be willing to perform self-monitoring of blood
glucose (SMBG) and have no other contraindication to fast
Ramadan. Patients on insulin pump were required to be on
this therapy for at least 3 months. All patients were using the
same pump (MiniMed Paradigm Real-Time 722 by Med-
tronic). MDI regimen included a basal insulin (Glargine or
Detemir) combined with a rapid-acting insulin (Aspart,
Glulisine, or Lispro). Patients were excluded if they were
pregnant, cannot or were unwilling to fast, cannot perform
SMBG, and had renal or hepatic impairment, adrenal insuf-
ficiency, psychiatric illness, or history of alcoholism.
The institutional review board of Ministry of National
Guard Health Affairs (MNGHA) approved the study. All
participants signed an informed consent. The study was
sponsored through a grant from King Abdullah International
Medical Research Center (KAIMRC). Roche pharmaceutical
company provided the glucometers (Accu-Check Performa�),
glucose strips, and lancets free of charge and was not involved
in the design and conduct of the study. The study was regis-
tered at ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT01941238.
Patients with type 1 diabetes attending diabetes clinics
were offered to participate. For each patient recruited on
insulin pump therapy, one patient on MDI regimen was re-
cruited. Within the 2 months before the month of Ramadan,
patients were screened and offered participation. Baseline
demographic data were collected using paper questionnaires
and clinical examination, while baseline laboratory tests in-
cluded glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fructosamine.
Patients were provided with the same glucometer (Accu-
Check Performa by Roche). Patients were asked to check
capillary glucose six to seven times per day, every 2–4 h
during the fast, prebreakfast meal (iftar), premidnight and 2 h
postmidnight, and predawn meal (Sahour). All patients re-
ceived formal education on aspects of diabetes in Ramadan
by certified diabetes educators. Patients were offered to come
during Ramadan for a 6-day continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) placement using iPro� device (Medtronic, MN), but
this was not compulsory. iPro is a blind CGM device, so pa-
tients were not able to monitor their own blood glucose. It was
assured at the time of insertion that patients were fasting. All
patients were required to return for follow-up visits within 2
weeks after the end of Ramadan. In this visit, data from
glucometers were downloaded and laboratories were drawn
for HbA1c and fructosamine. In addition, patients were re-
quired to fill up a paper questionnaire on events in Ramadan.
Due to the risk of fasting in patients with type 1 diabetes and
following professional guidelines of target fasting/premeal
glucose levels of 4.4–7.2 mmol/L (80–130 mg/dL),19 a capil-
lary glucose value of <4.4 mmol/L (80 mg/dL) was defined as
mild hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as a
capillary glucose level of <2.7 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or if the
patient required assistance during the episode. Signifi-
cant hyperglycemia was defined as a capillary glucose of
>13.9 mmol/L (250mg/dL). Patients were advised to stop their
fast if they had hypoglycemia or significant hyperglycemia.
Statistical analysis
Data were entered and analyzed using the Statistical
Package of Social Sciences. Continuous results were ex-
pressed as means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians
and interquartile ranges according to the data distribution,
and categorical data were presented as proportions with 95%
confidence intervals. Between-group comparison was done
using a Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U test where the
data are not normally distributed. For categorical data, chi-

 square test (with Yates’ correction or Fisher’s exact test
where appropriate) was used. Paired t-test was used to
compare pre-Ramadan versus post-Ramadan data. The level
of statistical significance was chosen as P £ 0.05 (two sided).
Results
A total of 409 patients were screened, of which 211 were
deemed eligible and offered participation. Of those, 175 pa-
tients agreed to participate. After excluding withdrawals, 156
patient were included, 61 on insulin pump and 95 on MDI. Out
of 156, SMBG data were available for 116 patients: 46 patients
on insulin pump, of which 37 had CGM placement, and 70
patients on MDI regimen, of which 41 had CGM placement.
The baseline characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1.
The mean age was 23.4 – 06.1 in the insulin pump group
and 21.3 – 06.3 in the MDI group. The majority of insulin
pump patients were females (70.5%) and of higher education
(51.7%). The mean duration of diabetes as well as body mass
index were not different in both groups, while the baseline
HbA1c was significantly lower in the insulin pump group
compared to the MDI group (HbA1c 8.0 – 1.1 vs. 8.8 – 01.7,
P = 0.045).
SMBG data
Mean blood glucose was not different between the insulin
pump and MDI groups (11 – 2.8 mmol/L vs. 10.5 – 2.5 mmol/
L, P = 0.332) (Table 2). Glucose variability as measured by SD
of SMBG was significantly less in the insulin pump group
compared to the MDI group (3.7– 0.85 vs. 4.2– 1.6, P = 0.02).
Mean rates of mild hypoglycemia (<4.4 mmol/L) were less in
the insulin pump group than in the MDI group, however, not
statistically different (8.6– 6.1 vs. 9.85– 9.34, P = 0.962). Si-
milarly, rates of severe hypoglycemia <2.7 mmol/L were not
statistically different in the insulin pump and MDI groups
(0.99– 1.7 vs. 1.7 – 4.7, respectively, P = 0.23). The low blood
glucose index and high blood glucose index were not differ-
ent between patients in the insulin pump and MDI groups.
Mean rate of significant hyperglycemia (glucose level of
>13.9mmol/L) was higher in the insulin pump group (54.1–
26.02 vs. 43.1– 25.2, P = 0.029) compared to the MDI
group. For a subgroup of patients (n = 49, 10 pump and 39
MDI), data were available on hypoglycemia <3.8 and
<2.2 mmol/L; the mean rates were (7.3– 5.9 vs. 10.6– 10.3,
P = 0.673) and (0.7– 1.1 vs. 2.5– 4.8, P = 0.976), respectively.
In addition, for patients with HbA1c <7.5 before Ramadan

 (n = 20, 8 pump and 12 MDI), comparison results confirm no
statistical difference in rates of mild or severe hypoglycemia
(11.4– 7.6 in pump vs. 12.9 – 10.6 in MDI, P = 0.72) and
(0.7– 1.4 in pump vs. 1.6 – 2.8 in MDI, P = 0.97), respectively.
CGM data
Mean blood glucose was not different between the insulin
pump and MDI groups (9.6 mmol/L – 2.2 vs. 9.9 mmol/
L – 2.6, P = 0.33) (Fig. 1 and Table 3). Glucose variability
was significantly less in the insulin pump group compared to
the MDI group (SD 3.7 – 1.0 vs. 4.3 – 1.3, respectively;
P = 0.04). Rates of hypoglycemia <3.8 mmol/L were not
different in the insulin pump and MDI groups (3.05 – 2.08 vs.
3.8 – 3.44, respectively, P = 0.24) (Fig. 2). Similarly, rates of
severe hypoglycemia <2.7 mmol/L were not different in both
groups (1.2 – 1.5 vs. 1.17 – 1.5, respectively; P = 0.89). Rates
of significant hyperglycemia were also not different in both
groups (10.5 – 5.2 vs. 9.85 – 5.2, respectively, P = 0.58).
Glucose control and safety of fast
Glucose control before Ramadan was significantly better
in the insulin pump group compared to the MDI group
(HbA1c 8.0 – 1.1 vs. 8.8 – 01.7, P = 0.045). This deteriorated
after Ramadan in both groups with continuation of better
control in the insulin pump group (HbA1c 8.4 – 1.3 in the
insulin pump group vs. 9.3 – 02.1 in the MDI group,
P = 0.02). Levels of serum fructosamine were not different
between both groups before Ramadan (385.6 – 76.1 lmol/L

 in the insulin pump group vs. 409.2 – 95.5 lmol/L in the
MDI group, P = 0.126). These levels increased after Rama-
dan in both groups, but continued to be not different between
the groups (392.8 – 60.1 in CSII vs. 405.9 – 84.4 in MDI,
P = 0.61).
More patients on insulin pump managed to fast the whole
month of Ramadan without the need to break their fast: 31.2%
versus 22.1% of patients in the MDI group could achieve this
(P = 0.41). There was no difference in the average number of
days that fasting had to be stopped between both groups
(4.1– 5.3 in the insulin pump group compared to 5.7– 5.8 in
MDI, P = 0.23). The main reasons for stopping fasting was
hypoglycemia (81.2% in the insulin pump group and 88.7% in
the MDI group), followed by significant hyperglycemia
(18.7% and 18.9% respectively).
There were two hospitalizationsin theMDI group,one dueto
severe hyperglycemia and the other due to severe hypoglyce-
mia. One visit to the emergency department was reported in the
insulin pump group due to hyperglycemia. No case of diabetic
ketoacidosis was reported during Ramadan in both groups.
Both groups lost weight after Ramadan. In the insulin
pump group, pre-Ramadan weight was (69.3 – 21.2) kg ver-
sus (67.0 – 17.1) kg post-Ramadan (P = 0.245), while in the
MDI group, pre-Ramadan weight was (66.2 – 15.1) kg versus
(64.6 – 14.3) kg post-Ramadan (P = 0.118).
Discussion
Despite recommendations from professional organizations
against fasting Ramadan, a significant number of patients
with type 1 diabetes insist on fasting.3,5 The main concern for
patients with type 1 diabetes during Ramadan fast is hypo-
glycemia and to a lesser extent hyperglycemia. The EPIDIAR
was a large epidemiological study that looked at features of
patients with diabetes who fast Ramadan. The study found
that 42.8% of patients with type 1 diabetes fast Ramadan and
the incidence of severe hypoglycemia was increased by 4.7
times, while the risk of hyperglycemia was increased by five
times in these patients.5 The ideal insulin regimen to help
patients with type 1 diabetes fast Ramadan safely remains not
known. Only few studies have documented the safety and
efficacy of different insulin regimens on Ramadan fasting in
patients with type 1 diabetes.9,13,16 Kadiri et al. reported on
patients with type1 diabetes during Ramadan fasting using
insulin lispro instead of regular human insulin combined with
intermediate acting insulin taken twice daily.6 The regimen
that included insulin lispro showed improvement in post-
prandial glucose levels and was associated with fewer hy-
poglycemic events. A small study that included 22 patients
with type 1 diabetes during Ramadan fast found that glucose
levels were better in patients on multiple daily insulin in-
jections regimen compared to conventional twice-daily in-
sulin regimen, but with higher rates of hypoglycemia.9
Insulin pump therapy was found to be associated with
better glucose control compared with MDI when used in
selected patients with type 1 diabetes.17,18 The evidence for
hypoglycemia is less clear. Most studies do not show a dif-
ference in rates of hypoglycemia between insulin pump
therapy and MDI. A Cochrane review found that severe hy-
poglycemia appeared to be reduced in patients on insulin
pump therapy compared to MDI, although no difference was
observed in the frequency of nonsevere hypoglycemia.18 A
few studies are available on the use of insulin pump therapy
in patients with type 1 diabetes during Ramadan Fast.13–16
The largest series reported included 49 patients and found that
61.2% of these patients could fast the whole month of
Ramadan with no consequences, while hypoglycemia oc-
curred in 34.7% of patients, necessitating breaking the fast.9
The only published data on the comparison between insulin
pump therapy and insulin injections during Ramadan fast used
twice-daily conventional insulin.13 This study found that rates
of hypoglycemia was much less in patients on insulin pump
therapy (16%) compared to 29% in the conventional insulin
regimen group, while glucose control was better in the insulin
pump therapy group (mean HbA1c 7.8%) compared to the
conventional insulin group (mean HbA1c 9.1%).
To our knowledge, our study provides the first data about
glucose profiles of patients with type 1 diabetes who use
insulin pump therapy compared to those who use MDI during
Ramadan fast. We found that hypoglycemia rates were not
statistically different in both groups. Rates of hyperglycemia
were higher in patients on insulin pump when using SMBG
data, but were not different when assessed using CGM. Short-
term glycemic control as assessed by fructosamine levels did
not differ in both groups. The main concern from fasting
Ramadan for patients with type 1 diabetes is hypoglycemia
and to a lesser extent hyperglycemia. Hypoglycemia is
common during Ramadan fast in patients with type 1 diabetes
and is the most common cause that necessitates breaking the
fast.2,3 We found that the rate of severe hypoglycemia was
low (mean 1.3%). Studies that included patients with type 1
diabetes who are on insulin pump during Ramadan reported
no episodes of severe hypoglycemia.11,13–16
Reported rates of nonsevere hypoglycemia in these patients
were very variable (14.2%,13 16%,16 and 34.7%14). We found
that the mean rate of mild hypoglycemia was 9.2%. A possible
explanation for this wide variation is the different criteria used
and different patient populations. Some studies used hypo-
glycemia along with the inability of patients to continue
fasting as a criterion, while others used the absolute number of
glucose level either capillary or interstitial through CGM. We
found that glycemic variability was less in patients on insulin
pump therapy compared to those on MDI, a finding that
concurs with studies of patients in the nonfasting state.19–21
The clinical significance of this finding in patients during
Ramadan fast is not known and deserves further studies.
Patients with type 1 diabetes are categorized as very high
risk and previous guidelines recommended against fasting
Ramadan.2 Our data showed that these patients can safely
fast Ramadan, a finding that concurs with other observa-
tions.11,14–16 However, a significant number of our patients had
to break their fast due to hypoglycemia. Therefore, a careful
selection ofthesepatientswithassurance ofadequateeducation
and supervision is important as acknowledged by the recent
guidelines from the international diabetes federation.3
Our study has several limitations. The self-selective nature
of our two groups of patients and the absence of randomi-
zation could make it difficult to generalize the results. The
baseline characteristics in both groups that were well-
matched should have reduced the related bias. CGM data
were not available for all patients since this was voluntary.
In conclusion, glucose control and rates of hypoglycemia
were not different in patients with type 1 diabetes during
Ramadan fast whether they used insulin pump therapy or

 MDI insulin regimen. Further larger randomized studies are
needed to confirm these findings and determine the role of
glucose variability in this population.
