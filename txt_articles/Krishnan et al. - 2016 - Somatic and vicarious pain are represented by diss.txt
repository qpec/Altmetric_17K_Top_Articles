Abstract Understanding how humans represent others’ pain is critical for understanding
pro-social behavior. ‘Shared experience’ theories propose common brain representations for
somatic and vicarious pain, but other evidence suggests that specialized circuits are
required to experience others’ suffering. Combining functional neuroimaging with
multivariate pattern analyses, we identified dissociable patterns that predicted somatic (high
versus low: 100%) and vicarious (high versus low: 100%) pain intensity in out-of-sample
individuals. Critically, each pattern was at chance in predicting the other experience,
demonstrating separate modifiability of both patterns. Somatotopy (upper versus lower
limb: 93% accuracy for both conditions) was also distinct, located in somatosensory versus
mentalizing-related circuits for somatic and vicarious pain, respectively. Two additional
studies demonstrated the generalizability of the somatic pain pattern (which was originally
developed on thermal pain) to mechanical and electrical pain, and also demonstrated the
replicability of the somatic/vicarious dissociation. These findings suggest possible
mechanisms underlying limitations in feeling others’ pain, and present new, more specific,
brain targets for studying pain empathy.

 Introduction
“Though our brother is upon the rack, as long as we ourselves are at our ease, our senses will
never inform us of what he suffers. . . . it is by the imagination only that we can form any concep-
tion of what are his sensations.”
Adam Smith (1759)
A fundamental feature of social interactions is our capacity for vicarious experience—the ability to
perceive another person’s affective state, reference it to ourselves, and generate an emotional
response. This ability provides the foundation for empathy and cooperative behavior (Smith, 1759)
by allowing us to recognize and respond to suffering in others (Batson et al., 1981), and learn from
their experiences (Olsson and Phelps, 2007). Vicarious experiences of others’ pain, in particular, aid
in representing others’ distress with sufficient vividness and importance that we are moved to
action.
But how do we represent others’ pain, and how vivid and automatic are such representations?
Theories differ markedly on this point. One theory suggests that vicarious pain involves shared expe-
rience, activating neural circuits that represent somatic pain in the perceiver. Such theories are based
largely on overlapping activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insular
(aINS)
cortices

(Corradi-
Dell’Acqua et al., 2011; 2016; Fan et al., 2011; Jackson et al., 2005; 2006a; Lamm et al., 2007;
2011; Ogino et al., 2007; Singer et al., 2004). Such overlaps have also been found in primary and
secondary somatosensory areas [i.e., SI and SII] (Jackson et al., 2005; Keysers et al., 2004;
Lamm et al., 2011; Singer et al., 2004). Witnessing others in pain can increase one’s own pain
(Langford et al., 2006; Loggia et al., 2008), and placebos given for somatic pain can also reduce
vicarious ‘pain’ (Ru
¨tgen et al., 2015). Together, these findings have been taken as brain evidence
for shared representation of pain. In particular, dACC and aINS activation are thought to reflect a
kind of shared experience that has been described in terms of ’neural resonance’ (Zaki et al., 2012),
and as ’automatic’ (Singer et al., 2004). By this account, empathy is ’built bottom up from relatively
simple mechanisms of action production and perception’ (Iacoboni, 2009).
Another theory suggests that vicarious pain may be primarily a reflective, cognitive experience
whose experiential qualities are hard to mimic or simulate directly (Hooker et al., 2008;
eLife digest The ability to experience others’ pain is a cornerstone of empathy, and binds us
together in times of hardship. However, we have not yet fully understood the complex interactions
in the brain that make people empathetic to others’ suffering. One possibility is that we experience
others’ pain through the activation of the same brain regions as those that enable us to experience
physical pain ourselves.
To test this idea, Krishnan et al. compared patterns of brain activity in human volunteers as they
experienced pain (from heat being applied to their forearm or foot) or watched images of others’
hands or feet being injured. While watching these images, the volunteers were asked to try to
imagine that the injuries were happening to their own bodies.
The patterns of brain activity that arose when the volunteers observed someone else in pain did
not overlap with the patterns produced when the volunteers experienced pain themselves. Instead,
seeing someone else in pain activated regions involved in taking another person’s perspective. This
process, which is known as mentalizing, involves thinking about the other person’s thoughts,
intentions and preferences. Thus within the brain, the experience of observing someone else in pain
is distinct from that of experiencing physical pain in oneself.
The results presented by Krishnan et al. raise new questions about how the brain regions involved
in empathy help us to relate to other people when they experience different types of pain. Future
studies should explore the factors that influence our ability to adopt another’s perspective, and
whether it might be possible to improve this ability.

 Loewenstein, 1996; Morley and Morley, 1993; Zaki, 2014). Others’ pain need not activate somatic
pain representations to be aversive (Chang et al., 2015), and empathy may work by engaging other
emotional systems apart from ‘pain in oneself’ (Hooker et al., 2008). Unlike somatic pain, vicarious
pain is all too easy to ignore. For example, many participants will inflict substantial pain on an inno-
cent person when instructed to do so by authority figures (Cheetham et al., 2009; Milgram, 1963).
We also ignore our own past and future pain (Gilbert et al., 1998; Loewenstein, 1996; Van Boven
and Loewenstein, 2003), making decisions in line with our goals when pain is distant but often
reversing those choices when pain is imminent.
Brain evidence also suggests that vicarious pain may rely on circuits specialized for representing
the thoughts and intentions of others (Cheetham et al., 2009; Zaki et al., 2007; 2009). A network
encompassing the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex [dmPFC], posterior cingulate cortex [PCC], tempo-
ral-parietal
junction
[TPJ],
and
superior
temporal
sulcus
[STS;
(Frith
and
Frith,
2006;
Van Overwalle, 2009; Zaki et al., 2012)] is reliably involved in ‘mentalizing’—thinking about others’
thoughts (Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003), preferences (Mitchell et al., 2006), and intentions
(Hampton et al., 2008)—and in imagining one’s own and others’ responses to painful stimuli
(Jackson et al., 2006a; Lamm et al., 2011). This ‘mentalizing’ network is distinct from both pain-
related circuitry and circuitry thought to underlie shared affective experiences and actions, including
the dACC and aINS (Frith and Frith, 2006; Iacoboni, 2009; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009;
Singer et al., 2004; Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009; Zaki et al., 2007; 2012).
A critical question in assessing shared representation is whether the overlapping brain activity
observed really reflects shared pain-related processes. Several recent lines of evidence suggest this
may not be the case. In a meta-analysis of over 3500 neuroimaging studies available from Neuro-
synth.org, activation in the aINS and dACC were among the most frequently observed findings
across all kinds of tasks (Yarkoni et al., 2011), suggesting that activation in these regions frequently
has nothing to do with pain. It is possible that activity in portions of the dACC is preferentially
related to pain on average; for example, Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2015 used Neurosynth.org
to identify a statistical association between studies using the term ’pain’ and activation of the dACC.
However, this does not mean that dACC activity is sufficient to infer pain, as the dACC responds to
a variety of cognitive and emotional events that are not painful (Wager et al., 2016). For instance,
electrophysiological and optogenetic studies have identified neurons engaged during foraging
behavior, attention, emotion, reward expectancy, skeletomotor and visceromotor activity, and other
functions (Davis et al., 2005; Picard and Strick, 1996; Shidara and Richmond, 2002). ‘Pain-encod-
ing’ portions of the dACC can be activated in individuals with a congenital insensitivity to pain
(Salomons et al., 2016). Only a small minority of dACC neurons are pain-related (Davis et al., 2005;
Hutchison et al., 1999), and the dACC encodes emotional events, including rejection and general
negative emotion, in a way that is distinct from how it encodes pain (Chang et al., 2015;
Woo et al., 2014). More fine-grained analyses of population-level representations are required to
make inferences about pain based on activity in the dACC and other regions.
In this study, we attempted to identify representations (or markers) for somatic and vicarious
pain—both within the dACC and aINS and across the brain—and test their similarity. For a marker
(e.g., a multivariate brain pattern) to serve as a representation of pain, it should satisfy three criteria.
It should: a) closely track pain experience (be sensitive to the presence of pain); b) not respond to
experiences that are defined as non-painful (be pain-specific); and c) generalize across multiple
forms of pain (Woo and Wager, 2015). Only to the degree that brain patterns represent somatic
and vicarious pain does testing their similarity bear on shared representation theories. Previous stud-
ies [e.g.,(Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2011; Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2016)] have compared the
similarity of self-pain and other-pain patterns, but these patterns have not shown strong sensitivity
to pain experience [criterion (a) above]. Indeed, prior work has suggested that sensitivity to pain and
emotional experiences requires combining signals across brain regions and networks (Chang et al.,
2015; Kassam et al., 2013; Kragel and Labar, 2013; Nummenmaa et al., 2014; Wager et al.,
2015), whereas previous studies of vicarious pain have focused only on local patterns within a single
region at a time. In addition, the patterns identified as shared across self- and other-pain have
responded to other types of negative emotion (e.g., emotional pictures, disgust, and unfairness),
and so do not satisfy criterion (b) for pain representations. Finally, no vicarious pain studies have
tested generalizability of a specific brain pattern across types of pain [criterion (c)].

 Here, in Study 1, we used a 3 (stimulation level) � 2 (body site) � 2 (pain modality; i.e., somatic
vs. vicarious) experimental design, with pain reports after each trial, to identify patterns that pre-
dicted the level of reported somatic and vicarious pain in response to painful heat and observation
of pain in others, respectively. Between-participant machine learning analyses were used to identify
patterns that test sensitivity [i.e., satisfy criterion (a) above] for both pain modalities (i.e., somatic vs.
vicarious), and to provide an unbiased test of similarity and cross-prediction across somatic and
vicarious pain predictive patterns. In addition, we tested somatotopy (upper versus lower limb)
within sensory cortices and other systems for both pain modalities, and compared the somatotopic
representations. The identification of patterns that can be generalized across participants allowed us
to test the specificity [criterion (b)], and generalizability [criterion (c)] of these patterns in additional
studies.
Previous work has identified a pattern that is, thus far, sensitive and specific [criteria (a) and (b)
above] for somatic pain across multiple studies. We used this pattern, called the Neurologic Pain Sig-
nature [NPS; (Wager et al., 2013)], in our primary analyses, and attempted to identify a parallel pat-
tern for vicarious pain. The NPS has over 90% sensitivity and specificity in predicting somatic pain
relative to several other salient states, including non-painful warmth, anticipated pain, pain recall
(Wager et al., 2013), social rejection (Woo et al., 2014), and general negative emotion
(Chang et al., 2015). In the current paper, Study 2 and Study 3 tested the generalizability of the
NPS to mechanical and electrical pain, respectively [addressing criterion (c) above]. Study 3 also pro-
vided a replication of the sensitivity, specificity, and similarity of somatic and vicarious pain predic-
tive patterns. Our primary goal was to identify—and test the similarity of—whole-brain patterns for
somatic and vicarious pain that generalize across individuals and can be tested prospectively in mul-
tiple studies. However, we also conducted analyses focused on the dACC and aINS specifically, and
on pain-predictive patterns identified for each individual participant. In addition, we conducted
‘searchlight’ analyses designed to test the maximal similarity of local brain patterns related to
somatic and vicarious pain across the brain, and provide inferences on whether distributed, whole-
brain patterns are necessary to capture representations of both somatic and vicarious pain.
Results
Reported intensity
In Study 1, for the somatic pain condition, participants were scanned using functional Magnetic Res-
onance Imaging (fMRI) while they experienced three levels of thermal pain (46, 47 or 48˚C;
Figure 1A) on their left volar forearm (the ‘upper limb or UL’ site) and left dorsal foot (the ‘lower
limb or LL’ site), and rated the intensity of pain with their right hand following every trial. In the vicar-
ious pain condition, participants were scanned while they viewed images depicting injury to others’
right hands (the ‘upper limb or UL’ site) and feet (the ‘lower limb or LL’ site) and engaged in per-
spective-taking (Jackson et al., 2006a; 2005)—participants imagined that the injuries were happen-
ing to their own bodies—to actively reference the observed pain to their own bodies.
Participants reported increased intensity with increasing levels of somatic pain for both upper
limb and lower limb sites with no significant difference between body sites (tUL(27) = 12.93
p<0.0001, tLL(27) = 10.36, p<0.0001, tUL-LL(27) = 1.08, n.s.; Figure 1B). Participants also reported
increasing intensity with increasing levels of vicarious pain for both upper limb and lower limb sites,
with no significant difference between sites (tUL(27) = 11.99, p<0.0001, tLL(27) = 11.37, p<0.0001,
tUL-LL(27) = 1.49, n.s.; Figure 1B). Intensity ratings were robust and comparable for both somatic and
vicarious pain conditions, with no significant difference between mean behavioral ratings for both
types of experiences (tSom-Vic(27) = �0.05, n.s).
The NPS is sensitive and specific to somatic pain
To test whether activity in the NPS pattern (Figure 2A) tracked both somatic and vicarious pain
intensity, we calculated the NPS pattern response [the weighted average activation; (Wager et al.,
2013)] for each single-participant activation map (regression parameter estimate maps from single-
participant general linear models) for each condition (3 stimulation levels � 2 body sites � 2 pain
modalities [i.e., somatic vs. vicarious]). This provided a measure of the NPS pattern activation in each

 condition for each participant, which we analyzed for effects of stimulation level within each body
site and for differences across body sites and pain modalities.
The NPS response increased monotonically for each level of somatic pain for both upper limb
and lower limb sites (tUL(27) = 9.08, p<0.0001, accuracyHigh-Low= 100%, p<0.0001; tLL(27) = 8.88,
p<0.0001, accuracyHigh-Low = 100%, p<0.0001; see Figure 2B and C. The NPS response was slightly
reduced on the lower limb site (tUL-LL(27) = 2.13, p<0.05; see Figure 2B and C), but this difference
was not significant after controlling for rated intensity, implying that the NPS response magnitude is
consistent with the reported intensity across both sites.

 Importantly, the NPS response did not increase across levels of vicarious pain on either site
(tUL(27) = �1.57, n.s., tLL(27) = �1.99, n.s., tUL-LL(27) = 1.71, n.s.; see Figure 2B and C). Individual
participants also showed the same pattern of NPS responses for both somatic and vicarious pain
(Figure 2D).
There was a strong de-activation in the NPS response for all vicarious pain conditions, with levels
below zero. This decrease was driven by picture-induced activation of regions negatively predictive
of pain in the NPS (e.g., ventral occipital cortex, superior temporal sulcus, ventromedial prefrontal
cortex; see Appendix and Appendix 1—figure 1 for additional details).
Additional analyses re-training a new somatic pain pattern on this dataset showed similar results
(see Appendix and Appendix 1—figure 2 for more details) but the NPS is preferred because it was
defined a priori and its specificity was validated across multiple datasets.
A novel signature sensitive and specific to vicarious pain
We next sought to identify a distributed pattern of fMRI activity that predicts the intensity of vicari-
ous pain experience (i.e., Vicarious Pain Signature or VPS). To parallel the development of the NPS
(Wager et al., 2013), we used LASSO-PCR (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-regu-
larized Principal Components Regression) to predict the intensity of reported vicarious pain during
pain observation (Wager et al., 2013). We used a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation (see
’Materials and methods’ for details; Figure 3A shows the thresholded VPS map using a bootstrap
procedure) to get an unbiased test of responses to both somatic and vicarious pain in held-out
individuals.
The VPS responded strongly and monotonically to increases in vicarious pain for both upper limb
and lower limb sites (tUL(27) = 7.42, p<0.0001, accuracyHigh-Low = 89%, p<0.0001; tLL(27) = 10.44,
p<0.0001, accuracyHigh-Low = 100%, p<0.0001; Figure 3B and C), with a reduced response for the
lower limb site (tUL-LL(27)=2.83, p<0.05). Importantly, the VPS showed near-zero responses for all lev-
els of somatic pain, and did not differentiate between somatic pain levels (tUL(27) = 1.39, n.s., tLL(27)
= 0.84, n.s., tUL-LL(27) = 0.33, n.s.; see Figure 3B and C). Individual participants also showed the
same pattern of VPS responses for both somatic and vicarious pain (Figure 3D).
To test how strongly the VPS’s sensitivity and specificity depended on occipital activation—which
might be related to enhanced sensory attention—we re-trained the VPS excluding the occipital cor-
tex, with qualitatively identical results (see Appendix and Appendix 1—figure 3 for more details).
The signature response monotonically increased for each level of vicarious pain for both the upper
limb and lower limb sites (tUL(27) = 5.75, p<0.0001, tLL(27) = 5.45, p<0.0001, accuracyHvic-Lvic = 93%,
p<0.0001), but did not differentiate between high and low levels of somatic pain (tUL(27) = 1.56, n.
s., tLL(27) = 1.23, n.s.; tUL-LL(27) = 0.03, n.s., accuracyHsom-Lsom = 64%, n.s.).
Additionally, we examined whether the observed differences between the NPS and VPS patterns
were due to differences in the lateralization of stimuli presentation. As in the studies used to define
and validate the NPS, somatic pain was administered on the left limbs. Likewise, as in previous litera-
ture, the visual stimuli used to evoke vicarious pain showed injuries to the right limbs. This mirrors
the side of painful stimulation from the observer’s point of view in an allocentric reference frame,
but not an egocentric one; thus, laterality could conceivably play a role. To test this, we repeated
the signature response analysis with a left-right flipped version of the VPS pattern (excluding the
occipital cortex), which preserves the pattern but with opposite laterality. The results remained the
same: The flipped VPS pattern did not track somatic pain intensity (tUL(27) = 1.47, n.s., tLL(27) =
0.04, n.s., accuracyHsom-Lsom = 50%, n.s.), but did track vicarious pain intensity (tUL(27) = 2.68,
p<0.05, tLL(27) = 2.53, p<0.05, accuracyHvic-Lvic = 79%, p<0.005). These results indicate that the later-
ality of the VPS, and by extension the laterality of the stimuli it was trained on, are not an important
determinant of its functional properties.

 Somatic and vicarious pain: encoded in dissociable brain systems
As described above, each of the two patterns we identified (the NPS and VPS) was influenced by
only one type of ‘pain’ induction: Somatic pain induced intensity-dependent responses in the NPS
only, and vicarious pain induced intensity-dependent responses in the VPS only. This pattern of
results shows separate modifiability of these patterns, a strong inferential criterion by which two pro-
cesses are functionally independent if experimental manipulations can modify each pattern without
affecting the other one (Sternberg, 2001). It rules out common influences of general shared pro-
cesses such as increased allocation of attention [e.g., (Woo et al., 2014)].
In addition, the two patterns were anatomically distinct. Regions in the NPS that most reliably
predicted somatic pain included aINS, dACC, dorso-posterior insula (dpINS), and SII. By contrast,
VPS regions encoding vicarious pain included the dmPFC, amygdala, PCC, and TPJ. Moreover, the
predictive weights in the NPS and VPS were orthogonal, showing near-zero spatial correlations
across the brain (r = �0.03; 104,360 voxels in the NPS & VPS) and within key regions (see below).
Additional analyses showed that both the NPS and VPS were activated in response to the somatic
or vicarious pain stimulus specifically during the stimulation period, with the expected time course.
Both the NPS and VPS responded only during somatic and vicarious pain events, respectively, with
no anticipatory activity (Figure 4A and B). There were small differences in the time courses of
responses to somatic and vicarious pain, which are expected because somatic pain summates across
time and peaks after stimulus offset (Koyama et al., 2004), whereas vicarious pain does not have
this physiological property. Critically, we found no evidence for ‘off-target’ responses (VPS
responses to somatic pain or NPS responses to vicarious pain) at any point during the trial.
Another issue that may make the NPS and VPS responses appear more dissimilar is differential
habituation or sensitization across trials. To test this, we estimated NPS and VPS amplitudes for each
trial using a ‘beta series’ approach (Mumford et al., 2012) and examined their stability across trials.
We did not see any evidence for systematic variation [e.g., sensitization or habituation; (Jepma and
Wager, 2013)] across trials (see Appendix and Appendix 1—figure 4).
Additionally, we tested whether the VPS pattern was similar to whole-brain patterns we identified
as related to (a) romantic rejection (Woo et al., 2014) and (b) negative emotion induced by affective
pictures (Chang et al., 2015), two other types of aversive experience. The VPS was uncorrelated
with either pattern (r = �0.03 and r = 0.03, respectively), demonstrating that the signature for vicari-
ous pain is not a marker for general negative emotion, unlike previous results (Corradi-
Dell’Acqua et al., 2011), and supporting the specificity of the VPS for pain empathy.
Dissociable local representations for ‘pain affect’
Theories of pain empathy have focused on the dACC and aINS as critical for shared representations
of pain affect, and emphasize overlapping activity in spite of differences in the sensory system
involved (e.g., somatic vs. visual). Like previous work (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2011; Lamm et al.,
2011; Singer et al., 2004), we found strong activation in these regions in both somatic and vicarious
pain in standard univariate analyses (Figure 5A[I] and A[II]). We identified regions of overlapping
activation in the dACC and aINS (Figure 5B), and tested the similarity and separate modifiability of

The NPS and VPS pattern weights within the aINS and dACC were negatively correlated (aINS:
r = �0.31 [349 Voxels]; dACC: r = �0.41 [1,125 Voxels]; see Figure 5C), indicating a lack of posi-
tive shared representation. Additionally, we used data from each region of interest (ROI) to train
local patterns predictive of somatic and vicarious pain intensity within individual participants. These
patterns were also spatially uncorrelated within each region (aINS: mean r = 0.0185 ± 0.0092, n.s.;
dACC: mean r = 0.0350 ± 0.0195, n.s.). Further analyses indicated that both dACC and aINS suc-

 75%, p<0.01). Vicarious pain, however, showed marginal within-modality classification (aINS: 71%,
p<0.05; dACC: 57%, n.s.), suggesting that local patterns may be insufficient to represent vicarious
pain. Importantly, cross-prediction analyses showed that the somatic pain pattern did not predict
vicarious pain intensity in both aINS and dACC, and vice versa (all accuracy values < 54%, n.s.),
demonstrating separate modifiability. Together, these results support the independence of somatic
and vicarious pain representations in the aINS and dACC. In addition, they suggest that vicarious
pain representation is distributed across regions, and can best be captured in whole-brain but not
local analyses.
Finally, we used within-individual searchlight analysis (8 mm sphere) to test (a) whether any local
region of the brain was highly predictive of somatic or vicarious pain, and (b) whether there was
strong shared representation in any local region (Kriegeskorte et al., 2006). The within-modality
patterns exhibited a similar spatial topography to our whole-brain analyses (see Figure 6A–D), but
no results for vicarious pain survived false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing. Impor-
tantly, the effect sizes even for the most predictive regions were an order of magnitude smaller than
those observed in our whole brain analyses: The maximal within-modality effect size out of 181,129
local regions tested was r2 = 0.06 for somatic pain and r2 = 0.018 for vicarious pain. In addition, no
cross-prediction results survived FDR correction, and the distribution of cross-prediction results
across regions was centered on zero for both somatic and vicarious pain (see Figure 6A–D). Again,
effect sizes across the brain were small: The largest effects were r2 = 0.011 (somatic to vicarious) and
r2 = 0.017 (vicarious to somatic), indicating that local regions are insufficient by themselves to accu-
rately predict ratings, and distributed patterns are required. Together, these results suggest that
though there may be weak shared pattern information (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2011; 2016), local
patterns in the aINS and dACC are insufficient to serve as representations for vicarious pain. In addi-
tion, separate cross-validated prediction analyses within-individuals revealed that whole brain spatial
patterns predictive of somatic and vicarious pain were spatially uncorrelated (mean r = 0.0055 ±
0.0065 S.E., n.s.; see Appendix and Appendix 1—figure 5).
Somatic pain and vicarious pain have divergent somatotopy
The results presented above demonstrate that both the NPS and VPS generalize across upper and
lower limb sites. However, our experimental design also allowed us to identify body-site specific rep-
resentations and provide a preliminary comparison of the somatotopic organization of somatic and
vicarious pain. Shared somatotopic organization (e.g., if vicarious pain on the upper limb activated
upper limb-specific somatosensory regions) would provide evidence for shared representation, while
divergent somatotopy would provide further evidence for differential brain representation.
We trained between-participant support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to differentiate between
upper and lower limb sites separately for somatic and vicarious pain (we also performed within-par-
ticipant SVM classification for completeness, with the same results; see Appendix for details). We
then compared the body site-predictive maps across somatic and vicarious pain. The leave-one-par-
ticipant-out SVM classifier successfully discriminated somatic pain on upper limb (UL) versus lower
limb (LL) sites (see Figure 7A; tSom.Pain(27) = 6.90, p<0.0001; accuracyUL-LL= 93%, p<0.0001). The
regions that made reliable contributions to classification (as tested with a bootstrap procedure; see
’Materials and methods’ for details) paralleled the somatotopy identified in previous literature,
including specific regions of contralateral SI, mid INS, and dpINS (Baumga
¨rtner et al., 2010;
Brooks et al., 2005; Hua et al., 2005; Picard and Strick, 1996). For vicarious pain, SVM classifica-
tion also discriminated UL versus LL (see Figure 7A; tVic.Pain(27) = 6.12, p<0.0001; accuracyUL-LL=
93%, p<0.0001; within-participant average accuracyUL-LL= 100%, p<0.0001). Crucially, the somato-
topic patterns for vicarious pain did not include the expected topography in contralateral SI, SII,
mid-INS or dpINS, in either hemisphere (Figure 7B and C). Instead, vicarious pain somatotopy was
represented in other brain areas, including the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate (ACC),

Thus, somatotopy was apparent for both somatic and vicarious pain and strongly predictive of

 condition. Somatotopy is the primary way of identifying somatosensory cortical representations
(Penfield and Rasmussen, 1950); thus, our preliminary finding of the expected somatotopy for
somatic pain but not vicarious pain suggests that vicarious pain does not involve re-activation of
somatosensory representations. Rather, body site-specific representations of vicarious pain may be
accomplished using the mPFC ‘mentalizing’ system and perhaps other ideomotor systems.
Replication and generalization (Study 2 and Study 3)
To test the generalizability of the NPS across different types of noxious input, we analyzed data
from two additional fMRI studies (Study 2 and Study 3) that used other types of somatic pain. Study
2 (N = 28) used mechanical pressure pain at two intensities—4 kg/cm2 and 6 kg/cm2—applied on
the right thumbnail. The NPS responded more strongly to high versus low pressure, demonstrating
sensitivity to mechanical pain (tHigh-Low(27) = 3.12, p<0.005; accuracyHigh-Low = 71%, p<0.05; see
Figure 8A). The discrimination accuracy is limited here by the inclusion of relatively few trials (5 per
condition). Nevertheless, these results show that the NPS successfully predicts intensity in the
somatic pain regardless of the site of the stimulation or type of somatic pain.
Study 3 (N = 15) used electrodermal (electrical or shock) pain delivered to the left ankle, and also
included an observed pain condition with visual stimuli depicting pain on upper and lower limbs.

 observation only rather than engage in perspective-taking—so VPS activation was expected to be
weaker than in Study 1. The NPS responded more to shock pain than observed pain (tShock-Obs(14) =
5.58, p<0.0001; accuracyShock-Obs = 100%, p<0.0001; see Figure 8B, left). Conversely, the VPS
responded to more to observed pain than shock pain (tObs-Shock(14) = 3.05, p<0.005; accuracyObs-
Shock = 73%, n.s.; see Figure 8B, right). Thus, the findings from Study 3 show that the NPS and VPS
dissociate somatic versus observed pain in an independent sample.
Discussion
The ability to vicariously experience others’ pain is critical for empathy and prosocial behavior. Neu-
roimaging can help understand how we represent others’ suffering by testing whether vicarious pain
activates the same neural mechanisms as somatic pain, implying shared affective experience. Over-
lapping neural responses in the dACC and aINS (Hutchison et al., 1999; Jackson et al., 2006b;

 Lamm et al., 2011; Singer et al., 2004) have been interpreted in terms of shared pain representa-
tions, but these responses may reflect emotions that are distinct from pain, and need not entail
shared experience (Hooker et al., 2008; Zaki, 2014). The question of shared representation can
only be addressed if brain markers that are sensitive, specific, and generalizable can be identified for
both somatic and vicarious pain. Then, the similarity of those markers can be assessed. But can a
representation of vicarious pain be identified, and if so, is it conserved across individuals so that it
can be prospectively compared with somatic pain and related to empathetic behavior? Our findings
suggest that the answer to this question is yes. Is this representation similar to that for somatic pain?
Our findings suggest that the answer to this question is no.
In a series of analyses across 3 studies, we identified distinct fMRI patterns that encoded the
intensity of somatic and vicarious experiences, suggesting that somatic and vicarious pain are dis-
tinct processes. Local brain patterns did not accurately predict somatic or vicarious pain experience.
Instead, distributed patterns within and across multiple association regions strongly and separately
predicted both somatic and vicarious pain. Somatic pain was encoded largely in the aINS, dACC,
dpINS, and SII—regions targeted by ascending nociceptive afferents (Bushnell et al., 2013; Wil-
lis, 1985) and thought to encode sensory and affective aspects of pain. By contrast, vicarious pain
was encoded in portions of the dmPFC, amygdala, PCC, and TPJ—multisensory, heteromodal
regions associated with mentalizing (Hampton et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2006; Saxe et al.,
2003), consistent with other work emphasizing the importance of mentalizing systems in empathy
(Hooker et al., 2008; Ru
¨tgen et al., 2015; Zaki, 2014). These findings demonstrate separate modi-
fiability (Sternberg, 2001; Woo et al., 2014), which entails sensitivity and specificity of each brain
pattern to only one type of ‘pain’, and rules out common influences of shared demands on attention,
‘salience,’ ‘arousal,’ and other more general processes (see Appendix for an extended discussion).
In addition, strong somatotopy was found for both somatic and vicarious pain, though the soma-
totopic organization was very different for each. Somatic pain and touch have a well-established
somatotopy in SI, SII, and dpINS (Baumga
¨rtner et al., 2010; Brooks et al., 2005; Hua et al., 2005),
which we observed here. Vicarious pain showed different somatotopic patterns that, interestingly,
were localized within ‘mentalizing’ systems rather than somatosensory ones.

 A departure from shared representation
Most previous studies of vicarious pain point out its similarity with somatic pain, and it is thus widely
believed that the two experiences rely on the same systems. Why are our findings and conclusions
different? There are three main reasons.
First, many previous studies focused only on the points of similarity—mainly identified in two iso-
lated brain regions, dACC and aINS—ignoring dissimilarities [but cf. (Lamm et al., 2011), who write,
’our results reveal more differences than similarities. . .’ p. 2500]. Here, we aimed for an unbiased
assessment of the two processes.
Second, most previous work has identified ‘pain-related’ activation by contrasting pain with
loosely matched control conditions (e.g., neutral or innocuous stimuli). Overlapping activity in such
contrasts may be caused by many processes that are not pain, including general negative affect,
attention, and arousal [see (Wager et al., 2016) for discussion]. Engagement of these processes may
be responsible for the similar activation in previous work. By contrast, in our study, we attempted to
isolate pain-relevant patterns that predicted the magnitude of experienced intensity, and examined
the similarity of those patterns.
Third, most previous studies focused on voxel-wise activation ‘blobs,’ rather than on multivariate
patterns, which can be sensitive to information at finer spatial scales (Shmuel et al., 2010), possibly
even below the intrinsic resolution determined by the voxel size (Kamitani and Tong, 2005). This
property, combined with our experimental approach targeting within-person variations in pain inten-
sity, suggests that the multivariate patterns we identified are more likely to reflect specific represen-
tations contained in meso-scale neural circuits.
Based on our findings, we infer that the overlapping activation in the dACC, aINS, and other
areas is not related to shared pain experience. Interestingly, on close reading, the few previous mul-
tivariate pattern-based studies agree broadly with this interpretation. The brain patterns they identi-
fied as shared across somatic and vicarious pain were not specific to ‘pain,’ as these patterns were
also activated by other, non-painful types of negative affect (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2016;
Zaki et al., 2016). As in our study, in these studies what is shared does not seem to be particular to
pain per se.
Identifying representations: criteria and evidence
Somatic and vicarious pain experiences, by definition, are similar in some ways and different in
others. They are similar in that they are both aversive, salient, and attention-capturing. They differ in
their sensory input modalities (somatosensory versus visual) and likely many of the cognitive pro-
cesses involved. Brain activity, including both regional activation and multivariate patterns, may
reflect any or all of these processes. For this reason, it is necessary to test the similarity of the brain
patterns that most closely encode pain experiences of each type. We have proposed three criteria
for identifying patterns that may be used to make inferences about pain representation. Such pat-
terns should be (a) sensitive to pain, and thus respond in proportion to its experience; (b) specific to
pain, and not activated by non-painful events; and (c) generalizable across varied instances of the
type of pain. For example, a brain pattern that encodes ‘pain affect’—whether common to self- and
other-pain or not—should increase as pain affect increases, and not respond to non-painful forms of
negative emotion such as disgust (Zaki et al., 2016). Previous studies have identified both shared
and dissimilar patterns of activity (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2011; 2016) in local dACC and aINS
regions. Though an important step, these patterns have not been shown to track pain experience
with meaningfully large effect sizes, and our findings here suggest that local regions are insufficient
to do so. In addition, they have not identified a pattern that tracks ‘pain affect’ specifically and does
not respond to other negative emotions.
Our findings provide an advance because they identify patterns that are strongly predictive of
pain experience. Though they do not test many other kinds of emotions, the patterns are demon-
strably specific to either pain for oneself or another. In addition, a lack of correlations between the
NPS, VPS, and patterns predictive of rejection and negative emotion further suggest that these pat-
terns are not sensitive to general emotional arousal. Fortunately, the between-participant patterns
we identified here can be prospectively tested for generalizability to other emotions and paradigms
in future studies. Indeed, in an initial step towards broader generalizability, we showed that the

 sensitivity and specificity of both patterns generalize to new studies, and that our putative somatic
pain representation, the NPS, generalizes across three types of somatic pain.
The fact that capturing vicarious pain experience requires identifying distributed patterns across
large-scale networks is consistent with prior work suggesting that accurate predictions of pain and

experiences

(Brodersen et al., 2012; Cecchi et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2015; Kassam et al., 2013; Kragel and
Labar, 2013; Nummenmaa et al., 2014; Wager et al., 2015). This work fits in with evidence for

et

spatial
processing
(Fried et al., 1997), and other domains (Davis and Poldrack, 2013; Haxby et al., 2014;
Panzeri et al., 2015). It also converges with views of somatic pain as represented by patterns across
populations of neurons distributed across macroscopic brain regions (Coghill et al., 1999;
Leknes and Tracey, 2008; Melzack and Wall, 1967). Thus, it may be useful to explicitly consider
population coding hypotheses in future studies, at both the fMRI and neural levels of analyses.
Limitations and future directions
Our approach is not biased towards or against finding common or distinct representations. It is
grounded in widely accepted approaches to testing cross-stimulus type prediction (Bruneau et al.,
2013; Etzel et al., 2008; Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2001; Parkinson et al., 2011). However, our
approach is not guaranteed to be maximally sensitive to shared representations. Optimizing for
shared representation would require using machine-learning approaches to predict pain in a modal-
ity-nonspecific fashion. Another important issue is individual differences in the experience of vicari-
ous pain. Having established pain-predictive brain patterns as we do here, subsequent studies could
include stimuli that are externally matched, and brain responses in the ’vicarious pain signature’ are
correlated meaningfully with empathy ratings across participants. In addition, the VPS could poten-
tially be used to test clinical populations: for example, whether patients in chronic pain show greater
(or lesser) responses to others’ suffering. These questions are beyond the scope of the present
study, but could be undertaken in future work.
Our study used conditions designed to maximize the neural overlap between vicarious and
somatic pain, by using ‘painful’ pictures previously demonstrated to induce stronger somatosensory
activity—and are thus potentially more somatic pain-like—than other, ‘cued empathy’ paradigms
(Lamm et al., 2011). In addition, we instructed participants to adopt a perspective-taking stance
previously shown to enhance activation in dACC, aINS, and somatosensory cortex (Jackson et al.,
2006a). Further studies are needed to assess the impact of instructions, mental stance, and which
aspects of pain (e.g., sensory, affective) are being evaluated on the activation of the VPS (Zaki et al.,
2016), and to assess generalizability across different types of vicarious pain paradigms.
Conclusions
This work provides a specific target signature, the Vicarious Pain Signature (VPS), which can be used
prospectively for empathy-related activity in future studies. The VPS may help us understand factors
that promote or impair vicarious pain experience, and its impact on prosocial behavior (Craig et al.,
2010).
Perceiving others’ pain does not appear to recruit the same neural circuitry as experiencing the
pain ourselves. Rather than recruiting our somatosensory system to understand another’s pain, we
use processes involved in representing another’s mental state. The lack of direct representation of
others’ pain in somatic pain systems provides a mechanism for understanding why we might system-
atically under-weigh others’ painful experiences, including their suffering (Gilbert et al., 1998; Loe-
wenstein, 1996; Van Boven and Loewenstein, 2003), and substantiates Adam Smith’s insight from
250 years ago that our moral sentiments are grounded in our cognitive rather than sensory faculties.
Materials and methods
Data from three different studies were used in this project. Study 1 was the primary study that was
used to develop the methodology discussed in the paper. Study 2 and Study 3 were part of separate
projects that involved clinical populations, but only data from the healthy normal controls were used
to validate the methodology from Study 1.

 Study 1 (N = 28) is part of a large ongoing project examining cue-based expectation effects, and
predictive errors for mismatched cue validity across multiple aversive modalities. However, here we
focused on machine-learning based prediction of intensity of somatic and vicarious pain, and the
predictive cue effects were designed to be orthogonal to the intensity of stimulation. Study 1 served
as a training set for the vicarious pain signature (VPS), a somatic pain predictive pattern, and was
also used to identify within-participant somatic and vicarious pain patterns. Study 1 additionally
served as a test set for the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS).
Study 2 (N = 28) is part of a study on clinical pain sensitivity differences between healthy normal
controls and patients with fibromyalgia [see (Lo
´pez-Sola
` et al., 2010a; 2010b; 2014) for related
published work]. Here, Study 2 served as a test set for the NPS to examine whether the NPS was
sensitive and specific to a different type of somatic pain (i.e., mechanical pressure pain), and whether
the pattern generalized to different body locations (i.e., the right thumbnail).
Study 3 (N = 15) is part of a study comparing the cognitive and affective processes for somatic
and observed pain in healthy normal controls and patients diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disor-
der. Here, Study 3 served as a test set for both the NPS and VPS to examine whether these patterns
dissociated somatic from observed pain conditions. In addition, Study 3 involved electrodermal
(electrical or shock) stimulation on the left ankle, which served as another test of the generalizability
of the NPS across somatic pain types and body sites.
Study 1
Participants
Thirty healthy, right-handed participants (Mean Age = 25.2 years, SD = 7.4 years, 12 Females) were
recruited for a multiple session (i.e., somatic and vicarious pain) functional magnetic resonance imag-
ing (fMRI) experiment. Participants completed an additional session on aversive (bitter) taste, which
will be described in a separate manuscript. Two female participants did not complete the somatic
pain session so the final sample size was 28. The order of sessions was counterbalanced, and there
were no significant order effects between participants. All participants provided informed consent,
and all experimental procedures were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board
of the University of Colorado Boulder. Preliminary eligibility of participants was determined through
an online questionnaire, a pain safety screening form, and an fMRI safety screening form. Partici-
pants with psychiatric, physiological or pain disorders, and neurological conditions were excluded.
Pain calibration
All participants completed a pain calibration session to determine if they could tolerate the somatic
stimulations that they would receive in the actual fMRI experiment. Somatic stimulation was adminis-
tered as thermal pain, which was applied on the volar surface of the left forearm (i.e., upper limb)
and dorsal surface of the left foot (i.e., lower limb) using a TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer (Medoc
Ltd., Chapel Hill, NC) with a 16 mm Peltier thermode end plate. Three levels of somatic stimulation
(pseudo-randomly assigned to each participant)—low (44 or 45˚C), medium (46 or 47˚C) and high
(48 or 49˚C)—were applied to four different locations on both the upper limb and lower limb . Each
stimulation lasted a total of 11s with a 2s ramp-up and a 2s ramp down, and 7s at the peak target
temperature. The participants made responses on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which had anchors
based on a labeled magnitude rating scale (Bartoshuk, 2000; Green et al., 1996) for No Sensation
(0% of scale length), Barely Detectable (1.4% of scale length), Weak (6.1% of scale length), Moderate
(17.2% of scale length), Strong (35.4% of scale length), Very Strong (53.3% of scale length), and
Strongest Imaginable Sensation (100% of scale length). Participants first made a moment-by-
moment rating where for the duration of the trial, as they experienced any sensation, they used a
pointer on the screen to move continuously along the rating scale and indicate the level of sensation
they felt at each moment. They then made an overall rating at the end of each trial to indicate the
maximum overall sensation they experienced in that trial. As part of the calibration procedure, par-
ticipants also viewed pictures for 11s (to match the thermal pain trials) depicting varying levels of
injury occurring on the right hand or foot (Jackson et al., 2005). Participants were given the instruc-
tion, ’Imagine the experience if the situation in each picture happened to you, and rate how much
sensation you would feel in that situation’. They used the same visual analog scale as the somatic
pain calibration to make their ratings—a moment-by-moment rating while they viewed the picture

 and an overall rating about their experience after each trial. Participants who successfully completed
the calibration procedure were then scheduled for the fMRI experimental sessions.

All imaging data were acquired on a Siemens Tim Trio 3T MRI scanner in the Intermountain Neuro-
imaging Consortium facility at the University of Colorado Boulder.
Participants completed two separate counterbalanced scanning sessions, which were otherwise
identical except that they were administered different types of stimulation for each session (i.e.,
somatic or vicarious pain). Each scanning session contained 11 runs and lasted about an hour. The
experimental design was the same for both sessions, with the only difference being the duration of
intra- and inter- stimulation jitter. Each stimulation was preceded by one of three levels of predictive
cues that corresponded to three levels of stimulation, with the cues and stimulation completely
crossed with each other (i.e., a 3 � 3 experimental design). These predictive cues were designed to
be orthogonal to the intensity of stimulation, and were used to study cue-based expectation effects
for aversive experiences (to be addressed in a separate manuscript). Prior to being scanned, partici-
pants completed a short training with an explicit learning task in which they learned the levels of the
three cues that were to be later presented in the scanner (Atlas et al., 2010). The first two fMRI runs
consisted of a conditioning task where the participants learned the association between the cues
they encountered in the pre-scan training and the level of stimulation for that session. The remaining
nine fMRI runs consisted of the experimental task with the completely crossed cue-stimulation para-
digm. Participants were unaware of the different types of runs, and performed the same actions for
all the runs. Only data from the nine experimental runs were used for further analyses.
The somatic pain sessions included 46, 47 and 48˚C thermal stimulations and the vicarious pain
sessions included previously published (Jackson et al., 2005) low, medium and high unpleasant
images (which were independently normed through a survey with n = 20 participants). The somatic
and vicarious pain sessions were conducted on different days to reduce learning effects. During
both the conditioning (2 runs) and experimental runs (9 runs), participants received a cue-stimulus
pair for each trial and were asked to make a rating on a visual analog scale (same as the calibration
session) about the sensation they felt after each trial. For the somatic pain session, the participants
rated the intensity of pain they felt during each trial. For the vicarious pain session, the participants
were instructed to imagine that the injury occurring in the picture displayed was happening to them
and rated how much pain they might feel in that situation.
Each experimental run contained 9 trials (81 total for each session), which were counterbalanced
between runs for each participant using a Latin Square design. Experimental trials (i.e., post condi-
tioning) began with a 2s cue followed by a systematic jitter separating the cue from stimulation (i.e.,
5, 7, 11s). Participants then received stimulation (somatic or vicarious pain) for 11s followed by a jit-
tered fixation (2, 6 or 14s for somatic pain and 3, 6 or 12s for vicarious pain). The 11s trial duration
for somatic pain included a 2s ramp-up, 2s ramp-down and 7s at target temperature; the vicarious
pain stimuli remained on the screen for 11s. Finally, participants had 4s to make a rating of the sen-
sation they experienced for the stimulation on a visual analog scale using a trackball (responses were
confirmed with a button-click). There was an inter-trial jittered fixation (1, 4, or 10s for somatic pain
and 1, 2 or 4s for vicarious pain). The jittered fixations were counterbalanced across trials within a
run, so that all runs were of equal duration for each session.
Behavioral analyses
Participants rated the sensation they felt at every trial during the fMRI sessions. All ratings were aver-
aged across trials and runs for each participant, separately for each level of stimulation—low,
medium and high, and for each body site (i.e., upper limb or UL and lower limb or LL). Averaged rat-
ings for all participants from the somatic pain and vicarious pain sessions were tested for differences
in stimulation level, and body site separately. All behavioral data were analyzed using the R Project
for Statistical Computing (http://www.r-project.org/).
Image acquisition
Structural images were acquired using high-resolution T1 spoiled gradient recall images (SPGR) for
anatomical localization and warped to Montre
´ al Neurological Institute (MNI) space (Evans et al.,
Krishnan et al. eLife 2016;5:e15166. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.15166

 1993). Functional images were acquired with an echo-planar imaging sequence (TR = 1300 ms, TE =
25 ms, field of view = 220 mm, 64x64 matrix, 3.4 x 3.4 x 3.4 mm3 voxels, 26 interleaved slices with
ascending acquisition, parallel imaging with an iPAT acceleration of 2). The somatic pain sessions
had 11 runs, which each lasted 5 min and 50s (265 TRs), and the vicarious pain sessions had 11 runs,
which each lasted 5 min and 22s (244 TRs). Stimulus presentation and behavioral data acquisition
were controlled using Matlab software (MATLAB, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts,
United States).
Image preprocessing
All images were preprocessed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK).
Mean structural T1-weighted images were computed for each participant from all imaging sessions.
The mean structural images were then co-registered to the first functional image for each participant
with an iterative procedure of automated registration using mutual information from the co-registra-
tion in SPM8 and manual adjustment of the automated algorithm’s starting point until the auto-
mated procedure provided satisfactory alignment, and were normalized to MNI space using SPM8,
interpolated to 2�2�2 mm3 voxels.
Functional images were corrected for slice-acquisition-timing and motion using SPM8. They were
then warped to SPM8’s normative atlas using warping parameters estimated from co-registered,
high resolution structural images, interpolated to 2�2�2 mm3 voxels, and smoothed with a 8 mm
full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Spatial smoothing was performed for between-
participant analyses as it does not diminish the sensitivity of multivariate analyses (Op de Beeck,
2010), and also captures mesoscopic patterns that are consistent across participants. No spatial
smoothing was performed for any of the within-participant analyses.
Prior to preprocessing of functional images, global outlier time points (i.e., ’spikes’ in signal) were
identified by computing both the mean and the standard deviation (across voxels) of values for each
image for all slices. Mahalanobis distances for the matrix of slice-wise mean and standard deviation
values (concatenated) were computed for all functional volumes (time), and any values with a signifi-
cant c2 value (corrected for multiple comparisons) were considered outliers (less than 1% of images
were outliers). The output of this procedure was later used as a covariate of noninterest in the first
level models.
Imaging analyses
First-level general linear model (GLM) analyses were conducted in SPM8. The first 6 volumes of each
run were discarded, and the nine experimental runs were concatenated for each participant (the first
two conditioning runs were excluded). Boxcar regressors, convolved with the canonical hemody-
namic response function, were constructed to model periods for the 2s cue presentation, the 5, 7, or
11s variable pre-stimulus fixation period, the 11s somatic stimulation (9 levels), and 4s rating periods.
The fixation cross epoch was used as an implicit baseline. A high-pass filter of 224s was used for the
somatic pain session and 309s was used for the vicarious pain sessions. These values for the high
pass filter were determined based on a first-level analysis on the two conditioning runs, where the
variance inflation factor was determined to be less than 5%. Contrasts of interest included the low,
medium and high stimulation period collapsed across cues and body site (i.e., upper limb and lower
limb), upper limb and lower limb contrasts for three levels of stimulation, and overall averaged stim-
ulation collapsed across levels, cues and body site. These contrasts were computed for both the
somatic pain and vicarious pain sessions, and were used for the signature response analyses
described below.
Univariate general linear model (GLM) analyses
A second level one-sample t-test was calculated for each contrast using robust regression. Specifi-
cally, we conducted group-level analyses for somatic pain collapsed across cue, stimulation level and
body site against baseline (corrected at FDR q<0.01). We performed an identical group-analysis for
vicarious pain against baseline (corrected at FDR q<0.01). We then used these results to identify
commonly activated regions (by masking the overlapping significant voxels) for both somatic and
vicarious pain.

 Neurologic pain signature (NPS) response analyses
The contrast images from the first-level analyses for each participant were used as the input for the
signature response analyses. The weight map from the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) pattern
(Wager et al., 2013) was applied to the contrast images, and a single signature response value was
computed for each participant, based on the dot product of the pattern of NPS weights with the
contrast image for the participant. These signature response values were then tested for differences
between levels of stimulation, body site, and pain modality (i.e., somatic pain or vicarious pain).
Vicarious pain pattern (VPS) classification
Data from the vicarious pain session for the 30 participants were used to train a LASSO-
PCR classifier to predict behavioral responses to different intensities of vicarious pain stimulation,
with a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation scheme (Wager et al., 2013). The scheme trains
the classifier on N � 1 participants and generates a weight map that best predicts the behavioral
responses, and tests the classification on the left-out (Nth) participant in order to obtain the cross-
validated signature response value for that participant. This process is continued until all participants
have been left out of the classification algorithm once to obtain their respective cross-validated sig-
nature response values. To display the brain regions that significantly contributed to the
prediction, the pattern map was thresholded using a bootstrap procedure with 5000 samples and
FDR correction of q<0.05.
Vicarious pain signature response analyses
The contrast images from the first-level analyses for each participant were used to compute signa-
ture responses for the vicarious pain pattern. The weight map from the VPS was applied to the con-
trast images and a single signature response value was computed for each participant, based on the
dot product of the pattern of VPS weights with the contrast image for the participant. These signa-
ture response values were then tested for differences between levels of stimulation, body site, and
pain modality (i.e., somatic pain or vicarious pain).
Between-participant local pattern classification
The univariate GLM analyses identified commonly activated regions for both somatic and vicarious
pain, namely anterior insula [aINS] and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC] (Singer et al., 2004).
These regions were identified by masking the overlapping significant voxels, and were used as
regions of interest for separate region-specific local pattern classification. The LASSO-PCR classifier
was trained within each of these regions for somatic and vicarious pain. Cross-validated pattern
responses within-modality, and cross-predicted pattern responses across modality were then com-
puted for each participant.
Within-participant local searchlight pattern classification
In order to identify additional regions that might share representations across somatic and vicarious
pain, a within-participant local pattern-based searchlight classification analysis was performed on the

voxels
(Kriegeskorte et al., 2006). A local region classifier (i.e., LASSO-PCR) was trained to predict behav-
ioral ratings from each modality separately for each of the 181,129 local regions, and the pattern
obtained was used to cross-validate (within-modality) and cross-predict (between-modality) for each
pain modality (i.e., somatic vs. vicarious). For each of the cross-validation folds, one run with upper
limb stimulation and one run with lower limb stimulation was excluded from the analysis. The result-
ing pattern was tested on these left-out runs (cross-validation), and the corresponding trial numbers
from the other modality (cross-prediction). The within-modality patterns loosely corroborate the
global patterns, but are noisier and have considerably less statistical power.
Stimulus and anticipation-related activity of NPS and VPS responses
In order to potentially identify activation at time points that do not match the rise of pain experience
(including anticipation), a smoothed finite-impulse response model (sFIR) was estimated across all tri-
als for both somatic and vicarious pain (Lindquist et al., 2009). These models provide an empirical
picture of the time-courses for the different events in a trial (Lindquist et al., 2009). The first-level

Neuroscience
 betas for each TR were estimated separately at the 11s stimulation onset, and at the 2s cue onset,
for a total period of 32.5s after onset (which was equivalent to 25 TRs). Then, the NPS and VPS pat-
terns were applied to the image obtained at each time point, and the signature responses were
plotted for each of the three levels of stimulation.
Relationship between the VPS and other types of affective patterns
The relationship between the VPS and patterns identified for (a) romantic rejection (Woo et al.,
2014) and (b) negative emotion induced by affective pictures (Chang et al., 2015), two other types
of aversive experience, was tested by computing whole-brain spatial correlations between the pat-
terns of the signatures.
Upper limb versus lower limb pattern classification
To determine whether a shared somatotopic representation exists for somatic and vicarious pain, a
support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to differentiate between upper limb and lower
limb sites separately for somatic and vicarious pain. The weights obtained following classification
of upper limb from lower limb in one modality (e.g., somatic pain) were tested to differentiate
between the same body sites in the other modality (e.g., vicarious pain).
Study 2
Participants
Twenty-eight right-handed female healthy participants ranging from 35 to 55 years (Mean Age =
44.32 years, SD = 4.58 years; Mean Education Level = 14.75 years, SD = 4.78 years) were recruited
for Study 2 (data from 1 participant was discarded, see below). A complete medical interview was
carried out to exclude participants with relevant medical or neurological disorders, history of sub-
stance abuse, psychiatric illness or chronic pain complaints. All participants gave written informed
consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the research and ethics committee of the
Autonomous University of Barcelona.
Mechanical pain stimulation
Mechanical (pressure) stimulation was delivered using a hydraulic device capable of transmitting con-
trolled pressure to a 1 cm2 surface placed on the participants’ right thumbnail. Similar to other stud-
ies (Gracely et al., 2004; Gracely et al., 2002; Lo
´pez-Sola
` et al., 2010b), this system consisted of a
semi-hard rubber probe attached to a hydraulic piston that was displaced by mechanical pressure. In
a calibration session, each participant was trained to report pain intensity and unpleasantness to dif-
ferent pressure stimuli ranging from 2 to 9 kg/cm2 (or up to tolerance threshold) using a numerical
rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (not at all painful/unpleasant) to 100 (worst pain imaginable/most
unpleasant imaginable).
Participants were exposed to two pressure stimulation intensities: (a) low pressure intensity
(4.5 kg/cm2 for 10s) and (b) high pressure intensity, which was individually adjusted to provoke
severe (above 60 in the NRS), but tolerable, pain for each participant (average 5.9 ± 0.48 kg for 10s).
In a preliminary session before the fMRI experiment, each participant was familiarized with the two
stimulation intensities.
All participants rated perceived pain intensity of the stimuli (low and high) that was later applied
during the fMRI experiment using a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (the
worst pain possible). The ’low’ stimulus intensity (4.5 kg/cm2) was capable of producing low-to-mod-
erate pain for all participants during the pre-scan assessment (mean ± SD in the NRS = 36.85 ±
20.38 points), whereas the ’high’ stimulus intensity was capable of producing severe but tolerable
pain during the pre-scan assessment (mean ± SD in the NRS = 63.50 ± 17.73 points).
Experimental sessions
All participants were first exposed to the low stimulus intensity task, which was followed by the high
stimulus intensity task, occurring approximately 10 min later. A block design fMRI paradigm was
used consisting of three events per stimulation cycle repeated 5 times: a rest event with pseudoran-
dom variable duration (duration range: 20 to 32s), a 6s anticipatory event starting with a brief audi-
tory stimulus (600ms tone) that cued the subsequent pain condition, and the actual pain event

Neuroscience
 involving the application of the pressure stimulus (either low or high pressure) for 10s. Each partici-
pant was asked to rate pain intensity and unpleasantness immediately after the end of the trial using
the NRS described earlier.
Image acquisition
Participants were scanned on a Philips Achieva 3.0 TX system (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Nether-
lands), with an eight-channel phased-array head coil and single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI). Func-
tional sequences consisted of gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (TR = 2000 ms; TE =
35 ms; flip angle= 90º; dummy volumes = 4) within a field of view of 23 cm, a 96�69 matrix, and
slice thickness of 4mm (inter-slice gap, 1 mm). Twenty-two slices parallel to the anterior-posterior
commissure covered the whole-brain.
Image preprocessing
Imaging data were processed using MATLAB version 2011b (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, Mass) and
Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London,
UK). Preprocessing involved motion correction, spatial normalization and smoothing using a Gauss-
ian filter (full-width at half-maximum, 8 mm). Data were normalized to the standard SPM-EPI tem-
plate and resliced to 2 mm isotropic resolution in MNI space. From the original sample of 29
participants, data from 1 participant was excluded due to poor signal in the frontal lobe and exces-
sive head movement (z-axis translation > 2.0 mm). Translation and rotation estimates (x, y, z) were
less than 2 mm or 2˚, respectively, for all the included participants.
Imaging analyses
The GLM as implemented in SPM8 was used to estimate brain responses to pain for each partici-
pant. Separate regressors for the anticipatory and the pain periods were used, considering a hemo-
dynamic delay of 4s. In two previous studies using similar procedures (Lo
´pez-Sola
` et al., 2010b;
Pujol et al., 2009), the duration of brain responses to 10s pressure stimuli of similar intensity was
systematially oberved to extend to 16 s (average response duration across pain processing regions),
which was consistent with previous studies (Cauda et al., 2014; Wager et al., 2013). Pain-related
activation was modeled using a pain condition of 16s duration. Autocorrelation was not modeled to
avoid dramatic decreases in efficiency when autocorrelation is misestimated. Pressure stimulation –
baseline contrast images were calculated for each participant.
Signature response analysis
The contrast images from the first-level analyses for each participant were used as the input for the
signature response analyses. The weight map from the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) pattern
(Wager et al., 2013) was applied to the contrast images and a single signature response value was
computed for each contrast image for each participant, based on the dot product of the pattern of
NPS weights with the contrast image for the participant. These signature response values were then
tested for differences between levels of stimulation.
Study 3
Participants
Eighteen healthy participants were recruited through the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
(ISMMS). Participants were excluded based on medical illness or history in first-degree relatives of
developmental disorders, learning disabilities, autism, affective disorders, and anxiety disorders. Par-
ticipants with a history of substance or alcohol dependency or abuse within one year prior to partici-
pation were excluded as well. There were a total of 14 right-handed and 1 left-handed male
participants (measured by the Edinburgh Inventory Handedness Questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971). All
participants provided written informed consent, approved by the ISMMS Institutional Review Board.

 Experimental sessions
Anticipatory stimulation paradigm (electrical or shock pain)
Electrodermal stimulations (shock) were placed to the left extremity, with two MRI compatible EL508
disposable electrodes pre-gelled with a 1-cm diameter circular contact area. This paradigm used
uncomfortable electrodermal stimulation (low current) (LaBar et al., 1998) applied to the left
extremity (lower medial side above the ankle). This is an S1-S2 paradigm with 1s of S1 for safe/stimu-
lation cue and 1s of S2 with/without stimulation, with an inter stimulus interval (ISI) of 3s. The inter
trial interval (ITI) was jittered (4–12s, exponentially distributed, mean = 5s). Mean duration for each
trial was 10s. Different colored squares, identical in shape, size, and luminance, served as the cue
and target stimuli. Participants were instructed to view visual stimulus squares (red, blue, yellow, or
green) presented pseudo-randomly. Participants were informed that a red square with the word ’STI-
MULATION’, when presented, indicates that stimulation may follow when a yellow square appears.
They were also informed that a blue square with the word ’SAFE’ indicates that there was no stimu-
lation when a yellow square appears. Each run had 48 counterbalanced trials with 24 safe trials and
24 stimulation trials. Electrodermal stimulation was given during 50% of the S2 period of the stimula-
tion trials (12 of 24 trials) when the ’STIMULATION’ stimulus preceded the yellow square. In addi-
tion, there were 4 catch trials with the word ’PRESS’ to instruct the participant to press a button to
ensure that participants were watching the screen. There was a 30s resting period at the beginning
and end of each run. Each run took 580s or about 10 min. Two runs of the shock pain paradigm
were conducted. Due to the fact that the threshold for pain perception varies markedly among indi-
viduals, the intensity was decided and recorded individually before scanning at a medium level of
pain tolerable by the participant (using a 5-point scale). No active task was required for shock or
safe trials. However, participants were instructed to press a button when they saw the target follow-
ing the ’PRESS’ cue in order to maintain their attention during scanning. Pain intensity and unpleas-
antness ratings by each participant were also collected at the end of each run with a 5-point scale
using a glove response device.
Empathy for others’ pain (observed pain)
Participants were presented with 256 photographs (in color) of hands or feet of individuals in painful
or non-painful situations, and were asked to judge whether the person shown in the image was suf-
fering from pain or not (Gu et al., 2010; Gu et al., 2013). Stimuli were jittered and presented in an
event-related fMRI design such that presentation of each type of picture was counterbalanced and
pseudo-randomized, with each trial having all events proceeded and followed equally. Each 5.5s trial
consisted of a presentation of a stimulus picture, along with the two response categories (i.e., no
pain and pain) for 2.5s, during which participants made their responses. This was followed by 3s of
fixation. Sixty-four images were selected for presentation in each run, for a total of four runs. The
order of trials in each block/run was randomized with optimized efficiency. There was a 30s fixation
period at the beginning and end of each run to allow the skin conductance and hemodynamic
responses to return to baseline.
Image acquisition
All MRI acquisitions were obtained on a 3 Tesla Siemens Allegra MRI system at the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai. All participants underwent only one session with all scanning sequences.
The whole scan session lasted about one and a half hours. Foam padding was used to keep partici-
pants’ heads still. All images were acquired along axial planes parallel to the anterior commissure-
posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. The order and scan sequences were as follows: (1) A low resolu-
tion sagittal high speed scout image; (2) A high-resolution T2-weighted anatomical volume of the
whole brain, acquired on an axial plane parallel to the AC-PC line with a turbo spin-echo (TSE) pulse
sequence with the following parameters: 40 axial slices of 4 mm thick, skip=0 mm, TR = 4050 ms, TE

sequence: 40 axial slices, 4 mm thick, and skip=0 mm, TR = 2500 ms, TE = 27 ms, Flip angle = 82˚,
FOV=240 mm, and matrix size=64�64. Each run started with 2 dummy volumes before the onset of
the task to allow for equilibration of T1 saturation effects. Stimulation events were modeled as single

 trials. The order of trials in each block/run was randomized with optimized efficiency. A total of two
EPI runs with 232 image volumes per run for the shock paradigm and a total of four EPI runs with
165 image volumes per run for the observed pain paradigm were acquired for each participant.
Image preprocessing
The functional scans were adjusted for slice timing, realigned to the first volume, coregistered to the
T2 image, normalized to a standard MNI template, and spatially smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM
Gaussian kernel.
Imaging analyses
Event-related analyses of the fMRI data from the two tasks were conducted using SPM8 (Wellcome
Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). GLM (Friston et al., 1995) for the functional scans
from
each
participant
was
performed
by
modeling
the
observed
event-related
activation
(Todd et al., 2013) and regressors that identified the relationship between task events and the
hemodynamic response. Regressors were created by convolving a train of delta functions represent-
ing the sequence of individual events with the default SPM basis function, which consists of a syn-
thetic hemodynamic response function composed of two gamma functions (Friston et al., 1998).
For shock pain, there were six regressors (all cues, stimulation cues, all targets, targets with stimula-
tion cues, stimulation, and catch trials); for observed pain, there were two regressors (painful, non-
painful). Six parameters generated during motion correction were entered as covariates. Shock pain
– baseline, and observed pain – baseline contrast images were calculated for each participant.
Signature response analysis
The contrast images from the first-level analyses for each participant for both shock and observed
pain conditions were used to compute signature responses. The weight map from the Neurologic
Pain Signature (NPS) pattern (Wager et al., 2013), and the Vicarious Pain Signature (VPS) were
applied separately to the contrast images and signature response values were computed for each
contrast image for each participant. These signature response values were then tested for differen-
ces between types of stimulation, for both the NPS and VPS.

 Appendix
We undertook several additional analyses to test the dissociability of somatic and vicarious
pain patterns. Here we report results for analyses that have been referenced in the main text,
and include an extended discussion in support of our findings.
Positive and negative pain-relevant signature response
analyses
We ran additional analyses to rule out the possibility that the NPS responses for vicarious pain
were being driven by specific regions within the NPS mask (e.g., the visual regions). Using a
mask obtained from Neurosynth.org (Yarkoni et al., 2011), we performed feature selection
for the NPS pattern with ’pain’ as the search term. We obtained a reverse inference map
based on a meta-analysis for ’pain’ from the journal articles coded in the Neurosynth database
(N = 224). The reverse inference map indicates regions that are most likely associated with
journal articles that focus on ’pain’ than any other topic. The reason that visual regions are
included in the NPS mask is because based on the Neurosynth definition of reverse inference,
these regions are least likely to be associated with journal articles that focus on pain, and
therefore have negative weights in the NPS mask. In the case where the NPS mask is applied
to data that include visual stimuli (e.g., vicarious pain), activation of the visual regions of the
brain are correlated with the visual regions of the NPS mask. Therefore, we extracted the NPS
weights associated with either only the positive or only the negative regions of the Neurosynth
’pain’ mask and computed the signature response for somatic and vicarious pain for data from
Study 1.
The removal of the negative regions of the Neurosynth ’pain’ mask had no effect on the
signature response for somatic pain (see Appendix 1—figure 1A; tUL(27) = 9.26, p<0.0001,
tLL(27) = 7.18, p<0.0001 for somatic pain; tUL(27) = �0.56, n.s., tLL(27) = 0.046, n.s., for
vicarious pain), but greatly reduced the signature response for vicarious pain. In contrast, the
weights corresponding to the negative regions of the Neurosynth “pain” mask showed
increased activity for vicarious pain (although still did not detect the difference in intensity),
but greatly reduced the signature response for somatic pain (see Appendix 1—figure 1B;
tUL(27) = �5.22, p<0.005, tLL(27) = �2.81, p<0.01 for somatic pain; tUL(27) = �1.14, n.s.,
tLL(27) = �3.05, p<0.01 for vicarious pain). Limiting the NPS to only regions that are positively
related to pain in previous studies [based on (Yarkoni et al., 2011)], resulted in strong NPS
responses to somatic pain but no responses to any vicarious pain conditions. Critically,
however, the NPS did not predict vicarious pain intensity, suggesting that the two types of
pain may engage fundamentally different circuits. This suggests that the negative NPS
response for vicarious pain was mostly driven by weights in the negative regions of the
Neurosynth ’pain’ mask.

Re-training of a new somatic pain predictive pattern
In addition to testing the NPS—which was defined a priori based on previous studies—we used
LASSO-PCR (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-regularized Principal
Components Regression) to identify a somatic pain-predictive pattern using cross-validated
analyses on data from Study 1. This ensured that the data and training procedures used to
identify somatic and vicarious pain patterns were identical. Data from the somatic pain session
for 28 participants were used to train the LASSO-PCR classifier to predict behavioral
responses to different intensities of somatic pain stimulation, with leave-one-participant-out
cross-validation (Wager et al., 2013). The pattern map was thresholded using a bootstrap
procedure with 5000 samples and FDR correction of q<0.05 (see Appendix 1—figure 2A).

DOI: 10.7554/eLife.15166.012
The cross-validated signature response monotonically increased for each level of somatic pain
for both the upper limb and lower limb sites, with no difference between body sites (tUL(27) =
8.06, p<0.0001, tLL(27) = 9.20, p<0.0001, tUL-LL(27) = �0.17, n.s.; see Appendix 1—figure 2B).
The somatic pain pattern significantly differentiated between somatic and vicarious pain, and
high versus low somatic pain in a two-choice forced-alternative test (accuracySom-Vic = 89%,
p<0.0001, accuracyHsom-Lsom = 96%, p<0.0001; see Appendix 1—figure 2C), but did not
differentiate between high and low levels of vicarious pain (tUL(27) = �1.35, n.s., tLL(27) = 0.66,
n.s.; tUL-LL(27) = �1.04, n.s.; accuracyHvic-Lvic = 50% n.s.). Thus, the somatic pain pattern
identified in this study is comparable to the NPS, an established signature pattern than has
been shown to track somatic pain successfully across studies.

 Lack of VPS dependence on visual cortical processing
An important issue is the degree to which the differences between the VPS and NPS are driven
by differences in the sensory modality of stimulation per se. This concern applies to whole-
brain analyses but not to local analyses of dACC and aINS, which are heteromodal,
multisensory regions thought to encode ‘pain affect’ and other modality-independent
motivational processes. The predictive voxels in the VPS map are clustered in sensory
modality-independent ‘mentalizing’ systems, rather than visual processing systems. However,
to further test the (in)dependence of vicarious pain prediction on visual processing, we re-
trained the VPS excluding the entire occipital cortex. We used a LASSO-PCR classification to
predict behavioral responses to different intensities of vicarious pain stimulation, with a leave-
one-participant-out cross-validation scheme, identical to the original analysis performed with
whole brain data. The pattern map with occipital cortex removed was thresholded using a
bootstrap procedure with 5000 samples and FDR correction of q<0.05 (see Appendix 1—
figure 3A).

The signature response (excluding the occipital cortex) monotonically increased for each level
of vicarious pain for both the upper limb and lower limb sites (tUL(27) = 5.75, p<0.0001, tLL(27)
= 5.45, p<0.0001; see Appendix 1—figure 3B). In addition, there was a marginal significant
difference between upper limb and lower limb sites (tUL-LL(27) = 2.21, p<0.05). The vicarious
pain pattern excluding the occipital cortex significantly differentiated between somatic and
vicarious pain, and high versus low vicarious pain in a two-choice forced-alternative test
(accuracyVic-Som = 71%, p<0.05, accuracyHvic-Lvic = 93%, p<0.0001; see Appendix 1—figure
3C), but did not differentiate between high and low levels of somatic pain (tUL(27) = 1.56, n.s.,
tLL(27) = 1.23, n.s.; tUL-LL(27) = 0.03, n.s., accuracyHsom-Lsom = 64%, n.s.). The predictive
accuracy for vicarious pain was qualitatively identical, further indicating that the brain patterns
that predict vicarious pain are not tied to sensory-specific cortical areas.
Based on previous literature, somatic pain was administered on the left limbs, and the visual
stimuli used to evoke vicarious pain showed injuries to the right limbs. This mirrors the side of
painful stimulation from the observer’s point of view in an allocentric reference frame, but not
an egocentric one; thus, lateralization of stimulus presentation could potentially determine
some of the functional properties of the VPS. To test this, we repeated the signature response
analysis with a left-right flipped version of the VPS pattern (excluding the occipital cortex),
which preserves the pattern but with opposite laterality. The results remained the same: The
flipped VPS pattern did not track somatic pain intensity (tUL(27) = 1.47, n.s., tLL(27) = 0.04, n.s.,
accuracyHsom-Lsom = 50%, n.s.), but did track vicarious pain intensity (tUL(27) = 2.68, p<0.05,
tLL(27) = 2.53, p<0.05, accuracyHvic-Lvic = 79%, p<0.005). These results indicate that the
laterality of the VPS, and by extension the laterality of the stimuli it was trained on, are not an
important determinant of its functional properties.
Habituation or sensitization across trials
Another issue that may make the NPS and VPS responses appear more dissimilar is differential
habituation or sensitization across trials. To test this, we estimated NPS and VPS amplitudes
for each trial using a ‘beta series’ approach (Mumford et al., 2012) and examined their
stability across trials. For this analysis, we used single-trial beta estimates for the stimulation
period (one per trial), and applied the NPS and VPS patterns. For each participant, we then
regressed the NPS responses against the reported somatic pain rating, and obtained the
residual activity for somatic pain. We followed the same procedure for each participant for
vicarious pain, and regressed the VPS responses against the reported vicarious pain rating to
obtain the corresponding residual activity for vicarious pain. We then averaged the responses
trial-by-trial across participants, and plotted the dynamic changes for the behavior, predicted
signature response, and residual activity for somatic and vicarious pain. We did not see any
evidence for systematic variation [e.g., sensitization or habituation; (Jepma et al., 2013)]
across trials (Appendix 1—figure 4).

Within participant whole-brain and local classification
Patterns tailored to predict somatic and vicarious pain for each individual might be more
accurate, and thus provide better markers for representation that could yield different results.
Therefore, we performed within-participant classification of vicarious pain patterns across the
whole brain and also within the bilateral aINS and dACC. We used unsmoothed (but corrected
for slice-acquisition-time and motion, and warped to SPM’s normative atlas) images for these
analyses. Single-trial level analyses were conducted where first-level betas for each trial were
estimated by modeling the 2s cue presentation, the 5, 7, or 11s variable pre-stimulus fixation
period, the 11s stimulation (9 levels) and 4s rating periods, and the fixation cross epoch was
used as an implicit baseline. Each of the 9 levels of the 11s stimulation period were modeled
trial-by-trial with a total of 81 trial-level betas for each participant per experimental session.
Trials with high variance inflation factors (VIFs > 2.5), and unreliable ratings were excluded
from further analysis. The estimated betas were used for training classifiers (i.e., LASSO-PCR
and SVM) for each participant. For each of the cross-validated iterations, one run with upper
limb stimulation and one run with lower limb stimulation were excluded from the analysis. The
classifier was trained on the trials from the remaining runs and the resultant pattern was tested
both on the left out runs from the training modality (i.e., within modality cross-validation) and
all trials from the other modality (i.e., between modality cross-prediction).
We performed a whole-brain LASSO-PCR prediction of each modality’s behavioral ratings,
cross-validated signature responses within modality, and cross-predicted signature responses
between modalities Appendix 1—figure 5). The somatic pain maps were able to accurately
predict increases in somatic pain (t(27) = 10.65, p<0.0001, average accuracyHigh-Low = 89%,
p<0.0001), and the vicarious pain maps were able to strongly predict vicarious pain (t(27) =
3.37, p<0.005, average accuracyHigh-Low = 71%, p<0.05), but importantly, somatic pain
patterns could not track vicarious pain (t(27) = �0.13, n.s., average accuracyHigh-Low =57%, n.
s.), and vicarious pain patterns could not track somatic pain (t(27) = 0.93, n.s., average
accuracyHigh-Low =54%, n.s.). A one-sample t-test on individual voxel weights revealed very
similar distributed patterns to that observed in the between-participant VPS, which suggests
that the patterns are remarkably stable across participants. We note that accuracy values here
reflect prediction of single trial responses, and so are not directly comparable with between-
participant accuracy values. In addition, the whole brain spatial patterns predictive of somatic
and vicarious pain were spatially uncorrelated (mean r = 0.0055 ± 0.0065 S.E., n.s.)

 Both ROIs were able to differentiate between high and low somatic pain (within modality;
aINS accuracyHigh-Low = 89%, p<0.0001, dACC accuracyHigh-Low = 75%, p<0.01). Vicarious pain
however showed marginal classification for high versus low vicarious pain for the aINS (within-
modality; average accuracyHigh-Low = 71%, p<0.05) and near chance classification for the dACC
(average accuracyHigh-Low = 57%, n.s.). More importantly, neither pattern within the aINS or
the dACC demonstrated cross-modality classification of high versus low stimulation (somatic
fi vicarious average accuracy: aINS = 46%, n.s., dACC = 54%, n.s.; vicarious fi somatic
average accuracy: aINS = 50%, n.s., dACC = 36%, n.s.).
Finally, we trained within-participant support vector machines (SVMs) to differentiate between
upper and lower limb sites separately for somatic and vicarious pain. The leave-one-
participant-out SVM classifier successfully discriminated somatic pain on upper versus lower
limb sites (within-participant average accuracyUL-LL= 100%, p<0.0001). SVM classification of
vicarious pain also accurately discriminated upper versus lower limb sites (within-participant
average accuracyUL-LL= 100%, p<0.0001). Together, these results corroborate the between-
participant findings.
Between-participant local pattern classification
We used commonly activated regions (by masking the overlapping significant voxels) for both
somatic and vicarious pain identified by the univariate analyses, namely anterior insula (aINS)
and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), as regions of interest for local pattern
classification (collapsed across body site). We trained the LASSO-PCR classifier within each of
these regions for somatic and vicarious pain, cross-validated signature responses
within modality, and cross-predicted signature responses between modalities.
We found that the local patterns for somatic and vicarious pain were spatially uncorrelated
(aINS: r = �0.02; dACC: r = 0.02). The somatic pain pattern in the bilateral aINS showed a
linear increase for somatic pain (t(27) = 7.05, p<0.0001; accuracyHigh-Low = 89%, p<0.0001),
but did not respond to vicarious pain (t(27) = �0.51, n.s.; accuracyHigh-Low = 39%, n.s.). On the
other hand, the vicarious pain pattern in the bilateral aINS showed neither within-modality
classification (t(27) = �1.14, n.s.; accuracyHigh-Low = 68%, n.s.), nor cross-modality classification
(t(27) = 1.56, n.s.; accuracyHigh-Low = 54%, n.s.). The results from the dACC showed within-
modality classification for somatic pain (t(27) = 4.02, p<0.001; accuracyHigh-Low = 75%, p<0.01),
but no cross-modality classification (t(27) = �0.07, n.s. accuracyHigh-Low = 50%, n.s.). The
vicarious pain pattern in the dACC showed neither within-modality classification (t(27) =
�1.20, n.s.; accuracyHigh-Low = 36%, n.s.), nor cross-modality classification (t(27) = �0.14, n.s.;
accuracyHigh-Low = 50%, n.s.). Together, these results show that shared representations for
somatic and vicarious pain representations in the aINS and dACC cannot be captured by local
analyses.
Power and replicability
Power and replicability are issues in every study, particularly when making inferences on
selective activation patterns. For example, if the NPS responds to vicarious pain, but with
weaker intensity [e.g., as in Hutchinson et al., (Hutchison et al., 1999)], is our study powered
to detect differences? We address this issue in three ways.
First, we used a study design that does not require that the levels of activity for somatic and
vicarious pain to be the same in order to detect similarity. Thus, if vicarious pain activated the
same patterns as somatic pain, but more weakly, we would identify the representations as
overlapping as long as there is some measurable increase in the NPS with high vicarious pain.
However, our findings do not indicate such sharing.
Krishnan et al. eLife 2016;5:e15166. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.15166

Neuroscience
 Second, we use between-participant multi-system predictive , which do not rely on multiple
comparisons correction—which dramatically reduces power and replicability (Button et al.,
2013; Yarkoni, 2009)—for valid tests of the population codes. These analyses also allow for
unbiased assessments of power to detect cross-modality predictive effects based on the
observed strength of the within-modality predictive effects. We performed a formal power
analysis for out-of-sample individuals, which indicated that in the NPS, we have 100% power
(N needed for 80% power = 4) to detect vicarious pain responses that are as strong as somatic
pain responses, and 79.2% power (N needed for 80% power = 29) to detect vicarious pain
responses that are only 25% as strong as somatic pain responses. In the VPS, we have 100%
power (N needed for 80% power = 4) to detect somatic pain responses that are as strong as
vicarious pain responses, and 87.3% power (N needed for 80% power = 24) to detect somatic
pain responses that are only 25% as strong as vicarious pain responses.
Third, we demonstrate direct replication in new samples with Study 3, which includes data
from a separate sample, scanner, and institution, and show the dissociation of the NPS and
VPS responses to somatic and vicarious pain, respectively.
Upper versus lower limb pattern classification within the
somatosensory cortex
We ran additional cross-classification analyses to predict stimulation site (upper versus lower
limb), restricting training to only the primary somatosensory cortex. We used a support vector
machine (SVM) classifier with data that were masked for SI & SII regions [obtained from the
SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al., 2005)] and previously cited regions implicated for
somatotopy for somatic pain (Baumga
¨rtner et al., 2010). The results revealed strong
somatotopy for somatic pain (upper versus lower limb: 96% accuracy, p<0. 0001) and weak
somatotopy for vicarious pain (79% accuracy, p<0. 01). Critically, however, cross-classification
was at chance for both patterns, and the patterns themselves were spatially uncorrelated (r =
0.022), indicating that vicarious pain does not share somatotopic representations with somatic
pain in the somatosensory cortex.
Laterality effects in upper versus lower limb pattern
classification
In the present study, somatic pain was administered to the volar surface of the left forearm and
the dorsal surface of the left foot, whereas the visual stimuli for the vicarious pain session
showed pictures of injury about the occur to the right hand and right foot. Importantly, the
weights in contralateral hemispheres for somatic pain (right) and vicarious pain (left) were
spatially uncorrelated (r = 0.07). In order to further account for the difference in laterality
between the two modalities, we flipped the contrast images along the x-axis for the testing
set from left to right and found that the weights obtained from classifying the body sites in
one modality still performed below chance on the other modality (see Appendix 1—figure 6).
Together, these results reveal that somatosensory regions do not show somatotopy for
vicarious pain, irrespective of the laterality of stimulation site (right for vicarious pain and left
for somatic pain). However, it will be important for future research to examine the somatotopy
question with greater precision using more carefully matched designs.

Extended discussion
A question that applies to both previous work and the current work is whether the neural
similarities and differences across somatic and vicarious experience relate to pain or
extraneous cognitive processing differences. What is at stake is whether the representations
that encode pain, particularly in the dACC and aINS, are shared by vicarious pain. This
question has not previously been fully examined, in part because previous studies have
identified patterns that discriminate painful versus neutral stimuli but not those that predict
pain experience with meaningfully large effect sizes [e.g., (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2011;
2016)]. Four unique features of our study help to address whether the dissociations are trivial
versus meaningful in terms of pain representations. First, strong predictive accuracy for both
types of experience suggests that the patterns were related to pain, rather than other
extraneous processes. Second, strong accuracy in out-of-sample (for new individuals)
prediction also indicates that our study was highly powered to detect patterns that track
experience, providing a meaningful test of shared representations. Third, lack of correlations
between the NPS, VPS, and patterns predictive of rejection and negative emotion further
suggest that these patterns are not sensitive to general emotional arousal. And fourth,
somatotopy concerns brain organization within sensory modalities, which is expected to be
similar if vicarious pain activates somatic pain representations. However, a full characterization
of pain representations requires a long, multi-study program of research that is beyond the
scope of this manuscript.
Implications for pain representation
The critical issue addressed in this work is how somatic and vicarious pain representations are
related, which raises important (and controversial) questions about what constitutes a neural
representation of mental constructs such as pain (Davis and Poldrack, 2013; Haxby et al.,
2014; Panzeri et al., 2015). One question concerns the level of analysis, as fMRI activity
necessarily integrates across populations of many neurons, and whether single-neuron activity
might provide a different and perhaps privileged picture. A second, related question concerns
whether various forms of pain are represented by localized activity (in voxels or single neurons)
or distributed patterns across populations. For example, Hutchison et al., 1999 found that a
subset of human dACC neurons (11/68, 16%) responds to noxious events, and a fraction of
those neurons (1/11, 9%) also responded to observation of pain, albeit more weakly. The

 overlapping neurons could indicate shared ‘pain representation.’ Alternatively, however, they
may reflect engagement of common processes that are distinct from pain—for example,
engagement of attention, which is known to activate dACC neurons. In addition, pain may be
encoded not in single neurons, but in population vectors that relate to the pattern across
many neurons, and even across macroscopic brain regions.
One way to establish a provisional representation is to characterize the sufficient basis for
predicting related outcomes. Our study is grounded on the supposition that for a neural
measure to serve as a representation of any particular type of pain, it should a) respond
strongly to that type of pain (be sensitive); b) not respond to things that are similar but
acknowledged to be distinct from pain (be specific); and c) generalize across multiple
instances with different superficial properties (Woo and Wager, 2015). Only to the degree
that the criteria are met does it become meaningful to test the relationship among the
constructs. Previous studies have compared patterns for high versus low pain, but their results
do not fulfill any of these three criteria. By these criteria, no single method (e.g., single-neuron
approaches) are privileged as a measure, though some techniques may turn out to have much
better measurement properties than others.
Our study takes several steps towards fulfilling these criteria, but also leaves much more work
to be done. First, we identify patterns that are highly sensitive (and powered) to predict the
magnitude of somatic and vicarious pain experience in out-of-sample individuals, and replicate
those effects. Second, the NPS’s specificity has been tested more broadly across datasets
(Chang et al., 2015; Woo et al., 2014; 2015), whereas we demonstrate specificity of the VPS
here only with respect to somatic pain and anticipation (for somatic and vicarious pain), with
no responses to any of these conditions. However, testing specificity is a multi-study process
that ultimately requires examining many psychological conditions. The NPS and VPS have not
yet been tested on all of the possible cognitive processes that may engage one of them or the
other for reasons unrelated to pain (e.g., engagement of attention), though establishing
patterns that predict pain experience helps to minimize influences of extraneous processes.
Third, in Study 2 we demonstrate generalizability of the NPS across several types of somatic
pain (pressure and mechanical), and we are actively examining the generalizability of the VPS
to other empathy-related paradigms (e.g., ‘cued empathy’). Assessing the full scope of what
processes these patterns are sensitive to is an open-ended process, and a work in progress.
However, the results thus far demonstrate promise that both patterns are useful as provisional
representations of somatic and vicarious pain.
Identifying shared representations for somatic and vicarious pain
Our findings do not suggest that there are no shared processes common to somatic and
vicarious pain. Previous studies have investigated the shared representation question, and
variously concluded that there is support for both shared (Bruneau et al., 2013; Corradi-
Dell’Acqua et al., 2011; Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2016) and distinct (Bruneau et al., 2013;
Woo et al., 2014) brain bases for pain-related and other affective events that were
interpreted as activating somatic pain representations precisely because they activated the
dACC and aINS.
However, it is now widely recognized that these regions are activated by a wide variety of
tasks that do not involve pain at all (Iannetti et al., 2013; Lindquist et al., 2012;
Mouraux et al., 2011; Yarkoni et al., 2011). Thus, neither dissociable activity patterns
(Bruneau et al., 2013) nor shared ones (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2011; 2016) can tell us
whether pain representations are involved unless at least one of the patterns tested is strongly
predictive of pain experience. The finding of shared representation in the aINS (Corradi-
Dell’Acqua et al., 2011)—which we replicated here—does not imply that those shared
representations are actually representations of pain. What is shared could reflect common
demands on attention, salience, and other more general processes. Consistent with this view,
Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2011 provided evidence that the common patterns they identified
in the aINS were not specific to pain, but rather reflected some more general aspect of
negative emotional experience.

 Separate modifiability for somatic and vicarious pain predictive
patterns
Our
study
tested
the
separate
modifiability
of
somatic
and
vicarious
pain
patterns
(Sternberg, 2001; Woo et al., 2014), which can rule out common influences of shared
demands on attention, ‘salience,’ ‘arousal,’ and other more general processes. In brief, the
logic is that if any hypothetical common process underlies both patterns, then both patterns
should be affected by manipulations of the common process in consistent ways
(Sternberg, 2001). In our results, two independent manipulations—of somatic pain intensity
and vicarious pain intensity—differentially affect two unrelated patterns. Manipulating somatic
pain influenced somatic pain representations (the NPS) but not vicarious pain representations
(the VPS), and manipulating vicarious pain intensity influenced the VPS but not the NPS,
demonstrating separate modifiability, in spite of comparable intensity ratings for somatic and
vicarious pain. Furthermore, separate modifiability was found in both between-participant and
within-participant whole brain analyses, and in the aINS.
This pattern of findings is logically incompatible with common-process accounts: If somatic
and vicarious pain manipulations increased arousal (which might be reflected in the dACC or
aINS), for example, and the NPS and VPS responses reflected arousal, then the vicarious pain
manipulation should have increased activity in the NPS and vice versa. Because there was
virtually no cross-prediction of either pattern, this implies that the signature diagnostic of each
pain experience is independent and thus does not share overlapping processes. The lack of
common patterns (cross-prediction) or shared representations for pain as compared with the
findings of Corradi-Dell’Acqua and colleagues (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2011), or findings
from other non-pain related domains such as listening to or executing actions (Etzel et al.,
2008) can be interpreted alongside the strong positive findings. We demonstrate that the
shared representation is likely to be much smaller, perhaps an order of magnitude smaller,
than the strength of the within-modality effects. We also account for non-specific factors (e.g.,
arousal and salience) by training on pain experience and demonstrating separate modifiability.
Thus, our results strongly suggest that the patterns identified in this study reflect distinct
affective processes rather than general processes common to somatic and vicarious pain, such
as emotional arousal.
Towards signatures for multiple affective experiences
This paper presents a whole-brain multivariate signature that tracks pain empathy and can be
applied prospectively to new individuals. We also applied the pattern to an independent
replication dataset, which showed that the VPS dissociates somatic versus vicarious pain, and
included two additional, independent datasets that confirm the generalizability of the NPS
across pain modalities (heat, shock, and pressure), and confirms that the NPS is distinct from
the VPS. Thus, these findings can be used, tested, and extended by many groups, allowing us
to build a cumulative neuroscience of affect across laboratories.
Importantly, our results not only show that the neural bases of somatic and vicarious pain
experiences are distinct, they also provide preliminary evidence that they are distinct from
social rejection (Woo et al., 2014), another type of affective experience thought to be
encoded in ‘affective pain’ systems. Though vicarious pain and social rejection share common
involvement of some brain regions, such as the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex, they largely
involve distinct regions even at the macroscopic scale. The social rejection pattern identified in
Woo et al. (2014) involves a distinct set of regions associated with emotion generation [e.g.,
(Lindquist et al., 2012)], including the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, medial thalamus, and
supplementary motor cortex. Thus, vicarious pain, somatic pain, and social rejection are
distinct classes of affective experience, with distinct neural signatures that we can now identify
and distinguish empirically.
