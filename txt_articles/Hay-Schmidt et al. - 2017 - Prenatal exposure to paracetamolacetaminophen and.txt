Abstract
Paracetamol/acetaminophen (N-Acetyl-p-Aminophenol; APAP) is the preferred analgesic for pain relief and fever during pregnancy. It 
has therefore caused concern that several studies have reported that prenatal exposure to APAP results in developmental alterations 
in both the reproductive tract and the brain. Genitals and nervous system of male mammals are actively masculinised during foetal 
development and early postnatal life by the combined actions of prostaglandins and androgens, resulting in the male-typical 
reproductive behaviour seen in adulthood. Both androgens and prostaglandins are known to be inhibited by APAP. Through 
intrauterine exposure experiments in C57BL/6 mice, we found that exposure to APAP decreased neuronal number in the sexually 
dimorphic nucleus (SDN) of the preoptic area (POA) in the anterior hypothalamus of male adult offspring. Likewise, exposure to the 
environmental pollutant and precursor of APAP, aniline, resulted in a similar reduction. Decrease in neuronal number in the SDN-
POA is associated with reductions in male sexual behaviour. Consistent with the changes, male mice exposed in uteri to APAP 
exhibited changes in urinary marking behaviour as adults and had a less aggressive territorial display towards intruders of the same 
gender. Additionally, exposed males had reduced intromissions and ejaculations during mating with females in oestrus. Together, 
these data suggest that prenatal exposure to APAP may impair male sexual behaviour in adulthood by disrupting the sexual 
neurobehavioral programming. These findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting the need to limit the widespread 
exposure and use of APAP by pregnant women.

Introduction
The foetal brain is bipotential in its ability to adopt a 
masculine or feminine phenotype; a property lost after 
a foetal and perinatal sensitive period (McCarthy 2008). 
The foetal male brain requires gonadal hormones, such as 
testosterone, to differentiate into the male configuration 
resulting in male reproductive behaviour later in life 
(Juntti et al. 2010). It is known that testosterone in 
the hypothalamus through its conversion to estradiol 
increases prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by upregulating 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) resulting in masculinisation 
(Amateau & McCarthy 2004). Accordingly, perinatal 
exposure to the COX enzyme inhibitor, acetylsalicylic 
acid (aspirin), results in the impairment of male sexual 
behaviour (Amateau & McCarthy 2004). It is also known 
that intrauterine exposure to phthalates (like dibutyl 
phthalate), which also are inhibitors of COX enzymes 
with potency in the same range as mild analgesics 
(Kristensen et al. 2011a,b), can result in feminised play 
behaviour among young boys (Swan et al. 2010). At 
the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that

mild analgesics (hereafter termed analgesics) are potent 
inhibitors of foetal androgen production and through 
this mechanism can result in congenital malformations 
(reviewed in Kristensen et al. 2016). Hence, it seems 
possible that analgesics can affect brain masculinisation 
both by blocking the production of testosterone in 
testicular Leydig cells and prostaglandins in the brain. 
Moreover, previous studies have shown that postnatal 
exposure (on postnatal day 10) to paracetamol/
acetaminophen (N-Acetyl-p-Aminophenol; APAP) can 
induce long-lasting effects on e.g. cognitive function in 
the adult mouse (Viberg et al. 2014).
In the present report, we therefore examined mouse 
brain morphology and behaviour following prenatal 
exposure to APAP, used widely among pregnant women 
(Kristensen et al. 2016), and the industrial pollutant and 
APAP precursor, aniline (Modick et al. 2014, Holm et al. 
2015). We investigated changes in the sexually dimorphic 
nucleus (SDN) of the preoptic area (POA) in the anterior 
hypothalamus of male adult offspring after intrauterine 
exposure. 
The SDN has been shown to be 2.5–7 times larger 
in male than that in female rodents, with the difference 
being dependent on induced levels of PGE2 resulting 
from the action of testosterone (Amateau & McCarthy 
2004). Similar sex differences in size of this nucleus 
have been described in other mammals (Morris et al. 
2004, Gilmore et al. 2012). The calcium-binding protein 
calbindin-D28 is one of the best markers for identifying 
the anatomical borders of the SDN-POA in mice (Sickel & 
McCarthy 2000, Gilmore et al. 2012). The protein belongs 
to a family of low-molecular-weight calcium-binding 
proteins that has been hypothesised to play a role in 
neuroprotection against excitatory neurotransmitter and 
calcium-induced cell death (Sickel & McCarthy 2000). 
In rodents, neurogenesis of SDN neurons begins around 
embryonic day 14 and proceeds until about embryonic 
day 18, and all the neurons in the surrounding area of 
the POA have been created by embryonic day 16 in the 
rodent (Jacobson & Gorski 1981). Our findings indicate a 
potential effect of APAP on intrauterine brain development 
and suggest that these changes may have a direct effect on 
male sexual behaviour.
Materials and methods
Mating and dosing
The 
local 
Danish 
ethical 
committees 
approved 
all 
animal experiments. Mice (Mus musculus) dams with a 
C57BL/6JBomTac background (n 
= 
10 per group, purchased 
from Taconic, Denmark) were fed on a phytoestrogen-free 
diet. The dams were randomly caged pairwise with a male 
during mating. Pregnant dams were subsequently treated every 
morning at the end of the dark period from 7 days post coitum 
(DPC) to delivery following dosing protocols also described in 
the study by Holm and coworkers (2015, 2016). Compounds 
were administered in 0.5 
mL water by gavage in the following 
groups: (i) water control, (ii) 50 
mg/kg/day APAP, (iii) 150 
mg/
kg/day APAP, (iv) 30 
mg/kg/day aniline and (v) 90 
mg/kg/day 
aniline. APAP doses were chosen to be nontoxic and the lower 
to be equal to the maximum human exposure of 50 
mg/kg/day. 
The higher dose of 150 
mg/kg/day was chosen so it also was in 
the range of the human exposure when a system of allometry 
based on the body surface area difference between mouse and 
human was applied dividing the mice dose with a factor of 
12.33 (Reagan-Shaw et al. 2008). Aniline doses were given in 
equi-molar amounts to the APAP doses and were, after adjusting 
for difference in body size between mouse and human, also 
within the human exposure range (Holm et al. 2015, 2016).
Analysis of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the 
preoptic area
After termination at PNW 12–13, brains were carefully 
dissected from the skull and examined to explore any changes 
in SDN-POA. Brains were fixed in PBS (phosphate buffered 
saline) with 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently split in 
half in the coronal plane (where the midbrain and the thalamus 
meet) and submerged in 30% sucrose to avoid freezing 
damage. From each of the treatment groups brains were chosen 
at random. Coronal sections of each brain were cut into four 
series at 40 
µm on a sledge microtome. Series were stored at 
−20°C in cryoprotectant with sodium azide (NaAZ).
Before immunohistochemical staining, free-floating sections 
were rinsed three times for 10 
min in PBS and subsequently 
incubated for 15 
min in 0.5% perhydrol (H2O2) to block 
endogenous peroxidase that could otherwise lead to false-
positive results in the non-specific background. Sections were 
rinsed in PBS again before being pre-incubated with human 
serum albumin (HSA) in PBS-T (1% HSA, PBS-T, 0.1% NaAZ) 
for 30 
min to block unspecific absorbance to tissue or to Fc 
receptors and permeabilize the tissue. After this, the sections 
were exposed to primary rabbit anti-Calbindin-D-28K (1:2000; 
Sigma-Aldrich; EG-20) antibody overnight in 1% HSA-PBST-
NaAZ. Next morning, the sections were rinsed in PBS-T and 
incubated with secondary donkey anti-rabbit antibody for 1 
h 
in 1% HSA-PBST-NaAZ. This was followed by another rinse 
in PBS and incubation with an avidin–biotin (AB) complex 
(1:100; Vector-labs) in PBS for 1 
h. The sections were then 
rinsed in PBS and incubated in Vector SG-peroxidase HRP 
substrate kit (Vector-labs) for 15 
min for development. Finally, 
the sections were rinsed twice in MilliQ ultrapure water and 
mounted in chrome-gelatine onto slides.
Defining the area of the SDN-POA
The procedure described by Gilmore and coworkers (2012) 
was used to distinguish the calbindin D28 immunoreactive part 
of the SDN (CALB-SDN) from other calbindin immunoreactive 
(CALB-ir) cells found in the C57BL/6 mouse brain. The CALB-
SDN is defined as a distinctive cluster that is ellipsoidal in 
shape and centred at about 675 
µm dorsal to the optic chiasm 
(OC) and 275 
µm lateral to the third ventricle. It is angled 
away from the third ventricle dorsolaterally and the cluster 
spans between 90 
µm and 180 
µm rostrocaudally in males 
(Gilmore et al. 2012).

Depending on the exact plane of sectioning, the cluster 
was present in sections in which the anterior commissure 
(AC) crossed the midline or, more often, just caudal to this 
point. Using these landmarks to pinpoint the correct location 
of CALB-SDN, sections were chosen with the aid of the 
mouse brain atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (2001). Especially 
in specimens where the calbindin-reactive cells did not form 
a distinct cluster or form a very small cluster (Gilmore et al. 
2012), the presence of these landmarks was the determining 
factor in the identification of the correct location.
Quantifying the CALB-SDN
The tissue sections were examined using an Evolution MP 
Color camera from Media Cybernetics connected to a light 
microscope and analysed with the aid of Image-Pro Plus and 
ImageJ software. All measurements were made on images 
coded to conceal the sex and treatment of the animals. For 
every brain in the experiment, one section was chosen that 
best represented the CALB-SDN. The correct location was 
determined as described in the above section, and if the 
CALB-SDN was visible in multiple sections, the section was 
chosen that had the most CALB-ir cells in the CALB-SDN. For 
the images in the group where a CALB-SDN was discernible, 
an ellipse of a fixed size was placed on both sides of the third 
ventricle in approximately the same location in all images 
relative to two markers, the third ventricle and the OC. The 
placement differed from what is described by Gilmore and 
coworkers (2012) in that it was consistently closer to the OC, 
approximately 400 
µm instead of 675 
µm. The cells within the 
elliptical border were subsequently counted independently by 
two investigators. Importantly, if a CALB-ir cell was lying at the 
edge of the ellipse and was too far from the cluster of the other 
cells, it was counted as a background staining and not as part 
of the CALB-SDN. The number of cells from counts on both 
sides of the third ventricle was noted and added together for a 
representative CALB-SDN cell number from that brain.
Behavioural testing
From postnatal week eight (PNW 8), one male was selected 
at random from each of 8 litters that were prenatally exposed 
to 150 
mg/kg/day APAP during intrauterine life and compared 
to an equal number of similarly chosen controls to explore 
(i) urinary behaviour, (ii) aggression and (iii) sexual behaviour. 
All behavioural assays were conducted 1 h after initiation of 
the dark cycle and the protocols used were adapted from 
Juntti and coworkers (2010) and Yang and coworkers (2013) 
with males single caged and with 2 ≥ days separating each of 
the experiments. The tests were videotaped and subsequently 
analysed blindly by two investigators.
The urinary behaviour in males and females differ by the 
size of the urine spots, numbers and spread. Hence, a territory-
marking male mouse will be more prone to marking their 
territory with urine scent and leave multiple, widespread 
spots, while a female will more commonly choose one or few 
areas where she will leave fewer, bigger droplets (Juntti et al. 
2010). Males were tested by transferring the animal for 1 
h to 
a cage freshly lined with Whatman paper and then returned to 
their home cage. The marking pattern was visualized with UV 
transillumination and the imaging program ImageJ (NIH).
Intermale aggression was provoked by the introduction of 
an intruder male (Barkley & Goldman 1977). A singly-housed 
intruder mouse was introduced to the home cage of a singly-
housed resident mouse (prenatally treated). The intruder test 
was conducted for 15 
min and sniffs, attacks, tail rattles and 
bites of the resident mouse were counted.
Male mating/sexual behaviour was tested for 30 
min with a 
receptive intruder female in oestrous. During mating, the male 
mouse behaviour was documented by quantifying approach 
and olfactory investigation of the female (anogenital sniffing), 
mounting, intromission (penetration identified as thrusting) 
and ejaculation (Swaney et al. 2012).
Statistics
A one-way ANOVA follow by post hoc Dunnett’s tests were 
used to determine the significance between outcomes in the 
neuronal examinations. Unpaired t-tests were performed 
between outcomes in behavioural trials.
Results
Intrauterine exposure to APAP and aniline decreased 
cell number in the CALB-SDN
There was no difference between animals at the lowest 
dose of APAP and control; mean numbers of CALB-ir 
cells were 44 and 41 in control and APAP-treated 
animals respectively. In contrast, exposure to the highest 
dose (150 
mg/kg/day) significantly decreased cell 
number in the SDN by approximately 50% with a mean 
cell number of 21 (Fig. 1). The decrease seen for aniline-
exposed males was similar to that seen for the highest 
dose of APAP. Hence, both aniline doses resulted in 
a decrease in CALB-ir cell number in the CALB-SDN 
with significant decrease for the highest dose resulting 
in a mean cell number of 21. These data suggest that 
the intrauterine exposure may have impaired the brain 
masculinisation process.
Intrauterine exposure to APAP changed urinary  
marking behaviour
Aniline is known to be converted nearly completely 
in the liver of the mouse to APAP (Holm et al. 2015). 
We therefore performed behavioural experiments with 
animals exposed to the highest dose of APAP (150 
mg/
kg/day), which had resulted in a significant effect on 
masculinisation of the SDN-POA. The area covered 
by urine markings in the cages did not differ between 
control and APAP-exposed animals, as both covered 
approximately 13% of the cage with urinary marks 
(Fig. 2). In contrast, APAP-exposed animals had marked 
the cages with significantly larger droplets. Quantifying 
the number of droplets from each animals using a ‘cut-off’ 
of >2000 pixels per droplet showed that the intrauterine

exposed males had marked their cages with significantly 
fewer but bigger droplets (Fig. 2B and C). These data 
suggest that the APAP exposure may have resulted in a 
less masculinised territorial marking of the cages.
Intrauterine exposure to APAP resulted in reduced 
territorial display
The male mouse is characterized by fierce aggression 
towards foreign males. We therefore introduced male 
intruders into the cages of the intrauterine exposed 
animals. Following the males interaction for 30 
min, we 
observed a significantly reduced number of sniffs among 
exposed animals (150 
mg/kg/day) and a similar trend in 
tail rattles (Fig. 3A and C). While the number of direct 
attacks did not differ between exposed and control 
animals, the number of attacks that resulted in bites was 
markedly different; none of the APAP-exposed males bit 
their intruder (Fig. 3B and D). These data suggest that 
the intrauterine exposure to APAP may have moderated 
male-typical aggression during territorial display.
Intrauterine exposure to APAP resulted in  
reduced mating
The male mouse begins sexual behaviour immediately 
when introduced to a female in oestrus. As the urine 
marking and aggressiveness towards an intruding male 
had indicated that the male specific behaviour could be 
reduced in the APAP (150 
mg/kg/day) exposed males, 
we next introduced a female in oestrus to males for 
30 
min to investigate the mating behaviour. Examining 
the behaviour, there were no changes between APAP 
and control mice in sniffing or mounting (Fig. 4A and 
B). However, moving from mounting to intromission, 
there was a clear decline in APAP mice (Fig. 4C). This 
was further supported when examining the females for 
vaginal plugs. 50% of the females encountering a control 
mouse had vaginal plugs after the 30-min experiment 
lasted, while none of the females introduced to an APAP 
male had plugs (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that the 
intrauterine exposure to APAP may have reduced the 
final stages of male sexual behaviour.
Discussion

reporting connections between intrauterine exposure to

APAP and male congenital reproductive malformations 
and other morphological changes. Accordingly, APAP 
has been found to increase the risk of cryptorchidism and 
reduced anogenital distance through its anti-androgenic 
effects; both associated with later life reproductive 
disorders (reviewed in Kristensen et al. 2016).
With this exploratory study, we now report that the 
anti-androgenic effect of APAP on reproduction may not 
be restricted to urogenital development but could also 
include an effect on the masculinisation processes of 
the brain. APAP is clinically the preferred compound to 
treat pain and fever during pregnancy (Kristensen et al. 
2016). The actions of APAP remain partly elusive, but 
one mechanism is through its inhibition of prostaglandin 
synthesis (Kristensen et al. 2011a,b). Prostaglandins are 
oxylipins that induce both pain and fever, while also 
being intrinsically involved in the brain masculinisation 
process during foetal life by translating the testosterone 
signal originating from testis to the SDN-POA (Amateau & 
McCarthy 2004). The convergence of both prostaglandin 
and testosterone inhibitory effects are likely the reason for 
the reduction in CALB-ir cell number in the SDN-POA. 
However, in the present report, we cannot distinguish 
between the effect on testosterone and prostaglandin, as 
evidence also suggests a direct role for androgens in the 
brain masculinisation process. Thus, androgen receptor 
(AR)–deficient mice exhibit results in reduced CALB-
SDN cell number and an intermediate phenotype not 
significantly different from females (Edelmann et al. 2007).
In our behaviour experiments, the pattern of urine 
marking appeared to be independent of the intrauterine 
APAP exposure as the exposed males distributed their 
urine marks across the cage floor similarly to control 
males. However, the exposed males did have fewer 
and larger urine marks compared to control males. 
Interestingly, a previous report, using a brain-specific

mg/kg/day (APAP) changes male territorial urine marking. (A) No change was found between 
APAP males and controls in area covered by urine marking. (B) APAP males deposited fewer urine marks compared to controls. (C) APAP males

deletion of AR in mice, has shown that androgens are not 
required to masculinise urine marking (Juntti et al. 2010). 
Rather, AR enhances the male display of urine marking, 
increasing the number of urine marks and the male 
pattern. With these data in mind, the anti-androgenic 
effect of APAP could account for the fewer and larger 
markings among the intrauterine exposed males.
Both male mice with lesions in the POA and rats 
with decreased SDN-POA cell number have impaired 
mounting behaviour and copulation (Houtsmuller et al. 
1994, Morris et al. 2004, Lin et al. 2011, Swaney et al. 
2012). Furthermore, SDN-POA cell number has been 
reported to be significantly reduced in prenatally 
stressed rat males that did not copulate, and random 
control males with similar lack of copulation had similar 
reductions in cell number (Rhees et al. 1999). Moreover, 
specific lesions in the SDN-POA results in similar 
reductions in copulatory behaviour (De Jonge et al. 
1989, Morris et al. 2004). It is therefore not surprising 
that the reduction in CALB-ir cell number in the SDN-
POA reported here is correlated with a reduction in male 
sexual behaviour and lack of ejaculation. These data are 
also in accordance with a former rat study that showed 
that intrauterine and perinatal exposure to acetylsalicylic 
acid, an analgesic not recommended during pregnancy 
(Kristensen et al. 2016), resulted in reduced copulatory 
behaviour (Amateau & McCarthy 2004).
As several dimorphic regions have been described in 
the brain, a limitation of the present report is that we 
cannot argue that the differences found in aggression and 
sexual behaviour are exclusively due to changes in the 
SDN-POA. Even the POA is known to harbour another 
site of sexual dimorphism termed the anteroventral 
periventricular 
(AVPV) 
nucleus 
where 
increased 
cell number is associated with feminine behaviour 
(Simerly 1989). The regions associated with mating and 
aggression do, however, exhibit spatial overlap in the 
brain (Lin et al. 2011). In some instances, these areas 
respond during both mating and aggression (Lin et al. 
2011), showing that the behavioural schemes are both 
morphologically and functionally linked. Another 
limitation of the study is that the activities of these 
regions are likely also dependent on gonadal-pituitary 
axis e.g. the testosterone-LH ratio in adulthood, which 
was not investigated.
We included aniline in our experiments to explore 
both the pharmacological and the environmental 
exposure to APAP. Hence, it is becoming increasingly 
clear that APAP is presenting itself as a compound 
with a dual exposure pattern, including high doses 
through pharmaceutical use and lower doses through 
the environment possibly through the conversion 
of ubiquitous pollutant aniline and its derivatives 
(Kristensen et al. 2016). Exposure to aniline resulted in 
a similar reduction in CALB-ir cell number of the SDN-
POA as APAP. The reason for this is likely that aniline is 
metabolized to APAP in the liver of the pregnant dam 
(Holm et al. 2015). We used an aniline exposure level 
corresponding to the amount of APAP allowed to be 
used by pregnant women (50 
mg/kg/day) together with 3 
times this amount, reaching a level known from rodent 
studies to inflict anti-androgenic effects (Kristensen et al. 
2011a,b). The lowest level of aniline exposure was 
31 
mg/kg/day, which we have previously shown to 
result in mean urinary concentrations of 309.9 
mg/L 
APAP after 4 
h in C57Bl/6 (Holm et al. 2015). In humans 
Figure 4 Intrauterine exposure to 150

day paracetamol (APAP) decreased male 
mating behaviour. (A) No change was found 
between APAP males and controls in mating 
sniffs. (B) No change was found between 
APAP males and controls in mounting females. 
(C) APAP males had a tendency to fewer

controls. Results are depicted as mean

occupationally exposed to aniline, the range of APAP 
found in the urine is 4.2–10.9 
mg/L (Dierkes et al. 2014). 
The exposure is therefore in proximity to the exposure 
observed among occupationally exposed humans.
In common practice, a system of allometry based on 
body surface area is used to translate animal to human 
doses. In this system, the mouse dose is divided by a factor 
of 12.33 to reach appropriate human levels (Reagan-
Shaw et al. 2008). According to this estimate, the doses in 
this report resulting in significant effects of 150 
mg/kg/day 
are well below the APAP doses used by pregnant women 
across Europe and the North America of 50 
mg/kg/
day. Consequently, these exploratory experiments have 
relevance to human health and follow previous reports 
suggesting an impact of APAP on brain development 
resulting in e.g. hyperkinetic disorders (Brandlistuen et al. 
2013, Liew et al. 2014, Hoover et al. 2015).
