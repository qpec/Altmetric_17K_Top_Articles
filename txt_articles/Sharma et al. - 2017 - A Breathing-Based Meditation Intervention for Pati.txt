Abstract
Objective—To evaluate feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of Sudarshan Kriya yoga (SKY) as 
an adjunctive intervention in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with inadequate 
response to antidepressant treatment.
Method—Patients with MDD (defined by DSM-IV-TR) depressed despite ≥8 weeks of 
antidepressant treatment were randomized to SKY or a waitlist control (delayed yoga) arm for 8 
weeks. The primary efficacy end point was change in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 
(HDRS-17) total score from baseline to 2 months. The key secondary efficacy end points were 
change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) total scores. 
Analyses of the intent-to-treat (ITT) and completer sample were performed. The study was 
conducted at the University of Pennsylvania between October 2014 and December 2015.
Results—In the ITT sample (n=25), the SKY arm (n=13) showed a greater improvement in 
HDRS-17 total score compared to waitlist control (n=12)(−9.77 vs. 0.50, P =.0032). SKY also 
showed greater reduction in BDI total score versus waitlist control (−17.23 vs. −1.75, P = .0101). 
Mean changes in Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) total score from baseline were significantly 
greater for SKY than waitlist (ITT mean difference: −5.19; 95% CI −0.93 to −9.34; P = .0097;

INTRODUCTION
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been recognized as a major public health issue. In 
2014, an estimated 15.7 million or 6.7% of adults in the United States had at least one major 
depressive episode in the past year.1 As a leading cause of disability among mental 
disorders, MDD results in significant functional impairment and increases the risk of 
medical co-morbidity and mortality.2 Furthermore, the loss in productivity has considerable 
economic ramifications,3 especially among patients who do not respond to treatment.4,5
Antidepressant medications and psychotherapy offer effective first line treatments for MDD, 
but only about 50–60% of patients respond to the initial course of therapy.6 Moreover, 
among those patients who improve with treatment, the subset who do not achieve clinical 
remission are at markedly increased risk for relapse.7 While a number of adjuncts are used 
to enhance the effects of antidepressant treatments, they typically offer limited additional 
benefits.8 Side effects can also limit their use, prolonging the duration of a major depressive 
episode. Consequently, effective adjunctive treatments with favorable tolerability are needed 
for those who do not fully respond to antidepressant monotherapy.
Yoga interventions include a diverse group of movement and meditative practices that are 
increasingly being evaluated in the treatment of mental disorders.9 Sudarshan Kriya yoga 
(SKY) is a breathing-based meditation technique previously proposed to improve symptoms 
of depression.10,11 In initial research, SKY has demonstrated an antidepressant response in 
patients with dysthymic disorder,12 depression due to alcohol dependence13 and for 
inpatients with MDD.14 In these clinical samples, the intervention was well-tolerated. 
Furthermore, SKY has been reported to decrease cortisol, increase prolactin and improve 
antioxidant status in practitioners.12,15 Consequently, SKY has therapeutic potential as an 
antidepressant intervention and as an adjunctive treatment for MDD.
Despite increased interest in yoga interventions16, well-designed clinical studies that 
evaluate these approaches are needed, especially in the context of standard outpatient care 
for MDD. The objective of this randomized pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility, 
efficacy and tolerability of a SKY-based intervention in MDD outpatients with inadequate 
response to antidepressants.

 METHOD
Patients
Adult outpatients aged 18–67 years were enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania Mood 
and Anxiety Disorders Treatment and Research Program (MADTRP). Written informed 
consent was obtained for study procedures approved by the University of Pennsylvania 
Institutional Review Board and the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: 
NCT02616549). Patients were diagnosed with a single or recurrent nonpsychotic episode of 
MDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria.17 During the current episode, patients needed 
be on a stable (≥ 8 weeks) dose of an antidepressant(s), which they were required to 
continue (without dose changes) for the additional 8 week study period. Eligible patients had 
17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17)18 total scores ≥ 14 at screening and 
baseline visits. Exclusion criteria included bipolar disorder, psychosis, substance abuse, 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, pregnancy, epilepsy or initiating psychotherapy 
and/or other yoga and meditation programs.
Study Design
This randomized, rater-blind, waitlist-controlled study was conducted between October 2014 
and December 2015. A blocked randomization procedure (“blockrand” package from the R 
statistical programming software19) was utilized to create randomized blocks with age and 
sex as the blocking factors. Within each possible block, study subjects were randomly 
assigned with equal probability to either the SKY or waitlist group. Subjects assigned to the 
waitlist arm were offered the yoga intervention after completing the study.
The yoga intervention consisted of two phases of a manual-based, group program featuring a 
breathing-based meditative technique called Sudarshan Kriya yoga (SKY). SKY includes a 
series of sequential, rhythm-specific breathing exercises that bring practitioners into a 
restful, meditative state. The breathing exercises have been previously described in detail10. 
During the first phase (Week 1), participants completed a six-session SKY program, which 
featured SKY in addition to yoga postures, sitting meditation and stress education (3.5 hours 
per day; Supplementary eTable 1). During the second phase (Week 2–8), participants 
attended weekly SKY follow up sessions (1.5 hours per session) and were asked to complete 
a home practice version of SKY (20–25 minutes per day; Supplementary eTable 2). 
Compliance with the follow-ups and home practice were recorded in participant log sheets. 
Certified SKY instructors were from the Art of Living Foundation and the International 
Association of Human Values. All sessions were conducted within the University of 
Pennsylvania Presbyterian Hospital Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC).
Outcome Measures
MADTRP blinded clinical raters conducted study assessments at three time points including 
baseline (≤ 1 week prior to yoga program), 1 month and 2 month visits. The primary efficacy 
variable was HDRS-17 total score. Secondary efficacy variables included the Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI) 20 and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) 21 total scores. The 
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 22 was used to evaluate suicidal ideation and

 behavior. Assessment of medication compliance and treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) was conducted at each study visit.
Data Analysis
Data reported here are for both the intent-to-treat (ITT) or randomized sample and the 
completer sample. The ITT analysis was conducted using last observation carried forward 
(LOCF). The completer analysis comprised all patients who had an evaluation for HDRS-17 
total score at baseline and ≥ 1 evaluation after the baseline visit. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was change in HDRS-17 score from baseline to 2 months. After verifying a normal 
distribution in the data (“car” 23 and “MASS” 24 package from R), the primary analysis was 
conducted by fitting a mixed effects linear model with an autoregressive variance covariance 
structure (“nlme” R package25). The model included one between-subjects factor (group), 
one within-subjects factor (time) and their interaction (group-by-time) as fixed effects terms. 
Subject was included as the random effects term. The same mixed effects model was applied 
for evaluation of key secondary efficacy measures (BDI and BAI). Multiple comparisons 
were evaluated using Tukey’s test (“multcomp” R package26) to adjust for multiplicity and 
maintain type I error at 0.05 (2-tailed).
RESULTS
Patients
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the randomized sample were similar 
between groups (Table 1). At the baseline visit, the mean HDRS-17 total score was 20.4, 
indicating severe depression. Of the sixty subjects initially screened, twenty-five (ITT 
sample) were randomized to the SKY active (n=13) or waitlist control (n=12) arms (Figure 
1. Study Design and Patient Disposition). Two patients from the SKY arm left the study 
during Week 1, due to events unrelated to the study protocol. One patient in the SKY group 
left during Week 7, due to a protocol deviation involving a change in outpatient medication. 
Consequently, the completer sample consisted of 23 patients (SKY, n=11; waitlist, n=12). Of 
the randomized patients, 10/13 (77%) of SKY and 12/12 (100%) waitlist control patients 
completed the entire treatment phase. There were no reported TEAEs for either group.
Outcomes
Primary Outcome—In the ITT sample, mean reduction from baseline to 2 months in 
HDRS-17 total score for SKY (−9.77) showed greater improvement compared to the waitlist 
control (0.50; mean difference = −10.27; 95% CI −5.04 to −15.50; P =.0032) (Figure 2). 
Mean change in HDRS-17 total score for the completer sample for SKY was −11.55 versus 
0.50 for waitlist control (mean difference: −12.05; 95% CI −6.71 to −17.38; P =.0014) 
(Figure 2).
Secondary Outcomes—For the ITT and completer samples, SKY showed greater 
improvement compared to the waitlist control for the secondary efficacy measures (Table 2). 
Mean reductions in BDI total score from baseline to 2 months were greater for SKY (ITT: 
−17.23; completer: −20.36) compared to the waitlist control (−1.75; ITT mean difference: 
−15.48; 95% CI −8.34 to −22.62; P = .0101; completer mean difference: −18.61; 95% CI

 −11.81 to −25.42; P = .0043) (Table 2). Mean change in BAI total score from baseline to 2 
months was greater for SKY (ITT: −5.44; completer: −6.48) versus for waitlist control 
(−0.25; ITT mean difference: −5.19; 95% CI −0.93 to −9.34; P = .0097; completer mean 
difference: −6.23; 95% CI −1.39 to −11.07; P = .0005) (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
In this waitlist controlled pilot study of patients with inadequate response to standard 
antidepressants, those who received an adjunctive intervention of Sudarshan Kriya yoga 
obtained significant improvement in depressive and anxious symptoms compared to the 
waitlist control. Beyond symptom relief, the intervention had a high completion rate without 
adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study demonstrating SKY efficacy 
and tolerability as an adjunctive treatment for MDD outpatients with inadequate responses to 
antidepressants. In addition, this study assesses the response to administration of an 
adjunctive SKY treatment in comparison to the continuation of the subjects’ current 
medication regimen.
A prior study evaluating Sudarshan Kriya yoga in MDD demonstrated an antidepressant 
response in untreated, hospitalized inpatients randomized to SKY (n=15), electroconvulsive 
therapy (ECT, n=15) or imipramine (IMN, n=15) 14. Significant improvements in HDRS-17 
and BDI total scores were found for all three groups. The SKY group demonstrated 
HDRS-17 improvements comparable to IMN and less than ECT. Additional studies of SKY 
in dysthymic disorder,12 depression due to alcohol dependence13 and depression co-morbid 
with generalized anxiety disorder27 have demonstrated antidepressant efficacy. Direct 
comparisons between small studies with different patient populations must be made with 
caution due to methodological differences. However, the robust improvement in both 
HDRS-17 and BDI total scores reported in these studies are consistent with the outcomes of 
the current study.
In this study, the SKY intervention was delivered in two phases with a significant upfront 
time-commitment and resources required during the first week. During the second phase 
(Weeks 2–8), the weekly SKY follow-up sessions and the home practice required relatively 
less time and resources. For the purposes of feasibility, subjects were allowed to potentially 
miss one session during the first phase, and two follow-up sessions during the second phase 
of the intervention. Additionally, all sessions were held in the evenings to minimize conflicts 
with school or work. Of the ITT sample, 20/25 subjects had additional school or work 
during the two month study period. These findings, along with the subject completion rate 
(77%), support the feasibility of the SKY intervention for MDD outpatients.
Limitations of the current study include the small sample size, lack of an active comparator 
group and potential inclusion of subjects without optimized prospective antidepressant 
treatment. Perhaps most importantly, subjects assigned to the waitlist control condition 
obtained essentially no benefit during the 8 week wait to begin the intervention, i.e., an 
outcome that is not typical of patients receiving attention-placebo interventions. Further, 
although our independent raters did not know what treatment the subjects received, the 
subjects were not blind. In addition, outcomes may have reflected the fact that the SKY

 group received substantial clinical contact and group support, which can produce 
nonspecific treatment benefits. However, it is unlikely that these factors would explain the 
degree or duration of improvement following SKY in this severely depressed patient 
population. Similarly, while all subjects regardless of group assignment were offered the 
intervention, we did not formally assess how subject perception of intervention might impact 
study outcomes. Future studies, which differentiate the effects of the yoga intervention 
versus an active comparator group, are needed. With the establishment of short-term efficacy 
and safety, subsequent studies can assess long-term efficacy, particularly to identify the 
optimal duration of adjunctive SKY therapy.
In summary, an outpatient program of Sudarshan Kriya yoga demonstrated efficacy as an 
adjunctive to medication treatment in a randomized, waitlist-controlled pilot study, which 
included only patients who had inadequate response to ≥8 weeks of antidepressant 
treatment. The intervention was well tolerated in MDD outpatients. Future efforts to evaluate 
SKY in MDD may foster integration of novel yoga-based interventions in the treatment of 
this debilitating disorder.
