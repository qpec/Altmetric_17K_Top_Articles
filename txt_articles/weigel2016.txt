Purpose:
To investigate the association between age at screening 
and detection rates for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 
separately for different nuclear grades after introduction 
of a population-based digital mammography screening 
program.
Materials and 
Methods:
The retrospective study was approved by the ethics board 
and did not require informed consent. In 733 
905 women 
aged 50–69 years who participated in a screening pro-
gram for the first time in 2005–2008 (baseline examina-
tions were performed with digital mammography), DCIS 
detection rates were determined for 5-year age groups 
(detection rates per 1000 women screened) to distinguish 
high-, intermediate-, and low-grade DCIS. Multivariable 
logistic regression was used to compare detection rates 
between age groups by adjusting for screening units (P 
, .05).
Results:
There were 989 graded DCIS diagnoses among 733 
905 
women (detection rate, 1.35‰): 419 diagnoses of high-
grade DCIS (detection rate, 0.57‰), 388 diagnoses of in-
termediate-grade DCIS (detection rate, 0.53‰), and 182 
diagnoses of low-grade DCIS (detection rate, 0.25‰). De-
tection rate for types of DCIS combined increased signif-
icantly across age groups (50–54 years, detection rate of 
1.15‰ [254 of 220 
985 women]; 55–59 years, detection 
rate of 1.23‰ [218 of 177 
782 women]; 60–64 years, de-
tection rate of 1.34‰ [201 of 150 
415 women]; and 65–69 
years, detection rate of 1.71‰ [316 of 184 
723 women]; P 
, .001). Of note, the detection rate for high-grade DCIS 
showed a significant increase with age (odds ratio, 1.18 
per 5-year age group; P , .0001). The increase was lower 
for intermediate-grade DCIS (odds ratio, 1.11; P = .016) 
and not significant for low-grade DCIS (P = .10).
Conclusion:
Total DCIS detection rates increase with age, mostly 
because of an increase in high- and intermediate-grade 
DCIS, which are precursor lesions that carry a higher risk 
for transition to more aggressive invasive breast cancer 
than low-grade DCIS.

BREAST IMAGING: Does Age Influence the Detection Rates of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ? 
Weigel et al
of the national mammography screen-
ing program in the state of North 
Rhine–Westphalia, Germany, from Oc-
tober 2005 to December 2008. Data 
from baseline screening examinations 
of those 733 
905 women were included 
in a previous report of 740 
726 women 
that originated in the same period, in 
the same screening area (12). This 
prior article dealt with the relationship 
between overall detection rates of DCIS 
and the specific detection rates of dif-
ferent nuclear grades (12). The current 
analysis was conducted to assess the 
effect of age as a determinant of DCIS 
detection. All study data were provided 
in an anonymized fashion by the pop-
ulation-based 
Epidemiologic 
Cancer 
Registry of North Rhine–Westphalia in 
Muenster, Germany. The study was ap-
proved by the ethics committee of the 
University Muenster and the Westfalian 
Chamber of Physicians, Muenster, 
Germany.
Screening Setting
The national German mammography 
screening program is based on the 
European guidelines for quality assur-
ance in breast cancer screening and 
diagnosis (4). The target population in-
cludes women between the ages of 50 
and 69 years who are invited every 2 
years to undergo a screening examina-
tion. The program comprises masked 
lesions may be expected to be accom-
panied by not only a reduction in breast 
cancer–related mortality but also an im-
proved quality of life by avoiding more 
aggressive therapies in invasive stages.
An established prognostic factor of 
DCIS is the nuclear grade, which is used 
to distinguish low-grade DCIS from in-
termediate- and high-grade DCIS (9). 
Nuclear grade represents the probability 
of progression to invasiveness; for the 
most aggressive type, high-grade DCIS, 
intervals between DCIS detection and 
the occurrence of invasive carcinoma 
have been described to be 5 years on 
average (10). Furthermore, accord-
ing to the molecular pathway model, 
high-grade DCIS is thought to advance 
to more aggressive invasive cancers of 
higher grades than DCIS forms of the 
non–high-grade molecular pathway (11).
Knowledge about DCIS detection by 
means of digital mammography screen-
ing with respect to nuclear grades is 
still limited. We previously reported 
that increased DCIS detection rates 
in digital mammography screening are 
related to increased detection rates of 
intermediate- and high-grade DCIS but 
not low-grade DCIS (12).
The aim of this study was to inves-
tigate the association between age at 
screening and detection rates of DCIS 
separately for different nuclear grades 
after introduction of a population-
based digital mammography screening 
program.
Materials and Methods

from breast cancer cases that arose in

Advance in Knowledge
 
n For high-grade ductal carcinoma 
in situ (DCIS), the detection rate 
per 1000 women screened 
showed a statistically significant 
increase with age (odds ratio 
[OR], 1.18 per 5-year age group; 
P , .0001); the increase was 
lower for intermediate-grade 
DCIS (OR, 1.11 per 5-year age 
group; P = .016) and was not 
significant for low-grade DCIS (P 
= .10).
Implication for Patient Care
 
n The potential benefit of prevent-
ing aggressive invasive breast 
cancer through the diagnosis of a 
precursor lesion by means of dig-
ital mammography screening and 
subsequent treatment applies 
more frequently to older women 
than to younger women in the 
50–69-year-old population.
T
he introduction of population-wide 
mammography screening programs 
resulted in increased detection rates 
of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 
which was further supported by the 
change from screen-film mammography 
to digital techniques (1–3). The propor-
tion of DCIS among all malignancies de-
tected at screening increased by about 
15% (4), ranging between population 
reports from 9% up to 24% (5).
DCIS is a heterogeneous nonobligate 
precursor lesion of invasive breast can-
cer that consists of neoplastic ductal epi-
thelial cell proliferations. The separation 
from the stroma by a basal membrane 
distinguishes DCIS from invasive cancer. 
Some types of DCIS detected at screen-
ing may never progress to become clini-
cally symptomatic during the remaining 
lifetime; therefore, DCIS detection by 
means of mammography screening is 
under debate with respect to potential 
overdiagnosis and resulting overtreat-
ment (6,7). In fact, effective tools to pre-
dict progression on an individual basis 
are presently lacking, and current treat-
ment recommendations are based on 
the presumptive notion that each DCIS 
lesion has the potential to progress to in-
vasive breast cancer over time (8). With 
treatment, the aim is to avoid recur-
rence, since about half of local relapses 
of DCIS involve invasive cancers with a 
worse prognosis than DCIS (7). On the 
other hand, it is evident that some DCIS 
lesions will indeed progress to invasion 
so that, through detection in mammog-
raphy screening programs, there is a re-
alistic chance that invasive breast cancer 
can be prevented. Treatment of in situ

baseline examinations with complete 
data for age, DCIS detection, and nu-
clear grading.
Statistical Analysis
Detection 
rates 
(per 
1000 
women 
screened) for all DCIS types were ob-
tained over all screening units included 
and participating women in 5-year age 
groups (50–54 years, 55–59 years, 60–
64 years, and 65–69 years). Addition-
ally, we calculated detection rates sep-
arately for DCIS of low, intermediate, 
and high grades.
We used logistic regression to as-
sess the odds ratios (ORs) for detection 
of all DCIS types and, separately, for 
the three nuclear grades, by comparing 
the three older 5-year age groups with 
the youngest group (50–54 years), ad-
justing for variation between screening 
units.
We also calculated a logistic model 
that included age as a continuous var-
iable with four levels, ranging from 1 
for the age group of 50–54 years up to 
4 for the age group of 65–69 years, in 
addition to dummy variables represent-
ing the screening units. All analyses 
were performed with SAS version 9.3 
software for Windows (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC). Statistical significance was 
assumed if the confidence interval (CI) 
of the OR did not include the expected 
value under the null hypothesis—that 
is, at a P value less than .05.
Results
The detection rate for all graded DCIS 
cases among included screening par-
ticipants was 1.35‰ (989 of 733 
905 
women). The DCIS detection rates 
of all types increased from younger 
to older age groups (50–54 years, 
1.15‰ [254 of 220 
985 women]; 
55–59 years, 1.23‰ [218 of 177 
782 
women], 60–64 years, 1.34‰ [201 
of 150 
415 women]; and 65–69 years, 
1.71‰ [316 of 184 
723 women]; P , 
.001) (Table 1).
Detection rates for intermediate-
grade DCIS were mostly lower than 
those for high-grade DCIS, except for 
women aged 60–64 years, while de-
tection rates for low-grade DCIS were 
Cancer Registry. All incident cases of 
DCIS and invasive breast cancer orig-
inating from the screening units were 
specifically tagged in the registry data-
base. The information for the screen-
ing-detected cases was complemented 
by additional notifications from other 
sources, such as pathology institutes 
and hospitals, such that all DCIS and 
invasive breast cancer cases could be 
assessed on the basis of postsurgical 
pathology reports (12).
Data for 17 of the 23 statewide 
screening units were included in this 
study and were related to popula-
tion-based prevalent mammography 
screening examinations. Of those, in 
11 screening units, a mixture of com-
puted radiography and direct radi-
ography machines was in use. In five 
screening units, only computed radi-
ography technology was used, and in 
one screening unit, only direct radi-
ography technology was used. Of the 
six excluded screening units, analog 
technique was used in one unit; in four 
units, operations commenced only to-
ward the end of the study period, so 
they still had numbers of screening ex-
aminations that were too low; and one 
unit delivered the nuclear grading of 
screening-detected DCIS cases in only 
50% of the cases. In one included unit, 
the screening documentation system 
was changed during the study such 
that not all initial screening examina-
tion data were available for evaluation 
(12).
On the basis of a recent repeated 
record linkage, study data provided by 
the cancer registry included informa-
tion for 733 
972 screening participants 
between the ages of 50 and 69 years. 
Notifications of 1071 in situ breast le-
sions, comprising 15 cases of lobular 
carcinoma in situ and 1056 cases of 
DCIS, were available. The proportion 
of DCIS in all screening-detected ma-
lignancies was 17.5% (1056 of 6035 
cases). In 989 of 1056 DCIS cases 
(93.7%), the nuclear grade and age of 
the woman at screening was obtainable. 
In a total of 67 cases with DCIS detect-
ed at screening, either nuclear grade 
or age was missing; these cases were 
therefore excluded, leaving 733 
905 
independent 
readings 
of 
two-view 
mammograms by two certified physi-
cian readers. Discrepancies between 
the interpretations of the two readers 
are resolved by means of mandatory 
arbitration by a third reader. Quality 
assurance tools of readers and pathol-
ogists were described in detail previ-
ously (12). All readers had to undergo 
a dedicated training program before 
they were admitted to interpret the first 
3000 mammograms within the program 
under the supervision of the physician 
responsible for the screening unit. Af-
ter that phase, readers were assigned 
to the routine double-interpretation 
process with a volume of at least 5000 
screening mammograms per year; addi-
tionally, they had to pass a performance 
test annually. All pathologists involved 
in statewide mammography screening 
in North Rhine–Westphalia during the 
study period had to fulfill dedicated 
breast screening courses, including 
grading of DCIS, and had to assess 
samples from a minimum number of 
examinations (samples from 500 core-
needle biopsies and specimens from 50 
surgeries). During the first 2 years of 
program implementation, which is part 
of the study period in our report, a cen-
tralized second reading system for all 
biopsy specimens was implemented to 
reach a consensus in cases of discor-
dance between the initial interpretation 
findings and the centralized interpreta-
tion findings (12). The final diagnosis 
was used for patient management; it 
was saved in the screening software by 
the local pathologist and was used for 
the study.
Data Collection
The Epidemiologic Cancer Registry of 
North Rhine–Westphalia receives all 
cancer case notifications electronically 
and stores all personal identifiers ex-
clusively as doubly encrypted data. For 
the study, encrypted personal identi-
fiers, extracted from the database of 
the screening units as documented with 
certified screening software (MaSc; KV-
IT GmbH, Dortmund and Duesseldorf, 
Germany), were transmitted for record 
linkage with in situ and invasive breast 
cancer cases in the Epidemiologic

pronounced than that for high-grade 
DCIS (OR = 1.11 per age group; P = 
.016). Despite an OR in the oldest age 
group that was significantly increased 
when compared with that in the youn-
gest women, low-grade DCIS demon-
strated no clear trend with increasing 
age because the detection rate was ac-
tually lower in the age range of 55–64 
The detection rate for intermediate-
grade DCIS was, relative to the youn-
gest age group, significantly increased 
among those 60–64 years of age 
(OR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.96; P = 
.006) and less so in the oldest women 
(OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.73; P = 
.06); thus, the increase in interme-
diate-grade DCIS with age was less 
consistently the lowest in each age 
group (Table 2).
Of note, the detection rate of 
high-grade DCIS increased signifi-
cantly across the four age groups (OR 
= 1.18 per age group; P , .0001), and 
the OR for the oldest group as com-
pared with the youngest group was 
1.68 (95% CI: 1.30, 2.16; P , .001).

Weigel et al
DCIS of low grade (11). The detection 
rate for intermediate-grade DCIS was 
higher (0.53‰) than that for low-grade 
DCIS (0.25‰), while the increase with 
age was less consistent because of a 
higher detection rate in the age group 
of 60–64 years (0.66‰) and a decrease 
with older age (0.58‰). Therefore, 
the potential benefit of preventing ag-
gressive invasive breast cancer through 
the diagnosis of a non–low-grade in 
situ lesion by means of digital mam-
mography screening and subsequent 
treatment appears to apply significantly 
more frequently to older women than 
to younger women who are eligible for 
mammography screening. High-grade 
lesions are more likely than low-grade 
lesions to lead to symptoms during a 
patient’s remaining lifetime, even in 
older population groups.
Delayed cancer detection at an ad-
vanced invasive stage would increase 
the probability of needing more aggres-
sive therapy than that recommended 
for DCIS, including chemotherapeutic 
concepts. The benefits of screening in 
terms of health-related quality of life 
are not yet available to provide reliable 
quantitative estimates (15) but are of 
interest for investigations in the future.
The association between mammog-
raphy screening and overdiagnosis has 
been demonstrated consistently across 
studies. The estimates vary greatly ac-
cording to the method used, the source 
of the data, and the definition (15). In 
randomized controlled studies, the best 
estimate for overdiagnosis for a popula-
tion invited to be screened is 11%, ac-
cording to a publication of the United 
Kingdom panel on breast cancer screen-
ing (16). The most plausible estimates 
of overdiagnosis related to observation 
studies range from 1% to 10% as a per-
centage of the expected incidence in the 
absence of screening (17). The trend 
of increasing DCIS detection rates with 
age raise the question of whether there 
might be a further increasing trend be-
yond the upper screening limit of 69 
years. The balance between benefits 
and harms of mammography screening 
programs for women aged 70–75 years, 
particularly with respect to overdiagno-
sis, remains uncertain (15).
(1.01 per 1000 women) than from age 
60 to 69 (1.50 per 1000 women) (5). 
In accordance with these observations, 
we found a detection rate of 1.18 per 
1000 women screened (472 of 398 
767 
women) from age 50 to 59 and 1.54 per 
1000 women screened (517 of 335 
138 
women) from age 60 to 69. These re-
sults are in line with a study from the 
U.S. National Cancer Institute, in which 
it was reported that the rate of DCIS 
cases detected at screening increases 
statistically significantly with age (14).
To our knowledge, no previous in-
vestigators evaluated the detection 
rates of DCIS in screening programs 
with respect to the age of women and 
the different nuclear grades of DCIS. 
DCIS detection separated by grades 
is highest in the oldest age group of 
65 to 69 years, comprising the high-
grade subtype (0.79‰ detection rate). 
High-grade DCIS detection decreases 
in younger age groups and is lowest in 
the youngest age group of 50–54 years 
(0.47‰ detection rate). The high-
grade subtype is supposed to carry a 
higher risk for invasive transition than 
the low-grade subtype; additionally, 
high-grade DCIS is assumed to progress 
to more aggressive invasive breast can-
cers of higher grades compared with 
years than in the youngest women 
 
(P = .10) (Table 2, Figure).
Discussion
In this study of women aged 50–69 
years, we demonstrated that detec-
tion rates for all DCIS types in a digital 
mammography screening program in-
crease with age. This increase is related 
to a significantly more pronounced in-
crease with age for high-grade DCIS 
than for intermediate-grade DCIS and 
low-grade DCIS.
Our results support those of pre-
vious studies in which an association 
is described between DCIS detection 
and age. The age-specific screening 
results from the Breast Cancer Sur-
veillance 
Consortium 
showed 
out-
comes of screening-detected DCIS per 
screening round of 0.8, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 
and 1.5 per 1000 women for the age 
groups of 40–49 years, 50–59 years, 
60–69 years, 70–79 years, and 80–89 
years, respectively (13). In our study, 
the proportion of DCIS was comparable 
to that in other pooled results of initial 
screening (17% vs 18%) (5); data ob-
tained from 12 countries indicated that 
the overall DCIS detection rate in initial 
screening was lower from age 50 to 59

Third, data involving breast density at 
mammography were not available for 
evaluation, and this might be a con-
founding factor. However, about 92% of 
all cases of DCIS detected with digital 
mammography screening are associ-
ated with calcifications as a mammo-
graphic abnormality (20), which has 
been reported to be poorly correlated 
with breast density (21). Recent results 
seem to confirm that breast density at 
mammography is an important risk fac-
tor for all types of breast cancer and 
that it strongly increases the risk of de-
veloping an interval tumor, while this 
excess risk is not completely explained 
by a possible masking effect (22). The 
influence of increased fatty breast tis-
sue in older patients would probably 
lead to an increased detection rate for 
all DCIS types, but it does not account 
for the specific increase observed for 
high-grade DCIS in this study.
In conclusion, total DCIS detection 
rates increase with 5-year age groups 
in women aged 50–69 years. This is 
mostly due to an increase in DCIS de-
tection rates for high- and intermedi-
ate-grade DCIS, which are precursor 
lesions that carry a higher risk for in-
vasive transition and for progression to 
more aggressive types of invasive breast 
cancers than low-grade DCIS.

The strengths of our study are that 
prospectively documented screening 
data are gained in a clearly defined 
setting with validated protocols for all 
steps in the screening process, including 
individual invitation of the target popu-
lation, quality assurance of screening 
and assessment procedures, dedicated 
training and supervision of pathologists, 
and combining information from notifi-
cations submitted to the cancer regis-
try by statewide clinical and pathology 
sources. None of the data used in this 
analysis were reassessed for the study 
purpose. The cancer registry was re-
cently able to provide the nuclear grade 
of DCIS postsurgically, in combination 
with age of the women, with a low rate 
of missing values (6.3%). The use of 
postsurgical histologic findings is essen-
tial because presurgical histologic find-
ings of DCIS that are based on minimal 
invasive biopsy samples may lead to un-
derestimation of invasive components 
(18). Furthermore, data were obtained 
only for the baseline screening exam-
inations of the statewide implementa-
tion phase of the program. Therefore, 
a shift toward younger age groups, 
commonly confounding the initial ex-
aminations in an ongoing program, was 
avoided (12). There had been no prior 
organized screening program in the 
population, which prevented a selec-
tion of diagnoses by means of previous 
screening examinations performed with 
analog technique, for example.
Our study has limitations. First, the 
available data comprise only the most 
relevant prognostic factor of DCIS, the 
nuclear grading. Other prognostic fac-
tors, such as comedonecrosis or lesion 
size, were not available (12). It is known 
that levels of concordance between pa-
thologists for DCIS and atypia are lower 
than those for invasive cancers (19). 
Therefore, despite dedicated training, 
defined volumes of histologic assess-
ments, and an established supervision 
process within the screening program, 
differences between pathologists might 
exist in terms of the quality and accu-
racy of DCIS assessment. Second, our 
study results from first-time screening 
examinations are probably not transfer-
able to subsequent screening rounds.
