IMPORTANCE Rising incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is straining perinatal
care systems. Newborns with NAS traditionally receive care in neonatal intensive care units
(NICUs), but rooming-in with mother and family has been proposed to reduce the use of
pharmacotherapy, length of stay (LOS), and cost.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze if rooming-in is associated with
improved outcomes for newborns with NAS.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched
from inception through June 25, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION This investigation included randomized clinical trials, cohort studies,
quasi-experimental studies, and before-and-after quality improvement investigations
comparing rooming-in vs standard NICU care for newborns with NAS.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent investigators reviewed studies for
inclusion. A random-effects model was used to pool dichotomous outcomes using risk ratio
(RR) and 95% CI. The study evaluated continuous outcomes using weighted mean difference
(WMD) and 95% CI.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was newborn treatment with
pharmacotherapy. Secondary outcomes included LOS, inpatient cost, and harms from
treatment, including in-hospital adverse events and readmission rates.
RESULTS Of 413 publications, 6 studies (n = 549 [number of patients]) met inclusion criteria.
In meta-analysis of 6 studies, there was consistent evidence that rooming-in is preferable to
NICU care for reducing both the use of pharmacotherapy (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71;
I2 = 85%) and LOS (WMD, −10.41 days; 95% CI, −16.84 to −3.98 days; I2 = 91%). Sensitivity
analysis resolved the heterogeneity for the use of pharmacotherapy, significantly favoring
rooming-in (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.57; I2 = 13%). Three studies reported that inpatient
costs were lower with rooming-in; however, significant heterogeneity precluded quantitative
analysis. Qualitative analysis favored rooming-in over NICU care for increasing breastfeeding
rates and discharge home in familial custody, but few studies reported on these outcomes.
Rooming-in was not associated with higher rates of readmission or in-hospital adverse
events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Opioid-exposed newborns rooming-in with mother or other
family members appear to be significantly less likely to be treated with pharmacotherapy and
have substantial reductions in LOS compared with those cared for in NICUs. Rooming-in
should be recommended as a preferred inpatient care model for NAS.

 N
eonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a collection of
signsandsymptomsofnewbornopioidwithdrawalaf-
ter intrauterine exposure.1 Other descriptions of the
syndrome include neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and
neonatal withdrawal syndrome.2 Neonatal abstinence syn-
drome manifests 24 to 96 hours after delivery with increased
muscle tone, tremors, sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, and other
symptoms. Between 1999 and 2013, the incidence of NAS in
the United States increased from 1.5 to 6.0 cases per 1000
births,3 with a mean cost in 2012 of $93 400 per newborn stay.4
While standardized approaches to pharmacologic treat-
ment of NAS improve outcomes, the role of nonpharmaco-
logicor“environmental”interventionsinmanagingNASisless
clear.5Opioid-exposednewbornsaretypicallycaredforinneo-
natal intensive care units (NICUs), and standardized scoring
systems, such as the modified Finnegan system, are used to
quantify NAS symptoms and to adjust medications used in
treatment.6 Paradoxically, studies6,7 have found that opioid-
exposed newborns in NICUs experience more severe with-
drawal, longer length of stay (LOS), and increased pharmaco-
therapy compared with newborns who room in. In rooming-in
care, infant and mother remain together 24 hours a day un-
less separation is indicated for medical reasons or safety
concerns.8 More maternal time at the infant bedside im-
proves NAS outcomes but is harder to accomplish in a typical
NICU.9 Neonatal intensive care units may be poor settings for
newborns with NAS because of increased sensitivity to high
clinical activity levels.10 In settings where separation from
mothers is inherent in a NICU admission, it can interfere with
bonding and may contribute to maternal perceptions of guilt
and stigma.9-11 While rooming-in may be effective for NAS, po-
tential risks include unintentional suffocation, falling from an
adult bed, or undertreated NAS after hospital discharge.10-12
The benefits and harms of rooming-in for NAS have to date
only been evaluated by single-center studies. We conducted
a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the ben-
efits and harms of rooming-in compared with standard NICU
care for management of NAS.
Methods
Review Protocol
WeusedPreferredReportingItemsforSystematicReviewsand
Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting of methods
andfindings(Figure1).13Weincludedrandomizedclinicaltrials,
cohort studies, quasi-experimental studies, and before-and-
after quality improvement (QI) investigations of rooming-in as
an intervention for opioid-exposed newborns. Prenatal opi-
oid exposure comprised maternal use of heroin, prescription
opioids, and nonprescription opioids, as well as prescribed or
illicit opioid replacement therapy. Polysubstance users were
not excluded. We defined rooming-in as infant and mother re-
maining together 24 hours per day throughout the postpar-
tum hospital stay unless separation was indicated for medi-
cal needs other than NAS symptoms. We included studies
reporting on other cointerventions, such as increased skin-to-
skin contact, swaddling, soothing, and breastfeeding sup-
port, because greater parental involvement in infant sooth-
ing is the primary plausible mechanism for rooming-in
efficacy.14,15 We required reporting on at least the primary out-
come of interest. Our systematic review protocol and search
methods are available in the eMethods in the Supplement.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the proportion of infants requiring
pharmacologictreatment.Currenttreatmentguidelinescallfor
the use of oral morphine sulfate or methadone hydrochloride
to relieve moderate or severe NAS symptoms.5 Therefore, the
proportion of pharmacologically treated newborns was used
as an adequate proxy for those with significant NAS.5 As sec-
ondary outcomes, we assessed the cumulative dose of opioid
medication,durationofopioidtreatmentcourse,LOS,totalcost
of hospitalization, family satisfaction, breastfeeding inci-
dence, and the proportion of infants discharged home in fa-
milial custody. To evaluate potential harms of rooming-in, we
examined reports of adverse events and readmission rates.16
Search Strategy, Study Selection, and Data Collection
We searched MEDLINE (1946 to June 25, 2017), CINAHL (1981-
2016), and The Cochrane Library using keywords and Medi-
cal Subject Headings to generate sets for the themes of NAS
and rooming-in. We used the Boolean term “AND” to find in-
tersections. No limits were applied. In addition, we searched
clinicaltrials.gov,reviewedreferencesofincludedstudiesmeet-
ing inclusion criteria, and used the expertise of one of us
(A.V.H.) in the field of NAS to identify any unpublished stud-
ies not identified by our principal electronic database search
strategy. Complete search strategies for each database are in-
cludedintheeMethodsintheSupplement.Twoofus(K.D.L.M.
and C.P.R.) independently screened titles and abstracts. Af-
ter the initial screening, these 2 authors independently as-
sessed selected full texts to determine appropriateness for in-
clusion. They then independently used a standardized, piloted
data collection form to extract data on key study compo-
nents, including methods, participant characteristics, out-
comes, and assessment techniques. Two independent review-
ers (2 of us, K.V. and D.B.W.) then applied the Risk of Bias in
Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool17 to
each study. Studies were defined as having low risk of bias if
Key Points
Question Does rooming-in with family reduce the use of
medications, length of stay, and costs in the inpatient treatment of
neonatal abstinence syndrome?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 studies
comprising 549 patients, rooming-in was associated with a
reduction in the need for pharmacologic treatment and a shorter
hospital stay when rooming-in was compared with standard
neonatal intensive care unit admission for neonatal abstinence
syndrome.
Meaning Rooming-in should be considered as the preferred
inpatient care model for all opioid-exposed newborns, including
those with neonatal abstinence syndrome.

 the 2 independent reviewers rated the study as such across all
categories. The results of our quality assessment were incor-
porated into the described sensitivity analysis. Discrepancies
at each stage were resolved by consensus.

qualitativesummaryforthissubsetofoutcomesacrossstudies.
Of the included publications, 3 studies7,18,19 provided in-
sufficient data to allow for quantitative analysis. We con-
tacted the respective authors and received responses from 2,
allowing us to analyze the need for pharmacotherapy and LOS
from these 2 studies.18,19 The third study7 was included in the
systematic review but was excluded from the portion of the
analysis associated with the missing data.
We used a software program (RevMan, version 5.3; The
Cochrane Collaboration20) to conduct the meta-analysis using
arandom-effectsmodelbypoolingstudyresultsforalloutcomes
to appropriately address expected heterogeneity. In the case of

First,welimitedthesummaryestimatestothebefore-and-after

et al24 owing to high risk of bias in selection of participants (ie,
motherswereencouragedtochoosetheinterventionratherthan
systematically applying rooming-in to the entire population of
interest). We then excluded 2 QI studies, by Holmes et al18 and
by Grossman et al,19 because during the implementation phase
of the rooming-in intervention there were concurrent changes
in how NAS scores affected the use of pharmacotherapy.
For the outcomes not amenable to quantitative analysis,

or neither group or as unclear. Statistical significance was de-
termined using P values calculated by 2-sided t tests.
Results
The initial search identified 482 potentially eligible studies. Af-
ter removing duplicates, we screened 413 studies and ex-
cluded 400 based on title and abstract. We performed full-
text review of 13 publications, and 6 studies7,18,19,22-24 (n = 549
[number of patients]) met our inclusion criteria (Figure 1 and
Table).Theincludedstudieswerepublishedbetween2007and
2017 and were varied in sample size, geographic location, and
clinical setting. In 3 included studies,7,19,22 all infants in the
comparison group were admitted to the NICU for increased ob-
servation. In the remaining 3 studies,18,23,24 only infants in the
comparison group who needed increased observation or phar-
macologic intervention were transferred to NICU-level care.
The reasons for exclusion of 7 studies after full-text review in-
cluded overlapping populations across studies, institutional
practices that limited pharmacologic treatment during the ini-
tial 36 to 72 hours of life, or insufficient data on rooming-in.

Need for Pharmacotherapy
All6studiesfoundthatrooming-inwasassociatedwithalower
proportion of infants requiring pharmacotherapy compared
with standard NICU care (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71). How-
ever, there was significant heterogeneity among the included
studies (I2 = 85%). After removing 3 studies for simultane-
ously using multiple interventions18,19 or for allowing mater-
nal group selection,24 the heterogeneity resolved, and room-
ing-in continued to be significantly favored (RR, 0.32; 95% CI,
0.18-0.57) (I2 = 13%) (Figure 2).
In the first sensitivity analysis, we examined the value of
using a historical internal control group (vs an external con-
trol) for the study by Abrahams et al.7 This resulted in an un-
changed RR of 0.37. In our second sensitivity analysis, we lim-
ited the investigation to 4 before-and-after studies.18,19,22,23
This resulted in an RR of 0.28, with significant heterogeneity
(I2 = 62%). In our third sensitivity analysis, we removed the
2 QI studies.18,19 This resulted in an RR of 0.35, with an I2 of
81%. Finally, we removed the QI studies18,19 and the study by
Hünseler et al.24 This resulted in an RR of 0.32, with an I2 of
13%. All sensitivity analyses demonstrated an association be-
tween rooming-in as an intervention and limiting pharmaco-
therapy, with statistically significant RRs between 0.27 and
0.37.
Length of Stay
All 6 studies found that LOS was significantly shorter with
rooming-in vs standard NICU care (WMD, −10.41 days; 95% CI,
−16.84 to −3.98 days). However, there was again significant
heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 91%). After re-
moving 3 studies18,19,24 for the same reasons related to study
design noted above (see the Need for Pharmacotherapy sub-
sectioninthisResultssection),theheterogeneityresolved,and
rooming-in continued to be favored (WMD, −12.84 days; 95%
CI, −20.02 to −5.67 days) (I2 = 58%) (Figure 3).
In the first sensitivity analysis on LOS, we examined the
value of using the historical internal control group (vs the ex-
ternal control) in the study by Abrahams et al7 and found an
unchanged LOS (WMD, −10.41 days). In the second sensitiv-
ity analysis, we limited our investigation to 4 before-
and-after studies.18,19,22,23 This resulted in a WMD of −10.84
days,withsignificantheterogeneity(I2 = 95%).Inthethirdsen-
sitivity analysis, we removed the 2 QI studies.18,19 This re-
sulted in a WMD of −10.86, with significant heterogeneity
(I2 = 65%).Finally,weremovedtheQIstudies18,19andthestudy
byHünseleretal.24ThisresultedinaWMDof−12.84days,with
an I2 of 58%. All sensitivity analyses demonstrated a strong as-
sociation between rooming-in as an intervention and short-
ening LOS by approximately 10 to 12 days.
Sensitivity analyses conducted based on each element of
the ROBINS-I methodological quality assessment tool showed
no significant association with the need for pharmaco-
therapy. Similar results were found for length of stay.

 lower costs (eTable 2 in the Supplement). However, there
was significant heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 97%),
which precluded a formal meta-analysis.
Qualitative Analysis
None of the included studies reported any adverse events
with rooming-in. Three studies7,18,23 reported on readmis-
sion rates, with no increase found (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). Four studies7,19,22,23 reported on breastfeeding,
with 2 studies noting an increase in breastfeeding with
rooming-in and 2 studies reporting no difference (eTable 4
in the Supplement). Four studies7,18,23,24 reported on
discharge home with mother or other family member;
only one study7 showed a larger proportion of rooming-in
infants remaining in familial custody. The remaining
3 studies18,23,24 all reported high rates of discharge
with family, with no statistically significant difference in
rates between study groups (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Three studies7,23,24 reported on the mean length of opi-
oid medication treatment, all of which identified a decrease
in the number of days receiving pharmacotherapy, propor-
tionate to the decrease in LOS seen above (see the Length
of Stay subsection herein). Only one study18 reported
on changes in the cumulative dose of opioid medication,
and no included studies reported on patient satisfaction.
We were unable to conduct a formal assessment for
publication bias due to inclusion of only 6 studies in the
meta-analysis.25
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that
rooming-in is associated with decreased need for pharmaco-
logic treatment of NAS and shorter LOS. The results of several
included studies18,19,24 suggest that rooming-in is associated
with reduced hospital costs, but the significant heteroge-
neity across studies precluded quantitative analysis. Because
of variable reporting, we were unable to draw formal conclu-
sions about the role of rooming-in on other secondary out-
comes of interest. The findings of 2 studies7,19 suggested that
breastfeeding increases with rooming-in. There was no evi-
dence that rooming-in for NAS was associated with a signifi-
cant increase in hospital readmission. Reporting of adverse
events was insufficient to draw any conclusions about an as-
sociation between rooming-in and these outcomes. Our find-
ings agree with prior review articles14,26,27 of nonpharmaco-
logic management of NAS, which also suggested that
rooming-in is associated with decreased NAS severity and
shorter LOS.
Our systematic review included studies from the United
States, Canada, and Europe and covered a range of clinical set-
tings. Therefore, rooming-in could be effective in diverse
settings that manage neonates at risk for NAS. Our findings are
relevant to current practice because implementing room-
ing-in for opioid-exposed newborns is straightforward and has
clear benefits. It allows for greater parental involvement by in-

Thequalityoftheincludedstudieswashigh,andtheresults
were consistent across them. Because most of the studies used
a historical cohort, it is important to consider the observed
resultsinlightofseculartrends.Studiesthatincludedaconcur-
rentexternalcontrolgroupalsofavoredrooming-inanddemon-
strated no significant change in the findings. The risk for ascer-
tainment bias in studies was low because the included studies
usedstandardizeddefinitionsforrooming-inandthestudiedout-

tions,LOS,andtotalcost).However,rooming-inisnotanisolated

Strengths and Limitations
Thisstudyhasanumberofstrengths,includingstrictadherence
to The Cochrane Library and PRISMA guidelines for systematic
reviewandmeta-analysisconductandreporting.Weusedacom-
prehensivesearchstrategythatincludedmultipleelectronicda-
tabasesandadditionaltechniquestoidentifyunpublishedstud-
ies. Because rooming-in is a recent intervention for NAS, there
is limited available literature. We believe that our search strat-
egy comprehensively synthesized the available data.
First among the limitations of this systematic review and
meta-analysis is the likely publication bias favoring rooming-
in because it would be unlikely for researchers to publish their
results with negative or insignificant findings. This is particu-
larly concerning for QI studies because negative QI interven-
tions are rarely published.25,28 We were unable to formally as-
sess publication bias due to analyzing less than 10 studies.25
Second, to comprehensively identify negative or insignificant
outcomes,weincorporatedallreportedoutcomemeasuresfrom
each study, regardless of whether the measure was the inter-
ventiontarget.Theincludedstudiesmayhavelackedsufficient
power to fully evaluate secondary outcomes. Third, there was
variable reporting of the secondary outcomes of this system-
atic review and meta-analysis across the included studies, par-
ticularlyregardingadverseeventsandreadmissionrates.While
theincludedstudies7,18,23measuringreadmissiondemonstrated
noincreaseamongroomed-ininfants,theseeventsarerare,and
it is possible that investigations lacked sufficient power to de-
tectpotentialnegativeconsequencesofrooming-in.Fourth,we
encounteredsignificantheterogeneityamongtheincludedstud-
ies for the primary and secondary outcomes. This was antici-
pated given the varied nature of the study designs and settings
and was particularly exacerbated by inclusion of 2 large QI
studies18,19thatbyvirtueoftheirmethodsincorporatedseveral

 methodological issues in our sensitivity analysis, we were able
to resolve the heterogeneity for our primary outcome, and
rooming-in continued to show a statistically significant benefit
over standard NICU care. The results of this systematic review
and meta-analysis should be interpreted with careful consid-
eration of the validity of the final estimations of intervention
effect size.
As rooming-in interventions are implemented across a
growing number of institutions, it will be important to moni-
tor for potential adverse events of rooming-in, such as failure
to thrive, accidental suffocation, and readmission rates. It will
also be necessary to determine an association between room-
ing-in and breastfeeding and custody arrangements at dis-
charge. While there is emerging evidence to suggest that room-
ing-in may also be associated with lower hospital costs, future
studies should evaluate this in a systematic and standardized
manner, allowing for adequate comparison across studies. Fi-
nally, future research should explore the possible long-term
implications of rooming-in for infant health and develop-
ment, strength of the mother-child bond, and potential to miti-
gate the risk of maternal relapse into active substance abuse.
Conclusions
There is consistent evidence supporting rooming-in as an ef-
fective strategy for managing NAS by reducing the need for
pharmacotherapy and decreasing LOS. This systematic re-
view and meta-analysis of the current literature demon-
strates compelling data for rooming-in as beneficial for new-
bornswithNASoratriskforNAS.Inclinicalcaresettingswhere
it is safe and feasible, we recommend that rooming-in be con-
sidered as a preferred management strategy for opioid-
exposed newborns and for newborns with NAS.
