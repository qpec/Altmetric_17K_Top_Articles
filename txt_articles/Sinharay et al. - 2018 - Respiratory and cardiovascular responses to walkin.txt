Summary 
Background Long-term exposure to pollution can lead to an increase in the rate of decline of lung function, especially 
in older individuals and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas shorter-term 
exposure at higher pollution levels has been implicated in causing excess deaths from ischaemic heart disease and 
exacerbations of COPD. We aimed to assess the effects on respiratory and cardiovascular responses of walking 
down a busy street with high levels of pollution compared with walking in a traffic-free area with lower pollution 
levels in older adults. 
Methods In this randomised, crossover study, we recruited men and women aged 60 years and older with 
angiographically proven stable ischaemic heart disease or stage 2 Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease 
(GOLD) COPD who had been clinically stable for 6 months, and age-matched healthy volunteers. Individuals with 
ischaemic heart disease or COPD were recruited from existing databases or outpatient respiratory and cardiology 
clinics at the Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and age-matched healthy volunteers using 
advertising and existing databases. All participants had abstained from smoking for at least 12 months and medications 
were taken as recommended by participants’ doctors during the study. Participants were randomly assigned by 
drawing numbered disks at random from a bag to do a 2 h walk either along a commercial street in London 
(Oxford Street) or in an urban park (Hyde Park). Baseline measurements of participants were taken before the walk 
in the hospital laboratory. During each walk session, black carbon, particulate matter (PM) concentrations, ultrafine 
particles, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations were measured.
Findings Between October, 2012, and June, 2014, we screened 135 participants, of whom 40 healthy volunteers, 
40 individuals with COPD, and 39 with ischaemic heart disease were recruited. Concentrations of black carbon, 
NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and ultrafine particles were higher on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park. Participants with COPD 
reported more cough (odds ratio [OR] 1·95, 95% CI 0·96–3·95; p<0·1), sputum (3·15, 1·39–7·13; p<0·05), 
shortness of breath (1·86, 0·97–3·57; p<0·1), and wheeze (4·00, 1·52–10·50; p<0·05) after walking down 
Oxford Street compared with Hyde Park. In all participants, irrespective of their disease status, walking in 
Hyde Park led to an increase in lung function (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] and forced vital 
capacity [FVC]) and a decrease in pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index up to 26 h after the walk. By 
contrast, these beneficial responses were attenuated after walking on Oxford Street. In participants with COPD, a 
reduction in FEV1 and FVC, and an increase in R5–20 were associated with an increase in during-walk exposure to 
NO2, ultrafine particles and PM2.5, and an increase in PWV and augmentation index with NO2 and ultrafine 
particles. In healthy volunteers, PWV and augmentation index were associated both with black carbon and 
ultrafine particles. 
Interpretation Short-term exposure to traffic pollution prevents the beneficial cardiopulmonary effects of walking in 
people with COPD, ischaemic heart disease, and those free from chronic cardiopulmonary diseases. Medication use 
might reduce the adverse effects of air pollution in individuals with ischaemic heart disease. Policies should aim to 
control ambient levels of air pollution along busy streets in view of these negative health effects.

Introduction
Air pollution currently represents one of the world’s 
most important environmental health risks and has 
been associated with an increase in premature deaths, 
mostly caused by ischaemic heart disease and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).1 Air pollution 
caused by emissions from diesel-powered vehicles and 
from tyres and brakes of motor vehicles comprises of 
particulate matter (PM) such as PM10, PM2.5, and ultrafine 
particles (PM with a diameter ≤10 µm, 2·5 µm and 
0·1 µm, respectively) and noxious gases such as nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2). These individual pollutants or their 
mixture have been associated with increasing early 
deaths and deleterious respiratory and cardiovascular 
events.2-5 Long-term exposure to pollution over years can 
lead to an increase in the rate of decline of lung function 
in non-smoking adults, particularly in the elderly6,7 and 
in individuals with COPD.8,9 Short term exposure over 
days to higher pollution levels has been associated with 
increased exacerbations and hospital admissions with a 
reduction in lung function in patients with COPD10–12 
and has also been implicated in triggering acute episodes 
of cardiac ischaemia and in causing excess deaths from 
ischaemic heart disease.13
Exposure of healthy exercising individuals to re-
constituted diesel exhaust particles causes an acute 
bronchoconstrictor response with increased arterial 
stiffness 
and 
pulmonary 
inflammation.14–17 
Indeed, 
findings of studies have shown that exposure to diesel 
exhaust causes an immediate and transient increase in 
arterial stiffness in healthy volunteers.14,18 Further, acute 
myocardial ischaemia measured by ST-segment depression 
has been reported in individuals with ischaemic heart 
disease exposed to diesel exhaust particles in exposure 
chambers.19 In one study,20 exposure of individuals with 
asthma to high levels of diesel vehicle pollution while 
walking on a busy commercial street (Oxford Street) in 
London, UK, led to a fall in forced expiratory volume in the 
first second (FEV1) and pulmonary inflammation.
Because of the paucity of information on the effect 
of air pollution on participants with COPD and 
ischaemic heart disease, we aimed to assess the effects 
on respiratory and cardiovascular responses of a short-
term exposure to traffic pollution during a 2-h walk in a 
busy London street compared with those in a nearby park 
with lower pollution levels.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this randomised, crossover study, we recruited healthy 
volunteers using advertising in public areas within the 
Royal Brompton Hospital, and individuals with COPD or 
ischaemic heart disease from existing databases or 
outpatient respiratory and cardiology clinics at the Royal 
Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust (table). To 
be eligible, individuals with COPD had to be aged 60 years 
and older with Global initiative for Obstructive Lung 
Disease (GOLD) stage 2 disease with an FEV1 to forced 
vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 0·7 and a predicted 
FEV1 of 80% or less. Individuals with ischaemic heart 
disease had to have angiographic evidence of ischaemic 
heart disease. Healthy volunteers and participants with 
ischaemic heart disease had to show no evidence of 
airflow obstruction. All participants had abstained from 
smoking for at least 12 months. Patients with COPD or 
ischaemic heart disease had been clinically stable for 
Research in context
Evidence before study
We searched PubMed without language restriction for reports 
published up to July, 2017, using the following search terms: “air 
pollution”, “particulate matter”, “diesel exhaust”, “exercise”, 
“walking”, and “physical activity”, in addition to the terms “COPD” 
and “ischaemic heart disease”. We found no studies that have 
examined the effect of walking in a polluted area on cardiovascular 
and respiratory responses. Most of the reports analysed the effect 
of submaximal exercise, usually cycling or running, in relatively 
young volunteers. No studies have looked at the effect of walking 
at a normal pace, apart from our own study in a group of 
asthmatic participants (McCreanor et al, 2007). The effect of 
exercising in participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) or ischaemic heart disease in polluted areas has not 
been studied, apart from one study by Superko et al (1984) that 
looked at COPD participants during brisk walking on a treadmill.
Added value of study
Our findings show for the first time the detrimental effect of air 
pollution on walking at a normal pace. We document the 
beneficial cardiorespiratory benefits of walking in healthy 
volunteers aged 60 years and older, an effect that is lost when 
walking in a polluted environment. Our results show that this 
similar phenomenon is happening in participants with COPD 
and ischaemic heart disease, although the cardiac medication 
taken by the ischaemic heart disease participants might be 
protecting them against the detrimental cardiovascular effects 
of air pollution. 
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings suggest that healthy people, as well as those with 
chronic cardiorespiratory disorders, should minimise walking 
on streets with high levels of pollution because this curtails or 
even reverses the cardiorespiratory benefits of exercise. Instead, 
walking exercise should be enjoyed in urban green space areas 
away from high density traffic. Patients with chronic 
cardiorespiratory disorders should be encouraged to use 
appropriate medication to mitigate the adverse effects of air 
pollution. Current ambient levels of air pollution along busy 
streets are unacceptable and need to be controlled.

6 months, without any deterioration in symptoms or 
episodes of angina for participants with ischaemic heart 
disease. Medications were taken as recommended by 
participants’ doctors during the study.
The experimental sites in London were the western 
end of Oxford Street where traffic is restricted to buses 
and taxicabs, most of which are powered by diesel, and 
the nearby, traffic-free part of Hyde Park.20 Participants 
were randomly assigned to start on either site by drawing 
numbered disks at random from a bag on the day before 
the first walk, with participants informed of the starting 
site only on the day of the walk. Participants were 
transported to each site from the hospital laboratory 
3 km away in a hybrid electric-powered car. Participants 
walked from 11 am to 1 pm at their own pace, covering an 
average distance of 5 km on both sites. The walks were 
separated by 3–8 weeks.
The study was approved by the UK National Research 
Ethics Service (London City Road and Hampstead Ethics 
Committee; Research Ethics Number 12/LO/1064). 
Informed written consent was obtained from all 
participants.
Health outcome measures
Baseline measurements were taken before the walk in 
the hospital laboratory of the Royal Brompton & Harefield 
NHS Foundation Trust. Figure 1 shows the time course 
of health outcome measurements. Shortness of breath 
was measured using a modified Medical Research 
Council dyspnea scale, while cough, sputum, wheeze, 
and sweat were scored on a 0 to 4 scale. FEV1 and 
FVC were measured using a spirometer (Vitalograph, 
Buckingham, UK) and resistance of the respiratory tract 
at 5 and 20 Hz (R5 and R20) using impulse oscillo 
metry 
(Master 
Screen 
Spirometry-IOS 
System, 
Jaeger, 
Germany).21 Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) 
was assessed using a portable electrochemical sensor 
(NOBreath Bedfont Scientific Ltd, Kent, UK), and pulse 
wave velocity and augmentation index using a Vicorder 
(Skidmore Medical, Bristol, UK). Central aortic pulse 
wave velocity was defined as the ratio of pulse wave 
transit time and distance between the carotid and femoral 
arteries while augmentation index was the enhancement 
of the central aortic pressure by a reflected pulse wave, 
both being measures of arterial stiffness.
Exposure measures
During each walk session, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations 
were measured using a light scattering sensor (AM510 
SidePak Personal Aerosol Monitors, TSI Ltd, MI, USA). 
Ultrafine particles number concentrations were measured 
using a unipolar diffusion charger (Philips Aerosense 
NanoTracer; size range of 10–300 nm); and black carbon 
using an optical absorption method (microAeth Model 
AE51 Black Carbon aerosol monitor; AEthlabs, CA, USA; 
flow rate 100 mL per min). Temperature and relative 
humidity were electronically logged, as were noise levels 
(Bruel and Kjaer Type 2236 Sound level meter, Naerum, 
Denmark). NO2 concentrations were taken from a 
stationary monitoring site on Oxford Street repeatedly 
passed during walks on Oxford Street. Because no 
monitoring was available in Hyde Park, NO2 concen-
trations were taken from the nearest representative 
location sited in a school playground.

Statistical analysis
Power calculation was based on the augmentation index 
as a primary outcome, using previously-published data.14 
We used two-sided two-group t tests conducted at 
5% significance to compare the effect of exposure for 
all participants with disease (n=80) versus control 
participants (n=40) or participants with either COPD 
or ischaemic heart disease (n=40) versus control 
participants. The effect of exposure is the difference in 
response following Oxford Street versus Hyde Park, with 
the correlation between within-participant measurements 
being 0·7 and standard deviations the average of those of 
Lundbäck and colleagues.14 The minimum effect size of 
the augmentation index is detectable with at least 
90% power. The detectable effect size calculated as the 
minimum detectable difference between the two groups 
divided by the mean of the control group shows that the 
group with disease is 59% and 69% different from that of 
the control group for the 80 versus 40, and for the 
40 versus 40 comparisons, respectively, which represents 
a moderate size effect.
We applied hierarchical proportional odds analyses for 
the ordinal symptom responses, using PROC GLIMMIX 
in SAS (version 9.4) to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of 
getting worse symptoms. We entered time, group, 
location, and their interactions to estimate odds ratios, 
with a ran 
dom effect to control for repeated measures 
within participants. We controlled the pre-exposure status 
by entering the baseline level as a covariate.
We assessed the effects of exposure on health end 
points, 
measured as continuous variables, with linear mixed-
effects models using PROC MIXED (SAS version 9.4) that 
included absolute changes from baseline as dependent 
variables. Participant group (healthy, COPD, and 
ischaemic heart disease), location (Oxford Street vs Hyde 
Park), and time of measurement were categorical fixed 
effects. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were 
controlled as additional covariates. We controlled 
participant as a random effect to account for the variation 
of health endpoints between participants. We also 
introduced a covariance structure to model correlations 
between repeated measurements taken across time on the 
same day for each participant. The spatial power 
covariance 
structure 
was 
selected 
using 
Akaike 
information criterion because of its best fit compared with 
other covariance structures (eg, compound symmetry,

unstructured, and spatial power). The interactions 
between group, time, and location were included in the 
models to examine whether the exposure-related changes 
from baseline (post-session minus pre-session) on health 
endpoints differed between groups.
We studied associations between during-walk con-
centrations of each measured pollutant, including noise, 
and health endpoints, using mixed-effects models. In 
these models, each health endpoint was the dependent 
variable; and the 2 h average concentration or level of 
each pollutant and noise was the independent variable. 
Random-effects variables and structure were the same as 
described above on comparing exposure and control 
sessions. We report mean and 95% CIs of changes in 
each health endpoint associated with IQR changes in 
pollutant con 
centrations or noise levels. We only assessed 
the associations at the time points (relevant to the start of 
walk) when a significant site effect was recorded for a 
particular health endpoint.
We did a sensitivity analysis in ischaemic heart disease 
participants concerning the effect of medication use. The 
medication use status was controlled in the model as an 
interaction with time and group in the location analysis 
model, and with time and air pollution in the association 
analysis model. We also did a sensitivity analysis on the 
smoking history of the study participants. We included 
the participants’ pack-year of smoking (defined as pack of 
20 cigarettes smoked multiplied by number of years 
smoked) as an independent variable in the models to test 
its modifying effect on the changes between sites.

Results
Between October, 2012, and June, 2014, we screened 
135 participants, of whom 40 healthy volunteers, 
40 participants with COPD, and 39 with ischaemic heart 
disease were recruited. Baseline characteristics of 
participants are shown in the table. Concentrations of 
black carbon, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and ultrafine particles 
and noise level during the walk sessions were all 
significantly higher on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park 
(figure 2). There were no significant differences in 
temperature or relative humidity. The mean distance 
walked in 2 h was 4·78 km (SD 1·20) for Hyde Park, and 
4·62 km (1·01) for Oxford Street.
Participants with COPD reported significantly higher 
scores on cough (OR 1·95, 95% CI 0·96–3·95; p<0·1), 
sputum (3·15, 1·39–7·13; p<0·05), shortness of breath 
(1·86, 0·97–3·57; p<0·1), and wheeze (4·00, 1·52–10·50; 
p<0·05) after walking down Oxford Street compared 
with Hyde Park (figure 3). Participants with ischaemic 
heart disease reported significantly higher scores of 
cough after the Oxford Street walk versus the Hyde Park 
walk (OR 4·13, 95% CI 1·05–16·33; p<0·05). Healthy 
volunteers did not report any increase in symptoms of

cough, sputum, shortness of breath, wheeze, or sweat 
after the Oxford Street walk (figure 3).
In healthy volunteers, FEV1 increased within 1 h of 
walking in Hyde Park, maximal at 5 and 6 h with a mean 
7·6% rise (95% CI 5·1–10·2); this remained significantly 
increased by 3·6% (1·0–6·1) at 26 h (figure 4). Participants 
who walked along Oxford Street only had a small increase 
in FEV1, with a significantly lower improvement compared 
with walking in Hyde Park (figure 4A; appendix). In 
participants with COPD and ischaemic heart disease, there 
were similar increases in FEV1 while walking on Hyde 
Park and Oxford Street at 5 h after the start of the  walk, 
with the increase less than that observed by healthy 
volunteers in Hyde Park  by 3·3% (95% CI –0·9 to 7·5) 
and 4·6% (0·4 to 8·9) for COPD participants, and by 3·2% 
(0·5 to 5·8) and 4·1% (1·5 to 6·7) for ischaemic heart 
disease participants on Oxford Street and Hyde Park, 
respectively. At the 6 h timepoints, these values remained 
similar and were 3·2% (–1·0 to 7·4) and 4·4% (0·2 to 8·7) 
for COPD participants, and 4·4% (1·7 to 7·1) and 4·6% 
(2·0 to 7·2) for ischaemic heart disease participants on 
Oxford Street and Hyde Park, respectively. There were no 
significant differences in FEV1 observed between Oxford 
Street and Hyde Park in either the COPD or ischaemic 
heart disease group after the end of walk (figure 4A). 
In healthy volunteers, there was a significant 
improvement in FVC at 3 and 5 h after walking in 
Hyde Park by 3·07% (95% CI 0·41–5·73) and 4·36% 
(1·70–7·02), respectively; this was not the case after 
walking on Oxford Street at any timepoint from the 
baseline (figure 4B). There was an increase in FVC at 1, 3, 
and 5 h in participants with COPD and at 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 
26 h in participants with ischaemic heart disease during 
the Hyde Park walk; these values were higher than those 
measured during the Oxford Street walk at 1, 2, and 3 h, 
and 1, 5, and 26 h, respectively (figure 4B).
For the differential frequency-dependent respiratory 
resistance at 5 Hz and 20 Hz (R5 and R20), there were no 
significant site differences in changes at 4 or 26 h after 
walking in healthy volunteers and participants with 
ischaemic heart disease (figure 5). However, participants 
with COPD walking on Oxford Street showed a 
significant increase in R5 and R20 at 4 h compared with 
walking in Hyde Park. We calculated the differential 
frequency-dependent respiratory resistance at 5 Hz and 
20 Hz (R5–20) as reflecting small airways. R5–20 was 
significantly increased in participants with COPD at 
4 h after the start of the walk on Oxford Street compared 
with Hyde Park; this difference disappeared by 26 h 
(figure 5C).
Pulse wave velocity in healthy volunteers showed a 
reduction from the baseline by –5·31% (95% CI 
–10·40 to –0·27) after the Hyde Park walk at time 3 h and 
an increase from the baseline by 7·17% (2·16–12·20) after 
the Oxford Street walk at 26 h, with site difference 
reaching significance at 26 h (figure 6A; appendix; 
p=0·0007). Pulse wave velocity in participants with COPD 
or ischaemic heart disease showed similar trends after 
walks at both sites, but significant site-differences were 
seen at several timepoints (3, 5, 6, and 26 h for participants 
with COPD with p<0·04, and 3, 5, and 26 h for ischaemic 
heart disease with p<0·008).
In healthy volunteers, there was a significant reduction 
in augmentation index at all timepoints after the 
Hyde Park walk versus the Oxford Street walk with the 
largest reduction by –24·27% (95% CI –31·0 to –17·50) at 
3 h after the Hyde Park walk; but after Oxford Street, there 
were no significant changes in augmentation index with 
the largest reduction by –4·62% (–11·60 to 2·36) at 3 h 
after the Oxford Street walk (figure 6B; appendix). We 
noted similar trends in participants with COPD and 
ischaemic heart disease, but while the decrease in 
augmentation index after Hyde Park at 3 h was similar to 
that noted in healthy volunteers, the decrease at 3 h after

Hyde Park in participants with COPD and ischaemic 
heart disease was higher than that reported in healthy 
volunteers (figure 6). The change in augmentation index 
after Hyde Park was significantly greater than after 
Oxford Street at 3, 5, 6, and 26 h for participants with 
COPD with the largest reduction by –24·64% (95% CI 
–31·00 to –18·30) at 3 h after Hyde Park versus –16·16% 
(–22·90 to –9·47) after Oxford Street. For ischaemic 
heart patients, the largest reduction was by –19·75% 
(–26·50 to –13·00) at 3 h after Hyde Park versus –8·64% 
(–15·90 to –1·35) after Oxford Street (figure 6). Therefore, 
similar to the pulse wave velocity results, walking in 
Hyde Park led to a reduction (ie, an improvement) in 
augmentation index for all groups.
In all groups, we noted significant decreases in systolic 
blood pressure and increases in heart rate at 3 h from 
baseline, but there were no significant site differences 
apart from systolic blood pressure being lower at 5 h in 
COPD after walking down Oxford Street and higher at 
26 h in participants with ischaemic heart disease after 
Oxford Street, compared with after the Hyde Park walk 
(figure 6C, D). We recorded no significant differences in 
diastolic blood pressure after walks in Hyde Park or 
Oxford Street in the three groups.
In participants with COPD, a reduction in FEV1 and FVC 
at 3 h was significantly associated with increasing PM2.5, 
ultrafine particles, and NO2. A reduction in FVC was 
also significantly associated with increasing PM10 con-
centrations and noise levels (appendix). An increase in 
R5–20 at 4 h in participants with COPD was significantly 
associated with increasing PM2.5, black carbon, ultrafine 
particles and, NO2, and PM10 (appendix). By contrast, no 
significant associations for lung function parameters were 
recorded in healthy volunteers or participants with 
ischaemic heart disease (figure 7A, B).
In terms of associations between pollutant and noise 
and arterial stiffness parameters, an increase in pulse wave 
velocity was significantly associated with increasing black 
carbon and ultrafine particles in both healthy volunteers 
and individuals with COPD and with increasing noise in 
both healthy volunteers and those with ischaemic heart 
disease (appendix). We also found that an increase in 
augmentation index was significantly associated with 
increasing black carbon, ultrafine particles, and NO2 in 
both healthy volunteers and COPD but not in participants 
with ischaemic heart disease (figure 7C).
Sensitivity analyses of participants with ischaemic 
heart disease, stratified by medication use versus no medi-
cation use, showed that those who did not use oral 
medications had significantly attenuated reductions in 
pulse wave velocity and augmentation index after the 
Oxford Street walk compared with the reductions after the 
Hyde Park walk (figure 8). By contrast, participants with 
ischaemic heart disease who used medications did not 
show significant differences in pulse wave velocity 
and augmentation index changes after walks down 
Oxford Street or in Hyde Park.
We also did a sensitivity analysis by introducing an 
interaction term between medication use (table), site, and 
timepoints. The site effects on augmentation index were 
significantly different between the two groups (no 
medication or on medication) at 3 h and 26 h (p=0·042 
and 0·019, respectively), while no significant differences 
in site effects on pulse wave velocity were recorded. We

also tested whether medication modified the location 
effects on pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, 
assuming the modification effect was the same across all 
timepoints, and noted no significant interaction between 
location and medication for pulse wave velocity (p=0·718), 
but the interaction of location and medication for 
augmentation index was significant (p=0·005). The 
results were consistent with those of the three-way 
interaction, which allowed for medication to modify 
location effects differently by timepoint. In the stratified 
analyses of pollutant-endpoint associations, participants 
with ischaemic heart disease who did not use medication 
showed significant associations of pulse wave velocity 
with black carbon, NO2, and ultrafine particles, while 
those who used medication did not show such 
associations; however, this was not recorded with 
augmentation index (figure 8C).
We checked the effect of smoking history measured by 
the pack-years of smoking (number of 20 cigarette-packs 
smoked per day multiplied by years of smoking) on the 
changes of health outcomes between the two sites as an 
independent variable. We found no significant effects of 
smoking in the site analysis (p values ranging from 
0·093 to 0·984), such that smoking did not modify the 
site effects on the walk-induced changes in health 
outcomes (appendix).
Discussion
In healthy volunteers, walking for 2 h in a relatively less 
polluted urban park (Hyde Park) was associated with a 
bronchodilator response present up to 26 h, accompanied 
by a smaller increase in FVC sustained at 5 h, but with 
no changes in small airways function. By contrast, after 
walking in the more polluted commercial roadside 
(Oxford Street), there were no significant changes in FEV1 
or FVC from baseline, suggesting that pollutant exposures 
suppressed the walking-induced increase in FEV1. 
Both COPD and ischaemic heart disease participants 
experienced the beneficial effect of walking in both 
locations in terms of an improvement in FEV1, although 
this was less than that recorded in healthy volunteers. This 
is consistent with our findings on the significant 
associations between FEV1 and pollutant concentrations in 
participants with COPD. There was also an increase 
in small airways obstruction measured as R5–20 in 
association with pollutants in COPD participants but not 
in healthy and ischaemic heart disease participants. This 
greater effect of walking in a commercial roadside on lung 
function of participants with COPD was associated with 
more respiratory symptoms of cough and sputum, 
shortness of breath, and wheeze, while participants with 
ischaemic heart disease and the healthy volunteers were 
mostly asymptomatic walking on a commercial roadside 
except for increased cough in individuals with ischaemic 
heart disease.
The findings related to the cardiovascular parameters 
of pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, which 
are measures of arterial stiffness,22 are also of significant 
interest. In healthy participants, walking in Hyde Park 
led to a reduction in arterial stiffness that persisted up to 
26 h, a benefit that was not only lost but even reversed 
after walking on Oxford Street. Participants with COPD 
or ischaemic heart disease also exhibited a reduced pulse 
wave velocity after walking in Hyde Park but increased 
pulse wave velocity after walking on Oxford Street. 
All three groups showed reductions in augmentation

index following Hyde Park; and this beneficial change 
was significantly attenuated (even reversed at a few 
timepoints) after the Oxford Street walk. Moreover, we 
noted pollutant effects on pulse wave velocity and 
augmentation index mostly in participants with COPD 
and healthy volunteers but not in participants with 
ischaemic heart disease. This counter-intuitive finding 
could be due to the protective effect of the use of 
medications such as statins, angiotensin-converting-
enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers, which 
improve arterial stiffness.23–25 Sensitivity analyses of 
ischaemic heart disease participants, stratified by 
medication use versus no medication use, confirmed 
that only those who did not use medication had 
attenuated reductions in pulse wave velocity and 
augmentation index after the Oxford Street walk 
compared with those after Hyde Park walks. By contrast, 
participants with ischaemic heart disease who used 
medications did not show differences in pulse wave 
velocity and augmentation index changes between the 
Oxford Street and the Hyde Park walks. The stratified 
analyses of pollutant associations showed significant 
associations of pulse wave velocity, but not augmentation 
index, with components of pollution, supporting a 
protective effect of cardiovascular medication.
While there was no association of pollutants with 
spirometric measurements in healthy and ischaemic 
heart disease participants, the fall in FEV1 and FVC was 
related to changes in noise, black carbon, and ultrafine 
particles. These results are in agreement with our 
previous asthma study where the reductions in FEV1 and 
FVC were associated with ultrafine particles but not with 
PM2.5.20 Examination of the cardiovascular parameters 
also showed an association of black carbon, and ultrafine 
particles, and not PM2.5, with increases in pulse wave 
velocity and augmentation index in healthy and COPD 
participants. Overall, we found that participants with 
COPD were especially sensitive to black carbon and 
ultrafine particles in terms of both pulmonary and 
cardiovascular effects. Our findings are in line with the 
cohort analyses showing an association between traffic 
related air pollutants (PM2.5, black carbon and ultrafine 
particles) and cardiovascular disease and mortality.26–28 
This supports the view that pollutants emitted from fossil 
fuel combustion are particularly toxic for individuals with 
cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases.
The effect of exposure to pollution in natural 
environments on the cardiovascular and respiratory 
systems has been reported in young fit volunteers during 
high-intensity or submaximal exercise such as cycling or 
running. Running along or near busy highways or cycling 
during the rush hour has been shown to cause a reduction 
in lung function such as FEV1.29,30 On the other hand, the 
beneficial effects of aerobic exercise on the cardiovascular 
system has been documented with submaximal exercise 
causing a reduction in arterial distensibility and thus 
arterial stiffness in normal volunteers.31 Our study extends 
the respiratory and cardiovascular benefits of normal 
walking exercise in older healthy adults and in patients 
with chronic stable respiratory and cardiovascular 
diseases. It also shows how there are detrimental effects of 
road traffic pollution on these benefits of short-term 
walking, and implicates most of the components of the 
pollutants being associated with the changes in lung 
function and indices of arterial stiffness.
There are some limitations to this study. Because we 
did not include a resting control group, it would not be 
possible to be certain that walking contributed to the

changes in lung function or arterial stiffness. Another 
consideration is the potential contri 
bution of diurnal 
variation on the spirometric measure 
ments.32 However, 
because the first baseline measurements were made at 
11 00 h, which is 1 h before the peak increase in FEV1 that 
has been reported,32 the increases in FEV1 measured after 
the first hour in Hyde Park in healthy participants were 
not related to diurnal variation but most likely induced 
by the walk. Second, the gender imbalance between the 
groups might have had an effect on the responses, but no 
significant 
differences 
in 
end 
points 
were 
recorded 
between 
sexes. Finally, the effect of medications taken by 
participants with either is 
chaemic heart disease or COPD 
on the cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to 
walking cannot be excluded; however, a study in which 
therapies were discontinued would not be ethically 
justifiable. Indeed, our data suggest that cardioprotective 
drugs taken by participants with ischaemic heart disease 
are beneficial when walking in polluted areas.
Our short-term study is unlikely to inform on the long-
term benefits of exercise in relation to pollution. Moderate 
physical activity might protect against the adverse effects 
of air pollution on arterial stiffness,33 providing support 
that regular walking could lead to restoration of the 
protective pulmonary and cardiovascular benefits of 
walking. Data from other studies suggest that air pollution 
risks do not overcome the benefits of active walking in 
urban areas using all-cause mortality outcome.34,35 
Furthermore, the use of mortality as the main outcome 
has its limitation, because pulmonary and cardiovascular 
parameters that are indicative of development of potential 
respiratory and cardiovascular conditions caused by 
exposure to pollutants would probably be more relevant, 
especially in participants with chronic pulmonary and 
cardiovascular diseases who are more susceptible to the 
toxic effects of pollutants.2,8,36 The long-term effects of 
regular walking in polluted environments in these chronic 
conditions need to be established.
We have noted that adults free of chronic cardio-
pulmonary diseases lose the benefits of walking on 
pulmonary and cardiovascular function in a polluted 
environment. In participants with COPD and ischaemic 
heart disease exposed to traffic pollutants, the pulmonary 
benefit from walking seem to be lost too, but the 
improvement in arterial stiffness caused by walking is 
relatively well preserved in ischaemic heart disease 
participants, likely due to concomitant routine medi-
cation use. Given that walking at a normal pace provides 
these cardiovascular and respiratory benefits, our results 
support the advice that healthy participants and patients 
with COPD and ischaemic heart disease should avoid 
highly polluted areas to walk in, if the benefits of walking 
exercise are to be fully reaped. Walking is a preferred 
daily natural and essential activity highly suited for older 
adults and for people with chronic lung and heart 
disease, and patients with chronic heart disease should 
preferably be on cardioprotective medications. Although 
further studies are needed, particularly looking at the 
effect of regular walking in polluted environments, the 
current data are sufficiently compelling to advise older 
adults and chronic pulmonary and cardiac participants to 
avoid walking in highly polluted environments such as 
city streets with high traffic density. Exercise such as 
walking should be done in urban green space areas away 
from high density traffic or in indoor facilities with 
effective air filtration if located near polluted streets. 
Finally, it is important to impose policies and measures 
that can reduce traffic pollution so that every individual 
can enjoy the health benefits of physical activity.
Contributors
RS recruited all participants, accompanied participants during all walks, 
collected the data and performed a preliminary analysis of the data. 
JG analysed and performed statistical analysis of the data, created the 
figures, and contributed to the writing. BB collected and analysed the 
data on pollutants and accompanied the participants on the walk. 
PO-S provided statistical advice and oversaw the statistical analysis. 
SE recruited the cardiac participants and discussed the cardiovascular 
data. FJK advised and analysed the pollutant data. J(J)Z provided advice 
on the protocol and statistical analysis, and on the writing of the 
manuscript. PCo setup the protocol, recruited the cardiac participants, 
discussed the cardiovascular data, and participated in writing of 
manuscript. PCu setup the protocol, oversaw the recruitment and the 
collection of the data, did a preliminary analysis of data, and participated 
in the writing of the manuscript. KFC set up the protocol, recruited the 
respiratory participants, oversaw the project and wrote the final 
manuscript.
