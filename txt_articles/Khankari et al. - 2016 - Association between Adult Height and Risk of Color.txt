 analyses, using height-associated genetic variants identified in a genome-wide association
study (GWAS), to evaluate the association of adult height with these cancers.
Methods and Findings
A systematic review of prospective studies was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and
Web of Science databases. Using meta-analyses, results obtained from 62 studies were sum-
marized for the association of a 10-cm increase in height with cancer risk. Mendelian randomi-
zation analyses were conducted using summary statistics obtained for 423 genetic variants
identified from a recent GWAS of adult height and from a cancer genetics consortium study of
multiple cancers that included 47,800 cases and 81,353 controls. For a 10-cm increase in
height, the summary relative risks derived from the meta-analyses of prospective studies were
1.12 (95% CI 1.10, 1.15), 1.07 (95% CI 1.05, 1.10), and 1.06 (95% CI 1.02, 1.11) for colorectal,
prostate, and lung cancers, respectively. Mendelian randomization analyses showed increased
risks of colorectal (odds ratio [OR] = 1.58, 95% CI 1.14, 2.18) and lung cancer (OR = 1.10, 95%
CI 1.00, 1.22) associated with each 10-cm increase in genetically predicted height. No associa-
tion was observed for prostate cancer (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.92, 1.15). Our meta-analysis was
limited to published studies. The sample size for the Mendelian randomization analysis of colo-
rectal cancer was relatively small, thus affecting the precision of the point estimate.
Conclusions
Our study provides evidence for a potential causal association of adult height with the risk of
colorectal and lung cancers and suggests that certain genetic factors and biological path-
ways affecting adult height may also affect the risk of these cancers.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Several previous observational studies have examined the association between adult
height and risk of cancers of the lung, colon/rectum, and prostate; however, it remains
unclear whether adult height is indeed related to the risk of these cancers.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies that
examined the association between adult height and the risk of colorectal, lung, and pros-
tate cancers.
• To overcome inherent limitations of observational study designs, we conducted Mende-
lian randomization analyses using genetic data generated from a large multi-center con-
sortium study including 47,800 cases and 81,353 controls.
• In the meta-analysis of the prospective observational studies, we found a 12% increased
risk of colorectal cancer, a 7% increased risk of prostate cancer, and a 6% increased risk

corroborated in the Mendelian randomization analyses for colorectal (58%) and lung
cancer (10%).
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Our study provides strong evidence for an association between adult height and risk of
colorectal and lung cancer, and suggests that certain genetic and biological factors that
affect height may also affect the risk of these cancers.

Mendelian randomization analysis for colorectal cancer was relatively small, affecting
the precision of the risk estimate.
Introduction
Numerous studies have examined the relation between height and cancer; however, results
have been inconsistent. The inconsistencies in observational studies could be due to factors
that affect validity, including confounding, selection bias, reverse causation, and measurement
error. Therefore, no consensus has been reached on whether height is a risk factor for colorec-
tal, lung, or prostate cancer, three of the most common cancers affecting men and women. Fur-
thermore, meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies, summarizing the association between
height and colorectal, lung, or prostate cancers, have not been conducted.
Mendelian randomization is based on the principle that an individual’s genotype is randomized
at conception [1] and utilizes genetic variants as instrumental variables for phenotypic exposures.
This approach circumvents threats to validity found in conventional observational epidemiologic
studies and potentially allows for causal inferences regarding the relation between exposure and dis-
ease [1–3]. Mendelian randomization analyses make the following assumptions regarding the
genetic variants used in instrumental variables: (1) the genetic variants are associated with the expo-
sure, (2) the genetic variants affect the outcome only via the exposure (also known as the “exclusion
restriction”), and (3) the genetic variants are not associated with any confounders of the exposure-
outcome association [4]. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified nearly 700
variants—reflecting 423 loci—that were associated with adult height in individuals of European
descent [5]. These variants explain approximately 16% of height variance and have the potential to
serve as strong instruments in Mendelian randomization analyses.
To comprehensively evaluate the association between height and risk of colorectal, lung,
and prostate cancers, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous prospec-
tive studies. Additionally, we carried out Mendelian randomization analyses utilizing GWAS
summary statistics from the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON)
and Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortia studies of individuals
of European descent.
Methods
Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science on January 3, 2016, for prospective studies
(i.e., prospective cohort, nested case-control, and case-cohort studies) using the following

 search terms: lung neoplasms; lung cancer; colorectal neoplasms; colorectal cancer; prostate
neoplasms; prostate cancer; lung, prostate, colorectal, colon, rectum, rectal or cancer; and body
height, height, stature, body size, anthropometrics, or anthropometry. After restricting the
results to English language and humans, a total of 15,691 publications were found.
Approximately 2,900 publications were duplicates. Following the title and abstract review,
additional exclusions for outcomes other than cancer resulted in a total of 325 studies for full-
text review. One Chinese study, for which all relevant tables and methods were written in
English, was additionally included [6]. Full-text review revealed height examined in relation to
lung cancer in 11 studies [6–16], to colorectal cancer in 24 studies [6,9–31], and to prostate
cancer in 27 studies [6,9–11,16,30,32–52]; these studies were included in the meta-analysis. We
also conducted a meta-analysis for a subset of prostate cancer studies that also reported esti-
mates for aggressive prostate cancer (defined as Gleason score � 7, metastatic spread, or
regional/distant stage) [40,41,43–52]. Given that several studies examined multiple cancer
sites, the final set of studies for each cancer type included in the meta-analysis is not exclusive.
Fig 1 summarizes the search results and exclusions for this systematic review and the final set
of studies used in the meta-analysis (detailed diagram according to cancer site provided in S5
Fig). Details regarding each study included in the meta-analysis are provided in S1–S4 Tables.
We recently published a large-scale meta-analysis of prospective studies of the association of
height with breast cancer (more than 113,000 incident breast cancers) [53]; we present the
meta-analysis results for breast cancer from our previous study for comparison.
All study estimates were scaled for a 10-cm increase in height in relation to cancer, which,
in general, approximated the average interquartile range in height across all studies. For studies
that reported categorical estimates of height (i.e., quantiles), a continuous estimate and stan-
dard error was estimated using the method proposed by Greenland and Longnecker [54] using
R package “dosresmeta” (R version 3.1.2). Scores were generated for each quantile for studies
reporting categorical estimates and were equivalent to either the mean or median; scores for
the uppermost open-ended quantiles were generated using the method presented by Il’yasova
et al. [55].
Study-specific estimates were summarized using inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) fixed- and
random-effects meta-analyses for all three cancers (colorectal, lung, and prostate) separately.
Fixed-effects models assume no heterogeneity between the study estimates, whereas random-
effects models take heterogeneity of the study estimates into consideration. Cochran’s test for
homogeneity was applied in the analysis, with p < 0.05 indicating heterogeneity among the stud-
ies. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the random-effects meta-analyses were esti-
mated using restricted maximum likelihood. Funnel plots were generated for each cancer to
examine publication bias and were formally assessed using Begg’s and Egger’s statistical tests
(S1–S4 Figs); no violations were observed. Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata version 12.1.
Mendelian Randomization Analysis Using Summary Statistics
Results from our recent Mendelian randomization analysis of adult height and breast cancer
have been published [53], and thus the current analysis focuses on cancers of the colorectum,
lung, and prostate. The analysis was conducted to estimate the effect of height (X) on the risk
of cancer (Y) using genetic variants (g), where the causal estimate is equal to Yg/Xg [56]. For the
association between genetic variants and height (Xg), we utilized available summary statistics
from the GIANT GWAS. Summary statistics for the association between genetic variants and
each of the three cancers (Yg) are from the GAME-ON consortium.
Nearly 700 genetic variants from 423 loci were identified as reaching genome-wide signifi-
cance (p < 5 × 10−8) in the GIANT consortium study, explaining 16% of phenotypic variation

 in height [5]. In our study, we selected 423 uncorrelated variants, representing these loci, to
construct the instrumental variables in our Mendelian randomization analysis (S5 Table).
GAME-ON data were utilized to provide regression coefficients and standard errors for
each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in relation to cancer (Yg). GAME-ON is network
of genetic epidemiology consortia that contains GWAS data from the Colorectal Transdisci-
plinary Study (CORECT); Discovery, Biology, and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer
(DRIVE); Elucidating Loci Involved in Prostate Cancer Susceptibility (ELLIPSE); Follow-up of

 Ovarian Cancer Genetic Association and Interaction Studies (FOCI); and Transdisciplinary
Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL). For the current study, we used data from CORECT,
ELLIPSE, and TRICL. The GAME-ON consortium primarily consists of studies of individuals of
European descent. SNPs with poor imputation quality (r2 < 0.3) were excluded (CORECT used
IMPUTE 2.0 info score < 0.7 as the cutoff) [57]. The association between adult height and breast
cancer risk was evaluated in our previous study using 168 height-associated variants [53]. For the
analysis presented here, we updated the Mendelian randomization summary estimate for breast
cancer using data from DRIVE for the 423 newly identified height-associated variants.
Not all SNPs with information regarding Xg (from the GIANT consortium) had correspond-
ing information regarding Yg (from GAME-ON); therefore, these SNPs were excluded from the
instrumental variables for colorectal cancer (n = 77) and prostate cancer (n = 4). No SNPs were
excluded from the instrument for lung cancer. Thus, there were fewer instrumental variables for
the colorectal and prostate cancer studies than for the lung cancer study. Using both summary
statistics for Yg and Xg, an IVW meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the effect of genetically
determined height on the risk of each cancer using the method of Burgess et al. [56]:

where Xg is the beta estimate for the association between the SNP and height (from GIANT), Yg
is the beta estimate for the association between the SNP and cancer (from GAME-ON), and σYg
is the standard error for Yg. Corresponding ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using ^
bIVW and
seð^
bIVWÞ. All ORs and 95% CIs were subsequently standardized per 10 cm. SAS version 9.4 was
utilized for the Mendelian randomization analysis using summarized data.
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted several sensitivity analyses to assess whether the association of height with can-
cer varied for different subgroups. Using data from a previous GIANT height GWAS that pre-
sented sex-stratified summary statistics for 168 independent SNPs explaining approximately
10% of variation in height [58], we conducted Mendelian randomization sensitivity analyses
for colorectal and lung cancers for males and females separately. Additionally, in order to
account for potential pleiotropy of the SNPs utilized in the genetic instrument (potentially vio-
lating the exclusion restriction assumption for a valid instrumental variable), we excluded
SNPs with suggested pleiotropic effects associated with various diseases and traits (e.g., pulmo-
nary function, phospholipid levels, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) [5]. Additionally we
used a data-driven approach to explore violations of pleiotropy using Egger regression [59].
For the meta-analysis, we conducted additional analyses stratified by cancer of the colon versus
rectum and self-reported height versus measured height. Given that height is associated with
lung size and lung function [60]—which could lead to efficient nicotine uptake [61] and possi-
bly increased likelihood of smoking initiation [62] among taller individuals—we also stratified
our meta-analysis results by studies that adjusted for potential confounding by smoking.
Finally, we conducted sensitivity meta-analyses for colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers,
including only those studies of populations of European descent.
Results
Meta-analysis
For colorectal cancer (Fig 2), we observed an approximately 12% increased risk (95% CI 1.10,
1.15) for a 10-cm increase in adult height (p < 0.001); no important differences were observed

 when stratified by sex. A 7% increase (95% CI 5%, 10%) in the risk of prostate cancer
(p < 0.001; Fig 3A), and a 5% increase (95% CI −2%, 13%) in the risk of aggressive prostate
cancer, was observed for a 10-cm increase in height (p = 0.031; Fig 3B). A 10-cm increase in
height was associated with a 7% increase in lung cancer risk in males (relative risk [RR] = 1.07,
95% CI 1.04, 1.10; Fig 4) and a 2% increase in females (RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.99, 1.05; Fig 4).
In general, the results from our sensitivity analyses, stratifying the studies based on several
different factors, were not substantially different from those of the main analysis. After stratifi-
cation by cancer site, our meta-analysis random-effects summary estimate for rectal cancer
was lower (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.06, 1.13) than that for colon cancer (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.14,
1.19). No apparent differences were observed for lung cancer between studies that adjusted for
smoking (RRsmoking-adjusted = 1.06, 95% CI 1.00, 1.11) and those that did not (RRnot-adjusted =
1.08, 95% CI 0.98, 1.21). Similarly, no differences were observed for smoking-adjusted studies
for colorectal cancer (RRsmoking-adjusted = 1.11, 95% CI 1.08, 1.15; RRnot-adjusted = 1.13, 95% CI
1.09, 1.17). For prostate cancer, a modest difference was observed (RRsmoking-adjusted = 1.05,

ence was not statistically significant. Studies using self-reported height and studies using mea-
sured height yielded very similar summary estimates for prostate cancer (RRself-reported = 1.07,
95% CI 1.00, 1.14; RRmeasured = 1.09, 95% CI 1.07, 1.11) and colorectal cancer (RRself-reported =

 1.04, 1.17; homogeneity p = 0.062). Additionally, the random-effects summary estimates for colo-
rectal, prostate, and lung cancers did not differ substantially when we restricted the studies to
only those conducted among populations of European descent (S6 Table).
Mendelian Randomization Analysis
Results from the Mendelian randomization analyses are presented in Table 1. A nearly 60%
increased risk of colorectal cancer was observed per 10-cm increase in genetically predicted
height (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.14, 2.18, p = 0.006); males and females had slightly different esti-
mates per 10-cm increase in height, with females having a slightly higher risk than males (S7
Table). A modest association with genetically predicted height was observed for lung cancer
(OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.00, 1.22, p = 0.053). The association appears to be stronger for adenocar-
cinoma of the lung (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.00, 1.35, p = 0.056) than for squamous cell carcinoma
of the lung (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.90, 1.25, p = 0.463), and the homogeneity p-value was not sta-
tistically significant (p = 0.427). However, the estimates for males and females according to
subtype were nearly identical (S7 Table). No statistically significant association with genetically
predicted height was seen for prostate cancer (overall prostate cancer, OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.92,
1.15, p = 0.642; aggressive prostate cancer, OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.84, 1.15, p = 0.822). The results
for breast cancer showed an approximately 20% increase in risk per 10-cm increase in geneti-
cally predicted height (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.07, 1.33, p = 0.001), which is very similar to our
previous estimate using a smaller set of height-associated genetic variants (OR = 1.21, 95% CI
1.05, 1.39, p = 0.008) [53].
We did not observe any substantial differences in the Mendelian randomization estimates
after excluding genetic variants with suggested pleiotropic effects from the instrument (S8
Table). Furthermore, the impact of pleiotropy may be negligible, given that the average pleio-
tropic effect was small and the intercept from the data-driven Egger regression was not statisti-
cally significant (S9 Table).

 Discussion
In this meta-analysis involving 62 published prospective studies, we observed a statistically sig-
nificant increased risk for colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers associated with higher adult
height. Our Mendelian randomization analyses confirmed these increased risks for colorectal
and lung cancers but not for prostate cancer, indicating perhaps that the increased risk
reported from previous prospective cohort studies for prostate cancer may be due to biases. To
our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis performed to summarize results from prospective
cohort studies regarding the association of adult height and these three major cancers that
affect the lives of men and women throughout the world. To our knowledge, this is also the
first Mendelian randomization analysis performed to evaluate the association between adult
height and risk of lung cancer. Our study, using an instrument comprising 423 height-related
SNPs and explaining approximately 16% of phenotypic variation, provides strong evidence for
a possible causal association between adult height and risk of breast, colorectal, and lung can-
cers. It suggests that certain genetic factors and biological pathways affecting adult height may
affect the risk of these major cancers.
One potential reason taller individuals may be at higher risk is the increased opportunity for
a cell to mutate given that taller people have more cells. However, multiple interrelated biologi-
cal pathways have also been implicated in the association between height and cancer. One
pathway is the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, which is known to promote cell prolif-
eration and inhibit apoptosis [63]; several genetic variants of the IGF pathway have been iden-
tified as being related to height. Growth hormone is also known to stimulate IGF-1 expression,
which plays an important role in determining adult height via regulation of bone growth [64].
Thus, attained height may represent cumulative exposure to IGF-1 throughout important peri-
ods of growth and development (i.e., in utero, childhood, adolescence) [65]. High levels of
IGF-1 have also been shown to be positively associated with colorectal, lung, and prostate can-
cers [66–68]. Other lifestyle risk factors for colorectal cancer, such as increased caloric intake
[69], being overweight [70], and having a sedentary lifestyle [71], have demonstrated higher
levels of IGF-1 via increased insulin production and subsequent inhibition of IGF-binding pro-
tein synthesis [70]. Therefore, it is possible that high IGF-1 may be one of the underlying bio-
logical mechanisms mediating the association of height and colorectal cancer.
It is unlikely that the IGF-1 pathway alone would explain entirely the observed increased
colorectal and lung cancer risk associated with adult height. Other pathways have also been
revealed recently to influence adult height, including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)
[72] and Hedgehog [73,74]. A number of loci (SMAD3, MTOR, GLI2, LAMA5) involved in
these pathways were related to height in a recent GWAS [5]. Some of these pathways have also
been linked to the pathogenesis of colorectal and lung cancers.
The results are similar when comparing the summary estimates from the meta-analysis and
the associations from the Mendelian randomization analysis for both breast and lung cancers.
For colorectal cancer, however, the association from our Mendelian randomization analysis
was substantially stronger than that estimated from the meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies. This difference is likely due to sampling errors, given the small sample size of our Men-
delian randomization analysis performed for colorectal cancer. Indeed, in a recent Mendelian
randomization study with a larger sample size (more than 10,000 cases and 10,000 controls)
than our study, a 10-cm increase in height was associated with a 7% (95% CI 1%, 14%)
increased risk of colorectal cancer, and the risk was higher among females (OR = 1.09, 95% CI
1.01, 1.19) than males (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.96, 1.15) [75]. Although the magnitudes of the
associations were different, a similar pattern—where females had a slightly higher risk than
males—was also observed in our analysis (S7 Table). The consistency of the association in

 these two studies regarding adult height and increased colorectal cancer risk provides further
support for a possible causal association.
We report modest increases in the risk of lung cancer with height in both the meta-analysis
of prospective studies and the Mendelian randomization analysis. The majority of lung cancers
are caused by smoking, and smoking may reduce IGF-1 levels [66]. Future investigations using
individual-level data may consider stratification by smoking status to assess whether or not the
association of height and lung cancer may be modified by tobacco smoking. For prostate can-
cer, we observed a null association with height in the Mendelian randomization analysis, pro-
viding no support for the modestly elevated risk observed in previous prospective cohort
studies between adult height and the risk of prostate cancer. Our results are supported by a
recently published Mendelian randomization study utilizing individual-level data that reported
a null association between adult height and prostate cancer risk [76]. Our study should have
80% statistical power to detect a 9% increased risk in all prostate cancer associated with adult
height, and an 11% increased risk in aggressive prostate cancer [77]. Therefore, we could not
exclude the possibility of a weak association of adult height with prostate cancer.
There are several strengths to this study. The comprehensive literature search identified 62
studies related to adult height and the cancers evaluated in our study. Additionally, comparing
the results from the Mendelian randomization analysis with the meta-analysis summary esti-
mates could indicate whether or not the results from observational studies are biased, assuming
the Mendelian randomization analyses represent an effect that may be closer to the true effect.
Furthermore, we believe that the genetic variants used in our Mendelian randomization analy-
sis serve as an adequate instrument for height for several reasons. One of the assumptions for a
valid instrument is that the genetic marker is associated with the exposure phenotype of inter-
est [3]. In our analysis, we utilized multiple genetic variants explaining approximately 16% of
variation in height. It has also been demonstrated that using multiple SNPs helps to strengthen
the genetic instrument and improve the precision of the estimate [56], and reduces bias stem-
ming from potential violations of the other Mendelian randomization assumptions [4]. Addi-
tionally, all of the variants utilized were uncorrelated, and those that were not genotyped
directly were imputed with high accuracy (r2 � 0.3 for ELLIPSE and TRICL, and info
score � 0.7 for CORECT) [57]. We also explored the influence of pleiotropy by excluding vari-
ants (n = 36) with suggested pleiotropic effects on several different biological outcomes, includ-
ing pulmonary function, sex hormone binding globulin levels, and age at menarche.
Pleiotropic effects would violate the exclusion restriction assumption for a valid instrument,
which states that the instrument affects the outcome only through the exposure phenotype of
interest [3,4]. However, as our results from the sensitivity analyses indicate, removing the
pleiotropic SNPs from the instrument did not appreciably alter the results. Furthermore, the
average pleiotropic effect, estimated using a data-driven approach via Egger regression [59],
was not statistically significant.
Our study also has several limitations. First, the meta-analyses for the three different cancers
are subject to the limitations of the original epidemiologic studies, which could include mea-
surement errors, confounding, selection bias, and random error. Additionally, concerns
regarding causal inference from Mendelian randomization studies remain, given the strict cri-
teria required for a valid instrument. In particular, we could not entirely exclude the possible
influence of pleiotropic effects on our results since some of the SNPs used in our study might
be associated with certain unknown traits that may be related to cancer risk. However, such an
influence, if it exists, should be very small, since an instrumental variable constructed using
more than 400 height-associated SNPs should be much more strongly associated with adult
height than with any other traits. The sample sizes for the analysis of colorectal cancer and for
the subgroup analyses of prostate and lung cancers are relatively small, and the relationship

 between height and these cancers warrants further study using larger sample sizes. Given that
most studies showed a linear association between adult height and cancer risk, we assumed a
linear association in this analysis, which helped in harmonizing estimates and allowed us to
conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis including all relevant studies. A formal test of the
shape of the association may be needed in future studies.
In summary, this large-scale meta-analysis of prospective studies and Mendelian randomi-
zation analysis provide strong evidence for a possible causal association between adult height
and the risk of colorectal and lung cancers. Our study suggests that certain biological pathways
affecting adult height may also be involved in the etiology of both colorectal and lung cancers.
