Reproducibility: let’s get it right from the start
From September 12th 2018, Nature Communications will be setting a higher standard of data reporting
for papers under peer review. We believe that sharing raw data at an early stage with editors and
reviewers is the best way to build confidence in the reproducibility of your findings. Learn here how to
ensure that your paper makes the grade.
W
hether you prefer to call
it a crisis, a challenge or
a revolution, the growing
awareness of reproduci-
bility as an important
issue in science is surely a cause for opti-
mism. In biomedical research in particular,
journals now compete with each other to
demonstrate the strength of their reprodu-
cibility credentials, and play an increasingly
proactive role in setting standards for how
data and methods should be reported in
their pages. Many journals and funding
bodies
have
developed
checklists
and
guidelines with the aim of ensuring that
published papers clearly demonstrate that
the findings were reproducible, and provide
sufficient information for readers to repro-
duce the work for themselves.
At Nature Communications, we have
typically asked our life science authors to
complete
such
a
checklist
when
they
resubmit a revised version of their manu-
script in response to reviewer comments.
We have also deployed subject-specific
checklists to set standards for the report-
ing of magnetic resonance imaging, ChIP-
seq, laser and solar cell
experiments. However,
with the exception of
the laser and solar cells
checklists,
they
have
generally
not
been
made available to peer
reviewers
and
have
been implemented pri-
marily as a guidance
document for authors
rather than a list of
strict requirements.
Despite
this
gui-
dance, our editors have
on occasion identified
serious problems with papers after having
requested more detailed information, and
this can occur at a relatively late stage in
review, resulting in a waste of time for
reviewers and authors alike. Ensuring that
reporting is transparent, right from the
start of the peer review process, would
allow our reviewers to scrutinize the level
of support for the findings with greater
confidence and at a point where any pro-
blems can more easily be resolved.
For this reason, Nature Communications
is now joining the other Nature journals in
requiring authors to complete all relevant
checklists at the point their paper is sent for
peer review. In the life sciences, we will
require the reporting summary to be com-
pleted, which incorporates all of the life
science-related
checklists
into
a
single
document. In the physical sciences, the
solar cells and lasing reporting summaries
will continue to be mandated at this stage.
As these reporting summaries are already
in use by editors at Nature and the Nature
Research
journals,
authors
transferring
peer-reviewed papers from these journals to
Nature Communications will not have to
complete
additional
checklists,
and
in
common with these journals, the reporting
summary
will
be
made
available
to
reviewers in every round of peer review and
published alongside the article. Publishing
these reporting summaries will establish
them as a key part of the paper, allowing
readers to verify and build on the study.
To further promote transparency, we
will also be asking our authors to supply
for publication the source data underlying
any graphs and charts, and uncropped,
unprocessed scans of any blots or gels. In
order to avoid delaying the first round of
peer review, we will initially only request
that source data be supplied with the
revised versions of the manuscript, unless
we feel that it would be particularly
important for the reviewers to have access
to these data at an earlier stage. However,
OPEN
“…the trio of published
checklists, source data and
reviewer reports together will
represent powerful proof of the
strength and rigor of the
published work and the peer
review process that helped to
improve it.”

 we strongly encourage authors to lead the
way in promoting transparency by making
sure that their work fulfils or exceeds our
criteria right from the start. Here are four
simple steps you can take to give your
paper the best possible chance of flying
through peer review:
1.
Define your n numbers: just stating
‘n = 5’ is no longer sufficient—it must
be clear what your n number refers to
for each experiment. For example, did
you do the experiment on five plants,
on five tissue samples from the same
plant, or did you run the same sample
for analysis five times over? You
should be able to justify your choice
of sample size and statistical tests in
the reporting summary.
2.
Show us the spread: bar charts with
error bars are commonly used to
depict numerical data, but they can
be misleading when sample sizes are
small. Wherever possible, use graph
types
that
include
individual
data
points to directly show the spread of
the data.
3.
Make it available: before submitting
your paper, take a close look at our
policies on the availability of materials,
data and code, and craft clear avail-
ability statements in your paper that
explain to reviewers and future readers
how
they
can
access
everything
they might need to reproduce your
findings. For some types of data,
deposition in an approved publicly
accessible database is mandatory for
publication,
but
don’t
stop
there:
include source data with your manu-
script, and make use of repositories
such as figshare to make other data
available to your reviewers and read-
ers. For datasets with high re-use
value, consider also submitting a data
descriptor
to
our
sister
journal,
Scientific Data, and making the dataset
publicly available through one of their
recommended repositories.
4.
Let us be your guide: the reporting
summary and solar cells and lasing
reporting summaries detail a lot of
important information that can be
used not just to help you describe
your experimental design, figures of
merit, the materials used and the
analysis employed, but also to plan
the experiment in the first place.
Taking
care
to
consider
these
requirements
before
you
conduct
your experiments will improve your
chances of successful publication in
any journal.
Finally, with the best will in the world,
making
source
data
available
to
peer
reviewers does not necessarily mean that
they will be able to scrutinise and reanalyse
every aspect of it in detail; this would in
some cases be a mammoth task. However,
we hope that our reviewers will make use
of this resource and freely comment on any
issues in their reports. We also hope that
our authors will choose to publish these
reviewer comments alongside their articles
by opting into our transparent peer review
scheme, as the trio of published checklists,
source data and reviewer reports together
will
represent
powerful
proof
of
the
strength and rigor of the published work
and the peer review process that helped to
improve it.
