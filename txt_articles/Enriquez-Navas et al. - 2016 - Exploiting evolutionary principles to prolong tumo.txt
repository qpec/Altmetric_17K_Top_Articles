Conventional cancer treatment strategies assume that maximum patient benefit is achieved through maximum killing
of tumor cells. However, by eliminating the therapy-sensitive population, this strategy accelerates emergence of re-
sistant clones that proliferate unopposed by competitors—an evolutionary phenomenon termed “competitive re-
lease.” We present an evolution-guided treatment strategy designed to maintain a stable population of
chemosensitive cells thatlimit proliferationof resistant clones byexploiting the fitness costof the resistant phenotype.
We treated MDA-MB-231/luc triple-negative and MCF7 estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancers growing
orthotopically in a mouse mammary fat pad with paclitaxel, using algorithms linked to tumor response monitored
by magnetic resonance imaging. We found that initial control required more intensive therapy with regular
application of drug to deflect the exponential tumor growth curve onto a plateau. Dose-skipping algorithms during
this phase were less successful than variable dosing algorithms. However, once initial tumor control was achieved, it
was maintained with progressively smaller drug doses. In 60 to 80% of animals, continued decline in tumor size
permitted intervals as long as several weeks in which no treatment was necessary. Magnetic resonance images
and histological analysis of tumors controlled by adaptive therapy demonstrated increased vascular density and less
necrosis, suggesting that vascular normalization resulting from enforced stabilization of tumor volume may contrib-
ute to ongoing tumor control with lower drug doses. Our study demonstrates that an evolution-based therapeutic
strategy using an available chemotherapeutic drug and conventional clinical imaging can prolong the progression-
free survival in different preclinical models of breast cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Chemotherapy with cytotoxic drugs is widely used for breast cancer
treatment in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic clinical settings
(1). In general, cytotoxic drugs are administered with the assumption
that maximum clinical benefit is obtained by killing the greatest possible
number of cancer cells. Consistent with this premise, most systemic
cancer chemotherapies are applied at the maximum tolerated dose den-
sity (3–5), which has the theoretical benefits of killing the largest num-
ber of cancer cells and minimizing the risk of resistant mutations.
Metronomic therapy has been investigated as an alternative strategy
that uses lower drug doses administered more frequently (6, 7). Al-
though it is qualitatively different, this approach maintains the same
basic intent of maximum tumor cell death through greater cumulative
doses and antiangiogenic effects (8).
Recently, the traditional maximum dose density paradigm has been
questioned (9, 10) on the basis of a theoretical model that views cancer
therapy as an evolutionary and ecological process. This alternative
model rests on three major assumptions: First, phenotypically or envi-
ronmentally mediated resistant cells are present before treatment
(11, 12). Second, most xenobiotic mechanisms protecting cells from cy-
totoxic agents do not require mutations, but rather increased expression
of molecular machinery already encoded in the genome (13). Third,
cancer populations within a tumor compete with each other for space
and substrate (14, 15).
Clearly, in the presence of chemotherapy, resistant cells are better
adapted and, thus, fitter (more proliferative) than wild-type cells. How-
ever, in the absence of chemotherapy, this fitness difference is typically
reversedbecause of the metaboliccostof the resistance mechanism(syn-
thesis, maintenance, andoperation of membrane extrusion pumps). For
example, cells expressing the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype can
expend up to one-third of their total ATP (adenosine 5′-triphosphate)
production for operation of the associated membrane pumps (16).
In an environment of limited substrate, this cost requires diversion of
resources from proliferation and invasion. The evolutionary con-
sequences of this trade-off are demonstrated by observations that P-
glycoprotein–expressing cells (MCF7-dox) revert to wild type unless
doxorubicin is maintained in the culture media as a strong selection
force (17). In this Darwinian setting, maximum dose density therapy
strongly selects for resistant phenotypes and, by removing all competi-
tors, permits unconstrained proliferation of the resistant populations
even when no drug is present—a phenomenon well recognized in evo-
lutionary dynamics as “competitive release” (18, 19).
Here, we investigate an alternative, evolution-based treatment
strategy (10, 20–23) that aims to maximize time to progression rather than
reduction in tumor size. This approach applies limited, short bursts of
therapy with an explicit goal of maintaining a residual population of
treatment-sensitive cells. When therapy is withdrawn, this population
suppresses proliferation of resistant tumor cells because of its fitness ad-
vantage in the absence of drug.
In earlier work (10, 23), we framed this treatment strategy mathe-
matically and presented supportive in vitro and in vivo experimental
evidence in ovarian cancer. An unanticipated observation in the initial

 in vivo studies with ovarian cancer was that, once tumor control was
achieved, it could be maintained with progressively lower doses of the
chemotherapy agent (23).
Here, we address four questions that arose from these investigations.
First, can adaptive therapy (AT) be applied to other cancer types? Second,
what is the optimal strategy for adaptively maintaining a stable tumor:
regular application of decreasing doses of drug or skipping doses when
the tumor is stable? Third, can routine clinical imaging [for example,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] provide sufficient information on
tumor size to guide therapy? Fourth, what is the mechanism for increased
drug efficacy once initial control is achieved?
Here,weappliedATtoMDA-MB-231/luc,ametastatictriple-negative
human breast cancer cell line, and to MCF7, a less aggressive ER+
human breast cancer cell line, orthotopically implanted in the mouse
mammary fat pad and treated with paclitaxel. We used MRI scans to
measure the tumor volume and, consequently, guide the therapeutic al-
gorithms. To optimize the AT algorithm, we examined the control
achieved by continuous dose adjustment versus skipping treatment
doses. Finally, we performed both diffusion-weighted (DW) and dy-
namic contrast-enhanced MRI of the tumors during therapy to assess
changes in tumor vascularity and blood flow during enforced stabiliza-
tion of the tumor volume compared to progressive growth. We used
these in vivo studies along with histological examination of the tumors
at the completion of the experiment to examine our hypothesis that the
progressively lower doses necessary for tumor control in the initial AT
experiments were the result of vascular normalization that may both
limit invasive tumor growth and maximize drug delivery (24–26).
RESULTS
Tumor growth control by AT
We evaluated the responses of MDA-MB-
231 tumors to three different therapies:
conventional maximum dose density
application of paclitaxel (ST), AT in which
the frequency of dosing is maintained but
with decreasing doses as the tumor re-
sponds (AT-1), and AT in which doses
of paclitaxel are never lowered but rather
doses are skipped when the tumor is re-
sponding (AT-2). Additional details can
be found in Materials and Methods and
fig. S1. First, we compared the treatment
outcome of ST with AT-1. In Fig. 1A, both
ST and AT-1 treatments suppressed tu-
mor growth successfully for the initial pe-
riod (10 to 20 days). However, tumor
growth in the ST group rapidly recovered
after the scheduled treatment was over. In
contrast, the tumor burden remained sta-
ble relative to the initial tumor volume for
a longer period under AT-1 than under
ST, similarly to the previous AT trials in
an ovarian cancer model (8). We applied
the same treatment algorithms to larger
tumors and observed that AT-1 produced
a long-term stabilization of tumor burden
(Fig. 1B). In both trials, nearly all of the tumors in the AT-1 group (six of
seven mice) reached the minimum tumor volume cutoff for being trea-
ted (see AT-1 description in Materials and Methods), and remained
small and stable throughout the prolonged follow-up period, requiring
lower and lower doses of chemotherapy and eventually allowing treat-
ment withdrawal.
Because frequent administration of chemotherapy is challenging in
clinics, we investigated a dose-skipping algorithm (AT-2) in which tu-
mors that were stable between measurements received no therapy rather
than an adjusted (lower) dose, as dictated by the algorithm for AT-1. In
Fig. 1C, ST initially reduced tumor volume but usually was not curative,
andthetumorsrecurred.ATwithdose skipping(AT-2)controlledtumor
volume for a longer period. However, unlike the results in AT-1, the tu-
mors generally progressed through the AT-2 strategy.
Toobtain amoreprecisecomparison betweenthese twoATalgorithms,
we applied both AT treatment methods in the same batch of animals. In
Fig.1D,AT-1controlledthetumorgrowthbetterthanAT-2inallcases.As
in trials 1 and 2, 66% (four of six mice) of the tumors treated according to
AT-1 ultimately became stable even when therapy was withdrawn.
To ensure that our findings were generalizable to different cancer
types, we injected other cohorts of mice with MCF7 cells (Fig. 2), an
estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) slowly invasive human breast cancer.
In this case, because the cell line is estrogen-dependent (ER+), we had to
implant estrogen pellets (0.72 mg of b-estradiol, slow release) in the
animals before injecting the tumor cells. The same therapies were ap-
plied to this cohort, showing that AT-1 maintained a stable tumor vol-
ume for extended periods in all cases. Similar to the earlier experiments,

algorithm (AT-1 or AT-2; see Materials and Methods). Data are means ± SD. More detailed results, including

 therapy was ultimately withdrawn in three of the five (60%) mice with
no furtherprogression. Also similarto the earlierexperiments, we found
that the AT-2 strategy did not maintain a stable tumor volume.
Prolonged survival benefit of AT with dose adjustments
To corroborate the progression-free survival benefits of AT, we ana-
lyzed the therapy outcomes by Kaplan-Meier estimation. We counted
the number of mice with tumor size under 1000 mm3, assuming this as
a lethal tumor burden, and plotted them as shown in Fig. 3. In the case
of MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3A), all mice in the control group reached the
tumor volume limit of 1000 mm3 with a median progression-free sur-
vival of 75.5 days. Administration of high-dose paclitaxel (ST) resulted
in a rapid decline of tumor volume followed by rapid progression. In
two animals in this cohort, the initial high-dose regimen was reinsti-
tuted after progression but had no effect on tumor growth, indicating
that a highly resistant phenotype had been selected by the initial dose.
ST and AT-2 delayed the progression at medians of 108.5 and 109 days,
respectively. In both of these treatment cohorts, most of the mice devel-
oped tumors larger than the limit by ~100 days after injection, and the
survivalbenefit wasnot significant (P = 0.3835and0.1573, respectively).
Although AT-2 appeared to have a better treatment outcome than ST in
Fig. 1, there was no significant benefit in progression-free survival (P =
0.9163). In contrast, AT-1 achieved a significant survival benefit (P =
0.0006), with only 2 of the 12 (16%) animals progressing beyond
1000 mm3 tumor burden within the 155 days of these trials.
Figure 3B demonstrates the results in MCF7 mice. In control, ST,
and AT-2, all the mice reached a tumor volume larger than 1000 mm3
during the monitoring time. However, only one of the AT-1 animals
reached this limit during the same period of time, indicating a significant
survival benefit (P = 0.03). There wasno significant survival benefit inany
of the other three groups.
Figure 4 and fig. S2 show the total dose of drug administered using
the three different treatment strategies. Because the animals lived lon-
ger, the cumulative doses in the AT-1 group exceeded those for both
AT-2 and ST in both cell lines. This higher total dose also reflected
our findings that stabilizing the volume of an initially exponentially
growing tumor required aggressive initial therapy with total drug doses
greater than those of ST but given over a longer time period. However,
once control of the tumor was obtained, the doses could be rapidly re-
duced and even withdrawn (fig. S3) so that the slopes of drug dose ac-
cumulation in AT-1 mice decreased over time in Fig. 4 and fig. S2. None
of the mice in any of the treatment groups showed evidence of toxicity,
maintaining a stable body weight (tables S1 to S4).
MRI analysis and assessment of treatment response
DW MRI images with different b values (that is, with different strength
of diffusion-sensitizing factor) were acquired and analyzed to generate
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of the tumors. Because ADC
is highest in areas of cytotoxic or vasogenic edema and necrosis, we used
these maps to estimate the percentage of necrotic tissue during tumor
monitoring.
In Fig. 5, MDA-MB-231 AT-2– and ST-treated tumors developed
increasing tumor necrosis over time. The AT-1 cohort exhibited a gen-
erally decreasing amount of necrosis over time (after an initial increase).
In the MCF7 mice, AT-1 therapy maintained a stable volume fraction of
necrosis throughout treatment, whereas it generally increased in the
other cohorts.
In Fig. 6, we show that dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) MRI
imaging before, during, and after therapy demonstrated greater blood
flow in the tumors treated with AT-1 in both cell lines.

 Histological examination
At the completion of monitoring, we performed immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC) including hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), CD31, and
smooth muscle actin (SMA) staining of each tumor to calculate necrotic
and viable tumor volumes, vascularity density, and integrity of the ves-
sels, respectively. All of the tumors were fully occupied by cancer cells
that were morphologically identical to the parental cell line, even in
those animal in which tumor remained controlled after therapy was
withdrawn.
In Fig. 7 (top row), we demonstrate that the necrotic fraction of
MDA-MB-231 tumors under AT-1 was the smallest among the
tested therapies. Also, the in vivo change in necrosis calculated by
ADC maps from DW MRI experiments (Fig. 5) showed that AT-
1 maintained the amount of necrosis at a more stable level than
the other therapies tested.
Consistent with these results and the DCE MRI experiments, CD31
staining (Fig. 7) demonstrated that vascular density was highest in the
AT-1 cohort. SMA staining showed that the vascular walls were not sta-
tistically different among the groups.
Histological examination of the MCF7 tumors showed only low
amounts of necrosis, which were not significantly different among the
cohorts (Fig. 7). However, CD31 staining showed a higher mean vascu-
lar density in the AT-1 and AT-2 (the latter being significantly different,
P = 0.04) compared to the ST and control groups. In contrast, SMA
(measured to assess vessel functionality) staining was significantly
increased (P ≤ 0.002) in AT-1 compared to the rest of the treatments.
DISCUSSION
The emergence and proliferation of drug-
resistant phenotypes in advanced and
metastatic cancers result in treatment fail-
ure and disease progression. We propose
that thisprocess is governed by Darwinian
principles and that conventional maxi-
mum dose density chemotherapy acceler-
ates the evolutionary dynamics that
permit unopposed proliferation of resist-
ant tumor populations—a phenomenon
known as competitive release.
In previous investigations, we applied
computational methods from this evolu-
tionarymodeltodeveloptherapeuticstrate-
gies that exploit Darwinian dynamics to
prolong response to therapy and delay
proliferation of resistant populations
(23). This approach requires the dynamic
adjustment of drug dose and timing on
the basis of tumor response, to maintain
a balance between chemoresistant and
chemosensitive cells so that the latter can
suppress the proliferation of the former.
This approach was initially framed math-
ematically and then applied successfully to
ovariancancerxenografts(OVCAR)treated
with carboplatin (23). Because the evolu-
tionary dynamics of tumors are tightly
linked to the microenvironment, we
examined AT in triple-negative (MDA-
MB-231) and ER+ (MCF7) breast cancers
growing orthotopically in the mammary
fat pad of female mice. The MDA-MB-
231 cell line has been studied extensively
and is heterogeneous at the tissue and
cellular levels, typically consisting of a mix-
ture of resistant and sensitive populations
(11, 27–30). The MCF7 cell line, typical of
ER+ tumors, is generally slower-growing,
is weakly invasive, and forms fewer me-
tastaseswhencomparedtotheMDA-MB-231

 line (31). A number of mechanisms for resistance to paclitaxel have
been found in cancers, but an increase in xenobiotic metabolism is most
commonly observedin resistant MDA-MB-231andMCF7celllines(32).
Because the application of evolutionary principles is based on previ-
ous responses to therapy, successful treatment requires continuous, ac-
curate measurement of tumor volume or, more ideally, the mass of
viable tumor cells. In clinical trials, most tumor measurements are per-
formed with cross-sectional imaging. For this reason, we based our
treatment algorithms on tumor volume measured by MRI.
Our results demonstrated that conventional high-dose standard
therapy (ST) could markedly reduce the tumor burden, but complete
eradication was rare. Unlike ST therapy, in which the dose of therapy
was fixed and the tumor size was the outcome variable, AT attempts to
fix the tumor size by constantly adjusting drug dosing. Ideally, this var-
iation in therapy would include both different drugs and doses. Here,
however, for simplicity, we used only paclitaxel and adjusted its dose to
maintain a constant tumor size.
In general, we observed that application of AT is a two-phase pro-
cess. In an induction phase, the exponential growth of the untreated
tumor must be forced to plateau. In the second phase, once tumor con-
trolisestablished, it must be maintained. We findthat successful control
of tumor in each phase requires a different strategy.
In MDA-MB-231 tumors, gaining control of the exponentially
growing tumor proved to be challenging. In control animals, the tumor
typically doubled in volume in 20 days. High-dose density therapy often
markedly reduced the tumor size, but cure was rare. We attempted to
use a dose-skipping (AT-2) approach, reasoning that less frequent treat-
ment could more readily be applied to a clinical setting. However, this
was almost always unsuccessful because the tumor frequently grew un-
controllably during even a single skipped dose. In contrast, we found
that application of therapy with consistent frequency but lowered doses
(AT-1) according to response consistently achieved tumor control.
Nearly identical results were obtained in the initial therapy for the
less-aggressive, ER+ cell line.
The dynamics governing this critical first phase of AT will require
additional investigation. The AT-1 algorithm permitted a higher
cumulative drug dose, so it appears that treatment intensity as well as
timing may be critical factors for gaining initial tumor control. Howev-
er, other issues such as tumor angiogenesis, blood flow, and immune
response are likely to affect outcomes.
In the second phase of therapy, we found that maintaining both
MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 tumors at their plateau could be achieved
fairly readily. As in earlier studies, we observed that control of the cancer
required progressively smaller doses of paclitaxel. Moreover, we found
that even the lowest doses permitted by the algorithm caused continued
decline in the tumor volume. In three of five MCF7 tumors and in six of
seven MDA-MB-231 tumors, the tumor size fell below the treatment
threshold, allowing therapy to be withdrawn, often for >8 treatment de-
cision points, without risking rapid tumor progression (fig. S3).
Having consistently observed that tumors, once controlled, could be
maintained with progressively small drug doses, even permitting with-
drawal of therapy, we pursued further investigations. We hypothesized
that AT strategies, by enforcing a stable
tumor volume, permit relative normaliza-
tion of tumor vascularity, with improved
delivery of nutrients and drugs, which
both reduce invasive growth and allow
chemotherapy to be more effective. Fur-
thermore, repeated application of drugs
targeting proliferating cells may select
for nonproliferative, noninvasive phe-
notypes that promote tissue-like mesen-
chymal organization, including relatively
mature blood vessels. Other studies have,
for example, demonstrated that increased
tumor vascularity is associated with gener-
ally slower tumor growth (18).
DW imaging demonstrated that the
necrotic tumor fraction in MDA-MB-
231 tumors was larger in control, AT-2,
and ST tumors than in AT-1. Further-
more, the necrotic fraction grew progres-
sively smaller during AT-1 treatment so
thatitremainedbelowthatofuntreatedtu-
mors. This was corroborated in the MCF7
tumors. Consistent with this finding, DCE
MRI demonstrated increased flow and
perfusion in both tumor types when trea-
ted with the AT-1 algorithm. These data
were supported by subsequent histological
analysis of the treated tumors at necropsy,
which was consistent with the hypothesis
that enforcing a stable tumor volume and

 AT promote relative normalization of tumor vasculature with in-
creased blood flow and decreased necrosis.
This increased vascular density likely increased drug delivery to the
tumors and may account for the decrease in chemotherapy dose re-
quired to maintain tumor control. However, it is also possible that
the frequent application of a cytotoxic drug that targets cycling cells
selected for a variety of adaptive strategies. For example, it clearly selects
for cells with resistance mechanisms such as up-regulation of the MDR1
gene (33). However, it could also select for tumor cells that are less pro-
liferative and, therefore, less invasive and slower-growing. Future studies
will need to address this question.
Our study results have some limitations that will need to be ad-
dressed in follow-up investigations. In particular, we note that we only
used two breast cancer cell lines. The total number of animals in the
experiments was also relatively small, representing the smallest cohorts
necessary to obtain statistically significant results, consistent with stan-
dard principles of animal experimentation. Furthermore, we were unable
to unambiguously determine the intratumoral evolutionary dynamics of
drug-sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes during treatment.
In summary, we have examined a typical clinical scenario (triple-
negative and ER+ breast cancers treated with paclitaxel) and compared
the response of the tumors to different treatment algorithms. We have
explored a flexible treatment strategy, which varies the drug dosing and
scheduling to maintain a persistent population of sensitive cells and re-
duce the proliferation of resistant popula-
tions. Our results suggest that this adaptive
therapeutic strategy can be adapted to
clinical imaging and can result in pro-
longed progression-free survival in breast
cancer. Finally, we note that the evolution-
ary principles that govern AT may be ap-
plicable to a wide range of breast cancer
treatments including hormonal manipu-
lation and immunotherapy, although they
will need to undergo further testing in
those settings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The aim of this study was to design a cancer
therapy on the basis of evolutionary princi-
ples. We focused our study on breast cancer,
and, thus, we used ER+ and triple-negative
cell lines as preclinical models. Additional
aims included fine-tuning of this evolu-
tionary therapy and the monitoring of
tumor progression by a standard radio-
graphic technique. In all cohorts, the mice
were randomly divided between treat-
ment groups. We have replicated the
experiments with mice bearing the triple-
negative cell line, but not the ER+ cell line
because the latter experiment was per-
formed to confirm that our hypothesis
can apply to different breast cancer mod-
els. All data obtained for this project are
shown in this manuscript, and none were excluded, even if they
were outliers.
Cell culture
Bioluminescent MDA-MB-231/luc cells, which were engineered to ex-
press thermostable firefly luciferase using MDA-MB-231 human breast
cancer cell (34) line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemen-
ted with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone Laboratories) and 1%
antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Gibco Invitrogen). Cells were selected
with 100 ml of G418 per 10 ml of medium.
Fluorescent MCF7/GFP (green fluorescent protein) cells expressing
pcDNA3.1(+)/zeo containing the coding region of GFP (35) were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco Life Technologies), supplemen-
ted with 5% FBS (VWR Seradigm) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin so-
lution (Gibco Life Technologies). Cells were selected with 100 ml of
G418 per 10 ml of medium.
Xenograft model of human breast cancer
Orthotopic mouse xenograft experimental protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Uni-
versity of South Florida. Animals were maintained and evaluated under
pathogen-free conditions in accordance with IACUC standards of care
at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (Tampa, FL). After detachment with
0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Corning Cellgro, Mediatech), MDA-MB-231/luc

and resuspended in phenol red–free 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
in DPBS at 1 × 108 cells/ml. The cell suspension was inoculated (~1 ×
107 cells per mouse) into the mammary fat pads of 6- to 8-week-old
female Nu/Nu mice (Harlan Laboratories).
For experiments with the ER+ cell line (MCF7), 17b-estradiol 90-day
release pellets, 0.72 mg per pellet (Innovative Research of America),
were implanted on the dorsal region of 8-week-old female Nu/Nu mice
(Harlan Laboratories) 1 day before cell injections. The cells were
detached using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Corning, Cellgro, Mediatech)
and then suspended in RPMI 1640 growth medium. The cells were
washed with DPBS (Gibco Life Technologies) twice and resuspended
in 50% phenol red–free Matrigel Matrix (Corning) and 50% DPBS at
2.5 × 107 cells/ml. The cell suspension was inoculated (~5 × 106 cells per
mouse) into the mammary fat pads of the 8-week-old female Nu/Nu mice.
Initially, two-dimensional tumor measurements were made by
calipers twice a week, and the tumor volume was calculated according
to theformula: volume = p (shortdiameter2) × (long diameter)/6.When
the measured tumor volume exceeded 200 mm3, we used MRI for a
more accurate tumor volume monitoring until the end of experiments.
When the tumor volume reached 250 to 300 mm3, mice were
divided into three groups. Control group mice were treated with vehicle
(DPBS) by intraperitoneal injections (Ctrl). The second group of mice
was treated with paclitaxel (LC Laboratories) according to a standard
therapy regimen, 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally, twice per week for 2.5 weeks
(ST). The third group was treated with paclitaxel by AT algorithms as
described below.
Adaptive therapy algorithm with dose modulation (AT-1). After
an administration of the initial dose of 20 mg/kg, the subsequent treat-
ment doses were adjusted on the basis of tumor size measured by MRI
twice a week. The algorithm was similar to the AT strategy previously
reported (8). Drug dose was reduced by 50% of the previously applied
dose if the tumor volume decreased by 20% or more from the previous
volume. However, we increased the drug dose by 50% of the previous
dose if tumor size increased by 20% or more with respect to previous size,
with a maximum dose of 20 mg/kg of paclitaxel in a single treatment. We
repeated the same dose if the tumor size was within the range of ±20%
of the previous volume. We set up a minimum tumor volume cutoff of
150 mm3, below which paclitaxel treatment was skipped until the tumor
size increased again.
Adaptive therapy algorithm with treatment skipping (AT-2).
Starting with a moderate-high dose of paclitaxel (15 mg/kg), the subse-
quent drug treatment was determined on the basis of the percentage of
tumorgrowthrate measuredtwice a week. If thetumorvolume (Tn) was
increased by ≥25% compared to two volume measurements before (Tn−2),
afixeddose(15mg/kg)ofpaclitaxelwasadministered.Thetreatmentwas
skipped if the tumor volume remained constant or reduced with respect
to the two previous measurements. No minimum cutoff was applied.
MRI analysis
Magnetic resonance data were acquired with a 7-T horizontal magnet
Agilent ASR 310 (Agilent Technologies Inc.) equipped with nested 205/
120/HDS gradient insert and a bore size of 310 mm. Before imaging, the
animals were placed in an induction chamber and anesthetized with 2%
isoflurane delivered in 1.5 liter/min oxygen ventilation. Upon complete
induction, animals were restrained in a custom-designed holder and
inserted into the magnet while constantly receiving isoflurane. Body tem-
perature (36° ± 1°C) and respiratory function were monitored continu-
ously (SAII System). A 35-mm Litzcage coil (Doty Scientific) was used to
carry out axial T2-weighted fast spin-echo multislice experiments
[acquired with TE/TR (echo time/repetition time) = 72 ms/1000 ms, field
of view (FOV) = 35 × 35 mm2, matrix = 128 × 128, yielding a spatial in-
planeresolutionof273mm,slicethicknessof1.5mm,andthreeaverages].
Applying the same axial slice plane, a DW sequence was also acquired
using three b values (50, 500, and 1000 s/m2) and TE/TR of 36/1325 ms.
The total acquisition time was always less than 15 min. Images were
reconstructed with VnmrJ software (Agilent Technologies Inc.). Tumor
volumes were obtained from the high-resolution T2-weighted data sets
and measured by manually drawn regions of interest (ROIs) encompass-
ing the entire tumors.
We used an in-house MATLAB program (available upon request) to
obtain volumetric information from the T2-weighted images. The ADC
analysis was performed by nonlinear least-squares regression with tumor
ADCvaluescalculatedbythefollowingequation:S(b)=S(0)exp(−ADC*b),
where b is the diffusion-sensitizing factor, S(b) is the signal intensity as a
function of diffusion weighting, and S(0) is the non-DW intensity (15).
DCE MRI experiments were carried out in the same spectrometer
using a T1 gradient echo multislice experiment (acquired with TE/TR =
4/117 ms). FOV and in-plane geometry were the same as in the T2
experiments. In this case, we took only the six slices in the middle of
the tumors. Imaging started 1 min after injection of contrast agent
(Magnevist, 0.1 mmol/kg) and continued for 20 min. The experiments
were analyzed with AEDES (35) software.
Histological analysis
MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 tumor samples were collected at the comple-
tion of the experiment in the case of tumors with controlled growth, or
when tumors reached a volume of 2000 mm3. After collection, the tu-
mors were processed by soaking in formalin for at least 24 hours and
then embedded in paraffin blocks. Sequential slices of each tumor were
collected for processing with H&E (Abcam) and vascularity (CD31 and
SMA, Abcam) staining. The slices were imaged at the Moffitt Cancer
Center microscope core facilities, using an Aperio ScanScope XT micro-
scope and Aperio Spectrum version 10.2.5.2352 image analytic software
(Leica BiosystemsInc.). To optimize image analysis of the IHC slices, we
trained the algorithm by using ROIs that were selected manually to rep-
resent ROIs that are positive and negative for each stain. After this pro-
cess, the software developed an algorithm that was used to analyze
the slices. After initial algorithm training, the software developed a final
algorithm, which was used to automatically analyze the slides with a
pixel resolution.
Statistical analysis
For volume and necrosis data, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
was performed to evaluate for differences in tumor growth between
AT-1 and AT-2. For analysis of histology data, we used a t test with
one tail and unequal variance.
