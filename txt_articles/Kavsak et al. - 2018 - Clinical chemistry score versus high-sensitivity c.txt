ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Testing for high-sensitivity 
cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) may assist triage 
and clinical decision-making in patients 
presenting to the emergency department 
with symptoms of acute coronary syn-
drome; however, this could result in the 
misclassification of risk because of ana-
lytical variation or laboratory error. We 
sought to evaluate a new laboratory-
based risk-stratification tool that incor-
porates tests for hs-cTn, glucose level and 
estimated glomerular filtration rate to 
identify patients at risk of myocardial 
infarction or death when presenting to 
the emergency department.
METHODS: We constructed the clinical 
chemistry score (CCS) (range 0–5 points) 
and validated it as a predictor of 30-day 
myocardial infarction (MI) or death using 
data from 4 cohort studies involving 
patients who presented to the emergency 
department with symptoms suggestive of 
acute coronary syndrome. We calculated 
diagnostic parameters for the CCS score 
separately using high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin I (hs-cTnI) and high-sensitivity 
cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT).
RESULTS: For the combined cohorts (n = 
4245), 17.1% of participants had an MI or 
died within 30 days. A CCS score of 0 points 
best identified low-risk participants: the 
hs-cTnI CCS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 99.5%–100%), with 
8.9% (95% CI 8.1%–9.8%) of the popula-
tion classified as being at low risk of MI or 
death within 30 days; the hs-cTnT CCS had 
a sensitivity of 99.9% (95% CI 99.2%–
100%), with 10.5% (95% CI 9.6%–11.4%) of 
the population classified as being at low 
risk. The CCS had better sensitivity than hs-
cTn alone (hs-cTnI < 5 ng/L: 96.6%, 95% CI 
95.0%–97.8%; hs-cTnT < 6 ng/L: 98.2%, 
95% CI 97.0%–99.0%). A CCS score of 
5 points best identified patients at high risk 
(hs-cTnI CCS: specificity 96.6%, 95% CI 
96.0%–97.2%; 11.2% [95% CI 10.3%–
12.2%] of the population classified as 
being at high risk; hs-cTnT CCS: specificity 
94.0%, 95% CI 93.1%–94.7%; 13.1% [95% 
CI 12.1%–14.1%] of the population classi-
fied as being at high risk) compared with 
using the overall 99th percentiles for the 
hs-cTn assays (specificity of hs-cTnI 93.2%, 
95% CI 92.3–94.0; specificity of hs-cTnT 
73.8%, 95% CI 72.3–75.2).
INTERPRETATION: The CCS score at the 
chosen cut-offs was more sensitive 
and specific than hs-cTn alone for risk 
stratification of patients presenting to 
the emergency department with sus-
pected acute coronary syndrome.

acceptable; yet, this variation will reclassify patients using 
the published algorithms.4–6 In practice, different lots of 
reagents for both hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT have already been 
observed to yield variation that exceeds 3 ng/L.7,8 In addition, 
there are several interferences that affect hs-cTn measure-
ments.9,10 Together, this necessitates improved laboratory 
health services to aid physicians in evaluating patients with 
possible acute coronary syndrome.
We have previously assessed the utility and cost-effectiveness 
of combining assessment of the glucose level with hs-cTn con-
centrations for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI) in the 
emergency department.11,12 While this dual-marker approach 
was cost-effective compared with hs-cTn alone, it was found to 
be suboptimal for short-term risk stratification. For risk stratifi-
cation based on laboratory services to be accepted into prac-
tice, it must be easy to implement and involve only validated 
laboratory tests that are widely and routinely measured in 
patients presenting with symptoms of acute coronary syn-
drome and also safe.
In an effort to have a robust laboratory service to aid phys-
icians and reassure patients in the emergency department set-
ting, we have developed a laboratory medicine test score using 
common clinical chemistry tests (i.e., a clinical chemistry score 
[CCS]) for MI or death at 30 d). This score encompasses the 
measurement of hs-cTn concentration, glucose level and esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), with eGFR also provid-
ing important prognostic information in this setting.13 Specif-
ically, for ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), high glucose 
concentrations at admission to the emergency department 
identify patients who are more hemodynamically unstable, 
have a larger infarct size and have a high 30-day mortality.14 
Moreover, eGFR calculated by the CKD-EPI creatinine equation 
has been shown to be an independent predictor of major 
adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with acute coronary syn-
drome.15 We previously assessed the utility of hematologic vari-
ables in addition to the clinical chemistry tests.16 However, as 
our goal was to develop a simple algorithm that could be vali-
dated externally across different continents, we decided to 
limit the algorithm to these 3 clinical chemistry tests that are 
available in most populations of patients with chest pain in the 
emergency department. A recent publication using machine 
learning for predicting 30-day mortality after STEMI ranked cre-
atinine and glucose among the top 3 variables (and top 2 lab-
oratory tests) using classifier-based machine-learning algo-
rithms,17 which further supports the inclusion of eGFR, glucose 
and hs-cTn in assessing patients with possible non–ST-elevation 
acute coronary syndrome.
In the present study, we tested and assessed the CCS in 
patients without STEMI who presented to the emergency depart-
ment, across different populations from North America, Europe 
and Australasia, to determine if score thresholds resulted in suffi-
cient sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) to safely 
identify patients at low risk. We assessed whether the CCS could 
achieve a sensitivity greater than 99.0% for MI or death at 30 days 
as this is an estimate that most physicians in the emergency 
department consider as safe for discharge.18 We also evaluated 
whether the score had sufficient positive predictive value (PPV) 
and specificity to identify patients at high risk who may benefit 
from early management.
Methods
Study design and participants
Validation of the performance of the CCS test was a post hoc 
analysis performed in 4 emergency department populations in 
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (Hamilton General Hospital and 
Juravinski Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, and St. Joseph’s 
Healthcare Hamilton); Brisbane, Australia (Royal Brisbane and 
Women’s Hospital); Christchurch, New Zealand (Christchurch 
Hospital); and Hamburg, Germany (University Hospital Hamburg-
Eppendorf, University Heart Center Hamburg). Briefly, patients in 
the emergency department who were enrolled in all 4 studies 
had symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (patients 
with STEMI were excluded), with measurement of both glucose 
and creatinine levels at presentation as part of routine care 
(Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.180144/-/DC1; additional details of the study 
methods, Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.180144/-/DC1).19–23
Health outcomes
The primary outcome was 30-day MI24 or all-cause death. Sec-
ondary outcomes included index MI, 30-day revascularization 
rate (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery 
bypass graft) and 30-day composite of unstable angina, MI or all-
cause death (values for unstable angina were not available for 
the Hamburg cohort) (Appendix 2).
Assay methods and clinical chemistry score
Standard acceptable laboratory methods were used to measure 
glucose and creatinine levels (used to calculate eGFR). Both the 
Roche Elecsys Troponin T hs and Abbott ARCHITECT High Sensi-
tive Troponin-I assays used in these studies met the most recent 
laboratory recommendations for total analytic error for hs-cTn 
assays6 (Appendix 2).
The approach to developing the CCS was pragmatic, using 
equal weighting for eGFR and glucose, and using established and 
recognized cut-offs for normality for these tests. For hs-cTn, the 
weighting was based on the graded risk and on analytical perfor-
mance characteristics of the assays. Briefly, the CCS included 
glucose, eGFR and hs-cTnT or hs-cTnI (i.e., CCS with hs-cTnT or 
CCS with hs-cTnI, respectively, as clinical laboratories will typ-
ically report only one hs-cTn test) (Box 1). The cut-offs used for 
each test were based on accepted normal levels and low-risk 
clinical cut points, with values of eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 
more, glucose of less than 5.6 mmol/L, hs-cTnI of less than 4 ng/L 
and of hs-cTnT less than 8 ng/L used to identify patients at low 
risk (i.e., abnormal value 1 point and normal 0 points).13,25–27 For 
hs-cTn, 2 additional cut points were selected based on analytical 
variation, population and health outcome studies,26–32 to have a 
final CCS range of 0–5 points (i.e., sum of the points for the 
results for glucose, eGFR and hs-cTn obtained from the patient’s

plemental Table 1, Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.180144/-/DC1).
Statistical analyses
We first tested the CCS algorithm in the Hamilton cohort for risk 
stratification, with the expectation that a CCS closer to 0 points 
(all laboratory results were normal) would be suggestive of low 
risk (with scores that yielded about a 1% outcome rate evaluated 
further) and a CCS closer to 5 points would be suggestive of high 
risk (all laboratory results were abnormal with scores that 
yielded about a 50% outcome rate evaluated further). First, we 
used test parameters (sensitivity and specificity) to identify pos-
sible CCS cut-offs for 30-day MI and death via Kaplan–Meier sur-
vival analysis, and then the Cox proportional hazards model to 
provide hazard ratios (HRs; adjusted for age, sex, family history, 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and 
smoking status)19 to support the selected cut-offs. The selected 
CCS cutoffs were then applied to the other 3 population cohorts 
to assess sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and likelihood ratios. In 
this regard, we provided the CCS algorithm to each site to deter-
mine the test performance and descriptive statistics for their 
emergency department cohort.
We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and likeli-
hood ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each cohort 
as well as for the combined population (by adding the number of 
participants in each cohort) for the low- and high-risk CCS cut-
offs. We performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis for the CCS algorithms for each emergency department 
population, including sex-specific analysis that assessed the CCS 
algorithms for the primary outcome, with comparison to hs-cTn 
concentration alone (low risk: hs-cTnI < 5 ng/L or hs-cTnT 
< 6 ng/L; high risk [overall 99th percentiles]: hs-cTnI > 26 ng/L or 
hs-cTnT > 14 ng/L)3,30,33 in the overall emergency department 
population. We generated the ROC curves based on data without 
smoothing, and we calculated the area under the ROC curves 
(AUC) correspondingly. We performed the statistical analysis 
using SAS 9.4, MedCalc statistical software, Graphpad prism, 
R3.2.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing) and StatsDirect sta-
tistical software.
Ethics approval
This study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research 
Ethics Board, the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital Human 
Research Ethics Committee, the New Zealand Health and Disabil-
ity Ethics Committee, and the local ethics board of Hamburg 
(Ethics committee of the Ärztekammer Hamburg, Germany). We 
followed the Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy 
Studies guideline.
Results
We included 4245 participants in this study, with 727 (17.1%) hav-
ing the primary outcome (30-d MI or all-cause death). The preva-
lence of the primary outcome was different between the cohorts 
(p < 0.001), with the Brisbane cohort (n = 795) having the lowest 
prevalence at 6%, followed by the Hamilton cohort (n = 1092) at 
16%, the Hamburg cohort (n = 1412) at 20%, and the Christchurch 
cohort at 24% (Table 1). A higher percentage of males were 
enrolled at the Brisbane, Christchurch and Hamburg sites (≥ 60% 
of the 3 cohorts) compared with the Hamilton site (< 50% males). 
Nearly 30% of participants in the Hamilton cohort had diabetes 
compared with less than 20% in the 3 other cohorts.
In the Canadian test population (Hamilton), the lower the 
CCS, the lower the rates of MI or death over 30 days (i.e., the pri-
mary outcome, Supplemental Figure 2, Appendix 1). In the Ham-
ilton cohort, a CCS value less than 1 yielded 100% sensitivity, less 
than 2 yielded a sensitivity of 99% and less than 3 a sensitivity of 
93% for the primary outcome using either hs-cTnI or hs-cTnT 
(Supplemental Figure 3, Appendix 1). A CCS of 4 points or more 
yielded a specificity of 85% with hs-cTnI and 76% with hs-cTnT, 
whereas a CCS of 5 points yielded a specificity of 96% with hs-
cTnI and 90% with hs-cTnT. Participants with a CCS of 5 points, 
reflecting abnormal results for all laboratory tests, represented a 
high-risk group, with an adjusted HR for patients with a CCS of 
5 points versus those with a CCS of less than 5 points of 4.63

(95% CI 3.31–6.47) with CCS hs-cTnT and 7.46 (95% CI 5.38–10.36) 
with CCS hs-cTnI.
The analytical performances of the hs-cTn assays in the 
4 cohorts were in agreement with laboratory recommendations 
for hs-cTn assays (i.e., > 50% above the limit of detection);6 the 
range of detectable hs-cTnI concentrations was 84%–94% and 
that for hs-cTnT concentrations was 64%–84% (Table 1). And 
across all 4 cohorts, the higher the CCS, the older the partici-
pant’s age, the higher the hs-cTn level, the higher the glucose 
level and the lower the eGFR (Table 2). The prevalence of the pri-
mary outcome varied between the cohorts and hs-cTn assays, 
with about 50%–90% of participants with a CCS of 5 points hav-
ing the outcome. However, among all participants in the 4 
cohorts with normal laboratory results and a CCS of 0, there was 
only 1 participant (male) who had testing with both hs-cTn 
assays and who had the primary outcome. The AUCs for CCS 
were higher in the Brisbane (hs-cTnI CCS AUC 0.95, 95% CI 0.93–
0.97; hs-cTnT CCS AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.87–0.94) and Christchurch 
(hs-cTnI CCS AUC 0.94, 95% CI 0.92–0.95; hs-cTnT CCS AUC 0.90, 
95% CI 0.87–0.92) cohorts compared with the Hamilton (hs-cTnI 
CCS AUC 0.87, 95% CI 0.85–0.89; hs-cTnT CCS AUC 0.83, 95% CI 
0.81–0.85) and Hamburg (hs-cTnI CCS AUC 0.86, 95% CI 0.85–
0.89; hs-cTnT CCS AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.81–0.86) cohorts (Supple-
mental Figure 3, Appendix 1).
In the Hamilton cohort, the sensitivity for a CCS of 0 points 
was 100% (95% CI 97.9%–100%) with hs-cTnI (Table 3) and with 
hs-cTnT (Table 4). A CCS of 1 point yielded a sensitivity close to 
99% with both hs-cTn assays. The specificity of a CCS of 5 points 
was higher for hs-cTnI CCS (95.6%, 95% CI 94.1%–96.9%) than for 
hs-cTnT CCS (90.4%, 95% CI 88.3%–92.2%).
The sensitivity of a CCS of 0 points in the Brisbane, Christchurch 
and Hamburg cohorts with hs-cTnI was 100% (Table 3). In each of 
these cohorts, the point-estimate specificity was greater than 95% 
with an hs-cTnI CCS of 5 points. For a hs-cTnT CCS of 0 points, the 
point-estimate sensitivity was greater than 99.5%; the point-estimate 
specificity of a CCS of 5 points with the hs-cTnT assay was greater 
than 93.9% across the 3 non–North American cohorts (Table 4). A 
CCS of 1 point did not consistently achieve sensitivities greater than 
99%, with the hs-cTnT CCS of 1 yielding sensitivities of 98% or less in 
the 3 non–North American cohorts.
Combining all 4 cohort populations (n = 4245 participants), 
a CCS of 0 points yielded a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 99.5%–
100%) with no false negatives with hs-cTnI, and a sensitivity of 
99.9% (95% CI 99.2%–100%) with 1 false negative with hs-cTnT 
(Table 5). Because the sensitivity estimates are greater than 
99.0%, 378 participants (8.9% of the population) would be 
classified as low risk using hs-cTnI with CCS and 444 partici-
pants (10.5% of the population) using hs-cTnT with CCS. 
Applying a cut-off value for hs-cTnI of less than 5 ng/L alone, 
the sensitivity was 96.6% (95% CI 95.0%–97.8%) with 25 false 
negatives, and for hs-cTnT of less than 6 ng/L alone, the sensi-
tivity was 98.2% (95% CI 97.0%–99.0%) with 13 false negatives. 
The specificity of a CCS of 5 points was 96.6% (95% CI 96.0%–
97.2%) with a PPV of 75.1% (95% CI 71.3%–78.5%) for hs-cTnI, 
and a specificity of 94.0% (95% CI 93.1%–94.7%) with a PPV of 
61.7% (95% CI 58.1%–65.2%) for hs-cTnT. Applying the overall 
99th percentile as the cut-off, the specificity was lower for hs-
cTnI (> 26 ng/L) at 93.2% (95% CI 92.3–94.0) and for hs-cTnT 
(> 14 ng/L) at 73.8% (95% CI 72.3–75.2) compared with the 
respective CCSs of 5.

Assessing the performance of the CCS with regard to sex, in 
women, the specificity for the primary outcome was higher 
with a CCS of 5 (hs-cTnI CCS specificity 96.4%, 95% CI 95.3–
97.3; hs-cTnT CCS specificity 94.4%, 95% CI 93.1–95.5) com-
pared with using the overall 99th percentile hs-cTn cut-offs 
(hs-cTnI specificity 93.6%, 95% CI 92.3–94.8; hs-cTnT specifi-
city 76.1%, 95% CI 73.9–78.2). Higher specificity with a CCS of 
5 was evident in men as well (Supplemental Table 2, Appen-
dix 3). Overall, there were no obvious differences between 
men and women in the performance of the CCS for the pri-
mary outcome.
For the secondary outcomes, the CCS algorithms also out-
performed testing for hs-cTn alone for the index MI diagnosis 
(i.e., higher sensitivity and higher specificity; Supplemental

Table 3, Appendix 3). With respect to interventions, there was 
nearly a doubling per score in the revascularization rate, with a 
hs-cTnI CCS of 0 yielding 0.79% (95% CI 0.16–2.32) compared 
with a hs-cTnI CCS of 5 with 26.2% (95% CI 21.8–31.2) revascu-
larization rate (p > 0.05 between hs-cTnI CCS and hs-cTnT CCS;

95% CI 97.6–99.5) were significantly higher than those for hs-
cTn alone (sensitivity for hs-cTnI < 5 ng/L 87.7%, 95% CI 84.8–
90.2; for hs-cTnT < 6 ng/L 93.0%, 95% CI 90.6–94.9). The speci-
ficity of a CCS of 5 was also significantly higher than using the 
overall 99th percentiles of hs-cTn (Supplemental Table 4, 
Appendix 3).
Interpretation
The CCS coupled with other existing accelerated diagnostic path-
ways1,30,34 may further identify patients at low and high risk of MI 
or death on presentation to the emergency department. 
The goal for electrocardiograms, testing for laboratory bio-
markers and clinical algorithms when patients present to the 
emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute cor-
onary syndrome is both diagnostic and for risk stratification. For 
identifying low-risk patients who may be suitable for discharge, 
many different approaches have been proposed, with the sim-
plest being a low or undetectable hs-cTn concentration.2,3 Despite 
the ease of these approaches, using hs-cTn alone has not reliably 
achieved a sensitivity greater than 99.0% to safely rule out MI and 
discharge patients presenting to the emergency department in 
large populations.2,3 At the other extreme, for rule in of MI and 
identifying patients at high risk who require hospital admission, 
besides the use of electrocardiograms, algorithms that have used 
hs-cTn tests alone use cut-offs that are several-fold higher than 
the published 99th percentiles.35 The required specificity or PPV 
for algorithms to identify patients at high risk have not undergone 
the same methodological approach as the sensitivity estimate.30

Our proposed CCS includes measurements and cut-offs for 
accepted normality for glucose and eGFR, and includes measur-
able normal concentrations of hs-cTn, all of which permits clin-
ical laboratories to monitor these cut-offs with quality control 
procedures to ensure reliable and accurate results. These are 
essential elements for the provision of optimal laboratory ser-
vices. Algorithms that use the lower limit of reporting, such as 
the limit of detection, for hs-cTn assays are approaches that pose 
a safety risk for patients, because this metric is not monitored by 
clinical laboratories and is subject to analytical bias, with wide 
variation on repeat measurements on different instruments and 
different lots of reagents; all of which may lead to patient mis-
classification.4,6–8,36 Just as important is that there is no standard-
ization on reporting at the low end: in a 2018 quality survey, 
undetectable ranges were reported from clinical laboratories 
that ranged from less than 1 to less than 10 ng/L for the Abbott 
hs-cTnI assay and less than 3 to less than 13 ng/L for the Roche 
hs-cTnT assay.37 In this regard, physicians using “undetectable 
concentrations” will misclassify patients depending on how the 
clinical laboratory reports their results, if they use results from 
hs-cTn testing alone.
We based the inclusion of different concentration ranges for 
different hs-cTn scores on published low-risk cutoffs, clinical out-
comes, observed analytical variation and different 99th percen-
tiles.19,26–32 Importantly, these concentrations can be monitored 
by laboratories via different quality assurance procedures, which 
will mitigate misclassification of patients owing to unacceptable 
analytical variation.5,38 The CCS was reproducible across different 
sample types (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma, lithium 
heparin plasma and serum), and under different storage and pre-
analytical conditions, which should be reassuring to physicians 
and clinical laboratories, because hs-cTn measurements alone 
can be affected by different blood collection tubes and preana-
lytical interferences.6,39 Some of these preanalytical sources of 
variation easily exceed the analytical imprecision benchmark of 
10% for hs-cTn assays, and despite attempts to sensitize the clin-
ical community to the importance of this matter, it still repre-
sents a substantial gap in optimizing patient care.6,39
Adoption of the CCS algorithm would standardize reporting of 
hs-cTn test results, how the tests are interpreted in the normal 
range, and represent an option less susceptible to both analyt-
ical and preanalytical errors. This could result in the safest lab-
oratory approach for physicians to use at presentation in the 
emergency department. Specifically, for physicians who do not 
want to miss an outcome or patients who want reassurance that 
they are at low risk after the first blood draw, a CCS of 0 would 
safely classify close to 10% of the population in the emergency 
department who present with symptoms of acute coronary syn-
drome as being at low risk for unstable angina, MI, revasculariza-
tion procedures and death. Those with a CCS of 5 points would 
be at high risk, with the remaining patients needing additional 
serial testing of hs-cTn using the 0/1 hour, 0/2 hour or 0/3 hour 
blood sampling protocols.30,34
Limitations
First, only about 10% of patients would be considered to be at low 
risk; this is similar to other studies rendering results for hs-cTn tests 
as detectable versus nondetectable.3 However, as hs-cTn assays 
become even more analytically sensitive and precise at lower 
concentrations, it will be expected that all individuals will have a 
detectable concentration of cardiac troponin, which would make 
this cut-off obsolete. Second, we elected to assess outcomes only 
to 30 days after presentation to the emergency department. A 
 
longer-term outcome assessment may be beneficial for some clin-
icians, but an acute outcome within 30 days of presentation to the 
emergency department might be sufficient for those physicians

involved in the setting of acute care. Third, despite our intention 
to use MI as a common outcome across the cohorts, we empha-
size that each site employed different cardiac troponin assays 
and change criteria (i.e., rise or fall of cardiac troponin levels) for 
the adjudication of MI. Only a prospective study using the same 
cardiac troponin assay, the same rise/fall change criteria in car-
diac troponin levels, and adjudication criteria would ensure that 
the patients were assessed in a similar manner across the differ-
ent sites.
Conclusion
A CCS of 0 points, indicating that all laboratory test levels are 
normal, can achieve the clinically recommended sensitivity of 
greater than 99.0% for 30-day MI and death, and can identify 
about 10% of patients as at low risk and suitable for discharge 
in the acute care setting. A CCS of 5 points, indicating that all 
laboratory test levels are abnormal, can identify patients at 
high risk who are suitable for hospital admission and evalua-
tion, with about 10% of patients identified as being at high 
risk. The similar performance of the CCS using either hs-cTnI or 
hs-cTnT in different geographical locations and emergency 
department populations calls for a clinical study to evaluate its 
clinical effectiveness prospectively.
