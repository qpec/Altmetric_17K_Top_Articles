Abstract
Instinctive reactions to danger are critical to the perpetuation of species and are observed 
throughout the animal kingdom. The scent of predators induces an instinctive fear response in 
mice that includes behavioral changes as well as a surge in blood stress hormones that mobilizes 
multiple body systems to escape impending danger1,2. How the olfactory system routes predator 
signals detected in the nose to achieve these effects is unknown. Here we identify a specific area of 
the olfactory cortex that induces stress hormone responses to volatile predator odors. Using 
monosynaptic and polysynaptic viral tracers, we found that multiple olfactory cortical areas 
transmit signals to hypothalamic CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) neurons, which control 
stress hormone levels. However, only one minor cortical area, the amygdalo-piriform transition 
area (AmPir), contained neurons upstream of CRH neurons that were activated by volatile predator 
odors. Chemogenetic stimulation of AmPir activated CRH neurons and induced an increase in 
blood stress hormone, mimicking an instinctive fear response. Moreover, chemogenetic silencing 
of AmPir markedly reduced the stress hormone response to predator odors without affecting a fear 
behavior. These findings suggest that AmPir, a small area comprising <5% of the olfactory cortex, 
plays a key role in the hormonal component of the instinctive fear response to volatile predator 
scents.
Animals sense environmental dangers that challenge their survival and respond with 
behavioral and physiological changes to eliminate the challenge. The olfactory system

 detects chemical cues emitted from predators that signal danger and stimulate an instinctive 
fear response. In addition to characteristic behaviors, this response includes increases in 
blood stress hormones that are reminiscent of responses to fear and stress in humans and are 
controlled by CRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN)1–3. 
The neural circuits that convey predator odor signals from the nose to CRH neurons are 
presently unknown.
Volatile predator cues are detected in the olfactory epithelium of the nose, which also detects 
common odorants, whereas fear-stimulating proteins are detected in the vomeronasal organ 
(VNO), an accessory olfactory structure4,5. Sensory signals travel from the nose through the 
olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex (OC) and from the VNO through the accessory 
olfactory bulb to the vomeronasal amygdala (VA)6,7. The mouse nose has ~1000 different 
odorant receptors, each expressed by a unique subset of dispersed sensory neurons8–11. The 
olfactory bulb contains a semi-stereotyped map of receptor inputs in which individual 
glomeruli and projection neurons appear dedicated to one receptor12–14, but single bulb 
neurons can project widely in the OC15–17. The OC comprises multiple distinct areas whose 
respective functions are largely obscure6,7. Recent studies have linked an amygdala OC area 
to odor attraction and aversion18. Here, we investigated whether a specific OC area governs 
stress hormone responses to predator odors.
We first asked what OC areas can transmit signals to CRH neurons. We developed two Cre 
recombinase-dependent Bartha pseudorabies viruses (PRVs) that have nonfunctional 
thymidine kinase (TK) genes, but require TK to replicate and travel retrogradely across 
synapses19,20, and a lentivirus (LVF2TK) with Cre-dependent expression of hemagglutinin-
tagged TK (HA-TK) (Fig. 1a). PRVB177 is a “polysynaptic PRV” with irreversible Cre-
dependent expression of HA-TK that can cross multiple sequential synapses. PRVB316 is a 
“monosynaptic PRV” with Cre-dependent expression of GFP that can replicate in neurons 
coinfected with LVF2TK and spread across one synapse, but not further. We injected the 
viruses into the PVN of mice that express Cre in CRH neurons (CRH-ires-Cre (CRH-Cre) 
mice)21 (Fig. 1b) and then immunostained brain sections for (HA (PRVB177) or GFP 
(PRVB316)) to visualize virus-infected neurons.
Preliminary experiments confirmed that Cre is expressed in PVN CRH neurons in CRH-Cre 
mice and that the viruses function as expected. In CRH-Cre mice crossed with Rosa-
floxstop-GFP mice, 93.9±0.5% of GFP+ cells expressed CRH (n=4) (Extended Data Fig. 
1a). Following PVN coinjection of PRVB316 and LVF2TK, some neurons expressed both 
viruses (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Neurons infected with PRVB316, but not LVF2TK, were 
subsequently detected outside the PVN, whereas none were detected outside the PVN when 
PRVB316 was injected without LVF2TK (Extended Data Fig. 1c). No infected neurons were 
seen in wildtype (WT) animals injected with the monosynaptic or polysynaptic PRV 
(Extended Data Fig. 1c, d).
Virus-infected neurons were detected in multiple brain areas following PRV infection of 
CRH neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2, 3). The monosynaptic PRV (PRVB316) infected 31 
brain areas, including areas known to project axons to the PVN22 and areas linked to CRH 
neuron activation by certain non-olfactory stressors3.

 In the olfactory system (Fig. 1c), PRVB316 infected only the posterior medial amygdala 
(MEAp), part of the VA (Fig. 1d, e), whereas, by day 4 after injection, PRVB177 infected 
five OC and both VA areas (Fig. 1d, f, g). Most brain areas infected with PRVB177 on day 3 
were also infected by PRVB316 (Extended Data Fig. 2, 3), suggesting that OC areas infected 
on day 4 may transmit signals to CRH neurons via one intermediate relay.
We observed a regional bias in the locations of neurons upstream of CRH neurons in some 
olfactory areas, but not others. PRVB177+ neurons were randomly distributed along the 
anterior-posterior axis in most olfactory areas, but were concentrated in posterior regions of 
the posterior piriform cortex (pPir) and amydalo-piriform transition area (AmPir) and in the 
posteroventral quadrant of the MEA (MEApv) (Extended Data Fig. 4).
Dual labeling for PRVB177 and markers of excitatory glutamatergic neurons (Vglut1/2) or 
inhibitory GABAergic neurons (Gad1/2) indicated that some neurons upstream of CRH 
neurons in the MEA were GABAergic, but the majority of those labeled for the markers in 
higher olfactory areas were glutamatergic (Extended Data Fig. 5). The glutamatergic 
neurons could potentially activate either excitatory or inhibitory neurons directly presynaptic 
to CRH neurons in other brain areas, and thus either stimulate or inhibit CRH neurons.
Neurons upstream of CRH neurons in different OC areas could conceivably transmit 
redundant predator odor signals to CRH neurons. To investigate this possibility, we used a 
neural activity marker, nuclear Arc mRNA (nArc)23 to identify PRVB177-infected neurons 
activated by the fox predator odorant, 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5- trimethylthiazoline (TMT)4,24 or 
bobcat (predator) urine. Preliminary experiments confirmed that TMT and bobcat urine, but 
not nonpredator (rabbit) urine, induce the activity marker c-Fos in PVN CRH neurons and 
increase blood levels of the stress hormones ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) and 
corticosterone (Extended Data Fig. 6).
Surprisingly, both predator odors induced a significant increase in nArc in PRV+ neurons in 
only one OC area, AmPir (Fig. 2). The percentage of AmPir PRV+ neurons expressing nArc 
was increased 5.8-fold by TMT and 4.9-fold by bobcat urine, whereas rabbit urine had no 
significant effect. These results suggested that AmPir could play an important part in 
hormonal fear responses to volatile predator odors.
To explore this idea, we first asked if chemogenetic activation of AmPir induces stress 
hormone increases. We injected the adeno-associated virus (AAV), AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-
mCherry25 bilaterally into the AmPir, pPir, or MEA of mice expressing Cre in projection 
neurons (Emx1-ires-Cre or Vglut2-ires-Cre mice)26,27 (Fig. 3a–d). This virus has Cre-
dependent expression of mCherry fused to hM3Dq, a receptor that depolarizes neurons upon 
binding its pharmacologically inert ligand, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)28. We then injected 
animals with CNO or saline and measured plasma ACTH.
Chemogenetic activation of AmPir induced a striking (7.6-fold) increase in plasma ACTH 
(Fig. 3e). Activation of MEA, but not pPir, also increased plasma ACTH. Consistent with 
these results, activation of AmPir or MEA also induced c-Fos in PVN CRH neurons (Fig. 3f, 
g). Additional analyses showed that mCherry+ (AAV-infected) neurons were present in a 
large part of each targeted area (Extended Data Fig. 7) and that CNO induced nArc in

 neurons in each injected area (Fig. 3h, i). Those in AmPir could include neurons responsive 
to TMT or bobcat urine as well as neurons activated by other odorants. Due to the relatively 
small size of AmPir, infected neurons were also often seen in immediately adjacent olfactory 
areas (parts of the posterior PLCo and lateral PMCo). These results indicated that activation 
of neurons in and around AmPir induces a stress hormone response that mimics the 
instinctive fear response.
We next used chemogenetic silencing to ask whether the AmPir is required for stress 
hormone responses to predator odors. We injected the AmPir of Emx1-Cre mice bilaterally 
with AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry25 (Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). This virus has 
Cre-dependent expression of hM4Di, which silences neurons upon binding to CNO28. We 
subsequently injected animals with CNO or saline, exposed to predator odors, and then 
determined plasma levels of stress hormones.
Silencing of AmPir dramatically reduced stress hormone responses to predator odors (Fig. 
4d). Plasma ACTH responses to TMT and bobcat urine were decreased by 52±11% and 
55±02%, respectively (Fig. 4d). These decreases correlated with reductions of 58±03% and 
65±04% in the percentages of AmPir neurons activated by TMT and bobcat urine, as 
assessed by nArc labeling (Extended Data Fig. 9a, b). AmPir silencing also decreased 
plasma corticosterone (Fig. 4e) and the percentage of c-Fos+ PVN CRH neurons observed 
following predator odor exposure (Fig. 4f). These results suggested that neurons in AmPir 
are required for full predator odor-induced increases in stress hormones.
To examine whether adjacent PLCo/PMCo regions were involved in the silencing effects 
observed for AmPir, we injected AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry selectively into these regions, 
but not AmPir (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 8c). In sharp contrast to silencing of AmPir, 
silencing of these regions did not affect predator odor-induced increases in ACTH and 
corticosterone or CRH neuron activation (Fig. 4d–f, Extended Data Fig. 9c). These results 
clearly indicate that AmPir, but not adjacent regions of the PLCo or PMCo, is involved in 
predator odor-induced hormonal fear responses.
Interestingly, AmPir silencing did not affect the “freezing” behavior (immobilization) 
induced by bobcat urine or TMT, a typical fear behavior caused by predator odors (Fig. 4g). 
A recent study showed that inhibition of neurons in PLCo reduced freezing behavior to 
TMT18. Given the effects of AmPir silencing on stress hormone responses to predator odors, 
these findings suggest that different OC areas may be involved in the behavioral versus 
hormonal effects of predator odors, with AmPir and PLCo playing major roles in their 
hormonal and behavioral effects, respectively.
Instinctive fear responses to predator odors are observed in naïve animals, suggesting the 
involvement of stereotyped olfactory circuits. We have used a combination of monosynaptic 
and polysynaptic viral tracing, indicators of neuronal activation, and chemogenetic 
activation and silencing to investigate how the olfactory cortex translates volatile predator 
odor signals from the nose into a hormonal fear response. These studies implicate only one 
small area of the olfactory cortex in this response, the AmPir. They reveal that neurons in 
multiple olfactory cortical areas can transmit signals to CRH neurons that control stress

 hormones, but that fox and bobcat predator odors significantly activate only those in AmPir. 
Chemogenetic activation of AmPir induces stress hormone increases and its silencing causes 
a striking decrease in the stress hormone response to predator odors. Together, these findings 
suggest that AmPir plays a key role in generating hormonal fear responses to volatile 
predator cues that signal danger. The functions of neurons upstream of CRH neurons in 
other olfactory cortical areas are unknown. They might also contribute to stress hormone 
responses. However, given that rose oil can block stress hormone responses to a predator 
odor29, it is also conceivable that some transmit signals that suppress rather than activate 
hormonal responses associated with fear.
Methods
Mice
CRH-ires-Cre mice were generated previously21. C57BL/6J wild type mice, Emx1-ires-Cre 
and Vglut2-ires-Cre knock-in mice, and Rosa-floxstop-GFP reporter mice were purchased 
from the Jackson Laboratory. All procedures involving mice were approved by the Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
We used both males and females in all experiments, with similar numbers where possible. 
The same number of each sex was used in experiments in Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs 2, 
3, 5 and 6.
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Animals were randomly 
chosen for experimental subjects. Animals were excluded from certain experiments. For Arc 
experiments in Fig. 2, animals were excluded if PRV+ cells were not found in all 5 OC and 3 
VA areas analyzed. For chemogenetic activation or silencing of AmPir, animals were 
excluded if more than approximately 50% of mCherry+ cells were observed outside the 
AmPir.
Viral vectors
PRVs—PRVB177 and PRVB316 were constructed using homologous recombination 
between targeting vectors and genomic DNA of PRV TK-BaBlu, a thymidine kinase (TK)-
deleted PRV Bartha strain derivative with a LacZ insertion into the gG locus20. For targeting 
vectors, a flexstop-flanked sequence31 encoding a PRV TK fused at its C-terminus to a 
hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (for PRVB177), or EGFP (for PRVB316), was first cloned 
with an inverse orientation into an EGFP-deleted pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Next, NsiI 
fragments containing a CMV promoter, the flexstop-flanked coding sequence, and a SV40 
polyadenylation signal, were cloned between gG locus sequences matching those 5′ and 3′ 
to the lacZ sequence in PRV TK-BaBlu to give the final targeting vectors. These vectors 
were then linearized and co-transfected with PRV TK-BaBlu genomic DNA into HEK 293T 
cells (ATCC). Recombinant virus clones were selected and confirmed following methods 
described previously32.
To propagate recombinant PRVs, PK15 cells (ATCC) were infected with the viruses using a 
multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) = 0.1~0.01. After infected, cells showed a prominent 
cytopathic effect (~2 days). They were harvested by scraping, and the cell material was

 frozen using liquid nitrogen and then quickly thawed in a 37°C water bath. After three 
freeze-thaw cycles, cell debris was removed by centrifugation twice at 1000 × g for 5 
minutes and the supernatant was then used for experiments. The titer of viral stocks was 
determined using standard plaque assays on PK15 cells19, with titers expressed in plaque-
forming units (PFU).
Lentivirus—To generate LVF2TK, a flexstop-flanked sequence encoding TK-HA (see 
above) was cloned into the pLenti6.3 vector (Thermo Fisher). LVF2TK was produced using 
the ViraPower HiPerform Lentiviral Expression System (Thermo Fisher) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Virus was concentrated using ultracentrifugation as described 
previously33. Viral titer was measured using the UltraRapid Lentiviral Titer Kit (System 
Biosciences) and titers described in infectious units (IFU).
AAVs—Serotype 8 AAVs with Cre recombinase-dependent flexstop cassettes that permit 
expression of mCherry-fused hM3Dq or mCherry-fused hM4Di under the control of the 
human synapsin promoter (AAV8-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry or AAV8-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry) 
were purchased from the Vector Core at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (the 
UNC vector core). Amount used is described in virus particles (VP).
Stereotaxic injection
Mice aged 2–6 months were used for injection. Viruses were injected into the brain using a 
Stereotaxic Alignment System (David Kopf Instruments) with an inhalation anesthesia of 
2.5% Isoflurane. Virus suspensions (PRVs: 1–1.5 × 106 PFU (1 μl), LVF2TK: 1–1.5 × 106 
IFU (1 μl), AAVs: 1–3 × 109 VP (200–330 nl)) were loaded into a 1-μl syringe, and injected 
at 100 nl per minute. The needle was inserted to the target locations based on a stereotaxic 
atlas30. After recovery, animals were singly housed with regular 12 h dark/light cycles, and 
food and water were provided ad libitum.
Odor exposure
Mice were exposed to a predator odor or distilled water within a modified polycarbonate 
vacuum-desiccator, as described previously34. A single mouse was placed on a platform in a 
chamber of 15 cm diameter with input and output ports, exposed to charcoal-filtered air for 
16 h, and then to filtered air bubbled through 12 mM 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline 
(TMT) (Contech) diluted in water, water alone, bobcat urine (Maine outdoor solutions or 
Murray’s lures and trapping), or rabbit urine (Kishel’s quality animal scents and lures). For 
detection of Arc in PRV-infected cells, CRH-Cre mice injected with PRVB177 four days 
earlier were exposed to odors for 5 minutes. For analysis of c-Fos expression in CRH 
neurons, CRH-Cre mice crossed with Rosa-floxstop-GFP mice were exposed to odors for 10 
minutes and then to clean air for 50 minutes. All odor exposures were performed between 
9:00 and 11:00 AM.
Plasma ACTH and corticosterone assays
Following sacrifice of mice by cervical dislocation and decapitation, trunk blood was 
collected directly into blood collection tubes (Becton Dickinson) containing 50 μl aprotinin 
(Phoenix Pharmaceuticals). Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1600 × g for 15

 minutes at 4°C, and stored at −80°C. Plasma ACTH concentrations were measured using the 
ACTH ELISA kit (MD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the 
following modifications: 1) 100 μl of the controls or blood plasma combined with 100 μl of 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) were used in place of 200 μl plasma and 2) the 
results were assessed with the QuantaRed Enhanced Chemifluorescent HRP Substrate 
(Thermo Fisher). Plasma corticosterone concentrations were measured using the 
corticosterone ELISA kit (Abcam), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the 
following modifications: 1) Plasma was diluted 25 times instead of 100 times with buffer M 
and 2) the results were assessed with the QuantaRed Enhanced Chemifluorescent HRP 
Substrate. Fluorescence was measured with a CytoFluor4000 plate reader (Applied 
Biosystems).
Immunofluorescence
Animals were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Their brains were 
then soaked in 4% PFA for 4 hours, in 30% sucrose for 48 hours, and then frozen in OCT 
(Sakura) and cut into 14–20 μm coronal sections using a cryostat. Brain sections were 
washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes, 
washed twice with PBS, blocked with TNB (Perkin Elmer) for 1 hour at room temperature, 
and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TNB at 4°C overnight. Sections were 
then washed three times with TNT (0.1 M Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween), 
incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies and 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature, and washed three times with 
TNT. Slides were coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). The following 
antibodies were used; (1) biotinylated mouse anti-HA (BioLegend, #901505, 1:300) 
followed by Alexa488-Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher, #S32354, 1:1000) for polysynaptic PRV 
tracing, (2) goat anti-GFP (Rockland, #600-101-215, 1:1000) and biotinylated anti-HA 
(BioLegend, 1:300) followed by Alexa488 donkey anti-goat IgG (Thermo Fisher, #A11055, 
1:1000) and Alexa555-Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher, #S32355, 1:1000) for monosynaptic 
PRV tracing, (3) rabbit anti-GFP (Thermo Fisher, #A-11122, 1:500) and goat anti-c-Fos 
(Santa Cruz, #sc-52G, 1:300) followed by Alexa488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher, 
#A21206, 1:1000) and Alexa555 donkey anti-goat IgG (Thermo Fisher, #A21432, 1:1000) 
for analysis of c-Fos expression in CRH neurons.
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed essentially as described previously11,35, with some 
experiments using additional steps for dual staining. Coding region fragments of Arc, 
Vglut1, Vglut2, Gad1, Gad2, and Crh, and the first intron sequence of c-Fos mRNA (for 
nuclear c-Fos staining) were isolated from mouse brain cDNA or mouse genomic cDNA 
using PCR, and cloned into the pCR4 Topo vector (Thermo Fisher). Digoxigenin (DIG) or 
Fluorescein (FLU) -labeled cRNA probes (riboprobes) were prepared using the DIG or FLU 
RNA Labeling Mix (Roche). Brains were frozen in OCT, and 16–20 μm coronal cryostat 
sections were hybridized to DIG- and/or FLU- labeled cRNA probes at 56°C for 13–16 
hours.

 nArc mRNA staining—After hybridization, sections were washed twice in 0.2× SSC at 
63°C for 30 minutes, incubated with peroxidase (POD)-conjugated anti-DIG antibodies 
(Roche, #11207733910, 1:2000) at 37°C for 2 hours, and then treated using the TSA-plus 
FLU kit (Perkin Elmer). Sections were then coverslipped with Fluoromount-G with DAPI 
(Southern Biotech).
Costaining for nArc, Vglut1/2 or Gad1/2 mRNA and PRVB177 (HA)—After 
hybridization, sections were washed twice in 0.2× SSC at 63°C for 30 minutes, incubated 
with POD-conjugated anti-DIG antibodies (Roche, #11207733910, 1:2000) and biotinylated 
anti-HA antibodies (BioLegend, #901505, 1:300) at 37°C for 2 hours, and then treated using 
the TSA-plus Cy3 kit (Perkin Elmer). Sections were then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI 
and Alexa488 Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher, 1:1000) at room temperature for 1 hour, and 
were coverslipped with Fluoromount-G.
Costaining with Crh with nuclear c-Fos riboprobes—After hybridization, sections 
were washed twice in 0.2× SSC at 63°C for 30 minutes, blocked with Streptavidin/Biotin 
Blocking kit (Vector Laboratories), incubated with POD-conjugated anti-FLU antibodies 
(Roche, #11426346910, 1:300) and alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated anti-DIG 
antibodies (Roche, #11093274910, 1:300) at room temperature for 2 hours, and then treated 
using the TSA-plus Biotin kit (Perkin Elmer). Sections were next incubated with 0.5 μg/ml 
DAPI and Alexa488 Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher, 1:1000) at room temperature for 30 
minutes, incubated with HNPP Fluorescent Detection Set (Roche) at room temperature for 1 
hour, and then coverslipped with Fluoromount-G.
Chemogenetic neuronal activation/silencing
Activation—AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry was injected into the pPir, AmPir or MEA of 
Emx1-ires-Cre or Vglut2-ires-Cre mice by stereotaxic injection (see above). At ≥ 2 weeks 
after injection, mice were intraperitoneally injected with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, Sigma) 
(5.0 mg/kg body weight) or control saline. Twenty minutes later, trunk blood and brain were 
collected and the blood used for plasma ACTH or corticosterone assays (see above). Brains 
were fixed with 4% PFA for 4 hours, soaked in 30% sucrose for 24 hours, frozen in OCT, 
and cut into 20 μm coronal sections using a cryostat. To analyze expression of hM3Dq-
mCherry, brain sections were immunostained with rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland, 
#600-410-379, 1:500) followed by Alexa555 donkey anti rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher, 
#A31572, 1:1000) antibodies (see above).
Silencing—AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry was injected into the AmPir of Emx1-ires-Cre 
mice by stereotaxic injection (see above). At ≥ 2 weeks after injection, mice were 
intraperitoneally injected with CNO (5.0 mg/kg body weight) or control saline. Forty 
minutes later, mice were exposed to bobcat urine or TMT for 10 minutes (see above). 
Animal behavior during exposure was recorded with a Canon PowerShot ELPH300HS 
camera placed above the chamber, and the duration that mice stayed immobile during the 
10-minute odor exposure were scored by using Ethovision XT11 software (Noldus 
Information Technology). Trunk blood and brain were then collected. Blood was used for

 plasma ACTH or corticosterone assays (see above). Brains were treated and immunostained 
with rabbit-anti-RFP antibodies (see above).
Cell counting
Images were collected using an AxioCam camera and AxioImager.Z1 microscope with 
apotome device (Zeiss), or TissueFAXS system (Tissuegnostics). Brain structures were 
identified microscopically and in digital photos using a mouse brain atlas30.
To analyze the locations and number of PRV-infected cells in brain areas, every fifth section 
was analyzed, and numbers of PRV+ cells were multiplied by five to acquire approximate 
total number of cells per animal. Brain areas were judged to contain upstream neurons if 
they contained ≥ 10 labeled neurons in ≥ 50% of animals.
To analyze the location and number of virus-infected and Arc-expressing cells, three of five 
sections were analyzed. The number of PRV+ cells with or without Arc mRNA was blindly 
counted. The percentages of PRV+ cells with only nuclear Arc signals among all PRV+ cells 
lacking cytoplasmic Arc were calculated.
To analyze the activation of CRH neurons in chemogenetic experiments, the numbers of 
CRH+ neurons labeled for nuclear c-Fos mRNA were blindly counted.
To analyze the distribution of virus-infected cells, all sections through the regions of interest 
were analyzed. The section images were aligned from anterior to posterior, and the numbers 
of virus-infected cells were counted. The size of each brain was adjusted linearly so that 
each posterior piriform cortex had the same length (2.8 mm).
Statistical analysis
All data are shown as the mean±SEM. Data were tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test for 
normality. For data with a normal distribution, the unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA with 
post-hoc Dunnett’s test was used to compare two groups or more than two groups, 
respectively, to analyze statistical significance. For t-tests, equality of variances was 
analyzed with the F-test and Welch’s correction was employed when variances of 
populations were significantly different. For data without a normal distribution, the Mann–
Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc Dunn’s test was used to compare 
two groups or more than two groups, respectively. All tests were two-sided. Detailed 
information on the numbers of animals used, statistical analyses, and effect sizes is provided 
in Supplementary Table 1.

 Extended Data
Extended Data Figure 1. Virus infection and spread in CRH-Cre and wildtype mice
a, Photographs show a PVN section from CRH-Cre mice crossed with Rosa-floxstop-GFP 
mice that was costained with anti-GFP antibodies (green) (Cre) and a CRH riboprobe (red) 
(CRH). Colabeled cells (yellow) can be seen in the merged image, verifying the expression 
of Cre in CRH neurons. Of GFP+ (Cre+) neurons in PVN sections, 93.9±0.5% expressed 
CRH. (n=4) Scale bar = 100 μm.
b, Photographs show a section through the PVN of a CRH-Cre mouse previously injected 
with PRVB316 and LVF2TK. The section was costained with antibodies for Cre-dependent 
reporters of PRVB316 (GFP (green)) and LVF2TK (HA (red)). Some colabeled neurons are 
seen (arrows), verifying coinfection of some neurons by the two viruses. Scale bar = 200 
μm.
c, The number of PRVB316+ cells inside or outside the PVN following PVN injection of 
PRVB316 alone (n=2) or PRVB316+LVF2TK (n=24) in CRH-Cre mice or 
PRVB316+LVF2TK in wildtype (WT) mice (n=3). Error bars indicate SEM. In CRH-Cre 
mice, PRVB316+ cells were seen both inside and outside the PVN following coinjection of 
PRVB316 and LVF2TK, but only inside the PVN when only PBVB316 was injected. In WT 
mice coinjected with the two viruses, PRV+ cells were not detected either inside or outside 
the PVN.
d, The number of PRV+ cells inside or outside PVN 3 or 5 days after PVN injection of 
PRVB177 in CRH-Cre or WT mice. (n=8 (CRH-Cre mice, Day3), n=6 (CRH-Cre mice,

PRVB177+ neurons were seen both inside and outside the PVN of CRH-Cre mice on both 
days, but were not detected in WT mice at either location.
Extended Data Figure 2. Brain areas with neurons upstream of CRH neurons
The percentage of all non-PVN PRV+ neurons found in individual brain areas four days 
after PVN injection of the monosynaptic PRV (PRVB316) (Mono) (n=24) or on day 3, 4, or 
5 after PVN injection of the polysynaptic PRV (PRVB177) (Poly) (n=8, 6, and 6, for day 3, 
4, and 5, respectively). Error bars indicate SEM. See Methods for full names of abbreviated

 Extended Data Figure 4. Biased distribution of neurons upstream of CRH neurons in pPir, 
AmPir, and MEA
a, b, Diagrams show the numbers of PRVB177-infected (HA+) neurons on day 4 after PVN 
injection in sequential 20 μm coronal sections along the anterior (A)-posterior (P) axis in 
different areas of the olfactory cortex (a) and vomeronasal amygdala (b). Data are shown in 
separate panels for four animals for each area. Infected neurons appear to be randomly 
distributed along the anterior-posterior axis in some areas, but not others.
c–e, Photographs of sections immunostained for PRVB177 (HA, green) on day 4 after PVN 
injection of PRVB177. Sections were counterstained with DAPI. More PRVB177+ neurons 
are seen in the posterior than anterior pPir (c) and AmPir (d). In the MEA (e), more are seen

(ad), and anteroventral (av)). Scale bars = 200 μm.
f–h, The percentages of PRVB177-infected neurons in the anterior (A) versus posterior (P) 
halves of pPir (f) and AmPir (g) and in different quadrants of the MEA (h). (n=4. Error bars 
indicate SEM. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. Paired t-test (f, g) and paired one-way 
ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey’s test (h).) Infected neurons were concentrated in the posterior 
halves of pPir and AmPir and were more abundant in the posteroventral quadrant of the 
MEA than in other quadrants.
Extended Data Figure 5. Expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic markers in PRV-infected 
neurons
a–c, Photographs of sections through the pPir (a), AmPir (b), or MEAp (c) four days after 
PVN injection of PRVB177. Sections were costained with antibodies against HA 
(PRVB177) (green) and riboprobes (red) for Vglut1 and Vglut2 (Vglut1/2), to identify 
glutamatergic neurons (Glu), or Gad1 and Gad2 (Gad1/2), to identify GABAergic neurons 
(GABA). Sections were counterstained with DAPI. Arrowheads indicate colabeled neurons. 
Numerous PRV-infected neurons were colabeled for Vglut1/2 in all three areas, but only the 
MEAp contained many colabeled for Gad1/2. Scale bars = 100 μm.
d, The percentage of PRVB177+ neurons colabeled for glutamatergic (Vglut1/2+) or 
GABAergic (Gad1/2+) markers in different areas of the olfactory cortex and vomeronasal 
amygdala. PRV+ neurons unlabeled by either probe could express other neurotransmitters or 
neuromodulators or reflect PRV effects on RNA transcription or degradation. (n=4 mice per 
condition. Error bars indicate SEM.) Most of the colabeled PRV+ cells in the olfactory areas 
were colabeled for the glutamatergic makers, but the MEA also contained some colabeled 
for the GABAergic markers.

 Extended Data Figure 6. TMT and bobcat urine activate CRH neurons and induce stress 
hormone increases
a, Photographs of PVN sections from CRH-Cre mice crossed with Rosa-floxstop-GFP mice. 
Mice were exposed to water (H2O), rabbit urine, bobcat urine, or TMT and sections then 
costained with antibodies against GFP (green), to identify CRH neurons, and c-Fos (red), to 
detect activated neurons. Higher magnifications of boxed areas are shown at the right. Many 
CRH neurons (GFP+) expressed c-Fos after exposure to bobcat urine or TMT, but not rabbit 
urine. Scale bars = 100 μm (left) and 20 μm (right).
b, The percentage of PVN CRH (GFP+) neurons immunostained for c-Fos after odor 
exposure of CRH-Cre mice crossed with Rosa-floxstop-GFP mice. Exposure to bobcat urine 
or TMT, but not rabbit urine, increased the percentage of CRH neurons expressing c-Fos. 
(n=6 mice per condition. Error bars indicate SEM. ***p<0.001. One-way ANOVA with 
post-hoc Dunnett’s test.)
c, d, Plasma ACTH (c) or corticosterone (d) concentrations were measured in WT mice 
following odor exposure. Exposure of animals to TMT or bobcat urine increased blood 
levels of ACTH and corticosterone, whereas exposure to rabbit urine did not. (n=6 mice per 
condition. Error bars indicate SEM. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. One-way ANOVA 
with post-hoc Dunnett’s test (c) or Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc Dunn’s test (d).)

 Extended Data Figure 9. Effect of neuronal silencing on the activation of neurons by predator 
odors
AAV DIO-hM4Di-mCherry was injected into the AmPir (a, b) or PLCo/PMCo (c). Animals 
were later injected with CNO or saline and exposed to bobcat urine (a, c) or TMT (b). Brain 
sections were hybridized with an Arc riboprobe and the number of cells labeled for nuclear 
Arc (nArc) determined for the AmPir, PLCo, and PMCo. Histograms show the number of 
cells with nArc in each area following injection with CNO or saline and exposure to 
predator odor. Based on the numbers of nArc+ neurons, silencing of AmPir neurons caused 
a significant decrease in AmPir and PLCo neurons activated by bobcat urine (a) and by 
AmPir (but not PLCo) neurons activated by TMT (b). Silencing of PLCo/PMCo (c) caused a 
significant decrease in neurons activated by bobcat urine in the PLCo, but not AmPir or 
PMCo. (n=6–7 per condition. Error bars indicate SEM. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

a–c, mCherry immunostaining (red) after injection of AAV DIO-hM4Di-mCherry (a) into 
AmPir (b) or PLCo/PMCo (c). Scale bars, 1 mm (left), 400 μm (right).
d, e, Plasma ACTH (d) or corticosterone (e) concentration after mice expressing hM4Di in 
AmPir or PLCo/PMCo were injected with saline or CNO and then exposed to bobcat urine 
or TMT. (n=6–7 per condition. Error bars indicate SEM. *p<0.05. Mann-Whitney U test (d) 
or Unpaired t-test (e).)
f, Percentage of PVN CRH+ neurons expressing nc-Fos in animals treated as in (d, e). (n=5–
7 per condition. Error bars indicate SEM. *p<0.05, ***p<0.001. Unpaired t-test.)
g, Animals expressing hM4Di in AmPir (d–f) were videotaped during exposure to bobcat 
urine and videos analyzed for the percentage of time spent immobile (% immobilized). 
(n=6–7 per condition. Error bars indicate SEM.)
