ABSTRACT: Ketone bodiesare the most energy-efficient fuel and yield more ATP per mole of substrate than pyruvate
and increase the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis. Elevation of circulating ketones via high-fat, low-
carbohydrate diets has been used for the treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy and for neurodegenerative diseases,
such as Parkinson’s disease. Ketones may also be beneficial for muscle and brain in times of stress, such as
endurance exercise. The challenge has been to raise circulating ketone levels by using a palatable diet without
altering lipid levels. We found that blood ketone levels can be increased and cholesterol and triglycerides decreased
by feeding rats a novel ketone ester diet: chow that is supplementedwith (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate
as 30% of calories. For 5 d, rats on the ketone diet ran 32% further on a treadmill than did control rats that ate an
isocaloric diet that was supplemented with either corn starch or palm oil (P < 0.05). Ketone-fed rats completed an 8-
arm radial maze test 38% faster than did those on the other diets, making more correct decisions before making a
mistake (P < 0.05). Isolated, perfused hearts from rats that were fed the ketone diet had greater free energy available
from ATP hydrolysis during increased work than did hearts from rats on the other diets as shown by using [31P]-
NMR spectroscopy.The novel ketone diet, therefore, improved physical performance and cognitive function in rats,
and its energy-sparing properties suggest that it may help to treat a range of human conditions with metabolic
abnormalities.—Murray, A. J., Knight, N. S., Cole, M. A., Cochlin, L. E., Carter, E., Tchabanenko, K., Pichulik, T.,

Food nutrients release metabolic energy as they are bro-
ken down into 2-carbon fragments and combusted to CO2
in the citric acid cycle (1). The reducing equivalents that
are produced undergo a series of redox reactions in the
electron transport system, ultimately converting O2 to
H2O, thereby creating a proton gradient between mito-
chondria and cytosol (2), the energy of which is preserved
in the pyrophosphate bond of ATP. However, different
food nutrients, when catabolized to C2 units, release dif-
fering amounts of energy depending on their degree of
oxidation and thus produce differing amounts of ATP per
mole of substrate or ATP with a different free energy of
hydrolysis, DG, by altering the relative concentrations of
ATP, ADP, and phosphocreatine (PCr) in tissue.
Elevation of ketone body levels increases the energy
of ATP hydrolysis by reducing the mitochondrial NAD

 couple and oxidizing the coenzyme Q couple, which
thereby increases the redox span between complex I
and complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport
chain (3). Combustion of the end-glycolytic substrate,
pyruvate, produces 10 ATP, whereas combustion of the
ketone body, D-b-hydroxybutyrate, produces 13 ATP
(4), which thereby increases the efficiency of hydraulic
work in the working, perfused rat heart by ;30% com-
pared with oxidation of pyruvate (5). Ketones, as the
most energy-efficient fuel, may therefore be beneficial
for muscle and brain in times of stress, such as during
endurance exercise (6).
Mild ketosis that results from the conversion of free
fatty acids to ketone bodies in the liver is a physiologic
response to prolonged fasting in humans (7), in whom
elevated blood ketone bodies replace glucose as the major
energy substrate for the brain (8). Therapeutically, eleva-
tion of circulating ketone concentrations by feeding high-
fat, low-carbohydrate diets has been used for more than a
century for treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy (9) and,
more recently, for neurodegenerative diseases, such as
Parkinson’s disease (10). The usefulness of these high-fat
diets, however, is limited by poor patient tolerance and
elevation of blood lipids, which offset many of the
benefits of ketone metabolism (11).
Feeding a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (9)
increases plasma cholesterol and free fatty acids (11, 12).
Both are undesirable: the former from an atherogenic
point of view and the latter because elevated free fatty
acids activate peroxisome proliferator-activated re-
ceptor transcription factors, which thereby increases
uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and induces metabolic in-
efficiency (13, 14). Furthermore, short-term consump-
tion of a high-fat diet impaired exercise tolerance and
spatial working memory in rats (15), whereas in hu-
mans, consumption of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate
ketogenic diet impaired whole-body exercise efficiency
(16), cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism (17),
and cognitive function (16, 17).
The challenge, therefore, has been to elevate circu-
lating ketone levels by using a palatable diet without
altering lipid levels and thereby negating many of
the desirable effects of ketone metabolism (6). Conse-
quently, we made an orally absorbable form of ketone
body by transesterifying ethyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate
with (R)-1,3-butanediol by using a solid-supported
lipase. The rationale behind our development of a ketone
ester was the desire to feed an orally absorbable form of
ketone without administering the cation load or acidosis
thatwouldaccompanythefeedingofaketonesalt(e.g.,Na-
hydroxybutyrate) or free acid (b-hydroxybutyric acid).
(R)-1,3-Butanediol was chosen because it is converted to
acetoacetate and D-b-hydroxybutyrate in the liver (18);
therefore, (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate
would yield only ketone bodies upon hydrolysis and oxi-
dation (Fig. 1A). (R)-3-Hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate
is palatable and nontoxic in rats (19) and humans (20).
Here, we questioned whether the metabolism of
D-b-hydroxybutyrate, fed in the diet as (R)-3-hydroxybutyl
(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, could increase physical perfor-
manceandcognitivefunctionintheratinvivo,andwhether
any changes were associated with improved high-energy
phosphate metabolism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals, diets, exercise capacity, and
cognitive function
All studies were approved by Oxford Animal Ethics Review
Committees and the Home Office. (R)-3-Hydroxybutyl (R)-3-
hydroxybutyrate and test diets were prepared at the University
of Oxford. Young adult male Wistar rats (n = 65; starting weight
70 g; Harlan UK, Alconbury, United Kingdom) were housed at
20°C in a humidity-controlled environment on a 12-h light-dark
photoperiod in accordance with UK Home Office and U.S. Na-
tional Institutes of Health guidelines. All rats were initially fed
standard laboratory chow ad libitum (Rat and Mouse No. 1
Maintenance; SDS, Witham, United Kingdom), which had an
Atwater fuel energy of 3.3 kcal/g, with 7.5% of its energy from
oil, 17.5% from protein, and 75% from carbohydrate.
Running performance was assessed by using a motorized
treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA),
whereas an 8-arm radial maze was used to assess working
memory, as described previously (15). Rats continued on the
standard laboratory chow diet as they were habituated to the
maze test (for 1 mo) and treadmill (for the final 7 d of the habit-
uation period) and for baseline testing.
During the maze test, all 8 arms were baited with a food
reward (1 ml of 50% sweetened condensed milk, 50% water),
which was not replenished during a test. Rats were placed in-
dividually in the center of the maze and their movements were
monitored. The test was deemed to be completed when a rat had
visited all 8 arms or 5 min had elapsed. Time taken to complete
the maze, that is, visit all 8 arms, and the number of initial correct
decisions taken before making an error, that is, returning to a
previously visited arm, were recorded.
Before the exercise test, rats were habituated to a motorized
treadmill (Columbus Instruments), running gently at gradually in-
creasing belt velocities. After this 7-d period, all rats were proficient
at running on the treadmill for 5 min at a velocity of 10 m/min on a
5° incline. From their first encounter with the treadmill, rats were
exposed to an electric stimulus at the rear of the treadmill that
deliveredashockof1.2mAofcurrentat3Hz.Abuilt-inelectricfan
was used to cool the rats during exercise and to circulate air in the
treadmill chamber. Rats subsequently underwent baseline testing,
which comprised 3 exercise tests on the treadmill on consecutive
days, during which belt velocity was initially set at 10 m/min and
increasedby1m/min2untiltheratfatigued,thatis,couldnolonger
keep pace with the belt, and at this point the distance run was
recorded.After the treadmilltest,rats underwent a maze test. After
completion of baseline testing, rats were switched to the experi-
mental diets (see Results) for 4 d before the 5 test days (Fig. 1B).
Each test day comprised 3 exercise tests (separated by .2 h)
and a maze test after the final exercise test. For each day, mean
exercise performance is reported here.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase flux assessment
Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) flux was determined by using
hyperpolarized 1-[13C] pyruvate as previously described (21).
In brief, 1 ml of hyperpolarized tracer was intravenously injected
for 10 s into the anesthetized rat and 60 individual cardiac spectra
were acquired during 1 min. Cardiac [13C] MR spectra were
analyzed by using the AMARES algorithm as implemented in
the Java-based magnetic resonance user interface (jMRUI)
software package (http://www.jmrui.eu/) (22). Relative me-
tabolite production was calculated by dividing the maximum
metabolite peak area by the maximum pyruvate peak area.

 Cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism
Rats(n=10perdietgroup)continuedtobepair-fedtestdietsfor7
wk after the final day of physical performance testing, without

of cardiac energetics, rats were anesthetized by using a 0.5-ml i.p.
injection of pentobarbital sodium (200 mg/ml Euthatal; Merial
Animal Health, Ltd., Harlow, United Kingdom). The heart was
removed and arrested in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer
(118 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4.7H2O, 1.3 mM

Figure 1. (R)-3-Hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate metabolism, experimental protocol and diets. A) (R)-3-Hydroxybutyl (R)-3-
hydroxybutyrate, synthesized via a transesterification reaction, is hydrolyzed by gut esterases to yield absorbable D-b-hydroxybutyrate
and (R)-1,3-butanediol. In the liver, (R)-1,3-butanediol is converted to acetoacetate and D-b-hydroxybutyrate, and, thus, ingestion of
the novel ketone ester yields only ketone bodies, elevating circulating levels. Oxidative tissues, including muscle, take up ketones via
monocarboxylate transporters, which leads to their subsequent oxidation in the mitochondria. B) Experimental protocol for
treadmill and maze testing. Rats were habituated to the 8-arm radial maze for 28 d and the motorized treadmill for 14 d before
baseline testing on 3 consecutive days. After baseline tests, rats were allocated to a diet group, rested for 4 d, and pair fed such that
rats received the same calories each day irrespective of group. Rats were then rehabituated to the maze and treadmill over 2 d
before 5 consecutive days of performance testing. C) Macronutrient composition (% kcal) of the Western, carbohydrate, and

 palmitateboundto1.5%albuminw/v.Heartswerecannulatedvia
the aorta and perfused in a recirculating retrograde Langendorff
mode at a constant pressure of 100 mm Hg.KH buffer was aerated
with 95% O2/5% CO2 at a constant working pH of 7.4 at 37°C.
Once the heart was secure and well perfused, any non-
myocardial tissue was carefully trimmed away. A small incision
was made in the pulmonary artery to prevent increase in venous
pressure. Intraventricular pressure development that resulted
from Thebesian artery drainage was minimized by insertion of a
polytetrafluoroethylene drain through the apex of the heart. A
polyethylene balloon connected to a pressure transducer was
inserted into the left ventricle and inflated to produce an end-
diastolic pressure of ;4 mm Hg. Left ventricular developed
pressure and heart rate were recorded via the pressure trans-
ducer connected to a PowerLab/4SP data acquisition system
(AdInstruments, Oxford, United Kingdom). Rate pressure prod-
uct (RPP) was calculated as the product of heart rate and left
ventricular developed pressure.
The perfused heart was placed in a 20-mm NMR sample tube
and positioned inside the bore of a 11.7-T superconducting
magnet. Temperature of the heart and perfusate was maintained
at 37°C by using water-jacketed buffer reservoirs and perfusion
lines. Intracellular phosphorus metabolites were determined by
acquiring partially saturated spectra at a resonant frequency of
202.47 MHz using a 60° pulse and receiver delay of 1 s. Each
spectrum consisted of 60 transients, which gave a total acquisi-
tion time of 1 min. Spectra were corrected for saturation by
comparison with unsaturated spectra,acquired at the endofeach
experiment by using a 90° pulse and a receiver delay of 2.35 s,
with a total acquisition time of 10 min. Signal-to-noise ratio was
increased by exponentially multiplying the resultant [31P] NMR
free induction decay by a line broadening factor of 20 Hz before
Fourier transformation.
Individual peak areas were related to absolute intracellular
concentrationsbyassumingcytosolicATPconcentrationwasequal
to 10.6 mM (23). b-ATP peak was used for all ATP, PCr, and in-
organic phosphate measurements, as described previously(24, 25).
After initial stabilization of the heart on KH buffer, hearts
were perfused with a physiologic buffer for 20 min. To accom-
plish this, plasma metabolite concentrations were obtained from
allratsduringthesedentaryfeedingphase2wkbeforeperfusion.
Thus, each group received physiologic buffers that contained
concentrations of palmitate (prebound to 1.5% w/v albumin),
b-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and lactate tailored to mimic
the circulating in vivo metabolite concentrations, in addition to
the standard KH buffer. Thus, concentrations were as follows:
Western diet: 0.41 mM palmitate, 0.3 mM b-hydroxybutyrate,
0.1 mM acetoacetate, and 1.2 mM lactate; carbohydrate diet:
0.29 mM palmitate, 0.3 mM b-hydroxybutyrate, 0.1 mM acetoace-
tate, and 1.2 mM lactate; and ketone diet: 0.36 mM palmitate,
0.5mMb-hydroxybutyrate,0.1mMacetoacetate,and2mMlactate.
During perfusion with physiologic buffer, workload was in-
creased by the coronary infusion of 10 nM isoproterenol, a
b-adrenergic receptor agonist. The optimal isoproterenol con-
centration to increase workload without damaging the heart was
calculated in previous experiments (24). Damage was defined as
the decrease in contractile function (i.e., RPP). The 10 nM iso-
proterenol solution was administered for 5 min via an external
line fed into the main buffer flow above the ascending aorta.
Cardiac function was monitored and short 1-min [31P] spectra
were recorded throughout.
Cardiac and skeletal muscle protein levels
Levels of UCP3 were measured in heart and skeletal muscle
samples by immunoblotting, as described previously (26, 27),
by using a polyclonal rabbit anti-UCP3 antibody (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) at a concentration of 1:1000 in 5% milk
Tris-bufferedsaline(TBS)-Tween.Glucosetransporter4(GLUT4)
levels were measured as described previously (23) by using a
rabbit anti-GLUT4 antibody kindly provided by Prof. G. D.
Holman (University of Bath, Beth, United Kingdom) at a con-
centrationof1:4000in5%milkTBS-Tween.Citratesynthaselevels
were measured by using a rabbit anti-CS antibody (Millipore) at
a concentration of 1:1000 in 5% milk TBS-Tween. Peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-g coactivator 1a (PGC1a) lev-
els were measured by using a rabbit anti-PGC1a antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at a con-
centration of 1:1000 in 5% milk TBS-Tween. Monocarboxylate
transporter 1 (MCT1) levels were measured by using a rabbit
anti-MCT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a concen-
tration of 1:2500 in 5% milk TBS-Tween. The secondary antibody
in all cases was a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase, which was used at concentrations be-
tween 1:3500 and 1:2000 in 5% milk TBS-Tween. Membranes
were incubated with ECL plus detection solution (Amersham
Biosciences,LittleChalfont, UnitedKingdom) andwereexposed
to X-ray film to visualize protein bands, which were quantified
by using Un-Scan-It Gel 6.1 (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT, USA).
Plasma metabolite concentrations
Plasma concentrations of acetone, R-1,3-butanediol, and (R)-3-
hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate were determined by using
GC-MS analyses. Acetone concentrations were determined by
using headspace analysis of the volatile compounds from a 20-ml
amount of neat plasma samples (28). H6-Acetone was used as an
internal standard to quantify plasma acetone concentrations. (R)-
3-Hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate and 1,3-butanediol were
analyzedas their trimethylsilylethers inelectronimpact mode by
GC-MS. Neutralized perchloric acid plasma extracts (20 ml) were
brought to dryness under a stream of N2 and were reacted with
100 ml Tri-Sil TBT reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) to form
the trimethylsilyl ethers (29). Samples were sealed and heated
to 60°C for 5 min. One microliter of derivatized sample extracts
was analyzed by capillary column GC-MS. 1,3-Butanediol was
quantifiedbyusing1,4-butanediolasaninternalstandardadded
to the samples before sample extraction. (R)-3-Hydroxybutyl
(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate was quantified by using an external
standard procedure by spiking plasma with the analyte over a
concentration range from 1 to 100 mM.
Cardiac and hepatic metabolomic analysis
Heart and liver tissue from rats that were fed the 3 diets were
analyzed by a combination of [1H] NMR spectroscopy and GC-
MS as part of a metabolomic strategy to assess metabolic differ-
ences in the 3 tissues, as described previously (30).
Statistics
ANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine
whether there were differences between the diet groups, and
Bonferroni post hoc independent unpaired Student’s t tests were
used to determine differences between diet groups. Paired Stu-
dent’s t tests were used to determine within-group differences
between baseline and test week.

 (1.76 kcal/g) diets: 1) a fat-rich Western diet in which
30% of kcal came from added palm oil (n = 20); 2) a high-
carbohydrate diet in which 30% of kcal came from added
corn starch (n = 10); or 3) a ketone diet in which 30% of
kcal came from (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate
(n = 20; Fig. 1C). Rats were pair fed, such that rats fed
the Western and carbohydrate diets received the same
number of calories as those consumed by the ketone
diet–fed rats on the previous day. Before introduction
of the test diet, all rats consumed 33 6 2 kcal/d from
normal rodent chow. Over a 5-d performance period,
total daily calorie intake was 39 6 2 kcal/rat/d. Thus,
ketone diet–fed rats consumed 2.5 g of (R)-3-hydroxybutyl
(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate per d, which was equivalent to
11.7 g/kg body weight/d.
After 9 d, plasma levels of D-b-hydroxybutyrate in ke-
tone diet–fed rats were double (P , 0.001) those of rats fed
the Western diet, whereas no (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-
hydroxybutyrate could be detected in any plasma sample.
(R)-1,3-Butanediol concentrations, at 70–110 mM, were
15% of D-b-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, and acetone
levels were 60–80 mM, which demonstrated that the (R)-3-
hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate had been hydro-
lyzed completely and butanediol had been converted to
ketonebodies.Plasmacholesterolandtriglyceridelevelsin
theketonediet–fedratswere37%(P,0.001)and59%(P,
0.01) lower, respectively, than in rats fed the Western diet,
which was consistent with the inability of the liver to ox-
idize ketone bodies as a result of the absence of 3-oxoacid-
CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.5). Plasma glucose, free fatty
acids, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were the same for
all rats.
At baseline,when consuming chow, ratswith matching
runningcapacitieswereallocatedtothe3dietgroups,with
an average running distance of 456 6 38 m/d. On each of
the final 5 d on the diets, ketone diet–fed rats ran 32% (P ,
0.05) further than did the Western diet– and carbohydrate
diet–fed rats (Fig. 2A). Ketone diet–fed rats were the only
group that increased running performance from baseline,
averaging 22% (P , 0.05) further each day over the 5 d.
After the third treadmill run each day, rats performed
an 8-arm radial maze test (31). Although the time to
complete the test was the same for all rats at baseline,
ketone diet–fed rats were 38% (P , 0.05) faster at com-
pleting the radial maze than Western diet– and carbohy-
drate diet–fed rats (Fig. 2B). Cognitive function, measured
by the number of correct arm choices made, was the same
for the3 diet groups at baseline. Ketone diet–fed rats made
more correct decisions before makinga mistake during the
test week than at baseline, whereas rats that were fed the
other diets did not show a significant difference in per-
formance (Fig. 2C).
End body weights were similar for the 3 diet groups at
218 6 4 g, 213 6 8 g, and 209 6 6 g for the Western diet–,
carbohydrate diet–, and ketone diet–fed rats, respectively.
Epididymalfat pad weights [an index of visceral adiposity
(32)] were 40% (P , 0.05) lower in the ketone diet–fed rats
compared with those fed the Western diet. In vivo hyper-
polarized [13C] MR spectroscopy (21) revealed that rats
that were fed the carbohydrate diet had 2-fold greater
cardiac PDH flux than did rats that were fed either the
Western or ketone diets (Fig. 2D). Thus, the ketone
diet may provide energy in conditions of insulin re-
sistance when PDH is inhibited, such as diabetes, but
also trauma, infection, heart failure, and Alzheimer’s
disease (21, 33, 34).
Three groupsof 10ratscontinued tobe pairfedthe diets
for a total of 66 d, during which time they increased nor-
mally in weight and by a similar amount (;35%). End
body weights were similar, at 297 6 10 g, 292 6 9 g, and
277 6 17 g for Western diet–, carbohydrate diet–, and
ketone diet–fed rats, respectively. Food intake during the
66 d of feeding was 53 6 1 kcal/rat/d. Thus, ketone
diet–fed rats consumed 3.4 g of (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-
hydroxybutyrate daily, equivalent to 13.7 g/kg body
weight/d.
To determine whether the ketone diet increased the free
energy available from ATP hydrolysis (ΔGATP hydrolysis),
hearts were isolated and perfused for [31P] MR spec-
troscopy experiments (23). Heart rates and developed
pressures were continuously monitored to allow the cal-
culation of RPPs. During perfusion, RPPs increased by
34%(P,0.05)inallheartsfor5minafteradditionof10nM
isoproterenol, a b-adrenergic receptor agonist (Fig. 3A).
Before isoproterenol infusion, [PCr] and calculated free
adenosine diphosphate concentrations ([ADP]free) were
the same for all rathearts(Fig. 3B, C). During isoproterenol
perfusion, [PCr] was 32% higher (P , 0.05) and [ADP]free
was 50% lower (P , 0.001) in ketone diet–fed rat hearts
compared with Western diet– and carbohydrate diet–fed
rat hearts. ATP concentrations and pH remained the same
for all rat hearts, but the ΔGATP hydrolysis was 2.6 kJ×mol21
(P , 0.05) greater during the infusion of isoproterenol in
hearts from rats that were fed the ketone diet compared
with those from rats that were fed Western and carbohy-
drate diets (Fig. 3D).
Heart weights were the same for all the rats; however,
epididymal fat weights were 18% (P , 0.05) lower in the
carbohydrate diet–fed rats and 30% (P , 0.05) lower in the
ketone diet–fed rats than in the Western diet–fed rats after
66 d on diet (Fig. 3E). Plasma levels of b-hydroxybutyrate
in ketone diet–fed rats remained double those of rats
on the Western diet (Fig. 3F). No (R)-3-hydroxybutyl
(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate could be detected in any plasma
sample. Plasma concentrations of cholesterol were 52%
lower—with significant decreases in both HDL and
LDL—triglycerides were 40% lower, and glucose was
33% lower (Fig. 3G) in rats that were fed the ketone diet
than in rats that were fed the Western diet. Citrate synthase
activity was the same in all rat heart tissue, which sug-

as a consequence of diet. Heart and skeletal muscle pro-
tein levels of UCP3, GLUT4, citrate synthase, PGC1a, and
MCT1 were unaltered after 66 d on any diet.
Metabolic differences in liver and heart tissue from rats
that were fed the 3 diets for 66 d were determined by using
[1H] NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS (30). In the liver, pro-
ton NMR spectroscopy detected a 2-fold higher level of

 the 3 groups to be distinguished by using pairwise com-
parisons (Fig. 4B).
Comparison of all 3 groups demonstrated that the
Western diet group was most different from the other 2
groups, having 7% higher saturated fat (P , 0.001).
Compared with the Western diet, rats that were fed the
ketone diet had decreased amounts of liver palmitate,
oleate, C18:2 and increased concentrations of C22:6, C17:1,
and C16:1 fatty acids (Table 1). [1H] NMR spectroscopy of
the aqueous liver metabolites distinguished between all 3
groups(Fig.4C).Ketone diet–fed ratshadthe most distinct
metabolic changes, with increased concentrations of ATP,
lactate, and b-hydroxybutyrate and decreased glucose,
alanine, and adenosine (Table 1).
In the heart, only small differences were detected in
the aqueous fraction of the tissue from ketone diet–fed
animals, with increased ATP and decreased lactate and
taurine. Total fatty acid content distinguished heart tissue
according to the 3 diets (Fig. 4D), including a relative de-
crease in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty
acids in the heart from animals that were fed the Western
diet compared with the other 2 diets (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
The possible benefits of mild ketosis for the improvement
of performance and cognition during endurance exercise
as a result of the thermodynamic advantage afforded by
ketone body oxidation over the oxidation of alternative
substrates have been hypothesized (3, 6). Here, we found
that a diet that contained a novel ketone ester [30% kcal
from (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] elevated
circulating b-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in rats and
lowered plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose
levels compared with pair-fed, isocaloric diets in which
the ketone ester was replaced by fat or carbohydrate.

 Supplementation with a ketone ester improved running
performance on a motorized treadmill and working
memory during a maze test. Mechanistically, ketone ester
supplementation was found to increase the free energy
available from ATP hydrolysis in the isolated, perfused rat
heart under conditions of increased work.
In humans, ketosis canoccur in the pathologic settingof
type 1 diabetes, where insulin deficiency results in a re-
lease of freefattyacidsfromadipose tissue thatexceeds the
capacity of other tissues to metabolize them, driving ke-
tone body synthesis by hepatic mitochondria (3). In this
situation, elevation of blood ketone levels to $20 mM (35)
depletes blood bicarbonate and acidifies the blood to pH
6.9 (3). Physiologic ketosis, which contrasts with diabetic
ketoacidosis, is a normal physiologic state with no known
adverse medical consequences (3). In humans, ketosis will
result from prolonged starvation and is accompanied by
high circulating free fatty acid levels (7, 36). Alternatively,
ketosis can be achieved via the so-called ketogenic diet, in
which 80% of daily calorie intake is typically derived from
fat, with 15% from protein and 5% from carbohydrate (37).
With adjustment to the ketogenic diet, whole-body glu-
cose oxidation falls and plasma glucose levels can be
maintained, albeit at lower concentrations than in
carbohydrate diet–fed individuals (12). Usefulness of the
ketogenic diet in achieving long-term ketosis, however, is
limited as a result of the elevation of blood cholesterol and
LDL cholesterol, which predisposes the individual to
atherosclerosis(11).Moreover,theelevationofplasmafree
fatty acid levels that resultsfrom lipolysis of adipose tissue
may offset many of the benefits of ketone metabolism via
activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
and the possible uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation
at the mitochondria (13, 14, 38).

 (R)-3-Hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate has been
shown to be safe in rats with 28 d of feeding (19), and has
similarly been found to be well-tolerated in humans (20).
Here, we studied exercise and cognitive performance in
rats with relatively short-term feeding of the ketone ester
(9 d), but continued to feed a subgroup of rats for a total of
66d. Thus, we have extended the time during which (R)-3-
hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate has been fed at 30%
caloric intake with no adverse effects. It has been shown
that, after 14 d, supplementation with the ester lowered
blood glucose and insulin levels, which indicates an im-
provement in insulin sensitivity (3, 39). Because insulin
increases sterol regulatory binding protein (SREBP) in the
liver, which increases expression of genes associated with
cholesterol synthesis, it was proposed that ketone ester
supplementationwouldalso haveantilipidemiceffects (3).
We found short-term effects of ketosis on plasma choles-
terol and triglyceride levels, effects that were sustained
after longer-term supplementation. This is in contrast with
hyperlipidemiaproducedbytheketogenicdiet(11),which
indicates that ketone ester supplementation is a viable
strategy to support long-term ketosis and avoid the risk of
atherosclerosis. Moreover, the lipidomic profile of liver
and cardiac tissue after long-term feeding distinguished
the ketone diet–fed rats from those fed the other diets
testedinthisstudy,whilehigherb-hydroxybutyratelevels
were associated with higher ATP levels in the livers of
ketone diet–fed rats.
(R)-3-Hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate has been
shown to have antilipidemic effects in rats and humans
(40) and to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and UCP1
expression in brown adipose tissue of mice (41), as well as
to decrease appetite in rats and mice (39, 41). As a pre-
caution against possible palatability issues or appetite-
suppression effects associated with ketone ester feeding,
rats that were allocated to the carbohydrate and Western
diets in this study were pair fed, receiving the same calo-
ries each day as their ketone-supplemented counterparts
received the day before. Of note, however, calorie con-
sumption remained high in the ketone-supplemented rats
throughout the study. Caloric intake increased, as expec-
ted, during the exercise-testing week in response to

 increased energy demand, but ketone intake (corrected for
body mass) increased further during the prolonged sed-
entary period after exercise testing. Use of a pair-feeding
regime and isocaloric diets was a major strength of this
study.
In agreement with our hypothesis, supplementation
with (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate for 5 d
improved running performance in rats during an endur-
ance test on a motorized treadmill. Performance was ele-
vated both above baseline running performance and
above that of rats that were pair fed isocaloric diets with
ketone ester replaced withfator carbohydrate. In previous
studies, using this protocol, we have found that provision
of a high-fat diet (55% of kcal from fat) worsened running
performance in rats (15), as did a diet in which long-chain
triglycerides (46% kcal) were provided, although rats that
consumed medium-chain triglycerides (46% kcal; associ-
ated with increased ketone body production) were not
affected to the same extent (42). Researchers have pro-
posedtheuseoftheketogenicdietasatrainingaidbecause
of its effects in elevating muscle fatty acid oxidation rates
(43). Others, meanwhile, have suggested that the well-
documented weight loss engendered by the ketogenic diet
might hold some benefits for athletes in decreasing fat
mass while conserving muscle and, thus, strength (37).
Although increased fat availability does result in elevated
whole-body and muscle fat use during submaximal exer-
cise, there is no consistent evidence that the ketogenic diet
improves endurance performance (44–46). In fact, in the
short term, at least, the ketogenic diet has been seen to
impair whole-body exercise efficiency (16) and cardiac
high-energy phosphate metabolism (17).
Mechanistically, ketone ester supplementation would
be expected to improve performance because of the ther-
modynamic advantages of ketone oxidation (3, 6), though
it may also support increased muscle work during
physiologic stress by sparing alternative energy sour-
ces, particularly glycogen, as muscle glycogen content
correlates with endurance exercise in humans (47). In
rats that were supplemented with (R)-3-hydroxybutyl
(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate for 66 d, metabolic profiles of
liver and heart tissue were altered compared with those
of rats that were fed the other diets. Distinct features of
ketone diet–fed rats included elevated ATP levels in liver
and, in the heart, lower lactate levels, which may suggest
a decreased reliance on glycolysis and, thus, myocardial
glycogen reserves, albeit under sedentary conditions. If
this were indeed the case, exogenous ketone supplemen-
tation would represent a novel metabolic state of ketosis
with replete muscle glycogen reserves.
The increased physical performance observed in this
study while feeding a ketone diet is consistent with the
increase in hydraulic efficiency seen in the working rat
heart perfused with ketone bodies vs. glucose alone (5),
and was reflected in our perfusion studies after long-term
ketone supplementation. A strength of the study design
was the use of physiologically relevant perfusion buffers
during the measurement of cardiac energetics in isolated
hearts before and during conditions of increased work
after isoproterenol supplementation. Use of these buffers
allowed us to reproduce ex vivo the substrate balance
available to the hearts of the animals that are under
physiologic stress in vivo, which thereby demonstrates an
enhanced DGATP hydrolysis during increased work. Increase

 in physical performance in muscle, therefore, is a result
of the increased ATP produced when C2 units from
D-b-hydroxybutyrate were oxidized in the citric acid cycle,
as opposed to C2 units derived from pyruvate or from fat,
as well as the lower intracellular [ADP]. During intense
exercise, a switch in fuel use occurs, with the oxidation of
glycogen-derived pyruvate increasing at higher intensities
because of limitations on the rate of muscle and mito-
chondrial uptake of fatty acids and the increased oxygen
demand of fatty acid oxidation compared with pyruvate
(48). In the hearts of ketone diet–fed rats, however, PDH
flux was lower compared with the carbohydrate diet–fed
group, which suggests that exogenous ketones alter the
normal hierarchy of substrate use during exercise, with
ketones oxidized in preference to pyruvate when avail-
able. This would make sound evolutionary sense, as ke-
tones cannot be stored and would ordinarily be present
under conditions of limited substrate availability, that is,
starvation.
The preferential oxidation of ketones over both fatty
acids and pyruvate suggests that exogenous ketone sup-
plementation may be beneficial during conditions in
which normal substrate use is compromised. Recent re-
ports have suggested that increased ketone use underpins
a key metabolic adaptation in advanced heart failure in
both rodents (49) and humans (50). Whereas the healthy
human heart relies primarily on fatty acid oxidation to
provide the significant daily requirements of ATP to sup-
port normal pump function, in the hypertrophied and
failing heart, a remodeling of mitochondrial energy me-
tabolism occurs that results in a decreased myocardial
capacity for fatty acid oxidation (51), the so-called fetal
shift (52). In human heart failure, however, circulating
plasma free fatty acids are elevated (53), secondary to in-
creased sympathetic activation and—alongside a de-
creased capacity for fatty acid oxidation—can result in
intramyocardial lipid accumulation (54) and myocardial
insulin resistance(23, 55). The failing heart is characterized
by poor myocardial energetics, which predict mortality
(56), underlaid by an impaired capacity to either oxidize
fatty acids or to take up glucose in response to insulin
stimulation (57). The recent finding of a switch toward
increased ketone use in end-stage human heart failure (50)
is intriguing in that ketones seem to offer a means of
circumventing impaired substrate use, with an increase
in the myocardial expression of b-hydroxybutyrate de-
hydrogenase 1 in mice with heart failure (49). In human
heart failure, mild ketosis may occur as a result of in-
creased hepatic ketogenesis driven by elevation in free
fatty acids that occurs secondary to the hyperadrenergic
state. Ketone ester supplementation may therefore im-
prove energetics in the failing heart, increasing availability
of the substrateof choice,and may holdfurtherbenefits for
the heart and other tissues in conditions of insulin re-
sistance by providing an alternative fuel or improving
insulin sensitivitybydecreasingplasmafreefattyacids (3).
The ability of ketosis to improve cognitive performance
during a maze test of working memory suggests that the
brain readily uses ketone bodies in preference to glucose
(8, 58, 59). A ketogenic diet increased human brain PCr, as
observed using [31P] MR spectroscopy (60), and, hence,
increased the DGATP hydrolysis by virtue of the near equilib-
rium of the creatine kinase reaction (61). However, hy-
perlipidemia (11) and the threat of vascular disease
produced by feeding high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets has
limited the use of ketogenic diets to those age ,17 yr. A
ketone ester diet would overcome these difficulties. In a
mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, the ketone ester
lessened amyloid b-peptide and hyperphosphorylated t
deposition, which lessened anxiety and improved cogni-
tion (62), whereassimilar improvementsin cognition were
observed in a patient with Alzheimer’s disease who was
treated with (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate
over 20 mo (63). Ketone supplementation may also have
therapeutic benefits in cases of traumatic brain injury,
during which opening of the mitochondrial permeability
transition pore occurs as a result of a decrease in brain
phosphorylation energy and further impairs ATP syn-
thesis (64). The ketogenic diet has been shown to be neu-
roprotective in rodent models of traumatic head injury,
but has limited use in humans because of the time (days)
needed to elevate blood ketone levels (65), whereas a rapid
elevation in blood ketone levels could be achieved via (R)-
3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate.
CONCLUSIONS
Mild ketosis is useful in the treatment of drug-resistant
epilepsy. Studies in cells (33), animals (66), and patients
(10, 59) suggest that it may be useful in common neurode-
generative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s
diseases, as well as in insulin-resistant states, such as
trauma, heart failure, and diabetes (67). Our results show
that mild ketosis markedly improved both physical and
cognitive performance in the rat, suggesting that feeding
an energy-efficient ketone diet could be used to treat hu-
man metabolic disorders.
