Abstract
Rationale: The contribution of air pollution to the risk of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is unknown.
Methods: We studied 1,558 critically ill patients enrolled in a
prospective observational study at a tertiary medical center who lived
less than 50 km from an air quality monitor and had an ARDS
risk factor. Pollutant exposures (ozone, NO2, SO2, particulate
matter , 2.5 mm, particulate matter , 10 mm) were assessed by
weighted average of daily levels from the closest monitors for the
prior 3 years. Associations between pollutant exposure and ARDS
risk were evaluated by logistic regression controlling for age, race,
sex, smoking, alcohol, insurance status, rural versus urban residence,
distance to study hospital, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II.
Measurements and Main Results: The incidence of ARDS
increasedwithincreasingozoneexposure:28%inthelowestexposure
quartile versus 32, 40, and 42% in the second, third, and fourth
quartiles (P , 0.001). In a logistic regression model controlling
for potential confounders, ozone exposure was associated with
risk of ARDS in the entire cohort (odds ratio, 1.58 [95% confidence
interval, 1.27–1.96]) and more strongly associated in the subgroup
with trauma as their ARDS risk factor (odds ratio, 2.26 [95%
confidence interval, 1.46–3.50]). There was a strong interaction
between ozone exposure and current smoking status (P = 0.007).
NO2 exposure was also associated with ARDS but not independently
of ozone exposure. SO2, particulate matter less than 2.5 mm,
and particulate matter less than 10 mm were not associated
with ARDS.
Conclusions: Long-term ozone exposure is associated with
development of ARDS in at-risk critically ill patients, particularly
in trauma patients and current smokers. Ozone exposure may
represent a previously unrecognized environmental risk factor
for ARDS.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) is a common syndrome of acute
lung inflammation, noncardiogenic
pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory
failure (1). With a U.S. incidence of 190,000
cases per year and mortality of 30 to 40% (2),
ARDS is an important and costly public
health problem. The most common
clinical risk factors for ARDS are sepsis,
pneumonia, severe trauma, aspiration of
gastric contents, and multiple transfusions
(3). However, ARDS develops in only a
subset of patients with these risk factors.
The mechanisms that predispose to ARDS
in some, but not all, at-risk patients are
not understood.
Recent evidence suggests that
environmental exposures such as tobacco

 smoke (4–6) and alcohol abuse (7) may
enhance the risk of developing ARDS, but
the effect of exposure to ambient levels of
environmental pollutants on risk of ARDS
has not been investigated. We hypothesized
that long-term exposure to high levels of
ambient pollutants primes the lung to
develop ARDS in the setting of another
clinical risk factor. To test this hypothesis,
we analyzed the association between ARDS
and long-term exposure to air pollutants
including ozone, NO2, particulate matter
less than 2.5 mm [PM2.5], particulate
matter less than 10 mm [PM10], and SO2
in a large cohort of critically ill patients at
risk for ARDS.
Some of the results of these studies have
been previously reported in the form of an
abstract (8).
Methods
A complete description of methods is
available in the online supplement.
Patients
We studied patients from VALID
(Validating Acute Lung Injury Biomarkers
for Diagnosis), a prospective observational
cohort of critically ill medical, surgical,
and trauma patients admitted to Vanderbilt
University Medical Center (VUMC) (9–12).
Subjects enrolled from 2006 to 2012 were
included if a residential address was
available, they lived within 50 km of at least
one U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA)-approved air quality monitor, and
they had an ARDS risk factor.
Clinical Data
Clinical data included demographics,
insurance status, current smoking, alcohol
use, medical history, medications, Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE) II (13), hemodynamics,
ventilator settings, laboratory values, and
outcomes. Patients were coded as metro or
nonmetro dwellers using U.S. Department
of Agriculture 2003 and 2013 Rural–Urban
Continuum Codes. Patients were
phenotyped at enrollment and on
subsequent 3 days for sepsis (14), organ
dysfunction (15), and ARDS. Patients were
classified as having ARDS if they met
American European Consensus Conference
(16) criteria for acute lung injury (ALI) or
ARDS on two or more consecutive days
and as having no ARDS if they did
not meet criteria on any day. Patients
meeting criteria on a single or on two
nonconsecutive days were deemed
“indeterminate” ARDS status and were
included only in a sensitivity analysis.
Air Pollutant Exposure Estimates
Daily measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2,
PM2.5, and PM10 were obtained from the
EPA’s Aerometric Information Retrieval
System. The 24-hour average was computed
for each pollutant except for ozone. Because
ozone levels are typically elevated only
during daylight hours, the highest 8-hour
average was used. Because ozone levels are
monitored only in warmer months in
Tennessee, ozone data were restricted to
April through September.
Patient addresses were geocoded and
distances to all monitors calculated
(Haversine formula). Daily pollutant
exposures were estimated by the inverse-
distance-squared weighted average of daily
levels from monitors within 50 km (17).
Long-term exposures were estimated
using average pollutant levels for the 1-, 3-,
and 5-year periods before ICU admission
and short-term exposures using levels for
the prior 3 days and 6 weeks. Findings for
1-, 3-, and 5-year ozone exposures were
similar; 3-year data are presented. Because
no significant associations between long-
term exposures to SO2, PM2.5, and PM10
and risk of ARDS were observed, these are
presented in the online supplement. As
there were no associations between any
short-term air pollutant exposure and
ARDS, these data are not shown. For
reference, correlations between pollutant
levels are shown in Table E1 in the online
supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic and clinical data were
compared between patients with and
without ARDS using Pearson chi-square
tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Missing
values of regression covariates were multiply
imputed with predictive mean matching
(18) to avoid case-wise deletion of patient
records. We fit logistic regression models to
examine the relationship between ARDS
and pollutant levels controlling for
prespecified confounders including age,
race, sex, enrollment month (to control
for season), current smoking, alcohol
use, insurance status (as a proxy for
socioeconomic status), median household
income, metro versus nonmetro residence,
distance to VUMC, APACHE II, injury
severity score (trauma subset only), and
blunt versus penetrating trauma. A
restricted cubic spline with three knots
was used for age, month, and APACHE II
to permit nonlinear associations. Data
analyses were performed using R Version 3
(R Core Team).
Results
Patients
Differences between patients who were
eligible for inclusion in the study and those
who were not eligible related to the
requirement for living within 50 km of an
air pollution monitor, leading to more
nonmetro dwellers and a farther distance
to Vanderbilt among excluded patients
(Table E2). There were 1,558 patients who
met the inclusion criteria for the ozone
analysis and 1,257 who met the inclusion
criteria for the NO2 analysis (Figure 1).
There were 1,350, 1,355, and 1,130 patients
At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: Ozone induces lung
inflammation and oxidative stress in
humans and experimental models.
In population-based studies, ozone
exposure has been implicated in
hospital admissions and mortality
related to heart and lung disease.
Recent evidence suggests that
environmental exposures such as
tobacco smoke and alcohol abuse may
enhance the risk of developing acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
but the effect of exposure to ambient
levels of environmental pollutants such
as ozone on risk of ARDS has not been
investigated.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: We found that long-term ozone
exposure, even at relatively low levels,
is associated with development of
ARDS in at-risk critically ill patients.
These findings suggest that ozone
exposure, like other environmental
exposures such as alcohol and tobacco,
may represent an important and
previously unrecognized risk factor for
development of ARDS.

 available for the SO2, PM2.5, and PM10
analyses, respectively; levels of the
individual air pollutants were only
moderately correlated (Table E1).
Patient characteristics for the ozone
analysis are in Table E3. Of the 1,558
patients, 563 met criteria for ARDS. Patients
with ARDS were older, were more likely
to have sepsis as their ARDS risk factor,
and had a higher severity of illness than
patients who did not develop ARDS.
Ozone Exposure and ARDS
The geographic distribution of the ozone
monitors that were included in the study is
shown in Figure 2. The median distance
from a patient’s residence to the nearest air
quality monitor was 19 km. Three-year
average ozone exposure levels were lower
than current EPA standards (19) (median,
51.5 ppb; range, 41.5–58.2). Despite
these low levels of exposure, the incidence
of ARDS increased significantly with
increasing long-term ozone exposure
(Table 1, Figure 3A). In a logistic regression
model that controlled for potential
confounders, long-term ozone exposure
was independently associated with risk of
ARDS (Table 2, Figure 4A). The findings
were not different if 24-hour average
levels of ozone were used rather than the
highest daily 8-hour average (Table E4).
The association between ARDS and
ozone exposure was strongest in the
subgroup of patients (n = 552) with trauma
as their ARDS risk factor (Figure 3B). In
a logistic regression model that controlled
for potential confounders, long-term ozone
exposure was independently associated
with risk of ARDS in trauma patients
(Table E5). The interaction between trauma
and ozone exposure was statistically
significant (P = 0.039).
NO2 exposure and ARDS
Patient characteristics for the NO2 analysis
are in Table E6. NO2 exposure levels were
relatively low (median, 15.4 ppb; range,
1.7–17.7). Although overall rates of ARDS
across quartiles of NO2 exposure were not
significantly different in an unadjusted
analysis (Table E7), NO2 exposure was
associated with risk of ARDS in a logistic
regression model that controlled for
potential confounders (Table E8). As with
ozone, the effect was strongest in trauma
patients (n = 419; odds ratio [OR] per
5-ppb increase, 1.92; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.25–2.94). When 3-year
ozone and NO2 exposure were included in
the same model, only ozone exposure
remained significantly associated with
ARDS (Table E9).
Interaction with Smoking and Alcohol
Because exposure of the lung to cigarette
smoke could be synergistic with ozone for
increasing the risk of ARDS, we tested for an
interaction between current smoking and
ozone exposure. The interaction term was
highly significant (P = 0.007). Ozone was
significantly associated with ARDS only in
current smokers and not in nonsmokers
(Figure 4B). There was no association
between alcohol and ARDS in this study
and no interaction between alcohol and
ozone (P value for interaction, 0.60) or
any other pollutant.
Sensitivity Analyses
To determine if accuracy of exposure
estimates affected the findings, we restricted
analysis to patients living within 15 km
of a monitor. None of the analyses were
substantively changed (not shown). In a
second sensitivity analysis, we included the
80 patients with “indeterminate” ARDS
status as control subjects. Ozone exposure
was still associated with ARDS (OR, 1.56;
95% CI, 1.25–1.94), especially in trauma
patients (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.46–3.51). The
interaction of ozone exposure with smoking
was unchanged (P , 0.001).
Discussion
In critically ill patients at risk for ARDS,
long-term exposure estimates for ozone
based on residential address were associated
with development of ARDS. Importantly,
this association was independent of other
known risk factors for ARDS, such as age
and severity of illness. In addition, this
association persisted after adjustment for
potential confounders, including metro
versus nonmetro dwelling, source of
insurance and median household income
as indicators of socioeconomic status, and
distance of residence from the study
hospital, which was included to control for
possible unmeasured differences in severity
of illness that could lead to transfer to

 VUMC of sicker patients from remote
hospitals with different levels of pollutant
exposure. We also found an association of
long-term exposure to NO2 and risk of
ARDS; however, in two pollutant models
with ozone and NO2, only ozone remained
significant. There was no association
between exposure estimates for other
pollutants (SO2, PM2.5, and PM10) and
ARDS. To our knowledge, this is the
first report of an association between
ambient air pollution and risk of ARDS.
Furthermore, the observed association
occurred at relatively low levels of exposure
that fall within current EPA standards,
suggesting that these observations, if
reproduced, could be relevant even in
areas with low levels of ambient ozone.
Based on these findings, long-term
exposure to ozone could represent a
previously unrecognized risk factor for
development of ARDS.
Although ozone exposure has not
previously been associated with ARDS, both
acute and chronic ozone exposure have been
associated with respiratory disease in
experimental and clinical studies. Acute
ozone exposure induces acute lung injury in
animals, primarily by producing an oxidant-
mediated injury to the lung epithelium that
leads to increased permeability and lung
inflammation (20). Controlled short-term
exposure to ozone (at doses that are
much higher than ambient pollutant
levels) in humans also causes airway
inflammation and oxidant injury (21–23).
In epidemiologic studies, acute exposure to
high ozone levels has been associated with
asthma exacerbations (24). Both ozone and
NO2 exposure over the preceding 6 weeks
were associated with acute exacerbation
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (25), a
syndrome that shares pathologic features
with ARDS. Chronic ozone exposure has
been associated with decreased lung growth
in children (26, 27) and decreased small
airway function in young adults (28). In
a study of more than 400,000 subjects,
chronic ozone exposure was associated with
mortality from respiratory causes (29);
data on ARDS as a cause of respiratory
mortality were not available in that study.
In the current study, the association
between ARDS and ozone exposure was
strongest in patients at risk for ARDS
from severe trauma. Because it is well
established that trauma-associated ARDS
is clinically and pathophysiologically
different from ARDS due to other causes
(30), ambient ozone exposure may uniquely
prime the lung to develop ARDS in the
setting of severe trauma. The higher rate
of smoking in the trauma group (54%)
compared with the nontrauma group (34%,
P , 0.0001) may have potentiated the
effects of ambient ozone exposure. Because
the incidence of ARDS in the trauma group
was lower (32%) than in the nontrauma
patients (40%), another potential

 explanation is that other ARDS risk factors,
such as sepsis, represent such a potent and
overwhelming stimulus for ALI that the
contribution of chronic ozone exposure to
risk of ARDS is less apparent. Finally, it is
possible that patients who develop ARDS
as a result of trauma spend more time
outdoors than patients with other ARDS
risk factors, leading to higher exposure
levels to ambient pollutants.
Smoking has only recently been
recognized to be an independent risk factor
for ARDS. Prospective studies report a
strong association between cigarette
smoking and risk of ARDS in severe trauma
(4), nonpulmonary sepsis (6), lung
transplant recipients (31), and patients
receiving blood transfusions (5). Indeed,
given the low levels of ambient ozone
exposure in the VALID cohort, it is
somewhat surprising that the effect of
smoking on development of ARDS does not
overwhelm the signal from ozone exposure.
Potential mechanisms for potentiation of
ARDS by smoking have considerable
overlap with mechanisms of ozone-induced
lung injury (32). These include harmful
effects on lung epithelial and endothelial
permeability and function (33, 34),
proinflammatory effects due to changes
in neutrophil alveolar macrophage
trafficking and function, and effects on cell-
mediated and humoral immunity (35, 36).
Smoking and air pollutant exposure have
previously been shown to have synergistic
effects on risk of obesity, pulmonary
function deficits, and lung cancer (37–39).
The strong interaction between smoking
and ozone exposure in the current study
suggests that ozone exposure may also
potentiate the harmful effects of tobacco
smoke on the lung regarding ARDS risk.
This observation is important, because both
smoking and air pollution exposure are
potentially modifiable environmental risk
factors for developing ARDS.
Although we found an association
between long-term NO2 exposure and
ARDS, this association was not significant
after controlling for ozone levels. There
are several potential explanations. First,
because nitrogen oxides are the most
prevalent ambient reactant for ozone
formation, the association between NO2
and risk of ARDS may only be indicative of
ozone exposure. Second, because nitrogen
oxides are predominantly traffic-related
pollutants, exposure estimates based on
regional monitors may not be accurate.
Studies that analyze distance to roadway
might be better suited to determine the
relationship between NO2 or other traffic-
related pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10
and development of ARDS. Finally, because
there were fewer monitoring stations for
NO2 than for ozone, this analysis had
less power.
This study has several strengths. First,
we studied a large heterogeneous cohort
of critically ill medical, surgical, and
trauma patients, enhancing the potential
generalizability of the findings. Second,
the patients were rigorously phenotyped
prospectively for both ARDS risk factors
and development of ARDS by physician
investigators. This is in sharp contrast to
many epidemiologic studies that have relied
on inherently less reliable death certificate
data or administrative coding for patient

 phenotyping. Third, residential addresses
and dates of admissions were used for
exposure estimates, allowing for
individualized rather than population- or
neighborhood-based exposure estimates.
Finally, the extensive prospective data
collection in the VALID study allowed us to
control for a large number of potential
confounders, decreasing but not eliminating
the possibility of residual confounding.
This study has some limitations. First,
patients were drawn from only one
geographic region, and air pollutant effects
may differ by geographic region. Second,
as in any study that does not directly
measure air pollutant levels, there is the
possibility of exposure misclassification.
To mitigate the concern of exposure
misclassification, a sensitivity analysis
included only patients who lived within
15 km of a monitor with similar results.
Exposure misclassification could also be
caused by reliance on the address provided
at hospital admission; information about
prior addresses during the exposure period
was not available. Exposure misclassification
may also arise from exposures that occur
away from the residence, including at the
place of occupation. Number of hours spent
outdoors versus indoors could also affect
total exposure and would not be captured
in our estimates. Third, the possibility of
residual confounding and in particular
residual spatial confounding remains. We
attempted to mitigate this concern by

Figure 4. Relationship between 3-year average ozone exposure level and predicted risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a logistic
regression model controlling for age, race, sex, enrollment month, smoking, alcohol use, insurance status, zip code–based median household income,
metro versus nonmetro residence, distance to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II in (A) all
patients in the ozone analysis, and (B) the same patients segregated by smoking status. The association between 3-year average ozone exposure level
and predicted risk of ARDS differed between smokers and nonsmokers and was only significant in the smokers. OR = odds ratio.

 including socioeconomic status (measured
by insurance source and zip code–based
median household income), metro versus
nonmetro residence, and distance to the
study hospital in the regression models.
However, given the concern for potential
unmeasured confounders, it will be
important to confirm these findings in
geographically diverse patient groups with
both higher and lower levels of ozone
exposure. Fourth, in this exploratory study,
we did not aim to strictly control the type I
error rate. To minimize the likelihood of
identifying false-positive associations, we
prespecified the variables and interaction
terms to include in the primary models
before data examination. Subgroup analyses
such as trauma/nontrauma were also
prespecified. Although we did not adjust for
multiple comparisons, our primary finding
of ozone–ARDS association has a P value of
less than 0.001, which would be significant
with post hoc significance adjustment using a
conservative Bonferroni method. Finally,
because this was an observational study,
causality cannot be inferred.
In summary, in a large group of
rigorously phenotyped critically ill patients,
we report an association between long-term
ozone exposure levels and risk of developing
ARDS. This risk was potentiated by cigarette
smoking and was strongest in patients with
severe trauma as their ARDS risk factor.
These findings indicate that ozone exposure
may be a previously unrecognized
environmental risk factor for ARDS. n
