Abstract
Background: 
This study quantified the potential reach of Internet smoking cessation interventions 
to support calculations of potential population impact (reach × effectiveness). Using a nationally 
representative survey, we calculated the number and proportion of adult smokers that look for 
cessation assistance online each year.
Methods: Five waves (2005, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017) of the National Cancer Institute’s Health 
Information National Trends Survey were examined. The survey asked US adults whether they 
ever go online to use the Internet, World Wide Web, or email and had used the Internet to look for 
information about quitting smoking within the past 12 months. We estimated the proportion and 
number of (1) all US adult smokers, and (2) online US adult smokers that searched for cessation 
information online. Cross-year comparisons were assessed with logistic regression.
Results: The proportion of all smokers who searched online for cessation information increased 
over the past decade (p < .001): 16.5% in 2005 (95% CI = 13.2% to 20.4%), 20.9% in 2011 (95% 
CI = 15.55% to 28.0%), 25.6% in 2013 (95% CI = 19.7% to 33.0%), 23.4% in 2015 (95% CI = 16.9% to 
31.0%), and 35.9% in 2017 (95% CI = 24.8% to 48.9%). Among online smokers only, approximately 
one third searched online for cessation information each year from 2005 through 2015. In 2017
, that 
proportion increased to 43.7% (95% CI = 29.7% to 58.7%), when an estimated 12.4 million online 
smokers searched for cessation help.
Conclusions: More than one third of all smokers turn to the Internet for help quitting each year, 
representing more than 12 million US adults.
Implications: 
This research provides contemporary estimates for the reach of Internet interventions 
for smoking cessation. Such estimates are necessary to estimate the population impact of Internet 
interventions on quit rates. The research finds more than 12 million US smokers searched online 
for cessation information in 2017

Introduction
The population impact of a public health intervention is a function 
of its effectiveness multiplied by its reach, where reach is defined as 
the absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of individu-
als willing to participate.1 Population impact is often a key element 
in the allocation of resources and decision making by policy makers 
and stakeholders.2 Ideally, a public health intervention maximizes 
both effectiveness and reach. However, mathematically equivalent 
metrics of impact can be yielded by one intervention with modest 
effectiveness but high reach, and a second intervention with higher 
levels of effectiveness but lower reach.
In the smoking cessation literature, the population impact of vari-
ous treatment modalities can be estimated—albeit imperfectly—using 
data from clinical trials. Recognizing that clinical trial data likely rep-
resent an upper bound of the effectiveness of any cessation interven-
tion, estimates from recent meta-analyses can be used to illustrate 
the relative public health impact of different treatment modalities. 
Telephone quitlines reach roughly 325 
000 smokers each year3 and 
yield a quit rate of 12.7% (95% CI = 11.3% to 14.2%),4 represent-
ing a potential population impact of 41 
275 quitters. Brief advice to 
quit from a health care provider yields a quit rate of 13.4% (95% 
CI = 10.9% to 16.1%)4 and is estimated to reach slightly more than 
half of all smokers (57.2%) each year.5 With 36.5 million smokers 
in the United States,6 the population impact of brief advice from a 
health care provider is estimated at roughly 2.8 million quitters annu-
ally. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is used by roughly 30% 
of all smokers each year,7 but its population impact is challenging 
to calculate given uncertain estimates of its “real-world” effective-
ness.8 If NRT used as an over-the-counter product is assumed to yield 
quit rates at the lower bound of clinical trial efficacy estimates for 
the nicotine patch (ie, 21.3% for 6–14 weeks of nicotine patch4), the 
estimated population impact is roughly 2.3 million quitters each year.
Estimating the population impact of Internet smoking cessa-
tion interventions is more challenging. The effectiveness of Internet 
interventions is well established,9,10 with quit rates that range from 
12.8%10 to 14.3%9 for interactive and tailored interventions. 
However, metrics of reach are sparse and outdated. In 2006, the Pew 
Research Center reported that 9% of Internet users in the United 
States had searched online for information about quitting smoking 
in the past year, up from 6% in 2002.11 Internet use has increased 
dramatically over the past 15 years, from 52% in 2000 to 88% in 
2016.12 There are no recent population-based estimates of the actual 
reach of Internet smoking cessation interventions.
This study calculated the reach of Internet cessation interven-
tions to US adult smokers in order to estimate the potential impact 
of this treatment modality. Across five waves of the National Cancer 
Institute’s Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS),13 
respondents were asked whether they had searched online for infor-
mation about smoking cessation. We used this item as a proxy for 
the potential reach of Internet interventions. We calculated the abso-
lute number and proportion of adult smokers in the United States 
that had searched online for help quitting smoking from 2005 to 
2017 and examined whether the reach of Internet interventions 
changed over this time period.
Methods
Design
This study used five waves of HINTS data (2005, 2011, 2013, 2015, 
2017). The purpose of HINTS is to collect nationally representative 
data at regular intervals about the American public’s use of cancer-
related information. All survey respondents were adults aged 18 
and over. The survey was administered by telephone in 2005 and 
by mail in the other waves included in these analyses. Population 
weights were calibrated to the American Community Survey of the 
US Census Bureau.14 Additional details about sampling methodology 
are available at https://hints.cancer.gov.
Measures
Smoking Status
Smoking status was assessed with two items: “Have you smoked at 
least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?” and “Do you now smoke 
cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?” Current smokers indi-
cated that they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes and now smoked 
“every day” or “some days.”
Internet Use
Respondents were considered Internet users if they answered “yes” 
to the item “Do you ever go on-line to access the Internet or World 
Wide Web, or to send and receive e-mail?”
Cessation Information Seeking
The key survey item of interest was “In the past 12 months, have 
you used the Internet for any of the following reasons?” Response 
option “c” was “Looked for information about quitting smoking” 
(yes/no). This wording was used in the 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 
waves. In 2005, the question was worded slightly differently (“In 
the past 12 months, have you done the following things while using 
the Internet?”), but the response option (“Looked for information 
about quitting smoking”) was identical. This item was asked only 
of respondents who previously indicated that they use the Internet.
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were conducted with the “survey” package in R, version 
3.4. Standard errors were calculated using replicate weights included 
with the HINTS dataset and the JKn jackknife method. For each 
year, we estimated the proportion and number of US adult cigar-
ette smokers who went online and searched for cessation informa-
tion. The primary analysis considered all US smokers; values for the 
key item (“Did you search online for cessation information?”) were 
imputed as “no” for smokers who responded that they never used the 
Internet. A secondary analysis included only smokers who reported 
using the Internet. Confidence intervals for proportions were created 
by fitting logistic regression models with the “svyciprop()” function 
of the “survey” package. Trend analyses were conducted as logistic 
regressions, treating year as a continuous variable with 2005 coded 
as 0. National estimates of numbers of smokers were obtained by 
calculating prevalence rates following casewise deletion of missing 
values, and then multiplying those prevalence rates by the total sum 
of population weights in the dataset.
We also compared estimates from the HINTS dataset with results 
from other datasets to assess convergent validity. We compared US 
adult smoking prevalence in 2005 and 2015 to estimates published 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on the 
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which used an identical 
item to assess smoking status.6 For 2005, we estimated the propor-
tion of online adults who had searched for online cessation infor-
mation (regardless of smoking status) in comparison with the 2006 
estimates reported by the Pew Research Center.11

Results
Primary Analysis: All Smokers Searching Online for 
Cessation Information
The proportion of all adult smokers who searched online for cessa-
tion information increased from 16.5% in 2005 to 35.9% in 2017 
(Table 1). There was a linear effect of time, such that the likelihood 
a smoker searched online for cessation information increased by an 
average of 8% each year relative to 2005 (relative risk = 1.08, 95% 
CI = 1.04% to 1.12%, p < .001). In 2017, an estimated 12 
434 
691 
US smokers searched online for cessation information.
Secondary Analysis: Online Adult Smokers 
Searching for Cessation Information
The proportion of US adult smokers who use the Internet increased 
from 2005 to 2017: 2005: 56.9% (95% CI = 53.0% to 60.6%); 
2011: 71.2% (95% CI = 63.4% to 77.9%); 2013: 73.1% (95% 
CI = 66.5% to 78.8%); 2015: 73.0% (95% CI = 66.1% to 79.0%); 
2017: 76.6% (95% CI = 65.3% to 85.0%). Although the pair-
wise comparison of these endpoints was significantly different, the 
test for an overall linear trend in Internet use among smokers was 
not (p = 0.09): the percentage of smokers who used the Internet 
increased sharply from 2005 to 2011, then remained compara-
tively stable through 2017. As shown in Table 1, the proportion of 
online adult smokers who searched for cessation information online 
remained relatively stable between 2005 and 2015 (range = 29.4% 
to 32.7%) then spiked in 2017 to 43.7% (95% CI = 29.7% to 
58.7%). The test for a linear effect of time was not significant 
 
(p value for trend = .1).
Comparison with Previous Results
Based on 2005 HINTS data, an estimated 9.8% of online US adults 
searched for cessation information in that year (95% CI = 8.31% 
to 11.7%). This estimate is within the ±3% margin of error for 
the Pew estimate of 9.0% in 2006,11 suggesting convergent valid-
ity across both surveys. Adult cigarette smoking prevalence in the 
US was 22.1% (95% CI = 20.5% to 23.8%) in 2005 and 14.8% 
(95% CI = 13.0% to 17.0%) in 2015 based on HINTS data. The 
confidence intervals for both estimates overlap with the respective 
confidence intervals from the NHIS dataset6—(95% CI = 22.9% to 
24.8%) and (95% CI = 15.9% to 17.6%), respectively—again sug-
gesting convergent validity.
Discussion
Our analyses of five waves of HINTS data yielded the following find-
ings: (1) The proportion of all smokers who search online for infor-
mation about quitting smoking each year has more than doubled 
over the past 12 years, most likely a function of increased Internet 
use throughout all segments of the US population; (2) The propor-
tion of online adult smokers who have searched online for quit 
smoking assistance has remained stable at roughly 30% for nearly 
a decade, until a recent spike in 2017 to 43.7%; (3) In 2017, we 
estimate that more than 12 million smokers searched online for quit 
smoking information.
This estimate of reach helps to define the potential population 
impact of Internet cessation interventions. Assuming treatment 
effectiveness of 12.8% for tailored and interactive interventions as 
reported in the most recent Cochrane meta-analysis10 and a poten-
tial reach to 12 million smokers yields roughly 1.6 million quitters 
each year. Table 2 presents these estimates alongside other treatment 
modalities. These numbers are intended to be illustrative (not deter-
minative), but they make clear the important role of Internet inter-
ventions in comprehensive tobacco control.
Two limitations of this study warrant comment. First, search-
ing for smoking cessation information on the Internet is not syn-
onymous with engaging with an evidence-based cessation treatment 
program capable of promoting abstinence. While our analyses indi-
cate that more than 12 million smokers search for assistance online, 
the behavior that follows may range from casual browsing to full 
engagement. Minimal use of online cessation resources may be suf-
ficient for some smokers to quit,15 but this should not be presumed 
for all smokers. Relatedly, many publicly available Internet cessa-
tion programs are not evidence-based and lack features of interven-
tions tested in clinical trials.16 Such programs may be less effective, 
entirely ineffective, or even iatrogenic. Our estimates of potential 
impact, therefore, may represent an upper bound of the number of 
quitters that could be expected if all smokers engaged with proven, 
evidence-based Internet programs. This limitation is not unique 
to Internet programs. Estimates of the potential impact for other 
cessation modalities delivered “in the wild” may also represent an 
upper bound. For example, health care providers may not deliver 
brief advice at all or as effectively as in clinical trials,17–19 and smok-
ers may not adhere to recommended dosing or usage guidelines for 
NRT. Our analyses illustrate the potential impact of each modality 
based on best available estimates of reach and effectiveness.

Second, we are puzzled by the spike in the proportion of online 
adults who reported searching for information in 2017. Sample size 
was not consistent across all cycles of HINTS, including a smaller 
sample size in 2017. This observed increase should be interpreted in 
the context of a larger confidence interval. The 2017 HINTS admin-
istration was the only wave that started in January, so New Year’s 
resolutions may also account for some of this spike. Alternatively, 
this spike may be linked to state and federal antitobacco campaigns 
that included online calls to action or some other environmental 
change.
In summary, this research provides contemporary estimates for 
an upper bound to the reach of Internet interventions for smoking 
cessation. Previously, the most recent available estimates were from 
2006—a different era in terms of Internet usage. These analyses 
found that, in 2017, 35.9% of US smokers searched online for help 
quitting. Each search represents an opportunity to connect smokers 
with evidence-based treatment options. Given the ability to reach 
roughly one third of all smokers and the demonstrated effectiveness 
that is comparable to other recommended forms of cessation treat-
ment, Internet interventions have the potential for substantial impact 
on population quit rates.
