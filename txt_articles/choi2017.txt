 IBD is a chronic relapsing–remitting disorder of the 
gastrointestinal tract, consisting of two main subtypes: 
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The aetiology of 
IBD is multifactorial, with the disease arising follow­
ing incompletely defined environmental triggers 
in genet 
ically predisposed individuals and resulting in 
an  
aberrant immune­driven inflammatory response 
towards an altered gut microbiota1.
The incidence of IBD is increasing worldwide, 
with a prevalence now approaching 0.5% in the West2. 
For patients with long­standing colonic inflammation, 
colorectal cancer (CRC) is a recognized and feared 
complication. Studies quantifying the increased risk 
of CRC in patients with IBD have generated vari 
able 
results reflecting differences in country of origin, 
study population and disease duration3. The first large 
meta­ 
analysis assessing CRC risk in patients with 
IBD showed a risk of 2% at 10 years after ulcerative 
colitis diagnosis, 8% at 20 years and 18% at 30 years 
after colitis onset4. However, other studies suggest 
that CRC rates in patients with ulcerative colitis might 
be  
declining5.
Important clinical differences exist between colitis­ 
associated CRC (CA­CRC) arising in patients with 
IBD, compared with sporadic CRC seen in the general 
population. CA­CRCs tend to affect younger patients6 
(average age of 50–60 years in IBD7,8 compared with 
65–75 years for sporadic CRCs in the general popula­
tion), they are more likely to be found in the proximal 
colon in the presence of Crohn’s disease9 or primary 
sclerosing cholangitis10, they are more commonly syn­
chronous (15–20% of CA­CRC11,12 compared with 3–5% 
of sporadic CRC) and have an increased frequency of 
mucinous or signet ring cell histology13.
Patients with long­standing extensive colonic IBD 
are enrolled into surveillance programmes that aim 
to detect precursor colitis­associated dysplasia, a pre­ 
malignant equivalent of sporadic adenomas. In practice, 
detecting dysplasia at endoscopy can be challenging. 
These lesions are often flat with subtle borders that 
are difficult to appreciate in the presence of concomi­
tant inflammation; they might be readily missed in a 
background of extensive mucosal scarring and pseudo­
polyposis. Missed dysplasia might be a contributing 
 
factor in the stubbornly high rates of interval CA­CRCs 
that develop between scheduled endoscopies14.
When dysplasia is detected, patient management 
remains fraught with challenges. The diagnosis of IBD­
associated dysplasia is confirmed through histo 
logical 
analysis with defining features including nuclear atypia, 
mucin depletion and an irregular crypt architecture 
with loss of basal­to­luminal epithelial cell matur­
ation15. Immunohistochemical staining for markers 
including p53 and β­catenin are sometimes used to 
complement histological classification16. In practice, 
dysplasia  
grading suffers from substantial inter 
observer 
variability and can be challenging to differentiate from 
a regenerating epithelium17. With improved endoscopic

Clonal evolution of colorectal cancer 
in IBD
Chang‑Ho R. Choi1,2*, Ibrahim Al Bakir1,2*, Ailsa L. Hart2 and Trevor A. Graham1
Abstract | Optimizing the management of colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in IBD requires a 
fundamental understanding of the evolutionary process underpinning tumorigenesis. In IBD, 
clonal evolution begins long before the development of overt neoplasia, and is probably 
accelerated by the repeated cycles of epithelial wounding and repair that are characteristic 
of the condition. Here, we review the biological drivers of mutant clone selection in IBD with 
particular reference to the unique histological architecture of the intestinal epithelium coupled 
with the inflammatory microenvironment in IBD, and the unique mutation patterns seen in 
IBD-driven neoplasia when compared with sporadic adenomas and CRC. How these data can 
be leveraged as evolutionary-based biomarkers to predict cancer risk is discussed, as well as how 
the efficacy of CRC surveillance programmes and the management of dysplasia can be improved. 
From a research perspective, the longitudinal surveillance of patients with IBD provides 
an under-exploited opportunity to investigate the biology of the human gastrointestinal tract 
over space and time.

 imaging, areas of low­grade and indefinite dysplasia 
are now detected in up to 10% of surveillance colono­
scopies18. Some patients with IBD­associated low­
grade dysplasia are offered more intensive surveillance, 
whereas others are offered the option of colectomy, 
with all the associated risks of major surgery and con­
sequences of life with a stoma. Data from the largest 
UK surveillance registry data has demonstrated that 
the 10­year CRC risk from low­grade dysplasia is only 
30%11; others have shown that low­grade dysplasia 
regresses in at least half of patients19 although the mech­
anism is unclear. Together, these findings indicate that 
the current  
primary aim of dysplasia identification in 
CRC surveillance is inadequate as a cancer­risk stratifi­
cation tool. A clear clinical need to better understand 
the molecular aetiology of CA­CRC remains, which 
would enable the identifi 
cation of more efficacious 
biomarkers of  
cancer risk. Recognizing the develop­
ment of CA­CRC as an evolution 
ary process prov­
ides a novel and powerful perspective to understand 
this disease, in a manner that can be directly lever­
aged to improve the clinical care of this  
challenging 
 
patient group.
This Review will summarize the evidence support­
ing the presence of extensive inflammation­driven clonal 
evolution in IBD, long before the development of any 
clinically apparent neoplasia, and contrast this under­
standing with our current knowledge of sporadic CRC 
carcinogenesis. Finally, we discuss how knowledge of 
this occult evolutionary process can aid prognostication 
and ultimately improve the efficacy of IBD­associated 
cancer surveillance.
Evidence of clonal evolution in IBD
Occult evolution in colitis
Carcinogenesis is a process of clonal evolution20–22. 
Somatic cells acquire mutations that alter their pheno­
type, which might confer them and their progeny a 
growth and/or survival advantage within their cur­
rent microenvironment, enabling the cells to persist 
and clonally expand. A classic example is mutations 
of APC in the context of colorectal adenoma forma­
tion that result in persistent β­catenin signalling and 
increased cellular proliferation23. With the occurrence 
of further mutations, additional selection pressures 
and clonal expansion could occur. In some cases, this 
process eventually results in the development of a 
malignant phenotype.
In IBD, the clonal evolution of cancer begins long 
before the development of a true malignancy. Numerous 
studies, using a variety of different molecular techniques, 
have reported extensive genomic and epi 
genomic alter­
ations in morphologically normal intestinal mucosa 
(TABLE 1). The surprisingly high mutation burden of the 
ostensibly normal IBD epithelium reveals the ‘occult 
evolution’ that is occurring in the inflamed bowel. 
These mutant clones clearly experience a pos 
itive selec­
tive pressure (mutants cells are fitter than non 
mutant 
cells) as they can expand to fill large areas of the intes­
tinal mucosa24 and, in one extreme case, the entire 
colon length25.
Mutant clones frequently bear mutations in key 
tumour­suppressor genes including TP53 (encod­
ing p53) and CDKN2A (encoding p16), and in 
the proto­ 
oncogene KRAS24–27. Remarkably, these 
cancer­ 
associated mutations do not alone cause neo­
plastic growth as the mutations are detected in non­ 
neoplastic tissue24–27. These ‘key’ mutations might 
be necessary but insufficient for tumour growth, or 
the phenotypic effects of these mutations are crit­
ically modu 
lated by epigenetic and/or microenviron­
mental constraints present in non­neoplastic mucosa. 
Nevertheless, the clonal expansion of these cancer­ 
associated mutants provides a genetic foundation for the 
phenomenon of ‘field cancer 
ization’ (REF. 28), which is 
the preconditioning of a large area of histologically nor­
mal epithelium to the future development of neoplastic 
lesions29 (FIG. 1). Field cancerization probably explains 
the high frequency of synchronous and metachronous 
neoplastic lesions in patients with IBD11,12.
Inflammation accelerates evolution
The mutation burden in the morphologically normal 
non­IBD colon is not well characterised; however, the 
limited evidence available to date suggests that the nor­
mal mutation rate is less than in patients with IBD30,31 
and that widespread clonal expansion of mutant cells 
is rare32. Consequently, the inflamed bowel appears 
to be a ‘hot bed’ of somatic clonal evolution, but the 
 
reasons why are currently unknown. Our hypothesis is 
that the evolutionary process in IBD is accelerated by 
long­standing repeated cycles of epithelial wounding 
and repair that are characteristic of IBD. Mechanistically, 
IBD­associated inflammation has the potential to 
mediate clonal evolution by any, or all, of the following 
three mechanisms: generating a mutagenic pressure; 
providing a selective advantage to those clones able to 
survive a (cytotoxic) inflammatory insult; providing a 
selective advantage to those clones able to more rapidly 
 
repopulate the healing mucosa.
DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)­treated mice offer a 
unique opportunity to assess flat and polypoid dys 
plasia 
in a single animal model; both these lesions develop as 
a consequence of the induced chemical colitis. Here, the 
severity of inflammation correlates with the propen­
sity to generate IBD­like flat dysplastic lesions; inflam­
mation scores were an order of magnitude higher in 
colons containing flat dysplasia compared with those 
with polypoid dysplasia33. Moreover, administration of 
Key points
• Colorectal cancer development in IBD begins many years before the development 
of neoplasia because of occult evolution within the inflamed bowel
• The cycles of wounding and repair characteristic of IBD provide a selective pressure 
for mutant cells that are able to rapidly heal the mucosa and withstand the 
inflammatory insult
• Measuring and modulating the occult evolutionary process offers new avenues for 
effectively predicting and preventing colorectal cancer in IBD
• Repositories of IBD surveillance materials offer a surreptitious opportunity to study 
in vivo clonal evolution in time and space in humans

 5­aminosalicylates, the mainstay of treatment for ulcer­
ative colits, had a varying effect on the incidence and 
progression of dysplastic lesions on the basis of mor­
phology, with fewer flat lesions that were unchanged in 
size, but the same number of polypoid lesions that were 
reduced in size34.
Patient­based studies confirm that inflammation has 
a substantial cumulative role in increasing CRC risk in 
IBD, with observational studies consistently demonstrat­
ing that CA­CRC risk development is closely linked to 
the extent35, duration4 and severity of inflammation7. 
Histological studies suggest that neoplastic lesions arise 
from a field of marked chronic inflammation, telomere 
shortening, DNA damage and senescence, with ‘escape 
from senescence’ a key step in the transition from low­
grade to high­grade dysplasia36. Thus, a comprehensive 
understanding of carcinogenesis in IBD should not be 
limited to the study of mutation generation and spread 
via the epithelial crypt stem cell niche, but should also 
include a concomitant analysis of the inflammatory stro­
mal microenvironment. Therapeutic interventions that 
modulate cancer risk in IBD must target these  
aberrant 
microenvironmental changes.
In addition to native cells of the epithelial layer, 
immune cells and bacteria migrate up to the crypt 
as part of IBD pathogenesis, inducing a myriad of 
inflammatory cytokines and intracellular signalling 
pathways1 that are beyond the scope of this Review37. 
These pathways act directly on non­neoplastic and dys­
plastic epithelial cells, which can potentially modulate 
cancer risk. Animal model studies demonstrate how 
transcription signalling by NF­κB — a master regula­
tor of inflammation38 that has a key role in IBD patho­
genesis39 —  
promotes the survival of pre­malignant 
epithelial clones40. IBD­mediated inflammation also 
promotes β­catenin stabil 
ity through aberrant PI3K–
AKT41,42 and NF­κB43 signalling to further enhance 
canonical Wnt activity. Epithelial STAT3 signalling is 
also upregulated in active IBD44. Mouse models show 
that, although STAT3 pathway activation helps amelior­
ate the effects of chemical colitis by reducing epithelial 
damage and inflam 
mation, it also promotes the survival 
and progression of pre­ 
malignant epithelial clones45. 
Conceivably, non­cell­ 
autonomous effects similar to 
those identified in other systems (for example, in a breast 
cancer model46) might also be involved. In this same 
context, the effect of an altered immune system in IBD 
on immunosurveillance necessary to limit CRC initi­
ation and progression  
warrants further investigation. 
For example, CA­CRCs and dysplastic lesions show a 
greater infiltration of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, but 
substantially less granzyme B expression than  
sporadic 
CRCs, suggesting impaired cytotoxic function47.
Emerging studies in the field of microbiome analy 
sis 
are revealing the role of the gut microbiota and intestinal 
barrier function in tumorigenesis, and animal studies 
are beginning to shed some light onto the complex and 
dynamic interplay between the altered immune system, 
the aberrant gut microbiome and cancer development 
in IBD37. In practice, it remains difficult to determine 
whether intestinal dysbiosis and mucosal barrier changes 
drive mucosal pathology, or represent a secondary con­
sequence of disease. However, these options are not 
mutually exclusive. A prominent example comes from 
Arthur et al.48, who used Il10­knockout mice to demon­
strate how chronic inflammation prevents the home­
ostatic elimination of cancer­ 
associated Escherichia 
coli, inducing the upregulation of the polyketide syn­
thase gene responsible for the genotoxic compound 
coli 
bactin. In turn, E. coli with genotoxic capabilities 
have been shown to drive tumorigenesis in this mouse 
model, in a manner independent of inflammation sever­
ity49. This effect is probably dependent on a breakdown 
 
in the mucosal barrier50, enabling the direct exposure of 
the epithelium to colibactin. Subsequent human stud­
ies confirm that colibactin­equipped E. coli are mark­
edly more prevalent in colonic mucosa from patients 
with sporadic CRC and patients with ulcerative colitis 
compared with controls (patients with sporadic polyps 
or IBS)49,51. Similarly, Fusobacterium have been found 
to promote tumorigenesis in animal models52 and are 
over­ 
represented in both sporadic adenomas and CRC53, 
as well as in non­neoplastic IBD mucosa54. Finally, simi­
lar changes in colonic mucus affecting IBD, colon polyps 
and colon cancer have been described55. A prominent 
example is the re­ 
expression of the mucin­associated 
oncofoetal carbohydrate, sialyl­Tn­antigen, at higher 
rates in patients with ulcerative colitis who subsequently 
progress to dysplasia or cancer  than those that remain 
cancer­free56. This increased expression seems to be 
independent of inflammation severity.
Somatic mutations in CA‑CRC
The different evolutionary pressures offer an explan­
ation for the altered pattern of somatic mutations 
seen in CA­CRC compared with sporadic cancers57,58. 
Available data show that CA­CRCs have increased 
mutation frequencies of various intracellular and inter­
cellular signalling molecules57,58. The most  
notable 
mutations include IL16, a gene encoding a chemo­
attractant cytokine that is overexpressed in IBD in an 
inflammation­dependent manner59. IL­16 has a poten­
tial role in directly mediating inflammation60 and so we 
speculate that a gene mutation encoding this protein 
could provide a survival advantage in the inflamed 
bowel. Another noteworthy mutation is in RADIL, 
a gene encoding a modulator of Rho GTPase signalling 
in cell migration, which might speculatively provide a 
selective advantage in mucosal healing57.
Mutation signature analysis61 of CA­CRCs57 demon­
strate novel trinucleotide context changes not seen in 
sporadic CRCs (an over­representation of A>C trans­
versions at AA dinucleotides). The predominance of 
C>T transitions at CG dinucleotides in CA­CRCs is in 
keeping with ‘accelerated ageing’ through rapid cell turn­
over62 rather than the accumulation of direct genotoxic 
hits caused by inflammation­associated carcinogens. 
Indeed, colitis that progresses to high­grade dysplasia 
or CA­CRC demonstrates field changes in ostensibly 
normal epithelium in keeping with accelerated age­
ing, including telomere shortening36 and age­related 
CpG methylation63.

 Although TP53 mutations are found at similar fre­
quencies in both sporadic CRC and CA­CRC, TP53 
alteration is an early event in CA­CRC that is found 
in non­tumour, and even nondysplastic, mucosa64. 
Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests a role for TP53 
mutations in promoting cell survival and growth65. 
Interestingly, the increased frequency and early onset 
of TP53 mutations might provide an additional explan­
ation for the fairly high proportion of flat dysplastic and 
cancer 
ous lesions seen in IBD. One study66 demonstrated 
a significant variability in neoplasm morphology that is 
dependent on Tp53 mutation status, with flat lesions 
associated with Tp53−/− mice treated with DSS (~85% 
flat lesions), and polypoid lesions significantly associated 
with Tp53+/− and Tp53+/+ DSS­treated mice (~17% flat 
lesions; P <0.0001).
Perhaps most notably, CA­CRCs in humans show a 
paucity of APC mutations57,58 compared with sporadic 
adenomas and CRC, in which APC mutations are a 
common, important and early ‘gatekeeper’ event67. APC 
encodes a key regulator of the canonical Wnt pathway 
driving β­catenin signalling. Disruption of normal APC 
function is sufficient to constitutively activate this path­
way and initiate sporadic adenomas in the noninflamed 
bowel67,68. The lack of APC mutations in colitis raises the 
possibility of IBD­generated inflammation­mediated 
alterations of underlying Wnt signalling cascades that 
render APC mutations dispensable for tumorigenesis. 
Indeed, immunostaining studies of colonic epithelium 
confirm high levels of Wnt signalling, as demonstrated 
by increased nuclear to cytoplasmic β­catenin levels in 
human ulcerative colitis tissue69. The β­catenin levels are 
midway between normal noninflamed epithelium and 
established CRC, thereby partially replicating the con­
stitutive canonical Wnt pathway activation of an APC 
mutation. Furthermore, wounding of the intestinal epi­
thelium induces a host of canonical and noncanonical 
Wnt signalling pathways by mesenchymal cells70.
Aside from these pertinent genomic differences, the 
genomes of CA­CRCs and sporadic CRCs in humans 
interestingly show broad similarities. Both bear a high 
frequency of TP53 alteration and mutations in the onco­
genes KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, CTNNB1 and the tumour 
suppressors SMAD4 and FBXW7 are at relatively high, 
albeit slightly different, frequencies57,58,71. Microsatellite 
instability is also common to a subset of both cancer 
types72,73. Together, these data imply some convergence 
in the outcome of evolutionary processes of sporadic 
CRC and CA­CRC development. Dysregulation of key 
pathways such as Wnt signalling and p53 function seem 
to be necessary for tumour formation in the colon, 
irrespec 
tive of the presence or absence of a (prior) 
inflammatory stimulus. Studies of clonal evolution at 
the level of the crypt are discussed in the next section, 
advancing our understanding of the survival advan­
tage these genomic changes provide, specifically in the 
 
context of IBD­mediated inflammation.
Mechanisms of clonal expansion
Colonic crypt architecture
The basic functional unit of the colon is the crypt, 
a finger­ 
like invagination into the underlying lamina 
propria lined by a single layer of columnar epithelial 
cells. Under homeostatic conditions, the majority of 
crypt cells migrate towards the top of the luminal sur­
face over the course of approximately a week, after which 
they are shed in the lumen74. Migration out of the crypt 
base is associated with differentiation into specialized 
cell types, including absorptive enterocytes and sup­
porting secretory cell lineages75. These differentiated 
cells are continuously replenished by a small number of 
multi 
potent stem cells located in the base of each crypt, 
known as the stem cell niche76. In the presence of injury 
to this actively cycling stem cell pool, cells from further 
up the crypt axis fall into the crypt base and regain active 
stem cell properties77. Carcinogenic mutations probably 
first start accumulating in the long­lived stem cell line­
ages of the crypt, as the lifespan of non­stem cells is 
too short for them to acquire the necessary mutations 
before being shed. Although LGR5+ crypt base stem 
cells are clearly implicated in mutant­APC­driven spor­
adic CRC and familial adenomatous polyposis78, the 
precise stem cell(s) of origin in IBD­driven neoplasia 
remains undefined.
Stem‑cell‑level evolution
Clonal expansion in the colon begins with the progeny 
of a mutant cell repopulating an entire crypt in a process 
referred to as monoclonal conversion of the crypt79. Even 
in the absence of any mutant cells, the stem cells in a 
crypt are randomly lost and replaced by a neighbour 
ing 
stem cell lineage in a process called drift. This process 
eventually results in extinction of all stem cell popula­
tions except for those originating from the one ‘lucky’ 
stem cell clone that repopulates the whole crypt, in a 
process referred to as niche succession79.

 Some mutations generated in IBD will bias the com­
petition between stem cells to make it more likely that a 
particular mutant stem cell will go on to repopulate the 
entire crypt. In vivo lineage tracing studies of intestinal 
crypt cells in recombinant mouse models have been used 
to measure the advantage of tumorigenic mutations. 
Although a wild­type stem cell will replace another wild­
type stem cell 50% of the time, in keeping with neutral 
competition80,81, a stem cell with a Kras mutation will 
replace a wild­type neighbour stem cell in ~75% of com­
petitive divisions81. Interestingly, Tp53 mutations confer 
no substantial competitive advantage in a healthy crypt: 
these mutant cells will replace wild­type cells only 50% of 
the time81. However, in the context of chemically induced 
colitis (via DSS treatment), Tp53 mutation increases the 
odds of lineage replacement to 58%81. The differing fate 
of Tp53 mutations in an inflamed crypt compared with a 
noninflamed crypt reflects the unique selective pressures 
that exist in the inflamed bowel.
In the healthy bowel, tight morphogen gradients gen­
erated by cells in and adjacent to the crypt82 restrict the 
size of the stem cell niche, keeping stem cell numbers 
constant80. The epithelial wounding that is a hallmark 
of colitis clearly disrupts these signalling gradients70,82. 
Additionally, a study in transgenic mice shows how the 
inflammation­mediated NF­κB pathway can induce 
dedifferentiation of non­stem cells, thereby increasing 
the size of the pool of long­lived cell lineages that can 
contribute to carcinogenesis43. Although the precise 
mechanisms of morphogen gradient disruption are yet 
to be characterized in human tissue, the altered cellular 
composition of the supportive pericryptal fibroblasts in

 colitis is a notable example of a niche structure alter­
ation83 that has been associated with neoplastic progres­
sion in IBD84. Understanding the altered morphogen 
gradients in IBD is key to understanding how and why 
particular mutant cells have an evolutionary advantage 
in IBD.
Crypt‑level evolution
Once a mutant clone has repopulated an entire crypt, 
further clone expansion is possible by crypt fission, the 
mechanism by which human colonic crypts divide79. 
Thus, the initial cell­level evolution within the crypt 
switches to crypt­level evolution and, therefore, natural 
selection of the crypt population drives field canceriza­
tion. Crypt fission is the main driver of clonal expan­
sion in the human colon85; indeed, the fission of crypts 
surrounding a wound is the primary mechanism of epi­
thelial restitution in the intestine70. Our understanding 
of the mechanistic drivers of fission is surprisingly lack­
ing74. 3D imaging studies suggest a critical role for the 
relative arrangement of stem cells and their supportive 
niche­providing Paneth cells86, and mathematical model­
ling indicates that a plausible mechanism for triggering 
fission is exceeding a threshold number of stem cells87.
Crypt fission is a mechanism for mucosal healing70, 
and the increase in frequency of crypt­fission events in 
the IBD bowel is a reflection of the wounding or repair 
that is characteristic of the disease. Cheng and col­
leagues88 found that, although <1 in 200 crypts in nor­
mal human colon are undergoing fission, this rate was 
increased at least 60­fold in IBD. Mutations that increase 
the rate of crypt fission are probably positively selected 
for in the IBD bowel, as these mutants are better able to 
heal the damaged mucosa. In line with this hypothesis, 
mutant Kras crypts divide 30­fold faster than their wild­
type counterparts in the mouse intestine89, and Tp53 
mutation is also reported to increase the crypt  
fission 
rate in mice90. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that some 
mutants which undergo substantial clonal expansion and 
populate multiple crypts in the non­neoplastic epithe­
lium achieve this expansion by the acquisition of muta­
tion(s) that positively regulate crypt fission (FIG. 1). This 
selection for mucosal healing rather than neoplasia per se 
might be the underlying reason for the common occur­
rence of flat dysplastic lesions in IBD. Consequently, in 
our opinion, we believe that assessing the inflamed epi­
thelium for clonally expanded mutations offers a ‘natural 
experiment’ that can be exploited to identify new genes 
that modulate crypt fission. This novel approach recog­
nizes one of the old adages of cancer biology: the overlap 
between wound healing and carcinogenesis91.
Other potential mechanisms
One intriguing finding from IBD mapping studies is 
the detection of mutant populations containing the 
exact same point mutation (single nucleotide variant) or 
copy number alteration (CNA), extending across most 
of the colon length25,92. Although pancolonic selection 
pressures could plausibly select for the same altered cel­
lular or crypt functions repeatedly through convergent 
evolution, inducing the exact same point mutation is 
highly unlikely and so the very large mutant populations 
observed are likely to be clonal in origin. Additionally, 
how mucosal repopulation by fission of adjacent crypts 
alone could explain the same mutation spread across 
the entire bowel in a matter of a few years is difficult 
to comprehend. These findings raise the possibility 
of unidenti 
fied healing mechanisms in colitis. Mouse 
model studies show that free­floating organoids intro­
duced intra 
luminally can successfully engraft on to an 
inflamed bowel to generate long­lasting functional crypt 
populations, but not in the context of a non 
inflamed 
colon93. In light of the phenotypic elasticity of multiple 
crypt cell populations and the rapid rate of epithelial 
shedding in active IBD, this finding raises the intriguing 
possibility of long­range stem cell migration following 
shedding and distant stem cell re­engraftment. However, 
to date, no evidence exists for this speculative healing 
mechanism in human studies or in IBD  
animal models. 
Conversely, precedence for this process in other model 
organisms does exist; long­distance stem cell migra­
tion has been noted to occur between widely separated 
 
ovarian  
follicles in Drosophila94.
Evolutionary management of cancer risk
Predicting cancer risk in IBD
Great interest exists for the development of cancer 
biomarkers in IBD95, with DNA aneuploidy96 and/or 
TP53 mutations64,97,98 as the most prominent examples 
of genetic biomarkers. However, extensive within­ 
lesion genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity are now 
considered hallmarks of both carcinogenesis99 and pre­ 
malignant pathology22. Indeed, in the pre­ 
malignant 
disease, Barrett oesophagus, which confers a ~30­fold 
increased risk of developing oesophageal adeno­
carcinoma100, sequencing studies of biopsies from non­ 
neoplastic Barrett segments demonstrate cancer­related 
mutations in a plethora of different genes. With the 
exception of TP53, these mutations occur at similar 
frequencies across nondysplastic through to high­grade 
dysplasia and even adeno 
carcinoma tissues101. In spor­
adic CRC, large­scale sequencing projects reveal only 
seven genes that are recurrently mutated in >10% 
of patients, meaning that the overwhelming majority of 
mutations were unique to small subsets of patients71. 
Collectively, these data indicate the improbability that a 
single gene or small set of genetic changes can effectively 
assay the vast array of different molecular pathways 
that lead to cancer102, so it is unlikely that traditional 
candidate­ 
gene biomarker approaches will yield clin­
ically applicable prognostic biomarkers. Nevertheless, as 
the cost of sequencing continues to decrease, the option 
to cost­effectively sequence a relatively large panel of 
genes that encompass all the key pathways involved in 
CA­CRC development (once these have all been identi­
fied) could well be a  
possibility — such an approach 
already shows promise in acute myeloid leukaemia103.
A different approach involves looking for robust prog­
nostic biomarkers from measurements of the under 
lying 
evolutionary process itself. The rationale here is that, 
although the evolutionary paths might differ between 
patients, limiting the efficacy of candidate­gene­based

 studies, somatic evolution is always subject to the same 
rules and the selective pressures of an inflamed bowel 
are similar across patients. Thus, biomarkers based upon 
measurements of these  
evolutionary rules could have 
universal applicability.
One example of a candidate ‘evolutionary biomarker’ 
is clonal diversity. In ecological studies, the level of 
diversity in a population is a major determinant of its 
evolvability104. If there is no diversity, natural selection 
cannot operate, whereas diverse populations are likely to 
adapt and evolve quickly. Translated to IBD, the clonal 
diversity within the bowel is a potential evolutionary 
biomarker of cancer risk and, notably, measuring clonal 
diversity requires no substantial prior knowledge of the 
precise genetic and epigenetic pathways driving tumori­
genesis. To date, no studies have used genetic diversity 
measures for CA­CRC risk, but the principle has pre­
viously been applied to Barrett oesophagus. Genetic 
diversity measures were predictors of cancer risk even 
after controlling for age, Barrett segment length, TP53 
mutation and aneuploidy status105, and were robust to 
the molecular assay used to detect diversity106. A second 
approach that also reflects evolvability would be detec­
tion of large clonal expansions as a measure of ongoing 
evolution. Preliminary studies in patients with ulcer­
ative colitis found progressors (high­grade dysplasia or 
cancer) have substantially larger clonal expansions than 
nonprogressors, by using 4–5 biopsies (spaced ~20 cm 
apart) for the detection of mutant clones with shared 
point mutation(s)107. This work highlights a promising 
avenue to explore. Additionally, changes over time in 
the clonal composition of the epithelium might also be 
prognostic, irrespective of what those changes might 
be, because they are also an indicator of ongoing evolu­
tion. In Barrett oesophagus, neoplastic initiation seems 
to be abrupt, but single nucleotide polymorphism array 
studies suggest that considerable discriminating changes 
in clonal composition occur 24 months before oesoph­
ageal adenocarcinoma detection108. Finally, analys 
ing 
changes in immune, mesenchyme and/or microbiota 
microenvironmental composition (which form the 
basis for future evolution), and/or their modu 
lation 
by the epithelial cells themselves109, offers yet another 
approach. Concomitant genomic– 
microenvironmental 
evolutionary studies could also help answer a ‘chicken­
and­egg’ question in CA­CRC: which came first, the 
altered microenvironment that predisposes to cancer 
risk, or the predisposed clones themselves?
Use of surveillance biopsies
In our opinion, IBD­associated cancer surveillance 
is an ideal ‘model system’ in which to study in vivo 
inflammation­associated carcinogenesis in humans. 
Multiple biopsies are routinely taken at each surveil­
lance colonoscopy and subjected to histological assess­
ment for inflammation severity and endo 
scopically 
invisible dysplasia. This process creates an extensive 
tissue library of archival specimens reflecting the 
spatio 
temporal clonal evolutionary changes that occur 
during carcinogenesis. Thus, this rich resource can be 
utilized to better understand the biology of the intestine 
and how it is subverted during cancer development. 
The spatial distribution of genetic alterations across 
surveillance biopsies indicates the order of mutations 
that led to the current clone composition: a ‘trunk’ or 
‘founder’ mutation present in all biopsies arose before a 
‘branch’ mutation that is limited to a subset of biopsies. 
A phylogenetic analysis of multiple biopsies at a single 
time­point (from an individual endoscopy) provides a 
mechanism for inferring the  
pattern of genetic changes 
over space and time.
Several studies have used mapping biopsies to 
 
analyse the spatiotemporal changes in clonal popula­
tions, including the relationship between CNAs and key 
gene mutations. In early studies, analysis of ulcerative 
colitis colonoscopic biopsy specimens taken over an 
8­year period using flow cytometry showed that aneu­
ploidy can be detected before the onset of dysplasia in 
at least 10% of patients, with CNAs becoming more 
widespread over time in a subset of patients110. TP53 
gene mutations can also be found in morphologically 
normal mucosa and correlate strongly with the presence 
of aneuploidy64. TP53 loss of heterozygosity was found 
more commonly in dysplasia, suggesting that it might 
be a later event111. Longitudinal analysis of three patients 
with Crohn’s disease using targeted sequencing of TP53, 
KRAS and CDKN2A revealed that some cancer cases 
had arisen from a field of mutant clones that expanded 
well beyond the cancer resection margin and formed 
many years before cancer growth25. Similarly, large­scale 
regional clonal expansions were associated with cancer 
occurrence in a study that used hypermutable non­
coding polyguanine tracts as neutral lineage markers to 
trace clonal expansions across colectomy specimens107.
A genome­wide comparative genomic hybridisation 
array study found that CNAs of chromosomal segments 
are present in most colons with pancolitis, and are at 
increased frequency in those with neoplasia, without left 
or right colon bias92. Interestingly, this study reported that 
most CNAs (~85%) were unique to a single biopsy (with 
substantial differences detected in CNA profiles from 
biopsies as little as 2 cm apart) with no shared CNAs 
between high­grade dysplasia and cancer, and the non­
dysplastic surrounding mucosa. This finding suggests 
that genetic field cancerization does not universally 
precede cancer development, and instead some patients 
show focal genetic instability. Consequently, the detection 
of these different occult evolutionary processes, includ­
ing selective mutant sweeps (in which a clone grows to 
cover very large segments of the colon) and pancolonic 
genomic instability (in which multiple different mutant 
clones arise independently at different location), might 
provide an indicator for CA­CRC development risk.
Optimizing screening intervals
Endoscopic screening intervals (the time between suc­
cessive endoscopies) could potentially be optimized by 
an underlying knowledge of the spatiotemporal dynam­
ics of clonal evolution occurring in IBD. The reason is 
straightforward: if the minimum time it will take for a 
cancer to evolve from the current composition of the 
bowel is known, surveillance can be planned accordingly.

 Our current knowledge of the rates of clone growth 
in the inflamed bowel is minimal. Basic questions, such 
as the duration of time required for a clone to undergo 
expansion substantial enough to be detectable with 
biopsy, and the time required to establish a mutant 
cancerization field, remain unanswered. Moreover, 
the rate and consistency of mutation accumulation 
is unknown. In our opinion, measuring these funda­
mental  
evolutionary parameters could have direct 
clinical relevance.
A practical factor to consider when using IBD sur­
veillance is the fidelity of standard mapping biopsies at 
reflecting true clonal composition of the entire colon. 
Routine colonoscopic biopsies contain ~200 crypts112. 
Owing to the sheer length of the whole colon, even the 
most intensive IBD mapping biopsy protocols sample 
<1% of the colonic mucosal surface113. Thus, endoscopy­ 
based studies might result in considerable clonal popu­
lations being missed, unless clonal patch sizes truly 
are often as large as those detected in some patients 
with IBD25,92. Understanding the clonal mosaicism of 
the bowel could help guide optimal biopsy protocols. 
Moreover, as ulcerative colitis by definition starts in 
the rectum and extends proximally, we speculate that the 
rectum is the site where the most evolution has occurred, 
suggesting that the evolutionary dynamics in the distal

a substantial risk of developing recurrent neoplasia (a consequence of field

utilized as a biomarker of cancer risk.

 colon might have the most relevance for disease aetio­
logy. Indeed, preliminary evidence raises the possibility 
that chromosomal instability of the rectum is a proxy 
marker of CRC risk for the whole large intestine114. 
Nevertheless, this approach might not apply for patients 
with Crohn’s disease and so­called skip­ 
lesions, or for 
patients with primary sclerosing cholan 
gitis and with a 
propensity to develop right­sided colon cancer owing 
to possible aberrant enterohepatic biliary circulation115.
Assessing the evolutionary dynamics of the colon 
would enable us to define the window of opportunity 
for cancer risk prognostication, rationalize colonoscopic 
biopsy protocols (random versus segmental versus endo­
scopic areas of concern) and determine the appropriate 
time intervals between endoscopies (FIG. 2). To ensure 
clinical utility, such a biomarker should aim for maximal 
sensitivity to avoid missing cancer cases.
Managing neoplastic lesions
Managing dysplasia remains the most challenging clin­
ical dilemma in IBD surveillance. Differentiating those 
patients requiring immediate colectomy from those who 
can be safely managed conservatively remains difficult. 
Consensus guidelines based on dysplasia morphology 
and endoscopic resectability aim to standardize clinical 
approaches116. Although the majority of patients with 
low­grade dysplasia will never develop cancer, 25% of 
patients with low­grade dysplasia who are advised to 
undergo colectomy will already have an established 
 
cancer in their surgical specimen11. Even when a  
cancer 
is detected at colonoscopy, it is not uncommon for 
patients to request a segmental resection rather than 
proctocolectomy, to avoid living with a stoma and/or 
ileo 
anal pouch. Such requests go against standard clin­
ical advice; at least one­third of patients undergoing 
colectomy for CA­CRC detected at surveillance will have 
a second  
synchronous neoplastic region11.
Dysplastic lesions offer an ideal opportunity to assess 
the utility of evolutionary biomarkers by localizing the 
site of a mutant cancerization field (FIG. 2). These lesions 
and the surrounding mucosa can then be assessed for 
markers of somatic evolution, such as the local burden of 
genomic alteration (or mutational burden). The sizes 
of clonally expanded patches and the degree of clonal 
diversity might enable identification of high­risk lesions 
that are likely to progress to CRC. This application is 
particularly useful for patients with recurrent, invisible 
or nonresectable low­grade dysplasia, whereas evolu­
tionary markers associated with a high risk of cancer 
development could be used as an indication for colec­
tomy. Furthermore, analysing the remaining mucosa to 
determine the spatial extent of these high­risk changes 
might enable identification of a subset of patients with 
limited cancerization field changes, who could be offered 
a segmental colectomy that preserves anorectal function.
Optimizing treatment to prevent cancer
With inflammation a key driver of CA­CRC risk in clin­
ical and laboratory studies, assessing how therapy modu­
lates occult evolution provides a means to understanding 
how and why drug treatments affect cancer develop­
ment. Aspirin reduces both sporadic CRC incidence117 
and precursor adenoma recurrence118, and evidence from 
Barrett oesophagus shows that NSAID use slows the 
rate of somatic mutation accumulation119, suggesting an 
evolutionary mechanism of cancer prevention. Together, 
these data imply that attenuation of inflammation can 
have profound influence on the carcinogenic process. 
Nevertheless, although drug treatment in patients with 
IBD might modulate clonal evolution of the inflamed 
bowel120, similar studies assessing evolution patterns 
before and after therapy are needed to define and 
rational 
ize the most optimal medical intervention strat­
egy. As a clear majority of patients undergoing  
cancer 
surveillance show some evidence of active inflammation 
on biopsy121, these studies might generate greater clinical 
impetus towards achieving deep remission122 in high­risk 
patients, rather than symptomatic relief alone.
Conclusion
Occult evolution is a feature of IBD­associated carcino­
genesis and begins long before the development 
of clinically detectable neoplasia. Repeated episodes of 
inflammation generate mutant clones and select for 
those cells best adapted to this microenvironment, such 
as clones resistant to apoptosis and those with acceler 
ated 
growth. These selective pressures, unique to IBD, might 
explain the unique characteristics of IBD­associated 
neoplasia in comparison to its sporadic counter 
part. 
Assaying this evolutionary process is an exciting new 
opportunity for developing a new class of biomarkers 
that are robust to the stochastic nature of tumorigenic 
mutations, which has hampered the effective 
ness of 
traditional candidate­gene biomarkers. For clinicians, 
such a marker would not only aid in cancer risk stratifi­
cation, but might even identify those patients requir­
ing surgery for dysplasia and/or cancer who would be 
candidates for segmental resection rather than procto­
colectomy, thereby preserving some colo 
rectal function. 
For cancer biologists, the IBD surveillance protocol is 
an  
underutilised model for  
understanding human 
intestinal biology.
