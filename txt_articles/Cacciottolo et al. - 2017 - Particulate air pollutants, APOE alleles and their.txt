Exposure to particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air and its interactions with APOE alleles may contribute to the acceleration
of brain aging and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neurodegenerative effects of particulate air pollutants were
examined in a US-wide cohort of older women from the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and in experimental
mouse models. Residing in places with fine PM exceeding EPA standards increased the risks for global cognitive decline and
all-cause dementia respectively by 81 and 92%, with stronger adverse effects in APOE ε4/4 carriers. Female EFAD transgenic mice
(5xFAD+/ −/human APOE ε3 or ε4+/+) with 225 h exposure to urban nanosized PM (nPM) over 15 weeks showed increased cerebral
β-amyloid by thioflavin S for fibrillary amyloid and by immunocytochemistry for Aβ deposits, both exacerbated by APOE ε4.
Moreover, nPM exposure increased Aβ oligomers, caused selective atrophy of hippocampal CA1 neurites, and decreased the
glutamate GluR1 subunit. Wildtype C57BL/6 female mice also showed nPM-induced CA1 atrophy and GluR1 decrease. In vitro nPM
exposure of neuroblastoma cells (N2a-APP/swe) increased the pro-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein
(APP). We suggest that airborne PM exposure promotes pathological brain aging in older women, with potentially a greater impact
in ε4 carriers. The underlying mechanisms may involve increased cerebral Aβ production and selective changes in hippocampal
CA1 neurons and glutamate receptor subunits.

INTRODUCTION
Environmental influences on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related
dementias (ADRD) are poorly documented.1 Apolipoprotein E
(APOE) ε4 and other loci identified by large GWAS account for less
than 50% of heritable AD risk.2 Thus, attention is drawn to
environmental risk factors, including common neurotoxins and
their interactions with APOE and other genes.2,3
Ambient fine particles (PM2.5: particulate matter (PM) with
aerodynamic diameterso2.5 μm) from traffic emissions are a
major source of urban air pollution, accounting globally for 25% of
ambient PM2.5.4 Epidemiologic evidence associates cognitive
deficits with PM2.5 exposure among the elderly.5 Rodent models
also show long-term neurotoxic effects of air pollutants, including
memory impairment6 and selective atrophy of CA1 hippocampal
neurons observed in pre-clinical AD;7 decreased glutamate
receptor subunit GluR1;8 and increased endogenous soluble
Aβ.9–11 However, we lack prospective studies of PM exposure on
ADRD risk and interaction with APOE alleles.
We hypothesized that long-term PM2.5 exposure increases the
risk for accelerated global cognitive decline and dementia, further
exacerbated by APOE ε4. These hypotheses were tested within
the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a well-
characterized, nationwide prospective cohort of older US women,
for which we recently reported associations between elevated
PM2.5 and smaller white matter volumes in multiple brain
regions.12 Neurotoxic effects of PM were studied with transgenic
mice (EFAD) carrying human APOE alleles and familial AD
genes13,14 which model pre-clinical accumulations of Aβ amyloid
and its exacerbation in APOE ε4 carriers.13,15,16 We focused on
female mice, because ε4 confers a greater AD risk in women than
in men15 and because women also incur worse cardiopulmonary17
and neurological18 consequences from residential exposure to
ambient PM.17 To model the human subpopulation with low to
negligible Aβ plaque and without familial AD genes, we examined

responses of mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells expressing Swedish
mutant APP (N2a-APP/swe) to in vitro nPM as a model for direct
effects of PM on APP processing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The neuroepidemiologic study
WHIMS participants were community-dwelling (495% in urban areas)
across 48 states, aged 65 to 79 years, and free of dementia when enrolled,
1995–1999. Of 4504 with APOE genotypes, we excluded 717 with ε2/2,
ε2/3 or ε2/4 allele plus 140 with missing PM2.5 data. The remainder of 3647
older women with APOE alleles ε3/3 (n = 2644), ε3/4 (n = 922) or ε4/4
(n = 81), were of European ancestry (primarily non-Hispanic whites) and
had complete PM2.5 exposure estimates. The standardized WHIMS
outcome ascertainment protocols22 consisted of annual screening of
global cognitive function, neuropsychological and functional assessment,
with clinical data to exclude possible reversible causes of cognitive
impairment (Supplementary Material), all concluded with the final
classification of dementia (vs non-demented) by central adjudication blind
to estimated PM2.5 exposure. Accelerated decline in global cognitive
function was defined by an 8-point (~2 s.e.) loss in Modified Mini-Mental
State (3MS)23 during two consecutive assessments. Decrease of 3MS by 5–
10 points was considered a clinically significant decline in global cognitive
functions.24
Using
the
Bayesian
Maximum
Entropy
method
(Supplementary
Information), we constructed spatiotemporal models to estimate the
ambient concentration of PM2.5 at all WHIMS residential locations in 1999–
2010.25 This method integrates nationwide monitoring data from the U.S.
EPA Air Quality System (AQS) and the output of chemical transport models
to characterize spatiotemporal interdependence of environmental data to
estimate mean trends and covariance of the air pollution fields over space
and time. The resulting BME estimates of daily PM2.5 exposures correlated
with levels recorded at local AQS monitoring sites (cross-validation
Pearson’s r2 = 0.70). This statistically-validated BME model was applied to
each geocoded residential location to generate a yearly time-series of
PM2.5 exposure, and then combined with residential histories including
relocations to calculate the 3-year moving average PM2.5 exposures.
Statistical analysis
We conducted time-to-event analyses to examine associations between
long-term residential exposure to PM2.5 and adverse neurocognitive
outcomes. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for adverse events
associated with estimated time-varying 3-year average PM2.5 exposures,
adjusting for potential confounders, including age, geographic region,
education, income, employment status, lifestyle factors (smoking; alcohol
use; physical activities) and clinical characteristics (use of hormone
treatment; depression; body mass index; hypercholesterolemia; hyperten-
sion, diabetes; and histories of cardiovascular disease). Characterization of
these covariates and rationale for their selection were given in the
Supplementary
Information.
Follow-up
time
for
each
woman
was
calculated from WHI randomization (baseline) to the screening date
triggering the ultimate classification of defined outcome end points, or the
last date of completing annual cognitive assessment before 31 December
2010, whichever came first. Data on global cognitive decline and incidence
of dementia were analyzed separately. For analyses of global cognitive
decline, dementia cases were excluded if ascertained before subjects lost 8
points on 3MS. We used time on study as the timescale in the constructed
Cox regression models, because simulation studies suggested that such
approaches were less subject to potential biases in estimating effects of
environmental factors (for example, PM exposures) with prominent secular
trends,26 as compared with the other alternatives (for example, attained
age; calendar time). The assumed proportional hazards of Cox models were
supported by the proportionality test based on weighted residuals.27 To
evaluate the effect measure modification, we further stratified the effect
estimates by examining whether the putative neurotoxic effects differed
by APOE alleles, by Wald tests of interaction. Statistical analyses used SAS
System for Windows, Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Mouse experiments
Animals.
EFAD mice carrying transgenes for human APOE ε3 or ε4 alleles
in combination with five familial AD mutations (5xFAD+/ −/human APOE+/+)
(APP K670N/M671L+ I716V+ V717I and PS1 M146L+L286V)13 were
generously given by Dr Mary Jo LaDu (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL,
USA). Experimental logistics limited the exposure study to 20 female mice:
10 per group of E3- and E4FAD, were randomly assigned to either nPM
exposure or control air for 15 weeks. One E3FAD control died during the
experiment. As a model for the human subpopulation with low to
negligible Aβ plaque and without AD genes, we exposed wild-type C57BL/
6J females (n = 18) to nPM for 10 weeks corresponding to our prior study of
wild-type male mice.8 The 15-week exposure for EFAD was chosen to
initiate exposure at 2 months, corresponding to the onset of Aβ
deposition,13 with brains collected at age of 7 months, the same age in
our initial study.8 Data analysis was blinded for nPM and genotype. Mouse
husbandry and procedures were approved by the University of Southern
California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Experimental
exposures.
A
nano-scale
subfraction
of
urban
PM2.5,
designated as nPM8 with well-characterized particle size and chemical
composition,8,28 was used for in vivo and in vitro exposure. Female mice
were randomly assigned to nPM or filtered air (control), 5 h per day, 3 days
per week, delivered to the sealed exposure chambers. For timelines of
exposures see Supplementary Figure 1.
Tissue collection.
Mice were killed by isoflurane anesthesia and perfused
transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline. Brains were hemi-sected for
sagittal sectioning 0.5–2 mM from midline. Brains were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in sucrose and frozen on dry ice. The
other hemisphere was chilled and dissected (hippocampus and cerebral
cortex) and frozen on dry ice.
Oligomeric Aβ ELISA.
Aβ peptides were assayed in brain supernates.15
Cerebral half-cortexes were homogenized in DEA buffer (0.2% diethyla-
mine, 50 mM NaCl; 1 ml per 200 mg tissue) with Complete Protease Inhibitor
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). After centrifugation (20 800 g × 30 min),
supernatants were neutralized with Tris-HCl, pH 6.2. Oligomeric Aβ
was assayed by MOAB-2 ELISA kit (BEK-2215-1P, Biosensis, Thebarton, SA,
Australia).
Aβ Immunohistochemistry (4G8).
Aβ amyloid was immunostained with
4G8 antibody (residues 17–24 at N-terminal of APP, SIG-39220, Covance,
Princeton, NJ, USA).15 Briefly, sections were immersed in 70% formic acid/
5 min. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked by 3% H2O2 and 10%
methanol in TRIS-buffered saline (TBS), 30 min/22 °C. Sections were
permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/15 min, blocked by 30 min incubation
in TBS with 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton, and probed with primary antibodies.
After 0.1% Triton and TBS rinses, sections were incubated with biotinylated
anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:250) for 1 h, followed by ABC
peroxidase and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector, Burlingame, CA,
USA). Bright-field microscope images were converted to 8-bit grayscale
and thresholded to highlight plaques and to diminish background. The
objects identified were inspected individually to confirm plaque identity.
The cerebral cortex in each image was outlined for analysis by ‘analyze
particles’ function in NIH ImageJ software. Aβ plaque load was evaluated as
% area covered by 4G8-stained plaques.
Thioflavin S staining.
Sections were air-dried, rehydrated in Milli-Qwater
for 2 min and stained in 0.1% thioflavin S (ThioS) (in 50% ethanol-
phosphate-buffered saline) for 5 min in the dark. Sections were destained
twice for 5 min in 80% EtOH in the dark and mounted with Fluoromount
Aqueous (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Amyloid load was quantified
as above for 4G8 immunostaining.
Silver staining.
Silver staining Bielschowsky technique was used to assess
neuropil density.29 Sections were dried at room temperature and briefly
washed in distilled water before preimpregnation. Sections were incubated
in preheated 20% (1.0 M) silver nitrate at 37 °C/15 min, washed 3 × in
distilled water, and incubated in ammoniacal silver solution (20% silver
nitrate in 148 mM ammonia water) for 10 min at 37 °C. Sections were
developed for 3 min (8% formaldehyde, 1% nitric acid, 26 mM citric acid,

 diluted 1:50 in ammonia water), followed by washing in ammonia water
and distilled water to reduce background. Slides were then placed in 5%
sodium thiosulfate solution for 2 min, rinsed 5 ×
in distilled water,
dehydrated, cleared and mounted. Bright-field images of CA1, CA2/3 and
dentate gyrus region, were analyzed by NIH ImageJ software. Images were
converted to 8-bit grayscale, thresholded for binary separation of neuronal
cell bodies (dark round objects) from neurites and neurite density
calculated as percentage of positive staining in area of interest.

anti-NueN (loading control; 1:1000, MAB377, mouse, Millipore). After
washing, membranes were probed with secondary antibodies conjugated
with IRDye 680 (92632210, rabbit, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA)
and IRDye 800 (92632210, mouse, LI-COR). Signal was detected by infrared
imaging (Odyssey, LI-COR).
In vitro nPM exposure and APP/Aß measurements.
Mouse neuroblastoma
N2a cells expressing Swedish mutant APP (K595N/M596L) (N2a-APP/swe)
were generously gifted by Dr Huaxi Xu (Sanford/Burnham Medical
Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA) and tested for mycoplasma
contamination before use. Cells were treated with nPM (10 μg ml − 1) in
culture media (Optimem/DMEM medium, 5% FBS, 500 μg ml − 1 G418) for
24 h. RIPA buffer cell lysates were probed with 22C11 antibody (1:100,
Millipore), which recognizes both sAPPα and sAPPβ. Media were analyzed
for Aβ42 by MSD Multiplex ELISA (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD,
USA). Three independent experiments were performed, with three sample
replicates each.
Statistical analyses.
For the statistical analyses examining the putative
effects on continuous response variables, we used multiple linear
regression analysis in STATA14, including both nPM exposure and APOE
genotype. We also conducted subgroup data analyses on nPM exposure
effect, stratified by genotype. Silver staining analysis used repeated
measurements of a clustered linear regression. All two-sided tests of
statistical significance were set at Po0.05.
RESULTS
The neuroepidemiologic study
Women in the highest PM2.5 quartile (14.34–22.55 μg m − 3) were
older (aged ⩾ 75 years); more likely to reside in the South/Midwest
and use hormonal treatment; but engage less in physical activities
and consume less alcohol, relative to counterparts (all P-
valueso0.05; Supplementary Table S1). PM2.5 exposure estimates
did not differ by APOE genotype. There were 173 subjects
classified as incident cases of all-cause dementia over an average
follow-up of 9.9 years and 329 had global cognitive decline
(including 87 cases subsequently classified as or progressing to all-
cause-dementia) over an average follow-up of 8.3 years. The
observed incidence rates of accelerated global cognitive decline
and all-cause dementia differed significantly by APOE genotype
(both Po0.001 with ε4/44ε3/44ε3/3 by log-rank test).
Associations between PM2.5 exposure and adverse events.
The
3-year average exposure preceding the incident event time was
a priori classified as ‘high’ if exceeding the current National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5 (412 μg m − 3).30
Residence in high PM2.5 locations was associated with increased
risks of global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia. These
adverse PM2.5 effects were exacerbated among women of ε4/4
(Figure 1; Supplementary Table S2). For residence in locations with
high PM2.5 at any time during 1999–2000, the hazard ratio (HR) for
accelerated global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia were
increased by 81% and 92%, respectively (Figure 1). These adverse
PM2.5 effects varied by APOE allele, with ε3/3oε3/4oε4/4 for
both global cognitive decline (ε3/3: HR = 1.65; ε3/4: HR = 1.93; ε4/4:
HR = 3.95) and all-cause dementia (ε3/3: HR = 1.68; ε3/4: HR = 1.91;
ε4/4: HR = 2.95).
Mouse experimental studies
Female EFAD mice (5xFAD+/ −/human APOE ε3/ε3/ or ε4/ε4) were
chronically exposed to nPM during 15 weeks. We observed
increased amyloid deposits as fibrillar amyloid by ThioS binding
and by 4G8 plaque immunohistochemistry that were greater for
E4FAD mice than E3FAD. For ThioS, nPM exposure increased
amyloid load by +60% in E4FAD above non-exposed controls
(P = 0.048), whereas E3FAD did not respond (P = 0.79; Figure 2a).
For 4G8, nPM exposure in E4FAD increased Aβ plaque load by
+30% above controls (P = 0.04; Figure 2b); its effect size was 2.8-
fold greater than for E3FAD (Supplementary Table S3). Levels of
ThioS and 4G8 were highly correlated (r2 = 0.78, Po0.0001;
Supplementary Figure 2).
Aβ oligomers were increased by nPM for both APOE alleles, with
an overall nPM effect (P = 0.0001; Figure 2c): +15% in E4FAD mice
(P = 0.03) and +60% in E3FAD (P = 0.07).
The increased amyloid from nPM exposure suggests direct
effects of nPM on APP processing. As an acute in vitro model,
mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a-APP/Swe) were exposed to nPM;
pro-amyloidogenic APP processing was assessed as the ratio
(sAPPβ/α) of soluble fragments from β-secretase (sAPPβ, pro-
amyloidogenic) and α-secretase (sAPPα, non-amyloidogenic). nPM
increased the sAPPβ/α ratio by 35% (P = 0.02, Figure 2d), with
2-fold increase of Aβ42 peptide (Po0.001, Figure 2e).
Neuronal consequences of the elevated Aβ and sAPPβ/α ratio
include synaptic remodeling20 and effects of Aβ on glutamate
receptors.31 The hippocampus of female EFAD and C57BL/6 mice
showed selective neuronal atrophy in response to nPM, which was
restricted to CA1 hippocampal neurons (Figure 3a-d): E3FAD
(−45%, P = 0.03) and C57BL/6 (−25%, P = 0.003), without CA2/3
layer or dentate gyrus (Figure 3d, Supplementary Table S3).
Synaptic proteins that mediate hippocampal-based memory
were analyzed in whole hippocampus extracts. The nPM exposure
decreased GluR1 protein by − 25% in E3FAD (P = 0.01), − 35%
in E4FAD (P = 0.01) and − 40% in C57BL/6J (Po0.002; Figure 4a).
No changes were detected in other glutamatergic receptor
subunits (GluR2, NR2A and NR2B; Figure 4b–d) or other synaptic
proteins
(pre-synaptic:
synaptophysin;
post-synaptic:
PSD95;
Supplementary Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
Our data combine an air pollution-neuroepidemiologic study of
older women and inhalation neurotoxicological experiments with
mice. Together, we show the contribution of particulate air
pollutants to neurodegenerative changes, with potentially a
greater impact on APOE ε4 carriers. Overall, the evidence supports
the schema that airborne PM accelerates neurodegenerative
processes of ADRD through multiple pathways, including pro-
amyloidogenic APP processing and other pathways independent
of amyloid deposits.
In the geographically diverse WHIMS cohort, increased risks for
both all-cause dementia and clinically significant declines in global
cognitive function (with 48-point loss in 3MS scores) were
associated with residential exposure to high levels of ambient
PM2.5. In female EFAD mice, the chronic exposure to nPM, a
neurotoxic subfraction of PM2.5, increased both the cerebral
Aβ-amyloid plaque load and neurotoxic Aβ oligomers. Mice

 carrying ε4 had more nPM-induced Aβ-amyloid plaque. These
experimental data are consistent with our epidemiologic observa-
tion of stronger associations between PM2.5 exposure and
increased risks for dementia and global cognitive decline in
women homozygous for APOE ε4 vs ε3. These findings provide
the first experimental evidence for gene-environment interactions
involving airborne PM and APOE in neurodegenerative processes.
Our study of the WHIMS cohort provides new evidence for late-
life exposure to PM2.5 as a common environmental risk factor for
ADRD. Previous studies showed older adults living in areas with
higher ambient PM2.5 had lower performance in various cognitive
functions32,33 and accelerated cognitive aging.34,35 However,
unlike our defined global decline (48-point loss in 3MS), the
clinical significance was unclear for these reported cognitive
deficits associated with air pollution exposure. Five studies that
reported associations of ADRD with exposure to ambient air
pollution36–40 had notable methodological limitations. Three of
these studies39–41 used claims data to determine incident
dementia/AD (an approach with questionable validity42) and
included only aggregated exposures prone to ecological biases.
Four studies36,39–41 were retrospective and subject to selection
biases.43 The only prospective cohort study37 employed a spatial
model towards the end of study follow-up to estimate the NOx
exposure in earlier years, which obscured the temporality of the
reported association. Our study within the prospective WHIMS
cohort used the incident dementia cases adjudicated with well-
validated protocols and a sophisticated spatiotemporal model to
estimate residence-specific exposure to ambient PM2.5 preceding
the ascertained end points. The comprehensive list of covariates
data (including APOE genotype) allowed us to carefully assess and
adjust for potential confounding. These observed neurodegen-
erative effects of PM2.5 (with the relative risk for global cognitive
decline and all-cause dementia, respectively, increased by 81%
and 92%) were not explained by differences in socioeconomic
status, lifestyle, vascular risk factors and APOE alleles. The average
PM2.5 concentrations have decreased over time in the US (for
example, 34% reduction in 2000–2013), which coincided with
decreased age-specific risk for dementia.44 Assuming 30% of older
women in the US were residing in locations with high PM2.5 before
the US EPA set its current US NAAQS standard ambient PM2.5 in
2012, if the observed adverse effects in WHIMS were general-
izable, we estimate that ~ 21% of accelerated cognitive decline
and all-cause dementia are attributable to residential exposure to
high ambient PM2.5.45
The experimental findings with EFAD and C57BL/6J mice
suggest possible mechanisms for the PM-associated cognitive
impairment observed in the WHIMS cohort. We show that nPM
exposure of EFAD mice increased fibrillary amyloid and Aβ plaque
and soluble oligomeric Aβ, together with neuronal changes in
hippocampus (discussed below). These are the first studies on the
neurotoxicity of airborne particles using transgenic mice carrying
human APOE alleles and familial AD genes. Three reports of wild-

Adverse effects of PM2.5 exposure on cognitive impairment in older women, stratified by APOE alleles. Horizontal bars represent the
effect measures (hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals) estimated from the Cox proportional hazard models, comparing high
(exceeding the US National Ambient Air Quality Standard with 3-year averages PM2.5412 μg m − 3) versus low exposure for their associated
incidence rates of global cognitive decline (a) and all-cause dementia (b), stratified by APOE alleles (ε3/3 vs ε3/4 vs ε4/4). The dotted vertical
lines denote no statistically significant adverse effects (with HR = 1). The presented crude estimates were adjusted for APOE alleles. The
adjusted estimates further accounted for age, geographic region, spatial random effect, years of education, household income, employment
status, lifestyle factors (smoking; alcohol use; physical activities) and clinical characteristics (use of hormone treatment; depression; body mass
index; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension, diabetes; and histories of cardiovascular disease). At any time during 1999–2010, if older women
were residing at locations with high PM2.5, their hazards for accelerated global cognitive decline and all-cause dementia respectively would be
81% (HR = 1.81; 1.42–2.32) and 92% (HR = 1.92; 1.32–2.80) greater than if they had low exposure. This increase in hazard for all-cause dementia
associated with high PM2.5 exposure was 68% (HR = 1.68; 0.97–2.92), 91% (HR = 1.91; 1.17–3.14), and 295% (HR = 3.95; 1.18–13.19), respectively,
in ε3/3, ε3/4, and ε4/4 carriers. High PM2.5 exposure also increase the hazard for global cognitive decline by 65% (HR = 1.65; 1.23–2.23), 93%
(HR = 1.93; 1.29–2.90), and 264% (HR = 3.64; 1.36–9.69) in women of ε3/3, ε3/4, and ε4/4 alleles.

term exposure of neuronal N2a-APP/Swe cells enhanced pro-
amyloidogenic APP processing, with increased sAPPβ/α ratio and
Aβ42 production. This finding concurs with the rapid rise of brain
Aβ40–42 in wild-type mice exposed to nickel-PM enriched
ambient air.46 In EFAD mice, Aβ plaques begin to form in cerebral
cortex by 2 months,13 which models the pre-clinical accumulation
of Aβ plaque in humans. We showed that nPM exposure increased
both plaque formation and neurotoxic Aβ oligomers in cerebral
cortex at 7 months (approximately equivalent to 35 years of
human age, approaching peri-menopause). This implies that Aβ-
dependent
neurodegenerative
processes
in
women
with
increased long-term PM exposure may precede cognitive declines
or diagnosis of dementia, which is consistent with neuroimaging
evidence for Aβ deposition even among cognitively intact
individuals in their 50–60s.47
Importantly, nPM-exposed EFAD mice showed selective neuritic
changes that parallel human AD, with selective atrophy of
hippocampal CA1 neurons, but not of neighboring neurons of
the same memory circuit.7 The nPM exposure also decreased the
GluR1 subunit of glutamatergic synapses for both APOE alleles.
Female wild-type C57BL/6 mice also showed selective CA1
atrophy with decreased GluR1, extending our prior findings of
GluR1 with male C57BL/6J mice.8 Together, these results suggest
that the nPM-associated early neurodegenerative changes in
hippocampus may occur to a broader population regardless of
underlying genetic risks.
The CA1 neurite atrophy in female C57BL/6J mice after 10 weeks
of nPM exposure corroborates dendritic spine loss in CA1 neurons
of male C57BL/6 mice exposed to concentrated ambient PM2.5 for
10 months shown by others.6 Thus, the selective vulnerability of
CA1 neurons to airborne PM does not depend on the presence of
human Aβ. As noted in the Introduction, wild-type murine sAPPα,
derived from the endogenous mouse APP, modulates synaptic
remodeling.20,21 The selective CA1 attrition by PM exposure
without Aβ accumulation implies that PM exposure before older
ages could contribute to accelerated cognitive decline and
increased AD risk in late life by reducing the CA1 synapses,
possibly via direct interactions of Aβ oligomers with glutamatergic
neurons.31 Moreover, the nPM-driven increase of sAPPβ/α implies
deficits of the neurotrophic sAPPα, which can rescue deficits of
synaptic plasticity (LTP) in CA1 neurons of APP-knockout mice.20,21
Given the growing literature linking air pollution with cognitive
deficits across the life course, the selective neurotoxic effects on
CA1 neurons underscores the possibility that PM exposure may
differentially damage the medial temporal lobe-hippocampus
memory
system,48

 airborne PM-induced pathological brain aging may be initiated by
white
matter
neurodegeneration,
with
ensuing
neuro-
anatomical progression of AD from the entorhinal cortex in the
medial temporal lobe to the hippocampus via the myelinated
perforant path.53,54
Our epidemiologic and experimental findings suggest that
APOE ε4 may increase susceptibility to the adverse effects of
particulate air pollutants. We followed an expert-proposed frame-
work combining epidemiologic and toxicological evidence to
make causal inference,55 focusing on the comparison of PM effect
sizes,
rather
than
the
interaction
P-value,
which
can
be
misleading.56 The adverse effects of high ambient PM2.5 on global
cognitive decline and dementia risk were several fold greater in
APOE ε4/4 than ε3/3 carriers. Because APOE4 frequencies vary
widely by populations,57 their potential interactions with spatially
varying ambient PM exposure to accelerate pathological brain
aging may explain the geographic disparities in dementia
incidence.58 Possible interactions of air pollution exposure and
APOE ε4 on accelerated brain aging are also suggested by
postmortem findings from a study in Mexico,59 which lacked
comparison with APOE ε4 carriers residing in cleaner air.
Neurocognitive effects of airborne particles interacting with APOE
alleles were also reported for a cross-sectional study in older
German women for their joint effect on constructional praxis.60
Interpretation is difficult because overall there were no associa-
tions across all tested domains (including episodic memory and
executive function) and no adjustment for multiple comparisons.
A recent case–control study in Taiwan reported an increased risk
for AD associated with high ambient PM10, with the observed
association not varying by APOE genes.36 This study was limited
for its retrospective design prone to selection biases (for example,
possible oversampling of ε4 carriers in controls).
We recognize several limitations of our study. First, this study of
older women may not be generalized to men. Second, our study
examined the association with PM2.5 mass, but had no information
on particle constituents, emission sources, or interactions with
other pollutants. Although research on cardiopulmonary end
points is beginning to include these complexities of PM exposures,
such data are both costly and limited for nationwide cohorts.
Third,
the
employed
spatiotemporal
models
only
allowed
estimates of late-life exposure to PM2.5 after 1999. As air pollution
levels have been declining over the past 20 years, long-term
exposure, especially during mid- or earlier life, may impart a
greater risk. Finally, male mice warrant study for nPM effects on
amyloid processing.
In summary, we provide clear evidence that the hazards of
particulate air pollutants for brain health extend to dementia risk in
a US-wide sample of older women and give, we believe, the first
evidence from AD transgenic mice that exposure to urban airborne
particulates can intensify amyloid accumulation and neurodegen-
eration. Moreover, these joint data from humans and mice provide
the first evidence that neurodegenerative effects of airborne PM
may involve gene-environment interactions with APOE ε4, the
major genetic risk factor for pathological brain aging and AD. The
association between PM2.5 exposure and increased dementia risk
suggests that the global burden of disease attributable to PM2.5
pollution has been underestimated, especially in regions with large
populations exposed to high ambient PM2.5.
