Summary
Background Global rollout of dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been hampered in part by insufficient 
safety data in pregnancy. We compared birth outcomes among women initiating dolutegravir-based ART with those 
among women initiating efavirenz-based ART in pregnancy in Botswana.
Methods In this observational study, we captured birth outcome data at eight government hospitals throughout Botswana 
(~45% of all deliveries in the country) in an ongoing study that started on Aug 15, 2014. In 2016, Botswana changed first-
line ART from efavirenz-tenofovir-emtricitabine to dolutegravir-tenofovir-emtricitabine, including for pregnant women. 
This analysis includes women starting either efavirenz-based ART or dolutegravir-based ART during singleton pregnancy 
(regimen started and delivery occurring between Aug 15, 2014, and Aug 15, 2016, for efavirenz-based ART and between 
Nov 1, 2016, and Sept 30, 2017, for dolutegravir-based ART). We excluded births to mothers who had switched regimen or 
stopped ART. The primary outcomes were the combined endpoints of any adverse outcome (stillbirth, preterm birth 
[<37 weeks’ gestation], small for gestational age [SGA; less than the tenth percentile of birthweight by gestational age], or 
neonatal death [within 28 days of age]) and severe adverse outcomes (stillbirth, neonatal death, very preterm birth 
[<32 weeks’ gestation], and very SGA [less than the third percentile of birthweight by gestational age]). We fitted log-
binomial regression models, controlling for maternal age, gravidity, and education, to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs). 
Findings Our analysis included 1729 pregnant women who initiated dolutegravir-based ART and 4593 who initiated 
efavirenz-based ART. The risk for any adverse birth outcome among women on dolutegravir versus efavirenz was 
similar (33·2% vs 35·0%; aRR 0·95, 95% CI 0·88–1·03), as was the risk of any severe birth outcome (10·7% vs 11·3%; 
0·94, 0·81–1·11). We found no significant differences by regimen in the individual outcomes of stillbirth, neonatal 
death, preterm birth, very preterm birth, SGA, or very SGA. 
Interpretation Adverse birth outcomes were similar among pregnant women who initiated dolutegravir-based and 
efavirenz-based ART. Dolutegravir-based ART can be safely initiated in pregnancy.

Introduction
Integrase strand inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) with dolutegravir has become a preferred regimen 
for first-line HIV treatment because of its efficacy, 
tolerability, limited drug–drug interactions, and a high 
barrier to resistance.1,2 Use of dolutegravir in low-income 
and middle-income countries is likely to be cost-
effective,3,4 particularly once low-cost generic dolutegravir 
becomes widely available. How 
ever, in part because of 
insufficient data on the safety of dolutegravir in 
pregnancy, WHO has refrained from recommending 
dolutegravir-based treatment as the pre 
ferred first-line 
ART regimen for use in national treatment programmes 
in countries where harmonisation of ART regimens for 
all adults (inc 
luding pregnant women) is important.5
To our knowledge, no previously published studies 
have evaluated the safety of dolutegravir in pregnancy. 
Outcomes from a total of 112 pregnancies exposed to 
dolutegravir have been reported in the literature,5 which is 
an insufficient number to evaluate risks of adverse birth 
outcomes (the antiretroviral pregnancy registry requires 
200 pregnancies before reporting).6 Additionally, more 
than half of these pregnancies (67 [60%]) come from post-
marketing surveillance in which there is no comparator 
group.5 By contrast, there is now sufficient data 
showing that the WHO first-line recommended regimen 
efavirenz-tenofovir-emtricitabine is safer in pregnancy 
than are older ART regimens containing nevirapine, 
lopinavir-ritonavir, and zidovudine-lamivudine.7,8 There-
fore, to justify a transition to dolutegravir-based ART, 
dolutegravir needs to be shown to be at least as safe as 
efavirenz-based ART in pregnancy.
Botswana was the first country to recommend use 
of dolutegravir in pregnancy, and offers a unique

opportunity to study the safety of in-utero exposure to 
dolutegravir. In June, 2016, there was a swift rollout of 
new guidelines by the Botswana national HIV treatment 
programme, recommending initiation of dolutegravir-
tenofovir-emtricitabine instead of efavirenz-tenofovir-
emtricitabine for all adults with HIV, including pregnant 
women.9 We have been conducting a large birth 
outcomes surveillance study at eight sites in Botswana 
since August, 2014, and have been able to take advantage 
of this unique landscape to compare birth outcomes 
among women initiating dolutegravir versus efavirenz 
with the same nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NRTI) backbone.
Methods
Study design and participants
Methods from the Tsepamo study have been previously 
described.8 In summary, data were abstracted from 
obstetric records of all women who delivered liveborn or 
stillborn infants at 24 weeks’ gestational age or later 
at eight government maternity wards in Botswana, 
representing approximately 45% of all births in the 
country.10 Two sites were tertiary referral centres and the 
remainder were primary and district hospitals.
From January, 2012, up to May, 2016, Botswana national 
HIV treatment guidelines recommended efavirenz-based 
ART (efavirenz-tenofovir-emtricitabine) for adults with 
CD4 cell count of 350 cells per mL or lower, and for all 
pregnant women regardless of CD4 count.11 In May, 2016, 
guidelines were updated and recommended dolutegravir-
based ART (dolutegravir-tenofovir-emtricitabine) for all 
adults with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell count or 
pregnancy status.9 All HIV services, including testing, 
treatment, laboratory monitoring, and clinical care, are 
provided free of charge to Botswana citizens.
In this analysis, we included singleton births to women 
who started dolutegravir-based ART at any time during 
pregnancy and gave birth between Nov 1, 2016, and 
Sept 30, 2017, and to women who started efavirenz-
based ART during pregnancy and gave birth between 
Aug 15, 2014, and Aug 15, 2016. Although dolutegravir-
based ART was rolled out in May, 2016, births to women 
on this regimen before November, 2016, were not 
comparable to births on efavirenz-based ART because 
births shortly after the rollout included a high proportion 
of women who had started dolutegravir late in pregnancy 
(often associated with late presentation for antenatal care 
and worse birth outcomes) and women who had a 
preterm or very preterm birth. Inclusion of data from 
this period could have led to an artificially high rate of 
adverse birth outcomes among the dolutegravir group. 
Therefore, births to mothers who had switched or 
stopped ART were excluded from analyses.
Ethical approval for this study was granted by the 
Human Research and Development Council in Botswana 
and by the Office of Human Research Administration at 
Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.
Data collection
Data were abstracted from the maternity obstetric cards 
(medical record throughout pregnancy) at the postnatal 
ward at each site. Information included maternal 
demographics, maternal medical history, self-reported 
alcohol and tobacco use, laboratory values measured 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Dolutegravir-based antiretroviral treatment (ART) is a preferred 
first-line ART regimen for adults with HIV because of its efficacy, 
tolerability, high barrier to resistance, and minimal drug–drug 
interactions. However, outcomes of only a small number of 
exposures in pregnancy have been published to date, which 
precludes evaluation of whether the use of dolutegravir in 
pregnancy might lead to increases in preterm birth, small for 
gestational age, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
abnormalities. Therefore, dolutegravir is not included as a 
first-line recommended regimen in pregnancy by WHO or by 
HIV guideline committees in the USA or Europe. Unavailability 
of pregnancy safety data has also hampered use of dolutegravir 
for all adults in low-income and middle-income countries 
where women of reproductive age make up a large proportion 
of the HIV-positive population.
Added value of this study
In 2016, Botswana became the first country to change its 
national ART guidelines to recommend the start of 
dolutegravir-tenofovir-emtricitabine in pregnancy, rather 
than the current WHO-recommended regimen of 
efavirenz-tenofovir-emtricitabine. Our study compared 
adverse birth outcomes before and after this change in 
guidelines, among 1729 women who initiated 
dolutegravir-based ART and 4593 women who initiated 
efavirenz-based ART. We found no increased risk for adverse 
birth outcomes, including severe adverse birth outcomes, 
among women initiating dolutegravir-based ART in 
pregnancy. These findings support updates to current HIV 
treatment guidelines to allow initiation of dolutegravir-based 
ART as a first-line regimen in pregnancy.
Implications of all the available evidence
The results of this study should decrease the barriers to use of 
dolutegravir in women of reproductive age around the world 
once further data are gathered regarding the safety of 
dolutegravir from conception. These findings are particularly 
important for low-income and middle-income countries where 
harmonisation of first-line ART for adults and pregnant women 
is a key factor in the success of HIV treatment strategies.

in pregnancy (haemoglobin and rapid plasma reagin), 
maternal diagnoses and medications prescribed during 
pregnancy, and birth information for the infant. HIV 
blood test results in pregnancy were collected for all 
women, and for women with HIV, further information 
was gathered on the timing of HIV diagnosis, most 
recent CD4 cell count, and history of antiretroviral use 
(including start date, regimen, and any switch or 
discontinuation during pregnancy).
As in our prior analyses,8 we used the estimated 
gestational age documented by nurses at the time of 
delivery for our analysis. This was typically calculated 
during antenatal care on the basis of the last menstrual 
period documented at first antenatal care visit, and 
was confirmed by ultrasound when available. If the 
last menstrual period was unknown or suspected to 
be incorrect, and if no ultrasound was available, fundal 
height measurements were occasionally used by midwives 
to estimate gestational age.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were the combined endpoints of 
any adverse outcome and any severe adverse outcome. 
The former comprised stillbirth, preterm birth, small for 
gestational age (SGA), or neonatal death, and the latter 
comprised stillbirth, very preterm birth, very SGA, or 
neonatal death. Secondary endpoints were the individual 
outcomes for stillbirth, preterm birth, very preterm 
birth, SGA, very SGA, and neonatal death. Stillbirth was 
defined as fetal death (summed Apgar score of 0). 
Preterm birth was a birth at less than 37 weeks’ gestation 
and very preterm was a birth at less than 32 weeks’ 
gestation. An infant was considered SGA if less than the 
tenth percentile and very SGA if less than the third 
percentile of birthweight by gestational age using 
Intergrowth-21 norms (defined from 24 to 42 weeks’ 
gestation).12,13 Neonatal deaths comprised deaths within 
28 days of age among infants who had never left the 
hospital. Congenital abnormalities were a further 
secondary 
outcome, 
and 
were 
detected 
by 
the nurse midwife during the neonatal surface 
examination and photographed if maternal consent was 
obtained. Photographs were then evaluated and 
classified by a specialist in Boston (LBH) who was 
blinded to HIV and ART status. Congenital abnormalities 
were considered major if they had clinical, surgical, or 
cosmetic significance. Positional and genetic deformities 
were excluded.
Statistical analysis
Birth outcomes were analysed for women with singleton 
pregnancy by ART regimen and among HIV-negative 
women. We used the exact method to estimate 95% CIs 
around the prevalence of each outcome. To compare the 
risk of each primary and secondary birth outcome 
between the two treatment groups, we calculated the 
unadjusted and adjusted risk difference for each outcome 
using additive binomial regression and calculated the 
unadjusted and adjusted risk ratio (aRR) using a log-
binomial regression model. We chose covariates for 
adjusted analyses a priori based on our previous 
analyses8,9 and included maternal age (<18 years, 
18–35 years, or >35 years), gravidity (1, 2–5, or >5), and 
low education (none or primary vs secondary or higher). 
The sample size needed for analyses was based on an 
ability to have 80% power to detect a relative risk of 1·3 
for any severe birth outcomes (and therefore more power 
to detect this risk ratio among the most common 
outcomes of any adverse birth outcome, namely preterm 
birth and SGA). In a secondary analysis, we used the 
same methodology but a separate model to evaluate the 
risk of the primary outcomes among HIV-negative 
women compared with women with HIV who had 
initiated either dolutegravir-based ART or efavirenz-
based ART. In a further secondary analysis, to assess for 
potential temporal changes in birth outcomes, we also 
included HIV-negative women who delivered during the 
two ART exposure periods (August, 2014–August, 2016,

Results
Between Aug 15, 2014, and Aug 15, 2016, 11 708 women 
with HIV delivered singletons, of whom 4593 (39%) began 
efavirenz-based ART after conception. Between Nov 1, 2016, 
and Sept 30, 2017, 5418 women with HIV delivered 
singletons, of whom 1729 (32%) began dolutegravir-based 
ART after conception. 51 167 HIV-negative women had 
singleton delivery during these two time periods.
Age, parity, socioeconomic indicators, timing of 
initiation of antenatal care, and site of delivery were 
similar among women on dolutegravir-based ART and 
efavirenz-based ART (table 1). HIV-negative women were 
more likely to be younger, primiparous, and have higher 
educational attainment than women infected with HIV. 
HIV-positive and HIV-negative women had similar 
timing of initiation of antenatal care.
The time from first presentation at antenatal care to 
initiation of ART was shorter among those on dolutegravir 
compared with efavirenz, resulting in a slightly earlier 
median gestational age at ART initiation for women 
starting dolutegravir-based ART compared with women 
starting efavirenz-based ART (table 2). Median CD4 count 
was similar among women who started dolutegravir-
based ART and efavirenz-based ART, although a greater 
proportion of women in the efavirenz group had a 
CD4 count test during pregnancy (2054 [44·7%] vs 
247 [14·2%]; table 2).
Overall, 2180 (34·5%) of all births to women infected 
with HIV included in this analysis resulted in any adverse 
birth outcome and 704 (11·1%) in a serious adverse birth 
outcome. The occurrence of any adverse birth outcome 
was similar among women initiating dolutegravir-based 
ART (574 women [33·2%, 95% CI 31·0–35·5]) and 
women initiating efavirenz-based ART (1606 women 
[35·0%, 95% CI 33·6–36·4]; table 3). The occurrence of 
any severe adverse birth outcome was also similar among 
women initiating dolutegravir-based ART (185 women 
[10·7%, 9·3–12·3]) and women initiating efavirenz-based 
ART (519 women [11·3%, 10·4–12·3]; table 3).
We observed no difference in preterm birth, very 
preterm birth, SGA, very SGA, stillbirth, or neonatal 
death among women initiating dolutegravir-based ART 
compared with those initiating efavirenz-based ART 
(table 4). In adjusted analyses, we found no increased 
risk of preterm birth, very preterm birth, SGA, very SGA, 
stillbirth, or neonatal death (table 3). Sensitivity analyses 
that excluded participants who had started ART from 
0–4 weeks’ gestation and that limited the analysis to 
women who started ART after their first antenatal care 
visit did not change the results of the analysis (appendix).
Among 675 women with first-trimester exposure to 
ART (280 to dolutegravir-based ART and 395 to 
efavirenz-based ART), one major congenital abnormality 
occurred: skeletal dysplasia in an efavirenz-exposed 
infant. Additionally, there were six cases of postaxial 
polydactyly type B (two in infants exposed to dolutegravir 
and four in infants exposed to efavirenz), which were

not considered major abnormalities because all cases 
were managed by tying off the extra digits after birth.
Among HIV-negative women, 14 766 (28·9%) had any 
adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth in 
7884 (15·6%) of 50 683 women, SGA in 7419 (14·8%) of 
50 172 women, stillbirth in 1061 (2·1%) of 51 164 women, 
and neonatal death in 697 (1·4%) of 50 055 women with 
livebirths (appendix). Severe adverse birth outcomes 
occurred in 5085 (9·9%) women, including very preterm 
births in 1807 (3·6%) of 50 683 women and very SGA 
infants in 2708 (5·4%) of 50 172 women. Birth outcomes 
did not differ by time period among HIV-negative women 
(appendix).
In adjusted analyses, compared with HIV-negative 
women, women with HIV on either dolutegravir-based 
or efavirenz-based ART had significantly higher risk 
of any adverse birth outcomes (aRR 1·23, 95% CI 
1·18–1·28) and any severe adverse birth outcomes 
(1·16, 1·07–1·25). These women also had higher risk of 
preterm birth (1·18, 1·12–1·25), SGA (1·30, 1·23–1·38), 
and very SGA (1·28, 1·16–1·42). We found no difference 
in very preterm birth (1·01, 0·88–1·16), stillbirth (1·08, 
0·91–1·29), or neonatal death (0·92, 0·73–1·17; 
appendix).
Discussion
The 2016 rollout of dolutegravir-tenofovir-emtricitabine 
in Botswana allowed us to do what, to our knowledge, is 
the first large study of the safety of dolutegravir-based 
ART in pregnancy. We found no difference in the risk 
of adverse birth outcomes among women initiating 
dolutegravir-based ART compared with women initiating 
efavirenz-based ART in pregnancy. Compared with HIV-
negative women, both groups of women with HIV had a 
mildly increased risk for adverse birth outcomes and 
severe adverse birth outcomes.
We have previously shown that women on efavirenz-
tenofovir-emtricitabine had fewer adverse birth out 
comes 
than 
did 
those 
on 
older 
ART 
regimens 
con-
taining nevirapine, lopinivir-ritonavir, or zidovudine plus 
lamivudine backbone.7 The finding that dolutegravir-
based ART has a similar risk profile to efavirenz-based 
ART is highly reassuring, and two small studies14,15 of 
pregnant women on integrase inhibitors in Europe 
support these results. The first study14 found similar rates 
of preterm and SGA among 81 European women on 
dolutegravir in pregnancy compared with the general 
population in the UK. The second study15 found similar 
rates of preterm and stillbirth among 479 pregnant 
women in France on raltegravir compared with the 
general French population. Although we cannot exclude 
a small difference in relative risk between these 
two regimens—the 95% CIs in our study are 0·88–1·03 
for any adverse outcome and 0·81–1·11 for any severe 
adverse outcome, thus non-significant—these absolute 
differences would be very small and unlikely to have 
clinical significance that would outweigh the decision to 
use the preferred ART regimen for maternal health. We 
also found no difference in relative risk for all individual 
birth outcomes, providing reassurance that dolutegravir 
is likely to be safe when started in pregnancy. Our 
findings similarly provide further reassurance about the 
safety of efavirenz in pregnancy, which is widely used 
throughout the world.
Because we evaluated dolutegravir started in pregnancy, 
we were unable to adequately evaluate whether the risk of 
major congenital abnormalities differs by regimen 
because we only had information about surface 
abnormalities for a small number of exposures from the 
first trimester. We report a substantially lower rate of total 
congenital abnormalities than do the antiretroviral 
pregnancy registry6 and IMPAACT P1026s16 and EPIIC/
PANNA 
data17—two 
pharmacokinetic 
studies 
of 
antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy. One reason for this is 
that we report only major con 
genital abnormalities of 
medical, surgical, or cosmetic importance, excluding

minor abnormalities, positional abnormalities, and 
genetic abnormalities. The other reason is that we 
ascertain abnormalities that are visible on the neonatal 
surface examination and therefore do not evaluate for 
internal defects such cardiac or renal, or defects that are 
more likely to present after the first few days of life. We do 
not believe the reason for the low rate of abnormalities is 
lack of ascertainment, because we did active surveillance 
on all infants and documented a 1·2% prevalence of 
postaxial polydactyly type B—a minor abnormality found 
in first-trimester exposure to dolutegravir or efavirenz—
that is consistent with the reported prevalence of this 
abnormality in African American infants18 and also 
similar to the prevalence among HIV-negative women in 
our birth outcomes study (data not shown). Further 
research is needed among a larger number of women on 
dolutegravir from conception, with longitudinal infant 
follow-up, to fully evaluate congenital abnormalities.
Our results show that women with HIV on either 
efavirenz-based or dolutegravir-based regimens had a 
small but significant increase in adverse birth outcomes 
compared with HIV-negative women. This risk was 
smaller than in prior studies done when most women 
with HIV received nevirapine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and 
zidovudine-lamivudine.19 However, even small differences 
can translate into a large number of adverse birth 
outcomes in a high-prevalence HIV setting, and can 
adversely affect child health and survival. The reasons for 
the difference in outcomes by maternal HIV status 
remain unknown. The difference might be due to chronic 
HIV infection, comorbidities or coinfections,20,21 or a 
direct effect from ART.
Our study has several strengths, including a sample 
size large enough to evaluate severe birth outcomes, 
and the same NRTI backbone (tenofovir-emtricitabine) 
for both regimens, which enabled us to truly compare 
the effects of dolutegravir and efavirenz. However, our 
study also had several limitations, including an inability 
to fully evaluate CD4 cell count because of the low 
proportion of women on dolutegravir who had a 
reported CD4 count in pregnancy (14·3%), probably due 
to the new strategy of test and treat, which does not 
require a CD4 count for initiation of ART. The data we 
do have available suggest this is not a major confounder. 
The sequential switch from efavirenz to dolutegravir 
puts our data at risk of historical bias. However, the total 
interval was short (3 years) and there was no change in 
birth outcomes among HIV-negative women by calendar 
year (appendix). Given the observational study design, 
unmeasured confounding could bias our results. 
Although we can be reassured because baseline 
covariates were well balanced between the two groups, 
we controlled for potential confounders identified in 
prior similar studies in Botswana and sensitivity 
analyses with additional baseline covariates did not 
change our results (appendix). Ad 
ditionally, we could 
not compare other outcomes such as early pregnancy 
loss (<24 weeks’ gestation); maternal viral load at the 
time of delivery; efficacy in prevention of mother-to-
child HIV transmission; adherence, tolerability, and 
toxicity in pregnancy; or paediatric outcomes after birth. 
Finally, we are unable to assess the quality of data in the 
medical records or validate gestational age dating, 
although we feel neither should differ by ART regimen.
In conclusion, adverse birth outcomes were similar for 
dolutegravir-based ART and efavirenz-based ART when 
started during pregnancy. Although further studies are 
needed to determine the safety of dolutegravir exposure 
from conception and to confirm its efficacy for prevention 
of mother-to-child HIV transmission, these results 
should pave the way for wider use of dolutegravir in 
pregnancy throughout the world.
