Abstract
Married people tend to be healthier than both the previously (bereaved, divorced, and separated) 
and never married, but the mechanisms through which this occurs remain unclear. To this end, 
research has increasingly focused on how psychological stress experienced by unmarried versus 
married individuals may differentially impact physiological systems related to health. One key 
system that is modulated by stress is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, of which 
cortisol is a key hormonal product. Increased cortisol production and disruption of cortisol’s daily 
rhythm have been linked to poorer health outcomes. This study examined the association between 
current marital status and these two indices of cortisol in a community sample of 572 healthy men 
and women aged 21–55. It also tested whether marriage buffers against the effect of stress 
(perceived stress by marital status interaction) on cortisol production. Participants provided 
salivary cortisol samples during waking hours on three nonconsecutive separate days to calculate 
diurnal cortisol levels and slopes. Married individuals had lower cortisol levels than either their 
never married or previously married counterparts. Differences in cortisol levels were due at least in 
part to currently married individuals having a more rapid decline in cortisol through the afternoon 
hours compared to individuals who were never married (but not those who were previously 
married). Furthermore, there was an interaction between perceived stress and marital status in 
predicting cortisol levels. Specifically, higher stress was associated with higher cortisol levels for 
previously married individuals but not for the married or never married. The results of this study 
support cortisol as one candidate mechanism accounting for the association of marital status and 
health.

 1. Introduction
Married people tend to be healthier than unmarried people (Burman & Margolin, 1992; 
Kiecolt-Glaser & Newton, 2001). Indeed, compared to those who are married, numerous 
studies document higher rates of morbidity and mortality among previously (divorced, 
separated, widowed; e.g., Matthews & Gump, 2002; Carey et al., 2014; Dahl et al., 2015) 
and never married individuals (e.g., Johnson et al., 2000; Murray, 2000; Idler et al., 2012). 
Previously married individuals experience increased social isolation (Stafford et al., 2013), a 
loss of social support (Cohen & Wills, 1985), and stigma related to their separation (Gerstel, 
1987). Individuals who are never married also experience stigma and discrimination based 
on their non-normative marital status (Byrne & Carr, 2005; DePaulo & Morris, 2005; Morris 
et al., 2007). Recent interpretations of this literature suggest that the health benefits of 
marriage are partly or wholly attributable to better health in the happily married (e.g., Robles 
et al., 2014). However, there are reasons that married people might be healthier irrespective 
of the quality of their relationships such as their access to health insurance, contact with a 
broader social network, and more regular routines. Either way, this literature suggests that 
unmarried individuals are subject to experiencing multiple sources of stress that might put 
them at risk for disease and death.
How might the stress associated with previous marital dissolution or being unmarried impact 
health? To address this question, it is necessary to consider how stressful experiences may 
disturb physiological systems (Cohen et al., 2016). One system that is often implicated in 
models linking stress and disease is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. 
The HPA axis produces the hormone cortisol, which plays an important regulatory role for 
numerous immunological and metabolic processes related to health (Sapolsky et al., 2000). 
Cortisol levels follow a diurnal pattern, consisting of a rapid rise immediately after waking 
followed by a decline throughout the afternoon and evening. This rhythm is referred to as 
the diurnal cortisol slope, and steeper negative cortisol slopes across the day are generally 
associated with better health outcomes (Adam & Kumari, 2009). Meta-analytic evidence 
suggests that interpersonal stressors, including experiences of shame or loss, are potent 
triggers of increased cortisol levels as well as flatter diurnal cortisol slopes (Dickerson & 
Kemeny, 2004; Miller et al., 2007). In turn, heightened cortisol levels and flatter cortisol 
slopes are associated with adverse health outcomes such as metabolic syndrome (e.g., 
Brunner et al., 2002; Anagnostis et al., 2009), coronary atherosclerosis (e.g., Matthews et al., 
2006; Dekker et al., 2008), and hastened cancer mortality (e.g., Sephton et al., 2000). As 
previously discussed, unmarried individuals are more likely to experience ongoing feelings 
of stigma, social isolation, and discrimination. Insofar as these experiences threaten social 
well-being, unmarried individuals may be at increased risk for maladaptive changes in 
cortisol activity as well as for their potential downstream implications for health.
The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between current marital status 
and daily cortisol levels and slopes. Based on previous literature showing that being 
currently married is associated with better health and less interpersonal stress, we 
hypothesized that married individuals would show lower daily cortisol levels and steeper 
negative cortisol slopes compared to previously married and never married people. We also 
explored the possibility that lower levels of cortisol among married individuals may stem

 from their marital status providing protection (stress-buffering) from the consequences of 
life stress (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Burman & Margolin, 1992; Hostinar et al., 2014). Models 
of stress buffering contend that close social relationships provide an individual with 
psychological and material resources that improve coping (Thoits, 1986; Cohen, 2004). To 
examine this hypothesis, we tested whether perceived stress was associated with less HPA 
activation among the married than among the previously and never married (perceived stress 
by marriage status interaction).
To evaluate our hypotheses, we collected multiple measures of salivary cortisol across the 
waking period of each of three non-consecutive days and compared married, previously 
married, and never married participants on average area under the curve and steepness of 
diurnal slopes across the three sampling days. We controlled for demographics, body mass 
index (BMI), seasons of the year the samples were collected, as well as extraversion, 
neuroticism, and agreeableness, personality characteristics that may be associated with both 
selection into marriage as well as cortisol outcomes (Miller et al., 1999).
2. Methods
2.1 Participants
We examined archival data combined from three viral-challenge studies. Pittsburgh Cold 
Study 2 (PCS2) was conducted from 1997–2001, Pittsburgh Mind-Body Center Study 
(PMBC) from 2000–2004, and Pittsburgh Cold Study 3 (PCS3) from 2007–2011. All three 
studies were conducted by our laboratory. Full descriptions and data from each study can be 
found at www.commoncoldproject.com.
In total, 740 participants completed the studies. We excluded those younger than 21 (n = 
109) because one of the studies (PMBC) was limited to those 21 or older, and because of the 
very low rate of marriage (6.4% vs 28% in remainder of sample) in participants under 21 
years. We also excluded participants from analyses if they were missing relevant covariates 
(n = 1) or primary outcome data (n = 58). The final sample consisted of 572 healthy adults 
between the ages of 21 and 55 years (M = 33.7, SD = 10.2) recruited from the Pittsburgh, PA 
area. The sample was 48% female, and 63% white, 32% African-American, and 5% other 
ethnicities. All participants provided informed consent and received financial compensation 
for their participation. The institutional review boards at both the University of Pittsburgh 
School of Medicine and Carnegie Mellon University approved each study.
2.2 Procedures
In each of the three studies, participants completed both a telephone screening and a 
physical examination administered by the study physician to determine that they were in 
good health and did not meet any of the study exclusion criteria: history of chronic illness, 
regular use of prohibited medication (including but not limited to antidepressants, sleeping 
pills, and tranquilizers), recent psychiatric hospitalization, recent psychiatric diagnosis, HIV 
seropositivity, abnormal clinical profiles as determined by urinalysis, complete blood count, 
and blood chemistry, current pregnancy or lactation, recent participation in another 
psychological study, having cold or flu-like symptoms within the previous 30 days from

 baseline, previous flu-related hospitalization, and/or use of a steroid or immunosuppressant 
within the previous three months. The three parent viral-challenge studies all included 
baseline data collected before participants were exposed to a virus and all data reported here 
were collected during that baseline period.
2.3 Measures
2.3.1 Salivary Cortisol—Multiple measures of salivary cortisol were collected across the 
waking period of each of three non-consecutive days (see suggestions in Kraemer et al., 
2006; Saxbe, 2008). To collect saliva samples for quantifying cortisol, participants were 
provided with rolls of cotton inside of a plastic collection tube (Salivettes®; Sarstedt AG & 
Co, Nümbrecht, Germany). They were instructed to place the cotton in their mouth, allow it 
to become saturated with saliva, spit the cotton back into the tube, and then reseal it. Both 
detailed written instructions and either a pre-programmed wristwatch (PCS2) or handheld 
computer (PCS3 and PMBC) were provided to signal participants at each collection time. In 
addition, the signaling device also provided a unique alphanumeric code for each collection. 
Participants were instructed to write the code as well as the exact time and date of collection 
on each tube right after it was sealed and then store the tubes in their refrigerator. 
Participants then brought the tubes with them to their baseline study session where they were 
collected by staff.
Two of the three cortisol samples were collected on non-consecutive days in participant’s 
natural environments (home, work, etc.) 1–6 weeks prior to the viral-challenge; the third was 
collected on the baseline day in quarantine (prior to the viral-challenge). In PMBC and 
PCS3, salivary cortisol was assessed seven times daily (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 hours post-
waking) on each of the pre-quarantine days, and eight times during the first 24 hours of 
quarantine (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 14 hours post-waking). In PCS2, cortisol was collected 11 
times daily on each of two pre-quarantine days and 14 times during the first 24 hours of 
quarantine before viral-challenge. In order to minimize between study method variance 
(establish approximate equivalency across studies) while still accurately capturing the 
diurnal rhythm of cortisol, we used 7 samples from pre-quarantine days (assessed at 1, 2, 4, 
7, 9, 11, and 14 hours post-waking) and 8 samples from the baseline day of quarantine (0, 1, 
4.25, 6.25, 7.25, 9.25, 12.75, and 16.75 hours post-waking) when analyzing data from the 
PCS2 participants (cf. Janicki-Deverts et al., 2016; http://www.cmu.edu/common-cold-
project//combining-the-5-studies/variable-modifications.html).
The laboratory of Dr. Clemens Kirschbaum in Dresden, Germany assayed cortisol for PCS2 
and PCS3. Cortisol concentrations were determined using time-resolved fluorescence 
immunoassays with a cortisol-biotin conjugate as a tracer (Dressendörfer et al., 1992). Intra- 
and inter-assay variables were both less than 12%. The Immunologic Monitoring and 
Cellular Products Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute assayed cortisol 
for PMBC. Here, cortisol concentrations were determined via enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (Salimeterics, State College, PA); average deviation between 
individual pairs of replicates was 4%. Previous research has shown these two assay 
procedures provide very similar results (r = .97; Dressendörfer et al., 1992). Nonetheless, to

 control for any potential differences in methodology among the studies, we included study 
as a covariate.
In all cases, samples were only included for analysis if they were collected ±45 minutes of 
the scheduled collection time. This was based on our earlier work indicating we could 
maintain 95% or more of the data using this range and at the same time retain the normal 
diurnal rhythm (e.g., Janicki-Deverts et al., 2016; also, see http://www.cmu.edu/common-
cold-project//combining-the-5-studies/variable-modifications.html). Samples collected 
outside of this window were treated as missing. The actual rather than the expected 
(signaled) time the participant provided each cortisol sample was used in the calculation of 
both AUC and slopes. To calculate a measure of average daily cortisol levels, the area under 
the curve (AUC) each day was computed for individuals with sufficient data following 
methods established by Pruessner et al. (2003). Sufficient data was defined as not missing 
any of the first three samples of the day (when diurnal rhythm is steep) or more than two of 
the day’s remaining samples (when diurnal rhythm flattens). Five hundred seventy two 
(90.8%) of the 630 potential participants (ages 21–55; not missing any covariates) had 
sufficient data to calculate cortisol AUC. Next, average total cortisol levels were calculated 
for participants who had data for at least two of the three collection days. This was done by 
averaging total adjusted concentrations from all days with sufficient data. Finally, due to 
non-normality of the data, the average total concentrations of cortisol were log-10 
transformed.
We also used these cortisol samples across the three study days to model participants’ 
typical daily cortisol slopes. For this, the raw cortisol values were log-10 transformed, and 
slopes were modeled directly using multilevel modeling methods (see Data Analysis section 
below). These methods accommodate missing data and hence use all available data. Again, 
we used the actual time each sample was collected in model. Among the 572 participants in 
the sample with sufficient data, there were 12,584 potential cortisol measurement 
opportunities (572 participants × 22 possible observations per person) for use in analyses of 
diurnal slopes, and cortisol data was available for 96.3% (n = 12,117) of these collection 
times.
2.3.2 Marital Status—An item from the Social Network Index (SNI; Cohen et al., 1997) 
asked participants to report if they were (a) currently married and living together, or living 
with someone in a marital-like relationship, (b) never married and never had lived with 
someone in a marital-like relationship, (c) separated, (d) divorced or formerly had lived with 
someone in a marital-like relationship, or (e) widowed. Due to a low percentage of 
participants identifying as separated, divorced, or widowed, these three categories were 
collapsed into a single category for previously married. Of the 572 participants, 160 were 
currently married (CM; 28%), 292 had never been married (NM; 51%), and 120 had been 
previously married (PM; 80 divorced, 34 separated, and 6 widowed; 21%). See Table 1 for 
demographic information within marital categories.
2.3.3 Perceived Stress—Perceived stress was measured using the 10-item Perceived 
Stress Scale (PSS-10; Cohen & Williamson, 1988). The PSS-10 asks participants to rate how 
often they find their lives to be unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded on a five-point 
Chin et al.

 Likert scale ranging from 0 = “Never” to 4 = “Very Often.” Reversed items were recoded 
(e.g., 4=0) and responses for each item were summed to create an index of total perceived 
stress. Internal consistency across the three samples was satisfactory (Cronbach’s α = .87).
2.3.4 Personality—In PCS2 and PMBC, the personality traits of extraversion, 
neuroticism, and agreeableness were measured using a modified version of Goldberg’s 
Adjective Scale (Goldberg, 1992) which asked participants to rate the extent to which 
several trait-like adjectives accurately described them compared to other individuals of the 
same sex and age. In PCS3, extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness were measured 
using the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP; Goldberg et al., 2006) which asked 
participants to rate the extent to which several self-referent descriptive phrases describe them 
compared to others of their sex and age. Correlations between the adjective subscales and 
the IPIP have been reported as being between .72 and .84 for extraversion and neuroticism, 
and between .54 and .66 for agreeableness (Saucier & Goldberg, 2002). To establish inter-
study equivalency, we converted the raw values for each subscale to z-scores before 
inclusion in analyses.
2.3.5 Primary Control Variables—All the primary control variables were selected a 
priori because of their potential associations with both marital status and cortisol (e.g., 
Aughinbaugh et al., 2013; Averett et al., 2008; Champaneri et al., 2013; Cohen et al., 2006; 
Van Cauter et al., 1996). The seven primary covariates were assessed at screening as part of 
a demographics questionnaire: age (years), sex (male or female), race (dichotomized as 
white or non-white due to the small number of non-black racial groups represented), and 
education (years). BMI (weight [kg]/height [m]2) was computed from objective measures of 
height and weight taken on the first day of quarantine. Season of the year of the trial was 
determined from the date of the last day of cortisol sampling and was indexed using three 
dummy codes with spring being the reference category. Finally, because of differences 
between the studies’ cortisol assays and personality questionnaires, two dummy variables 
indicating which of the three studies the participant had been in (using PCS3 as the reference 
category) were included as covariates to adjust for any potential effects of these differences. 
All seven of these variables were included in all of the analyses. These are the same primary 
control variables used in our earlier analyses predicting cortisol response in cold study data 
(e.g., Janicki-Deverts et al., 2016).
2.4 Data Analysis
2.4.1 Waking Day Cortisol Levels—All analyses with cortisol AUC as the outcome 
were performed using SPSS (Version 23; IBM Corporation). We used hierarchical multiple 
linear regression to examine the association between marital status and cortisol levels as well 
as the interaction between perceived stress and marital status on cortisol levels. In the first 
step, we entered the primary control variables (age, sex, race, BMI, education, season of the 
year, and study). Then, in the second step, we added dummy codes for marital status 
(currently married individuals served as the reference group). Next, in the third step, we 
added the continuous perceived stress variable. Finally, in the fourth step, we entered the 
marital status by perceived stress interaction terms. In other words, the model testing for the 
association between marital status and cortisol did not include interaction terms but the

 model testing for interactions included both main effects as well as the interaction terms 
(Cohen et al., 2013). For significant interactions, we tested the decomposed individual 
regression slopes (i.e., “simple slopes”) for each marital category using the PROCESS 
macro for SPSS (Version 2.16.1; Hayes, 2013). For these analyses, we report unstandardized 
regression coefficients (b), p-values, and 95% CIs for the b-values. To provide an index of 
effect size, we also provide standardized effect size estimates (d), for group differences in 
cortisol levels.
2.4.2 Waking Day Cortisol Slopes—We used multilevel modeling to assess whether 
daily cortisol slopes differed as a function of marital status, as well as whether perceived 
stress moderated this association. Specifically, due to the amount of variability in cortisol 
that can be attributed to day-to-day fluctuations (ICC = 0.31), we evaluated 3-level models 
(individual cortisol measurements nested within sampling days nested within people) using 
the software HLM (Version 6.08; Raudenbush et al., 2004). At Level-1, log-transformed 
cortisol values were predicted as a function of time since the first sample of the day. For the 
time variable, we used the actual times (in hours) that participants recorded on their 
Salivette® plastic collection tubes. We also included the quadratic term for time, which 
allowed us to examine possible differences in the acceleration of the decline in cortisol 
across the day as a function of marital status. For two of the three sampling days for all three 
studies, the first cortisol measure was taken at 1-hour post waking; on the third day it was 
taken at waking. As such, to better reflect the majority of our data in the test for the 
intercept, we transformed the time variable by subtracting 1 from each value so that 0 
represented the estimate of cortisol at 1-hour post waking. At Level-2, the Level-1 intercept 
and slopes were modeled by intercept terms for the three sampling days. At Level-3, the 
Level-2 intercepts were predicted as a function of individual differences in marital status. 
For this, we once again used two binary dummy codes to capture the three categories of 
marital status, with currently married individuals being the reference group. In the model 
testing for the interaction between perceived stress and marital status, we also added the 
perceived stress variable along with the two interaction terms between perceived stress and 
the dummy variables for marital status at Level-3 (currently married individuals were the 
reference group). Models were estimated using an unstructured covariance matrix, and we 
modeled the random effects for all Level-1 and Level-2 intercept and slope terms (for full 
model results including the random effects, please refer to the Supplementary Online 
Tables).
We included several person-level covariates at Level-3. Specifically, we adjusted for 
individual differences in age, sex, race, years of education, study, BMI, and season. We 
centered these covariates around their respective means prior to analysis. While mean 
centering binary variables such as sex and race may at first seem unintuitive, it is an 
accepted statistical practice that allows for examining the nature of intercepts and regression 
slopes regardless of individual differences in the various binary variables (for further 
discussions about the rationale for centering binary variables in multilevel modeling, see 
Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Hox et al., 2010). Here, we report the multilevel model 
regression coefficients (γ), p-values, and 95% CIs for the γ-values. Additionally, we report

 χ2 tests for the contrasts testing whether two (or more) regression slopes differ from each 
other.
3. Results
3.1 Marital Status and Waking Day Cortisol Levels
Adjusting for the control variables, we found an association between marital status and total 
levels of cortisol. Specifically, relative to currently married individuals, we found higher 
cortisol levels among those who were either never married, b = .05, p = .01, 95% CI = [.01, .
09], d = .25, or previously married, b = .06, p = .01, 95% CI = [.01, .10], d = .28 (see Figure 
1). These findings were not attenuated by further adjusting the model simultaneously for 
individual differences in extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness.
3.2 Interaction of Perceived Stress with Marital Status on Cortisol Levels
Adjusting for the control variables, marital status groups did not differ in their average 
PSS-10 scores, F(2,559) = .77, p = .47, nor was there an overall association between 
perceived stress and cortisol levels, b = −0.0001, p = .94, 95% CI = [−.003, .002]. However, 
stress moderated the association between marital status and cortisol levels, ΔR2 = .01, 
F(2,556) = 3.28, p = .04. To evaluate the nature of this interaction, we tested the simple 
slopes for each of the three marital status categories (see Figure 2). There was no association 
between perceived stress and cortisol levels among individuals who were either currently 
married, b = −.001, p = .55, 95% CI = [−.006, .003], or never married, b = −.002, p = .31, 
95% CI = [−.005, .002]. Conversely, there was an association between perceived stress and 
cortisol levels among previously married individuals, with increases in stress predicting 
higher daily cortisol levels, b = .006, p = .02, 95% CI = [.001, .012].
3.3 Marital Status and Daily Cortisol Slopes
We used multilevel modeling to test if daily cortisol rhythms differed as a function of marital 
status. There were no differences in cortisol between the three marital status categories at 1-
hour post-waking (i.e., the intercept coefficients), χ2(2) = 0.79, p > .50, and all three groups 
showed a normative decline in cortisol over the day, γCM = −0.06, pCM < .001, 95% = 
[−0.07, −0.05]; γNM = −0.04, pNM < .001, 95% CI = [−0.05, −0.03]; and γPM = −0.05, pPM 
< .001, 95% CI = [−0.06, −0.04]. There was also an interaction between marital status and 
time, χ2(2) = 8.96, p = .01 (see top panel of Figure 3), such that individuals who were 
currently married had a steeper daily decline in cortisol slopes than individuals who were 
never married, γ = −0.02, p = .004, 95% CI= [−0.03, −0.01]. While currently married 
individuals in our sample also showed apparently steeper slopes than previously married 
individuals, the difference was marginal, γ = −0.01, p = .13, 95% CI = [−0.022, 0.003].
When testing the association between the quadratic term for time and cortisol (i.e., whether 
the quadratic term for each marital status group was different from 0), currently married 
individuals showed evidence for a curvilinear association between cortisol and time, γCM = 
0.0011, pCM < .001, 95% CI = [0.0005, 0.0017]. Conversely, we did not find curvilinear 
associations between cortisol and time among never or previously married individuals, γNM 
= 0.0001, pNM = .61, 95% CI = [−0.0003, 0.0006], and γPM = 0.0007, pPM = .08, 95% CI =

 [−0.0001, 0.0014]. Next, we tested whether there was an interaction between marital status 
and the quadratic term for time. We found evidence that marital status moderated the 
association between the quadratic term for time and cortisol, χ2(2) = 5.44, p = .06 (see 
bottom panel of Figure 3), such that individuals who were currently married showed a more 
rapidly accelerating decline in cortisol through the afternoon before flattening in the evening 
compared to individuals who were never married, γ = −0.0009, p = .02, 95% CI = [−0.0018, 
−0.0001]. In contrast, while currently married individuals in our sample also showed 
apparently stronger curvilinear cortisol responses than previously married individuals, the 
difference in the magnitude of the association was not statistically distinguishable, γ = 
−0.0004, p = .33, 95% CI = [−0.0012, 0.0004]. Consistent with the analyses of cortisol 
levels, further adjusting the model simultaneously for individual differences in the 
personality traits extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness did not alter either the linear 
or the quadratic findings.
Finally, we tested whether perceived stress moderated the association between marital status 
and cortisol slopes (i.e., perceived stress × marital status dummy codes × time). For this, we 
entered the variable for perceived stress along with interaction terms for perceived stress and 
marital status at Level-3 of the model. We did not find evidence that perceived stress 
moderated the association between marital status and cortisol slopes, χ2(6) = 5.38, p > .50.
4. Discussion
Both cross-sectional and prospective studies of the association of marital status and health 
suggest that married individuals are healthier than either individuals who were never or 
previously married (divorced, separated, or widowed). These effects are often attributed to 
higher levels of interpersonal stress experienced by unmarried people. Elevated levels of 
cortisol, a potential biological consequence of interpersonal stress, is one candidate 
mechanism accounting for the association of marital status and health. Here we tested 
cortisol levels assessed throughout the day on three non-consecutive days to evaluate daily 
cortisol levels and slopes. We found that married individuals had lower diurnal cortisol 
levels than either their never married or previously married counterparts. Furthermore, 
individuals who were currently married showed steeper daytime cortisol slopes than 
individuals who had never or previously (marginal difference) married.
Differences in daily cortisol levels between married and unmarried individuals were not due 
to general differences in individuals’ starting values for cortisol at the beginning of the day. 
Rather, overall differences in cortisol levels were due at least in part to currently married 
individuals having shown a more rapidly accelerating decline in cortisol through the 
afternoon hours (before flattening off in the evening hours) compared to individuals who 
were never married (though not individuals who had been previously married). These data 
are consistent with evidence that individuals who face persistent threats to their social well-
being tend to have higher afternoon cortisol than those who do not (Miller et al., 2007).
Marriage may be associated with lower cortisol and steeper slopes because most married 
people are relatively satisfied with their marriages (Davis et al., 2006), and hence lack much 
of the interpersonal stress associated with being in a poor marriage or being unmarried.

 However, a recent meta-analysis found no relationship between marital quality and diurnal 
cortisol slopes, although this conclusion was tempered by inadequate numbers of sampling 
days, and small sample sizes (Robles et al., 2014). (This study was unable to test the role of 
marital quality because a validated marital quality measure was not available across the three 
studies). Alternatively, married persons may have lower cortisol levels and steeper slopes 
irrespective of the quality of their relationships because they have better access to healthcare 
due to the availability of insurance, more economic support, or because marriage encourages 
regular routines, positive health practices and less risky behavior.
We did not find differences in overall levels of perceived stress as assessed by the PSS 
among the three categories of marital status. This was contrary to our hypothesis that 
unmarried individuals would have higher levels of cortisol resulting from heightened 
psychological stress. One possible explanation for this comes from the literature discussed 
earlier suggesting that unmarried individuals experience more threats to the social-self (e.g., 
shame and loss), and that these social stressors trigger cortisol dysregulation (Dickerson & 
Kemeny, 2004; Miller et al., 2007). However, the stress instrument we employed, the PSS, 
evaluates broad, global feelings of stress. As such, a more targeted assessment of 
interpersonal stress may have been more sensitive for detecting relevant differences.
We did find partial support for the stress-buffering effect of marriage (Cohen & Wills, 1985; 
Burman & Margolis, 1992). Specifically, while individuals who were currently or never 
married did not show differential cortisol levels as a function of perceived stress, previously 
married individuals who reported more stress had higher daily cortisol AUC values. This 
could reflect greater coping resources among the currently and never married (though 
exploratory analyses did not find evidence for any moderating, mediating, or mediated 
moderating effects of social support). Alternatively, the elevated levels of interpersonal stress 
associated with being previously married may exacerbate the consequences of global life 
stress on cortisol (Gove & Shin, 1989). Conversely, there was no stress-buffering effect of 
marriage for daily cortisol slopes. One possible explanation for this is that while cortisol 
levels may be sensitive to general perceptions of stress, diurnal cortisol slopes may be 
affected only by severe and enduring stressors (e.g., Cohen et al., 2006).
Our results differ from two earlier studies that did not find differences in cortisol levels 
based on marital status (Luecken et al. 1997; Englert et al., 2008). However, these studies 
varied from ours in a number of ways. First, while both studies included health-related 
covariates based on either self-reported health status (Englert et al., 2008) or medication use 
(Luecken et al., 1997), participants in these samples were not (like in the current study) 
specifically selected because they were in good health as indicated by a thorough medical 
exam. Second, both of these other studies included participants over 55 years old (our 
maximum). Older individuals are more likely to suffer from maladies that might influence 
cortisol regulation, which may in turn increase variability in observed cortisol responses 
making it more difficult to find differences attributable to marital status. Third, both of these 
studies were limited to women. In studies of the association of marital status with morbidity 
and mortality, the benefits of marriage are generally found to be stronger for men than 
women (Kiecolt-Glaser & Newton, 2001). Hence studies of marital status and cortisol that 
are restricted to women may provide a constrained test of the hypothesis. Finally, both

 studies assessed cortisol during only one day (Luecken et al., 1997 used 24 hr urines and 
Englert et al., 2008 overnight urines). The 3 waking day assessments we collected over 
several weeks provides a more reliable indicator of cortisol levels.
There are several limitations to the current research that warrant consideration. First, the 
observational nature of this study prevents us from drawing causal inferences about the 
direction of the association between marital status and cortisol. However, it seems unlikely 
that differences in cortisol influence who becomes or remains married, especially in a 
sample selected to be in excellent health. To our knowledge, elevated levels (within normal 
ranges) of cortisol themselves are not associated with any behavioral manifestations that 
select people into a marital status. Furthermore, we adjusted our analyses for personality 
characteristics that might have confounded our results (extraversion, neuroticism and 
agreeableness). Doing so did not result in any attenuation in the strength of the association 
between marital status and cortisol. Of course, it is always possible that some other 
unmeasured third variable might account for our findings. Second, this research examined a 
relatively young sample selected for good health and thus the current results may not be 
generalizable to older or less healthy populations. It is certainly possible that various 
classifications of marital status may have very different meanings among younger versus 
older individuals. For example, being divorced, separated or bereaved may be more 
acceptable (and normative) for a 60-year-old than a 30-year-old. Third, it is possible that the 
use of three days of cortisol collection was not sufficient to optimize the reliability of the 
cortisol measures (Segerstrom et al., 2014; see alternative views in Kraemer et al., 2006; 
Saxbe, 2008). If this is the case, we have underestimated the effect sizes reported here.
Finally, an assumption of this study is that cortisol may be an important mediator of the 
association between marital status and health outcomes. Although not reported here, marital 
status was not related to risk of objectively catching a cold in the parent studies. 
Consequently, we were unable to test cortisol as a mediator of the association between 
marital status and disease. However, there is increasing evidence that elevated levels of 
cortisol and flatter cortisol rhythms may play a role in other important health outcomes 
including cardiovascular risk (Matthews et al., 2006) and cancer mortality (Sephton et al., 
2000).
