Periodic Screening Pelvic Examination
Evidence Report and Systematic Review
for the US Preventive Services Task Force
Janelle M. Guirguis-Blake, MD; Jillian T. Henderson, PhD; Leslie A. Perdue, MPH
IMPORTANCE Recent changes in the periodicity of cervical cancer screening have led to
questions about the role of screening pelvic examinations among asymptomatic women.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review literature on health benefits, accuracy, and harms of the
screening pelvic examination for gynecologic conditions for the US Preventive Services Task
Force (USPSTF).
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for
relevant English-language studies published through January 13, 2016, with surveillance
through August 3, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and studies. The search
yielded 8678 unique citations; 316 full-text articles were reviewed, and 9 studies including
27 630 patients met inclusion criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers rated study quality using USPSTF criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Morbidity; mortality; diagnostic accuracy for any
gynecologic cancer or condition except cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, which are
covered by other USPSTF screening recommendations; harms (false-positive rates,
false-negative rates, surgery rates).
RESULTS No trials examined the effectiveness of the pelvic examination in reducing all-cause
mortality, reducing cancer- and disease-specific morbidity and mortality, or improving quality
of life. Eight studies reported accuracy for the screening pelvic examination: ovarian cancer
(4 studies; n = 26 432), bacterial vaginosis (2 studies; n = 930), trichomoniasis (1 study;
n = 779), and genital herpes (1 study; n = 779). In the 4 ovarian cancer screening studies, low
prevalence of ovarian cancer consistently resulted in low positive predictive values (PPVs)
and false-positive rates, with a lack of precision in accuracy estimates (sensitivity range,
0%-100%; specificity range, 91%-99%; PPV range, 0%-3.6%; negative predictive value
[NPV] range, �99%). Each diagnostic accuracy study for bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis,
and genital herpes was performed in a high-prevalence population with substantial
proportions of symptomatic patients and reported accuracy characteristics for individual
physical examination findings (bacterial vaginosis, homogeneous discharge: sensitivity range,
69%-79%; specificity range, 54%-97%; PPV range, 52%-95%; NPV range, 79%-80%; herpes
simplex virus, vulvar ulcerations: sensitivity, 20%; specificity, 98%; PPV, 88%; NPV, 57%;
trichomoniasis, colpitis macularis: sensitivity, 2%; specificity, 100%; PPV, 100%; NPV, 85%).
Surgery rates resulting from an abnormal screening pelvic examination for ovarian cancer
ranged from 5% to 36% at 1 year, with the largest study reporting an 11% surgery rate and 1%
complication rate within 1 year of a screening pelvic examination with abnormal findings.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No direct evidence was identified for overall benefits and
harms of the pelvic examination as a 1-time or periodic screening test. Limited evidence was
identified regarding the diagnostic accuracy and harms of routine screening pelvic
examinations in asymptomatic primary care populations.

I
n 2012, 44.2 million pelvic examinations were performed in
US outpatient visits,1 and in a 2008-2009 survey of physi-
cians, 69.1% agreed that the pelvic examination is an effective
screening test for ovarian cancer.2 Multiple malignant and benign
gynecologic conditions can be detected with pelvic examination,
and the value of early detection among asymptomatic women
depends on natural history, prevalence, disease morbidity, and
early treatment effectiveness.3,4 For some gynecologic conditions,
alternative effective screening approaches are recommended
(eg, nucleic acid amplification test for gonorrhea and chlamydia,5
Papanicolaou smear and human papillomavirus testing for cer-
vical cancer6). As recommended intervals for cervical cancer
screening have been lengthened,6-8 the health benefits of annual
pelvic examinations among asymptomatic women have increas-
ingly been questioned.9-12 Current professional organizations’
guidelines for the administration of the screening pelvic examina-
tion are based on limited evidence and expert opinion, and these
guidelines vary widely.13-15 The current evidence review was under-
taken to inform US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) delib-
erations on whether nonpregnant women without gynecologic
symptoms would obtain net health benefits from periodic screen-
ing pelvic examinations.
Methods
Scope of Review
In this evidence review, the pelvic examination was defined as
visual inspection of the external genitalia; a speculum examination
of the vagina and cervix; bimanual examination of the adnexa,
uterus, and cervix; and may include the rectovaginal examination.13
This review addresses the benefits and harms of screening with the
pelvic examination for benign and malignant gynecologic condi-
tions as well as the diagnostic accuracy of the pelvic examination in
detecting individual benign and malignant gynecologic conditions.
The analytic framework and key questions that guided the review
are shown in Figure 1. Detailed methods are available in the full evi-
dence report at https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org
/Page/Document/final-evidence-review140/gynecological
-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination.
Although the pelvic examination is commonly performed in
adolescent and pregnant women, these populations were specifi-
cally excluded from the scope of this review. The purpose of con-
ducting the pelvic examination in unselected nonpregnant adult
women often differs from that in special populations of adoles-
cents (eg, Tanner staging, congenital abnormality case-finding) or
pregnant women (eg, assessment of pregnancy dating, pelvic
outlet adequacy, cervical dilation). Likewise, screening for congeni-
tal gynecological conditions was excluded because this review
focuses on routine periodic screening, and many of the congenital
conditions would be detected at the symptomatic stage, during
pregnancy, at infertility workup, or incidentally during cervical
cancer screening.
In addition, the USPSTF previously determined that there is
good evidence for primary screening approaches for cervical can-
cer (such as Papanicolaou and human papillomavirus cotesting)
and for gonorrhea and chlamydia (such as nucleic acid amplifica-
tion testing). Since the pelvic examination alone is less accurate
than these screening approaches, these conditions were not
included in this review.
Data Sources and Searches
MEDLINE, PubMed (publisher-supplied references only), and
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched
to locate primary studies informing the key questions (eMethods
in the Supplement) and published from the earliest date in-
dexed (1946 for MEDLINE) through January 13, 2016. The data-
base searches were supplemented with experts’suggestions and
reference lists from all other recent systematic reviews.17,18
ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials.
The National Cancer Institute provided previously unpublished
data on the subset of randomized women from the Prostate, Lung,
Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial who had
undergone bimanual palpation of the ovaries and adnexa as well as
rectovaginal examination (Paul Pinsky, PhD, National Cancer Insti-
tute, written communication, May 2, 2016); the 5-year follow-up
results were subsequently published.19 Since January 2016, ongo-
ing surveillance was conducted through article alerts and targeted
searches of high-impact journals to identify major studies pub-
lished in the interim that may affect the conclusions or understand-
ing of the evidence and therefore the related USPSTF recommen-
dation. The last surveillance was conducted on August 3, 2016, and
identified no new studies.
Study Selection
Two investigators independently reviewed 8678 titles and
abstracts by using an online platform (abstrackr20) and 316
articles (Figure 2) with specified inclusion criteria (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Discrepancies were resolved through consensus
and consultation with a third investigator. Articles that did not
meet inclusion criteria or those rated as poor quality were
excluded; criteria for establishing study quality are noted in eTable
2 in the Supplement. To avoid missing studies using the pelvic
examination as a secondary screening test (eg, ovarian cancer
screening studies using cancer antigen 125 [CA-125] measurement
and ultrasound technology that also included a pelvic examination
component), reviewers were more inclusive during the review of
abstracts and titles. As a result, many studies were excluded at the
full-text review.

symptomatic or pregnant and were conducted in developed coun-
tries, as defined by “very high”development according to the 2014
United Nations Human Development Index.21 Studies conducted
solely in symptomatic populations were excluded.
Any study that examined the relationship between pelvic ex-
amination and all-cause mortality, cancer- or disease-specific mor-
bidity or mortality, or quality of life was eligible for inclusion. In ad-
dition, studies examining the screening accuracy of the pelvic

Newcastle Ottawa Scales22 for cohort and case-control studies
and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies I and
II23,24 for studies of diagnostic accuracy adapted to align with the
USPSTF’
s design-specific quality criteria16 (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). Disagreements in quality rating were resolved by consen-
sus or consultation with a third independent reviewer. Included
studies were limited to those published in English that were rated
as good or fair quality using USPSTF quality-rating standards.16
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Results were qualitatively synthesized by key question (Figure 1).
For all of the studies of diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and speci-
ficity were calculated in Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp), using
Jeffrey confidence intervals from 2 × 2 tables constructed from
data reported in the primary studies. In many cases the data
presented differ slightly from the data in the published article
because of these calculations. For diagnostic accuracy studies, in
addition to the standard test performance characteristics (sensi-
tivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative
predictive value [NPV]), the following outcomes were calculated:
condition prevalence in the study population, percentage of
patients screening positive, false-positive rate, and false-negative
rate. Since there were a limited number of studies for each condi-
tion, no pooled analyses were conducted.
Results
Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review
(Figure 2). The results are organized by key question. Eight of the
9 included studies reported outcomes for both key question 2
(accuracy) and key question 3 (harms). A single additional study
on key question 3 (harms) was also included.
Benefits of Screening
Key Question 1. What is the direct evidence for the effectiveness
of the pelvic examination in (a) reducing all-cause mortality,
(b) reducing cancer- and disease-specific morbidity and mortality,
and (c) improving quality of life?
There was no direct evidence comparing the effectiveness
of pelvic examination screening and no screening on patient
health outcomes.
Accuracy of Screening Pelvic Examination
Key Question 2. What are the test performance characteristics
of the pelvic examination (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV)
in screening for gynecologic cancers and other gynecologic
conditions?
Studies examining the diagnostic screening accuracy of the
pelvic examination were identified for 4 gynecologic conditions:
ovarian cancer, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and genital
herpes. In total, 4 studies examined the accuracy of the pelvic
examination to detect ovarian cancer in asymptomatic popula-
tions, while 1 to 2 studies in high-prevalence populations with
substantial proportions of symptomatic patients were identified
for each of the infectious diseases (bacterial vaginosis, trichomo-
niasis, and genital herpes).
Ovarian Cancer
Data from 1 good-quality study and 3 fair-quality studies
(n = 26 432) were identified to estimate the screening accuracy

trial (n = 20 872), a large multicenter US randomized clinical
trial, recruited average-risk women aged 55 to 74 years from the
community to test the benefits and harms of ovarian cancer
screening using a combination of 3 modalities: measurement of
CA-125 levels, ultrasound, and ovarian palpation/rectovaginal
examination.28 Ovarian palpation was stopped after the first 5
years of the trial because no ovarian cancers were detected solely
with this test; accuracy information and clinical outcomes result-
ing from ovarian palpation were not included in published results
from the trial. The unpublished results were obtained from
National Cancer Institute PLCO investigators. The other 3 were
prospective diagnostic accuracy studies (n = 5560) conducted in
Greece, Australia, and the United Kingdom; they primarily
recruited average-risk women aged 40 to 45 years and older from
the community (Table 1).
Mean or median age ranged from 51 to 63 years. In the 2
studies reporting menopausal status, 43%27 and 65%26 of partici-
pants were postmenopausal. In the other 2 studies, all or nearly
all were postmenopausal.25,28 None of the studies excluded
women with a family history of ovarian cancer, and 1 actively
recruited younger women with family history.27 One study
defined the test as bimanual ovarian palpation plus rectovaginal
examination,28 another clearly defined the index pelvic examina-
tion test as bimanual and speculum examination,27 while the
other 2 defined the index test only as a “pelvic exam”
26 or “vagi-
nal exam.”
25 Two studies specified that experienced gynecolo-
gists or examiners performed the examination,26,28 and in the
other studies a single examiner27 or 1 of 2 examiners25 performed
the examinations.
A positive index test finding was a palpable pelvic or adnexal
mass of any size. The PLCO trial used a reference standard for ovar-
ian cancer diagnoses captured in medical records and participant
questionnaires; investigators reported cancer incidence at 1 year
and up to 5 years for the purposes of this analysis.19,28,29 The other
3 studies used a reference standard of incident ovarian cancer re-
portedina1-yearpatientquestionnaireandmeasurementofCA-125
levels with or without ultrasound.25-27 Abnormal ultrasound find-
ings or CA-125 levels were variably defined in the different studies.
Ovarian cancer prevalence was reported as 0.1% in 3
studies25,26 and 0.04% in 1 study27; the longer follow-up from the
PLCO trial (5 years) yielded 0.3% prevalence of ovarian cancer
(Table 2). The comparable 1-year follow-up results for the propor-
tion of screened patients with a positive pelvic examination find-
ing ranged from 1.2% to 8.7%. Sensitivity was reported as
100.0% in 2 of the studies25,26 (1-2 ovarian cancer cases were pal-
pable on pelvic examination) and as 0% (95% CI, 0%-85.3%) in
the study in which the single case of ovarian cancer was not
detected with the pelvic examination.27 The PLCO trial reported a
sensitivity of 4.3% (95% CI, 0.5%-18.6%) and 2.8% (95% CI,
0.6%-8.6%) from the first screening examination at 1-year
follow-up (23 cases) and up to 5 years’follow-up (72 cases).
Specificity ranged from 91.4% (95% CI, 90.1%-92.6%) to 98.8%

CI, 0%-6.0%) to 3.6% (95% CI, 0.4%-15.5%), and NPV was 99%
or greater for all studies.19,25-27 In all studies except the PLCO trial,
accuracy estimates had wide confidence intervals because of the
very low event rate.
Bacterial Vaginosis
No screening studies were conducted solely in asymptomatic
primary care populations. Two fair-quality US studies (n = 930)
with large proportions of symptomatic patients assessed the
accuracy of different approaches to diagnosing bacterial vagino-
sis, including findings visible on the pelvic examination.30,31
Gutman et al (n = 269)30 recruited any woman undergoing
a “routine pelvic examination”from a hospital-based primary care
clinic, colposcopy clinic, or research clinic, whereas Eschenbach
et al (n = 661)31 recruited nonpregnant women aged 16 to
50 years from a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic under-
going a “standardized pelvic examination”(Table 3). Neither
study had a primary aim of estimating the accuracy of the pelvic
examination; instead, they explored different clinical signs and
diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis measured against a gold
standard (Nugent criteria30 or criteria based on pH; Gram stain
microscopy31,34).
The patients in the study by Gutman et al30 had a mean age
of 24.1 years, with 38% of patients being white, 30% black, and
27% Hispanic; the study by Eschenbach et al31 did not report
patient characteristics. In the study by Gutman et al,30 33% of
patients were symptomatic, while the study by Eschenbach et al31
reported that 59% of participants presented with some pelvic or
abdominal symptom as a chief presenting symptom. Both studies
reported a high prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (39% and
47%).30,31 Gutman et al30 reported the sensitivity and specificity
of thin, homogeneous discharge as 78.8% (95% CI, 70.3%-
85.8%) and 53.9% (95% CI, 46.3%-61.4%), respectively (PPV,
51.9% [95% CI, 44.1%-59.6%] and NPV, 80.2% [95% CI, 72.0%-
86.8%]) (Table 4). Eschenbach et al31 reported the sensitivity and
specificity of homogeneous discharge as 69.2% (95% CI, 63.4%-
74.5%) and 97.2% (95% CI, 94.9%-98.6%), respectively (PPV,
95.3% [95% CI, 91.7%-97.7%]; NPV, 79.0% [95% CI, 74.8%-
82.8%]).
Genital Herpes (Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 or Type 2)
No screening studies were conducted solely in asymptomatic pri-
mary care populations. One fair-quality trial by Koutsky et al
(n = 779)32 provided data on the accuracy of specific pelvic
examination findings in detecting this condition. The study

recruited nonpregnant women aged 16 to 50 years from the
same population seen in the STI clinic for the bacterial vaginosis
study by Eschenbach et al31 and for the trichomoniasis study by
Wølner-Hansson et al33 (Table 3). All pelvic examinations were
performed by 1 “women’
s health care specialist.”Mean age was 24
years, and 70% of participants were white. Almost all patients
were sexually active (98%). Condoms were used as the primary
method of contraception by 7%, and 33% did not use any contra-
ception. Of the participants, 10% were symptomatic. The index
test was a “
genital examination”(colposcopy findings were not
considered for this review). A positive pelvic examination result
was defined as clinician-detected lesions, and only vulvar ulcer-
ations and tender inguinal nodes were used in this review for
accuracy calculations. All patients received the reference test,
which included cultures from urine, cervical swabs, anal swabs,
and any lesion swabs (all herpes simplex virus [HSV] isolates were
confirmed and typed by direct immunofluorescence with use of
mouse monoclonal antibodies), as well as serum testing for HSV-1
or HSV-2 antibodies using Western blotting.
Nearly half (48%) of all study participants were diagnosed with
genital herpes at some stage of the disease: 6% were diagnosed at
the first episode, 5% had symptomatic recurrence, 2% had asymp-
tomatic shedding, and 35% had latent HSV-2 infection (defined as
HSV-2 antibodies present without signs or symptoms). Of those
with any stage of genital herpes, 78% had latent disease. The pres-
ence of vulvar ulcerations had a sensitivity of 19.6% (95% CI,
15.8%-23.9%) and specificity of 97.5% (95% CI, 95.7%-98.7%) in
detecting genital HSV at any stage (PPV, 88.0% [95% CI, 79.7%-
93.6%]; NPV, 57.0% [95% CI, 53.3%-60.7%]) (Table 4). Similarly,
the presence of tender inguinal lymphadenopathy had a sensitivity
of 14.2% (95% CI, 11.0%-18.1%) and specificity of 97.1% (95% CI,
95.1%-98.4%) (PPV, 81.5% [95% CI, 70.8%-89.5%]; NPV, 55.3%
[95% CI, 51.7%-58.9%]).32
Trichomoniasis
There were no screening studies conducted solely in asymp-
tomatic primary care populations. One fair-quality trial by
Wølner-Hanssen et al (n = 779)33 was set in the same STI clinic as
the trials by Eschenbach et al31 and Koutsky et al,32 with a high
proportion of symptomatic patients aimed to analyze the clinical
manifestations of trichomoniasis and determined the accuracy of
specific clinical findings on pelvic examination in detecting tricho-
moniasis (Table 3). An abnormal pelvic examination finding was
defined as clinician-reported moderate to markedly increased
vaginal discharge compared with that seen in patients without
genital infections. The reference test for identifying trichomonia-
sis was culture. At least half of the patients reported symptoms of
yellow discharge (23%), abnormal vaginal odor (36%), or vulvar
itching (51%). The prevalence of culture-confirmed trichomonia-
sis was 15%. For the most specific clinical sign, colpitis macularis
or “strawberry cervix”(detected grossly, without a colposcope),
sensitivity was 1.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-5.3%) and specificity was
100.0% (95% CI, 99.6%-100.0%) (PPV, 100.0% [95% CI, 33.3%-
100.0%]; NPV, 85.1% [95% CI, 82.4%-87.4%]) (Table 4). For
other individual clinical findings, sensitivity ranged from 8.0%
(95% CI, 3.8%-14.5%) to 59.2% (95% CI, 49.3%-68.5%) and
specificity from 76.1% (72.4%-79.5%) to 99.1% (98.1%-99.7%);
PPVs ranged from 30.2% (95% CI, 24.0%-37.0%) to 61.5%

Harms of Screening
Key Question 3. What are the adverse effects of screening by pel-
vic examination?
All accuracy studies (8 studies) were included for harms (false-
positiveratesandresultingdiagnosticworkup),and1additionalstudy
was included for other harms.
Ovarian Cancer
Additional imaging and unnecessary surgical intervention are
potential harms of pelvic examination screening for ovarian cancer.
The prevalence of laparoscopy or laparotomy for those with abnor-
mal findings on pelvic examination ranged from 5% to 36%.19,25-27
In the Greek study,26 17% of women with abnormal pelvic examina-
tion results underwent surgery because of the results. Pathology
findings revealed 2 cases of ovarian cancer (1 metastatic, 1 stage Ia
serous cystadenocarcinoma), 4 serous cystadenomas, 3 mucinous

cystadenomas, 5 endometroid cysts of the ovary, 12 benign
cysts, and 3 normal pathology results.26 In the Australian study,27
2 women (5%) with abnormal findings on pelvic examination had
surgery. The operations revealed that 1 patient had a fibroid uterus
and 1 a normal (negative) result; the single case of ovarian cancer
was not detected on pelvic examination.27 In the UK study that
recruited solely postmenopausal women,25 36% of women with an
abnormal pelvic examination result underwent surgery based on
the pelvic examination result: 1 woman had ovarian cancer, and 9
had benign conditions.25 In the PLCO trial, the surgery rate occur-
ring subsequent to an ovarian palpation examination with abnor-
mal findings was 11% over up to 4 rounds of screening (mean, 2.4
ovarian pelvic palpation examinations per woman), with a compli-
cation rate of 1%; additional ultrasounds, CA-125 measurements,
pelvic examinations, and computed tomography scans occurring
subsequent to an ovarian palpation examination with abnormal
findings are reported in Table 5.
Bacterial Vaginosis
False-positive and false-negative rates for thin homogeneous dis-
charge were 46.1% (95% CI, 38.6%-53.7%) and 21.2% (95% CI,
14.2%-29.7%), respectively.30 Eschenbach et al31 reported that
false-positive and false-negative rates for homogeneous dis-
charge were 2.8% (95% CI, 1.4%-5.1%) and 30.8% (95% CI,
25.5%-36.6%), respectively (Table 4).
Genital Herpes (HSV-1 or HSV-2)
False-positive and false-negative rates for vulvar ulcerations were
2.5% (95% CI, 1.3%-4.3%) and 80.4% (95% CI, 76.1%-84.2%),
respectively, for any stage of genital herpes. False-positive and
false-negative rates for tender inguinal lymphadenopathy were
2.9% (95% CI, 1.6%-4.9%) and 85.8% (95% CI, 81.9%-89.0%),
respectively, for any stage of genital herpes (Table 4).32
Trichomoniasis
False-positive and false-negative rates for colpitis macularis were
0% (95% CI, 0%-0.4%) and 98.3% (95% CI, 94.7%-99.6%),
respectively (Table 4).33 False-positive and false-negative rates
for purulent discharge were 23.9% (95% CI, 20.5%-27.6%) and
40.8% (95% CI, 31.5%-50.7%), respectively.
Other Harms
Beyond the downstream diagnostic workup and surgical proce-
dures resulting from the pelvic examination for ovarian cancer
screening and the false-positive rates and missed cases from
accuracy studies, 1 additional small, poor-to-fair–quality 4-week
prospective cohort study with high attrition (49%) reported an
association between the pelvic examination and subsequent
development of urinary symptoms (dysuria [11/63 vs 6/87;
P < .01] and urinary frequency [17/63 vs 12/87; P < .01]).35 Further
research is needed, in larger studies with urine culture–confirmed
urinary tract infection as the outcome, to confirm or disprove this
potential harm.
Discussion
An overall summary of the evidence is presented in Table 6. There
is no direct evidence examining the overall effectiveness of the
pelvic examination in improving health outcomes for any of the
gynecologic conditions included in this review. Cervical cancer,
gonorrhea, and chlamydia were not included because other effec-
tive screening tests are already recommended for these
conditions.5,6 Despite the many diseases that are plausibly detect-
able or that physicians cite as important to detect with routine
screening pelvic examinations,36,37 this systematic review identi-
fied diagnostic accuracy studies for only 1 cancerous condition
(ovarian cancer) and 3 infectious conditions (bacterial vaginosis,
HSV, and trichomoniasis). The limited evidence identified on the
accuracy of the screening pelvic examination for detecting any
single gynecologic condition and the overall conclusion of its rela-
tively low PPV for ovarian cancer are consistent with other sys-
tematic reviews17,18 and are not surprising, given that ovarian can-
cer is rare (approximately 12 cases per 100 000 women).38 Prior
cross-sectional studies have shown that even under circumstances
optimal for accurate disease detection (ie, patients examined pre-
operatively under anesthesia, all with some pelvic abnormality as
indication for surgery, examination performed by attending physi-
cians), the accuracy of the pelvic examination for detecting pelvic
masses is low.39,40 Performance of the examination is notably
worse when performed by inexperienced examiners and in

component in the screening intervention group, the number of
palpation screening visits women completed was variable. On average,

patients who are obese or have enlarged uteri.39-42 To our knowl-
edge, this review is the first systematic review to include accuracy
data from the large PLCO trial confirming the very low sensitivity
of ovarian palpation for the detection of ovarian cancer and esti-
mating an 11% surgery rate resulting from abnormal examination
findings.
The 4 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy for infectious dis-
eases in high-risk settings (STI clinics or populations with high rates
of symptoms) likely overestimate the accuracy obtained when pel-
vic examinations are administered to average-risk, asymptomatic
primary care populations. Although the sensitivity of the pelvic
examination was generally low for detecting a single condition
(eg, ovarian cancer or bacterial vaginosis), on the basis of current
evidence it is not possible to estimate the value of the screening
pelvic examination to detect any of a host of conditions that might
be found before symptomatic clinical presentation. In the absence
of trials and test accuracy data on summary performance of screen-
ing pelvic examinations, clinical guidance could be informed by epi-
demiologic evidence to estimate the burden of single conditions,
biological plausibility of early detection using the pelvic examina-
tion, treatability of the disease at earlier stages, and the presence of
alternative, superior screening approaches.
The role of the annual or periodic screening pelvic examina-
tion is controversial.9,43-47 There are concerns that scrutiny of
the accuracy of screening pelvic examination is misdirected,
as the benefit of other routinely provided physical examination
components (eg, heart and lung auscultation screening) in the
context of screening is similarly lacking.44 Rather than viewing
the examination as a screening test, this perspective suggests a
broader clinical purpose, including to facilitate discussion of sensi-
tive topics that would otherwise not be discussed.47 On the other
hand, the screening pelvic examination can cause anxiety and dis-
comfort and could pose unnecessary barriers to care,48 particu-
larly in certain subpopulations of women (eg, those with a history
of sexual abuse49-51).
Women’
s preventive care is provided by clinicians with
diverse training and professional orientations, and the type of cli-
nician can influence the comprehensiveness of primary care.52-56
In the face of changing clinical practice with respect to cervical
cancer screening frequency and new pelvic examination screen-
ing recommendations from professional organizations,14,57 long-
standing patterns of women’
s primary health care delivery may
be altered. Research into the benefits or unintended conse-
quences of different screening pelvic examination guidelines,
ranging from recommendations against their provision14 to rec-
ommendations for shared decision making, is needed.15,57
Patients’expectations and preferences for pelvic examination
also warrant investigation, as it is not clear how shared decision
making may change current clinical screening practices. Regard-
less of recommendations for screening pelvic examinations, it has
been noted that women may wish to have an annual gynecologi-
cal visit to ensure a full spectrum of preventive care.56
Limitations
This review included English-language studies only, consistent
with the USPSTF methods.16 This review excluded conditions
such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and cervical cancer, given that
there are more accurate, alternative screening modalities for
these conditions. Otherwise, despite having broad search terms
to ensure an exhaustive literature search, the review identified
little evidence to address the key questions.
Conclusions
No direct evidence was identified for overall benefits and harms
of the pelvic examination as a 1-time or periodic screening test.
Limited evidence was identified regarding the diagnostic accu-
racy and harms of routine screening pelvic examinations in
asymptomatic primary care populations.
