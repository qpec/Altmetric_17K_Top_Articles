V
aginal birth after cesarean delivery is increasingly conten-
tious as rates of cesarean delivery rise and prior cesarean 
delivery serves as the most common single indication for 
a cesarean delivery. Planning mode of delivery for women with a 
previous cesarean delivery is challenging both for the patient and 
the care provider. An elective repeat cesarean delivery is associ-
ated with an increased risk of surgical complications, as well as an 
increased risk of abnormal placentation in subsequent pregnan-
cies.1–11 On the other hand, attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
delivery is associated with a higher risk of uterine rupture and 
other maternal and infant complications.1–11 In addition, a sub-
stantial proportion of women attempting a vaginal birth after 
cesarean delivery will require an emergency cesarean delivery,7,10 
which increases the risk of maternal and infant complications.11
Historically, rates of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery in 
Canada and the United States increased in the 1980s and early 
1990s after endorsements by various groups including the Soci-
ety of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, and the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.12–17 How-
ever, studies in the mid-1990s, which showed high rates of severe 
maternal and infant morbidity associated with vaginal birth after 
cesarean delivery, resulted in cautionary guidelines from the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 1998 and 
1999, and subsequent declines in rates of vaginal birth after 
cesarean delivery.1,2,18,19 The National Institutes of Health Consen-
sus Development Conference Panel summarized the risks and 
benefits associated with vaginal birth after cesarean delivery in 
2010, and in 2013, the American College of Obstetrics and Gyne-
cology stated that most women with 1 previous cesarean deliv-
ery could be considered candidates for vaginal birth.9,20 Rates of 
vaginal birth after cesarean delivery have begun to increase 
again in the US from a low of about 8.4% of all births in 2008 and 
2009 to 11.3% in 2014.21 In British Columbia, Canada, the propor-
tion of women with a previous cesarean delivery who were 
deemed eligible for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery 
increased from 75% in 2010 to 80% in 2014.22

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The mode of delivery for 
women with a previous cesarean deliv-
ery remains contentious. We conducted 
a study comparing maternal and infant 
outcomes after attempted vaginal birth 
after cesarean delivery versus elective 
repeat cesarean delivery.
METHODS: We used data from the Dis-
charge Abstract Database that includes all 
hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding 
Quebec). In our analysis, we included sin-
gleton deliveries to women between 
 
37 and 43 weeks gestation who had a sin-
gle prior cesarean delivery between 
April 2003 and March 2015. The primary 
outcomes were severe maternal morbid-
ity and mortality, and serious neonatal 
morbidity and mortality. We used logistic 
regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios 
(RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Absolute rates of severe 
maternal morbidity and mortality were 
low but significantly higher after 
attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
delivery compared with elective repeat 
cesarean delivery (10.7 v. 5.65 per 1000 
deliveries, respectively; adjusted RR 1.96, 
95% CI 1.76 to 2.19). Adjusted rate differ-
ences in severe maternal morbidity and 
mortality, and serious neonatal morbid-
ity and mortality were small (5.42 and 
7.09 per 1000 deliveries, respectively; 
number needed to treat 184 and 141, 
respectively). The association between 
vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, and 
serious neonatal morbidity and mortality 
showed a temporal worsening (adjusted 
RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.15 in 2003–2005; 
adjusted RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.83 to 2.35 in 
2012–2014).
INTERPRETATION: Although absolute 
rates of adverse outcomes are low, 
attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
 
delivery continues to be associated with 
higher relative rates of severe morbidity 
and mortality in mothers and infants. 
Temporal worsening of infant outcomes 
after attempted vaginal birth after cesar-
ean delivery highlights the need for greater 
care in selecting candidates, and more 
careful monitoring of labour and delivery.

It is important to monitor population rates of maternal and 
infant adverse outcomes after attempted vaginal birth after 
cesarean delivery because a uterine scar is a strong risk factor for 
uterine rupture. We conducted a study to assess whether con-
temporary obstetrical care has improved maternal and infant 
outcomes after attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery.
Methods
Setting and design
We conducted a retrospective cohort study, with all hospital 
deliveries to women in Canada between April 2003 and March 
2015 serving as the source population.
Study population
For the primary analysis, we restricted the study population to 
women with a parity of 1, a previous cesarean delivery (ensuring 
that all women had only 1 previous cesarean delivery) and, in the 
current pregnancy, a singleton delivery at 37 to 43 weeks gesta-
tion. The comparison of interest was between elective repeat 
cesarean delivery and attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
delivery. We also conducted analyses that compared outcomes 
in women who had an elective repeat cesarean delivery with 
those in women who had a successful or failed vaginal birth after 
cesarean delivery to obtain insight into the mechanisms underly-
ing potential differences in outcomes. Definitions of different 
modes of delivery, and the diagnostic and procedure codes used 
are provided in Appendix 1, supplementary Table 1, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170371/-/DC1.
Data sources
We obtained data for the study from the Discharge Abstract 
Database of the Canadian Institute for Health Information. This 
database, which contains records for about 98% of all deliveries 
in Canada (excluding Quebec), is based on information that is 
routinely abstracted from medical charts by trained personnel 
using standardized definitions and processes.23 The abstracted 
information includes details regarding maternal and infant char-
acteristics, labour and delivery, and diagnoses and procedures. 
All diagnoses during the study period were coded using the 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related 
Health Problems, 10th revision, Canadian version, whereas pro-
cedures were coded using the Canadian Classification of Health 
Interventions. The validity of the perinatal information in the 
Discharge Abstract Database has been assessed previously and 
found to be accurate.24,25
Outcomes
The primary maternal outcome was composite severe maternal 
morbidity and mortality, which included severe postpartum 
hemorrhage (i.e., postpartum hemorrhage requiring blood trans-
fusion, cesarean hysterectomy, hysterectomy or procedures to 
control bleeding such as ligation or embolization of pelvic ves-
sels, and B-lynch suture of the uterus), disseminated intravascu-
lar coagulation, cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 
acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pulmonary edema, 
cardiac complications from anesthesia, assisted ventilation, 
adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute or unspecified renal 
failure, repair of injury to the bladder or urethra and maternal 
death.26,27 We also evaluated a second composite maternal out-
come, restricted severe maternal morbidity and mortality, which 
included the same components except for postpartum hemor-
rhage requiring blood transfusion (the most common severe 
morbidity). We also assessed the following maternal outcomes: 
 
uterine rupture (including and excluding dehiscence of the uter-
ine scar) and postpartum hemorrhage that required blood trans-
fusion, procedures to control bleeding or hysterectomy.
The primary infant outcome was composite severe neonatal 
morbidity and mortality, which included neonatal seizures, any 
assisted ventilation (including assisted ventilation requiring 
endotracheal intubation or continuous positive airway pressure) 
and neonatal death.28,29 We also evaluated a second composite 
neonatal outcome that included neonatal death, neonatal sei-
zures and assisted ventilation requiring endotracheal intubation 
(excluding assisted ventilation requiring continuous positive air-
way pressure). We also evaluated the following outcomes: neo-
natal death, assisted ventilation, neonatal seizures and respira-
tory distress syndrome. 
Infant outcomes were evaluated after we restricted the 
population to infants without congenital anomalies.
Statistical analysis
The comparisons in maternal and infant outcomes between the 
groups of interest were quantified using rates, rate ratios (RRs) 
and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with women who had elective 
repeat cesarean deliveries as the reference group. Logistic mod-
els included maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and 
labour induction. We calculated adjusted rate differences from 
the absolute outcome rates for the elective repeat cesarean 
delivery group and adjusted RRs for attempted vaginal birth after 
cesarean delivery group, which we used to compute the number 
needed to treat (NNT).  We evaluated temporal changes in mater-
nal and infant effects from attempted vaginal birth after cesar-
ean delivery by comparing adjusted RRs in early and later study 
periods (2003–2005 v. 2012–2014). We tested modification of the 
effect of attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (on com-
posite maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality) by year 
using interaction terms.
We repeated these analyses for all women who had a previous 
cesarean delivery (i.e., without restriction by parity). We also 
conducted post hoc sensitivity analyses in women at 40 weeks 
gestation or more to address potential misclassification of elec-
tive repeat cesarean and attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
 
delivery (because women planning an elective repeat cesarean 
delivery would have had this procedure before 40 wk). We used a 
2-sided p value less than 0.05 to guide inference. All analyses 
were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute).
Ethics approval
The study was based on anonymized data and conducted under 
the surveillance mandate of the Public Health Agency of Canada, 
and ethics approval was not required.

Results
The source population included 3 047 401 women who delivered 
between 2003 and 2014. There were 197 540 women with a parity of 
1 and a previous cesarean delivery who had a singleton delivery at 
37 to 43 weeks gestation in the current pregnancy. Of these 
women, 77 426 (39.2%) were 30 to 34 years of age, 7026 (3.6%) had 
hypertension, 1510 (0.8%) had diabetes mellitus and 7307 (3.7%) 
had labour induction (Table 1). Women who had an elective repeat 
cesarean delivery were older and had slightly higher rates of 
hypertension and diabetes mellitus than women who delivered 
after an attempted vaginal birth after cesarean  delivery. The 
attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rate was 32.8% 
(7733/23 565) in 2003–2004, decreased to 28.2% (9633/34 205) in 
2007–2008 and then increased to 31.4% (11 636/37 070) in 2013–
2014. Among women who attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
delivery, success rates declined from 50.2% (1689/3368) in 2003 to 
47.8% (2347/4909) in 2008, before increasing to 50.8% (2987/5878) 
in 2014 (Appendix 2, supplementary Figure 1A, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170371/-/DC1).
Table 2 shows rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortal-
ity after elective repeat cesarean delivery and attempted vaginal 
birth after cesarean delivery in the study population. Women 
who had an attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery had 
significantly higher rates of uterine rupture, severe postpartum 
hemorrhage and composite severe maternal morbidity and mor-
tality compared to women who had an elective repeat cesarean 
delivery. The adjusted RR for composite severe maternal morbid-
ity and mortality among women who had an attempted vaginal 
birth after cesarean delivery was 1.96 (95% CI 1.76 to 2.19) and 
6.41 (95% CI 4.84 to 8.50) for uterine rupture (not including dehis-
cence). Analyses stratified by success/failure of the vaginal birth 
after cesarean delivery attempt showed that women who had a 
successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery had significantly 
lower rates of restricted severe maternal morbidity and mortality 
(adjusted RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.73), whereas women with a 
failed vaginal birth after cesarean delivery had substantially 
higher rates (adjusted RR 2.58, 95% CI 2.25 to 2.95).
Rates of severe neonatal morbidity and mortality followed a 
mostly similar pattern, with rates of composite severe neonatal 
morbidity and mortality being significantly higher among women 
who delivered after an attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
delivery compared with those delivering by elective repeat cesar-
ean (adjusted RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.61; Table 3). Rates of neo-
natal seizures and assisted ventilation were significantly higher, 
whereas rates of neonatal death were nonsignificantly higher 
among women who delivered after an attempted vaginal birth 
after cesarean delivery. However, rates of neonatal respiratory 
distress syndrome were significantly lower among women deliv-
ering after an attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery 
(adjusted RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.94). Women with a successful 
vaginal birth after cesarean delivery had significantly lower rates

mortality in 2003–2005 (adjusted RR 0.94, 95% CI 
0.77 to 1.15), whereas this association was sig-
nificant in 2012–2014 (adjusted RR 2.07, 95% CI 
1.83 to 2.35; p value for difference in rate 
ratios < 0.05). The interaction term between 
attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery 
and year was significant for the neonatal morbid-
ity outcomes (p = 0.36 for composite severe 
maternal morbidity, p < 0.001 for composite seri-
ous neonatal morbidity and p < 0.001 for respira-
tory distress syndrome; Appendix 2).
We found that analyses conducted for all 
women with a previous cesarean delivery 
showed essentially the same results (Appen-
dix 1, supplementary Tables 1–6) with slight 
attenuation in adjusted RRs. Sensitivity analy-
ses that were restricted to women at 40 weeks 
or more gestation also showed similar results 
for maternal outcomes (Appendix 1, supple-
mentary Table 7) and significantly larger effects 
for neonatal outcomes (Appendix 1, supple-
mentary Table 8). The adjusted RR expressing 
the association between attempted vaginal 
birth after cesarean delivery and severe neona-
tal morbidity and mortality, which was 1.49 
(95% CI 1.38 to 1.61) in the primary analysis, 
was 2.37 (95% CI 1.91 to 2.96) in this sensitivity 
analysis (difference in RRs p < 0.05).
Interpretation
Our study showed that absolute rates of severe 
maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality 
were low among women who attempted a vagi-
nal birth after cesarean delivery and those who 
had an elective repeat cesarean delivery. How-
ever, relative rates of severe maternal and seri-
ous neonatal morbidity and mortality were sub-
stantially higher following attempted vaginal 
birth after cesarean delivery. Perhaps the most 
concerning finding was the temporal change in 
the effect of attempted vaginal birth after cesar-
ean delivery on infant outcomes: severe neona-
tal morbidity and mortality rates were not signif-
icantly different following an attempted vaginal 
birth after cesarean delivery in 2003–2005, 
whereas such morbidity and mortality was 
2-fold higher following an attempted vaginal 
birth after cesarean delivery in 2012–2014.
Although the number of women with a previ-
ous cesarean delivery increased from 2003 to 
2014, rates of attempted vaginal birth after 
cesarean delivery and rates of success after a 
trial of labour were essentially unchanged. These 
stable rates likely conceal substantial changes in 
attitudes toward attempted vaginal birth after

pregnant and health care providers. In 1998, the American College 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that vaginal 
birth after cesarean delivery be attempted only in well-equipped 
hospitals with “ready availability” emergency care.15 This ready 
availability terminology gave way to “immediate availability of

position about the need for specialized services: in 2005, the Soci-
ety of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommended 
that vaginal birth after cesarean deliveries be done in hospitals 
where a timely cesarean delivery was possible.30
Evidence related to attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
delivery and the changes to the guidelines mentioned previously 
likely explains the finding of no association between attempted 
vaginal birth after cesarean delivery and severe neonatal morbidity 
and mortality in 2003–2005. A seminal study showing a near 2-fold 
increase in major maternal complications after a trial of labour was 
published in 1996,1 another study showing an 11-fold increase in 
perinatal death was published in 2002,23 and a third study showing 
higher rates of maternal and infant complications was published in 
2004.24 The climate of concern created by these studies likely 
affected the selection of candidates and labour management for 
attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery and ensured better 
perinatal outcomes during 2003–2005. The increase in the adverse 
effects for attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery more 
recently may indicate a less rigorous approach to selection of can-
didates and management of attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
delivery. A reduction in the availability of obstetricians with exper-
tise in vaginal birth after cesarean delivery and temporal changes in 
maternal characteristics are other possibilities.
The evaluation and interpretation of risks associated with 
attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery presents a chal-
lenge because risk perspectives vary widely. Both the relative 
increase in rates of severe maternal and neonatal morbidity and 
mortality after attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery 
compared with elective repeat cesarean delivery and the abso-
lute difference in these rates need to be weighed carefully before 
a decision is made about whether the excess risks are acceptable 
or high. In additional, women planning large families need to be 
cognizant of the risks of morbid placentation in subsequent 
pregnancies, because such risks increase with repeated cesarean 
deliveries.9 These inputs into decision-making may also be 
affected by desire for vaginal birth, the severity of the outcomes 
in question and other personal valuations. Health care providers 
need to help women to contextualize risks better so that they are 
able to make informed and personalized decisions.
Limitations
The limitations of our study include reliance on data from a large 
perinatal database, which may contain some transcription and 
other errors. Although codes for major diagnoses and procedures 
in our data source have been validated and found to be accurate, 
misclassification of some women scheduled for elective repeat 
cesarean delivery is possible. However, this would have served to 
minimize differences between elective repeat cesarean delivery 
and attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, and sensitiv-
ity analyses restricted to women at 40 weeks or more gestation 
support this assumption.
Conclusion
Attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery is associated 
with low absolute rates of severe maternal and infant morbidity 
and mortality, although relative rates of such adverse outcomes 
are higher than for elective repeat cesarean delivery. Temporal 
trends in the effects of attempted vaginal birth after cesarean 
delivery on serious neonatal morbidity and mortality have shown 
a concerning increase in recent years, and further study is 
required to identify the cause of this unexpected development. 
Attempts at ensuring the safety of attempted vaginal birth after 
cesarean delivery must continue to focus on appropriate selec-
tion of candidates and careful monitoring of labour and delivery 
among women with a previous cesarean delivery.
