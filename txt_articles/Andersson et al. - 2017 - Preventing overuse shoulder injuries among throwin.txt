 ABSTRACT 
Objective  To evaluate the effect of a comprehensive exercise program designed to reduce 
the prevalence of shoulder problems in elite handball. 
Design  Stratified cluster-randomised controlled trial with teams as the unit of 
randomisation. 
Setting  45 handball teams (22 female, 23 male) from the two upper divisions in Norway (22 
in the intervention group, 23 in the control group) were followed for one competitive season 
(7 months). 
Participants  660 players aged 16-47 (331 in the intervention group, 329 in the control 
group). 
Intervention  Ten-minute comprehensive exercise program to increase glenohumeral 
internal rotation, external rotation strength and scapular control, as well as improve kinetic 
chain and thoracic mobility, to be delivered by coaches and team captains three times per 
week as a part of the handball warm-up throughout the season. 
Main outcome measures  Prevalence of shoulder problems and substantial shoulder 
problems. 
Results  The average prevalence of shoulder problems during the season was 17% (95% CI: 
16% to 19%) in the intervention group and 23% (95% CI: 21% to 26%) in the control group 
(mean difference: 6%). The average prevalence of substantial shoulder problems was 5% 
(95% CI: 4% to 6%) in the intervention group and 8% (95% CI: 7% to 9%) in the control group 
(mean difference: 3%). Using generalized estimating equation models, a 28% lower risk of 
shoulder problems (OR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.98, p=0.038) and 22% lower risk of substantial 
shoulder problems (OR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.53 to 1.16, p=0.23) was observed in the intervention 
group compared to the control group. 
Conclusion  A comprehensive exercise program reduced the prevalence of shoulder 
problems in elite handball.

 INTRODUCTION 
Shoulder injuries, predominantly from overuse, have been reported to be highly prevalent in 
a wide variety of throwing sports,3-14 where the shoulder is exposed to large demands due to 
repeated overhead motion at high velocity.1 2 Thrower’s shoulder is a widely used term, 
referring to a range of different symptoms commonly experienced by throwers, as well as a 
range of pathologies observed in their dominant shoulder.1 2 15 The main symptom is deep 
shoulder pain, often difficult to localize. Symptoms often occur in the late cocking phase of 
the throwing motion, when the glenohumeral joint is abducted and external rotated. Painful 
clicking and catching can also be present during the throwing motion, in addition to reduced 
velocity and accuracy of the throw. Symptom onset is in most conditions gradual.1 2 15 
 
Several studies have investigated internal modifiable risk factors for shoulder injury among 
throwing athletes. Reduced glenohumeral joint range of motion, weakness in glenohumeral 
external rotation and low ratios of external to internal rotation strength have been linked to 
injury among both baseball and handball players.3-6 16-21 Reduction in glenohumeral 
abduction strength has been associated with shoulder injury among baseball pitchers,6 and 
recently scapular dyskinesis was linked to injury among elite male handball players.3 In 
addition, reduced kinetic chain function and limited thoracic mobility are commonly 
proposed risk factors, although there is a lack of evidence associating them with shoulder 
injury.22 23 
 
There are no randomised controlled trials targeting prevention of overuse shoulder injuries 
in elite throwing athletes.24 Thus, the main objective of this randomised controlled trial was 
to evaluate the effect of a comprehensive exercise program designed to reduce the 
prevalence of shoulder problems, using handball as a model. 
METHODS 
Study design and participants 
This was a two-armed cluster-randomised controlled trial. During the off-season (June to 
July 2014) we invited every male and female handball team (n=48) in the two top divisions in 
 Norway to participate in the study. Of these, 46 teams agreed to participate and were 
randomised by team into an intervention or control group, stratified by gender and 
competition level. A neutral, blinded person who had no further involvement in the study 
conducted the randomisation after the final team had been recruited. 
 
We visited each team (n=46) during a training session in the pre-season (August to mid 
September 2014) and invited every player present to participate in the study. All players 
with a team contract were eligible for participation, irrespective of their baseline injury 
status or history (N=677). Players who consented to participate completed baseline 
questionnaires and were followed for the duration of the regular season (September 2014 
through March 2015). Six times during the season, players reported any shoulder problems 
using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) Overuse Injury Questionnaire,25 as 
described in a previous study on risk factors for shoulder problems among male elite 
handball players.3 During our baseline visit, we instructed teams in the intervention group 
on how to use the prevention program, to be implemented the subsequent week. We asked 
control teams to warm up as usual. Player participation was voluntary and we obtained 
written informed consent. 
Baseline questionnaires 
We registered demographic and anthropometric data, dominant arm, playing position and 
number of years as an active handball player. Players reported history of shoulder pain and 
current shoulder pain using a modified version of the Fahlström questionnaire, previously 
used in studies on elite handball players.3 7 Players reported acute shoulder injuries within 
the last six months and shoulder surgery within the last 12 months. This information was 
crosschecked with the team medical staff. Finally, we asked them to report any shoulder 
problems during the previous weeks using the OSTRC Overuse Injury Questionnaire.25 
Intervention 
We created a preliminary version of the comprehensive exercise program based on risk 
factors for shoulder problems identified among elite handball players.3 17 21 An expert panel 
consisting of a fitness coach employed by the Norwegian Handball Federation and four 
physiotherapists working with handball players nationally and internationally reviewed the 
 program. A female handball team in a lower division, not included in the study, tested the 
program and responded to a questionnaire based on the RE-AIM framework to provide 
information regarding their beliefs and experiences of content, duration, load and 
applicability of the program.26 27 
 
The final version of the OSTRC Shoulder Injury Prevention Program consisted of five 
exercises with different variations and levels, aiming at reducing the prevalence of shoulder 
problems by increasing glenohumeral internal range of motion, external rotation strength 
and scapula control. In addition, exercises to improve the kinetic chain and thoracic mobility 
were included, based on recommendations from the expert panel. Examples of exercises 
included in the program are illustrated in figure 1. Detailed information on the prevention 
program is available as an online appendix. 
 
Figure 1 
 
Players in the intervention group were targets for the prevention program and coaches and 
team captains were delivery agents. We recommended implementing the program as a part 
of the team’s regular warm-up, before any throwing activity. We emphasised the quality of 
movement, correct positioning of the scapula, centralisation of the head of the humerus in 
the glenoid, good posture and core stability. Teams received posters of the program, as well 
as the equipment needed. Team medical staff supervised the quality of the exercises and 
ensured that players experiencing pain conducted the exercises correctly and with the 
correct load. If a team did not have their own medical staff, we recruited a physiotherapist. 
We completed follow-up visits to all teams in the prevention group during the mid-season 
(December 2015 through January 2016) to supervise exercise quality, answer questions and 
encourage them to complete the program as recommended. Once players were familiar 
with the exercises, the program took about 10 min to complete. 
Monitoring of shoulder problems 
The OSTRC Overuse Injury Questionnaire was sent electronically by mail to all players in the 
study the last Sunday of each month from October 2014 through March 2015, six times in 
total, using online survey software (Questback V. 9692, Questback AS, Oslo, Norway). 
 Automatic reminders were sent to non-responders after three and seven days per email and 
SMS (Pling, Front Information DA, Oslo, Norway). In addition, we visited teams throughout 
the season to ensure a high response rate by asking non-responders to complete the 
questionnaire on paper. The questionnaire gathers information on to which extent overuse 
shoulder injuries, expressed as shoulder problems, affect participation, training volume and 
performance, as well as the level of shoulder pain experienced during the past week. Players 
were only asked about their dominant shoulder, with shoulder problems defined as any 
pain, ache, stiffness, instability, looseness or other complaints related to their shoulder.25 In 
addition, players reported any acute injury to the dominant shoulder during the past week, 
defined as an injury caused by a single, identifiable event.28 29 Team medical staff also 
reported any acute shoulder injury by mail at the end of each month (October 2014 to 
March 2015) and their records were crosschecked with player reports to avoid misreporting 
of an acute shoulder injury as an overuse injury. Acute injuries were excluded from the 
analyses. 
Outcome measures 
Primary outcomes were the prevalence of shoulder problems and substantial shoulder 
problems in the dominant arm, as measured six times during the season. We calculated the 
prevalence of shoulder problems in both groups by dividing the number of players who 
reported any problem (i.e. anything but the minimum value in any of the four questions) by 
the number of questionnaire respondents.25 To filter problems with fewer functional 
consequences, we calculated the prevalence of substantial shoulder problems in the same 
way, but only including shoulder problems leading to moderate or severe reductions in 
training volume or performance, or a total inability to participate.25 Secondary outcome was 
the severity score of shoulder problems reported during the season. The severity score 
ranged from 0 to 100 and was calculated on the basis of the four questions in the OSTRC 
Overuse Injury Questionnaire for every player reporting a shoulder problem.25 The severity 
scores for all players were summed and divided by the number of respondents. In addition, 
we calculated the relative impact of shoulder problems in both groups by summing player 
severity scores during the season and dividing by the total number of responses. 
 Compliance 
We monitored to which degree the players in the prevention group completed the 
prevention program according to our recommendations through self-reporting. Six times 
during the season, players reported how many times they had completed the program 
during the last seven days, both with the team and by themselves. The total number of 
sessions completed was summed and divided by the number of respondents to calculate the 
average weekly compliance with the program for each measure. 
Exposure 
Players reported their exposure to handball training, match play and additional strength 
training six times during the season. We calculated the average weekly exposure to handball 
training, match play and strength training (minutes) for each measure in both groups by 
summing up the number of minutes reported and dividing by the number of respondents. 
Player involvement 
No players were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor 
were they involved in developing plans for recruitment or design. No players were asked to 
advise on interpretation or writing up of results. We will disseminate the program and 
results of the study directly to athletes and coaches using digital tools such as our free Get 
Set - Train Smarter smartphone application and corresponding injury prevention website. In 
addition, the results will be disseminated through national and international sports 
governing bodies (The International Olympic Committee and relevant International 
Federations).  
Sample size 
We estimated the sample size on the basis of the average prevalence of shoulder problems 
(28%) and substantial shoulder problems (12%) reported in a prospective risk factor study of 
shoulder problems among male elite handball players.3 We adjusted for cluster correlations 
(estimated ICC <0.1) based on ANOVA of within-subject and within-team prevalence, and 
assumed that we could include 15 players from each of the 48 available teams (n=720). 
Based on this, we estimated to be able to detect a 10% reduction in the prevalence of 
 shoulder problems with a power of 0.94, and a 6% reduction with a power of 0.87, at a 5% 
significance level. 
Statistical methods 
A priori, we set three responses to the OSTRC Overuse Injury Questionnaire as a minimum to 
include a player in the analyses. Initial data analyses showed that player response to the 
questionnaire was sufficient to estimate missing values using multiple imputations. We 
performed multiple imputations with the assumption of missing at random and used 
multivariate imputation by chained equation algorithm in combination with a predictive 
mean matching approach, which led to the pooled results of five multiple imputed 
datasets.30 In order to assess differences in the prevalence of shoulder problems and 
substantial shoulder problems between the intervention and control groups over time, we 
used generalized estimating equations (GEE) models.31 We used an exchangeable covariance 
matrix and the significance level (α) was 0.05 for all analyses. Any anthropometric or 
demographic variables showing a possible difference between groups at baseline (p<0.2) 
was added to the GEE models using a forward selection procedure. However, as we 
identified no confounding effects, univariate analyses were performed. All analyses were 
performed using SPSS statistical software (SPSS V.21, IBM Corporation, New York, USA).  
RESULTS 
Participants 
A total of 22 prevention teams (n=331) and 23 control teams (n=329) entered the study, 
with no group differences in gender or competition level. Dropout during the study and the 
numbers included in the analyses are shown in figure 2. The male players in the intervention 
group were younger compared to the control group, with no other group differences in 
anthropometrics or demographics (Table 1). Players reported to have played handball for an 
average of 14 yrs (SD 5, range 4 to 37). The majority were right handed (78%). There were no 
group differences in playing position, with 40% backs, 24% wings, 14% line players, 13% 
goalkeepers and 7% reporting multiple positions.

Shoulder pain and problems at baseline 
At the time of inclusion, 145 players (45%) in the intervention group and 155 players (48%) 
in the control group reported a history of shoulder pain during the previous handball season. 
Current shoulder pain was reported by 93 players (29%) in the intervention group and 96 
players (30%) in the control group. At baseline, 155 players (47%) in the intervention group 
and 156 players (48%) in the control group reported a shoulder problem during the previous 
seven days based on the OSTRC Overuse Injury Questionnaire. Of these, 45 players (14%) in 
the intervention group and 46 players (14%) in the control group reported a substantial 
shoulder problem. There were no group differences in the prevalence of shoulder pain or 
problems reported at baseline.  
Shoulder injuries and surgery at baseline 
Five players (1.6%) in the intervention group and 7 players (2.2%) in the control group 
reported an acute shoulder injury within the last six months; however, all participated in 
normal handball activity. Team medical staff confirmed this and specified the diagnoses: two 
SLAP lesions and three anterior shoulder dislocations in the intervention group and six SLAP 
lesions and one anterior dislocation in the control group. One player (0.3%) in the 
intervention group and two players (0.6%) in the control group had undergone shoulder 
surgery within 12 months before baseline; however, all three were participating in normal 
handball activity. There were no group differences in the prevalence of acute shoulder 
injuries or surgery reported at baseline. 
 Response rate 
The average response rate for the OSTRC Overuse Injury Questionnaire was 87% (range 84 
to 93%) in the intervention group, and 85% (range 82 to 87%) in the control group. Complete 
injury data were available from 57% and 65% of the players in the intervention and control 
group, respectively. Eighty per cent (n=264) of the players in the intervention group and 82% 
(n=270) in the control group met the a priori criteria of at least three responses. Female 
players had a higher response rate, with no group differences between the intervention 
(90%) and control groups (89%). The average response rate for the exposure data was 67% 
(range 58 to 79%) in the intervention group and 49% (range 30 to 67%) in the control group. 
The average response rate for the compliance data in the intervention groups was similar to 
the injury data, 87% (range: 84 to 92%).  
Exposure 
There were no group differences in the average weekly exposure to handball training or 
match play (Table 2). However, the players in the control group reported to have completed 
17 more min of strength training per week on average (p=0.004).

Compliance 
On average, the OSTRC Shoulder Injury Prevention Program was completed 1.6 times per 
week (range 1.4 to 1.8) in the intervention group, 53% of the 3 times recommended. 
Twenty-one players (7%) did not complete the program at all during the season. Seventy-
nine players (28%) reported an average compliance of between 0.1 to 1.0, 91 players (32%) 
between 1.1 and 2.0, and 90 players (32%) >2.0 sessions per week. The average compliance 
 per week did not differ between players without shoulder problems compared to players 
with shoulder problems at baseline (1.57 vs 1.60, p=0.791). 
Acute shoulder injuries 
A total of 20 and 13 acute injuries were reported in the intervention and control group, 
respectively, corresponding to an average prevalence of acute shoulder injuries throughout 
the season of 1.4 % (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.9%) in the intervention group and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.5 to 
1.2%) in the control group (mean difference 0.5%). These injuries were excluded from the 
following analysis examining the effect of the prevention program. 
Effect of the intervention 
The average prevalence of overuse shoulder problems during the season was 17% (95% CI: 
16% to 19%) in the intervention group and 23% (95% CI: 21% to 26%) in the control group 
(mean difference: 6%). The average prevalence of substantial shoulder problems was 5% 
(95% CI: 4% to 6%) in the intervention group and 8% (95% CI: 7% to 9%) in the control group 
(mean difference: 3%). The six prevalence measures in both groups are illustrated in figure 3. 
GEE analysis revealed 28% lower risk of reporting shoulder problems over time in the 
intervention group compared to the control group (OR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.98, p=0.038). 
We did not detect a significant difference in the risk of reporting substantial shoulder 
problems over time between the intervention and control groups (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.53 to 
1.16, p=0.23). 
 
Figure 3 
 
Within the intervention group, compliance did not influence the risk of shoulder problems 
(Table 3). However, players in the intervention group who reported an average compliance 
of at least 0.1 sessions per week (n=248) had a 69% lower risk of reporting substantial 
shoulder problems than players reporting zero compliance (n=16) (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15 to 
0.67, p=0.003).

The average severity score of the shoulder problems reported was 29 (95% CI: 28 to 31) in 
the intervention group and 35 (95% CI: 32 to 37) in the control group (mean difference: 5). 
The relative impact of shoulder problems was 64% lower in the intervention group 
(intervention group: 5.2 vs control group: 8.1). 
 
GEE models including only players with shoulder problems at baseline revealed a 35% lower 
risk of reporting shoulder problems in the intervention group than the control group (OR: 
0.65, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.98, p=0.04). However, we detected no significant difference in the 
risk of reporting substantial shoulder problems between groups (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.51 to 
1.45, p=0.58). When only including players without shoulder problems at baseline, we 
identified no significant group difference in the risk of reporting shoulder problems (OR: 
0.80, 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.37, p=0.42) or substantial shoulder problems (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.36 
to 1.31, p=0.25) during the season. 
Unintended effects 
No severe shoulder injuries were reported due to completion of the prevention program in 
the intervention group. However, at the start of the study a few coaches reported some 
cases of players experiencing muscle soreness after completing the prevention program. 
 
 
 
 DISCUSSION 
Our main finding was that a 10-minute comprehensive exercise program, the OSTRC 
Shoulder Injury Prevention Program, reduced the prevalence of shoulder problems and 
substantial shoulder problems among elite handball players; the odds of reporting shoulder 
problems during the competitive season was 28% lower in the intervention group. 
 
This is the first randomised controlled trial investigating a program designed to reduce 
overuse shoulder injuries in elite throwing athletes,24 although similar observations were 
reported from a 6-month pilot study with 53 female junior handball players (three teams) in 
the intervention group.32 They found that the prevalence of shoulder complaints decreased 
significantly during the intervention period among players completing specific shoulder-
strengthening exercises. The program was completed as a part of the warm-up three times 
per week and consisted of three exercises, push-up plus, standing glenohumeral internal and 
external rotation with elastic band as resistance, similar to exercises included in the current 
study. 
 
The prevention program evaluated in this trial is comprehensive and includes exercises to 
improve glenohumeral rotation, external rotation strength and scapula control, all suggested 
to be included in prevention programs for shoulder problems.3 17 21 In addition, the exercises 
target the kinetic chain and thoracic mobility, despite a lack of risk factor studies 
investigating their relation to shoulder injuries among throwing athletes. However, both the 
expert panel involved in the development process and the literature highlighted these 
factors.2 3 23 33 For practical reasons, we did not conduct baseline or follow up testing to 
examine the effect of the program on the risk factors targeted. 
 
No clear dose-response relationship was identified. However, players within the intervention 
group actually performing the prevention program had 69% lower odds of reporting 
substantial shoulder problems compared to players not performing the program in the 
intervention group. Sub-analyses including only players with a self-reported shoulder 
problem at baseline revealed 35% significantly lower odds of reporting shoulder problems 
during the season in the intervention group. In contrast, we found no significant effect of the 
 program when including only players without a shoulder problem at baseline, even if their 
compliance was as good as among players with shoulder problems at baseline. 
Methodological considerations 
A major strength of this trial is the use of cluster randomisation to avoid crossover effects 
between the intervention and control groups. We also stratified for gender and competition 
level to ensure that groups were comparable. An injury surveillance method recently 
developed and validated to study overuse injuries was employed, to capture the true extent 
of shoulder problems.25 34 Parallel registration of acute shoulder injuries was done by players 
and team medical staff to avoid misreporting of acute injuries as overuse injuries. This 
allowed us to assess the effect of the prevention program on the prevalence of overuse 
problems alone. However, a limitation of the injury registration method is the lack of 
detailed diagnostic information on each case. Our definition of a shoulder problem 
encompasses all physical complaints and may have multiple causes, such as subacromial and 
internal impingement, tendon pathology, glenoid labrum injuries, glenohumeral joint 
instability and acromioclavicular joint dysfunction.1 2 15 35 The effect of the prevention 
program reported in this trial may differ between these; we were unable to discriminate 
such relationships. 
 
Traditionally, injury prevention studies exclude players injured at baseline and only record 
new cases throughout the study, with incidence as the measure for risk. Applying such an 
approach in the current trial would be inappropriate. First, excluding players reporting a 
shoulder problem at baseline would have resulted in a biased study population, not 
representative of athletes from throwing sports, where shoulder problems are very 
common. Therefore, we included all players participating in normal handball activity, 
irrespective of their baseline injury status or history. Second, overuse shoulder problems are 
often chronic, with periods of remission and exacerbation. Only a handful of the cases 
reported in this trial represented first-time problems. Therefore, the proportion of players 
affected by shoulder problems at any given time, the population prevalence, is a more 
appropriate measure of the magnitude of the problem.34 
 
 The prevalence of shoulder problems reported in the control group is lower than in a recent 
study on risk factors for shoulder problems among male elite handball players using the 
same injury registration method,3 possibly due to a crossover effect. Before agreeing to 
participate in the study and before the randomisation process, all coaches and players 
received the same information about the study, both orally and in writing. This may have 
increased the awareness of shoulder problems in the control group, even though we 
encouraged them to train as usual. We had no control of whether the control group 
performed exercises similar to our prevention program. In fact, the control group reported a 
doing more strength training than the intervention group, possibly because they replaced 
the prevention program with additional strength training. Nevertheless, any bias arising 
from contamination would result in an underestimation of the preventive effect reported in 
this trial. 
 
Simple comparison of prevalence measures between the intervention and control group 
revealed a lower average prevalence of shoulder problems and substantial shoulder 
problems reported during the season in the intervention group. The main benefits of this 
comparison are that it is easy to calculate and takes into account all available injury data. It 
is, however, made on crude summary measures of prevalence and does not account for 
change over time, confounding or missing. A high response rate and sufficient completeness 
of injury data allowed us to address missing using multiple imputation techniques and 
perform GEE analysis to include players meeting our a priori criteria of at least three 
responses to the OSTRC Overuse Injury Questionnaire. The GEE is a more robust analysis 
which accounts for repeated measures and allowed us to compare changes in prevalence of 
shoulder problems between the intervention and control group over time, revealing a 
significantly lower odds of reporting shoulder problems in the intervention group. However, 
we underestimated the number of players needed to establish the effects of the program on 
substantial shoulder problems. 
 
Baseline demographics, anthropometrics or injury status/history of injury had no 
confounding effect on the comparison of prevalence of shoulder problems or substantial 
shoulder problems between groups over time. However, a limitation of our GEE analysis was 
the inability to include player exposure as a potential confounder, due to a lower response 
 rate for the exposure data, although we found no difference in the reported exposure to 
handball training or match play between groups. 
Implications 
Our results suggest that a comprehensive exercise program targeting glenohumeral internal 
rotation, external rotation strength, scapular control, kinetic chain and thoracic mobility 
should be included as a part of the general warm-up. We used male and female handball 
players from the two upper divisions as our model, as this is the largest homogenous sample 
of throwing athletes available in Norway. Whether the preventive effect observed in this 
trial can be generalised to other throwing athletes is not known. However, the internal 
modifiable risk factors associated with shoulder problems in other throwing sports are 
similar to handball.3-6 16-21 It therefore seems reasonable to assume that the OSTRC Shoulder 
Injury Prevention Program could benefit other throwing athletes, as well.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC 
Shoulder injuries are highly prevalent among throwing athletes and are dominated by 
overuse characteristics. Reduced glenohumeral rotation, external rotation weakness and 
scapula dyskinesis have been identified as risk factors, but exercise programs addressing 
these factors to prevent overuse shoulder injuries in throwing sports have not been tested in 
controlled trials. 
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS  
The OSTRC Shoulder Injury Prevention Program, a comprehensive exercise program 
targeting glenohumeral internal rotation, external rotation strength, scapular control, kinetic 
chain control and thoracic mobility, reduced the risk of shoulder problems in elite handball 
by 28% and should be included as a part of the warm-up in throwing sports.
