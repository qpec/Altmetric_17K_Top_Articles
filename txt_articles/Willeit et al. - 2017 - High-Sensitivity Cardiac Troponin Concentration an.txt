ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND High-sensitivity assays can quantify cardiac troponins I and T (hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT) in individuals with no
clinically manifest myocardial injury.
OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to assess associations of cardiac troponin concentration with cardiovascular
disease (CVD) outcomes in primary prevention studies.
METHODS A search was conducted of PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE for prospective studies published
up to September 2016, reporting on associations of cardiac troponin concentration with first-ever CVD outcomes
(i.e., coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke, or the combination of both). Study-specific estimates, adjusted for
conventional risk factors, were extracted by 2 independent reviewers, supplemented with de novo data from
PROSPER (Pravastatin in Elderly Individuals at Risk of Vascular Disease Study), then pooled by using random
effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS A total of 28 relevant studies were identified involving 154,052 participants. Cardiac troponin was detectable
in 80.0% (hs-cTnI: 82.6%; hs-cTnT: 69.7%). In PROSPER, positive associations of log-linear shape were observed
between hs-cTnT and CVD outcomes. In the meta-analysis, the relative risks comparing the top versus the bottom
troponin third were 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31 to 1.56) for CVD (11,763 events), 1.67 (95% CI: 1.50 to 1.86)
for fatal CVD (7,775 events), 1.59 (95% CI: 1.38 to 1.83) for CHD (7,061 events), and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.23 to 1.48) for stroke
(2,526 events). For fatal CVD, associations were stronger in North American studies (p ¼ 0.010) and those measuring
hs-cTnT rather than hs-cTnI (p ¼ 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS In the general population, high cardiac troponin concentration within the normal range is
associated with increased CVD risk. This association is independent of conventional risk factors, strongest
for fatal CVD, and applies to both CHD and stroke. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;70:558–68) © 2017 The Authors.

ardiac troponins are structural proteins in the
contractile apparatus of cardiac myocytes
that are released into the circulation after car-
diac myocyte cell death (1). Since the introduction of
the first troponin assays in the early 1990s, measure-
ment of circulating cardiac troponin concentration
has become a cornerstone in the diagnosis and acute
management of myocardial infarction (MI) (2). Devel-
opment of high-sensitivity assays allowed the detec-
tion of cardiac troponin I and T (hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT,
respectively) at lower concentrations, which enabled
earlier
identification
of
myocardial
injury
and
increased diagnostic accuracy in patients with sus-
pected MI (3).
At the same time, these methodological advances
have led to a fundamental change in the clinical
interpretation
of
cardiac
troponin
assay
results.
Although patients traditionally have been classified
as being “troponin-positive” or “troponin-negative”
in the context of the diagnosis of acute MI, new-
generation assays allow a continuous interpretation
of findings (i.e., higher vs. lower concentration).
Furthermore,
high-sensitivity
assays
can
detect
circulating cardiac troponin in individuals with no
clinically manifest myocardial damage or previous
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Recent studies in subjects recruited from the gen-
eral population have suggested that elevations in
circulating cardiac troponin are associated with a
higher risk of a first-ever CVD event (4–30). The
largest such study, from the BiomarCaRE (Biomarkers
for
Cardiovascular
Risk
Assessment
in
Europe)
consortium, reported a hazard ratio (HR) for CVD of
1.92
(95%
confidence
interval
[CI]:
1.76
to
2.10)
comparing the highest versus the lowest quintile of
hs-cTnI concentration (11). Although these studies
have yielded promising findings, their interpretation
and comparison have been hampered by use of
different scales and inconsistent adjustment of effect
estimates. To clarify associations of cardiac troponins
with incident CVD, the present study collated effect
estimates
from
published
studies
conducted
in
populations free of previous CVD, supplemented
them with de novo data, and combined them
in a meta-analysis.
METHODS
We systematically searched the electronic
databases
PubMed,
Web
of
Science,
and
EMBASE for prospective studies published up
to September 2016 that reported on associa-
tions of cardiac troponin concentration with
incident CVD outcomes. The search strategy
is detailed in Online Table 1. Studies were
eligible for inclusion if they: 1) had measured
hs-cTnI
and/or
hs-cTnT
with
a
high-
sensitivity assay; 2) had recruited partici-
pants not based on having a history of CVD at
baseline; and 3) had recorded CVD outcomes
over more than 1 year of follow-up. We
further obtained unpublished tabular data
from the Bruneck Study through direct cor-
respondence with study investigators (31).
Using
standardized
data
extraction
protocols,
2
independent reviewers (P.W. and J.D.W.E.) extracted,
by consensus, information on geographical location,
baseline survey dates, study design, exclusion of
participants with pre-existing CVD, mean age at
baseline, proportion of male subjects, proportion of
white participants, sample type, cardiac troponin
assay manufacturer, assay detection limit, proportion
of participants with detectable cardiac troponin, and
number of participants in the study. In relation to
incident outcomes, the reviewers extracted data on
duration of follow-up, the specific composition of
reported endpoints, the number of outcomes accrued,
effect sizes, and the degree of statistical adjustment
of any reported association. The degree of adjustment
was classified as “o” when relative risks (RRs) were
adjusted for age and sex only, “þ” when RRs were
adjusted
for
conventional
risk
factors
(age,
sex,
smoking, diabetes, blood pressure, and total and
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]); “þþ”
when RRs were also adjusted for C-reactive protein
(CRP) or serum creatinine; and “þþþ” after further
adjustment for B-type natriuretic peptides. If multi-
ple publications on the same study were available,

THE
PROSPER
STUDY. PROSPER
(Pravastatin
in
Elderly
Individuals
at
Risk
of
Vascular
Disease
Study) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled pravastatin trial in individuals with pre-
existing CVD or risk factors thereof (i.e., smoking,
hypertension, diabetes) (33,34). The present analysis
involved 4,402 participants with no previous CVD
and
with
complete
information
on
hs-cTnT
and
covariates, recruited at study centers in Scotland,
Ireland,
and
the
Netherlands
(Online
Figure
1).

electrochemiluminescence
immu-
noassay. The occurrence of incident outcomes was
adjudicated by the PROSPER Endpoints Committee
during the in-trial phase (mean duration: 3.2 years)
and ascertained with routine health data thereafter.
The institutional ethics review boards of all centers
approved the protocol, and all participants gave
written informed consent. The protocol adhered to
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Further
details are provided in the Online Appendix.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. The statistical analysis was
conducted
according
to
a
pre-defined
statistical
analysis
plan.
The
combined
CVD
endpoint
was
defined
as
fatal
coronary
heart
disease
(CHD),
nonfatal MI, and fatal plus nonfatal stroke (ischemic,
hemorrhagic,
or
unclassified).
In
PROSPER,
we
assessed cross-sectional associations between
hs-
cTnT and other characteristics by using linear and
logistic regression models (for continuous and cate-
gorical data, respectively), adjusted for age, sex,
center, and treatment arm. HRs were calculated for
CVD outcomes stratified according to treatment arm
and were progressively adjusted for age, sex, and
center (model 1), plus smoking, history of diabetes
mellitus,
history
of
hypertension,
systolic
blood
pressure, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and body mass
index (model 2), plus CRP, estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR), and N-terminal pro–B-type
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (model 3).
To characterize shapes of associations with CVD
outcomes, HRs were calculated across quartiles of
detectable hs-cTnT concentration by using partici-
pants with undetectable hs-cTnT as the reference
group, and HRs were plotted against the median hs-
cTnT concentration within each category. For the
outcomes of CVD and fatal CVD, effect modification
was explored across clinically relevant subgroups
with formal tests of interaction. We also tested
whether assessment of hs-cTnT, in addition to age,
sex, smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus,
systolic blood pressure, and levels of total cholesterol
and HDL-C, could improve the prediction of 10-year
CVD risk. C-index changes as well as categorical and
continuous net reclassification indexes (NRIs) were
calculated by using previously published methods
(35,36). Categorical NRIs were calculated across 10-
year predicted risk categories of <15%, 15% to <25%,
and $25%, chosen to reflect the elevated risk in the
study population; 95% CIs were estimated for these
prediction metrics by using bootstrap resampling
with 999 repetitions.
Study-specific risk estimates were pooled by using
random effects meta-analyses. Odds ratios and HRs
were assumed to approximate the same underlying

After multivariable adjustment, models were stratified according to treatment arm; the
group with undetectable high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) values was used as
the reference group. The median hs-cTnT concentrations (ranges) in quartiles of
detectable hs-cTnT were 4 ng/l (3 to 4), 6 ng/l (5 to 7), 9 ng/l (8 to 11), and 16 ng/l
(12 to 1,840). Sizes of data markers are proportional to the inverse of the variance
of the hazard ratios. CHD ¼ coronary heart disease; CI ¼ confidence interval;
CVD ¼ cardiovascular disease. PROSPER ¼ Pravastatin in Elderly Individuals at Risk of

 measure of RR. When studies reported RRs of various
levels of adjustment, the most adjusted estimate was
used. To enable a consistent approach to analysis,
RRs and 95% CIs in each study were standardized to a
common scale (i.e., to reflect a comparison of the top
third vs. the bottom third of the population’s cardiac
troponin
distribution,
using
methods
previously
described) (37). Consistency of findings across studies
was assessed with standard chi-square tests and the I2
statistic (38). Subgroup analyses were conducted by
using
meta-regression
across
pre-specified
study-
level characteristics (39). Evidence of publication bias
was assessed by using funnel plots and Egger’s
asymmetry test (40). Statistical tests were 2-sided and
used a significance level of p < 0.05 for principal
analyses and p < 0.01 for subgroup analyses.
RESULTS
In PROSPER, hs-cTnT was detectable in 3,853 (87.5%)
of 4,402 participants. The median concentration of
hs-cTnT was 7 ng/l (interquartile range: 4 to 11 ng/l),
and 85% of hs-cTnT values were within the normal
range of #14 ng/l. Concentration of hs-cTnT corre-
lated positively with age, male sex, body mass index,
blood pressure, NT-proBNP, CRP, history of diabetes
mellitus,
and
history
of
hypertension
(Online
Table 2). Concentration of hs-cTnT was lower in cur-
rent smokers and correlated inversely with renal
function assessed by eGFR. There was no difference
in hs-cTnT according to trial arm.
In the overall cohort, 694 fatal CVD events were
recorded over a follow-up duration of up to 11.3 years
(mean: 8.2 years). At the Scottish center, 519 fatal and
nonfatal CVD events, 405 CHD events, and 269 stroke
events were recorded. After adjusting for age, sex,
smoking, history of diabetes mellitus, history of hy-
pertension, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol,
HDL-C, and body mass index, the shapes of associa-
tions between baseline hs-cTnT concentration and
CVD
outcomes
were
approximately
log
linear
(Figure 1). The adjusted HRs for a comparison of the top
third versus the bottom third of the hs-cTnT concen-
tration were 1.55 (95% CI: 1.23 to 1.96) for CVD, 2.16
(95% CI: 1.74 to 2.67) for fatal CVD, 1.85 (95% CI: 1.42 to
2.42) for CHD, and 1.21 (95% CI: 0.88 to 1.67) for stroke.
There was some attenuation of estimates after further
adjustment for CRP, eGFR, and NT-proBNP (Online
Table 3). There was no evidence for effect modifica-
tion by a range of participant characteristics, including
age, sex, diabetes, eGFR, and NT-proBNP, but there
was evidence for a somewhat stronger association in
never- or ex-smokers compared with current smokers
(Online Figure 2).
LITERATURE-BASED META-ANALYSIS. We screened
4,645 records and identified 28 eligible prospective
studies (4–30) reporting on a total of 154,052 partici-
pants (Table 1, Online Figure 3). Eighteen studies were
based in Europe, 7 in North America, 1 in Asia, and 2
were multinational. The mean age was 56.1 years,
52.8% of participants were male, and 88.6% were
white. Seventeen studies had measured hs-cTnI and 11
had measured hs-cTnT. The proportion of participants
with detectable cardiac troponin concentrations was
80.0% overall (82.6% in hs-cTnI studies and 69.7% in
hs-cTnT studies). Multivariable regression analyses
weighting studies according to their size identified
that the proportion of participants with detectable
troponin was higher in hs-cTnI studies (p ¼ 0.007) and
in older study populations (8.3% per decade higher
mean age; p ¼ 0.009) but was unrelated to sex distri-
butions (p ¼ 0.155). Figure 2 displays the proportion of
troponin detection according to study, assay type, and
mean age of the study population.
The combined RR in the top third versus the bottom
third of cardiac troponin concentration was 1.43 for
CVD, 1.67 for fatal CVD, 1.59 for CHD, and 1.35 for stroke
(Figure 3). Forest plots for each outcome are shown in
Online Figures 4 to 7. The level of between-study
heterogeneity was low for stroke (I2 ¼ 0%; p ¼ 0.764)
and high for other outcomes (I2 >75%; all p < 0.001).
Magnitudes of associations with CVD and fatal CVD
were largely similar across studies grouped according
to geographical regions, in studies nested versus those
not nested in clinical trials (Online Figure 8), and for
different mean ages of study participants, proportions
of male participants, and numbers of recorded events
(Online Figure 9). Associations for fatal CVD were
somewhat stronger in studies based in North America
(p ¼ 0.010) (Online Figure 8) and studies measuring hs-
cTnT rather than hs-cTnI (p ¼ 0.027) (Online Figure 8).
Associations with CVD were stronger in studies with a
higher proportion of nonwhite participants (p ¼ 0.004)
(Online Figure 9). There was evidence for publication
bias
in
reporting
associations
with
fatal
CVD
(pEgger ¼ 0.027) but not for the other outcomes
assessed (Online Figure 10).
The addition of hs-cTnT concentration to a predic-
tion model containing information on conventional
risk factors improved the prediction of fatal CVD
(Online Table 4). It improved the C-index by 0.028
(95% CI: 0.007 to 0.050; p ¼ 0.018), the categorical NRI
by 0.123 (95% CI: 0.074 to 0.153; p < 0.001), and the
continuous NRI by 0.357 (95% CI: 0.277 to 0.436;
p < 0.001). In contrast, for the overall CVD outcome,
smaller improvements in the continuous NRI of 0.152
(95% CI: 0.052 to 0.253; p ¼ 0.003) were observed,
whereas no improvements were observed in the

DISCUSSION
In the present report that combined de novo data
from
the
PROSPER
study
with
a
comprehensive
literature-based meta-analysis, we reliably quantified
associations of baseline cardiac troponin measure-
ments
with
first-ever
CVD
outcomes
(Central
Illustration). We further determined the added pre-
dictive value of such measurements in the primary
prevention of CVD.
ASSOCIATIONS WITH CVD OUTCOMES. Overall, the
present
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
involved
data
from
28
long-term
prospective
studies with a total of 154,052 participants without
previous CVD. All included studies measured cardiac
troponins hs-cTnT or hs-cTnI with high-sensitivity
assays and reported detectable levels in 80% of
people, on average. Pooled estimates from the meta-
analysis
suggest
that
individuals
with
cardiac
troponin values in the top third of the population
distribution are at 43% increased risk of any CVD,
59% increased risk of CHD, and 67% increased risk of
fatal CVD outcomes. A smaller but significant in-
crease in stroke risk (35%) was noted. It is likely that

 this association was driven by cardiac and heart
rhythm
abnormalities
causing
ischemic
stroke,
including
paroxysmal
atrial
fibrillation
(41).
An
analysis of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
Study according to stroke subtype revealed prefer-
ential associations of hs-cTnT with cardioembolic
stroke (8). Furthermore, Wrigley et al. (42) recently
reported that, in patients with acute ischemic stroke,
an elevated troponin concentration was associated
with structural cardiac disease detected by using
echocardiography.
Our findings in the meta-analysis were further
substantiated by analyses of PROSPER study data,
showing
that
subjects
with
higher
blood
concentrations of hs-cTnT were at higher risk of
developing fatal and nonfatal CVD and CHD. Associ-
ations were independent of conventional CVD risk
factors and persisted even after additional adjust-
ment for NT-proBNP, eGFR, and CRP. We could also
confirm a previous suggestion from the BiomarCaRE
consortium
(11)
that
the
risk
of
these
diseases
increased approximately log linearly with higher
cardiac troponin concentration, with no evidence for
a threshold effect at a certain level. It is striking that
we observed significant positive associations with
CVD outcomes even though 85% of the study popu-
lation had hs-cTnT values within the normal range
(#14 ng/l) at baseline.

Cardiac Troponins and Cardiovascular Outcomes

 We also detected significant between-study het-
erogeneity for the associations with the outcomes of
all CVD and fatal CVD. Studies varied in their age
and
sex
profile,
outcome
definitions,
follow-up
durations,
and
degrees
of
statistical
adjustment,
but none of these factors had an influence on the
strengths of associations observed. However, our
analysis revealed possibly stronger associations in
studies based in North America and with a higher
proportion of nonwhite participants. Although it is
well established that nonwhite participants have
higher cardiac troponin values compared with white
participants (4,7,8,12,15), single studies have so far
not detected that associations of cardiac troponins
with CHD (7) or stroke (8) are modified according to
ethnicity. Furthermore, we noted a trend toward
stronger associations for hs-cTnT than for hs-cTnI.
To shed more light on this preliminary finding,
future research is needed that evaluates, in a direct
comparison, whether the clinical utility of hs-cTnT
and hs-cTnI measurements depends on the assay
generation or on patient characteristics, including
age,
sex,
and
indicators
of
myocardial
stress.
Although
findings
in
PROSPER
and
3
previous
studies (8,25,26) suggested that the prognostic value
of cardiac troponins does not vary according to
NT-proBNP levels, analysis of large-scale individual-
participant data is required to assess multiplicative
interactions adequately.
BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. The traditional view has
been that cardiac troponins are elevated in case of
myocardial necrosis only; however, evidence has
emerged that other heart diseases such as atrial fibril-
lation (43) and cardiac structural and functional

 abnormalities (15,44) can also lead to modest increases
in cardiac troponin concentrations in circulation.
Another relevant factor could be subclinical coronary
atherosclerosis. Coronary angiography studies have
shown close correlations between the severity of
coronary
atherosclerosis
and
cardiac
troponin
concentration (45). It is speculated that clinically
silent
ruptures
of
coronary
plaques
trigger
microembolizations and, consequently, the shedding
of troponin from cardiomyocytes via membranous
blebs (46). A third mechanism could be the link be-
tween cardiac troponin concentration and cardiac
stress characterized by activation of the adrenergic and
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
systems.
This
rela-
tionship has been demonstrated in patients with heart
failure (47).

Willeit, P. et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2017;70(5):558–68.
In assessing the association of cardiac troponin concentration and CVD outcomes, we identified 28 relevant studies. Thirds of cardiac troponin
concentration were defined within each study separately. Study-specific relative risks for first-ever CVD outcomes were pooled by using a random effects
meta-analysis, demonstrating that high cardiac troponin levels in the normal range are associated with increased CVD event risk. The distribution graph is
illustrative and cardiac troponin distributions were not normally distributed. CHD ¼ coronary heart disease; CVD ¼ cardiovascular disease.

 CLINICAL RELEVANCE. Our data also suggested that
cardiac troponin assessment could be a useful adjunct
to conventional risk factors in predicting CVD risk. In
line with a preferential association of cardiac tropo-
nins with fatal CVD, assessment of hs-cTnT in the
PROSPER study yielded greater improvements for
predicting fatal CVD than overall CVD. For fatal CVD,
it yielded improvements in the C-index as well as
categorical and continuous NRIs. For the overall CVD
outcome, hs-cTnT assessment only improved the
continuous NRI.
Another group of biomarkers that has emerged as a
potential adjunct to CVD risk prediction are the natri-
uretic peptides. In the Natriuretic Peptides Studies
Collaboration,
a
large
collaborative
individual-
participant-data meta-analysis, NT-proBNP demon-
strated associations with CVD (RR: 1.76; 95% CI:
1.56 to 1.98) and CHD (RR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.45 to
1.93)
that
were
of
similar
magnitude
to
those
observed in PROSPER for hs-cTnT (48). The associa-
tion between hs-cTnT and CVD risk was weakened
in PROSPER after adjustment for NT-proBNP but
remained significant. It might be that a combination
of
these
biomarkers
or
a
more
extensive
panel
of complementary biomarkers will provide the great-
est
improvement
in
prediction.
However,
this
approach might be limited by cost, which requires
further study.
Furthermore, the data presented from PROSPER
and studies in the current meta-analysis all classi-
fied participants on the basis of a single measure-
ment
of
cardiac
troponin.
Diurnal
variability
in
cardiac troponin has been observed with moderately
higher levels during the morning (49), and short-
term variability was present both in those with
and without known coronary artery disease (50).
This biological variation will need to be explored
further to inform selection of appropriate cutoffs for
use in clinical practice. Evaluations of the prog-
nostic value of changes in cardiac troponin over
time have suggested that the trajectory of cardiac
troponin might provide additional prognostic infor-
mation (12,51).
Recent data from the WOSCOPS (West of Scotland
Coronary Prevention Study) trial showed that pra-
vastatin significantly lowered hs-cTnI in a manner
consistent with lower CVD risk (28). This recent
paper, along with our summation of available pro-
spective data on troponins and CVD risk, suggests
that more research on troponins as markers of clinical
utility beyond the diagnosis of an acute coronary
syndrome is urgently needed.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. This study provided de novo
data from the PROSPER study and was strengthened by
concurrent reporting of a comprehensive review of the
literature regarding the association between cardiac
troponin and incident CVD. Transformation of study-
specific HRs to reflect RR between those with cardiac
troponin values in the upper third compared with the
lower third allowed a common scale to be used when
pooling studies and has been used in the assessment of
a number of biomarkers (52). It did, however, assume
that the relationship between the biomarker of interest
and disease risk was linear. In the meta-analysis, there
was significant between-study
heterogeneity
that
could have resulted from several differences between
the included studies as discussed earlier. Inherent
limitations exist in the use of study-level data in this
meta-analysis, and the availability of individual-
participant data would allow for further standardiza-
tion of analytical techniques, covariate adjustment,
and subgroup analysis.
CONCLUSIONS
Elevated cardiac troponin concentration, well within
the normal range, was associated with an increased
risk of incident CVD outcomes in the general popu-
lation. This association was strongest for fatal CVD
and
persisted
after
adjustment
for
conventional
CVD
risk
factors.
Further
research
on
cardiac
troponin as a useful marker of risk prediction seems
warranted.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:
Meta-analysis of published studies suggests that
people with elevated circulating troponin concentra-
tions in absence of clinically manifest myocardial
injury are at a relatively high risk of developing
cardiovascular events.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future research is
needed to clarify the predictive value of cardiac
troponin measurements in relation to conventional
cardiovascular risk factors.
