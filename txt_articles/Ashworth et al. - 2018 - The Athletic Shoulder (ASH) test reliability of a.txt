What are the new findings?
 
► The  test is a novel reliable way of assessing shoul-
der strength to guide safe and asymptomatic return 
to arm tackling as part of a return to play process.
 
► The test can be used to quantify recovery of muscle 
function after exercise or training/match exposure 
when compared with a player’s normal values.
 
► It is suggested that this test forms part of a cluster of 
tests of shoulder function including strength, range 
of motion (ROM) and control, to ensure a compre-
hensive overview of all of the components relevant 
to the maintenance of shoulder stability.
AbsTrACT
Objectives Lower limb isometric tests are used to 
assess strength and strength asymmetries and monitor 
reductions in muscle force that may contribute to loss of 
performance and increase injury risk. Isometric tests in the 
upper body may be appropriate to monitor neuromuscular 
performance of the shoulder joint in sports involving 
contact and overhead actions. The aim of this study was 
to determine the reliability of a novel upper body isometric 
strength test.
Methods Eighteen elite rugby players (age 22.4±4.6 
years; body mass 95.5±13.4 kg) were tested on 
consecutive days. Maximal isometric contractions using 
both limbs against a force platform were assessed 
at three angles of abduction (180°, ‘I’; 135°, ‘Y’ and 
90°, ‘T’), in a prone lying position. To evaluate interday 
reliability, intraclass coefficients (ICC) were calculated for 
mean net peak force (NPF) and highest NPF achieved in 
any trial (peak NPF). Intratrial variability was assessed 
using coefficient of variation (CV), and the standard error 
of measurement (SEM) was used to calculate minimal 
detectable change (MDC).
results Interday reliability for NPF was excellent in all 
test positions (ICC 0.94–0.98). The test demonstrated high 
absolute reliability values (SEM 4.8–10.8) and interday 
measurement error was below 10% in all test positions 
(CV 5.0–9.9%) except for the non-dominant arm I-position 
(CV 11.3%). Minimum detectable change was between 
13.2 and 25.9 N.
Conclusion The Athletic Shoulder test demonstrated 
excellent reliability for each test position supporting its 
use as a reliable tool to quantify the ability to produce and 
transfer force across the shoulder girdle.
InTrOduCTIOn
In rugby, shoulder injuries are responsible 
for a large number of days lost per season 
and have a high likelihood of recurrence.1 
Injury risk is significantly increased in players 
during tackling and defensive drills and when 
required to cope with higher speeds, higher 
collision forces and unstable positions, as 
experienced in a long lever arm tackle.2 3 As 
the majority of shoulder injuries occur in 
the latter stages of training and matches as 
a consequence of repeated exposure to tack-
ling, fatigue may contribute to risk.4 Adequate 
shoulder strength may buffer against the 
reduced tackling ability and increased injury 
risk consequent to fatigue.5 
In elite sports, lower limb isometric tests 
are used to monitor reductions in  force as 
a potential indicator of residual or accumu-
lated fatigue.6 Isometric tests can be routinely 
implemented on recovery days following a 
match and are potentially safer than eccen-
tric tests with regard to minimising potential 
for muscle damage.7 Therefore, they can be 
used more regularly as a monitoring tool 
without concern of impacting on training 
and performance. In sports such as rugby or 
overhead sports where shoulder injuries are 
common, no such assessment tool exists, but 
such a test has potential value2 as a means 
to assess the athlete’s capability to meet the 
functional demands of their sport both from 
an optimal performance and injury risk 
reduction perspective. Furthermore, objec-
tive markers are needed to inform decision 
making around safe return of an injured 
rugby player to contact and the tackle situa-
tion and to evaluate players’ ability to cope 
with the loads they will be exposed to in 
competition.8 9

Isokinetic dynamometry  is a gold standard method 
of strength assessment but is difficult to systematically 
implement in sports or clinical settings,10–13 resulting in 
the widespread use of hand-held dynamometry (HHD) 
to assess muscle strength. HHD is a more rapid, portable 
and cheaper means of evaluating shoulder strength, 
which can be used in a team sports environment where 
many players may need to be tested in a short period of 
time.14–16 However, the reliability of HHD is questioned 
due to a lack of consensus regarding test protocols and 
other potential sources of measurement error such 
as variations in warmup strategies, tester and subject 
position, shoulder position, tester strength, subject 
stabilisation and equipment stabilisation.17–20 The stabi-
lisation of HHD during a test is affected by the relative 
strengths of tester and subject, and it is suggested 
that the reliability of the test is compromised if the 
subject produces more than 30 kg,21 an output which a 
substantial proportion of elite rugby players and other 
overhead athletes may exceed. A potential alternative to 
HHD is to assess isometric force using a force platform, 
a gold standard force-measuring tool.20 22 Applying 
force into a fixed force platform would eliminate oper-
ator strength as a potential source of error. In addition, 
existing upper limb strength assessments are typically 
short lever tests that do not mimic sports specific 
actions or adequately assess higher shear forces experi-
enced during competition.19 A long lever isometric test 
may therefore be a more appropriate means to repli-
cate the shoulder muscle contraction required in the 
tackle position,23 24 based on its correspondence to the 
demands of the tackle and associated mechanisms of 
shoulder injury.10 
The primary aim of this study was therefore to establish 
the reliability and clinimetrics of a novel series of long 
lever upper body isometric force platform tests.
MeThOds
Eighteen elite level male rugby players participated in 
the study. All participants were given a written explana-
tion of test protocol and signed consent forms. Players 
were excluded if they had sustained an acute injury to 
the neck or shoulder girdle (<72 hours prior to testing), 
experienced symptoms after performance of the test that 
lasted longer than 20 min or worsening pain attributed 
to testing or if they were unable to adopt any of the test 
positions due to inadequate range of motion. Body mass, 
height and arm length (posterior angle of the acromion 
to wrist joint line) were measured (online supplementary 
appendix 1).
The IYT tests
All tests were performed with the subject prone on the 
floor with their neck position standardised using a 4 cm 
foam block on which the forehead was rested. The hand 
was placed on a vertical axis force platform (Pasport 
PS-2141, Pasco Scientific, Roseville, California, USA) 
connected to proprietary data acquisition and analysis 
software (NMP technologies, London, UK). In the I-test, 
the shoulder was positioned in full abduction (in line 
with the body), the forearm in pronation and the heel of 
the hand acted as the main contact point with the force 
platform. In the Y-test and T-test, the arm was in 135° and 
90° abduction shoulder abduction, respectively. In all 
tests, the elbow was fully extended (figure 1).
After a standardised warmup consisting of two submax-
imal 80%–90% efforts in each of the testing positions,21 
players performed three trials in each of the three 
different positions on the same limb. This procedure 
was then repeated with the contralateral limb. During 
pilot testing, we established that a 20 s rest period was 
the optimal duration required for full recovery between 
trials, having experimented with both shorter17 and 
longer21 recovery times.
Subjects were required to maintain their scapula in a 
natural position relative to the elevated arm (avoiding 
excessive scapula upward rotation/elevation or anterior 
tilt). Subject position was checked prior to each trial to 
remove visible compensations . The contralateral arm 
was placed behind the back so that the elbow was unable 
to fix on the floor and provide antirotation trunk stability 
for the Y and T tests, but in an I-test the arm was allowed 
to remain by the subject’s side due to lower trunk rota-
tional forces encountered. During performance of the 
test, the subject was required to stabilise their trunk 
against rotation without using the contralateral arm and 
push down from the shoulder through the heel of their 
hand. In the instance of a failure to perform the test 
according to the instructions, the specific trial results 
were discarded and an additional trial was performed 
after 20 s recovery. Tests were consistently performed 
in the following order: I, Y, T and then conducted on 
consecutive days at the same time of day. Completion 
of all three test positions for dominant and non-domi-
nant limbs took under 6 min including recovery periods 
(each individual test position for one limb took 50 s for 
example, the dominant arm T-position). No further 
familiarisation or upper limb training was performed 
between the two test days or in the 72 hours prior to the 
first day of testing.
In order to familiarise players with the test protocol, 
they performed a minimum of three complete tests on 
separate days prior to the study. Subjects were given 
standardised instructions and consistent verbal encour-
agement during the test,25 with a countdown prior to 
each of the efforts. On hearing the instruction, subjects 
were asked to push as fast and hard as possible to generate 
maximal force (aiming to achieve maximum force as fast 
as possible) and sustain it for the full 3 s test duration.17 21 
Tests were excluded if there was a countermovement (the 
hand lifted from its resting position on the platform 
prior to pushing down), if noticeable compensatory 
strategies were used, such as excessive use of the lower 
limb to increase stability, anterior tilt of the scapula or 
elbow flexion26 or if the subject did not perform the test 
correctly. The two examiners (Strength and conditioning

equipment and experienced with the test protocol.
statistical analysis
The maximum and mean across trials of  net peak force 
(NPF) was used in analysis. NPF=peak force achieved 
during the trial – force on the platform prior to the start 
of the contraction (i.e. weight of the limb resting on plat-
form). Means and SD were calculated for maximum and 
mean NPF in Newtons (N). The data were analysed using 
parametric tests due to a normal distribution (Kolmogor-
ov-Smirnov test). To assess relative reliability, the degree 
at which subjects maintain their position in a sample with 
repeated measurements; intraclass correlation coeffi-
cients (ICC) using absolute agreement were calculated.12 
 
Values were interpreted as suggested by Fleiss,27 higher 
ICC values indicate better relative reliability (>0.90 = 
excellent, 0.80–0.89 good; 0.70 and 0.79 moderate;<0.70 
low). Absolute reliability was assessed by calculating the 
standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimum 
detectable change (MDC).17 27 The Hopkins spread-
sheet for consecutive pairwise analysis of repeated 
measurements12 28 was used to determine the change in 
mean between trials, typical error of measurement (TE) 
expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV%) with 90% 
and 95% confidence limits. The CV is a reliability measure 
with ≤10% commonly used as a criterion to characterise 
good reliability.29 30 The MDC, the ‘minimal difference 
needed to be considered as real’, outside of the TE and 
corresponding to a change likely to be "almost certain" 
was calculated as SEM ×1.96 × √2 for 95% confidence 
limits or SEM ×1.65 × √2 for 90% confidence limits.17 
resulTs
Eighteen elite male rugby players participated in the 
study (age 22.4±4.6 years; height 186.3±7.7 cm; body mass 
95.5±13.4 kg (online supplementary appendix 1-table 
2). Interday reliability for mean NPF was excellent in all 
test positions (ICC 0.94–0.98). The test demonstrated 
high absolute reliability (SEM 4.8–10.8) and interday 
measurement error was below 10% in all test positions 
(CV 5.0–9.9) except for non-dominant arm I-position 
(CV 11.3%). MDC90 values for the tests are presented in 
table 1. Reliability was higher when we compared mean 
of three trials ICC 0.94-0.98 to the maximum of three 
trials ICC 0.89–0.98 (online supplementary appendix 
2-table 3.1 and 3.2).
dIsCussIOn
We evaluated a series of novel isometric long lever 
shoulder tests performed on a force platform and found 
excellent reliability (ICCs 0.94–0.98) in the three ‘IYT’ 
positions. There are no upper limb isometric force 
platform tests in the literature for comparison, but this 
compares favourably to the reliability reported for upper 
limb HHD tests such as internal and external rotation 
strength measured in a range of positions: standing, ICC: 
0.92–0.9631; seated, ICC: 0.68–0.9932 and in multiple 
positions, ICC: 0.93–0.99.17 Athletic Shoulder (ASH) 
test reliability was also higher than peak force reliability 
in a lower limb isometric test (ICC 0.86–0.95),6 which 
also used a 3 s maximum effort against a force platform. 
Based on the criteria (CV<10%) used by McCall et al,6 
and others, all test positions (CV 5.0%–9.2%) can be

considered reliable, except for the non-dominant arm 
I-test (CV 11.3%).30 Therefore, practitioners can be 
confident that the force platform IYT tests are reliable in 
detecting between subject and within subject differences.
In practical terms, high reliability does not neces-
sarily mean that a test has the sensitivity to detect a real 
change,6 10 17 and MDC is useful in a monitoring context 
to establish how far ‘the needle needs to move’ before 
a change can be considered meaningful. IYT values for 
MDC90 were 13.3–25.9 N (MDC% ranged from 10.7 to 
20.1), meaning that a change of >13.3 N in a dominant 
arm T-test would be considered meaningful with a confi-
dence level of 90%. For comparison, MDC% 7.5%–19.3% 
was reported in HHD IR and ER strength tests in sitting, 
supine and prone positions,17 and MDC%≤17.8% in 
prone shoulder extension.33 Holt et al34 (2016) compared 
average internal and external rotation strength in neutral 
using HHD with and without external fixation (EFD) and 
found the range of intrarater %MDC’s were lower for 
HHD (17.3%–19.7%) than EFD (19.3%–29.0%). McCall 
et al6 reported MDC90 of between 26.2 and 36.9 n across 
limbs and the two positions of a posterior chain isometric 
force platform test. Thus, the power to interpret change 
in the ASH test is comparable with relevant isometric 
tests in the literature.
In addition to reliability and interpretability, a new test 
should also demonstrate validity and clear purpose.10 The 
force platform is a gold standard force measurement tool 
and valid for use in assessing isometric strength.6 22 The 
principle purpose of the IYT tests was to quantify force 
production and potential interlimb or postinjury deficits 
in rugby specific shoulder positions. The T-position is 
similar to the ‘arm tackle’ position, while the I-position 
closely represents the ‘try-scorer’ injury mechanism.35 
Both tests are performed using a straight arm with force 
delivery at the end of a long lever, corresponding to the 
higher torques and force transfer requirements expe-
rienced in sporting actions than the majority of short 
lever (bent arm) tests in the literature. Therefore, the 
ASH test may have value in tackling sports and in other 
sports, occupations and tasks that expose the shoulder to 
longer lever stress or require the ability to transfer forces 
similarly across the shoulder girdle. It is our preliminary 
observation from pilot testing that the long lever test 
demonstrated unilateral deficits that were not evident 
in short lever testing using HHD which warrants further 
investigation. To our knowledge, the only straight-arm 
test not using an isokinetic dynamometer but instead 
using HHD was developed for swimmers, with a similar 
subject set up to the I-test position of the current study.24 
The authors reported lower interday reliability values in 
the dominant arm (ICC 0.81–0.95; SEM% 4.0–8.8) than 
we observed in the I-position (ICC 0.95–0.97; SEM% 
5.6–7.5). Furthermore, one strength of the present study 
in terms of applicability to elite athletes was the assess-
ment of reliability in an elite population, which few 
shoulder strength studies have done. The higher forces 
produced by more elite athletic populations are more

likely to reduce HHD test reliability,34 suggesting that 
a stable force platform would be more appropriate for 
these populations, eliminating the negative influence of 
tester-athlete strength imbalances on reliability, particu-
larly in stronger athletes.17 34 36 
limitations
There were small differences in reliability between the 
three test positions, which could be related to different 
requirements of the subject to stabilise their trunk against 
rotational forces. Without randomisation of test order for 
each subject however, comparing reliability between test 
positions is not possible,19 and as such our study design 
does not allow this comparison. It could be argued that a 
standing test would be a more sports-specific position to 
evaluate the ability to produce force in a standing tackle. 
However, a standing test has greater potential for test-re-
test variability due to the additional degrees of freedom, 
while the prone position on the floor has the advantage 
of minimising the involvement of other body segments, 
which could explain the high reliability observed. The 
excellent reliability reported in the current study could 
also be related to the removal of inconsistencies outlined 
by other authors.19 In addition, trials were discarded if 
there were visible compensatory strategies. The duration 
of the test and the rest period between trials can influence 
results.26 In pilot testing, we determined that 20 s was the 
minimum optimal rest period needed for subjects to 
consistently repeat a maximum effort without deteriora-
tion in scores across the three trials. In other studies, test 
duration ranged from 3 to 5 s, with rest periods ranging 
from 10 s17 to 5 min,33 factors that may have influenced 
intratest reliability. The authors recommend that the full 
ASH test protocol be completed in preseason to estab-
lish individual baselines for comparison (duration 6 min 
excluding standardised warmup). In-season monitoring 
can focus on one or two positions  (duration 2 to 4 min) 
to reduce time requirement. Although the method 
required that players were familiarised prior to testing 
to minimise any learning effect and 72 hours rest prior 
to the study protocol, it is possible that small increases 
in mean NPF between day 1 and day 2 were influenced 
either by a learning effect or additional recovery time. 
This emphasises the importance of familiarisation prior 
to interpretation of test results. It is important to recog-
nise that results were obtained from elite male rugby 
players and therefore clinimetrics need to be verified in 
other populations.
Future studies
The portability, simplicity and rapid implementation of 
the test in a gym/training environment means that it has 
the potential to be used; with individual athletes during 
rehabilitation to assess  progression in force production 
following injury; to inform return to competition deci-
sions and to regularly monitor recovery of shoulder 
performance following competition induced fatigue in 
groups of athletes. Further work is needed to evaluate 
the sensitivity of the ASH test to competition induced 
fatigue and the profile of strength decrement and 
recovery  as has been demonstrated in isometric lower 
extremity testing.6 Preliminary data in the present group 
of athletes suggest that the test may be a useful tool in 
this capacity as we noted ASH test strength deficits at 48 
hours after a competitve rugby game with recovery at 72 
hours. We have also observed changes beyond the 25 N 
MDC threshold  in a variety of glenohumeral as well as 
cervical spine rehabilitation cases. However, further 
studies that show the sensitivity of the ASH test to alter-
ations in training load, relationship to injury and the 
response to rehabilitation are the necessary next steps in 
determining the usefulness of this test across a wide range 
of environments. NPF was highest in the I-test followed 
by Y-test and T-test, respectively, and it may be of interest 
to determine normative ratios across the IYT positions in 
relation to sport and injury risk in larger samples.
COnClusIOn
The ASH test protocol demonstrated excellent repeat-
ability in each test position, supporting its use as a reliable 
tool to quantify the ability to produce and transfer force 
across the shoulder girdle. Establishing individualised 
baseline scores and normal error (SEM and MDC) for 
players will permit longitudinal monitoring of change. 
The test may be used to benchmark performance in case 
of shoulder injury and to track progress during rehabil-
itation. It also has the potential to be used alone or in 
conjunction with other measures of upper limb force 
production to quantify athlete’s readiness to perform in 
sports that require repeated or high intensity upper limb 
actions.
