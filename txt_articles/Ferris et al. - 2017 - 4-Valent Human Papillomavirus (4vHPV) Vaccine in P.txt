OBJECTIVES: We describe the final 10-year data for the long-term follow-up study of the 
4-valent human papillomavirus (4vHPV) vaccine in preadolescents and adolescents.
METHODS: In the base study (V501-018), 1661 sexually inactive boys and girls received the 
4vHPV vaccine (early vaccination group [EVG], managed for 9.9 years) or a placebo at day 
1, month 2, and month 6. Thereafter, at month 30, the placebo group (catch-up vaccination 
group [CVG], managed for 7.4 years) received the 4vHPV vaccine by using the same dosing 
schedule. Long-term anti-HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 immune responses were assessed. 
Effectiveness was estimated by calculating the incidence rate of the primary endpoints 
(HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18–related disease or persistent infection).
RESULTS: For HPV types 6, 11, and 16, 89% to 96% of subjects remained seropositive 
through 10-years postvaccination. The preadolescents had 38% to 65% higher geometric 
mean titers at month 7, which remained 16% to 42% higher at 10 years compared with 
adolescents. No cases of HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18–related diseases were observed. Ten 
subjects had a persistent infection of ≥6 months duration with vaccine-type HPV and 2 
subjects had persistent infection for ≥12 months. No new serious adverse events were 
reported through 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: A 3-dose regimen of the 4vHPV vaccine was immunogenic, clinically effective, 
and generally well tolerated in preadolescents and adolescents during 10 years of follow-up. 
These long-term findings support efforts to vaccinate this population against HPV before 
exposure.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: The 4-valent 
human papillomavirus (4vHPV) vaccine is clinically 
effective, immunogenic, and well-tolerated in 
preadolescents and adolescents. As a prophylactic 
vaccine administered before sexual debut, long-
term persistence of efficacy and immunogenicity is 
desired.
What this study adds: This is the longest 
follow-up study of the 4vHPV vaccine to date. 
These 10-year follow-up data of the 4vHPV vaccine 
support greater, widespread implementation of HPV 
vaccination in preadolescents and adolescents.

 Ten years have passed since the 
licensure of Gardasil (4-valent 
human papillomavirus [4vHPV] 
[types 6, 11, 16, and 18] vaccine, 
recombinant [Merck & Company Inc; 
Kenilworth, NJ]) in the United States. 
This prophylactic vaccine prevents 
cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal 
cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 
18, genital warts caused by HPV 
types 6 and 11, and precancerous 
cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal 
lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, 
and 18.1 Although approved for both 
boys and girls who are 9 to 26 years 
old, initiating the vaccination series 
before exposure to HPV is important. 
Earlier vaccination produces more 
robust antibody responses, 
2 and the 
impact of early vaccination (in grades 
8 and 9; at ∼13 years old) in reducing 
cervical dysplasia and genital warts 
is already evident ∼4 years later.3 
When administered between 11 and 
12 years old, the HPV vaccination 
series can be initiated along with 
the meningococcal and tetanus 
toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, 
and acellular pertussis, absorbed 
vaccines.4 However, the vaccine 
must enable a sustained immune 
response and long-term effectiveness 
to protect individuals because HPV 
acquisition risks are greater later in 
life.
Given the long latency between 
the acquisition of HPV and the 
development of precancer and 
cancer, a long-term follow-up 
(LTFU) program was established to 
monitor vaccine immunogenicity, 
effectiveness, and safety in 
participants of the 4vHPV 
vaccine clinical studies. This was 
particularly important for studies in 
preadolescents and adolescents, in 
whom the vaccine was administered 
before the average age of sexual 
debut (and potential HPV exposure)5 
and several years before the typical 
diagnosis of cervical and genital 
precancers and cancers. LTFU studies 
are critical to understanding the 
potential real-world impact of HPV 
vaccination.
Clinical follow-up studies of 4 and 
6 years in young and mid-adult 
women (15–26 years old, [Females 
United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/
Ectocervical Disease (FUTURE) II] 
and 24–45 years old [FUTURE III]) 
have demonstrated durable antibody 
responses, long-term safety, and 
sustained effectiveness against the 
development of cervical and/or 
genital precancers and cancers.6, 
 
7 
Durable immunity and safety through 
8 years postvaccination have also 
been documented for adolescents. In 
addition to follow-up for cervical and 
genital precancers and cancers, this 
younger population has also been 
assessed for HPV infection of the 
cervix and genital tract as a measure 
of vaccine effectiveness.8 The 
data for up to 8 years of follow-up 
have been reassuring, and to date, 
there has been no indication that a 
booster dose for the 4vHPV vaccine 
will be required among vaccinated 
individuals.8
To understand the extended 
durability of the 4vHPV vaccine, we 
determined the immunogenicity, 
effectiveness, and safety of the 
4vHPV vaccine after 10 years of 
follow-up in the preadolescent and 
adolescent population. Favorable 
evidence-based findings should 
provide additional reassurance for 
widespread early vaccination.
Methods
base study
The base study V501-018 was a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, multicenter study to 
assess the safety and immunogenicity 
of the 4vHPV vaccine (types 6, 11, 16, 
and 18) among 9- to 15-year-old boys 
and girls, as previously described.9 
Subjects were randomly assigned in 
a 2:1 ratio to receive 3 intramuscular 
injections of either the 4vHPV 
vaccine (early vaccination group 
[EVG]) or a placebo at months 0, 2, 
and 6. At the end of the base study 
(month 30), the placebo recipients 
were offered the 4vHPV (at months 
30, 32, and 36; catch-up vaccination 
group [CVG]). An institutional review 
board for each clinical site approved 
the study protocol. At enrollment, 
informed consent was obtained from 
each participant and his or her legal 
guardian.
LtFu study
The LTFU study was conducted at 
34 sites across 9 countries spanning 
4 continents. All subjects who 
received the 4vHPV vaccine during 
or at the end of the base study were 
offered participation in the LTFU, 
and separate consent was required 
for participation. The LTFU study 
extended the follow-up period to 
10 years. No study vaccinations 
were provided within the context 
of this LTFU study. There was no 
placebo group in the LTFU study 
because after the 4vHPV vaccine 
became licensed, it was deemed to be 
unethical to not offer the vaccine to 
LTFU participants.
Immunogenicity
The immunogenicity end points 
in the LTFU were serum antibody 
geometric mean titers (GMTs) 
and percent seropositivity to HPV 
types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Immune 
responses were measured by 2 
separate immunoassays developed 
in house and used across the 
4vHPV development program. The 
competitive Luminex immunoassay 
(cLIA) was used in the base and LTFU 
studies and the total immunoglobulin 
G (IgG) Luminex immunoassay 
(LIA) was added for the LTFU 
only, as previously described.8, 
 
10, 
 
11 
Seropositivity by the cLIA to vaccine-
HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 was 
defined as cLIA titers (mU/mL) of 
≥20, 16, 20, and 24, respectively.
Effectiveness
Because there were no placebo 
groups, vaccine efficacy

 measurements could not be 
assessed. Instead, the effectiveness 
of vaccination with the 4vHPV 
vaccine was assessed by calculating 
the incidence of disease end points 
(EVG and CVG cohorts). These rates 
were compared with the observed 
incidence rates in previous efficacy 
studies within the 4vHPV vaccine 
program at Merck & Company 
Inc. The base study evaluated 
immunogenicity only. Effectiveness 
was assessed only in the follow-up 
period. Analyses for effectiveness 
included assessment for genital warts 
and cervical and genital precancers 
and cancers as well as persistent 
infection. Anal and oropharyngeal 
end points were not included. 
Because cervical lesions may take 
longer to manifest in a young 
population, 4vHPV vaccine type  
(6, 11, 16, and 18) persistent infection 
(defined by the detection of HPV by 
polymerase chain reaction [PCR] 
in serial sampling over a specified 
duration) was assessed. Effectiveness 
sampling started at 3.5 years (month 
42) with follow-up visits occurring 
every 6 months thereafter.6, 
 
8, 
 
12 The 
disease effectiveness end points 
were adjudicated by the HPV Vaccine 
Program Pathology Panel using the 
same procedures as in previous 
studies of the 4vHPV vaccine in 
female and male subjects aged 16 to 
26 years.6, 
7,

Safety
Deaths and serious adverse events 
deemed by the study investigators 
to be related to the vaccine or 
procedure were captured for all 
subjects in the LTFU study.
statistical analysis
The primary approach to the analysis 
of immunogenicity and effectiveness 
was per-protocol conducted among 
subjects who received all 3 doses of 
the vaccine and were seronegative 
for all 4 vaccine HPV types before 
vaccination (day 1 for the EVG and 
month 30 for the CVG) and had at 
least 1 follow-up visit with PCR data 
collected during the LTFU study. An 
additional criterion of not having 
a sexual debut until after receiving 
the third dose of the 4vHPV vaccine 
(as defined by the subject using a 
personal report) was added. Sexual 
activity was defined as having had 
vaginal and/or anal intercourse and/
or oral sex and/or genital-to-genital 
contact.
Immunogenicity in this population 
was summarized at 3 time points  
to include follow-up data through  
6 years (month 72), 8 years (month 
96), and 10 years (month 120). 
Anti-HPV responses to each of the 
4 vaccine HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 
18) were summarized by sex (male 
or female) and age at enrollment 
as GMTs and seropositivity rates 
with associated 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). Effectiveness was 
summarized separately for girls and 
boys at 10 years, and the cumulative 
and current incidence rates for 
effectiveness end points were 
computed along with the associated 
95% CIs. Effectiveness against 
nonvaccine types was assessed in 
a population that included subjects 
who were ≥16 years of age, received 
at least 1 dose of the 4vHPV vaccine, 
and had at least 1 follow-up visit. 
These subjects, who might have 
been seropositive at enrollment or 
might have had positive results for 
the quadrivalent HPV vaccine types 
(6, 11, 16, and 18) on PCR assay, 
represented the general population 
of boys and girls. Summaries were 
provided by vaccination group, sex 
(male or female), and age group. 
These are observational data that 
describe trends in the vaccinated 
population.
ResuLts
subject disposition
A total of 1245 (EVG, n = 821; CVG,  
n = 424) subjects were enrolled  
in the LTFU extension. Of these  
subjects, 803 (∼65% [803 of 1245])  
completed 10 years of follow-up 
postvaccination (EVG, n = 528;  
CVG, n = 275), as shown in Fig 1.  
Of subjects, 1134 (∼91%; EVG,  
n = 799; CVG, n = 335) had at least 1 
immunogenicity follow-up, and 681 
subjects (∼55%; EVG, n = 451; CVG, 
n = 230) had at least 1 follow-up visit 
with effectiveness data. The median 
follow-up time postvaccination was 
9.9 years for the EVG and 7.4 years 
for the CVG. Effectiveness, which was 
only measured after age 16 years 
or the start of sexual activity, was 
assessed for 5.5 years in both the 
EVG and CVG. Characteristics of study 
subjects at the time of vaccination 
have been described previously.8 
Subjects in the CVG who were older 
at the time of vaccination compared 
with subjects in the EVG (14.5 vs 11.9 
years, respectively) were also more 
likely to be seropositive for vaccine-
type HPV at the time of vaccination 
(15.9% vs 1.7%, respectively).
immunogenicity
The anti-HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 
responses (GMTs and seropositivity) 
measured by the cLIA assay over 
time for all subjects in the EVG 
and CVG are summarized in Fig 2 
and Supplemental Table 5. In the 
per-protocol populations of both 
cohorts, the antibody responses 
peaked at month 7 then plateaued 
and persisted over the 10 years of 
follow-up. The proportion of subjects 
who remained seropositive at the 
end of the study remained high. Both 
the GMTs and percent seropositivity 
remained similar between month 96 
and 120 (Supplemental Table 5).
Given the importance of vaccinating 
subjects before sexual debut 
and potential HPV exposure, the 
durability of the immune response 
was compared between the younger 
(preadolescents, 9–12 years old) 
and older (adolescents, 13–16 years 
old) subgroups of the cohort. The 
preadolescents had 38% to 65% 
higher GMTs of the 4vHPV vaccine 
types (6, 11, 16, and 18) at month 
7, which remained 16% to 42%

 higher at 10 years compared with 
the adolescents. When comparing the 
corresponding proportion of subjects 
who were seropositive between 
preadolescents and adolescents, 
there were no differences at month 
7 and small differences at 10 years 
(Supplemental Table 5). Overall 
GMTs of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 were 
similar between girls and boys both 
at month 7 and at 10 years. However, 
comparing the 2 age groups among 
girls, the preadolescents had 63% 
to 93% higher GMTs compared 
with adolescents at month 7, and 
this difference persisted to 10 years 
(54%–73% higher GMTs among 
preadolescents versus adolescents). 
This early difference was also 
noted among boys at month 7 
(15%–44% higher GMTs among the 
preadolescents versus adolescents); 
however, it did not persist to  
10 years.
The kinetics of the immune response 
as well as the proportion of subjects 
who remained seropositive were 
comparable between the HPV cLIA 
and IgG LIA assays for HPV 6, 11, 
and 16. For HPV types 6, 11, and 16, 
89% to 96% of subjects remained 
seropositive through 10 years 
postvaccination. For HPV 18, a 
much higher percentage of subjects 
remained seropositive by total IgG 
LIA at 10 years compared with the 
cLIA assay, as shown in Table 1.
effectiveness
Given the young age of the 
population vaccinated, vaccine 
efficacy was not assessed in the 
V501-018 base study. Vaccine 
effectiveness was ascertained in the 
follow-up study and was found to 
be maintained in the preadolescent 
and adolescent population over 
the 10 years postvaccination. No 
breakthrough disease in the form 
of genital warts or cervical and/or 
genital precancers and cancers was 
observed over the 10-year follow-up 
period.
Because cervical lesions may take 
longer to manifest in this young 
population, vaccine-type HPV (6, 
11, 16, and 18) persistent infection 
(defined by the detection of HPV by 
PCR in serial sampling over a specified 
duration) was also assessed. A total 
of 10 cases of persistent infection 
lasting for ≥6 months to HPV types 
6, 11, 16, and 18 were detected over 
the 10 years of follow-up. Of these, 
there were 2 cases that were detected 
with a duration of ≥12 months. As 
shown in Table 2, 4 cases (EVG, 3; 
CVG, 1) of HPV-16–related persistent 
infection of 6 months’ duration were 
observed in girls. The incidence 
rate of vaccine-type HPV persistent 
infection in both the EVG and CVG 
was found to be 0.3 per 100 person-
years (EVG 95% CI: 0.1–0.8; CVG 
95% CI: 0.0–1.5). In boys, 6 cases 
(EVG, 5; CVG, 1) of 4vHPV vaccine 
type 6, 11, 16, and 18 persistent 
infection of 6 months’ duration were 
observed. Of the 6 cases, 3 were 
related to HPV-6, 2 were related to 
HPV-16, and another coinfection of 
HPV-6 and HPV-16 was noted. The 
incidence rates of persistent infection 
of 6 months duration were 0.6 per 
100 person-years in the EVG (95% 
CI: 0.2–1.5) and 0.4 per 100 person-
years in the CVG (95% CI: 0.0–2.0). 
Because most cases of HPV genital 
infection clear spontaneously, an 
additional analysis was performed for 
HPV detection, which persisted over 
a prolonged period (12 months). Of 
the 10 cases of 6-month persistent 
infection identified, only 2 cases in the 
EVG population were detected over 
a 12-month period (1 was related to

To evaluate the entire spectrum of 
HPV in adolescents, infection and 
disease because of high-risk HPV 
types not contained in the vaccine 
were also assessed. As shown in 
 
Table 3, among girls, nonvaccine HPV 
types led to 151 cases of 6-month 
persistent infection and/or disease 
(EVG, 90 cases; CVG, 61 cases). 
Among boys in the same group, 
53 cases of nonvaccine HPV type–
related 6-month persistent infection 
(EVG, 34 cases; CVG, 19 cases) were 
observed, but no external genital 
lesion (EGLs) were reported.
This study reported similar rates 
of sexual activity compared with 
young adults in other studies in the 
4vHPV vaccine clinical development 
program. The rates of new sexual 
partner acquisition were higher 
among boys as compared with girls. 
Among boys, the rate of acquisition 
of new partners was similar between 
the EVG and CVG, whereas among 
girls, the rate of acquisition of new 
partners was higher in the CVG.

 also evaluated as a marker of sexual 
activity. The overall rate of Chlamydia 
was 2.7 to 3.2 per 100 person-years, 
and the overall rate of gonorrhea 
was 0.4 to 0.6 per 100 person-years. 
The incidence of Chlamydia and 
gonorrhea was similar between boys 
and girls and among subjects in the 
EVG and CVG.
The incidence of low-grade 
abnormalities in cervical cytology 
among adolescent girls was slightly 
higher than corresponding incidences 
in other age groups (Table 4).  
However, similar incidence rates 
of high-grade cervical cytology 
abnormalities were observed.
safety
The administration of the 4vHPV 
vaccine to preadolescent and 
adolescent girls and boys was 
generally safe and well tolerated 
through 10 years postvaccination. 
No new safety events were reported 
beyond published data at the 8-year 
(month 96) interval.8
discussion
These end-of-study data demonstrate 
the long-term immunogenicity, 
effectiveness, and safety of the 
4vHPV vaccine 10 years after its 
administration to preadolescents 
and adolescents. Importantly, the 
highest anti- HPV antibody titers 
were observed in subjects who 
received the vaccine at a younger age 
(9–12 years). These findings justify 
efforts to vaccinate subjects at the 
earliest opportunity. Moreover, by 
vaccinating preadolescents before 
exposure to HPV, the full potential 
of the vaccine is more likely to be 
realized. Certainly, older adolescents 
and adults who have not been 
previously vaccinated should receive 
the HPV vaccine, but greater efforts 
must be exerted to ensure that 
the majority of preadolescents are 
successfully vaccinated.
Our data demonstrated a sustained 
maintenance of seropositive status

Downloaded from 
 for vaccine recipients to HPV 
types 6, 11, and 16, thus providing 
evidence for durable immune 
responses. Fewer subjects remained 
seropositive for HPV-18; however, 
the clinical relevance of this 
difference is not clearly understood 
in the absence of an immune 
correlate of protection. The subjects 
determined to be seronegative to 
the 4vHPV vaccine types (6, 11, 16, 
and 18) at 10 years postvaccination 
continued to be protected from 
vaccine-type HPV-related cervical 
and genital lesions, suggesting a 
role of immune memory in vaccine 
protection.14
The 4vHPV vaccine was extremely 
effective in preventing HPV-related 
cervical and genital neoplasia for 
10 years after vaccination, with no 
cases of HPV-related disease being 
detected in the study. The clinical 
significance is notable because none 
of the subjects who were vaccinated 
as preadolescents or adolescents 
developed genital warts or low-
grade or high-grade cervical, vaginal, 
vulvar, or other genital cancer 
precursors caused by any of the 4v 
HPV vaccine types (6, 11, 16, and 18) 
during the 10 years of observation. 
Thus, the 4vHPV vaccine was highly 
effective in preventing HPV vaccine–
related cancer precursor lesions. 
Additionally, the rates of sexual 
activity and HPV exposure were 
similar to those seen in previous 
4vHPV vaccine clinical programs, 
thus indicating that the reductions 
in vaccine-type HPV infection and 
disease are not a result of decreased 
sexual activity and overall HPV 
exposure among adolescents in the 
LTFU study. If health care providers 
improve the rate of HPV vaccination, 
most aggressive types of cervical and 
genital neoplasia can be prevented.
The incidence of persistent infection 
with vaccine-type HPV (6, 11, 16, and 
18) was also managed as a secondary 
end point of the LTFU study. Here, 
we report 4 cases of HPV-16–related 
persistent infection (6 months’ 
duration) in girls and 6 cases of HPV 
type 6- and 16-related persistent 
infection (6 months’ duration) in 
boys. Detection rates of persistent 
infection were similar in this 
population to what was observed in 
vaccinated young adult women (ages 
16–23 years at vaccination) and men 
(ages 16–26 years at vaccination).13, 
 
15  
In all 10 cases of persistent infection, 
vaccine-type HPV (6, 11, 16, and 18) 
was detected concurrently with 1 
or more nonvaccine HPV types, and 
the detection of the nonvaccine-
type HPV persisted longer than the 
detection of vaccine-type HPV. In 
contrast, persistent infection and 
disease continued to occur because 
of nonvaccine HPV types, supporting 
continued HPV exposure and 
infection in the population.
As is typical with the young 
population, a high incidence of 
low-grade abnormalities in cervical 
cytology was observed in this study.16 
A high rate of new partner acquisition 
and HPV infection in adolescents may 
explain the increased detection of 
these abnormalities in adolescents 
at a time when they are not routinely 
screened. However, these findings 
demonstrate the vulnerability and 
potentially serious risks adolescents 
face even at an early age. In addition, 
the detection of lower genital tract 
abnormalities at this young age 
underscores the importance of early 
HPV vaccination of all preadolescents 
and adolescents.
The limitations of this LTFU study 
are inherent to the study design. 
We were not able to manage an 
unvaccinated group because base 
study placebo recipients were 
designed to be offered vaccination 
once the efficacy, immunogenicity, 
and safety of the 4vHPV vaccine 
were established in this population 
and the vaccine was licensed. 
Additionally, not all of the subjects

who participated in the base study 
chose to continue to the LTFU. 
The mobility of the age group (for 
school, jobs, etc) as well as the 
addition of genital examinations 
to assess efficacy (which were 
not present in the base study) 
decreased subject participation in 
the LTFU. Finally, this study was  
not designed to manage 
oropharyngeal and anal disease  
end points.
Our long-term study findings 
support the durability of 
immunogenicity, protection,  
and safety of HPV vaccines and 
should help to dismiss any lingering 
doubts about the safety and 
durability of HPV vaccine-induced 
protection. Although the 4vHPV 
vaccine was effective in preventing 
HPV types 16- and 18-induced 
infections and lesions, some 
vaccinated subjects subsequently 
developed infections and lesions 
caused by high-risk HPV types not 
contained in the vaccine. A 9-valent 
HPV (9vHPV) (types 6, 11, 16, 18, 
31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) vaccine 
(Gardasil 9; Merck & Company Inc, 
Kenilworth, NJ) is now available  
to provide protection against the 
HPV types already covered by  
the 4vHPV vaccine (types 6, 11, 
16, and 18) and the next 5 most 
common oncogenic types associated 
with cervical cancer worldwide 
(types 31, 33, 45, 52, 58). In a 
clinical trial conducted in women 
16 to 26 years of age (Protocol 
V503-001, NCT00543543), 
the 9vHPV vaccine effectively 
prevented infection and disease 
caused by HPV types 31, 33, 45, 
52, and 58 as well as noninferior 
immunity to the 4vHPV vaccine 
for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.17 
The 10-year effectiveness and 
immunogenicity follow-up data 
on the 9vHPV vaccine will not be 
available for some years. Therefore, 
LTFU data from the 4vHPV vaccine 
should be translatable to the 9vHPV 
vaccine and are the closest it 
comes to estimating the long-term 
effectiveness of both the 4vHPV  
and 9vHPV vaccines.
Continued evidence on the long-term 
effectiveness, immunogenicity, and 
safety of the 4vHPV vaccine should 
support efforts to achieve HPV 
vaccination coverage comparable to 
those now seen with other pediatric 
vaccines.
concLusions
The 4vHPV vaccine continues to be 
highly effective, immunogenic, and 
safe in adolescent and preadolescent 
subjects after 10 years.
