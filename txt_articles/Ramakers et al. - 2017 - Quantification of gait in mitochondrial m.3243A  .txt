Abstract
Background: More than half of the patients harbouring the m.3243A > G mutation were found to have trouble
maintaining balance when walking in a recent study by our group. Others demonstrated that these patients had
an abnormal gait pattern, as quantified by gait analysis. Gait analysis is an emerging method to quantify subtle
changes in walking pattern, also during therapeutic interventions. Therefore, we aimed to test the reliability and
reproducibility of gait analysis and select the most suitable protocol for this group of patients using a GAITRite
electronic walkway. Four different protocols were tested: normal walking, dual task, post exercise and after a ten
minutes of rest.
Results: In total 36 patients with the m.3243A > G mutation and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in this study.
Overall high intra class correlation coefficients were found in all experimental conditions for both patients and
healthy controls indicating good reproducibility. Marked differences in gait between patients and controls were
observed and were in line with the only available exploratory study performed. There was a good correlation
between both the overall NMDAS score, NMDAS subscale scores, both markers for disease severity, and specific
gait parameters.
Conclusions: The observed reliability of the test makes GAITRite a suitable instrument for intervention studies in
patients with mitochondrial disease.

Background
Over 1150 genes encoding mitochondrial proteins have
been identified with the use of mass spectrometry of
mitochondria [1, 2]. Mutations in genes encoding these
mitochondrial proteins, like those involved in oxidative
phosphorylation, can cause mitochondrial disease. Ab-
normal mitochondrial functioning has a major impact,
especially prone being high energy dependent tissues
and organs like skeletal muscles and the brain [3]. With
an estimated total prevalence of roughly 1 in 4300
adults, mitochondrial disease is one of the most com-
mon inherited neuromuscular conditions of metabolism
[4]. Among these mutations the m.3243A > G mutation
is one of the most prevalent [4].
Up until this date there is no definite clinical beneficial
treatment for mitochondrial patients [4]. A recent
Cochrane review investigated the effect of various treat-
ment strategies in patients with mitochondrial disease
and concluded that treatment efficacy was difficult to
assess as a result of large variations in disease pheno-
type and different study endpoints. It was suggested
that future studies should therefore focus on as much
as possible homogenous signs and symptoms present in
these patients.
Recently, we investigated the different clinical symp-
toms in a group of mitochondrial patients harbouring
the m.3243A > G mutation. This genotype is associated
with a plethora of symptoms including e.g. diabetes mel-
litus, myopathy, deafness, cardiomyopathy and MELAS
(mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and
stroke-like episodes) syndrome [5]. The results of our
study indicated that about 54% of the subjects in this
study had a decreased exercise tolerance and 51% had
trouble maintaining balance while walking [6]. Recently,

 Galna et al. quantified the gait of these patients and
showed that patients with the m.3243A > G mutation
have an abnormal walking pattern compared to healthy
controls [7].
The GAITRite is used in numerous other diseases
and conditions including Parkinson’s disease, stroke,
cerebellar ataxia and aging [8–13]. It is an emerging
method to quantify subtle changes in walking pattern
[8–11] also during therapeutic interventions [12, 13].
However, there are no previous studies that focused
on the reliability of these measurements in mitochon-
drial patients.
This study aims to optimize the protocol to quantify gait
patterns in mitochondrial patients with the m.3243A >
G mutation.
Methods
This prospective study aims to select the most reliable
and valid gait-quantification protocol by testing four
different walking conditions in mitochondrial patients.
We examined the reliability of the gait pattern analysis
of a clinically heterogeneous group of mitochondrial
patients with the m.3243A > G mutation as well as
healthy controls during either normal walking, during
dual tasks and after exercise. Secondly, we compared
the gait patterns of the mitochondrial patients with
healthy controls to gain more insight in the difference
between both groups. We hypothesized that gait assess-
ment in patients is reliable and we expected the best re-
liability in the normal walking condition. Finally, we
hypothesized that the gait characteristics of the patients
differ from healthy controls.
We quantified gait characteristics of 39 patients above
the age of 18 harbouring the m.3243A > G mutation in
the tRNAleu (UUR) and 50 healthy adult controls. Exclu-
sion criteria for this study were: any other disease
causing abnormal gait pattern (e.g. orthopaedic, other
neurological or neuromuscular diseases) and the in-
ability to complete a 3-min walking test. The hetero-
plasmy levels in patients were evaluated in blood,
urine and buccal smears and/or skeletal muscle biopsy
samples. Participants were not given or encouraged to
take
any
additional
medication
or
supplements
throughout this study. However, we did not keep track
of non-prescribed medication or supplement intake.
The ethics committee of Arnhem-Nijmegen region,
The Netherlands, approved this study. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
Measurements
Upon arrival height and weight were measured and pa-
tients were screened on disease status using the Newcastle
Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) [14]. The
NMDAS constitutes a validated method to monitor the
clinical expression of mitochondrial disease and to
follow-up the course of disease in time. The NMDAS
consists of the following four sections. 1) Current func-
tion, gives insight into the general functioning of pa-
tients in past four weeks. 2) System-specific involvement
uses a clinical history supplemented by specific informa-
tion to gain insight in the functioning of individual
organ-systems. 3) Current clinical assessment, a general
and neurological clinical examination, gives insight in
the current functional status of the patient. 4) Quality of
life, we used a Dutch translation of the Short Form-36
(SF-36) quality of life test.
Leg length was measured as true leg length, from the
Anterior Superior Iliac Spine (ASIS) towards the medial
malleolus on both sides. The force of the quadriceps
muscle (m. quadriceps) was assessed using a Micro-Fet
hand held dynamometer (Hoggan health industries, Salt
Lake City, USA). The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was per-
formed to measure dynamic and static balance [15]. A
portable GAITRite electronic walkway system was used
to quantify gait patterns (Platinum model GAITRite,
software version 4.7, CIR systems, USA). The system
was set up in a lab setting and consisted of a 7 m long
walkway with 2 m free walking space at both ends for
acceleration (Fig. 1).
Gait assessment
Participants were instructed to walk across the GAITRite-
mat at their self-selected pace under different conditions
(Fig. 2). Each measurement condition existed of three
walks (trials) across the mat without breaks in between.
Participants started with the normal walking condition, in
which they were given no further tasks other than walking
at their self-selected pace. After a one-minute break, the
participant was given the same instruction as with the
normal walking condition now with one additional task

walkway to ensure they would have a constant walking speed

 (e.g. subtracting 7 from 100 and beyond). After a five-
minute break, both the normal walking and the dual task
conditions were repeated with a 1 min break in between.
Subsequently, participants performed a 3-min walking dis-
tance test (3MWT), to induce tiredness. After a 1-min
break, participants were instructed to walk over the mat
without any other tasks (post exercise condition). This
measurement was repeated twice after a 1-min break
and a 10 min break, respectively. The last condition
(after the 10-min break) is thought of as a recovery
condition (i.e. does the participant recover from the
walking test and how does this affect the walking pat-
tern). The order of the protocol was fixed to prevent in-
fluences of the exercise-induced exhaustion with the
normal walking and dual task conditions.
Data processing
We’ve focused our gait analysis based on the model in-
troduced by Lord et al. in 2013 [13]. This model consists
of five domains for assessing gait including pace (step
length and step velocity), rhythm (step time), variability
(step length and step time variability), asymmetry (step
time asymmetry) and postural stability (step width, step
width variability and step length asymmetry) [13]. These
domains are also reflected in the clinical symptoms of
patients with the m.3243A > G mutation (e.g. losing bal-
ance, ataxic gait pattern). Mean velocity, step length,
step time and step width were calculated by the GAI-
TRite software automatically for each trial and for each
condition (Fig. 3). Variability was calculated as the root
of the mean variance of the left and right foot. Standard
deviations for step length, step time and step width were
therefore calculated per trial based on the individual
steps in the trial. Step time and step length asymmetry
was defined as the absolute difference between both feet.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation
unless otherwise specified. To test the reliability of the
gait parameters measured with the GAITRite, Intra-
class Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were calculated
for each study group, variable and condition. Since this
is an exploratory study, statistical significance has been
defined as p < 0 · 05. ICCs above 0 · 8 were defined as
‘good’ and above 0 · 9 ‘perfect’. Furthermore, we tested
differences between both study groups using the non-
parametrical Mann–Whitney U test in non-Gaussian
distribution, statistical significance has been defined as
p < 0 · 05 (two-tailed). Correlation analysis was carried
out between the NMDAS and the different gait charac-
teristics for the normal walking condition only. Sub-
scales of the NMDAS scoring for exercise intolerance,

condition consisted of three walks across the GAITRite walkway

 gait instability, myopathy and cerebral ataxia were
correlated with gait characteristics of the normal walk-
ing condition. Additionally, we tested the correlation
between the heteroplasmy levels in blood and urine
with the gait characteristics in the normal walking
condition.
Results
In total 36 out of 39 patients with the m.3243A > G
mutation and 50 healthy controls were included in the
final analysis of this study. Three patients had to be ex-
cluded from participation, of which two patients had
orthopaedic condition that caused an abnormal gait
pattern and one patient could not perform the tasks
that were given for the specific walking conditions (i.e.
3-min walking test and calculating). The physical char-
acteristics of the patients and controls and the disease
specific characteristics of the patients are presented in
Table 1. Patients were significantly older and shorter
compared to the adult control group but did not differ
significant in weight (Table 1). Furthermore, patients
scored lower on the BBS, walked a shorter distance
during the 3MWT and had a lower maximal force of
the m. quadriceps (Table 1).
Reliability
ICCs of the gait parameters for the different conditions
are presented in Table 2. All ICCs in both the patient
and control group were significant with a p-value <0 ·
001. The best ICCs were found in the post exercise con-
dition for the patient group and in the after resting con-
dition for the control group. Overall high ICCs were
found in all conditions, except for the step time variable
in the normal and dual task condition scored below 0 ·
70 in the patient group (Table 2).
Gait characteristics
Comparisons of the gait characteristics per group for
each condition are shown in Table 3. In all of the condi-
tions we found a significantly lower gait velocity and
shorter step length in the patient group. Furthermore,
patients had higher step width variability in all but the
post exercise condition whilst having a similar mean step
width. There were no significant differences in step time
and step length asymmetry in all conditions. Results also
show that both controls and patients tend to walk slow-
est during dual task conditions and the fastest during
the post exercise condition.
Correlation analysis
Higher scores in the NMDAS questionnaire, reflecting a
more severe disease status, was inversely correlated with
gait velocity and step length, and positively correlated
with step length variability and step length variability in
a normal walking condition (Table 4). However, the
NMDAS did not correlate with step width, step width
variability, step length asymmetry and both step time
and, step time asymmetry. All four of the examined
NMDAS subscales were negatively correlated with both
step velocity and step length. Furthermore, the gait in-
stability and cerebellar ataxia scales were positively cor-
related with step length variability, step time variability
and, step width variability. Step length asymmetry was
only positively correlated with the exercise intolerance
scale (Table 4). The heteroplasmy levels in both blood
and urine were not correlated with any of the gait pa-
rameters (data not shown).
NMDAS Subscale analysis
The patient group was subdivided in two smaller groups
based on their score on the Gait stability outcome in the
NMDAS questionnaire. The gait stability is based on the
patients walking performance irrespective of contribut-
ing factors such as for example ataxia or muscle weak-
ness. Patients were scored from 0 to 5 where 0 is normal
gait stability and 5 is unable to walk without support or
falls when standing. In our patient group 8 people had
normal gait stability (score 0) and 13 had near normal
gait stability (score 1; occasionally difficulties in turns).
For this sub analysis both groups were analysed as high
gait stability. The remaining patients scored either a 2
(occasionally of balance; n = 11) or a 3 (always off bal-
ance, occasionally falls; n = 3). One patient had no score
and was therefore excluded from this analysis. Patients
who scored a 2 or higher were analysed as low gait sta-
bility. The result of this comparison demonstrates that
the high gait stability group had a significantly higher
walking step velocity and step length whilst having no
significant difference in and step time. Furthermore,
the high gait stability group had a lower step length

scored zero points for these three subscales.
Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate
the reliability of gait analysis in a group of mitochondrial
patients with the m.3243A > G mutation. In accordance
with our hypothesis, the results show that all gait pa-
rameters can be measured reliably in a group of adult
patients with the m.3243A > G mutation and healthy
controls using the GAITRite electronic walkway. These
findings illustrate that gait measurements are a suitable
instrument for intervention studies in patients with the
m.3243A > G mutation.
We have tested the gait parameters in four different
designs to optimize the protocol for measuring gait in
patients with the m.3243A > G mutation. Overall high
ICCs were found in all conditions for both patients and
control subjects which indicates that the measurements
can be reproduced reliably. The highest ICCs for the pa-
tient group were found in the post exercise condition
and in the after rest condition for the control group.
These findings are not in accordance with our initial ex-
pectation; we hypothesized that the normal walking con-
dition would have the highest ICCs. The high ICCs
during the post exercise condition in the patient group
might be a result of the 3MWT in which participants
had to walk as fast as possible, which might have led
to a steadier pace. After the 3MWT participants got
one-minute rest after which they had to walk over the
mat. Our results show that people walk faster during
the post exercise condition and have a less variable gait
pattern, which possibly resulted in higher ICCs. The
lowest ICCs were found during the dual task condition
in both the patient and control group. The lower ICCs
during the dual task condition could be due to the dis-
traction of the dual task while walking [16].
Secondarily we aimed to investigate the differences in
gait between patients with the m.3243A > G mutation
and healthy controls. In accordance with our hypothesis
the results show that patients have a different gait pat-
tern compared to healthy controls. Patients harbouring
the m.3243A > G mutation tend to walk significantly
slower in all conditions compared to healthy controls,
which is possible due to taking smaller steps. Addition-
ally, in three conditions the patients also had a signifi-
cant higher step width variability whilst no significant
difference in mean step width. Galna et al. previously
studied a group of eighteen patients with the m.3243A >
G mutation and compared their gait characteristics
during normal walking to healthy controls. In accord-
ance with their results we also found a reduced step
velocity, step length and increased step width variability
and step time variability [7]. The similarity in our re-
sults with the study of Galna et al. provide further
proof for the reliability of this test in measuring similar
abnormalities and is therefore suitable for intervention
studies. Furthermore, this finding might limit the im-
portance of the age difference between the groups in
our study. The higher step width variability in the pa-
tient group might indicate towards a reduced postural
stability during walking. Interestingly, we did not find a

 difference in step width variability in the post exercise
condition. It is possible that the lower step width vari-
ability is linked to an increase in step velocity similar to
the findings of temporal gait characteristics reported by
Schniepp et al. and Wuehr et al. in patients with cere-
bral ataxia [17, 18].
Results from the correlation analysis show that patients
with more severe clinical symptoms (i.e. a higher NMDAS
score) most likely walk slower and make shorter steps.
Additionally, these patients have higher step length vari-
ability and step time variability. However, the NMDAS
questionnaire consists of many subscales that are not all

total NMDAS questionnaire should therefore be inter-
preted with caution. Correlations of the four subscales
(exercise tolerance, gait stability, myopathy and, cerebral
ataxia) were carried out to provide more insight in the
correlation between gait specific disease symptoms and
the measured gait characteristics. These results indicate
that high scores on the subscales gait stability and cerebral
ataxia are associated with a lower gait performance. A
high gait stability score (i.e. instable gait) is associated with
decreased step velocity and step length, an increased step
time and gait variability. Additionally, the cerebellar ataxia
scale is also highly correlated with gait variability, step
velocity and, step length. It is possible that these two
scales interfere with each other as people with ataxia
often also have balance complaints [16]. Previous studies
in elderly at risk of falling also reported that low gait
velocities and high gait variability increases the risk of
falling (i.e. instable gait) [19, 20]. Our results confirm
that lower gait velocities and an increase in gait variability
is associated with an increase in gait instability.
In order to look further into the specificity of the
NMDAS gait stability subscale we divided the patient
group in two subgroups based on the results of their
scores. Patients scoring a zero or one on the subscale
were marked as high gait stability and patients with a
score of two or above were marked as low gait stability.
The high stability group walked significantly faster and
had a lower gait variability compared to the low stability
group. These results suggest that it is possible to differ-
entiate between patients with a good or bad gait stability
based on the subscales of the NMDAS. Patients within
the low gait stability group also scored worse on the
other subscales which might affect gait performance
such as myopathy, cerebellar ataxia and exercise toler-
ance. This finding suggests that the severity of decline in
gait is closely related to the manifestation of the different
clinical symptoms.

 Although we found high ICCs in all conditions this
study had some limitations in the dual task and post
exercise conditions. The dual task condition caused both
controls and patients to be distracted from walking
and in some cases participants nearly stopped during
walking to perform the given additional task. In those
cases, participants had to redo the whole task. This
might have contributed to a higher variation in this
condition. Our initial goal for the post exercise condi-
tion was to examine the effects of exhaustion on the
gait pattern in in patients with the m.3243A > G muta-
tion. Although the 3MWT was intensive for most partic-
ipants they were able to recover within the one-minute
resting period. It also seems that all participants adapted
the pace they had during the 3MWT which resulted in
higher step velocities and possible less variability.
Future studies might therefore need to incorporate a
different task (e.g. 30 s sit to stand task) to cause ex-
haustion in participants. However, one should always
consider the exhaustion which certain tasks might in-
duce. Therefore, it is important to standardize task ro-
tation to minimize carryover effects of exhausting
tasks. A final limitation of this research is the age mis-
match between the study groups. The mean age of the
control group is lower compared to the patient group.
Although the age range is comparable (21–71 years in
the control group and 31–68 years in the patient
group) the difference in age might have had an influ-
ence on the study results. Moreover, in our sample we
could not find a significant correlation between age and
any gait parameter in the control group nor the patient
group. Snijders et al. concluded in their review that gait
disorders are not a mere result of aging but often asso-
ciated with diseases common in elderly people [21].
Based on the results of the NMDAS we indeed observe
correlations between clinical symptoms and the differ-
ent gait parameters. Furthermore, participants in both
groups were aged below 60 years of age on average
which might have accounted for the low correlations.
About 85% of healthy people have close to normal gait
at the age of 60 [21].
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that gait can be measured
successful and reliable applying various designs in a
group of patients with the m.3243A > G mutation. The
recommended method for the assessment of gait is
the normal walking method because it resembles daily
life activity the most. Walking after exercise might
also provide useful information on performance after
tiredness however we were unsuccessful in reaching a
certain state of exhaustion in our participants. The
three-minute walking test in our study did influence
the gait parameters but not the reliability in our study.
We suggest that the GAITRite is a useful outcome
measure for mitochondrial patients and can be a valu-
able tool for future intervention studies in patients
with the m.3243A > G mutation.
