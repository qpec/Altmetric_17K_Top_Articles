Neuronal degeneration represents a pathogenetic hallmark after different brain insults, such as ischemia and status epilepticus (SE).
Excessive release of glutamate triggered by pathophysiologic synaptic activity has been put forward as key mechanism in this context. In
response to pathophysiologic synaptic activity, multiple signaling cascades are activated that ultimately initiate expression of specific
sets of genes, which may decide between neuronal survival versus death. Recently, a core set of genes [“activity-regulated inhibitor of
death” (AID) genes] including the transcription factor (TF) NPAS4 (neuronal PAS domain protein 4) has been found to provide activity-
induced protection against neuronal death caused by excitotoxic stimulation. However, the downstream targets of AID action mediating
neuroprotection remained so far unknown. Here, we have identified synaptotagmin 10 (Syt10), a vesicular Ca2� sensor, as the first
neuroprotective effector protein downstream of the TF NPAS4. The expression of Syt10 is strongly upregulated by pathophysiologic
synaptic activity after kainic acid (KA) exposure and its absence renders mouse hippocampal neurons highly susceptible to excitotoxic
insults. We found NPAS4 as critical for the increase in Syt10 levels and in turn the ability of NPAS4 to confer neuroprotection against
KA-induced excitotoxicity to be severely diminished in Syt10 knock-out neurons. In summary, our results point to an important role for
signaling of the NPAS4–Syt10 pathway in the neuronal response to strong synaptic activity as a consequence of excitotoxic insults.

Introduction
Excessive release of glutamate triggered by pathophysiologic syn-
aptic activity, a process referred to as excitotoxicity, has been
suggested as a key mechanism contributing to neuronal degener-
ation after transient or repetitive insults to the brain including
status epilepticus (SE; Lau and Tymianski, 2010; Bell and Hard-
ingham, 2011; Mehta et al., 2013). One consequence of the mul-
tiple signaling cascades activated by pathophysiologic synaptic
activity is the initiation of specific gene expression programs,
which in turn critically determine the decision between neuronal
death or survival (Hardingham and Bading, 2010). Recently, a
core set of less than a dozen genes has been identified that protects

induced transcriptional regulator NPAS4 and the vesicular Ca2�-sensor protein synaptotagmin 10 (Syt10). Syt10 is required for
NPAS4 to protect hippocampal neurons against excitotoxic cell death. NPAS4 in turn controls the activity of the Syt10 gene, which
is strongly induced by pathophysiologic activity. Our results uncover an entirely unexpected, novel function of Syt10 underlying
the response of neurons to pathophysiologic activity and provide new therapeutic perspectives for neurological disorders.

 hippocampal and cortical neurons, both
in vitro and in vivo, from different forms
of cell death. Excitotoxic stimulation in-
duced a transcript signature designated as
“activity-regulated inhibitor of death”
(AID) genes in response to transient in-
sults, including ischemia or kainic acid-
induced SE (KA-SE; Zhang et al., 2009,
2011). The AID cluster consists mainly of
transcriptional regulators with neuronal
PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4) as func-
tional key component (Zhang et al.,
2009). It has been put forward that AID
genes act by inducing the transcription
of target genes that then execute neuro-
protection but to date the molecular iden-
tity of these downstream target genes has
not been resolved.
Intriguingly, the functional signifi-
cance of NPAS4 is not restricted to AID-
cluster control. It also plays a role in the
regulation of gene programs mediating
synaptic plasticity in the brain (Maya-
Vetencourt, 2013; Benito and Barco,
2015; Nonaka et al., 2014). NPAS4 is an
early response transcription factor of syn-
aptic activity whose expression is strongly
induced in excitatory and inhibitory neurons by Ca 2� influx
through voltage-gated channels but not by increased cAMP con-
centrations or neurotrophic factors (Lin et al., 2008; Spiegel et al.,
2014). It has been suggested to function in a wide range of pro-
cesses ranging from the control of homeostatic plasticity, e.g., the
formation and maintenance of inhibitory synapses (Lin et al.,
2008; Spiegel et al., 2014), to the mechanisms underlying fear
memory (Ramamoorthi et al., 2011). Thereby, via activating dis-
tinct gene networks, NPAS4 seems to be involved in the region-
and cell-type-specific rewiring and plasticity in response to
sensory information in physiologic settings independent of AID
control after insults.
An intriguing AID downstream candidate gene that exhibits
a strong transient upregulation in the hippocampus early after
KA-SE, is synaptotagmin 10 (Syt10; Babity et al., 1997). This
dramatic increase in abundance is particularly striking, as under
physiologic conditions hippocampal Syt10 mRNA levels are very
low. Synaptotagmins are an evolutionary conserved family of
transmembrane proteins that play a role in the regulation of
membrane trafficking. Members of the synaptotagmin gene fam-
ily have been shown to be involved in the regulated exocytosis of
vesicles and to act as Ca 2� sensors in vesicular fusion processes
(Su
¨dhof, 2002; Gustavsson and Han, 2009; Cao et al., 2011;
Moghadam and Jackson, 2013). Accumulating evidence suggests
that defects in membrane trafficking are a hallmark of disease-
associated neurodegeneration (Glavan et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2013). Together, these findings have led to the hypothesis that
Syt10 fulfills a general role in seizure-induced injury responses
(Glavan et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2011). However, so far the func-
tion of Syt10 in these processes and in the hippocampus has not
been examined yet.
Here, we set out to investigate the link between the activity-
induced stimulation of Syt10 gene expression in the hippocam-
pus and its functional consequences. Our results show that both,
hyperexcitation and the overexpression of the AID transcription
factor NPAS4, increase Syt10 mRNA levels in hippocampal neu-
rons in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, NPAS4 is also required for
the activity-induced upregulation of Syt10 gene expression. Syt10
deficiency selectively decreases neuronal but not glial survival in
response to excitotoxic stimulation. Furthermore, the ability of
NPAS4 to confer neuroprotection against excitotoxicity is se-
verely diminished in Syt10 knock-out (KO) neurons. Thus, we
identify Syt10 as an essential component in the neuroprotective
signaling cascade downstream of NPAS4 in response to excito-
toxic stimulation.

Husbandry of mice and rats. Mice and rats were housed under a 12 h
light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. All experiments were
performed in accordance with the guidelines of the European Union and
the University of Bonn Medical Center Animal Care Committee. Time-
pregnant female Wistar rats were obtained from Charles River Labora-
tories. Constitutive Syt10 KO mice in which exon 2 had been deleted by
crossing conditional KO mice with a ubiquitous Cre-driver line were
kindly provided by T. Su
¨dhof (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Syt10
KO mice are viable and fertile and do not exhibit an overt phenotype
(Cao et al., 2011).
Primary hippocampal neuron cultures. Primary hippocampal neurons
were isolated from rat pups of both sexes as described previously (Zu
¨rner
et al., 2011). In brief, hippocampus was washed three to five times with
HBSS (Life Technologies) and then digested with trypsine (0.025 g/ml,
Life Technologies, for 20 min at 37°C). The incubation was performed
for 20 min at 37°C followed by three to five washing steps with HBSS and
the remaining DNA was digested with DNase I (0.001 g/ml; Roche).
Next, the tissue was dissociated using cannulas (3 times 0.9 � 40 mm; 3
times 0.45 � 23 mm). The solution was passed through a Nylon cell
strainer (100 �m; BD Biosciences) and the mesh was rinsed with 4–10 ml
basal medium eagle (BME; Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.5%
glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2% B-27, and 0.5
mM L-glutamine (all Life Technologies) to collect all cells. After counting,
the cells were plated on a 24-well cell culture plate at a density of 70,000
cells per 24-well. Neurons were cultured in a humidified incubator at
37°C and 5% CO2. Rat hippocampal neurons were stimulated with 25 �M
KA for 24 h at 13–14 DIV. To expose Syt10 KO neurons to secreted
factors from wild-type (WT) neurons during KA stimulation coverslips
with Syt10 KO neurons were placed in dishes containing WT neurons
during KA stimulation. IGF-1 rescue experiments were performed by
adding 1 or 100 ng/ml IGF-1 (human, PeproTech) to Syt10 KO neurons
simultaneously with KA. After 24 h, neurons were fixed, immunolabeled,
and analyzed by confocal microscopy.
DNA transfection and luciferase assay. Rat hippocampal neurons were
transfected in 24-well cell-culture plates in triplicates at 5 DIV using
Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol. During transfection, BME was replaced by reduced serum medium
(OPTI-MEM, Life Technologies) containing the transfection solution
and cells were kept at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 2 h, OPTI-MEM was
substituted for the original BME. The transfection mixture contained 0.1
�g of the pGL-promoter construct expressing firefly luciferase, 0.025 �g
pRL-TK with the Renilla gene (Promega), the indicated amount of ex-
pression plasmid of the respective transcription factor, and 1 �l Lipo-
fectamine in 50 �l OPTI-MEM. The mixture was incubated at room
temperature for 20 min and then added to the wells. Cells were collected
48 h after transfection and luciferase assays were performed using the
Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). For analysis of Re-
nilla and Firefly activities, a Glomax Luminometer (Promega) was used
and the results are presented as Firefly/Renilla relative luciferase units.
RNA isolation and RT-qPCR. mRNA from primary hippocampal neu-
rons or from the microdissected CA1 region was isolated using Dyna-
beads mRNA DIRECT Micro Kit (Life Technologies) and cDNA was
synthesized using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Tech-
nologies) both performed following the manufacturer’s specifications.
The cDNA was used for quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) with the
Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix/ROX (Life Technologies) ac-
cording to the following protocol: the reaction volume of 6.25 �l con-
tained 3.125 �l Master Mix, 1.5 �l DEPC-H2O, 1.25 �l cDNA, and
0.1875 �l of each primer (10 pmol/ml; NPAS4 FW: 5�-GGTGTCTCAA

After preincubation at 95°C for 10 min, 40 PCR cycles (15 s at 95°C, 60 s
at 59°C, and 40 s at 72°C) were performed on an ABI Prism 9700HT
system (Life Technologies). Experiments were performed in triplicates
and analysis was performed according to the ��Ct method. Expression
of the housekeeping gene Synaptophysin was used to normalize expres-
sion. All quantitative RT-PCR data were normalized to the respective
control condition.
Viral vector production. Recombinant AAV1/2 genomes were gener-
ated by large-scale triple transfection of HEK293 cells as described pre-
viously (van Loo et al., 2012). In brief, the adeno-associated virus (AAV)
plasmid of interest (rAAV-CMV-NPAS4-FLAG, rAAV-Syn-GFP, rAAV-
U6-scrambled-shRNA-hrGFP, rAAV-U6-shNPAS4-hrGFP), helper pla-
smids encoding rep and cap genes (pRV1 and pH21), and adenoviral
helper pF�6 (Stratagene) were transfected using standard CaPO4 trans-
fection. Cells were harvested �72 h after transfection. For crude viral
extracts, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml DMEM (Life Technolo-
gies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated FCS (Hyclone), 100
units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) and 2 mM glutamine. Then,
the cell suspension underwent four consequent freeze/thaw cycles and
after a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube
and stored at 4°C. For purified viruses, cell pellets were lysed in the
presence of 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 units/ml
Benzonase endonuclease (Sigma-Aldrich). rAAV viral particles were pu-
rified from the cell lysate by HiTrapTM heparin column purification (GE
Healthcare), and then concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Fil-
ters (Millipore) until a final stock volume of 500 �l was reached. Coo-

Infusion of AAV vectors. AAV viral particles were infused as described
previously (van Loo et al., 2012). In brief, male adult Bl6/N mice (�55 d
old; weight �20 g) were anesthetized with 6 mg/kg xylazine (Rompun;
Bayer) plus 90–120 mg/kg ketamine (Ketavet; Pfizer), intramuscularly.
Intracerebral injection of viral particles in the left and right CA1 hip-
pocampal region was performed stereotaxically at the coordinates �2
posterior, �2 lateral, and 1.7 ventral relative to bregma. Holes the size of
the injection needle were drilled into the skull, and 1 �l of viral suspen-
sion containing �10 8 transducing units was injected using a 10 �l Ham-
ilton syringe at a rate of 100 nl/min using a microprocessor-controlled
mini-pump (World Precision Instruments). After injection, the needle
was left in place for 5 min before withdrawal. Fourteen days after infec-
tion, mice were decapitated under deep isoflurane anesthesia (Forene),
and the CA1 region of hippocampi was microdissected. All experiments
were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the University of
Bonn Medical Center Animal Care Committee.
Infection of neurons with crude viral extracts. In the respective experi-
ments, neurons were infected 7–9 DIV with 20 �l crude viral extracts
until the neurons were prepared for further analyses.
Western blot. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and trans-
ferred to Whatman Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma-Aldrich).
For immunolabeling, membranes were blocked for 1 h with 2% fish
gelatin in 1� PBS at room temperature. Next, membranes were incu-
bated with the respective primary antibody at 4°C overnight in 1� PBS
with 0.1% Tween and the secondary antibody was used on the subse-
quent day in 1� PBS with 0.1% Tween and 0.01% SDS for 1 h at room
temperature. The following dilutions were used: rabbit anti-Syt10
(A.M.H.W and S.S., unpublished observations) 1:250; mouse anti-�-
actin 1:10,000 (ab8226, Abcam); goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800 (LI-COR
Biosciences) 1:20,000; goat anti-mouse IRDye 680 (LI-COR Biosciences)
1:20,000. Western blots were scanned with an Infrared imaging system
(Odyssey, LI-COR) and quantification of Western blots was performed
using the software AIDA.
Immunocytochemistry. Primary hippocampal neurons at 14 DIV were
fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed three times in 1�
TBS and incubated in blocking solution (0.3% Triton X-100, 10% NGS
in 1� TBS) for 1 h. Then, neurons were left overnight with primary
antibodies (mouse anti-MAP2, 1:500, Merck, Millipore; rabbit anti-
GFAP, 1:2000, Dako) at 4°C in blocking solution. On the following
morning, cells were washed three times with 1� TBS and subsequently
incubation with the secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor
488, 1:400; goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 647, 1:400, Life Technologies)
and with 0.1 �g/ml 4�,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Tech-
nologies) was performed in blocking solution for 45 min at room tem-
perature in the dark. Cover glasses were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Roth)
and imaged with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Eclipse Ti,
Nikon). Cells that were positive for MAP2 or GFAP were counted with
ImageJ and normalized to the total cell number (DAPI).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad
Prism 6.05 software. Results were tested for statistical significance using Stu-
dent’s t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Values
were considered significant at p � 0.05. All results were plotted as mean �
SEM. Sample size (n) per experiment was calculated using power analysis,
with parameters set within the accuracy of the respective experiment. All in
vitro experiments were independently repeated at least two times.
Results
Pathophysiologic synaptic activity elevates Syt10 mRNA and
protein levels in rat primary hippocampal neurons
Syt10 expression is strongly increased in the hippocampus after
KA-SE (Babity et al., 1997). To analyze relevant signaling cas-
cades in a controlled fashion, we turned to cell culture models in
which neuronal damage is induced by activity. First, we examined
whether different stimuli inducing strong synaptic activity in
vitro congruently upregulate Syt10 levels in cultured primary hip-
pocampal neurons. Depolarization of rat primary hippocampal
(RH) neurons following established protocols with potassium
chloride (KCl, 25 and 55 mM; Zhou et al., 2006; Pruunsild et al.,
2011) resulted in a significant increase in both Syt10 mRNA and
protein levels compared with the control condition as measured
by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1A) and quantitative immunoblot-
ting (Fig. 1B,C). We furthermore stimulated RH neurons with 25
�M KA for 24 h and observed a strong increase in Syt10 mRNA
levels after this treatment (Fig. 1D). These findings show that in
RH neurons expression of Syt10 is activated by pathophysiologic
synaptic activity after different stimulation paradigms.

 Syt10 knock-out neurons are more susceptible to KA-induced
cell death
One hallmark of pathophysiologic synaptic activity is the exces-
sive release of glutamate, which is associated with exocytotoxic
processes like neuronal dysfunction and cell death. To resolve the
functional relevance of pathophysiologic activity-induced Syt10
expression we next examined whether Syt10 deficiency alters sur-
vival of neurons after KA treatment. To this end, we incubated
primary hippocampal neurons from Syt10 littermate KO and WT
mice with 25 �M KA for 24 h. Subsequently, we immunolabeled
the cultures with antibodies against a neuronal [microtubule-
associated protein 2 (MAP2)] and a glial [glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP)] marker protein as well as with DAPI to mark the
cell nuclei (Fig. 2A). To quantify the cell survival rate the ratio of
MAP2- or GFAP-positive cells versus the total cell number
(DAPI) of the respective image was determined (Fig. 2B,C). This
analysis revealed that Syt10 deficiency strongly aggravated neu-
ronal cell death (Fig. 2B), whereas it had no impact on the sur-
vival of GFAP-positive glial cells (Fig. 2C). No difference between
WT and Syt10 KO was observed in the survival of hippocampal
neurons under basal conditions (Fig. 2D). These results further-
more demonstrate that the absence of Syt10 renders neurons
more susceptible to KA-induced excitotoxic insults indicating a
neuroprotective function for Syt10.
A secreted factor from WT neurons counteracts KA-induced
cell death of Syt10 KO hippocampal neurons
One potential explanation for the increased cell death of Syt10
KO neurons upon KA treatment could be the involvement of
Syt10 in the release of a neuroprotective factor. To test this hy-
pothesis, we stimulated Syt10 KO neurons with 25 �M KA for
24 h while exposing them to medium conditioned by WT neu-
rons under the identical stimulation paradigm. Syt10 KO neu-
rons that had been exposed to KA in the presence of secreted
factors from WT neurons had a significantly higher survival
rate than neurons that were treated with KA alone (Fig. 3A).
The rate of cell death under these conditions could be rescued
to the level observed in WT neuronal cultures after KA treat-
ment (Figs. 2B, 3B).
In the olfactory bulb Syt10 has been shown to be important
for the release of IGF-1 (Cao et al., 2011) and a neuroprotec-
tive function for IGF-1 has been reported for multiple types of
brain injury (Fernandez and Torres-Alema
´n, 2012). Thus, we
examined whether IGF-1 can rescue the neuronal cell death
induced by KA in Syt10 KO neurons. We performed the KA
stimulation of Syt10 KO neurons in the presence of 1 ng/ml or
100 ng/ml IGF-1, respectively. Neither concentration had a
significant effect on the level of cell death of Syt10 KO neurons
(Fig. 3C). Together, these data suggest that Syt10 is required
for the secretion of one or more neuroprotective factors in
response to KA-induced excitotoxicity.
The activity-induced upregulation of Syt10 gene expression is
mediated by regulatory elements in its promoter region
So far, the strong induction of Syt10 gene expression by signaling
cascades causing hyperexcitation and neuronal cell death, as well
as the increased susceptibility to KA-induced cell death of Syt10
KO neurons suggest that Syt10 is part of an activity-induced pro-
cess mediating neuroprotection. To identify this neuroprotective
signaling cascade we aimed at identifying the pathway activating
Syt10 gene transcription in response to activity. Therefore, we
first characterized the bioinformatically identified Syt10 core
promoter region (Fig. 4A) and potential upstream and down-
Figure 5.

 stream regulatory elements (40 kb up-
stream and 70 kb downstream of the Syt
10 start ATG; Fig. 4A). The corresponding
genomic fragments were cloned in front
of a luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 4B)
and transfected into RH neurons. Lu-
ciferase assays revealed that in accordance
with the tight regulation of endogenous
Syt10 expression the promoter region
contained both strong enhancing and re-
pressive regulatory elements within a re-
gion of �4.7 kb upstream of the ATG (Fig.
4B,D). We next examined whether also
the synaptic-activity responsive regula-
tory
element
is
present
within
this
genomic region. RH neurons were trans-
fected with luciferase reporter plasmids
under control of the Syt10 promoter frag-
ments �306, �1036, and �4713 and
promoter activity was measured after de-
polarization with 25 mM KCl compared
with control conditions (Fig. 4C). Mem-
brane depolarization increased the rela-
tive luciferase activity of the longest
promoter fragment �4713 but not of
the two shorter ones suggesting that this
genomic region contains transcription
factor binding sites that mediate the
activity-induced increase in Syt10 pro-
moter activity. Together, these results
show that the proximal promoter region
around the core promoter contains posi-
tive regulatory elements that are flanked
by repressive sequences. The upstream
enhancer region (�3675 to �4344) is
necessary and sufficient to stimulate Syt10
promoter activity in response to mem-
brane depolarization (Fig. 4D).
The activity-regulated transcription
factor NPAS4 stimulates Syt10
expression and enhances the
depolarization-induced transcriptional
response
To assess which TFs might be involved in
the hyperexcitation-induced transcrip-
tional upregulation of the Syt10 gene, we
searched for TF binding sites, which are
known to be differentially expressed after
synaptic activity, including CREB, mem-
bers of the activator protein 1 (AP1) tran-
scription factor family, myocyte enhancer
factor 2A, NPAS4, and upstream stimula-
tory factor 1 and 2 (USF1 and 2; Lyons and
West, 2011). For all of these TFs, we de-
tected predicted binding sites in the Syt10
promoter,
mainly
within
the
region
�4713 bp upstream of the ATG (Fig. 5A);
however, none of these sites was substan-
tially overrepresented within the Syt10
promoter compared with its frequency of

 identify functionally relevant TFs we next
examined their ability to increase endog-
enous Syt10 expression by overexpressing
the listed TFs in hippocampal neurons
and measuring Syt10 mRNA levels using
quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 5B).
Only NPAS4 and USF2 caused a signifi-
cant increase of endogenous Syt10 expres-
sion, whereas the other TFs did not show a
clear effect (Fig. 5B). As only �30% of
neurons were transfected, this indicates a
robust stimulatory effect of NPAS4 and
USF2 on Syt10 gene expression. To test
whether NPAS4 and USF2 are indeed able
to activate the activity-inducible Syt10
promoter in hippocampal neurons we
transfected the Syt10 �4713 luciferase
construct into RH neurons together with
a construct coding for NPAS4 or USF2.
Whereas USF2 expression had no effect,
NPAS4 increased luciferase activity of this
promoter fragment by 2.5-fold (Fig. 5C)
suggesting that Syt10 is a downstream tar-
get of NPAS4.
NPAS4 is known to be involved in me-
diating transcriptional responses induced
by synaptic activity (Lin et al., 2008;
Zhang et al., 2009; Pruunsild et al., 2011;
Ramamoorthi et al., 2011). To examine
whether NPAS4 plays a role in activating
the Syt10 expression triggered by hyperex-
citation we analyzed the effect of NPAS4 overexpression on the
depolarization-induced activity of the Syt10 promoter fragments
�306, �1036, and �4713. Activity of all three promoter frag-
ments was synergistically augmented by NPAS4 and membrane
depolarization (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these findings indicate that
NPAS4 is involved in mediating the activation of the Syt10 pro-
moter in response to activity.
Endogenous Syt10 is an in vitro and in vivo downstream
target of NPAS4
So far, the target genes of NPAS4 in mediating neuroprotec-
tion under activity-induced damage threat scenarios are enig-
matic (Zhang et al., 2009, 2011). Our present results suggest
that Syt10 may act as a downstream target gene in the NPAS4
regulated signaling cascade as potential mediator of neuropro-
tective action. To further scrutinize this hypothesis we tested
the relevance of activity-induced NPAS4 signaling dynamics
for endogenous Syt10 transcript kinetics. First, RH primary
neurons were transduced with rAAV particles expressing
NPAS4 and mRNA levels were measured 1 week after trans-
duction using quantitative RT-PCR. In accordance with the
promoter data a strong increase in NPAS4 mRNA levels (Fig.
6A) resulted in significantly increased endogenous Syt10
mRNA levels (Fig. 6B). Next, we analyzed whether Syt10 is also
in vivo a downstream target of NPAS4. To this end rAAV-
NPAS4 particles were injected into the mouse CA1 hippocam-
pal subregion and 2 weeks after injection NPAS4 and Syt10
transcript levels in this region were determined. Intriguingly,
also in vivo Syt10 gene expression levels are upregulated by
NPAS4 overexpression (Fig. 6C,D). We next examined
whether NPAS4 loss-of-function affects endogenous Syt10
gene expression. To this end we transduced RH neurons with
rAAV particles expressing either a published shRNA against
NPAS4 or a scrambled shRNA variant (Lin et al., 2008). Quan-
titative RT-PCR revealed a significant reduction in NPAS4, as
well as Syt10 mRNA levels in the presence of the NPAS4
shRNA compared with neurons that were transduced with a
scrambled shRNA (Fig. 6E,F).
These results strongly argue for Syt10 as a downstream target
in the activity-induced NPAS4 signaling cascade.
Syt10 is a neuroprotective downstream effector of NPAS4 in
activity-induced neuronal cell death
Overexpression of NPAS4 has previously been reported to rescue
activity-induced cell death of hippocampal neurons (Zhang et al.,
2009). To further support our idea that Syt10 is a functional
downstream effector of NPAS4 in the AID signaling cascade, we
examined the ability of NPAS4 overexpression to rescue activity-
induced cell death in hippocampal neurons from Syt10 KO mice.
For this purpose, Syt10 WT and KO hippocampal cultures were
transduced with rAAV particles expressing either GFP or NPAS4
and stimulated with KA or treated as controls. Intriguingly, the
subsequent analysis of MAP2-positive neurons showed that,
whereas NPAS4 almost completely rescued KA-induced cell
death in Syt10 WT neurons (Fig. 7A), NPAS4 did not have the
same effect in Syt10 KO neurons (Fig. 7B), where the majority of
neurons died (Fig. 7B,C). In summary, our results clearly dem-
onstrate that Syt10 acts downstream of NPAS4 in promoting
neuronal survival in response to strong synaptic activity.
Discussion
Excitotoxicity, the excessive stimulation of neurons by neu-
rotransmitters such as glutamate, not only leads to neuronal
damage and ultimately to cell death but also initiates neuropro-

 tective, i.e., compensatory mechanisms. However, the molecular
pathways mediating neuroprotection are still largely unknown.
In this study, we found Syt10 gene expression to be strongly up-
regulated both by KCl-induced membrane depolarization and by
exposure to KA. Neuronal activity, physiological and pathophys-
iological, engages a broad range of signaling pathways and tran-
scriptional regulators to trigger complex stimulus-regulated gene
expression programs (Lyons and West, 2011; Bading, 2013;
Benito and Barco, 2015). In these hierarchical genetic programs
NPAS4 is one of the first activity-induced TFs, which then initiate
a “second wave” of gene expression including both additional
immediate early transcription factors [e.g., c-fos, early growth
factor 1 (Egr1)] and downstream effector molecules [e.g.,
activity-regulated cytoskeletal protein 3.1 (Arc/Arg3.1), brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); Maya-Vetencourt, 2013;
Benito and Barco, 2015]. The dynamic architecture of the respec-
tive gene expression programs not only exerts substantial multi-
plicatory but also very specific effects that may critically
determine the fate of cells under pathologic stress conditions. In
recent years, NPAS4 has evolved as a key mediator of plasticity in
the nervous system. The transcriptional programs triggered by
NPAS4 are involved in diverse plasticity processes, for example in
memory formation, addiction, and the response to cerebral isch-
emia, seizures, and brain injury (Maya-Vetencourt, 2013). In
particular, NPAS4 has been shown to initiate a compensatory
mechanism during phases of enhanced excitability (Lin et al.,
2008) and to mediate acquired neuroprotection induced by syn-
aptic activity (Zhang et al., 2009). Gain- and loss-of-function
approaches have identified �300 downstream target genes of
NPAS4 representing a substantial leverage and in parallel diver-
sification potential of stress responses (Lin et al., 2008; Kim et al.,
2010; Bloodgood et al., 2013; Spiegel et al., 2014). Not surpris-
ingly, in vivo the gene program downstream of an individual
transcription factor strongly depends on the molecular context
and cellular state. To date the effector molecules regulating neu-
ronal survival of hippocampal neurons in response to excitotoxic
insults downstream of NPAS4 have not been resolved. Here we
demonstrate that Syt10 expression is stimulated by increased
NPAS4 levels in vitro and in vivo and that NPAS4 is required to
maintain endogenous Syt10 expression levels (Fig. 8A). The ob-
servation that in the absence of Syt10 the ability of NPAS4 to
confer neuroprotection against excitotoxic stimuli is severely di-
minished further supports Syt10 as the first bona fide NPAS4
downstream effector molecule in this cascade (Fig. 8B). Consid-
ering that neuronal cell death represents a complex process as
well as the large number of downstream NPAS4 targets, the crit-
ical impact of a single molecule, like Syt10, for the neuroprotec-
tive action of the AID-factor NPAS4 appears highly remarkable.
How in detail Syt10 contributes to activity-induced neuropro-
tection is still an open question. However, our data strongly
suggests that Syt10 is part of a fusion machinery regulating the
activity-dependent release of a neuroprotective factor. The iden-
tity of this or these secreted factors is so far unknown. Studies
using Syt10 deficient mice have revealed a function for Syt10 as a
Ca 2� sensor for activity-dependent release of the growth factor
IGF-1 from nonsynaptic vesicles in the olfactory bulb (Cao et al.,
2011). So far, it is unknown whether Syt10 is involved in control-
ling IGF-1 secretion also outside of the olfactory bulb. It was
postulated that this is not universally the case as the phenotype of
constitutive IGF-1 KO mice, i.e., reduced brain size, CNS hypo-
myelination, and loss of hippocampal granule and striatal
parvalbumin-containing neurons (Baker et al., 1993; Liu et al.,
1993; Beck et al., 1995), does not resemble the Syt10 KO pheno-
type (Cao et al., 2011). On the other side, in vivo levels of IGF-1 in
the hippocampus are increased by excitotoxic stimuli (Choi et al.,
2008; Wong-Goodrich and Mellott, 2008) and it is well estab-
lished that IGF-1 can act as a potent neuroprotective factor in
multiple types of brain injuries (Guan et al., 2003; Kaspar et al.,
2003; Kazanis et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004; Chesik et al., 2007;
Torres-Aleman, 2007; Ebert et al., 2008; Miltiadous et al., 2010,
2011). Our observations indicate that IGF-1 is not the major
neuroprotective secreted factor in the NPAS4–Syt10 signaling
cascade as it is not able to rescue the KA-induced aggravated
neuronal cell death of Syt10 hippocampal neurons by itself. How-
ever, our data do not allow us to exclude either that IGF-1 acts in
concert with other secreted factors to mediate neuroprotection in
response to KA or that Syt10 controls the release of IGF-1 in the
hippocampus. Hence, as IGF-1 is only one of many known neu-
roprotective factors expressed in the hippocampus (Malva et al.,
2012; Tamas et al., 2012; Zaben and Gray, 2013; Tovar-y-Romo et
al., 2014), the next step will now be to determine the identity of
the factor whose release is affected by Syt10 deficiency in this
signaling cascade. Mechanistically, Syt10 may also be involved in
the Ca 2�-dependent fusion of intracellular transport vesicles as a
defect in this process can as well disrupt vesicular exocytosis.
It was recently reported that in hippocampal neurons Syt10 is
not present on vesicles that fuse in response to depolarization but
rather on the plasma membrane (Dean et al., 2012). However,
this observation was based on overexpression of a tagged Syt10 in
native hippocampal neurons, in which endogenous Syt10 is only
present at very low levels. Therefore, it might be hypothesized
that in hippocampal neurons Syt10-dependent fusion processes
only occur after strong, putatively pathophysiologic activity or
even excitotoxic insults and that the respective vesicles and fusion
machinery, just like Syt10, are only synthesized in response to
these signals. Thereby, this machinery may represent a key cellu-
lar computing device for strong Ca 2� signaling. In the absence of
such hypothesized vesicles, Syt10 would be mislocalized and
therefore inactive. It will now be an important next step to iden-
tify these currently enigmatic vesicles and their cargo.
A more detailed understanding of the NPAS4–Syt10 neuro-
protective signaling cascade might form the basis for the devel-
opment of strategies to boost the endogenous neuroprotective
machinery and thereby to novel therapeutic approaches for neu-
rodegenerative disorders.
