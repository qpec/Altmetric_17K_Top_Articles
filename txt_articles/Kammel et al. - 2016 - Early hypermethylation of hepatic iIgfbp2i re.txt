Abstract
Obesity and ectopic fat disposition are risk factors for metabolic disease. Recent data indicate that IGFBP2 expression in liver
is epigenetically inhibited during hepatic steatosis. The aim of this study was to investigate if epigenetic de-regulation of
hepatic Igfbp2 occurs already early in life and is associated with increased risk for diet-induced obesity (DIO) during
adolescence. Male C57BL/6J mice received a high-fat diet. After 3 weeks on this diet (age of 6 weeks), DIO-susceptible
(responder, Resp) and DIO-resistant (non-responder, nResp) mice were identified by early weight gain. At the age of 6 weeks,
Resp mice exhibited elevated blood glucose (p < 0.05), plasma insulin (p < 0.01), HOMA-IR and leptin/adiponectin ratio,
whereas liver triglycerides were identical but significantly increased (p < 0.01) in Resp mice at 20 weeks of age. Igfbp2
expression was reduced in young Resp compared with nResp mice (p < 0.01), an effect that correlated with elevated DNA
methylation of intronic CpG2605 (p < 0.01). The epigenetic inhibition of Igfbp2 was stable over time and preceded DIO and
hepatosteatosis in adult mice. In vitro studies demonstrated that selective methylation of CpG2605 significantly reduced
reporter activity by �85%, indicating that Igfbp2 expression is modulated by methylation. In human whole blood cells,
methylation of IGFBP2 at the homologous CpG site was increased in obese men with impaired glucose tolerance. In
conclusion, our data show that increased methylation of hepatic Igfbp2 during infancy predicts the development of fatty liver
later in life and is linked to deterioration of glucose metabolism.

 Introduction
Obesity has become a major health threat, affecting more than
half a billion people worldwide in 2014 (1). In particular, obesity in-
creases the risk for insulin resistance, hypertension, coronary heart
disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The risk of obesity is largely
influenced by the family background, indicated by heritability rates
of up to 40% for body mass index (BMI) (2). However, genetic vari-
ants identified so far only explain <5% of the observed heritability,
a phenomenon referred to as “missing heritability” (3,4).
Epigenetics is suggested to explain parts of the missing herita-
bility. Epigenetic alterations (e.g. DNA methylation at CpG dinucle-
otides or histone modifications) modify gene expression without
altering genomic sequences and are therefore missed in conven-
tional genome-wide association studies (5,6). Intriguingly, even in
inbred mouse strains like C57BL/6J, individual mice largely differ in
their response to diet-induced obesity (DIO), rendering these
strains a suitable model to unravel non-genetic mechanisms in
body weight regulation (7). In this context, Koza et al. (7) identified
three genes (Sfrp5, Mest and Bmp3) in adipose tissue, which are dif-
ferentially expressed in DIO-responders already at 7 weeks of age
and associated with increased susceptibility to DIO.
In addition to adipose tissue, the liver plays a major role in the
regulation of energy metabolism and hepatic insulin sensitivity,
and consequently in the pathogenesis of obesity and T2D (8,9).
Accordingly, hepatic genes involved in glucose and lipid metabo-
lism have been shown to be altered in mice prone to DIO, including
insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) (10). The IGF-axis appears to play
a crucial role in the regulation of body weight early in life. IGF-2 is
involved in embryonic growth, and altered methylation of the hu-
man IGF2 gene is associated with childhood obesity (11–13). This is
of particular interest, since plasma IGFBP-2 levels have been found
to be decreased in obese males and females (14,15). Furthermore,
reduced circulating IGFBP-2 levels in obese subjects are associated
with increased bioavailability of IGF-1, and hyperinsulinemia (14).
Furthermore, Igfbp2 transgenic mice show reduced body weight
gain on a standard diet and are protected against the development
of a DIO and insulin resistance (16,17). Recently, Ahrens et al. (18)
reported that hepatic expression of IGFBP2, a modulator of IGF-1/2
bioavailability, is epigenetically inhibited in patients with different
grades of hepatic lipid accumulation.
In this study, we investigated whether the variance in DIO and
hepatic steatosis of genetically identical C57BL/6J mice is reflected
by epigenetic modulation of hepatic Igfbp2 early in life. The estab-
lishment of weight prediction parameters allowed us to isolate
liver tissues before the onset of fatty liver, and to study differences
between mice prone to DIO and mice resistant against it. We found
Igfbp2 to be hypermethylated and transcriptionally repressed in
young mice prone to DIO, already before the onset of hepatic stea-
tosis. These transcriptional and epigenetic differences of Igfbp2
that are present early in life and linked to obesity and insulin resis-
tance in adolescence underline the significance of IGFBP-2 for body
weight development and fatty liver. Interestingly, differential
methylation occurs at the CpG site homologous to the human site
in the IGFBP2 gene published by Ahrens et al. (18). In whole blood
cells of human subjects exhibiting an impaired glucose tolerance
the IGFBP2 methylation was significantly increased.
Results
Prediction of DIO by early weight parameters
In order to investigate early modulators of Igfbp2 expression, it
was
necessary
to
discriminate
between
mice
prone
and
resistant to DIO at the earliest time point possible. Therefore,
we established early predictors of obesity in a larger cohort of
324 male C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 60 kcal% from
fat) for 20 weeks. In this cohort, body weights varied in a range
of 27.2–52.7 g (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). DIO responders
(Resp)
were
defined
as
individuals
that
reached
body
weights >38 g, while non-responders (nResp) reached <38 g at
20 weeks of age. Analysis of the individual weight courses indi-
cated that weight gain during the first 3 weeks after weening
(life week 3–6) in combination with the absolute body weight at
week 6 is the strongest predictor for DIO susceptibility. In detail,
nResp mice were characterized by an early weight gain of <0.
9 g/day plus body weights <22 g in week 6, resulting in a proba-
bility for correct prediction of p ¼ 0.81. Resp mice were charac-
terized by an early weight gain
of >0.7 g/day plus body
weights >24 g in week 6 (p ¼ 0.80). Next, the quality of prediction
was confirmed in a second cohort of mice for which the predic-
tion parameters were applied in week 6 (Fig. 1A). Low-fat diet
(LFD)-fed mice served as a lean control. The early difference in
body weight between Resp and nResp mice was reflected by
both lean and fat mass, and increased over time (Fig. 1B,
Table 1). Early body weight differences between both groups
were not because of differences in body length, or food and wa-
ter intake that were detected in single caged mice (Table 1).
Impaired glucose homeostasis precedes the onset of
hepatosteatosis
Next, we investigated whether differences in body weight gain
were associated with changes in blood glucose, insulin or leptin
levels. Surprisingly, blood glucose levels in Resp mice were ele-
vated compared with nResp mice already at 6 weeks of age
(8.5 6 0.5 versus 6.8 6 0.4 mM, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). Furthermore,
plasma insulin (0.88 6 0.10 versus 0.44 6 0.06 mg/l, p < 0.01) and
leptin (0.54 6 0.08 versus 1.62 6 0.31 ng/ml, p < 0.01) levels were
also increased in Resp mice at this early time point (Fig. 1D and
E). The differences of these blood parameters were stable and
further increased over time (Fig. 1C–E). Accordingly, HOMA-IR
indicated that Resp mice already at 6 weeks of age were less in-
sulin sensitive compared with nResp mice (8.3 6 1.1 versus
3.4 6 0.6, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1F). The leptin per adiponectin ratio
(LAR) is a second measure of systemic insulin resistance (19)
and showed the same differences between Resp and nResp
mice (Fig. 1G). Therefore, the impaired insulin sensitivity ob-
served at the age of 20 weeks in Resp mice (Fig. 1F and G) was al-
ready manifested at 6 weeks of age and preceded the obese
phenotype. Importantly, liver triglyceride levels were not differ-
ent at 6 weeks of age but increased in Resp mice at 20 weeks of
age (0.82 6 0.08 versus 1.21 6 0.07 mg/mgprotein) (Fig. 1H). Absolute
liver weight was not different between Resp and nResp mice at
6 (42.2 6 1.3 versus 39.3 6 1.2 mg/gbody weight) and 20 (33.3 6 1.1
versus 31.8 6 0.9 mg/gbody weight) weeks of age, respectively.
Reduced Igfbp2 expression in young DIO responders
Recently, it has been shown that human hepatic steatosis is as-
sociated with reduced expression of hepatic IGFBP2 (18). In Resp
mice, expression of hepatic Igfbp2 was reduced by 35.55 6
10.20% (p < 0.01) and 40.68 6 8.11% (p < 0.001) at weeks 6 and 20,
respectively, as compared with nResp mice (Fig. 2A and B). This
decrease of gene expression was paralleled by reduced IGFBP-2
protein level in liver tissue (Fig. 2C). In order to investigate
whether plasma levels of other IGFBP isoforms are also altered

 in Resp mice, we performed quantitative western ligand blots
against IGF-2 (20). IGFBP-2 levels were decreased in Resp mice
(p < 0.01) (Fig. 2D), whereas IGFBP-3 levels were increased at
week 6 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2E). Expression of IGFBP-4 was below the
limit of quantification of the analytical system. In the circula-
tion, IGFBP-2 binds to IGF-1 and decreases its bioavailability
(21). In obese subjects, reduced expression of IGFBP2 results in
increased serum levels of free IGF-1 (14). Accordingly, serum
levels of total IGF-1 were increased in Resp mice compared with
nResp mice (Fig. 2F).
Increased Igfbp2 methylation detected early in life of
Resp mice
Reduced expression of IGFBP2 in NAFLD and NASH patients was
associated with increased methylation of one CpG (cg11669516)
in the first intron of the human IGFBP2 gene at position 2965 bp
downstream the transcription start site (TSS) (18). Because the
genomic region around cg11669516 is highly conserved between
humans and mice (Fig. 3A), we investigated whether methyla-
tion at this site also occurs in young obesity-prone mice, and

 whether this methylation is paralleled by early differences in
Igfbp2 expression. Indeed, methylation at the corresponding
mouse CpG (CpG2605, 2605 bp downstream the TSS) was in-
creased by 6.2 6 1.2% (p < 0.001) in Resp mice at 6 weeks of age
(Fig. 3B). In addition, we used direct bisulfite sequencing PCR
(dBSP) to study CpG methylation of the proximal promoter re-
gion and identified three additional CpG sites (CpG�842, CpG�738
and CpG884) that were methylated differentially in nResp and
Resp mice (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2A and B). However,
as these sites could not be validated by pyrosequencing
(Supplementary Material, Fig. S2C–E), we concentrated
on
CpG2605 for further analyses. Methylation of the intronic CpG2605
in the young animals was inversely correlated with expression
of Igfbp2 (R2¼0.551, p < 0.001) and positively correlated with
body weight (R2¼0.686, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3C and D). Neither blood
glucose nor HOMA-IR was correlated with CpG2605 methylation;
however, the LAR was positively correlated with CpG2605 meth-
ylation (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3A–C). The methylation
difference between both groups persisted, as Resp mice dis-
played increased CpG2605 methylation compared with nResp
mice also at 20 weeks of age (6.0 6 1.3%, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3E).
Again, methylation of CpG2605 was negatively correlated with
gene expression (R2¼0.392, p < 0.01) and positively with body
weight (R2¼0.339, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3F and G). At this later time
point, methylation of CpG2605 was also correlated with blood
glucose
and
HOMA-IR
but
not
with
LAR
(Supplementary
Material, Fig. S3D–F). In summary, these data indicate that sus-
ceptibility to DIO and insulin resistance is associated with in-
creased Igfbp2 methylation and reduced expression early in life.
CpG2605 methylation modulates expression of the Igfbp2
gene
In order to investigate whether methylation of CpG2605 and expres-
sion of Igfbp2 are causally linked, we generated a luciferase reporter
construct. It carried a 700-bp fragment of intron 1 in a CpG-free
backbone vector (pCpGL) and was in vitro methylated by methyl-
transferase HpaII (CCGG) and M.SssI (CG), respectively (Fig. 4A). Of
note, CpG2605 is embedded into an HpaII recognition site (Fig. 3A)
that is unique in pCpGL-Igfbp2. Therefore, in vitro methylation of
pCpGL-Igfbp2 by HpaII allowed us to selectively study the impact of
CpG2605 methylation on Igfbp2 expression. After in vitro methyla-
tion, luciferase activity was assessed in AML12 hepatocytes. While
full methylation by M.SssI almost completely abolished luciferase
activity (�91.3 6 3.9%, p< 0.001), selective methylation of CpG2605
with HpaII led to a reduction of luciferase activity by 84.8 6 4.7%
(p< 0.001) (Fig. 4B), indicating that Igfbp2 expression is indeed mod-
ulated by methylation of CpG2605. Because the differences in body
weight are rather small within HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice, we also
compared male C57BL/6J mice with male New Zealand Obese
(NZO) mice fed a standard diet at the age of 6 weeks. NZO mice de-
velop severe obesity and are, in contrast to C57BL/6J, susceptible to
T2D (22,23). Already at the age of 6 weeks, NZO mice show in-
creased body weight mainly because of increased fat mass com-
pared
with
C57BL/6J
mice
which
is
also
reflected
by
the
significantly elevated plasma leptin concentrations. Accordingly,
the young NZO mice are insulin resistant as fasted insulin levels
and LAR are significantly higher than in C57BL/6 mice. However,
both strains do not differ significantly in their fasted blood glucose
levels (Table 2). Indeed, NZO mice displayed decreased hepatic
Igfbp2 expression levels and increased methylation of CpG2605 com-
pared with C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 4C and D). Again, the degree of
CpG2605 methylation correlated with body weight (Fig. 4E) as well
as with insulin concentration (Fig. 4F) and LAR (Fig. 4G).
Plasticity of Igfbp2 methylation
In humans, IGFBP2 expression is increased by caloric restriction
and exercise, two mechanisms known to reduce liver fat con-
tent (24,25). In order to investigate the plasticity of Igfbp2 meth-
ylation under conditions that modulate Igfbp2 gene expression,
we performed a second set of experiments with obese mice that
had received HFD for 18 weeks. The first set of mice was killed
directly after the HFD feeding (HFD group); the second group of
mice was subjected to 25% weight loss by restrictive feeding of
an LFD (10 kcal% from fat, 16.1 kJ/g, D12450B, Research Diets,
Inc.) for 3 weeks (HFD-CR group). The third group of mice was
also caloric restricted for 3 weeks but received ad libitum HFD
again afterwards for another 3 weeks (HFD–CR–HFD group).
Caloric restriction (CR) led to the desired weight loss, and re-
feeding with HFD led to a complete re-gain of body weight (Fig.
5A). Weight loss and re-gain were because of changes in both
lean and fat mass (Fig. 5B). In parallel to the weight loss, expres-
sion
of
Igfbp2
increased
in
mice
of
the
HFD–CR
group
(þ52.2 6 15.7%, p < 0.05) and decreased again upon HFD re-feed-
ing (Fig. 5C). Accordingly, methylation of CpG2605 revealed the
opposite
trends,
with
a
decrease
during
CR
(�2.6 6 2.2%,
p ¼ 0.25) and increase (þ5.8 6 2.7%, p ¼ 0.04) during HFD re-feed-
ing (Fig. 5D). To test if changes in Igfbp2 expression correlate
with alterations in blood glucose or plasma insulin we mea-
sured these two parameters in the indicated groups. Blood glu-
cose concentrations did not change in response to weight loss
but increased significantly after the re-feeding period (Fig. 5E).
As expected caloric restriction resulted in a decrease of insulin
levels which rose after re-feeding, however, without reaching
the initial concentration (Fig. 5F). These data indicate the

 changes in methylation of CpG2605 occur in a similar manner as
that of insulin levels.
Increased methylation of human CpG2965 in whole blood
cells of obese and glucose intolerant men
Our data indicate that methylation of CpG2605 is a marker for
obesity and linked to changes of glucose tolerance or insulin
sensitivity. Therefore, we next measured methylation of human
CpG2965 in whole blood cells of men with different stages of
metabolic disease. Subjects were grouped according to their glu-
cose tolerance obtained during an oral glucose tolerance test
(oGTT) as well as BMI into normal glucose tolerant subjects with
a BMI <27 (NGT.BMI <27) or BMI >30 (NGT.BMI >30) as well as
impaired glucose tolerant with a BMI <27 (IGT.BMI <27) or
BMI >30 (IGT.BMI >30). Compared with the NGT.BMI <27 group,

Discussion
In this study, we investigated early inter-individual differences
in the epigenetic regulation of hepatic Igfbp2 that determine
DIO susceptibility in inbred C57BL/6J mice. Already at a very
young age hepatic Igfbp2 expression was decreased and methyl-
ation at CpG2605 was increased in DIO responders. This epige-
netic repression of hepatic Igfbp2 was stable over time and,
most importantly, preceded the development of fatty liver.
Selective in vitro methylation of CpG2605 decreased luciferase re-
porter activity, indicating a direct influence of methylation at
this site on Igfbp2 expression levels. Transcriptional regulation
of Igfbp2 largely followed body weight dynamics, as caloric re-
striction and HFD feeding conversely affected Igfbp2 expression
and
methylation.
Furthermore,

Igfbp2

 associated with blood glucose, a finding that was confirmed in
human whole blood cells of obese men. In young individuals,
enhanced Igfbp2 methylation reflects early deteriorations of glu-
cose metabolism, which in turn represents an enhanced risk for
fatty liver and insulin resistance later in life.
Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are tightly
regulated to ensure proper body weight development and
growth in the neonatal period (26,27). IGF-1 binding proteins
(IGFBPs) control the bioavailability of circulating IGF-1 (28). For
example, the repression of IGFBP1 and IGFBP2 during chronic
hyperinsulinemia increases the bioavailability of IGF-1 (free
IGF-1) and supports body weight gain (14,29). Our present find-
ing of reduced hepatic Igfbp2 expression in mice with elevated
plasma insulin levels is in line with these published observa-
tions. Recently, we presented data of mouse lines selected for
either high or low body weight gain for 58 generations (20). We
showed that the sub-population of high body weight gainers ex-
hibited a reduced hepatic Igfbp2 expression (20), similar to the
data presented here. Importantly, the differential Igfbp2 expres-
sion and methylation reported in this study occurred in a single
generation of mice, and differences were observed even be-
tween littermates.
We could show that repression of Igfbp2 in livers of obesity-
prone mice is linked with increased methylation of CpG2605 in
the first intron of the gene, already at a very young age.
However, whether increased CpG2605 methylation is a result of
elevated plasma insulin and glucose levels or independently es-
tablished during development could not be resolved by our ex-
periments. Nevertheless, our data indicate that epigenetic
alterations of Igfbp2 occur early in life and precede the develop-
ment of fatty liver.
In line with our observation, low plasma IGFBP-2 levels have
also been found in obese children (30,31). Increased IGF-1 bio-
availability at least partially explains the accelerated growth ob-
served in children when reaching the pre-pubertal period (30).
At this age, decreased IGFBP-2 serum levels were associated
with increased body weight, body fat mass, serum insulin and
leptin levels (32,33). Again, the phenotypic characteristics of our
obesity-prone mice are in line with the observations in young
humans. In addition, our study in inbred mice indicates that
epigenetic variability early in life might contribute to the ob-
served differences in circulating IGFBP-2 levels. In contrast to
IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3 levels were increased in young mice prone to
weight gain. In humans, serum levels of IGFBP-3 are decreased
in children born small for gestational age, and tend to be in-
creased in obese children (34,35). Furthermore, mice transgenic
for Igfbp3 display increased serum levels of both IGF-1 and
IGFBP-3 as well as impaired glucose tolerance and insulin
resistance (36). Therefore, the increased IGFBP-3 levels found in
young Resp mice might also contribute to the metabolic
phenotype.
There are several possible mediators of Igfbp2 methylation
and expression in obesity-prone individuals. Besides glucose,
we found circulating insulin and leptin to be increased in obe-
sity-prone mice compared with obesity-resistant mice. As men-
tioned above, insulin is a potent inhibitor of Igfbp2 expression
(37,38). Therefore, it can be speculated that low insulin concen-
tration in obesity-resistant mice may cause an increase in
Igfbp2 expression. In contrast to insulin, leptin increases Igfbp2
expression in a dose-dependent manner (39). In DIO, however,
Igfbp2 expression is rather low despite high levels of circulating

 leptin (39). This could be a result of the concomitant hyperinsu-
linemia or of the leptin resistance. The correlation of CpG2605
methylation and plasma leptin levels in our young animals
might therefore reflect early metabolic disturbances induced by
the HFD (39). .As overnutrition is known to suppress Igfbp2 ex-
pression (14) it is possible that the observed alterations in Igfbp2
mRNA levels and DNA methylation are just an epiphenomenon
of elevated dietary intake. However, as food intake that was
measured in week 10 on the individual basis was not different
between responder and non-responder mice, we believe that al-
terations in Igfbp2 expression and methylation are rather a con-
sequence of intrauterine and/or early postnatal programming.
As mentioned earlier, lifestyle interventions that improve
insulin sensitivity and liver fat content, e.g. caloric restriction
and exercise, have been shown to increase IGFBP2 expression
(24,25). Caloric restriction also resulted in increased expression
of hepatic Igfbp2 in our obese mice. De-methylation of CpG2605
under these conditions is apparently slower and did not reach
statistical significance in our experiment. However, induction of
CpG2605 methylation by re-feeding the HFD significantly in-
creased methylation again. Together, these data indicate that
long-term caloric intake can alter the methylation of CpG2605.
The differential Igfbp2 expression as well as methylation associ-
ated with changes in body weight before the onset of liver fat
accumulation might already play an important role during fetal
programming. Human studies found an association of high
IGFBP-2 cord serum concentrations with inter-uterine growth
retardation in newborns (40), indicating an effect of IGFBP-2 on
fetal growth.
In conclusion, our data suggest that increased methylation
of hepatic Igfbp2 during infancy indicates an increased risk
to
develop
obesity
and
ectopic
fat
accumulation
in
adolescence. Furthermore, our data suggest that early deteriora-
tions of glucose metabolism parallels epigenetic deregulation of
Igfbp2.
Materials and Methods
Animals
C57BL/6J breeding pairs (Charles River, Germany) received a
standard chow (ssniff) and were housed in temperature-
controlled room (22 þ 1�C) on a 12:12 h light dark cycle. After
weaning male mice were fed an HFD (60 kcal% fat, 21.9 kJ/g,
D12492, Research Diets, Inc., USA) ad libitum in groups of two to
six animals per cage. The mice were housed and handled in ac-
cordance with the ‘Principles of laboratory animal care’ (41).
The animal welfare committees of the DIfE as well as the local
authorities (LUGV, Brandenburg, Germany) approved all animal
experiments. Weekly body weight measurements were per-
formed in the morning (8–10 am) from 3 to 20 weeks of age.
Body composition was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR, Minispec LF50, Bruker Biospin). Blood glucose was mea-
sured from tail blood with a Glucometer Elite (Bayer, Germany).
At 10 weeks of age, food intake was monitored with an auto-
matic drinking and feeding monitor system (TSE Systems,
Germany). Mice were housed in individual cages and adapted to
food baskets connected to weight sensors for 2 days. During the
measurement period of 3 days, the baskets contained HFD pel-
lets to which mice had ad libitum access. At the age of 6 and
20 weeks, respectively, mice were killed after 6 h fasting. All tis-
sues were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at �80�C
until further processing.
Plasma analysis
Plasma insulin was measured using the Mouse Ultra-sensitive
insulin ELISA kit from ALPCO (USA). Insulin-like growth fac-
tor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) as well as insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF-1) plasma levels were quantified using an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assays from R&D Systems (mouse-
IGFBP-2, DY797; mouse IGF-1, DY791; R&D Systems, USA). The
assays
were
performed
according
to
the
manufacturers’
instructions.
Hepatic triglycerides
Liver triglycerides were quantified using a commercial kit
(RandoxTR-210, UK). Livers were homogenized in 10 mmol/l so-
dium dihydrogen phosphate, 1 mmol/l EDTA and 1% (vol./vol.)
polyoxyethylene-10-tridecyl ether and incubated for 5 min at
37�C. After centrifugation, the triacylglycerols in the superna-
tant fraction could be detected.

 Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA from liver tissue of mice was extracted, and cDNA
synthesis as well as TaqMan gene expression assays were per-
formed as described previously (42).
Quantitative western ligand blot analysis of IGFBP
Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins were analyzed in
plasma by quantitative western ligand blot analysis, as de-
scribed previously (43,44). Plasma as well as recombinant hu-
man IGFBP standards (R&D Systems, USA) were diluted 1:20 in
artificial serum matrix (Biopanda) and boiled in sample buffer
(312.5 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 50% (wt/vol) glycerol, 5 mM EDTA (pH 8),
1% (wt/vol) SDS and 0.02% bromophenol blue) for 5 min.
Proteins were separated by electrophoreses [12% polyacrylam-
ide gel (Peqlab “Perfect Blue”)] and transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., USA), followed by immuno-
blotting. The blots were incubated with biotin-labeled human
IGF-2 (1:500; BioIGF-2-10; Ibt GmbH, Germany). IGFBP were de-
tected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the reagent
Luminata Forte (Millipore Corp., USA) and bands were visualized
on KODAK Image Station 4000 MM (Molecular Imaging Systems;
Carstream Health Inc., USA) and afterwards semi-quantified by
using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics, USA). For
each IGFBP, curve fitting was done by a 7-parametric nonlinear
regression (Hill equation).
Isolation of genomic DNA and bisulfite treatment
Genomic DNA (gDNA) from liver tissue was isolated using the
Invisorb Genomic DNA Kit II (Stratec, Germany) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Bisulfite conversion of 500 ng
gDNA was performed using the EpiTect Fast Bisulfite Kit
(QIAGEN, Germany). Bisulfite-converted DNA (bsDNA) was puri-
fied as recommended and eluted in a total volume of 15 ml.
dBSP and pyrosequencing
Bisulfite-specific primers were designed using MethPrimer (45).
PCRs (2.5 ml bsDNA) were performed using TaKaRa EpiTaqTM HS
(Takara Bio Inc., Japan) and amplicons purified with the
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Sanger se-
quencing of the samples was carried out by GATC Biotech
(Germany). Quantification of dBSP was done as described previ-
ously (46). In order to avoid over-representation of cytosine
peaks after normalization, the raw sequencing data were used
for quantification (CodonCode Aligner Software, version 5.1.5,
CodonCode Corporation, USA). Primers for pyrosequencing
were designed using the PyroMark Assay Design software
(QIAGEN,
Germany).
Pyrosequencing
was
performed
on
a
PyroMark Q96 Pyrosequencer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and quantified using PyroMark Q96 software 2.5.7
(QIAGEN, Germany).
Construction of CpG-free reporter gene plasmid
A fragment of the murine Igfbp2 gene, 2320–2997 bp down-
stream of the TSS, was PCR amplified using primers generating
restriction sites for BamHI (forward primer 50-GATC GGATCC
GAGC CTG GTT TTG CCA GGT TG) and NcoI (reversed primer 50-
GATC CCATGG GCC TGG CCT GAA TTC TGA AAG G) with
JumpStartTM REDAccuTaq
V
R LA DNA Polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA). The purified PCR amplificates were cloned into the pro-
moter-less CpG-free pCpGL-Basic vector (kindly provided by
Prof. Rehli, Regensburg, Germany) upstream of the luciferase re-
porter gene. For plasmid amplification, the construct (pCpGL-
Igfbp2)
was
transformed
into
One
Shot
V
R
PIR1
Competent
Escherichia coli (Invitrogen, USA).
In vitro methylation of pCpGL-Igfbp2 was performed using ei-
ther 4 U/mg DNA M.SssI or 2 U/mg DNA HpaII (New England
Biolabs, USA) in the presence of 160 mM S-adenosylmethionine
and incubated at 37�C for 1.5 h. After plasmid purification using
QIAGEN QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) con-
centration was measured with the NanoDrop Spectrophometer
(ND-1000, PeqLab, Germany).
AML12 cell culture and luciferase activity assay
The murine AML12 cell line (ATCC
V
R CRL-2254TM) was cultured in
a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and Ham’s
F12 medium (PAN-Biotech, Germany) with 0.005 mg/ml insulin
(Roche Life Science, USA), 0.005 mg/ml transferrin (Sigma-
Aldrich, USA), 5 ng/ml selenium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and
40 ng/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom, Germany). Cells were
maintained in humidified air replenished with 5% CO2. In a 48-
well plate, 4 � 104 AML12 cells/well were co-transfected using
Lipofectamine
V
R2000 (Invitrogen, USA) with 500 ng/well unme-
thylated or methylated pCpGL-Igfbp2 and 5 ng/well pRL-TK
Renilla control vector (Promega, USA). After 48 h, cells were har-
vested and analyzed for firefly and renilla luciferase activity us-
ing the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, USA).
Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to its renilla luciferase
transfection control.
Human participants and whole blood collection
The study population consisted of 109 German individuals re-
cruited from the ongoing Tu

 participants underwent assessment of medical history, smok-
ing status and alcohol consumption habits, physical examina-
tion, routine blood tests and oral glucose tolerance tests
(oGTTs). The study population consisted of individuals with
complete oGTT and documented absence of medication known
to influence glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity or insulin se-
cretion. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and
each participant signed a written informed consent. The Ethical
Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Tu
¨ bingen
approved the study protocol. Subjects are grouped into normal
glucose tolerant with BMI <27 (NGT.BMI <27, n ¼ 29) or BMI >30
(NGT.BMI >30,
n ¼ 18)
and
impaired
glucose
tolerant
with
BMI <27 (IGT.BMI <27, n ¼ 17) or BMI >30 (IGT.BMI >30, n ¼ 31).
Participant characteristics are shown in Table 3. A standardized
75 g oGTT was performed following a 10-h overnight fast. For
the determination of plasma glucose venous blood samples
were drawn at baseline and at time-points 30, 60, 90 and
120 min of the oGTT. For DNA methylation analysis, DNA was
isolated from whole blood using a commercial kit (NucleoSpin,
Macherey & Nagel, Du
¨ ren, Germany).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t-test, one-way
ANOVA or linear regression analysis using the software Prism6
from Graph Pad Software (La Jolla, USA). Significance levels
were set for p-values <0.05 (*), 0.01 (**) and 0.001 (***).
