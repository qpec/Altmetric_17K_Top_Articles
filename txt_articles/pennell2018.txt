IMPORTANCE Prior studies report lower birth rates for women with epilepsy (WWE) but have
been unable to differentiate between biological and social contributions. To our knowledge,
we do not have data to inform WWE seeking pregnancy if their likelihood of achieving
pregnancy is biologically reduced compared with their peers.
OBJECTIVE To determine if WWE without a prior diagnosis of infertility or related disorders
are as likely to achieve pregnancy within 12 months as their peers without epilepsy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Women With Epilepsy: Pregnancy Outcomes and
Deliveries study is an observational cohort study comparing fertility in WWE with fertility in
control women (CW) without epilepsy. Participants were enrolled at 4 academic medical
centers and observed up to 21 months from November 2010 to May 2015. Women seeking
pregnancy aged 18 to 40 years were enrolled within 6 months of discontinuing
contraception. Exclusion criteria included tobacco use and a prior diagnosis of infertility or
disorders that lower fertility. Eighteen WWE and 47 CW declined the study, and 40 WWE and
170 CW did not meet study criteria. The Women With Epilepsy: Pregnancy Outcomes and
Deliveries electronic diary app was used to capture data on medications, seizures, sexual
activity, and menses. Data were analyzed from November 2015 to June 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was proportion of women who
achieved pregnancy within 12 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were time to
pregnancy using a proportional hazard model, pregnancy outcomes, sexual activity, ovulatory
rates, and analysis of epilepsy factors in WWE. All outcomes were planned prior to data
collection except for time to pregnancy.
RESULTS Of the 197 women included in the study, 142 (72.1%) were white, and the mean (SD)
age was 31.9 (3.5) years among the 89 WWE and 31.1 (4.2) among the 108 CW. Among 89
WWE, 54 (60.7%) achieved pregnancy vs 65 (60.2%) among 108 CW. Median time to
pregnancy was no different between the groups after controlling for key covariates (WWE:
median, 6.0 months; 95% CI, 3.8-10.1; CW: median, 9.0 months; 95% CI, 6.5-11.2; P = .30).
Sexual activity and ovulatory rates were similar in WWE and CW. Forty-four of 54 pregnancies
(81.5%) in WWE and 53 of 65 pregnancies (81.5%) in CW resulted in live births. No epilepsy
factors were significant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Women with epilepsy seeking pregnancy without prior
known infertility or related disorders have similar likelihood of achieving pregnancy, time to
pregnancy, and live birth rates compared with their peers without epilepsy.

pproximately 12.5 million women of childbearing age
worldwide have epilepsy.1 Most studies suggest birth
rates in women with epilepsy (WWE) to be 37% to 88%
of other groups.2,3 Conversely, the Northern Finland Birth
Cohort4 reported the number of children born to WWE did not
differ from the reference group overall, although epilepsy not
in remission was associated with fewer children. None of these
studies collected information about the desire or attempts to
achieve pregnancy. Birth rates could be lower in WWE be-
cause of social factors (eg, lower marriage rates or lower rates
of seeking pregnancy) and/or biological factors (eg, de-
creased ovulatory rates). A UK survey5 reported 33% of WWE
respondents were not considering having children because of
theirepilepsy.Neurologistsdonothavetheinformationneeded
tocounseltheirfemalepatientswhodesirepregnancywhether
they are as likely to achieve pregnancy and to have a live birth
as their peers.
We designed this study to determine whether WWE with-
out a preexisting diagnosis of infertility or associated disor-
ders who are following their clinically determined treatment
regimen differ from women without epilepsy when attempt-
ing to achieve pregnancy. The primary aim was the propor-
tion of women achieving pregnancy within 1 year. Secondary
aims were comparisons between WWE and women without
epilepsy for (1) live birth rates, (2) time to achieve pregnancy,
(3) sexual activity rates, and (4) ovulatory rates. An addi-
tional secondary aim was to explore seizure and medication
factors within WWE that could affect fertility.
To our knowledge, no prior studies prospectively com-
pared WWE with women without epilepsy attempting to
conceive. Our study approach excluded women with known
infertility diagnosis or diagnoses associated with reproduc-
tive disorders (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS]). This
study specifically addressed the woman who arrives in clinic
with no reason to suspect infertility other than an epilepsy
diagnosis.
Methods
We enrolled WWE and control women (CW) without epilepsy
seeking pregnancy at 4 academic medical centers in the United
States: Brigham and Women’
s Hospital, Boston, Massachu-
setts, New York University Medical Center, New York, North-
well Health (formerly North Shore–Long Island Jewish Health
System), Great Neck, New York, and the University of Pitts-
burgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We recruited WWE and CW
from flyers and brochures placed in neurology and gynecol-
ogyclinicsattheclinicalsitesandinlocalrestaurants,churches,
childcare centers, hospital research bulletins, email list-
serves, and online postings. Institutional review board ap-
provals were obtained from Partners HealthCare System for
Brigham and Women’
s Hospital, New York University, North-
well Health Institutional Review Board (formerly North-
ShoreLongIslandJewishHospitalInstitutionalReviewBoard),
and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. All participants
provided written informed consent. The study was regis-
tered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01259310).
Sample Size and Power Analysis
The rate of pregnancy in WWE was hypothesized to be two-
thirds the rate for CW. Pregnancy rate by 12 months after
enrollment was chosen as the primary end point given its
clinical relevance and consistency with the World Health Or-
ganization criteria for a diagnosis of infertility.6 We used pub-
lished 3-month pregnancy rates to conservatively calculate
sample size for pregnancy rates by 12 months after enroll-
ment. The population-based estimate of pregnancy rate over
3 menstrual cycles is approximately 55%7; thus, we esti-
mated that the rate among WWE was expected to be approxi-
mately 36%. Based on a 2-tailed comparison of rates, we es-
timated that a sample size of 100 women in each group would
be needed to provide 79% power to detect this difference at a
significance level of .05. To account for dropout, we planned
to recruit a total of 110 women in each group.
Women with epilepsy and CW were included if they were
aged18to40years,expressedadesiretoconceive,hadasteady
male partner, and had discontinued any method of contracep-
tion within the previous 6 months or planned to do so within
6 months of providing informed consent. The study protocol
commenced after contraception was discontinued in the lat-
ter case. For intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate,
a woman could not be enrolled until 6 months after last injec-
tion and menses were regular. Exclusion criteria were a cur-
rent attempt to achieve pregnancy for 6 or more months;
demonstrated infertility with the same partner anytime in the
past6; breastfeeding; diagnoses of infertility, PCOS, severe
endometriosis, menopause, untreated thyroid disease, nipple
discharge, hyperprolactinemia, or other pituitary disease;
smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day; or planning to use
medication to conceive or a sperm donor. Women were also
excluded if their male partner had a history of abnormal
semen analysis results, vasectomy reversal, or male factor
infertility.
At the enrollment visit, demographic information and
medical history were obtained, including results of ancillary
studies,seizuretypes,andepilepsytreatments;afertilityques-
tionnaire was administered; physical and neurological exami-
nations were performed; and seizures, etiology, and epilepsy
syndromes were classified using the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke Epilepsy Common Data
Key Points
Question Do women with epilepsy without a prior diagnosis
of infertility or related disorders have the same likelihood of
achieving pregnancy as their peers without epilepsy?
Findings This multicenter cohort study of 89 women with
epilepsy and 108 control women found no difference in the
proportion of women who achieved pregnancy less than 12
months after enrollment in the study. Among women with
epilepsy, 54 (60.7%) achieved pregnancy vs 65 (60.2%) among
control women.
Meaning Women with epilepsy without a history of infertility or
related disorders seeking pregnancy had similar likelihood of
achieving pregnancy compared with their peers without epilepsy.

 Elements.8IrodyIncdesignedanelectronicdailydiaryappand
the cloud data system (the Women With Epilepsy: Pregnancy
Outcomes and Deliveries [WEPOD] study diary) for partici-
pants (Figure 1). We installed the app on a provided iPod Touch
(Apple) or personal smartphone and instructed all partici-
pants on how to track menses and sexual intercourse as well
as medication use and seizures for the epilepsy group. Partici-
pants could also enter data via a web-based interface or choose
to use a paper diary.
Participants had monthly visits in person or via tele-
phone for review of their diary. Participants were instructed
to conduct a home pregnancy test if menses did not begin by
day 35 of their cycle. If positive, they had an initial pregnancy
visit and a 1-month postpartum visit. Pregnancy losses (ie, ec-
topic pregnancy, miscarriage, fetal death, and abortions) were
included in the positive pregnancy group. Participants were
asked to sign a release to obtain medical records from their
health care team and the delivery hospital to verify preg-
nancy outcomes. Each participant contributed only 1 preg-
nancy to these analyses.
For each participant, time to pregnancy was calculated as
the interval between the end contraception date and 14 days
after the first day of the last menstrual period. Women who
did not achieve pregnancy within 12 months of beginning the
protocol or who dropped out without becoming pregnant were
considered censored in the analysis.
Sexual Activity
For each participant, months of daily electronic diary data with
more than 80% of days with tracked sexual activity were ana-
lyzed.Sexualactivityratewascalculatedasthenumberofdays
withatleast1episodeofsexualintercoursedividedbythenum-
ber of days in eligible months prior to pregnancy diagnosis or
study end.
Ovulation Status
We obtained venous blood for serum samples within 1 day of
menstrual day 21 for up to 2 cycles. Samples collected within
14 days of the next menstrual period were considered in the
luteal phase and included in this analysis. Progesterone level
was measured in the Brigham Research Assay Core in Boston,
Massachusetts, via access chemiluminescent immunoassay in
batched samples. Intra-assay variation was reported as 6.11%
to 11.19% and interassay variation as 6.59% to 9.57%. The men-
strual cycle was determined as ovulatory if the progesterone
level was 3.0 ng/mL or greater.
Statistical Analyses
We summarized all categorical variables by proportions and
continuous variables by means, medians, standard devia-
tions, and interquartile ranges. The primary analysis used a χ2
test to compare the proportion of women achieving preg-
nancybetweengroups.Insecondaryanalysis,weusedKaplan-
Meier curves, the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards
models to assess the association between time to pregnancy
and epilepsy status while controlling for baseline character-
istics. All factors significant at the .20 level in univariate analy-
ses were considered in multivariable models, as were covari-
ates that are consistently shown to affect fertility (ie, age and
body mass index). The importance of each variable was as-
sessedthroughlikelihoodratiotestsatthe.10significancelevel.
The process of removing variables, refitting, and retesting was
continued until all variables in the model had a P value of .05
or less.
Pregnancy outcomes were analyzed as proportions of mis-
carriages to live births across groups using a χ2 test. Rates of
sexual activity were estimated and compared between the
WWE and CW using Poisson regression. Ovulatory status was
analyzed using logistic regression and Generalized Estimat-
ing Equations to account for the intraparticipant correlation.
Separate analyses assessed the additional contribution of
epilepsy factors in the epilepsy cohort only, including sei-
zuresinthe9monthspriortoenrollment(yes/no)andenzyme-
inducing antiepileptic drug (EIAED) use. Carbamazepine, phe-
nytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and oxcarbazepine were
categorizedasEIAEDs.StatisticalsignificancewassetatP < .05,
and all P values were 2-tailed. All analyses used SAS statisti-
cal software version 9.2 (SAS Institute).
Sensitivity Analyses
Because WWE and CW were recruited from different sources
out of necessity, a higher percentage of WWE signed in-
formed consent prior to stopping contraception. To rule out
any obscuration of a difference between the groups in time to
pregnancy, a sensitivity analysis was performed by removing
the participants enrolled prior to stopping contraception.
Raceandethnicitywereself-reported.Nationalsurveydata
of infertility in the United States examined racial and ethnic
differences. The only category that differed was non-
Hispanic black women, who were more likely to be infertile
than non-Hispanic white women.9 As a sensitivity analysis, we
repeated the analysis after removing non-Hispanic black
women.

 Prior studies demonstrate that the probability of concep-
tion is highest in the first cycle without contraception and
drops off with each subsequent cycle.7,10,11 Because partici-
pants could enroll until 6 months after contraception discon-
tinuation, we compared the proportion of WWE and CW
enrolling less than 3 months and 3 to 6 months after discon-
tinuing contraception.
Results
We enrolled 89 WWE and 108 CW (Table 1) from November
2010 through February 2014. Primary reasons for not enroll-
ingintheWEPODstudyafterinitialinquiryarelistedinTable2.
Recruitment was stopped below the planned 100 WWE be-
cause of slow enrollment but was partially compensated by en-
rollment of additional CW. There were 18 early discontinua-
tions from the epilepsy group and 15 from the control group,
who were censored at the time of dropout.
For the primary aim, we found no differences between the
epilepsy and control groups in the proportion who achieved
pregnancy (WWE, 60.7% [54 of 89]; CW, 60.2% [65 of 108];
χ2 = 0.28; P = .60). Median time to pregnancy was 6.0 months
(95% CI, 3.8-10.1) in WWE and 9.0 months (95% CI, 6.5-11.2) in
CW(P = .30)(Figure2).Womenwhohadfeaturesofhigherpar-
ity, were white, and were married were more likely to achieve
pregnancy, and women with a higher age at enrollment were
less likely to achieve pregnancy (eTable in the Supplement).
Time to pregnancy was no different after controlling for parity,
race/ethnicity, marital status, age, and body mass index.
Pregnancy Outcomes
Pregnancy outcomes were similar, with 81.5% of pregnancies
producing live births for each group (44 of 54 pregnancies in
WWE and 53 of 65 pregnancies in CW). Miscarriage rates were
similar, occurring in 8 pregnancies (14.8%) in WWE and in 12
pregnancies (18.5%) in CW. Additionally, of the WWE preg-
nancies, 1 ectopic pregnancy (1.9%) and 1 therapeutic abor-
tion caused by genetic anomalies (1.9%) occurred.
Sexual Activity
A total of 145 participants had months with more than 80%
dailytrackingofsexualactivityandwereincludedintheanaly-
sis, including 57 of 89 WWE (64.0%) and 88 of 108 CW (81.5%).
We found no difference in sexual activity rates between WWE
and CW (Figure 3).
Ovulation Status
A total of 243 cycles were included in the analysis. Six cycles in
WWEand17cyclesinCWwereexcludedbecauseoftheproges-
terone sample being drawn more than 14 days prior to the next
menstrual period. In WWE, 92 of 104 cycles (88.5%) were ovu-
latory. In CW, 113 of 139 cycles (81.3%) were ovulatory. The rela-
tion between ovulation and study group was not significant.
Epilepsy Factors
In the analysis of the epilepsy cohort, 2 participants were
removed because they were not taking antiepileptic drugs

 (AEDs) (Table 1). All other WWE continued to use their pre-
scribed AEDs. Presence of active seizure in the prior 9
months did not influence the likelihood of pregnancy.
Women receiving an EIAED were less likely to achieve preg-
nancy compared with women taking other AEDs (hazard
ratio, 0.456; 95% CI, 0.193-1.081).
Sensitivity Analyses
Results of sensitivity analyses were similar to initial analyses.
After removing women who stopped birth control after en-
rollment(14WWEand2CW),adjustedtimestopregnancywere
a median of 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.8-12.2) in WWE and 9.0
months (95% CI, 6.5-11.2) in CW (P = .75). One non-Hispanic
black WWE and 16 non-Hispanic black CW were removed from
the time to pregnancy analysis; findings did not change. There
was no difference between groups for duration not taking birth
control prior to enrollment, with 74 of 89 WWE (83.1%) and
87 of 108 CW (80.6%) enrolled within 3 months of stopping
birth control and the remainder enrolled 3 to 6 months after
stopping birth control.
Discussion
In this prospective study of WWE seeking pregnancy, the first
such study, to our knowledge, that included controls, we pro-
vide substantial data to support that WWE have similar preg-
nancy rates and time to achieve pregnancy as women with-
out epilepsy of similar age. These findings are specific to
women who do not have established diagnoses of infertility

 or associated disorders. Prior research has suggested WWE are
at higher risk of reproductive endocrine dysfunction,12 and
PCOS occurs more frequently in WWE, especially with valpro-
ate use in idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndromes.13-16
Therefore, we excluded women with PCOS to be able to de-
termine if women without known PCOS have impaired fertil-
ity. Our findings are directly applicable to the more common
clinical scenario of WWE without a preexisting diagnosis of in-
fertility or associated disorders seeking information from their
physicians when they decide they want to become pregnant.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report
approximately 6% of married women in the United States are
infertile,17 although other estimates are higher.18 The lower
12-month pregnancy rates in these groups of WWE and CW
can be attributed to the fact that we enrolled women up to 6
months after birth control cessation. The probability of con-
ception is highest in the first cycle without contraception
and drops with each subsequent cycle.7,10,11,19 The propor-
tion of WWE and CW enrolling less than 3 months and 3 to 6
months after discontinuing contraception did not differ, and
thus, this was not likely to bias our data. Additionally, the
ages of participants were higher in this study than other
studies, which is expected to lower pregnancy rates.10,19 Fur-
thermore, our reported pregnancy rates do not adjust for the
33 early discontinuations.
A prospective cohort study in India20 reported 3 or more
AEDsanduseofphenobarbitalwereassociatedwithhigherrisk
of infertility. Other studies reported that EIAEDs contribute to
higher rates of menstrual disorders.21,22 In the WEPOD study,
only 9 WWE (10.1%) were taking AED polytherapy and none
were taking phenobarbital, which may explain why the
WEPOD study did not similarly show diminished fertility. The
WEPOD study only enrolled 16 WWE (18.0%) taking an
EIAED, reflective of the practices at the study sites. The haz-
ard ratio for women taking EIAEDs to achieve pregnancy was
0.456 (95% CI, 0.193-1.081) but did not reach statistical sig-
nificance. Our subgroup analyses in the epilepsy group were
secondary and may not have shown differences because of low
power. Therefore, the potential influence of EIAEDs on fertil-
ity is worth studying in a larger group of women.
Other studies suggest differences in fertility between ac-
tive vs controlled epilepsy.4,23 In this cohort, 39 of 87 WWE
(44.8%)hadseizureswithintheprior9months;wedidnotfind
adifferenceinpregnancyoutcomesbetweenthesewomenand
seizure-free women.
Becausestudiesreportedhigherratesofanovulatorycycles
and sexual dysfunction in WWE,24-26 we explored these 2 im-
portant factors for pregnancy. We did not find differences in
ovulation or sexual activity rates between the 2 groups. How-
ever, when the goal is to conceive, libido plays a less impor-
tant role in rates of sexual activity, so our data cannot provide
direct inferences regarding libido in WWE.
The number of live births and miscarriages did not differ
between the 2 groups in the WEPOD study, and rates were
within expectations for women who track prospectively prior
to conception.27,28 Although some studies suggest WWE are
athigherriskformiscarriage,29toourknowledge,nopriorstud-
ies exclusively enrolled women prior to pregnancy and likely
missed capture of early miscarriages. The International Reg-
istry of Anti-Epileptic Drugs and Pregnancy study30 reported
increased miscarriage risk with antiepileptic polytherapy, and
it is possible that our study had too few women taking poly-
therapy to detect this difference. However, all miscarriages in
this study occurred in women on AED monotherapy. Our find-
ings are similar to another study31 that found no difference in
miscarriage rates in WWE (18%) compared with wives of men
with epilepsy.
A unique characteristic of the WEPOD cohort is that all
women planned their pregnancy in advance, differing from
pregnancy registry or population studies. A strength of our
study was use of a digital diary to capture medication use, sei-
zures, sexual activity, and menstrual bleeding. This, coupled
with progesterone level measurements to confirm ovulation,
allowed us to address potential fertility factors that could not
be studied otherwise. Women were very compliant with the
diary, as has been published elsewhere.32
Limitations
There were limitations in our study. This study does not
answer if there are differences in rates of infertility or PCOS,
as women with these diagnoses were excluded from both
groups. We were not able to prospectively track data from the
date of stopping contraception in most participants. Some
women may have achieved pregnancy before they could be
recruited, making pregnancy rates lower than expected. We
accounted for all anticipated confounders associated with

 fertility. Our analysis showed expected associations (ie, age
and gravidity) and some unanticipated associations (ie, race
and marital status). Although inclusion criteria required a
stable male partner, it is possible that being married was
associated with shorter time to pregnancy because of greater
availability for intercourse and/or stronger desire to achieve
pregnancy expeditiously. In the enrolled women, higher rates
of marriage were present in white participants (90.1% [128 of
142]) vs other races (58.2% [32 of 55]) and could have contrib-
uted to the unexpected finding of an association of white
race with shorter time to pregnancy. The epilepsy group had
greater proportions of white participants and married partici-
pants than the control group. However, because these covari-
ates were incorporated into the model, it is unlikely any of
these differences influenced the primary findings of no dif-
ferences in pregnancy rates or time to pregnancy. The possi-
bility remains that additional unmeasured differences
between WWE and CW were not accounted for in the model
and could have influenced the results, especially because dif-
ferent sources of recruitment were necessary.
Conclusions
In this prospective cohort study of women without an a
priori diagnosis of infertility or related disorder, WWE seek-
ing pregnancy experienced similar pregnancy rates com-
pared with their peers without epilepsy. Secondary analyses
also showed similar times to achieve pregnancy and preg-
nancy outcomes. Although this study design cannot exclude
an increased risk for impaired fertility across all WWE, our
results should reassure WWE without a prior diagnosis of
infertility or related disorders and the clinicians who care for
them when planning pregnancy.
