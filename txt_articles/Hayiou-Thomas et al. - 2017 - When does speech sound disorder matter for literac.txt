Background: This study considers the role of early speech difficulties in literacy development, in the context of
additional risk factors. Method: Children were identified with speech sound disorder (SSD) at the age of 3½ years, on
the basis of performance on the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology. Their literacy skills were
assessed at the start of formal reading instruction (age 5½), using measures of phoneme awareness, word-level
reading and spelling; and 3 years later (age 8), using measures of word-level reading, spelling and reading
comprehension. Results: The presence of early SSD conferred a small but significant risk of poor phonemic skills
and spelling at the age of 5½ and of poor word reading at the age of 8. Furthermore, within the group with SSD, the
persistence of speech difficulties to the point of school entry was associated with poorer emergent literacy skills, and
children with ‘disordered’ speech errors had poorer word reading skills than children whose speech errors indicated
‘delay’. In contrast, the initial severity of SSD was not a significant predictor of reading development. Beyond the
domain of speech, the presence of a co-occurring language impairment was strongly predictive of literacy skills and
having a family risk of dyslexia predicted additional variance in literacy at both time-points. Conclusions: Early SSD
alone has only modest effects on literacy development but when additional risk factors are present, these can have
serious negative consequences, consistent with the view that multiple risks accumulate to predict reading disorders.
Keywords: Speech sound disorder; literacy; language impairment; disordered speech errors; family risk of dyslexia.
Introduction
Developmental speech sound disorder (SSD) encom-
passes a wide range of difficulties with the produc-
tion of speech in children, and is defined in DSM-5
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013) as a ‘per-
sistent difficulty with speech sound production that
interferes with speech intelligibility or prevents ver-
bal communication’ that cannot be explained in
terms of sensory problems, motoric difficulties or
other physical conditions. Children with SSD make
systematic omissions, substitutions or distortions of
phonemes within words, despite being able to repeat
these phonemes in isolation. The prevalence of SSD
in 4- to 6-year-old children has been estimated at
approximately 3–6%, based on large population-
based cohorts (Beitchman et al., 1986; Eadie et al.,
2015;
Shriberg,
Tomblin,
&
McSweeny,
1999),
although estimates vary substantially with age and
with diagnostic criteria. Speech difficulties in young
children often arouse their parents’ concern, and are
a frequent cause of referral to speech and language
therapy services (Bishop & Hayiou-Thomas, 2008;
Zhang & Tomblin, 2000). Although such difficulties
often resolve (Dodd, 1995), they are commonly seen
as a risk factor for literacy difficulties (Bird, Bishop,
& Freeman, 1995).
A separate line of research suggests that speech
and literacy difficulties share a common genetic
aetiology (Hayiou-Thomas, Harlaar, Dale, & Plomin,
2010; Lewis et al., 2011; Stein et al., 2004). The
relationship between them is not, however, straight-
forward, rather the risk of poor literacy in SSD may
be moderated by other factors including the persis-
tence of speech difficulties to the age at which formal
reading instruction begins; the nature of the speech
errors made by the child; co-occurring language
difficulties; and a family risk of dyslexia (Pennington
& Bishop, 2009). While previous research has exam-
ined each of these factors in isolation, they have not
been examined in combination, which is crucial for
understanding their relative importance.
The persistence of SSD into the early school years
is thought to be problematic for literacy develop-
ment, not least because the phonological skills
which are affected include those which are a crucial
foundation for learning to read. According to the
‘critical age hypothesis’, speech deficits matter if they
are present at the time that a child is learning to read
(Bishop & Adams, 1990). The strongest evidence in
support of a role for SSD per se comes from a study
by Bird et al. (1995), who followed a group of 5- to 7-
year-old children with SSD and found that, regard-
less of the presence of additional language impair-
ment, the presence of speech difficulties at school
entry posed a significant barrier to learning to read.

 A weaker role for SSD was reported by Nathan,
Stackhouse, Goulandris, and Snowling (2004), who
followed a sample of children with SSD from 4½ to
6½ years and found that, although the presence of
SSD at 6½ was strongly related to poor phonological
awareness and literacy skills, this was largely due to
co-occurring language difficulties. Nonetheless, SSD
status at 6½ on its own accounted for a small but
significant amount of unique variance in spelling but
not reading skills. Similar findings, of weak emergent
literacy skills in children with isolated SSD, were
also reported by DeThorne et al. (2006), and there is
evidence of long-term effects of early isolated SSD
when literacy skills were measured in middle child-
hood (Lewis, Freebairn, & Taylor, 2000).
An alternative view focuses not on the timing of
SSD, but rather on the characteristics of the speech
errors made. Dodd (1995) classified children accord-
ing to whether they showed either developmental
delay (speech errors that are prevalent in younger,
typically developing children) or disordered speech
errors (errors that do not tend to occur in typically
developing speech, such as vowel distortions or
initial consonant deletions). According to Dodd,
children showing disordered speech errors are likely
to have deficits in the way that they represent the
phonology of known words, and are at high risk of
reading problems because phonological awareness
skills are compromised. On the other hand, it is
assumed that children with speech delay will at
some point catch up to their typical peers.
Evidence supporting this view comes from compar-
isons of children with speech delay and speech disor-
der on phonological processing measures. Holm,
Farrier, and Dodd (2008) found that, although the
groups were similar in terms of language skills, the
children who made disordered speech errors showed
difficulties on phonological awareness tasks in com-
parison to those with speech delay, indicating difficul-
ties in learning the constraints of a phonological
system.
Similarly,
Leit~
ao,
Hogben,
and
Fletcher
(1997) found that only children with disordered speech
errors had difficulties with phonological awareness. A
follow-up at 12 years old (Leitao & Fletcher, 2004)
showed that most of the sample continued to have
literacy difficulties, and that the children with disor-
dered
speech
at
school
entry
were
particularly
impaired. These longitudinal findings were replicated
in an independent sample of preschoolers with SSD:
children who made disordered speech sound errors
weremorelikelytohaveweakliteracyskillsatthe ageof
8 (Preston, Hull, & Edwards, 2013).
Beyond the nature and timing of the SSD itself,
broaderlanguagedifficultieshaveasubstantialimpact
on literacy development. The most direct attempt to
disentangle whether it is the persistence of SSD or its
co-occurrence with LI that matters for literacy, was a
study by Raitano, Pennington, Tunick, Boada, and
Shriberg (2004). Kindergarten children (age 5–6 years)
who had a history of SSD were categorised according to
their current SSD status (resolved or persistent) and LI
status. Both current SSD and LI had significant,
additive, effects on phonological awareness skills;
additionally, a history of SSD, even if it had resolved,
had a significant effect on phonological awareness at
age 6. When these children were 7–9 years, Peterson,
Pennington, and Shriberg (2009) reported that while
both co-occurring LI and persistent SSD continued to
predict variance in phonological awareness skills, only
LI predicted reading outcomes. That is, although
children with a history of SSD had phonological
processing deficits well into middle childhood, this
only appeared to result in a reading deficit if they also
had broader oral language difficulties.
In summary, the relationship between SSD, LI and
Reading Disorder is complex: they co-occur more
often than would be expected by chance, probably
because of overlapping genetic and environmental
aetiology (Pennington & Bishop, 2009). A reasonable
interpretation of current findings would be that, as
both phonological and broader language skills are a
foundation for reading (Hulme, Nash, Gooch, Lerv�
ag,
&
Snowling,
2015)
deficits
in
these
skills
are
endophenotypes that mediate the well-established
genetic risk for dyslexia on reading development
(Lewis et al., 2011). Importantly however, Carroll,
Mundy, and Cunningham (2014) reported that a
family history of dyslexia conferred additional risk of
poor reading outcomes, over and above the contri-
bution of speech and language measures: it is
therefore plausible that some of these risks associ-
ated with family risk lie outside the domain of
speech, phonology and language. These may be
genetic or environmental, and lie beyond the scope
of the current investigation.
The current study focuses on the literacy out-
comes of children with SSD in the initial stages of
reading instruction at age 5 and 3 years later at age
8. We tested the following hypotheses:
1. There will be an overall effect of early SSD status
on literacy outcomes at both time-points.
2. When SSD co-occurs with language impairment,
this will result in poorer literacy outcomes than
isolated SSD.
3. The presence of a family risk of dyslexia will
contribute to the likelihood of a poor literacy
outcome, over and above the contribution of
speech and language status.
4. Within the group with SSD, there will be a worse
literacy outcome if the initial SSD is more severe, if
it persists to age 5, and if the speech errors can be
characterised as ‘disordered’ rather than ‘delayed’.

 intervals, between the ages of 3½ and 9 (an additional 15
children were recruited into the overarching study at Time 2,
but are not included in the current analyses, because the focus
is on SSD status at Time 1/age 3½). None met exclusionary
criteria (MZ twinning, chronic illness, deafness, English as a
second language, foster care or living in a children’s home, or a
known neurological or psychiatric disorder). Ethics approval
for the study was provided by the ethics committee of the
Department of Psychology at the University of York, and the
NHS Research Ethics Committee. Parents provided informed
consent for their child to be involved.
Following recruitment, families were classified as at family
risk (FR) or not and each child was assessed for language
impairment (LI). This led to an initial classification of children
into four groups [FR (family risk only), LI (language impairment
only), FRLI (family risk and language impairment) and TD
control (typically developing); see Nash, Hulme, Gooch, &
Snowling, 2013 for further details]. Although children were not
originally recruited on the basis of speech sound disorder, they
were assessed for this at T1, and those who met SSD criteria
are the focus of the current study. It is important to note that
many children fulfilled criteria for more than one risk category
(family risk; LI, SSD; see Table 1 for details of participants).
The study examines the progress of the sample at three time-
points of the overarching longitudinal study: T1 (age 3½), T3
(age 5½) and T5 (age 8) on a subset of measures. There was a
small amount of missing data.
Defining family risk of dyslexia, language
impairment and speech sound disorder
Family risk status.
Family risk status of dyslexia was
ascertained on the basis of a first-degree relative (biological
parent or full sibling), as is standard practice in the field.
Previous studies have mostly used parental self-report mea-
sures to determine whether a first-degree relative has dyslexia.
We considered it appropriate to validate this process with
objective assessment when possible because it is not uncom-
mon for parents with a history of reading difficulties to be
unaware that they have dyslexia. Thus, each parent who
consented, regardless of whether or not he or she self-reported
as dyslexic, was assessed to ascertain family risk status (see
below). Participating children were classified as at family risk:
if a parent self-reported as dyslexic, on the basis of the Adult
Reading Questionnaire (Snowling, Dawes, Nash, & Hulme,
2012); for parents who consented to objective testing, a literacy
composite score below 90 derived from two tests of nonword
reading and spelling (Test of Word Reading Efficiency: TOWRE,
Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 1999; and the spelling subtest
from the Wide Range Achievement Test; WRAT-4, Wilkinson &
Roberston, 2006); and a parent with a literacy composite score
below 96 AND a 1.5 SD discrepancy between literacy and
nonverbal ability (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence:
WASI, Wechsler, 1999); or a sibling with a diagnosis of dyslexia
from an educational psychologist or specialist teacher.
Language impairment.
LI status at age 3½ was deter-
mined on the basis of scoring below a cut-off on two of the
following four measures: the Expressive Vocabulary, Basic
Concepts and Sentence Structure subtests of the Clinical
Evaluation of Language Fundamentals – Preschool 2 UK (Wiig,
Secord, & Semel, 2006), and the screener from the Test of Early
Grammatical Impairment (TEGI; Rice & Wexler, 2001). The
cut-offs were a scaled score below 7 on the CELF subtests, or
failure of the TEGI screener. In a subset of cases (N = 22) with
insufficient data from these diagnostic tests, we used a
combination of further language subtests to come to a clinical
judgement of LI (Nash et al., 2013). Of the children with LI, six
had low nonverbal ability and three were unable to complete
the tests, while the remaining children in the LI group had
nonverbal ability in the normal range (>80 on the Wechsler
Preschool Primary Scale of Intelligence-III, Wechsler, 2003).
Speech sound disorder.
SSD status at age 3½ was
based on percent consonants correct (PCC) scored on the
screener and Articulation measure of the Diagnostic Evalua-
tion of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP; Dodd, Hua, Crosbie,
Holm, & Ozanne, 2002). Children were asked to name a series
of pictures including all the consonants in British English; they
were classified as having a SSD if they scored 2 standard
deviations below the mean of the TD control group (PCC
score < 74.32%). Sixty-eight children fulfilled this criterion at
T1.
At age 5½, 59 of these 68 children with a history of SSD were
available and completed the DEAP screener and articulation
measure for a second time. Children who had scored in the
average range on the DEAP at Time 1 were not asked to
complete the task again. The cut point for a designation of SSD
at Time 3 was therefore based on having a PCC more than 2
standard deviations below the age-appropriate mean in the
DEAP manual, which equated to a score of 85% PCC. Thirty-
three children met this criterion for SSD at Time 3.
Differentiating speech delay and speech disor-
der.
The DEAP Screener and Articulation tasks were used to
provide a profile of each child’s speech error pattern at Time 1.
Error patterns were assigned if a child showed five examples of
a
particular
error
type
(e.g.
fronting,
gliding
or
cluster

 reduction), excluding errors that could be explained by diffi-
culties in articulating a sound in isolation. Error patterns were
next classified as to whether they were age-appropriate,
developmentally delayed or disordered, according to the DEAP
guidelines; five instances of a disordered error type led to a
classification of ‘disordered speech’ (Dodd, personal commu-
nication, 2006). A child’s speech profile was described accord-
ing to their most serious error pattern (e.g. a child with both
delayed and disordered error patterns would be classified as
having disordered speech). About 60/68 children in the SSD
group could be clearly classified as showing either delay or
disorder at age 3½. Forty-four children showed delayed and 16
showed disordered speech errors; two did not meet criteria for
any speech pattern, one had an articulation disorder and four
had incomplete speech data.
Measures
Literacy outcome measures.
At age 5½, children com-
pleted the following measures tapping emergent literacy skills,
as part of a broader language and literacy assessment.
Analyses were based on z-scores standardised on the control
group means; composites were created by averaging the z-
scores of the relevant measures.
Phoneme awareness: (a) Phoneme isolation – children had to
identify the first (eight items) or last sound (eight items) of a
given nonword (e.g. first sound of/guf/); testing was discon-
tinued after four incorrect responses (a = .88) (b) Phoneme
deletion, from the York Assessment of Reading Comprehension
(YARC, Snowling et al., 2009) – children repeated a word, and
then said it again leaving out a specified phoneme (e.g. ‘sheep’
‘without the/p/’) (12 items) (a = .93).
Word-level reading: (a) Early Word Reading from the YARC
– children read aloud 30 single words, graded in difficulty,
half of which were phonemically decodable and half irregu-
lar. Testing was discontinued after 10 consecutive errors
(test–retest r = .95). (b) Single Word Reading Test (Foster,
2007) – children read 60 words of increasing difficulty;
testing was discontinued after five consecutive errors/re-
fusals (a = .98).
Spelling: In this bespoke task, children spelt five words,
each represented by a picture (dog, cup, tent, book, heart);
the score was the total number of words spelt correctly
(a = .79).
At age 8½, children completed the following measures, as
part of a broader assessment.
Word-level reading: (a) Sight-Word and Decoding subtests of
the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE; Torgesen et al.,
1999) – children read as many words/nonwords from a list as
they could in 45 s (a = .95). (b) Accuracy from the Passage
Reading subtest of the YARC – children read aloud a series of
short texts, with reading errors corrected up to a given number
as specified in the manual. Reading accuracy was based on the
two most difficult passages read (a = .87).
Reading comprehension: Passage Reading from the YARC –
see above; passages which were read accurately were followed
by a set of eight spoken comprehension questions. Compre-
hension ability scores were calculated based on the two most
difficult passages read (a = .64).
Spelling: Spelling words subtest of the Wechsler Individual
Ability Test (WIAT II; Wechsler, 2005) – children spelt words
increasing in difficulty. Testing was discontinued after 10
consecutive errors. (Test–retest r = .93).
Socioeconomic status.
Several measures of socioeco-
nomic circumstances were collected in the present study.
These included the father’s and mother’s occupation and
educational qualifications as well as an index of deprivation
associated with UK postcodes (Department of Communities
and
Local
Government,
Indices
of
Multiple
Deprivation,
2007). Here we report socioeconomic status (SES) based on
postcode as a centile score.
Results
Analysis plan
The first set of analyses characterise the group of
children who met criteria for SSD at the age of 3½, in
terms of their demographic characteristics, language
and family risk status, speech profile and group-level
literacy outcomes at the ages of 5½ and 8. The
second set of analyses take an individual differences
approach, and use regression models based on the
entire sample to examine SSD, language impairment
and family risk status as predictors of continuous
literacy outcomes. The final set of analyses use
regression models based on the SSD group only, to
examine the effect of the nature, persistence and
severity of SSD on literacy outcomes. We report effect
sizes where appropriate: d = 0.8 is considered large;
0.5 medium and 0.2 small.
Characterising the SSD group
Descriptive statistics for the SSD and control groups
are presented in Table 1 (the control group is defined
as having no family risk of dyslexia, and not meeting
criteria for LI or SSD at T1). The SSD and control
groups were equivalent in age, but the control group
was higher in SES and performance IQ, and had
fewer boys (nonsignificant difference). Approximately
half of the SSD group met criteria for language
impairment at T1, and half had a family risk of
dyslexia (with 22% of the SSD group meeting both LI
and FR criteria). Of the SSD group, 73% had speech
errors which indicated a speech delay and 27% had
errors indicating speech disorder. The speech diffi-
culties for over half the children persisted to the age
of school entry, with 56% of the SSD group at 3½ also
meeting criteria for SSD at age 5.
Literacy outcomes of the SSD group
The literacy skills of the SSD group were poorer than
those of the TD group, in terms of phoneme aware-
ness, word-level reading and spelling at age 5, and
word-level reading, spelling and reading comprehen-
sion at age 8. Across measures, the SSD group was
performing nearly 1 standard deviation below the TD
group mean, a significant difference for all measures
(Table 2). However, a key question is whether it is
speech difficulties that compromise literacy develop-
ment or whether the risk is actually carried by being
at family risk of dyslexia or by broader oral language
difficulties (both of which co-occur with speech
difficulties). The mean z-scores on the literacy mea-
sures for subgroups of children with SSD classified
according
to
co-occurring
language
impairment
and/or family risk status are presented in Figure 1.

 As can be seen from Figure 1, children with isolated
SSD were performing consistently below the level of
the typically developing group (�.2 to �.6 SD).
Furthermore, the outcomes for children with SSD
and co-occurring LI were substantially lower, par-
ticularly at age 5, (�1 to �1.5 SD) and children who
in addition to SSD and LI also had a family risk of
dyslexia had the most severe and persistent literacy
difficulties, with mean scores approximately �1.5 SD
at both ages 5½ and 8. Although the effect sizes were
generally moderate to large, most of the group
comparisons illustrated in Figure 1 did not reach
statistical significance, as indicated by the overlap-
ping 95% confidence intervals.
Predicting literacy outcomes on the basis of SSD and
LI status, and family risk of dyslexia
A series of simultaneous multiple regression models
examined the influence of SSD and LI status at age
3½, and family risk of dyslexia (represented by
dummy codes) on short-term (age 5½) and long-term
(age 8) literacy outcomes (Table 3). These models
explained between 8% and 20% of the variance in
literacy scores. The use of simultaneous entry in
these models means that the unique R2 values
represent the variance accounted for by each pre-
dictor after the effects of other predictors in the
model have been controlled.
The presence of SSD at T1 was a fairly weak
predictor of outcomes, though it did account for
statistically significant unique variance in phoneme
awareness (5.8%) and spelling at age 5½, (3.4%) and
word reading at age 8 (1.9%). In contrast, language
impairment at T1 was a stronger predictor, account-
ing for statistically significant unique variance (be-
tween 2% and 10%) in all outcome measures. Family
risk status had effects that were stronger than the
effects
of SSD but
weaker than
the effects
of
language impairment, accounting for statistically
significant
unique
variance
(between
0.9%
and
3.8%) in word reading at age 5½ and word reading,
spelling and reading comprehension at age 8.
These models were rerun including Performance
IQ at T1 as a covariate. The pattern of significant
predictive
relationships
remained
unchanged,
except for the fact that the relationship between
language impairment at T1 and spelling at age 8 was
reduced to nonsignificant levels.
The nature, persistence and severity of SSD in
relation to literacy outcomes
To assess whether the severity or type of speech
difficulty (disordered vs. delayed) at age 3½, or its
persistence to age 5½ (persistent vs. resolved) pre-
dicted subsequent literacy outcomes, we computed
correlations between these variables and literacy
outcomes among children with SSD only (Table 4).
Severity of SSD at age 3½ did not correlate appre-
ciably with any of the literacy outcome measures.
Point biserial correlations showed that the persis-
tence of SSD to age 5½ correlated significantly with
phoneme awareness and word reading measured
concurrently (16% and 21% of the variance respec-
tively). In addition, disordered speech errors are
associated with poorer word reading at age 5½ (7.6%
of the variance). None of the predictors were signif-
icantly associated with literacy outcomes at age 8.
Discussion
We followed the progress of children with SSD
through the early stages of literacy development
from age 5½ to 8 years, comparing them with typi-
cally developing controls. Of particular interest was

 the outcome of children with isolated SSD compared
with those of children who had co-occurring lan-
guage impairment (LI) and/or those at family risk of
dyslexia.
What is the effect of early SSD status on literacy
outcomes?
We found that, as a group, children identified with
SSD at the age of 3½ performed more poorly than
typically developing peers on measures of phoneme
awareness, word-level reading and spelling around
the point of school entry and on word-level reading,
spelling, and reading comprehension 3 years later,
with large effect sizes. However, when the group was
subdivided according to co-occurring conditions,
those with isolated SSD showed problems only at
the younger age with phoneme awareness and
spelling. Consistent with this, SSD status at age 3½
accounted for up to 5.8% of the variance in early
phonemic and spelling skills when LI and FR status
were controlled but only up to 1.9% of the variance at
age 8 (though its effects on word reading were
significant at p < .05). It follows that the risk of poor
literacy in children with isolated SSD is low, with
only modest and mostly short-lived effects on literacy
development, with the skills most closely related to
speech in the early stage of development being
affected, namely phoneme awareness and spelling.
It seems that most children recover from this early
set back.
Does comorbid LI lead to poorer literacy outcomes
than SSD alone?
In line with predictions, the outcome for children
with SSD and co-occurring language impairment
was poorer than for SSD alone. The literacy skills of
children with SSD and LI were significantly impaired
relative to controls and children who in addition were
at family risk of dyslexia showed the most significant
impairments. When both SSD and FR dyslexia were
controlled, LI status at age 3½ T1 accounted for
significant amounts of variance in early literacy

 skills and continued to predict later development
especially of reading comprehension.
Does family risk of dyslexia contribute to the
likelihood of a poor literacy outcome, over and
above speech and language status?
Children with SSD who were also at family risk of
dyslexia showed significant impairments relative to
TD controls in phoneme awareness, reading and
spelling skills which persisted except for spelling at
age 8. The impairments were more marked if LI was
also present. In and of itself FR status accounted for
a small but significant amount of variance in literacy
outcomes when speech and language difficulties
were controlled, supporting the findings of Carroll
et al. (2014) and Puolakanaho et al. (2007). It should
be noted, however, that it does not predict either
phoneme awareness or spelling at age 5½, plausibly
because at this stage most variance in these skills is
associated with speech status 2 years earlier when
many children at family risk of dyslexia show speech
difficulties.
Does the initial severity or nature of the SSD or its
persistence to age 5 predict literacy outcomes?
Contrary to prediction, the severity of SSD had a
negligible effect on the development of literacy skills
within the SSD group. The propensity to make disor-
dered speecherrors was a significantpredictor of word
reading – but not phoneme awareness – at age 5½,
contrary to previous findings (Holm et al., 2008;
Leit~
ao et al., 1997). Persistence on the other hand
predicted both phoneme awareness and word reading
at age 5½, but not at age 8. It may be that the effects are
short-lived because children are able to draw on
compensatory mechanisms, for example in ortho-
graphic learning, to aid literacy development despite
early deficits (e.g. Peterson et al., 2009; Treiman,
Pennington, Shriberg, & Boada, 2008).
Together, our findings are broadly consistent with
those reported in previous studies of speech sound
disorder (Bird et al., 1995; Bishop & Adams, 1990;
DeThorne et al., 2006; Lewis et al., 2000; Nathan
et al., 2004). However, it is clear that the impact of
speech sound disorder on literacy development is
relatively short-lived (cf. Leitao & Fletcher, 2004) and
we found no strong evidence that disordered (rather
than immature) speech errors are indicative of more
serious deficits in phonological awareness and liter-
acy (cf. Holm et al., 2008; Leitao & Fletcher, 2004;
Leit~
ao et al., 1997; Preston et al., 2013). The situa-
tion is different when SSD co-occurs with language
impairment as it frequently does: language impair-
ment carries a strong risk of literacy difficulties
affecting both word reading and reading comprehen-
sion skills. Similarly, when SSD persists to school
entry
when
reading
instruction
begins,
it
has
concurrent effects on phoneme awareness and read-
ing skills, consistent with the critical age hypothesis
(Bishop & Adams, 1990).
The present study has limitations. First, although
thesampleofchildrenwithSSDwasreasonableinsize,
the number of children in the different subgroups was
small, limiting statistical power to detect the differ-
ences between these subgroups (e.g. between children
with SSD and LI and children with SSD and family risk
of dyslexia). Second, the study takes account of the
persistence of SSD over time but only considers the
impact of LI as ascertained at the first time-point and
not according to persistence (see Snowling, Duff,
Nash, & Hulme, 2015 for discussion of the persistence
of LI in this sample). Nevertheless, the findings add to
the growing body of evidence that speech difficulties in
preschool confer only a slight risk of poor literacy
outcomes unless they are accompanied by language
difficulties (Pennington & Bishop, 2009).
Together, our results indicate a relatively minor role
for early SSD as a risk factor for the development of
dyslexia, within a framework which suggests that risk
factors accumulate to have a negative effect on literacy
development (the multiple-risk model). The impact of
SSD per se appears to be primarily on early literacy-
related skills, with its effects lessening over time; in
contrast, the impact of LI with which it is frequently
comorbid increases over time and affects the devel-
opment of both word reading and reading compre-
hension skills (Hulme et al., 2015). Over and above
the effects of speech and language difficulties on
literacy development, being at family risk of dyslexia is
an additional risk factor for literacy difficulties. While
its unique effects are small, it is important to consider
what might account for this influence. One plausible
mechanism is that family risk is associated with
environmental influences that affect learning to read;
indeed using data from the current sample, Dilnot,
Hamilton, Maughan, and Snowling (2016) showed
that once socioeconomic and home literacy environ-
mental influences are accounted for, family risk of
dyslexia no longer accounts for significant variance in
reading readiness. Alternatively, the influence of
family risk might be attributable to sources of vari-
ance, for example in executive and motor skills, not
controlled in the present analyses.
Conclusions
Speech difficulties impede communication and are a
cause of concern for parents often leading to referral
to speech and language services. We have shown
that these difficulties have weak associations with
the development of phonological skills in the early
years and hence literacy can get off to a slow start.
However, unless there are co-occurring problems,
children with speech sound disorder are not at high
risk of reading difficulties. A family history of literacy
problems (not unlikely given the genetic overlap
between SSD and dyslexia) should alert the clinician

 to the need to monitor the development of a child
with SSD through the early stages of literacy devel-
opment. More importantly, a co-occurring language
impairment will place the child at high risk of
difficulties learning to read and appropriate inter-
ventions should be put in place.

Key points
• Speech difficulties which persist to the point of school entry are associated with weak emergent literacy skills
at the age of 5½, but these effects are no longer apparent at 8 years.
• Disordered speech errors are associated with poorer word reading at age 5½, but these effects are also short-
lived and not apparent at age 8.
• Early language impairment which co-occurs with speech difficulties is predictive of poor word-level literacy at
both 5½ and 8, and of reading comprehension at age 8.
• Having a family risk of dyslexia has a small but significant effect on literacy at both ages, above and beyond
the effects of speech and language.
