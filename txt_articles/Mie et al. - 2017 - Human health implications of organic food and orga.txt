Abstract
This review summarises existing evidence on the impact of organic food on human health. It compares organic vs.
conventional food production with respect to parameters important to human health and discusses the potential
impact of organic management practices with an emphasis on EU conditions. Organic food consumption may
reduce the risk of allergic disease and of overweight and obesity, but the evidence is not conclusive due to likely
residual confounding, as consumers of organic food tend to have healthier lifestyles overall. However, animal
experiments suggest that identically composed feed from organic or conventional production impacts in different
ways on growth and development. In organic agriculture, the use of pesticides is restricted, while residues in
conventional fruits and vegetables constitute the main source of human pesticide exposures. Epidemiological
studies have reported adverse effects of certain pesticides on children’s cognitive development at current levels of
exposure, but these data have so far not been applied in formal risk assessments of individual pesticides.
Differences in the composition between organic and conventional crops are limited, such as a modestly higher
content of phenolic compounds in organic fruit and vegetables, and likely also a lower content of cadmium in
organic cereal crops. Organic dairy products, and perhaps also meats, have a higher content of omega-3 fatty acids
compared to conventional products. However, these differences are likely of marginal nutritional significance. Of
greater concern is the prevalent use of antibiotics in conventional animal production as a key driver of antibiotic
resistance in society; antibiotic use is less intensive in organic production. Overall, this review emphasises several
documented and likely human health benefits associated with organic food production, and application of such
production methods is likely to be beneficial within conventional agriculture, e.g., in integrated pest management.

Background
The long-term goal of developing sustainable food
systems is considered a high priority by several intergov-
ernmental organisations [1–3]. Different agricultural
management systems may have an impact on the sus-
tainability of food systems, as they may affect human
health as well as animal wellbeing, food security and
environmental sustainability. In this paper, we review the
available evidence on links between farming system
(conventional vs organic) and human health.
Food production methods are not always easy to clas-
sify. This complexity stems from not only the number and
varying forms of conventional and organic agricultural
systems but also resulting from the overlap of these sys-
tems. In this paper, we use the term “conventional agricul-
ture” as the predominant type of intensive agriculture in
the European Union (EU), typically with high inputs of
synthetic pesticides and mineral fertilisers, and a high pro-
portion of conventionally-produced concentrate feed in
animal production. Conversely, “organic agriculture” is in
accordance with EU regulations or similar standards for
organic
production,
comprising
the
use

 fertilisers such as farmyard and green manure, a predom-
inant reliance on ecosystem services and non-chemical
measures for pest prevention and control and livestock ac-
cess to open air and roughage feed.
In 2015, over 50.9 million hectares, in 179 countries
around the world, were cultivated organically, including
areas in conversion [4]. The area under organic manage-
ment (fully converted and in-conversion) has increased
during the last decades in the European Union, where bind-
ing standards for organic production have been developed
[5, 6]. In the 28 countries forming the EU today, the
fraction of organically cultivated land of total agricultural
area has been steadily increasing over the last three de-
cades. 0.1%, 0.6%, 3.6%, and 6.2% of agricultural land
were organic in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015, respectively,
equalling 11.2 million ha in 2015 [7–9]. In 7 EU Member
States, at least 10% of the agricultural land is organic [7].
In 2003, 125,000 farms in the EU were active in organic
agriculture, a number that increased to 185,000 in 2013
[10]. Between 2006 and 2015, the organic retail market
has grown by 107% in the EU, to €27.1 billion [7].
This review details the science on the effects of
organic food and organic food production on human
health and includes
(1)studies that directly address such effects in
epidemiological studies and clinical trials.
(2)animal and in vitro studies that evaluate biological
effects of organic compared to conventional feed
and food.
Focusing on narrower aspects of production, we then
discuss the impact of the production system on
(3)plant protection, pesticide exposure, and effects of
pesticides on human health,
(4)plant nutrition, the composition of crops and the
relevance for human health,
(5)animal feeding regimens, effects on the composition
of animal foods and the relevance for human health.
(6)animal health and well-being, the use of antibiotics
in animal production, its role in the development of
antibiotic resistance, and consequences of antibiotic
resistance for public health.
In the discussion, we widen the perspective from pro-
duction system to food system and sustainable diets and
address the interplay of agricultural production system
and individual food choices. The consequences of these
aspects on public health are briefly discussed.
Due to a limited evidence base, minimal importance,
lack of a plausible link between production system and
health, or due to lack of relevance in the European
Union, we do not or only briefly touch upon
(1)singular food safety events such as outbreaks of
diseases that are not clearly caused by the
production system (hygiene regulations for plant
production and for animal slaughtering and
processing are for the most part identical for organic
and conventional agriculture) or fraudulent
introduction of contaminated feed into the feed
market
(2)historic events and historic sources of exposure,
such as the BSE crisis caused by the now-banned
practice of feeding cattle with meat and bone meal
from cattle, or continuing effects of the historic use
of DDT, now banned in all agricultural contexts
globally
(3)contaminants from food packaging
(4)aspects of food processing, such as food additives
(5)the presence of mycotoxins in consequence of post-
harvest storage and processing which is governed
chiefly by moisture and temperature in storage
(6)the use of growth hormones in animal production,
which is not permitted in the EU but in several
other countries
Furthermore, aspects of environmental sustainability,
such as biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions, may
also be affected by the agricultural production system
[11, 12] and may affect human health via food security
[13, 14]. While these indirect links are outside the scope
of this review, we briefly touch on them in the discus-
sion. Also, the focus of this article is on public health,
not on occupational health of agricultural workers or
local residents, although these issues are considered as
part of the epidemiological evidence on pesticide effects.
While agricultural standards vary between countries and
regions, we maintain a global perspective when appro-
priate and otherwise focus on the European perspective.
The literature search for this review was carried out at
first using the PubMed and Web of Science databases,
while applying “organic food” or “organic agriculture”
along with the most relevant keywords, through to the
end of 2016 (more recent references were included,
when
relevant,
although
they
were
not
identified
through the systematic search). We made use of existing
systematic reviews and meta-analyses when possible. In
some cases, where scientific literature is scarce, we
included grey literature e.g. from authorities and inter-
governmental organisations. We also considered refer-
ences cited in the sources located.
Association between organic food consumption and
health: Findings from human studies
A growing literature is aiming at characterizing individ-
ual lifestyles, motivations and dietary patterns in regard
to organic food consumption, which is generally defined
Mie et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:111 
Page 2 of 22
 from responses obtained from food frequency question-
naires [15–23]. Still, current research on the role of
organic food consumption in human health is scarce, as
compared to other nutritional epidemiology topics. In
particular, long-term interventional studies aiming to
identify potential links between organic food consump-
tion and health are lacking, mainly due to high costs.
Prospective cohort studies constitute a feasible way of
examining
such
relationships,
although
compliance
assessment is challenging. Considering a lack of biomarkers
of exposure, the evaluation of the exposure, i.e. organic
food consumption, will necessarily be based on self-
reported data that may be prone to measurement error.
Some recent reviews have compiled the findings
[24–26] from clinical studies addressing the associ-
ation
between
consumption
of
organic
food
and
health. These studies are scant and generally based
on very small populations and short durations, thus
limiting statistical power and the possibility to identify
long-term effects. Smith-Spangler et al. [25] summarised
the evidence from clinical studies that overall no clinically
significant differences in biomarkers related to health or to
nutritional status between participants consuming organic
food compared to controls consuming conventional food.
Among
studies
of
nutrient
intakes,
the
OrgTrace
cross-over intervention study of 33 males, the plant-based
fraction of the diets was produced in controlled field
trials, but 12 days of intervention did not reveal any
effect of the production system on the overall intake
or bioavailability of zinc and copper, or plasma status
of carotenoids [27, 28].
In observational studies, a specific challenge is the fact
that consumers who regularly buy organic food tend to
choose more vegetables, fruit, wholegrain products and
less meat, and tend to have overall healthier dietary pat-
terns [18, 29]. Each of these dietary characteristics is as-
sociated with a decreased risk for mortality from or
incidence of certain chronic diseases [30–36]. Con-
sumers who regularly buy organic food are also more
physically active and less likely to smoke [18, 19, 37].
Depending on the outcome of interest, associations be-
tween organic vs conventional food consumption and
health outcome therefore need to be carefully adjusted
for differences in dietary quality and lifestyle factors, and
the likely presence of residual confounding needs to be
considered. In children, several studies have reported a
lower prevalence of allergy and/or atopic disease in fam-
ilies with a lifestyle comprising the preference of organic
food [38–44]. However, organic food consumption is
part of a broader lifestyle in most of these studies and
associated with other lifestyle factors. Thus, in the Koala
birth cohort of 2700 mothers and babies from the
Netherlands [39], exclusive consumption of organic
dairy products during pregnancy and during infancy was
associated with a 36% reduction in the risk of eczema at
age 2 years. In this cohort, the preference of organic
food was associated with a higher content of ruminant
fatty acids in breast milk [40], which in turn was associ-
ated with a lower odds ratio for parent-reported eczema
until age 2y [45].
In the MOBA birth cohort study of 28,000 mothers
and
their
offspring,
women
reporting
a
frequent
consumption of organic vegetables during pregnancy
exhibited a reduction in risk of pre-eclampsia [29]
(OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99). No significant associ-
ation was observed for overall organic food consump-
tion, or five other food groups, and pre-eclampsia.
The first prospective study investigating weight change
over time according to the level of organic food consump-
tion included 62,000 participants of the NutriNet-Santé
study. BMI increase over time was lower among high
consumers of organic food compared to low consumers
(mean difference as % of baseline BMI = − 0.16, 95% Con-
fidence Interval (CI): −0.32; −0.01). A 31% (95% CI: 18%;
42%) reduction in risk of obesity was observed among
high consumers of organic food compared to low con-
sumers. Two separate strategies were chosen to properly
adjust for confounders [46]. This paper thus confirms
earlier cross-sectional analyses from the same study [18].
In regard to chronic diseases, the number of studies is
limited. In the Nutrinet-Santé study, organic food con-
sumers (occasional and regular), as compared to non-
consumers, exhibited a lower incidence of hypertension,
type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia (in both males and
females), and cardiovascular disease (in men) [47] but
more frequently declared a history of cancer. Inherent to
cross-sectional studies, reverse causation cannot be
excluded; for example, a cancer diagnosis by itself may
lead to positive dietary changes [48].
Only one prospective cohort study conducted in adults
addressed the effect of organic food consumption on
cancer
incidence.
Among
623,080
middle-aged

women, the association between organic food consump-
tion and the risk of cancer was estimated during a
follow-up period of 9.3 y. Participants reported their
organic food consumption through a frequency question
as never, sometimes, or usually/always. The overall risk
of cancer was not associated with organic food con-
sumption, but a significant reduction in risk of non-
Hodgkin lymphoma was observed in participants who
usually/always
consume
organic
food
compared
to
people who never consume organic food (RR = 0.79,
95% CI: 0.65; 0.96) [37].
In conclusion, the link between organic food con-
sumption and health remains insufficiently documented
in epidemiological studies. Thus, well-designed studies
characterized by prospective design, long-term duration
and sufficient sample size permitting high statistical

and
sources
(i.e.
conventional or organic).
Experimental in vitro and animal studies
In vitro studies
The focus on single plant components in the com-
parison
of
crops
from
organic
and
conventional
production, as discussed further below, disregards the
fact that compounds in food do not exist and act
separately, but in their natural context [49]. In vitro
studies of effects of entire foods in biological systems
such as cell lines can therefore potentially point at
effects
that
cannot
be
predicted
from
chemical
analyses of foods, although a limitation is that most
cells in humans are not in direct contact with food
or food extracts.
Two studies have investigated the effect of organic and
conventional crop cultivation on cancer cell lines, both
using crops produced under well-documented agricul-
tural practices and with several agricultural and bio-
logical
replicates.
In
the
first
study
extracts
from
organically grown strawberries exhibited stronger anti-
proliferative activity against one colon and one breast
cancer cell line, compared to the conventionally pro-
duced strawberries [50]. In the second study [51] the
extracts of organic naturally fermented beetroot juices
induced lower levels of early apoptosis and higher levels
of late apoptosis and necrosis in a gastric cancer cell
line, compared to the conventional extracts. Both studies
thus demonstrated notable differences in the biological
activity of organic vs. conventionally produced crop
extracts in vitro, which should inspire further research.
However, neither of these studies allows for the distinc-
tion of a selective antiproliferative effect on cancer cells,
and general cell toxicity. Therefore it cannot be deter-
mined which of the organic or conventional food
extracts, if any, had the preferable biological activity in
terms of human health.
Animal studies of health effects
Considering the difficulties of performing long-term
dietary intervention studies in humans, animal studies
offer some potential of studying long-term health
effects of foods in vivo. However, extrapolation of the
results from animal studies to humans is not straight-
forward. Studies in this field started almost 100 years
ago. A review of a large number of studies [52] con-
cluded that positive effects of organic feed on animal
health are possible, but further research is necessary
to confirm these findings. Here we focus on the main
health aspects.
In one of the best-designed animal studies, the second
generation chickens receiving the conventionally grown
feed demonstrated a faster growth rate. However, after
an immune challenge, chickens receiving organic feed
recovered more quickly [53]. This resistance to the
challenge has been interpreted as a sign of better health
[54, 55].
In one carefully conducted crop production experi-
ment, followed by a rat feeding trial, the production
system had an apparent effect on plasma-IgG concentra-
tions but not on other markers of nutritional or immune
status [56]. A two-generational rat study based on feed
grown in a factorial design (fertilisation x plant protec-
tion) of organic and conventional practices revealed that
the production system had an effect on several physio-
logical,
endocrine
and
immune
parameters
in
the
offspring [57]. Most of the effects identified were related
to the fertilisation regimen. None of these studies
found that any of the feed production systems was more
supportive of animal health.
Several other studies, mostly in rats, have reported
some
effect
of
the
feed
production
system
on
immune system parameters [57–60]. However, the
direct relevance of these findings for human health
is uncertain.
Collectively, in vitro and animal studies have demon-
strated that the crop production system does have an
impact on certain aspects of cell life, the immune sys-
tem, and overall growth and development. However, the
direct relevance of these findings for human health is
unclear. On the other hand, these studies may provide
plausibility to potential effects of conventional and
organic foods on human health. Still, most of the
outcomes observed in animal studies have not been
examined in humans so far.
Pesticides
Plant protection in organic and conventional agriculture
Plant protection in conventional agriculture is largely
dependent on the use of synthetic pesticides. Conversely,
organic farming generally relies on prevention and bio-
logical means for plant protection, such as crop rotation,
intercropping,
resistant
varieties,
biological
control
employing natural enemies, hygiene practices and other
measures [61–64]. Yet, certain pesticides are approved
for use in organic agriculture. In the EU, pesticides (in
this context, more specifically chemical plant-protection
products; micro- and macrobiological agents are ex-
cluded from this discussion due to their low relevance
for human health) are approved after an extensive evalu-
ation, including a range of toxicological tests in animal
studies [65]. Acceptable residue concentrations in food
are calculated from the same documentation and from
the
expected
concentrations

accordance
with

 approved uses of the pesticides. Currently, 385 sub-
stances are authorised as pesticides in the EU (Table 1).
Of these, 26 are also approved for use in organic agricul-
ture [6, 66] as evaluated in accordance with the same
legal framework.
Most of the pesticides approved for organic agriculture
are of comparatively low toxicological concern for con-
sumers because they are not associated with any identi-
fied toxicity (e.g. spearmint oil, quartz sand), because
they are part of a normal diet or constitute human nutri-
ents (e.g. iron, potassium bicarbonate, rapeseed oil) or
because they are approved for use in insect traps only
and therefore have a negligible risk of entering the food
chain (i.e. the synthetic pyrethroids lambda-cyhalothrin
and deltamethrin, and pheromones). Two notable excep-
tions are the pyrethrins and copper. Pyrethrins, a plant
extract from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium, share the
same mechanism of action as the synthetic pyrethroid
insecticides, but are less stable. Copper is an essential
nutrient for plants, animals and humans, although toxic
at high intakes and of ecotoxicological concern due to
toxicity to aquatic organisms.
Plant
protection
practices
developed
in
and
for
organic agriculture may be of benefit to the entire
agricultural system [67–70]. This is of specific value
for the transition towards sustainable use of pesticides
in the EU, which has a strong emphasis on non-
chemical
plant
protection
measures
including
prevention and biological agents [63, 64]. Further,
steam treatment of cereal seeds for the prevention of
fungal diseases (http://thermoseed.se/) has been devel-
oped driven by the needs of organic agriculture as an
alternative
to
chemical
seed
treatments
[71,
72].
These methods are now also being marketed for

 conventional agriculture, specifically for integrated pest
management (IPM) [73].
Pesticide use – Exposure of consumers and producers
One main advantage of organic food production is the
restricted use of synthetic pesticides [5, 6], which leads
to low residue levels in foods and thus lower pesticide
exposure for consumers. It also reduces the occupational
exposure of farm workers to pesticides and drift expo-
sures of rural populations. On average over the last three
available years, EFSA reports pesticide residues below
Maximum Residue Levels (MRL) in 43.7% of all and
13.8% of organic food samples. MRLs reflect the ap-
proved use of a pesticide rather than the toxicological
relevance of the residue. There are no separate MRLs
for organic products. A total of 2.8% of all and 0.9% of
organic samples exceeded the MRL, which may be due
to
high
residue
levels
or
due
to
low
levels
but
unapproved use of a particular pesticide on a particular
crop [74–76]. Of higher toxicological relevance are risk
assessments,
i.e.
expected
exposure
in
relation
to
toxicological reference values. On average 1.5% of the
samples were calculated to exceed the acute reference
dose (ARfD) for any of the considered dietary scenarios,
with the organophosphate chlorpyrifos accounting for
approximately half of these cases and azole fungicides
(imazalil, prochloraz, and thiabendazole) for approxi-
mately 15%. None (0%) of the organic samples exceeded
the ARfD [74]. Residues of more than one pesticide were
found in approximately 25% of the samples but calcula-
tions of cumulative risks were not included in the
reports [74–76].
The only cumulative chronic risk assessment compar-
ing organic and conventional products known to us has
been performed in Sweden. Using the hazard index (HI)
method [77], adults consuming 500 g of fruit, vegeta-
bles and berries per day in average proportions had a
calculated HI of 0.15, 0.021 and 0.0003, under the
assumption of imported conventional, domestic con-
ventional,
and
organic
products,
respectively
[78].
This indicates an at least 70 times lower exposure
weighted by toxicity for a diet based on organic
foods. There are several routes by which pesticides
not approved for use in organic agriculture may con-
taminate organic products, including spray drift or
volatilisation from neighbouring fields, fraudulent use,
contamination during transport and storage in vessels
or storages where previously conventional products
have been contained, and mislabelling by intention or
mistake. Overall, however, current systems for the
certification and control of organic products ensure a
low level of pesticide contamination as indicated by
chronic and acute risks above, although they still can
be improved [79].
The general population’s exposure to several pesticides
can be measured by analysing blood and urine samples,
as is routinely done in the US [80] although not yet in
Europe. However, a few scattered European studies from
France [81–83], Germany [84], the Netherlands [85],
Spain [86], Belgium [87], Poland [88] and Denmark [89]
have shown that EU citizens are commonly exposed to
organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides. A general
observation has been higher urinary concentrations of
pesticide metabolites in children compared to adults,
most likely reflecting children’s higher food intake in
relation to body weight and maybe also more exposure-
prone behaviours. The urinary concentrations of generic
metabolites of organophosphates (dialkyl phosphates,
DAPs) and pyrethroids (3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-PBA)
found in most of the European studies were similar to or
higher than in the US studies. Although urinary metab-
olite concentration might overestimate the exposure to
the parent compounds, due to ingestion of preformed
metabolites in food items, several studies have reported
associations between urinary metabolite concentrations
and neurobehavioral deficits as described below. Besides,
the metabolites are not always less toxic than the parent
compounds [90].
For the general population, pesticide residues in food
constitute the main source of exposure for the general
population. This has been illustrated in intervention
studies where the urinary excretion of pesticides was
markedly reduced after 1 week of limiting consumption
to organic food [91–93]. Similar conclusions emerged
from studies investigating associations between urinary
concentrations of pesticides and questionnaire informa-
tion on food intake, frequency of different foodstuffs
and organic food choices. Thus a high intake of fruit
and vegetables is positively correlated with pesticide
excretion [94], and frequent consumption of organic
produce is associated with lower urinary pesticide
concentration [95].
Pesticide exposure and health effects
The regulatory risk assessment of pesticides currently
practised in the EU is comprehensive, as a large number
of toxicological effects are addressed in animal and other
experimental studies. Nonetheless, there are concerns
that this risk assessment is inadequate at addressing
mixed exposures, specifically for carcinogenic effects
[96] as well as endocrine-disrupting effects [97, 98] and
neurotoxicity [99]. Furthermore, there are concerns that
test protocols lag behind independent science [100],
studies from independent science are not fully consid-
ered [101] and data gaps are accepted too readily [102].
These concerns primarily relate to effects of chronic
exposure and to chronic effects of acute exposure, which
are generally more difficult to discover than acute
Mie et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:111 
Page 6 of 22
 effects. Most studies rely on urinary excretion of pesti-
cide metabolites and a common assumption is that the
subjects were exposed to the parent chemicals, rather
than the metabolites.
The overall health benefits of high fruit and vegetable
consumption are well documented [31, 35]. However, as
recently indicated for effects on semen quality [103],
these benefits might be compromised by the adverse ef-
fects of pesticide residues. When benefits are offset by a
contaminant, a situation of inverse confounding occurs,
which may be very difficult to adjust for [104]. The
potential negative effects of dietary pesticide residues on
consumer health should of course not be used as an
argument for reducing fruit and vegetable consumption.
Neither should nutrient contents be used to justify expo-
sures to pesticides. Exposures related to the production
of conventional crops (i.e. occupational or drift exposure
from spraying) have been related to an increased risk of
some diseases including Parkinson’s disease [105–107],
type 2 diabetes [108, 109] and certain types of cancers
including non-Hodgkin lymphoma [110] and childhood
leukaemia or lymphomas, e.g. after occupational expos-
ure during pregnancy [105, 111] or residential use of
pesticides during pregnancy [105, 112] or childhood
[113]. To which extent these findings also relate to expo-
sures from pesticide residues in food is unclear. How-
ever, foetal life and early childhood are especially
vulnerable periods for exposure to neurotoxicants and
endocrine disruptors. Even brief occupational exposure
during the first weeks of pregnancy, before women know
they are pregnant, have been related to adverse long-
lasting effects on their children’s growth, brain functions
and sexual development, in a Danish study on green-
house worker’s children [114–118].
In order to assess the potential health risk for con-
sumers associated with exposure to dietary pesticides,
reliance on epidemiological studies of sensitive health
outcomes and their links to exposure measures is
needed. Such studies are complicated both by difficult
exposure
assessment
and
the
necessary
long-term
follow-up. The main focus so far has been on cognitive
deficits in children in relation to their mother’s exposure
level to organophosphate insecticides during pregnancy.
This line of research is highly appropriate given the
known neurotoxicity of many pesticides in laboratory
animal models [99] and the substantial vulnerability of
the human brain during early development [119].
Most of the human studies have been carried out in
the US and have focused on assessing brain functions in
children in relation to prenatal organophosphate expos-
ure.
In
a
longitudinal
birth
cohort
study
among
farmworkers in California (the CHAMACOS cohort),
maternal urinary concentrations of organophosphate
metabolites in pregnancy were associated with abnormal
reflexes in neonates [120], adverse mental development
at 2 years of age [121], attention problems at three and a
half and 5 years [122], and poorer intellectual develop-
ment at 7 years [123]. In accordance with this, a birth
cohort
study
from
New
York
reported
impaired
cognitive development at ages 12 and 24 months and 6
– 9 years related to maternal urine concentrations of or-
ganophosphates in pregnancy [124]. In another New
York inner-city birth cohort, the concentration of the or-
ganophosphate chlorpyrifos in umbilical cord blood was
associated with delayed psychomotor and mental devel-
opment in children in the first 7 years of life [125],
poorer working memory and full-scale IQ at 7 years of
age [126], structural changes, including decreased cor-
tical thickness, in the brain of the children at school age
[127], and mild to moderate tremor in the arms at
11 years of age [128]. Based on these and similar studies,
chlorpyrifos has recently been categorised as a human
developmental neurotoxicant [129]. Recent reviews of
neurodevelopmental effects of organophosphate insecti-
cides in humans conclude that exposure during preg-
nancy – at levels commonly found in the general
population – likely have negative effects on children’s
neurodevelopment [130–132]. In agreement with this
conclusion, organophosphate pesticides considered to
cause endocrine disruption contribute the largest annual
health cost within the EU due to human exposures to
such compounds, and these costs are primarily due to
neurodevelopmental toxicity, as discussed below.
Since growth and functional development of the
human brain continues during childhood, the postnatal
period is also assumed to be vulnerable to neurotoxic
exposures [119]. Accordingly, five-year-old children from
the CHAMACOS cohort had higher risk scores for
development of attention deficit hyperactive disorder
(ADHD) if their urine concentration of organophosphate
metabolites was elevated [122]. Based on cross-sectional
data from the NHANES data base, the risk of developing
ADHD increases by 55% for a ten-fold increase in the
urinary concentration of organophosphate metabolites
in children aged 8 to 15 years [133]. Also based on the
NHANES data, children with detectable concentrations
of pyrethroids in their urine are twice as likely to have
ADHD compared with those below the detection limit
[134]. In addition, associations between urinary concen-
trations
of
pyrethroid
metabolites
in
children
and
parent-reported learning disabilities, ADHD or other
behavioural problems in the children have recently been
reported in studies from the US and Canada [135, 136].
So far only few prospective studies from the EU
addressing associations between urinary levels of pesti-
cides and neurodevelopment in children from the gen-
eral population have been published. Three studies are
based on the PELAGIE cohort in France and present
Mie et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:111 
Page 7 of 22
 results for organophosphates and pyrethroids respect-
ively [81, 82, 137]. While no adverse effects on cognitive
function in six-year-old children were related to mater-
nal urine concentrations of organophosphates during
pregnancy, the concentration of pyrethroid metabolites
was associated with internalising difficulties in the
children at 6 years of age. Also, the children’s own urin-
ary concentrations of pyrethroid metabolites were re-
lated to decrements in verbal and memory functions and
externalising difficulties and abnormal social behaviour.
While this sole European study did not corrobor-
ate US birth cohort studies results showing that expos-
ure during pregnancy to organophosphate insecticides at
levels found in the general population may harm brain
development in the foetus, the exposure levels measured
in the PELAGIE cohort were considerably lower for both
organophosphates and pyrethroids than those measured
in other European studies as well as in studies from the
US and Canada. For example, the median urine concen-
tration of organophosphate metabolites in pregnant
women in the PELAGIE cohort was 2 – 6 times lower
than for pregnant women in other studies [85, 122, 138]
and the concentration of the common pyrethroid metab-
olite 3-PBA was only detectable in urine samples from
30% of the women compared to 80–90% in other studies
[88, 139]. Thus, to supplement the French study and the
previously
mentioned
Danish
study
of
greenhouse
worker’s children, additional studies that include more
representative
exposure
levels
for
EU
citizens
are
desirable.
Although exposure levels found in European countries
are generally similar to or slightly higher than concentra-
tions found in the US studies, the risk of adverse effects
on neurodevelopment in European populations needs to
be further characterised. The organophosphate insecti-
cides contributing to the exposure might differ between
the US and the EU, also in regard to oral and respiratory
intakes. According to the European Food Safety Agency
(EFSA), of all the organophosphate insecticides, chlorpyr-
ifos most often exceeds the toxicological reference value
(ARfD) [74]. A recent report utilised US data on adverse
effects on children’s IQ levels at school age to calculate
the approximate costs of organophosphate exposure in
the EU. The total number of IQ points lost due to these
pesticides was estimated to be 13 million per year, repre-
senting a value of about € 125 billion [140], i.e. about 1%
of the EU’s gross domestic product. Although there is
some uncertainty associated with this calculation, it
most likely represents an underestimation, as it focused
only on one group of pesticides.
Unfortunately, epidemiological evidence linking pesti-
cide
exposure
and
human
health
effects
is
rarely
regarded as sufficiently reliable to take into account in
the risk assessment conducted by regulatory agencies.
For example, the conclusion from the epidemiological
studies on chlorpyrifos is that an association of prenatal
chlorpyrifos exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental
outcomes is likely, but that other neurotoxic agents can-
not be ruled out, and that animal studies show adverse
effects only at 1000-fold higher exposures [141]. A
recent decrease of the maximum residue limit for chlor-
pyrifos in several crops [142, 143] was based on animal
studies only [144], but the limits for the sister com-
pound, chlorpyrifos-methyl were unchanged. This case
highlights a major limitation to current approaches to
protecting the general population against a broad variety
of pesticides.
Production system and composition of plant foods
Fertilisation in organic agriculture is based on organic
fertilisers such as farmyard manure, compost and
green fertilisers, while some inorganic mineral fertili-
sers are used as supplements. Nitrogen (N) input is
limited to 170 kg/ha * year [5, 145]. In conventional
agriculture, fertilisation is dominated by mineral fertil-
iser, although farmyard manure is also common in
some countries. There is no general limit on N input.
Typically, crop yield is limited by plant N availability
in organic but not in conventional systems [146]
Phosphorus (P) input is on average similar or slightly
lower in organic systems [147].
In the absence of particular nutrient deficiency,
focusing on single nutrients may be of limited value for
evaluating the impact of a food or diet on human
health [49]; studies of actual health effects, as discussed
above, are generally more informative than studies of
single nutrients.
Overall crop composition
Metabolomics [148–152], proteomics [153, 154] and
transcriptomics [155, 156] studies in controlled field
trials provide evidence that the production system has
an overall influence on crop development, although
there is no direct relevance of these studies for human
health. Furthermore, the generally lower crop yield in
organic systems [146] as such indicates an effect of
management strategy on plant development.
Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses [25,
157–159] with different scopes, inclusion criteria and
statistical methods have summarised several hundred
original studies reporting some aspect of plant chemical
composition in relation to conventional and organic
production, in search of overall trends across crops,
varieties, soils, climates, production years etc. While the
overall conclusions of these systematic reviews look
contradictory at first sight, there is agreement between
them in most of the detailed findings:
Mie et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:111 
Page 8 of 22
 Nitrogen and phosphorus
Existing systematic reviews have consistently found
lower total nitrogen (7% [157], 10% [159]) and higher
phosphorus (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.82
[25], 8% [157]) in organic compared to conventional
crops. These findings lack direct relevance for human
health. However, considering the differences in fertilisa-
tion strategies discussed above, and the fundamental
importance of N, P [160–162], and the N:P ratio [163]
for plant development, this may lend some plausibility
to other observed effects of the production system on
crop composition.
Vitamins
Systematic reviews generally agree that the concentra-
tion of macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals in
crops is either not at all or only slightly affected by
the production system. For example, ascorbic acid
(vitamin C) has received most attention in this con-
text. Meta-analyses report only small effect sizes of
the organic production system on vitamin C content
[25, 158, 159].
Polyphenols
(Poly)phenolic compounds are not essential nutrients
for humans but may play a role in preventing several
non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular
disease, neurodegeneration and cancer [164]. The
detailed
mechanisms
are
complex
and
not
fully
understood [164]. Several environmental and agro-
nomic practices affect the phenolic composition of
the crop, including light, temperature, availability of
plant nutrients and water management [165]. Under
conditions of high nitrogen availability, many plant
tissues show a decreased content of phenolic com-
pounds, although there are examples of an opposite
relationship [165].
Meta-analyses report modest effect sizes of the pro-
duction system on total phenolics content, e.g. an in-
crease of 14 – 26% [25, 158, 159]. For some narrower
groups of phenolic compounds, larger relative con-
centration differences (in percent) between organic
and conventional crops have been reported [159].
However, such findings represent unweighted averages
typically from small and few studies, and are therefore
less reliable.
Collectively the published meta-analyses indicate a
modestly higher content of phenolic compounds in or-
ganic food, but the evidence available does not consti-
tute a sufficient basis for drawing conclusions on
positive effects of organic compared to conventional
plant products in regard to human health.
Cadmium and other toxic metals
Cadmium (Cd) is toxic to the kidneys, can demineralise
bones and is carcinogenic [166]. Cd is present naturally
in soils, and is also added to soils by P fertilisers and
atmospheric deposition. Several factors, including soil
structure and soil chemistry, humus content and pH,
affect the plant availability of Cd [167]. The application
of Cd-containing fertilisers increases Cd concentrations
in the crops [167, 168]. Low soil organic matter gener-
ally increases the availability of Cd for crops [169], and
organically managed farms tend to have higher soil
organic matter than conventionally managed farms [11].
The source of Cd in mineral fertilisers is the raw mater-
ial phosphate rock. The European average Cd content in
mineral fertilisers is reported as 68 mg Cd/kg P [170] or
83 mg Cd/kg P [171]. The content of Cd in farmyard
manure is variable but apparently in many cases lower:
Various types of animal manure in a German collection
averaged between 14 and 37 mg Cd/kg P [172].
Smith-Spangler et al. [25] found no significant differ-
ence in the Cd content of organic and conventional
crops (SMD = −0.14, 95% CI -0.74 – 0.46) in their meta-
analysis, while Barański et al. [159] report significantly
48% higher Cd concentration in conventional compared
to organic crops (SMD = -1.45, 95% CI -2.52 to −0.39)
in another meta-analysis largely based on the same
underlying original studies, albeit with different inclu-
sion criteria. We contacted the authors of these meta-
analyses in order to understand this discrepancy. An
updated version of the Barański meta-analysis, in which
some inconsistencies have been addressed and which
has been provided by the original authors [173], shows a
significant 30% (SMD = −0.56, 95% CI -1.08 to −0.04)
elevations of Cd contents in conventional compared to
organic crops; in subgroup analysis, this difference is
restricted to cereal crops. No updated meta-analysis was
available for Smith-Spangler’s analysis [25]; apparently,
two large well-designed studies with tendencies towards
a lower Cd content in organic crops were not considered
[174, 175] although they appear to fulfil the inclusion
criteria. Also, a correction for multiple testing has been
imposed, which may be overly conservative, given the
prior knowledge that mineral fertilisers constitute an
important source of Cd to soils and crops. It is unclear
how these points would affect the results of Smith-
Spangler’s meta-analysis.
There are short-term and long-term effects of Cd
influx from fertilisers on the Cd content of crops [167]
but no long-term study comparing Cd content in
organic and conventional crops is available. In absence
of such direct evidence, two long-term experiments indi-
cate a higher slope in Cd concentration over time for
minerally fertilised compared to organically fertilised
cereal crops [176, 177], after over 100 years of growing.
Mie et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:111 
Page 9 of 22
 A lower Cd content of organic crops is therefore
plausible due to a lower Cd content in the fertilisers
used in organic farming, and potentially due to higher
soil organic matter in organic farmland. The general
population’s Cd exposure is close to, and in some cases
above, the tolerable intake and therefore their exposure
to Cd should be reduced. For non-smokers, food is the
primary source of exposure, with cereals and vegetables
being the most important contributors [168].
For other toxic metals including lead, mercury and
arsenic, no differences in concentration in organic and
conventional crops have been reported [25, 159]. Uranium
(U) is also present as a contaminant of concern in mineral
P fertilisers [178], but less so in organic fertilisers [179],
and consequently manure-based cropping systems have a
lower U load than mineral-fertilised systems at equal P
load [179]. Uranium appears to accumulate in mineral-
fertilised soils [180], and agricultural activity may increase
the U content of surface and groundwater [181, 182].
However, no evidence was found comparing uranium con-
tents of organic and conventional products.
Fungal toxins
Regarding fungal toxins in crops, one meta-analysis has
reported a lower contamination of organic compared to
conventional cereal crops with deoxynivalenol (DON),
produced by certain fusarium species [25]. Although not
fully understood, fungicide applications may alter fungal
communities on cereal leaves, potentially weakening
disease-suppressive species [183, 184]. Also, crop rota-
tions including non-cereal crops may contribute to lower
infestation with fusarium [185], while N availability is
positively associated with cereal DON content [186].
These factors give plausibility to the observed lower
DON contamination in organic cereals. In the EU, the
mean chronic exposure of toddlers, infants and children
to DON is above the tolerable daily intake (TDI), with
grains and grain-based products being the main contrib-
utors to total exposure. The TDI is based on decreased
body weight gain observed in mice [187]. The produc-
tion system does not have any observed effect on the
concentration of ochratoxin A (OTA), another fungal
toxin of importance in cereal production [25].
Animal-based foods
By regulation, herbivores in organic production receive
at least 60% of their feed intake as roughage on a dry
matter basis. Depending on the seasonal availability of
pastures, roughage can be fresh, dried, or silage. Also
omnivores in organic production receive roughage as
part of their daily feed, and poultry has access to pasture
[6]. Corresponding regulations are for the most part
missing in conventional animal production. In conse-
quence, feeding strategies in organic animal production
include a higher fraction of roughage compared to con-
ventional systems, e.g. for dairy cows [188, 189].
Fatty acids
Much of the focus of existing research on compositional
differences of organic and conventional animal-based
foods is on the fatty acid composition, with a major
interest in omega-3 FAs due to their importance for
human health. Some studies also address the content of
minerals and vitamins.
The FA composition of the feed is a strong determin-
ant of the fatty acid composition of the milk, egg or
meat [190, 191]. Grass and red clover, typical roughage
feeds, contain between 30% and 50% omega-3 FA of
total FA, while the concentrate feeds cereals, soy, corn,
and palm kernel cake all contain below 10% omega-3 FA
of total FA [190]. Like humans, farm animals turn a
small part of dietary alpha-linolenic acid into long-chain
omega-3 fatty acids with the help of elongase and desa-
turase enzymes.
For cow’s milk, a recent meta-analysis reports conclu-
sively an approximately 50% higher content of total
omega-3 fatty acids (as percent of total fatty acids) in
organic compared to conventional milk [192], generally
confirming earlier reviews [25, 189]. Also, the content of
ruminant FAs (a group of natural trans FAs produced in
the cow’s rumen) is higher in organic milk. The content
of saturated fatty acids, mono-unsaturated fatty acids
and omega-6 PUFA was similar in organic and conven-
tional milk [192].
A considerable statistical heterogeneity in these find-
ings is reported. Individual differences described above
are based on results from between 11 and 19 included
studies. The observed differences are plausible, because
they
are
directly
linked
to
differences
in
feeding
regimens. It should also be noted that several other fac-
tors influence the fatty acid composition in milk [193].
Specifically, the season (indoor vs. outdoor) has an
impact on the feeding regime [188] and therefore on the
omega-3 content of milk. However, the content of
omega-3 fatty acids is higher in organic milk during both
the outdoor and indoor seasons [189].
For eggs, it is likewise well described that the FA com-
position of the feed [190] and consequently the access to
pasture [194, 195] such as in organic systems, is a strong
determinant of the fatty acid composition of the egg.
However, only few studies have compared the FA com-
position in organic and conventional eggs [196] and a
systematic review is not available. A higher omega-3
content of organic eggs is plausible but has not been
documented.
A total of 67 original studies report compositional
aspects of meat (mainly beef, chicken, lamb, and pork)
from organic and conventional husbandry and were
Mie et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:111 
Page 10 of 22
 recently summarised in a meta-analysis [197]. Based on
23 and 21 studies respectively, the content of total PUFA
and omega-3 PUFA was found to be significantly higher
(23 and 47%, respectively) in organic compared to con-
ventional meats. Weighted by average consumption in
Europe, choosing organic instead of conventional meat,
while maintaining a constant consumption, increased
the intake of PUFA and omega-3 FA from meat by 17
and 22%, respectively [198]. These findings are plausible,
especially in the case of omega-3 PUFA, considering the
known differences in feeding regimens in organic and
conventional production. However, few studies were
available for each analysis, leaving many analyses with
high uncertainty and poor statistical power. Further-
more, fatty acid metabolism differs between ruminants
and monogastric animals [190]. Also, the actual differ-
ences in feeding regimens between conventionally and
organically raised animals may differ by species, and by
country. The variation between studies and between
species was large, and the overall reliability of these
results is therefore lower compared to milk above.
This
meta-analysis
therefore
indicates
a
plausible
increase in omega-3 contents in organic meats, but
more well-designed studies are needed to confirm this
effect [197].
Dairy products account for 4–5% of the total PUFA
intake in most European populations, while meat and
meat products contribute another 7–23% [199]. The
contribution of milk fat to omega-3 PUFA intake
(approximated as intake of α-linolenic acid) has been
estimated at 5–16% [200, 201], while meat contributes
with 12–17% [201, 202]. The effect of exchanging
organic for conventional dairy products on omega-3
PUFA intake while maintaining a constant consumption
has not been examined rigorously. From the intake and
composition data presented here, it can be estimated
that choosing organic products would increase the aver-
age dietary omega-3 PUFA intake by 2.5–8% (dairy) and
by a less certain 2.5–4% (meat). A recent preliminary
estimate based on FAO food supply data resulted in
similar numbers [198]. For certain population groups
and fatty acids, these numbers could be higher, and an
increased
omega-3
PUFA consumption
is
generally
desirable, as some subpopulations have a lower-than-
recommended intake of omega-3 PUFA [203]. However,
overall, the effect of the animal production system on
omega-3 PUFA intake is minor, and no specific health
benefits can be derived. Furthermore, other dietary
omega-3 PUFA sources, specifically certain plant oils
and fish, are available that carry additional benefits
[204–206]. The existence of specific health benefits of
ruminant trans fatty acids (as opposed to industrial trans
fatty acids) is indicated by some studies [207] but not
strongly
supported
[208].
Taking
into
account
the
actually consumed amounts of ruminant trans fatty
acids, this is likely lacking public health relevance [208].
Trace elements and vitamins
A recent meta-analysis points to a significantly higher
content of iodine (74%) and selenium (21%) in conven-
tional milk and of iron (20%) and tocopherol (13%) in
organic milk based on six, four, eight and nine studies
respectively [192]. Iodine deficiency during pregnancy
and infancy leads to impairment of brain development
in the offspring, while excess iodine intake is associated
with similar effects, and the window of optimal iodine
intake is relatively narrow [209]. Overall, iodine intake in
Europe is low and mild deficiency is prevalent [210].
The preferred way of correcting deficiency is salt iodisa-
tion [210, 211], because salt is consumed almost univer-
sally and with little seasonal variation [212].
Feed iodine supplementation is not linked by regula-
tion to the production system in the EU, as iodine is
listed as approved feed additive, and the maximum
amount of supplementation is the same for all milk pro-
duction. Optimum dairy cow supplementation should be
seen in relation to other national strategies for human
iodine intake. This should also take into account human
subpopulations with low or no intake of dairy products.
For tocopherol, selenium and iron, a higher content is
generally desirable, and in the case of selenium milk is
an important source. However, the concentration differ-
ences between organic and conventional milk are mod-
est and based on a few studies only.
Antibiotic resistant bacteria
Overly prevalent prophylactic use of antibiotics in
animal production is an important factor contributing to
increasing human health problems due to resistant bacteria.
Antibiotic use is strongly restricted in organic husbandry,
which instead aims to provide good animal welfare and
enough space in order to promote good animal health.
Antibiotics constitute an integral part of intensive ani-
mal production today, and farm animals may act as im-
portant reservoirs of resistant genes in bacteria [213, 214].
It is reported that a substantial proportion (50 – 80%) of
antibiotics are used for livestock production worldwide
[215]. On a “per kg biomass” basis, in 2014, the amount of
antimicrobial drugs consumed by farm animals was
slightly higher than the antimicrobial drugs used for
humans in the 28 EU/EEA countries surveyed, with sub-
stantial differences between countries regarding volumes
and types of substances [216].
In recent decades, there have been increasing concerns
that the use of antibiotics in livestock would contribute
to impairing the efficiency of antibiotic treatment in
human medical care [217]. Despite the lack of detailed
information on transmission routes for the vast flora of
Mie et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:111 
Page 11 of 22
 antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, there is
a global need for action to reduce the emerging chal-
lenges associated with the reduced efficiency of antibi-
otics and its consequences for public health, as well as
for the environment more generally [218, 219].
The use of antibiotics may increase the economic out-
come of animal production [220, 221], but the spreading
of multi-resistant genes is not just a problem for the
animal production sector alone. Negative effects are
affecting parts of society not directly associated with
livestock production. This means that the costs of side
effects are borne by society in general and not primarily
by the agricultural sector. However, the generalisation
cannot be made that all antibiotic treatment in farm
animals represents a hazard to public health [222, 223].
The use of antibiotics in intensive livestock production
is closely linked to the housing and rearing conditions of
farm animals. Specific conditions for conventional live-
stock farming in different countries, as well as farmers’
attitudes, may differ between countries, e.g. conventional
pig production at above EU animal welfare standards
and farmers’ attitudes in Sweden [224, 225]. Conven-
tional production is typically aiming for high production
levels with restricted input resources such as space, feed
etc., and these conditions may cause stress in the indi-
vidual animal as it is unable to cope with the situation,
e.g. in pig production [226, 227]. This means that higher
stocking density, restricted space and barren environ-
ment are factors increasing the risk of the development
of diseases, and therefore it is more likely that animals
under these conditions need antibiotic treatments.
Organic production aims for less intensive animal pro-
duction, which generally means that the animals have
access to a more spacious and enriched environment,
access to an outdoor range and restricted group sizes,
and other preconditions [70]. This would ultimately de-
crease the need for preventive medication of the animals
as they can perform more natural behaviours and have
more opportunity to maintain a good health. However,
in practice, the health status of organic livestock is com-
plex and disease prevention needs to be adapted to the
individual farm [228]. A report on the consequences of
organic production in Denmark demonstrates that meet-
ing the requirements of organic production has several
positive consequences in relation to animal welfare and
health [70].
According to EU regulations, routine prophylactic
medication of animals in organic production is not
allowed. However, diseases should be treated immedi-
ately to avoid suffering, and the therapeutic use of anti-
biotics is allowed, but with longer withdrawal periods
than in conventional production [5]. Furthermore, prod-
ucts from animals treated more than three times during
12 months, or, if their productive lifecycle is less than
1 year, more than once, cannot be sold as organic [6].
This means that therapeutically the same antibiotics
used in conventional farming may be used in organic
farming, but under different conditions. For example,
antibiotics mainly used for sub-therapeutic treatment as
prophylaxis are never considered in organic production.
While the organic regulations aim for a low use of
antibiotics in livestock production, the actual use of anti-
biotic drugs in European organic compared to conven-
tional
animal
husbandry
is
not
comprehensively
documented. Scattered studies indicate that the anti-
biotic use generally is substantially higher in conven-
tional compared to organic systems, especially for pigs
(approximately 5 – 15-fold higher) [229, 230]. In studies
from Denmark [231] and the Netherlands [232], the
antibiotic use in dairy cows was 50% and 300% higher in
conventional compared to organic systems, although a
Swedish study found no differences in disease treatment
strategies between organic and conventional dairy farms,
e.g. for mastitis [233]. While only sparingly documented
(e.g. [234, 235]), there is only little use of antibiotics in
EU organic broiler production. This is a consequence of
regulations prohibiting prophylactic use and prescribing
long withdrawal periods before slaughter [6, 236], in
conjunction with the fact that it is not feasible to treat
single animals in broiler flocks. In conventional broiler
production, antibiotic use is common (e.g. [237–239]).
Recently, gene sequencing has revealed that the routes
of transmission of resistance genes between human and
farm animal reservoirs seem to be complex [213, 222,
240]. Nevertheless, a recent EFSA report found that “in
both humans and animals, positive associations between
consumption of antimicrobials and the corresponding
resistance in bacteria were observed for most of the
combinations
investigated”
[241],
which
has
subse-
quently been strengthened [216]. In addition to direct
transmission between animals and humans via contact
or via food, resistant strains and resistance genes may
also spread into the environment [242].
Previously, it has been postulated that a reduced need
and use of antibiotics in organic livestock production will
diminish the risk of development of antibiotic resistance
[243], and this has also been demonstrated with regard to
resistant E. coli in organic pigs compared to conven-
tional pigs [244]. It has also been shown that the
withdrawal of prophylactic use of antibiotics when
poultry farms are converted from conventional to
organic production standards leads to a decrease in
the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella [245].
Resistant bacteria may be transferred within the
production chain from farm to fork [246]. It has been
found that organic livestock products are less likely
to harbour resistant bacteria in pork and chicken
meat [25].

 In pig production, particular attention has been paid
to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
and in Dutch and German studies, for example, MRSA
has been isolated in 30 and 55% respectively of all pigs
tested [247, 248]. Furthermore, it has been found that
healthy French pig farmers are more likely to carry
MRSA than control persons [249] and that they carry
similar strains of MRSA to those found on their pig
farms [250]. However, the prevalence of MRSA in pig
production may differ between conventional and organic
farms, and in a meta-study in 400 German fattening pig
herds, the odds ratio (OR) for MRSA prevalence was
0.15 (95% CI 0.04, 0.55) in organic (n = 23) compared to
conventional (n = 373) pig farms [248]. Multivariate
adjustment for potential risk factors rendered this asso-
ciation non-significant, suggesting that it was carried by
other factors, including factors that are regulated in or
associated with organic production, such as non-slatted
floors, no use of antibiotics, and farrow-to-finish herd
types. Furthermore, even if there are considerable differ-
ences in antibiotic use between countries, it has been
found that antibiotic resistance is less common in
organic pigs compared to conventional pigs in France,
Italy, Denmark, and Sweden [251, 252].
Although it is rare for conventional farms to adopt
knowledge about management and housing from organic
production except when converting farms in line with
organic standards, there may be options to improve
animal health and welfare by knowledge transfer to
conventional farms in order to reduce the use of antibi-
otics [253].
Within organic production, labelling requires full
traceability in all steps in order to guarantee the origin
of the organic products being marketed [5]. Application
of the general principle of organic regulations about
transparency throughout the food chain can be used to
mitigate emerging problems of transmission of anti-
microbial resistance. However, transition to organic pro-
duction for the whole livestock sector would, on its own,
be only part of a solution to the antibiotics resistance
issue, because factors outside animal production, such as
their use in humans, will be unaffected.
Discussion
An assessment of the human health effects associated
with diets based on organic food production must rely
on two sets of evidence. The first set of evidence is the
epidemiological studies comparing population groups
with dietary habits that differ substantially in regard to
choices of organic v. conventional products. These stud-
ies are to some extent complemented by experimental
studies using animal models and in vitro models. The
second set of data relies on indirect evidence such as
chemical analyses of food products and their contents of
nutrients and contaminants or antibiotic use and resist-
ance patterns, in onsequence of agricultural production
methods. Both sets of results are associated with certain
strengths and weaknesses.
The few human studies that have directly investigated
the effects of organic food on human health have so far
yielded some observations, including indications of a
lower risk of childhood allergies, adult overweight/obes-
ity [18, 46] and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (but not for
total cancer) [37] in consumers of organic food. Owing
to the scarcity or lack of prospective studies and the lack
of mechanistic evidence, it is presently not possible to
determine whether organic food plays a causal role in
these observations. However, it has also been observed
that consumers who prefer organic food have healthier
dietary patterns overall, including a higher consumption
of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes and a
lower consumption of meat [18, 29, 37]. This leads to
some
methodological
difficulties
in
separating
the
potential effect of organic food preference from the po-
tential effect of other associated lifestyle factors, due to
residual
confounding
or
unmeasured
confounders.
These dietary patterns have in other contexts been
associated with a decreased risk of several chronic
diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease
[30–36]. It is therefore expected that consumers who
regularly eat organic food have a decreased risk of these
diseases compared to people consuming conventionally-
produced food, as a consequence of dietary patterns.
These dietary patterns appear also to be more environ-
mentally sustainable than average diets [254].
Food analyses tend to support the notion that organic
foods may have some health benefits. Consumers of
organic food have a comparatively low dietary exposure
to pesticides. Although chemical pesticides undergo a
comprehensive risk assessment before market release in
the EU, there are important gaps in this risk assessment.
In some cases, specifically for cognitive development
during childhood as an effect of organophosphate in-
secticide exposure during pregnancy, epidemiological
studies provide evidence of adverse effects [140, 255].
Organic agriculture allows for lower pesticide residues
in food and may be instrumental in conventional
agriculture’s transition towards integrated pest manage-
ment by providing a large-scale laboratory for non-
chemical plant protection.
This review emphasizes that pesticide exposure from
conventional food production constitutes a main health
concern. A key issue that has only recently been
explored in biomedical research is that early-life expos-
ure is of major concern, especially prenatal exposure
that may harm brain development. Most insecticides are
designed to be toxic to the insect nervous system, but
many higher species depend on similar neurochemical
Mie et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:111 
Page 13 of 22
 processes and may therefore all be vulnerable to these
substances
[129].
Besides
insecticides,
experimental
studies suggest a potential for adverse effects on the ner-
vous system for many herbicides and fungicides as well
[99]. However, no systematic testing is available since
testing for neurotoxicity – especially developmental
neurotoxicity – has not consistently been required as
part of the registration process, and allowable exposures
may therefore not protect against such effects. At least
100 different pesticides are known to cause adverse
neurological effects in adults [129], and all of these
substances must therefore be suspected of being capable
of damaging also developing brains. The need for
prevention of these adverse outcomes is illustrated by the
recent cost calculations [140] and the additional risk that
pesticide exposures may lead to important diseases, such as
Parkinson’s disease, diabetes and certain types of cancer.
The outcomes in children and adults and the dose-
dependences are still incompletely documented, but an
additional limitation is the lack of exposure assessments
in different populations and also their association with
dietary habits. The costs from pesticide use in regard to
human health and associated costs to society are likely
to be greatly underestimated due to hidden and external
costs, as recently reviewed [256]. Also, gaps in the regu-
latory approval process of pesticides may lead to import-
ant effects being disregarded and remaining undetected.
In regard to nutrients, organic dairy products, and
probably also meat, have an approximately 50% higher
content of omega-3 fatty acids compared to conven-
tional products. However, as these products only are a
minor source of omega-3 fatty acids in the average diet,
the nutritional significance of this effect is probably low
(although this has not been proven). The nutritional
content of crops is largely unaffected by the production
system, according to current knowledge. Vitamins and
minerals are found in similar concentrations in crops
from both systems. One exception is the increased con-
tent of phenolic compounds found in organic crops,
although this is still subject to uncertainty despite a large
number of studies that have addressed this issue.
Accordingly, although in general being favourable for
organic products, the established nutritional differences
between organic and conventional foods are small, and
strong conclusions for human health cannot currently be
drawn from these differences. There are indications that
organic crops contain less cadmium compared to conven-
tional crops. This is plausible, primarily because mineral
fertiliser is an important source of cadmium in soils. How-
ever, notably, long-term farm pairing studies or field trials
that are required for definitely establishing or disproving
this relationship are lacking. Owing to the high relevance
of cadmium in food for human health, this lack of
research constitutes an important knowledge gap.
With respect to the development of antibiotic resist-
ance in bacteria, organic animal production may offer a
way of restricting the risks posed by intensive produc-
tion, and even decreasing the prevalence of antibiotic
resistance. Organic farm animals are less likely to de-
velop certain diseases related to intensive production
compared to animals on conventional farms. As a conse-
quence, less antibiotics for treating clinical diseases are
required
under
organic
management,
where
their
prophylactic
use
also
is
strongly
restricted.
This
decreases the risk for development of antibiotic resist-
ance in bacteria. Furthermore, the transparency in
organic
production
may
be
useful
for
acquiring
knowledge and methods to combat the rising issues
around transmission of antimicrobial resistance within
food production.
It appears essential that use of antibiotics in animal
production decreases strongly or completely ceases in
order to decrease the risk of entering a post-antibiotic
era. The development and upscaling of rearing systems
free or low in antibiotic use, such as organic broiler pro-
duction, may be an important contribution of organic
agriculture to a future sustainable food system.
Most of the studies considered in this review have in-
vestigated the effects of agricultural production on prod-
uct composition or health. Far less attention has been
paid to the potential effects of food processing. Process-
ing may affect the composition of foods and the bioavail-
ability of food constituents. It is regulated [5] and
recognised [257] that food additives are restricted for or-
ganic products compared to conventional products. It is
also recognised that the degree of food processing may
be of relevance to human health [258, 259]. In organic
food processing, the processing should be done “with
care, preferably with the use of biological, mechanical
and physical methods” [5] but there are no specific
restrictions or guidelines. With the exception of chem-
ical additives, it is unknown whether certain food
processing methods (e.g. fermentation of vegetables,
pasteurisation of vegetables) are more prevalent in
organic
or
conventional
products
or
consumption
patterns, or whether such differences are of relevance to
human health.
The scopes of two recent reports, from Norway [260]
and Denmark [70], in part overlap with the present
work. Broadly, the reviewed results and conclusions pre-
sented in those reports are in line with this article. For
several topics, important new evidence has been pub-
lished in recent years. Consequently, in some cases
stronger conclusions can be drawn today. Furthermore,
the present review includes epidemiological studies of
pesticide effects in the evidence base reviewed.
Over all, the evidence available suggested some clear
and some potential advantages associated with organic
Mie et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:111 
Page 14 of 22
 foods. The advantages in general do not necessarily
require organic food production as strictly defined in
current legislation. Certain production methods, such as
changes in the use of pesticides and antibiotics, can be
implemented in conventional production, e.g. supporting
a development towards a sustainable use of pesticides
[261]. Thereby, practices and developments in organic
agriculture can have substantial public health benefits
also outside the organic sector.
Diet choices and the associated food production
methods also have important impacts on environmental
sustainability [254]. Consumption patterns of consumers
preferring organic food [16, 18, 19, 37, 47] seem to align
well with sustainable diets [2]. These consumption
patterns also show some similarities with the Mediterra-
nean Diet [262–265] and with the New Nordic Diet
[266–269], with lower dietary footprints in regard to
land use, energy and water consumption, and green-
house gas emissions compared to concurrent average
diets. Further evaluation is needed to assess the extent
to which organic food systems can serve as example of a
sustainable food systems [270].
For the development of healthy and environmentally-
sustainable food systems in the future, production and
consumption need to be considered in an integrated
manner [2, 271]. While an evaluation of overall impacts
of different food systems on environmental sustainability
would be highly desirable [270], the present review has
attempted to assess the human health issues in regard to
organic production methods and consumer preferences
for organic food, both important aspects of sustainability.
Conclusions
Suggestive
evidence
indicates
that
organic
food
consumption may reduce the risk of allergic disease and
of overweight and obesity, but residual confounding is
likely, as consumers of organic food tend to have health-
ier lifestyles overall. Animal experiments suggest that
growth and development is affected by the feed type
when comparing identically composed feed from organic
or conventional production. In organic agriculture, the
use of pesticides is restricted, and residues in conven-
tional fruits and vegetables constitute the main source of
human exposures. Epidemiological studies have reported
adverse effects of certain pesticides on children’s cogni-
tive development at current levels of exposure, but these
data have so far not been applied in the formal risk
assessments of individual pesticides. The nutrient com-
position differs only minimally between organic and
conventional crops, with modestly higher contents of
phenolic compounds in organic fruit and vegetables.
There is likely also a lower cadmium content in organic
cereal crops. Organic dairy products, and perhaps also
meats, have a higher content of omega-3 fatty acids
compared to conventional products, although this differ-
ence is of likely of marginal nutritional significance. Of
greater concern is the prevalent use of antibiotics in
conventional animal production as a key driver of
antibiotic resistance in society; antibiotic use is less
intensive in organic production. Thus, organic food pro-
duction has several documented and potential benefits
for human
health, and
wider application of these
production methods also in conventional agriculture,
e.g., in integrated pest management, would therefore
most likely benefit human health.
