Background
Childhood vaccination is an effective way to prevent serious childhood illnesses, but many children do not receive all the recommended
vaccines. There are various reasons for this; some parents lack access because of poor quality health services, long distances or lack of
money. Other parents may not trust vaccines or the healthcare workers who provide them, or they may not see the need for vaccination
due to a lack of information or misinformation about how vaccinations work and the diseases they can prevent.
Communication with parents about childhood vaccinations is one way of addressing these issues. Communication can take place at
healthcare facilities, at home or in the community. Communication can be two-way, for example face-to-face discussions between
parents and healthcare providers, or one-way, for instance via text messages, posters or radio programmes. Some types of communication
enable parents to actively discuss vaccines and their benefits and harms, as well as diseases they can prevent. Other communication types
simply give information about vaccination issues or when and where vaccines are available. People involved in vaccine programmes
need to understand how parents experience different types of communication about vaccination and how this influences their decision
to vaccinate.
Objectives
The specific objectives of the review were to identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring: parents’ and informal
caregivers’ views and experiences regarding communication about childhood vaccinations and the manner in which it is communicated;
and the influence that vaccination communication has on parents’ and informal caregivers’ decisions regarding childhood vaccination.
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In-process and Other Non-Index Citations (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL
(EbscoHOST), and Anthropology Plus (EbscoHost) databases for eligible studies from inception to 30 August 2016. We developed

 search strategies for each database, using guidelines developed by the Cochrane Qualitative Research Methods Group for searching for
qualitative evidence as well as modified versions of the search developed for three related reviews of effectiveness. There were no date
or geographic restrictions for the search.
Selection criteria
We included studies that utilised qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on the views and experiences of parents
and informal caregivers regarding information about vaccination for children aged up to six years; and were from any setting globally
where information about childhood vaccinations was communicated or distributed.
Data collection and analysis
We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, using a three-step sampling frame. We conducted a thematic
analysis using a constant comparison strategy for data extraction and synthesis. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the
GRADE-CERQual approach. High confidence suggests that it is highly likely that the review finding is a reasonable representation
of the phenomenon of interest, while very low confidence indicates that it is not clear whether the review finding is a reasonable
representation of it. Using a matrix model, we then integrated our findings with those from other Cochrane reviews that assessed the
effects of different communication strategies on parents’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviour about childhood vaccination.
Main results
We included 38 studies, mostly from high-income countries, many of which explored mothers’ perceptions of vaccine communication.
Some focused on the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.
In general, parents wanted more information than they were getting (high confidence in the evidence). Lack of information led to
worry and regret about vaccination decisions among some parents (moderate confidence).
Parents wanted balanced information about vaccination benefits and harms (high confidence), presented clearly and simply (moderate
confidence) and tailored to their situation (low confidence in the evidence). Parents wanted vaccination information to be available at
a wider variety of locations, including outside health services (low confidence) and in good time before each vaccination appointment
(moderate confidence).
Parents viewed health workers as an important source of information and had specific expectations of their interactions with them
(high confidence). Poor communication and negative relationships with health workers sometimes impacted on vaccination decisions
(moderate confidence).
Parents generally found it difficult to know which vaccination information source to trust and challenging to find information they
felt was unbiased and balanced (high confidence).
The amount of information parents wanted and the sources they felt could be trusted appeared to be linked to acceptance of vaccination,
with parents who were more hesitant wanting more information (low to moderate confidence).
Our synthesis and comparison of the qualitative evidence shows that most of the trial interventions addressed at least one or two key
aspects of communication, including the provision of information prior to the vaccination appointment and tailoring information
to parents’ needs. None of the interventions appeared to respond to negative media stories or address parental perceptions of health
worker motives.
Authors’ conclusions
We have high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to several review findings. Further research, especially in rural and
low- to middle-income country settings, could strengthen evidence for the findings where we had low or very low confidence. Planners
should consider the timing for making vaccination information available to parents, the settings where information is available, the
provision of impartial and clear information tailored to parental needs, and parents’ perceptions of health workers and the information
provided.

qualitative evidence (Review)

Cochrane Collaboration.
 The aim of this Cochrane review was to explore how parents experience communication about vaccination for children under six years
of age. We searched for and analysed qualitative studies that could answer this question.
Qualitative research explores how people perceive and experience the world around them. This review of qualitative research supplements
other Cochrane reviews that assess the effect of different communication strategies on parents’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviour
about childhood vaccination.
Key messages
We are quite confident in the evidence we found that parents want clear, timely and balanced information, but that they often find this
information to be lacking. The amount of information parents want and the sources they trust appear to be linked to their acceptance
of vaccination; however, our confidence in this last finding is only low to moderate.
What did we study in the review?
Childhood vaccination is an effective way of preventing serious childhood illnesses. However, many children do not receive all of the
recommended immunisations. There may be different reasons for this. Some parents do not have access to the vaccine, for instance
because of poor quality health services, distance from their home to a health facility or lack of money. Some parents do not trust the
vaccine itself or the healthcare worker who provides it, while others do not see the need to vaccinate their children at all. Parents may
not know how vaccinations work or about the diseases that they prevent. They may also have received information that is misleading
or incorrect.
To address some of these issues, governments and health agencies often try to communicate with parents about childhood vaccinations.
This communication can take place at healthcare facilities, at home or in the community. Communication can be two-way, for instance
face-to-face discussions between parents and healthcare providers. It can also involve one-way communication, for instance information
provided through text messaging, posters, leaflets, or radio or television programmes. Some types of communication allow parents
to actively discuss the vaccine, its benefits and harms, and the disease it aims to prevent. Other types of communication simply
give information about these issues or about when and where vaccines are available. People involved in vaccine programmes need
to understand how parents experience different types of communication about vaccination and how this influences their decision to
vaccinate their child.
What are the main findings of the review?
We included 38 studies in our review. Most of the studies were from high-income countries and explored mothers’ perceptions of
vaccine communication. Some of the studies also included the views of fathers, grandmothers and other caregivers.
In general, parents wanted more information than they were getting (high confidence). For some parents, a lack of information led to
worry and regret about their vaccination decision (moderate confidence).
Parents wanted balanced information about both the benefits and risks of vaccination (high confidence), presented in a clear and simple
manner (moderate confidence) and tailored to their situation (low confidence). Parents wanted vaccination information to be available
outside of the health services (low confidence). They wanted this information in good time before each vaccination appointment and
not while their child was being vaccinated (moderate confidence).
Parents viewed health workers as an important source of information and had specific expectations of their interactions with them
(high confidence). Poor communication and negative relationships with health workers sometimes impacted on vaccination decisions
(moderate confidence).
Parents generally found it difficult to know which vaccination information source to trust and found it difficult to find information
that they felt was unbiased and balanced (high confidence).
The amount of information parents wanted and the sources they felt they could trust seem to be linked to their acceptance of vaccination,
with parents who were more hesitant wanting more information (low to moderate confidence).
How up-to-date is this review?
We searched for studies published before 30 August 2016.

 B A C K G R O U N D
Vaccination has been described as one of the greatest public health
achievements of the twentieth century (CDC 1999), and it is
widely seen as a worthwhile and cost-effective public health mea-
sure. However, over 22 million infants, mainly in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), did not receive the full series of ba-
sic immunisations in 2012 (WHO 2013b), contributing to many
preventable child deaths (GAVI 2010). Efforts to improve vac-
cination coverage were central to meeting the Millennium De-
velopment Goal (MDG) of reducing child mortality (UN 2011)
and are likely to be central to the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) (United Nations 2015). Vaccine hesitancy is considered
one of the reasons for suboptimal vaccination uptake.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines vaccine hesi-
tancy as “a behaviour, influenced by a number of factors including
issues of confidence (do not trust vaccine or provider), compla-
cency (do not perceive a need for or do not value the vaccine), and
convenience (access). Vaccine-hesitant individuals are a heteroge-
neous group who hold varying degrees of indecision about specific
vaccines or vaccination in general” (WHO 2013a). Factors that
may determine an individual’s vaccine hesitancy are seen to fall
into three domains: contextual influences, including sociocultural
and health systems factors; individual and group influences, in-
cluding those arising from personal perceptions of a vaccine; and
vaccine- or vaccination-specific issues, including individual assess-
ments of risks and benefits and the effects of the mode of admin-
istration (WHO 2013a). Communication interventions can ad-
dress several of these factors, including individuals’ perceptions of
the vaccine provider and of the risks and benefits of the vaccine.
Understanding how these factors unfold in different settings can
help us determine which interventions may be most appropriate
and can shed light on different levels of effectiveness.
Communication interventions can be used to address aspects or
factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy. A range of studies and
reviews has explored the reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the
non-vaccination of children (Dubé 2013; Larson 2014) (Table 1).
Overall, the reviews reveal that vaccination decision-making is a
complexprocess,influencedbymanyfactors. Animportantbarrier
for individuals in many settings is a lack of appropriate informa-
tion, leading to doubts about the trade-offs between the benefits
and risks of vaccination and to fears about side effects or other im-
plications (Taylor 2002; Mills 2005; Casiday 2006; Hadjikoumi
2006; Pearce 2008). People may lack knowledge about how vac-
cinations ’work’ and about the diseases they prevent (Woo 2004;
Mills 2005; Casiday 2006). People may also receive information
that is misleading.
Description of the condition
Communication interventions are often cited as being central to
improving vaccination uptake, which is needed to achieve the tar-
gets set by the international community. Of course, communica-
tion is one of many interacting factors that influence parents’ and
informal caregivers’ decisions to take their children for vaccina-
tion, and communication alone cannot address all aspects of vac-
cine hesitancy or refusal. However, communication interventions
are an important component of vaccination and public health
programmes, and inadequate communication can have a nega-
tive impact on vaccination uptake, completion and parental trust
in a vaccination (WHO 2014). In most settings, communication
about childhood vaccination is common, but there is uncertainty
around how people perceive and understand this communication,
and whether and how this influences their decision to vaccinate. In
addition, the effectiveness of many communication interventions
is still uncertain (Kaufman 2013; Saeterdal 2014).
Thisreviewispartof alargerprojectentitledCommunicate toVac-
cinate (COMMVAC) (Lewin 2011), exploring communication
regarding childhood vaccination (www.commvac.com). Project
staff have previously published three Cochrane reviews on the ef-
fects of different communication approaches for childhood vacci-
nation and of strategies to improve vaccination coverage in LMICs
(Kaufman 2013; Saeterdal 2014; Oyo-Ita 2016). Kaufman 2013
assessed the effect of face-to-face strategies to inform or educate
about childhood vaccination, finding low or very low certainty
evidence that face-to-face strategies may not have an effect on im-
munisation rates or parent knowledge and understanding of vac-
cination. Saeterdal 2014 examined community interventions to
promote childhood vaccination and found that these interventions
may improve attitudes and probably increase vaccination uptake
under some circumstances. Oyo-Ita 2016 looked at interventions
to improve the coverage of child immunisation in LMICs and
found that home visits and health education may improve immu-
nisation coverage.
This qualitative evidence synthesis aims to supplement these three
intervention reviews by exploring how parents experience com-
munication interventions for childhood vaccination and identify-
ing factors that may influence the effectiveness of these types of
interventions.
Description of the phenomenon of interest
Communication interventions are seldom clearly defined in the
health promotion arena. In this review we have defined communi-
cation as “a purposeful, structured, repeatable and adaptable strat-
egy to inform and influence individual and community decisions
in relation to personal and public health participation, disease pre-
vention and promotion, policy making, service improvement and
research” (Hill 2011; Lewin 2011). Communication can be one-
way (e.g. through information provision on a radio spot), two-way
(e.g. face-to-face interactions at a vaccination session) or multidi-
rectional (e.g. discussing vaccination in a group setting).

 In this review we will look at: parents’ and informal caregivers’
viewsandexperiencesof communicationaboutroutine earlychild-
hood vaccinations given to children under six years of age; the
content of the communication; and its influence on parents’ views
and decision to vaccinate.
Why it is important to do this review
Currently, there is a large focus on vaccination globally. Part of
this focus is a consequence of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), which included vaccination as a key outcome. Increas-
ingly substantial resources have been used for vaccination commu-
nication to try to reach key targets. The availability of new vaccines
has also led to an increased focus on vaccination communication.
Other concerns that have heightened interest in vaccination com-
munication include under-vaccination leading to outbreaks; set-
tings with low rates of vaccination, such as conflict zones, where
there have been outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases; more
vaccines becoming available; and more diseases becoming the fo-
cus of eradication campaigns.
In most settings, parents and informal caregivers now have access
to a broad and growing spectrum of information sources of vary-
ing quality. At the same time, in other some settings, an abso-
lute lack of information and communication can be a significant
barrier to addressing vaccine hesitancy and improving vaccination
uptake and coverage. To support decision makers within vacci-
nation programmes, it is important to understand how parents
and informal caregivers perceive and experience communication/
information about vaccination and if the information or mode of
communication influences their intention to vaccinate. It is also
important to consider how people’s beliefs and values mediate their
processing of information and their trust in the source of the in-
formation. All of these factors can influence the understanding of
information received and inform the decisions that people make.
To date, there have been few attempts to synthesise available qual-
itative data on what parents think about information they receive
about childhood vaccination, how this information is communi-
cated and how this may influence their intention to vaccinate their
child. Although a large number of reviews have been published
on vaccination communication, hesitancy or uptake (see Table 1
for a summary of these reviews) none of these address this issue
directly, and most focus on intervention effectiveness and/or focus
on quantitative study designs.
The beneficiaries of the findings of this review will be policy-mak-
ers, programme planners and health workers involved in child-
hood vaccination programmes. In order to structure and imple-
ment communication interventions appropriately, it is important
for these stakeholders to have understand parents’ and informal
caregivers’ views and experiences about routine early childhood
vaccination communication and information, and the extent to
which this communication influences their decision to vaccinate.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
This is a systematic review of qualitative primary studies. Qualita-
tive research aims to explore how people perceive and experience
the world around them. Researchers typically rely on interviews,
documents or observation to explore people’s perspectives in con-
nection with their health and use of healthcare services. They then
explore the data by means of qualitative analytical methods and
present their findings narratively rather than through numbers
(Glenton 2014).
We included all studies that used qualitative methods for data
collection, (e.g. focus group interviews, individual interviews, ob-
servation, document analysis) and that utilised qualitative meth-
ods for data analysis (e.g. thematic analysis, framework analysis,
grounded theory). We excluded studies that collected data using
qualitative methods but did not perform a qualitative analysis (e.g.
open-ended survey questions where the responses are analysed
using descriptive statistics). We included mixed-methods studies
where it was possible to extract findings derived from qualitative
research.
Types of participants
We included studies that focused on the views and experiences
of parents and informal caregivers regarding communication of
information about vaccination for children under six years of age.
We defined an informal caregiver as anyone directly involved in
caring for the child, making the decision to vaccinate or having
the responsibility to take the child to immunisation services. The
review focuses on children under six years of age because by this
time children in most settings are supposed to have completed the
routine vaccination calendar for childhood immunisation.
We included studies from anywhere in the world that provided in-
formation about childhood vaccinations in any setting, including
health facilities, the media and Internet, communities and homes.

qualitative evidence (Review)

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Types of phenomena of interest
The phenomena of interest are parents and informal caregivers’
views and experiences of routine early childhood vaccination com-
munication and the influence of this communication on their de-
cision or intention to vaccinate.
We included studies that explored parents’ and informal caregivers’
views and experiences on all forms of communication about child-
hood vaccination. For the purposes of this review, we defined a
communication intervention as “a purposeful, structured, repeat-
able and adaptable strategy to inform and influence individual and
community decisions in relation to personal and public health par-
ticipation, disease prevention and promotion, policy making, ser-
vice improvement and research” (Hill 2011; Lewin 2011). Com-
munication could be one-way (e.g. through information provision
on a radio spot), two-way (e.g. face-to-face interactions at a vacci-
nation session) or multidirectional (e.g. discussing vaccination in
a group setting). A communication strategy could include more
than one intervention and have multiple purposes for communi-
cating about vaccination.
These included:
• communication about any vaccines routinely given to
children aged under six years, delivered through any mechanism
(i.e. injectable, drops and nasal sprays);
• communication about vaccines delivered in both the private
sector and through public health services; and
• communication about vaccines that are delivered in routine
or repeated mass campaign interventions for children under six
years of age, as part of the WHO Extended Programme of
Immunization (EPI) in a particular setting.
We includedthe followingvaccines, orcombinationsof vaccines,in
the search.
• Bacille Calmette Guerin vaccine (BCG).
• Hepatitis B vaccine (Hep B).
• Polio vaccines:
◦ Oral polio virus vaccine (OPV);
◦ Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).
• Diptheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (tDap).
• Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine (HiB).
• Pneumococcal vaccine.
• Rotavirus vaccines:
◦ Rotarix;
◦ Rota Tex.
• Measles vaccine.
• Mumps vaccine.
• Rubella vaccine.
• Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR).
• Pentavalent vaccine (also known as the 5-in1 this vaccine
includes protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,
hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B)
• Japanese Encephalitis vaccine.
• Yellow Fever vaccine.
• Tick-borne Encephalitis vaccine.
• Typhoid vaccine.
• Cholera vaccine.
• Meningococcal vaccine.
• Hepatitis A vaccine (Hep A).
• Seasonal influenza vaccine.
We did not include the following vaccines because children do
not routinely receive them as part of the extended programme for
immunisation.
• Human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) (not given to
children under the age of six years).
• Rabies (as it is generally given in response to a bite).
• Haemagglutinin type 1 and Neuraminidase type 1 (H1N1),
and other epidemic vaccinations.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following electronic databases for eligible studies
from database inception to 30 August 2016.
• MEDLINE (OvidSP).
• MEDLINE In-process and Other Non-Index Citations
(Ovid SP).
• Embase (Ovid).
• CINAHL (EbscoHOST).
• Anthropology Plus (EbscoHost).
Using guidelines developed by the Cochrane Qualitative Research
Methods Group for searching for qualitative evidence (Noyes
2011), as well as modified versions of the search developed for
the three COMMVAC intervention reviews (Kaufman 2013;
Saeterdal 2014; Oyo-Ita 2016), we developed search strategies for
each database. We chose these databases as we anticipated that they
would provide the highest yield of results based on preliminary,
exploratory searches. There was no date or geographic restrictions
for the search.
Searching other resources
We searched the reference lists of all the included studies and key
references (i.e. relevant systematic reviews). We searched for any
studies using qualitative methods and analysis linked to the three
COMMVAC intervention reviews.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
We collated records identified from different sources into one
database and removed duplicates. Two review authors then inde-
pendently assessed titles and abstracts of the identified records to

Cochrane Collaboration.
 identify their potential eligibility. At this stage, we discarded ab-
stracts that were clearly irrelevant to the topic of this review.
Due to the challenges and resources associated with translating
papers reporting qualitative research, we only selected articles if
they were published in languages spoken by at least two members
of the review team (i.e. French, English and the Scandinavian
languages).
We retrieved the full text of all the papers that were likely to be
relevant. Two review authors independently assessed the articles
based on the review’s inclusion criteria. At all stages, two authors
(HA plus CG for the English, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian
articles; and HA plus YC for the French articles) reviewed the arti-
cles. We resolved disagreements through discussion or, if required,
by seeking a third review author’s (SL) view. Where appropriate,
we contacted the study authors for further information.
Purposive sampling of included studies
Large numbers of studies can threaten the quality of the analysis in
qualitative evidence syntheses. In addition, syntheses of qualitative
studies aim for greater variation in concepts as opposed to an
exhaustive sample that avoids risk of bias. Therefore, since seventy-
nine studies were eligible for inclusion, we decided to sample from
the eligible studies.
As in primary qualitative research (Silverman 2013), we utilised
purposive sampling to select from the eligible studies. We used a
type of purposive sampling approach called maximum variation
sampling with the aim of achieving the broadest possible variation
within the included studies (Suri 2011). We decided on three
key sampling criteria that would enable us to capture rich data
from all settings that would best answer our review objectives.
These became our three-step sampling frame. First, we sampled all
studies from low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings,
as most studies took place in high-income country (HIC) settings.
Second, we created a simple 1 to 5 scale for assessing the richness of
data, with 1 corresponding to very few or thin qualitative data (for
example, from an open-ended survey question); 3 being an average
qualitative article in a peer-reviewed health services journal; and
5 being very rich data (for example, from an ethnographic study).
We sampled all articles that scored a 3 or higher for data richness.
Finally, we examined the remaining studies after applying the first
two elements and sampled studies that most closely matched our
review objectives. After applying our sampling frame, we selected
38 studies for data extraction. The findings from these studies are
the basis for the review findings reported here. For a list of included
but not sampled studies see Table 2.
Data extraction and management
We performed data extraction using a specifically designed form
that we used to extract key themes and categories relevant to the re-
view objectives; these were derived during the initial phase of data
extraction. Categories included: the content of information on the
communication interventions; parents’ and informal caregivers’
views and experiences of the communication; and the extent and
manner of its influence on their decisions regarding vaccination.
We also used the form to extract information about first author,
date of publication, language, income setting of study (LMIC ver-
sus HIC), context (urban, rural), participant group (first-time par-
ents, older parents, informal caregivers etc.), the vaccine(s) stud-
ied, any theoretical or conceptual frameworks used, and the re-
search methods of the study.
Appraisal of the methodological limitations of
included studies
Our inclusion criteria specified that studies had to have used qual-
itative methods for both data collection and data analysis. This
criterion constitutes a basic quality threshold. We discarded stud-
ies that did not meet this standard. To assess the methodological
limitations (or quality) of included studies, we used an adaptation
of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) assessment tool
for qualitative studies (Atkins 2008). Other reviews of qualitative
evidence have also used this tool (Carlsen 2007; Munro 2007;
Glenton 2013). The adapted tool includes the following eight
questions.
1. Are the setting(s) and context described adequately?
2. Is the sampling strategy described, and is this appropriate?
3. Is the data collection strategy described and justified?
4. Is the data analysis described, and is this appropriate?
5. Are the claims made/findings supported by sufficient
evidence?
6. Is there evidence of reflexivity?
7. Does the study demonstrate sensitivity to ethical concerns?
8. Any other concerns?
We conducted a pilot trial on three included studies to assess the
feasibility of using this tool and to ensure the integrity of the assess-
ment. We accept that there is no gold standard approach for assess-
ing the methodological limitations of primary qualitative studies,
but believe that this adapted CASP checklist offers a reasonable
framework by which to assess such limitations.
One author (HA) applied the appraisal framework to each study.
A second author (CG) checked for discrepancies. Disagreements
were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third author
(SL).
We did not use the assessments of methodological limitations to
exclude studies but to judge the relative contribution of each study
to the development of explanations and relationships and as part
of the assessment of how much confidence we have in each finding
(see below).
Assessment of confidence in the review findings
We utilised the GRADE-Confidence in the Evidence from Re-
views of Qualitative research (GRADE-CERQual) approach to
summarise our confidence in the review findings (Lewin 2015;
7
Parents’ and informal caregivers’ views and experiences of communication about routine childhood vaccination: a synthesis of
qualitative evidence (Review)

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Lewin 2016). CERQual assesses confidence in the evidence based
on the following four key components.
• Methodological limitations of included studies: the extent
to which there are concerns about the design or conduct of the
primary studies that contributed evidence to an individual
review finding.
• Coherence of the review finding: an assessment of how clear
and cogent (i.e. well supported or compelling) the fit is between
the data from the primary studies and a review finding that
synthesises those data.
• Adequacy of the data contributing to a review finding: an
overall determination of the degree of richness and quantity of
data supporting a review finding.
• Relevance of the included studies to the review question:
the extent to which the body of evidence from the primary
studies supporting a review finding is applicable to the context
(perspective or population, phenomenon of interest, setting)
specified in the review question.
After assessing each of the four components, we (HA, CG and SL)
judged the overall confidence in each review finding to be high,
moderate, low or very low (Lewin 2016).
• High confidence: it is highly likely that the review finding is
a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest.
• Moderate confidence: it is likely that the review finding is a
reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest.
• Low confidence: it is possible that the review finding is a
reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest.
• Very low confidence: it is not clear whether the review
finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of
interest.
We based our judgements on an initial assumption that all find-
ings were ’high confidence’ and then downgraded them if there
were important rather than minor concerns regarding any of the
CERQual components. The starting point of ’high confidence’
reflects a view that each review finding should be seen as a reason-
able representation of the phenomenon of interest unless there are
factors that would weaken this assumption.
As a final step, we prepared an evidence profile for each finding as
well as ’Summary of qualitative findings’ tables. This is similar to
the ’Summary of findings’ tables used in Cochrane intervention
reviews and summarises the key findings, our confidence in the
evidence for each finding, and an explanation of the assessment of
confidence.
Data synthesis
We conducted a thematic analysis using a constant comparison
strategy for data extraction and synthesis (Miles 2014). The con-
stant comparison strategy was originally developed for the analysis
of primary data (Glaser 1965; Boeije 2002), but it has been used
more recently as a method for constructing the data extraction
forms and guiding analysis during qualitative evidence syntheses
(Booth 2012).
We applied a five-step process for data extraction and synthesis.
Firstly, one author (HA) chose the article judged to most closely
answer the review objectives. Secondly, we coded this article using
a thematic analysis approach. Thirdly, we created a data extraction
sheet based on the codes that emerged from step two. Fourthly, we
coded the next article using the data extraction sheet. If necessary,
we made additions to the data extraction sheet if new themes
emerged from the subsequent articles. Finally, we continued this
process until we had extracted data from all of the sampled articles.
Two other authors verified data extraction and added any other
data that they felt should have been included.
We synthesised the data from the themes identified during the
constant comparison thematic data extraction and identified the
review findings. Afterward, we re-read the included studies to dou-
ble check that we had extracted all data relevant to the findings.
Once data coding and analysis were complete, we looked for dif-
ferences in views and perceptions within and across settings (in-
cluding low-, middle- and high-income countries as well as rural
and urban areas), groups (for instance minority groups; first-time
parents; older and younger parents; informal caregivers) and dif-
ferent vaccines. We also attempted to explore whether the setting
or source of communication had an impact on people’s percep-
tions of that communication and its influence on their decision
regarding vaccination.
Using the synthesised qualitative findings to supplement the
Cochrane intervention reviews
As part of data synthesis, we explored how we could integrate the
findings from our review with those of related Cochrane inter-
vention reviews (Kaufman 2013; Saeterdal 2014; Oyo-Ita 2016).
Currently, these three effectiveness reviews are characterised by
few studies and mostly low certainty evidence. We did not con-
sider the findings from a Cochrane effectiveness review on “Pa-
tient reminder and recall systems to improve immunisation rates”
(Jacobson-Vann 2005), as these findings are out-of-date, and the
review is currently being updated.
Using qualitative evidence synthesis findings to supplement in-
tervention reviews is a relatively new approach, and there are no
agreed methods on how to conduct this analysis. We decided to
use a matrix model approach similar to one used by Candy 2011.
Two authors (HA, CG) used this approach to create a comparative
table. This explored whether the interventions studied in the re-
lated Cochrane reviews contained the features of vaccination com-
munication that parents and caregivers identified as important in
this synthesis (Kaufman 2013; Saeterdal 2014; Oyo-Ita 2016).
To create the matrix we undertook the following steps: first, we
went through each of the synthesis findings and identified features
of communication interventions that parents and informal care-
givers perceived as positive or facilitators, including features tied to
information timing, availability, amount, source and content. We
8

 organised these features into simple groups and then created eight
questions reflecting the key issues highlighted. These questions,
which can be answered as yes, no or unclear, allowed us to assess
the alignment between the qualitative issues we identified and the
interventions assessed in the effectiveness reviews.
1. Has information been communicated to parents before the
vaccination appointment?
2. Has the information been provided in more than one
setting, including settings outside of the health centre? Has an
opportunity for discussion about the vaccination information
been offered?
3. Has an attempt been made to tailor the information to a
particular audience?
4. Has an attempt been made to ensure that health workers are
helpful, caring and willing to have open, non-judgemental
discussions with parents about their questions and concerns
regarding vaccination?
5. Are health workers perceived by parents, informal caregivers
and other stakeholders as being driven primarily by the best
interests of the child or are they perceived as being driven by
other motives, such as financial gain?
6. Has an attempt been made to provide parents with
information they perceive as impartial, balanced and unbiased?
7. Has an attempt been made to communicate vaccination
information in a clear and simple way and present it in a variety
of formats?
8. Did the information provided try to address ongoing media
stories or rumours about vaccination so as to address parents’
current questions and concerns?
Secondly, we created a table, listing these eight questions. We then
assessed whether the interventions included in the Cochrane ef-
fectiveness reviews reflected these features. As the scope of Oyo-Ita
2016 was broader than communication, we only assessed trials
from that review which focused on communication interventions.
We assessed whether there was a full or partial match between each
of the eight questions and the intervention components from each
trial. We then added these assessments to the table. We used a tick
to indicate a ’yes’; an em dash (-), a ’no’; and a question mark, an
’unclear’. None of the trials presented information regarding ques-
tions 5 and 8. We assume that the interventions did not address
these questions but cannot be sure due to the limited amount of
information available in the trial reports.
Researcher reflexivity
Throughout the data synthesis, the authors were aware of their
own positions and reflected on how these could influence the data
synthesis and study design. With an aim of identifying assump-
tions in the data synthesis, we also presented the preliminary find-
ings to the larger COMMVAC project team for feedback.

 Included studies
Study respondents
In all of the studies, authors sought the perspectives of parents
themselves. Although some studies also included informal care-
givers such as grandmothers, it was not possible to distinguish be-
tween these points of view during analysis. Most of the respon-
dents were mothers with only a few studies also exploring the
perspectives of fathers. In addition, some studies elicited health
worker perceptions, but we did not extract or include these data
in our analysis.
Setting
Nine full-textarticlesreportedresearch inlow-andmiddle-income
countries (LMICs): Ethiopia (N = 2), Uganda (N = 1), India (N
= 1), Brazil (N = 2), Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (N = 1), Iran (N
= 1), and Turkey (N = 1); 29 took place in high income countries
(HICs): the UK (N = 10), Norway (N = 1), the USA (N = 10),
Australia (N = 2), the Netherlands (N = 2), Switzerland (N = 1)
and Canada (N = 3). These assignments are based on the World
Bank’s classification of income level as of August 2016 (World
Bank 2016).
Twenty-seven studies focused on vaccines that were part of the
WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in that
country although these vaccines were not specified by name. Two
studies focused on EPI vaccines but focused on one of these vac-
cines specifically (MMR in one study and hepatitis B in the other).
Six studies focused exclusively on the MMR vaccine and one on
the oral polio vaccine. Two studies focused on the MMR vaccine
in combination with another vaccine (tDap/IPV booster and the
5-in-1). One study focused on the influenza vaccine. All but one
of the studies with a focus on the MMR vaccine were undertaken
in the UK (the other took place in Switzerland).
Thirty-seven studies focused on routine immunisation pro-
grammes. Only one study exclusively focused on a vaccination
campaign (specifically, a polio campaign in India) (Hussain 2012).
Quality of the included qualitative studies
All of the included studies were published as papers in health re-
search journals, which can lead to word limits that are not par-
ticularly well suited for reporting qualitative research. In general,
there was poor reporting of context, sampling, research methods
and researcher reflexivity across the studies. All studies gave some
description, even if very brief, about the participants, sampling,
methods and analysis. Most of the studies used interview or fo-
cus group discussions with very few instances of other methods
of qualitative data collection such as participant observation. The
general lack of rich data and thick description in the studies may
also have been due to the limitations set by journals publishing
the studies.
Categories and findings identified in the data
In this section, we present the categories identified in the data syn-
thesis and the findings of the review that correspond to each cate-
gory. At the end of the results section, we bring together the results
of this synthesis and the interventions studied in the three COM-
MVAC effectiveness reviews (Oyo-Ita 2016; Kaufman 2013; Sae-
terdal 2014) and present them in a comparative table.
From the constant comparison thematic synthesis, we developed
six overarching categories related to vaccination information: tim-
ing of vaccination information; availability of vaccination infor-
mation; amount of vaccination information; source of vaccination
information; content of vaccination information; and influence
of the relationship between vaccination information, the way it is
communicated and vaccination decisions.
Findings
In the sections below, we report each finding and provide a link
to the CERQual evidence profile table supporting the assessment
of confidence in that finding. We start each section with a link
to the ’CERQual summary of qualitative findings’ table. For each
finding, we start with a short, overall summary and then present
the detailed results.
Timing of vaccination information
Summary of qualitative findings table (Table 3).
Finding 1: Parents liked to receive information about
vaccination before the baby was born for reasons such as
fatigue and time limitations for reading about vaccination
after delivery (low confidence).
Table 4
A few studies found that parents wanted to receive information
about their child’s vaccinations during pregnancy and well before
the first vaccination appointment (Benin 2006; Tickner 2007;
Miller 2008; Barbieri 2015; Saada 2015). Benin 2006 found that
unless parents accepted vaccination without question (that is, they
did not view it as a decision that needed to be made), they made
the decision to vaccinate before the baby was born. Parents in
Benin 2006 and Tickner 2007 felt that they had more time to look
for information before the baby arrived, while parents in Barbieri
2015 and Miller 2008 also reported having more time to critically

Cochrane Collaboration.
 appraise information at this stage. They felt that after the baby was
born was not an optimal time for learning and making decisions
about vaccination due to stress and fatigue (Tickner 2007; Miller
2008).
“ ’I think people should look into it, but when you’ve got a six-
week old baby, you’ve got a job to even like get enough rest for
yourself, let alone going to look on the Internet and your baby’s
injection is due in two-weeks time. So I don’t think . . . maybe
this should all be done before the baby’s born . . . you know, all
the information should be given before the child’s born. Erm it’s
a bit like the vitamin K that they give the baby after they’re born,
they ask you when you’re in labour. Well I’m not being funny but,
you know, there’s no way on this earth that you’re gonna start oh
I’ve got to go on the Internet a minute, you know [Laughter]. You
know, you just go along with, you know, what they say’ ” (Tickner
2007).
Finding 2: Parents liked to receive vaccination information in
good time before each appointment, including all follow-up
appointments, in order to reflect on the content and
prepare questions (moderate confidence).
Table 5
Some studies reported that parents wanted information about vac-
cination to be communicated well in advance of the vaccination
appointment (Evans 2001; McMurray 2004; Shui 2005; Fowler
2007; Saada 2015; Dube 2016), and some wanted to receive infor-
mation multiple times before the appointment (Shui 2005; Fowler
2007). They felt that if this was the case they would have time to
review and reflect on the content and prepare any questions they
might want to ask during the vaccination session (Evans 2001;
McMurray 2004; Shui 2005). Some parents suggested that an op-
timal time to communicate the information was with the vacci-
nation appointment card giving the appointment date and time
for the next vaccination (Evans 2001). Only one study found that
parents wanted to receive more information at the vaccination ap-
pointment as well as in advance (McMurray 2004).
In three studies, parents reported not receiving information about
vaccination before or during follow-up vaccination appointments
(McMurray 2004; Tickner 2010; Brown 2012). Parents noted that
when they only received information at the first vaccination visit,
they often lost it or forgot it by the time of the follow-up appoint-
ment months or years later (McMurray 2004; Brown 2012). For
example, parents in Brown 2012 reported receiving a leaflet de-
scribing all childhood vaccines a full year before having to make
the decision about the MMR vaccine, and by that time, they had
lost the leaflet. Parents also wanted information to be communi-
cated in advance about new vaccines that were introduced into
the vaccination programme. When they received this information
at the time of the appointment they felt overwhelmed and some-
times decided against vaccination (Dube 2016).
“Interviewer (I): And why you did not give the rotavirus vaccine?
”Participant (P): Because it is a live vaccine, I thought that the risk
of being contaminated by the stools was greater than the danger
of catching gastroenteritis. And the fact that it’s a new vaccine as
well, I know they’re doing studies on it, but I was uncomfortable
with it anyway. As well, I didn’t know that this new vaccine had
come out, and they presented it to us right at the moment of
vaccination and we had to make a decision immediately [laughs].
So that’s why, without much time to think about it and the fact
that I was uncomfortable, I decided not to have him vaccinated“
(Dube 2016).
Finding 3: Parents found it difficult to remember
information communicated during a vaccination
appointment as they were distracted and worried about
their child (moderate confidence).
Table 6
In a few studies parents felt that receiving information during a
vaccination appointment was not ideal, as they were tired, dis-
tracted by their child and worried about how the child would react
to being vaccinated (Shui 2005; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010).
” ’When [your child is] called in and getting ready to get the shots
you’re flustered with worrying about how to comfort the child . .
. you’re not thinking about trying to read that information at the
time. You need it ahead of time’ “ (Shui 2005).
Availability of vaccination information
Summary of qualitative findings table (Table 7).
Finding 4: Parents want vaccination information resources
to be available at a wider range of health services and
community and online settings, for instance through
schools, pharmacies, clinics and libraries (low confidence).
Table 8
Parents stated that information was currently available to them
from a range of sources, including but not limited to:
• public health nurses (Guillaume 2004; Austvoll-Dahlgren
2010), doctors (Guillaume 2004; Benin 2006; Fadda 2015), and
other health professionals (Evans 2001);
• group health talks (Berhanel 2000);
• their pharmacy (Tickner 2010);
• medical publications (Guillaume 2004; Brunson 2015);
• leaflets (Guillaume 2004);
• posters (Berhanel 2000);
• the Internet (Evans 2001), including government websites
(Brunson 2015);
• the library (Tickner 2010);
• baby care books and articles (Evans 2001; Benin 2006;
Brunson 2015);
• their child’s play group or preschool (Tickner 2010);

 • peers and friends (Berhanel 2000; Evans 2001; Benin 2006;
Tickner 2010).
However, a few studies found that parents wanted vaccination
information to be available at a wider range of locations (Shui
2005; Fowler 2007; Miller2008; Fadda 2015). None of the articles
addressed why parents wanted broader options for the availability
of vaccination information. Only Fadda 2015 explained that they
wanted multiple views about vaccination to be available as part of
the same communication intervention in order to avoid events or
information that were one-sided or only for or against vaccination.
Finding 5: Parents want help from health workers to locate
relevant vaccination information resources (low confidence).
Table 9
A few studies found that locating information was difficult for
some parents, and they wanted help from health workers (Miller
2008; Fadda 2015), for example recommendations on reliable In-
ternet sites for finding additional information following a consul-
tation (Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Fadda 2015).
Finding 6: Parents who had migrated to a new country had
difficulty negotiating the new health system and accessing
and understanding vaccination information (low confidence).
Table 10
A few studies found that parents who had migrated had difficulty
accessing and negotiating their new health system (Tomlinson
2013; Harmsen 2015; Kowal 2015). Some parents who had mi-
grated had insufficient knowledge about how immunisation ser-
vicesandpoliciesworkedintheirnewcountriesconcerning,forex-
ample, schedules, appointment structure and the expected amount
of information to be given out (Tomlinson 2013; Harmsen 2015;
Kowal 2015). They also felt that there was a lack of both oral
and written information in their own language (Tomlinson 2013;
Harmsen 2015; Kowal 2015).
Parents’ understanding of immunisation and how services should
be delivered came from their personal experiences in their country
of origin (Tomlinson 2013; Harmsen 2015; Kowal 2015). Kowal
2015 foundthatparentsbelieveditwaseasiertolocate information
about vaccination in their home countries, whereas the move to
the host country entailed the loss of their social support network
for obtaining health promotion information.
Amount of vaccination information
Summary of qualitative findings table (Table 11).
Many articles presented findings around the amount of infor-
mation parents wanted and how they felt about the amount of
vaccination information that was available or that they had re-
ceived (Bond 1998; Berhanel 2000; Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004;
Shui 2005; Benin 2006; Fowler 2007; Tickner 2007; Gust 2008;
Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Tickner 2010; Bond 2011;
Figueiredo 2011; Harmsen2012; Hussain 2012; Tomlinson 2013;
Fadda 2015; Harmsen 2015; Blaisdell 2016; Sobo 2016).
Finding 7: Parents generally found the amount of
vaccination information they received to be inadequate
(high confidence).
Table 12
Many studies found that parents were dissatisfied with the amount
of vaccination information that they received (Bond 1998; Evans
2001; Guillaume 2004; Shui 2005; Fowler 2007; Tickner 2007;
Gust 2008; Tickner 2010; Bond 2011; Figueiredo 2011; Harmsen
2012; Hussain 2012; Tomlinson 2013; Fadda 2015; Harmsen
2015; Blaisdell 2016; Sobo 2016). Some parents felt that even
though there was more information available now than previously,
it was still not enough to meet their information needs (Gust
2008; Figueiredo 2011; Fadda 2015; Harmsen 2015; Sobo 2016).
This lack of information sometimes served to reinforce their con-
cerns about vaccination (Shui 2005; Fowler 2007; Harmsen 2012;
Fadda 2015; Harmsen 2015; Sobo 2016). Lack of information or
inadequate answers to parents’ questions and concerns led to par-
ents feeling angry about their lack of knowledge and sometimes to
have doubts about the vaccination programme (Bond 1998; Bond
2011; Hussain 2012; Fadda 2015; Blaisdell 2016). Many parents
said that inadequate information had hampered their decision-
making (Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004; Fowler 2007; Tomlinson
2013).
” ’But that’s very confusing isn’t it, as a parent because you ob-
viously want the best for your child and when you see all these
reports . . . and you’re trying to look at it and make an educated
decision . . . I think just basically there’s a complete lack of infor-
mation . . . I think there needs to be something a bit sort of totally
universal that everyone can sort of get their hands on and that’s
independent ’cause I think people are just either way polarised’ “
(Evans 2001).
” ’We would like to have information before vaccination. There is
not enough information . . . therefore there occur doubts [regard-
ing vaccination]’ “ (Fowler 2007).
Only one study, undertaken in Ethiopia, found that parents were
satisfied with the amount of information they were receiving. This
was based on exit interviews after a health talk. However, the
same study, when using in-depth interviews, found that parents
were actually dissatisfied with the information they received about
childhood vaccination and wanted more (Berhanel 2000).
Finding 8: The amount of information parents would like to
receive seemed to have an inverse relationship with their
acceptance of vaccination (low confidence).
Table 13
Parents who accepted vaccination wanted less information than
parents who had concerns or were thinking of not vaccinating (or

 had not vaccinated) their child (Guillaume 2004; Benin 2006;
Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Bond 2011; Kowal 2015).
”On the contrary, searching for information was reported to be
more likely if parents were undecided or negative towards vacci-
nation, for example if hearing about serious side effects or if not
trusting the information provided by the public health nurse. One
parent explained: ’Then you may be wary if somebody you know
closely and you have seen it with you own eyes, someone who has
had side effects … Then I think you may look up more informa-
tion on your own’ “ (Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010).
Different parents had different approaches to the amount of infor-
mation they wanted. Parents with concerns wanted a large amount
of clearly presented information (Guillaume 2004). Some parents
kept searching for more information to confirm their decision even
after they had decided (Guillaume 2004). Other parents searched
for as much information as possible until they felt they could make
a decision, even if this meant delaying the vaccination. Finally,
some parents made a choice and then attempted to limit the extent
to which they were exposed to information that could influence
their decision (Guillaume 2004).
” ’I think honestly speaking, this sounds stupid, but I think well,
I don’t want to hear it [about side effects], because it scares me. I
know it might be stupid because you think, well you know they’re
s’posed to have it but if you start thinking well, what if you know
if this happens and that happens well, then you won’t immunise
your children, so, there’s a risk I s’pose’ “ (Bond 2011).
Source of vaccination information
Summary of qualitative findings table (Table 14).
The source of information (i.e. where it came from) was important
to many parents. Most parents talked about a range of official and
unofficial sources and their pros and cons (Brown 2012).
Finding 9: Parents generally found it difficult to know which
vaccination information sources to trust (high confidence).
Table 15
Judging the trustworthiness of information sources was a chal-
lenge for many parents (Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004; McMurray
2004; Shui 2005; Benin 2006; Fowler 2007; Hilton 2007; Tickner
2007; Austin 2008; Gust 2008; Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren
2010; Tickner 2010; Brown 2012; Harmsen 2012; Hussain 2012;
Blaisdell 2016; Sobo 2016). Parent perspectives on the trustwor-
thiness of a source varied between those who had decided to vac-
cinate, those questioning vaccination, and those who had decided
not to vaccinate (Benin 2006; Austin 2008; Brown 2012; Sobo
2016). Trusting the source of the information was perceived by
some to be even more important than the content of the informa-
tion (Guillaume 2004). Sources mentioned included health pro-
fessionals, government, politicians, public health institutes, poli-
cymakers, researchers, mass media, television, newspapers, the In-
ternet, books, leaflets, peers and friends.
Finding 10: Parents found it difficult to find a vaccination
information source that they perceived as impartial or
providing balanced information (high confidence).
Table 16
Some parents felt that finding impartial and balanced informa-
tion sources was problematic for a number of reasons (Bond
1998; Guillaume 2004; McMurray 2004; Hilton 2007; Tickner
2007; Austin 2008; Gust 2008; Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren
2010; Brown 2012; Harmsen 2012; Hussain 2012; Dube 2016).
Some parents expressed a belief that the government or healthcare
providers were withholding information about vaccination and
that they were only being told about the benefits (Guillaume 2004;
Hilton 2007; Tickner 2007; Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren
2010; Brown 2012; Dube 2016).
” ’I don’t think it gives you the whole picture. It [the information]
gives . . . the profession what the parents need to know, which is
have your children immunised . . . and this is what happens if you
don’t. But it doesn’t give you the rest of the picture’ “ (Tickner
2007).
” ’Both sides of the story. I got only the medical side . . . what the
doctors have been taught . . . what the nurses have been taught. I
only got the side that they’ve been taught in medical school . . . It
works for some . . . What about the children who have problems?
And what they didn’t tell me was the other side of the coin . . . so
that I could weigh it out for myself’ “ (Miller 2008).
Parents also questioned how objective healthcare providers were
in providing information, feeling that their impartiality was com-
promised due to incentives (McMurray 2004; Hilton 2007;
Austin 2008; Brown 2012; Dube 2016), their medical training
(Brown 2012), influences from the government (Guillaume 2004;
McMurray 2004), being pro-vaccination (McMurray 2004), and
their perceived unwillingness to discuss alternatives (Guillaume
2004), among other things.
” ’I’ve never had a problem with doctors not being willing to listen
to my viewpoint, but I know that doctors and health professionals
have togive the governmentline,soIamnotexpectinganunbiased
discussion’ “ (McMurray 2004).
Some parents also believed that the media only reported one side
of the story (Guillaume 2004).
Finding 11: Parental attitudes towards vaccination
influenced which vaccination information sources they
trusted (moderate confidence).
Table 17
Some studies found that pre-existing views on vaccination shaped
parents’ trust in different vaccination information sources (Bond
1998; Benin 2006; Hilton 2007; Austin 2008; Gust 2008;
Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brown 2012; Hussain 2012; Brunson
2013; Kowal 2015; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016). Parentswhoaccepted
vaccination tended to trust their healthcare provider (Benin 2006;
Gust 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brown 2012; Kowal 2015;

 Dube 2016; Sobo 2016), and they gave less credence to informa-
tion suggesting that vaccines were not safe (Brunson 2013; Hilton
2007).
Parents who were hesitant towards vaccination, had delayed vac-
cinating or had decided not to vaccinate were less likely to trust
their provider (Bond 1998; Benin 2006; Hilton 2007; Austin
2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brown 2012; Brunson 2013;
Sobo 2016), and they were more inclined to believe that sources
questioning vaccine safety provided missing information (Hilton
2007). These parents often questioned healthcare providers’ mo-
tives and objectivity (Bond 1998; Hilton 2007; Austin 2008;
Brown 2012; Brunson 2013). Previous negative experiences had
often damaged their trust in allopathic providers, leading them to
seek trusting relationships with an alternative healthcare provider
such as a homeopath (Benin 2006; Brown 2012). Other parents
turnedtoresourcessuch asbooks, the Internetormagazines(Benin
2006; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010), with some distrusting govern-
ment and research sources (Brown 2012).
Finding 12: Parents wanted vaccination information to be
available outside of the context of vaccination
appointments, including from health workers, parents’
groups, online forums and other sources. Parents in some
studies wanted the opportunity to discuss this information
with people who were not involved in their child’s
vaccination appointment (high confidence).
Table 18
Some parents wanted the option to discuss vaccination out-
side of the context of vaccination appointments, including with
health workers, parents’ groups and other people, to receive ex-
posure to different opinions and voices (Evans 2001; McMurray
2004; Fowler 2007; Tickner 2007; Miller 2008; Tickner 2010;
Figueiredo 2011; Brown 2014; Kitayama2014; Fadda 2015; Saada
2015; Sobo 2016). Some of these parents suggested designated
discussion times during health education or postnatal support vis-
its (Evans 2001; Fadda 2015). Others wanted to discuss vaccina-
tion with their baby support groups but felt this was not possible
as the child would have already received their first vaccination by
then (Tickner 2007). Other suggested contexts for these discus-
sions included:
• doctors’ offices, hospitals and health units (Evans 2001;
Fowler 2007; Miller 2008; Fadda 2015; Saada 2015);
• prenatal classes (Miller 2008);
• libraries (Miller 2008; Tickner 2010);
• the Internet (Miller 2008);
• pharmacies (Fowler 2007; Tickner 2010);
• child’s play groups or preschool/kindergarten (McMurray
2004; Fowler 2007; Tickner 2010);
• the workplace (Fowler 2007);
• home visits (Fadda 2015; Figueiredo 2011);
• church (Figueiredo 2011);
• public presentations (Figueiredo 2011); and
• mobile health (mHealth) interventions such as text
messages and online immunisation cards (Brown 2014;
Kitayama 2014).
Some parents felt that having information available through a
broader spectrum of sources and sites would give them the chance
for discussion without the time constraints of a doctor’s office and
could facilitate access to a variety of stakeholders with different
viewpoints (McMurray 2004; Fadda 2015; Saada 2015).
Finding 13: Health workers are an important source of
vaccination information for parents (high confidence).
Table 19
Many studies attested to the important role of health work-
ers in providing vaccination information to parents (Berhanel
2000; Guillaume 2004; McMurray 2004; Benin 2006; Hilton
2007; Tickner 2007; Gust 2008; Miller 2008; Tadesse 2009;
Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Tickner 2010; Bond 2011; Brunson
2013; Brown 2014; Delkhosh 2014; Fadda 2015; Harmsen 2015;
Kowal 2015; Saada 2015; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016). For parents
who accepted vaccination, these health workers worked within the
allopathic health system and were public health nurses, paediatri-
cians, general practitioners and general health workers (Guillaume
2004; McMurray 2004; Benin 2006; Tickner 2007; Gust 2008;
Miller 2008; Tadesse 2009; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brunson
2013; Delkhosh 2014; Fadda 2015; Harmsen 2015; Kowal 2015;
Saada 2015; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016). Parents who were hesi-
tant towards vaccination, had delayed vaccinating or had decided
not to vaccinate, often sought the counsel of alternative medicine
practitioners such as chiropractors and homeopaths (Benin 2006;
Miller 2008; Brunson 2013; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016).
Finding 14: In their interactions and communication with
health workers, parents expected longer-than-usual
appointments; clear answers to their questions; information
tailored to their needs; and open discussions where health
workers were helpful, caring, sensitive and receptive to their
concerns. Parents complained when these characteristics
were missing (high confidence).
Table 20
A number of studies discussed parents’ expectations of health
workers in relation to communicating information about vac-
cination (Bond 1998; Berhanel 2000; Evans 2001; Guillaume
2004; McMurray 2004; Shui 2005; Benin 2006; Fowler 2007;
Tickner 2007; Austin 2008; Gust 2008; Henderson 2008; Miller
2008; Tadesse 2009; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Tickner 2010;

2015; Kowal 2015; Saada 2015; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016). The
studies suggested that many parents expected:

 • good, clear answers to their questions (McMurray 2004;
Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Hussain 2012; Brown 2014; Delkhosh
2014; Brunson 2015; Fadda 2015);
• long, open discussions where they felt listened to (Bond
1998; Evans 2001; Benin 2006; Austin 2008; Gust 2008; Bond
2011; Delkhosh 2014; Brunson 2015; Fadda 2015; Saada 2015;
Dube 2016; Sobo 2016);
• a knowledgeable health worker with the correct
information (Benin 2006; Delkhosh 2014; Brunson 2015;
Fadda 2015; Dube 2016);
• consideration of their individual needs, using a ’whole
person’ approach (Benin 2006; Brunson 2015; Saada 2015;
Dube 2016; Sobo 2016);
• friendly, caring, sensitive and supportive health workers
with good interpersonal communication skills (Bond 1998;
Berhanel 2000; Shui 2005; Fowler 2007; Henderson 2008;
Tadesse 2009; Bond 2011; Delkhosh 2014; Dube 2016; Sobo
2016);
• advice supported by evidence (Brown 2012; Fadda 2015;
Dube 2016);
• a good, supportive relationship not based on the
vaccination status of their children (Guillaume 2004; Dube
2016; Sobo 2016);
• long appointments (Shui 2005; Tickner 2010; Harmsen
2012; Harmsen 2015; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016);
• empathy with their parental responsibility in making the
decision (Harmsen 2012; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016);
• explanations about health workers’ actions during a
vaccination appointment (Miller 2008; Harmsen 2015; Kowal
2015);
• availability of information from health workers (Shui 2005;
Dube 2016);
• treatment as a partner in their child’s care (Evans 2001;
Shui 2005; Saada 2015; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016).
Many articles also discussed the implications of not realising these
expectations (Bond 1998; Berhanel 2000; Shui 2005; Benin 2006;
Gust 2008; Henderson 2008; Tickner 2010; Bond 2011; Brown
2012; Delkhosh 2014; Brunson 2015; Fadda 2015). For example,
a participant in one study described the challenges faced in trying
to find information on vaccination:
” ’I’ve gotten some information from the baby care books . . .
From peers, too, friends . . . Getting information about why the
vaccination schedule is the way it is, no one can seem to really
answer for me, even my doctor. I’ve asked my doctors that question
. . . I really haven’t gotten a really good answer . . . I feel like I can’t
get really solid information’ “ (Benin 2006).
Parents felt that doctors had neither the time or the motivation
to find answers for them (Benin 2006). Most parents felt that the
contact time they had with health workers was too short and did
not leave time for discussion (Berhanel 2000; Shui 2005; Gust
2008; Delkhosh 2014; Brunson 2015; Fadda 2015; Saada 2015;
Dube 2016; Sobo 2016). A study in Ethiopia also showed that
the information communicated in clinic health talks was not stan-
dardised and that the content and quality varied between loca-
tions. There was also a lack of health promotion materials in clin-
ics, such as posters and support materials (Berhanel 2000).
In a few articles, parents made recommendations about how they
would like to communicate with health workers and the role that
health workers could play in providing information (McMurray
2004; Miller2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren2010). Parentsbelievedthat
health workers could be better at recommending and finding lit-
erature from trustworthy sources to give to them at consultations
(Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Dube 2016), and they ex-
pected provider knowledge to be up-to-date and well informed
(Miller 2008; Sobo 2016). Another option put forward was to
give parents access to information intermediaries at nurseries or
school forums. This would allow them to compare the views of
local practitioners and third parties and give parents opportunities
to discuss these views (McMurray 2004; Fadda 2015). This coop-
eration between different health sectors and caregivers would help
parents feel like their various health providers were on the same
page and working together (Miller 2008). Parents also suggested
that information on the risks and benefits of vaccination could be
made more relevant to their local context (McMurray 2004).
Parents also suggested that health workers provide a receptive en-
vironment to questions and open discussion to address their con-
cerns (Miller 2008; Delkhosh 2014). They also wanted health
workers to be aware of how their behaviour and demeanour af-
fected parents (Miller 2008; Delkhosh 2014). Parents wanted
health workers to communicate in clear, simple terms and respect
them as the decision-makers.
” ’. . . and to have the answers, you know, or if . . . if they don’t
know, that maybe they could suggest where I might be able to find
that information, you know . . . where I might look . . . you know?
I’d like it to be validated that, you know, it is a concern . . . even
though, to them, this one child in a million, right? But to me, it’s
my child’ “ (Miller 2008).
Finding 15: Some parents accepted and preferred
vaccination information and reminders communicated
electronically through mobile health (mHealth) applications,
for example via text messages or electronic vaccination
cards (low confidence).
Table 21
Two studies found that parents appreciated vaccination infor-
mation provided electronically (Brown 2014; Kitayama 2014).
Kitayama 2014 explored the perceived advantages of using an on-
line immunisation tool within an underserved Latino community
in New York. Parents felt that the online tool would save them
a lot of time and give them easier access to their child’s update
immunisation card. Parents also highlighted the ability to print
out a hard copy.
” ’It’s good because, if you need a copy, you just go there, get one

 and print it out instead of having to call the doctor’s office, wait
in line and paying four dollars for a trip there . . . and with a child
that you can’t leave at home, I think it’s good. You can do a lot of
things automatically. It saves a lot of time’ “ (Kitayama 2014).
Brown 2014 looked into the acceptance of weekly text blasts, text
messages with information or appointment reminders, for single,
adolescent mothers in Nebraska, USA. The mothers felt supported
by and became reliant on the text messages. They were seen as
reliable andtrustworthysourcesof importantinformation fortheir
health and that of their child. The messages were a good fit with
the participants’ learning and lifestyles, and they liked the fact that
they could go back and re-read the messages at any time.
” ’It’s helpful that I can keep the messages right here (phone in
hand) so I can go back and reread them if I forgot something. I
have all the messages saved in my phone and will have access to
them until I erase them’ “ (Brown 2014).
Finding 16: Parents felt that the vaccination card was a
potentially important source of vaccination information, for
instance about the names of the diseases, the names of the
vaccines and the date for the next appointment. However,
some parents and informal caregivers found it difficult to
read and understand this information (moderate
confidence).
Table 22
Parentsreportedthatthe dateswrittenonthe vaccinationcardwere
important, andtheyusedthe cardtoplanforattendingvaccination
sessions (Babirye 2011; Figueiredo 2011; Kitayama 2014; Barbieri
2015; Fadda 2015).
” ’As for me, I make sure that when my wife is pregnant she attends
the antenatal clinic as required and is also immunised because she
usually tells me when she is immunised. Also after she gives birth
I make sure she takes the children for immunisation on the dates
written on the immunisation card’ “ (Babirye 2011).
Parents found that the vaccination card provided them with prac-
tical knowledge and was an important source of information
(Figueiredo 2011; Kitayama 2014; Barbieri 2015). A few parents
in the UK mentioned the vaccination card as a source of informa-
tion (Tickner 2007).
Parents in Turkey also believed that the vaccination card could be
a good source of information but noted that they could not access
this information because they could not read or understand what
was written (Topuzo lu 2007).
”Mothers also did not know which vaccine was administered to
their children. This was because they could not read the name
of the vaccine from the vaccination card and they could not get
satisfactory information from the health personnel administering
the vaccine: ’You cannot understand it [which vaccine was ad-
ministered] from the card; also they [the health personnel] do not
say anything. You just take the child and they give the vaccine’ “
(Topuzo lu 2007).
Finding 17: Parents regarded scientific sources as desirable,
particularly if the source was objective, complete and
independent of the government. Scientific sources were
seen to be more reliable than discussion forums or lay
opinions, but some saw them as having conflicts of interest
(low confidence).
Table 23
Insome studiesparentsmentionedhealth research orresearch pub-
licationsasasource of information(Guillaume 2004; Hilton2007;
Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brown 2012; Harmsen 2012; Brunson
2013; Barbieri 2015; Brunson 2015; Blaisdell 2016; Sobo 2016).
In three (Guillaume 2004; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Harmsen
2012), parents expressed a preference for research-based informa-
tion, which they perceived as more reliable, independent (from
government) and more impartial than other sources (Guillaume
2004). However, parents who expressed a preference for research-
basedinformationsometimeshaddifficultyaccessing, understand-
ing and assessing it due to the use of jargon and technical terms
(Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010). Some parents also believed that re-
search studies could be flawed, and that the independent research
that they would like to have seen done to address some of their
questions and concerns was neither ethically nor practically feasi-
ble (Brown 2012; Sobo 2016). Parents in one study felt that the
current evidence on vaccines was incomplete, although they did
not describe in what ways (Brown 2012).
Four studies (three from the UK and one from the USA)
(Guillaume 2004; Hilton 2007; Brown 2012; Brunson 2013), fo-
cusing on the controversy surrounding the MMR vaccine men-
tioned Andrew Wakefield and his now discredited study, which
claimed to have found a link between the vaccine and autism but
which was found to be fatally flawed both scientifically and eth-
ically (Godlee 2011). Some parents had disregarded the Wake-
field study findings, believing that the methodology and findings
were flawed. However, others believed that there must be merit
to the findings due to the large amount of attention the study
had received. Parents who were hesitant towards vaccination, had
delayed vaccinating or had decided not to vaccinate tended to
view Wakefield as an impartial doctor and a credible information
source. For many, he was providing the necessary balance they saw
as missing from other vaccine information.
Finding 18: Parents generally viewed the mass media, for
example newspapers, magazines, television and the
Internet, as an important source of vaccination information
(moderate confidence)
Table 24
For many parents, the mass media was an important source of vac-
cination information (Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004; McMurray
2004; Benin 2006; Hilton 2007; Tickner 2007; Tickner 2010;
Figueiredo 2011; Brown 2012; Brown 2014; Delkhosh 2014).

 were often linked to their attitudes towards vaccination. Benin
2006 found that for non-vaccinators, the Internet, books and
Mothering Magazine, along with their homeopath (naturopath),
were the preferred sources of information. Evans 2001 also found
that parents consulted a wide range of sources, including the In-
ternet and alternative medicine books and articles, but they often
perceived the available information to be biased to either one or
the other side of the vaccination debate. Guillaume 2004 found
that parents accessed a wide range of sources when looking for
information about vaccination. These ranged from the television
and newspapers to healthcare providers and politicians. The me-
dia was often their initial source of information, but parents also
used it when making the decision about whether to proceed with
vaccinations. In general, parents considered broadsheet newspa-
pers to be more reliable than television or tabloids. There was
an understanding that all media sources were sensationalist and
could portray information in an unbalanced fashion. To address
this, parents developed their own criteria for judging these sources
and would follow up initial information received from the media
with more traditional sources such as official government leaflets
or their health worker (Guillaume 2004). Finally, a study in Iran
found that media, especially radio and television, were very valu-
able sources of general health information but played a limited
role in informing about vaccination (Delkhosh 2014).
Finding 19: The extent to which parents searched for
information about vaccination, and the manner in which
they received and assessed this information, was linked to
their trust in the information source (high confidence).
Table 25
Many articles mentioned the trust and credibility of vaccination
information sources as influencing how parents search for, re-
ceive, understand and judge information about vaccination (Bond
1998; Guillaume 2004; McMurray 2004; Shui 2005; Benin 2006;
Hilton 2007; Tickner 2007; Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren
2010; Tickner 2010; Brown 2012; Hussain 2012; Tomlinson
2013; Brunson 2013; Delkhosh 2014; Barbieri 2015; Brunson
2015; Harmsen 2015; Kowal 2015; Blaisdell 2016; Sobo 2016).
If a parent trusted the information source and understood the
language that the information was presented in, they were more
likely to accept the information and not search further (Bond
1998; Guillaume 2004; McMurray 2004; Benin 2006; Tickner
2007; Topuzo lu 2007; Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010;
Tickner 2010; Brown 2012; Brunson 2013; Tomlinson 2013;
Barbieri 2015; Harmsen 2015; Sobo 2016). If a parent did not
trust the information source, they were less likely to accept the
information and more likely to keep searching for more informa-
tion (Guillaume 2004; McMurray 2004; Shui 2005; Benin 2006;
Hilton 2007; Tickner 2007; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brown
2012; Harmsen 2012); they were also more inclined to seek out
an alternative information source, such as a homeopath (Benin
2006). Some parents who did not trust an information source,
such as the media, felt they were able to judge the information and
choose what to accept and reject (Guillaume 2004; Fadda 2015).
Finding 20: Parents who trusted their health workers and
accepted vaccination also trusted the information they
received from the health services and searched less for
other information. In contrast, parents who had less trust in
their health worker or in the information they received from
them were more likely to search for outside information
sources (low confidence).
Table 26
In general, parents who accepted vaccination and had decided to
vaccinate trusted the information they received from their health
workers and the health system in general (Benin 2006; Tickner
2007; Austin 2008; Tickner 2010; Brown 2012; Brunson 2013;
Brown 2014; Kowal 2015; Saada 2015; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016).
When parents trusted health workers, they followed their recom-
mendations. Trust in a healthcare provider was a main promoter
of vaccination (Benin 2006).
” ’You know I really . . . feel that I’ve made a decision to trust
our paediatrician . . . So that, you know, I’m kind of ceding the
responsibility of getting more information over to them, trusting
her’ “ (Benin 2006).
When parents did not fully trust in information from their health
worker or the health system, they were more likely to search for
vaccination information from other sources (Benin 2006; Tickner
2007; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Saada 2015; Sobo 2016).
”On the contrary, searching for information was reported to be
more likely if parents were undecided or negative towards vacci-
nation, for example if hearing about serious side effects or if not
trusting the information provided by the public health nurse. One
parent explained: ’Then you may be wary if somebody you know
closely and you have seen it with you own eyes, someone who has
had side effects . . . Then I think you may look up more informa-
tion on your own’ “ (Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010).
Some parents who had decided not to vaccinate did not trust
their healthcare provider or the information they provided. These
parents searched elsewhere for an information source they felt
they could trust and who would not judge their decision not to
vaccinate. They often ended up having a trusting relationship with
an alternative provider such as a naturopath who provided them
with information they found credible (Benin 2006; Brown 2012).
Finding 21: Some parents were not comfortable asking
questions about vaccination or communicating with health
workers, and they felt rushed, intimidated or concerned
about the perceived attitudes of the health worker towards
vaccination (moderate confidence).

qualitative evidence (Review)

Cochrane Collaboration.
 In many settings, parents felt uncomfortable asking questions.
There was a variety of reasons for this including limited time, the
attitudes of health workers, language barriers or not knowing that
questions were allowed (Evans 2001; McMurray 2004; Topuzo lu
2007; Tomlinson 2013; Delkhosh 2014; Harmsen 2015; Saada
2015; Dube 2016).
In Turkey and Iran, mothers said that they did not receive any
informationfromhealth workersandthushadnoknowledge ofthe
vaccinations their children were receiving. Parents were inhibited
by the negative attitudes of the health workers. They felt that
they did not have the courage to ask questions (Topuzo lu 2007;
Delkhosh 2014).
In high-income settings, some parents were also reluctant to ask
questions during consultations. They were afraid that if they asked
questions they would be labelled a nuisance or receive different
treatment (Evans 2001; Saada 2015; Dube 2016), or they did not
understand the explanations from the health services and so did
not feel comfortable asking questions (Tomlinson 2013; Harmsen
2015). Others did not ask questions due to the rushed nature of
the consultation and the knowledge that other parents were wait-
ing outside (McMurray 2004; Harmsen 2015; Saada 2015; Dube
2016). Communication during consultations was further dimin-
ished when practitioners were unwilling to engage in discussion
or were dismissive, condescending or coercive (McMurray 2004).
This was especially the case for parents who had decided to delay
or refuse vaccinations (Saada 2015; Dube 2016).
Finding 22: Judgement and pressure from health workers
made parents feel uncomfortable or alienated and could
negatively influence their relationship with healthcare
providers. In some cases this also influenced their intention
to vaccinate (moderate confidence).
Table 28
Some studies mentioned judgement and pressure from health
workers as an influence on vaccination communication and deci-
sion-making (Evans 2001; Benin 2006; Topuzo lu 2007; Austin
2008; Babirye 2011; Brown 2012; Delkhosh 2014; Saada 2015;
Dube 2016; Sobo 2016). Sometimes this pressure and or judge-
ment on the part of the health worker would influence the parent
to vaccinate, and other times it pushed the parents in the oppo-
site direction. In all cases, it made parents feel uncomfortable and
influenced their relationships with their health worker and the
health system.
A few studies found that pressure from health workers pushed par-
ents towards vaccinating (Evans 2001; Topuzo lu 2007; Brown
2012). Some parents in HICs felt that it made it easier for them
to comply and vaccinate than to refuse vaccinations (Evans 2001;
Brown 2012). A few parents vaccinated because they feared that
health workers would negatively judge their parenting if their child
was to fall ill (Brown 2012). Those that accepted vaccination due
to pressure felt that they were unable to have an open discussion
with their health worker and did not feel that they had made an
informed decision (Evans 2001; Saada 2015). This constant pres-
sure and reminders often created trepidation among parents who
began to fear going back for their next vaccination appointment
(Brown 2012).
In Turkey and Uganda, parents vaccinated because they were told
to do so by health workers (Topuzo lu 2007; Babirye 2011). In
Turkey, mothers had little information about why they should
vaccinate orwhytheyneededtocome onschedule, butthe negative
attitudes of the health workers showed them that vaccination must
be important.
” ’If vaccines were not needed, the health personnel would not
become so annoyed when we miss a session’ “ (Topuzo lu 2007).
This was in contrast to some other parents who moved towards
not immunising when pressured by health workers (Evans 2001;
Topuzo lu 2007; Austin 2008; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016). Parents
who were hesitant or had decided not to vaccinate felt singled out
and treated differently.
” ’[The doctor] was so insistent that I should have her immunised.
The more insistent he was, the less I wanted to have it done’ “
(Austin 2008).
These parents felt it was difficult to go against medical advice.
However, many of them grew more confident, had changed their
views over time with subsequent children and felt more comfort-
able questioning health workers and declining vaccination (Evans
2001; Sobo 2016).
Judgement, stigmatisation and negative attitudes from health
workers made mothers in Uganda, Iran and Turkey feel as if they
did not want to return to use vaccination services (Topuzo lu
2007; Babirye 2011; Delkhosh 2014,). In Uganda, poor moth-
ers often felt stigmatised and bullied by other mothers and health
workers because of the way they dressed and thus feared visiting
the immunisation clinic (Babirye 2011). In Turkey, the negative
attitudes and reprimands from health workers for delaying an im-
munisation or asking questions made mothers not want to use the
vaccination services (Topuzo lu 2007).
Regardless of whether parents ended up vaccinating (or vice versa)
because of the pressure and judgement from health workers, the in-
teractions made them feel uncomfortable (Evans 2001; McMurray
2004; Benin 2006; Topuzo lu 2007; Austin 2008; Brown 2012;
Delkhosh 2014; Saada 2015; Dube 2016). Many parents felt pres-
sured about vaccination at inappropriate times, and the pressure
from health workers often led parents to feel guilty about their
choice (Austin 2008). Non-vaccinators reported facing constant
questioning and reminders every time they came in contact with
health services (Brown 2012), and that often left them feeling
alienated by the medical establishment, with practices refusing to
take them as clients (Benin 2006; Saada 2015).
” ’So I feel that I am not immunising, walking a tightrope . . . it
was very hard to deal with the amount of medical pressure I was
put under. You can be made to feel you are inadequate parent if
you are not providing your full range of vaccinations’ “ (Austin

 2008).
Finding 23: Parents, especially those who were hesitant or
refused to vaccinate, believed that health workers were
receiving incentives or payments for vaccination targets and
questioned if the motives for vaccination were financial gain,
instead of the best interest of the child (moderate
confidence).
Table 29
Parents, especially those who were unsure or refused to vaccinate,
felt that health workers were receiving incentives or payments and
were therefore motivated by profit, or the need to meet targets in
order to receive incentives, rather than the well being of their child
(Evans 2001; McMurray 2004; Shui 2005; Benin 2006; Hilton
2007; Austin2008; Brown 2012; Blaisdell2016; Dube 2016; Sobo
2016).
” ’[GPs] have targets, if they don’t vaccinate everyone in their pa-
tient list then I think they lose money. So the, if they’re using tar-
gets rather than looking at it on a child by child basis and whether
or not the child should have it, then I think the motivations are
money ultimately’ “ (Brown 2012).
” ’What do you do as a parent? You don’t know who to trust.
Because these are the people- you’re meant to trust your doctor
implicitly and yet people are saying well, you know, they’re getting
paid for having so many people vaccinated and all this, and you
start thinking, well . . . who’s got my wee boy’s best interests at
heart’ “ (Hilton 2007).
” ’If [the doctor’s] being paid by pharmaceutical companies, for
doing the work, then I cant really trust his opinion-his or her
opinion-on the safety of it’ “ (Sobo 2016).
Finding 24: High levels of attention to vaccination issues
from government agencies or the media influenced parents’
perceptions of individual vaccines or vaccination in general
(moderate confidence).
Table 30
Some studies found that high levels of attention to a vaccine, or to
controversy surrounding a vaccine, from the government or media
had both positive and negative impacts on parents’ perceptions
(Bond 1998; Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004; McMurray 2004;
Hilton 2007; Tickner 2007; Tickner 2010; Brown 2012). For
some parents, a high level of attention or response led them to
believe in the importance of the vaccine (Tickner 2007; Brown
2012). For other parents, media attention led them to have doubts
(Evans 2001; Hilton 2007; Tickner 2010), believe that there was
a problem with the vaccine (Evans 2001, Brown 2012), or suspect
that the government was withholding information from the public
(Bond 1998).
Finding 25: Some parents distrusted or lacked confidence in
information sources linked to the government. They
considered these to be biased, to be withholding information
or to be motivated by financial gain (moderate confidence).
Table 31
Some studies found that parents perceived information provided
by the government to be incomplete, one-sided or compromised
by vested interests (Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004; Shui 2005;
Hilton 2007; Tickner 2007; Austin 2008; Harmsen 2012; Kowal
2015; Dube 2016; Sobo 2016). At times, this lack of confidence
was rooted in previous responses from governments to public
health crises, such as the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
crisis in the UK and the Tuskagee syphilis experiment in the USA
(Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004; Hilton 2007).
”For others, however the pressure to immunise perhaps suggested
’nanny-state’ politics: ’. . . It’s like a metaphor for the way the
government treats the public. “I know what’s best for you - have a
burger”, sort of thing’ “ (Hilton 2007).
Some parents felt that their concerns about vaccination had not
been adequately addressed (Evans 2001; Shui 2005).
”’There isaquestionmarkbehindthe MMRwhetherthat’sproven
or not there was a question mark, enough for me to sit down and
think about it and I think they misjudged that completely . . .
people do want to know these days, that’s the era we’re living in
. . . don’t just pat us on the head and say, “Oh you’ll be OK” ’ “
(Evans 2001).
Other parents felt that the government was hiding the truth, was
not being transparent or was not providing all of the information
(Guillaume 2004; Harmsen 2012).
” ’I haven’t seen any government programme saying this is what
we have actually done, which to me means that they have got
something to hide if they are not willing to tell everybody what
they have done’ “ (Guillaume 2004).
Some parents also felt that information from the government was
influenced by political and financial factors (Guillaume 2004;
Tickner 2007; Austin 2008). Financial factors included the belief,
reported by parents in Guillaume 2004, that the MMR combina-
tion vaccine was promoted because it was cheaper than individual
vaccines and that the government was profiting from vaccination
by working with pharmaceutical companies (Tickner 2007; Dube
2016; Sobo 2016).
” ’I mean, you know, infant mortality is at its lowest ever and we’re
coming up with this vaccine. You know, I just really think that
the Government and the pharmaceutical companies are in bed
together’ “ (Tickner 2007).
Finally, some parents who had migrated to new health systems
trusted the government in their new country and spoke to this
new trust by comparing it to the distrust of the system they had
left behind (Kowal 2015).
” ’If these vaccinations are at the approval of the government and
have gone through medical and scientific tests and it’s safe, I don’t
think it’s a problem. But if it’s in China, I would be worried. Over

 here, I feel completely secure’ “ (Kowal 2015).
Finding 26: Politicians’ opinions and actions regarding
personal vaccination choices influenced parents’ perceptions
of vaccination (low confidence).
Table 32
A few UK-based studies mentioned the role that politicians play
in parents’ perceptions of vaccination (Guillaume 2004; Hilton
2007, Brown 2012). Guillaume 2004 found that parents looked
to leaders and politicians not only to set an example but with
the expectation that they should share personal and confidential
information to support government policy. The best example of
this in all three studies was the unwillingness of a former Prime
Minister in the UK to share information on whether his son had
received the MMR vaccine in 2001. For many parents, this showed
a lack of trust in the vaccination programme by their political
leader. After the BSE crisis of the early 1990s, parents in the UK
were also uncomfortable with the government using terms such
as ’no proven risk’, which had been misused in the past. This had
led to the view that politicians were putting their own and their
parties’ interests before those of the public (Hilton 2007).
Finding 27: Some parents perceived the mass media as
having sensationalised vaccination stories, thereby
decreasing parental trust in the media (moderate
confidence).
Table 33
Parents often viewed mass media as having hyped up or sen-
sationalised vaccination, which decreased their trust in these
sources (Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004; Fowler 2007; Hilton 2007;
Tickner 2007; Henderson 2008; Brown 2012). Some parents felt
thatthe mediahaddone thisforcommercial benefit(Brown2012).
While a number of parents were aware of their exposure to the
media and felt able to judge the content accordingly (Guillaume
2004), others recognised various issues with media coverage, such
as it being ”heavy, unbalanced and irresponsible“ (Brown 2012),
and they did not fully trust what was reported (Evans 2001;
Guillaume 2004; Tickner 2007; Brown 2012).
Finding 28: Negative publicity about vaccination in the mass
media contributed to concerns about vaccination among
parents (moderate confidence).
Table 34
A general theme from a number of the studies was that the media
contributed to concerns about vaccination among parents (Evans
2001; Guillaume 2004; McMurray 2004; Fowler 2007; Hilton
2007; Tickner 2007; Henderson 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010;
Tickner 2010; Bond 2011). Some parents who were hesitant to
vaccinate or who had decided not to proceed with vaccination
had clearly been influenced by media coverage, for example the
negative coverage of the MMR vaccine and its false link to autism
(Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004; Tickner 2010).
” ’It was because of the media and the press that I looked into
the MMR and decided well whoa, I’m not having that you know,
otherwise, before, I didn’t just didn’t think anything of it’ “ (Evans
2001).
Even parents who had decided to vaccinate had concerns about
vaccination that had been raised by the media (Fowler 2007;
Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010).
” ’I had heard a little bit about harms. That some had got (side
effects). So I was a little sceptical, but I thought that it’s just some-
thing you have to do. So then we did it . . . I didn’t (mention
it), I don’t think so . . . I think I saw it on television a long time
ago. Someone had got brain damage or something like that’ “
(Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010).
Others felt that the negative publicity contributed to feelings that
important information was being withheld from the public (Bond
2011). These concerns sometimes initiated an information search
(McMurray 2004).
In summary, often the key issue was not whether parents were
supplied with information but whether they believed the informa-
tion they received and trusted its source (Guillaume 2004). Some
parents wanted information from official sources. Others required
an established trusting relationship with the information source,
while others still had confidence in information sources they could
relate to. All of these factors helped to establish credibility (Miller
2008).
Content of vaccination information
Summary of qualitative findings table (Table 35).
Finding 29: Parents felt that the information that they
received was biased towards vaccination and its benefits
(moderate confidence).
Table 36
Many studies found that parents thought the information they re-
ceived was one-sided towards vaccination (Evans 2001; Guillaume
2004; Tickner 2007; Gust 2008; Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren
2010; Brown 2012; Saada 2015; Blaisdell 2016; Sobo 2016). Most
parents felt that the information they received only addressed the
positives of vaccination (Tickner 2007; Gust 2008; Miller 2008;
Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Saada 2015), was either completely pro-
immunisation or anti-vaccination (Evans 2001; Saada 2015), or
that health workers only presented information positive to vacci-
nation that they had learned during their training (Miller 2008).
Some parents perceived official information sources to be wilfully
misleading (Brown 2012). TV was mentioned as a source where
the content was often one-sided, with information being portrayed
in a specific way (Guillaume 2004).

qualitative evidence (Review)

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Finding 30: Parents wanted balanced information about
both the benefits and risks of vaccination (high confidence).
Table 37
Parents wanted to understand both the positive and negative
sides to vaccination (Bond 1998; Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004;
McMurray 2004; Hilton 2007; Tickner 2007; Gust 2008; Miller
2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Babirye 2011; Brown 2012;
Brown 2014; Delkhosh 2014; Fadda 2015; Sobo 2016). Balanced
information was believed to be important in order to weigh the
risks and benefits of vaccination when making a decision (Tickner
2007).
” ’There doesn’t seem to be anything balanced does there, there’s
either the government sort of, yes, you know it’s definitely very
safe and every child should have it or there’s the other side where,
you know, they shouldn’t have any etc, and it’s very hard to try
and work out from those two what to do’ “ (Evans 2001).
Some parents felt that the existing information was heavily
weighted towards vaccination and did not discuss the possible risks
or harms (Bond 1998; Guillaume 2004; Gust 2008; Miller 2008;
Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brown 2012; Sobo 2016).
Finding 31: Parents did not find the available information to
be reliable, convincing or credible (low confidence).
Table 38
Parents did not feel they could rely on or fully believe the infor-
mation given to them (Bond 1998; Evans 2001; Hilton 2007;
Harmsen 2012; Fadda 2015; Blaisdell 2016).
” ’I’ve never read anything that’s made me want to go off and do
it so I never have’ “ (Bond 1998).
Some parents felt that with the amount of information available,
something could always be found to reinforce a vaccination posi-
tion (Blaisdell 2016). Parents often noted that blanket statements
such as ’no proven risk’ and ’minimal risk’ were not convincing
and took these to mean that there was no known risk at present,
as past experience had shown that these phrases could be retracted
(Hilton 2007).
Finding 32: Parents wanted information presented and
communicated in a clear and simple way, in a language they
understood. They felt that these factors would increase their
understanding of and ability to assess the content
(moderate confidence).
Table 39
Parents wanted information that was presented in an under-
standable way that avoided technical terms and jargon to facil-
itate their assessment of the content (Shui 2005; Hilton 2007;
Topuzo lu 2007; Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brown
2014; Delkhosh 2014; Kitayama 2014; Fadda 2015; Harmsen
2015). Parents sometimes found medical terminology used in
medical research or by their healthcare provider difficult to under-
stand and evaluate (Shui 2005; Hilton 2007; Topuzo lu 2007;
Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Kitayama 2014; Fadda
2015). Misunderstanding and lack of access were further com-
pounded when written information was presented to illiterate
mothers, when the mother’s education level was not taken into ac-
count when providing information or when health workers did not
provide any information at all (Topuzo lu 2007; Delkhosh 2014).
Parents also wanted information communicated in a language that
they could understand (Kitayama 2014; Harmsen 2015).
Some parents also found presentations in the media unclear due
to the mixing of anecdotal and scientific evidence to create an im-
pression of balance (Hilton 2007). A clear presentation of infor-
mation was important for parents to feel like they had understood
the information they had received (Miller 2008; Brown 2014).
Finding 33: Parents wanted information that was tailored to
their situation, including to their attitudes towards
vaccination and their mother tongue (moderate
confidence).
Table 40
Parents wanted information they could relate to, including with
regard to their attitudes towards vaccination (accepting, question-
ing, hesitant or refusing) (McMurray 2004; Hilton 2007; Gust
2008; Miller 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Bond 2011; Brown

2015; Fadda 2015; Harmsen 2015). Parents felt that the informa-
tion they received about vaccination should be relatable to local
circumstances in order to be accepted as valid, meaningful and
real (McMurray 2004).
Parents were frustrated when the information that they re-
ceived from health workers did not reflect their lived experiences
(McMurray 2004; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brunson 2015), or
when it was not focused on themselves or their child as individu-
als (Miller 2008; Bond 2011; Delkhosh 2014; Fadda 2015). For
parents to be able to relate to vaccination information, it needed
to be communicated in a language the they understood (Kitayama
2014; Harmsen 2015). These experiences could be personal or
through media reports or stories from family and friends. They felt
that the harms from vaccines were not reflected in the information
they received as compared to what they had heard or experienced
(Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010). Others felt that official information
did not reflect real lives in relation to the impact of immunisation
or diseases. Parents felt that because of this, the importance of the
issue was not being communicated (McMurray 2004).
”’Idon’tthinkthey’re [MMRleaflets]hard-hittingenough. Iknow
it’s not nice to see children on telly poorly and what have you,
but it’s like the ones for NSPCC [the National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, UK], they make you want to
cry, but they make you understand what’s going on and I think
that’s what needs to be done about MMR. I think a lot more
information of how many children have died in the past is what
needs to be published, so that people can see that it is working.

 Otherwise there’s going to be a lot of poorly children and a lot
of dead, blind and deaf children about. You know, when I was
at college we was handed some figures of - I think it might have
been 1970 or something - of how many had died that year, how
many were blind and how many was deaf, compared to 2000.
And there was a dramatic difference and it was because of all the
immunisation. So I think probably they could do with using that
a bit more . . . to prove to them [parents] that it [immunisation]
is working’ “ (McMurray 2004).
Some parents found parental testimony to be the most relat-
able, impartial and trustworthy source of vaccination informa-
tion. However, they felt it was also prone to errors. Many believed
that this was because other parents were seen to have no hidden
agenda (Hilton 2007). This made these anecdotes carry as much
or more weight as other information sources including epidemi-
ological studies and health officials (Hilton 2007). Parents who
contributed to online blogs and forums were often seen to hold
more extreme views (Brown 2012).
Parents who were hesitant towards vaccination, had delayed vacci-
nating or had decided not to vaccinate recognised that the level of
information they wanted was higher and more detailed than what
was normally given (Gust 2008; Brown 2012).
Finding 34: A varied presentation of information (written,
oral and visual) is necessary to meet parents’ vaccination
information needs (low confidence).
Table 41
Parents indicated that they wanted vaccination information pre-
sented in different formats (written, oral and visual) to meet their
needs (Miller 2008). Some parents preferred more oral informa-
tion, to complement the leaflets they received, as they found it
easier to remember (Harmsen 2015). Modalities of mHealth in-
terventions, such as text messages, also fit well with parents’ ev-
eryday lives (Brown 2014).
” ’It’s my source of communication [texting], I don’t read handouts
or pamphlets’ “ (Brown 2014).
One study pre-tested a vaccination pamphlet with parents and
collected information about the presentation of the information
(Gust 2008). They found that some mothers did not like specific
information or graphic photos about a vaccine-preventable disease
as these were seen as ’scare tactics’. However, other mothers saw
the photos as helpful. They liked the use of statistics as they saw
this as respecting their intelligence. They wanted the information
in the pamphlet to be detailed and include the names of vaccines,
how they are tested and what the risks are. They felt that it was
important to give information on who had produced the pam-
phlet, as the source could influence their trust in the information.
Finally, they felt that information should be less biased towards
immunisations, not condescending to parents, not appearing to
judge parents who question immunisations and presenting ’all the
facts’ to allow parents to make their own informed decision (Gust
2008).
Finding 35: Parents wanted specific information about
vaccination and found some of the available information to
be too general or incomplete. Parents wanted more
information than they received about topics including:
combined versus single vaccines, technical information
about production and delivery, the vaccination appointment,
the vaccination schedule, vaccine ingredients and safety,
vaccination in general and vaccine-preventable diseases,
vaccine side effects, and the risks and benefits of vaccines
(high confidence)
Table 42
Parents thought that available information was too general or
incomplete, and they wanted additional details (Bond 1998;
Berhanel 2000; Guillaume 2004; McMurray 2004; Shui 2005;
Benin 2006; Fowler 2007; Topuzo lu 2007; Gust 2008; Miller
2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Bond 2011; Brown 2012;
Harmsen 2012; Hussain 2012; Tomlinson 2013; Brown 2014;
Delkhosh 2014; Kitayama 2014; Barbieri 2015; Brunson 2015;
Fadda 2015; Harmsen 2015; Saada 2015; Blaisdell 2016; Dube
2016; Sobo 2016). For example, some parents wanted information
to distinguish between vaccines (Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Saada
2015).
” ’To me they are all the same and they can’t be? Some are perhaps
really important, and for me that would have been the next step
in knowing what I have to read up on. It might be that you can
drop some of them, but then I know that I have to sit down and
spend my summer holidays to understand what this is. But if,
for example (the evidence is conclusive), then I can just read a
little bit one evening and make a quick decision to vaccinate’ “
(Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010).
Parents felt that the information they were receiving about vacci-
nation was not comprehensive and did not provide the whole story
(Bond 1998; Bond 2011). They felt that specific content that they
wanted to know more about was missing. Public debate in the
media made them feel that information was being withheld from
the public (Bond 1998; Bond 2011). Parents were also frustrated
by what they saw as an absence of information about vaccination
(Brown 2012), or they perceived a lack of a complete explanation
from their healthcare provider (Gust 2008; Brunson 2015).
Some parents also wanted very specific information about the
MMR vaccine. In the UK this was strongly linked to the MMR
vaccine scare (Guillaume 2004; Fadda 2015). They were especially
concerned about why it had to be given in a combined form and
what the ingredients of the vaccine were (Guillaume 2004).
Parents wanted specific advice supported by evidence and rationale
(Brown 2012), and they wanted more information about various
aspects of vaccination.

qualitative evidence (Review)

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Finding 36: Parental misconceptions about vaccination were
sometimes based on information that they had received
from health workers (moderate confidence).
Table 43
Some studies found that parental misconceptions about vaccina-
tion were sometimes rooted in information they had received from
health workers (Bond 1998; Berhanel 2000; Hussain 2012; Fadda
2015; Blaisdell 2016; Dube 2016).
In two cases (Berhanel 2000; Hussain 2012), both in LMIC
settings, parents reported receiving misinformation from health
workers, and their misconceptions about vaccination had devel-
oped due to this misinformation. This is important in a context
where health workers are the main source of information for par-
ents, and access to other information sources is difficult.
”Though the presence of medical interns helped, members of the
vaccination team were observed sometimes providing dubious eti-
ological explanations to the families: telling them that polio was
’special’ and needed a constant boost which other vaccines did
not“ (Hussain 2012).
In high-income settings, four studies found that some mothers
appeared to be unaware of the importance of vaccination or of
following the vaccination calendar, and their healthcare provider
had reinforced this belief (Bond 1998; Fadda 2015; Blaisdell 2016;
Dube 2016).
”These mothers appeared to be unaware of the need for age ap-
propriate vaccines and this was reinforced by their doctors who
were: ’Not really fussed . . . as long as she gets them, he doesn’t
care when, as long as she gets immunised’ “ (Bond 1998).
Some allopathic providers were advising against vaccination
(Fadda 2015).
” ’The paediatrician has advised me against MMR. He told me he
is not really in favor of vaccinations. But I decided I will do it. I
have decided to go against the tide!’ “ (Fadda 2015).
In other cases, parents had clearly received misinformation from
alternative healthcare providers (Fadda 2015; Dube 2016).
” ’One way or the other, when my homeopath tells me that my
daughter is going to have cancer, because it looks like we are going
to get cancer from being vaccinated or my family doctor, well my
family doctor doesn’t do that, or other people or the government
tell me that people are still dying because there weren’t vaccinated
. . . all that, for me, one side or the other, I really have a problem
with that and that’s why I haven’t made a decision yet, I have a
hard time accepting that information’ “ (Dube 2016).
The relationship between vaccination information
and vaccination decisions
Summary of qualitative findings table (Table 44).
Finding 37: Some parents vaccinated their child because
they felt that it was a cultural and social norm and not
necessarily a decision that they had to make (high
confidence).
Table 45
Many studies found that parents saw vaccination as an obvious
choice, a cultural and social norm and not necessarily a deci-
sion that they had to make (Bond 1998; Berhanel 2000; Benin
2006; Tickner 2007; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Brunson 2013;
Barbieri 2015; Brunson 2015; Fadda 2015; Harmsen 2015; Sobo
2016). These parents assumed that the benefits of vaccinating their
child outweighed any possible risk, and they seldom asked ques-
tions during vaccination appointments (Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010;
Barbieri 2015). They accepted immunisation as part of a pro-
gramme to be followed (Berhanel 2000; Tickner 2007). Not all
parents realised that they had a choice to vaccinate (Miller 2008).
Finding 38: Many parents, regardless of their vaccination
decision, believed that their decision had not been
adequately informed (moderate confidence).
Table 46
Many parents did not feel that they had been able to make an
informed decision about vaccination (Bond 1998; Evans 2001;
Guillaume 2004; McMurray 2004; Shui 2005; Fowler 2007;
Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Delkhosh 2014; Harmsen 2015; Dube
2016). Parents often felt that their decision to vaccinate did not
reflect an informed choice (Bond 1998; McMurray 2004; Fowler
2007; Dube 2016). Some had a low level of confidence in their
decision as they felt they were missing crucial information about,
for example, the diseases being vaccinated against and the risks
and benefits of the vaccines (Evans 2001; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010;
Delkhosh 2014; Harmsen 2015).
”Although parents were generally well informed about immuni-
sation, they reported that inadequate information had hampered
their decision-making process: ’But that’s very confusing isn’t it,
as a parent because you obviously want the best for your child and
when you see all these reports . . . and you’re trying to look at it
and make an educated decision . . . I think just basically there’s a
complete lack of information . . . I think there needs to be some-
thing a bit sort of totally universal that everyone can sort of get
their hands on and that’s independent ’cause I think people are
just either way polarised’ “ (Evans 2001).
Thislowlevel of confidence wasdue toreliance oneverydayknowl-
edge paired with limited time to interact with the health services
(McMurray 2004; Delkhosh 2014). In addition, parents reported
that the information available was neither convincing nor compre-
hensive (Bond 1998), that they did not receive enough informa-
tion (Shui 2005; Fowler 2007), or that they did not have enough
time (or any time at all) to look at the information before the
appointment (McMurray 2004; Fowler 2007).
”Focus groups in Kazakhstan expressed that there was not enough
information to help parents make a good decision about vacci-
nating a child, and that this lack of information reinforced their

 concerns: ’We would like to have information before vaccination.
There is not enough information . . . therefore there occur doubts
[regarding vaccination]’ “(Fowler 2007).
Finding 39: Some parents who had vaccinated their children
were unsure, regretted or worried about their decision due
to a perceived lack of information (high confidence).
Table 47
Some studies found that even parents who had vaccinated wor-
ried about their decision because they felt they lacked information
(Bond 1998; Guillaume 2004; Shui 2005; Fowler 2007; Austin
2008, Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Tomlinson 2013; Delkhosh 2014;
Fadda 2015; Dube 2016). Parents who felt unknowledgeable
about vaccination were less confident in their decision and ex-
pressed uncertainty over their choice (Guillaume 2004; Shui 2005;
Fowler 2007; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Delkhosh 2014; Fadda
2015). Some parents said these worries were triggered by me-
dia debates where they felt information was being withheld from
the public (Bond 1998). Some studies found that even if par-
ents had made the decision to vaccinate they worried about the
decision they had made (Evans 2001; Guillaume 2004; Tickner
2007; Austin 2008; Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Tickner 2010; Dube
2016). Other parents worried about or second guessed their de-
cision because they did not trust the information from the gov-
ernment (Austin 2008; Dube 2016), they lacked information
about the diseases that were being vaccinated against and how
vaccination worked (Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Tomlinson 2013;
Delkhosh 2014), they worried that their choice not to vaccinate
would affect follow-up care at health services (Austvoll-Dahlgren
2010), or they were not provided with information about why they
had to take a combined vaccine instead of singles (Evans 2001).
Finding 40: Health workers were used to supporting and
minimising the complexity of vaccination decisions and
ameliorating or sharing any regret parents felt about
deciding to vaccinate (low confidence).
Table 48
Health workers had various roles, many of which were complex,
when interacting with parents about vaccination. Some parents
used them as a support when they were in doubt about their deci-
sion (Austvoll-Dahlgren 2010; Blaisdell 2016). Others used them
to ameliorate any regret they felt in their decision to vaccinate, as
this had been shared with a health worker (Brown 2012; Fadda
2015).
Trusting a health worker minimised the complexity of influences
on the decision to vaccinate, allowed parents to limit their infor-
mation searching and made them feel that they were sharing the
decision to vaccinate with an expert (Brown 2012; Fadda 2015).
”MMR1-accepting parents used trust in their health professionals
both to minimise the complexity of influences on their decision
by reducing the need to seek and evaluate alternative sources of
advice, and to minimise anticipated regret by ’sharing’ the decision
(therefore the blame for any negative outcomes) with an expert:
’If something went wrong with the vaccine at least I listened to,
I read all the information, listened to someone that knows a lot
more than I do and if that was meant to be then I feel that was
meant to be but I wouldn’t want to take all the responsibility on
myself by choosing not to vaccinate my children’ “ (Brown 2012).
Finding 41: Some parents vaccinated their children because
they trusted their health worker or because the health
worker was helpful, asked, or recommended for them to do
so (moderate confidence).
Table 49
Health workers are one of a variety of sources for parents of infor-
mation about vaccination (see previous findings). Because of their
important role, health workers held some influence over a par-
ent’s decision to vaccinate. In some instances parents accepted vac-
cines because the health worker was helpful, asked them to or rec-
ommended them (Berhanel 2000; McMurray 2004; Benin 2006;
Tickner 2007; Henderson 2008; Tadesse 2009; Austvoll-Dahlgren
2010; Tickner 2010; Brunson 2013; Tomlinson 2013; Delkhosh
2014; Barbieri 2015; Fadda 2015; Harmsen 2015; Kowal 2015;
Blaisdell 2016; Sobo 2016).
” ’Me myself I the three kids I give them the immunisation, I give
them the MMR . . . but I think it’s good to . . . in all in altogether
it’s very important to give them the immunisation whatever it is .
. . I have done some researches on the Internet and I read about
it but still nothing convince me that it is er one of the side-effects
of the MMR that is going to lead to an autism . . . I talk with
the health visitor that I told her like that I don’t want to give her
now, maybe year later or six months later or so. She say me it’s
up to you but I’m advising you to give her you don’t know what’s
gonna to happen during this month, maybe she’s going to catch
any diseases . . . I speak with my husband, we agree together . . .
let us do it’ “ (Tomlinson 2013).
Finding 42: Some parents vaccinated their children because
of perceived pressure from the health services (low
confidence).
Table 50
Some studies found that parents vaccinated their children because
of perceived pressure from the health services (Berhanel 2000;
Evans 2001; Topuzo lu 2007; Austin 2008; Figueiredo 2011;
Tomlinson 2013; Saada 2015).
” ’She thought like something that she must do . . . and because
she has received few letters from the GPs she thought well I don’t
have a choice I have to take my child now’ “ (Tomlinson 2013).
This pressure sometimes lead to parents feeling alienated and pa-
tronised. It also made parents who had decided not to vaccinate
feel guilty about their decision (Austin 2008; Saada 2015).

 ” ’I thought please, I don’t really want this done, and I knew for
some reason it just wasn’t right for him, but I went ahead because
the government said that this is what we should do and that makes
you feel so guilty’ “ (Austin 2008).
Others felt that the government was making decisions based on
what was best for society rather than what was best for an individ-
ual. Parents felt that their focus was to make a decision for their
individual child, independent of what was in line with govern-
ment policy or pressure from the health services to make decisions
based on what was best for society (Evans 2001).
” ’Sometimes the doctors and nurses at the surgery can be too
much you know, you must have it, you know? And that’s what
puts a lot of people’s backs up doesn’t it really, your choice is gone
a bit isn’t it?’ “ (Evans 2001).
Finding 43: Some parents who decided not to vaccinate
often felt that they had made a more informed decision than
parents who had vaccinated (very low confidence).
Table 51
One study found that non-vaccinators thought they had made a
more informed decision than parents who had vaccinated (Brown
2012).
”ParentswhorejectedMMR1questionedthe extentto which most
parents taking their course of action really understand the issues
around their decision (and felt that they were unusual in having
’good’ knowledge about or justification for rejection), whilst par-
ents who accepted MMR1 doubted not the knowledge of MMR
rejectors, but their motivation“ (Brown 2012).
Integrating the findings from this synthesis with the
findings of relevant Cochrane effectiveness reviews
The matrix (see Table 52) shows that most of the interventions in
the trials communicated information before the vaccination ap-
pointment. Some trials also provided information in more than
one setting; attempted to tailor information to different parents
(i.e. based on level of literacy); engaged health workers to help par-
ents make appointments; and attempted to provide clear, simple
and unbiased information. None of the interventions appeared to
address parental perceptions of health worker motives or clearly
stated that the vaccination information that was given had been
developed to respond to a rumour or negative stories in the media.
This matrix provides a useful overview of the how the findings of
this synthesis of qualitative evidence are reflected in the content
of the interventions in the trials included in the related Cochrane
effectiveness reviews.
D I S C U S S I O N
Summary of main results
In summary, parents perceived information and communication
about vaccination to be important. They wanted to receive infor-
mation in good time before each vaccination appointment and not
while their child was being vaccinated. They wanted information
about vaccination to be available at a wide variety of locations and
help from health workers in locating relevant information. Parents
wanted health workers to have open, respectful discussions with
them in a caring, sensitive and non-judgemental way, give clear
answers to their questions, and provide a supportive environment
for decision-making. They expected them to have the best interests
of their child at heart and not be driven by financial incentives.
In general, parents found the amount of information they received
to be inadequate. The amount of information parents would like
to receive appears to be linked to their acceptance of vaccination.
Parents generally found it difficult to know which vaccination in-
formationsource totrust. Theirperceptionsof trustworthysources
depended on their perceptions of vaccination. They also found it
difficult to find information that they felt was impartial and bal-
anced. Parents wanted to receive specific, balanced information,
communicated in a clear and simple manner, and in a language
they understood about both the benefits and harms of vaccina-
tion. Parents wanted information that was relatable and tailored
to their situation, including their attitudes towards vaccination.
They wanted information to be presented in a variety of ways in-
cluding through mHealth interventions such as text messaging.
Many parents, regardless of their attitudes towards vaccination,
believed that their decision to vaccinate had been inadequately in-
formed. This could cause worry and regret about their vaccination
decision.
Summary of integrating the findings from this
synthesis with the findings of relevant Cochrane
effectiveness reviews
Our comparison of the findings of the qualitative evidence synthe-
sis and effectiveness reviews shows that most of the trial interven-
tions addressed at least one to two key aspects of communication
identified as important in the qualitative evidence synthesis, in-
cluding offering information before the vaccination appointment
and tailoring information to parents’ needs. None of the inter-
ventions appeared to respond to negative media stories or address
parental perceptions of health worker motives.
The matrix table presented in Table 52 could inform the develop-
ment of future trial interventions and trial subgroup analyses. This
qualitative review could help suggest ways of grouping future trials
for planned subgroup analyses in the reviews of effectiveness, for
instance according to differences in the setting or the population,
or because of nuances in the interventions. In addition, this qual-
itative review could help explain why certain interventions appear
to be more effective than others by providing insight into parental

Cochrane Collaboration.
 perceptions and preferences surrounding vaccination information.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The sampling approach we used in this review (see above) was
geared towards achieving a maximum variation of setting, vaccines
and populations, but it is still possible that we omitted findings
relevant to particular populations, communication strategies, set-
tings and experiences.
All of the studies we included explored parental perceptions of
vaccination information. A few included informal caregivers such
as grandmothers in their sample but did not distinguish between
participant groups when reporting findings. Furthermore, most
studies only identified participants as parents. Some studies in-
cluded a description of the parents such as young, old, vaccine-
hesitant, acceptor, refuser, minority group, etc. Some studies in-
cluded fathers but none focused on fathers only. It is therefore
uncertain whether informal caregivers or fathers have the same
perspectives on and perceived need for vaccination information.
Most studies in this review are from high-income urban settings.
It is unclear what impact this has had on the overall complete-
ness of the evidence, as experiences and perceptions of vaccination
are context- and programme-specific. However, poorly resourced
healthcare systems may have similar financial and organisational
challenges that could influence the delivery, expectations and ex-
periences around communication strategies.
Some of the included articles, from the UK and Switzerland, fo-
cused on the MMR vaccine and parental concerns about this par-
ticular vaccine and its safety. The MMR vaccine was particularly
controversial in many settings, with widespread concern about the
potential for adverse effects following the publication of a now dis-
credited paper on this topic (Godlee 2011). Several of our findings
rely heavily on findings from these MMR studies, which are from
a specific context and time and are specific to parental thoughts
about the MMR vaccine. It is possible that parents’ experiences
of communication strategies were different in settings where this
controversy was well known to the public, compared to settings
where it was not.
We have attempted to address concerns about the applicability
and completeness of the primary study data contributing to each
finding in our CERQual assessment of relevance and data ade-
quacy for each finding. We have reported these assessments in the
CERQual evidence profiles (Tables 4-6, 8-10, 12, 13, 15-34, 36-
43, 45-51).
The methods used in the included studies may in some cases limit
the applicability and completeness of the data reported. All of
the included studies made use of individual or group interviews
and focus group discussions as their main method of data collec-
tion. None used long-term ethnographic methods, and only a few
employed any form of observation. While interviews and focus
groups allow researchers to collect data on what people say, ob-
servational methods also allow researchers to collect data on what
people do. This would have been appropriate for understanding
how information is communicated to parents in various settings
and how parents themselves search for information about vaccina-
tion. Interviews and focus group discussions seem to be the most
commonly used research methods amongst qualitative researchers
exploring issues related to health. This could be because they are
less time-consuming than longer term ethnographic methods. We
also assessed most of the included studies to have poorly reported
one or more methodological domains, related to context, sam-
pling and/or data collection methods. In addition, very few dis-
cussed researcher reflexivity. We have attempted to assess any con-
cerns about the methodological limitations of the primary studies
that contributed evidence to an individual review finding in our
CERQual assessment of each finding.
Within the CERQual approach, we defined confidence in the evi-
dence as an assessment of the extent to which a synthesis finding is
a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. As this
assessment communicates the extent to which the research find-
ing is likely to be substantially different from the phenomenon of
interest, the assessments provide a broad indication of the applica-
bility of the evidence (Lewin 2015). Additional factors that users
of these findings might consider in assessing whether our findings
are likely to be applicable to their setting include the following (
Lavis 2009; Burford 2013).
• Whether the studies contributing evidence took place in
similar settings to those where the findings will be applied.
• Whether there are important differences in political, social,
or cultural factors, in populations or in other social factors that
might have substantial impacts on information needs, on how
information is delivered or received, or might substantially alter
the feasibility and acceptability of different communication
interventions, compared to the sites in which the studies were
done. For example, if communication is being designed for
settings in which there are high levels of distrust of mass media
or where health service users do not feel comfortable posing
questions to health workers.
• Whether there are important differences in health system
arrangements that may mean that certain forms of
communication about childhood vaccinations, or particular
kinds of content, could not be delivered in the same way as in
the sites in which the studies were conducted. For example, if
there are not sufficient resources available to share information
about vaccination in advance of vaccination appointments.
Confidence in the findings
Based on our CERQual assessments, the findings range from very
low to high confidence. The main reasons for downgrading for
methodological limitations were poor reporting of context, sam-
pling or methods as well as lack of researcher reflexivity.

qualitative evidence (Review)

Cochrane Collaboration.
 We typically downgraded a finding for concerns about coherence
when some of the data from the included studies contradicted the
review finding or when it was not clear if some of the underly-
ing data supported the review finding. Downgrading due to data
adequacy occurred when we had concerns about the richness or
quantity of the data supporting a review finding. We downgraded
findings because of concerns about relevance in cases where the
setting or vaccine was only partially relevant. For example, if there
was a focus on the MMR vaccine specifically in the contributing
studies or if all of the studies contributing to a finding came from
northern European settings.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The findings from this qualitative evidence synthesis have com-
monalities with findings from other qualitative and mixed-meth-
ods reviews of vaccination and parental decision support needs
(Jackson 2008; Brown 2010; Carlsen 2016), but none had the
same focus as this review. These reviews focused on the swine flu
vaccine specifically (Carlsen 2016), the MMR vaccine in high-
income contexts specifically (Brown 2010), and child health deci-
sions in general (Jackson 2008).
Similarly to our findings, two of these reviews mention that par-
ents were unhappy with the timing of information and wanted in-
formation ahead of their appointment in order to formulate ques-
tions and have an informed discussion with their health worker
(Jackson 2008; Brown 2010). As in our review, parents in these re-
views also wanted health workers to help them locate good sources
of information, have open and long discussions about vaccination,
allow parents to have viewpoints different from theirs without be-
coming judgemental, and reiterate that a refusal or delay of vacci-
nation would not affect their relationship with the health worker
or the health care system (Jackson 2008; Brown 2010). One of the
reviews also reported that parents did not like feeling pressured by
the health system into making a decision that they felt was not
informed and that they might regret later on (Jackson 2008).
As with our findings, these reviews also reported that, overall,
health workers were a trusted source of information for most par-
ents, but there was also a perception from some that the health
workers had conflicts of interest due to financial incentives or were
unable to discuss vaccinations openly with parents as they had to
stick to the official message (Jackson 2008; Brown 2010; Carlsen
2016). Some parents felt this lack of credibility extended to official
government information and information from pharmaceutical
companies (Jackson 2008; Brown 2010).
Similarly to parents in our findings, parents in these reviews found
health information to be complex, sometimes difficult to under-
stand and difficult to access. They wanted information to be tai-
loredtotheirsituation,presentedinaclearandsimple manner, and
balanced (considering both the risks and benefits of vaccination).
They also wanted the opportunity to discuss this information both
with health workersandoutside of the healthcare setting,forexam-
ple in parents’ groups (Jackson 2008; Brown 2010). Presentation
of the information in a variety of formats was also seen as helping
to increase people’s understanding of content (Jackson 2008). In
contrast, inconsistent or contradictory information from different
sources, such as the media and health workers, led to confusion
and concern and to parents having doubts about the information
provided (Brown 2010; Carlsen 2016).
Reflexivity
Reflexivity discussions in the included articles
Childhood immunisation is often a contentious topic, and the
included papers point to issues of distrust between health author-
ities and members of the public, as well as people’s perceptions
of vaccination as a social or moral obligation. When carrying out
future research on vaccination beliefs and behaviour, it is therefore
relevant to consider how parents perceive these studies, as this may
influence their willingness to participate as well as their responses.
For instance, studies that use health professionals to recruit par-
ticipants or to carry out interviews are unlikely to be perceived
as ’neutral’ on the topic of childhood vaccination. For many of
the included studies, however, it was not possible to determine
the backgrounds of the people recruiting participants or collect-
ing data. Where this information was offered, a number of studies
used health professionals or government employees to carry out
the tasks. The researchers’ own perspectives of vaccination can also
influence the manner in which they collect and analyse data on
this topic. However, very few of the studies discussed these issues;
an issue that was also highlighted in the swine flu review referred
to above (Carlsen 2016).
Reflexivity within the review author team
In keeping with quality standards for reflexivity within qualitative
research, as review authors we reflected on our own backgrounds
and positions, and how these may have affected our choice of re-
view topic; the manner in which we collected, analysed and in-
terpreted the data; and, in turn, how the emerging findings from
the synthesis influenced those views and opinions. All of the au-
thors are social scientists: HA and CG are social anthropologists by
training and SL is a physician with training in qualitative research
methods. All of us are employed by the Norwegian Public Health
Institute, and while we support informed, individual decisions,
we also have a public health perspective. We regard adherence to
the currently recommended vaccines as a vital public health mea-
sure. We are also of the view that it is important for parents and
informal caregivers to receive information about childhood vac-
cination. Had we, for instance, had a more vaccine-hesitant per-
spective or placed greater emphasis on individual choice, this may

 have influenced the manner in which we interpreted the data or
the implications for practice we drew.
A U T H O R S ’
C O N C L U S I O N S
Implications for practice
The following questions, derived from our findings, may help
programme managers and other stakeholders to assess whether
the vaccination communication interventions they are planning
adequately address the issues that are important to parents and
informal caregivers.
1. Is vaccination information communicated to parents in
good time before vaccine delivery and decision-making about
vaccination, in a context where parents have time to consider the
information and come to a decision?
2. Is information about vaccination available at a wide range
of health service and community settings? Is it possible for
parents to have discussions in these settings about vaccination?
3. Is information about vaccination adapted to the needs of
each family? For instance, vaccine-hesitant parents may need
different types and amounts of information than vaccine
acceptors.
4. Do health workers provide parents with and help them find
neutral vaccination information tailored to their needs? Do they
have open, respectful discussions with parents in a caring,
sensitive and non-judgemental way? Give clear answers to
parents’ questions? Provide a supportive environment for
decision-making?
5. Are health workers perceived by parents, informal caregivers
and other stakeholders as being driven primarily by the best
interests of the child or are they perceived as being driven by
other motives, such as financial gain?
6. Do parents perceive the vaccination information they
receive as impartial, balanced, independent and transparent?
7. Is vaccination information communicated to parents in a
clear and simple manner and in a variety of formats?
8. Are vaccination communication strategies adjusted to
respond to media stories, rumours, and negative publicity about
vaccination in order to respond to parental questions and
concerns that these stories may have raised?
Implications for research
These implications have been derived from the CERQual assess-
ment and the overview of the studies included in this review.
There is a need for better reporting of context, sampling, methods
and researcher reflexivity in qualitative studies. Future qualitative
studies should report their methods clearly and include reflection
on the researchers’ roles in the study and how this may have im-
pacted on the process and findings of the study. More detail con-
cerning setting and participants is also needed to identify under-
lying cultural or social phenomena (shared values or beliefs) that
mediate the influence of communications and should therefore be
addressed when designing vaccination communication interven-
tions.
Research about parental perceptions of vaccination information
needs to include a broader spectrum of contexts. In particular,
more studies are needed in LMIC settings and in rural settings in
HICs.
More research is needed on parental preferences around the details
of timing,amountandcontentof vaccination information in order
to help tailor vaccination information to individuals and groups
in communities.
Future qualitative studies on vaccination information should con-
sider the perceptions of informal caregivers and fathers in order to
understand the viewpoints of all of the people involved in mak-
ing decisions about a child’s health.They should also explore why
some communication strategies do or do not influence parents’
and informal caregivers’ decisions about routine childhood vacci-
nation.
Future trials of vaccination communication should offer better
descriptionsof the communicationinterventionsusedin the study,
including the training received by those delivering the vaccination
information and how the information was developed and pre-
tested. More detailed descriptions of home visits and discussions
between health workers and parents/informal caregivers are also
needed.

1. Has information been communicated to parents before the vaccination appointment?
2. Has the information been provided in more than one setting, including settings outside of the health centre? Has an opportunity
for discussion about the vaccination information been offered?
3. Has an attempt been made to tailor the information to a particular audience?
4. Has an attempt been made to ensure that health workers are helpful, caring and willing to have open, non-judgemental
discussions with parents about their questions and concerns regarding vaccination?
5. Are health workers perceived by parents, informal caregivers and other stakeholders as being driven primarily by the best
interests of the child or are they perceived as being driven by other motives, such as financial gain?
6. Has an attempt been made to provide parents with information they perceive as impartial, balanced and unbiased?
7. Has an attempt been made to communicate vaccination information in a clear and simple way and present it in a variety of
formats?
8. Did the information provided try to address ongoing media stories or rumours about vaccination so as to address parents’
current questions and concerns?
