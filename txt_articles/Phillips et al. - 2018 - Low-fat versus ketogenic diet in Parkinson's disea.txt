ABSTRACT: Background: Preliminary evidence sug-
gests that diet manipulation may influence motor and
nonmotor symptoms in PD, but conflict exists regarding
the ideal fat to carbohydrate ratio.
Objectives: We designed a pilot randomized, controlled
trial to compare the plausibility, safety, and efficacy of a
low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet versus a ketogenic diet in
a hospital clinic of PD patients.
Methods: We developed a protocol to support PD
patients in a diet study and randomly assigned patients
to a low-fat or ketogenic diet. Primary outcomes were
within- and between-group changes in MDS-UPDRS
Parts 1 to 4 over 8 weeks.
Results: We randomized 47 patients, of which 44 com-
menced the diets and 38 completed the study (86%
completion rate for patients commencing the diets). The
ketogenic diet group maintained physiological ketosis.
Both groups significantly decreased their MDS-UPDRS
scores, but the ketogenic group decreased more in Part
1 (−4.58 � 2.17 points, representing a 41% improve-
ment in baseline Part 1 scores) compared to the low-fat
group
(−0.99 � 3.63
points,
representing
an
11%
improvement) (P < 0.001), with the largest between-group
decreases observed for urinary problems, pain and other
sensations, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and cognitive
impairment. There were no between-group differences in
the magnitude of decrease for Parts 2 to 4. The most
common adverse effects were excessive hunger in the
low-fat group and intermittent exacerbation of the PD
tremor and/or rigidity in the ketogenic group.
Conclusions: It is plausible and safe for PD patients to
maintain a low-fat or ketogenic diet for 8 weeks. Both
diet groups significantly improved in motor and nonmotor
symptoms;
however,
the
ketogenic
group
showed
greater improvements in nonmotor symptoms. © 2018

Many
new
therapies
for
Parkinson’s
disease
(PD) have emerged in recent decades, yet levodopa
remains the primary treatment for motor symptoms.
However, L-dopa is associated with the development of
motor fluctuations and dyskinesias,1 and it does not
adequately control many nonmotor symptoms,2 which
are often under-recognized yet ultimately more dis-
abling than motor symptoms.3–6 In this context, there
is growing interest in the largely unexplored, patient-
empowering approach of diet manipulation.7

 Preliminary evidence suggests that diet manipulation
may influence motor and nonmotor symptoms in PD,
yet conflict exists regarding the ideal fat to carbohy-
drate ratio.8 On one hand, a low-fat, high-carbohydrate
diet may ease the passage of the dopamine precursor,
tyrosine, into cerebrospinal fluid and/or trigger an
insulin-induced rise in brain dopamine.9,10 Moreover,
an increase in dietary fiber might enhance fermentation
of neuroactive short-chain fatty acids in the gut, which
could, theoretically, affect gut motility in PD.11,12 On
the other hand, defects in respiratory chain complex I
activity have been demonstrated in the substantia nigra
(SN) and frontal cortex of people with PD13,14; it has
been suggested that the ketones produced by a high-fat,
low-carbohydrate “ketogenic” diet may be able to cir-
cumvent this defect through a complex II–dependent
mechanism, thereby enhancing mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation in the brain.15 In addition, such a diet
may also enhance central and peripheral neuron energy
metabolism by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis.16
To date, only one study has examined the effects of a
ketogenic diet in PD.17 The 5 patients improved their
motor scores, but in addition to the small sample size,
the study was limited by a short duration of 4 weeks,
the consumption of only 8% protein, which likely
enhanced L-dopa bioavailability, and the lack of a con-
trol group such that a placebo effect may have contrib-
uted to the improved scores.
On this background, we designed this study to exam-
ine a general neurology hospital clinic of PD patients
with regard to the plausibility and safety of maintaining
a low-fat or ketogenic diet for 8 weeks, whether either
diet group significantly improved in motor and/or non-
motor symptoms, and whether one group showed
greater improvements compared to the other.
Patients and Methods
Overview
This was a single-phase, parallel-group (1:1 randomi-
zation) study conducted at Waikato Hospital in Hamil-
ton, New Zealand. Waikato Hospital is a tertiary
hospital serving the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions,
representing a combined population of 750,000 people.
The study was approved by local Ethics and Maori
Consultation Research Review Committees.
Screening
The study sought volunteers through advertisements in
local and national PD newsletters in late 2016, followed
by presentations at Parkinson’s New Zealand meetings
in Hamilton, Rotorua, and Tauranga in early 2017.
Prospective patients underwent a 2-hour screening visit
in April or May 2017 with the lead investigator, nutri-
tion specialist, and PD nurse specialist. The visit entailed
(1) a presentation of the study and diet plans, (2) a
demographic, medical, and social history, (3) Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), (4) data collection for
body mass index (BMI) and recommended calorie intake
calculations, and (5) written informed consent.
Eligible patients were aged 40 to 75 years with a diag-
nosis fulfilling the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain
Bank criteria, MoCA score > 20, BMI > 18.5, and were
able and willing to follow either diet plan. Exclusion cri-
teria were inability to speak or understand English, H &
Y stages 0 or 5, or a medical, psychiatric, or substance
abuse condition that in the opinion of the investigators
would make it difficult to complete the study.
Patients were instructed to eat their usual, nonmodi-
fied diets from the screening visit to the start of the diet
intervention and to take their L-dopa at least 1 hour
before or after any meal from the screening visit to the
end of the intervention.
Procedure
Patients engaged in the 8-week diet intervention from
June 26 to August 18, 2017. Four 1-hour clinical visits
were scheduled: two baseline visits over the 2 consecu-
tive weeks immediately preceding the diet intervention
(while on usual diet), followed by visits in weeks 4 and
8 after commencing the diet intervention.
Patients were instructed to take their medications at
the same time before each visit, which involved an Inter-
national Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society
UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS) assessment by a diet-blinded neu-
rologist certified by the MDS.18 It was strictly forbidden
for either patient or neurologist to discuss any aspect of
diet
during
the
assessments.
Patients
were
always
assessed by the same neurologist, on the same weekday,
at the same time of day. Each visit also included body
weight measurements and blood tests for glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1C), triglycerides, high-density lipo-
protein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cho-
lesterol, urate, and C-reactive protein (CRP).
At the first baseline clinical visit, patients received a
blood glucose and ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate) monitor
(Freestyle Neo; Abbott Diabetes Care, Whitney, UK) and
finger prick training.19 After the first baseline visit but
before the second visit, patients were randomized (1:1
allocation) to a low-fat or ketogenic diet plan using an
online randomization generator.20 To avoid selection bias,
all patients were randomized simultaneously, stratified by
recommended calorie intake (<2,000, 2,000-2,500, and
>2,500 kcal per day, block size of two). Randomization
was generated by the lead investigator, witnessed by the
PD nurse specialist, and signed and dated by both.
Patients received their randomized plan at the second
baseline visit and commenced the plan at the start of the
following week, returning for repeat clinical visits in
weeks 4 and 8 after commencing the plan.

 Both 4-week diet plans included weekly shopping lists
containing ingredients readily available at local super-
markets, daily set menus with space to tick the comple-
tion of each meal as well as record daily (bedtime)
blood glucose and ketone levels, and simple recipes (for
diet plan details, see the Supplementary Appendix). The
low-fat plan provided 1,750 kcal per day composed of
42 g of fat (10 g saturated), 75 g of protein, 246 g net
carbohydrate, and 33 g of fiber, and for those with
higher energy needs, ad libitum “calorie-booster” rec-
ipes each providing on average 500 extra kcal com-
posed of 4 g of fat (1 g saturated), 6 g of protein,
102 g net carbohydrate, and 13 g of fiber. The keto-
genic plan provided 1,750 kcal per day composed of
152 g of fat (67 g saturated), 75 g of protein, 16 g net
carbohydrate, and 11 g of fiber, with each calorie-
booster recipe providing on average 500 extra kcal
composed of 50 g of fat (22 g saturated), 6 g of pro-
tein, 5 g net carbohydrate, and 4 g of fiber.
Regular support and education sessions were pro-
vided. The lead investigator and nutrition specialist sent
global e-mails to all patients every second day and
filmed and posted 10-minute videos on the study’s web-
site every weekend. Both diets were equally presented
as potentially conferring health benefits, and both
groups were consistently reminded to eat until satiated.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
Primary outcomes were within- and between-group
changes in MDS-UPDRS Parts 1 to 4 from the mean of
the two baseline clinical visits to week 8 after com-
mencing the diet intervention. Secondary outcomes
were within- and between-group changes in metabolic
parameters, including weight, BMI, HbA1C, triglycer-
ides, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, urate, and CRP.
Statistical Analysis
Sample-size calculations were based on previous studies
showing the smallest clinically meaningful MDS-UPDRS
score improvement to be −2.64 points in Part 1, −3.05
points in Part 2, and −3.25 points in Part 321,22; to our
knowledge, a clinically meaningful change in Part 4 has
not been determined. To obtain 80% power using a sig-
nificance level of 0.05, we calculated that 32 patients
(16 per diet group) would detect a Part 1 change of
2.64 ± 2.64 points and/or Part 2 change of 3.05 ± 3.05
points and/or Part 3 change of 3.25 ± 3.25 points. Given
that previous studies involving ketogenic diets in adults
show an average dropout rate of 40% to 50% over 3 to
12 months,23 we aimed to recruit 40 to 60 patients.
Given the finite sample size and pre-study uncertainty
as to whether data would be normally distributed or
not, all outcomes were analyzed using nonparametric
tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank test for within-group com-
parisons, Mann-Whitney U test for between-group
comparisons). Statistical tests were two-tailed and used
a significance level of 5%. All data are presented as
mean ± standard deviation unless stated otherwise.
We analyzed primary and secondary outcomes using
data from all randomized patients, with missing data
imputed using regression imputation. To evaluate the
robustness of the primary outcome findings to various
imputation conditions, we additionally performed sensi-
tivity analyses on all primary outcomes using mean
imputation,
baseline
observation
carried
forward,
median imputation, and complete case analyses.
Results
Patient Flow and Baseline Characteristics
Details of patient flow, including all study exclusions
and withdrawals, are shown in Figure 1. We random-
ized 47 patients, of which 44 commenced the diets and
38 completed the study (86% completion rate for
patients commencing the diets); 6 patients withdrew for
reasons unrelated to the diets and 3 patients withdrew
as a result of diet-related difficulties. Randomized
patient baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.
There were no significant between-group differences in
any baseline characteristics.
Blood Glucose and Ketone Levels
Patient-monitored blood glucose and ketone levels are
shown in Figure 2. Over the 8-week diet intervention, the
two diet groups significantly differed in mean weekly bed-
time blood glucose (low-fat group: 6.28 ± 0.73 mmol/L
vs. ketogenic group: 5.70 ± 1.20 mmol/L; P = 0.001) and
ketone (0.16 ± 0.05 mmol/L vs. 1.15 ± 0.59 mmol/L;
P < 0.001) levels.
Changes in MDS-UPDRS Parts 1 to 4 and
Metabolic Parameters
We confirmed that patients in both diet groups took
their L-dopa at the same time before each visit by mea-
suring the time interval from the last clinically relevant
(taken within the previous 8 hours)
L-dopa dose to
MDS-UPDRS assessment, which did not significantly
differ between any two clinical visits within either
group (low-fat group: 128 ± 56 minutes at baseline,
126 ± 58 minutes in week 4, 131 ± 79 minutes in week
8, P > 0.05; ketogenic group: 93 ± 50 minutes at base-
line, 92 ± 61 minutes in week 4, 88 ± 51 minutes in
week 8, P > 0.05).
Changes in MDS-UPDRS Parts 1 to 4 are shown in
Table 2. Both diet groups significantly decreased in Part

group:

3 (P < 0.001 vs. P < 0.001); the low-fat group showed
no change in Part 4 (P = 0.13) whereas the ketogenic
group decreased in Part 4 (P = 0.005). The ketogenic

 group showed a larger magnitude of decrease in Part
1 (P < 0.001), with the largest between-group decreases
observed for urinary problems (–0.70 points differ-
ence), pain and other sensations (–0.64 points differ-
ence),
fatigue
(–0.50
points
difference),
daytime
sleepiness
(–0.45
points
difference),
and
cognitive
impairment (–0.27 points difference). There were no
between-group differences in the magnitude of decrease
for Part 2 (P = 0.11), Part 3 (P = 0.055), or Part
4 (P = 0.32). The within- and between-group compari-
sons of changes in Parts 1 to 4 remained similar, and
the statistical conclusions unchanged, in all four sensi-
tivity analyses (for details, see Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Changes in metabolic parameters are also shown in
Table 2. Both diet groups significantly decreased in
weight and BMI (P < 0.001 for all within-group com-
parisons), but there were no between-group differences
in the magnitude of weight loss (P = 0.55) or BMI
decrease (P = 0.30). The low-fat group did not change
in HbA1C (P = 0.92) whereas the ketogenic group
decreased in HbA1C (P = 0.032), although with the
exclusion of 1 outlier, a patient with type 1 diabetes
whose HbA1C decreased by –19.5 mmol/mol, the
magnitude
of
HbA1C
decrease
in
the
ketogenic
group lessened considerably (from –1.42 ± 4.12 mmol/
mol
to
–0.64 ± 1.49
mmol/mol).
There
were
no
between-group
differences
in
the
magnitude
of
change in HbA1C (P = 0.095). There were no within-
group
changes
in
triglycerides
(low-fat
group:
P = 0.19 vs. ketogenic group: P = 0.55), nor were
there any between-group differences (P = 0.46). The
low-fat group decreased in HDL (P = 0.027), LDL
(P < 0.001), total cholesterol (P < 0.001), and urate
(P = 0.004) whereas the ketogenic group increased in
HDL (P < 0.001), LDL (P < 0.001), total cholesterol
(P < 0.001),
and
urate
(P = 0.004),
with
notable
between-group
differences
observed
for
all
four
parameters (P < 0.001 for all between-group compari-
sons). There were no within-group changes in CRP
(P = 0.47 vs. P = 0.12), nor were there any between-
group differences (P = 0.10).

 Adverse Effects
Adverse effects are shown in Table 3. In the low-fat
diet group, the most common adverse effect was exces-
sive hunger, which occurred in 5 patients in weeks 1 to
4 and 6 patients in weeks 5 to 8. In the ketogenic group,
the most common adverse effect was exacerbated tremor
and/or rigidity, which occurred in 12 patients in weeks
1 to 4 and 7 patients in weeks 5 to 8.
Daily medication doses were altered in 6 patients. In
the low-fat diet group, 1 patient self-decreased L-dopa
attributed to improved motor symptoms and another
with
pre-existing
postural
hypotension
and
falls
required increased midodrine attributed to ongoing
falls.
In
the
ketogenic
group,
1
patient
required
decreased L-dopa and ropinirole attributed to agitation
(resolved),
another
required
decreased
pramipexole
attributed to visual hallucinations (resolved), another
required decreased
L-dopa, ropinirole, and apomor-
phine attributed to exacerbated dyskinesias (partially
resolved), and another with type 1 diabetes self-
decreased insulin attributed to improved blood glucose
control.
Discussion
We have shown, in a general neurology hospital
clinic of PD patients, that it is plausible and safe to

 maintain a low-fat or ketogenic diet for 8 weeks. Both
diet groups significantly improved in motor and non-
motor symptoms, but the ketogenic group showed
greater improvements in nonmotor symptoms. Adverse
effects were generally mild and differed between the
two groups.
Several study strengths should be highlighted. First, we
utilized a one-phase design, strictly enforced consistent
timing, diet-blinded neurologists, and the MDS-UPDRS
(a validated rating scale with high internal consistency
in measuring motor and nonmotor symptoms)18 to mini-
mize assessment bias. Second, our diet plans utilized rec-
ipe ingredients readily available at local supermarkets,
with an emphasis on affordability and palatability—thus,
we chose not to use regular supplements in either plan
(in particular, we chose not to supplement the ketogenic
diet with medium-chain triglyceride supplements, which
are not available at some supermarkets, are relatively

 costly, and can produce adverse gastrointestinal effects).
Third, protein intake was approximately 1 g per kg of
body weight per day within each diet group and equal
between groups; this is critical, given that low-protein
diets containing 0.5 to 0.8 g of protein per kg of body
weight per day enhance L-dopa absorption compared to
high-protein diets, which may improve motor symptoms
and exacerbate dyskinesias in some people with PD.24–26
Fourth, our protocol involved multimedia supports, such
as weekly educational videos, designed to mitigate the
patient losses traditionally associated with studies involv-
ing ketogenic diets in adults,23 which probably contrib-
uted to the low number of patient withdrawals attributed
to diet-related difficulties (3 patients).
Certain study weaknesses warrant mention. First, the
study population and duration were small; a larger
sample size or longer diet intervention would have
increased the statistical power or provided additional
time, either of which may have enabled the detection of
further significant differences between the diet groups.
Thus, our findings should be viewed as preliminary.
Second, there were 9 patient withdrawals; imputation
techniques were used to replace the missing data. To
assess the robustness of our primary outcome findings,
we additionally performed sensitivity analyses on all
primary outcomes using mean imputation, baseline
observation carried forward, median imputation, and
complete case analyses.
Patient adherence to each diet plan was monitored
directly and indirectly. Rather than use food diaries,
which may be perceived as burdensome,27 we directly
monitored diet adherence by simply ensuring that
patients ticked the day-to-day completion of each set
meal as they proceeded. Perhaps more important, we
indirectly monitored diet adherence by training patients
to self-monitor their daily blood glucose and ketone
levels throughout the study; we chose blood pinprick
testing as it is easier, more specific, and more accurately
reflects ketone levels compared to urine dipstick test-
ing.28 Using blood monitors, the low-fat diet group
measured negligible ketone levels, whereas the keto-
genic group demonstrated a mean weekly blood ketone
level of 1.15 ± 0.59 mmol/L consistent with a state of
physiological ketosis, a coordinated metabolic response
in which the liver provides ketones as an alternative,
fat-derived fuel source when body glucose reserves are
in short supply.29
Both diet groups significantly improved their MDS-
UPDRS scores over the 8-week diet intervention. It is
tempting to speculate that the low-fat diet increased
brain dopamine levels and/or gut short-chain fatty acid
production and that the ketogenic diet enhanced central
and peripheral neuron energy metabolism. However,
despite being reminded to eat until satiated, the average
patient in both groups lost 4 to 5 kg. It is well docu-
mented that overweight patients on unrestricted low-fat
and low-carbohydrate diets can still experience signifi-
cant weight loss, which may relate to altered levels of
energy-regulating
hormones
such
as
insulin.30,31
Although weight loss is often associated with a negative
impact on PD severity,32 a recent study has shown that
patients with metabolic syndrome experience greater
PD progression over time, mainly as a result of
increased motor scores, compared to patients without
metabolic syndrome.33 Given that the average patient
in both groups lost 4 to 5 kg, yet remained overweight
at week 8, the observed weight loss may have contrib-
uted to the improved motor scores in both groups. In
addition, the placebo effect may significantly impact
motor symptoms in PD patients.34,35 Since our protocol
included multimedia supports designed to mitigate
patient withdrawals, it is also possible that a placebo
effect contributed to the improved motor scores in both
groups. The potential effects of both weight loss and a
placebo effect must be kept in mind when interpreting
the within-group comparisons.
Both diet groups improved in Part 1 (nonmotor daily
living experiences), but the ketogenic group improved
more; every single patient in the ketogenic group
improved in Part 1, resulting in a substantial 41%
reduction in baseline Part 1 scores (as opposed to 11%
in the low-fat group) over the 8-week diet intervention.
The robustness of this between-group finding to various
imputation conditions was confirmed with multiple sen-
sitivity analyses, including the conservative baseline
observation carried forward method, which assumed

 that none of the 6 patient withdrawals from the keto-
genic group would have improved in Part 1 at all. This
is a potentially important finding, given that nonmotor
symptoms
ultimately
represent
the
most
disabling
aspect of PD—for example, depression alone may have
over twice the impact of motor symptoms on health.4
Moreover, nonmotor symptoms, such as urinary prob-
lems, pain, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and cognitive
impairment, are among those least responsive to
L-
dopa,2,36 yet these are the nonmotor symptoms that
improved the most in the ketogenic group compared to
the low-fat group in our study. Since the magnitude of
weight loss and BMI decrease were similar between
groups, and the protocol and assessments were applied
equally to both groups excepting the diets, neither
weight loss nor a placebo effect explains the between-
group differences in nonmotor symptom improvements.
Perhaps
unsurprisingly,
the
low-fat
diet
group
showed decreases, whereas the ketogenic group showed
increases, in HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and urate.
The health benefits of lower versus higher LDL and
total cholesterol in PD are debatable, with some studies
correlating higher LDL and total cholesterol levels with
a lower risk of PD.37,38 The association between urate
levels and PD is less controversial, with higher serum
urate
levels
predicting
a
slower
rate
of
PD
progression.39
Interestingly,
the
adverse
effect
profile
differed
between the two diet groups. The most common
adverse effect in the low-fat group was excessive hun-
ger. In contrast, the most common adverse effect in
the ketogenic group was an intermittent exacerbation
of the PD tremor and/or rigidity, which resulted in
2 patient withdrawals from this group at the end of
week 1. Although this adverse effect improved or
resolved in many patients in weeks 5 to 8, suggesting
that it was a largely transient phenomenon, it may still
have impacted the Part 3 (motor examination) scores
to some extent at week 8. We can only speculate as to
the reason the ketogenic diet exacerbated the PD
tremor and/or rigidity in some patients, but it is con-
ceivable that the abrupt increase in fat intake tempo-
rarily augmented dopamine depletion and/or oxidative
stress in the SN, followed by an adaptive response
over time.40
In conclusion, this pilot randomized, controlled trial
shows that modified diets based on readily available
ingredients, with normal protein levels, are plausible
and safe treatment approaches in PD, with the keto-
genic diet leading to greater improvements in many of
the more disabling, less
L-dopa-responsive nonmotor
symptoms. It is possible that a ketogenic diet could play
a complementary role alongside L-dopa in the treatment
of PD, but due to the preliminary nature of our find-
ings, larger and longer randomized, controlled studies
are needed before this can be stated with confidence.
