Abstract 
Purpose: To update the Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) Consensus Statement 
published in 2009 and provide guidance on use of Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) for 
Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI) in early-stage breast cancer, based on published evidence 
complemented by expert opinion.  
Methods and Materials: A systematic PubMed search using the same terms as the original 
Consensus Statement yielded 419 articles and 45 articles were selected. The authors synthesized 
the published evidence and, through a series of conference calls and emails, reached consensus 
regarding the recommendations.  
Results: The new recommendations include lowering the age in the “suitable”  group from 60 to 
50 years and in the ”cautionary” group to 40 years for patients who meet all other elements for 
“suitable.” Patients with low-risk DCIS, as per RTOG 9804 criteria, were categorized in the 
“suitable” group. The task force agreed to maintain the current criteria based on margin status. 
Recommendations for the use of IORT for breast cancer patients include: counseling patients 
regarding the higher risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) with IORT compared to 
whole breast irradiation; the need for prospective monitoring of long-term local control and 
toxicity with low-energy x-ray IORT given limited follow up; and restriction of IORT to women 
with invasive cancer considered “suitable.”   
Conclusion: These recommendations will provide updated clinical guidance regarding use of 
APBI for radiation oncologists and other specialists participating in the care of breast cancer 
patients.

Introduction:  
 
Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is a localized form of radiation delivered 
after lumpectomy to only the part of the breast where the tumor was removed. This procedure 
requires close collaboration between the surgeon and the radiation oncologist. When compared 
with whole breast irradiation (WBI), APBI offers several benefits, including reducing treatment 
time and sparing healthy tissue. Initial research indicates APBI can be as effective as WBI in 
terms of survival and controlling local recurrences in select patients. Recently, interest has also 
grown in intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), which treats the partial breast with a single 
dose of radiation using either low-energy x-rays or electrons, most commonly delivered at the 
time of surgery. 
 The ASTRO consensus statement on Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) was 
originally published in 2009.  The Board of Directors approved the proposal to partially update 
consensus statement in January 2015. This update addresses key question 1 from the original 
guideline: Which patients may be considered for APBI outside of a clinical trial? It also 
considers a new key question: Which patients may be considered for intraoperative partial breast 
irradiation?

KQ1: Which patients may be considered for APBI outside of a clinical trial? 
Age  
Recommendation Statements: 
A. Include age ≥50 years in the “suitable” group (moderate quality of evidence (MQE), 
recommendation rated as “Weak”, 100% Agreement). 
B. Patients who are aged 40-49 years and who meet all other elements of suitability are 
considered cautionary (lower quality of evidence (LQE), recommendation rated as 
“Weak”, 100% Agreement). 
C. Retain patients with age less than 40 years or those who are 40 – 49 years without 
meeting other elements of suitable in the “unsuitable” group (No evidence rating, 
recommendation rated as “Weak”, 100% Agreement). 
 
Three randomized trials evaluating APBI versus whole breast irradiation have been 
published or updated since the original ASTRO consensus statement. In the GEC-ESTRO trial, 
1184 patients were enrolled in a phase III, non-inferiority trial and were randomized to WBI plus 
a tumor bed boost or APBI delivered with multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy.1 The five-
year risk of IBTR was less than 2% in both treatment arms, and the study concluded that APBI 
was not inferior to WBI. In addition, there were no differences in toxicity through five years. The 
lower limit of age on the GEC-ESTRO trial was 40 years, and there was no evidence of 
increased risk of IBTR with APBI for women in their 40s. However, only 15% of women 
enrolled were < 50 years of age. In the National Institute of Oncology, Budapest trial in which 
128 received primarily multi-catheter brachytherapy APBI, 23% of patients were under the age 
of 50. In this trial, patients less than age 40 were excluded after 2001 due to an early analysis that

reported unacceptably high IBTR risk in these patients.2 At a median follow up of 10.2 years, 
5.5% had an in-breast recurrence, but no further analysis by age was done.3 In the University of 
Florence trial, the youngest patient enrolled was 40, and 18.5% of the 260 randomized to IMRT 
APBI were less than or equal to 50 years old. With a median follow up of 5 years, 1.5% had an 
in-breast recurrence and age was not a significant factor associated with recurrence.4 In each 
trial, roughly 90% or more of enrolled patients had T1, N0 and hormone sensitive disease. Data 
from other large randomized phase III trials evaluating APBI, including the NSABP B39/RTOG 
0413 and RAPID trials, are pending.5 
Updates to institutional prospective studies of APBI cited in the original Consensus 
Statement have also been reviewed. The Austrian Multi Institutional study has reported its 
findings specifically for age.15 In this phase II study of 274 stage I, hormone sensitive breast 
cancer patients who received multicatheter APBI,  five-year local recurrence for patients <50 
years of age was 7.5%, and for patients > 50 years was 1.1% (p = 0.030). Younger women were 
more likely to have received chemotherapy, and those with chemotherapy less likely to have had 
anti-hormone therapy (AHT). Five-year local recurrence for hormone-sensitive patients (n = 264) 
with AHT was 1.1%, and without AHT was 12% (0.0087). In an analysis from 3 prospective 
trials studying mostly brachytherapy delivery of APBI at William Beaumont Hospital, the lack of 
adjuvant tamoxifen therapy use, age < 50, and ER (-) status were significantly associated with 
the development of  in-breast recurrence.6 In the Massachusetts General Hospital Phase II trial of 
3D Conformal Radiation Therapy APBI, an IBTR  occurred in 2 of 15 women aged 40-49 (14% 
actuarial risk) compared to 3 of 83 in those age ≥ 50 years (3% actuarial risk), with median 
follow-up 71 months, although this difference was not statistically significant.7 The two patients 
less than 50 years of age who had an IBTR both had triple negative disease.

 Among APBI registry studies that have updated results, Shah reported no difference by 
age in invasive ductal patients treated with APBI in the American Society of Breast Surgeons 
(ASBS) Mammosite registry trial final analysis, although in DCIS patients, the 5-year IBTR rate 
was 19% in those aged <50 compared to 5.8% for aged >50 years.8    
 
Margins 
Recommendation Statement: 
A. Maintain the current selection criteria for “suitable”, “cautionary” and “unsuitable” 
patients based on margin status (No evidence rating, recommendation rated as 
“Weak”, 75% Agreement). 
 
Pure Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)  
Recommendation Statement: 
A. Include patients with low-risk DCIS as per RTOG 9804 criteria (i.e. screen-detected, low 
to intermediate nuclear grade, ≤ 2.5 cm size, resected with margins negative at ≥ 3 mm), 
in the “suitable” group (Moderate quality of evidence (MQE), recommendation rated 
as “Weak”, 100% Agreement). 
 
The RTOG 9804 randomized clinical trial included women with screen-detected DCIS, 
low to intermediate nuclear grade, ≤ 2.5 cm size, resected with margins negative at ≥ 3 mm.9 
With a median follow up of 7.2 years, risk of IBTR was 6.7% risk in the observation arm 
compared to 0.9% in the whole breast irradiation arm. Similar results were noted in the initial 
publication of the ECOG 5194 trial among patients meeting similar criteria, with observation 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
yielding a 6.1% risk of IBTR at 6.7 years median follow up and 14.4% risk at 12 years.10,11 
These inclusion criteria therefore define a group of patients with low-risk DCIS for whom 
observation confers a low absolute risk of IBTR and for whom the addition of WBI confers a 
small but measurable absolute benefit in prevention of IBTR. When applied to APBI, 41 patients 
in the MammoSite registry met the low-risk enrollment criteria for the ECOG 5194 study and 
experienced a 5-year risk of an IBTR of 0%.12 The 5-year rate of IBTR among all 194 DCIS 
patients in the MammoSite registry was 3.4%.13 A pooled analysis of 300 women with DCIS 
from the MammoSite registry and a single institution similarly showed a 2.6% 5-year risk of 
IBTR.14  In addition, a single institution study evaluating 99 DCIS patients treated with either 
balloon brachytherapy, interstitial brachytherapy, or 3D-conformal EBRT APBI demonstrated a 
1.4% 5-year risk of IBTR.15 When analyzed by the ECOG 5194 risk criteria, the risk was 2% for 
patients meeting these low-risk criteria. Other series similarly showed a 0% 5-year IBTR risk 
among 32 women with DCIS treated with multicatheter brachytherapy.16  
In contrast, one single institution investigation reported a trend towards higher risk of 
time to IBTR among pure DCIS tumors compared to invasive ductal carcinomas at four years 
after MammoSite (HR=3.57 and p=0.06).17 One prospective multicenter trial using MammoSite 
in 41 DCIS patients showed a 9.8% 5- year risk of IBTR, all outside the treatment field.18   
Data from randomized trials of APBI versus whole breast irradiation with selection 
criteria including patients with DCIS are pending. However, given the low risk of IBTR in low-
risk DCIS with wide local excision alone, coupled with favorable results following APBI for 
low-risk DCIS in several series, the task force recommends inclusion of low-risk DCIS patients 
in the “suitable” group. The work group notes that hormonal therapy alone or observation may 
also be appropriate therapy for certain patients in this favorable subset.

New key question: Which patients may be considered for intraoperative partial breast 
irradiation? 
Recommendation statements:  
A. Patients interested in cancer control equivalent to that achieved with whole breast 
irradiation post lumpectomy for breast conservation should be counseled that in two 
clinical trials the risk of IBTR was higher with IORT. (High quality of evidence (HQE), 
recommendation rated as “Strong”, 87.5% Agreement). 
B. Electron beam IORT should be restricted to women with invasive cancer considered 
“suitable” for partial breast irradiation (Table 1) based on the results of a multivariate 
analysis with median follow up of 5.8 years. (Moderate quality of evidence (MQE), 
recommendation rated as “Strong”, 100% Agreement). 
C. Clinical outcome data from low-energy x-ray IORT as a treatment modality for PBI are 
limited by the short median follow up (2.4 years) from an early stage breast cancer phase 
III trial and a paucity of other prospective data with longer follow up. Therefore, low-
energy x-ray IORT for PBI should be used within the context of a prospective registry or 
clinical trial. When low-energy x-ray IORT is used, its use should be restricted to women 
with invasive cancer considered “suitable” for partial breast irradiation. (Table 1) 
(Moderate quality of evidence (MQE), recommendation rated as “Weak”, 87.5% 
Agreement).

Clinical Trials 
 Two large phase 3 trials, the ELIOT trial and the TARGIT trial, compared WBI to IORT 
PBI using either electron beam (ELIOT) 19 or low-energy x-rays (Intrabeam device, TARGIT).20 
Both trials reported increased risk of IBTR after IORT. With a median 5.8 years follow up in 
ELIOT, 5-year IBTR risk was 4.4% after IORT versus 0.4% after WBI. However, ELIOT 
patients with invasive cancer fitting the “suitable” criteria had a very low rate of IBTR.  Among 
these patients, the 5-year occurrence of IBTR was approximately 1.5%, pointing out the 
importance of patient selection.45  
With a median 2.4 years follow up in TARGIT, the 5-year IBTR risk was 3.3% in the low 
energy x-ray IORT arm compared to 1.3%, (p=0.042) in the WBI arm. The writing group noted 
the short follow up of the TARGIT trial relative to the ELIOT trial, which limits precision of the 
five-year risk estimates. Although there was no statistically significant difference in IBTR risk 
for patients treated with IORT versus WBI in the pre-pathology subgroup (2.1% with IORT vs. 
1.1% with WBI), the writing group thought greater weight should be placed on evaluation of the 
efficacy of IORT in the prespecified primary analysis population that included all patients. The 
writing group also noted concerns from the Chair of the TARGIT Data Monitoring Committee 
regarding misuse of the non-inferiority criterion and the responses from the authors.21,22 For 
these reasons, the writing group felt low-energy x-ray IORT should continue to be used within 
the context of a prospective registry or clinical trial to ensure long-term local control and toxicity 
outcomes are prospectively monitored. Further, given the increased risk of IBTR, the writing 
group advised that low-energy x-ray IORT, when used, be confined to patients with the lowest 
risk of IBTR, specifically those in the “suitable” group (Table 1). Since there is no data on the 
use of IORT with DCIS, the writing group recommended its use be limited to patients with 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
invasive breast cancer. These statements will be reconsidered and revised as appropriate when 
important new evidence warrants modification of the recommendation. 
 
Adverse effects 
Adverse effects are different after IORT compared with WBI. In the available trials, fat 
necrosis19,23 was increased with IORT, while skin side effects were lower.19,20 Mild breast 
fibrosis38-40 occurred with electron beam radiation on ELIOT, with no significant difference 
compared to WBI. IORT techniques may allow improved critical organ sparing compared to 
WBI.  Lung fibrosis in the ELIOT trial24 and deaths from cardiovascular causes in the TARGIT 
trial were lower in the IORT groups.13 
In some studies, low-energy x-rays followed by WBI was associated with double the risk 
of breast fibrosis (to 37.5%), increased patient-reported pain, and decreased patient-reported 
quality of life compared to WBI alone.25-28 In contrast, other studies have reported outcomes with 
IORT followed by WBI that appear acceptable and comparable to either WBI alone or WBI with 
a conventional external beam boost.28-30 As such, the writing group felt the combination of IORT 
and WBI should be used only with caution and limited to women with higher risk features on 
final pathology. 
 
Additional Considerations 
Patients meeting criteria for treatment with IORT generally have a low absolute risk of 
IBTR, yet this risk persists over a long period of time, likely at least 10 years. These biologic 
considerations, coupled with the current follow up reported from the ELIOT and TARGIT trials, 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
it is recommended that patients treated with IORT undergo routine long-term follow up for at 
least a 10 years to screen for IBTR. 
 
Comment on External Beam APBI 
Since 2009, several key studies have provided important new data on the complication 
profile of APBI delivered with external beam radiation therapy (either 3-dimensional conformal 
radiation [3D-CRT] or intensity modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]). Most importantly, the 
RAPID trial randomized 2,135 patients to whole breast irradiation or 3D-CRT APBI. 5 Although 
the IBTR risk has not yet been reported, cosmetic outcome, as assessed separately by patients, 
nurses, and physician panels, was consistently worse at 3 and 5 years in patients randomized to 
3D-CRT APBI.15 In contrast, the University Florence phase III trial reported that IMRT APBI 
resulted in improved physician-rated cosmetic outcome compared to WBI.4 Single-arm studies 
have also reported higher rates of fair-poor cosmetic outcomes in approximately 20% of patients 
treated with EBRT-based APBI.31-34 However, other clinical series of APBI delivered with 3D-
CRT or IMRT reported acceptable cosmetic outcomes.7,35-42 These conflicting studies raise the 
hypothesis that subtle variations in planning techniques and/or dose constraints may substantially 
modify the therapeutic ratio of EBRT-based APBI.43-45 In the light of ongoing research, 
particularly the NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 trial, which has yet to report cosmetic outcomes for 
patients treated with 3D-CRT APBI, the task force opted not to make a specific recommendation 
either for, or against, the use of EBRT-based APBI at this time.

Conclusion 
APBI has been tested in a limited number of trials with over 1000 patients over the last 10 
years. These trials show that, in properly selected breast cancer patients, APBI has provided 
outcomes similar to WBI. In the light of the new literature, the suitability criteria for APBI have 
now been updated, as summarized in Tables 1. It is hoped that this update will provide ongoing 
direction for radiation oncologists and other specialists participating in the care of breast cancer 
patients.
