IMPORTANCE New therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer disease (AD) are needed.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether idalopirdine, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 receptor
antagonist, is effective for symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three randomized clinical trials that included 2525
patients aged 50 years or older with mild to moderate AD (study 1: n = 933 patients at 119
sites; study 2: n = 858 at 158 sites; and study 3: n = 734 at 126 sites). The 24-week studies
were conducted from October 2013 to January 2017; final follow-up on January 12, 2017.
INTERVENTIONS Idalopirdine(10,30,or60mg/d)orplaceboaddedtocholinesteraseinhibitor
treatment(donepezilinstudies1and2;donepezil,rivastigmine,orgalantamineinstudy3).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end point in all 3 studies: change in cognition total
score (range, 0-70; a lower score indicates less impairment) from baseline to 24 weeks
measured by the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale
(ADAS-Cog); key secondary end points: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study–Clinical
Global Impression of Change Scale and 23-item Activities of Daily Living Inventory scores.
Dose group efficacy required a significant benefit over placebo for the primary end point and
1 or more key secondary end points. Safety data and adverse event profiles were recorded.
RESULTS Among 2525 patients randomized in the 3 trials (mean age, 74 years; mean baseline
ADAS-Cog total score, 26; between 62% and 65% of participants were women), 2254 (89%)
completed the studies. In study 1, the mean change in ADAS-Cog total score between
baseline and 24 weeks was 0.37 for the 60-mg dose of idalopirdine group, 0.61 for the 30-mg
dose group, and 0.41 for the placebo group (adjusted mean difference vs placebo, 0.05 [95%
CI, −0.88 to 0.98] for the 60-mg dose group and 0.33 [95% CI, −0.59 to 1.26] for the 30-mg
dose group). In study 2, the mean change in ADAS-Cog total score between baseline and 24
weeks was 1.01 for the 30-mg dose of idalopirdine group, 0.53 for the 10-mg dose group, and
0.56 for the placebo group (adjusted mean difference vs placebo, 0.63 [95% CI, −0.38 to
1.65] for the 30-mg dose group; given the gated testing strategy and the null findings at the
30-mg dose, statistical comparison of the 10-mg dose was not performed). In study 3, the
mean change in ADAS-Cog total score between baseline and 24 weeks was 0.38 for the
60-mg dose of idalopirdine group and 0.82 for the placebo group (adjusted mean difference
vs placebo, −0.55 [95% CI, −1.45 to 0.36]). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in
between 55.4% and 69.7% of participants in the idalopirdine groups vs between 56.7% and
61.4% of participants in the placebo groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with mild to moderate AD, the use of
idalopirdine compared with placebo did not improve cognition over 24 weeks of treatment.
These findings do not support the use of idalopirdine for the treatment of AD.

 A
lzheimer disease, a complex disease involving mul-
tiple pathophysiological mechanisms, is increasing in
prevalenceandcostduetotheagingpopulation.1Thera-
pieswithneurotransmitter-basedmechanismshavethepoten-
tial to affect multiple clinical domains in Alzheimer disease.
Two classes of medications are approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of Alzheimer dis-
ease: cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and
galantamine) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate–receptor antago-
nist memantine. Higher doses of cholinesterase inhibitors
may be needed in patients with advanced Alzheimer disease,
but this strategy is limited by increased adverse events due to
peripheral nervous system cholinergic effects (eg, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea).2,3 Amplifying central nervous sys-
tem cholinergic function without inducing peripheral ner-
vous system cholinergic symptoms may therefore provide
greater clinical benefits.
Evidence supports investigation of 5-hydroxytrypta-
mine-6 (5-HT6) antagonism in Alzheimer disease, which may
involve modulation of cholinergic, monoaminergic, and glu-
tamatergic systems.4-6 The 5-HT6 receptors affect learning and
memory7 and the 5-HT6 receptor antagonists have been shown
to improve cognitive performance in animal models.5,6 Even
though clinical trials did not support 5-HT6 antagonist mono-
therapy among patients with Alzheimer disease,8,9 2 phase 2
trialssuggestedthatadministrationof5-HT6antagonistsadded
to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy may improve cognition in
Alzheimer disease.10,11
In one of the phase 2 studies,10 90 mg/d of idalopirdine
(30 mg taken 3 times per day) added to a stable dose of do-
nepezil provided significant improvement in cognitive per-
formance relative to donepezil monotherapy among patients
with moderate Alzheimer disease dementia. Therefore, 3 ran-
domized clinical trials (STARSHINE [study 1], STARBEAM
[study 2], and STARBRIGHT [study 3]) were conducted to as-
sess the efficacy of idalopirdine when added to donepezil or
another cholinesterase inhibitor therapy for the treatment of
mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.
Methods
Study Design and Patient Population
A phase 3 development program consisting of 3 randomized
parallel-group, double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled
24-week studies was conducted. The phase 3 program also in-
cludeda28-week,open-labelextensionstudy(NCT02079246)
for patients completing study 1 or study 2. The designs of the
3 studies are summarized in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1. All 3
studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of
good clinical practice12 and the Declaration of Helsinki.13
The trial protocol and the statistical analysis plan for
study 1 appear in Supplement 2 and Supplement 3; study
2, Supplement 4 and Supplement 5; and study 3, Supple-
ment 6 and Supplement 7. The local ethics committees
approved all aspects of the trial design. Eligible patients or
their legal representatives provided written informed con-
sent before participating.
The 3 studies included patients (1) aged 50 years or older
meeting the National Institute of Neurological and Communi-
cativeDisordersandStroke–AlzheimerDiseaseandRelatedDis-
orders Association criteria14 for the diagnosis of probable
Alzheimer disease, (2) with a Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE)scoreatorbetween12and22atscreening(range,0-30;
a lower score indicates higher impairment), and (3) taking a
therapeutic and stable dose of a cholinesterase inhibitor for
4 months prior to screening. Patients were excluded if (1) tak-
ing memantine, (2) had an alternative cause of dementia,
(3) had serious central nervous system or somatic disorders,
(4)hadclinicallysignificantabnormalities(determinedbylabo-
ratorytesting),or(5)takingconcomitantmedicationsthatwould
interfere with the safety and efficacy assessments.
Randomization, Intervention, and Blinding
The 3 studies used a parallel-group, fixed-dose design to ex-
plore the dose-response relationship for idalopirdine among
patients receiving stable treatment with donepezil in studies
1 and 2 and any cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, rivastig-
mine, or galantamine) in study 3. Patents received 10 mg,
30 mg, or 60 mg of idalopirdine or an identical-appearing pla-
cebo (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3). Randomization and
blinding were applied via an interactive voice response sys-
tem to minimize risk of bias in the evaluation of the clinical
effects of idalopirdine.
In all 3 studies, symmetric randomization to the groups
was stratified by MMSE score stratum. In study 3, randomiza-
tion was also stratified for base therapy (cholinesterase
inhibitor therapy). Block randomization with block sizes of 3
(for study 1 and study 2) and 4 (for study 3) was used and
restricted such that the first 2 patients at each site would
always get different treatments. In study 3, Latin squares
were used to balance treatments, strata, and sites. At least
50% of the patients were to be enrolled from the 12 to 18
MMSE score stratum (further details appear in the eMethods
section in Supplement 1). Compliance was assessed via pill
count at each visit.
During screening, patients were monitored by Lundbeck
medical staff to assess eligibility prior to randomization. Ex-
ternal quality oversight methods (including central review of
scale administration) were used to try to achieve consistent
and accurate ratings throughout the study for the 11-item cog-
nitive subscale of the Alzheimer’
s Disease Assessment Scale
Key Points
Question Does idalopirdine, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-6
receptor antagonist, improve cognitive change in patients
with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease when added to
cholinesterase inhibitors?
Findings In 3 randomized clinical trials that included a total of
2525 patients with Alzheimer disease treated with cholinesterase
inhibitors, the added use of idalopirdine compared with placebo
did not decrease cognitive loss over 24 weeks.
Meaning The findings do not support the use of idalopirdine
for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.

 Outcomes
The primary and key secondary end points were identical
across the 3 studies. The primary end point was change in cog-
nition total score measured by the 11-item ADAS-Cog (range,
0-70; a lower score indicates less impairment)15 from base-
line to 24 weeks. Key secondary end points were changes from
baseline to 24 weeks in activities of daily living (function) mea-
sured by the ADCS-ADL23 (score range, 0-78; a higher score in-
dicates less impairment) and overall clinical response (global
outcome) measured by the ADCS-CGIC.16,17
At the baseline visit, the ADCS-CGIC was used to assess
the severity of illness and has a rating from 1 (normal, not at
all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). At subse-
quent visits, the ADCS-CGIC was used to assess global change
from baseline and has a rating from 1 (very much improved)
to 7 (very much worse), with a rating of 4 indicating no
change. These end points were assessed at baseline and at
weeks 4, 12, and 24. The eMethods section in Supplement 1
contains a list of other prespecified end points. A safety
follow-up visit occurred at week 28. For patients who with-
drew from the studies, efforts were made to collect selected
efficacy assessments after study drug discontinuation.
Safety Data and Adverse Events
Safety data were collected via measurement of vital signs
and weight, through physical and neurological examination,
with clinical safety laboratory tests, by using electrocardio-
graphic parameters, and via assessment of suicidality
(using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale).18 Quali-
fied personnel coded adverse events using the lowest level
term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (version 19.0). According to the law of Hy, a poten-
tially severe liver injury was defined as an alanine amino-
transferase level or an aspartate aminotransferase level
greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal in combination
with a bilirubin level greater than 2 times the upper limit of
normal. All criteria were measured as maximal values
observed during the 3 studies; the criteria did not need to
occur at the same time.19
Statistical Analysis
In all 3 studies, the criterion for showing efficacy of a dose
required demonstration of a significant positive effect on the
ADAS-Cog followed by (in a gated procedure) a significant
positive effect on either the ADCS-ADL23 or the ADCS-CGIC.
A significant effect meant that the adjusted mean difference
for the idalopirdine dose vs placebo was statistically signifi-
cant at a significance level of .05 using 2-sided testing. Due to
the multiple end points and multiple active dose groups
(10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg), multiple testing procedures were
used to control the overall type I error in each study (details
appear in the eMethods section in Supplement 1). For the

 testing strategies used to determine the positive or negative
outcome of the trials, the direction of the effects on the end
points was considered to ensure that a significantly deleteri-
ous treatment effect would not contribute to a positive out-
come. All reported P values are 2-sided.
Based on the testing strategies used to control for multi-
plicity in the individual studies, sample sizes were deter-
minedtoachieve90%powerforstudies1and3and80%power
for study 2. For the power calculations, the assumed treat-
ment differences and correlation of the end points were based
on the outcome of a phase 2 study.10 The assumed difference
in ADAS-Cog total score of −2 points was similar to the effects
produced by cholinesterase inhibitors of −2.02 to −2.73 points
in the midrange of the ADAS-Cog.20
In each study, efficacy analyses were performed on the
full analysis set, which was defined as all randomized
patients who took at least 1 dose of investigational medic-
inal product and who had a valid baseline assessment and at
least 1 valid postbaseline assessment of the primary end
point. Changes from baseline in the ADAS-Cog, ADCS-ADL23,
and ADCS-CGIC were analyzed using a restricted maximum
likelihood–based mixed model for repeated-measures
approach. The model included terms to adjust for the effects
of the MMSE strata and, in study 3 only, cholinesterase
inhibitor therapy in addition to the effects of country and
baseline scores. The effect of the idalopirdine doses was
estimated as a mean difference vs placebo at week 24 using
least-squares means for the treatment × visit interaction
effect in the mixed model.
Sensitivity analyses that adjusted for the study site ef-
fects instead of country effects were done to evaluate the po-
tential effects of site on the outcomes. Sensitivity analyses
using a pattern-mixture model were done to evaluate the suit-
ability of the missing at random assumption imposed by the

 Results
Among 2525 patients (mean age, 74 years; mean baseline
ADAS-Cog total score, 26; between 62% and 65% of partici-
pants were women), 2254 (89%) completed the studies. The
3 studies were conducted in 34 countries worldwide from
October 2013 to January 2017 (study 1: 933 patients at 119
sites in 16 countries; study 2: 858 patients at 158 sites in 18
countries; study 3: 734 patients at 126 sites in 16 countries).
The final follow-up date was January 12, 2017.
Patient demographic and baseline clinical characteristics
are presented in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. Patients had
been diagnosed with Alzheimer disease a median of 1.4 to 1.9
years prior to enrollment, and had a mean duration of back-
ground cholinesterase inhibitor treatment of between 0.9 to
1.2 years. Patients had a mean MMSE score at baseline of
approximately 18. The percentage of patients screening posi-
tive as carriers for at least 1 APOE ε4 allele ranged from 55.6%
to 60.2% (study 1: 59.2%; study 2: 60.2%; study 3: 55.6%).
The baseline patient demographics and clinical characteris-
tics were not different between the idalopirdine and placebo
groups across studies.
The patient withdrawal patterns were similar among the
treatment groups; the proportion of total withdrawals was
9.7% for the 10-mg dose of idalopirdine, 9.7% for the 30-mg
dose, 11.3% for the 60-mg dose, and 9.3% for placebo. In the
full analysis sets, the proportion of missing postbaseline
ADAS-Cog assessments (due to withdrawal, missed visits, or
invalid assessment) was 3.7% in study 1 (Figure 1), 3.8% in
study 2 (Figure 2), and 4.7% in study 3 (Figure 3).
Efficacy Outcomes
At week 24, there were no significant differences in the change
in cognitive performance as measured by the ADAS-Cog total
score in the idalopirdine groups compared with placebo
(Table 4 and Figure 4); therefore, none of the doses of idalopir-
dine met the criterion for efficacy in any of the studies.
In study 1, the mean baseline ADAS-Cog total score was
26.3 for the 60-mg dose of idalopirdine group, 26.7 for the
30-mg dose group, and 25.8 for the placebo group. The mean
change in ADAS-Cog total score between baseline and 24
weeks was 0.37 for the 60-mg dose of idalopirdine group,
0.61 for the 30-mg dose group, and 0.41 for the placebo
group. Compared with placebo, the adjusted mean difference
in the change in ADAS-Cog total score between baseline and
24 weeks was 0.05 (95% CI, −0.88 to 0.98) for the 60-mg
dose of idalopirdine group and 0.33 (95% CI, −0.59 to 1.26)
for the 30-mg dose group.
In study 2, the mean baseline ADAS-Cog total score was
25.3 for the 30-mg dose of idalopirdine group, 25.9 for the
10-mg dose group, and 25.7 for the placebo group. The mean
changeinADAS-Cogtotalscorebetweenbaselineand24weeks
was 1.01 for the 30-mg dose of idalopirdine group, 0.53 for the
10-mg dose group, and 0.56 for the placebo group. Compared
with placebo, the adjusted mean difference in the change in
ADAS-Cog total score between baseline and 24 weeks was 0.63

Error bars indicate 95% CIs. The primary end point was change in cognition total
score (range, 0 to 70; a lower score indicates less impairment) from baseline to
24 weeks as assessed by the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment Scale. Key secondary end points were changes in activities of daily
living (function) measured by the 23-item Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study
Activities of Daily Living Inventory (total score range, 0-78; higher scores indicate
less impairment) and overall clinical response (global outcome) measured by the
Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study–Clinical Global Impression of Change Scale
from baseline to 24 weeks (rated from 1 [normal, not at all ill] to 7 [among the most
extremely ill patients] at baseline; at subsequent visits, rated from 1 [very much
improved] to 7 [very much worse]; 4 indicates no change). These end points were
rated at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, and 24 (completion or withdrawal from the
study). The targeted effect sizes for idalopirdine treatment was a difference of
−2 points vs placebo for the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment Scale, a difference of 2 points vs placebo for the 23-item Alzheimer’s
Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory, and a difference of
−0.25 points vs placebo for the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study–Clinical
Global Impression of Change Scale.

 and −0.09 (95% CI, −1.10 to 0.92) for the 10-mg dose group.
Given the gated testing strategy for statistical significance and
the null findings at the 30-mg dose of idalopirdine, statistical
comparison of the 10-mg dose vs placebo was not performed.
In study 3, the mean baseline ADAS-Cog total score was
26.2 for the 60-mg dose of idalopirdine group and 25.9 for the
placebo group. The mean change in ADAS-Cog total score be-
tween baseline and 24 weeks was 0.38 for the 60-mg dose of
idalopirdine group and 0.82 for the placebo group. Com-
paredwithplacebo,theadjustedmeandifferenceinthechange
in ADAS-Cog total score between baseline and 24 weeks was
−0.55 (95% CI, −1.45 to 0.36) for the 60-mg dose of idalopir-
dine group.
As a consequence of the prespecified gated testing strat-
egy for statistical significance and the nonsignificant find-
ings for the primary end point, findings for the key secondary
end points were considered nonsignificant de facto; there-
fore, no P values are reported for the key secondary end points.
Similarly, the nonsignificant effects with the 30-mg dose of
idalopirdine in study 2 implied nonsignificant effects with the
10-mg dose in that study.
The baseline and final values for the key secondary end
points appear in Figure 4 and the within-group changes from
baseline are reported in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. Individual
patient-level data for the primary and key secondary end
points are presented in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1. In all treat-
ment groups and across all 3 studies, mean treatment adher-
ence was greater than 98% and overall completion rates were
high (89%-91%).
Adverse Events
Adverse event data from studies 1, 2, and 3 are presented in
Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7, including treatment-emergent
adverse events reported by 3% or greater of the patients in
any treatment group, the events leading to study withdrawal,
serious adverse events, and cumulative increased levels of
liver enzymes.
The most common treatment-emergent adverse event
across treatment groups was accidental overdose (idalopir-
dine treatment groups: 5.2%-11.0%; placebo: 8.8%-11.8%) fol-
lowed by falls (idalopirdine treatment groups: 4.2%-6.1%; pla-
cebo: 2.8%-6.0%). Cholinergic treatment-emergent adverse

(vomiting: 1.8%-4.1%; nausea: 1.6%-4.4%) compared with the
placebo groups (vomiting: 0.7%-1.3%; nausea: 1.1%-2.5%). The
proportion of study withdrawals due to treatment-emergent
adverse events was 4.2% for the 10-mg dose of idalopirdine
group, 5.1%-5.7% for the 30-mg dose groups, 5.8%-7.1% for the

The frequency of serious adverse events was low across
system organ classes. A numerically higher percentage of pa-
tients in the 60-mg dose of idalopirdine groups (6.5%-7.7%)
and in the 30-mg dose groups (5.3%-5.8%) experienced seri-
ousadverseeventscomparedwiththe10-mgdosegroup(4.6%)
and the placebo groups (3.9%-6.0%). No specific category of
serious adverse events explained the overall difference and an
association with idalopirdine treatment was not established.
A total of 3 deaths occurred among patients receiving pla-
cebo (n = 955) and 5 deaths occurred among those receiving
idalopirdine (2 in the 30-mg dose groups [n = 594] and 3 in the
60-mg dose groups [n = 672]) across the studies. Examina-
tion of reported causes of death revealed no indication of a
treatment-related pattern. There were no notable differences
in suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior among the treatment
groups in any study.
Sensitivity Analyses
The study results for the primary outcome remained un-
changed in the sensitivity analyses using multiple imputa-
tion for patients withdrawn from the study based on values
from the placebo group (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Sensitiv-
ity analyses adjusting for site yielded results consistent with
the main analysis that adjusted for country.

 disease in 34 countries, 6 months of idalopirdine treatment
added to background cholinesterase inhibitor therapy did
not improve cognition or mitigate the decline in symptoms
measured by performance on the ADAS-Cog, ADCS-ADL23,
or ADCS-CGIC.
The hierarchical statistical testing strategy22 for each
study dictated that (regardless of observations on key sec-
ondary outcomes, which measured domains other than cog-
nition) failure to meet significance on the primary outcome
equated to a null study. The findings for the key secondary
outcomes measuring daily function (ADCS-ADL23) and global
clinical outcome (ADCS-CGIC) appeared congruent with a
null effect. The results on 3 different dementia domains pro-
vide strong support for the absence of efficacy.
This study showed no efficacy in contrast to a phase 2
study10thatsupportedthepotentialefficacyofaddingidalopir-
dinetoacholinesteraseinhibitor.Therewereseveralmajordif-
ferences between the phase 2 study and the phase 3 program.
These differences were in (1) dose (90 mg/d in phase 2 vs 10,
30, and 60 mg/d in phase 3) and schedule (30 mg taken 3 times
perdayinphase2vs10,30,and60mg/dinphase3),(2)sample
population (the phase 3 program broadened the range of cog-
nitive impairment [MMSE score stratum of 12-22 vs 12-19 in the
phase 2 study]), (3) scope of the phase 3 program, which was
a multinational program conducted at hundreds of sites, and
(4) allowable type of background cholinesterase inhibitor use
(galantamine and rivastigmine also were allowed in study 3).
A different schedule and lower daily dose of idalopirdine
were used in the phase 3 program compared with the phase 2
study. The results of an in vivo positron emission tomogra-
phy receptor occupancy study conducted among healthy par-
ticipants taking idalopirdine, which became available after
completion of the phase 2 study, were used to guide dose and
schedule selection in the phase 3 studies, as suggested by the

 US Food and Drug Administration.23 A high 5-HT6 receptor oc-
cupancy (>80%) was achieved at doses of 30 and 60 mg/d of
idalopirdine, which was maintained for 24 hours, supporting
the use of once daily dosing.24 Although there is an approxi-
mate 40% decrease in 5-HT6 receptor expression among pa-
tients with Alzheimer disease compared with healthy indi-
viduals, there are also potential limitations in translating
occupancy data from healthy individuals to those with a dis-
eased brain.25
These 3 studies have several strengths. Each study tested
multiple doses; used appropriate instruments for stage and
purpose to assess multiple dementia domains and adverse
events; had standardized training and monitoring of study
site staff; used central monitoring of data and assessment
methods; and had high completion rates. The demographics
of the study patients were also representative of Alzheimer
disease populations (eg, approximate mean age of 74 years;
65% were women; and 55%-60% were APOE ε4 carriers).
Several characteristics support the external validity of this
program, including the geographic, ethnic, and cultural
diversity of the patients; inclusion of a broad range of cogni-
tive scores (MMSE scores of 12-22); and relatively liberal
inclusion criteria (eg, age ≥50 years with no upper limit, no
central reading of brain magnetic resonance imaging or com-
puted tomography, no requirement for Alzheimer disease
profile positivity with amyloid positron emission tomogra-
phy or cerebrospinal fluid profile). This phase 3 program also
allowed concomitant use of any cholinesterase inhibitor (not
just donepezil) as background treatment in study 3.
Placing the results of this study in the broader context of
the 5-HT6 antagonism adjunctive to cholinesterase inhibitor
therapy mechanism of action suggests a lack of efficacy for
this approach in the treatment of Alzheimer disease. In the
phase 3 MINDSET study,26 intepirdine (another 5-HT6
antagonist) was administered at a dose of 35 mg daily (added
to background donepezil therapy) in patients with mild to
moderate Alzheimer disease and it failed to meet cognitive
and functional efficacy outcomes. The negative results from
the phase 3 MINDSET study run counter to the phase 2
results with intepirdine that had suggested a potential ben-
efit in Alzheimer disease.11
Limitations
The 3 studies have limitations. There was no require-
ment for evidence of Alzheimer disease biomarker positivity
for inclusion, which may have allowed some patients to be
included without having Alzheimer disease pathology.
In addition, background therapy with memantine was not
allowed, which may limit extrapolation of the results to
patients with Alzheimer disease with similar MMSE scores
(ie, MMSE scores of 12-22) who are taking background mono-
therapy with memantine, or, more commonly, who are tak-
ing background combination therapy with a cholinesterase
inhibitor and memantine.
Conclusions
InpatientswithmildtomoderateAlzheimerdisease,theuseof
idalopirdine compared with placebo did not improve cognition
over 24 weeks of treatment. These findings do not support the
use of idalopirdine for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.
