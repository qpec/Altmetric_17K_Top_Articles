Current Tobacco Smoking and Desire to Quit Smoking Among Students Aged 
13–15 Years — Global Youth Tobacco Survey, 61 Countries, 2012–2015

Tobacco use is the world’s leading cause of preventable 
morbidity and mortality, resulting in nearly 6 million deaths 
each year (1). Smoked tobacco products, such as cigarettes 
and cigars, are the most common form of tobacco consumed 
worldwide (2), and most tobacco smokers begin smoking 
during adolescence (3). The health benefits of quitting are 
greater for persons who stop smoking at earlier ages; however, 
quitting smoking at any age has health benefits (4). CDC 
used the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) data from 61 
countries across the six World Health Organization (WHO) 
regions from 2012 to 2015 to examine the prevalence of current 
tobacco smoking and desire to quit smoking among students 
aged 13–15 years. Across all 61 countries, the median current 
tobacco smoking prevalence among students aged 13–15 years 
was 10.7% (range = 1.7%, Sri Lanka to 35.0%, Timor-Leste). 
By sex, the median current tobacco smoking prevalence was 
14.6% among males (range = 2.9%, Tajikistan to 61.4%, 
Timor-Leste) and 7.5% among females (range = 1.6%, 
Tajikistan to 29.0%, Bulgaria). In the majority of countries 
assessed, the proportion of current tobacco smokers who 
desired to quit smoking exceeded 50%. These findings could 
be used by country level tobacco control programs to inform 
strategies to prevent and reduce youth tobacco use (1,4).
GYTS is a nationally representative school-based, paper 
and pencil, cross-sectional survey of students in school grades 
associated with ages 13–15 years. GYTS uses a standardized 
methodology that allows for cross-country comparisons.* 
For this report, countries were selected if they met the fol-
lowing criteria: 1) nationally representative data (rather than 
subnational data) were available to allow for cross-country 
comparisons; and 2) data were collected during 2012–2015 
to allow for estimation of recent prevalence estimates. Based 
on these criteria, 61 countries from all six WHO regions were 
selected for analyses.† The number of participating countries 
from each WHO region were African Region (AFR, 10 coun-
tries)§; Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR, 10)¶; European 
Region (EUR, 18)**; Region of the Americas (AMR, 13)††; 
South East Asian Region (SEAR, 5)§§; and Western Pacific 
Region (WPR, 5).¶¶ Overall sample sizes ranged from 534 
students in San Marino to 10,018 in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
(median = 2,428), and overall response rates ranged from 
60.3% in Nicaragua to 99.2% in Sudan. Data were weighted 
for each country to yield nationally representatives estimates 
of youths attending school.
Students were asked about current (past 30-day) use of 
cigarettes*** and any form of smoked tobacco other than 
cigarettes.††† Current tobacco smoking was defined as smoking 
cigarettes or other smoked tobacco products on ≥1 day during 
the past 30 days. Students were classified as having a desire to 
quit smoking§§§ if they answered “yes” to the question, “Do 
you want to stop smoking now?”
Overall country-specific prevalence estimates with corre-
sponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for current 
tobacco smoking and desire to quit smoking. Estimates based 
on unweighted sample sizes <35 or relative standard error >0.3 
are not reported. For countries where data are reported for both 
sexes, chi-squared tests were used to determine statistically 
significant differences (p<0.05) in current tobacco smoking 
between males and females.
* The Global Youth Tobacco Survey uses a two-stage sample design to select 
schools with a probability of selection proportional to enrollment size. The 
classes within selected schools are randomly selected and all students in selected 
classes are eligible to participate in the survey. More information is available 
from https://nccd.cdc.gov/GTSSDataSurveyResources/Ancillary/
Documentation.aspx?SUID=1&DOCT=1.
† Two countries (Finland and Bolivia) collected data in 2012 and did not use the 
updated GYTS methodology, and were excluded; two countries, (Bangladesh 
and Turkmenistan), did not meet the minimum established threshold for 
reporting results of sample size <35 or relative standard error >0.3, and were 
excluded; and one country (Russian Federation), collected subnational data 
and was excluded.

9.1% (Philippines) in WPR. Males had a higher prevalence of 
current tobacco smoking in 38 countries (p<0.05); females had 
a significantly higher prevalence of current tobacco smoking 
in one country (Portugal) (p<0.05).
Among the 51 countries in which the desire to quit was 
assessed among current tobacco smokers, the proportion of 
students who desired to quit ranged from 32.1% (Uruguay) 
to 90.2% (Philippines); the proportion of current tobacco 
smokers who reported a desire to quit exceeded 50% in 40 of 
those countries (Figure). By WHO region, the proportions 
ranged from 62.2% (Seychelles) to 86.3% (Kenya) in AFR; 
49.1% (United Arab Emirates) to 75.8% (Yemen) in EMR; 
43.5% (Italy) to 83.1% (Moldova) in EUR; 32.1% (Uruguay) 
to 70.1% (Guyana) in AMR; 67.8% (Timor-Leste) to 88.2% 
(Indonesia) in SEARO; and 66.9% (South Korea) to 90.2% 
(Philippines) in WPR.
Discussion
The prevalence of current tobacco smoking among students 
aged 13–15 years in 61 countries ranged from 1.7% (Sri Lanka) 
to 35.0% (Timor-Leste). In 38 countries, tobacco smoking 
prevalence was significantly higher among males than females. 
In 40 of 51 countries that collected data about the desire to 
quit, the proportion of students who reported current tobacco 
smoking and desired to quit exceeded 50%.
WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 
(FCTC), the first international treaty negotiated under the 
auspices of WHO and developed in response to the global 
tobacco epidemic, includes evidence-based measures that have 
the potential to reduce youth tobacco use (5). These measures 
include increasing the price of tobacco (Article 6), bans on 
tobacco advertising, promotions, and sponsorship (Article 13), 
promoting tobacco cessation (Article 14), addressing illicit 
trade of tobacco products (Article 15), and prohibiting the 
sale of tobacco products to and by minors (Article 16). At the 
beginning of 2017, 59 of 61 countries in this report had ratified 
the FCTC. However, varying levels of tobacco control policy 
implementation and other country-specific factors might influ-
ence access to tobacco and tobacco smoking prevalence (6).
To assist with implementation of FCTC, countries can 
implement WHO’s MPOWER package (7). MPOWER is a 
set of evidence-based interventions intended to reduce tobacco

use, including 1) monitoring tobacco use and prevention poli-
cies; 2) protecting persons from tobacco smoke; 3) offering help 
to quit tobacco use; 4) warning about the dangers of tobacco 
use; 5) enforcing bans on tobacco sponsorship, promotion, 
and advertising; and 6) raising taxes on tobacco. When imple-
mented as part of a comprehensive approach, these strategies 
can help reduce youth tobacco use (3,4,8).
This report is subject to at least four limitations. First, data 
were self-reported by students, which might result in mis-
reporting of smoking behavior. Second, the data presented 
represent only youths who are enrolled in school, which might 
limit generalizability to all youths in these countries. Third, 
low response rates in some countries might have resulted in 
nonresponse bias. Finally, only a limited number of countries 
were assessed from each WHO region; thus, the findings in 
this report are not necessarily generalizable to all countries in 
the respective WHO regions.
The prevalence of tobacco smoking is high among youths in 
many countries. However, many students who currently smoke 
report that they desire to quit. Implementing the evidence-
based measures outlined in WHO’s MPOWER package can 
help reduce tobacco use among youths, as well as the estimated 
1 billion tobacco-related deaths projected to occur during the 
21st century if current trends persist (1).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Smoked tobacco products, such as cigarettes and cigars, are the 
most common form of tobacco consumed worldwide and most 
tobacco smokers begin smoking during adolescence.
What is added by this report?
Global Youth Tobacco Survey data from 61 countries from 2012 
to 2015 revealed that the median current tobacco smoking 
prevalence among students aged 13–15 years was 10.7%. 
Tobacco smoking prevalence differed by gender and varied 
across countries. In the majority of countries, over 50% of youth 
tobacco smokers desired to quit.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Implementing the evidence-based measures outlined in the 
World Health Organization’s MPOWER package can help reduce 
tobacco use among youths, as well as the estimated 1 billion 
tobacco-related deaths projected to occur during the 21st 
century if current trends persist.
