IMPORTANCE Antithrombotic therapies are known to prevent stroke for patients with atrial
fibrillation (AF) but are often underused in community practice.
OBJECTIVES To examine the prevalence of patients with acute ischemic stroke with known
history of AF who were not receiving guideline-recommended antithrombotic treatment
before stroke and to determine the association of preceding antithrombotic therapy with
stroke severity and in-hospital outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective observational study of 94 474 patients
with acute ischemic stroke and known history of AF admitted from October 2012 through
March 2015 to 1622 hospitals participating in the Get With the Guidelines–Stroke program.
EXPOSURES Antithrombotic therapy before stroke.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Stroke severity as measured by the National Institutes of
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; range of 0-42, with a higher score indicating greater stroke
severity and a score �16 indicating moderate or severe stroke), and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS Of 94 474 patients (mean [SD] age, 79.9 [11.0] years; 57.0% women), 7176 (7.6%)
were receiving therapeutic warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] �2) and 8290 (8.8%)
were receiving non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) preceding the stroke.
A total of 79 008 patients (83.6%) were not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation; 12 751
(13.5%) had subtherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation (INR <2) at the time of stroke, 37 674
(39.9%) were receiving antiplatelet therapy only, and 28 583 (30.3%) were not receiving any
antithrombotic treatment. Among 91 155 high-risk patients (prestroke CHA2DS2-VASc
score �2), 76 071 (83.5%) were not receiving therapeutic warfarin or NOACs before stroke.
The unadjusted rates of moderate or severe stroke were lower among patients receiving
therapeutic warfarin (15.8% [95% CI, 14.8%-16.7%]) and NOACs (17.5% [95% CI, 16.6%-18.4%])
than among those receiving no antithrombotic therapy (27.1% [95% CI, 26.6%-27.7%]),
antiplatelet therapy only (24.8% [95% CI, 24.3%-25.3%]), or subtherapeutic warfarin (25.8%
[95% CI, 25.0%-26.6%]); unadjusted rates of in-hospital mortality also were lower for those
receiving therapeutic warfarin (6.4% [95% CI, 5.8%-7.0%]) and NOACs (6.3% [95% CI, 5.7%-
6.8%]) compared with those receiving no antithrombotic therapy (9.3% [95% CI, 8.9%-9.6%]),
antiplatelet therapy only (8.1% [95% CI, 7.8%-8.3%]), or subtherapeutic warfarin (8.8% [95%
CI, 8.3%-9.3%]). After adjusting for potential confounders, compared with no antithrombotic
treatment, preceding use of therapeutic warfarin, NOACs, or antiplatelet therapy was associated
with lower odds of moderate or severe stroke (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], 0.56 [0.51-0.60],
0.65 [0.61-0.71], and 0.88 [0.84-0.92], respectively) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds
ratio [95% CI], 0.75 [0.67-0.85], 0.79 [0.72-0.88], and 0.83 [0.78-0.88], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with atrial fibrillation who had experienced
an acute ischemic stroke, inadequate therapeutic anticoagulation preceding the stroke was
prevalent. Therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with lower odds of moderate or severe
stroke and lower odds of in-hospital mortality.

A
trial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for
stroke, increases stroke risk by a factor of 4 to 5, and
accounts for 10% to 15% of all ischemic strokes.1,2
While the burden of AF-related stroke is high, AF is a poten-
tially treatable risk factor. Numerous studies have dem-
onstrated that vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, or
non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), such as
dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, reduce the
risk of ischemic stroke.3-8 Based on these data, current guide-
lines recommend adjusted-dose warfarin or NOACs over aspi-
rin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with AF.1,9
Despite guideline recommendations, oral anticoagulants
suchaswarfarinareoftenunderusedincommunitypractice.10,11
Several studies have reported that warfarin might also reduce
stroke severity if stroke occurs.12-14 Nonetheless, these find-
ings are based on select patients from a single health plan or a
local health system before the era of NOACs. More importantly,
stroke severity either was assessed at discharge, which might
have been affected by in-hospital treatment, or was not as-
sessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
(NIHSS), which is considered the reference standard. With the
rapid adoption of NOACs in clinical practice, there is a lack
of contemporary data on a national scope regarding the preva-
lenceofprecedingantithrombotictreatmentamongpatientswith
knownhistoryofAFwhodevelopacuteischemicstrokeandhow
stroke severity and outcomes differ by such treatment.
The goals of the study were to examine the prevalence of
preceding antithrombotic treatment among patients with AF
who had experienced an acute ischemic stroke and to assess
the association between preceding antithrombotic treatment
with initial stroke severity, in-hospital mortality, and func-
tional outcomes at discharge.
Methods
Study Design and Data Sources
Details of the design and conduct of the Patient-Centered Re-
search Into Outcomes Stroke Patients Prefer and Effective-
ness Research (PROSPER) study have been previously
described.15-18 Briefly, PROSPER is a Patient-Centered Out-
comes Research Institute (PCORI)–sponsored project de-
signed to help patients, physicians, and other stakeholders
make informed decisions about stroke care and improve pa-
tient outcomes. The study was conceived and designed by the
multidisciplinary PROSPER team, composed of researchers
partnering with patient investigators and stakeholders.
PROSPER builds on the American Heart Association
(AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) Get With the
Guidelines–Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) Registry program, which is
an ongoing, voluntary, national stroke registry and quality-
improvement initiative sponsored by the AHA/ASA.19,20
Standardized data collection includes patient demographic
characteristics, medical history, medications prior to admis-
sion, diagnostic testing, brain imaging, in-hospital treat-
ment, and outcomes. Data elements for dabigatran and riva-
roxaban use prior to admission were added to the registry
in October 2012, followed by apixaban in October 2013 and
edoxabaninSeptember2015.Thevalidityandreliabilityofdata
collection have been reported previously.21 Each participat-
ing hospital received either human research approval to en-
roll patients without individual patient consent under the
CommonRuleorawaiverofauthorizationandexemptionfrom

Inc serves as the data collection and coordination center. The
DukeClinicalResearchInstituteservesasthedataanalysiscen-
ter and has an agreement to analyze the aggregate deidenti-
fied data for research purposes. This study was approved by
the institutional review board of Duke University.
Study Population and Variables of Interest
This is a retrospective analysis of patients with known his-
tory of AF or atrial flutter who had experienced an acute
ischemic stroke and were admitted from October 2012
through March 2015 to hospitals participating in GWTG-
Stroke. History of AF or atrial flutter was defined as AF or
atrial flutter known to exist prior to the index acute ischemic
stroke admission and documented in the medical record.
Preceding antithrombotic treatment was defined as docu-
mentation of patients receiving an antithrombotic agent
within 7 days before hospital arrival. For the purpose of the
study, antithrombotic treatments were categorized into 5
mutually exclusive groups: (1) no antithrombotic therapy
(none) as the reference; (2) antiplatelet therapy only (aspirin,
clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and
clopidogrel); (3) subtherapeutic warfarin with an admission
international normalized ratio (INR) less than 2; (4) therapeu-
tic warfarin with an INR of 2 or higher; and (5) NOACs (dabi-
gatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban). Edoxaban was approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration in January 2015;
therefore, information on edoxaban was not collected in this
registry during the study period.
Reasons for no anticoagulation prior to the index hospi-
talization were not collected in this registry. Because contra-
indications or reasons for no anticoagulation are likely to per-
sist after stroke, documented reasons for no anticoagulation
at discharge were analyzed to gain insights into potential rea-
sonsanticoagulationwasnotprovidedpriortoadmission.Rea-
sons for not prescribing anticoagulation at hospital discharge
Key Points
Question What is the prevalence of preceding antithrombotic
treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation who had experienced
an ischemic stroke, and what is its association with stroke severity
and in-hospital outcomes?
Findings In this observational study of 94 474 patients with acute
ischemic stroke who had a known history of atrial fibrillation, 84%
did not receive guideline-recommended therapeutic
anticoagulation preceding the stroke. Therapeutic anticoagulation
with warfarin or non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants was
significantly associated with lesser stroke severity and lower odds
of in-hospital mortality.
Meaning Among patients with atrial fibrillation who had
experienced an acute ischemic stroke, inadequate therapeutic
anticoagulation preceding the stroke was prevalent.

were documented in the medical record by a physician, ad-
vanced practice nurse, or physician assistant.
The primary outcomes were the initial stroke severity at
admissionandin-hospitalmortality.TheNIHSSscorewasused
as a measure of stroke severity (range of 0-42, with a higher
scoreindicatinggreaterstrokeseverity).PatientswithanNIHSS
score of 16 or higher were classified as having a moderate or
severe stroke.22,23 The secondary outcome was functional out-
come at discharge as measured by the modified Rankin Scale
(mRS) score (range of 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]).24 Pa-
tients with an mRS score of 0 or 1 were classified as having ex-
cellent recovery and those with an mRS score of 0 to 2 were
classified as having functional independence.
Statistical Analysis
Medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]) and percentages were
used to describe the distribution of continuous and categori-
cal variables, respectively. Baseline characteristics were
compared across 5 preceding antithrombotic treatment
groups using the Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables and
Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. Multivariable
logistic regression models were performed to investigate the
relationships between preceding antithrombotic therapies
with each clinical outcome measure: stroke severity at
admission, in-hospital mortality, and mRS score at dis-
charge. These analyses adjusted for baseline demographic
and clinical variables prior to the index stroke event, includ-
ing age, sex, race/ethnicity (admission staff, medical staff, or
both recorded the patient’
s self-reported race/ethnicity, usu-
ally during the registration; prior studies have suggested dif-
ferences in outcomes from acute ischemic stroke related to
race/ethnicity), insurance, medical history (coronary artery
disease [CAD] or prior myocardial infarction [MI], prior
stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA], prosthetic heart
valve, carotid stenosis, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, and
smoking status), and use of antihypertensive, cholesterol-
lowering, or antidiabetic medication prior to admission. The
preceding antithrombotic treatment was included as an
independent variable, with no antithrombotic therapy as the
reference group.
In addition, administration of intravenous tissue plas-
minogenactivator,intra-arterialcatheter-basedtreatment,and
hospital characteristics (number of beds, academic status, pri-
mary stroke center, annual ischemic stroke volume, annual tis-
sue plasminogen activator volume, hospital region, and rural
location) were included in the mortality and mRS models be-
cause these variables are expected to be predictive of in-
hospital outcomes but not initial stroke severity. Generalized
estimating equations with exchangeable correlation matrix
were used to account for within-hospital clustering. Because
it is inappropriate to impute outcome measure, complete case
analyses were performed for stroke severity, in-hospital mor-
tality, and mRS models.
In addition to the overall population, prespecified strati-
fied analyses were performed in clinically relevant sub-
groups by age (<80 and ≥80 years); sex; history of previous
stroke or TIA; CAD or MI; and prestroke CHA2DS2-VASc score
(congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years
[doubled], diabetes, stroke/TIA/thromboembolism [doubled],
vascular disease [prior MI, peripheral artery disease, or aortic
plaque], age 65-75 years, sex category [female]) because these
variables are expected to influence the decision of antithrom-
botic treatment. Interactions between antithrombotic treat-
ment and each subgroup variable were formally tested by
includingtheinteractiontermsinthelogisticregressionmodel.
A CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 or 1 corresponds to low to moder-
ate thromboembolic risk and 2 or higher indicates high risk
prior to the index stroke event.25-27 Except for patients receiv-
ing warfarin or NOACs with a prestroke CHA2DS2-VASc score
of 0 or 1, this analysis had more than 80% statistical power for
each subgroup.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc). All P values are
2-sided, with P < .05 considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 120 260 patients with known history of AF who
had experienced an acute ischemic stroke were admitted
from October 2012 through March 2015 to hospitals partici-
pating in the GWTG-Stroke program. Of these, 16 933 patients
transferred from another hospital were excluded because
in-hospital care from the transferring hospital could not be
tracked after transfer. In addition, patients receiving warfarin
with missing information on INR at admission (n = 6686)
and patients who were receiving unfractionated heparin,
low-molecular-weight heparin, argatroban, desirudin,
fondaparinux, lepirudin, aspirin-dipyridamole, prasugrel,
ticagrelor, or ticlopidine (n = 2167) were also excluded. After
these exclusions, the final study population consisted of
94 474 patients admitted to 1622 hospitals in the United
States (eFigure in the Supplement). For the outcome mea-
sures, data were available for stroke severity (for 81.7% of
cases), in-hospital mortality (98.0%), and mRS score (52.0%).

Table 1). The overall median INR at admission was 1.7 (IQR, 1.3-
2.3) in all warfarin-treated patients, with a median INR of 1.4
(IQR, 1.2-1.6) in patients receiving subtherapeutic warfarin and
2.5 (IQR, 2.2-3.1) in those receiving therapeutic warfarin (all
these differences were statistically significant with P < .001).
Stroke Severity and In-Hospital Outcomes
The distribution of NIHSS scores and the proportion of
patients presenting with moderate or severe stroke (NIHSS
score ≥16) are shown in Table 2. The median initial NIHSS
scores were significantly higher among patients not receiv-
ing antithrombotic medication (7 [IQR, 2-16]), antiplatelet
therapy only (6 [IQR, 2-15]), or subtherapeutic warfarin
(6 [IQR, 2-16]) compared with those receiving therapeutic
warfarin (4 [IQR, 1-10]) and NOACs (4 [IQR, 1-11]) (P < .001).
Similarly, patients receiving no antithrombotic treatment
(27.1% [95% CI, 26.6%-27.7%]), antiplatelet therapy only
(24.8% [95% CI, 24.3%-25.3%]), or subtherapeutic warfarin
(25.8% [95% CI, 25.0%-26.6%]) were more likely to present
with moderate or severe stroke than those receiving thera-
peutic warfarin (15.8% [95% CI, 14.8%-16.7%]) or NOACs
(17.5% [95% CI, 16.6%-18.4%]) (P < .001). Compared with no
antithrombotic treatment, therapeutic warfarin (adjusted
odds ratio [AOR] = 0.56 [95% CI, 0.51-0.60]), NOACs
(AOR = 0.65 [95% CI, 0.61-0.71]), and antiplatelet therapy
only (AOR = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.92]) were associated with
lower odds of moderate or severe stroke (Table 2 and
Figure 1).
The unadjusted rates of in-hospital mortality were high-
est in patients not receiving antithrombotic treatment (9.3%
[95% CI, 8.9%-9.6%]), followed by subtherapeutic warfarin
(8.8% [95% CI, 8.3%-9.3%]), antiplatelet treatment only
(8.1% [95% CI, 7.8%-8.3%]), therapeutic warfarin (6.4%
[95% CI, 5.8%-7.0%]), and NOACs (6.3% [95% CI, 5.7%-
6.8%]) (P < .001; Table 2). After multivariable adjustment,
therapeutic warfarin (AOR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.67-0.85]),
NOACs (AOR = 0.79 [95% CI, 0.72-0.88]), and antiplatelet
therapy only (AOR = 0.83 [95% CI, 0.78-0.88]) were associ-
ated with lower odds of in-hospital mortality compared
with no antithrombotic treatment (Table 2 and Figure 2).
Similarly, patients receiving preceding antithrombotic treat-
ment had higher odds of having better functional outcomes
(mRS score of 0-1 or 0-2) at discharge (Table 2).
Subgroup Analyses
Of 94 474 patients with AF who had experienced acute ische-
mic stroke, 55 553 (58.8%) were aged 80 years or older, 53 878
(57.0%) were women, 34 059 (36.1%) had a history of prior

a Excluding 18.3% with missing records. The NIHSS is a measure of stroke
severity, ranging from 0 to 42, with a higher score indicating greater stroke
severity. An NIHSS score of 16 or higher indicates moderate or severe stroke.
The stroke severity model adjusts for baseline demographic and clinical
variables prior to the index stroke event, including age, sex, race/ethnicity,
insurance, medical history, and use of antihypertensive, cholesterol-lowering,
or antidiabetic medication prior to admission.
bExcluding 2.0% of transfer-out or discharge disposition missing records. The
in-hospital mortality model adjusts for the same variables as the stroke
severity model plus administration of tissue plasminogen activator,
intra-arterial catheter-based treatment, and hospital characteristics including
hospital bed size, academic, primary stroke center, annual ischemic stroke
volume, annual tissue plasminogen activator volume, hospital region,
and rural location.
c Excluding 48.0% with missing mRS scores. The mRS is a measure of degree
of disability and functional outcomes, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6
(death). An mRS score of 0 or 1 indicates excellent recovery; 0 to 2, functional
independence after stroke. The mRS model adjusts for the same variables as
the in-hospital mortality model.

for interaction were not significant (P for interaction > .05) for
most subgroups. The exceptions were age and antiplatelet
therapy (P for interaction = .002); prior stroke and NOACs
(P for interaction = .007); CHA2DS2-VASc score and subthera-
peutic warfarin (P for interaction = .04) with respect to stroke

action < .001); and CHA2DS2-VASc score and antiplatelet
therapy (P for interaction = .02) with respect to mortality
(Figure 1 and Figure 2).
Subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, medical history
of prior stroke or TIA, and CAD or MI found lower odds of mod-
erate or severe stroke and mortality among patients receiving
therapeutic warfarin, NOACs, or only antiplatelet therapy
(Figure 1 and Figure 2). Nonetheless, the lower odds of mod-
erateorseverestrokeassociatedwithuseofantiplatelettherapy
alone were less than those associated with use of therapeutic
warfarin and NOACs in most subgroups. There were no statis-
tically significant differences in terms of stroke severity and
mortality between use of subtherapeutic warfarin and no an-
tithrombotic therapy.
The relationship between preceding antithrombotic
therapy and outcomes remained essentially the same in the
subgroup analyses of patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of
2 or higher (Figure 1 and Figure 2). However, only antiplatelet
treatmentwasassociatedwithsignificantlyloweroddsofmod-
erate or severe stroke (AOR = 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]) and
death (AOR = 0.53 [95% CI, 0.35-0.80]) among patients with
a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 or 1.

nal illness (6.2%), patient or family refusal (4.3%), mental sta-
tus (1.1%), medication adverse effects (1.0%), or allergy (0.6%).
However, 38 249 of the 58 084 patients (65.8%) did not have a
documented reason for not receiving oral anticoagulation.
Discussion
In this large, nationwide, contemporary registry of patients
with a known history of AF who had experienced an acute is-
chemic stroke, 30% were receiving some form of oral antico-
agulants before their stroke. Moreover, 64% of warfarin-
treated patients were receiving subtherapeutic warfarin.
Collectively, 84% of patients were not receiving guideline-
recommended anticoagulation or had anticoagulation levels
that were not in the therapeutic range, even among those with
high thromboembolic risk before stroke.
Atrial fibrillation is a highly prevalent and important, but
treatable, risk factor for stroke. Despite numerous interna-
tional guideline recommendations, many patients fail to
receive proper treatment for stroke prevention. A systematic
review of 54 studies from 11 countries in Europe, North
America, and South America found consistent patterns of
oral anticoagulation underuse in patients with AF who had
an elevated risk of stroke.28 In a contemporary outpatient
cardiac quality-improvement registry in the United States,
60% of patients with a CHADS2 score (congestive heart fail-
ure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes, stroke/TIA/
thromboembolism [doubled]) of 2 or higher were treated
with warfarin or NOACs.29 Unlike previous studies that
evaluated the prevalence of antithrombotic therapy in
patients at risk for stroke, this analysis examined the other
end of the spectrum: how patients presenting with acute
ischemic stroke were treated prior to their stroke event. This
approach has implications for clinical practice because it
identifies potentially preventable strokes in high-risk
patients with AF who either were not treated with anticoagu-
lants or did not receive adequate anticoagulation. Each year,
nearly 700 000 individuals in the United States experience a
new or recurrent ischemic stroke, and 10% to 15% of these
strokes are estimated to be of cardioembolic origin.2,30 Based
on results from pivotal anticoagulation trials and the preva-
lence of inadequate therapeutic anticoagulation observed in
our study, a substantial number of strokes may be due to
underuse of or inadequate anticoagulation in AF.
There have been concerns that some patients with AF may
not be ideal candidates for oral anticoagulants, and the selec-
tion of an antithrombotic agent should be individualized on
the basis of patient risk factors, preference, and other clinical
characteristics.ItispossiblethatwarfarinorotherNOACsmight
have been contraindicated in some patients. Although the data
in this study preclude direct assessment of eligibility for an-
tithrombotic therapy before stroke, reasons for no anticoagu-
lation at discharge among survivors of stroke were reported
in order to gain insights into potential reasons anticoagula-
tion was not provided prior to admission. Up to two-thirds of
patients with a prestroke CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or higher

did not have a documented reason for nonuse of antithrom-
botic therapy. While the absence of documentation of rea-
sons for nonuse does not mean the absence of a legitimate rea-
sonfornonuse,allofthesepatientshadAFdiagnosedwithhigh
thromboembolic risk before their stroke. Therefore, these pa-
tients should have been treated with anticoagulation if treat-
ment was not contraindicated. Among those with a docu-
mented reason for not using antithrombotic therapy, 16% of
nonuse was due to risk of bleeding, 10% to risk of falls, and
4% to patient or family refusal. Although risks of bleeding and
falls may be considered to make a patient ineligible for anti-
coagulation therapy, some studies suggested that the per-
ceived risk of bleeding and falls may have been overesti-
mated, especially in elderly individuals.31-33 Even if patients
were unable to use oral anticoagulants due to contraindica-
tions, antiplatelet therapy could have been considered.1,9 Nev-
ertheless, 30% of high-risk patients in this study were not re-
ceiving any form of antithrombotic therapy before stroke,
highlighting the opportunities for stroke prevention by im-
proving appropriate AF treatment.
Prior studies have demonstrated that warfarin therapy re-
duces the incidence of stroke and also reduces the risk of se-
vere stroke even when stroke occurs.12,13 Unlike previous re-
search that relied on nonstandard severity measures at
discharge, the current study reports NIHSS score at baseline,
which is considered the reference standard,22,23 and may bet-
ter reflect contemporary use and nonuse of antithrombotic
therapy in the United States for patients with AF who had ex-
perienced an acute ischemic stroke. Therapeutic warfarin was
associated with less severe stroke and fewer deaths. By con-
trast, the outcomes were almost equally poor in warfarin-
treated patients with a subtherapeutic INR and patients not re-
ceivinganyantithromboticagents.Thesefindingsreinforcethe
importance of INR monitoring and dose adjustment to im-
prove compliance and keep the INR in the therapeutic range
for patients receiving warfarin.
Use of NOACs also was associated with reduced odds of
stroke severity, disability, and in-hospital mortality, with point
estimates similar to the odds ratios for therapeutic warfarin.
These results seem plausible based on the understanding of
the mechanisms in NOACs and given how these results align
with data from clinical trials. However, there could be bias in
a direct comparison of preceding warfarin and NOAC therapy
for outcomes that these treatments are meant to prevent. It is
challenging to address the treatment selection bias in a popu-
lation that already experienced a stroke. Nevertheless, a di-
rect comparison of stroke severity and outcomes in patients
with ischemic stroke receiving warfarin vs NOACs is challeng-
ing because of the efficacy of oral anticoagulants and low event
rates in patients receiving oral anticoagulants. A total of 8290
patients in this study experienced an ischemic stroke while re-
ceiving NOACs. In contrast, there were 1150 strokes among pa-
tients treated with NOACs in 4 pivotal NOAC trials.5-8
In this study, in addition to therapeutic warfarin and
NOACs, antiplatelet treatment was also associated with less
severe stroke and lower mortality in patients with a prestroke
CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or higher. The lower severity of
stroke and lower odds of in-hospital mortality were limited to
patients receiving only antiplatelet treatment and were not
observed in warfarin- or NOAC-treated patients presenting
with a prestroke CHA2DS2-VASc score less than 2. In addition,
only 3% of patients in the study cohort had a prestroke
CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 or 1. These findings provide further
evidence supporting the use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score for
risk stratification and selecting treatment based on an indi-
vidual’
s risk for cardioembolic events.
This study had several limitations. First, this was a retro-
spective observational analysis. Treatment selection and un-
measured confounding could affect the validity of study find-
ings. It is impossible to randomize patients with stroke to
differentantithromboticregimensbecausetreatmentwasgiven
prior to the stroke. Furthermore, given the low event rates in
stroke prevention trials,5-8 the numbers of patients with stroke
would probably be too small to assess the relationship of pre-
ceding anticoagulation therapy with stroke severity and out-
comes.Second,theGWTG-Strokeregistrydatabaseusedinthis
study included only patients who had a stroke. Patients with
AFtreatedwithdifferentantithromboticregimenswhodidnot
have a stroke were not included in the registry. Therefore, the
absence of a cohort or case-control design with patients who
had AF and defined by anticoagulant exposure and subse-
quent stroke incidence measurement precludes assessment of
thepotentialprotectiveeffectofadequateanticoagulation,and
conversely the harm of inadequate anticoagulation.
Third, this registry did not collect Trial of Org 10172 in
Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification during the
study period. Noncardioembolic stroke could possibly have
accounted for some cases, especially among those receiving
therapeutic warfarin (36.0% of warfarin-treated patients) or
NOACs. Fourth, reasons for nonuse of anticoagulation docu-
mented at discharge were used as a proxy for reasons of non-
use prior to stroke. As a result, reasons for no anticoagulation
could not be assessed among deceased patients and were
potentially overestimated or underestimated in survivors of
stroke. It is unlikely that comorbidities or other conditions
that might have influenced eligibility will disappear after the
stroke. Medical records were used rather than the recollec-
tion by patients who might have experienced memory loss or
cognitive impairment after stroke; therefore, reasons for non-
use are less subject to recall bias. Having a stroke substan-
tially changes the context of evaluation for anticoagulation
eligibility; the reasons are likely to be different, with poor
care quality, lack of patient interest, underestimation of
stroke risks, and overestimation of the bleeding risks likely
to be much more frequent in the outpatient setting prior to
stroke. Therefore, the reasons for no oral anticoagulation
could have been overestimated and fewer cases of warfarin
or NOAC nonuse would be justifiable.
Fifth, some patients did not have NIHSS (18.3%) or mRS
(48.0%) scores documented in the medical record. Because it
is inappropriate to impute outcome measures, these patients
were excluded from the stroke severity or functional out-
come models. Excluding missing values might bias this analy-
sis; however, it is unlikely that physicians will report stroke
severity and functional outcomes differently according to
antithrombotic treatment prior to stroke. Sixth, hospitals

participated in this registry based on their level of interest
in quality improvement in stroke care and their capacity to
fulfill the requirements. Data from this registry and these
study results might not be able to be extrapolated to
patients treated in hospitals not participating in this registry
or to patients in other countries. A previous study had dem-
onstrated that patients included in the registry used in this
study are representative of patients with ischemic stroke in
the United States, at least among patients with Medicare
fee-for-service coverage.34 Even though some patients pre-
viously received care at a hospital in this stroke registry,
many more patients may have been receiving outpatient
care at another health care facility prior to their stroke, then
had an ischemic stroke, and then were admitted to a hospi-
tal in this registry. As a result, this study is more reflective of
national patterns of preceding antithrombotic treatment
rather than patterns limited to these hospitals.
Conclusions
Among patients with AF who had experienced an acute ische-
mic stroke, inadequate therapeutic anticoagulation preced-
ing the stroke was prevalent. Therapeutic anticoagulation was
associated with lower odds of moderate or severe stroke and
lower odds of in-hospital mortality.
