SUMMARY
Caloric restriction (CR) stimulates development of
functional beige fat and extends healthy lifespan.
Here we show that compositional and functional
changes in the gut microbiota contribute to a num-
ber of CR-induced metabolic improvements and
promote fat browning. Mechanistically, these ef-
fects are linked to a lower expression of the key
bacterial enzymes necessary for the lipid A biosyn-
thesis, a critical lipopolysaccharide (LPS) building
component.
The
decreased
LPS
dictates
the
tone of the innate immune response during CR,
leading to increased eosinophil infiltration and
anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization in fat
of the CR animals. Genetic and pharmacological
suppression of the LPS-TLR4 pathway or trans-
plantation with Tlr4�/� bone-marrow-derived he-
matopoietic cells increases beige fat development
and
ameliorates
diet-induced
fatty
liver,
while
Tlr4�/� or microbiota-depleted mice are resistant
to
further
CR-stimulated
metabolic
alterations.
These data reveal signals critical for our under-
standing
of
the
microbiota-fat
signaling
axis
during CR and provide potential new anti-obesity
therapeutics.
INTRODUCTION
Caloric restriction (CR) up to 40% of nutritious diet intake re-
duces body weight and total fat amount, delays the onset of
multiple age-associated diseases, and improves metabolic
health (Canto and Auwerx, 2011; De Guzman et al., 2013;
Ocampo et al., 2012). CR is a potent physiological stimulus
that promotes functional beige fat development (Fabbiano
et al., 2016), which contributes to the inguinal subcutaneous
adipose tissue (ingSAT) loss during CR. The CR-induced
browning is concomitant with increased type 2 immune
signaling, which is necessary for the beige fat development
and a number of metabolic improvements caused by CR (Fab-
biano et al., 2016). The intestinal microbiota can influence the
whole-body metabolism by affecting energy balance (Turn-
baugh et al., 2009, 2006; Koren et al., 2012; Liou et al.,
2013; Ridaura et al., 2013; Sekirov et al., 2010; Backhed
et al., 2004; Suarez-Zamorano et al., 2015; Thaiss et al.,
2016), and has profound effects on fat morphology, function,
and amount (Suarez-Zamorano et al., 2015; Chevalier et al.,
2015; Li et al., 2017). These observations indicate the exis-
tence of a microbiota-fat signaling axis; however, the mecha-
nisms, and the microbial signals and functional alterations
causing the phenotypic and morphological changes that regu-
late energy homeostasis of the new host following microbiota
transplantation, remain poorly understood. It is also not clear
whether the gut microbiota affects the metabolic alterations
during CR. Here we demonstrate that microbiota remodeling
is an important contributor of beige fat induction during CR,
and a key factor that promotes the metabolic improvements
caused by CR, including improved insulin sensitivity, glucose
tolerance, and lowered fat gain. Moreover, we provide a
mechanistic explanation of the microbiota-derived signals
that regulate the tone of the innate immune response during
CR, necessary for the CR-induced metabolic alterations.
These data reveal signals critical for our understanding of
the microbiota-fat signaling axis, and suggest new anti-dia-
betes and anti-obesity therapeutics.

 RESULTS
Short-Term Caloric Restriction Changes the Gut
Microbiota Composition
Thirty days of 40% CR, but without malnutrition and lean mass
loss, promotes fat browning, suppresses body weight (BW)
and white fat mass gain, and improves insulin sensitivity (Figures
S1A–S1C) (Fabbiano et al., 2016). This is in part due to the sup-
pressed hepatic glucose production (Barzilai et al., 1998; Barzilai
and Gabriely, 2001; Kelley et al., 1993) and the increased
glucose uptake in the fat (Fabbiano et al., 2016). To investigate
whether short-term CR causes changes in the intestinal micro-
biota, we collected feces at weeks 0, 3, and 6 and postmortem
cecum of CR mice and ad libitum-fed (AL) controls. Profiling of
the microbiota composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, fol-
lowed by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), showed alter-
ations of the microbiota content both in cecum and feces sam-
ples of CR animals (Figures 1A and 1B). This is in line with the
observations that lean human subjects under chronic food re-
striction with adequate nutrition cluster apart from subjects
without dietary restrictions (Griffin et al., 2017). Comparison of
phylum-level proportional abundance showed shifts in both
cecum and feces (Figure 1C), and the results were confirmed
by additional 16S sequencing of an independent set of mice (Fig-
ures S1D–S1H). A heatmap of the significantly changed opera-
tional taxonomic units (OTUs) in the fecal samples revealed a
number of changes within the same families, most notably an in-
crease in Lactobacillaceae and Erysipelotichaceae during CR
and decrease in other Firmicutes families, as well as increased
Bacteroidaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae, the latter repre-
sented by Akkermansia muciniphila (Figures 1D and 1E). Mem-
bers of these families were among the most significantly

 changed OTUs using a Kruskal-Wallis test (Figures S1I and S1J).
Increase in lactobacilli is linked with beneficial metabolic effects
through multiple mechanisms (Fabbiano et al., 2017; Spiljar
et al., 2017), while A. muciniphila negatively correlates with insu-
lin resistance and adiposity (Dao et al., 2015; Chevalier et al.,
2015; Louis et al., 2016; Schneeberger et al., 2015). Opposed
to the observations in CR mice, high-fat diet increases the abun-
dance of Tenericutes (Everard et al., 2014) while decreasing bifi-
dobacteria and verrucomicrobia (Schneeberger et al., 2015).
Together, these results show a progressive shift in lower gut
microbiota composition during energy scarcity, part of which
may be correlated with the loss in adiposity and the increased in-
sulin sensitivity.
CR-Microbiota Transplantation Promotes Metabolic
Improvements and Fat Browning
To investigate the relevance of the microbiota changes during
CR, we transplanted the microbiota from 6-week CR or age-
matched AL control mice to germ-free (GF) mice and confirmed
the shifts in the recipient mice (Figure S2A). CR-microbiota-trans-
planted mice showed lower weight gain compared with the AL-
transplanted controls without changes in food intake and caloric
uptake (Figures S2B–S2D). The CR-microbiota transplantation
was sufficient to improve the glucose tolerance after oral glucose
gavage and to increase the sensitivity to insulin (Figures 2A and
2B). To further investigate the insulin sensitivity, we performed
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in awake and unrestrained
microbiota-transplanted mice. CR-microbiota transplantation
markedly increased the glucose infusion rates needed to main-
tain the clamped glucose levels, and the stimulated rate of
whole-body glucose disappearance levels (Figures 2C and 2D).
To investigate peripheral glucose uptake, we co-administered
2-[14C]deoxyglucose (2[14C]DG) during the clamp. While we
found no changes in quadriceps, gastrocnemius, or soleus mus-
cle and the brain, the 2[14C]DG administration showed an
increased glucose uptake in all adipose tissues of the CR-micro-
biota-transplanted mice, and a suppressed hepatic glucose
production (Figures 2D and 2E). These results were in line
with the positron emission tomography-computed tomography
(microPET-CT) in non-insulin-stimulated conditions, where the
CR-transplanted mice showed increased [18F]fluorodeoxyglu-
cose ([18F]FDG) uptake in the inguinal subcutaneous adipose tis-
sue (ingSAT) (Figures S2E–S2G). CR-transplanted mice showed
no changes in their lean mass, but had decreased fat volume and
mass (Figures 2F and 2G), in line with the increased number of
small multilocular, and a decreased number of large unilocular
adipocytes in the ingSAT depots (Figures 2H and S2I). All these
characteristics are typical of mature beige adipocytes. Indeed,
the CR-transplanted mice had an increased number of UCP1+
cells coupled with markedly enhanced expression of brown fat-
specific markers in ingSAT and, to a lesser extent, in the perigo-
nadal visceral adipose tissue (pgVAT) (Figures 2I, 2J, and S2J).
Type 2 immunity potentiates beige fat development in part by
alternative activation of M2 polarized macrophages (Nguyen
et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2017), possibly through decreased
macrophage-mediated
norepinephrine
degradation
(Fischer
et al., 2017; Pirzgalska et al., 2017; Camell et al., 2017), and/or
suppressed loop of direct M1-mediated inhibition (Chung
et al., 2017). Genetic suppression of type 2 immune signaling
blocks the browning after cold exposure (Qiu et al., 2014) or
CR (Fabbiano et al., 2016). In the ingSAT of the CR-microbiota-
transplanted mice we observed increased levels of the type 2 cy-
tokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 (Figure 2K), suggesting that
same molecular pathways orchestrate the browning during CR
and CR-microbiota transplantation. Accordingly, quantification
of the immune cell populations by flow cytometry demonstrated
enhanced infiltration of eosinophils and CD301+ M2 polarized
macrophages in ingSAT and pgVAT (Figures 2L, 2M, and S2K–
S2M), and a marked decrease in NOS2+ M1 macrophages
(Figure 2N).
We extended our studies to mice kept at thermoneutrality
(Feldmann et al., 2009), and found that CR shifted the micro-
biota composition also at 30�C (Figure S3A). When transplant-
ing this warm CR-altered microbiota to recipient GF mice that
were subsequently also kept at thermoneutrality, we found
decreased BW gain without affecting the food intake, increased
glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, decreased liver,
ingSAT, and pgVAT weights, and smaller adipocytes, along
with increased fat browning (Figures 3A–3D and S3B–S3E).
Compared with the AL CR controls, subjecting GF mice to
CR led to decreased weight gain, but this time due to the
decrease in both muscle and fat, and an improved glucose
tolerance. Remarkably, we could not detect further improve-
ment in insulin sensitivity during CR in absence of microbiota,
nor further increase in the browning levels and cold tolerance,
despite an the increase in the general adipogenesis markers
(Figures 3E–3H and S3F–S3H). Similar effects were seen in an-
tibiotics (Abx)-treated CR mice, where the BW and tissue
weight changes were even less pronounced between the CR
and AL groups (Figures 3I–3L and S3I–S3K). These results
together point out the key contribution of the gut microbiota
in mediating a number of CR-induced metabolic benefits,
including browning.
CR Leads to Functional Gut Microbiota Alterations
To assess the functional diversity of cecal and fecal microbiota,
we performed metagenomics sequencing and functional anal-
ysis using the SEED database. Analysis of overall community
functional composition with PERMANOVA revealed differences
between AL and CR mice in both fecal (p = 0.0095) and cecal
(p = 0.027) samples (Figure 4A). Out of the 35 level-1 subsys-
tems identified, 11 were significantly altered in cecum and 7
in feces. Deeper analysis in cecum and feces samples re-
vealed, respectively, 34 and 23 of the 165 level-2 subsystems,

 205 and 155 level-3 subsystems, and 1,502 and 1,620 out of
10,862 level-4 functions. To further narrow down relevant func-
tional changes, we focused on level-1 subsystems that showed
changes in the same direction in both feces and cecum sam-
ples, and found two that satisfied this criterion. The first was
the ‘‘Arabinose Sensor and Transport’’ module, which was
consistently increased in CR microbiota, likely in response to
increased reliance on arabinose in part of the bacterial popula-
tion during nutrient scarcity (Desai and Rao, 2010). The second
was ‘‘Cell Wall and Capsule,’’ decreased in CR samples (Fig-
ure 4B). This was particularly interesting, since this subsystem
includes biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), known to be
positively correlated with host BW and insulin resistance (Cani
et al., 2007).

 LPS Reconstitution Reverts the Metabolic
Improvements Caused by CR
Life-long CR enriches phylotypes positively correlated with life-
span (Zhang et al., 2013), concomitant with reduced serum
levels of the LPS-binding protein (LBP), manly produced by the
liver. High-fat diet and LPS increase are associated with reduced
core body temperature and lower heat release, coupled to ER
stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Okla et al., 2015). More-
over, IRF3, which signals downstream of the Toll-like receptor
4 (TLR4), promotes inflammation and decreases browning (Ku-
mari et al., 2016). We found that after 30 days of CR, LBP levels
were decreased to similar magnitude as in life-long CR mice (Fig-
ure 4C) and the circulating LPS levels in the CR mice were mark-
edly lower compared with AL controls (Figure 4D), along with
decreased Lbp and Myd88 liver mRNA expression (Figure 4E).
Reconstituting LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) using osmotic mini-
pumps at dose of 300 mg/kg/day was sufficient to completely
revert the CR-mediated increase in the glucose tolerance
without affecting the insulin levels during the test, and diminish
the improved sensitivity to insulin and cold tolerance (Figures
S4A–S4G). LPS replenishment in the CR mice completely pre-
vented the CR-induced browning and the CR-induced increase
in the M2 macrophage polarization and eosinophil infiltration
(Figures S4H–S4J). Since the LPS-reconstituted CR mice
showed 30% higher LPS levels compared with the AL animals,
we included additional control AL and CR mice implanted
with minipumps releasing �33% less LPS at 200 mg/kg/day
(AL LPSlow and CR LPSlow, respectively). While the LPS supple-
mentation did not affect the glucose tolerance and insulin sensi-
tivity in the AL mice, its reconstitution markedly suppressed
these CR-induced metabolic improvements, the fat browning,
and the cold tolerance (Figures 4F–4L), and moderately affected
body, fat, and liver weight (Figures S4K–S4N). These results
suggest that reconstituting LPS prevents a number of metabolic
improvements, as well as the anti-inflammatory type 2 immune
response caused by the lower caloric intake.
Hematopoietic TLR4 Suppression Promotes Beige Fat
Development
In light of the above data, we assumed that the decreased LPS
binding to TLR4 mediates CR-induced browning by modulating
the immune tone. To investigate this intriguing hypothesis, we
exposed mice to high-caloric diet (HCD) and treated them with
the TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095. The treated mice had lower weight
gain compared with the HCD-fed control mice despite the con-
stant food intake, and showed improved glucose tolerance and
insulin sensitivity (Figures 5A–5C and S5A), consistent with ob-
servations in rats (Zhang et al., 2015). In contrast, CLI-095 treat-
ment of Tlr4 knockout (KO) mice neither changed their BW gain
nor the sensitivity to insulin and glucose tolerance (Figures S5B–
S5D). The CLI-095-treated mice were resistant to cold stress
(Figures 5D and S5E) and their fat mass was lowered, while the
lean mass remained constant (Figure 5E). MicroPET-CT showed
increased [18F]FDG uptake in ingSAT and a tendency toward
increased uptake in the pgVAT in the CLI-095-treated mice (Fig-
ures 5F, 5G, S5F, and S5G). Despite the increased glucose up-
take in the fat tissues, the fat volume in CLI-095-treated mice
was reduced compared with the control animals (Figures 5H
and S5H). This was associated with appearance of smaller multi-
locular adipocytes in the ingSAT, and to a lower extent also in the
pgVAT of the CLI-095-treated mice. Accordingly, pharmacolog-
ical TLR4 inhibition led to marked increase in expression of the
browning markers in the ingSAT, evident modestly also in the
pgVAT (Figures 5I, 5J, and S5I). This was accompanied with
increased type 2 cytokine expression in ingSAT of the treated
mice (Figure S5J). These data suggest that pharmacological
suppression of TLR4 signaling promotes adipose tissue brown-
ing and decreased fat accumulation, associated with improved
glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.
To directly test the importance of TLR4 downstream signaling
in regulating the CR-induced browning, we used the Tlr4 KO
mice. In line with the pharmacological inhibition, genetic TLR4
suppression decreased the weight gain and fat to lean mass ratio
compared with the wild-type (WT) controls, and improved the
glucose tolerance and the insulin sensitivity at various time
points (Figures 5K–5M and S5K–S5N). TLR4 deficiency led to a
massive increase in the ingSAT and pgVAT browning (Figures
5N–5P). This conclusion was further corroborated by oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) measurements after isoproterenol stim-
ulation using the Seahorse analyzer. The ingSAT fat depots from
Tlr4 KO mice showed increased OCR at basal conditions, and a
greater response to b-adrenergic stimuli compared with the
corresponding fats from the WT mice (Figure 5Q), suggesting
increased thermogenic capacity. Strikingly, while the Tlr4 KO

 and WT mice showed similar LPS levels, CR of the Tlr4 KO mice
neither further promoted weight loss nor improved their thermo-
genic capacity and browning (Figures 5R and S5O). CR Tlr4 KO
mice showed only mild improvement in the glucose tolerance
compared with AL Tlr4 KO, and no changes in insulin sensitivity
despite the similar microbiota changes that were induced in
response to CR (Figures S6A–S6H). Tlr4 KO mice had increased
eosinophil infiltration and M2 macrophage polarization in the
ingSAT compared with the controls, mimicking the changes
induced by CR (Figures 5S and 5T). These results suggest that
absence of TLR4 signaling is sufficient to induce browning and
improved glycemic control and that it prevents further metabolic
improvements caused by CR, including the enhanced beige fat
development.
Since suppression of the LPS-TLR4 signaling in CR mice is
necessary for the beige fat development and leads to enhanced
eosinophil infiltration and M2 macrophage polarization, we
sought to directly investigate whether suppression of the TLR4
signaling in the bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells would
mediate the fat browning. We therefore transplanted bone
marrow-derived (BMT) cells from the Tlr4 KO donor mice to
lethally irradiated WT or Tlr4 KO recipients (WT BMTKO or KO
BMTKO, respectively), and used WT donor transplantations to
irradiated WT or Tlr4 KO recipients as controls (WT BMTWT or
KO BMTWT, respectively) (Figure S6I) and subjected the mice
to HCD. The Tlr4 KO BM recipients displayed improved glucose
tolerance and insulin sensitivity (Figures 6A and S6J), consistent
with recent observations (Razolli et al., 2015). To investigate the
importance of these cells in the beige fat development, we cold-
exposed the BMT animals and found that all mice receiving BM
cells from Tlr4 KO mice had improved cold tolerance (Figure 6B)
irrespective of the genetic background of the recipients. This
was accompanied by smaller adipocytes with multilocular
appearance in both ingSAT and pgVAT depots of the mice trans-
planted with the Tlr4 KO-derived BM cells and with decreased
total fat gain due to lower weight of ingSAT, and to milder extent
pgVAT (Figures 6C, 6D, S6K, and S6L). Accordingly, all mice
receiving BM from the Tlr4 KO mice displayed increased brown-
ing levels in both white fat depots. Conversely, Tlr4 KO mice
transplanted with WT cells lost most of their browning and their
adipose tissues were comparable with the WT mice (Figures
6E and 6F). There were no changes in the LPS levels between
the groups (Figure S6M). Together, these data demonstrate
that suppression of the TLR4 signaling in the BM-derived cells
is sufficient to promote beige fat development irrespective of
the genetic background of the recipients, and suggest that the
CR-induced browning is mediated by the decreased LPS-
TLR4 signaling restricted to these immune cells.
CR-Induced Suppression of the Key Lipid A Biosynthetic
Enzymes Underlies the Decreased LPS
CR may affect blood LPS levels by regulating its biosynthesis or
by changing the intestinal penetrability. To address the latter, we
measured the thickness of the colon mucin layer, a key contrib-
utor to the gut barrier function. Analysis of colon Alcian blue
staining showed no differences between the groups (Figures
7A and 7B). In addition, 4-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-dextran gavage revealed no changes in the mucosa-to-
blood penetrability, and intectin expression was similar between
the groups (Figures S7A and S7B). In contrast, analysis of the
metagenomics data revealed that Kdo2-lipid A biosynthesis,
necessary for the LPS production, was consistently decreased,
accompanied by suppressed lipid A-Ara4N pathway (Figures
S7D–S7G). Specifically, CR suppressed several critical enzymes
including LpxL, LpxB, LpxL, LpxA, and KdtA (or WaaA), all regu-
lating lipid A production (Figures 7C–7G), and LpxK, a key mem-
brane-bound kinase that phosphorylates lipid A disaccharide to
produce lipid IVA as a rate-limiting step (Wang and Quinn, 2010;
Emiola et al., 2014). Accordingly, both plasma and feces LPS
levels were markedly lower in CR mice (Figures 7H and 7I), sug-
gesting that the suppressed LPS production in the lean mice,
and not the changed intestinal permeability seen after very-
low-calorie diet in obese female subjects (Ott et al., 2017), under-
lies the CR-induced reduced LPS levels. This was reflected by
reduced expression of Lbp and Myd88 in livers of the GF mice
transplanted with CR microbiota (Figure S7H). To investigate

 the potential importance of the decreased LPS phosphorylation
in the browning induction, we used the brush-border enzyme in-
testinal alkaline phosphatase (iAP), which detoxifies and de-
phosphorylates LPS (Bentala et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2010)
and ameliorates several high-fat-diet-induced metabolic disar-
rangements (Kaliannan et al., 2013). Oral supplementation of
iAP decreased LPS levels in both feces and plasma of HCD-
fed mice (Figures 7J and 7K). This led to lower weight gain (start-
ing from the same initial BW), improved glucose tolerance, insu-
lin sensitivity, and cold tolerance of iAP HCD-fed mice without
affecting the food and water intake (Figures 7L, 7M, and S7I–
S7L). Insulin sensitivity was further investigated using hyperinsu-
linemic-euglycemic clamp in awake and unrestrained HCD-fed
mice. iAP administration led to a marked increase in the glucose
infusion rates needed to maintain euglycemia (Figure 7N). While
no changes were observed in 2[14C]DG uptake in quadriceps
muscle and brain (Figure S7K), iAP supplementation increased
glucose uptake in ingSAT and markedly suppressed the hepatic
glucose production (Figure 7O). These results suggest that
suppressed hepatic glucose production and increased glucose
uptake in ingSAT are main drivers of the improved glucose
phenotype after iAP treatment. Since HCD leads to fatty liver,
and TLR4 deficiency in hepatocytes improves hepatic steatosis
after high-fat feeding (Jia et al., 2014), we investigated the liver
morphology in HCD-fed mice treated with CLI-095 or iAP. Both
pharmacological treatments potently ameliorated fatty liver

 compared with HCD-fed controls (Figures 7P–7R, S7M, and
S7N), while the Tlr4�/� BMT experiments showed that the sup-
pressed LPS-TLR4 signaling in both BM cells and hepatocytes
contributed to the reduced HCD-driven liver fat accumulation
(Figures 7S, 7T, and S7O). Finally, despite the increased glucose
uptake, the ingSAT was smaller in size and had smaller multiloc-
ular adipocytes (Figures 7U and 7V), suggesting that iAP pro-
motes browning. Accordingly, the ingSAT of the iAP-treated
mice showed enhanced expression of the type 2 cytokines and
browning markers (Figures 7V and 7W). Together, these data
demonstrate that CR-induced gut microbiota alterations sup-
press lipid A and LPS biosynthesis, leading to fat browning
and a number of systemic metabolic improvements.
DISCUSSION
The weight loss during CR occurs due to the negative energy bal-
ance and is potentiated by the fat browning (Fabbiano et al.,
2016). The microbiota alteration during CR dictates the tone of
the immune response and contributes to the increased brown-
ing, fat loss, and many of the metabolic improvements seen dur-
ing CR. Interestingly, microbiota-depleted WT and GF mice
treated with antibiotics show limited responsiveness to CR,
further pointing to the importance of the CR-induced microbiota
alterations in contributing to the overall metabolic benefits of the
CR. Consistent with the innate immunity-mediated CR-induced
browning, the Tlr4 KO bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells
increase beige fat development in recipient mice irrespective of
their genetic background, while Tlr4 KO mice are resistant to
further improvements of their metabolic status during CR.
These results provide a possible direct link between the func-
tional microbiota changes, the immune system, and the fat
metabolism, and suggest several strategies to promote beige
fat development and improve metabolic outcome. On one
hand, the CR microbiota alone is sufficient to enhance insulin
sensitivity, improve tolerance to glucose and cold, and reduce
fat content, and this effect is at least in part mediated by
browning of the white fat depots. In line with this, fecal micro-
biota transplantation (Eiseman et al., 1958) has regained inter-
est as a treatment option for several pathologies (Khoruts,
2014). On the other hand, the translational importance of our
study can be further exploited by modulating the mechanism
by which CR microbiota promotes browning. Pharmacological
treatment with a TLR4 antagonist phenocopied a number of
CR-induced metabolic improvements and induced browning.
Similarly, mimicking the CR-microbiota changes by detoxifying
LPS through iAP oral supplementation enhanced beige fat
development. Both treatments reduced fatty liver progression
during HCD, which was mediated by LPS-TLR4 signaling in
both hematopoietic cells and hepatocytes. Together, these
data suggest a molecular explanation of the microbiota-im-
mune system-fat signaling axis, and imply the microbiota as a
key player mediating the metabolic benefits of CR with large
therapeutic potential.
Limitations of the Study
Our study shows that the LPS decrease during CR in lean mice is
linked to changes in the rate-limiting enzymes necessary for the
lipid A biosynthesis; however, additional data would be needed
to formally conclude this link. While the decreased LPS levels
in both plasma and feces indeed suggest that the LPS biosyn-
thesis is reduced during CR and iAP treatment, we can’t exclude
that the alterations in the intestinal function after CR below the
detection limit, or after the genetic and pharmacological inhibi-
tion of TLR4 during HCD feeding could contribute to the effects.
We demonstrate that the microbiota alterations during CR are
sufficient to promote the fat browning and the improved glyce-
mic control. This does not rule out that additional mechanisms
operate to further regulate these processes during CR. Finally,
the BMT experiments do not allow discrimination of the bone
marrow-derived cell populations that are mediating the effects
following TLR4 inhibition and after CR, and additional specific
mouse line experiments would be needed to further narrow
this down. We hope that our future work will provide a deeper
understanding of the molecular changes in the immune cells
underlying the CR-induced browning.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animals
Cd45.1+ (B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ, The Jackson Laboratory (Jax) Stock #002014), Tlr4 KO (B6.B10ScN-Tlr4lps-del/JthJ, Jax
Stock #007227; Tlr4�/�) mice and their C57BL/6J controls (WT, Jax Stock #000664) were originally purchased through Charles River.
Germ-free (GF) mice on C57BL/6 background were obtained from the Germ-Free (Clean animal) facility at the University of Bern. The
experiments addressing the CR metabolic effects were reproduced in C57BL/6JRj (Janvier); as well as in Tlr4 KO mice on C57BL/10J
background (C57BL/10ScNJ) obtained through the Swiss Immune Mouse Repository (SwImMR) consortium (Zurich, Switzerland),
and C57BL/10J control mice (obtained through Charles River (Jax Stock #000665), or provided by Prof. Xose
´ R. Bustelo, University
of Salamanca) to confirm the findings (not shown). Mice were kept in a specific pathogen free facility (SPF) in 12 hr day and night
cycles and were fed either standard chow diet (16.2 MJ/kg Gross Energy; 9 kJ% Fat, 33 kJ% Protein, 58 kJ% Carbohydrates,
V1534-727, Ssniff, Germany) high-fat, high-sugar diet (HCD), (22.1 MJ/kg Gross Energy; 45 kJ% Fat, 20 kJ% Protein, 35 kJ% Car-
bohydrates, D12451, Ssniff, Germany) or 60% calorie restricted diet (low caloric diet, LCD) (14.6 MJ/kg Gross Energy; 7.7 MJ/kg
Metabolizable Energy; 11 kJ% Fat, 51 kJ% Protein, 38 kJ% Carbohydrates, S9631-S710, Ssniff, Germany). Animals under caloric
restriction were fed daily with 40% less standard chow diet food than the average eaten by age-matched ad libitum fed mice, and
food was provided each day at 18 hr. Cold exposures were performed at 6�C in a light and humidity controlled climatic chamber (TSE,
Germany) in SPF conditions. Antibiotics (Abx), where indicated, were administered in the drinking water ad libitum and replaced
with freshly prepared cocktails every second day containing 100 mg/mL Neomycin, 50 mg/mL Streptomycin, 100 U/mL Penicillin,
50 mg/mL Vancomycin, 100 mg/mL Metronidazole, 1 mg/mL Bacitracin, 125 mg/mL Ciprofloxacin, 100 mg/mL Ceftazidime (Sigma,

 after weaning, animals were allocated to groups based on their body weight to ensure equal starting points. All mice were sacrificed
after 5 hr fasting. 500 mL of blood was taken from terminally anesthetized mice in tubes with 11 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mL of aprotinin
and 2 mL of DPPIV and plasma stored at �80�C. All animal experiments were approved by the Swiss federal and Geneva cantonal
authorities for animal experimentation (Office ve

METHOD DETAILS
Bacterial 16S Sequencing
These analyses were performed in two independent cohorts of mice and using different sets of techniques. For the first cohort, feces
and cecum DNA was extracted using the QIAmp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen). Two negative extraction controls were performed
by substituting the stool samples with water in the extraction procedure. DNA concentration in the extracts was measured using a
Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit on a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). The V3-4 region of the bacterial
16S rRNA genes (E. coli positions 341-805) was amplified using 1 mL of DNA extract adjusted to 1 ng/mL for samples (undiluted for
negative extraction controls) in a 25 mL volume that contained 12.5 mL KAPA2G Robust HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Bos-
ton, MA, USA) and 0.5 mL each of 10 mM forward primer 341F 50-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-30 and reverse primer 805R 50-GAC
TACHVGGGTATCTAAKCC-30 (Herlemann et al., 2011). The reverse primer contained an additional ambiguous base in comparison
to the original sequence. The PCR conditions included an initial denaturation at 95�C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation
at 95�C for 30 s, annealing at 51�C for 30 s, and extension at 72�C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72�C for 5 min. Each PCR was
performed in triplicate and the products were combined. The pooled sample was run on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) for quality analysis and quantification. The primers from the first round of PCR were removed by digesting 5 mL sam-
ples (containing 9.5-13.9 ng/mL DNA except in negative extraction controls for which DNA concentration was under the detection
level) with 1 unit Exonuclease I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) in a total volume of 10 mL Exonuclease I Reaction Buffer
(New England Biolabs) at 37�C for 30 min. The enzyme was inactivated at 95�C for 15 min. Amplicon barcoding was performed by
re-amplification using 1 mL of Exonuclease I-treated first-round PCR, 15 pmol each of forward primer 50-NNNNNNNNNNTCCTA
CGGGNGGCWGCAG-30 and reverse primer 50- NNNNNNNNNNTGACTACHVGGGTATCTAAKCC-30 in a 20-mL volume of MyTaq
buffer that contained 1.5 units MyTaq DNA polymerase (Bioline, London, UK) and 2 mL of BioStab PCR optimizer (II) (Sigma-Aldrich,
Munich, Germany). For each sample, the forward and reverse primers had the same 10-nt barcode sequence. PCRs were carried out
using the following parameters: pre-denaturation for 2 min at 96�C, followed by eight cycles of 96�C for 15 s, 50�C for 30 s, and 70�C
for 90 s. DNA concentration of amplicons of interest was determined by gel electrophoresis. About 20 ng amplicon DNA of each
sample were pooled (or a 2 mL solution for negative extraction controls) and purified with one volume Agencourt AMPure XP beads
(Beckman Coulter, Nyon, Switzerland) to remove primer dimers and other small mispriming products, followed by an additional pu-
rification using a MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands). About 100 ng of the pooled amplicon DNA was used
to construct a sequencing library using the Ovation Rapid DR Multiplex System 1-96 (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA, USA). The library was
size-selected by gel electrophoresis and sequenced from both ends for 300 cycles on the Illumina MiSeq using MiSeq v3 Reagent Kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at LGC Genomics (Berlin, Germany). Demultiplexed FASTQ files were generated from base-calls using
Illumina’s bcl2fastq v1.8.4 software. Reads with incorrect barcodes, missing barcodes, or conflicting barcode pairs were discarded.
Adapter remnants and primer sequences were removed using proprietary LGC Genomics software. Paired reads were quality filtered
and joined using PEAR v0.9.6 (Zhang et al., 2014) with the following parameters: -m 450 -n 390 -v 50 -q 33 -t 250 -p 0.0001 -u 0.
Merged sequence reads (fastq format) were processed using the default UPARSE v8.1.64 pipeline (Edgar, 2013) that clusters reads
into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity threshold. Maximum expected error threshold (-fastq_maxee E) was set
at 1. Representative sequence of each OTU was classified using the online SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA) v1.2.11 (Pruesse et al.,
2007) with default settings and SILVA taxonomy for classification. Twenty OTUs that did not fit the following criteria: start at positions
6,425-6,427 (positions 357-358 in Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene), end in the 23,439-23,442 range and present >80% identity with
the SILVA SSU SEED alignment sequences were excluded. Eleven OTUs with mean relative abundance >0.1% in the negative
extraction controls were removed from the sample data set. The number of reads per sample was rarefied to 22,504 (lowest count
in any sample).
For the second cohort, bacterial DNA content was extracted using PowerFecal DNA Kit (Qiagen, Ref. 12830-50) and PCR amplified
with barcoded universal bacterial primers targeting variable region V4 of 16SrRNA gene (515F-806R barcoded primers). The stan-
dardized protocol from the earth microbiome project was followed (Caporaso et al., 2011). DNA was amplified with QuantaBio 5Prime
HotMasterMix using 515 forward primer, 806 reverse barcoded primer and 2ng template. The PCR conditions included an initial
denaturation at 94�C for 3’, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94�C for 45’’, annealing at 50�C for 1’, and extension at 72�C
for 90’’, with a final extension at 72�C for 10’. Each PCR was performed in triplicate. The products were combined and quality
checked on an agarose gel. Each PCR amplification was then quantified with Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay with SpectraMax
Gemini XPS microplate reader, and pooled to an equal amount of 200 ng per sample to form the library. The library was purified using
QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Ref. 28104), and sequenced from both ends on Illumina MiSeq (kit v2) to generate 2x250bp
paired-end reads (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Demultiplexed FASTQ files were generated using the MiSeq reporter software using
Qiime version 1.9.1, demultiplexed files were paired with a minimum overlap of 200 reads, and barcodes removed from the sequence.
Sequences were quality filtered with phred score of 33 and chimeric sequences removed using Usearch61. OTUs were identified
e3
Cell Metabolism 28, 907–921.e1–e7, December 4, 2018
 using the pick_open_reference_otus command against the Greengenes 13.8 database clustered at 97%. For the downstream
analysis the number of reads per sample was rarefied to the lowest count in any sample (30000).
Metagenomic Sequencing
Paired-end metagenomic libraries were prepared from 200 ng DNA using TruSeq Nano DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and size
selected at about 350 bp. The pooled indexed library was sequenced in Rapid Run (RR) mode for 2x250+8 cycles on an Illumina
HiSeq 2500 instrument at Fasteris (Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland) using HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 and HiSeq Control Software
2.2.58. Demultiplexed FASTQ files were generated with CASAVA-1.8.2 from on-instrument base-calling by Real-Time Analysis
(RTA) software 1.18.64.0. The trimmomatic package (Bolger et al., 2014) was used to remove bases that correspond to the
standard Illumina adapters. Paired reads were quality filtered and joined using PEAR v0.9.6 (Zhang et al., 2014) with the following
parameters: -m 575 -n 200 -v 25 -t 120 -q 33 -p 0.0001 -u 0.
Metagenomic Functional Analysis
To filter out putative artificial replicate reads we used a home-made script which retains only the longest sequence from those with
identical first 100 bases. DECONSEQ (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011) with R90% coverage and R90% identity was used to remove
sequences matching mouse (Mus musculus) genome data (em_rel_std_mus). Functional assignments of sequences was made using
the SEED database subsystems (levels 1–3) and functional roles (level 4) (Overbeek et al., 2005) by means of SUPER-FOCUS (Silva
et al., 2016) and DIAMOND (Buchfink et al., 2015) with the following parameters: -m 1 -a diamond -mi 80 -ml 30 -db DB_100.
Microbiota Diversity
The Bray-Curtis similarity matrix, based on the square-root-transformed relative abundance of OTUs or gene functions was con-
structed in PRIMER (Primer-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of Bray-Curtis similarity matrices was per-
formed in PRIMER. Ecological indices (diversity, richness) was calculated from the relative abundance of OTUs in PRIMER.
Microbiota Transplantation
To transplant the GF mice with microbiota, 500 mL of freshly extracted cecal contents from either ad libitum or caloric restricted mice
were resuspended in 5 mL of anaerobic PBS and 100 mL of the solution was inoculated by oral gavage at days 0 and 2 into each
mouse. Animals were kept for 7 days in dirty cages from the respective donor group. The colonization was confirmed by qPCR.
Hyperinsulinemic Euglycemic Clamp in Microbiota Transplanted Mice
We took several additional steps to avoid any disruption of the transplanted microbiota. Only single-use materials and solutions were
used for each mouse, and all surgeries and catheters washing were done under ventilated hood with sterilization of the environment
using Virkon S 1% solution (Arovet AG, Dietikon, Switzerland) between each mouse 1 week after the microbiota transfer. Catheters
were implanted 7 days prior to the experiment in the right jugular vein and exteriorized above the neck using vascular access button
(Instech Laboratories Inc, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Washing of the catheters with a sterile heparin/saline solution was performed daily.
Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed in conscious and unrestrained mice. Mice were fasted for 3 hr, followed by a
2-hr infusion of [3-3H] glucose (0.05 mCi/min) (Perkin Elmer, Walthman, MA). Continuous insulin infusion (2.5 mIU/kg body weight/min,
Actrapid, NovoNordisk A/S Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was used for the induction of hyperinsulinemia. At steady state, in vivo insulin-stim-
ulated glucose uptake in tissues was determined by a 10 mCi bolus i.v. injection of 2-[14C] deoxyglucose. After 30 min, mice were
rapidly killed by cervical dislocation and tissues were removed and stored at �80�C until use. Glucose concentration was measured
using the glucose oxidase method (GLU, Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and insulin using an ELISA commercial kit
(CrystalChem Inc., Downers Grove, IL). Measurements of 2-[14C] deoxyglucose-6-phosphate concentration in individual tissues
allows calculation of the glucose utilization index in tissues. 2-[1-3H]deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake measurements were performed
as described in our previous publications (Chevalier et al., 2015; Suarez-Zamorano et al., 2015).
Caloric Uptake
Food intake and feces production over 24 hr was measured for each cage. Feces were subsequently collected, dried, and ground to a
fine powder. Caloric excretion measurement through an oxygen bomb calorimeter and subsequent calculations were performed as
previously described (Chevalier et al., 2015).
Microbiota depletion in AL and CR mice
Antibiotic treatment was performed as previously described (Suarez-Zamorano et al., 2015) and specified in Animals. Five days after
the antibiotics were provided, once food intake was stabilized, caloric restriction was started following the usual protocol.
Pharmacological Treatments of Mice
LPS (either 200 or 300 mg/kg/day, Lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli 0127:B8, ref. L3129, Sigma-Aldrich) was
administered for 28 days using osmotic delivery pumps (model 2004; Alzet) inserted subcutaneously into the backs of animals.
CLI-095 (1 mg/kg/day, ref. tlrl-cli95, Invivogen) was injected i.p. daily for 5 weeks. The relative controls were injected daily with
vehicle (10% DMSO in PBS). Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP from bovine intestinal mucosa, ref. P0114, Sigma-Aldrich) was

 supplemented in drinking water at a concentration of 100 units/mL). Animals were fed with HCD for 7 days before starting treatment
with CLI-095 or iAP. During this initial time, no body weight changes were detected between mice allocated to the different groups.
Metabolic Experiments
Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed after 6 hr fasting by oral gavage of glucose bolus (2g/kg body weight). Insulin tolerance
test was performed after a 5 hr fasting, with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 U/kg (for chow-fed) or 0.75 U/kg (for HCD-fed) insulin
(I9278, Sigma-Aldrich). Insulin during oGTT was measured with the Mouse Insulin ELISA kit (ref. 10-1247-01, Mercodia), following the
manifacturer’s instruction. Body temperature measurements were performed as previously described (Fabbiano et al., 2016). All
metabolic measurements were done 3 (for GF mice) or 4 weeks after starting the respective treatment.
Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT)
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and injected in the venous sinus with 4–5 megabecquerel (MBq) [18F]FDG. Mice were
then left awake at RT during the uptake time of 20 min. 10 min prior to PET scan, mice were subjected to CT scans in a Triumph micro-
PET/SPECT/CT system (TriFoil). Images were obtained at 80 peak kilovoltage (kVp) and 160 mA, and 1,024 projections were ac-
quired during the 360 rotation with a field of view of 71.3 mm (1.73 magnification). After 20 min of [18F]FDG uptake, PET scans
were started for a total duration of 10 min (Fabbiano et al., 2016). The software Osirix (Pixmeo) was used to quantitatively analyze
the datasets and generate pictures.
Histological Analyses
For hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, tissues were excised, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich), paraffin embedded, cut
in 5 mm-thick sections and stained with H&E using standard techniques. Immunohistochemical detection of UCP1 was performed on
paraffin section using a standard protocol with the following changes: citrate buffer antigen retrieval in defrost-mode microwave for
15’; blocking for 60 min at RT with 2% BSA; overnight incubation at 4�C with primary rabbit anti-UCP1 antibody (Pierce PA1-24894,
1:100) and 450secondary antibody incubation (Goat anti-Rat IgG (H+L) Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate, Thermo
Fisher Scientific A-11006, 1:500) For mucin layer thickness measurement, freshly excised colons were fixed in Carnoy for 4 hr at
room temperature and then stored in ethanol until processing. After embedding and cutting in 5 mm-thick sections, samples were
stained with Alcian Blue and counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red-Aluminum. The mucin layer was quantified blindly by taking hun-
dreds of measurements, using the Metamorph software, throughout the whole colon length in regions containing fecal masses (Desai
et al., 2016).
RNA Extraction, Retrotranscription and Real-Time PCR
Frozen tissues were placed in 2 mL eppendorf tubes containing 1 mL Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and mechanically disgregated
using the bead-based TissueLyser equipment (Qiagen) by shaking for 30 s at 30 Hz in presence of one bead per tube. After brief
centrifugation to remove tissue debris (3 min at 2000 RPM at 4�C), 300 mL chloroform were added, samples were shaken and centri-
fuged for 10 min at 10000 RPM at 4�C. The chloroform phase was collected, mixed with 600 mL isopropanol and centrifuged again as
before. The pellet obtained was washed twice with 70% ethanol and finally resuspended in 50 mL PCR-grade water. For retrotran-
scription, 1 mg RNA was used per sample using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). qPCR were
performed on a LightCycler 480 machine (Roche) with SYBR Green-based detection (Roche). The primer sequences are shown in the
Key Resources Table.
Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR)
Inguinal adipose pads were excised and washed in fresh-made ice-cold respiration buffer (2.5 mM glucose, 4 mM KCl, 115 mM NaCl,
20 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, at pH 7.4) supplemented with 2% fatty acid-free BSA.
After removing non-adipose material and excess of lipids, tissues were cut into 2.5-5 mg pieces using a 2.5 mm biopsy punch avoid-
ing visible vasculature. After two additional washes without fatty acid-free BSA, tissue biopsies were placed in Islet Capture Plates
and covered with the screen and 450 mL of respiration buffer supplemented with 25 mM HEPES. The plate was allowed to equilibrate
for 45 min at 37�C without CO2 before reading in a Seahorse Analyzer (model XFe24, Seahorse Bioscience) (Fabbiano et al., 2016).
The software was programmed for 4 cycles of 3 min mix; 2 min rest; 3 min measurements in basal and stimulated conditions (10 mM
Isoproterenol, Sigma-Aldrich).
Flow Cytometry and Characterization of Hematopoietic Cell Populations
Primary stromal vascular fractions (SVF) from adipose tissues were prepared as following: mice were sacrificed and the inguinal fat
pads quickly excised and placed in cold PBS. After removal of the lymph nodes, fat tissues were digested for 30 min in collagenase I
(4 mg/mL in DMEM) at 37�C. Samples were subsequently centrifuged, the pellet was resuspended in DMEM and filtered through a
0.45 mm mesh and centrifuged again. Single cells preparations were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with
0.1% BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and stained either with rat monoclonal anti-F4/80 (Clone A3-1, cat # ab105155, 1:200, Abcam),
rat monoclonal anti-CD11b (Clone M1/70, cat # 561114, 1:200, BD Biosciences), and rat monoclonal anti-CD301 (MGL1/MGL2)
(Clone LOM-14, cat # 145705, 1:400, BioLegend) for macrophage stainings; rat monoclonal anti-CD45 (Clone 104, cat #558702,
1:200, BD Biosciences) or rat monoclonal anti-CD11b (Clone M1/70, cat # 561114, 1:200, BD Biosciences) and rat monoclonal

 anti-Siglec F (Clone E50-2440, cat # 562068, 1:200, BD Biosciences) for eosinophil staining. All centrifuge steps were performed at
4�C for 5 min at 1700 RPM. Data were acquired using a Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed with FlowJo v10
software. After gating out dead cells and doublets, macrophages were identified as CD11b+F4/80+ and eosinophils as CD45+
Siglec-F+ cells (Sun and Trajkovski, 2014; Trajkovski et al., 2012; Fabbiano et al., 2016).
Endotoxin Measurement
Serum endotoxin was determined with either the LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation kit (Pierce) or with an Endosafe-PTS ma-
chine (Charles River Microbial solutions) using 0.005 EU/mL cartridges. In all cases, sera were diluted 1:10-1:100 in pyrogen-free
conditions and inactivated for 10 min at 70�C. Spiking and recovery rates were used to confirm the absence of inhibition in the tested
samples. Fecal samples were measured with the Chromogenic Kit as above with a modified protocol from (Kim et al., 2012): fecal
pellets were placed in 10 mL in a pyrogen-free tube and sonicated for 60 min , then centrifugated at 400 g for 15 min , filtrated through
a 0.22 mm filter, diluted 1:1000 in pyrogen-free water and inactivated for 10 min at 70�C. Samples were then assayed following the
standard kit protocol.
Bone Marrow Transplantations (BMT)
8-week-old recipient WT CD45.1 and Tlr4–/– mice (which possess the CD45.2 variant) were lethally irradiated with 1000 rads. 24 hr
after, animals were reconstituted via tail vein injection with 5 x 106 bone marrow hematopoietic cells collected from donor mice. Mice
were treated with Baytril 10% (6 mL/L drinking water) for the following two weeks to prevent infections. Five weeks after tail vein in-
jection, the reconstitution was confirmed by analyzing the presence of CD45.1 or CD45.2 in peripheral blood of recipient mice. An-
imals were kept under HCD and all in vivo experiments were carried out 7-8 weeks after bone marrow transplant.
Hyperinsulinemic Euglycemic Clamp
Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed in conscious, unrestrained, catheterized mice at the glucose- insulin clamp
platform, University of Geneva. Seven days before the experiment, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane, and a silastic catheter
(0.012 inch inner diameter) was surgically implanted in the right jugular vein and exteriorized above the neck using vascular
access button (Instech Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). Mice were fasted for 5 hr before the start of the experiment
(t = 0 min). At t = �120 min, an infusion of [1-3H] glucose (0.05 Ci per min) (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) was initiated. After
120 min, blood samples were collected from the tail vein to measure basal blood glucose and plasma insulin as well as to calculate
the rate of endogenous glucose appearance (EndoRa) and glucose disposal (Rd) at basal state. At t = 0 min, a continuous insulin
infusion (2.5 mIU per kg body weight per min) (NovoRapid, Novo Nordisk Pharma, Zurich, Switzerland) was used to induce
hyperinsulinemia. The infusion of [3-3H] glucose was increased to 0.1 Ci per min and 50% glucose was infused to maintain target
euglycemia (120 mg per dL) (glucose infusion rate, GIR). At steady state, insulin- stimulated glucose uptake in tissues in vivo was
determined by using a 10 Ci bolus injection of 2-[14C]deoxyglucose (2-[14C]DG) (PerkinElmer). After 30 min, mice were killed by cer-
vical dislocation and tissues were removed and stored at �80�C until use. [3-3H]glucose and 2-[14C]DG specific activities were
determined in deproteinized blood samples. Plasma insulin was measured by ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). EndoRa under
an insulin-stimulated state was determined by subtracting steady-state GIR from Rd. Measurements of 2-[14C]deoxyglucose-6-
phosphate concentration enabled calculation of the glucose utilization index of individual tissues.
Intestinal Permeability Assay
Dextran-FITC (4 kDa, 10 mL/g BW, Ref. 46944-500MG-F, Sigma-Aldrich) was gavaged to mice in the morning. Animals were subse-
quently fasted and 4 hr later 30 mL of blood were collected from the tail. After centrifugation to obtain serum, 15 mL of each sample was
diluted to 100 mL with water and samples were placed in a black bottom 96-well plate. A standard curve was obtained by serial
dilutions of the stock dextran-FITC and concentrations were calculated by detecting fluorescence at 525 mm.
Liver Triglycerides Detection
For each mouse, 50 mg of liver tissue were incubated in methanol/chloroform mix (25 mL and 200 mL, respectively) for 4 hr at 40�C
shaking. The chloroform phase was subsequently evaporated by centrifuging samples in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator (Eppen-
dorf) at room temperature for 1 hr. Samples were then resuspended in 70% ethanol and incubated at 50�C for 30 min. Triglyceride
determination was then performed using the Serum Triglyceride Determination Kit (Cat. TR-0100, Sigma Aldrich) using water as blank
control and a glycerol standard solution for the standard curve (Cat. G7793, Sigma Aldrich) following the manufacturer instructions.
QUANTIFICATIONS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Unless otherwise specified in the figure legends, significance was calculated using non-paired two tailed Student’s t test. For all fig-
ures, *p % 0.05, **p % 0.01, ***p % 0.001. Error bars show standard deviation, unless otherwise stated. Sample sizes and animal
numbers were chosen based on power calculations of 0.8. All experiments, except for 16S and metagenomic study, were indepen-
dently performed at least three times without blinding, and representative values from one experiment are shown. No animals or
values were excluded from the analysis. To assess differences in microbiota composition between pre-defined groups of samples,
we used permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, PRIMER) of the Bray-Curtis similarity matrix. In addition,

 Wilcoxon rank-sum and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to assess statistical significance of differences in the proportion of
individual taxa or gene functions between pre-defined groups of samples. Statistical significance was set at the 95% confidence level
(p < 0.05) and no correction was applied for multiple testing.
