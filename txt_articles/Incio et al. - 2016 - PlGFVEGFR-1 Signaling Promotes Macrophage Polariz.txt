Abstract
Purpose: Obesity promotes pancreatic and breast cancer pro-
gression via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Although
obesity is associated with increased systemic levels of placental
growth factor (PlGF), the role of PlGF in obesity-induced tumor
progression is not known. PlGF and its receptor VEGFR-1 have
been shown to modulate tumor angiogenesis and promote
tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment and activity.
Here, we hypothesized that increased activity of PlGF/VEGFR-1
signaling mediates obesity-induced tumor progression by aug-
menting tumor angiogenesis and TAM recruitment/activity.
Experimental Design: We established diet-induced obese
mouse models of wild-type C57BL/6, VEGFR-1 tyrosine kinase
(TK)-null, or PlGF-null mice, and evaluated the role of PlGF/
VEGFR-1 signaling in pancreatic and breast cancer mouse models
and in human samples.
Results: We found that obesity increased TAM infiltration,
tumor growth, and metastasis in pancreatic cancers, without
affecting vessel density. Ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling pre-
vented obesity-induced tumor progression and shifted the
tumor immune environment toward an antitumor pheno-
type. Similar findings were observed in a breast cancer
model. Obesity was associated with increased systemic PlGF,
but not VEGF-A or VEGF-B, in pancreatic and breast cancer
patients and in various mouse models of these cancers.
Ablation of PlGF phenocopied the effects of VEGFR-1-TK
deletion on tumors in obese mice. PlGF/VEGFR-1-TK dele-
tion prevented weight gain in mice fed a high-fat diet, but
exacerbated hyperinsulinemia. Addition of metformin not
only normalized insulin levels but also enhanced antitumor
immunity.
Conclusions: Targeting PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling reprograms
the tumor immune microenvironment and inhibits obesity-
induced acceleration of tumor progression. Clin Cancer Res; 22(12);

Introduction
Excess body weight has become a major public health problem
worldwide (1). Furthermore, a number of large-scale studies have
demonstrated that obesity leads to an increase in cancer-related
mortality in multiple cancer types including pancreatic and
breast (2–4). However, the mechanisms underlying obesity-
induced tumor progression are not completely understood (5).
An excessive gain in adipose tissue in obesity is associated with
angiogenesis, inflammation, and immune cell infiltration (6–9).
Similarly, obesity may affect the vasculature and immune cell
infiltration in cancer to facilitate tumor progression (10, 11).
We and others have shown that VEGFR-1 is expressed on
endothelial cells (EC) and macrophages. Binding of VEGF and
placental growth factor (PlGF) to VEGFR-1 promotes tumor
angiogenesis, and stimulates the recruitment and/or activation
(e.g., cytokine production) of tumor-associated macrophages

 (TAM; refs.12–17). However, the role of VEGFR-1 in tumor
progression remains controversial, with some, but not all studies
showing an effect of VEGFR-1 in promoting tumor growth and
systemic metastasis in mouse models (12, 14, 18, 19). A recent
study, in particular, demonstrated a specific effect of VEGFR-1 in
metastasis-associated macrophages (12). In addition, VEGFR-1
signaling may regulate energy metabolism, as mice genetically
deficient for PlGF gain less weight on a high-fat diet (HFD) than
wild-type (WT) animals (20), but develop insulin resistance and
hyperinsulinemia (21). These findings indicate that VEGFR-1
activity may have important roles in both tumor and adipose
tissue, making it a potential target in cancers specifically in the
obesity setting.
In this study, we evaluated whether VEGFR-1 signaling med-
iates the adipose tissue expansion and accelerated tumor growth
in obesity, and whether this occurs via augmented angiogenesis
and immune cell recruitment/activation. For this purpose, we
used murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and
breast cancer models orthotopically implanted in syngeneic lean
and obese WT or VEGFR-1 tyrosine kinase (TK) knockout
(Flt1TK–/–) mice. Specifically in obese mice, VEGFR-1-TK deletion
led to a reduction in tumor progression associated with a shift in
tumor cytokine profile and TAM polarization toward the M1
phenotype. Furthermore, VEGFR-1-TK deletion prevented body
weight gain in mice fed HFD. However, this was associated with
worsened hyperinsulinemia. Metformin not only normalized
insulin levels but also further improved the effects of VEGFR-1-
TK ablation on tumor progression and the immune environment.
In addition, we assessed which ligands, PlGF or VEGFs, are
implicated in the effects of VEGFR-1 in tumors. As mentioned
above, PlGF has been shown to regulate tumor angiogenesis,
immune cell infiltration, and tumor progression and, important-
ly, preclinical and clinical evidence suggests a relationship
between PlGF and obesity (20, 22–24). We found that plasma
PlGF but not VEGF-A or VEGF-B was associated with obesity in
PDAC and breast cancer patient samples as well as multiple
mouse models. Consistent with this, PlGF-null mice (Plgf�/�)
phenocopied Flt1TK-/� mice on improving the immune environ-
ment, systemic metabolism, and reducing tumor growth in the
obese setting.
With the majority of pancreatic and breast cancer patients being
overweight or obese at diagnosis (4, 25, 26), uncovering potential
therapeutic targets within the mechanisms associating obesity
with worsening cancer prognoses is the first step toward devel-
oping remedies that could disrupt this association and signifi-
cantly improve patient outcome. This study describes the mechan-
isms by which PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling mediates obesity-induced
pancreatic and breast cancer progression.
Materials and Methods
Flt1TK�/�, Plgf�/�, ob/ob, C57BL/6, and FVB mice were used. At
6/7 weeks of age, all mice except ob/ob switched from standard
chow to either low- (10%) or high-fat (60%) diet. At 10 weeks, we
evaluated glucose and insulin tolerance, weighed fat pads. Then,
we implanted PAN02, E0771 (C57BL/6), or AK4.4 (FVB) tumors.
Diet was maintained. Three weeks later, tumor burden, immune
cell infiltration, inflammatory and metabolic markers in tumors,
and plasma levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
and angiogenic/inflammatory factors were determined.
Metformin 300 mg/kg (drinking water) was administered to
some animals.
Using human samples, a correlation between body mass index
(BMI) or visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and systemic levels of PlGF
and VEGF-A was determined in 73 pancreatic cancer patients and
61 breast cancer patients.

Results
Obesity alters the tumor immune microenvironment and
promotes disease progression
As reported previously (27, 28), we observed that diet-induced
obesity promotes tumor progression in PAN02 pancreatic
tumors. In this model, the tumor weight (Fig. 1A) and metastatic
burden (Fig. 1B) were approximately twice as high in obese mice
than in lean at 3 weeks after tumor implantation. This was
associated with increased tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 1C) and
reduced apoptosis in tumors (Fig. 1D). Despite no increase in
tumor vessel density in obese mice (Supplementary Fig. S1A),
obesity was associated with increased infiltration of TAMs
(Fig. 2A) and expression of protumor cytokines IL1b, IL4, and
IL5 (trend for IL10) in tumors (Fig. 3D). We also observed an
increase in IL2, but no difference in the other tumor-associated
cytokines measured (IL6, TNFa, IL12, INFg, CXCL-1; not shown).
Taken together, we found that obesity does not affect vessel
density in tumors, but is associated with TAM infiltration,
increased expression of M2 cytokines, and accelerated tumor
progression.
Ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling prevents obesity-induced
tumor progression without affecting blood vessels of
recruitment of immune cells
Immunosuppressive (M2-like) TAMs have been shown to
promote tumor progression (29). We and others have uncovered
a role for VEGFR-1 signaling in the recruitment and activity of
TAMs (12, 14). Therefore, we evaluated whether ablation of
Translational Relevance
With the current worldwide obesity epidemic, the majority
of pancreatic and breast cancer patients are either overweight
or obese at diagnosis. Importantly, obesity is associated with
poor prognosis in these patients. Hence, uncovering the cel-
lular mechanisms underlying this poor outcome is imperative.
We revealed a significant correlation between plasma placental
growth factor (PlGF) and adiposity in pancreatic and breast
cancer patients and described how PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling
contributes to obesity-induced tumor progression using clin-
ically relevant mouse models. We found that blocking the
PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling axis is effective in obese but not in
lean condition. Therefore, anti-VEGFR-1 agents may prove
therapeutically beneficial in pancreatic and breast cancer
patient populations stratified by body mass index. On the
other hand, ablation of PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling worsened the
impaired systemic glucose metabolism associated with obe-
sity, which could be reverted by the antidiabetic drug metfor-
min. Controlling the metabolic status of patients may enhance
the clinical translation of an anti-PlGF/VEGFR-1 strategy.

 VEGFR-1 signaling could prevent the increased infiltration of
TAMs in obese mice and obesity-accelerated tumor progression.
For this purpose, we used Flt1TK–/– mice lacking the signaling
domain of VEGFR-1 receptor (30). PAN02 tumors grown in
Flt1TK–/– lean mice were similar in size to tumors grown in WT
lean mice. However, tumors grown in Flt1TK–/– obese mice were
significantly smaller compared with those in obese WT mice
(Fig. 2B). Similarly, ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling reduced the
number of mesenteric metastases per animal in obese but not lean
mice (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, there was a trend toward a reduction
in both the incidence of mesenteric metastasis (i.e., number of
mice with metastasis; Fig. 2D, P ¼ 0.064) and the extent of
retroperitoneal abdominal wall invasion (Fig. 2E, P ¼ 0.09) in
obese Flt1TK–/–mice compared with obese WT. The loss of body
weight from the time of implantation until tumor extraction (a
measure of health and systemic disease burden, in an extreme
case, cachexia) was also significantly improved in obese Flt1TK–/–
mice (approximately four times less body weight loss than obese
WT mice; Fig. 2F). Consistent with reduced tumor progression,
tumor cell proliferation was reduced in VEGFR-1-TK deletion in
obese mice (Fig. 2G), despite no change in apoptosis (Fig. 4H).
Interestingly, ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling did not affect the
number of CD45þ leukocytes, CD11bþF4/80þ TAMs (Fig. 2A),
NK, CD4þ, CD8þ, or T regulatory lymphocytes (Fig. 4F) in tumors
in either lean or obese mice. Considering that the expression of
VEGFR-1 in tumor tissues is not restricted to TAMs, but also
extends to ECs, and that VEGFR-1 can regulate tumor angiogen-
esis, we determined whether the observed effects on tumor
progression could be related to inhibition of angiogenesis. We
confirmed that both EC and macrophages express VEGFR-1 in
vitro, with tumor cell lines showing comparatively lower levels of
expression (Fig. 3A). However, VEGFR-1-TK deletion was not
associated with changes in tumor vessel density or hypoxia
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Taken together our data reveals a role
for VEGFR-1 in obesity-induced tumor progression that does not
appear to be via modulation of TAM infiltration or angiogenesis.
Ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling reverts the obesity-associated
abnormal tumor immune environment and reprograms TAMs
Although the number of TAMs did not appreciably change in
with VEGFR-1-TK deletion in obese mice, we found that VEGFR-1
appeared to be predominantly associated with TAMs in vivo, with
approximately 50% of these cells expressing VEGFR-1 in PAN02
tumors (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3A). This suggests that
VEGFR-1 might play a role in TAM activity. In fact, it was recently
shown that VEGFR-1 regulates TAM inflammatory response with-
out affecting infiltration of these cells in tumors (12). Thus, we
determined whether the TAM phenotype and the immune envi-
ronment was altered in Flt1TK–/– mice. We found that VEGFR-1-TK
deletion in obese animals was associated with upregulation of M1
genes and concomitant downregulation of M2 genes including
Il1bb and Il10 in PAN02 tumors (Fig. 3C). Subsequently, at the
protein level, we confirmed a reduction in protumor M2 cytokines
IL10, IL4, IL5, and of IL1b in tumor tissue (Fig. 3D), and of IL1b
and IL2 (trend for IL10, P ¼ 0.13) in plasma (Supplementary
Table S1) in obese Flt1TK–/– mice. IL1b, in particular, which
showed the most dramatic change (50% decrease in obese
Flt1TK–/– vs. obese WT mice), was robustly expressed by 65% to

 80% of TAMs and colocalized with the expression of VEGFR-1
in these cells (Supplementary Figs. S3A, S3B and Supplementary
Table S2): about 75% to 90% of VEGFR-1-positive TAMs coex-
pressed IL1b, whereas about 55% to 70% of IL1b-positive TAMs
coexpressed VEGFR-1. This leads to a total of 40% to 50% of all
TAMs being positive for both VEGFR-1 and IL1b. In addition,
obese WT animals tended to have increased expression of IL1b in
TAMs compared with their lean counterparts, but this difference
was abrogated in Flt1TK–/– mice (Supplementary Fig. S3A and
Supplementary Table S2). Consistent with the expression of M1/
M2 cytokines, in tumors from obese Flt1TK–/– mice, we observed
an enrichment of M1-TAMs (F4/80þCD86þ and F4/80þLy6Cþ)
within the leukocyte (CD45þ) population compared with tumors
in obese WT mice (Fig. 3E), indicating a shift in TAM phenotype.
Finally, we also found a decrease in the gene expression of
immune checkpoint receptors/ligands such as Ctla4 (9-fold) and
Pdcd1lg2 (PD-L2) (4-fold) in obese Flt1TK–/– mice, suggesting
alleviation of T-cell exhaustion (31; Fig. 4G). Collectively, these
findings show that ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling in obese mice
shifts TAMs toward an M1 phenotype, and promotes antitumor
immunity.
Ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling prevents weight gain,
but the effect on tumor progression is not dependent on its
metabolic effects
Blockade of the VEGFR-1 ligand PlGF has been shown to affect
adipose tissue expansion (20). As prevention of obesity itself

 whether VEGFR-1-TK deletion attenuates body weight gain.
Indeed, we found that Flt1TK–/– mice on a HFD (but not on a
low-fat diet) gained significantly less body weight than WT mice
(body weight at the time of tumor implantation in Fig. 4A, body
weight gain kinetics in Supplementary Fig. S4A). The reduction
in weight gain was associated with reduced perigonadal fat and
adipocyte size (Supplementary Figs. S4B and S4C). Remark-
ably, these effects in adipose tissue occurred without a reduc-
tion in the number of leukocytes, macrophages, macrophage-
rich crown-like structures, or vessel density (Supplementary
Figs. S4D–S4J), similarly to what was observed in the tumor
setting. To rule out the possibility that the effect of VEGFR-1
signaling on tumor progression could be solely due to changes
in body weight, we performed body weight–matched (Flt1TK–/–
mice with the same body weight as obese WT at the time of
tumor implantation) subset group analysis. We still found
significantly decreased tumor growth in body weight–matched
Flt1TK–/– mice obese mice compared with WT obese mice
(Supplementary Fig. S5A). Similar findings were observed for
mesenteric and wall metastases (Supplementary Figs. S5B and
S5C), and weight loss (cachexia; Supplementary Fig. S5D). In
fact, the body weights of tumor-bearing obese WT and Flt1TK–/–
mice were similar at the end of the experiment, because WT
mice lost body weight whereas Flt1TK–/– mice maintained it
(Supplementary Fig. S5E). These results indicate that blockade
of VEGFR-1 signaling induces body weight–independent effects
on the tumor microenvironment.
Ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling aggravates glucose metabolism
We found that despite preventing weight gain, VEGFR-1-TK
deletion in obese mice (but not in lean) led to elevated fasting
glucose level and impaired glucose tolerance test (GTT; Fig. 4B;
Supplementary
Fig.
S6A).
Interestingly,
insulin
tolerance
remained similar between the two genotypes in obese mice
(Supplementary Fig. S6B). Of note, these changes in glucose
metabolism were not due to macrophage infiltration, altered
pancreatic b-cell, insulin production, or an overall change in
pancreatic tissue mass (Supplementary Fig. S6C–S6G). We then
investigated whether the altered systemic metabolism observed
in obese Flt1TK–/– mice also affects tumor metabolism upon

 tumor inoculation. In PAN02-bearing mice, we observed
that Flt1TK–/– mice presented with increased plasma insulin
(Fig. 4C) compared with WT animals. The elevation of insulin
was associated with increased phosphorylation of insulin
receptor (p-IR) and IGF-1 receptor (p-IGF-1R) in PAN02
tumors (Supplementary Fig. 7A). These findings were associ-
ated with decreased expression of gluconeogenic genes and
decreased autophagy in tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8A and
S8B), but with no major changes in genes involved in glycolysis
or lipid/protein metabolism (not shown). Collectively, these
results indicate that ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling induces
adverse effects on systemic metabolism in obese mice, which
may have an impact on local tumor metabolism.
Metformin alleviates hyperinsulinemia in Flt1TK–/– obese mice
and further improves the immune tumor microenvironment
To ameliorate the metabolic aberrations of VEGFR-1-TK dele-
tion in PAN02-bearing obese mice, we administered the antidi-
abetic drug metformin. As anticipated, metformin prevented the
increase in insulin levels observed with VEGFR-1-TK deletion (Fig.

 4C). In addition, we and others have shown that metformin can
also affect tumor progression (32–34). Combined VEGFR-1-TK
deletion and metformin led to the lowest PAN02 tumor weight in
obese mice (Fig. 4D) and these tumors displayed increased
perfusion, despite unaltered vessel density in either tumor (Fig.
4E) or adipose tissue (Supplementary Fig. S8C). Similar to what
was observed in our previous study with anti-VEGFR2 antibody
(35), the increased vessel perfusion in the combination group was
associated with increased recruitment of cytotoxic CD8þ T cells
(trend for NK cells; Fig. 4F). In addition, downregulation of the
immune checkpoint markers CTLA-4 and PD-L2 by VEGFR-1-TK
deletion was maintained in the combination group (Fig. 4G).
These effects of the combination therapy on the immune envi-
ronment were associated with increased tumor cell apoptosis
compared with VEGFR-1-TK deletion alone (Fig. 4H). Interest-
ingly, metformin restored the expression of major gluconeogenic
genes that were downregulated by VEGFR-1-TK deletion in obese
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8A), although no changes were seen
in AMPK/ACC activation (Supplementary Fig. S8D) or IR/IGF-1
signaling (not shown). Taken together, our findings indicate that
in addition to normalizing systemic metabolism, metformin can
be helpful in restoring the abnormal tumor vasculature and
immunity in obese Flt1TK–/– mice and in inhibiting tumor
progression.
Ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling exerts similar
effects in breast cancer
Next, we determined whether the effects of VEGFR-1 blockade
in obesity could be seen in another tumor type. Similar to PAN02,
VEGFR-1-TK deletion prevented E0771 breast cancer progression
in obese, but not lean animals. Lung metastases were significantly
decreased by ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling in obese animals
(Fig. 5A and B), even though there was no effect on primary tumor
growth (Supplementary Fig. S9A). Body weight loss was also
significantly reduced in obese Flt1TK–/– mice (Fig. 5C). Again,
similar to PAN02, we observed that VEGFR-1-TK deletion pro-
duced no effect on vessel density, hypoxia markers, or immune
cell infiltration in tumors of obese mice (Supplementary Figs. S9B
and S9C). We found no change in tumor levels of IL4, IL5, or
IL10 but instead observed an effect on other protumor M2
markers, IL6 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9; ref.36;
Supplementary Fig. S9D and S9E): obesity promoted IL6 and
MMP-9 expression in tumors, and VEGFR-1-TK deletion
decreased expression of these markers in obese but not lean
mice. In addition, similar to PAN02 model, ablation of VEGFR-
1 signaling prevented body weight gain in obese but not lean
animals (Fig. 5D), and was associated with increased systemic
insulin levels (Fig. 5E) and increased activation of p-IGF-1R at
the tumor level (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Taken together, we
observed similar effects of VEGFR-1-TK deletion in the obese
setting in two different cancer types.
Obesity is associated with increased systemic PlGF levels in
pancreatic and breast cancer patients as well as in preclinical
mouse models
PlGF and VEGF-A are ligands of VEGFR-1 with a role in tumor
progression (37). Plasma levels of PlGF and VEGF-A were mea-
sured in PDAC (n ¼ 73) and breast cancer (n ¼ 61) patients and
were correlated with BMI or, in the case of breast cancer, with VAT.
We found that PlGF (r ¼ 0.35 and 0.45 for BMI and VAT), but not
VEGF-A (r ¼ 0.09 and �0.02 for BMI and VAT), correlated with
adiposity in both PDAC and breast cancer patients (Fig. 6A). We
then confirmed that plasma PlGF was also elevated in WT obese
mice compared with lean mice in the PAN02 and E0771 tumor
models, as well as in an additional PDAC tumor model
(AK4.4; Fig. 6Bi, Supplementary Fig. S10A). Of note, we observed
a similar elevation in plasma PlGF in both diet-induced obesity
and genetically obese leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob; Supplementary
Fig. S10A). Consistent with human data, VEGF-A was not
increased in plasma (systemic expression) in WT obese mice
compared with lean mice in both PAN02 and E0771 models
(Fig. 6Bii). On the other hand, the expression of VEGF-A in tumors
(local expression; Fig. 6Bii) significantly increased in Flt1TK–/–
mice as compared with corresponding WT mice in both tumor
models. However, the increase in VEGF-A levels was essentially
the same in lean and obese mice. Conversely, another VEGFR-1
ligand, VEGF-B, was increased in circulation in obese mice in the
PAN02 model, but not in the E0771 model (Supplementary Fig.
S10B). Most importantly, in Flt1TK–/– mice, plasma PlGF, but not
VEGF-A or VEGF-B, was dramatically increased compared with
WT in both lean and obese settings (more than 10-fold increase in
obese PAN02-bearing mice; (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Fig. S10B).
This indicates that signaling via VEGFR-1 is particularly associated
with PlGF rather than VEGFs in the models used. Taken together,
our data shows that PlGF is increased in obese mice and patients,
and may mediate the obesity-induced VEGFR-1–dependent
effects in tumors.
PlGF deletion reproduces the findings of
VEGFR-1-TK deletion in obese mice
To confirm that PlGF is responsible for the observed metabolic
and tumor effects of VEGFR-1 signaling, we implanted PAN02
tumors in obese WT and Plgf–/– mice. Similar to the findings in the
Flt1TK–/– background, tumors grown in Plgf–/– obese mice were
significantly smaller compared with those grafted in obese WT
mice (Fig. 6C). The number of TAMs, CD4þ, CD8þ, and T-
regulatory lymphocytes were not altered by PlGF ablation in
obese mice (Fig. 6D), but instead we observed an increased
enrichment of M1-TAMs (F4/80þCD86þ) in obese Plgf–/– mice,
similar to that in obese Flt1TK–/– mice (Fig. 6E). Of note, PAN02
and E0771 cells cultured in vitro had no detectable production of
PlGF, whereas secreted VEGF-A and VEGF-B (Fig. 6B and Supple-
mentary Fig. S10B, right columns.), suggesting that the stroma has
a substantial contribution to PlGF expression in vivo compared
with other VEGFR-1 ligands. Finally, and again similar to what we
observed in obese Flt1TK–/– mice, weight gain in high-fat fed (but
not low-fat fed), and consequently body weight at the time of
tumor implantation were both reduced in Plgf–/– mice (Supple-
mentary Fig. S11C), and plasma insulin was elevated compared
with obese WT mice (Supplementary Fig. S11D). Taken together,
these data indicate that PlGF blockade reproduces the effects
of VEGFR-1-TK deletion and reduces the obesity-induced altera-
tions in metabolism, immune microenvironment, and tumor
progression.
Discussion
We demonstrated here for the first time that obesity is associ-
ated with increased systemic levels of PlGF in breast and pancre-
atic cancer patients as well as in obese tumor mouse models.
Furthermore, we revealed that PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling mediates
obesity-induced tumor progression (Fig. 6F).

 In a PDAC model, at the tumor level obesity was associated
with increased TAM infiltration, expression of M2 cytokines,
tumor
growth,
and
metastasis.
VEGFR-1
was
abundantly
expressed in TAMs, and blockade of VEGFR-1 signaling in obese
but not lean mice led to a shift in protumor cytokine production
(e.g., IL1b) and TAM polarization from an M2 protumor to an M1
antitumor
phenotype,
ultimately
reducing
obesity-induced
tumor progression. Furthermore, PlGF blockade in obese mice
reproduced the effects of VEGFR-1-TK deletion on the tumor
immune environment and tumor growth. Rolny and colleagues
reported an M1 shift in TAM polarization after inhibition of PlGF
in a nonobese setting (38). Furthermore, we and others have
shown that PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling promotes secretion of IL1b
by monocytes/macrophages (14, 39). However, this is the first
study to demonstrate a specific role for VEGFR-1 in TAM polar-
ization. Similar to previous studies, inhibition of VEGFR-1 sig-
naling did not alter immune cell infiltration in tumors (12, 40–
42). However, this effect has been shown to be highly tumor- and
context-dependent (14, 15, 18, 43), and we show here that PlGF/
VEGFR-1 signaling affects the function rather than the number of
infiltrating immune cells. Of note, despite that differences in TAM
polarization markers between lean and obese settings were not
clear (Supplementary Fig. S2), PlGF/VEGFR-1 inhibition func-
tionally promoted an M1 shift only in the obese setting. Hence
this pathway is clearly involved in immunosupression in this
metabolic setting. Importantly, plasma PlGF, but not VEGF-A or
VEGF-B, was robustly associated with obesity across all models/
human samples. In addition, unlike VEGFs, PlGF was not pro-
duced by these tumor cells, further supporting that PlGF levels can
be more affected by the obese-altered host tumor microenviron-
ment. It is therefore not surprising that stromal deletion of PlGF
replicated the effects of VEGFR-1 deletion on metabolism and
tumors in obese mice. This is also consistent with our previous
study using Flt1TK–/– mice, where we found that VEGFR-1-TK
deletion affects primary tumor growth only in the presence of
PlGF overexpression, but not of VEGF overexpression (18). Of
note, we found that VEGF-A in tumors (local expression) did
increase in Flt1TK–/– mice in both the lean and obese setting. The
fact that it increased in both settings further validates the lack of
any association between VEGF-Awith obesity in this study. On the
other hand, we have shown before that VEGF-A was decreased in
peritoneal macrophages derived from Flt1TK–/– mice compared
with those from WT mice (44). This indicates that the effect of
VEGFR-1-TK deletion on the expression levels of VEGF in specific
cells of the tumor microenvironment may vary, despite an overall
increase.
Importantly, similar effects of VEGFR-1-TK deletion on system-
ic metabolism, tumor progression, vasculature, immune cell
infiltration, and TAM polarization were observed not only in
PAN02 but also in a breast cancer model (E0771). This is

abstract. Increased levels of plasma PlGF in obese mice associate with increased recruitment of TAMs, M2-like cytokine profile, and accelerated tumor progression
compared with lean setting. Although ineffective in the lean mice, in obese setting PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling ablation did not affect TAM recruitment or vessel
density, but shifted TAM polarization and the immune environment toward an M1 phenotype, and prevented the obesity-induced tumor progression. This occurred
with an aggravation of the systemic metabolism and increase in plasma Insulin levels. Metformin not only normalized the systemic metabolism, but also
promoted increased tumor vascular perfusion, cytotoxic cell recruitment, tumor cell apoptosis, and reduced tumor growth. �, P < 0.05; ��, P < 0.01; ����, P < 0.001.

 consistent with the elevated systemic levels of PlGF in the obese
setting also in this model. Despite inducing a smaller impact on
the tumor immune environment compared with PAN02 tumors,
we found that VEGFR-1-TK deletion reduced the expression of IL6
and MMP-9 in the obese setting. This may explain the effect of
VEGFR-1-TK deletion on metastasis in this model, in line with
previous findings that IL6 and VEGFR-1–dependent MMP-9
expression in the stroma (TAMs, in particular) can affect systemic
metastasis (14, 45). On the other hand, VEGFR-1-TK deletion did
not affect primary tumor growth in obese mice in the E0771
model, contrary to results in the PAN02 model which is consistent
with the smaller effects on the tumor immune microenvironment
in the former model. We and others have shown that the growth
rate of tumors implanted in Flt1TK–/– mice compared with WT may
be affected differently depending on the tumor model (12, 15). In
addition, as mentioned above, VEGFR-1-TK deletion appears to
affect primary tumor growth only in the presence of PlGF over-
expression (15, 18). Similarly, overexpression of PlGF in colo-
rectal cancer cell lines increased the migration and invasion of
tumor cells in a VEGFR-1–dependent manner (46). In fact, the
lack of effect on primary tumor growth (and smaller effect on the
immune environment) by VEGFR-1-TK deletion in the E0771
tumor model could have been due to the lower levels of PlGF in
tumors (local levels) compared with PAN02 tumors, which might
have contributed to the lower sensitivity to VEGFR-1-TK deletion.
Conversely, the effect of VEGFR-1-TK deletion on metastases may
be more dependent on the levels of systemic PlGF, which was
increased in obese mice in both PAN02 and E0771 tumor models.
Our results on systemic metastasis are in line with our previous
work in normal weight Flt1TK–/– mice (that have relatively low
levels of plasma PlGF), where we showed no effect of VEGFR-1
genetic or pharmacologic inhibition on spontaneous metastases
formation (41, 42, 47).
Despite that VEGFR-1 can regulate tumor angiogenesis in a
context-dependent manner (14, 37, 48), here we found that
obesity did not promote tumor vessel density, and VEGFR-1
signaling ablation did not modify vessel density in either tumors
or adipose tissue. Carmeliet and colleagues have shown that the
angiogenic role of VEGFR-1 is in part due to the recruitment of
TAMs that secrete proangiogenic factors in the tumor microenvi-
ronment (37). Hence, the lack of the effect on TAM recruitment
observed here may explain at least in part the absence of an effect
on angiogenesis in our models.
Beyond the effects on tumors, we showed that PlGF and
VEGFR-1 deficiency also reduced weight gain in mice maintained
on HFD. This is consistent with previous findings from Lijnen and
colleagues in PlGF-deficient mice (20), although previous work
with pharmacologic inhibition of PlGF or VEGFR-1 did not
demonstrate the metabolic derangement observed here (20,
49). The transient effects of pharmaceutical agents on metabolic
parameters may not always be the same as phenotypes caused by
lifelong genetic deficiencies. Imperfect delivery/efficacy of phar-
maceutical agents may also cause differences in phenotypes
compared with complete genetic blockade of the same molecular
pathways. The reduction of body weight gain with VEGFR-1-TK
deletion was not associated with reduced vasculature, as in Lijnen
and colleagues (20), or immune cell infiltration. However, the
shift to M1 macrophages and M1 cytokine profile with VEGFR-1-
TK deletion is known to be associated with insulin resistance (50)
and promote adipocyte cell death (51), which could explain the
impaired glucose metabolism, increased levels of insulin and
reduced weight gain in Flt1TK–/– and Plgf–/– obese mice compared
with WT. This is consistent with findings from Hemmeryckx and
colleagues, who showed that PlGF deficiency in mice fed with a
HFD promoted insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, presum-
ably via reduced fraction of brown adipocytes and stimulation of
white adipocyte hypertrophy (21). Interestingly, however, we
observed that VEGFR-1-TK deletion actually reduced adipocyte
size. In addition, various pancreatic morphologic parameters
including b-cells and insulin production, as well as macrophage
infiltration in the pancreas, which can also influence insulin
production (52), were unaltered with VEGFR-1-TK deletion. This
indicates that the lack of VEGFR-1 signaling did not alter pancre-
atic insulin production, likely affecting peripheral resistance to
this hormone. In fact, inhibition of Pi3K-eNOS signaling by
VEGFR-1 inhibition may have been involved, as previously
observed in a model of diabetic nephropathy (53). Importantly,
previous studies have demonstrated similar glucose metabolism
impairments in mice with genetic VEGF deficiencies in the whole
pancreas (54), or specifically in b-cells (55) where an impairment
is thought to be caused by defective transport of insulin across
vascular ECs. Of note, we found that the effects observed on tumor
progression were not due to the protective effects on body weight.
In fact, in body weight–matched mice, mice that present with
same body weight at the time of tumor implantation, VEGFR-1-
TK deletion still significantly decreased tumor progression, allow-
ing us to conclude that the bulk of the mechanism of action is via
direct impact on the tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless,
considering the physical and psychologic beneficial effects of
preventing weight gain in breast cancer patients (56, 57), long-
term VEGFR-1 inhibition may further improve the quality of life.
The aggravated diabetes-like systemic metabolism in obese
Flt1TK–/– compared with obese WT mice was associated with
increased plasma insulin and activation of insulin/IGF-1 signal-
ing in tumors. This was associated with decreased expression of
gluconeogenic genes and autophagy in tumors, but no major
changes in other metabolic pathways were observed. Although
activation of Insulin/IGF-1 in tumors may be detrimental (5),
recent evidence indicate that inhibition of gluconeogenesis may
lead to prevention of tumor growth (58). Further studies are
necessary to explore the role of VEGFR-1 in local tumor metab-
olism. Besides normalizing the plasma levels of insulin in obese
Flt1TK–/–, remarkably metformin also normalized pancreatic
tumor vasculature and immune microenvironment, by increasing
perfusion and recruitment of CD8þ T cells, that were associated
with increased cell death and reduced tumor growth. As VEGFR-1-
TK deletion decreased expression levels of CTLA-4 and PDL-2,
those findings suggest a synergy between enhanced T-cell function
by VEGFR-1-TK deletion (hence acting as an immune checkpoint
inhibitor) and increased infiltration of T/NK cells by metformin.
Of note, the effect of metformin on perfusion is consistent with
the ability of this drug to reduce tumor desmoplasia, which we
have recently described (32). Contrary to previous studies, we did
not find a significant change in activating of major metabolic
pathways, including IGF-1 and AMPK, after metformin treatment
(33, 34), indicating that the major effects of metformin seem to be
on the stromal–vascular–immune tumor microenvironment and
not on local metabolism. This is consistent with our previous
work showing that metformin can modulate metabolic pathways
specifically in TAMs but not at the whole tumor level (32). The
positive impact of metformin on tumors are consistent with
reports in preclinical models of obesity from our laboratory and

 others (32–34) and in diabetic PDAC patients (59), and multiple
trials are ongoing to validate its beneficial effects (59).
Collectively, our findings reveal that PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling
contributes to weight gain and to a protumor immune micro-
environment in the obese but not lean setting, which promotes
accelerated tumor progression. We found this effect in both
PDAC and breast cancer models, suggesting that this may be a
common mechanism of tumor induction by obesity that could
apply to other cancer types. Furthermore, the increased plasma
levels of PlGF observed in obese PDAC and breast cancer
patients strongly support the findings of this study, and suggest
the PlGF/VEGFR-1 pathway as a potential target for obese
cancer patients. As most PDAC and breast cancer patients have
excess weight at diagnosis, stratifying these patients by body
weight for treatment may enhance the efficacy of anti-VEGFR-1
agents such as multikinase inhibitors, which have failed to
show efficacy in unselected populations (60). In addition, this
study suggests that PlGF/VEGFR-1 may be a valid target par-
ticularly in combination with therapies that control systemic
metabolism, such as metformin.
