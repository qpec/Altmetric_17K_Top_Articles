Objectives: The objectives of this study were to prospectively assess the rectal carriage rate of third-generation
cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (3GCREB) in non-ICU patients on hospital admission and to investi-
gate resistance mechanisms and risk factors for carriage.
Methods: Adult patients were screened for 3GCREB carriage at six German tertiary care hospitals in 2014 using
rectal swabs or stool samples. 3GCREB isolates were characterized by phenotypic and molecular methods. Each
patient answered a questionnaire about potential risk factors for colonization with MDR organisms (MDROs).
Univariable and multivariable risk factor analyses were performed to identify factors associated with 3GCREB
carriage.
Results: Of 4376 patients, 416 (9.5%) were 3GCREB carriers. Escherichia coli was the predominant species
(79.1%). ESBLs of the CTX-M-1 group (67.3%) and the CTX-M-9 group (16.8%) were the most frequent b-lacta-
mases. Five patients (0.11%) were colonized with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The following
risk factors were significantly associated with 3GCREB colonization in the multivariable analysis (P,0.05): centre;
previous MDRO colonization (OR¼2.12); antibiotic use within the previous 6 months (OR¼2.09); travel outside
Europe (OR¼2.24); stay in a long-term care facility (OR¼1.33); and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD) (OR¼1.22).
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest admission prevalence study of 3GCREB in Europe. The observed
prevalence of 9.5% 3GCREB carriage was higher than previously reported and differed significantly among
centres. In addition to previously identified risk factors, the treatment of GERD proved to be an independent
risk factor for 3GCREB colonization.
Introduction
Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
(3GCREB) have disseminated globally in recent years. Among
3GCREB, isolates producing ESBLs are involved in most cases of
colonization and infection worldwide.1 First reported in the
1980s in Europe as derivatives of narrow-spectrum b-lactamases
(TEM/SHV type), ESBLs are now dominated by CTX-M types.2 Apart
from ESBLs, resistance to third-generation cephalosporins can
also be caused by production of the AmpC b-lactamase, espe-
cially in Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Morganella and Serratia spp.
Infection with 3GCREB frequently results in inappropriate anti-
microbial therapy and may compromise treatment outcome.
While the impact of inappropriate therapy on mortality remains
a controversial issue, it is significantly associated with increased

 length of stay and hospital costs.3 – 5 3GCREB colonization of
the gut is the reservoir for infections with these organisms.2
Colonization rates differ greatly between countries and conti-
nents, with a lower prevalence in Europe and much higher rates
in Africa or South-East Asia, reaching up to 69.3% in healthy volun-
teers in Thailand.2,6–8Documented risk factors for colonization with
3GCREB are hospitalization within the previous 12 months, prior
antimicrobial treatment, travel to regions with 3GCREB endemicity
(e.g. India and South-East Asia) or eating pork.9–11
Currently, few data exist on the prevalence of and risk factors for
3GCREB carriage in Germany. As part of the multicentre Antibiotic
Therapy Optimisation Study (ATHOS), admission screening for
3GCREB carriage was performed at six German tertiary care hospi-
tals in 2014 and risk factors for colonization were investigated.
Methods
Participants and setting
This prospective prevalence survey was conducted at six large tertiary care
hospitals, covering the north (Centre 6), west (Centre 2), east (Centre 1),
south-west (Centres 4 and 5) and south-east (Centre 3) of Germany.
Centres had between 1300 and 3200 inpatient beds. Patients aged
≥18 years from general wards that had been admitted between June
and December 2014 were included in the study. Patients from ICUs,
dermatology, obstetrics, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology and psych-
iatry were excluded.
Ethics
The study was approved by the institutional ethics committees (approval
number EA4/018/14). Patients were required to give informed consent
prior to enrolment in the study.
Collection of samples and patient data
Patients were screened for 3GCREB colonization within 3 days of admission
to allow for inclusion of patients admitted on weekends. Each patient was
asked to answer a short questionnaire (available as Supplementary data
at JAC Online) on potential risk factors for colonization with MDR organisms
(MDROs). Further potential risk factors included in the questionnaire were sex,
age, current antibiotic treatment, animal contact and previous colonization
with any MDRO (MRSA, 3GCREB, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
and VRE). In addition, the following risk factors in the 6 months prior to
admission were recorded: previous antibiotic therapy; travel abroad; stay
at a rehabilitation centre; stay at a long-term care facility (LTCF); hospitaliza-
tion; and medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Phenotypic detection of 3GCREB carriers
Stool or rectal swabs (with Amies transport medium) were used for the
screening of patients for 3GCREB. Samples were plated onto ChromID
ESBL agar (bioMe
´rieux, Nu
¨rtingen, Germany). Species identification of iso-
lates growing on ESBL agar was performed using MALDI-TOF MS or the
Vitek 2 GN ID card (bioMe
´rieux). Susceptibility testing was carried out
using Vitek 2 (bioMe
´rieux). All isolates that were non-susceptible to cefo-
taxime, ceftriaxone or ceftazidime according to EUCAST breakpoints were
included in the study and further characterized.
Phenotypic detection of ESBL production was performed with the com-
bination disc test as recommended by EUCAST, using cefotaxime, ceftazi-
dime and cefepime+clavulanate (Mast Diagnostica, Reinfeld, Germany).12
All isolates were tested for AmpC production by the cefoxitin/cloxacillin
disc test (Liofilchem, Roseto degli Abruzzi, Italy) as previously described.13
Molecular characterization of isolates
All isolates were testedby PCR for blaSHV, blaTEM and blaCTX-M groupsblaCTX-M-1,
blaCTX-M-2 and blaCTX-M-9 as previously reported.14 Isolates that were negative
for blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-2 and blaCTX-M-9 group but phenotypically
ESBL positive were additionally tested for the presence of blaCTX-M-8/25, since
CTX-M-8 has been described previously to be increasingly frequent in
Germany.15 Escherichia coli isolates that were identified phenotypically as
AmpC positive were investigated for the presence of plasmid-mediated
AmpCs as previously described.16 All isolates with meropenem MICs
.0.25 mg/L were analysed for the presence of carbapenemase genes
blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaOXA-48 and blaNDM by multiplex PCR.17
Statistical analysis
The prevalence rate of 3GCREB on admission was expressed as the number
of patients positive for 3GCREB per 100 patients admitted. In the descrip-
tive analysis, numbers and percentages were calculated; differences were
tested using the x2 test. To evaluate independent risk factors for coloniza-
tion on admission, univariable and multivariable regression analyses were
performed. Since observations within a hospital (and/or within a region)
are not statistically independent due to the patient population (especially
the prevalence in the region), adjusted ORs with 95% CIs were calculated.
They were based on generalized estimating equation models, which
account for this clustering effect by using an exchangeable correlation
structure. Parameters considered in the analysis were: centre (six different
centres); age (≤45, 46–55, 56–65, 66–75 or .75 years); sex (male/
female); prior MDRO carriage; antibiotic use during the previous 6 months;
travel abroad during the previous 6 months within or outside Europe; stay
at a rehabilitation centre or LTCF in the previous 6 months; hospital stay in
the previous 6 months in Germany, in a European country outside
Germany or outside Europe; occupational or private animal contact; and
treatment of GERD with antacids or proton-pump inhibitors during the
last 6 months. Recorded parameters were categorized as no (reference),
yes or unknown. In one hospital, hospital stay in the previous 6 months
was answered incorrectly—only hospital stay within Europe but outside
Germany and hospital stay outside Europe were answered; therefore,
the information on hospital stay within Germany was set to unknown.
In the multivariable analysis, the model building strategy was performed
stepwise backward, significance level for excluding a parameter from the
model was P¼0.05. For epidemiological reasons, age and sex were
included in all models. P values ,0.05 were considered significant. All ana-
lyses were performed using SPSS 22 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Somer, NY, USA)
and SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Overall, 4376 patients were enrolled. Of these, 416 patients were
3GCREB carriers, resulting in an admission prevalence of 9.5%. Of
note, there was no difference in 3GCREB prevalence among
patients screened within the first 2 days and those screened on
day 3 of admission (data not shown).
Nineteen patients (0.4%) were colonized with two different
3GCREB strains, thus 435 isolates were phenotypically identified.
The patients’ median age was 62 years (IQR 49–73 years) and
49.2% were female (Table 1).
Phenotypical and molecular epidemiology
of 3GCREB isolates
E. coli was the most frequent 3GCREB species detected at all six
centres, accounting for 344 of 435 isolates (79.1%), followed
by Klebsiella pneumoniae (37 isolates, 8.5%), Enterobacter spp.

 (25, 5.7%) and Citrobacter spp. (21, 4.8%). These findings are
summarized in Table 2. Of all 3GCREB isolates, 41.1% were resist-
ant to fluoroquinolones.
Among the 435 phenotypically characterized isolates,
410 (94.3%) were available for molecular analysis of underlying
resistance mechanisms. ESBL production was the predominant
resistance mechanism and was detected in 370/410 isolates
(90.2%), with some isolates carrying a combination of two

 or three b-lactamases (e.g. CTX-M-type ESBL+SHV ESBL or ESBL+
carbapenemase). Among 3GCREB, the CTX-M-1 group was most
frequently detected (276/410; 67.3%) followed by CTX-M-9
group (69/410; 16.8%), SHV ESBLs (22/410; 5.4%) and AmpC
(39/410; 9.5%) (Table 3). Among seven E. coli isolates that were
phenotypically AmpC positive, a plasmid-mediated AmpC was
detected in six isolates (CMY-2 and CMY-42 in three isolates each).
One E. coli isolate was negative for plasmid-mediated AmpC genes
and AmpC production was likely a result of mutations in the pro-
moter/attenuator region of the AmpC gene. A combination of
ESBL and AmpC production was found in five isolates (1.2%).
Three isolates were phenotypically ESBL and AmpC negative
and no ESBL gene was detected by PCR. All isolates possessed
narrow-spectrum TEM b-lactamases; non-susceptibility to third-
generation cephalosporins in these isolates was likely caused by
other mechanisms such as a combination of hyperproduction of
narrow-spectrum b-lactamases+porin loss.
Six isolates had elevated carbapenem MICs. Of these, five iso-
lates (1.2% of all 3GCREB) produced a carbapenemase (VIM-1,
three isolates, and NDM-1 and IMP-8, one isolate each; Table 3).
In one ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolate with slightly ele-
vated imipenem MIC, no carbapenemase was detected and car-
bapenem non-susceptibility was most likely caused by the
combination of ESBL and porin loss.
There were marked differences observed between centres,
with 3GCREB carriage rates ranging from 5.1% in Centre 6 to
11.8% in Centre 2 (Table 1). No statistically significant differences
were observed between centres for the various b-lactamase
groups (data not shown).
Risk factor analysis
Descriptive statistics revealed that patients with 3GCREB coloniza-
tion significantly more often received antibiotic therapy (52.9%
versus 33.7%, P,0.001), had prior MDRO carriage (9.4% versus
4.1%, P,0.001), were admitted to a German hospital (31.5% ver-
sus 25.1%, P,0.001), travelled outside Europe (13.5% versus
6.8%, P,0.001) and received treatment for GERD with antacids
or proton-pump inhibitors within the previous 6 months (44.7%
versus 36.7%, P¼0.003). The complete descriptive statistics are
summarized in Table S1.
Risk factors for 3GCREB colonization in the univariable analysis
that remained significantly associated in the final multivariable
model included: admission at Centre 1 (OR¼2.17, 95%
CI¼2.09–2.25), Centre 2 (OR¼2.25, 95% CI¼2.08–2.44),
Centre 3 (OR¼1.10, 95% CI¼1.03–1.18), Centre 4 (OR¼1.44,
95% CI¼1.36–1.52) or Centre 5 (OR¼1.63, 95% CI¼1.45–1.85)
compared with the centre with the lowest prevalence; prior MDRO
colonization (OR¼2.12, 95% CI¼1.72–2.60); prior antimicrobial
treatment (OR¼2.09, 95% CI¼1.84–2.39); travel outside Europe
(OR¼2.24, 95% CI¼1.90–2.64); stay in an LTCF (OR¼1.33, 95%
CI¼1.04–1.70); and medical treatment of GERD (OR¼1.22, 95%
CI¼1.07–1.40) within the previous 6 months (Table 4). In add-
ition, age between 46 and 55 years was significantly associated
with a reduced risk of 3GCREB colonization (OR¼0.74, 95%
CI¼0.58–0.94) compared with patients older than 75 years. The
complete multivariable analysis is available in Table S2.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the largest
study on the prevalence of 3GCREB carriage on hospital admission
in Europe, including 4376 patients admitted to six tertiary
care hospitals representing different regions of Germany. The
admission prevalence of 3GCREB carriage was 9.5% in patients
admitted to a general ward. Currently, few data are available on
3GCREB carriage on hospital admission and many studies have
focused on E. coli or ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae only,
not taking into account other resistance mechanisms.
Valenza et al.18 reported a prevalence of 6.3% ESBL-producing
E. coli among 3344 healthy volunteers in Germany who were in
close contact with patients with diarrhoea and screened for faecal
carriage of intestinal bacterial pathogens and ESBL-producing
E. coli. Similarly, 329 of 4376 patients (7.5%) were colonized by
ESBL-producing E. coli in our study.
The prevalence of 3GCREB recorded in the present study
among patients from regular wards is similar to that reported
among ICU patients in Germany. A case–control study including
1706 patients from 15 ICUs in a German university hospital
reported a prevalence of 3GCREB carriage of 9.6%.19 In a Swiss
study investigating 235 patients transferred from a hospital out-
side Switzerland or in a high-prevalence region of Switzerland, a
prevalence of 17.9% was reported for Gram-negative MDRO car-
riage.20 A recent study including 1351 patients in the Netherlands
reported an ESBL prevalence of 8.2% on admission.7 In contrast, a
higher prevalence has been observed in studies from Singapore or
Israel (12.4% and 10.7%, respectively).21,22

 The predominant species found in our study was E. coli, fol-
lowed by K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp.
Confirming previous studies, ESBL-producing E. coli were detected
much more frequently on admission than ESBL-producing
K. pneumoniae.7,22
Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was most com-
monly caused by ESBLs of the CTX-M-1 group in the present study
(67.3% of all 3GCREB), followed by ESBLs of the CTX-M-9 group
(16.8%). When comparing our data with other studies from
Germany investigating only E. coli, the prevalence of the
CTX-M-1 group among E. coli ESBLs was similar (72.8% in the pre-
sent study, compared with 75.5% in the study by Valenza et al.18
or 75.3% in the study by Leistner et al.10). This underscores the
importance of the CTX-M-1 group ESBLs, outnumbering all other
b-lactamases in Germany and in many other countries.7,23
The
admission
prevalence
of
carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae was low at 0.11%. Interestingly, VIM-1 was
the most frequently detected carbapenemase in our study. This
contrasts with most other studies, which report OXA-48 to be
the most frequent carbapenemase among Enterobacteriaceae
in Germany and the neighbouring countries Belgium, France and
the Netherlands.24,25 This difference might be explained by a dif-
ferent study design, as most of the currently available data stem
from pre-selected carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates, mainly
of nosocomial origin sent to national reference laboratories.
Therefore, these data might not be representative for the general
population.
There were significant regional differences in 3GCREB preva-
lence. Patients admitted to hospitals in the east or west of
Germany (Centres 1 and 2) had a significantly higher rate of
3GCREB colonization as compared with patients admitted to a
hospital in the north, south-east or south-west. A possible explan-
ation could be differences in food intake. Leistner et al.10 identified
the frequent consumption of pork as an independent risk factor
for colonization with ESBL E. coli. Evidence of dissemination of
MDR Enterobacteriaceae via the food chain has been shown pre-
viously.8,11,26Another reason for the higher prevalence in east and
west German centres could be the population structure in these
areas. The centres are located in areas that have a higher propor-
tion of inhabitants originating from east and south European
countries and from Asian countries, where the ESBL prevalence
is higher.2,27 Further evidence for higher ESBL carriage rates in
selected populations comes from another study, where ESBL
E. coli was more commonly found in patients with an Asian
mother tongue.10
In the present study, we did not obtain information on the
patients’ dietary habits and their nationality or ethnicity. Thus,
the reasons for the observed regional differences could not be
clearly elucidated and require further study.
Previous antibiotic therapy was an independent risk factor for
3GCREB colonization in our study. This finding is in concordance
with the results of several studies in which the development of
3GCREB colonization after antibiotic treatment especially with
third-generation cephalosporins was demonstrated.19,22,28,29
With our questionnaire, we did not obtain information on any spe-
cific antimicrobial class or compound that the patients had taken
within the previous 6 months, assuming that most of them would
not be able to recall the antimicrobial class. Therefore, we could
not analyse the association of 3GCREB prevalence with prior anti-
microbial treatment with different drug classes.
In the present study, travel outside Europe within the previous
6 months was also an independent risk factor for colonization
with 3GCREB. This concurs with investigations demonstrating
international travel as a possible means of spreading ESBL-
producing Enterobacteriaceae, mainly ESBL E. coli, from high- to
low-prevalence countries through healthy travellers.30,31 Kuenzli
et al.9 recently demonstrated that colonization rates with
3GCREB were especially high in travellers returning from South
Asia, ranging from 34.7% in those visiting Sri Lanka to 86.8%
in those returning from India. As a clinical consequence, recent
travel of patients presenting with an infection should always be
considered when choosing empirical antibiotic treatment.
Another independent risk factor for 3GCREB carriage in our
study was prior stay in an LTCF within 6 months before admission.
Various studies on the prevalence of MRSA in LTCFs in Germany
and other European countries have been published, but few
data exist on the current prevalence of 3GCREB in LTCFs in
Germany. In a point prevalence study to assess carriage rates of
ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in LTCF residents in the
German Rhine-Main region, 455 residents were screened for rectal
carriage and MDROs were detected in 17.8% of patients.32
The medical management of GERD with proton-pump inhibi-
tors or antacids was also an independent risk factor for 3GCREB
carriage in our study. These drugs can promote enterobacterial
overgrowth in the upper gastrointestinal tract by raising the gas-
tric pH.33 Interestingly, it has been demonstrated previously that
treatment with H2 blockers in neonates was significantly asso-
ciated with carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriacae.34
Even though five risk factors could be identified in the present
study, further studies are needed to establish if a risk factor-based
screening approach is reasonable for the detection of MDR
Gram-negative organisms. In the present study, 79.3% of all
patients colonized with 3GCREB were positive for at least one of
the five significant risk factors, but also 61.7% of all patients not
colonized with 3GCREB.
Our study has several limitations. It was performed in large
tertiary care facilities and thus generalizability of our results to
the general hospital patient population may be limited. The study
design did not allow follow-up evaluation or discharge screening
of enrolled patients. Another limitation may be the limited sensitiv-
ity of screening for 3GCREB using rectal swabs as compared with
stool samples. However, rectal swabs have been used for practical
reasons in most epidemiological studies, as they are easier to
obtain. Furthermore, no pre-enrichment of samples was done,
which has recently been shown to improve the sensitivity of screen-
ing for 3GCREB.35 Another limitation of our study might be the
screening agar used (ChromID ESBL). This agar has good sensitivity
for the detection of ESBLs and has also been demonstrated to have
higher sensitivity for the detection of carbapenemase producers
than most carbapenem-containing agars.36 However, it does not
allow the detection of OXA-48 strains without ESBL expression.
Most OXA-48-positive isolates coproduce an ESBL and will therefore
be detected; however, we cannot exclude that occasional OXA-48
isolates without an ESBL were missed. Furthermore, some
AmpC-positive isolates are also suppressed by this medium.37
In conclusion, a prevalence of 3GCREB carriage of 9.5% among
patients on hospital admission was observed in this large multi-
centre study, which was higher than previously reported in
Germany. Colonization with 3GCREB was common among
patients not considered ‘high risk’ and who therefore are usually

 not screened on admission. Currently, there is no universal re-
commendation in Germany for screening patients for MDR
Gram-negative bacteria and most hospitals screen only patients
who report previous hospitalization abroad. In the multivariable
analysis, hospital stay outside Europe was not significantly asso-
ciated with an increased risk of 3GCREB colonization, so it might
not be a good marker to initiate patient screening.
Given the diversity of risk factors and the high prevalence of
3GCREB colonization on admission, the results of the present
study suggest that vertical prevention strategies, as currently
employed in many institutions for MRSA, are unlikely to be effect-
ive for the prevention of 3GCREB transmission.38 In contrast, since
‘high-risk’ patients cannot be identified easily, it might be more
reasonable to reinforce horizontal prevention strategies such as
hand hygiene and antimicrobial stewardship programmes.
