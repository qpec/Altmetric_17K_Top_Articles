Abstract
Background: Studies on advanced maternal age—defined here as age 35 or older—and
children’s cognitive ability report mixed evidence. Previous studies have not analysed
how the time period considered in existing studies influences the association.
Methods: We analysed trends in the association between maternal age and cognitive
ability using data from the 1958 National Child Development Study (n ¼ 10 969), the 1970
British Cohort Study (n ¼ 9362) and the 2000–2002 Millennium Cohort Study (n ¼ 11 600).
The dependent variable measures cognitive ability at age 10/11 years. Cognitive scores
were standardised to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
Results: For the 1958–70 cohort studies, maternal ages 35 –39 were negatively associated
with children’s cognitive ability compared with maternal ages 25–29 (1958 cohort
b ¼ �0.06 standard deviations (SD) 95% confidence interval (CI): �0.13, �0.00; 1970
cohort b ¼ �0.12 SD 95% CI: �0.20, �0.03). By contrast, for the 2000–2002 cohort study
maternal ages 35–39 were positively associated with cognitive ability (b ¼ 0.16 SD 95%
CI: 0.09, 0.23). For maternal ages 40þ, the pattern was qualitatively similar. These cross-
cohort differences were explained by the fact that in the earlier cohorts advanced mater-
nal age was associated with high parity, whereas in the 2000–2002 cohort it was associ-
ated with socioeconomically advantaged family background.
Conclusions: The association between advanced maternal age and children’s cognitive
ability changed from negative in the 1958 and 1970 cohorts to positive in the 2000–2002
cohort because of changing parental characteristics. The time period considered can con-
stitute an important factor in determining the association between maternal age and cog-
nitive ability.
Key words: Advanced maternal age, cognitive ability, secular change

 Introduction
Since the 1980s there has been a marked increase in the
mean age at first birth across industrialised countries.1,2
The consequences of this demographic trend for the well-
being of children are poorly understood. Whereas there is
a wealth of evidence showing a negative association be-
tween advanced maternal age, defined here as giving birth
at ages 35 and above,3 and child health around the time
of birth,4–6 research on child well-being beyond infancy is
less consistent.7 In particular, evidence on the association
between maternal age and children’s cognitive ability is
mixed. Some studies, before adjustment for parental char-
acteristics,
have
documented
a
positive
association
between advanced maternal age and children’s cognitive
ability,8–10 whereas others found a negative associ-
ation.11–14 Cognitive ability in childhood is an important
predictor
of
important
outcomes
measured
later
in
life, such as educational attainment, occupation and
health.15–18 Thus, it is essential to gain a better under-
standing of how children’s cognitive ability is associated
with advanced maternal age.
The mixed picture on maternal age and cognitive ability
may be partially attributed to the fact that existing studies
have analysed the association in different time periods. We
hypothesise that the period considered could represent an
important source of variation across studies, since the
characteristics of older mothers have changed markedly
over time. In the past, families in which children were born
to older mothers tended to have larger numbers of children
and were poorer than the average; whereas today these
families tend to have smaller numbers of children and are
socioeconomically more advantaged than the average,
often because parents invest in education and become es-
tablished
in
professional
occupation
before
having
children.8,19
Consequently,
the
association
between
advanced maternal age and children’s cognitive ability
might have changed over time.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
investigate the question of whether the association be-
tween advanced maternal age and children’s cognitive
ability has changed over time within the same context. To
analyse this question, we used data from three large and
representative UK birth cohort studies from 1958, 1970
and 2000–02.
Methods
Sample description
We used data from three UK birth cohort studies. For each
cohort, maternal age and socio-demographic characteris-
tics were collected from the birth survey. Information on
children’s cognitive ability was collected from the age 10/
11 survey.
The 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS)
is a longitudinal cohort study that followed 17 416 chil-
dren born in England, Scotland or Wales during 1 week in
March 1958. We use data from the birth survey (response
rate 99%) and from the age 11 survey (response rate
88%).
The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS) is a longitudinal
cohort study that followed 16 571 children born in
England, Scotland or Wales during 1 week in April 1970.
We use data from the birth survey (response rate 96%) and
the age 10 survey (response rate 87%).
The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a longitudinal
cohort study that followed 19 244 children born in
England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in a period
of time that included September 2000 and January 2002.
Key Messages
• We hypothesise that the existing evidence on the association between advanced maternal age–defined here as giving
birth at ages 35 and above–and children’s cognitive ability has generated mixed evidence because previous studies
have analysed it in differing time periods.
• We studied secular trends in the association between maternal age and cognitive ability using three UK cohort stud-
ies: the 1958 NCDS, the 1970 BCS and the 2001 MCS.
• The association between being born to an older mother and child cognitive ability went from slightly negative for
children born in the 1950–70s to clearly positive for children born after the year 2000.
• These cross-cohort differences were explained by the fact that in the earlier cohorts, advanced maternal age was
associated with high parity, whereas in the 2001 cohort it is associated with socioeconomically advantaged family
background.
• The time period considered and secular changes in the social meaning of having children at older ages can constitute
important factors in determining the association between maternal age and cognitive ability.

 The sample was selected from a random sample of elect-
oral wards, using a stratified sampling strategy to ensure
the representation of all four of the UK countries and of
disadvantaged and ethnically diverse areas. We used
weights to account for the complex sampling design and
non-response and overrepresentation of disadvantaged and
ethnically diverse areas. In the analyses, we used data from
Sweep 1 (response rate 82%), which were collected when
the children were around 9 months old, and from Sweep 5,
which were collected when the children were around 11
years old (response rate 72%).20 We refer to the MCS as
the 2001 cohort study, since the majority of births in the
sample occurred in 2001.
Variables
The dependent variable was a measure of verbal cognitive
ability collected when the children were 10/11 years old. In
the 1958 NCDS cohort study, verbal cognition was assessed
based on the verbal score of the General Ability Test
(National Foundation for Educational Research).21 Children
were tested individually by teachers. In the 1970 cohort
study, verbal cognition was assessed by a teacher using the
Word Similarity subscale of the British Ability Scales.22 In the
2001 cohort study, verbal cognition was assessed by the inter-
viewer using the Verbal Similarity subscale from the British
Ability Scale (second edition).23 For the 1970 and the 2001
cohort studies, we used scores that were standardised based
on a normed pool of scores within 3-month age ranges
(which are not available for the 1958 cohort study). We used
tests of cognitive ability that are comparable across cohorts,
as they all measure verbal ability and were collected at similar
ages. However, since different tests were administered in each
cohort, we have standardised them, within each study, to a
mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
The key independent variable was maternal age at the
birth of the cohort child, categorised as <20, 20–24, 25–
29, 30–34, 35–39 and 40þ years. We set 25–29 as the ref-
erence category since it was the largest one in the 1958 and
2001 cohorts and the second largest in the 1970 cohort
study. The other independent variables were a set of child
and family characteristics collected during the first survey
of each cohort study.
We adjusted for the sex of the cohort child and for
whether the child was a multiple birth. We also adjusted
for birth order, i.e. the numerical order of the live birth
(categories: first, second, third or higher).24–26 We adjusted
for the mother’s education (categories 1958/1970 cohorts:
whether the mother stayed in education until the minimum
age; categories 2001 cohort study: whether the mother had
degree-level education), and for the father’s (1958/1970
cohorts) or the family’s social class (2001 cohort, the
highest in the household) based on the Registrar General
Social Class (categories in all cohorts: professional occupa-
tion, managerial and technical occupations, skilled non-
manual occupations, skilled manual occupations, partly
skilled occupations, unskilled occupations). We adjusted
for the mother’s marital status at birth (categories 1958 co-
hort: married or single; categories 2001 cohort: married,
cohabiting or single) or at conception (categories 1970 co-
hort: married or single), whether the mother smoked dur-
ing pregnancy (binary indicator), whether the mother used
antenatal care after 12 weeks of pregnancy (binary indica-
tor), the mother’s height (continuous) and whether the
mother breastfed the cohort child for any duration (binary
indicator).
Inclusion criteria and exclusions
We dropped observations with missing values on maternal
age, on cognitive scores or on any of the covariates meas-
ured around the time of the cohort child’s birth. In families
with multiple births in the MCS, we randomly selected one
child (166 cases in the analytical sample). These exclusions
reduced the 1958 cohort sample to 10 969 (out of 13 951
cases in the age 11 survey), the 1970 cohort sample to
9362 (out of 14 350 cases in the age 10 survey) and the
2001 cohort sample to 11 600 observations (out of 13 287
cases in the age 11 survey).
Statistical models
We estimated three linear regression models for each co-
hort study. Model 1 is the unadjusted association between
maternal age and child cognitive ability and includes ad-
justment only for the child’s sex and for whether the child
is a twin. Model 2 includes adjustment for the child’s sex,
for whether the child is a twin and for the child’s birth
order–because a high order/parity birth is associated with
worse cognitive ability and it is also a correlated with large
family size and lower socioeconomic position of the
family.24–26
Model 3 is the fully adjusted model and includes all ad-
justment variables. We adjusted for family characteristics,
described in the variable section, that might help to explain
the association between maternal age and cognitive ability
because they reflect maternal/family socio-demographic
characteristics and health behaviours during/after preg-
nancy, and because they are associated with children’s cog-
nitive ability.15,16,27,28 To test whether the association
between advanced maternal age and cognition varied
across cohorts, we pooled the cohorts and estimated a
model with interactions between cohort and each regressor
(for details see Appendix, available as Supplementary data
852

 at IJE online). All analyses were conducted in Stata/SE ver-
sion 14.
Results
Descriptive analyses
The 1958 and 1970 cohorts show an inverted U-shaped as-
sociation between maternal age and children’s cognitive
ability, with the children of mothers aged 25–29 displaying
the best outcomes (Tables 1 and 2). The 2001 cohort shows
a positive association between maternal age and children’s
cognitive ability, with the children of mothers aged 35–39
displaying the best outcomes (Table 3).
The birth order distribution at advanced maternal ages
changed markedly across cohorts. In the 1958 and 1970
cohorts, over 70% of births occurring at maternal ages 40
and above were third or higher parity births, and 9% and
13% were, respectively, first births. In the 2001 cohort,
less than 50% of births were third or higher parity births
and 18% were first births. For maternal age 35–39 the pic-
ture is similar.
Cohort
differences
also
emerged
for
the
socio-
demographic profiles of older mothers. Over time, the
women who gave birth at advanced maternal ages have be-
come more advantaged than the women who gave birth at
younger ages. In 2001 older mothers were more likely than
younger mothers to have high level of education and a high
household income. Conversely, the maternal age gradients
of socio-demographic variables in the 1958 and 1970 co-
hort studies were less pronounced.
Regression analyses
Table 4 shows standardised maternal age coefficients for
all of the regression models; Figure 1 illustrates the results
for the key coefficients. Appendix Table 1 shows the full
set
of
covariates
in
each
model
(available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Model 1 shows the unadjusted association between mater-
nal age and children’s cognitive ability (Figure 1, Panel A). In
the 1958 and 1970 cohorts, children born to mothers aged
25–29 scored higher than children born to older mothers. For
example, in both cohorts maternal age 35–39 was associated
with worse cognitive ability scores than maternal age 25–29

30–34 and 35–39 had better cognitive outcomes than the
children born to mothers aged 25–29 (e.g. for the age group
35–39, b ¼ 0.16, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.23, P-value< 0.001).
Therefore, the unadjusted results document a secular change
in the association between advanced maternal age and chil-
dren’s cognitive ability.
Model 2 includes the adjustment for birth order (Figure 1,
Panel B). The results for the 1958 and 1970 cohorts showed
striking changes. For these early cohorts, the association be-
tween advanced maternal age and children’s cognitive ability
went from negative in Model 1 to clearly positive in Model 2.
For example, in the NCDS 1958 cohort the association be-
tween being born to a mother aged 40 and above and cogni-
tive ability went from b ¼ �0.12, (95% CI: -0.24, -0.00, P-
value¼ 0.06) to b ¼ 0.12 (95% CI: 0.00, -0.24, P-val-
ue¼ 0.044). The maternal age gradient for the 2001 cohort
became only slightly more pronounced.
Model 3 presents the fully adjusted results: in addition to
birth order we included adjustments for maternal and family
characteristics (Figure 1, Panel C). The 2001 cohort shows
the most striking difference between the results of this model
and those of Models 1 and 2. After adjusting for socio-
demographic characteristics, the positive association between
advanced maternal age and children’s cognitive ability was
attenuated. For example, the association between maternal
ages 35–39 and children’s cognitive ability went from
b ¼ 0.16 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.23, P-value< 0.001) in Model 1
to b ¼ 0.10 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.16, P-value< 0.001) in Model
3. The age gradients of the 1958 and 1970 cohorts showed
only minor changes compared with Model 2.
The pooled results (Table 5) for the unadjusted model
show important differences in the 35–39 coefficients between
the 2001 and 1958/1970 cohorts and for the 40þ coefficients
between the 2001 and 1958 cohorts. After the adjustments for
parental characteristics, there were no longer cross-cohort dif-
ferences in the association between advanced maternal age
and cognitive ability. We used the pooled model to also test
for overall (all-age) cohort differences. Hypotheses of the
equality of age coefficients based on Model 1 were strongly re-
jected for all cohort pairs with P-values smaller than 0.001.
For Model 3, there were no differences in the 1958–2001 and
the 1958–70 cohort pairs, whereas there were some residual
differences in the 1970–2001 comparison (P-value:¼ 0.024).
Sensitivity analyses
We replicated the analyses with linear and quadratic terms
for maternal age, with ages 20–24 as the reference; we
excluded twins and triplets, and adjusted the models for
birthweight. For the 2001 cohort, we included adjustment
for other family characteristics such as family income, eth-
nicity and drinking during pregnancy, and excluded
Northern Ireland from the analysis. The results changed
only marginally across these checks.
Discussion
Previous research on being born to an older mother and
cognitive ability is inconclusive.7 We hypothesised that be-
cause the social meaning associated with having children
at older ages has changed markedly over time,29 the period

 of analysis could contribute to explain why research on
this topic has generated mixed results. To test this hypoth-
esis, we analysed the association between advanced mater-
nal age and children’s cognitive ability over time within the
UK context and using data from the 1958 National Child
Development Study, the 1970 British Cohort Study and the
2000–2002 Millennium Cohort Study UK birth cohorts.
The results were consistent with our hypothesis. The un-
adjusted results showed a marked secular trend in the associ-
ation
between
advanced
maternal
age
and
children’s
cognitive ability. The association between advanced mater-
nal age and children’s cognitive ability went from negative
in the 1958 and 1970 cohorts to positive in the 2001 cohort.
The negative association in the earlier cohorts appears to be
associated with the fact that the children born to older moth-
ers in these cohorts were more likely to have been high par-
ity births than their counterparts in the 2001 cohort. High
birth order can be associated with lower cognitive ability for
three complementary reasons. First, first-born children have
better cognitive outcomes than later-born children, poten-
tially because they have greater access to parental re-
sources.25 Second, the advantage of being first (or second)
born was stronger in the 1958 and 1970 cohorts than in the
2001 cohort. Third, previous research documents a negative
relationship between sibship size and children’s cognitive
ability since larger families tend to be poorer,30 a finding
which is supported in our data (Appendix Table 2, available
as Supplementary data at IJE online). The positive associ-
ation between advanced maternal age and children’s cogni-
tive ability found in the 2001 cohort appears to be largely
explained by the selected and advantaged profiles of the
older mothers in this cohort. In the fully adjusted model, as
shown in the pooled results, the cohort differences were
eliminated. The residual association between maternal age
and cognitive ability in the fully adjusted model within each
cohort could reflect unmeasured parental characteristics (e.
g. parental cognitive ability which is passed on genetically to
the offspring, parenting styles, aspirations) or causal effects.7
This study has three major contributions and implica-
tions. First, the results show that heterogeneity in the char-
acteristics of women who give birth at advanced ages can
help to reconcile the existing controversial evidence on the
association between maternal age and children’s cognitive
ability. Moreover, the findings suggest that future studies on
the association between advanced maternal age and child
well-being should pay attention to the period under consid-
eration, since the nature and the consequences of childbear-
ing at advanced maternal ages have changed markedly over
time. Second, they illustrate that properly adjusting for
factors associated with maternal age, such as socioeconomic
position and birth order, helps to reconcile findings from
different time periods and studies. Third, the results indicate
that, among children born around the year 2001 and poten-
tially also after that, those born to older mothers may be ex-
pected to have better outcomes than the children being born
to mothers aged 25–29, and that the magnitude of this asso-
ciation could be important for longer-term well-being.
Based on previous studies, a difference of 0.16 of a standard
deviation, i.e. the magnitude of the cognitive score coeffi-
cients
for
mothers
aged
35–39
in
the
2001
cohort
unadjusted model, could be associated with up to a 5%
increase/decrease in all-cause mortality.31 Although this is
not a very strong association, its population-level import-
ance should not be underestimated given the substantial in-
crease in births at advanced maternal ages documented in
developed countries since the 1980s.
This study has several strengths. First, we used three
high-quality and representative surveys, which enabled us
to undertake a cross-cohort comparison. Second, we relied
on measures of cognitive ability that are comparable across
Table 5. Difference (with 95% confidence intervals) in the association between advanced maternal age and cognitive ability

 cohorts, since they all measured verbal ability and were ad-
ministered when the cohort members were around the
same age. Third, we were able to describe and analyse co-
hort differences in the characteristics of older mothers,
which enabled us to largely partially explain the cross-
cohort differences in the association between advanced
maternal age and children’s cognitive ability.
This study also has limitations. First, because this study
is focused exclusively on the UK, we were unable to assess
to what extent the findings might be generalisable to other
contexts. However, we expect that similar patterns would
be observed in other developed contexts where older moth-
ers have also become more advantaged over time. Second,
because the number of births to mothers aged 40 and
above is small, especially in the BCS 1970 cohort study,
the parameters may not have been precisely estimated.
Nonetheless, a consistent pattern emerged when we con-
sidered mothers who gave birth at ages 35–39, a group
that did not raise issues of statistical power. Third, pater-
nal age is unavailable when the father was not present at
birth/interview. Therefore including this variable would re-
duce the sample size, in particular in the 2001 cohort (by
14%) where the prevalence of childbearing outside of mar-
riage was higher than in the previous cohorts. Maternal
and paternal ages tend to be highly associated,11 but the
relative importance of maternal and paternal ages might
have also changed over time and testing for this possibility
would require different data. Fourth, the most recent co-
hort was born in 2001 and, therefore, we were unable to
say whether the trends observed between 1958 and 2001
have continued after the year 2001.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
document
secular
trends
in
the
association
between
advanced maternal age and children’s cognitive ability,
and to show that the period considered constitutes an im-
portant source of variation across studies. Our results also
show that the maternal age and children’s well-being asso-
ciation is largely driven by the association between mater-
nal age and socio-demographic characteristics, which
might vary across time and contexts and across subpopula-
tion groups within the same context.32 To reinforce these
findings, future studies should replicate the analyses using
other outcomes, looking at other contexts and groups
within the same context or time period for whom the na-
ture and consequences of childbearing at older ages might
differ.
