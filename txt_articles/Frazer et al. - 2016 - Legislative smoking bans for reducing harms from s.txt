Background
Smoking bans have been implemented in a variety of settings, as well as being part of policy in many jurisdictions to protect the public
and employees from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke (SHS). They also offer the potential to influence social norms and the
smoking behaviour of those populations they affect. Since the first version of this review in 2010, more countries have introduced
national smoking legislation banning indoor smoking.
Objectives
To assess the effects of legislative smoking bans on (1) morbidity and mortality from exposure to secondhand smoke, and (2) smoking
prevalence and tobacco consumption.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and reference
lists of included studies. We also checked websites of various organisations. Date of most recent search; February 2015.
Selection criteria
We considered studies that reported legislative smoking bans affecting populations. The minimum standard was having an indoor
smoking ban explicitly in the study and a minimum of six months follow-up for measures of smoking behaviour. Our search included
a broad range of research designs including: randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies (i.e. non-randomized controlled
studies), controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series as defined by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of
Care Group, and uncontrolled pre- and post-ban data.

 Data collection and analysis
One author extracted characteristics and content of the interventions, participants, outcomes and methods of the included studies and
a second author checked the details. We extracted health and smoking behaviour outcomes. We did not attempt a meta-analysis due
to the heterogeneity in design and content of the studies included. We evaluated the studies using qualitative narrative synthesis.
Main results
There are 77 studies included in this updated review. We retained 12 studies from the original review and identified 65 new studies.
Evidence from 21 countries is provided in this update, an increase of eight countries from the original review. The nature of the
intervention precludes randomized controlled trials. Thirty-six studies used an interrupted time series study design, 23 studies use a
controlled before-and-after design and 18 studies are before-and-after studies with no control group; six of these studies use a cohort
design. Seventy-two studies reported health outcomes, including cardiovascular (44), respiratory (21), and perinatal outcomes (7).
Eleven studies reported national mortality rates for smoking-related diseases. A number of the studies report multiple health outcomes.
There is consistent evidence of a positive impact of national smoking bans on improving cardiovascular health outcomes, and reducing
mortality for associated smoking-related illnesses. Effects on respiratory and perinatal health were less consistent. We found 24 studies
evaluating the impact of national smoke-free legislation on smoking behaviour. Evidence of an impact of legislative bans on smoking
prevalence and tobacco consumption is inconsistent, with some studies not detecting additional long-term change in existing trends
in prevalence.
Authors’ conclusions
Since the first version of this review was published, the current evidence provides more robust support for the previous conclusions
that the introduction of a legislative smoking ban does lead to improved health outcomes through reduction in SHS for countries and
their populations. The clearest evidence is observed in reduced admissions for acute coronary syndrome. There is evidence of reduced
mortality from smoking-related illnesses at a national level. There is inconsistent evidence of an impact on respiratory and perinatal
health outcomes, and on smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption.

Does legislation to ban smoking reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and smoking behaviour?
Since the first national legislation banning indoor smoking in all public places was introduced in 2004, there has been an increase in the
number of countries, states and regions adopting similar smoke-free legislation banning smoking in public places and work places since
this review was first published. The main reason is to protect nonsmokers from the harmful health effects of exposure to secondhand
smoke. Another reason is to provide a supportive environment for people who want to quit smoking.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies that investigated the effect of introducing a ban on any measures of health, or on smoking behaviour (up to
February 2015). Since the previous version of this review had shown clear evidence that introducing legislation to ban smoking in public
places does reduce exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) in those places, we did not include studies that only reported exposure to
SHS. We included 77 studies from 21 countries in this updated review. Studies of health outcomes typically used data from hospitals to
look for changes in rates of admissions, discharges or deaths. Most studies looked at illnesses related to the cardiovascular system (heart
or blood vessels), such as heart attacks and strokes. Studies also looked at effects on respiratory health, including chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (e.g. bronchitis), asthma and lung function. Seven studies looked at the health of newborn children. Eleven studies
reported death rates. The best-quality studies collected data at multiple time points before and after the introduction of a ban in order to
adjust for existing time trends. Some studies could compare events rates in areas with and without bans, or where bans were introduced
at different times.
Key results
There is evidence that countries and their populations benefit from improved health after introducing smoking bans, importantly to
do with the heart and blood vessels. We found evidence of reduced deaths. The impact of bans on respiratory health, on the health of
newborn children, and on reducing the number of smokers and their cigarette use is not as clear, with some studies not detecting any
reduction.

 Legislative bans have not been evaluated by randomized trials, and the quality of the evidence from the types of studies contributing
to this review is lower. Changes in health outcomes could be due to other things, such as change in healthcare practices. However,
many of the studies used methods of analysis that could control for underlying trends, and increase our confidence that any changes
are caused by the introduction of bans.

 GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1Note, original review also included changes in environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure as an outcome. Evidence
was unequivocal that bans were associated with significant reductions in ETS (see Callinan 2010), and hence we did not
evaluate this outcome in this update.
2As all studies are observational, starting point for GRADE rating is low. Meta-analyses not conducted; data summarized
narratively.
3Upgraded due to evidence of a dose-response effect.
4Downgraded due to imprecision.

Description of the condition
Tobacco is the second major cause of mortality in the world, and
currently responsible for the death of about one in ten adults
worldwide (WHO 2009; WHO 2013). Measures to control the
demand for and supply of tobacco products, as well as to pro-
tect public health, have been demanded through Article 8 of the
FrameworkConventiononTobaccoControl (WHO 2003; WHO
2009; WHO 2014).
The epidemic of cigarette smoking is identified as one the greatest
public health disasters of the 20th century, with over 20 million
attributable deaths (USDHHS 2014). Over the past 50 years of re-
ports by the Surgeon General, international evidence has emerged
that smoking affects most organs and that there is no risk-free level
of exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) (USDHHS 2014). The
World Health Organization (WHO 2014; WHO 2015) estimates
that six million people die annually from tobacco-related diseases;
600,000 from the effects of secondhand smoke exposure.
Secondhand smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS) or passive smoke, is the combination of side-stream smoke,
i.e. smoke that is emitted between puffs of burning tobacco
(cigarettes, pipes or cigars), and mainstream smoke, i.e. smoke
that is exhaled by the smoker (NCI 1999). Secondhand smoke is
a complex mixture of thousands of gases and particulate matter
emitted by the combustion of tobacco products and from smoke
exhaled by those smoking (NRC 1986). Secondhand smoke was
declared to be carcinogenic by the International Agency for Re-
search on Cancer (IARC 2004; IARC 2008; IARC 2009).
Negative health effects associated with exposure to SHS have been
well documented and include major conditions such as lung can-
cer, aswell ascardiovasculardisease, respiratorydisease andasthma,
and other significant health outcomes such as eye and nasal irri-
tation and low birth weight in babies of nonsmokers (Allwright
2002; Hackshaw 1997; NCI 1999; ANHMRC 1997; SCOTH
2004; IARC 2009; USDHHS 2014).
There has been an increase in the number of countries introducing
comprehensive national indoor smoking policies banning smok-
ing in indoor public places and work places since 2005 and the
number of research papers has risen exponentially since this review
was first published (Callinan 2010). The primary outcome is to
protect nonsmokers from the harmful health effects of exposure
to secondhand smoke and additionally to provide a supportive
environment for people who want to quit smoking.
Description of the intervention
The efforts of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control
to reduce tobacco consumption worldwide (WHO 2003; WHO
2009; WHO 2013) include a demand for smoke-free legislation,
and the MPOWER provisions include protecting people from
tobacco use (WHO 2008; WHO 2009; WHO 2015). Legislating
for smoke-free environments is a fundamental component of these
actions.
Introducing national smoking legislation is a public policy issue.
The underpinning decision-making process is multifactorial, in-
cluding epidemiological evidence of the toxicity of smoke and the
associated link to a pathological endpoint, international policy ev-
idence of acceptability and compliance and evidence of improved
health outcomes. Legislative smoking bans vary in their compre-
hensiveness in different settings, i.e. the extent to which they allow
smoking or restrict it to designated areas and where those smok-
ing restrictions occur. Legislation prohibiting smoking indoors,
including in bars and restaurants, we classify in this review as a
comprehensive smoking ban, even though exemptions may occur
in different settings, e.g. psychiatric units, prisons, and residen-
tial homes, including nursing homes. Less comprehensive smok-
ing bans, such as those which allow smoking in designated rooms
or areas, we classify in this review as partial bans. The primary
outcome is to protect nonsmokers from the harmful health effects
of exposure to secondhand smoke, and additionally to provide a
supportive environment for people who want to quit smoking.
Evidence from the previous review identified the impact of na-
tional smoking bans on improved respiratory and sensory symp-
toms, improved lung function, reduced tobacco consumption and
reduced SHS exposure (Callinan 2010).
How the intervention might work
One potential outcome of smoking bans and restrictions is to re-
duce or eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to the dangers of
SHS. Another is to reduce tobacco consumption among smokers
in specified areas including work places or general public places.
While SHS in the work place increases the risk of lung cancer
among nonsmokers, the elevation in risk is modest in comparison
with the riskof active smoking.International evidence isemphatic,
that smoking is responsible for increased mortality for smokers,
and for nonsmokers through SHS exposure (WHO 2015). Eth-
ical questions also arise in relation to individual civil liberty, and
policy makers prefer not to interfere with such rights for those
who smoke, except for minors. It is the harmful effect of passive
smoking in nonsmokers that justifies the policy action, especially
for workers. This means that the endpoint is often more likely to
be an exposure measure to passive smoke than either active smok-
ing rates or a health gain of reduced smoking-related morbidity
or mortality. Evidence from this review previously demonstrated
that a smoking ban does lead to a reduction in exposure to passive
smoking, specifically for the population employed in the hospital-
ity sector. It also reported evidence of improved health outcomes
(Callinan 2010).

 Why it is important to do this review
This is a major public health issue affecting an estimated billion
active smokers worldwide and the larger population of nonsmok-
ers. The impact of introducing smoking legislation is to cut ex-
posure to passive smoke. For every person who dies as a result
of smoking, it is estimated that 30 or more people will live with
smoking-related illnesses (USDHHS 2014). Banning smoking is
a public policy issue. The decision-making process underpinning
it is ultimately a political action which rests on a combination of
evidence sources, including:
1. Mechanistic evidence of toxicity of smoke
2. Epidemiological evidence that either smoking or SHS is
linked to a pathological endpoint
3. Policy evidence that imposing a restriction will be socially
acceptable and achieve high compliance
4. Action research evidence that it can be successfully
implemented.
Bans and policies can be implemented through public health poli-
cies or legislation affecting populations at a national, state or com-
munity level.
In setting the parameters for the original review, we adopted a strict
methodological approach in keeping with the Cochrane process
but with consideration for the nature of health promotion inter-
ventions in setting those parameters. Evaluation of health promo-
tion interventions continues to generate debate in the scientific
literature. Davey Smith 2000 argues that the randomized control
trial is the standard for assessing health promotion interventions.
Opponents of this view (Britton 2010; Green 2015) acknowledge
that rigorous evaluation of studies is important, but that random-
ized controlled trials may not be the best approach given the com-
plexities, processes and scope of health promotion programmes.
During the intervening period since this review was first published,
there have been sustained developments to reduce exposure to to-
bacco and reduce consumption, with more countries signing up
to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and enact-
ing national smoke-free legislation. There have been extensions
of smoking bans to reduce exempted population groups. This has
resulted in fewer partial smoking bans and more inclusive compre-
hensive bans in a wider range of settings. The evidence of health
outcomes on reduced exposure, morbidity and mortality arising
from the enactment of smoking bans can take time to emerge. In
this review we include robust studies strengthening this evidence
base and its impact at a population level.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We include randomized controlled trials, non-randomized con-
trolled studies, controlled before-and-after studies, and inter-
rupted time series, as defined by the Cochrane Effective Practice
and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC 2013), and uncontrolled
before-and-after studies, with a minimum follow-up of six months
for measures of smoking.
Types of participants
Smokers and nonsmokers exposed to comprehensive or partial
smoking bans. The bans must be implemented by legislation, and
may affect populations at a local, regional, or national level.
Types of interventions
Legislative bans which either ban smoking completely in all set-
tings including the hospitality sector (comprehensive) or restrict
it to designated areas (partial). The ban may be implemented at
national, state or local level. For controlled studies, the interven-
tion setting may be compared to settings without smoking bans
or with less restrictive policies.
Types of outcome measures
Primary objective:
Measures of health outcomes including any measure of morbid-
ity or mortality, e.g. cardiac admissions, respiratory health, and
pulmonary function. In studies with longer follow-up, measures
of the incidence of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease may
also be available. If health outcomes were reported for population
subgroups defined by smoking status or by levels of or changes in
SHS exposure, we extracted data for these subgroups.
Secondary objective:
Measures of smoking behaviour including prevalence of tobacco
use, tobacco consumption, cessation rates. For these outcomes
we required data from large population-based studies. We also
required baseline data (pre-legislation) and a follow-up period of
a minimum of six months after introduction of a ban, to assess a
sustained impact.
For this update, we have not included studies only reporting the
impact of smoking bans on passive smoke exposure using self-
reported data or only measuring cotinine. An impact of bans on
passive smoke exposure and a reduction in cotinine measures fol-
lowing reduced exposure was unequivocal from the first version
of the review (Callinan 2010). We now require measured health
outcomes data for studies reporting passive smoke exposure.

 We requiredbiochemical verificationof exposure toenvironmental
tobacco smoke over self-reported perceptions. In order to assess
sustained impact, we included studies which reported outcomes
such as smoking behaviour at least six months after the start of
the smoking ban. In the first version of the review, we excluded
studies which reported environmental measures of air quality (e.g.
particulate matter (PM
.
), respirable particles (RSP), vapour
phase nicotine) as their sole measure of exposure to SHS, and we
do not include these studies in this update.
Where possible, we stratified smoking behavioural outcomes by
age, gender and socioeconomic status.
Search methods for identification of studies
For the original version, we searched all databases from inception
to June 2009. One author subsequently conducted searches from
2009 to March 2013. For this update, the Trials Search Co-or-
dinator of the Tobacco Addiction Group completed all searches
from February 2009 to 26th February 2015.
The searches conducted were:
• Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register
(up to end of February 2015); see Appendix 1 for search strategy.
• MEDLINE & PubMed (via OVID, up to 26th February
2015 ); see Appendix 2 & Appendix 3 for search strategies.
• EMBASE (via OVID, up to 26th February 2015); see for
Appendix 4 for search strategy.
• PsycINFO (via OVID, up to 26th February 2015); see
Appendix 5 for search strategy.
• Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
(CINAHL) (via Ebscoup to March 2013); see Appendix 6 for
search strategy.
We did not update the searches of CINAHL beyond 2013 as they
were not identifying additional studies. We also checked the ref-
erence lists and bibliographies of included studies for further ar-
ticles, and we contacted other experts for published and unpub-
lished trials. We did not exclude any publications on the basis of
language or publication date.
We checked websites for relevant studies and contacted authors
for details of unpublished research papers and for additional in-
formation
Data collection and analysis
For this update, JC prescreened titles and abstracts between 2009
and 2012. One author (KF) prescreened titles and abstracts (2009
to 2015) to identify studies that may be relevant or useful. Three
authors (JC, AC, KD) independently screened the reduced num-
ber of titles and abstracts to assess relevance for inclusion. KF ob-
tained the full text of potentially relevant studies. Two authors (KF,
CK) independently assessed the papers to see if they met the inclu-
sion criteria. No discrepancies emerged. At this time, we limited
studies reporting passive exposure to include those also reporting
specific health outcome measures. We noted all decisions. One
author (KF) independently extracted the data for the individual
studies, and a second author (SvB) checked the results.
Two authors (KF, JMcH) independently reviewed studies report-
ing active smoking measures. We held discussions with a third in-
dependent author (CK) and made a decision to limit active smok-
ing studies to those reporting outcomes from a population level.
One author (KF) completed a ’Risk of bias’ assessment using the
assessment tool (Higgins 2011) for the included studies, and a
second author (SvB) checked the results. The domains assessed
were:
• Adequate sequence generation.
• Adequate allocation concealments.
• Blinding of personnel/all outcomes.
• Addressing incomplete outcome data.
• Selective outcome reporting.
• Other bias.
We assessed each domain as being at high, low or unclear risk of
bias.
We completed data extraction on a specific pro forma, and ex-
tracted data on the following information, where it was available:
1. Country and study setting
2. Category of study (population- or institution-based)
3. Size of eligible population
4. Number of participants or number of clusters and
participants
5. Demographic characteristics (if relevant) of participants
6. Description and target of the intervention
7. Definition of smoking status used
8. Definition of exposure to secondhand smoke
9. Outcomes and how they were measured
10. Biochemical validation
11. Length of follow-up
12. Handling of dropouts and losses to follow-up
13. Adverse effects of intervention
Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity in study
design, participants, outcomes and nature of the intervention, so
we have presented summary and descriptive statistics. We report
any threats to validity or other limitations described by the studies.

 We include 77 studies which met the eligibility criteria for this up-
dated review. We retain 12 studies with unchanged data from the
first version of the review (Cesaroni 2008; Gallus 2007; Goodman
2007; Hahn 2008; Juster 2007; Khuder 2007; Larsson 2008;
Lemstra 2008; Pell 2008; Pell 2009; Sargent 2012; Seo 2007).
Additional results have been reported for two previously included
studies, and we have renamed them to reflect this, with original re-
ports now listed as secondary references: Alsever 2009 (previously
Bartecchi2006), andBarone-Adesi2011 (previouslyBarone-Adesi
2006). We have now excluded other studies previously included
that reported passive smoke exposure with either self-reported out-
comesorcotinine measures. Otherexcludedstudiesare those with-
out a six-month follow-up period following the ban and those that
did not report smoking prevalence from national population data.
The included studies examine the effects of comprehensive or par-
tial indoor smoke-free legislation implemented in countries, states
(regions) or at local level. We identified the effect of the imple-
mentation of national smoking bans in studies representing 21
countries. Studies with national smoking bans in countries in-
cluded in this update are: Argentina (Ferrante 2012), Belgium
(Cox 2013; Cox 2014), Denmark (Christensen 2014), Germany
(Sargent 2012; Schmucker 2014), Hong Kong (McGhee 2014),
Panama (Jan 2014), Switzerland (Bonetti 2011; Di Valentino
2015; Durham 2011; Dusemund 2015; Humair 2014; Rajkumar
2014), Turkey (Yildiz 2015) and Uruguay (Sebrié 2014).
Countries included in the earlier review are retained in the update:
Canada (Gaudreau 2013; Lemstra 2008; Naiman 2010), England
(Lee 2011; Liu 2013; Millett 2013; Sims 2013), France (Séguret
2014), Ireland (Cronin 2012; Goodman 2007; Kabir 2009; Kabir
2013; Kent 2012; Stallings-Smith 2013), Italy (Barone-Adesi
2011; Cesaroni 2008; Federico 2012; Gallus 2007; Gasparrini
2009; Gualano 2014), Netherlands (De Korte-De Boer 2012),
New Zealand (Barnett 2009), Norway (Bharadwaj 2012), Scot-
land (Jones 2015; Mackay 2010; Mackay 2011; Mackay 2012;
Mackay 2013; Pell 2008; Pell 2009), Spain (Aguero 2013; Villalbi
2011), Sweden (Larsson 2008) and USA (Alsever 2009; Amaral
2009; Barr 2012; Basel 2014; Bruckman 2011; Bruintjes 2011;
Croghan 2015; Dove 2010; Hahn 2008; Hahn 2011; Hahn 2014;
Head2012; Herman2011; Hurt2012; Juster 2007; Khuder2007;
Klein 2014; Landers 2014; Lippert 2012; Loomis 2012; North
Carolina 2011; Page 2012; Roberts 2012; Rodu 2012; Sargent
2004; Seo 2007; Vander Weg 2012).
One study reports on the impact of national smoking bans from a
number of countries including the USA, Canada, New Zealand,
Scotland, Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland (Bajoga
2011). The majority of studies (27) are located in the USA. Other
countries with multiple studies are: Scotland (7), Ireland (6),
Switzerland (6), Italy (6) and England (4).
The definition used in this review for comprehensive smoking
bans is prohibited smoking in work places, including restaurants
and bars. We categorise legislation which permits smoking in bars
and restaurants as a partial smoking ban, whether at local, state
or national level. The implementation of smoking bans has varied
across national jurisdictions, and exceptions for smoking rooms
may be allowed within comprehensive bans. Using these defini-
tions, we identified 18 studies reporting evidence for partial smok-
ing bans (Aguero 2013; Amaral 2009; Bonetti 2011; Christensen
2014; Cox 2014; Di Valentino 2015; Dusemund 2015; Durham
2011; Humair 2014; Khuder 2007; Lippert 2012; Loomis 2012;
McGhee 2014; Rajkumar 2014; Sargent 2004; Sargent 2012;
Schmucker 2014; Villalbi 2011). We define the majority of smok-
ing bans in place as comprehensive within this review.
The settings in this update vary considerably from the original
review. For this update we identified studies reporting the impact
of national smoking bans in the following settings:
• 42 studies used hospital registers for admissions or
discharge data on specific population cohorts
• 20 studies used registries for national health outcomes,
death rates, pregnancy and perinatal health
• 11 studies used population-level country-specific prevalence
surveys reporting active exposure to smoking
• 4 studies are work place-based, reporting primarily passive
exposure and measured health outcomes.
We found 43 studies which reported smoking data either as a
primary outcome, a descriptive variable reporting national preva-
lence without comparing rates before or after smoking legisla-
tion, or used as a covariate in analysis. Eleven studies (Cesaroni
2008; Christensen 2014; Cox 2014; Ferrante 2012; Head 2012;
Hurt 2012; Jan 2014; Kabir 2013; Mackay 2010; Naiman 2010;
Stallings-Smith 2013) report smoking prevalence data from an-
other data source, rather than data from their own studies. Twenty-
four studies report an impact of smoking bans on active or pas-
sive smoking (Analysis 1.1). Active smoking outcomes including
prevalence, quit rate and tobacco consumption are specifically re-
ported in 19 studies (Bajoga 2011; Bharadwaj 2012; Cesaroni
2008; Cox 2014; Federico 2012; Ferrante 2012; Gallus 2007;
Gualano 2014; Hahn 2008; Hurt 2012; Jones 2015; Kabir 2009;
Klein2014; Lee 2011; Lemstra2008; Lippert2012; Mackay2011;
Mackay 2012; Page 2012). Combined active and passive smoking
outcomes are reported in Larsson 2008. Passive smoke exposures
are reported in a further four studies (Durham 2011; Goodman
2007; Pell 2008; Rajkumar 2014) with the evidence of health out-
comes reported in 72 studies, including: cardiovascular outcomes
(Analysis 1.1), respiratory outcomes (Analysis 2.1) and perina-
tal health outcomes (Analysis 3.1). Associations between indoor
smoking legislation and mortality rates are reported in 11 studies
included in this update (Analysis 4.1). A number of studies report
multiple health outcomes or a combination of health-related out-
comes and mortality outcome data.

 Study Design
We did not identify any randomized controlled trials, due to a lack
of feasibility in using this methodology in population-level studies
measuring the effect of national legislative smoking bans. Of the
77 studies included in this update, 36 used an interrupted time se-
ries design measuring the impact of smoking bans using data from
national registries, episodes of monthly hospital admissions or dis-
charges, or reporting multiple prevalence surveys from population
health surveys (Aguero 2013; Amaral 2009; Bajoga 2011; Barnett
2009; Barr 2012; Barone-Adesi 2011; Basel 2014; Bruckman
2011; Christensen 2014; Cox 2013; Cox 2014; Croghan 2015;
Cronin 2012; De Korte-De Boer 2012; Federico 2012; Gasparrini
2009; Gualano 2014; Hahn 2011; Humair 2014; Jan 2014; Kabir
2013; Kent 2012; Klein 2014; Liu 2013; Mackay 2010; Mackay
2011; Mackay 2012; Mackay 2013; Millett 2013; Roberts 2012;
Sargent 2012; Schmucker 2014; Sebrié 2014; Séguret 2014; Sims
2013; Stallings-Smith 2013).
Twenty-three studies use a quasi-experimental (controlled before-
and-after) study EPOC 2013 design (Alsever 2009; Bharadwaj
2012; Bonetti 2011; Bruintjes 2011; Di Valentino 2015; Dove
2010; Dusemund 2015; Ferrante 2012; Gaudreau 2013; Hahn
2008; Hahn 2014; Head 2012; Herman 2011; Jones 2015;
Khuder 2007; Landers 2014; Loomis 2012; Naiman 2010; Page
2012; Rodu 2012; Sargent 2004; Seo 2007; Vander Weg 2012).
Three of these studies reported using a matched control area
for comparison (Hahn 2014; Khuder 2007; Seo 2007). The
remaining 18 studies used before-and-after methods with no
control group (Cesaroni 2008; Durham 2011; Gallus 2007;
Goodman 2007; Hurt 2012; Juster 2007; Kabir 2009; Larsson
2008; Lee 2011; Lemstra 2008; Lippert 2012; McGhee 2014;
North Carolina 2011; Pell 2008; Pell 2009; Rajkumar 2014;
Villalbi 2011; Yildiz 2015). Six of these studies used a cohort de-
sign (Durham 2011; Goodman 2007; Larsson 2008; Pell 2008;
Pell 2009; Rajkumar 2014).
Excluded studies
For this update, we exclude 36 studies included in the first version,
as they did not meet the revised inclusion criteria for this update
(Abrams 2006; Akhtar 2007; Alcouffe 1997; Allwright 2005;
Biener 2007; Bondy 2009; Braverman 2008; Brownson 1995;
CDC 2007; Eagan 2006; Eisner 1998; Ellingsen 2006; Farrelly
2005; Fernandez 2009; Fernando 2007; Fichtenberg 2000; Fong
2006; Fowkes 2008; Galán 2007; Gilpin 2002; Gotz 2008; Hahn
2006; Haw 2007; Helakorpi 2008; Heloma 2003; Hyland 2009;
Jiménez-Ruiz 2008; Menzies 2006; Mulcahy 2005; Mullally2009;
Palmersheim 2006; Pearson 2009; Semple 2007; Vasselli 2008;
Verdonk-Kleinjan2009; Waa 2006). We nowincludedtwofurther
studies as secondary references in this update (Barone-Adesi 2006;
Bartecchi 2006).
In this update, we exclude uncontrolled before-and-after stud-
ies reporting unverified health outcomes or those which only re-
ported cotinine biomarkers and no other additional health out-
come data, as the focus for this update is on including studies
reporting reduced passive exposure that also measured health out-
comes. The evidence from the first version clearly established that
reduced passive smoke exposure results in reduced cotinine mea-
sures. We exclude from this update studies reporting the impact
of smoking bans on smoking prevalence, tobacco cessation or quit
rates which are not representative population-level measures. See
Characteristics of excluded studies for specific details.
Risk of bias in included studies
We made explicit judgements of bias according to the criteria
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Cochrane Handbook, Higgins 2011). We provide a summary of
the assessments in Figure 2. The study designs used in this review
for evaluating a policy-level health promotion outcome do not
fulfil the criteria used to confirm a low risk of bias, and as such
we consider the evidence to be at high risk of bias for many of the
studies included. However, we acknowledge that the majority of
study designs included in this update used data from large hospital
and national data registries, and for 23 studies include a control
reference area.

percentages across all included studies.
Sequence generation and allocation concealment
The non-randomized studies used in this review did not facilitate
random sequence generation, allocation concealment or blinding
of participants, as smoking is a visible and active process. A num-
ber of studies used large representative population surveys which
employed stratified or random sampling nationally (Bajoga 2011;
Federico 2012; Gualano 2014; Jones 2015; Lee 2011; Lippert
2012; Liu 2013; Mackay 2011). Volunteer samples were reported
in four studies (Durham 2011; Goodman 2007; Larsson 2008;
Rajkumar 2014).
Blinding
It was not possible to blind participants in the studies included
in this review, as the intervention was a national public policy
and smoking is visible. The use of large data sets also negated
blinding. However the large data sets obtained from hospitals used
the Internation Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding to confirm
principal diagnoses. Studiesreportingmortalitydatasimilarlyused
data sets from large national registries.
Incomplete outcome data
A number of studies did not report total sample sizes. Durham
2011 and Larsson 2008 reported high attrition rates, with conse-
quent reporting bias for outcomes. Two studies reported the use of
imputed scores (Aguero 2013; Hurt 2012). Klein 2014 reported
that records were excluded from the data set when smoking status
or other key descriptive variables including gestational age or data
on duration of pregnancy were missing. This led to the exclusion
of 6.3% of cases, amounting to over 30,000 records.
Selective reporting
Within this review a large number of studies used existing data sets,
and individual-level data were not available. Whilst the outcomes
associated were reported, the data sets were pre-existing and may
have given rise to bias associated with misclassification of data, i.e.
residual confounding. Prevalence studies used different data sets
for each survey and this can introduce bias when combining data
(Bajoga 2011; Federico 2012; Gallus 2007; Gualano 2014; Jones
2015; Lee 2011; Lippert 2012; Mackay 2011). There is a reliance
on self-reported, unverified smoking status in studies included in
this update. Verified smoking status (confirming either smoker
or nonsmoker status) was reported by Goodman 2007; Larsson
2008; Pell 2008; Pell 2009. Pell 2009 primarily analysed data
for nonsmoker outcomes, but provided a comparison for current
smokers, with limited data reported.
Other bias
Other bias identified in the included studies is the lack of ad-
justing for confounders, as data were not available within the ac-
cessed data sets. Smoking status was self-reported for the majority
of studies covering active and passive smoke exposure. Cesaroni
2008; Christensen 2014; Cox 2014; Ferrante 2012; Head 2012;
Hurt 2012; Jan 2014; Kabir 2013; Mackay 2010; Naiman 2010;
Stallings-Smith 2013 report smoking prevalence data from other
data or from national surveys, and not from their main data
sources. A number of these studies only provided a single smoking
prevalence result, and we have not included this information in
further statistical analyses (Christensen 2014; Head 2012; Kabir
2013; Mackay 2010; Naiman 2010; Stallings-Smith 2013). Kabir
2013 included maternal smoking prevalence data for analyses re-
ported from an earlier paper (Kabir 2009). Verified smoking status
12

Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 was measured in four studies (Goodman 2007; Larsson 2008; Pell
2008; Pell 2009).
A number of the studies using data from large hospital or popula-
tion registries did not provide information on individual smoking
status or other individual confounders. However, these data sets
used statistical modelling (both linear and non-linear) and adjust-
ments to account for confounding of included variables. A num-
ber of studies adjusted for air quality, pollution, influenza rates
and seasonality, using national data sets in an effort to reduce con-
founding and influence on health outcomes.
Other factors that could have led to bias include: changed pre-
scribing practices for statins during the period of data collection
(Cesaroni 2008; Christensen 2014); legislation banning trans-
fatty acids in foods, resulting in dietary changes which could in-
fluence cardiovascular outcomes (Christensen 2014). Legislative
changes during the period of data collection, including an increase
in the price of cigarettes, was reported by Federico 2012, Jan 2014
and Klein 2014. This may have influenced their study outcomes.
Bharadwaj 2012 reported changed occupational status for preg-
nant women during the period of the study, and this was identi-
fied as a factor which reduced the power of the study. Page 2012
reported significant differences in demographic data between the
control area and the intervention area at baseline, and the influ-
ence of this on their outcomes. Larsson 2008 reported that the
study was predominantly in women, as only 30% of the study par-
ticipants were men. Schmucker 2014 included ex-smokers in the
group of nonsmokers, due to a small sample size of less than 6%,
and inconsistent documentation. Di Valentino 2015 detected a
significant reduction in the control area which did not have a ban
in place. Other new legislation, including laws banning advertis-
ing and sales of cigarettes to minors, may have influenced these
outcomes.
Sample size
Two studies reported power calculations (Bajoga 2011; Lee 2011).
Aguero 2013 did not analyse the impact of legislative changes on
mortality, due to the small sample size reported. Fifteen studies did
not report a sample size (Alsever 2009; Bajoga 2011; Bharadwaj
2012; Bruckman 2011; Gaudreau 2013; Gualano 2014; Head
2012; Herman 2011; Khuder 2007; Landers 2014; Loomis 2012;
McGhee 2014; Mackay 2011; Naiman 2010; Seo 2007), although
a number of these studies reported that large data sets were used
with samples in excess of 1000 and up to 26,000 participants dur-
ing annual data collections. Seo 2007 does not include an over-
all sample size, although the totals included in tables reported in
the paper are suggestive of small numbers. Naiman 2010 reported
population statistics and analyses based on rates per 10,000 pop-
ulation.
Follow-up
The minimum period required for follow-up was six months. The
period for follow-up extended from nine months post-legislative
bans (Kabir 2009) up to 81 months (Stallings-Smith 2013; sec-
ondary reference Stallings-Smith 2014). Gualano 2014 reported
an eight-year follow-up period post-legislation. A number of stud-
ies reported phased implementation of national smoking bans in a
variety of settings. Cox 2013, De Korte-De Boer 2012, Gaudreau
2013, ,Hahn 2014, Naiman 2010, Roberts 2012, Sebrié 2014 and
Séguret 2014 report phased implementation of smoking bans in
Belgium, Netherland, France, USA, CanadaandUruguay. Landers
2014 detected the impact of county-level and state-level bans on
child and adult asthma discharge rates across multiple US states;
Amaral 2009 compared the impact of local and statewide ordi-
nances on perinatal health outcomes in California over a period
of six years.
Biochemical verification
Smoking status was not reported in the majority of studies in-
cluded in this update. Biochemical verification of smoking sta-
tus was measured through analysis of cotinine in saliva or urine
for four studies (Goodman 2007; Larsson 2008; Pell 2008; Pell
2009). Health outcomes data were verified by primary diagnosis
using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Defi-
nitions of current, ex- or nonsmoker status in prevalence surveys
were reported using WHO guidelines; cotinine measures (when
present) for nonsmoking status were confirmed as those less than
15 ng/ml (See Characteristics of included studies).
Adverse events
Four included studies identified adverse events which may have in-
fluenced their study populations and reported outcomes. Humair
2014 and Sargent 2004 reported suspension of smoking bans in
each of their studies during the periods of data collection. Gualano
2014 reported that 2007 was the peak year in the Italian recession
and that this may have influenced smoking rates. Head 2012 re-
ported the influence of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which may
have affected population levels during their study period.
Assessment of heterogeneity
As in the original version of the review, due to the heterogeneity
in clinical variation and study designs reporting primary and sec-
ondary outcomes, we did not attempt a meta-analysis. We offer
a qualitative narrative analysis to report the outcomes in this up-
dated review.

 Primary objective: Effect on health outcomes
We found evidence for health outcomes in 72 studies. A number
of the studies included evidence for multiple health outcomes. We
divided outcomes into cardiovascular (Analysis 1.1), respiratory
(Analysis 2.1), perinatal (Analysis 3.1), and mortality (Analysis
4.1) and report trends and associations using Bradford-Hill 1965
criteria. (Where results are described as significant they were sta-
tistically significant at the P=0.05 level unless otherwise stated).
Cardiovascular outcomes (Analysis 1.1)
We found 44 studies assessing associations between bans and car-
diovascular health outcomes. Thirty-eight studies collected data
on specific cardiac outcomes (acute coronary syndrome (ACS),
acute myocardial infarction (AMI)); 19 interrupted time series
studies (Aguero 2013; Barnett 2009; Barone-Adesi 2011; Barr
2012; Basel 2014; Bruckman 2011; Christensen 2014; Cronin
2012; Gasparrini 2009; Hahn 2011; Humair 2014; Jan 2014;
Kent 2012; Liu 2013; Roberts 2012; Sargent 2012; Schmucker
2014; Sebrié 2014; Séguret 2014), 10 quasi-experimental con-
trolled before-and-after studies (Alsever 2009; Bonetti 2011;
Bruintjes 2011; Di Valentino 2015; Ferrante 2012; Gaudreau
2013; Khuder 2007; Sargent 2004; Seo 2007; Vander Weg 2012),
and nine uncontrolled before-and-after studies (Cesaroni 2008;
Hurt 2012; Lemstra 2008; Lippert 2012; McGhee 2014; North
Carolina 2011; Pell 2008; Rajkumar 2014; Yildiz 2015; see
Analysis 1.1). Evidence from four quasi-experimental controlled
before-and-after studies (Head 2012; Herman 2011; Loomis
2012; Naiman 2010) and one uncontrolled before-and-after study
(Juster 2007) provide evidence for both cardiac and stroke out-
comes. Mackay 2013 provides evidence of the Scottish ban specif-
ically for stroke outcomes.
Cardiac outcomes
We found consistent temporal trends with evidence of significant
reductions in AMI/ACS admissions following the introduction
of national smoking bans. Significant reductions in rates of ad-
missions and discharges were evident in 12 studies (Alsever 2009;
Bonetti 2011; Di Valentino 2015; Ferrante 2012; Gaudreau 2013;
Head 2012; Herman 2011; Loomis 2012; Naiman 2010; Sargent
2004; Seo 2007; Vander Weg 2012), compared to their reference
areas. Seven studies found similar associations (Cesaroni 2008;
Hurt 2012; Juster 2007; Lemstra 2008; McGhee 2014; North
Carolina 2011; Pell 2008). Studies using interrupted time series
data also identified a consistent association with reduced admis-
sions (Aguero 2013; Barnett 2009; Barone-Adesi 2011; Bruckman
2011; Christensen 2014; Cronin 2012; Hahn 2011; Jan 2014;
Kent 2012; Liu 2013; Roberts 2012; Sargent 2012; Schmucker
2014; Sebrié 2014).
Bruintjes 2011 andKhuder2007 detecteddecliningtrendsinAMI
admissions, but the reductions were not statistically different to
comparison areas in either study. Barr 2012 and Gasparrini 2009
observed declining trends in AMI admissions post-ban, but no
statistically significant association after adjusting for linear trends
and non-linear adjustment for secular trends. Whilst Basel 2014
reported a steep decline in AMI rates in the five years prior to
the smoking ban, they found no significant results after statistical
adjustment for previous ordinances. Two smaller communities in
Colorado previously enacted smoke-free legislation and identified
a 27% reduction in AMI hospitalizations (Bruintjes 2011). The
effect of the existing ordinances may have influenced the current
results (Basel 2014).
Séguret 2014 detected a downward trend in ACS admissions over
a seven-year phased implementation of smoking bans in France.
However, after adjusting for linear trends, age and gender, the re-
sults were not statistically significant. Lippert 2012 detected mixed
results, predominantly reduced prevalence of heart disease, angina
and AMI rates; however, increased rates were also detected in states
with partial bans. Whilst Humair 2014 observed significant re-
ductions in ACS hospital admissions post bans, the results were
not significant after statistical adjustment for confounders includ-
ing age, gender and secular trend. Yildiz 2015 did not observe any
change in cardiac admissions.
We found a clear dose-response effect in a number of studies in-
cluded in this update. Alsever 2009 reported sustained reductions
three years after a smoking ban was introduced, (statistically ad-
justing for secular trends) in comparison with the control area.
Similar results were reported in Vander Weg 2012, who observed
reducing admission trends during the phased implementation of
smoking bans in settings, compared to states without bans.
Bonetti 2011 found evidence of sustained reductions in AMI rates
in the second year of the ban for nonsmokers, with no change
observed in the control area. Cronin 2012, Jan 2014 and Sebrié
2014 reported consistent reductions in AMI admissions at least
two years after the introduction of national smoking bans. Naiman
2010 detected reduced admissions for angina after a work place
ban was introduced, and further reductions in admissions for car-
diovascular conditions following subsequent enactment of a ban
in restaurants. Statistically significant reductions in AMI admis-
sions were observed following the implementation of a ban in bars
and the hospitality sector. The authors suggest that the statistically
significant reductions in hospital admissions were unlikely to be
attributable to decreased active smoking rates.
Biological coherence was observed in Schmucker 2014, with di-
verging trends in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in-
cidence between smokers and nonsmokers. Schmucker 2014 de-
tected less coronary vessel disease in smokers compared to non-
smokers in those admitted for STEMI; however, statistically sig-
nificant post-ban reductions in admissions were only observed in
nonsmokers, irrespective of gender and age. Greater reductions
were observed in both younger nonsmokers (aged less than 65
years) and in older nonsmokers (65 years and over) in both the first
and second years after the ban was introduced. Nonsmokers in the

 study also included a small number of ex-smokers. Overall, cur-
rent smokers in the study presented with STEMI at an earlier age
(13 years younger) and were otherwise young and healthy people,
their only risk factor being smoking. Di Valentino 2015 identified
statistically significant reduced STEMI admissions in each of the
three years after a ban was introduced, for older patients (up to 65
years), irrespective of gender. Reductions in those aged under 65
years were detected in the first year after the ban. While they noted
a dose effect, the authors suggest a biological plausibility, as the
results were not transient and the reduction in STEMI admissions
in the older age group may include more nonsmokers. Smoking
status was not recorded in this study. While the authors observed
reductions in men aged 65 years or older in the control canton
area (no ban), they did not observe reductions in older women.
The observed reductions may have been influenced in the control
area by other anti-smoking activities and legislation (Di Valentino
2015).
Outcomes in subgroups
The majority of studies made statistical adjustments for either age,
gender, smoking status (where available, Analysis 5.1) or socioe-
conomic status, and conducted specific sub group analyses.
Head 2012 observed statistically significant reductions in AMI ad-
missions, irrespective of ethnic class. Overall, the greatest reduc-
tions in admissions for heart disease following smoking legisla-
tion were identified in nonsmokers (Aguero 2013; Barnett 2009;
Bonetti 2011; Cronin 2012; Pell 2008; Schmucker 2014; Seo
2007), with Rajkumar 2014 reporting decreased heart rate vari-
ability in nonsmokers. Greater reductions in admission were ob-
served among younger age groups (Barone-Adesi 2011; Cesaroni
2008; Di Valentino 2015; Sargent 2012), irrespective of gender
(Aguero 2013; Barone-Adesi 2011; Gaudreau 2013; Hurt 2012).
Schmucker 2014 observed reductions in nonsmokers, irrespective
of age (Analysis 1.1).
Cesaroni 2008 identified a reduction in acute coronary events in
35- to 64-year-olds; the association was significant for men and
greater for those living in lower socioeconomic areas compared to
higher socioeconomic groups. Liu 2013 observed similar results.
Barnett 2009 identified significant reductions in men, and those
aged 55 to 74 years, but living in more affluent areas (quintile 2),
with increases in admissions for younger women. The greatest de-
crease in admissions was seen in never-smokers. Among younger
never-smokers (30 to 54 years) there was a statistically significant
increase in AMI admissions (Barnett 2009). While Kent 2012,
Roberts 2012 and McGhee 2014 detected statistically significant
reductions in admissions after adjusting for age, Aguero 2013 de-
tected significant reductions particularly in women and in people
aged 65 to 74 years, with former and nonsmokers showing signifi-
cantly reduced AMI rates. North Carolina 2011 observed reduced
admissions, irrespective of gender and in both age groups. Further
statistical modelling, using dummy false start dates, found one
false date did improve results. Sargent 2012 reported a reduction
in AMI rates amongst older age groups and those aged 30 to 68
years, with reduced hospitalization costs observed at one year fol-
lowing the smoking ban. The upper age limit in this study was 105
years and 43.5% of the cohort were retired. Di Valentino 2015
also observed reduced admissions in those aged 65 years and older,
irrespective of gender for each year after the ban. A reduction in
admissions in younger age groups (under 65 years) was observed
in the first year after the ban. Barone-Adesi 2011 also observed
significant reductions in younger participants.
Hahn 2011 identified a reduction in AMI rates, significantly for
women but not for men. The gender differences may be explained
by the settings and work place bans in place. Jan 2014 also iden-
tified a reduction in AMI rates among women. The impact of a
subsequent tax increase on cigarette pricing was associated with
a significant reduction in AMI admissions. Liu 2013 identified
significant reductions in MI admissions in both genders, after ad-
justing for deprivation. Significant absolute risk reductions were
associated with men living in the most deprived areas compared
to those living in either middle-ranked or higher-ranked areas.
Cronin 2012 observed significantly reduced ACS admission rates
in men, in smokers and in nonsmokers after the introduction a
smoking ban in Ireland. Pell 2008 observed a 14% reduction in
admissions in smokers, a 19% reduction in ex-smokers and a 21%
reduction in admissions for nonsmokers. They note that of the
total reduction in admissions, 67% was attributable to nonsmok-
ers. Greater reductions were observed in men under 55 years and
women under 65 years. Christensen 2014 observed significant re-
ductions in AMI admissions; however, they could not explain the
difference detected post-ban after adjusting for age and gender
and in the absence of diabetes. The authors suggest that a separate
national ban on trans-fatty acids may have influenced their study
results. Bruintjes 2011 did not detect any significant difference
in admissions in Greeley (Colorado, USA) when compared to the
control area. However, they observed a significant reduction in
AMI admissions amongst smokers when compared to nonsmok-
ers after the introduction of the smoking ban in Greeley.
Stroke outcomes
Sixstudiesdetectedanassociationwith stroke admissions(Analysis
1.1.2), four studies using a control for comparison (Head 2012;
Herman 2011; Loomis 2012; Naiman 2010), and one study using
interrupted time series data (Mackay 2013). Juster 2007 used a
before-and-after method, reporting significant reductions in AMI
admission rates in New York, but not for stroke admissions.
Five studies did provide evidence of significant reductions in stroke
admissions following smoking bans. Head 2012, Herman 2011,
Loomis 2012 and Naiman 2010 detected significant declines in
admissions compared to their control areas.
Mackay 2013 identified increasing admission rates for cerebral in-
farction in Scotland, prior to the introduction of a smoking ban.

 Followingthe ban,andafterstatisticallyadjustingforconfounders,
there was a significant reduction in admissions for cerebral infarc-
tion (8.9%), persisting for 20 months following the legislation. No
interactions between subgroups were significant after adjustment
for confounders (e.g. gender, age, residence or deprivation index).
Respiratory outcomes
We found 21 studies assessing the association between smoking
bans and respiratory outcomes, including chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), asthma and lung function. Eleven stud-
ies reported COPD health outcomes: three studies used inter-
ruptedtime seriesdata(Croghan2015; Humair2014; Kent2012).
Six studies used quasi-experimental controlled before-and-after
methods (Dusemund 2015; Gaudreau 2013; Hahn 2014; Head
2012; Naiman 2010; Vander Weg 2012); the remaining two stud-
ies used an uncontrolled before-and-after design (McGhee 2014;
Yildiz 2015). Six of these studies additionally reported asthma
health outcomes (Croghan 2015; Gaudreau 2013; Head 2012;
Humair 2014; Kent 2012; Yildiz 2015).
Six studies only reported asthma outcomes: Herman 2011;
Landers 2014 (controlled before-and-after studies); Mackay 2010;
Millett 2013; Roberts 2012 and Sims 2013 (interrupted time se-
ries data). Four uncontrolled before-and-after studies identified
the impact of smoking bans on specific lung function outcomes
(Durham 2011; Goodman 2007; Larsson 2008; Rajkumar 2014).
COPD (Analysis 2.1)
Sixstudiesreportedconsistentreductions in COPD admissionsas-
sociated with smoking bans. Dusemund 2015 identified a 22.4%
reduction in admissions compared to the control area. Naiman
2010 reported reductions in admissions for COPD post-ban com-
pared to the control areas. Hahn 2014 reported, after adjusting for
trends and confounders, that those living in counties with com-
prehensive smoke-free bans were 22% less likely to be admitted for
COPD than those living in counties with weak or no bans. A dose
response was associated with smoking bans in place for more than
12 months, resulting in a 21% reduction in admissions. Protective
factors identified in the study were being male, aged 45 years to
65 years, and educated at least to secondary level (Hahn 2014).
Head2012 identifiedsignificantdifferencesinnon-Hispanicblack
and white residents in Beaumont compared to the control ar-
eas, and identified ethnic differences between both groups of resi-
dents. They found significant reductions in admissions for COPD
and asthma in non-Hispanic white residents only. Vander Weg
2012 and Humair 2014 observed dose-response associations with
lower COPD admissions; at 36 months after smoking legislation
when compared to controls, Humair 2014 observed reductions in
COPD admissions over the four time periods of the study.
Five studies reported no significant reductions in COPD admis-
sions. Gaudreau 2013 and Yildiz 2015 observed no significant as-
sociation; Croghan 2015 identified a downward trend in COPD
admissions, but this was not significant after adjusting for age and
gender. Kent 2012 detected increased admissions for pulmonary
diseases in general, with a significant different post-ban for pneu-
monia rates, but not for COPD. McGhee 2014 also reported in-
creased admissions for bronchitis and respiratory tract infections
post-ban, but no associations with COPD admissions.
Asthma (Analysis 2.2)
Seven of the 12 studies reported a significant association be-
tween smoking bans and reduced asthma hospitalizations. Sims
2013 observed that a significant reduction for nonsmokers was
equivalent to 1900 fewer admissions for each of the first three
years of the ban. Consistent reductions in asthma admissions
amongst children post-legislation ranged from 12.3% (Millett
2013), through 18.2% (Mackay 2010), up to 22% Herman 2011,
whilst Gaudreau 2013 observed no association between the ban
and reduced admissions for children or adults. Kent 2012 ob-
served reduced asthma admissions in younger age groups, whilst
Mackay 2010 identified increased asthma admissions among chil-
dren prior to the introduction of smoke-free legislation; admission
rates reduced in children post ban and these were not significantly
different in either the preschool age group or the 5- to 14-year age
group.
Croghan 2015 reported a step-change reduction in visits to emer-
gency departments for asthma. After statistical adjustment for po-
tential underlying temporal trends in hospital visits, they observed
significant reductions in hospitalization rates both for adults and
for children. Millett 2013 also observed increasing admissions
amongst children in the year before the ban. Post-ban decreases
were significant, even after adjusting for confounders. The authors
suggest a reduction of 6802 admissions could be identified in the
first three years of the ban.
Head 2012 observed significant reductions in discharge rates
among white non-Hispanic residents, but there was no significant
difference in discharges for black non-Hispanic residents. Landers
2014 identified significant reductions in admissions for adults of
working age and for children after the introduction of county
smoking laws. No significant associations were observed following
implementation of state laws.
Gaudreau 2013, Humair 2014, Roberts 2012 and Yildiz 2015
did not detect any significant reductions in asthma admissions
in adults following smoke-free bans; Roberts 2012 observed an
increase in hospitalization rates.
Lung function (Analysis 2.3)
There was evidence of improved lung function with significant re-
ductions in passive smoke exposure reported in hospitality workers
following smoking legislation (Durham 2011; Goodman 2007)
(Analysis 2.3). These findings are consistent with the evidence in
the earlierversionof the review. Lungfunctionimprovedforsmok-

 ers and nonsmokers (Goodman 2007), with improvements ob-
served in women and older participants (Durham 2011). Larsson
2008 did not observe improvements in lung function post-bans;
Rajkumar 2014 reported reduced episodes of coughing.
Inconsistent evidence emerged for COPD outcomes post-ban, but
there was more consistent evidence for reduced asthma admissions
and reduced passive smoke exposure.
Perinatal outcomes (Analysis 3.1)
Seven studies identified specific perinatal health outcomes (Amaral
2009; Cox 2013; Kabir 2013; Mackay 2012 (using interrupted
time series data); Bharadwaj 2012; Page 2012 (controlled be-
fore-and-after); Kabir 2009 (uncontrolled before-and-after)). The
emerging evidence identifies an association between smoking bans
and reductions in active smoking in pregnant women, and con-
sequent reductions in foetal passive smoke exposure. Bharadwaj
2012 and Page 2012 detected significant reductions in maternal
smoking compared to their controls.
Cox 2013 and Kabir 2009 identified a reduction in the risk of
preterm deliveries after adjusting for confounders. Kabir 2009 ob-
served an increase in the risk of low birth weight, which the authors
suggestmayreflectseculartrends. Bharadwaj 2012 andKabir 2013
observed a reduction in the risk of low and very low birth weights,
while Mackay 2012 detected significant reductions in small-for-
gestational-age babies and in rates of preterm delivery among both
current and nonsmokers, using a ban date three months prior to
implementation. Analyses using the later start date identified an
increase in preterm delivery rates following adjustment for pre-
eclampsia data.
Amaral 2009 noted that local ordinances were associated with
a decrease in very low and low birth weights and an increased
gestation period of 0.03 days. A dose-response effect for a more
restrictive statewide smoking ban resulted in an increased gestation
period for white and higher-educated mothers, and a significant
decrease in very low birth weights. For Hispanic mothers in this
study, there was a reduction in birth weights of 7.2 grams following
the introductionof statewide bans. Thisisaninverse dose-response
effect; the authors suggest the implementation of more restrictive
work place smoking bans may have led to increased smoking in
the home or greater exposure to secondhand smoke in the home.
Cox 2013 observed a reduced risk of preterm births during a
phased introduction of smoking bans. After the 2010 ban, there
was a reduction in preterm delivery; however, there were no sig-
nificant associations between the smoking ban and the risk of low
and very low birth weights or small-for-gestation-age. Although
Page 2012 observed reduced maternal smoking, there was no sig-
nificant impact of the ban on perinatal outcomes in comparison
with the control area. Page acknowledges that differences in the
intervention and control areas may have influenced the outcomes.
Mortality outcomes (Analysis 4.1)
We found 11 studies investigating associations between bans and
mortality rates. Five studies used interrupted time series methods
(Aguero 2013; Cox 2014; De Korte-De Boer 2012; Jan 2014;
Stallings-Smith 2013); two used quasi-experimental controlled be-
fore-and-after study designs (Dove 2010; Rodu 2012); and the re-
maining four studies used uncontrolled before-and-after methods
(Hurt 2012; McGhee 2014; Pell 2009; Villalbi 2011).
Aguero2013; Cox 2014; De Korte-De Boer2012; Dove 2010;Pell
2009; Rodu 2012; Stallings-Smith 2013; Villalbi 2011 provide ev-
idence of reduced smoking-related mortality (including cardiovas-
cular and respiratory) with consistent, temporal and dose-response
associations observed. Dove 2010 and Rodu 2012 observed tem-
poral and consistent reductions in AMI mortality rates when com-
pared to their control areas. Rodu identified significant reductions
in mortality, but the changes were not immediate in comparison
to the states where no smoking bans were in place. Dove observed
a dose response of continued reducing AMI mortality rates in the
second year of the ban. Similar trends were reported in Cox 2014.
Stallings-Smith 2013 and Stallings-Smith 2014, with a follow-up
period of 81 months, observed a 13% reduction in all-cause mor-
tality and a 26% reduction in deaths from ischaemic heart disease
(IHD), a 32% reduction in stroke deaths and a 38% reduction
in COPD mortality. The 2014 paper identified significant reduc-
tions in inequalities in smoking-related mortality. For IHD and
COPD, the reductions were strongest in the most deprived ter-
tile. Following the smoking ban in Ireland, a reduction in stroke
mortality rates was observed across all socioeconomic groups. Pell
2008 detected a significant dose response associated with higher
rates of ACS mortality in nonsmokers who had higher levels of
measured cotinine.
Aguero 2013 and Villalbi 2011 identified reduced AMI mortal-
ity rates, with Aguero 2013 observing lower rates in women and
Villalbi 2011 reporting significant reductions, even after adjusting
for gender and age. McGhee 2014 observed a reduction in lung
cancer diagnoses, although the authors suggest that this change
was not attributable to the introduction of the smoking ban. Jan
2014 identified reducing AMI mortality rates in the pre-ban years
between 2001 and 2008, but found no significant association post-
legislation, in the 2008 to 2010 period. Whilst Hurt 2012 ob-
served a 17% reduction in the incidence of sudden cardiac deaths
in the 18-month period post ban, the result was not statistically
significant.
Active smoking and reduced secondhand exposure
Twenty-four studies investigate associations between smoking
bans and passive and active smoke exposure. Six studies used in-
terrupted time series designs, four used a quasi-experimental con-
trolled before-and-after study design, and 14 are before-and-after
studies with no control population (Analysis 5.1). Three studies
did not report smoking status data from their main data sets, but
17

 accessed smoking prevalence data from national surveys (Cesaroni
2008; Cox 2014; Ferrante 2012).
We found active smoking measures including smoking prevalence,
quit rates and tobacco consumption reported in 19 studies (Bajoga
2011; Bharadwaj 2012; Cesaroni 2008; Cox 2014; Federico 2012;
Ferrante 2012; Gallus 2007; Gualano 2014; Hahn 2008; Hurt
2012; Jones 2015; Kabir 2009; Klein 2014; Lee 2011; Lemstra
2008; Lippert 2012; Mackay 2011; Mackay 2012; Page 2012).
Reduced smoke exposure outcomes are reported in four studies
(Durham 2011; Goodman 2007; Pell 2008; Rajkumar 2014).
Larsson 2008 includes evidence of both active and secondhand
exposures.
Active smoking (Analysis 5.1)
Five studies used ITS methods to analyse national or regional pop-
ulation smoking behaviour (Bajoga 2011 multinational; Federico
2012; Gualano 2014 Italy; Mackay 2011 Scotland; Jones 2015
Scotland and England). Bajoga 2011 covered 13 US states, four
Canadian provinces, and four other areas (Republic of Ireland
(ROI), Northern Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand). In all but three
of these (Ireland, Delaware and New Mexico) there was already a
significantly declining smoking prevalence prior to the introduc-
tion of smoking bans. After introduction of the bans there was
an immediate decline in prevalence in two areas (Washington and
ROI) and a faster rate of decline in a further six US states. In the
other 13 locations there was no identifiable change in the trend. In
Italy, Federico 2012 found some evidence of short-term impact,
while the longer period analysed by Gualano 2014 did not detect
evidence that the ban had changed the pre-existing rate of de-
cline in prevalence. In Scotland, Mackay 2011 also detected only
a short-term impact on prevalence just before the introduction of
legislation, before a return to the pre-existing rate of decline. Jones
2015 did not detect an association in either Scotland or England,
but in England there were only two data points after the ban.
One study used ITS methods to analyse smoking prevalence
among low-income pregnant women in Ohio (Klein 2014). Pre-
conception smoking rates had been stable in the six years prior to
the ban, whereas after the ban there was a small but statistically
significant reduction in prevalence.
Two studies used a controlled design to analyse population preva-
lence data: Ferrante 2012 (comparing Sante Fe to Buenos Aires,
Argentina) and Hahn 2008 (comparing Fayette County to other
counties in the state of Kentucky). Bharadwaj 2012 (Norway)
and Page 2012 (Pueblo City, Colorado) (controlled before-and-
after studies) reported both active and passive health outcomes.
Ferrante 2012 identifiedanonsignificantdecline innational smok-
ing prevalence rates in Sante Fe compared to the control area,
Buenos Aires. They noted more quit attempts in Santa Fe than in
Buenos Aires prior to the introduction of smoke-free legislation in
Argentina. However, they reported no change in the proportion
of daily smokers or the number of cigarettes consumed in either
city.
Hahn 2008 identified significant reductions in smoking preva-
lence after the introduction of bans compared to control coun-
ties, even after controlling for seasonality, time trends and demo-
graphic characteristics. Bharadwaj 2012 identified reduced active
smoking and higher quit rates during pregnancy amongst women
working in bars and restaurants compared to women working in
other settings with no bans. Page 2012 observed a reduction in
maternal smoking in Pueblo when compared to the control area,
but no reduction in maternal smoking in Pueblo post-ban. The
authors acknowledge that statistically significant differences be-
tween the areas at baseline reporting may have influenced the re-
sults in Pueblo.
Eight studies used uncontrolled before-and-after methods to mea-
sure changes in active smoking: Cesaroni 2008 (Italy); Cox 2014
(Belgium); Gallus 2007 (Italy); Hurt 2012 (Minnesota); Lee 2011
(England); Lippert 2012 (17 US States); Lemstra 2008 (Saska-
toon, Canada); Mackay 2012 (Scotland). Active and passive smok-
ing were reported in a further two uncontrolled before-and-after
studies: Kabir 2009 (Ireland); Larsson 2008 (Sweden).
While Gallus 2007 did not identify a reduction in smoking in
the years prior to the ban, they found evidence of reduced preva-
lence in the population after the smoking ban was introduced.
Kabir 2009 also identified a reduction in Irish maternal smok-
ing rates post-ban and increased smoking cessation prior to preg-
nancy in 2005. Lee 2011 did not detect significant changes in
smoking prevalence trends or in the number of cigarettes smoked
per day, after controlling for time and other trends. The study
reported significantly reduced smoking in cars and in homes, and
increased smoking behaviours outside, with a reduced consump-
tion of cigarettes. Similarly, Larsson 2008 did not detect any sig-
nificant change in smoking prevalence in a small cohort of hos-
pitality employees, including casino and bingo hall workers, one
year following introduction of smoking bans.
Lippert 2012 reported significant reductions in smoking preva-
lence in 14 of the 17 US states after the introduction of smoking
bans. The implementation of smoking bans in this study varied by
state, ranging from either a ban in work places, restaurants and bars
(Arizona, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland,
Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Puerto Rico, Utah) or restaurants
and bars (Colorado, New Hampshire, New Mexico). Pennsylva-
nia had a ban in the work place, and Louisiana and Nevada had
bans in work places and restaurants. The follow-up periods ranged
from two to four years after the introduction of smoking bans, and
reductions in smoking prevalence were noted in all states irrespec-
tive of the comprehensiveness of the ban. The highest reduction
in smoking prevalence was reported in New Hampshire; Utah was
the only state reporting no change in prevalence.
Mackay 2012 detected reduced smoking prevalence after the in-
troduction of a ban, with an increased number of people who re-
ported they had “never smoked”. They found a steep decline in
smoking in the three months prior to the introduction of the ban;
18

 however, the associationwith reducedprevalence wasnotsustained
during the post-ban period. Prescribing of nicotine replacement
therapy (NRT) was significantly higher prior to the legislation,
with increased quit attempts. Similarly, the associations were not
sustained in the post-legislation period. Lemstra 2008 detected
reduced smoking and increased quit attempts in Saskatoon after
the smoking ban was introduced. The study compared their re-
sults with data from the wider state of Saskatchewan and from all
of Canada, and reported significant reductions in smoking preva-
lence in Saskatoon compared to both comparisons areas.
Cesaroni 2008 (Italy), Cox 2014 (Belgium) and Hurt 2012 (Min-
nesota) all reported reduced smoking prevalence rates after smok-
ing bans were introduced. The evidence was from specific na-
tional data sources and not from their respective study data sets.
Cox 2014 reported national Belgian health survey data (pre-/
post-ban) identifying decreased smoking prevalence and decreas-
ing consumption specifically amongst heavy smokers (more than
20 cigarettes a day). While Hurt 2012 identified reducing trends in
smoking prevalence in Minnesota from national data, they found
no evidence of significant differences in smoking prevalence from
specific study data.
Effects on smoking behaviour in subgroups
A number of studies in Analysis 5.1 included subgroup analyses
for a combination of variables, including gender, age and socioe-
conomic group (Cesaroni 2008; Cox 2014; Federico 2012; Gallus
2007; Gualano 2014; Jones 2015; Kabir 2009; Klein 2014; Lee
2011).
Cox 2014 identified a reduction in national smoking prevalence
post-ban for both men and women, with specific evidence for re-
duced smoking trends in women. Federico 2012 found decreased
smoking trends for men and women in the initial post-ban period,
but the reductions were not maintained and smoking prevalence
rates returned to pre-ban levels, especially amongst those with
lower education. Cesaroni 2008 found the association to be sta-
tistically significant in men but not women, and observed greater
reductions in smoking in residents living in lower socioeconomic
areas than those living in higher socioeconomic areas. Gallus 2007
also observed reduced smoking prevalence post-ban, confirming a
significant reduction in smoking in men and in those aged 15 to
44 years. Gualano 2014 identified a reduction in smoking preva-
lence for men and women and a reduction in smoking intensity,
and found reduced smoking in younger age groups, irrespective
of gender, and lower prevalence rates in older women. Increased
smoking trends (prevalence and consumption) were identified in
women aged 45 to 64 years, but the evidence was not statistically
significant. Overall, reductions in smoking prevalence were not
associated with Italian smoke-free legislation after statistical mod-
elling Gualano 2014. Similar results were reported by Jones 2015
who found reduced consumption in men aged 18 to 34 years,
but there was no significant reduction in consumption in older
women and significantly higher consumption in women aged 35
to 54 years in England compared to Scotland. Evidence of reduced
consumption in men aged 55 and older was reported from Scot-
tish data (Jones 2015). The study reported inconclusive findings
and limited evidence of an association with smoking prevalence
after statistical adjustment.
Klein 2014 reported lower odds of preconceptual smoking
amongst low-income women after the introduction of a smoking
ban, even after adjusting for multiple confounders including age,
income, education, residence and parity. Kabir 2009 found similar
reductions in Irish maternal smoking rates after statistical adjust-
ment.
Lee 2011 did not identify evidence of reduced smoking prevalence
after adjusting for confounders; however, they detected reduced
smoking trends in older respondents, with evidence of higher
smoking rates in women and in younger age groups. Significant
reductions in active smoking in cars and inside homes were re-
ported in this study, consistent with evidence in Pell 2008.
Reduced secondhand exposure (Analysis 5.2)
Studies identifying specific passive smoke exposure outcomes for
this update had to include evidence of health outcomes, which we
have presentedinprevioussections. Fouruncontrolledbefore-and-
after studies (Durham 2011 (Switzerland); Goodman 2007 (Ire-
land); Pell 2008 (Scotland); Rajkumar 2014 (Switzerland)) pro-
vided evidence of reduced passive smoke exposure in addition to
health outcomes. Larsson 2008 (Sweden) provides evidence for
both active smoking and secondhand exposures, using an uncon-
trolled before-and-after design.
Evidence of reduced passive smoke exposure was detected follow-
ing the introduction of smoking bans, consistent with evidence
from the previous version of the review (Durham 2011; Goodman
2007; Larsson 2008; Rajkumar 2014; Pell 2008) (Analysis 5.2).
Health outcomes for these studies are presented in Analysis 2.1
and in Analysis 1.1 for Pell 2008.
D I S C U S S I O N
Legislation restricting or prohibiting smoking in work places and
public places is a public health measure at the population level.
There were no randomized controlled trials where the intervention
was a smoking ban. The predominant study designs evaluating the
effectiveness of smoking bans were interrupted time series studies,
quasi-experimental before-and-after studies with a control area for
comparison, and before-and-after studies with no control area for
reference. Three studies used matched areas for comparison of
controls (Hahn 2014; Khuder 2007; Seo 2007). While the before-
and-after studies with no controls were often unable to control
for possible confounders and changes in secular trends over time,
the interrupted time series studies used statistical modelling in an
19

 attempt to adjust for these effects in analyses. However, because
of uncertainty about the underlying trends, some study authors
noted that their results were sensitive to the choice of model.
The evidence supports a temporal association between the intro-
duction of national smoke-free bans and subsequent reductions
in smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Evidence for smok-
ing bans in improving cardiovascular, respiratory and perinatal
health outcomes for both smokers and nonsmokers is persuasive.
The evidence in this update identified a dose-response association,
with sustained and improved health outcomes over time, specif-
ically cardiovascular. As the period since bans were enacted has
lengthened, improvements in health outcomes have increased or
have been maintained. Evidence in this review identified improved
health outcomes for nonsmokers in relation to cardiovascular and
asthma health outcomes and to reduced mortality rates. Evidence
of a biologically plausible effect emerged in studies examining
STEMI admissions. Schmucker 2014 detected reduced STEMI
rates for nonsmokers compared to smokers, with identified di-
vergent trends in the incidence of disease observed. Di Valentino
2015 also suggests a biological plausibility, with reduced STEMI
admissions in those aged 65 or older; however, smoking status was
not reported in this study.
Perinatal outcomes provide evidence of reduced maternal smoking
and acknowledged impact on foetal health. Inconsistent evidence
emerged for other outcomes, including birth weights. The bene-
fits identified in some studies are consistent with those reported in
Been 2014, Jones 2014 and Kelleher 2014; however, the studies
in this review do not provide compelling evidence of a clear as-
sociation between smoke-free legislation and improved perinatal
outcomes; we need more evidence to confirm or refute such asso-
ciations.
Consistent evidence of reduced mortality is reported, with an ob-
served temporal dose-response effect. Statistically significant re-
ductions and downward trends were noted for cardiovascular and
respiratory illnesses. Evidence of a reduction in mortality in lower
socioeconomic groups is persuasive, especially in Stallings-Smith
2014, given the duration of the study period (81 months).
As in the previous version of this review, inconsistent evidence
emerged of the impact of smoking bans on reducing smoking
prevalence rates and tobacco consumption.
The studies in this review are heterogeneous in their design, popu-
lations and interventions, and we were unable to perform statisti-
cal comparisons or meta-analyses. Despite the different study de-
signs, this update provides more methodologically robust studies
than those reported in the first version, incorporating large data
sets facilitating modelling and regression analyses and adjusting
for non-linear trends and confounders. The majority of studies
have evaluated comprehensive smoking bans; only 18 studies in-
vestigated partial bans. Significant improvements in health out-
comes were reported in countries where comprehensive bans were
in place and compared to areas with either no ban or partial bans.
Since the first version of this review (2010), there has been an
increase in countries worldwide implementing national smoke-
free bans. The FCTC (WHO 2014) identified an 84% increase
in countries implementing smoking policies, and a 61% increase
in countries implementing complete smoking bans.
The 2008 MPOWER evidence-based measures include protec-
tion from tobacco smoke to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and
mortality (WHO 2009; WHO 2013). The results from the orig-
inal review indicated that introducing legislative smoking bans
leads to a reduction in exposure to passive smoke. Key population
groups benefiting from the enactment of legislative smoking bans
reported in this review include pregnant women and their babies,
children and nonsmokers. There is also evidence of improved car-
diovascular outcomes for smokers in three studies (Bruintjes 2011;
Cronin 2012; Pell 2008).
Socioeconomic gradients indicate that men in lower socioeco-
nomic groups are benefiting from the effect of smoke-free legis-
lation. In the original version of the review, the evidence of the
impact for active smoking was unclear but indicated a downward
trend. The studies included in this update provide some evidence
of reductionsinsmokingprevalence. However, anumberof studies
did not detect evidence of a change in prevalence, or change in rate
of decline in prevalence, associated with the introduction of bans,
irrespective of the population studies. Four studies (Bharadwaj
2012; Kabir 2009; Klein 2014; Mackay 2012) identified declining
smoking rates in pregnant women, but this was not borne out for
all studies.
Limitations in studies included in this review are the absence of
randomised trials. The inevitable reliance on observational data
means that we can only identify correlations between the intro-
duction of smoking restrictions, and the health and behavioural
outcomes of interest. The studies using national population sur-
veys employed random sampling or stratified sampling techniques.
The data sets used in many studies were relatively large and al-
lowed for statistical modelling and adjustment for possible con-
founders. Small sample sizes are reported in a number of the stud-
ies which used volunteer samples recruited within the hospital-
ity sector. A number of studies did not report sample sizes, and
individual-level data were not available within large registry data
sets, which limited analyses for confounders, e.g. smoking status
and comorbidities. Other confounders included increased pricing
of cigarettes during study periods, removal of trans-fatty acids in
foods, and suspension of bans. These and other factors may have
led to changes in health outcomes over the study periods which
could not be controlled for in analyses. These may have influenced
the reported results. It is possible that some studies that did not
detect changes in health outcomes have not been published and
are unavailable for inclusion in this review. However, this update
includes some studies that did not identify a positive impact of
smoking bans. We excluded from this review studies reporting
20

 only cotinine biomarkers; studies reporting passive smoke expo-
sure had to include a measured health outcome. This provided a
wider body of literature, but there are few studies which verified
smoker status. Smoker status was reported in 24 studies in this
review, and verified in only four.
From a public health perspective the impact of smoking legis-
lation is to reduce passive smoke exposure and to reduce active
smoking. Since first publication of this review in 2010, the evi-
dence is mounting and the concentration of studies clearly iden-
tifies reduced passive smoke exposure with associated reductions
in morbidity and mortality post-smoking bans. Smoking policies
usually comprise multicomponent efforts to tackle smoking cessa-
tion as well as the public health objective of reducing exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke. Populations exposed to smoking
restrictions are likely to be exposed to other interventions. The
implementation of comprehensive legislation on smoking will ne-
cessitate other tobacco control measures to prepare for its success-
ful implementation, such as increased media awareness, telephone
smoking cessation helplines, and smoking cessation support ser-
vices to ensure awareness, comprehension and support for those
affected by it (Callinan 2010). The effectiveness of legislative ef-
forts will also depend on successful enforcement of smoking bans
and compliance with the legislation. Other tobacco control mea-
sures, such as taxation on tobacco products, limits on advertising
and sponsorship, and limits on the sale of tobacco products, may
vary between jurisdictions. A comprehensive approach to tobacco
control will utilize both individual and population-based inter-
vention strategies, causing difficulties in evaluating the effect of a
single intervention such as the smoking ban legislation.

Implications for practice
This updated review identified moderate-quality evidence that
countries and their populations benefit from enacting national
legislative smoking bans with improved health outcomes from re-
duced exposures to passive smoke, specifically cardiovascular dis-
ease. There was also low-quality evidence of reduced mortality for
smoking-related illnesses. The evidence on perinatal and respira-
tory health outcomes is not consistent, nor is the evidence on po-
tential reductions in tobacco consumption.
Implications for research
We needresearch onthe continuedlonger-termimpactof smoking
bans on the health outcomes of specific subgroups of the popula-
tion, such as young children, disadvantaged and minority groups.
More robust research on the impact of smoking bans is warranted,
especially in relation to respiratory and perinatal health outcomes.
Documenting of active smoking in studies should be more con-
sistent and should use validation methods. Documentation of ex-
smokers should include information on previous smoking history
and duration of quit times. Robust study designs (including those
with a control for comparison) reporting passive smoke exposures
and health-related outcomes need to include biological coherence
criteria.

Setting: Hospital admissions for AMI
Design: controlled before-and-after study
Intervention: City of Pueblo,
Control: Pueblo county outside city limits, El Paso county
Analysis: RRs and 95% CI of AMI, Poisson regression model with adjustment for sea-
sonality; Chi² to test whether there were significant differences in demographic variables
between pre-law and post-law groups
Participants

to hospital between January 2002 and June 2006. Numbers of fatal AMIs were also
gathered. Residence within the city of Pueblo was ascertained with the participant’s zip
code. Data on AMI hospitalization rates was also obtained in a neighbouring county (El
Paso County) during the identical period as a contemporaneous control group
No totals
Interventions
Smoke-free air act implementation and enforcement began in July 2003 which banned
smoking in work places and all buildings open to the public, including bars, restaurants,

Outcomes
Poisson regression analysis to identify differences in monthly AMI admissions post-
legislation
No significant reduction in AMI rates observed post-legislation
Results identified a steep decline in AMI rates 2000 to 2005 prior to legislation. 2 smaller
communities in Colorado previously enacted smoke-free legislation and identified 27%
reduction in AMI hospitalizations (Bruintjes 2011)
Follow-up: 20 months
Notes
AMI admissions classified using ICD Principal Diagnosis codes
Secondary diagnoses of AMI excluded to enhance diagnostic accuracy
Poisson regression modelling used to fit time series for AMI monthly admissions. Ad-
justed models for secular trends, seasonal trends and post-ordinance effect
Adjusted for 11 local smoke-free ordinances

compared to a control county, Delaware County, Indiana. Medical records from Bloom-
ington Hospital, Monroe County and Ball Memoria,l Hospital in Delaware County,
Indiana were used to compare the incidence of admission for AMI in non-smoking and
smoking patients who were resident in Monroe County and Delaware County
Outcomes
Incidence rates of non-smoking and smoking patients admitted to hospital with a pri-
mary or secondary diagnosis of AMI for 22-month period and who did not have any
past cardiac history before the admission nor have hypertension or high cholesterol co-
morbidity for the periods (August 2001 - May 2003 vs August 2003 - May 2005)
Biochemical verification of smoking status: No
Follow-up: 2 years following 1st ordinance
Notes
Population increased by 0.4% in Monroe and decreased by 0.8% in Delaware County
between 2000 and 2004

Participants
Current daily smokers who were 15 years old in the analysis. A total of 3740 and 2958 current daily smokers responded
to the THS2005 and THS2008 respectively
Hardcore smokers defined using 6 criteria: (1) daily smokers, (2) had a smoking history of at least 6 years, (3) had
no history of quit attempts in the past, (4) did not want to give up smoking, (5) smoked at least 11 cigarettes per day
on average, and (6) were 26 years or above

Outcomes
To estimate the age- and sex-specific prevalence of hardcore smokers before and after the comprehensive legislation
in Hong Kong
The response rate was 77% for THS2005 and 75% for THS2008
Results: 21.8% and 27.4% of Hong Kong daily smokers aged 15 years or older were considered hardcore in 2005
and 2008 respectively. The prevalence of hardcore smokers increased from 23.8% to 29.4% in men and from 10.6%
to 16.3% in women, and also increased in all the 5 age groups from 2005 to 2008. The hardcore smoking prevalence
increased with age, reaching the highest in the 50 - 59-year age group, and then dropped in the 60+ age group in
both cohorts

Perez-Rios 2015
Methods
Country: Spain
Setting: Population-based
Method: Uncontrolled before-and-after study
Analysis: Descriptive and Chi² analysis
Participants
2 independent, cross-sectional, population-based surveys were carried out among adults 18 years and older in 2006
and 2011
Telephone interviews
Surveys used the same methods and questionnaire
Nicotine dependence was assessed with the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence and readiness to quit
The study participants were selected by 2-stage sampling strategy with stratification in households. To guarantee
national representativeness, households were stratified by geographical region and the size of the municipality. Sec-
ond-stage units were residents in the previously selected households, where only 1 person was selected at random.
Households within each municipality were randomly selected using a landline telephone directory as the sampling
frame
2522 adults were interviewed in 2006 and 2504 in 2011
Interventions
December 2010, Spanish parliament passed a comprehensive smoking law amending and strengthening 2006 ban.
The amended law extended smoking restrictions to all hospitality premises, thereby making Spanish work places
smoke-free from January 2, 2011
Outcomes
Tobacco prevalence, tobacco consumption, readiness to quit

Overall the study identified those
living in counties with comprehen-
sive smoke-free laws were 22% less
likely to be hospitalized for COPD
compared to those living in coun-
ties with weak or no laws. Counties
that had smoking bans in place for
> 12 months were 21% less likely
to be hospitalized for COPD com-
pared to communities with laws <
12 months or no laws
The study found that smoke-free
policies can improve health out-
comes and can negate risk factors in-
cluding lower socioeconomic status
and living in rural tobacco-growing
communities

There was no effect on birth weight for mothers who

The impact of fathers’ smoking status on birth weight
identified a decrease of 77.09 grams in the treatment
group (significant at 10% level)
Further analyses on the impact of birth weight on later
life success predicted that at age 28 years, a 100 gram
increase in birth weight could increase adult income by
1.8%. For the sample in the study, their birth weight
increase of 164 grams would translate into a 2.7% in-

This study identified that mothers working in bars and
restaurants after smoke-free legislation was introduced
were 15% more like to quit smoking and this impacted
on increased birth weights and on lower incidences of

Unadjusted estimates of 3726 smoking-related
deaths (95% CI 2305 to 4629) were probably pre-
vented as a result of smoke-free legislation, primar-
ily due to reduced passive smoke exposure
Follow-up paper mortality rates and socioeconomic
status (2000 to 2010) Stallings-Smith 2014 identi-
fied smoking ban reduced inequalities in smoking-
related mortality
2 factors emerged explaining 81% of the variance:
Structural factors were characterised with high load-
ings on education, occupation, foreign nationality
and family composition
Material aspects loaded in the 2nd factor included:
unemployment, housing tenure and car access
No post-ban annual trend effects were detected for
any cause of death in the period 2000 to 2007
Post-ban mortality effects of structural socioeco-
nomic indicators identified a reduction in smoking-
related inequalities
For IHD and COPD mortality rates, reductions
were strongest in the most deprived tertile; decreases
in stroke mortality were observed across all socioe-

For this update we restricted inclusion of studies which reported passive smoke exposure to those which also reported health outcomes.
We excluded studies which included outcome data with only cotinine measures, due to the established and unequivocal evidence that
passive smoke exposure is controlled by legislative bans (Callinan 2010).
We have changed the objectives to reflect this, and to make the primary objective the effect on health outcomes, and the secondary
objective the effect on smoking behaviour.
We have revised the title of this update from Legislative bans for reducing smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption to Legislative
smoking bans for reducing harms from secondhand smoke exposure, smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption.
We have limited smoking prevalence studies to those where general population smoking prevalence outcomes are reported.
We have completed ’Risk of bias’ assessments for the 12 studies reported in the original review and for all new studies included in this
update.
We have included a ’Summary of findings’ table in this update.
