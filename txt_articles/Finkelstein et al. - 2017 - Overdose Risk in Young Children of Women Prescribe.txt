abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Over the past 20 years, the prescribing of opioids has increased 
dramatically in North America, with parallel increases in opioid addiction, overdose, and 
associated deaths. We examined whether young children of women prescribed opioids were 
at increased risk of opioid overdose.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based, nested case control study in Ontario, Canada, 
between 2002 and 2015. We identified children aged ≤10 years, whose mothers received 
publicly funded prescriptions for an opioid or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug 
(comparator analgesic) in the preceding year. Cases were children who presented to 
hospital for or died of opioid overdose. Each case was matched with 4 controls with no 
opioid overdose. The primary outcome was the risk of opioid overdose.
RESULTS: We identified 103 children who presented to the hospital with opioid overdose and 
matched them with 412 controls. Half of the children with opioid overdose were <2 years 
old. Compared with controls, children with an opioid overdose were far more likely to have 
a mother who received a prescription opioid (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.68–3.45) and who was prescribed antidepressants. The most commonly 
implicated overdose opioids were codeine (53.4%), oxycodone (32.0%), and methadone 
(15.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Young children of mothers prescribed opioids are at a markedly increased risk 
of overdose. Physicians, pharmacists, and parents should take measures to mitigate the risk 
of opioid-related harm to children, such as prescribing smaller quantities, emphasizing the 
importance of secure medication storage, and the prompt disposal of unused opioids.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The increase 
in opioid prescribing in North America over the 
past 2 decades has led to the worst drug overdose 
epidemic in history. However, the impact of 
prescription opioids on young children in the home 
has not been well studied.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Young children of mothers 
prescribed opioids are at a markedly increased risk 
of overdose. Providers should take measures to 
mitigate the risk of pediatric opioid-related harm, 
such as prescribing smaller quantities, facilitating 
secure storage, and prompt disposal of unused 
opioids.

The increased prescribing of opioids 
for chronic pain over the past 2 
decades has led to dramatic parallel 
increases in opioid misuse, addiction, 
and opioid-related deaths in North 
America, 
 
1, 
 
2 resulting in what the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention have deemed the worst 
drug overdose epidemic in history. 
3, 
 
4 
More than 250 000 Americans have 
died of opioids over the past 20 
years, and roughly 7000 are treated 
each day in emergency departments 
across the United States for opioid 
misuse.4 Similar phenomena have 
been observed in Canada, 
 
5 the United 
Kingdom, 
 
6 and Australia. 
7
Although a great deal of harm 
associated with prescription opioids 
involves patients, misuse and 
overdose can also occur as the result 
of diversion, medication sharing, and 
other indirect mechanisms. However, 
the impact of prescription opioids 
on young children in the home has 
not been well studied. 
8 Scattered 
reports describe unintentional opioid 
exposures in children, 
 
8 
– 
10 but no 
reliable estimates exist regarding 
the specific risk to young children 
from opioids prescribed to family 
members. Young children are 
particularly prone to unintentional 
overdoses involving substances in 
their immediate environment and, 
less commonly, as victims of neglect 
or malice.11
To determine the potential 
downstream impact of parental 
opioids prescribing on their young 
children, we explored whether 
maternal receipt of prescription 
opioids is associated with an 
increased risk of overdose harm to 
young children in the home.
METHODS
Setting and Data Sources
We conducted a population-based, 
nested case control study between 
April 1, 2002 and March 31, 2015 
in Ontario, Canada. We identified 
prescription claims using the 
publicly funded Ontario Public Drug 
Benefit Database. This database 
contains prescription information 
for all Ontario residents who 
receive social assistance. This is a 
subset of the Ontario population 
(∼13.8 million): those receiving 
prescription medications subsidized 
by the province. All such residents 
receive all their medications, 
including over-the-counter 
medications, such as nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), 
free-of-charge, and all dispensed 
medications, including over-the-
counter drugs, are captured in this 
database. Therefore, we identified 
all opioid and NSAID prescriptions 
reimbursed under this drug benefit 
plan during the study period. We 
used the Canadian Institute for 
Health Information Discharge 
Abstract Database, which contains 
detailed diagnostic information for 
all hospital admissions in Ontario, 
and we identified emergency 
department visits using the National 
Ambulatory Care Report System. We 
used the Ontario Health Insurance 
Plan database to identify claims for 
physician services, and obtained 
basic demographic data and dates 
of death from the Registered 
Persons Database, a registry of all 
Ontario residents eligible for health 
insurance. The Ontario Registrar 
General Death Database identified 
the cause of death reported on 
individual death certificates up to 
December 2012, the most recent data 
available. We identified mother–child 
pairs using birth records, as done 
previously. 
12, 
 
13 These databases 
were linked in an anonymous fashion 
using encrypted health card numbers 
and are routinely used to study drug 
safety.

–16
Study Subjects
We defined cases as children aged 
≤10 years whose mothers received 
subsidized medications via Ontario’s 
publicly funded drug plan and 
who presented to the hospital for 
opioid toxicity. Opioid overdose 
was defined using the International 
Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, Tenth 
Revision codes T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, 
T40.3, T40.4, and T40.6. We also 
included children who died of opioid 
overdose in the prehospital setting, 
identified using the International 
Classification of Diseases and Related 
Health Problems, Ninth Revision 
codes X40–X49, X60–X69, X85–X90, 
Y10–Y19 and the Ontario Registrar 
General Death database, as validated 
previously. 
17 We excluded children 
>10 years of age to avoid inclusion 
of overdoses related to voluntary 
drug misuse, which is rare before 
adolescence. Only the first hospital 
presentation was considered for 
children with multiple episodes. 
The date of hospital presentation 
or death served as the index date 
for all analyses. For each case, 
we randomly selected 4 control 
children without an opioid overdose, 
matching on age (within 6 months) 
and sex. Each individual could serve 
as a control only once. To account 
for temporal changes in analgesic 
prescribing over the study period, 
each control subject was randomly 
assigned an index date within 6 
months of his or her corresponding 
case.
Case and control children were 
linked to their mothers using birth 
records, as done previously. 
18 
Among mothers of case and control 
children, we identified those 
who received either an opioid or 
an NSAID in the year preceding 
their child’s opioid overdose. We 
chose NSAIDs as the reference 
exposure because, like opioids, 
they are primarily prescribed for 
analgesia and because individuals 
who receive analgesics for chronic 
pain are frequently inherently 
different from those who do 
not. Because those women’s 
prescription costs are covered by 
the provincial government, they

are unlikely to obtain NSAIDs 
without a prescription. Finally, to 
focus on maternal prescriptions, we 
also excluded children who were 
prescribed an opioid or NSAID for 
themselves in the 100 days before 
the index date.
Statistical Analysis
We compared the baseline 
characteristics of cases and controls 
using P values ( 
Table 1). We used 
conditional logistic regression to 
estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the association between pediatric 
opioid overdose and maternal 
receipt of an opioid prescription. 
This is a specialized type of logistic 
regression used when cases with 
a specific outcome are matched 
with multiple controls; each case 
and his or her corresponding 
controls represent a stratum in the 
analysis. Other covariates were not 
included in the model to preserve 
model fit. In all analyses, maternal 
receipt of an NSAID prescription 
in the year preceding the index 
date constituted the reference 
exposure. We used SAS version 9.3 
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) for all 
analyses, and a two-tailed type 1 
error rate of .05 as the threshold for 
statistical significance. The study 
was approved by the Research 
Ethics Board of Sunnybrook Health 
Sciences Centre (Toronto, Ontario, 
Canada).
RESULTS
We identified 103 children aged 
≤10 years with an opioid overdose, 
whose mothers received an opioid 
or NSAID under Ontario’s publicly 
funded provincial drug plan in the 
previous year and matched them to 
412 controls ( 
Table 1). The median 
age was 2 years (interquartile 
range [IQR], 1–3 years), and 9 
(8.7%) overdoses involved infants 
<12 months. Thirty-nine (37.9%) 
children were admitted to the 
hospital, including 13 to critical 
care units. No deaths were recorded 
in this cohort. The median ages 
of case and control mothers 
were 28 years (IQR, 23–32 years) 
and 28 years (IQR, 24–34 years), 
respectively. A larger proportion 
of case mothers had been 
prescribed antidepressants 
compared with control mothers 
( 
Table 1).
Overall, maternal receipt of an opioid 
prescription was associated with 
a substantially increased risk of 
pediatric opioid overdose (OR, 2.41; 
95% CI, 1.68–3.45) ( 
Table 2). Among 
cases, the most commonly implicated 
opioids were codeine (53.4%), 
oxycodone (32.0%), and methadone 
(15.5%).
DISCUSSION
In this population-based study, we 
found that young children of women 
prescribed an opioid were at a 
significantly higher risk of opioid 
overdose than children of women 
prescribed a NSAID. Half of children 
who presented to the hospital with 
opioid overdose were <2 years. The 
use of antidepressants by the mother

was associated with an increased risk 
for pediatric opioid overdose and 
may reflect the complex associations 
between chronic pain, addiction, and 
psychiatric comorbidities, such as 
depression. This study is the first to 
explore and contextualize the risk 
of overdose in young children of 
mothers prescribed opioids.
Our findings underscore the 
importance of secure storage of 
potentially toxic medications, such 
as opioids. Roughly 65% of all acute 
poison exposures reported to Poison 
Information Centers involve preschool 
children and are largely preventable. 
Rising rates of unintentional pediatric 
poisonings are strongly correlated 
with the increased use of adult 
drugs, dominated by prescription 
medications, 
 
19 and are associated with 
increased health care use, including 
emergency department visits 
20 and 
hospitalizations. 
21, 
 
22 Campaigns, such 
as the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention’s “Up and Away” 
initiative, 
23 have the goal of reducing 
unintentional exposures among young 
children through parental education 
about safe medication handling and 
storage. Unused opioids may be 
subject to misuse or unintentional 
ingestion in the future. 
10 In light of the 
potentially fatal toxicity of opioids, 
parental awareness augmented by 
physician and pharmacist guidance 
should help reduce unintentional 
opioid exposures. Clinicians who 
provide care to young children should 
inquire specifically about prescription 
and nonprescription opioid use in 
the child’s environment as part of the 
ongoing effort to curb unintentional 
opioid overdose.
In our analysis, half of the children 
who presented to the hospital with an 
opioid overdose were <2 years, and 
1 in 10 opioid overdoses occurred in 
infants <12 months. This observation 
is noteworthy because infants of 
this age rarely exhibit purposeful 
coordination and the necessary 
motor skills to independently access 
medications. This observation raises 
the possibility that some cases in our 
study may have involved caregiver 
neglect, error, or malice. We have 
previously reported that 1 in 8 
children <2 years assessed by medical 
toxicology services in emergency 
departments in the United States 
had been exposed to illicit drugs or 
alcohol. 
11
Some limitations of our work should 
be noted. Chief among these is that 
our database allows linkage of 
children with their mothers based 
on birth records, but does not allow 
identification of father–child nor 
sibling–child pairs. Consequently, we 
do not have data on opioid prescription 
claims for fathers or siblings. Our 
analyses are limited to children 
of mothers whose prescriptions 
are insured under the provincial 
publicly funded drug plan. This is 
a subpopulation at socioeconomic 
disadvantage, with potential 
implications on illicit drug use, child 
care, and parental access to health 
care. Finally, we had no information 
regarding illicit opioid use in the home, 
an important potential source of 
pediatric exposure.
CONCLUSIONS
Children of mothers prescribed 
opioids are at a substantially 
increased risk of opioid toxicity. 
Prescription of antidepressants to 
the mother was also associated with 
an increased risk for pediatric opioid 
overdose. Prescribers, pharmacists, 
and parents should be cognizant of 
the potentially fatal risk these drugs 
pose to young children in the home 
and take measures to mitigate it, 
such as dispensing smaller opioid 
quantities, considering alternatives 
to opioids, and emphasizing the 
importance of secure storage and 
prompt disposal of unused opioids.
