Abstract
Purpose Fibroglandular tissue may mask breast cancers,
thereby reducing the sensitivity of mammography. Here,
we investigate methods for identification of women at high
risk of a masked tumor, who could benefit from additional
imaging.
Methods The last negative screening mammograms of 111
women with interval cancer (IC) within 12 months after
the examination and 1110 selected normal screening exams
from women without cancer were used. From the mam-
mograms, volumetric breast density maps were computed,
which provide the dense tissue thickness for each pixel
location. With these maps, three measurements were
derived: (1) percent dense volume (PDV), (2) percent area
where dense tissue thickness exceeds 1 cm (PDA), and (3)
dense tissue masking model (DTMM). Breast density was
scored by a breast radiologist using BI-RADS. Women
with heterogeneously and extremely dense breasts were
considered at high masking risk. For each masking mea-
sure, mammograms were divided into a high- and low-risk
category such that the same proportion of the controls is at
high masking risk as with BI-RADS.
Results Of the women with IC, 66.1, 71.9, 69.2, and 63.0%
were categorized to be at high masking risk with PDV,
PDA, DTMM, and BI-RADS, respectively, against 38.5%
of the controls. The proportion of IC at high masking risk is
statistically significantly different between BI-RADS and
PDA (p-value 0.022). Differences between BI-RADS and
PDV, or BI-RADS and DTMM, are not statistically
significant.
Conclusion Measures based on density maps, and in par-
ticular PDA, are promising tools to identify women at high
risk for a masked cancer.

Introduction
Thanks to screening programs, breast cancers are often
detected at an early stage. Nevertheless, not all breast
cancers in breast cancer screening participants are actually
detected by screening. Approximately 16–33% of the
breast cancer cases are the so-called interval cancers,
which means that they are diagnosed in between two
screening rounds [1, 2], even though the introduction of
digital mammography may have led to an increase
in sensitivity [3, 4]. In general, interval cancers are
detected at a later stage and have a worse prognosis [5–7].
Fibroglandular tissue may mask cancers, and therefore
sensitivity of mammography decreases with an increase in
breast density. It has been shown that there is a relationship
between breast density and screening program sensitivity
[8–13]. In addition, compared to women in the lowest
density category, women with dense breasts also have a
higher breast cancer risk [14–16], which amplifies the
negative effect of masking.

 To detect more cancers at an early stage, personalized
screening programs have been proposed [17, 18]. Adjusted
to the personal needs of individual women, screening could
be offered with different time intervals or with other
modalities than mammography, such as ultrasound or MRI.
Tomosynthesis might be an option as well, although the
effect is limited for extremely dense breasts [19]. In this
discussion, the reduced sensitivity of mammography due to
the masking effect of density plays an important role. In
recent years, many states in the United States passed breast
density notifications laws. Radiologists are obliged to
inform women about their breast density and the affiliated
risks. In some states, additional imaging is reimbursed for
women with dense breasts.
For the measurement of breast density, several methods
are available. In clinical practice, the 4-point ACR BI-
RADS scale is commonly used [20, 21]. To make this
estimate less subjective, algorithms have been developed to
estimate the breast density by computing the percentage
dense area projected on the mammogram or by computing
the percentage of fibroglandular tissue volume within the
breast. An overview of different algorithms is presented by
He [22].
Although breast density relates to masking, the relation
between the risk of masking and density is likely to be
more complex than a simple dependence on the amount of
fibroglandular tissue. Also, the distribution of dense tissue
may play a role. This is reflected in the new BI-RADS
definition that no longer considers the total amount of
fibroglandular tissue within the breast, but rather the
densest area [21]. How the risk of masking should be
quantified is an open question. The aim of this study is to
compare three different quantitative masking measure-
ments and the visual BI-RADS density assessment of a
radiologist, in their ability to predict the risk of an interval
cancer.
Materials and methods
Data
Digital mammograms from the Dutch breast cancer
screening program were analyzed. The mammograms were
acquired on Lorad Selenia systems (Hologic, Bedford,
USA). Women aged 50–75 years are invited biennially to
participate in the screening program. Details about the
screening program and the dataset can be found elsewhere
[23–25]. Written informed consent was not required for
this study. Women automatically consent to the use of their
anonymized data for scientific purposes by participating in
screening. Data of participants who objected to the use of
their data were removed.
The research archive used contains unprocessed mam-
mograms of one screening unit. In the period 2003–2012,
more than 130,000 exams of more than 55,000 women
were acquired. Mediolateral oblique (MLO) images were
always taken, while craniocaudal (CC) images were taken
in the first screening round and in 60% of subsequent
rounds. Through linkage with the Netherlands cancer reg-
istry and the screening organization, 1210 breast cancers
were identified, of which 836 were screen-detected can-
cers. The remaining 374 breast cancers were diagnosed
outside the screening program. Of these interval cancers,
275 were diagnosed within 24 months (screening interval),
of which 113 cancers within 12 months after the exami-
nation. The last available screening examination before
cancer diagnosis is used in this study. Women with breast
implants were excluded from the study as the density maps
cannot be correctly computed for mammograms with
implants.
In this study, a selection of the interval cancers, the
cancers that were diagnosed within 12 months after the
examination, is used (N = 111, two women were excluded
because of breast implants). The reason is that we want to
focus on false negative exams due to masking. Interval
cancers may also be due to other factors. In particular, fast
growing cancers may not be detectable at the time of
screening because they still are too small or not yet inva-
sive. We assume that by excluding interval cancers
detected more than 12 months after screening, a larger
proportion of the interval cancers are due to masking. This
idea is supported by Weber et al. [26] who found that a
larger proportion of the interval cancers found in the sec-
ond year after the screening examination show no signs of
abnormality in the screening mammogram compared to the
interval cancers found in the first year.
For each patient with an interval cancer, 10 participants
were chosen as controls. The control participants needed to
have had a mammographic examination in the same month
in which the last screening examination of the interval
cancer patient was performed. To be eligible as control, the
women should not have been recalled on the basis of this
mammographic examination and they should not have been
diagnosed with breast cancer within 2 years after this
examination. Women with breast implants were not eligi-
ble as control. Controls without a density map, due to
failure of the computation, were replaced.
Methods
Quantitative masking risk measures based on volumetric
breast density measurements were computed. For this

 purpose, a research version of the commercial software
Volpara (v1.5.0, Volpara Health Technologies, Wellington,
New Zealand) was used, which provides quantitative breast
density maps in addition to the percentage of dense tissue
volume. In these density maps, the pixel intensity is map-
ped to the fibroglandular tissue thickness at each pixel
location.
Three different automated measurements were investi-
gated to estimate masking risk: (1) percent dense volume
(PDV), defined as the fibroglandular tissue volume divided
by the breast volume; (2) percentage dense area (PDA),
computed as the percentage area on the density map where
the dense tissue thickness exceeded 1 cm; and (3) a dense
tissue masking model (DTMM) in which the size distri-
bution and cancer location probability are taken into
account. The idea behind the second method is that a
certain amount of fibroglandular tissue is necessary to hide
a cancer. With the threshold of 1 cm, the size of a region
where cancers may be masked is estimated and we assume
that the relative area of this region is related to masking
risk. A strength of this method is the simplicity. In the third
method, this idea is refined with the tissue masking model
which captures two aspects. First, instead of using a fixed
thickness threshold, it is modeled that larger cancers
require more dense tissue to be masked than smaller can-
cers. For this, the normalized distribution of breast cancer
size is taken into account. Second, the probability distri-
bution of cancer location is used to take into account that
dense tissue presence in regions where cancers more often
occur should give a stronger increase in masking risk than
dense tissue presence elsewhere. A detailed description is
in the section ‘‘Appendix’’.
The methods were applied to all available images in an
exam, i.e., MLO and CC views of both breasts. If CC views
were missing, their results for the different methods were
imputed. This was done for each method separately using
linear regression analysis in controls with both MLO and
CC views available. To come to a single score per exam,
results were averaged over the four views.
Next to the automated measurements, for the purpose of
this study, the breast density category of every exam was
assessed by a radiologist (10 years of experience in breast
imaging) according to the fifth edition of the BI-RADS
atlas [21]. Mammograms were evaluated without knowl-
edge of the cancer status.
To implement supplemental screening strategies in
clinical or screening practice, it is necessary to divide the
women into two groups: women at low masking risk and
women at high masking risk. In practice, a threshold needs
to be determined and all women with a measure above the
threshold would receive additional imaging. The best
threshold is unknown for the automated measures and
depends on the screening population and the proportion of
women that one is willing to offer supplemental screening
or the number of interval cancers that should be detected
with additional imaging.
To measure to what extent the methods can identify
women at high masking risk, the mammograms were
divided in a high and low masking risk group by thresh-
olding the risk measure. Then, the sensitivity of the
masking measures was computed as the number of interval
cancers in the high-risk group divided by the total number
of interval cancers. The false positive rate is calculated as
the percentage of normal controls selected as at high
masking risk at the same threshold. In the context of risk
stratification for supplemental screening, the proportion of
controls selected as at high masking risk can be seen as
supplemental screening rate and the proportion of interval
cancers gives an estimate about the cancers that might be
detectable with additional imaging at that supplemental
screening rate.
The automated masking measures were compared to the
radiologist scores when distinguishing BI-RADS density a
and b versus BI-RADS density c and d. Bootstrapping was
used to obtain 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and derive p-
values.
Since breast density is a risk factor for breast cancer
[14–16], it may be expected that the average breast
density of women with cancer is higher than that in
controls. Consequently, any predictive value of PDV for
the presence of interval cancers might be caused by PDV
being a risk factor, rather than being a ‘masking factor’.
To investigate the potential impact of this effect on our
results, an additional experiment was conducted in which
it was tested to what extent PDV can distinguish women
with any breast cancer from controls. Again, cases with
the highest PDV were selected by thresholding, and the
proportion of cancers as a function of the proportion of
controls selected was computed. For this experiment,
mammograms of the screen-detected breast cancers and
the interval cancers detected within 24 months were
used. Only the interval cancers detected later than
24 months after the last examination were not used, as
we assume that these cancers might well have been
detected when women would have attended another
screening round.
Results
The mean age of interval cancers and controls is 57.7 and
59.2 years, respectively. In 14.4% of the interval cancers,
the cancer was diagnosed after first participation in the
screening program, while 15.2% of the controls belong to
women who attended the screening program for the first
time. Only 3 interval cancers (2.7%) were diagnosed in

 women older than 70 years, while 110 women (11%) of the
control group were older than 70 years.
In Fig. 1, the percentage of interval cancers selected as
at high masking risk is plotted against the percentage of
controls selected when thresholding the different masking
measures. As mentioned earlier, the proportion of controls
selected as at high masking risk can be interpreted as the
supplemental screening rate when a masking measure
would be used in practice to identify women eligible for
supplemental screening. The percentage of interval cancer
selected as at high masking risk is a measure for the
potential benefit of supplemental screening, since it is the
proportion of women with interval cancers that would have
been included in the selection if supplemental screening
had been offered. The percentage of interval cancers
selected for several supplemental screening rates is given
in Table 1, while the supplemental screening rate required
to include a certain percentage of women with interval
cancer is presented in Table 2.
The density scores determined visually by the radiolo-
gist were used to differentiate non-dense breasts from
dense breasts, using the BI-RADS b–c transition as
threshold. With BI-RADS, 38.5% (CI 35.7–41.3) of the
controls were considered dense and thus at high masking
risk. Of the interval cancers, 63.0% (CI 53.5–72.0) were
classified as dense, using BI-RADS. If the thresholds of the
three masking measurement methods were set such that
there too the proportion of controls classified as at high
masking risk was 38.5%, then 66.1% (CI 55.8–76.2),
71.9% (CI 63.1–80.2), and 69.2% (60.0–77.9) of the
women with an interval cancer were considered at high
masking risk with PDV, PDA, and DTMM, respectively.
Significantly more women with interval cancers would be
included in the selection process with PDA compared to
BI-RADS (p-value 0.022). Differences in proportions
between BI-RADS and PDV, and BI-RADS and DTMM
were not statistically significant with p-values of 0.187 and
0.067, respectively.
The ability of PDV to distinguish breast cancers from
controls is displayed in Fig. 2. The cancers detected at a
screening examination (N = 836) and the interval cancers
that were diagnosed within the screening interval of
24 months
after
a
negative
screening
examination
(N = 275) were eligible for the analysis (N = 1111). The
PDV estimate was available for 1103 cancers. The curve
for predicting interval cancers shows a much higher area
under the curve than the curve predicting all breast cancers.
These results show that PDV is not ‘just’ a predictor for
breast cancer risk, but in particular a good predictor for the
risk of developing an interval cancer (as a proxy for risk of
masking).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the ability of several mea-
surements of masking risk to distinguish false negative
screening mammograms from true negative screening
mammograms. The aim of our work is to find a method that
is suited to identify women who are at high risk to be
diagnosed with an interval cancer after a negative screen-
ing exam. In a personalized screening workflow, such a
method could be applied to all negative screening mam-
mograms to select the subgroup of women who would
benefit most from additional imaging with MRI or
ultrasound.
There are various reasons why interval cancers are not
detected by screening, and masking is only one of them.
Some cancers may be not detected by screening because
they grow fast and the screening interval is too long. As we
focus in this study on masking, we included in our exper-
iment only those interval cancers that were diagnosed
within 12 months after the negative mammogram, to
exclude true interval cancers, the cancers that show no
signs of abnormality on the mammogram. True interval
cancers are more common in the second year after the
examination than in the first year [26]. Given that the exact
cancer location was unknown and that the diagnostic
mammograms were not available, it was not possible to
review the interval cancers and to confirm that masking is
the cause for a cancer diagnosis outside the screening
program. It is noted that by excluding the interval cancers
after 12 months, our study results are also more represen-
tative for screening programs with a 1-year interval.

were separated into high- and low-risk groups. The percentages of

other as function of the threshold

 In current clinical practice, the BI-RADS density
assessment categories are used to decide whom to offer
supplemental screening. Using a separation into a low-risk
group (BI-RADS density a and b) and high-risk group
(BI-RADS density c and d) with a 38.5% supplemental
screening rate, it was found that between 63.0 and 71.9% of
the women diagnosed with an interval cancer in the study
data within 12 months of a negative screening would be
included in the high-risk group for additional imaging.
Automated measures have a higher sensitivity than the
radiologist, and this difference was statistically significant
for the new proposed measurements PDA at the chosen
supplemental screening rate.
We compared the ability of PDV to distinguish cancers
(screen-detected and interval) from controls to make sure
that we capture more than the breast cancer risk in relation to
breast density. Thereby, we confirmed that cancers are more
common in dense breasts than in non-dense breasts. Never-
theless, we can conclude that the differences in PDV distri-
butions of interval cancers and controls are not only caused
by the increased breast cancer risk that is associated with an
increased breast density, and that PDV is capturing masking.
Cancers and controls were only matched for the month
of acquisition and not for age and participation in the breast
cancer screening program. The mean age of the controls
was higher than the mean of the cases. Given that breast

separate cases and controls into a high- and a low-risk group. By
adjusting the threshold on a masking measure, the percentage of
controls (also interpretable as supplemental screening rate) is
adjusted. The percentage of interval cancers that would be included
in the selection at several supplemental screening rates is given in this
table. Using BI-RADS breast density c and d as high-risk categories,
38.5% of the controls are considered at increased masking risk and
63.0% of the women with interval cancer would be included in the
selection. In total, 111 cancers and 1110 controls were used

 density decreases with age [27], one could argue that the
difference in density distribution between cases and con-
trols is caused by differences in age. However, the control
group contained more women who participated in the
screening program for the first time than the cases, leading
to an effect in the opposite direction. While only three
interval cancers (2.7%) were found in women between 71
and 75 years of age, 11% of the controls belong to this age
group causing the higher mean age in controls. If we had
matched for age at the time of acquisition, women above
70 years would have been underrepresented in the controls,
and the controls would have been not representative for the
screening population.
Mainprize et al. [28] have been working on the quan-
tification of masking as well. In their model, a detectability
map is created for each pixel location by simulating lesions
and by using local estimates of the noise power spectrum
and volumetric breast density. They validated the masking
measurement with an observer study on regions of interest
of 150 cancer free CC mammograms. High correlations
were found between the mean value of the detectability
maps and the computerized and human observer study.
However, Mainprize only used cancer free mammograms
in his study and simulations in regions of interests. Hence,
it remains an open question to which extent the mean value
of the detectability map differs between false and true
negative screening mammograms and whether it can be
used as a predictive masking score.
A limitation of our study is the fact that CC images were
not available for all exams. Until recently, MLO was the
standard view in the screening program where we acquired
our data, while CC images were obtained by indication.
Therefore, to avoid bias when averaging over views, we
imputed data for missing CC views based on the available
MLO view and statistical analysis of differences between
MLO and CC views. Furthermore, cases and controls were
matched to the month of acquisition to guarantee the same
guidelines and circumstance in image acquisition with
regard to taking the CC views. Another limitation is that BI-
RADS density assessments of only one radiologist were
available. Many studies found inter- and intra-reader vari-
ability in breast density assessment using BI-RADS [29–32].
Therefore, to make a definitive comparison between the
automated methods and radiologists assessments, an exten-
sive reader study should be conducted with multiple readers.
In conclusion, results suggest that the new proposed
masking risk measurements may have a better performance
than visual BI-RADS assessment in distinguishing false
negative screening
mammograms from true negative
screening mammograms. Therefore, these measurements
may be considered as predictive masking measure when
implementing supplemental screening for women at a high
risk for interval cancers.

 Appendix
The dense tissue masking model (DTMM) captures two
aspects: (1) the larger the lesion, the lower the masking
risk; and (2) the larger the dense tissue thickness at a
location, the higher the masking risk. Therefore, the
masking risk for a lesion with diameter dt at a location with
density d is defined as
masking dt; d
ð
Þ ¼ d � dt
d
if
d � dt:
From this, the masking risk for each pixel location (x,y) is
estimated by summing over all possible tumor diameters
considering the normalized cancer size distribution s(dt).
The size distribution was obtained for invasive mas-
ses. In the mammograms, a contour was drawn around
the mass and the effective diameter was determined
(diameter = 2 (area/p)1/2). The distribution was nor-
malized to a value of one. With the use of the size dis-
tribution, we take into account that lesions with the size
of few millimeters are in general not detectable and that
extremely large cancers are not common in screening.
The masking risk at a location(x,y) with density d(x,y) is
then
masking x; y

Furthermore, the cancer location probability distribution
(CLPD) is taken into account. With the use of the CLPD, it is
acknowledged that lesions are more common in the center of
the breast and less common close to the periphery. The CLPD
was as well obtained with the invasive mass-like lesions as
described in [33]. The probability of masking is then
masking ðx; yÞ ¼ CLPD (x; yÞ �

With the formula above, the masking risk is determined
for each pixel location (x,y). To come to a single score for
each image, the masking risk is averaged over all pixels
within the breast. Different CLPDs and size distributions
were used for the MLO and CC images.
