BACKGROUND: Although small elevations of high-sensitive cardiac 
troponin T (hs-cTnT) are associated with incident heart failure (HF) in the 
general population, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. 
Evaluating the association of hs-cTnT with replacement fibrosis and 
progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to 
understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF prevention strategy.
METHODS: We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in 
MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was 
performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac magnetic resonance was performed 
10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD 
events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic 
resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium 
enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year 
change in left ventricular structure and function. Associations of hs-cTnT 
with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were 
estimated using Cox regression models.
RESULTS: Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was 
detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up 
cardiac magnetic resonance. A graded association was observed between 
higher baseline hs-cTnT categories and late gadolinium enhancement 
(≥7.42 ng/L versus <limit of detection [<3 ng/L]; adjusted odds ratio, 
2.87; 95% confidence interval,  1.38‒5.94). Higher hs-cTnT was also 
associated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% 
(highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.09‒2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular 
ejection fraction. The risk of incident HF was greater for higher hs-cTnT 
(≥8.81 ng/L versus <limit of detection; adjusted hazards ratio, 5.59; 95% 
CI, 2.97–10.68).
CONCLUSIONS: hs-cTnT levels are associated with replacement fibrosis 
and progressive changes in left ventricular structure in CVD-free adults, 
findings that may precede HF symptoms by years. Minor elevations of 
hs-cTnT may represent a biochemical signature of early subclinical cardiac 
disease, providing an opportunity for targeted preventive interventions.

ardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world, 
and its impact on developing countries has made it 
a global epidemic.1,2 With an aging population, incident 
heart failure (HF) has become an increasingly common 
initial presentation of CVD.3 Once diagnosed, a rapid 
decline in quality of life occurs, as well as an increase 
in medical expenses and mortality.4,5 Unlike the primary 
prevention of atherosclerotic disease, HF prevention has 
been more challenging beyond basic management of 
traditional risk factors, with heterogeneous progression 
of pathophysiology in asymptomatic individuals.
The concept of preclinical HF stages was introduced 
as a strategy to identify individuals at risk for future HF, 
in whom closer monitoring and attention to prevention 
are warranted.6 The presence of stage B preclinical HF 
findings, which includes electrocardiographic and imag-
ing measures of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and 
dysfunction, predicts progression to HF and death.7,8 We 
and others have shown that high-sensitive cardiac tro-
ponins I and T (hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT), biomarkers that can 
detect small amounts of myocyte injury, are associated 
with structural cardiac abnormalities that define a stage 
B HF phenotype, most notably LVH.9–12 Moreover, small 
elevations in hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI predict progression to 
incident HF and CV death among asymptomatic individu-
als in the general population.9–13 However, the extent to 
which hs-cTn levels identify individuals at risk for pro-
gression of structural cardiac abnormalities is unknown. 
Moreover, it is not known whether low levels of hs-cTn 
represent an early biochemical signature of myocyte cell 
loss with replacement fibrosis, indicative of an ongoing 
dynamic process resulting in subsequent pathophysio-
logic changes in cardiac structure and function. Such in-
sight could provide targeting of preventive therapy years 
before detection of structural heart disease (ie, in ad-
vance of imaging-based stage B preclinical HF) and de-
velopment of symptoms by allowing early differentiation 
of individuals with similar traditional risk factor profiles 
who are at highest risk for CVD progression and death.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine 
whether hs-cTnT identifies an early phenotype for sub-
clinical cardiac disease as assessed by serial cardiac 
magnetic resonance (CMR), and CVD outcomes in a pro-
spective, ethnically diverse general population cohort 
free from CVD at baseline.
METHODS
Study Population
Details of the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) 
design have been previously described.14 In short, 6814 men 
and women, 45 to 84 years of age and of 4 self-reported race/
ethnicities (non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese) who 
were free of known CVD (including a history of HF) were enrolled 
in 6 participating centers in the United States. On entry, all partici-
pants underwent extensive evaluations, including questionnaires, 
physical examination, and laboratory tests. For these analyses, 
we included individuals who had a complete CMR evaluation done 
at examination 1; for further analyses of changes in subclinical 
CVD, we included those participants with complete CMR at exam-
inations 1 (2000–2002) and 5 (2010–2012) and who remained 
free of interim clinically overt CVD, as described below. All par-
ticipants provided informed consent for participation. MESA was 
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of 
Washington and the participating sites; the measurement of hs-
cTnT and this analysis were approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of the University of Maryland, Baltimore.
Biomarker Assay Measurements
hs-cTnT was measured in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
plasma collected at baseline (examination 1). Sequential bio-
marker measures of amino-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP) were also performed on blood samples collected 
at examinations 1 and 3 (2003–2005). NT-proBNP had already 
been measured in 5597 participants at baseline (examination 
1)15 and 4996 participants at examination 3 but was measured 
in all additional participants at both time points with available 
plasma who were without a previous measure. All hs-cTnT at 
examination 1, plus additional NT-proBNP levels at examinations 
1 and 3, were measured at the University of Maryland using 
the Cobas e601 (Roche Diagnostics). A 250 μl ethylenediami-
netetraacetic acid plasma sample previously unthawed or only 
thawed once was used for analysis. For hs-cTnT, the interassay 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This is the first study demonstrating, in a contempo-
rary multi-ethnic population free of known cardiovas-
cular disease, that a mild elevation of high sensitive 
cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) identifies subjects at 
highest risk for an increase in left ventricular mass 
and end-diastolic volume over the next 10-years.
• Higher hs-cTnT levels also associate with an 
increased incidence of replacement fibrosis, but 
with no differentiation between ischemic or nonisch-
emic fibrosis patterns.
• hs-cTnT level remains an independent predictor for 
incident heart failure, coronary heart disease events 
and cardiovascular events, independent of underly-
ing LVH or ejection fraction.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Subtle biochemical evidence of myocyte injury pre-
cedes imaging evidence of increasing LV mass and 
dilation, replacement fibrosis, and clinical cardiovas-
cular events.
• Myocyte injury, measured with a high sensitive car-
diac specific troponin assay, may ultimately be an 
important early signal used to target therapy to 
prevent or delay left ventricular remodeling and pro-
gression to heart failure symptoms and death.

coefficients of variation (CVs) observed for the MESA cohort 
measurements were 3.6% at 28 ng/L and 2.0% at 2154 ng/L. 
The Cobas e601 instrument used in this study is superior for low-
end measurement of hs-cTnT because of an additional wash step 
that improves the assay’s signal-to-noise ratio compared with the 
Cobas e411. This instrument translates into better performance; 
by comparison, the 10% CV is 4.3 ng/L for e601 compared with 
8 ng/L for e411, and the LoQ (20% CV) is 5.6 ng/L for e411 
and 2.5 ng/L on the e601 (A. Sanger, personal communication, 
June 6, 2015). Thus, measurements at the 3 ng/L, defined as 
the limit of detection (LOD) as the lowest reported value from the 
instrument, were well within the reportable range for the hs-cTnT 
used in this study. Details for NT-proBNP have previously been 
reported.15 In total, 4986 (99.7%) of participants with CMR com-
pleted at examination 1 had hs-cTnT measured at examination 1, 
and 4991 (99.8%) had NT-proBNP measured.
CMR Imaging and Image Analysis
CMR imaging at examinations 1 and 5 were performed as pre-
viously described.16 To account for the different pulse magnetic 
resonance imaging sequences and subsequent variances in 
measurements, correction equations were used to convert fast 
gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequence 
measurements (examination 1) into steady-state free precession 
measurements (examination 5) for longitudinal measurement 
analyses.17 Contrast enhanced CMR studies using late gado-
linium enhancement (LGE) were performed during examination 
5 only among those without contraindications for gadolinium. 
LGE images were acquired 10 to 15 minutes after intravenous 
administration of 0.15 mmol/kg gadolinium-diethylenetriamine 
pentaacetate (Magnevist, Schering) with breath-held segmented 
inversion-recovery sequence and acquired in the same orienta-
tions as the cine images. Inversion times were adjusted to null 
normal myocardium. Myocardial scar (replacement fibrosis) was 
defined as focal LGE in either 2 adjacent short-axis slices or 1 
short-axis and a long-axis image at a corresponding location using 
QMass (version 7.2, Medis). Myocardial scars that involved sub-
endocardium in a coronary artery distribution were defined as a 
“typical” scar. Myocardial scars predominantly affecting midwall 
or subepicardium without subendocardial involvement in a non-
coronary artery distribution were defined as an “atypical” scar.18
Clinical Follow-Up and Cohort Surveillance
MESA clinical event end points considered in this analysis 
included HF hospitalization; acute myocardial infarction and 
other forms of incident coronary heart disease (CHD); and 
CV mortality. Events were adjudicated by the MESA group as 
previously described.15,19 Incident HF and CHD events were 
ascertained by participant interview at semiannual study visits. 
Incident HF for this analysis comprised events adjudicated as 
probable or definite. CV death was defined as death related to 
atherosclerotic heart disease (fatal myocardial infarction and 
definite and possible fatal CHD), death after cerebrovascular 
disease (fatal stroke), or death from other atherosclerotic and 
cardiovascular diseases, as described in detail previously.14
Candidate Covariates
Clinical characteristics and CV risk factors were obtained 
as described previously.14 The candidate covariates for this 
analysis include: age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status (current/
former/never), hypertension medication use, systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressure, weight, height, diabetes mellitus, lipid 
levels, and renal function at examination 1. Hypertension was 
defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm 
Hg, diastolic 
blood pressure ≥90 mm 
Hg, or treatment for hypertension. 
Individuals with diabetes mellitus were defined as either hav-
ing fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL or receiving treat-
ment for diabetes mellitus. Estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) was calculated from serum creatinine using the CKD-Epi 
equation.20
Statistical Analysis
We examined hs-cTnT as a predictor variable using 2 comple-
mentary methods: First, we predefined 5 categories of hs-
cTnT concentration. The lowest category consisted of those 
participants with concentrations below the LOD (ie, <3 ng/L: 
category 1), and the remaining distribution of measurable hs-
cTnT were divided into 4 categories of equal numbers of par-
ticipants (categories 2–5). Second, we modeled hs-cTnT as 
a continuous log-linear form after taking the natural log of hs-
cTnT values; values <LOD were imputed at 1.5 ng/L (ie, 50% 
of the lowest detectable value).
Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteris-
tics were compared across the 5 categories of hs-cTnT using 
analysis of variance or Cuzik’s test for trend as appropriate.21 
The relationship between hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP and aging 
was examined by robust locally weighted regression of each 
biomarker versus age and displayed graphically separately 
among men and women.22 To identify factors independently 
associated with greater hs-cTnT, we performed multiple logis-
tic regression with the highest category of hs-cTnT as the 
dependent variable and the baseline patient characteristics as 
independent variables.
We used multiple linear regression to examine cross-
sectional relations of hs-cTnT categories with continuous 
measures of subclinical CVD: LV mass (LVM), LV end-diastolic 
volume (LVEDV), and LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Because asso-
ciations with continuous measures of cardiac structure and 
function may fail to adequately describe relationships with sub-
clinical cardiac disease, we additionally examined associations 
of hs-cTnT with abnormal LVM and LVEF with logistic regres-
sion using previously established cut points to define LVH23 and 
abnormal LVEF (<50%). For all regression models, adjustment 
was made for demographic factors (age, gender, and race/
ethnicity), traditional CVD risk factors (systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medications, diabetes 
mellitus, smoking), height and weight, and eGFR.
The association between baseline hs-cTnT and change 
in each CMR measure was examined through multiple linear 
regression models, with the follow-up CMR measure (LVM, 
LVEDV, and LVEF) as dependent variables, hs-cTnT as the pri-
mary independent variable, and adjustment variables, including 
the initial CMR measure, demographics, traditional CVD risk 
factors, and eGFR as defined previously. Robust estimates of 
standard errors were used to provide nonbiased estimates 
in the setting of heteroscedasticity. For these analyses, 
only those subjects with both initial and follow-up CMR mea-
sures, and without incident CHD and HF between these visits, 
were included; separate categorization of hs-cTnT levels as

described earlier was performed among this study sample. 
Each type of follow-up CMR measure was initially considered 
as a continuous outcome. Because continuous measures of 
change may fail to fully characterize the relation of hs-cTnT 
with changes in subclinical CVD, we also defined a priori cut 
points, indicating “clinically significant” longitudinal changes for 
each CMR measure defined as a binary outcome (progression 
versus no progression). Cut points defining significant progres-
sion included: (1) for LVEF, >10% relative decrease; (2) for LVM, 
>12% increase; and (3) for LVEDV, >8% increase. These cut 
points define a change more than twice the technical error of 
the mean (analogous to the coefficient of variation) for interob-
server variability for each measure using previously reported 
data.16 Change in each measure greater than these thresh-
olds can be considered as highly unlikely to represent merely 
measurement error. Furthermore, we examined changes in 
subclinical CVD as characterized by longitudinal increases in 
NT-proBNP as defined previously by a >25% increase to a 
level ≥80 ng/L.24 Associations between baseline hs-cTnT and 
these “significant” changes in CMR measures and NT-proBNP 
were examined using logistic regression, adjusting for baseline 
NT-proBNP and additional covariates as described previously.
The frequency and subtype (ischemic versus nonischemic) 
of the LGE pattern on follow-up MRI were compared across 
categories of baseline hs-cTnT with the χ-squared test. The 
adjusted association between hs-cTnT and LGE were exam-
ined using logistic regression, adjusting for the demographic 
and CVD risk factors described earlier, and in addition for 
LV mass and LV ejection fraction. These analyses were per-
formed among those with complete contrast-enhanced CMR 
at visit 5 who remained free of HF and CVD events, with 
categories of hs-cTnT defined among this study sample as 
described earlier.
The incidence of HF, CHD, and CV mortality were compared 
across hs-cTnT categories using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
the log-rank test, with follow-up time defined as time from the 
baseline study visit with censoring on death (or, for the out-
come of CV mortality, death from non-CV causes) or the date 
of the last study visit. Adjusted associations were estimated 
using Cox survival regression models. Adjustment covariates 
included the demographic and CVD risk factors described 
earlier. The study sample for these analyses included those 
with complete CMR measures and hs-cTnT measures at exami-
nation 1. Tests of Schoenfeld residuals and -ln(-ln) plots were 
used to verify the proportional hazards assumption. All analy-
ses were performed with Sata SE v12.1 (Statacorp).
RESULTS
Study Population
Among 4986 participants with complete CMR and hs-
cTnT at examination 1, an hs-cTnT level above the LOD 
was present in 3341(67%) of participants. Increasing lev-
els of hs-cTnT were associated with older age, male sex, 
white race, diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, greater 
body mass index, higher NT-proBNP, lower proportion of 
good-excellent self-reported health, and a history of hy-
pertension and smoking (Table 1). Factors independently 
associated with elevated hs-cTnT (≥8.81 ng/L, highest 
category) were older age, male sex, black ethnicity, 
diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting glucose, greater 
body mass index, lower eGFR, higher NT-proBNP, and 
use of diuretics (online-only Data Supplement Table I).
To better understand the influence of age on hs-cTnT, 
we plotted lowess estimated medians by age separately 
by sex and contrasted this value with NT-proBNP, the 
other cardiac specific biomarker measured in the cohort 
(Figure 1a and 1b for men and women, respectively). 
In men, a predominantly linear rise in hs-cTnT occurs 
with advancing age, with an ≈4-fold increase from the 
late 40s to the mid-80s, in contrast to NT-proBNP, which 
changes minimally until the mid-60s, with a sharp inflec-
tion and steep rise over the next 20 years of life. For 
women, the pattern is different. hs-cTnT levels are lower 
than in men and gradually increase with a rate of rise 
that then continues to increase over 40 years.
Last, we compared participants who did not have a 
CMR examination to those who did. Participants without 
CMR were older and had a greater prevalence of tradi-
tional risk factors, poorer self-reported healt,h and mod-
estly higher hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP values (online-only 
Data Supplement Table II).
hs-cTnT and CMR Determined Left Ventricular 
Structure and Function
Cross-Sectional Associations of hs-cTnT With Subclinical 
CVD
Progressively higher hs-cTnT concentrations were asso-
ciated with greater LV mass and a higher prevalence of 
LVH for both men and women (Table 2). These trends 
remained significant after adjustment for demographics, 
traditional CVD risk factors, and renal function, with a 
>5-fold greater odds of LVH among those in the highest 
category of hs-cTnT (odds ratio, 5.23; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 3.67‒7.46; online-only Data Supplement Ta-
ble III). Baseline LVEDV did not differ for either sex across 
categories of hs-cTnT. Mean LVEF was minimally but sig-
nificantly lower across higher hs-cTnT for men but not for 
women; however, the prevalence of an abnormal LVEF 
(<50%) was notably higher across progressively higher 
hs-cTnT categories for both sexes (Table 2). After adjust-
ment for demographics, CV risk factors, and eGFR, those 
in the highest category of hs-cTnT were markedly more 
likely to have low LVEF compared with those with hs-cTnT 
below the LOD (odds ratio, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.68‒5.24), 
with a linear relation of ln(hs-cnT) and abnormal LVEF 
(online-only Data Supplement Table IV).

There were 2831 participants with CMR exams at exami-

LVM from baseline to follow-up CMR, 387 (13.7%) with 
a >8% increase in EDV, and 570 (20.1%) with a relative 
decline in EF >10%. The proportion with increased LVM 
was greater among those with higher baseline hs-cTnT 
(Table 3). After adjustment for baseline LVM, demograph-
ics, and traditional CVD risk factors, those in the high-
est hs-cTnT category were more likely to have a >12% 
increase in LV mass compared with participants with un-
detectable levels (odds ratio, 1.50, 95% CI, 1.09‒2.07; 
Table 3). The proportion of participants with an LVEDV 
increase of >8% was also greater with higher categories 
of hs-cTnT levels after adjustment for baseline LVEDV

and CVD risk factors (P=0.006 for trend across hs-cTnT 
categories; Table 3). In contrast, for a decline in LVEF 
>8%, no significant association was found with higher 
baseline hs-cTnT categories after covariate adjustment 
(Table 3). When examined as continuous measures of 
longitudinal LV changes (defined as follow-up measures 
adjusted for baseline), modest although significant ad-
justed associations of greater hs-cTnT occurred with 
greater follow-up LVM and LVEDV, but associations with 
lower LVEF were not significant after adjustment for CV 
risk factors (online-only Data Supplement Table V). Last, 
among 4290 participants with baseline and follow-up (ex-
amination 3) NT-proBNP levels and who remained free of 
CHD and HF, the incidence of an increase in NT-proBNP 
>25% to >80 pg/ml ranged from 18% for participants 
with hs-cTnT levels below the LOD to 37% for those 
with hs-cTnT levels in the 5th category (online-only Data 
Supplement Figure I). These associations remained sig-
nificant after adjustment for baseline NT-proBNP and CV 
risk factors (online-only Data Supplement Table VI).
Association Between hs-cTnT and LGE
LGE was identified in 113 (6.5%) of 1723 participants 
with gadolinium-enhanced CMR at examination 5 who 
were also without an interim CVD event before the exami-
nation. LGE pattern distribution were classified as typical 
and likely caused by ischemia in 38 (33.6%) of these 
participants, whereas 75 (66.4%) participants were clas-
sified as atypical scar and likely not caused by coronary 
artery disease. The prevalence of participants with LGE 
is shown for the entire cohort in Figure 2 and by sex 
across progressive baseline hs-cTnT categories for men 
and women in online-only Data Supplement Figure IIa IIb, 
respectively. Overall, the proportion with LGE is as low 
as 1% for women with hs-cTnT below the LOD to 17% 
for men with hs-cTnT levels in the highest category. The 
majority of LGE scar types was classified as atypical in 
all hs-cTnT categories and did not differ across such cat-
egories. The odds of LGE scar among participants in the 
highest category of hs-cTnT were ≈2.5 times as great 
as those with undetectable hs-cTnT after adjustment for 
demographics, CVD risk factors, eGFR, LVH, and LVEF 
(odds ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.15–5.06), respectively 
 
(Table 4). A significant linear relationship between hs-
cTnT level and odds of LGE scar was also apparent 
(Table 4).
Association Between hs-cTnT and Incident HF, CHD Events, 
and CV Death
Participants with baseline CMR and hs-cTnT measure-
ments were followed for a median of 12.2 years with 
177 definite or probable incident HF events, 234 CHD 
events, and 141 CV deaths. Cumulative hazard curves 
are shown for incident HF, CHD, and CV death in Figure 3 
 
and online-only Data Supplement Figures III and IV, re-
spectively. For each event type, progressively higher 
levels of hs-cTnT were associated with a greater risk of 
each event. For incident HF, the unadjusted hazard ratio 
for those in the highest category of hs-cTnT versus those 
<LOD was 14.13 (95% CI, 8.18–24.42); risk-factor ad-
justment diminished these associations moderately, but 
they remained significant even after additional adjust-
ment for LVM, LVEF, and NT-proBNP (Table 5). Associa-
tions were similar after excluding patients with LVH or 
abnormal LVEF at baseline (per 1-ln increase in hs-cTnT; 
adjusted hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.52–2.76). Similar 
associations were present for CHD events, although with 
weaker associations compared with incident HF and CV 
death (online-only Data Supplement Table VII).
DISCUSSION
Our results from the MESA cohort, incorporating a high-
sensitivity assay for cTnT and using repeated CMR with 
LGE, provide several novel insights regarding the mecha-
nisms of chronic cardiac injury in the general population. 
First, baseline levels of hs-cTnT are strongly associated

values of either NT-proBNP (blue) or hs-cTnT (maroon) as a

say. Levels below detection were imputed at 2.99 ng/L.

with longitudinal changes in LV structure consistent with 
early adverse remodeling, represented by a measurable 
increase in LV mass and end-diastolic volume by CMR, 
as well as increased hemodynamic strain represented 
by a rise in NT-proBNP. This latter finding is also sup-
ported by the observation that cTnT is initially elevated 
at a younger age compared with NT-proBNP, particularly 
in men. Progressive remodeling of LV structure associ-
ated with higher hs-cTnT levels occurred in the absence 
of intervening cardiovascular events and independent of 
initial LV mass, LVEDV, and NT-proBNP. Second, unique 
to this study is the strong association of biochemical 
evidence of myocyte injury with subsequent imaging 
evidence of replacement fibrosis in the form of CMR 
LGE. LGE has consistently been associated with a poor 
outcome in multiple cardiovascular diseases as well as 
people with diabetes mellitus and older adult general 
populations.25–27 Consistent with a probable nonischemic 
etiology to account for measurable hs-cTnT, no trend 
was discovered in the pattern of ischemic-type LGE 
with higher levels of hs-cTnT. Despite these consistent 
associations of greater baseline hs-cTnT with replace-
ment fibrosis, measurable progression of LV mass and 
LVEDV by CMR, and early rise in NT-proBNP, we noted no

relationship with longitudinal decline of systolic function 
as reflected by LVEF. This lack of association is all the 
more remarkable in that a decreased LVEF is the 1 struc-
tural indication for treatment of asymptomatic patients 
to prevent HF, although it represents an insensitive and 
late manifestation in the progression of subclinical dis-
ease.8,28 Our results support the hypothesis that, at least 
in the 10 years of follow-up in these MESA participants 
free of symptomatic cardiac disease, biochemical evi-
dence of subclinical myocardial injury is a better marker 
for increasing LV mass and LV dilatation than for declin-
ing systolic function. Alternatively, those with long-term 
decline in LVEF may have been more likely to progress to 
symptomatic heart failure and thus were excluded from 
our analysis of subclinical changes in LV function.
Our findings also confirm cross-sectional structural ab-
normalities on baseline CMR, including increased LV mass 
and an abnormal LVEF with higher levels of hs-cTnT.11,12 
However, in light of the novel findings here that hs-cTnT 
levels associate with progression of structural abnormali-
ties independent of the initial examination 1 CMR find-
ings, cross-sectional imaging abnormalities could now 
be interpreted as relatively late preclinical findings in 
the course of cardiovascular disease. Finally, we found 
strong associations of even minor elevations of hs-cTnT 
with an independent risk for incident HF, CHD events, and 
cardiovascular death, for the first time demonstrating 
that these associations persist after accounting for CMR 
measurements of LV structure and function. Accounting 
for these measures in a multivariate model for outcomes 
supports the hypothesis that hs-cTnT levels provide a 
unique biochemical signature that is independent of even 
the most precise measures of cardiac structure.
LGE measured by CMR can be indicative of a pre-
vious myocardial infarction but is also present in many 
nonischemic heart diseases.29 LGE has been reported in

nearly two thirds of patients with severe aortic stenosis 
and half of patients with hypertension with left ventricular 
hypertrophy.30 LGE is typically associated with myocyte 
cell loss and replacement fibrosis.29 Its presence is also 
associated with a poor prognosis.25 In older Icelandic 
community-dwelling adults, an LGE pattern most consis-
tent with a myocardial infarction was found in 17% who 
had no previous history of a myocardial infarction and 
was associated with a worse prognosis compared with 
those without LGE.27 More recently, in the MESA cohort, 
unrecognized scar was reported in 6.2% of participants 
of whom 62% were classified as atypical for myocar-
dial infarction.18 The prevalence of scar in the current 
study was slightly different from the previous publica-
tion as individuals with an incident HF event before ex-
amination 5 were excluded in the present analysis. The 
lower prevalence of LGE, and particularly typical scar 
compared with previous non-MESA general population 
studies, is likely based on the initial exclusion in MESA of 
known CVD, the race/ethnic heterogeneity of the cohort 
(with whites having the highest prevalence of LGE), and 
younger age of MESA participants. A previous study of 
older adults did not find an association between troponin 
and LGE, but this study focused only on subendocardial 
ischemic LGE patterns and did not utilize a high-sensitive 
troponin assay.31 Studies measuring hs-cTn in symptom-
atic nonischemic heart disease populations, including 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyop-
athy, and severe aortic stenosis, all identified significant 
associations between the hs-cTn levels and the pres-
ence of LGE, most of which was atypical in location.32–34 
We expand these findings by showing that hs-cTnT may 
represent a biomarker surrogate for early myocardial fi-
brosis in an asymptomatic lower risk general population 
free of known cardiovascular disease.
By showing that hs-cTnT levels identify individuals at 
highest risk for adverse remodeling with changes still 
within the normal measurement range as well as pro-
gression to symptomatic disease and death, we identify 
that hs-cTnT levels represent a biochemical signature of 
subclinical cardiac disease that could be potentially used 
to target preventive interventions to at-risk individuals. 
Greater habitual physical activity has been associated 
with attenuation in the rise in hs-cTnT levels over follow-
up, suggesting a potential preventive intervention.35 Fur-
thermore, given the strong association of hs-cTnT with 
imaging evidence of fibrosis and the findings by others 
that hs-cTnI is also strongly associated with LGE in se-
vere aortic stenosis,34 trials with therapies targeting re-
modeling and fibrosis could also be considered as an 
early intervention to prevent progression to symptomatic 
HF based on hs-cTnT levels.

LIMITATIONS
Several limitations of this study are to be considered. 
Follow-up CMR was not available in ≈40% of partici-
pants. In general, participants who did not complete 
CMR measures were older and less healthy than those 
who had a complete CMR. Although the CMR technol-
ogy was contemporaneous for its time during each 
MESA examination period, the sequences were differ-
ent as technology improved and became faster and 
more efficient. These differences required a correction 
factor to compare changes in measurements for longi-
tudinal analyses and thereby would potentially result in 
small errors (addressed previously in earlier MESA CMR 
analyses).17 No consensus was found on the degree 
of change in CMR-based measures of LV structure and 
function which identifies clinically important progression. 
We selected thresholds of change that were unlikely to 
represent measurement error only, but other thresholds 
may be more useful clinically. Only CMRs performed at 
examination 5 used contrast enhancement to assess fi-
brosis, with only 1839 (61%) receiving gadolinium. LGE 
sequences, although excellent at detecting small scar/
fibrosis, may miss scar <1 g. In addition, because of the 
way LGE sequences are acquired and evaluated (scar is 
detected when compared with normal myocardium), it 
may miss diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Measures of LGE-
defined replacement fibrosis were not contemporane-
ous with measures of cTnT. Last, nearly a third of the 
MESA cohort with CMR had an hs-cTnT level below the 
LOD. The assay system used is technically superior and 
provided hs-cTnT measurements that were ≈2-fold more 
sensitive and precise than earlier versions of the hs-cTnT 
analyzer. Such a technical advantage translates into less 
misclassification of subjects with regard to hs-cTnT, but 
we were still unable to classify all subjects in this study 
with a measurable hs-cTnT level. Nevertheless, as a 
group, those with hs-cTnT less than the LOD remained at 
low risk for HF, CVD events, or CV death.
CONCLUSIONS
Among adults without clinically overt CVD, higher hs-
cTnT levels associate with myocardial pathology iden-
tified by CMR and pathological cardiac remodeling. 
Moreover, hs-cTnT identifies individuals with imaging 
evidence of nonischemic replacement fibrosis. The as-
sociation of measurable hs-cTnT with subsequent LV re-
modeling and progression to symptomatic HF and car-
diovascular death suggests that hs-cTnT levels could 
biochemically define early subclinical cardiac disease. 
Moving forward, clinical studies of lifestyle changes or 
pharmacological therapy may consider using hs-cTnT 
levels in middle-age and older adults to identify those 
most likely to benefit from specific therapy to prevent 
remodeling and fibrosis.
