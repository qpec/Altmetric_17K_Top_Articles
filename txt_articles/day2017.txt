IMPORTANCE Exposure to ozone has been associated with cardiovascular mortality, but the
underlying biological mechanisms are not yet understood.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between ozone exposure and cardiopulmonary
pathophysiologic mechanisms.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A longitudinal study involving 89 healthy adult
participants living on a work campus in Changsha City, China, was conducted from
December 1, 2014, to January 31, 2015. This unique quasiexperimental setting allowed for
better characterization of air pollutant exposure effects because the participants spent most
of their time in controlled indoor environments. Concentrations of indoor and outdoor ozone,
along with the copollutants particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, were
monitored throughout the study period and then combined with time-activity information
and filtration conditions of each residence and office to estimate 24-hour and 2-week
combined indoor and outdoor mean exposure concentrations. Associations between each
exposure measure and outcome measure were analyzed using single-pollutant and
2-pollutant linear mixed models controlling for ambient temperature, secondhand smoke
exposure, and personal-level time-varying covariates.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Biomarkers indicative of inflammation and oxidative stress,
arterial stiffness, blood pressure, thrombotic factors, and spirometry were measured at
4 sessions.
RESULTS Of the 89 participants, 25 (28%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 31.5 (7.6)
years. The 24-hour ozone exposure concentrations ranged from 1.4 to 19.4 parts per billion
(ppb), corresponding to outdoor concentrations ranging from 4.3 to 47.9 ppb. Within this
range, in models controlling for a second copollutant and other potential confounders, a
10-ppb increase in 24-hour ozone was associated with mean increases of 36.3% (95% CI,
29.9%-43.0%) in the level of platelet activation marker soluble P-selectin, 2.8% (95% CI,
0.6%-5.1%) in diastolic blood pressure, 18.1% (95% CI, 4.5%-33.5%) in pulmonary
inflammation markers fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and 31.0% (95% CI, 0.2%-71.1%) in
exhaled breath condensate nitrite and nitrate as well as a −9.5% (95% CI, −17.7% to −1.4%)
decrease in arterial stiffness marker augmentation index. A 10-ppb increase in 2-week ozone
was associated with increases of 61.1% (95% CI, 37.8%-88.2%) in soluble P-selectin level and
126.2% (95% CI, 12.1%-356.2%) in exhaled breath condensate nitrite and nitrate level. Other
measured biomarkers, including spirometry, showed no significant associations with either
24-hour ozone or 2-week ozone exposures.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Short-term ozone exposure at levels not associated with lung
function changes was associated with platelet activation and blood pressure increases,
suggesting a possible mechanism by which ozone may affect cardiovascular health.

 A
irborne particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm
or less (PM2.5) has often been reported to be associ-
ated with the cardiovascular toxic effects of air pollu-
tion mixtures and ozone (O3) with respiratory illness.1,2 How-
ever,thereisincreasingevidencethatO3,independentofPM2.5,
is also associated with cardiovascular mortality.3,4 For ex-
ample, O3 has been associated with increases in mortality due
to embolism and thrombosis,5 ischemic heart disease,3 heart
failure,4 and stroke.6 However, not all studies reporting asso-
ciations of O3 with cardiovascular outcomes found that the as-
sociationswereindependentfromparticulatematterandother
gaseous pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur
dioxide (SO2).7,8 Other studies have found nonsignificant or
seemingly “beneficial” associations between O3 and cardio-
vascular outcomes.9,10 The uncertainty in epidemiologic find-
ingsofO3cardiovasculareffectsisfurtherenhancedbythelim-
ited understanding of biological mechanisms underlying the
epidemiologic associations.11
The relative uniformity of lifestyle patterns and proxim-
ity of participants living and working together at a work cam-
pus in Changsha City, China, presented a unique opportunity
to monitor pollutants in indoor and outdoor air and to mea-
sure changes in the levels of biomarkers pertinent to cardio-
respiratory disease risk. The cardiovascular biomarkers used
in this study have all been associated with air pollution expo-
sureinpreviousstudies,12althoughnotnecessarilywithO3spe-
cifically. This study also includes lung function measures that
have consistently been associated with O3 concentration in
short-term, controlled-exposure experiments.11 In addition,
this setting facilitated the manipulation of indoor PM2.5 and
O3 concentrations through the use of various filtration tech-
nologies in all the participants’residences and offices. Filtra-
tion provided an opportunity to generate different temporal
patterns between O3 and PM2.5 exposures, which helped to dis-
entangle the effects of these 2 major pollutants.
Methods
Study Subjects
We recruited 89 healthy white-collar workers living and work-
ing at the Broad Company Campus (Broad Town) in suburban
Changsha, China. Each participant completed a questionnaire
and underwent basic metabolic blood panel screenings for pre-
vious medical conditions to ensure a healthy baseline status.
All participants had to be older than 18 years, work in one of 2
BroadTownoffices,spendatleast4nightseachweekinthedor-
mitories, and be free from major chronic diseases as self-
reported by the participants. In addition, abnormal blood lipid
levels or markers of kidney, liver, or other metabolic dysfunc-
tion were grounds for exclusion. The ethics committee of the
Shanghai First People’
s Hospital and the campus institutional
review board of Duke University approved the study protocol.
Explicit written consent was obtained from all participants.
The present exploration focusing on pathophysiologic
mechanisms of O3 cardiovascular effects used data collected
infieldexperimentsinwhichindoorPM2.5concentrationswere
manipulated through varying filtration technologies to re-
move particulate matter entering the offices and dormitory
rooms. These filters included minibag filters, electrostatic pre-
cipitators, and high-efficiency particulate air filters, which had
a PM2.5 removal efficiency of approximately 50%, 60%, and
>99%, respectively. Electrostatic precipitators generated ap-
proximately 13.5 parts per billion (ppb) of incidental O3 in the
downstream air ducts, corresponding to a 3-ppb increase in
steady state indoor concentrations13 (eMethods in the Supple-
ment). On different dates, 1 or more of these filtration tech-
nologies were used in the offices and dormitories.
Outcome Measurements
We measured the following biomarkers: exhaled breath con-
densate (EBC) malondialdehyde (MDA) for pulmonary oxida-
tive stress14; fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)15 and the
sum of EBC nitrite and nitrate (EBCNN) for pulmonary
inflammation14; forced expiratory volume in the first second
(FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1:FVC ratio for lung
function;C-reactiveprotein(CRP)forsystemicinflammation16;
urinary 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) for oxidative
stress17;brachialsystolicbloodpressure(SBP)anddiastolicblood
pressure (DBP) for vascular tone18; brachial augmentation in-
dex (AI) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) for ar-
terial stiffness19; soluble P-selectin (sCD62P) for platelet
activation20;andvonWillebrandfactor(VWF)forhemostasis.21
Each participant was assessed 4 times over a 9-week pe-
riod (from December 2, 2014, to January 30, 2015), with about
2 weeks in between assessments. Efforts were made to con-
duct all sessions for each participant on the same day of the
week and at the same time of day, although work schedules
necessitated some rescheduling. No sessions were scheduled
within a day following a trip off campus.
Each session started with a venous blood and urine col-
lection at 8 AM, followed throughout the day by any order of
breath and EBC collections as well as blood pressure and ar-
terial stiffness measurements, with spirometry always con-
ducted last. Blood samples were centrifuged, and plasma ali-
quots were stored at −30°C before analysis for sCD62P, CRP,
and VWF using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
method (R&D Systems for CRP and sCD62P; RayBiotech for
Key Points
Questions Which cardiovascular disease pathophysiologic
mechanisms might explain the epidemiologic association between
ozone and cardiovascular mortality, and at what concentrations
are these mechanisms associated with ozone?
Findings In this cohort study of 89 healthy adults, ozone
exposure was associated with markers of platelet activation and
increased blood pressure. Ozone concentrations were lower than
the levels capable of influencing pulmonary function, which is the
main basis for current regulatory standards.
Meaning Standards for safe ozone exposure should take into
account its association with cardiovascular disease risk, which
appears to occur at lower levels of ozone exposure than
respiratory effects.

 VWF). Urine samples were immediately frozen for later solid-
phase extraction and liquid chromatography–mass spectro-
metry analysis for 8-OHdG.22 Breath sample collection and
analyses, spirometry, blood pressure, AI, and PWV measure-
ments were conducted using standard procedures (eMethods
in the Supplement).
Exposure Measurements
Outdoor PM2.5, O3, NO2, and SO2 concentrations were mea-
sured at a government station 4.5 km from the study site. This
station was predominantly upwind of the study site, and there
were few major roadways and other local air pollution sources
between the station and the study site. A comparison of the
concentrations measured simultaneously at both sites showed
a slope of 1.03 and R2 of 0.998 for PM2.5 and a slope of 0.97
and R2 of 0.988 for O3 in least squares linear regressions. In-
doorPM2.5massconcentrationandO3concentrationwerecon-
tinuously measured in the 2 involved offices during the day
and in 2 dormitory rooms per night using field-calibrated
(against a primary method at the study location) nephelom-
eters for PM2.5 concentration measurement (SidePak AM510;
TSIInc)andaUVabsorptionmonitorforO3concentrationmea-
surement (Model 205; 2B Tech) (eMethods in the Supple-
ment). These measurements were used to establish indoor/
outdoor (I/O) ratios taking into account known indoor sources
and filtration conditions (see eTable 2 in the Supplement),
which were later used to estimate hourly averages for PM2.5
and O3 concentrations outside of the monitoring times. These
I/O ratios were found to be within 25% of measured I/O ratios
during monitoring times.
Because NO2 and SO2 were not affected by the filtration
conditions, these were not measured indoors. Instead, I/O ra-
tios of 0.8 for NO2 and 0.5 for SO2 were assumed for all indoor
spaces on the basis of physical characteristics of the dormito-
ries and offices coupled with previous relevant literature.23,24
Time-activity questionnaire data were integrated with in-
door and outdoor O3 and PM2.5 hourly mean concentrations
to calculate 24-hour exposure concentrations. The assumed
I/O ratios for unknown indoor environments were 0.35 for O3
and0.8forPM2.5accordingtopreviousfindingsinlightlysealed
indoorspaces25,26andexpectationsforstructuresintheChang-
sha region. Because the study was organized with approxi-
mately 2-week breaks between biomarker measurements,
2-week exposure concentrations were estimated as represen-
tative of “subchronic” exposure effects (eMethods in the
Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Depending on data distribution, values of certain biomarkers
were natural logarithm–transformed in statistical analyses
(Supplementary Methods in the Supplement). Linear mixed
models with participant-specific intercepts were used to ana-
lyze concentration-response associations between each bio-
marker and each exposure measure. The use of participant-
specificinterceptsinmixedmodelsaccountsforthecorrelation
between within-participant repeated measurements and pre-
cludes the need to control for participant characteristics that
do not change between measurements (eg, age). Two-
pollutant models for all combinations of 24-hour or 2-week ex-
posures were performed to test whether the associations ob-
served in the single-pollutant models remained after
controlling for a second pollutant. All models controlled for
24-hour mean ambient temperature and time spent in a room
with a smoker as an approximation of secondhand smoke ex-
posure. Because we expected an unequal influence of certain
covariates on the biomarkers, we used a backward stepwise
model selection method to select the following additional co-
variatesforeachmodel:respiratoryinfectionstatus,menstrua-
tionstatus,dayoftheweek,andhourssincetheparticipantlast
ate(seecovariatesineTable5intheSupplement).Multipletest-
ing–corrected P values were obtained using the Benjamini-
Yekutieli method of reducing the false discovery rate while al-
lowing for an arbitrary dependence structure in the predictor
and outcome variables.27 A 2-sided P = .05 indicated statisti-
calsignificance.InBenjamini-Yekutielimultipletestingcorrec-
tion, the new, higher statistical significance level was P = .05.
Sensitivity analyses included models excluding all smok-
ers and ex-smokers, all observations reporting secondhand
smoke exposure, or outlying values from the models. We also
assessed 5 separate models by controlling for 1 of the follow-
ing in the main model: (1) all 4 of the aforementioned step-
wise method-selected covariates, (2) curvilinear associations
with temperature using a cubic spline, (3) relative humidity,
(4) wind direction and speed, and (5) interaction between a
building filtration condition and a pollutant. All calculations
were made using the “nlme,” “openair,” and “stats” packages
in R version 3.2.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing).

at least 1 visit were included in the analyses.
Air Pollution Exposure
Table 2 gives summary statistics for the outdoor and total ex-
posure concentrations averaged over the 24-hour and 2-week
period prior to each biomarker sampling time. The 24-hour O3
exposure concentrations corresponded to the daily maxi-
mum 8-hour rolling mean (SD) outdoor concentrations of 28.2
(15.6) ppb, which was lower than the daily maximum 8-hour
O3 concentrations associated with cardiovascular mortality4
but within the range of concentrations associated with some
cardiovascular risk indicators (eg, decreased heart rate vari-
ability and fibrinolysis).28 In contrast, the 24-hour PM2.5 ex-
posure concentrations, corresponding to mean (SD) outdoor
24-hour concentrations of 91.20 (53.97) μg/m3, were higher
than typical PM2.5 concentrations associated with increased
cardiorespiratory mortality risk.29 The 24-hour NO2 and SO2
exposure concentrations, corresponding to mean (SD) out-
doorconcentrationsof28.62(8.23)ppbforNO2and11.68(2.95)
ppb for SO2, were comparable to levels that have been previ-
ously associated with cardiovascular mortality.30,31
Ozone was the only pollutant measured to have negative
correlations with other pollutants, with the 2-week O3 expo-
suremorestronglynegativelycorrelated(eTable4intheSupple-
ment). In contrast, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 concentrations were all
positively correlated with each other. The 24-hour and 2-week
exposure concentrations for all the pollutants were positively
correlated with their respective outdoor concentrations.
Biomarker Responses
Biomarker concentrations and values are summarized in
Table 3. Using these values in single-pollutant models, we
found that a 10-ppb increase in 24-hour O3 exposure concen-
tration (Figure 1) was associated with significant increases in
FeNO (24.1%; 95% CI, 11.0%-38.8%), EBCNN (53.8%; 95% CI,
23.6%-91.5%),8-OHdG(13.5%;95%CI,2.6%-25.6%),SBP(3.1%;
95% CI, 1.4%-4.8%), DBP (4.4%; 2.5%-6.3%), and sCD62P
(36.2%; 95% CI, 30.6%-42.0%) levels and with significant de-
creases in EBC MDA level (−26.3%; 95% CI, −37.9% to −12.4%)
and AI (−10.2%; 95% CI, −17.6% to −2.8%). For 2-week O3 ex-
posure concentration, a 10-ppb increase was associated with
significant increases in FeNO (47.2%; 95% CI, 15.9%-86.9%),
EBCNN (158.9%; 95% CI, 61.2%-315.8%), 8-OHdG (37.0%; 95%
CI, 11.1%-69.0%), SBP (8.7%; 95% CI, 5.0%-12.3%), DBP (10.1%;
95% CI, 6.2%-14.0%), and sCD62P (100.9%; 95% CI, 84.3%-
118.9%) level as well as with significant decreases in EBC MDA
level(−52.0%;95%CI,−67.0%to−30.4%)andAI(−26.5%;95%
CI, −42.1% to −10.8%) and increases in FEV1 (2.6%; 95% CI,
0.02%-5.2%), and FVC (2.2%; 95% CI, 0.04%-4.3%) levels. Af-
ter multiple testing correction, the following associations be-
came nonsignificant: the association between 24-hour O3 con-
centration and AI; the association between 2-week O3
concentration and FeNO level; and the associations between
both averaging times of O3 concentration and 8-OHdG, FEV1,
and FVC levels.
Incontrast,thesingle-pollutantmodelsshowedthatPM2.5,
NO2, and SO2 exposure concentrations all appear to be asso-
ciated with fewer biomarkers than O3 exposure concentra-
tion. Each of these pollutants shared various positive associa-
tions with EBC MDA level and AI, with only the 2-week NO2
exposure concentration significantly associated with in-
creases in EBC MDA level (29.9%; 95% CI, 11.5%-51.2%) as well
as the 2-week SO2 exposure concentration significantly asso-
ciatedwithincreasesinEBCMDAlevel(258.9%;95%CI,92.4%-
569.4%) and AI (53.1%; 95% CI, 26.9%-79.3%) after multiple
testing correction. Before but not after multiple testing cor-
rection, 2-week NO2 exposure concentration was signifi-
cantly associated with adverse changes in EBC MDA level
(37.5%; 95% CI, 1.5%-86.2%) and FEV1 level (−2.0%; 95% CI,
−3.9% to −0.04%), 2-week SO2 exposure concentration was as-
sociated with a significant worsening of PWV (12.4%; 95% CI,
1.8%-22.9%), 24-hour PM2.5 exposure concentration was as-
sociated with a significant decrease in FVC (−0.2%; 95% CI,

had with FeNO, EBCNN, 8-OHdG, SBP, DBP, and sCD62P mea-

sCD62P level remained significant after multiple testing cor-
rection and after controlling for a copollutant, although con-
trolling for NO2 and SO2 exposure concentration decreased the
effect size of the 2-week associations. For the 24-hour O3 and
DBP, FeNO, and EBCNN associations as well as the associa-
tion between 2-week O3 and EBCNN, the associations main-
tained a similar effect size. However, significance was lost af-

tion showed an increase in sCD62P level associated with 24-
hour NO2 that was significant only before correction. Finally,
only the 2-week SO2 positive association with AI and nega-
tive associations with FeNO and sCD62P levels remained sig-
nificant, although not after multiple testing correction. Nei-
ther the FEV1:FVC ratio nor the CRP level was significantly
associated with exposure to O3 or other pollutants in any of
our statistical models.
The results of the sensitivity analyses did not change our
conclusions from the main analysis. The sensitivity analysis
models generally had higher Akaike and Bayes information cri-
teria, which are indicators of model overfitting. Therefore, we
report the results from the main model analyses.
Discussion
This study’
s principal finding is that O3 exposures were posi-
tively associated with sCD62P level but not lung function and
pulmonaryinflammationaftercontrollingforcopollutantsand
multiple testing correction. An independent O3 association (ie,
after copollutant adjustment) was observed with blood pres-
sure, although this association did not remain significant af-
ter multiple testing correction. This finding suggests that O3
exposure may enhance cardiovascular disease risk via plate-
let activation and increased blood pressure at concentrations
lower than those required to cause lung function impair-
ment. This result provides mechanistic evidence for the epi-
demiologic association observed previously between cardio-
respiratory mortality and O3 exposure at levels largely below
the current US Environmental Protection Agency ambient air
quality standards, the values of which are partially based on
the lower limits of observed lung function decrements follow-
ing O3 exposures.32
To our knowledge, this study is the first to show positive
associations between low-level O3 exposure and sCD62P level,
a biomarker of platelet activation20 linked to deep venous
thrombosis33 and associated with increased risk for many car-
diovasculardiseases.20ThesCD62Plevelassociationswithboth
the 24-hour and 2-week O3 exposure remained robust to mul-
tiple testing P value correction and in all models, suggesting a
strong association independent of other pollutants. Al-
though the association between O3 exposure and the sCD62P
level in blood has not been previously observed, an acute

Biomarkers are organized by mechanistic category, first showing pulmonary
oxidative stress (exhaled breath condensate malondialdehyde [EBC MDA]),
then pulmonary inflammation (fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] and the
sum of EBC nitrite and nitrate [EBCNN]), lung function (forced expiratory
volume in the first second [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]), systemic
oxidative stress (urinary 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG]), vascular
tone (systolic and diastolic blood pressure [SBP and DBP]), arterial stiffness
(augmentation index [AI] and pulse wave velocity [PWV]), and hemostasis
(soluble P-selectin [sCD62P] and von Willebrand factor [VWF]). NO2 indicates
nitrogen dioxide; O3, ozone; PM2.5, particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm
or less; and SO2, sulfur dioxide.

 2-hour exposure to 200-ppb O3 was associated with a signifi-
cant upregulation in surface P-selectin level on airway vascu-
lar endothelial cells.34 As a possible mechanism by which O3
exposure leads to platelet activation and sCD62P upregula-
tion, lung epithelial cells exposed in vitro to lipid ozonation
products produced by O3 interactions with airway lipids have
been shown to produce platelet-activating factor.35 In terms
of O3 exposure associations with other thrombogenic factors,
previous evidence of a link between ambient levels of O3 com-
parable to those seen in this study and a procoagulant state in-
cludes associations between factor VII coagulant activity and
annual mean O3 concentration36 and between 24-hour mean
O3 concentration and increased levels of fibrinolysis inhibi-
torPAI-1(orplasminogenactivatorinhibitor-1).28Athighercon-
centrations (>70 ppb), an association between ambient O3 ex-
posure and a procoagulant state has also been suggested by
increases in fibrinogen level and VWF.37
Another result relevant to the effect of O3 exposure on car-
diovascular disease risk is the association between O3 expo-
sure and both SBP and DBP levels, although these associa-
tions appeared less robust in the multiple testing–corrected
2-pollutant models compared with the association between O3

 and sCD62P. Two previous studies found that O3 exposure was
negatively (beneficially) or not associated with blood
pressure,38,39 but a recent study has shown a positive associa-
tion between O3 and both SBP and DBP measurements at
slightly higher exposure concentrations.40 A possible mecha-
nism underlying an effect on blood pressure is increased sen-
sitivity to serotonin-induced vasoconstriction and decreased
sensitivitytoacetylcholine-inducedvasodilation,aswasshown
recently with acute O3 exposures in rats.41 Associations be-
tween hypertension and sCD62P level have been shown
previously,42potentiallypointingtocommonmechanismslink-
ing hypertension and platelet activation that could be in-
volved in the associations of O3 exposure with sCD62P level
and blood pressure.
In addition, we found associations between O3 exposure
andbiomarkersreflectingpulmonaryinflammation(FeNOand
EBCNN) that remained significant in the 2-pollutant models
but not after multiple testing correction. Previously, FeNO has
been positively associated with exposure to outdoor O3,28,43
and airway NO2 production by nitric oxide synthase has been
shown to play an important role in mediating airway inflam-
mation in response to acute O3 exposure in rodents.44 The
EBCNN level reflects NO2 metabolism in the airways.14 Al-
though the EBCNN level has not previously been associated
with ambient O3 exposure in humans,45 acute O3 exposures in
rodents have resulted in increases in airway lavage fluid
nitrate.46Theseresultssuggestamechanisticlinkbetweenpul-
monary inflammatory effects and downstream cardiovascu-
lar effects, in which we propose that products of ozonation re-
actions or oxidative inflammatory mediators propagate
inflammatory signals throughout the circulation.
For the other measured pollutants, we observed associa-
tions that were significant before but not after multiple test-
ing correction in the 2-pollutant models between VWF level
and 2-week PM2.5 exposure concentration and between AI and
2-weekSO2exposureconcentration.Previousstudieshavesug-
gested a correlation between PM2.5 concentration and in-
creased endothelial cell dysfunction as indicated by VWF
levels.47 Although SO2 concentration has not previously been
associated with AI, it has been previously associated with the
related arterial stiffness marker PWV.48 In contrast to previ-
ousstudies,12thePM2.5,NO2,andSO2exposureswere,toalarge
extent, not significantly associated with most of the biomark-
ers after controlling for copollutants in this study. Previous
studies have suggested a plateau in the association between
PM2.5 and health effects at high concentrations29; thus, the ob-
served concentration changes may have been at levels too high
to effect measurable biomarker changes. Counterintuitively,
these pollutants even showed beneficial associations with
8-OHdGlevel(with24-hourPM2.5concentrationonly),sCD62P
level(with2-weekSO2concentrationonly),andSBPlevel(with
24-hour PM2.5 and 2-week NO2 concentrations only) that were
robust to controlling for copollutants and multiple testing cor-
rection. Given that protective effects are not expected accord-
ing to the literature and biological plausibility, it is likely that
these seemingly beneficial associations are artifacts of these
pollutants being positively correlated with some other fac-
tors that were negatively correlated with the biomarkers.
It is possible that pollutants correlated with O3 exposure,
including O3-derived products, could also be implicated in
these novel associations between low-level O3 exposure and
cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers. Ozone reacts quickly
with various unsaturated organic compounds in the indoor en-
vironment to produce highly reactive gaseous and con-
densed phase products, such as ultrafine particles.49 Al-
though the evidence for cardiopulmonary effects of exposure
to O3-initiated reaction products is inconclusive at environ-
mental concentrations,50 there is evidence supporting a link
between ultrafine particles and cardiovascular outcomes, in-
cluding platelet activation and SBP level.47 However, blood
pressure has also been associated with personal exposure to
O3 independent of ultrafine particle concentrations.40 Ulti-
mately, this study cannot determine whether the observed as-
sociationsbetweencardiovascularoutcomesandO3arecaused
by the effects of O3 exposure itself or its reaction products.
Limitations
This natural experiment used the unique exposure condi-
tions of participants spending most of their time in con-
trolled indoor environments. However, it has several limita-
tions. It is impossible to completely rule out the influence of
potentialuncontrolledconfounders,limitingtheabilitytomake
causal determinations because of the reliance on uncon-
trolled longitudinal associations. In addition, our estimates of
2-week exposure concentrations were based on data from four
24-hourquestionnaires,amethodthatislessprecisethanmea-
suringexposureoverafull2-weekperiodbutmoreprecisethan
simply using ambient concentrations. Although the 24-hour
O3,PM2.5,NO2,andSO2exposureswerewellcharacterized,un-
measured pollutants (eg, products of O3-initiated reactions) or
other unmeasured factors may explain more of the variation
in the observed biomarker-pollutant relationships. Uncon-
trolled residual confounding may have influenced the pollut-
ant-biomarker associations observed in the study, including
those counterintuitive associations.
Conclusions
This study provides mechanistic support to previously ob-
served associations between low-level O3 exposure and car-
diovascular disease outcomes. The findings offer insights into
possible underlying biological mechanisms, namely, platelet
activation and increases in blood pressure. Given that global
tropospheric O3 concentration is rising,51 it is imperative to de-
termine how to minimize its harms on health.
