Mucosal melanoma is a rare and poorly characterized subtype of human melanoma. Here we
perform a cross-species analysis by sequencing tumor-germline pairs from 46 primary
human muscosal, 65 primary canine oral and 28 primary equine melanoma cases from
mucosal sites. Analysis of these data reveals recurrently mutated driver genes shared
between species such as NRAS, FAT4, PTPRJ, TP53 and PTEN, and pathogenic germline alleles
of BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53. We identify a UV mutation signature in a small number of
samples, including human cases from the lip and nasal mucosa. A cross-species comparative
analysis of recurrent copy number alterations identifies several candidate drivers including
MDM2, B2M, KNSTRN and BUB1B. Comparison of somatic mutations in recurrences and
metastases to those in the primary tumor suggests pervasive intra-tumor heterogeneity.
Collectively, these studies suggest a convergence of some genetic changes in mucosal
melanomas between species but also distinctly different paths to tumorigenesis.

n European-descent populations, the majority of melanomas
develop as a result of UV light exposure on hair-bearing skin,
most commonly the trunk in men and the legs in women.
Other subtypes of melanoma include uveal melanoma, which
develops in the eye and acral lentiginous melanoma, which forms
on locations such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet1.
In a small proportion of cases, melanoma may also develop at
mucosal sites such as in the lining of the anal canal, vulva, vagina,
urethra and in the oral and nasal cavities2. This type of melanoma
represents around 1–2% of all cases, but comprises a higher
proportion of diagnoses in non-white populations, where cuta-
neous melanoma is less common2. Intriguingly, while cutaneous
melanoma is more common in men, mucosal melanoma is as
much as two times more prevalent in women, due to the
occurrence of vaginal/vulvar melanomas3, particularly in the sixth
decade and beyond4. While hundreds of genomes of cutaneous
melanoma have now been sequenced, defining a landscape that is
replete with UV-induced mutations and driver mutations in
genes such as BRAF, the genomes of tumors that develop at
mucosal sites have not been as well characterized5–8. To date,
only ~20 human mucosal cases have been sequenced, revealing a
genomic landscape that is associated with a low single nucleotide
mutation burden and no evidence of a UV signature, but
numerous
large-scale
copy
number
changes
and
whole-
chromosome gains and losses5–8. It is also known that the pro-
file of driver genes differs among human melanoma subtypes6; for
example, BRAF mutations, which are found in around 45% of
cutaneous melanomas, are rarely found in mucosal melanoma5–8.
The abovementioned difference in mutation burden is significant
since most of the effort towards developing new therapies for
melanoma has shifted to immunotherapies, which have yielded
impressive results in tumors with a high mutational load, but
appear less effective in mucosal melanomas, which have fewer
neo-antigens9. Similarly, small molecular drugs that target
mutant oncoproteins such as BRAFV600E have been developed,
but these agents are not suitable for most cases of the mucosal
subtype10.
Advances in our understanding of cutaneous melanoma have
been facilitated by a range of animal models, which have helped
to delineate not only the basic biology of the disease, but also the
role of driver genes, and the mechanisms of response and resis-
tance to targeted therapies11–13. In the context of mucosal mel-
anoma, the most widely accepted animal model is canine
melanoma, which bears histological similarities to the human
disease and generally develops in the oral mucosa14. Dogs have
been used extensively to explore the role of new therapies such as
vaccination for disease management, but with the exception of
analysing driver genes such as BRAF and NRAS, little is known
about the genetic landscape of this malignancy and how canine
and human mucosal melanomas compare13,15–17. Similarly,
horses also develop melanoma at sites in or near mucosal tissues,
but it is not clear how genetically similar these tumors are when
compared to tumors from humans13. Intriguingly, equine mela-
nomas are generally more indolent when compared with human
or canine mucosal melanomas and as such represent an inter-
esting comparator for a cross-species analysis.
Here, we sequence the exomes of human mucosal, canine oral
and equine melanomas and matched normal tissues to char-
acterize the somatic mutational landscape of melanoma in each
species, which allowed us to perform a cross-species comparative
analysis of recurrent mutations and copy number changes. We
also identify germline predisposing alleles implicated in disease
development. We find similarities in terms of mutant genes and
pathways, suggesting evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of
tumor development, but also striking differences between species
that help inform on the biology of mucosal melanoma.
Results
Sequencing and analysis of melanomas from each species. We
performed whole-exome sequencing of tumor-germline pairs
from 46 primary human mucosal melanoma cases, 65 primary
oral canine melanoma cases and 28 primary equine melanoma
cases.
The
equine
melanomas
sequenced
originated
from
mucosal-like (perineum, perianal region, prepuce, vulva, or ven-
tral tail) or mucocutaneous sites (near the eyes or mouth that are
in both mucosa and haired skin) (see Methods). For comparison,
we also sequenced equine melanomas from cutaneous sites
(haired skin only) (32 cases) and other sites (urinary bladder wall
muscle and the parotid gland) (2 cases). In addition to primary
mucosal cases, we sequenced 5 locoregional recurrences and 8
metastases (7 locoregional and 1 distant) from human patients,
and 6 distant metastases from canine patients (Supplementary
Data 1). All cases were reviewed by dermatopathologists and
medical and/or veterinary pathologists (see Methods). A sum-
mary of the cases is provided in Supplementary Data 1, including
clinical details such as the sex and age of each patient and time
from primary to recurrence or metastasis, where available. We
also determined patient ethnicity using a principal component
analysis (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1). To generate
sequencing libraries for the equine cases, we designed whole-
exome capture baits covering all protein-coding transcripts
annotated in the equine reference genome EquCab2.0 in Ensembl
release 79, and for the canine cases we used baits designed using
transcripts in the canine reference genome CanFam3.1 in
Ensembl release 74 (see Methods). Sequencing libraries for
human cases were generated using the Agilent SureSelect All
Exon V5 platform. Sequencing was performed to a median depth
of 81-, 78-, and 67-fold coverage for human, canine, and equine
samples, respectively, after excluding PCR duplicates. To explore
the genetic landscape of these melanomas, we generated profiles
of somatic point mutations, multi-nucleotide variants, indels, and
somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) using MuTect (v1.1.7)
18, MAC (v1.2)19, Strelka (v1.0.15)20, and Sequenza (v2.1.2)21,
respectively, and filtered and quality controlled these variant calls
as described in the Methods. Complete lists of the somatic
mutations identified in each case are provided in Supplementary
Data 2.
Tumor mutational load and mutational signature analysis. It
was notable that most of the human mucosal, canine oral, and
equine melanomas we sequenced had less than 5 mutations/Mb
(Fig. 1), unlike UV-associated human subtypes such as superficial
spreading and nodular melanoma6. We did, however, identify a
UV mutation signature (COSMIC signature 722, see Methods) in
4 human (3 primaries and 1 locoregional recurrence) and 5
equine samples (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The 5 equine
tumors, 3 from non-mucocutaneous skin (HD0083a, HD0084a,
and HD0071a), one from the vulva (HD0021a) and another from
the third eyelid (HD0032a), were located at sun-exposed sites, as
was a human sample from the mucosal surface of the lip
(PD26932a), while the remaining 3 human samples (PD25657a,
PD25643a and matched recurrence PD25643c) were from the
nasal mucosa. Notably, a low mutation burden combined with a
slight enrichment of C>T mutations has been reported previously
in a mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity in a small sequencing
study of 5 samples, suggesting a potential role for UV in the
development of some mucosal cases from this site8. By pooling all
mutations found within each species to identify additional sig-
natures within each cohort, we also identified COSMIC signature
122 in the human and canine melanomas, which has previously
been found in all cancer types and is known to be correlated with
age (see Methods and Supplementary Table 1). No other

 signatures were identified with high confidence. As mutation
rates were low in the tumors not affected by UV light exposure,
sequencing of additional samples and/or whole-genome sequen-
cing may reveal additional known or novel signatures in mucosal
melanoma.
As the gray phenotype, associated with progressive silvering of
colored hair, has been linked to melanoma development in
horses, we obtained a coat color phenotype for each case from
clinical records (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). In the
cutaneous melanomas, samples with a higher mutational load
were generally from horses without the gray coat phenotype,
suggesting a different path to melanoma development in these
cases (Fig. 1). Although the gray phenotype is known to
predispose to melanomas in and around mucosal sites, a
definitive association between this coat color phenotype and
mutational load was not evident for mucocutaneous/mucosal-like
cases.
The driver mutation landscape of melanomas from each spe-
cies. Identifying driver mutations and altered pathways allows for
the molecular classification of cancers, which can facilitate disease
prognostication and management. A recent pan-melanoma
study6 identified 12 significantly mutated genes in a cohort
composed of superficial spreading, nodular, acral, and several
mucosal melanomas. We first asked which of these genes, or ten
other genes previously suggested to be disease associated, were
altered in primary tumors from our collection (Fig. 1). In keeping
with previous reports, human mucosal melanomas sequenced in
our study carried mutations in genes including NRAS (20%; 4
cases with Q61R/K, 2 cases with G12C/V, 2 cases with G13D, 1
case with Y64N), GNAQ (2%; V121L), KIT (7%; 2 cases with
L576P, 1 case with D419H and V654A), SF3B1 (20%; 6 cases with
R625H/C, and 3 other cases), and TP53 (15%; 8 different muta-
tions in 7 samples), but lacked alterations of several other genes
including CDK4, RAC1, and PPP6C, whose respective mutation
has been observed in cutaneous melanoma5–8. Also absent were
mutations in POLE, PTCHD2/DISP3, and DMXL2, which were
recently reported in a study of Asian patients with mucosal
melanoma of the oral cavity23, while 3 cases (7%) carried PTPRD
mutations (P823S, T1246M, and V634fs), as reported in the same
study (Supplementary Data 2). This discrepancy may reflect
differences in ascertainment, as our study presents cases from a
range of tissue sites collected from predominantly European-
descent patients (Supplementary Fig. 1), but it may also illustrate
the heterogeneity of the disease. Intriguingly, while NRAS
mutations were the most common somatic change in sinonasal
tumors, these tumors were devoid of TP53 mutations, which were
common in tumors from other mucosal sites (Fig. 1). Similarly,
SF3B1 R625 mutations were rare in sinonasal tumors, with the
majority found in vaginal, vulvar, or anal tumors, as reported
previously24. The same study reported co-mutation of NF1 and
KIT, which we observed in only one case in our sample collection.
To determine whether the apparent differences in somatically
mutated genes were significantly associated with tumor tissue site
or other clinical parameters, we de-sparsified the human somatic

 mutation data into biological pathways using SAMBAR25, per-
formed a principal components analysis (PCA), and a linear
regression between the top 5 principal components (PCs) and the
available phenotypic variables (tissue site, tumor group, sex, age
of diagnosis, or onset) (see Methods). We visualized the results of
these associations in a heatmap (Supplementary Fig. 2), which
showed that none of the PCs were associated with the phenotypic
variables after correcting for multiple testing, suggesting that
tumors arising from different mucosal sites do not represent
different subtypes, at least at the level of altered pathways. Future
efforts to aggregate datasets to increase the sample size and to
incorporate addition features such as methylation profiles may
reveal subtype differences that were not evident in the current
study.
To examine the mutational landscape of established melanoma
genes in canine and equine melanomas, we identified the canine
and equine orthologs of human genes by searching for genes by
gene symbol and obtaining orthology relationships from the
Ensembl database (release 91) (Supplementary Data 3). The
melanoma genes in Fig. 1 that were not annotated in either the
canine or equine genomes are indicated. These genes either had
no ortholog or had one or more orthologs but no gene symbol
assigned. With the exception of canine MAP2K2, all other genes
in Fig. 1 had one-to-one orthology with a human counterpart
(Supplementary Data 3).
Our analysis of canine oral melanomas, widely considered a
model of human mucosal melanoma, revealed no KIT mutations,
however, we identified NRAS (11%; 4 cases with Q61H/R/K, 3
cases with G12A/D), TP53 (8%; 5 different mutations in 5 cases),
BRAF (3%; G457A, D582G), and KRAS mutations (5%; G12D/V,
G13D) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 2). Notably, the canine
oral melanomas in our series also lacked SF3B1 and GNAQ
mutations, and no mutations in POLE, PTPRD, or DMXL2 were
found, suggesting that these canine cancers may not represent a
faithful genetic model for the subset of human mucosal
melanomas with mutations in these genes. Only one case carried
a missense mutation in PTCHD2/DISP3 (Supplementary Data 2).
Surprisingly, only two (3%) canine oral melanoma cases carried a
truncating mutation in PTPRJ, which was recently suggested to be
inactivated in as many as 23% of canine mucosal melanomas26.
We next asked what driver genes were mutated in equine
melanomas from mucocutaneous or mucosal-like sites. The most
prominent driver genes were NRAS (14%; 3 cases with Q61R, 1
case with G12A) and TP53 (14%, or 4 cases with 6 mutations;
H54Y and P27S, R33W, R125W, and R158W and a deletion,
g.50612732_50612735del, affecting a splice acceptor site), while
two cases had mutations in BRAF (7%; V594E, and both P321L
and S56L in vulvar tumor HD0021a). Mutations were also
observed in PTEN (R202*, Y41fs), KIT (S339F), and RB1 (inframe
deletion p.N366_R374delinsK), with 14% of samples carrying a
mutation in at least one of these genes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Data 2). Intriguingly, we also found C>T missense mutations in
the KNSTRN gene, previously implicated in human cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma27, in 1 cutaneous melanoma (L27F
in HD0004a) and two mucosal-like samples with a high
mutation rate and UV signature (L27F in HD0021a, and P28L
in HD0032a). In humans, a recurrent C>T UV signature-
associated hotspot mutation at a nearby residue (S24F) was
shown to disrupt chromatid cohesion27. However, because there
is weak protein sequence conservation between human and horse
in this region, functional studies are required to determine the
effect of these mutations on KNSTRN gene function in horse. As
described above for the human mucosal melanomas, we used the
SAMBAR algorithm25 to look for an association between
mutational patterns and tissue site and other variables (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). No associations were found, suggesting that
equine tumors from different mucosal-like or mucocutaneous
sites are very similar.
As noted above, as a comparator to our sequencing of equine
melanomas from in and around mucosal sites, we sequenced 32
cases of equine cutaneous melanoma from anatomical sites such
as the abdomen, thigh and shoulder (Supplementary Data 1).
With the exception of one NRAS Q61R mutation, these tumors
lacked point or indel mutations in known melanoma driver genes
(Fig. 1), suggesting a distinct clinical entity or an alternative path
to melanoma development. While most equine melanomas are
thought to be indolent, some do metastasize28 and follow-up
studies to correlate mutation profiles with tumor behavior are
warranted.
Analysis of mutated genes within and between species. Fol-
lowing the analysis of established melanoma genes, we proceeded
to explore the catalog of mutated genes in each species. In human
mucosal melanoma the most notable novel recurrently mutated
gene was the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked
(ATRX) gene, which carried three frameshift variants and two
missense variants (Fig. 1) in five-independent cases (11% of the
total). Mutations in ATRX have been linked to alternative telo-
mere lengthening in a range of tumor types29,30. Notably, telo-
mere dysregulation has been shown to play an important role in
cutaneous melanoma through the identification of genes such as
POT131 and mutations in the promoter of TERT32. Importantly,
ATRX mutations were found to co-occur with TP53 mutations (4
of 5 cases; Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.006). The association of ATRX
and TP53 mutations has been noted in other cancers, particularly
gliomas, and has been associated with an altered differentiation
status33. We also observed a PTPRJ truncating mutation and two
missense mutations, notable because of the aforementioned
truncating PTPRJ mutations in canine oral melanomas26 (Fig. 2).
Similarly, mutations in BRCA2 were also found in human and
canine cases, but not equine cases.
In addition to mutations in established melanoma genes
described above, 2 canine cases were also found to harbor
mutations (G9V and R13C) in the highly conserved N-terminal
region of the EIF1AX protein (Fig. 1), an essential translation
initiation factor that is known to be mutated in human uveal
melanoma34, meningeal melanocytic tumors35 and other cancers.
Indeed, the same amino acid substitutions at conserved sites G9
and
R13
have
been
found
in
multiple
human
tumors
(COSM6908971,
COSM5899335),
along
with
several
other
recurrent mutations in the N-terminal region, which are
predicted to be activating36. This conservation strongly suggests
that the same mutations in the canine cases play a functional role
in these cancers.
In equine melanoma cases from mucosal-like or mucocuta-
neous sites, the landscape of driver genes was less populated than
the other species (Fig. 1), and there were fewer recurrently
mutated genes in common with human or canine cases (Fig. 2).
In addition to NRAS and TP53, which were mutated in all
3 species as described above, PTEN was disrupted by nonsense or
frameshift mutations in all species, suggesting a key role for PI3K
signaling in the genesis of these melanomas. Mutations in RB1
and FAT3 were found only in canine and equine cases.
In an attempt to identify potential new drivers, we examined
the most frequently mutated genes in samples from 2 or more
species (Fig. 2), noting genes such as STAT3 and TCF7L1 that
were mutated in all species, suggesting a potential role in disease
development. Mutations in FAT4 were also seen across species,
however, the FAT4 mutations in the equine samples only
occurred in two samples from the vulva (HD0021a) and third
eyelid (HD0032a), both of which had a high mutation rate and

 UV mutation signature. FAT4 has previously been suggested to be
a somatically mutated cutaneous melanoma driver gene37. All
annotated canine and equine genes in Fig. 2 have a one-to-one
orthology relationship with the corresponding human gene, with
the exception of DNAH5 (Supplementary Data 3).
Analysis of somatic copy number alterations. We next analysed
the copy number profiles of human, canine, and equine mela-
nomas. The frequencies of SCNAs in each species cohort is
shown in Fig. 3. As reported previously38,39, human mucosal
melanomas and canine oral melanomas harbor extensive
SCNAs. Representative copy number profiles of individual
samples from each species are shown in Fig. 4. We identified
recurrent large and whole-chromosome gains and losses in
human mucosal melanoma that mirrored the copy number
landscape reported previously using array-based comparative
genome hybridization (aCGH)38, including recurrent gains of
1q, 6p, 8q, 7, and loss of 6q and 10 (Fig. 3a). Similarly, our
canine oral melanomas showed substantial chromosomal gains
and losses, most notably, recurrent gains of chromosomes 13
and 17, and losses of chromosomes 2 and 22 (Fig. 3b), which
have all been reported previously in canine oral melanoma using
aCGH39. We also observed a recurrent distinctive complex gain/
loss region on chromosome 30, which was previously seen in
canine oral melanoma but not in canine cutaneous melanoma39.
In contrast to human and canine mucosal melanomas, equine
melanomas from mucocutaneous/mucosal-like sites had far
fewer SCNAs. However, we did observe recurrent whole-
chromosome gain of chromosome 25 and loss of chromosome
31, which have not been reported previously, in 50% and 31% of
cases, respectively (Fig. 3c). All samples with a copy number loss
of chromosome 31 also had a copy number gain of chromosome
25, and the majority of these were perineal or preputial
melanomas. This pattern was infrequent in equine cutaneous
melanomas, as only 6% of the samples had a loss of chromo-
some 31 and 3% had a gain of chromosome 25 (Fig. 3c).

Fig. 2 Comparative mutational landscape of primary melanomas from human, canine, and equine patients. Shown are the most frequently mutated genes in
at least 2 of the 3 species. For genes commonly mutated in human and canine samples only, genes displayed were mutated in at least 5 samples in total,

a high mutation rate and a UV mutation signature, and samples not classified as originating from mucocutaneous or mucosal-like sites; these samples,
indicated as “All other tumors”, are shown for comparative purposes. Details of tumor site and type are the same as described in Fig. 1. Dagger, The gene

 Candidate driver genes on these chromosomes include NOTCH1
on chromosome 25 and ARID1B on chromosome 31. For visual
comparison of copy number frequency profiles relative to
human mucosal melanoma, we mapped the frequency of gain
and loss in orthologous regions in the canine and equine gen-
omes to the human reference genome (see Methods and Sup-
plementary Fig. 3). Several shared recurrent copy number
alterations can be visualized, including a focal deletion on
chromosome 15 (human and canine), amplification of the distal
end of chromosome 8 (human and canine), partial deletion of
12q (human, canine and equine), and deletion of the distal end
of chromosome 6 (human and equine). A detailed cross-species
examination of syntenic regions and significant copy number
alterations, including these regions, is discussed below.
Cross-species comparative copy number analysis. Cancers fre-
quently harbor SCNAs, the majority of which are likely to be
passenger events. To identify candidate driver events and genes,
we focused on syntenic regions between species where recurrent
copy number changes were observed in both species and in the
same direction. We used two approaches, first comparing larger
SCNAs with a minimal frequency cutoff, and second, using sta-
tistical approaches to find significant focal aberrations.
For the first approach, we selected for comparison chromosomes
(canine and equine) or chromosome arms (human) where the
median frequency of copy number change across the chromosome/
arm was at least 0.2 (Supplementary Data 4). Figure 5 shows regions
of synteny in these chromosomes/arms, and the location of
established and candidate melanoma genes that fall within these
regions. The majority of the cross-species recurrent SCNAs are not
shared with equine mucosal-like/mucocutaneous melanoma, which
had significantly fewer recurrent SCNAs. Of note, however, there is
synteny between equine chromosome 31 and the distal end of
human chromosome 6, both of which are recurrently deleted, where
ARID1B is located in each genome. Equine chromosome 25, where
PPP6C and NOTCH1 are located, is syntenic with the distal end of
human chromosome 9, however, the recurrent copy number
changes in these regions are in the opposite direction. MYC is
located on syntenic regions in human 8q and canine chromosome
13, both of which are frequently amplified (Fig. 5). Amplification of
MYC has previously been associated with advanced cutaneous
melanoma40.
In the second approach, GISTIC 2.041 and STAC42 were used
to identify significant focal aberrations in each species, which
were then compared (see Methods and Supplementary Data 5
and 6). In this way, we identified several genes found in the
Cancer Gene Census (CGC) catalog that were focally amplified
or deleted in both human and canine mucosal melanoma
(Table 1 and Fig. 5). The most significant deletion from the
GISTIC 2.0 analysis of human mucosal melanoma was a deletion
at 15q15.1 (adjusted P-value = 0.009) (Supplementary Data 5), a
region with synteny to a significant deletion (STAC footprint-
based P-value = 0.04) on canine chromosome 30 spanning
positions 2–12 Mb (Supplementary Data 6). Within these
regions, in both species, are the genes BUB1B, KNSTRN, and
B2M. B2M is frequently altered in human tumors and plays a
pivotal role in immune evasion43, and both KNSTRN and BUB1B
are involved in chromosome segregation27,44. The conserved
copy number alteration of these genes suggests they represent
strong candidate driver genes. This region also contains SPRED1,
a gene recently shown to be a mucosal melanoma driver45. We
note that Poorman et al.39 previously identified a significant focal
deletion at ~7.2–7.7 Mb (relative to CanFam3.1) on chromosome

 30 in canine oral melanomas; this smaller region contains
KNSTRN and BUB1B but not B2M. In the equine genome, these
genes are located in a syntenic region on chromosome 1 (Fig. 5)
where no recurrent SCNA was observed. However, as noted
above, missense mutations in KNSTRN were observed in 2
mucosal-like and 1 cutaneous equine sample.
Cross-species comparison of regions with significant copy
number gain revealed that the mouse double minute 2 homolog
(MDM2) gene is focally amplified in human and canine mucosal
melanomas (Table 1). MDM2 is a well-established oncogene in
human cutaneous melanoma and functions to antagonize the
activity of TP5346. Also of note, was the amplification of SMO.
SMO is a well-established oncogene in a range of cancers
including medulloblastoma47 and its amplification in both
human and canine mucosal cases suggests a functional role in
tumorigenesis (Table 1). The orthology relationships of genes
shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5 are listed in Supplementary Data 3.
The conserved partial deletion on human 12q, described above,
maps to syntenic regions on equine chromosome 28 and canine
chromosomes 10 and 15 that contain Cancer Gene Census genes
BTG1, CHST11, and USP44. However, no significant focal
deletions of these regions were identified by STAC analysis.
Comparison of primaries to metastatic and recurrent tumors.
Little is known about tumor heterogeneity when it comes to
mucosal melanoma. To address this question, we sequenced eight
metastatic human mucosal melanomas from seven cases (1 dis-
tant, 7 locoregional), which were paired with primary tumors
included in the analyses described above (Supplementary Data 1).
We sequenced an additional 3 locoregional recurrences that had
developed at the primary site following surgical removal of the
primary, and for two of the cases above with primary and mat-
ched metastases, we also sequenced locoregional recurrences. In
addition, we sequenced six metastatic canine oral melanomas (all
distant metastases) from five patients (Supplementary Data 1).
Somatic mutations in the recurrences and metastases were
identified relative to the matched normal samples, and compared
to mutations in their corresponding matched primary sample.
(Fig. 6). The greatest overlap of somatic mutations in a metastasis
was 59% for human cases (median 42%), and 71% for canine
cases (median 44%). This suggests that there is either significant
heterogeneity in the primary tumor or evolution of the metastasis
once it has left the primary site. In support of the heterogeneity
model, recurrences shared as many mutations with primaries as
metastases (23–61%; median 34%), suggesting that mucosal

 melanomas from both humans and dogs are composed of mul-
tiple subclones. This supports the notion that after tumor
initiation there is appreciable evolution of the primary tumor48,
which may potentially confound attempts at disease manage-
ment. This question should be explored further with ultra high-
depth sequencing of multiple tumor regions.
Analysis of sequence data for pathogenic germline variants. In
addition to our analysis of somatic mutations, we also looked for
pathogenic germline variants in established human melanoma
susceptibility genes49, including CDKN2A, BAP1, POT1 and
TP53, and their orthologs in the canine and equine genomes. In

Fig. 5 Cross-species comparison of somatic copy number alterations in melanoma. Equine cases used were from mucosal-like or mucocutaneous
sites. Chromosomes are represented by the outer track. Genes shown are established or candidate melanoma genes. The histogram shows the frequencies
of copy number (CN) gains (blue, purple, green) and losses (red, orange, yellow) in each species. The blue ribbons indicate regions of synteny on canine
chromosomes and human chromosome arms that have a median frequency of CN gain of at least 0.2 in both species. Similarly, the orange and yellow
ribbons indicate syntenic regions on canine and human chromosomes/arms, and on equine and human chromosomes/arms, respectively, with a median
frequency of CN loss of at least 0.2 in both species. Gray ribbons show syntenic regions where the frequency of CN gain or loss was below 0.2. Genes
shown in blue or red with an asterisk (*) are located within a significant focal CN gain or loss, respectively. The remaining genes in blue or red are located
on chromosomes/arms in syntenic regions linked by blue or orange/yellow ribbons, respectively. ^CCND1 is on human chromosome 11, which had a
frequency of CN loss>0.2, however, this gene is in focally amplified region from GISTIC 2.0 analysis with q-value = 0.11 (Supplementary Data 5)

 samples sequenced, PD25652b/e/f) with a pathogenic complex
TP53 mutation (11 bp deletion + 5 bp insertion; ClinVar ID:
12381) which is in keeping with a previous case report outlining
the development of mucosal melanoma in a Li Fraumeni syn-
drome patient (Table 2)50. No known pathogenic or risk factor
variants (as described in the ClinVar database), or deleterious
substitutions (defined by a SIFT score <= 0.05) were identified in
CDKN2A or BAP1, while a single case (PD25655b) carried a
POT1 Q539H variant which has not been reported previously in
the ClinVar database but is present in dbSNP (rs973319258) and
the gnomAD database with a population variant allele frequency
(VAF) of 1.6 × 10−5. This variant is predicted to be deleterious
(SIFT score = 0.05). Extending our search for pathogenic var-
iants, risk factor variants and deleterious substitutions to all
genes, we identified patients with truncating loss-of-function
mutations in BRCA1 (E23fs; ClinVar ID: 17662; PD26992b) and
BRCA2 (L122fs; ClinVar ID: 51504; PD25663b) (Table 2), both of
which are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian
cancer. The BRCA1 E23fs (p.Glu23Valfs) mutation, also known
as 185delAG, is a founder mutation in Ashkenazi Jews51,52. Prior
to our study, BRCA1 and BRCA2 have not been associated with
mucosal melanoma and thus we extend the list of genes linked to
this disease. Since tumors developing in BRCA1 and BRCA2
patients may be sensitive to treatment with PARP inhibitors53, a
germline analysis of patients presenting with mucosal melanoma,
particularly if their pedigree also contains cases of breast and
ovarian cancer, may be warranted. Another interesting observa-
tion was a single patient with a pathogenic MUTYH Y176C
variant (ClinVar ID: 5293). MUTYH variants have not been
linked to melanoma previously and although MUTYH is gen-
erally considered a recessive tumor suppressor gene it is known
that individuals heterozygous for disruptive MUTYH alleles are at
greater risk of developing a range of cancers54. Finally, we noted a
patient with a pathogenic CHEK2 mutation (p.S471F; also known
as p.S428F; ClinVar ID: 5603) which has been linked to a range of
cancers and is also thought to be an Ashkenazi founder allele55.
Thus, we have observed an intriguing concentration of patho-
genic germline alleles in this cohort with disruptive mutations
found in TP53, POT1, BRCA1, BRCA2, MUTYH and CHEK2.
None of the canine or equine cases in our study carried
potentially pathogenic (SIFT score <= 0.05) germline mutations
in the abovementioned genes, with the exception of 2 equine
cases with MUTYH L241V mutations (SIFT score = 0.01), that
developed melanoma on the prepuce (HD0024a) and ventral
neck (HD0026a). We have also reported the presence of the gray
phenotype, caused by a germline intronic duplication in STX17
that activates the MAPK pathway56, and the 11 bp ASIP exon 2
deletion (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1), both previously
linked to the regulation of coat coloration and a higher incidence
of melanoma in horses56.
Identification of actionable mutations in mucosal melanoma.
Our catalog of driver mutations revealed several actionable
mutations. These included activating mutations in the MAPK
pathway (NRAS, BRAF, NF1, and KRAS) which could be targeted
using drugs such as trametinib (Fig. 1)57. In all species, we also
observed mutations in the PI3K pathway including loss-of-
function mutations in PTEN, potentially targetable using PI3K
inhibitors. In human and canine samples, and two equine sam-
ples from mucosal-like sites with a UV mutation signature, we
found somatic mutations in BRCA2, which might suggest that
these tumors would respond to PARP inhibitors. Similarly,
germline mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified in
human patients in our study. Importantly, in human and canine
mucosal cases we also found recurrent amplifications of SMO,
which can be inhibited using several compounds, including
Glasdegib, which has recently been approved by the
United
States Food and Drug Administration. Finally, we note the pre-
sence of somatic mutations in other genes for which small
molecular inhibitors have been developed, such as ROS1. Follow-
up functional studies will be required to determine how tumors
respond to these agents.

 Discussion
Here we sequenced the exomes of human mucosal, canine oral,
and mucosal-like/mucocutaneous equine melanomas and per-
formed a cross-species comparative genomic analysis. We iden-
tified similarities and differences in the mutation profiles, both in
terms of the mutated driver genes but also in terms of mutation
number, which are likely to influence tumor behavior and
response to treatments. Further, we reveal divergent DNA copy
number profiles, with human and canine mucosal melanomas
showing substantial copy number gains and losses, while equine
cases appeared to have comparatively fewer copy number chan-
ges. Importantly, we identified recurrent SNCAs and, using a
cross-species comparative analysis, were able to further refine the
loci that may functionally contribute to disease development. Our
cross-species analysis of human and canine melanomas is parti-
cularly important since canine patients are used as spontaneous
models of human mucosal melanoma, and while we found many
similarities, such as mutations in NRAS, TP53, and NF1, the
genomes of canine melanomas lacked mutations in other key
human mucosal melanoma drivers, such as SF3B1 and ATRX.
Thus, dogs may not represent a faithful genetic model for these
sub-types of human mucosal melanoma. In this study, we aimed
to compare tumors of mucosal origin between species. It is
notable that in humans, other forms of melanomas, such as acral
lentiginous melanoma6, may form on sun-shielded skin and
the mutation profiles we describe for canine oral and horse
mucosal-like/mucocutaneous melanoma bear some similarities to
these diseases. Similarly, we show that in horse, melanomas from
in or around mucosal sites appear to be different from melano-
mas from sun exposed cutaneous sites, where the latter may show
some similarities to melanocytoma58. Collectively, our study
details the genetic differences and similarities between mucosal
melanoma from human, dog, and melanomas from horses and
should help inform studies into the biology of this disease.
Methods
Samples and DNA extraction. For our human cohort, we collected 122 samples
total from various tissues (36 primary and matched normal pairs; 10 sets of
recurrent and/or metastatic tumors with 1 or more matched normal samples; 5
metastatic and matched normal pairs; 1 recurrence and matched normal pair). We
also collected 136 canine samples (60 primary and matched normal pairs, 4 trios of
primary, matched normal and metastatic samples, and 1 set of primary, matched
normal, and two metastatic samples) and 124 equine samples (62 primary and
matched normal pairs). Metastases included both distant and locoregional
metastases, the former defined as tumors forming outside the lymphatic drainage
region. Human mucosal melanoma cases were obtained from three clinical centers
(University of Michigan, University of Edinburgh and University of California, San
Francisco) and were reviewed by specialist dermatopathologists. All cases were
ethically approved for this study by local Institutional Review Boards and by the
Sanger Institute’s human materials and data management committee. The equine
melanomas were acquired from four large veterinary pathology practices (Ross-
dales Equine Hospital, the Animal Health Laboratory and the Department of
Pathobiology at the University of Guelph, University of Edinburgh and University
of Cambridge) and were reviewed by a team of medical and veterinary pathologists.

 Pathobiology at the University of Guelph and the University of Edinburgh) were
reviewed by three-independent veterinary pathologists. Equine melanoma cases
were further classified as originating from mucocutaneous or mucosal-like sites, the
most common being from the prepuce and perineum, or cutaneous sites (see
“Classification of equine tumors” below). The cases from mucosal-like or muco-
cutaneous sites were used for comparison to the human and canine melanomas,
while the equine cutaneous melanomas were primarily used as a comparator to the
equine mucosal-like and mucocutaneous melanomas. All samples and clinical
details are listed in Supplementary Data 1. All samples were obtained as paraffin-
embedded tissue cores, and DNA was extracted with the QIAamp FFPE Tissue kit
from Qiagen, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Classification of equine tumors. In order to compare equine melanomas to the
human mucosal and canine oral melanomas, we classified the equine tumors as
cutaneous (tumors arising on haired skin only), mucocutaneous (tumors near the
eyes or mouth that are in both mucosa and haired skin), and mucosal-like (tumors
arising on the perineum, perianal region, prepuce, vulva, or ventral tail). Two
tumors, from urinary bladder wall muscle and the parotid gland, did not fall into
any of these 3 categories, and were classified as ‘other’. Samples and their classi-
fications are listed in Supplementary Data 1.
Sequencing and variant calling. Exome capture was performed using custom
designed and Agilent SureSelect baits as described in the Results. Paired-end
sequencing was performed using the Illumia HiSeq platform at the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute to generate 75 bp reads. Sequencing reads were aligned using
BWA-MEM (v0.7.12)59 to reference genomes GRCh38, CanFam3.1, and Equ-
Cab2.0 for human, canine, and equine samples, respectively. PCR duplicates,
secondary read alignments, and reads that failed Illumina chastity (purity) filtering
were flagged and removed prior to running variant and copy number calling. Also
removed were read pairs where one read had the same sequence as another read,
but their mates had mapping quality 0 and mapped to different sites. These reads
appeared to be artefacts and frequently carried sequencing errors which con-
founded variant calling. The resulting sequencing coverage ranged from 25- to 115-
fold (median 81-fold) for the human samples, 34- to 124-fold (median 78-fold) for
the canine samples, and 24- to 131-fold (median 67-fold) for the equine samples.
MuTect (v1.1.7)18 and Strelka (v1.0.15)20 were used to call somatic SNVs and
indels, respectively. Germline variants were identified using the Genome Analysis
Tool Kit (v3.5) HaplotypeCaller followed by joint genotyping60. The minimum
base quality score for somatic and germline variant calling was set to Phred 30. The
list of SNVs from MuTect were input into MAC (v1.2)19 to identify multi-
nucleotide variants, such as UV-induced CC > TT substitutions. The Ensembl
Variant Effect Predictor61 was used to predict the effect of variants on genes and

 proteins, relative to Ensembl version 89 for human samples and Ensembl version
91 for canine and equine samples. To remove artefacts, MuTect variant calls were
removed if any of the following criteria were met: (1) total read depth at the
position <10 in the tumor; (2) the VAF < 0.05; (3) total number of reads with the
variant allele ≤5 in the tumor, and VAF < 0.15; (4) total read depth in the tumor
<20 and VAF < 0.2; (5) the matched normal sample had 3 or more reads with the
variant base. Variant calls were also removed if the variant base was observed in 3
or more unrelated normal samples or tumor samples in which a somatic variant
call was not made. Human variant calls found in the ExAc or gnomAD databases62
were removed if the population variant allele frequency was greater than 0.01.
Known common germline variant calls found in canine dbSNP version 151,
DogSD63 and a cohort of 505 recently sequenced dogs were removed from the list
of canine somatic variant calls. For the equine somatic variant call set, variants
found in dbSNP 151 were removed. The alignments for all variants reported in
Table 2, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 were visually inspected. In human, dog, and horse
samples, variants found in MECOM, KDM3B, and BAP1, respectively, were
removed as they appeared to be artefactual calls due to alignment of contaminating
cDNA reads.
Ethnicity analysis. To infer the ancestry of mucosal melanoma patients, germline
variant calls from these individuals were intersected with variants from 1092
individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase I (1KGP)64. Variants taken
forward for principal component analysis (PCA) included high quality variants in
the melanoma cohort (as described above) that were also found in 1KGP at a
minor SNP allele frequency >= 0.05, that were not in linkage disequilibrium with
another SNP (pairwise R2 < 0.02), and that did not have a missing rate >0.05. After
filtering, 5804 SNPs remained that were spread across all autosomes. The first ten
principal components were estimated using all individuals together. All analyses
were carried out with the SNPRelate R package65.
Extraction of mutational signatures. The SomaticSignatures R package66 was
used to extract mutational signatures from species cohorts and determine the
proportion of mutations in each sample attributable to specific signatures. To
identify signatures within each species cohort, samples within each species were
divided into 2 groups and mutations were pooled within each group. To maximize
the input available for the algorithm, all primary, recurrent and metastatic samples
were also included, if available, and all equine cutaneous samples and samples from
the urinary bladder wall muscle and parotid gland. The human samples were
grouped by primary tumor site (sinonasal and oral tumors in one group, anogenital
and vulvar in the other), and the equine samples were grouped by tumor type
(mucosal-like/mucocutanous in one group, and cutaneous, urinary bladder wall
muscle and the parotid gland tumors in the second group). Since the canine
samples were all oral melanomas, we arbitrarily grouped the samples into 2 groups
(35 and 36 samples) to perform a signature analysis for the canine cohort. In the
human cohort, the optimal solution contained 3 signatures, which were compared
to the 30 COSMIC signatures identified by Alexandrov et al67 using cosine simi-
larity. Two of the extracted signatures corresponded to signature 7 (cosine simi-
larity = 0.96), which is associated with UV light exposure, and signature 1 (cosine
similarity = 0.80), which is seen in all cancer types and associated with age. The
third signature only had weak cosine similarity to signatures 5 (cosine similarity =
0.74) and signature 30 (cosine similarity = 0.75), which we did not consider sig-
nificant matches. Signature 1 was extracted from the canine cohort (cosine simi-
larity = 0.87). Signature 7 was extracted from the both the mucosal and cutaneous
equine cohorts (cosine similarities = 0.96 and 0.94, respectively).
To assign mutation signatures to specific samples, SomaticSignatures was run
on species cohorts without pooling mutations. Only samples with at least 100
mutations were included, as those with fewer mutations would be uninformative.
In total, 11 human samples (including 8 primaries, 2 metastases, and 1 recurrence)
and 5 equine primaries were analysed. Only 1 canine sample had more than
100 somatic SNVs, therefore, mutational signature analysis was not applicable. As
with the pooling approach described above, a signature with highest cosine
similarity to signature 7 (0.88) was identified in the human cohort. Signatures with
highest similarity to signature 5 (0.79) and signature 1 (0.68) were identified,
however, using visual inspection of mutation profiles we were not able to determine
whether the extracted signatures truly represented signatures 1 and 5, due to the
sparseness of the data. Signature 7 (cosine similarity = 0.96) was identified in
5 samples in the equine cohort. Samples in which signature 7, a signature
associated with UV light exposure, comprised at least 50% of the total signature
contribution are indicated in Figs. 1 and 2.
Comparison of mutated pathways across tumor sites. To compare mutational
patterns across mucosal melanoma tumor sites, we used Subtyping Agglomerated
Mutations By Annotation Relations (SAMBAR)25. SAMBAR’s input is a matrix
containing the number of mutations in each gene and each sample. SAMBAR
normalizes the number of mutations to the gene’s length and de-sparsifies these
gene mutation scores into biological pathway mutation scores, which can be used
for subtyping analysis or to identify associations between mutational patterns and
phenotypic variables. For each human and equine gene, gene length was calculated
from the total coding sequence (CDS) length of the canonical transcript, as defined
by Ensembl release 89 for human genes and release 91 for equine genes. For the
analysis on equine samples, we only included genes with gene symbols and a one-
to-one homology to human. We used the binomial dissimilarity index on the
pathway mutation scores we obtained from SAMBAR to calculate distances
between samples within each species dataset. Next, we regressed the top five
principal components from the PCA on these distance matrices with each phe-
notypic variable. We adjusted the P-values of the regression for multiple testing
using Benjamini and Hochberg’s method across each variable and principal
component (Supplementary Fig. 2).
DNA somatic copy number alteration calling. Sequenza (v2.1.2)21 was used to
estimate tumor cellularity and ploidy from paired tumor-normal WES data, and
calculate allele-specific copy number profiles. For each sample, the best Sequenza
solution was chosen after visual inspection of both the best-fit solution (with the
maximum log posterior probability) and alternative solutions. We observed several
cases where all solutions provided estimates of cellularity that were less than 0.2.
Upon visual inspection, however, we discovered high log posterior probabilities for
alternate solutions with estimates of ploidy 2 and cellularities spanning 0–1. Based
on this, and our expectation that the tumors have minimal contamination from
normal tissue, we assigned a cellularity of 0.8 and ploidy 2 for the calculation of
copy number profiles for these samples. Samples with excessive noise and no
apparent optimal solution (16 human, 10 canine, 2 equine mucosal, and 1 equine
cutaneous) were excluded. Supplementary Data 4 lists the samples used for copy
number analysis. For the canine and equine samples, segments were further filtered
by removing segments with altered copy number if they were less than 5 Mb in size
and overlapped 5 or more reference genome assembly gaps larger than 1 kb.
Genomic regions near multiple assembly gaps tend to be repetitive in nature; both
gaps and repetitive sequence can result in spurious read mapping and, in turn,
incorrect copy number calls from Sequenza. As the human reference genome is
much more refined than the canine and equine genomes, this filtering was not
necessary for the human data.
Humanization of canine and equine copy number data. For visual comparison of
canine and equine mucosal melanoma copy number frequency profiles to that of
human, we used a method similar to Poorman et al.39 to identify orthologous
regions. Genome coordinates of the 60-mer oligo probes from the Agilent Sur-
ePrint G3 Human CGH 4x180 Microarray (provided relative to reference genome
hg18/GRCh36) were mapped to the human reference genome GRCh38 using the
liftOver utility. The frequency of copy number gains and losses of each re-mapped
region was then plotted against the genomic position. Each probe region was then
mapped, using liftOver, to the orthologous region in CanFam3.1 to determine the
frequencies of gains and losses in the canine cohort, which were plotted relative to
GRCh38. This was repeated for the equine copy number data, by mapping the
human probe regions to EquCab2.0.
Cross-species comparative analysis of recurrent SCNAs. In each species, we
first identified whole chromosomes (canine and equine) and chromosome arms
(human) with recurrent SCNAs by calculating the median frequency of copy
number gains across chromosomes/arms using 1 Mb windows. This was repeated
for copy number losses. Chromosomes/arms with a minimum copy number fre-
quency 0.2 were used for cross-species analysis. Syntenic regions between the
human, canine, and equine genomes were retrieved from the Ensembl Compara
database68. The syntenic regions were overlapped with the chromosomes/arms
with recurrent gain or loss, and candidate and established melanoma genes within
these overlap regions were identified.
To identify significant focal SCNAs in the human melanoma cohort, we used
GISTIC 2.0 (v2.0.23)41 and STAC (v1.2)42. To transform the results from Sequenza
(described above) into GISTIC 2.0 input, segment chromosome, start and end
positions were used, and the segment log-scaled copy number ratio was calculated
as log2(2 × depth-ratio)−1. The optional markers file was not used and default
parameters were selected. Peaks with both q-value and residual q-value <0.05 were
selected as significant. For each significant wide peak region and region limit, genes
found in the Cancer Gene Census (CGC)69 catalog were identified. For STAC,
regions of copy number gain and loss from Sequenza were formatted separately in
‘location’ format using 1 Mb spans. Each chromosome arm was analysed
separately. A region with a minimum copy number frequency of 0.2 and a
frequency-based P-value <0.05 or footprint-based P-value <0.05 was considered
significant. Because the current release of the GISTIC 2.0 pipeline was designed for
the analysis of human cancers, we used STAC for the analysis of SCNAs in canine
and equine mucosal melanoma, as the algorithm is not species-specific. Whole
chromosomes were analysed individually. The same input format and filtering
used for human SCNAs were applied. For each significant region, CGC genes
were identified. Samples included in GISTIC 2.0 and STAC analysis are listed
in Supplementary Data 4, excluding the equine samples listed as “cutaneous
and other”.
For the human cohort, each significant region with a CGC gene was compared
to syntenic regions with significant gain or loss in the canine and equine genomes
in order to identify amplified or deleted genes common to human and canine

equine SCNAs.
Comparison of primary tumors with metastases and recurrences. Somatic
mutations were called in each primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumors, as
described above, using a matched normal as the reference sample in each case. The
somatic mutations in the primary tumors were then compared to those in the
metastatic and recurrent tumors to determine the number of shared and private
mutations.
