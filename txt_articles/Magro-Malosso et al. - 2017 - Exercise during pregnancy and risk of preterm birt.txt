Abstract
Introduction. The incidence of overweight and obesity in pregnancy has risen
significantly in the last decades. Overweight and obesity have been shown to
increase the risk for some adverse obstetric outcomes. Lifestyle interventions,
such as diet, physical activity and behavior changes, may reduce these risks by
promoting weight loss and/or preventing excessive weight gain. The possible
impact of exercise on the risk of preterm birth (PTB) in overweight or obese
women is controversial. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the
effect of exercise on the risk of PTB in overweight or obese pregnant women.
Material

methods. MEDLINE,

Scopus,
ClinicalTrial.gov, OVID and Cochrane Library were searched from their
inception to November 2016. This meta-analysis included only randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) of pregnant women assigned or not assigned before
25 weeks to an aerobic exercise regimen. Types of participants included
overweight or obese (mean body mass index ≥25 kg/m2) women with singleton
pregnancies without any contraindication to physical activity. The summary
measures were reported as relative risk (RR) or as mean difference (MD) with
95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcome was the incidence of PTB
<37 weeks. Results. Nine trials including 1502 overweight or obese singleton
gestations were analyzed. Overweight and obese women who were randomized
in early pregnancy to aerobic exercise for about 30–60 min three to seven
times per week had a lower percentage of PTB <37 weeks (RR 0.62, 95% CI
0.41–0.95) compared with controls. The incidence of gestational age at delivery
(MD 0.09 week, 95% CI �0.18 to 0.24) and cesarean delivery (RR 0.93, 95%
CI 0.77–1.10) were similar in both groups. Women in the exercise group had a
lower incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41–0.90)
compared with controls. No differences in birthweight (MD 16.91 g, 95% CI
�89.33 to 123.19), low birthweight (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.25–1.34), macrosomia
(RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72–1.18) and stillbirth (RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.22–20.4)
between the exercise group and controls were found. Conclusions. Overweight
and obese women with singleton pregnancy can be counseled that, compared
with being more sedentary, aerobic exercise for about 30–60 min three to
seven times per week during pregnancy is associated with a reduction in the
incidence of PTB. Aerobic exercise in overweight and obese pregnant women is
also associated with a significant prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus,
and should therefore be encouraged.

Introduction
The incidence of overweight and obesity has risen signifi-
cantly in the last decades. Approximately one in four
women are overweight after childbirth and one in five is
obese before pregnancy (1). Overweight and obesity have
been shown to increase the risk for adverse obstetric out-
come. Maternal complications correlated with high body
mass index (BMI) values are gestational hypertension,
preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and cesarean delivery
(2). Weight status before and during pregnancy, also has
consequences for fetal outcomes, such as macrosomia,
shoulder dystocia, congenital anomalies and stillbirth (3,4).
Lifestyle interventions, including diet, exercise and behav-
ior changes, may reduce these risks by promoting weight
loss or preventing weight gain. Being overweight or obese
has been associated with preterm birth (PTB) in some stud-
ies (3), whereas other studies do not support this (5). An
even more controversial association is between exercise and
risk of PTB in overweight and obese pregnant women.
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis
was to evaluate the effect of exercise on the risk of PTB
in overweight and obese pregnant women.
Material and methods
Eligibility criteria
This meta-analysis was performed according to a protocol
recommended for systematic review (6). The review pro-
tocol was designed a priori defining methods for collect-
ing, extracting and analyzing data. The research was
conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Sciences,
Scopus, ClinicalTrial.gov, OVID and Cochrane Library as
electronic databases. The trials were identified with the
use of a combination of the following text words: “exer-
cise” or “physical activity” and “high risk pregnancy” and
“overweight” and “obese” and “preterm birth” or “pre-
term delivery” and “randomized trial” as publication
type, from the inception of each database to November
2016. Review of articles also included the abstracts of all
references retrieved from the search.
Study selection
Selection criteria included only randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) of overweight or obese pregnant women random-
ized to an exercise regimen or not. We included only
RCTs reporting PTB as an outcome in overweight and/or
obese pregnant women. Types of participants included
women with a mean BMI ≥25 kg/m2, singleton pregnan-
cies without any obstetric contraindication to physical
activity. In all the trials, the intervention group partici-
pated in planned aerobic exercise. In the control group,
women did not participate in exercise sessions and only
attended regular scheduled obstetric visits. RCTs includ-
ing women with a mean BMI ≤24.9 kg/m2 were excluded.
Only data on women with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 were analyzed.
RCTs including only diet, counseling and/or weight mon-
itoring and those only in at-risk populations (for example
all women were smokers) were excluded. Quasi-rando-
mized trials (i.e. trials in which allocation was done on
the basis of a pseudo-random sequence, such as odd/even
hospital number or date of birth, alternation) were also
excluded.
Risk of bias
The risk of bias in each included study was assessed using
the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic
Reviews
of
Interventions
(6).
Seven
domains
related to risk of bias were assessed in each included trial,
since there is evidence that these issues are associated
with biased estimates of treatment effect: (i) random
sequence generation; (ii) allocation concealment; (iii)
blinding of participants and personnel; (iv) blinding of
outcome assessment; (v) incomplete outcome data; (vi)
selective reporting and (vii) other bias. Review authors’
judgments were categorized as “low risk,” “high risk” or
“unclear risk” of bias (6).
Data extraction and outcomes
All
analyses
were
done
using
an
intention-to-treat
approach, evaluating women according to the treatment
group to which they were randomly allocated in the orig-
inal trials. The primary outcome was the incidence of
PTB at <37 weeks. Secondary outcomes were gestational
age at delivery, incidence of cesarean delivery, gestational
diabetes and neonatal outcomes including birthweight,
Key Message

 low birthweight (i.e. birthweight <2500 g), macrosomia
(i.e. birthweight >4000 g), and stillbirth. We assessed the
primary outcome also in subgroup analysis according to
intervention protocol.
Data analysis
Data analysis was completed using REVIEW MANAGER
5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Center, Cochrane
Collaboration, 2014) (6). Statistical heterogeneity between
studies was assessed using Higgins I2 statistics. In case of
statistical significant heterogeneity (I2 ≥ 50%), the random
effects model of DerSimonian and Laird was used to
obtain the pooled risk ratio estimate; otherwise (I2 < 50%)
a fixed effect models was used (6). The summary measures
were reported as relative risk (RR) or as mean difference
(MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
The meta-analysis was reported following the Preferred
Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
(PRISMA) statement (7). Before data extraction, the
review was registered with the PROSPERO International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration
number: CRD42016039065).
Two authors (E.M.M., G.S.) independently assessed
inclusion criteria, risk of bias, data extraction and data
analysis. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with
a third reviewer (VB). Data from each eligible study were
extracted without modification of original data onto cus-
tom-made
data
collection
forms.
Differences
were
reviewed, and further resolved by common review of the
entire process. Data not presented in the original publica-
tions were requested from the principal investigators.
Results
Study selection and study characteristics
Figure 1 shows the flow diagram (PRISMA template) of
information derived from review of potentially relevant
articles (8–17). Nine RCTs, including 1502 overweight
and obese women with singleton pregnancy were included
in the meta-analysis (8–10,12–17). One study (11) was
excluded since it was a follow-up study of another
included trial (10).
For all trials, only data for overweight or obese women
were able to be included.
The quality of RCTs included in our meta-analysis was
assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool (7).
All the included studies used had low risk of bias in
“random sequence generation” and “incomplete outcome
data.” High risk of reporting bias was not found in any
of the included trials. No method of blinding as to the
group allocation was reported (Figure 2).
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the nine included
trials.

three studies (9,14,15) included both overweight to obese,
and in two studies (13,17) women were stratified by BMI
categories. Gestational age at randomization was in the
first trimester for all studies except in three RCT (8,9,16)
in which women were randomized only or also during
the second trimester. The intervention program included
aerobic exercise and dietary counseling in five RCTs

Exercise in obese pregnant women
 by a dietitian in one study (15) and only aerobic exercise
in three studies (8,14,17). One trial (16), randomized
obese women in three groups: physical activity and diet-
ary intervention (group 1); physical activity intervention
(group 2); standard care (group 3). We included both
physical
activity
groups,
with
and
without
dietary
intervention, in the exercise group. Two studies (13,17)
included all BMI categories; all data of underweight
and
normal
weight
women
were
excluded
in
our
meta-analysis.
Table 2 shows inclusion and exclusion criteria in these
trials. Characteristics of the women included in the trials
(maternal age, parity, job, smoking habits, pre-pregnancy
BMI as mean and standard deviation for both overweight
and obese categories included, number and rate of over-
weight women, number and rate of obese women, prior
PTB) are reported in Table 3. All nine studies random-
ized overweight and/or obese women with singleton ges-
tations. Women were excluded in the case of any
obstetric contraindications to exercise, mostly as recom-
mended by ACOG (18). The intervention group partici-
pated in aerobic exercise consisting of a protocol of
exclusive walking session in three trials (14–16), an exclu-
sive light-intensity to moderate-intensity exercise in two
trials (10,13) and the two associated components in four
trials (8,9,12,17). The mean time of every session was
around 40 min (30–60 min), three times a week in four
trials (8,13,15,17), four times a week in one trials (12),
five times a week in two trials (9,14) and physical activity
was recommended daily in two trials (10,16). In the con-
trol group, women did not participate in exercise sessions
and only attended regular scheduled obstetric visits and
prenatal care advisory sessions.
Synthesis of results
Of the 1502 women included in the meta-analysis, 824
(55%) were randomized to the exercise group and 678
(45%) to the control group. The statistical heterogeneity
within the studies was low. Table 4 shows the pooled data
of primary and secondary outcomes of the meta-analysis.
Pregnant overweight or obese women who were random-
ized in early pregnancy to approximately 30–60 min of
aerobic exercise three to seven times per week until at
least week 35 or up to delivery had a lower percentage of
PTB <37 weeks (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41–0.95; Figure 3)
compared with controls. Gestational age at delivery (MD
0.09 week, 95% CI �0.18 to 0.24) and the incidence of

ences were found in birthweight (MD 16.91 g, 95% CI

sis according to intervention protocols.
Discussion
This meta-analysis of nine RCTs that included 1502
women, showed that aerobic exercise in overweight or
obese singleton pregnancies is associated with a reduced
risk of PTB. The mean gestational age at delivery and the
incidence of cesarean delivery are similar in women who
exercised regularly and controls. Women in the exercise
group have a significantly lower incidence of gestational
diabetes mellitus. There is no difference in birthweight,
low birthweight, macrosomia or stillbirth.
A recent Cochrane Review (19) evaluated the effect of
exercise during pregnancy, with or without diet interven-
tion, on the risk of PTB, and it included all BMI cate-
gories. The authors found no statistically significant
difference between intervention group and control group
with regard to PTB outcome. This Cochrane Review (19)
supports our findings of no effect of exercise during preg-
nancy on mode of delivery. In another meta-analysis, a
slight increase in the probability of vaginal delivery was
found only in healthy normal weight women performing
regular exercise during pregnancy (20). In our meta-

Exercise in obese pregnant women
 analysis the results suggest a protective effect of aerobic
exercise in developing gestational diabetes. Another prior
meta-analysis, which also included all BMI categories
without looking only at overweight or obese women,
found as well that exercise in pregnancy is associated with
a significant decrease in gestational diabetes mellitus (21).
Recently, Di Mascio et al. (22), in a meta-analysis includ-
ing 2059 women, showed that aerobic exercise can be
safely
performed
by
normal-weight
singletons
with
uncomplicated gestations because this was not associated
with an increased risk of preterm delivery but was associ-
ated with higher rate of vaginal delivery and lower inci-
dences of cesarean section, gestational diabetes mellitus
and hypertensive disorders.
Our study has several strengths. This meta-analysis
included all RCTs – nine – published so far on the topic.
To our knowledge, there are no other meta-analyses on
the issue of exercise in overweight or obese pregnant
women and risk of PTB. The studies in general were at
low risk of bias according to the Cochrane risk of bias
tools. The number of the included women – 1502 – was
high. The statistical heterogeneity within the studies was
low. These are key elements needed to evaluate the relia-
bility of a meta-analysis.
The main limitation of our study was that dietary
counseling or interventions were provided in addition to
exercise in some trials (Table 1). Another limitation of
this study is that individual trials differ in how they
define aerobic exercise, intensity of exercise and time of
exercise. Therefore, even if the statistical heterogeneity
within the trial was judged as low, the clinical heterogene-
ity was high. The most important confounding variables
were the dietary interventions, which were not described
in detail in the included studies, and which could have
profound effects on the outcomes and conclusions. The
different definition of aerobic exercise and the different
dietary interventions used are the major shortcoming of
our meta-analysis. Calculation of calories utilized with
the exercise regimen were not described by the original
trials. Moreover, one trial, although the mean BMI was
>25 kg/m2, might have included a small number of
women with BMI <25 kg/m2 (12). Finally, data on PTB
refer to both spontaneous and indicated preterm delivery.
We suggest overweight and obese women with single-
ton pregnancy can safely perform aerobic exercise for
about 30–60 min three to seven times per week during
pregnancy. Women can be counseled that, compared with
a more sedentary pregnancy, exercise during pregnancy is
associated with a reduced risk of PTB and is not associ-
ated with an effect on mean gestational age at delivery or
on incidence of cesarean delivery. Aerobic exercise in
overweight and obese pregnant women is also associated
with a significant prevention of gestational diabetes melli-
tus. During pregnancy, aerobic exercise is safe and benefi-
cial, and should therefore be encouraged.
