Background.
Patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) have a ≥60% risk of relapse, as conventional therapies
do not address the underlying gastrointestinal dysbiosis. This exploratory study evaluated the safety and efficacy of bacterial spores
for preventing recurrent CDI.
Methods.
Stool specimens from healthy donors were treated with ethanol to eliminate pathogens. The resulting spores were
fractionated and encapsulated for oral delivery as SER-109. Following their response to standard-of-care antibiotics, patients in co-
hort 1 were treated with SER-109 on 2 consecutive days (geometric mean dose, 1.7 × 109 spores), and those in cohort 2 were treated
on 1 day (geometric mean dose, 1.1 × 108 spores). The primary efficacy end point was absence of C. difficile–positive diarrhea during
an 8-week follow-up period. Microbiome alterations were assessed.
Results.
Thirty patients (median age, 66.5 years; 67% female) were enrolled, and 26 (86.7%) met the primary efficacy end point.
Three patients with early, self-limiting C. difficile–positive diarrhea did not require antibiotics and tested negative for C. difficile at 8
weeks; thus, 96.7% (29 of 30) achieved clinical resolution. In parallel, gut microbiota rapidly diversified, with durable engraftment of
spores and no outgrowth of non–spore-forming bacteria found after SER-109 treatment. Adverse events included mild diarrhea,
abdominal pain, and nausea.
Conclusions.
SER-109 successfully prevented CDI and had a favorable safety profile, supporting a novel microbiome-based
intervention as a potential therapy for recurrent CDI.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and its attendant complica-
tions, including diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and toxic
megacolon, are associated with an estimated 29 000 annual deaths
in the United States and is recognized by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention as an urgent public health priority [1].
Antibiotic exposure is the leading risk factor for CDI, and the
risk of recurrent disease is increased among elderly patients
and following antibiotic reexposure. Antibiotic therapy for recur-
rent CDI contributes to persistent disruption of the gut micro-
biome, which is the first-line defense against colonization and
infection by pathogens, including C. difficile [2–5].The risk of re-
currence increases to >60% following a second episode [3, 6, 7].
Research has focused on the potential role that the human mi-
crobiome plays in health and disease. In 2008, the National Insti-
tutes of Health supported the creation of the Human
Microbiome Project to characterize the species composition
and function of the healthy microbiome. In the gut, the 2 dom-
inant phyla are Firmicutes (ie, gram-positive organisms, includ-
ing Bacilli and Clostridia) and Bacteroidetes (ie, gram-negative
anaerobes, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella)
[8, 9]. In contrast, gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, such as Es-
cherichia coli, make up only a fraction of the healthy microbiome
[8]. There is also significant intersubject variability at both the
genus and species level, suggesting that the bacterial communities
in any one individual are unique, mirroring the complex inter-
play of diet, host genetics, immune response, and microbial co-
adaptation. Despite this variation, there are common core species
found in a majority of healthy individuals, and metabolic path-
ways are preserved due to functional redundancy [10]. Thus, a
wide range of microbiomes defines a healthy state.
In states of disease, there are also broad patterns that define gut
dysbiosis, such as a loss of microbial diversity and increasing

 representation of gram-negative facultative anaerobes, such as En-
terobacteriaceae [11, 12]. Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis underlies
colonization and invasion by C. difficile, while repair of the micro-
biome, through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), is associ-
ated with efficacy rates of 81%–90% for those with recurrent CDI
[13–16]. FMT involves transferring minimally processed, unchar-
acterized fecal material from a healthy donor to a recipient [17].
FMT administration is often invasive and requires donor
screening and stool preparation. Despite donor screening, stool
preparations for FMT have the potential to transmit infections
due to pathogens that are present at times outside the period of
detectability or for which diagnostic tests are unavailable; there
is also the possibility of unwitting transmission of emerging
pathogens that have not been identified to date [18, 19].
While there have been recent reports of stool delivered via
oral encapsulated FMT or stool enemas, the data demonstrate
first-dose efficacy of approximately 52%–70%, which is signifi-
cantly lower than that for other modes of administration, such
as colonoscopy [14, 20, 21]. In recognition of FMT as an exper-
imental biologic, the Food and Drug Administration issued
guidance that this intervention should only be used for preven-
tion of recurrent CDI and after receipt of informed consent. An
alternative approach for achieving improved safety and conve-
nience with comparable efficacy is urgently needed [22].
SER-109 is composed of approximately 50 species of Firmi-
cutes spores derived from stool specimens from healthy donors.
After demonstrating the preclinical efficacy of SER-109 in rodent
CDI models, we formulated it for oral delivery in humans based
on the hypothesis that spore-forming organisms would compete
metabolically with C. difficile for essential nutrients and/or bile
acids [23–27].In addition, spore purification with ethanol reduc-
es the risk of transmission of other potential pathogens [28]. This
initial study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety pro-
file of SER-109 for CDI prevention in patients with recurrent in-
fections and to measure alterations in the gut microbiota.
METHODS
Study Design
This open-label, single-arm, descending-dose study evaluated the
safety, efficacy, and engraftment of SER-109 formulated for oral
delivery. The study was sponsored by Seres Therapeutics and con-
ducted at 4 US medical centers: Massachusetts General Hospital
(Boston, Massachusetts), Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota),
Miriam Hospital (Providence, Rhode Island), and Emory Univer-
sity Hospital (Atlanta, Georgia). The protocol was developed by
investigators at Seres Therapeutics and authors of the current
study (E. L. H., D. S. P., and S. K.) and was approved by the insti-
tutional review boards of the participating medical centers.
Study Population
Eligible patients were 18–90 years old and had ≥3 laboratory-
confirmed CDI episodes in the previous 12 months, had a life
expectancy of ≥3 months, and gave informed consent to receive
this donor-derived product. Patients were excluded for a history
of acute leukemia; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, che-
motherapy within 2 months and an absolute neutrophil count
of <1000 neutrophils/mm3, a history of inflammatory or irrita-
ble bowel disease, colectomy, cirrhosis, pregnancy/lactation, se-
vere acute illness unrelated to CDI, antibiotic exposure for a
non-CDI indication within 14 days of screening, or prior FMT.
Eligible patients had a clinical response to antibiotic therapy
for their current CDI episode immediately prior to dosing and
were neither anticipated to require admission to an intensive
care unit nor expected to need antibiotics within 6 weeks
following study entry.
Screening of Donors
Seven adult donors of stool specimens gave informed consent,
underwent a complete medical history and laboratory assess-
ment, and were screened for blood-borne and fecal pathogens,
consistent with published protocols [29, 30]. Donors were ex-
cluded for being older than 50 years, having a body mass
index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by
the height in meters squared) of >25, engaging in high-risk be-
haviors as per a modified American Association of Blood Banks
blood donor questionnaire [31], having a history of acute/
chronic gastrointestinal disorders, or using antibiotics (in the
previous 6 months), immunosuppressive/antineoplastic agents,
or cigarettes (Supplementary Materials).
Preparation of SER-109
SER-109 comprises Firmicutes spores fractionated from stool
specimens obtained from healthy donors. Donor stool speci-
mens were processed separately to make unique batches of
SER-109. Upon collection, stool specimens were frozen at
−80°C. Approximately 150 g was suspended and homogenized
in normal saline and filtered through mesh screens. The slurry
was centrifuged, and supernatant containing bacterial cells and
spores was combined with 100% ethanol to 50% (wt/wt) and
incubated at room temperature for 1 hour to reduce risk of
pathogen transmission to the recipient [28]. The supernatant
was pelleted by centrifugation, washed with saline to remove
ethanol, resuspended with sterile glycerol, and filled into cap-
sules (hypromellose DRcaps, Capsugel), which were stored at
−80°C.
The product was characterized for spore concentration and
absence of residual gram-negative bacteria. Spore content was
determined by measuring the dipicolinic acid (DPA) content
and normalizing against the DPA content of known numbers
of spores representing 3 commensal species [32]. The absence
of residual gram-negative bacteria was confirmed by selective
plating on MacConkey lactose agar and Bacteroides bile esculin
agar. No vegetative microbes were found in any SER-109 prep-
aration within the limit of assay detection (<30 colony-forming
units/mL).

 Treatment Protocol
Two days prior to dosing, patients discontinued antibiotics for
CDI. One day prior to dosing, patients underwent a bowel prep-
aration (to minimize residual antibiotic in the gastrointestinal
tract), followed by overnight fasting. Two sites used a regimen
of 300 mL of magnesium-citrate (one with Dulcolax), and 2
sites used polyethylene glycol.
Part 1 enrolled 15 patients who each received 30 capsules of
SER-109 (observed dose of 15 capsules on day 0 and day 1). The
dose of spores varied between 3 × 107 and 2 × 1010, based on
natural variations in spore concentration among healthy do-
nors. Based on initial efficacy, 15 additional patients were en-
rolled in part 2 and treated with SER-109 capsules containing
a lower fixed dose of 1 × 108 spores (approximately 17-fold
lower than the geometric mean dose administered in part 1
and 3-fold above the minimum dose shown to be effective). De-
pending on spore content, patients received an observed dose of
1–12 capsules on day 0.
Any patient whose diarrhea recurred between 1 and 8 weeks
was eligible for another dose of SER-109, based on data from the
conventional FMT literature showing efficacy of a second dose
[13,14]. If a patient elected to receive a second dose of SER-109,
the time course of study events was restarted concurrent with
the second dose of SER-109.
Adverse events and recurrence of CDI symptoms were mon-
itored through phone calls (on day 4 and weeks 1, 2, and 4) and
in-clinic visits (on weeks 8 and 24). Patients were asked to pro-
vide a stool sample on day 4 and on weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 after
treatment for genomic and culture-based analysis.
Clinical Outcomes
The primary end point was prevention of recurrent CDI during
the 8-week follow-up after SER-109. CDI recurrence was de-
fined as a composite end point of >3 unformed bowel move-
ments in a 24-hour period and laboratory confirmation of C.
difficile in the stool. Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse
events and assessing changes in laboratory values, vital signs,
and physical examination findings over a 24-week period after
dosing.
Alterations in Gut Microbiota Composition
The impact of SER-109 on gut microbiota was determined by
examining stool samples before and after treatment for (1) en-
graftment by spore-forming species and (2) augmentation (out-
growth) of commensal bacteria not found in SER-109.
Alterations in composition were measured by 16S ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) genomic and culture-based analysis of patient
fecal samples (Supplementary Materials). Engraftment was de-
fined by newly detected spore formers in the patient after treat-
ment, which were present in SER-109 but not detectable in the
patient before treatment. Augmented bacteria were defined as
non–SER-109 organisms whose levels increased at least 10-
fold after treatment.
RESULTS
Patient Population
Thirty patients were enrolled after therapeutic response to
appropriate CDI antibiotics (ie, vancomycin [n = 23], fidaxo-
micin [n = 5], metronidazole [n = 1], and rifaximin [n = 1])
was documented (Table 1). Patients had a median age of
66.5 years (range, 22–88 years), and the majority of subjects
(67%) were female. The median time from the initial C. diffi-
cile diagnosis to the most recent recurrence was 23.1 weeks in
cohort 1 and 34.3 weeks in cohort 2. In the overall study pop-
ulation, the median number of CDI recurrences was 3 (range,
2–6 recurrences). Infecting C. difficile strains were identified
in 10 patients and included types BI, Y, and DH (Supplemen-
tary Table 1).
Complete blood counts and a chemistry panel (including liver
function tests and analysis of albumin and creatinine levels) were
performed at week 8 (for 27 of 30 patients) and at week 24 or
early termination for 20 of 30 patients. No significant changes
in laboratory findings were observed, with the exception of
those for 1 patient, who had an elevated white blood cell count
at week 8 at the time of diagnosis of a urinary tract infection.
Clinical Outcomes
Of the 30 patients who received SER-109, 26 (86.7%) achieved
the primary end point of no C. difficile–positive diarrhea up to
8 weeks following dosing, with similar outcomes in both dosing
cohorts (Figure 1). Of the patients who met the primary end
point, 1 required a second dose of SER-109 for recurrence of
C. difficile–positive diarrhea on day 26, as per protocol. Four pa-
tients who did not meet the primary end point had early onset of
symptoms at days 3, 5, 7, and 9 after administration of SER-109
and laboratory confirmation of C. difficile. One of these patients
declined a second SER-109 dose and chose not to continue
participating in the study. Notably, the other 3 patients were de-
termined by their primary investigator to be recovering from a

 self-limiting diarrheal episode at the time of stool submission for
C. difficile testing. In each case, the investigators advised the pa-
tients to refrain from antibiotic use, and all symptoms resolved
without any therapeutic intervention; stool samples from these
3 patients were negative for C. difficile carriage at 8 weeks,
using a sensitive nucleic acid amplification test for detection of
toxins A and B. Thus, 29 of 30 patients (96.7%) achieved clinical
resolution of recurrent CDI following SER-109 administration.
During the safety phase (weeks 8–24), 1 patient discontinued
the protocol for personal reasons, and 2 were lost to follow-up.
The clinical response to SER-109 was durable over the safety pe-
riod in 87% of the 23 patients who met the primary end point
and remained in the study. Of the 3 patients who relapsed dur-
ing the safety phase, one had received antibiotics for a non-CDI
indication. Four other patients who were also exposed to anti-
biotics did not have a CDI recurrence.
SER-109 Sequencing and Characterization
To characterize SER-109 by using 16S rRNA sequencing, sam-
ples were sequenced to a depth of 22 500 operational taxonomic
units (OTUs), at which point the rarefaction curves begin to
plateau. As defined by 16S rRNA analysis, the spore community
across all doses in this study comprised a mean (±SD) of ap-
proximately 50 ± 8 distinct OTUs.
Despite microbiome variation among the 7 donors, there was
broad conservation of SER-109 at the taxonomic family level. In
all 7 donors, the following families were detected by 16S se-
quencing: Clostridiaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Eubacteriaceae,
Lachnospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Ruminococca-
ceae. In 6 of 7 donors, the family Oscillospiraceae was
demonstrated.
Safety Profile
SER-109 was well tolerated, and all patients took their full dose,
with the exception of 1 patient. who did not take 1 capsule of the
planned dose. Adverse events were observed in 12 of 15 patients
(80%) in cohort 1 and 15 of 15 patients (100%) in cohort 2
(Table 2). Adverse events that were considered related to SER-
109 occurred in 15 of 30 patients (50%), all of which were mild
or moderate in severity and did not differ significantly by dosing
group. The most common adverse events were diarrhea
(n = 12), nausea (n = 9), and abdominal pain (n = 9). One severe
adverse event and 7 serious adverse events were deemed by the
investigators to be unrelated to the study drug (Table 2). There
were no deaths and no significant changes in laboratory values
(eg, glucose or lipid levels) or physical examination findings (eg,
BMI) over 24 weeks.
Remodeling of the Gut Microbiota
Microbial diversity increased significantly at 8 weeks (as mea-
sured by the mean Chao1 index [±SD]) from 24 ± 8 at baseline
to 31 ± 5 (P < .01; n = 24 paired samples). These changes were
rapid and durable, occurring as early as day 4 and detectable

 for up to 24 weeks, respectively (Figure 2A and Supplementary
Figure 1). At week 8, engrafted spore-forming bacteria from
SER-109 constituted, on average, 33% of the total gut microbial
carriage (Supplementary Figure 2). In addition, the augmented
non–SER-109 bacteria constituted, on average, 32% of the gut
microbiota. For example, Bacteroides and Parabacteroides,
dominant taxa in many healthy individuals [10],were augment-
ed in 11 of 29 patients by 38-fold–2 100 000-fold, including 6
patients who had undetectable levels in their pretreatment
specimen (Figure 3). In combination, engraftment and augmen-
tation led to a restructuring of the microbiome to a state more
closely reflective of healthy individuals (Figure 2B).
Restructuring of the microbiome was also observed within the
family Enterobacteriaceae, which contains both common com-
mensals and well-known pathogens (Figure 2C). For example,
Klebsiella species were detected at baseline in 29 patients, 22 of
whom harbored >1 species. However, after SER-109 administra-
tion, Klebsiella carriage decreased in 25 of 29 patients (92%) by
week 4, with 18 of 29 (62%) showing at least a 100 fold decline in
titer (Supplementary Table 2). As a consequence of this ecolog-
ical succession, in 19 of 27 patients (70%), E. coli became the
most abundant facultative gram-negative anaerobe (Figure 2D).
DISCUSSION
We report the use of a novel microbiome therapeutic, SER-109,
to prevent CDI recurrence in patients with a history of multiple
relapses. Per-protocol efficacy was observed in 26 of 30 patients
(86.7%) over 8 weeks of follow-up. In addition, 3 of 4 patients
who met the protocol definition of CDI recurrence had early
self-limiting diarrhea, as has been commonly described in the
literature [13, 34]. However, none of the 3 patients required an-
tibiotics, and all subsequently tested negative for C. difficile at 8
weeks. Thus, clinical resolution of CDI was observed in 29 of 30
patients. Although our study is limited by the lack of a placebo
arm, the single clinical recurrence of C. difficile diarrhea in this
study contrasts starkly with the recurrence rates documented in
the placebo arms of 3 randomized, controlled trials involving
patients with similar demographic characteristics and histories
of recurrent episodes of CDI [13, 35, 36]. The most recent of
these trials demonstrated relapse rates of 69%–77% in the 2 van-
comycin-containing treatment arms among patients with a me-
dian of 2–3 CDI episodes prior to enrollment [13].
Clinical improvement occurred in parallel with remodeling of
the gut microbiome. Seeding of the microbiome with a purified
fraction of spores led to marked diversification of commensal
bacteria, including augmentation of species not present in SER-
109. The engraftment and augmentation of commensals ob-
served in recipients of SER-109 suggests that this spore-based ap-
proach provides the ecologic scaffolding needed to promote the
regrowth of a diverse microbial community that is shaped by the
individual host. In addition, colonization by Enterobacteriaceae
such as Klebsiella species was reduced or eliminated, and E. coli
emerged as the dominant gram-negative species in the majority
of patients. These broad changes in relative abundance of E. coli
versus other Enterobacteriaceae species are reflective of what is
seen in the healthy gut microbiome [8].
A variety of methods have been assessed in animal models and
humans to manipulate the microbiome, ranging from use of min-
imally processed stool specimens, as in FMT, to administration of
defined compositions, ranging from a single spore species to
combinations of microbes [23, 37–39]. In a recent phase 2 trial,
the efficacy and safety of administering spores from a single non-
toxigenic C. difficile (NTCD) strain was evaluated for the preven-
tion of recurrent CDI in patients who had responded to
antibiotics for a primary episode or first recurrence [37]. Coloni-
zation with NTCD spores was correlated with protection, which
supports the use of a spore-based approach as a proof of concept
for the prevention of CDI. However, overall only 69% of patients
became colonized, and among noncolonized patients the rate of
CDI recurrence was identical to that among placebo recipients. In
addition, NTCD colonization was not detected in any patient at
the week 26 follow-up examination.

 In contrast to the NTCD trial, in this present study of SER-
109, engraftment was rapid, dose-independent, and durable
over 24 weeks of follow-up, consistent with the fact that SER-
109 is a community of live commensal spores that replicate in
the gastrointestinal tract. Our findings are consistent with the
theory that colonization resistance is driven not by individual
populations, but by a consortium of organisms [40]. In fact,
the entire spore ecology among healthy donors was represented,
based on sequencing and microbiology studies showing that the
SER-109 fractionation process does not deplete or enrich for
specific spore species. Although the exact spore species may
vary among donors, there is broad conservation based on phy-
logenetic relatedness and functional redundancy [41]. In addi-
tion, we could not discern any donor effect or the critical species
required, owing to the high rates of clinical response. Finally,
although the exact mechanism of action is not yet apparent in
these exploratory analyses, it appears that increased microbial
diversity, as seen in healthy individuals, restores the protective
function of the microbiome against C. difficile.
SER-109 also had a favorable safety profile. No drug-related se-
rious adverse events were observed over the 24-week observation
period. Most adverse events were generally limited to transient
and mild gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea,
and abdominal discomfort, and more than half of the reported ad-
verse events occurred within 3 days of dosing. Transient gastroin-
testinal symptoms have also been frequently reported in patients
who clinically responded to FMT [13, 34]. No significant abnor-
mal laboratory findings were observed in either dosing cohort.

species. Stool samples were plated on selective agar medium as described in the Supplementary Materials, and colonies were picked and evaluated by full-length 16S se-
quencing to identify species. Hatched bars represent samples for which there were no detectable Bacteroidetes species in the pretreatment sample, and solid bars represent
samples with detectable Bacteroidetes species in the pretreatment sample. Limits of detection were determined by non-Bacteroidetes bacteria that grew under the selective
conditions. Patients with identifiers ending in “-1” were from cohort 1, and those with identifiers ending in “-2” were from cohort 2. The species detected in each patient are
identified in Supplementary Table 2.

after treatment with SER-109. Principal coordinates analysis showing similarity of healthy subjects characterized as part of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), and patient
microbial ecologies before and after treatment with SER-109, based on unweighted UniFrac measures of community dissimilarity (Supplementary Materials). Clinically qualified
healthy donor samples are colored blue, and patient samples are color-coded by time point after treatment: pretreatment, red; 8 weeks, yellow; and 24 weeks, orange. For
patients who did not provide an 8-week or 24-week sample, the sample provided closest to these time points is plotted. The microbiome is characterized using 16S V4 genomic
data, and reads are taxonomically annotated at the resolution of phylogenetic clades (Supplementary Materials). HMP (n = 626) 16S data sets were acquired from the Short
Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (accession nos. SRP002395 and SRP002860). Significant differences between groups were modeled using
ADONIS with the inclusion of pretreatment, 8 weeks, 24 weeks, and HMP as treatment groups (model R2 = 0.38; P < .005; permutations = 200; Supplementary Materials).
Treatment with SER-109 and the subsequent engraftment of SER-109 bacteria into the patient’s gastrointestinal tract leads to a shift in the patient’s microbiome away
from a dysbiotic disease state towards a state that is more characteristic of healthy subjects. C and D, Change in Enterobacteriaceae counts and titers from the pretreatment
(ie, baseline) time point to 4 weeks after treatment. Number of Enterobacteriaceae species observed before treatment and 4 weeks after treatment in each patient (C). Species
were determined by plating on MacConkey lactose agar and performing 16S full-length sequencing as described in the Supplementary Materials. The difference between
pretreatment and posttreatment values was highly significant (P < .0001, by the Wilcoxon signed rank test). Fraction of the total Enterobacteriaceae titer represented by Es-
cherichia coli observed before treatment and 4 weeks after treatment (D). The change in E. coli titer as a fraction of the total Enterobacteriaceae titer was highly significant

 A meta-analysis of 536 patients has demonstrated that FMT is
effective in preventing further recurrences of CDI [42].However,
despite the availability of guidance documents, significant con-
cerns exist regarding the lack of standardized protocols, un-
knowns regarding the optimal dose of stool to administer, and
the potential for transmission of emerging pathogens [18, 30].
The use of a purified fraction of spores in SER-109 provides an
opportunity to enhance safety, as processing conditions preserve
spore viability while selectively killing vegetative bacteria, fungi,
parasites, and viruses that could be present in asymptomatic do-
nors [18, 19]. Spores can be purified from nonactive organic ma-
terial present in unprocessed stool specimens, enabling removal
of proinflammatory macromolecules (eg, lipopolysaccharide and
flagella), which may activate innate immunity in the gut [43, 44].
Taken together, these elements enable the development of a safer
and highly efficacious treatment. Furthermore, oral delivery is a
more favorable route than invasive procedures, such as colonos-
copy, particularly for elderly patients.
The lack of a placebo arm is a limitation of this study. Howev-
er, patients were demographically and clinically representative of
those enrolled in placebo-controlled trials involving recurrent
CDI, where recurrence rates of 50%–77% have been documented
[13, 35, 36]. An unknown regarding microbiome therapeutics,
whether via FMT or SER-109, is the potential for long-term con-
sequences on the human host [18, 45]; however, our 24-week
safety phase is longer than many human trials involving alter-
ations of the human microbiome, and a larger placebo-controlled
trial is underway that will better define the efficacy and safety
profile of SER-109. Finally, manufacturing changes have reduced
the pill burden to a single dose of 4 oral capsules.
In conclusion, CDI has been recognized as an urgent threat
owing to its rising incidence and associated morbidity and mor-
tality [1, 46]. There is also a significant healthcare economic
burden due to recurrent CDI, estimated to be $18 000 per recur-
rence, due to readmissions, increased length of stay, and the
need for patient isolation [47–49]. Recurrent CDI is common
because of the limited efficacy of current antibiotic regimens,
which do not address dysbiosis, the root cause of this disease
[5, 40]. Promising results from this initial study support further
development of SER-109 as a novel biologic agent that restores
the gut microbiome as a primary defense against potential path-
ogens, such as C. difficile.
