Background: The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent membrane 
protein 5α-reductase catalyses the conversion of testosterone to the most potent androgen – 
5α-dihydrotestosterone. Two 5α-reductase isoenzymes are expressed in humans: type I and 
type II. The latter is found primarily in prostate tissue. Saw palmetto extract (SPE) has been 
used extensively in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH). The pharmacological effects of SPE include the inhibition of 5α-reductase, 
as well as anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects. Clinical studies of SPE have been 
inconclusive – some have shown significant results, and others have not – possibly the result of 
varying bioactivities of the SPEs used in the studies.
Purpose: To determine the in vitro potency in a cell-free test system of a novel SP supercritical 
CO2 extract (SPSE), an inhibitor of the 5α-reductase isoenzyme type II.
Materials and methods: The inhibitory potency of SPSE was compared to that of finasteride, 
an approved 5α-reductase inhibitor, on the basis of the enzymatic conversion of the substrate 
androstenedione to the 5α-reduced product 5α-androstanedione.
Results: By concentration-dependent inhibition of 5α-reductase type II in vitro (half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration 3.58±0.05 µg/mL), SPSE demonstrated competitive binding toward 
the active site of the enzyme. Finasteride, the approved 5α-reductase inhibitor tested as positive 
control, led to 63%–75% inhibition of 5α-reductase type II.
Conclusion: SPSE effectively inhibits the enzyme that has been linked to BPH, and the amount 
of extract required for activity is comparatively low. It can be confirmed from the results of this 
study that SPSE has bioactivity that promotes prostate health at a level that is superior to that 
of many other phytotherapeutic extracts. The bioactivity of SPSE corresponds favorably to that 
reported for the hexane extract used in a large number of positive BPH clinical trials, as well 
as to finasteride, the established standard of therapy among prescription drugs. Future in vitro 
and clinical trials involving SPEs would be useful for elucidating their comparative differences, 
as well as appropriate patient selection for their use.

resulting in the corresponding 5α-3-oxosteroids. The most 
important reaction is the conversion of testosterone to the 
most potent androgen, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which 
displays the  
highest affinity toward the androgen receptor. 
The final step in androgen biosynthesis is the irreversible 
reduction of test 
osterone to DHT.
Two 5α-reductase isoenzymes are expressed in humans: 
type I and type II. Distinct biochemical and pharmacological 
properties, such as pH optimum and Km,1–3 characterize the 
isoenzymes. Their differing patterns of distribution are still 
being elucidated. The type I isoenzyme is expressed primarily 
in skin, scalp, and follicles, and is the predominant form in oil 
and sweat glands. Found primarily in prostate tissue, type II 
is expressed in stroma and basal cells of the prostate; type I 
is also expressed in epithelial cells of the prostate.1
Boudon et al performed specific enzyme amplification 
after reverse transcription to determine whether the two 
known 5α-reductase isoenzymes were expressed in prostate 
tissue. Their study reported the presence of 274 and 383 
base-pair fragments that were specific for 5α-reductase type I 
and type II, respectively. These results extended the evidence 
that 5α-reductase type II activity is largely responsible for 
the production of DHT by human prostatic cells through 
demonstrating the expression of messenger RNA in enlarged 
prostate tissue for both isoenzymes.2,3 Shirakawa et al subse-
quently identified specific enzyme activity for 5α-reductase 
type I in the prostate, supporting the hypothesis that this 
isoenzyme may also play an important role in maintaining 
prostate enlargement.1
clinical applications of 5α-reductase 
inhibition
BPH
The most common benign proliferative disorder of unknown 
etiology found in men, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 
affects over 50% of males older than 70 years. BPH confers 
its morbidity through potentially bothersome lower urinary 
tract symptoms.4 Urinary hesitancy, nocturia, incontinence, 
weak stream, and recurrent urinary tract infections are typical 
presenting symptoms.
The sole function of the prostate is to secrete fluid contain-
ing substances that are essential for reproduction, requiring an 
extremely high tissue concentration of androgens.5 Dysregula-
tion of the conversion of testosterone to DHT by 5α-reductase 
is generally considered to be a key step in the development 
of BPH. Moreover, elevated DHT levels have been shown to 
correlate with the pathogenesis and progression of androgen-
dependent diseases (eg, prostate cancer and BPH).
5α-reductase inhibitors lower the level of DHT  
available 
to prostate tissue and hair follicles, and have been used 
extensively to treat BPH. These agents block the action of 
the 5α-reductase that converts testosterone into DHT. Other 
treatments for BPH symptoms include α-adrenergic receptor 
blockers (the pharmacological agents of choice for the  
primary 
and secondary symptoms of BPH), phosphodiesterase type 5 
(PDE5) inhibitors,6,7 simple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs,8–10 minimally invasive therapies that use heat to damage 
or destroy prostate tissue, and surgery, including transurethral 
resection of the prostate. In the US, dietary supplements for 
promoting prostate health have gained popularity over the 
last decade.4,11 The herbal agents saw palmetto extract (SPE), 
rye grass-pollen extract, and pygeum have also been shown 
to relieve symptoms of BPH.
Currently available treatment options in the field of phy-
totherapy were recently reviewed by Allkanjari and Vitalone, 
who found that randomized clinical trials indicated significant 
efficacy in improving urinary symptoms with mild adverse 
effects for some phytotherapeutic agents, but that further 
clinical evidence was needed for others (eg, Epilobium spp., 
Secale cereale, Roystonea regia).12
saw palmetto extracts and BPh
SPE has been extensively utilized for the management of 
lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH. In addi-
tion to the inhibition of 5α-reductase, the pharmacological 
effects of SPE include antiandrogenic effects, antiprolifera-
tive effects, and anti-inflammatory effects.13
The numerous SPEs available today feature several dif-
ferent extraction processes, resulting in varying levels of 
BPH-related bioactivity. SPE is the phytotherapeutic agent 
that is used most frequently for the treatment of the urological 
symptoms caused by BPH.
In comparing the in vitro potency of various brands of 
SPE, Scaglione et al found that all extracts tested were able 
to inhibit both isoforms of 5α-reductase to one degree or 
another. The potency of the extracts, as well as the potencies 
of two different batches of the same extract, appeared to be 
very different; qualitative and quantitative differences in the 
active ingredients may explain these results. The investigators 
recommended that the extract product of each company be 
tested to evaluate bioactivity and clinical efficacy.14
In a more recent study, Scaglione et al compared the 
activity of different SPEs that are widely available on the 
world  
market. Although differences in activity were observed 
between the tested extracts, all were able to inhibit 5α-reductase 
type I and II isoenzymes as well as fibroblast proliferation. The

saw palmetto supercritical extract inhibits 5α-reductase
investigators concluded that extract potency differs between 
products, as does proliferation-inhibition potency, again citing 
quantitative and qualitative variations in the active ingredient 
as likely reasons for these differences.15
Due in part to varying bioactivities of the SPEs used, clini-
cal studies of SPE in BPH have been inconsistent, with some 
showing significant results and others not.4,16–19 For example, 
Bent et al randomly assigned 225 men over the age of 49 years 
who had moderate-to-severe symptoms of BPH to 1 year of 
treatment with SPE (160 mg twice a day) or placebo. The inves-
tigators found no significant difference between the SPE and 
placebo groups in change in American Urological Association 
Symptom Index scores, maximal urinary flow rate, prostate 
size, residual volume after voiding, quality of life, or serum 
prostate-specific antigen levels during the study.16
An earlier publication by our group reported the results of 
an in vitro study of an SPE made using ethanol as the solvent.20 
The current manuscript reports the results of an in vitro study 
involving an improved, supercritical SPE, a different product in 
that a supercritical CO2 solvent extracts chemistries that differ 
from those of the ethanol-extracted product. In order to make a 
comparison to the earlier-generation product that was as valid as 
possible, we felt it was essential that the second trial evaluate the 
new product – SP supercritical CO2 extract (SPSE), Prosterol® 
(Euromed) – following in vitro methods and conditions that 
were identical to those used in the earlier trial.
Objective
The objective of the present study was to determine in a cell-
free test system the in vitro potency of a novel SPSE, Pros-
terol®, an inhibitor of the 5α-reductase isoenzyme type II.
Materials and methods
Homogenates containing 5α-reductase isoenzyme II were 
isolated from transfected human embryonic kidney cells 
(HEK293), stably expressing the 5α-reductase isoenzyme 
type II (HEK293-5α2 = HEK II).21,22 The inhibitory potency of 
SPSE was measured on the basis of the enzymatic conversion 
of the substrate androstenedione to the 5α-reduced product 
5α-androstanedione, and compared to that of finasteride, an 
approved 5α-reductase inhibitor.2,3 The HEK cells are a com-
mercially available cell line, and ethical approval was neither 
required nor available for the HEK cell lines used in this study.
cell culture
HEK II cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s 
Medium (pH 7.4) with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin–
streptomycin (100 U/mL and 100 µg/mL), and 0.5 mg/mL 
of Geneticin 418 sulfate in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere 
at 37°C.
Preparation of 5α-reductase 
type i-containing cell fractions
For the cell-free in vitro assays, HEK II cells were harvested. 
They were then freed from culture medium by centrifugation 
(500 ×g), and resuspended in a homogenate buffer consist-
ing of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM 
 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 
100 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were solu-
bilized by freezing at –196°C and thawing on ice.
Following incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C with 1 mg/mL 
DNase in 50 mM MgCl2 and vigorous shaking in between, 
the obtained homogenate was centrifuged at 20,200 ×g for 
50 minutes at 4°C in a refrigerated centrifuge. The result-
ing pellet was resuspended in homogenate buffer and again 
 
centrifuged at 20,200 ×g for 30 minutes at 4°C. This pro-
cedure was repeated twice. Using homogenate buffer, the 
homogenate pellet was detached from the tube bottom and 
resuspended by Ultra-Turrax® mixing at the highest speed. 
With the commercially available RotiQuant® reagent, protein 
content was quantified according to the Bradford method; the 
fractionated cell suspension was then aliquoted and stored 
at –80°C.
assays of cell-free in vitro inhibition
Provided as oily extract, SPSE was diluted to working 
solutions of fivefold-higher strength than the intended test 
dilutions: SPSE extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO) at a concentration of 0.5 g/mL and was diluted fur-
ther 1:2 (v/v) in ethanol to obtain a 0.25 g/mL stock solution 
containing 50% ethanol and 25% DMSO (v/v).
Since the stock solution was insoluble in sodium citrate 
assay buffer, dilutions of the extract were prepared as fol-
lows. The stock solution was diluted in phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS), and NaOH was then added until the test item 
was dissolved (pH in the range, 10.7 to 12.2). With a con-
centration of 5 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL for concentration 
finding- and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)-
determination assays, respectively, the predilution was used 
to prepare the respective fivefold-concentrated test-item 
starting solutions.
Prior to application, aliquots of test item starting solutions 
were diluted with sodium citrate buffer (at a pH of 5.5) to the 
intended final test concentration for the purpose of checking 
again the final solubility as well as the pH values. The final 
solvent concentrations were 0.2% ethanol and 0.1% DMSO

for concentration finding or 0.02% ethanol and 0.01% DMSO 
for IC50 determination.
Incubations were performed in a sodium citrate buffer 
incubation mixture at 37°C, with a final volume of 250 µL 
containing 0.24 mM NADPH, 250 nM androstenedione, and 
10 µg cell homogenate and inhibitor dilutions. Serving as an 
internal control, finasteride was dissolved in ethanol, further 
diluted in PBS, and tested at a final concentration of 6 nM.
Solvent-treated controls were processed similarly, and 
contained 0.2% ethanol and 0.1% DMSO for concentration 
finding or 0.02% ethanol and 0.01% DMSO for IC50 deter-
mination, respectively. The addition of cellular homogenates 
started the enzyme reactions. After 15 minutes, incubations 
were brought to a stop by the addition of 50 µL 10 N NaOH, 
followed by shaking at 800 rpm.
For the extraction of product and unconverted substrate, 
600 µL ethyl acetate containing internal-standard griseofulvin 
(0.03 µM) were added to each sample. Samples were cen-
trifuged for 5 minutes at approximately 4,800 ×g following 
 
10 minutes of shaking, and the ethyl acetate supernatant was 
pipetted into fresh cups. The solvent was then evaporated, 
and the dried residues reconstituted in 35 µL methanol and 
subsequently subjected to liquid chromatography/mass spec-
trometry. The injection volume per sample was 12 µL.
liquid chromatography/mass 
spectrometry method
The high-performance liquid chromatography system 
consisted of an MS Plus pump (Surveyor, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and an AS Plus autosampler 
(Surveyor). Mass spectrometry was performed on a TSQ 
Quantum Discovery Max triple-quadrupole mass spec-
trometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical 
ionization interface (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA) connected to a PC running the standard software 
Xcalibur 2.0.7.
Full-scan mass spectra were acquired in the positive 
mode using syringe-pump infusion to identify the protonated 
quasimolecular ions [M+H]+. Autotuning was carried out for 
maximizing ion abundance, followed by the identification of 
characteristic fragment ions using a generic parameter set 
(parameters will be listed). Ions with the highest signal-to-
noise ratios were used to quantify the item in the selected 
reaction-monitoring mode and as qualifier, respectively.
The pump flow rate was set to 300 µL/min and the com-
pounds separated on a Gemini C6-phenyl, 3 µm, 50×2 mm 
analytical column with a Gemini C6-phenyl, 3 µm, 4×2 mm 
precolumn (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The 
 
gradients presented in Table 1 were used to detect the test 
items. The organic and aqueous components consisted of 
acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 10 mM ammonium 
formate/0.5% formic acid, respectively. Mass spectrometry 
and chromatographic parameters are presented in Table 2.
Data analysis
Results are displayed as peak area ratio, in which the area 
of the analyte peak is divided by the area of the internal 
standard peak. Conversion rates were calculated according 
to the following formula:
% conversion = peak area 5α-androstanedione /  
(peak area 5α-androstanedione +  
peak area androstenedione)

Assay acceptability
The assay setup included a positive-control inhibitor. The 
in vitro assays were deemed to be acceptable if they met 
$60% inhibition of 5α-reductase type II by finasteride at a 
concentration of 6 nM for the cell-free test system.
Results
assay
A cell-free assay using cell homogenates isolated from stably 
transfected HEK293 cells was used to test SPSE in vitro 
for its inhibitory potential toward 5α-reductase type II. The 
following final concentrations of SPSE were tested: 10, 5, 
2.5, 1.25, 1, and 0.5 µg/mL. The test concentrations were 
selected according to the results of the concentration-finding 
experiments (Tables 3 and 4).
SPSE concentration-dependently inhibited 5α-reductase 
isoform type II. The IC50 value was calculated to be 
3.58±0.05 µg/mL. Competitive binding of the test items 
toward the active site of the enzyme can be assumed, based on 
the resulting concentration–response curve. Figure 1 displays 
the results obtained from the cell-free IC50-determination 
experiment.
Finasteride, the established 5α-reductase inhibitor, was 
tested as positive control for the cell-free experiments at 6 
nM, and led to 63%–75% inhibition. Figure 2 presents the 
dose–response curve for finasteride obtained with the cell 
homogenate that was used for the assays.
Discussion
summary of results of this trial
The novel SPSE was tested in vitro for its inhibitory potential 
toward 5α-reductase type II. Testing took place in a cell-free 
assay, and used cell homogenates that had been isolated from 
stably transfected HEK293 cells.
5α-reductase type II was inhibited in vitro by SPSE in 
a concentration-dependent fashion. The IC50 for this extract 
was determined to be 3.58±0.05 µg/mL, demonstrating com-
petitive binding toward the active site of the enzyme. These 
BPH-bioassay results for SPSE compared very favorably with 
those for the standard of drug therapy – finasteride.
Mechanism of action of saw palmetto
Substantial research has shown SP to be an effective inhibitor 
of 5α-reductase activity in prostate-gland tissue.23,24 Unlike 
other inhibitors, SPE does not interfere with cellular capacity 
to secrete prostate specific antigen. SP
, moreover, exerts anti-
inflammatory effects that may also have salubrious effects 
on prostate health.5
nonclinical trials with saw palmetto
The bioactive compounds contained in hexane and diethyl 
ether extracts of SP were isolated and characterized by Abe 
et al. With female rat liver microsomes as protein source and 
testosterone as substrate, the components (oleic acid and lauric 
acid) were tested for their in vitro potency toward 5α-reductase. 
IC50 values in the range of 54–68 µg/mL were determined 
using this methodology.13 5α-reductase type II inhibition by 
SPE was assessed in a cell-based system by Habib et al. The 
investigators found that SP at 10 µg/mL substantially inhibited 
the activity of 5α-reductase type II by 76%.23
Several brands of SPE were tested for their inhibitory 
potential toward 5α-reductase type I and II in another trial,14 
using prostatic fibroblast and epithelial cells as an enzyme 
source. Although all extracts inhibited 5α-reductase, the 
potency of the extracts appeared to be very different (IC50 val-
ues ranging from 3.8 to 908 mg/L). With IC50  
values of 3.841 
and 4.313 mg/L for different batches, a hexane extract of SP 
was determined to be the most potent product in this study.14

with BPH.5 The efficacy of 160 mg of SP taken twice 
daily for 2 years was assessed by Gerber et al. Patients’ 
quality of life and maximum urinary flow had improved 
and both prostate size and symptoms had decreased 
at each 6-month evaluation. As reported by study par-
ticipants, sexual function remained stable for the first 
year of treatment and significantly improved during the 
second year.25
After receiving placebo for 1 month, men aged 45 years 
or older with moderate-to-severe symptoms of BPH were 
randomly assigned in another study to receive either SP or 
 
placebo for an additional 6 months.25 In addition to a significant 
decrease in prostate-symptom scores, quality-of-life scores 
increased to a greater degree in the SP group compared to men 
taking placebo. The investigators concluded that SP signifi-
cantly improved urinary symptoms compared to placebo.25

saw palmetto supercritical extract inhibits 5α-reductase
Suter et al conducted an open clinical pilot trial to inves-
tigate whether an SP berry preparation influenced BPH 
symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Investigators’ and patients’ 
assessments confirmed good efficacy and tolerability. Corre-
lation analyses confirmed the relationship between improved 
BPH symptoms and reduced sexual dysfunction. This was the 
first trial with SP to show improvement in BPH symptoms 
as well as sexual function.26
Giulianelli et al evaluated the efficacy of the hexane extract 
of SP in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in 
591 patients with chronic benign prostate diseases with associ-
ated inflammation, also taking into consideration the influence 
of treatment on sexual function and thus on patients’ quality of 
life. The investigators concluded that treatment for 6 months 
with the hexane extract of SP in routine clinical practice gave 
rise to a statistically significant improvement in peak flow 
rate and the International Prostate Symptom Score, National 
Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index, and 
International Index of Erectile Function 5 questionnaire scores, 
reflecting not only an improvement in urinary symptoms but 
also an overall improvement in patients’ quality of life.27
Avins et al randomized 369 patients in the CAMUS trial 
to 320 mg, 640 mg, and 960 mg daily of an ethanolic SPE 
or an identical-appearing placebo in an escalating manner at 
6-month intervals, for a total of 18 months’ follow-up. The 
investigators found that SPE showed no evidence of toxic-
ity at doses up to three times the usual clinical dose over a 
period of 18 months.28
The strongest evidence for the competitive efficacy 
and tolerability of SP in the treatment of BPH comes from 
randomized studies. Either alone or in combination with 
other plant extracts, SPE appears to be a viable option for 
improving lower urinary tract symptoms and flow measures. 
Although the evidence is less strong for Hypoxis rooperi 
and Secale cereale, these extracts also appear to improve 
symptoms of BPH.24
combination therapy with saw palmetto 
extracts
In combination with an α-blocker, the hexane extract of SP 
is associated with benefits in terms of onset of action, reduc-
tion of inflammation, and improving sexual function when 
compared with use of α-blocker monotherapy in patients 
with BPH. Prescribing this extract in combination with 
α-blockers can provide benefits beyond those achieved with 
either therapy alone.29
In a recent review of the literature, Minutoli et al 
concluded that SP may have greater potential for the 
management of BPH when combined with selenium and 
lycopene.30 Comparative efficacy in BPH was assessed for 
the following three treatment regimens in another prospective 
trial: SPE 320 mg per day (n=20), tamsulosin 0.4 mg per day 
(n=20), and SPE + tamsulosin (n=20). The investigators in 
that study reported SPE and tamsulosin to be effective alone, 
but that no treatment demonstrated superiority, and combined 
therapy provided no further benefit. The investigators con-
cluded that SPE is well tolerated and can be effective in the 
treatment of urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH.31
As described, the results of clinical studies involving SPE 
for BPH have been equivocal: some have shown significant 
results, and others have not. Such inconsistent results may 
partly be the result of the varying bioactivities of the extracts 
used in those trials.4,16–19 Fully half of German urologists 
surveyed in a recent European study expressed a preference 
for SPE to pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of BPH.32 
A Cochrane review, moreover, concluded that SPE produces 
improvements in urinary symptoms and flow measures that 
are comparable to those of finasteride.33 Investigators in 
another well-designed randomized controlled trial, how-
ever, reported no benefit in symptom relief or urinary flow 
measures following 1 year of therapy with SPE in patients 
with BPH.16
Further evaluations of standardized preparations of phy-
totherapeutic agents in randomized controlled trials with 
longer study durations will help in determining the long-term 
effectiveness of these products in the treatment of BPH. The 
strengths of this study lie in its well-validated scientific meth-
ods and the robust data generated, particularly the striking 
IC50 found for SPSE and its ability to reduce DHT, the main 
factor leading to prostate growth. Areas for future investiga-
tion, however, could include direct comparisons to competitor 
products, such as other CO2 or ethanolic extracts. Focusing on 
5α-reductase inhibition is extremely important, but in order to 
address the quality and activity of a multicompound mixture 
like SPE, it might also be useful to look at other parameters, 
such as anti-inflammatory activity and PDE5 inhibition. The 
comparative differences among these extracts might also be 
further elucidated through analytical comparisons, such as 
those conducted by Booker et al, who characterized 57 dif-
ferent SP products using two distinct analytical approaches 
and found a high level of heterogeneity among the nine fatty 
acids contained in the various products.34
Conclusion
In this study a SPSE, Prosterol®, concentration-dependently 
inhibited 5α-reductase type II in vitro. Not only does SPSE

Pais et al
effectively inhibit the enzyme that has been linked to BPH, 
but the amount of extract required for activity is also very 
low compared to data for other extracts that have been 
reported in similar tests. Data from the medical literature 
support the conclusion that SPSE is as effective as the hexane 
extract of SP that demonstrated the highest levels of in vitro 
 
bioactivity, and that SPSE is also more effective than other 
SPEs tested.
It can be confirmed from the results of this study that the 
SPSE Prosterol® has bioactivity that promotes prostate health 
at a level that is superior to that of many other phytotherapeutic 
extracts. The bioactivity of Prosterol® corresponds favorably 
to that reported for the hexane extract used in a large number 
of positive BPH clinical trials, as well as to finasteride, the 
established standard of therapy among prescription drugs. 
By establishing the bioactivity of SPSE, the present study 
reinforces the importance of conducting such trials prior to 
attempting clinical studies. Confirming bioactivity increases 
the likelihood of showing positive effects clinically, while 
reducing the chances of negative studies, such as those 
reported in the literature. Future in vitro and clinical trials 
involving SPEs would be useful for elucidating their com-
parative differences as well as appropriate patient selection 
for their use.
