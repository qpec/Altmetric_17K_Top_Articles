Abstract
Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) are one of the most consumed vegetables worldwide.
However, tomato allergies in patients suffering from birch pollen allergy occur frequently.
Due to highly similar protein structures of the tomato allergen Sola l 4 and the major birch
pollen allergen Bet v 1, patients cross-react with allergenic proteins from tomato as well as
other fruits or vegetables. The aim of this study was to quantify Sola l 4 in various tomatoes
differing in color, size and shape for identification of varieties with a reduced allergen level.
Therefore, an indirect competitive ELISA using a specific polyclonal Sola l 4 antibody was
developed. In addition, two varieties, both cultivated either conventionally or organically and
furthermore dried with different methods, were analyzed to investigate the influence of the
cultivation method and processing techniques on Sola l 4 level. Within 23 varieties, Sola l 4
content varied significantly between 0.24 and 1.71 μg Sola l 4/g FW. The tomato cultivars
Rugantino and Rhianna showed the significantly lowest level, whereas in cultivars Farbini
and Bambello the significantly highest concentration was determined. Drying of tomatoes in
the oven and by sun resulted in a significant decrease. The thermal instability was verified
for the recombinant Sola l 4 emphasizing the results for the native protein in dried tomato
samples. Overall, the Sola l 4 content is cultivar-dependent and no correlation between
color and Sola l 4 amount was found. During the drying process of tomatoes Sola l 4 level
was significantly reduced due to thermal instability. Growing conditions have a minor effect
whereas seasonal effects show a more pronounced impact. These findings could extend
the knowledge about the allergen level of different tomato varieties and may help to improve
food safety to potentially increase the life quality of patients suffering from birch pollen
allergy.
Introduction
Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is the most commonly grown and consumed vegetable world-
wide [1]. Due to its high content of lycopene and ß-carotene, acting as antioxidants and free

 radical scavenger, tomato is beneficial to health decreasing the risk of cancer and cardiovascu-
lar diseases [2]. On the other hand, the consumption of tomatoes can provoke allergic reac-
tions attributed to the presence of various allergenic proteins [3]. The prevalence of food
allergy increased during the last decades affecting 3–4% of the adult population and 5% of chil-
dren [4]. Due to varying geographical distribution of specific pollen allergens as well as local
dietary habits, geographical diversities in sensitizations patterns between patients suffering
from food allergies occur [5].
A wide range of allergens from plant origin belongs to the pathogenesis-related proteins
comprising 17 different protein families [6]. Induced in plants by various stress conditions
these proteins are part of the defense response system. Pathogens such as viruses, bacteria or
fungi, application of harsh chemicals (herbicides, fungicides), wounding or diverse environ-
mental changes (dryness, UV light) evoke the expression of PR-genes and the synthesis of PR-
proteins. The widespread occurrence and the conservation of the PR-10 protein family within
the plant kingdom emphasize an important role of this family [7]. The major birch pollen
allergen Bet v 1 as well as homologous plant food allergens from Rosaceae such as apple (Mal d
1), peach (Pru p 1), cherry (Pru av 1) or strawberry (Fra a 1) belong to the group of intracellu-
lar PR-10 proteins with a molecular weight of 16–18 kDa [8]. The presence of a hydrophobic
cavity indicates a potential role in binding nonpolar molecules. Many PR-10 proteins share
about 50% of amino acid sequence identity [9]. However, cross-reactivity occurs due to the
high three-dimensional structure similarity. IgE antibodies recognize similar cross-reactive
conformational allergen epitopes of different plant sources [6].
Tomatoes are common sources of plant food allergens [10]. Approximately 1.5% of the
population in Northern Europe [11] and up to 16% in Italy [12] is affected by allergy towards
tomato. Symptoms of an immunological reaction to tomato can affect the skin (urticarial or
dermatitis) but can also lead to oral allergy syndrome, rhinitis or abdominal pain [13]. Food
allergies are associated with a reduced life quality and excluding specific fruits or vegetables
from the daily diet. People with food allergies against PR-10 homologous allergens develop
symptoms after consumption of fresh fruits. On the contrary, processed products can be toler-
ated [5].
Currently, 26 potential proteins from tomato have been reported to provoke allergenic
reactions, including different isoforms (http://www.allergome.org). Recently, two isoforms
of the pathogenesis-related (PR) protein Sola l 4.01 and Sola l 4.02, homologous proteins to
Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen from Betula verrucosa, have been identified [14]. Bet v
1.0101 (Acc. No. X15877, UniProt P15494) and the homologous proteins Sola l 4.01 (Acc. No.
KF682291) and Sola l 4.02 (Acc. No. KF682292, UniProt K4CWC4) from tomato share 44.0
and 42.5% amino acid identity, respectively [14].
It has been shown that the allergenic potential of tomatoes is rather dependent on the culti-
var and the developmental stages than environmental cultivation conditions [5]. Since numer-
ous tomato cultivars are available, it might be possible that the concentration of Sola l 4 in
some genotypes is sufficiently low, so that patients suffering from birch-pollen related tomato
allergy can tolerate these.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) method to quantify Sola l 4 in various tomato cultivars with a specific polyclonal anti-
body. To analyze a wide range, varieties differing in size, shape and color were chosen. Fur-
thermore, the influence of cultivation conditions (organic vs. conventional) as well as different
processing methods (solar, oven and freeze-drying of tomato fruits) on the Sola l 4 content
was investigated. It was hypothesized that the Sola l 4 content varies with the color of the
mature fruits, the growing condition and the processing method. The results of this study

 could help to identify tomato fruits with a reduced allergen level to further improve food safety
and life quality of birch pollen allergenic patients.
Material and methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany), Merck (Darm-
stadt, Germany) and Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) unless otherwise noted.
Plant material
Twenty-three different tomato varieties differing in color, size and shape (S1 Table) were pro-
vided by garden center Bo
¨ck (Neufarn, Munich, Germany) and grown in the green house
under equal temperature, light and water conditions. Fruits were harvested in July 2017 at full
maturity (day post anthesis 40–45) of healthy plants without visible symptoms of pathogen
infestation and stored at -20 ˚C until analysis. In the years 2015 and 2016, a local tomato culti-
var SAAB and a commercial hybrid HF1 Perbruzzo were cultivated either conventionally or
with two types of organic growing in the experimental field of CREA-OF (lat. 42˚ 53’ N, long.
13˚ 48’ E) in Central Italy Monsampolo del Tronto, Marche Region. Conventional cultivation
soil was tilled and harrowed using Mater-Bi as artificially mulch (conv). Organic farming soil
was coated with hairy vetch (Vicia villosa R.) and mulched either artificially with Mater-Bi
(org) or naturally (norg) with mulch film out of lodged vetch. Fruits were harvested at full
maturity in August 2015 and 2016.
RNA isolation and cloning of Sola l 4.02
Commercially available tomatoes (cultivar Lyterno) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
homogenized to a fine powder using a Retsch mixer mill (Retsch MM400, Germany). Total
RNA isolation and RNA precipitation were performed according to literature [15], except that
the extraction buffer was prepared without spermidine. The concentration of the RNA prepa-
ration was determined with NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, Germany) and the integrity
was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
First strand cDNA synthesis was applied according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pro-
mega, Germany). The open reading frame (ORF) sequence of the Sola l 4.02 gene was ampli-
fied with PCR using gene-specific primers published from Wangorsch et al. [14]. PCR
products were cloned into pGEM1-T Easy vector system according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tion (Promega, Germany). In order to obtain the expression vector the gene was amplified
with two primers introducing a SphI site (SphI sola l 4 forward ACA TGC ATG CTT GGT
GTA AAC ACC TTT ACT) and BglII site (BglII sola l 4 reverse CGGA AGA TCT AGC GTA
GAC AGA AGG ATT) at its 5’end and 3’-end, respectively. The resulting PCR product was
digested with SphI and BglII and ligated into the predigested pQE70 vector (Quiagen, Hilden,
Germany). After verification of the sequence by Eurofins (Ebersberg, Germany), pQE70-Sola l
4.02 plasmid construct was transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Darm-
stadt, Germany).
Heterologous expression and purification of Sola l 4.02 protein
Recombinant Sola l 4.02 was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21(DE3)pLysS as a fusion
protein with a C-terminal His-tag. Cells were grown in 1 l LB medium supplemented with
100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 ˚C to an optical density of 0.6. Gene
expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and

 cultures were incubated for 20 h at 18 ˚C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min;
5292g; 4 ˚C) and cell pellets were stored at -80 ˚C.
Protein purification was performed via immobilized metal affinity chromatography using
Profinity Immobilized Metal Ion Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) resin (Bio-Rad Laborato-
ries, Germany). Cell pellets were suspended in 10 ml binding buffer (20 mM sodium phos-
phate pH 7.4; 0.5 M sodium chloride; 20 mM imidazole) and 0.5 mM PMSF, ultrasonicated
and centrifuged for 30 min at 21191g at 4 ˚C. The supernatant containing soluble proteins was
incubated for 2 h at 4 ˚C with the IMAC resin. After two washing steps with 10 ml of binding
buffer each Sola l 4.02 protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH
7.4; 0.5 M sodium chloride; 500 mM imidazole). The purity of the protein fractions was ana-
lyzed by SDS-PAGE. Five μg protein were separate in a 12% acrylamide stacking gel at 100 V
for 2.5 h under non-reducing and reducing conditions with ß-mercaptoethanol. For protein
staining Coomassie Brilliant Blue was used. PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo
Scientific) was used as molecular weight marker. Elution fractions containing the respective
protein were pooled and dialyzed against Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) pH 7.4 at 4 ˚C for
20 h. Insoluble particles were removed by centrifugation and the protein solution was used as
standard for indirect competitive ELISA.
Production of polyclonal antibodies with specificity for Sola l 4.02
Specific polyclonal Sola l 4 antibody was produced by Davids Biotechnologie GmbH (Regens-
burg, Germany). Elution fractions of recombinant Sola l 4.02 protein purified from soluble
fraction were pooled and used for immunization of rabbits according to a 63-day protocol.
Antiserum was further purified via affinity chromatography using a column with Sola l 4
bound to the carrier matrix. Anti-Rabbit-Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as secondary anti-
body was purchased from Carl Roth.
Purification of Sola l 4.02 from insoluble fraction (inclusion bodies)
Sola l 4.02 was also purified from the insoluble fractions (inclusion bodies) to examine the abil-
ity of refolding of the protein and whether IgG recognition, analyzed by Western blot, was pos-
sible. The remaining pellet after cell lysis, ultra-sonication and centrifugation was used. The
pellet was resolved in denaturation buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4; 0.5 M sodium
chloride; 20 mM imidazole; 8 M urea) at 4 ˚C over night, centrifuged (1 h; 21191g; 4 ˚C) and
refolded against refolding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4; 0.5 M sodium chloride;
20 mM imidazole) at 4 ˚C over night via dialysis. After centrifuged (1 h; 21,200g; 4 ˚C) the
supernatant was incubated with IMAC resin for 2 h at 4 ˚C. Protein purification was per-
formed as described above for the soluble protein fraction. Purity of the protein fractions was
evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.
Thermal treatment of rSola l 4.02
Five μg of recombinant Sola l 4.02 of purified pooled elution fractions from soluble fraction
was incubated for 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min at 99 ˚C in a Thermoblock (Thermomixer com-
fort, Eppendorf) and immediately cooled on ice. Untreated protein solution was used as
control. The integrity of the protein was further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. IgG binding
was investigated via Western blot analysis using a specific polyclonal antibody against Sola l
4.02.

 Protein determination
The total protein concentration was determined in microtiter plates (Greiner 96 well plates,
polypropylene, Sigma-Aldrich) using Roti1-Nanoquant following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Carl Roth, Germany) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard protein. Absorp-
tion at 450 nm and 590 nm was detected with the CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech,
Germany).
Drying of tomato fruits
Ripe fruits were cut into halves or quarters and further dried with three different methods
upon constant dry weight. Oven drying was performed at 55 ˚C for 72 h in a conventional
oven dryer (Thermo-Lab, Codogno, Italy). For solar drying only solar irradiance was used and
performed in a miniaturized plant (TermoTend System-GTek, Carpi, Italy) for 7 to 10 days.
Due to day-night-cycle, temperature varies between 25 ˚C and 45˚C. Freeze-drying was per-
formed for 96 h in an air-forced tunnel and lyophilized using a Dura-Stop tray dryer, com-
bined with a Dura-Dry condenser module (FTS Systems, Stone Ridge, New York) from -35 ˚C
to room temperature and samples were powdered before storage. The water loss was calculated
from the difference between fresh and dried weight of the tomato fruit samples. All samples
were stored at -20 ˚C until analysis. Dried fruits were compared to fresh, unprocessed toma-
toes, which were only available in the year 2016.
Tomato extracts
For the extraction of proteins from fresh tomatoes an established method [16] was applied. To
reduce the intra- and inter-tomato variability of allergen distribution, eight frozen fruits of one
variety were cut into halves or quarters, pooled and grind to a fine powder with a commercial
blender (Personal Blender PB 250). For each variety protein extracts were prepared in tripli-
cates. Tomato powder was supplemented with extraction buffer (10 mM KH2PO4; 10 mM
K2HPO4; 10 mM Na-DIECA; 2 mM EDTA; 2% (w/v) PVPP) containing 0.5 mM phenyl-
methylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail, Roche) 1:2 (w/v) and incubated at 4 ˚C for 4 h under shaking end over end. For dried
plant material a ratio of 1:4 (w/v) was used to ensure proper mixing. Tomato extract were cen-
trifuged for 15 min at 5292xg at 4 ˚C and dialyzed (3.4 kDa molecular weight cut-off, Zellu-
Trans, Carl Roth) against PBS pH 7.4. To remove any precipitates, a second centrifugation was
performed for 10 min at 16100xg at 4 ˚C. Extracts were directly used for indirect competitive
ELISA.
Indirect competitive ELISA
The Sola l 4 content of tomato samples was determined by indirect competitive ELISA.
Recombinant Sola l 4.02 from soluble E. coli fraction was used as competitor. Microtitre plates
(immunoGrade™ Brand) were coated with 100 μl/well purified recombinant Sola l 4.02 protein
(0.1 μg/ml) in coating buffer (PBS pH 7.4) and incubated at 4 ˚C overnight. After plates were
washed three times with 300 μl washing buffer (0,05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS), free binding
sites were blocked with 200 μl 2% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and washed as
before. Dialyzed tomato extracts were diluted in washing buffer and 50 μl were pipetted to
each well as “free” Sola l 4. Competition between immobilized and free allergen was performed
by adding 50 μl of 2 μg/ml polyclonal Sola l 4-rabbit antibody and incubated for 4 h at 4 ˚C.
Plates were washed four times and sequentially incubated with 100 μl of 1 μg/ml Anti-Rabbit-
HRP (Carl Roth, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature. Following a final washing step, 100 μl

 of 1-Step Ultra 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) ELISA solution (Thermo Scientific) were
added and the color development was stopped with 100 μl 2 M sulfuric acid after 15 min. The
absorption at 450 nm and 620 nm was measured with CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Lab-
tech, Germany). Standard curves and a negative control were applied on each microplate. The
quantification of Sola l 4 allergen in tomato extracts was determined based on the standard
curve with recombinant Sola l 4.02 protein. Fifty μl/well of serial dilutions (0.0001–25 μg/ml)
of recombinant Sola l 4.02 was pipetted as “free” allergen and followed by the same procedure
as the tomato samples. For data analysis the MARS software (BMG Labtech, Germany) was
used. Sola l 4 content was expressed as μg Sola l 4 /g fresh weight respectively μg Sola l 4/ g dry
weight. Dry matter was converted to fresh weight considering the loss of water in percent dur-
ing drying process.
Statistical analysis
For the analysis of the experimental data as well as for the box plots the statistical analysis soft-
ware R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, R version i386 3.3.3) was used. Statistical
significance levels between the variable groups were calculated using one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA). P values of � 0.05 were considered as significant. For comparisons of mean
values Tukey test was performed.
Results
Purification of recombinant Sola l 4.02 protein from soluble and insoluble
(inclusion body) fraction
Recently, the two isoforms Sola l 4.01 and Sola l 4.02 have been identified as Bet v 1-related
allergens in Solanum lycopersicum in tomato fruits from cultivar Verona [14]. Sola l 4.02
showed higher immunological activity in comparison to Sola l 4.01 and was therefore selected
for the purpose of this study. The corresponding gene was isolated and cloned from tomato
cultivar Lyterno showing complete sequence identity with the Sola l 4.02 gene (Acc. No.
KF682292; [14]).
Recombinant Sola l 4.02 was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and affinity purified
from soluble and insoluble fraction, respectively. Whereas SDS-PAGE analysis of the Sola l
4.02 protein isolated from the soluble fraction showed only a band at the predicted molecular
weight of 18 kDa (Fig 1A) Sola l 4.02 after denaturation and refolding from inclusion bodies
displayed a second band with a molecular weight of approximately 36 kDa (Fig 1B).
SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with ß-mercaptoethanol showed only one specific
band at 18 kDa (Fig 1C).
Specific polyclonal antibodies against Sola l 4 were produced via immunization of rabbit
with purified recombinant protein from the soluble fraction. Western Blot analysis showed
that the antibody recognized both, the soluble Sola l 4.02 as well as the refolded protein from
inclusion bodies (S1 Fig). Furthermore, Western Blot analysis confirmed that the polyclonal
antibody specifically recognizes native Sola l 4 allergen extracted from tomato fruits (S2 Fig).
Thermal treatment of recombinant Sola l 4.02 protein
Pooled elution fractions of purified recombinant Sola l 4.02 from the soluble protein fraction
were thermally treated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig 2A) and Western blot (Fig 2B) to
investigate the effect of heat on integrity and IgG recognition. After 10 to 30 min at 99 ˚C the
rSola l 4.02 protein was still detectable showing a clear band at 18 kDa in Coomassie stained
SDS-PAGE gel (Fig 2A). Prolonged heating of 60 min or even of 90 min resulted in diffuse

 protein bands. Moreover, IgG-binding activity decreased considerably already after 10 min
of thermal treatment of the Sola l 4.02 protein and was barely visible after 90 min at 99 ˚C
(Fig 2B).
Validation of the ELISA and extraction method
An indirect competitive ELISA was developed using recombinant Sola l 4.02 as solid phase-
bound antigen and as standard protein to determine the Sola l 4 content in various fresh and
dried tomato samples. A polyclonal rabbit antibody directed to Sola l 4 was used to detect the
Bet v 1-related allergen in tomato extracts. The ELISA showed a typical standard curve ranging

 was from 0.01 to 10.0 μg/ml (S3 Fig). To reduce the intra- and inter-tomato variability of aller-
gen distribution, fine powder of eight frozen fruits of one variety was pooled and further used
for protein extraction. Protein extracts were prepared in triplicates and extracts were diluted
2- and 4-fold for ELISA measurement. Finally the Sola l 4 content of one variety was calculated
for the three extraction replicates from two dilutions and three technical replicates on the
microtiter plate. The Sola l 4 content measured with ELISA was comparable in all three protein
extracts (S3 Fig).
Influence of tomato variety on Sola l 4 content
Twenty-three different colored tomato varieties of varying sizes and shapes were investigated
to analyze the genetic (cultivar-to-cultivar) factor on the expression of Sola l 4 at a translational
level in the fruit (Fig 3A). Total protein levels of 113.5 to 584 μg soluble protein /g fresh weight
(FW) could be extracted from fresh tomatoes (S1 Table). Sola l 4 levels ranged from 0.24 to
1.71 μg/g FW (Fig 3B). The colors of the box plots represent the respective fruit color. The sig-
nificantly lowest level of Sola l 4 was found in the cultivars Rugantino and Rhianna with 0.24
and 0.29 μg Sola l 4/g FW, respectively whereas the significantly highest concentration was
determined in cultivars Farbini and Bambello with 1.71 and 1.5 μg Sola l 4/g FW, respectively.
Ten significance groups (letters a-j) were calculated according to the Tukey Test with 5% of
significance level. The percentage of Sola l 4 referred to the total soluble protein amount varied
between 0.094% for cultivar Rugantino and 0.658% for cultivar Supersweet (S1 Table).
Effect of cultivation and processing methods on Sola l 4 content in dried
tomatoes
The influence of cultivation conditions, seasonal effects and processing techniques on the Sola
l 4 allergen content in dried tomatoes was studied by ELISA. The two cultivars SAAB and Per-
bruzzo are genotypes well adapted for the growing conditions in Central East Italy. SAAB is
very suitable for growing in organic crop management whereas Perbruzzo, a similar type is
more adapted for commercial purposes. Tomatoes were grown in Italy in the years 2015 and
2016 either conventionally or organically, with further classification into conventionally
grown with artificial mulch (conv), organically grown with artificial mulch (org) and organi-
cally grown with natural mulch (norg). After harvest, ripe fruits were dried in the oven (oven),
in the sun (solar) or via freeze-drying (freeze). Water loss in percent was calculated from the
difference of fresh and dry weight and was further included for conversion of allergen content
of dry matter to fresh matter.
Dried tomato products of both genotypes contained significantly lower levels of Sola l 4
than the fresh fruits (Fig 4), when referring the allergen content of the samples to the corre-
sponding fresh weight, regardless of the cultivation technique. Compared to dried fruits, fresh
SAAB and Perbruzzo tomatoes of 2016 contained between 3.66 to 6.25 μg and 3.19 to 3.74 Sola
l 4/g FW, respectively.
In the dried products of the SAAB genotype the allergen content ranged from 1.24 μg Sola l
4/g dry weight (DW) for freeze-dried tomatoes grown organically with natural mulch in 2015
up to 3.93 μg Sola l 4/g DW for solar dried fruits grown organically with artificial mulch in
2016 (Fig 5A). This corresponded to 0.07 and 0.23 μg Sola l 4/g FW, respectively (Fig 4A).
When comparing the two consecutive years, all dried samples of the SAAB genotype from
2016 showed higher allergen content than samples from 2015 (Fig 5A) with significant effects
for some samples. No significant differences were observed for the influence of the cultivation
method when comparing dried SAAB tomato samples from one year and fruits were dried
with the same method. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the three

 drying methods when comparing dried SAAB samples from one year and plants were grown
under the same conditions.
The allergen content of dried Perbruzzo samples (Fig 5B) ranged from 1.04 μg Sola l 4/g
DW for freeze-dried tomatoes grown organically in 2016 with natural mulch up to 10.28 μg
Sola l 4/g DW for oven dried fruits grown organically with artificial mulch in 2016. This corre-
sponded to 0.05 and 0.58 μg Sola l 4/g FW (Fig 4B). Compared to fresh fruits dried tomatoes
showed a significantly lower allergen content (Fig 4). When comparing the two consecutive
years, oven and solar dried samples from cltivar Perbruzzo showed higher allergen content in
2016 than samples from 2015 (Fig 5B) with significant effects. Strikingly, freeze-dried tomatoes
exhibited no significant differences between the two years. The influence of the cultivation
method showed no significant effect on the allergen content of Perbruzzo products when com-
paring dried tomatoes from one year and fruits were dried with the same method.
Discussion
In Northern Europe, individuals allergic to birch pollen often show cross-reactivity to allergens
from Rosaceae fruits or other vegetables and nuts [17]. IgE antibodies directed to Bet v 1
induced in a primary sensitization reaction to birch pollen can also react with Bet v 1-related
proteins from various plant origin [18]. Here, we have analyzed the Bet v 1-like Sola l 4.02 pro-
tein of the PR-10 family whose gene was identified in the S. lycopersicum genome only recently
[14]. We studied the effects of the genotype, cultivation, climate and processing methods on
the level of Sola l 4.
Biochemical and immunological properties of recombinant Sola l 4.02
The protein Sola l 4.02 (K4CWC4) shares 42.5% amino acid similarity with Bet v 1.0101
(P15494). SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant protein under nonreducing conditions
showed that Sola l 4.02 exists in a monomeric and a dimeric form, with a molecular weight of
18 kDa and 36 kDa, respectively (Fig 1). Two cysteine residues at position C113 and C115
might be able to form disulfide bonds. SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with ß-mercap-
toethanol resulted in only one band at 18 kDa, probably due to the cleavage of the disulfide
bond. Dimerization did not affect the structure of the protein epitopes as the binding of IgG
antibodies and immunological reactivity of the dimers maintained (Fig 1). Dimerization or
even oligomerization of recombinant allergens and naturally-occurring allergens was observed
previously [19–21]. Similarly, Bet v 1 has been reported to exist as a dimer [22–25]. Although
Bet v 1.0101 does not comprise a cysteine residue in its amino acid sequence and the mecha-
nism of dimerization has not been fully elucidated, dimer formation can be induced by muta-
tion of position 5 to a cysteine residue [24].
Besides of the property of the polyclonal antibody to recognize recombinant Sola l 4 puri-
fied from soluble fraction, the purification of Sola l 4 from insoluble inclusion body fraction
showed that antibody binding to the refolded protein occurs. After denaturation with urea and
refolding of Sola l 4, essential epitopes for antigen-antibody reaction must be present (S1 Fig).
An important observation is, that the antibody recognizes specifically the allergen extracted
from tomato fruits (S2 Fig). Purification of proteins from cell pellet under denaturating condi-
tions and refolding is a common method, when the amount of soluble protein is too low. High
purity and application in enzyme allergosorbent test, Western blots and basophil histamine
release were described for recombinant Pyr c 1, showing similar allergenic activity to the natu-
ral allergen from pear [26]. Furthermore, specific IgE from pear-allergenic patient sera recog-
nized the recombinant protein, purified from inclusion body fraction.

 PR-10 (Bet v 1 related) proteins from Rosaceae family are unstable to heat and sensitive to
proteases. Therefore, allergic symptoms are restricted to the upper intestinal tract (mouth)
since Bet v 1-related proteins are digested by proteases in the lower intestinal tract [27]. Simi-
larly, heat inactivation of rSola l 4.02 purified from soluble protein fraction was demonstrated
(Fig 2). Thermal treatment of the recombinant allergen changed the protein structure in such
a way, that recognition of the allergen epitopes by anti-Sola l 4 was remarkably reduced (Fig
2). The same phenomenon has been shown for rPru av 1 from cherry [27] and the apple aller-
gen Mal d 1 [28].
Allergenic potential of tomatoes is cultivar dependent
Tomato allergy is often accompanied with pollen allergies [29]. Depending on the regional dis-
tribution of pollen allergens, tomato allergic patients can be sensitized towards several tomato
allergens from different protein families [5]. The best-known groups are allergens homologous
to Bet v 1, profilins, and lipid transfer proteins (LTP). Tomato allergy is more common in
Southern Europe where allergic reactions are caused by the major allergens Sola l 6 and Sola l
7, proteins belonging to non-specific LTP [3]. These allergens are heat stable and provoke
severe symptoms. However, in Northern Europe Bet v 1 related Sola l 4 allergy is prevalent.
Sola l 4 was recognized in 76% of birch/tomato allergic patients highlighting Sola l 4 as major
allergen in tomato fruits [14].
Thus, an indirect competitive ELISA was established using a polyclonal antibody
directed to Sola l 4.02 and differently colored tomato genotypes were analyzed as fruit color
has been recently correlated with allergen content [30]. Among 23 different varieties, the
allergen content varied between 0.24 and 1.71 μg Sola l 4/g FW, independent of the total sol-
uble protein amount respectively the percentage of Sola l 4 allergen and the color. The high
variation in allergen content supports recent results, which showed that patients exhibited
different antibody-binding profiles because of varying allergenic activities of tomato culti-
vars verified with skin prick tests and basophil activation test [31]. Besides, it seems that
Sola l 4 does not function in carotenoid biosynthesis, the major group of colorants in
tomato.
Fresh tomato fruits from cultivars SAAB and Perbruzzo from Italy show generally higher
Sola l 4 allergen content compared to the collection of varieties from garden center Bo
¨ck (Ger-
many). Different locations and climatic conditions are an important parameter affecting [32]
the allergen level, previously shown for Mal d 1 content in apples. Besides this, tomatoes from
Germany were cultivated in the greenhouse.
Allergenicity of fruits is cultivar dependent as evaluated for the major apple allergen Mal d
1 [32,33]. Allergen level of the Bet v 1-homologous Mal d 1 in apple varied between 3.8 and
72.5 μg/g pulp [33] or between 2.3 and 20.1 μg/g FW [32]. Thus, the content of Bet v 1-homol-
ogous proteins in apples is higher than the corresponding protein in tomatoes (Fig 3). Apple
allergies affect up to 2% of the population in Europe and Northern America. The prevalence of
tomato allergies caused by PR-10 related allergens, however, is rare. The lower Sola l 4 allergen
level in tomato compared to apple fruits might be a reason for that. Especially in the Mediter-
ranean area tomato allergy is more relevant with severe symptoms provoked by allergens from
LTPs and profilins.
It has to be taken into account that, in addition to Sola l 4.01 and Sola l 4.02, additional iso-
forms might be expressed in tomato fruits playing a role for PR-10 allergenic patients. The
severity of an allergic reaction to fruit is related to the individual sensitivity of the patient and
moreover depended on the cultivar. Identification of specific IgE-antibodies in patient sera
and skin prick test with different varieties reveal in most of the cases a wide range from low to
Sola l 4 allergen

 high allergenic reactivity. Thus, the results of the ELISA have to be confirmed by further
immune tests but can be helpful to improve the quality of tomato cultivars.
Drying processing of tomato fruits has major effect on allergen content
During food processing the allergenic properties of food allergens can be altered by various
parameters. Washing or peeling of the food material, breaking up through grinding or cutting,
thermal treatment, fermentation processes or even purification steps in the manufacturing
procedure may have an effect on the allergenic properties of food allergens [34]. Changes in
epitope protein structure can be the factor for both, decreasing or increasing allergenic
activity.
Non-specific LTPs are a major elicitor of tomato allergies. Both, in fresh fruits as well as in
industrial products LTP are contained in crucial amounts, triggering severe allergic symptoms
[35]. Due to the high resistance to proteases and heat, these proteins maintain their immuno-
logical activity [3]. In contrast, Bet v 1 related proteins are heat-labile and patients allergic to
PR-10 proteins might tolerate processed food or food products. The loss of allergenicity due to
thermal processing was investigated for several Bet v 1-related allergens, such as Mal d 1 [28]
and Pru av 1 [27]. Furthermore, we showed that recombinant Sola 1 4.02 is also heat sensitive
(Fig 2).
Since dried tomatoes are a common product in food industry, the Sola l 4 amount was
determined in a number of differently dried fruits. Due to thermal treatment, the level of the
Sola l 4 allergen decreased significantly (Fig 4). Considering the loss of water during the drying
process, dried tomatoes contain considerably lower Sola l 4 amount than fresh tomatoes. Both,
the experiment with the recombinant protein and with tomato extracts from dried fruits affirm
the heat-sensitivity of this PR-10 protein. Although freeze-drying is a gentle drying method
known to preserve the protein structure, freeze-dried tomato samples contained the same low
allergen content as oven and solar dried fruits. Due to the loss of water during drying, the pro-
tein structure of the soluble Sola l 4 protein becomes altered and is not recognized any more
by the antibody. In addition to that, the protein might be degraded and therefore the antibody
is unable to recognize the protein fragments. No significant changes in Sola l 4 levels between
freeze-, solar-, and oven drying were observed for cultivar Perbruzzo in 2015 (Fig 5). In con-
trast, differences were detected in 2016. Removal of water by oven and solar-drying seemed to
be less effective in 2016 promoting protein solubility and allergen stability. For cultivar SAAB
the differences were insignificant between freeze-, solar-, and oven drying in both years 2015
and 2016.
According to the meteorological data (Table 1) from the growing region of tomato cultivars
SAAB and Perbruzzo in Monsampolo del Tronto, the rainfall was significantly higher in 2016

 than in the previous year. From May to August 2015 167.6 liter per square meter were mea-
sured, compared to 267.2 liter per square meter during the same season in the following year.
The average daily temperatures from May to August were slightly lower in 2016 with 21.6 ˚C
compared to 2015 with 22.9 ˚C, which is in accordance with higher rainfall in 2016. Sola l 4
allergen levels of dried tomato fruits were higher in 2016 than in 2015 for the majority of ana-
lyzed samples. Due to strong rain and high humidity, the pathogen infestation is increased and
might lead to upregulation of PR-10 genes. Thus, varying weather conditions including aver-
age temperature, precipitation and humidity seem to have a more important effect on the aller-
gen content than conventional or organic growing including the fact that pathogen growing is
promoted under specific climatic conditions leading to induction of PR-10 genes. We con-
clude that growing conditions and seasonal effects such as low humidity and high temperature,
which reduce the propagation of pathogens, would also reduce Sola l 4 content.
Conclusion
In summary, the level of Bet v 1-related allergen in tomato fruits varied significantly between
cultivars. Furthermore, the heat sensitivity of the PR-10 protein Sola l 4 was confirmed for the
recombinant protein as well as for tomato samples, when fruits were exposed to heat during
the drying process. Sola l 4.02 may be a marker for breeding hypoallergenic tomato varieties.
