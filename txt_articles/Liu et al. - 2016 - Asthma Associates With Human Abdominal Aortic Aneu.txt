oth asthma and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) 
involve inflammation. Patients with asthma exhibit 
increased plasma IgE and accumulation of eosinophils, lym-
phocytes, macrophages, and mast cells in the bronchi and 
alveoli, whereas patients with AAA harbor macrophages, 
lymphocytes, and neutrophils in the arterial wall.1–3 We 
recently reported that human AAA lesions have increased 
mast cells and IgE and presented evidence that these effec-
tors of reaginic immunity contribute directly to experimental 
aneurysmogenesis.4,5 These unexpected observations sug-
gested the hypothesis that common elements of pathogen-
esis link allergy or asthma to AAA. Indeed, mediators that 
participate in airway disease, including 5-lipoxygenase, 
5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, leukotriene A4 hydrolase 
and leukotriene C4 synthase, enzymes responsible for leukot-
riene A4, leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and 
leukotriene E4 production,6 also localize in macrophages, neu-
trophils, T cells, and mast cells in human AAA.7 Leukotriene

Objective—Both asthma and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) involve inflammation. It remains unknown whether these 
diseases interact.
Approach and Results—Databases analyzed included Danish National Registry of Patients, a population-based nationwide 
case–control study included all patients with ruptured AAA and age- and sex-matched AAA controls without rupture in 
Denmark from 1996 to 2012; Viborg vascular trial, subgroup study of participants from the population-based randomized 
Viborg vascular screening trial. Patients with asthma were categorized by hospital diagnosis, bronchodilator use, and the 
recorded use of other anti-asthma prescription medications. Logistic regression models were fitted to determine whether 
asthma associated with the risk of ruptured AAA in Danish National Registry of Patients and an independent risk of having 
an AAA at screening in the Viborg vascular trial. From the Danish National Registry of Patients study, asthma diagnosed 
<1 year or 6 months before the index date increased the risk of AAA rupture before (odds ratio [OR]=1.60–2.12) and 
after (OR=1.51–2.06) adjusting for AAA comorbidities. Use of bronchodilators elevated the risk of AAA rupture from 
ever use to within 90 days from the index date, before (OR=1.10–1.37) and after (OR=1.10–1.31) adjustment. Patients 
prescribed anti-asthma drugs also showed an increased risk of rupture before (OR=1.12–1.79) and after (OR=1.09–1.48) 
the same adjustment. In Viborg vascular trial, anti-asthmatic medication use associated with increased risk of AAA before 
(OR=1.45) or after adjustment for smoking (OR=1.45) or other risk factors (OR=1.46).
Conclusions—Recent active asthma increased risk of AAA and ruptured AAA. These findings document and furnish novel 
links between airway disease and AAA, 2 common diseases that share inflammatory aspects.

B4 contributes to inflammatory cell chemotaxis to the bronchi 
and alveoli, whereas the cysteinyl leukotriene C4, leukotriene 
D4, and leukotriene E4 increase vascular permeability and 
smooth muscle cell contraction, leading to bronchoconstric-
tion and vasoconstriction in patients with asthma.6,8 Increased 
levels of leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl leukotrienes in patients 
with asthma may promote AAA development by increasing 
aortic wall inflammatory cell accumulation and expansion.
This study probed this possible link between asthma or 
reversible obstructive airway disease (ROPD) and AAA in 
15 942 individuals with AAA from the Danish National Registry 
of Patients (DNRP), and 18 749 men with both AAA and non-
AAA controls from the Viborg Vascular (VIVA) screening trial.

Results
DNRP Population
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the participants 
(patients admitted with ruptured AAA [rAAA]) and controls 
(patients admitted with nonruptured AAA) from the DNRP 
population. A total of 15 942 patients with AAA were selected, 
4497 of whom had rAAA (81.2% males and 18.8% females). 
The 11 445 AAA controls were age- and sex-matched with the 
4497 rAAA cases. Of the 15 942 patients with AAA, 514 had 
hospital-diagnosed asthma including outpatients, from which 
146 had rAAA and 368 did not. At time of AAA admission, 
anti-asthma drug users comprised 13.9% of the cases. Of these, 
83.9% used selective β-2-adrenergic receptor agonists, 28.1% 
used anticholinergic agents, 35.0% used inhaled glucocorti-
coids, and 11.0% used theophylline. Individuals in this study 
included 81.2% men, and the median age was 74.0 (interquar-
tile range, 68.1–79.6) years. Table 1 shows patient information 
with preadmission medications within 90 days of the index 
date, including bronchodilator (with selective β-2-adrenergic 
receptor agonists and anticholinergic agents) or inhaled gluco-
corticoids. Table 1 also includes patient to general practitioner 
interaction information, household income, and marital status.
Risk of AAA Rupture in Patients With Asthma
In 15 942 patients with AAA aged 50 and older, we defined 
asthma in those who were hospital-diagnosed including out-
patient contacts, used bronchodilators containing either β-2-
adrenergic receptor agonists or anticholinergic agents or both, 
or were nonbronchodilator users but prescribed other asthma-
based medications in Denmark, including inhaled glucocor-
ticoids and theophylline. Patients with asthma may have also 
received other treatments, such as oral glucocorticoids. Patients 
with nonasthmatic diseases may have also used these drugs 
and, therefore, were not included in the rAAA risk assessment.
A total of 146 patients with rAAA had a history of hos-
pital-diagnosed asthma, among which 26 patients with rAAA 
were diagnosed with asthma <360 days and 22 patients <180 
days before the index date. When all 146 ever rAAA patients 
were compared with 654 age- and sex-matched AAA controls, 
asthma did not associate with AAA rupture before (odds ratio 
[OR]=1.08 [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.90–1.30]; P=0.413) 
or after (OR=1.02 [95% CI: 0.84–1.24]; P=0.840) adjustment 
for 7 AAA-relevant comorbidities (myocardial infarction, con-
gestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascu-
lar disease, diabetes mellitus with or without complications, and 
moderate to severe renal disease), 5 different antihypertension 
drugs (ACE [angiotensin-converting enzyme]-inhibitors, angio-
tensin II antagonists, aldosterone antagonists, β-2-adrenergic 
blocking agents, and calcium antagonists), statins, antiplatelet 
therapy, or antidiabetic therapy. Yet recently diagnosed asthma 
(<360 and 180 days from the index date) associated with a risk 
of rAAA (crude OR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.03–2.50]; P=0.038 and 
OR=2.12 [95% CI: 1.28–3.51]; P=0.003 respectively). Among 
patients with asthma diagnosed within 180 days from the index 
date, asthma remained a significant risk factor for AAA rup-
ture (OR=2.06 [95% CI: 1.21–3.53]; P=0.008) after adjust-
ment (Figure; Table 2).
The patient group that consisted of users of bronchodi-
lators (β-2-adrenergic receptor agonists or anticholinergic 
agents or both) was also analyzed based on the time from the 
index date, including those who ever used and used within 
360, 180, and 90 days of the index date. Recent use of bron-
chodilators correlated with a higher risk of AAA rupture, 
increasing with the proximity of use to the index date. OR 
values ranged from 1.10 (95% CI: 1.02–1.19; P=0.014) to 
1.37 (95% CI: 1.24–1.52; P<0.001) before adjustment and 
from 1.10 (95% CI: 1.01–1.19; P=0.035) to 1.31 (95% CI: 
1.18–1.46; P<0.001) after adjustment (Figure; Table 2).
We separated patients with AAA who received prescrip-
tions for anti-asthmatic drugs, including β-2-adrenergic recep-
tor agonists, anticholinergic agents, inhaled glucocorticoids, 
or theophylline by the prescription date to the index date, as 
ever, < 90, 180, and 360 days. AAA rupture risk increased 
from ever prescribed, within 360 days, within 180 days, to 
within 90 days from the index date, among all 4 asthmatic 
medications. For example, among rAAA patients with a pre-
scription dated <90 days before the index date, the OR values 
before adjustment were 1.35 (95% CI: 1.22–1.50; P<0.001), 
1.48 (95% CI: 1.24–1.76; P<0.001), 1.49 (95% CI: 1.28–1.75; 
P<0.001), and 1.79 (95% CI: 1.35–2.36; P<0.001) for β-2-
adrenergic receptor agonists, anticholinergic agents, inhaled 
glucocorticoids, and theophylline, respectively. After adjust-
ment, the risks that remained with their corresponding OR 
values were at 1.28 (95% CI: 1.15–1.44; P<0.001), 1.42 (95% 
CI: 1.18–1.71; P<0.001), 1.35 (95% CI: 1.14–1.71; P<0.001), 
and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.11–1.97; P=0.008), respectively (Figure;

Table 2). When restricting the analyses to patients who never 
had a hospital discharge diagnosis of chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), the association between hospital-
diagnosed asthma within 180 days and rAAA increased with 
adjusted OR from 2.06 (95% CI: 1.21–3.53; P=0.008) to 2.64 
(95% CI: 1.25–5.58; P<0.001).
External adjustment helps to address the missing informa-
tion on potential confounders.9–11 Information regarding ciga-
rette smoking from the DNRP population remains incomplete, 
which may confound the risk assessment of asthma on AAA. 
Consequently, the respective observed proportion among 
AAA patients of smokers with or without use of bronchodila-
tors permitted external adjustment for smoking in the DNRP. 
This adjustment increased the relative rAAA risk estimate to 
an adjusted OR of 1.46 (95% CI: 1.31–1.62; P<0.001) from 
1.31 (95% CI: 1.18–1.46; P<0.001) associated with bron-
chodilator use within 90 days of index date (Table 2). This 
increase in the relative risk results from an observed lower 
proportion of smokers among users of bronchodilators com-
pared with nonusers in the VIVA trial.
VIVA Screening Trial
The VIVA screening trial contains both AAA (n=619) and 
non-AAA patients with complete cigarette smoking history. 
This group differs from the DNRP population, which contains 
only patients with AAA. The VIVA population enabled testing 
for potential confounding by cigarette smoking of the asso-
ciation of AAA with asthma or ROPD. Logistic regression 
analysis demonstrated that use of bronchodilators, includ-
ing anti-asthmatic medications with β-2-adrenergic receptor 
agonists or use of glucocorticoids for inhalation or as tablets, 
associated with a 45% higher risk of an AAA (OR=1.45 [95% 
CI: 1.10–1.92]; P=0.009; Table 3, model 1). Adjustment for 
current smoking did not attenuate the risk (OR=1.45 [95% 
CI: 1.10–1.93]; P=0.009; Table 3, model 2). When current 
smoking was considered together with diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pres-
sure, body mass index, and age, the use of bronchodilators 
remained an independent and significant risk factor of AAA 
(OR=1.46 [95% CI: 1.10–1.94]; P=0.010; Table 3, model 3). 
Consideration of current smoking together with former smok-
ing reduced the risk of use of bronchodilators in AAA before 
(OR=1.14 [95% CI: 1.00–1.85]; P=0.049; Table 3, model 4) 
and after considering other AAA risk factors (OR=1.34 [95% 
CI: 0.98–1.84]; P=0.069), including diabetes mellitus, hyper-
tension, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 
body mass index, and age, although the use of bronchodila-
tors still remained an independent and significant risk factor of 
AAA (Table 3, model 5). In this VIVA population, except for 
diabetes mellitus, all other potential confounders (smoking, 
hypertension, blood pressure, body mass index, and age) were 
independently associated with the risk of AAA (Table 3).

Collection of plasma samples from 500 cases and 200 age- 
and sex-matched controls helped to test whether the plasma 
YKL-40 (chitinase 3-like protein 1) associates with AAA 
development. YKL-40 acts as a biomarker of type 2 inflamma-
tion, and its expression remains elevated in neutrophils from 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in human cancer cells, 
and in the plasma samples from patients with cardiovascular 
events.12–14 Evidence suggests, however, that YKL-40 also cor-
relates with acute exacerbation, total serum IgE, the percent-
age of peripheral blood eosinophils, and lung function among 
patients with asthma,15–18 although a current asthma-specific 
biomarker does not exist. Therefore, YKL-40 provides strong 
but not irrefutable evidence for asthma. Results showed signif-
icantly higher plasma YKL-40 levels from patients with AAA 
(n=500) than from controls (n=200; mean±standard deviation, 
106.6±102.8 versus 91.9±147.6 μg/L; P<0.001, Wilcoxon 
rank sum test). Patients who used bronchodilators also had sig-
nificantly higher plasma YKL-40 levels than those who did not 
use bronchodilators (mean±standard deviation, 122.0±129.8 
versus 100.7±116.9 μg/L; P=0.049, Wilcoxon rank sum test).

Discussion
This study established an association between AAA and 
asthma or ROPD in humans. Data collected from the large 
population of Danish patients with AAA in DNRP showed that 
a hospital diagnosis of asthma or a recently filled prescription 
of an anti-asthmatic drug associated with an increased risk of 
admission with rAAA compared with admission with intact 
AAA, both before and after adjusting for AAA comorbidities 
and relevant medications. Moreover, an asthma diagnosis or 
the use of bronchodilators or other anti-asthmatic drug pre-
scriptions closer to the date of admission with AAA corre-
lated directly with a higher risk of aortic rupture. The results 
remained robust after adjusting for a wide range of relevant 
possible confounders. The late onset of asthma and medication 
use associated with aortic rupture relates to findings from a 
recent case–control study of 50 patients with childhood onset 
of asthma and 57 healthy children in which earlier onset of 
asthma during childhood did not affect abdominal aortic stiff-
ness parameters, including aortic distensibility, aortic strain, 
pressure strain elastic modulus, and pressure strain normal-
ized by diastolic pressure.19
The lack of information on cigarette smoking among the 
DNRP population could confound our conclusion, as smok-
ing is a known independent risk factor for rAAA.20 Indeed, 
external adjustment of the DNRP data of smoking habits 
among patients with AAA using or not using bronchodila-
tors only increased the independent relative risk of rupture 
by an asthma diagnosis or the use of bronchodilators or other

anti-asthmatic drug prescriptions. In addition, supplemental 
analyses from the VIVA trial21 showed that adjustment for 
smoking did not change the independent estimates of risk of 
AAA among bronchodilator users, suggesting that broncho-
dilator use did not associate with smoking status. The risk of 
AAA among patients with asthma remained 45% higher than 
that of patients with nonasthma.
Prior studies established an association between AAA 
and COPD.22–25 Although asthma and COPD can overlap in 
some patients, the majority of patients with asthma do not 
have COPD. A diagnosis of asthma does not necessarily lead 
to hospitalization or outpatient contact. This potential limita-
tion led us to define asthma as those patients who had ROPD 
and recorded the use of bronchodilators, as reported recently 
in an atherosclerosis risk-assessment study.26 Higher OR of 
aortic rupture from AAA patients with hospital-diagnosed 
asthma were identified than those from AAA patients who 
received anti-asthmatic medication (Figure; Table 2), sug-
gesting that we have underestimated the risk of asthma on 
AAA by defining asthma as the recorded use of bronchodila-
tors and anti-asthmatic drugs (β-2-adrenergic receptor ago-
nists, anticholinergic medications, inhaled glucocorticoids, 
and xanthines). The strengths of this study include the use 
of 2 relatively large population-based cohorts, which sup-
port both the association of ROPD with the risk of having 
an AAA and the rupture of an existing AAA. The interroga-
tion of population-based cohorts minimizes the risk of selec-
tion bias, and the use of the drug registry minimizes the risk 
of misclassification as no relevant bronchodilator agent is 
given without a recorded prescription. Yet the inclusion in 
this group of users both patients with asthma and those with 
COPD with some reversible obstructive component presents 
a limitation. In Denmark, the number of prescriptions for 
inhalated bronchodilating agents for indications other than 
asthma or ROPD remains low, but the possibility exists that 
a small portion of patients using inhalated bronchodilator 
agents have COPD without a reversible component,25,27,28 
which may confound our conclusion. Consequently, a sub-
group analysis of patients with or without a diagnosis of 
asthma showed an increase in the relative risk of rupture to 
about twice as high a risk of rupture. This finding strongly 
supports the primary hypothesis of this study because this 
analysis concentrates on a severe risk of misclassification as 
many patients with asthma are solely managed by the general 
practitioners, introducing a bias toward the null hypothesis in 
this subgroup analysis.
Several recent studies have provided direct and indirect 
evidence that link the risk of asthma on human AAA and rup-
ture. In apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe–/–) mice, develop-
ment of allergic airway inflammation significantly enlarged 
atherosclerotic plaques and increased lesion inflammation.29 
Recent data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis 
show that patients with asthma who use inhaled corticoste-
roids, leukotriene inhibitors, or oral corticosteroids have sig-
nificantly higher plasma C-reactive protein and fibrinogen 
concentrations, lower unadjusted cardiovascular disease–free 
survival rate, and higher cardiovascular disease risk than 
patients with asthma who do not use these medications or 
those without asthma.26 Although atherosclerosis may not 
underlie all AAA, atherosclerosis usually accompanies aneu-
rysmal dilation30 and constitutes a long-recognized risk factor 
of AAA.31 We recently demonstrated directly that the devel-
opment of allergic airway inflammation in mice doubled the 
size of experimental AAA, regardless of whether allergic air-
way inflammation began before, after, or during AAA forma-
tion.32 The mechanisms by which humans and mice develop 
AAA and asthma or allergic lung inflammation can differ, but 
we found a comparable increase of plasma IgE in mice that 
developed AAA or allergic lung inflammation. A synergistic 
increase of plasma IgE in mice with both AAA and allergic 
lung inflammation32 and beneficial effects on both human 
asthma and mouse AAA development of targeting IgE5,33 sup-
port the contribution of IgE to both diseases.
As discussed, inflammatory cell accumulation in the air-
way and aortic lesions accompanies both asthma and AAA. 
These leukocytes may participate in the pathogenesis of 
these 2 seemingly unrelated diseases. In the asthmatic lung, 
mast cells release cytokines, proteases, and histamine and, 
thus, stimulate airway tissue remodeling, mucus secretion, 
smooth muscle contraction and vasodilatation, and immune 
cell activation.34,35 Sputum from patients with asthma con-
tains significantly increased neutrophil and eosinophil num-
bers.36 Eosinophils mediate airway inflammation in mild and 
moderate atopic asthma, whereas neutrophils predominate 
in nonatopic and severe asthma.37–39 The polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes release neutrophil elastase that may mediate air-
way goblet cell hyperplasia, degranulation, and mucous plug-
ging.40 Although a direct role of eosinophils in AAA remains 
untested, either mast cells or neutrophils promote AAA devel-
opment. Mast cells contribute to AAA by releasing cytokines 
(eg, interleukin 6 and interferon-γ) and proteases (eg, chymase 
and tryptase) that can activate vascular cells and breakdown 
the arterial extracellular matrix.4,41,42 Neutrophils also release 
proteases that can contribute to arterial wall tissue remodel-
ing.43,44 These shared mechanisms likely contribute to cross-
talk between these diseases, a hypothesis that merits further 
investigation.
Finally, a risk of confounding exists—especially in the 
DNRP analyses, which lacks individual data regarding smok-
ing status. Yet, the VIVA study indicates that users of bron-
chodilating drugs smoke less than nonusers. Although we 
adjusted for almost all known potential confounders, the risk 
of residual confounding always remains an issue in observa-
tional studies.
In conclusion, this observational study conducted in 
2 independent cohorts established a new link between the 
allergic asthma and AAA. Because allergic inflammation 
with elevated plasma IgE may promote AAA pathogenesis,5 
other allergic inflammatory diseases, such as atopic dermati-
tis, allergic rhinitis, and several ocular allergic diseases, may 
carry similar risks as asthma for AAA formation and rupture. 
The findings from this study highlight a commonality in the 
inflammatory pathways involved in AAA and other prevalent 
and seemingly unrelated diseases. The results have implica-
tions for the development of much needed advances in the pre-
vention, screening criteria, and treatment of AAA, common 
conditions for which we currently lack sufficiently effective 
approaches.

Both abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and asthma are inflammatory diseases that share many pathological events, including inflammatory 
cell accumulation and T-cell immunity. We have recently demonstrated that experimental allergic lung inflammation significantly promoted 
the progression of both angiotensin II infusion–induced and periaortic CaCl2 injury–induced AAA in mice. This study tests the hypothesis that 
asthma or reversible obstructive pulmonary disease associates with the risk of AAA in humans. Two populations of patients from Denmark 
were studied: one that enrolled all AAA patients including those with aortic rupture and another contains both AAA and AAA-free control 
patients. This study demonstrates that patients with hospital-diagnosed asthma or those have records of asthma medication experience 
significantly higher risk of having AAA or aortic rupture than those without asthma or related medications.
