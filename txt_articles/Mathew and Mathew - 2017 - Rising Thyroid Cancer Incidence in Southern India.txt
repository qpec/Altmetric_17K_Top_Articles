Background: Thyroid cancer incidence is rising in high-income countries. This increase in disease
burden is attributed to the phenomenon of overdiagnosis.
Objective: We aimed to investigate trends in thyroid cancer rates in India, focusing on the state of
Kerala in southern India, which has reported a high incidence of the disease.
Design: Population-based study using data from the National Cancer Registry Program.
Participants: We used data from the Population Based Cancer Registries for Thiruvananthapuram
(capital of Kerala state), Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai. We used data for three reporting
periods from 2005 to 2014 (represented as 2006, 2009, and 2012).
Main Outcome Measures: We reported the age-adjusted incidence rate (AARi) and mortality rate
(AARm) per 100,000 women and the proportion of thyroid cancers diagnosed in females per 100 cancer
cases.
Results: During 2006, the AARi for thyroid cancer in women in Thiruvananthapuram was 6.9 per
100,000, rising to 10 in 2009 and 13.3 in 2012. There was a 93% increase in incidence rates over less
than a decade. The AARis in the other four cities were stable. In 2012, Thiruvananthapuram had at
least a fourfold higher incidence compared with other regions. Thyroid was the primary site in one of
every 10 cancers diagnosed in Thiruvananthapuram, and large numbers of patients were ,40 years of
age. The AARm remained stable in all regions.
Conclusion: We reported a high burden of thyroid cancer in Kerala, India, which is most likely due to
overdiagnosis.

Thyroid cancer incidence and prevalence rates are rising throughout the world [1]. An
analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from the United States
showed a tripling of thyroid cancer incidence over 35 years beginning in 1975 [2]. The absolute
rates of thyroid cancer in women were four times those seen in men. However, the thyroid
cancer2specific mortality rate remained stable over 35 years. Similarly, in Korea, thyroid
cancer incidence increased by 15 times from 1993 to 2011 [3]. Such increases in incidence rates
have been reported by various countries and regions around the world [4]. Most newly

 diagnosed patients have an indolent type of differentiated thyroid cancer (predominantly
papillary histological subtype) and smaller tumors [1, 4].
Thyroid cancer is particularly prone to the phenomenon of overdiagnosis, whereby large
numbers of subclinical cases are diagnosed without a positive impact on thyroid cancer2
specific mortality [5]. Overdiagnosis results from the widespread prevalence of a subclinical
disease state that otherwise would not cause any symptoms combined with an easily ac-
cessible diagnostic testing modality. A meta-analysis of 12,834 autopsies reported a prev-
alence rate of incidental differentiated thyroid cancer of 11.2% in glands that were examined
in whole [6]. The meta-analysis also found that prevalence rates have been stable since 1970,
suggesting that the increased detection rates were likely due to overdiagnosis and were not a
consequence of increasing rates of carcinogenesis. Studies have also noted that the incidence
rate of thyroid cancer is higher in regions with greater access to diagnostic tests such as
thyroid ultrasonography and needle biopsies [7–9]. Therefore, it is now well understood that
rising rates of thyroid cancer (i.e., “epidemic” proportions) are due to overdiagnosis.
Most of the data supporting an epidemic of thyroid cancer come from high-income countries;
therefore, this phenomenon is generally considered a problem of the developed world. However,
an epidemiologic transition from communicable diseases to chronic noninfectious diseases is
rapidly developing in low- and middle-income countries [10]. In the past, infectious diseases
overwhelmed the health careinfrastructurein these regions; the systemhas nowbeen overtaken
by the burden of noncommunicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.
The state of Kerala in southern India, home to .34 million people, has health indices
comparable to those of developed nations. The health care system in Kerala has undergone
the epidemiologic transition much earlier than the rest of the country [11]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that a thyroid cancer epidemic may be occurring in the region and aimed to
study thyroid cancer diagnosis trends in Kerala.
1. Materials and Methods
A. Study Population
Using data from the Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) compiled by the National
Cancer Registry Program (NCRP) of the Government of India, we investigated the burden of
thyroid cancer in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala state, and compared it with
data from registries in four major cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai) (Fig.
1) [12]. Data reported in each of the PBCRs were collected from multiple hospitals. The data are
publicly accessible on the Web site of the Indian Council of Medical Research and are released
on a periodic basis [12]. Because the PBCR for Thiruvananthapuram was established in 2006
and reported data collected from January 1, 2005, we used the data reported from that year. The
PBCR for Thiruvananthapuram increased its coverage to the district level from 2012 onward;
therefore, the number of cases reported to the registry increased in recent years.
B. Reporting Periods
There was variability in the years of reporting for each PBCR: Thiruvananthapuram reported
data for 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2011, and 2012 to 2014; Delhi reported data for 2006 to 2007,
2008 to 2009, and 2012; Mumbai reported data for 2006 to 2008, 2009 to 2010, and 2012;
Bangalore reported data for 2006 to 2007, 2008 to 2009, and 2012; and Chennai reported data
for 2006 to 2008, 2009, and 2012 to 2013. For ease of research communication, we have used
common years to represent the three periodic reports: 2006, 2009, and 2012.
C. Measures of Cancer Incidence
The burden of cancer incidence and mortality is reported in the PBCR reports in two
ways: the age-adjusted incidence rate (AARi) and age-adjusted mortality rate (AARm)
per 100,000 females and the relative proportion of thyroid cancer among 100 cancers

 diagnosed. Cancer incidence data were obtained from all three reporting periods (2006,
2009, and 2012). Cancer mortality data were obtained only from the first two reporting
periods (2006 and 2009), because the recent PBCR report did not provide information on
mortality rates. Method of cancer diagnosis was abstracted from the 2012 PBCR report as
the proportion of cancers diagnosed through microscopic examination.
We investigated the frequency of thyroid cancer in females because the thyroid cancer
epidemic has been observed especially in this population. We also investigated the fre-
quency of breast cancer in females, which is another screen-detected malignancy. We
hypothesized that if improved methodology in data collection resulted in spuriously rising
cancer incidence rates, it would manifest in increasing rates of breast cancer. We also
investigated the frequency of thyroid cancer2specific mortality. Finally, we looked into
the proportion of thyroid cancers diagnosed through microscopic examination.
D. Global Rates of Thyroid Cancer
To understand the burden of thyroid cancer in Thiruvananthapuram, we compared data from
the 2012 PBCR report with the cancer incidence data for the year 2012 provided by the
Globocan Project of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and standardized the
incidence rate to the world standard population [13]. Data from cancer registries that pro-
vided high-quality national or regional data for 2012 along with data from the 2012 PBCR
were used to identify 10 nations or regions with the highest incidence rates of thyroid cancer.
We independently abstracted the data from the PBCR and Globocan reports. No in-
stitutional review board approval was necessary because the data are publicly available.
Descriptive statistics were used to report the data.
2. Results
A. AARi for Thyroid Cancer
The AARi for thyroid cancer in Thiruvananthapuram during 2006 was 6.9 per 100,000 fe-
males, rising to 10 in 2009 and 13.3 in 2012 (Fig. 2). This constitutes a 93% increase in

 incidence over 10 years (from 2005 to 2014). This doubling in burden of thyroid cancer di-
agnosis was not observed in the other four regions, where the incidence rate was stable during
the 7 to 8 years of PBCR reporting. The AARi in the four regions ranged from 2 to 4.1. During
the last reporting period, Thiruvananthapuram had more than a fourfold higher incidence of
thyroid cancer compared with rates in the other four regions.
B. Proportion of Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis
The increase in AARi seen in Thiruvananthapuram was also reflected in the proportion of
thyroid cancers diagnosed in the district (Fig. 2). Although thyroid cancers constituted 6.5%
of all cancers diagnosed in females in Thiruvananthapuram in 2006, by 2012 the proportion
had risen to 10.4%. The proportion of thyroid cancers in the other four regions ranged from
1.6% to 4% during 2012.
C. Breast Cancer Rates
Because the Thiruvananthapuram PBCR reported an increase in the number of cases re-
ported during the study period, we investigated whether breast cancer incidence rates in-
creased as well. As shown in Fig. 3, there was no such increase in incidence or proportion of
breast cancers in the five cities during the three reporting periods.
D. AARi of Thyroid Cancer by 5-Year Age Group
On the basis of AARi by 5-year age group, Thiruvananthapuram had a much higher incidence
of thyroid cancer in all females ,65 years of age compared to the other four regions (Fig. 4).
However, the magnitude of the increased incidence was particularly pronounced in women
,40 years of age.
E. AARm for Thyroid Cancer
Although the AARi steadily increased in Thiruvananthapuram during the three reporting
periods, the AARm remained stable at 0.4 to 0.5 per 100,000 females during the first two
reporting periods (Table 1). Stable trends in thyroid cancer2specific mortality were similar in
all five cities. Most thyroid cancer diagnoses in the five cities were verified through micro-
scopic examination (Thiruvananthapuram 99%, Delhi 95%, Mumbai 91%, Bangalore 98%,
and Chennai 87%).
F. Comparison of Globocan 2012 and PBCR 2012
Finally, using data from Globocan 2012 and PBCR 2012, we identified the 10 regions with the
highest incidence of thyroid cancer in 2012. The age-standardized incidence rate adjusted to
world standard population for Thiruvananthapuram was 13, which implies that the district is
the eighth most affected region in the world (Fig. 5).

 3. Discussion
We found that the incidence rate of thyroid cancer in Thiruvananthapuram increased by
twofold from 2005 to 2014. This increase in diagnoses was not observed in Delhi, Mumbai,
Bangalore, or Chennai. The incidence rate of thyroid cancer in Thiruvananthapuram for
reporting year 2012 was more than four times higher than the rates in the other four regions.
In the Thiruvananthapuram region, thyroid cancer comprised one of every 10 cancers di-
agnosed in females. In Kerala, women ,40 years of age are at high risk for increased diagnosis
of thyroid cancer. In addition, we reported that thyroid cancer2specific mortality rates
remained stable during the first two reporting periods.
We found a substantial burden of thyroid cancer in the Thiruvananthapuram district
compared with the other four regions in India. What could explain the epidemic of thyroid
cancer diagnoses in this southern Indian state? Could it be due to overdiagnosis, increased
carcinogenesis, or both?
It is well understood that thyroid cancer diagnosis is susceptible to the phenomenon of
overdiagnosis, which is characterized by increased detection of smaller tumors that have
a predominantly differentiated histology [14]. In a region affected by overdiagnosis, thy-
roid cancer2specific mortality remains stable despite increasing incidence rates [1–3].
We identified a similar trend of increasing incidence rate and stable mortality rate in
Thiruvananthapuram. Not surprisingly, we did not observe a similar trend in the other four
regions in India, which validates our hypothesis that the state of Kerala may be susceptible to
the problem of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis often seen in high-income countries.
Could the increased burden of thyroid cancers in Thiruvananthapuram be attributed to in-
creased reporting of new cancers to the PBCR, especially considering that the coverage area of the
registry increased during the period? If that accounted for the increasing incidence of thyroid
cancer, a similar trend would have been observed in breast cancer, which is the leading site of
cancer in women. Therefore, the rising incidence of thyroid cancer in Thiruvananthapuram cannot

 be attributed to an increase in case reporting to the registry. Misdiagnosis is unlikely to explain the
increase in incidence because a majority of diagnoses in all the PBCRs (i.e., 87% to 99%) occurred
through microscopic examination. The PBCRs do not report if the microscopic examination was
conducted through fine-needle aspiration cytology or histopathologic test in a surgical specimen. If
there was a difference in rates of microscopic confirmation relative to imaging-based diagnoses, we
could have attributed the difference in incidence rates to possible misdiagnosis.
Another reason to attribute increased thyroid cancer rates in the Thiruvananthapuram
PBCR to overdiagnosis is the data on incidence rates by 5-year age group. Overdiagnosis
affects younger women more than the elderly, and our study found that women ,40 years of
age constituted a large number of cancers in the Thiruvananthapuram region. Unfortunately,
the PBCR did not report the proportions of differentiated thyroid cancer diagnoses during the
three reporting periods. However, because differentiated thyroid cancers comprise nearly
90% of all thyroid cancers, we do not think it would be any different in India. In addition, we
lack information on the proportion of smaller tumors diagnosed in these regions during the
three reporting periods. Regions affected by overdiagnosis have displayed a substantial
increase in diagnoses of smaller tumors over time [4, 15].
Although overdiagnosis appears to be a more rational explanation for the increased incidence
of thyroid cancer in Kerala compared with rates in other regions of India, an underlying etiology
is still plausiblefor the increased risk for carcinogenesisthat is contributing to the thyroid cancer
epidemic. However, most of the well-recognized etiologies of thyroid cancer, such as obesity and
smoking, family history of thyroid cancer, exposure to environmental ionizing radiation and
toxins, or an iodine-rich diet, may not be notably different in the five regions [16–19].
If overdiagnosis is the reason behind the increased burden of thyroid cancer in Kerala, why is it
affecting the region? There is a putative association between greater access to health care and
increasedincidenceofthyroidcancer[3,7,9,20].Unfortunately,toourknowledge,therearenodata
on the number of thyroid surgeries or the number of thyroid ultrasonography examinations
performed in these cities or regions. However, in our experience, all five regions are capital cities of
their respective states and are quite comparable regarding access to thyroid ultrasonography and
the density of endocrinologists and thyroid surgeons. Kerala state is generally believed to have a

 highersocioeconomic and educationalstatus than therestof the country [11]. Higher socioeconomic
and educational status in a population may increase thyroid cancer diagnosis rates [8, 20]. A well-
conducted case-control study may help unravel this association, which could explain the reason for
overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in Kerala. We also recommend that future PBCR reports include
data on tumor size as well as rates of differentiated thyroid cancer diagnosis.
Our study has a few limitations. First, our data are based on reporting from the NCRP of the
Government of India. There may be variations in reporting in the PBCRs, although the NCRP
has directed considerable effort to ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the data. Second,
reporting years vary between PBCRs. Nevertheless, we believe the trends unraveled by our
study have internal validity, at least within each PBCR. Third, we do not have mortality data
for the third reporting period. However, mortality rates are similar in all five cities, despite a
substantially higher incidence rate in Thiruvananthapuram, which suggests an underlying
problem of overdiagnosis in the region. According to secular trends in thyroid cancer incidence
in the United States over 35 years, mortality rates remained stable despite a rising incidence
[2]. Similarly, it is unlikely that a rising trend in mortality rate would be forthcoming in Kerala.
Fourth, we do not have data on the proportion of tumors that are small or the proportion of
papillary cancers diagnosed. We propose that the PBCR for Thiruvananthapuram obtain and
provide such information in upcoming reports because it may help validate the study con-
clusions. Fifth, research evaluating regional differences in the prevalence of risk factors for
thyroid cancer within India are limited. However, we do not believe the prevalence of these risk
factors varies significantly between the five regions in our study.
The phenomenon of overdiagnosis seems to be the most plausible explanation for the
substantial burden of thyroid cancer in Kerala. It is not without notable personal and societal
costs [21]. Because a large proportion of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer are ,40 years of
age, this could result in overtreatment, which profoundly increases risks for heart disease,
stroke, and osteoporosis [22]. Therefore, if the rise in thyroid cancer is not curtailed, it will lead
to major burdens on the health and economic welfare of the people in Kerala. Trends in thyroid
cancer incidence must be closely monitored in other regions of India, as well as in other low- and
middle-income countries. Strict adherence to thyroid cancer guidelines from various societies
may help reduce rates of overdiagnosis and consequently, overtreatment [23, 24].
In conclusion, we report a higher burden of thyroid cancer in the southern Indian state of
Kerala and identify overdiagnosis as the most plausible explanation for the rising incidence of
thyroid cancers in the region. Unless it is urgently tackled, the diagnosis of indolent, small,
differentiated thyroid tumors in young women may continue to rise. Such a trend would result
in profound longer-term adverse effects at individual and societal levels.
