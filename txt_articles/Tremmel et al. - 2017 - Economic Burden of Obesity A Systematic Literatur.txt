Abstract: Background: The rising prevalence of obesity represents an important public health issue.
An assessment of its costs may be useful in providing recommendations for policy and decision
makers. This systematic review aimed to assess the economic burden of obesity and to identify,
measure and describe the different obesity-related diseases included in the selected studies. Methods:
A systematic literature search of studies in the English language was carried out in Medline (PubMed)
and Web of Science databases to select cost-of-illness studies calculating the cost of obesity in a study
population aged ≥18 years with obesity, as defined by a body mass index of ≥30 kg/m2, for the
whole selected country. The time frame for the analysis was January 2011 to September 2016.
Results: The included twenty three studies reported a substantial economic burden of obesity in
both developed and developing countries. There was considerable heterogeneity in methodological
approaches, target populations, study time frames, and perspectives. This prevents an informative
comparison between most of the studies. Specifically, there was great variety in the included
obesity-related diseases and complications among the studies. Conclusions: There is an urgent
need for public health measures to prevent obesity in order to save societal resources. Moreover,
international consensus is required on standardized methods to calculate the cost of obesity to
improve homogeneity and comparability. This aspect should also be considered when including
obesity-related diseases.
Keywords: obesity; cost of illness; obesity-related disease; burden of obesity
1. Introduction
Obesity is a condition in which fat accumulates in the body to a point where it is a risk factor
or marker for a number of chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and
cancer, and has adverse effects on overall health [1–3]. Body mass index (BMI), calculated as weight
in kilogram (kg) divided by height in meters squared, is one of the most commonly used screening
tools to measure and characterize obesity. A BMI of 25 to <30 kg/m2 is defined as overweight and
BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 is classified as obese [4,5].
Obesity constitutes an important threat to national and global public health in terms of prevalence,
incidence and economic burden. In 2014, more than 2.1 billion people, nearly 30% of the global
population, were overweight or obese and 5% of the deaths worldwide were attributable to obesity. If

the incidence continues at this rate, almost half of the world’s adult population will be overweight or
obese by 2030 [6].
Obesity also imposes a large economic burden on the individual, and on families and nations [7,8].
In 2014 the global economic impact of obesity was estimated to be US $2.0 trillion or 2.8% of the
global gross domestic product (GDP) [6]. Besides excess health care expenditure, obesity also imposes
costs in the form of lost productivity and foregone economic growth as a result of lost work days,
lower productivity at work, mortality and permanent disability. It has been described in recent studies
and reviews that there is a gradient between increasing BMI and costs attributable to obesity [9–12].
Cost of illness (COI) studies help policy makers understand the economic burden of a specific
disease. Such COI studies identify different components of costs of specific diseases or disease-related
complications in different sectors of the society, which may have been saved if the disease had not
existed. They are conducted from different perspectives that determine the types of cost included in
the analysis. These perspectives measure costs to the society, health care systems, participants and
their families and third-party payers [13,14]. Furthermore, COI studies have a significant role in public
health in formulating and prioritizing health care policies and allocating health care resources by
estimating the amount of costs attributable to a disease [15].
Systematic literature reviews represent a systematic way to identify relevant studies, to summarize
the results, to critically analyse the methods of the studies and, finally, to comment and recommend
improvements for future research.
Systematic reviews in the context of cost of obesity (COO)
summarize the results of available studies in order to provide a high level of evidence on the cost
burden due to obesity, which may help decision makers to develop policies to tackle the burden of
obesity [16].
There have been a number of literature reviews on COO [17–28] including studies from before 2011.
Since 2011, however, advanced methods such as microsimulation modelling [29–31] have been used
and have led to new findings, requiring further, systematic exploration. Furthermore, some reviews
have included studies that were specific to a single country or continent, e.g., the USA [18,26],
Canada [24] or Europe [21,22,27], and have excluded studies from all over the world. Some reviews
have included studies that accounted for direct costs [23,26,28], while others have included only
indirect costs [25].
Direct costs include all direct medical and non-medical costs for diagnosis,
treatment and transportation [32]. Indirect costs are the productivity loss cost due to morbidity
and early mortality [33]. Moreover, some studies include costs for both overweight and obesity and do
not separately differentiate the cost burden [21,26].
In addition, none of the reviews has systematically analysed the obesity-related co-morbidities
included in the cost calculation. Since obesity itself is not only a disease but also a risk factor for
other diseases, it is important to study which co-morbidities have been included in the different COO
analyses. The attributable burden of obesity differs across studies. Attributable burden is determined
by the co-morbidities included in a cost calculation. It would be interesting to examine how, in the
included studies, these co-morbidites are adjusted for in the overall cost calculation.
Two recently published systematic reviews have attempted to explore the problems associated
with the methodological heterogeneity of studies [10] and performed a quality appraisal of the analysed
studies [12]. Nevertheless, there is still a methodological heterogeneity within COO studies and a lack
of systematic reviews examining the different obesity-related diseases included in these studies.
The objective of this study was to: (1) perform a systematic review to assess the economic
burden of adult obesity; and (2) identify and describe different obesity-related diseases included in the
selected studies.

2. Methodology
This systematic review has been performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines [34]. Moreover, the Campbell and Cochrane
Economics Methods Group guidelines have been followed including search criteria, data extraction,
synthesis and critical analysis.
2.1. Search Strategy
A systematic search was performed to identify relevant articles published in databases from
1 January 2011 until 14 September 2016. The databases used were Medline and Web of Science.
Additional publications were searched on Google Scholar from the reference lists of included studies
and reviews by backward and forward snowball searches. The details of the searching strategy with
key words and initial hits are provided in Appendix A to ensure reproducibility and transparency of
the work.
2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We included studies that satisfied the following criteria:
(1) obesity was defined as
BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2; (2) the estimation was based on the entire country and a representative population;
(3) the estimated COO could be either direct or indirect or both; (4) estimated costs were specific
to obesity and not overweight; (5) the research was reported in English in a peer-reviewed journal;
and (6) studies with any perspective (e.g., societal, health care or third-party payers) in cost estimations.
Studies were excluded if they were: (1) economic evaluations such as cost-effectiveness, cost-utility
or cost-benefit analyses; (2) reviews, notes, commentaries, or editorials related to obesity; or (3) COO
studies that included children aged <18 years and pregnant women; (4) Articles describing study
protocol or study design were likewise excluded.
2.3. Selection and Data Extraction
Following each search in the above mentioned databases, the initial hits were exported into
EndNote. After removing the duplicates, all titles and abstracts were screened to select the relevant
studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selection of the papers was done separately
by two of the co-authors (Maximilian Tremmel and Sanjib Saha) who then checked the comparability
of studies by reviewing a random sample of included and excluded studies after the initial screening.
After removing studies that met the exclusion criteria during the initial screening, the full text of the
remaining studies was assessed against the inclusion criteria and any differences were discussed and
a consensus was reached. A flow chart of the study selection procedure is presented in Figure 1.
Data were extracted on two issues: (1) the results; and (2) the methodology used to derive the
results. Other information was gathered as well, such as perspective, study time frame, sample size,
target group, inclusion of cost items, and discount rate. Moreover, we also collected information on
types of obesity-related co-morbidities included in the studies.

3. Results 
We included twenty-three studies in this review [29–31,35–54]. Detailed characteristics of these 
studies are presented in Table 1. Eleven studies [29,30,38–40,44–46,50,53,54] used a top-down 
(population-based) approach and eleven studies applied a bottom-up (person-based) approach 
[31,35–37,41–43,47,48,51,52] to calculate the costs attributable to obesity. The top-down approach 
estimates economic costs by using aggregate data on mortality, morbidity, hospital admissions, 
general practice consultations, disease-related costs, and other health-related indicators along with 
population attributable fraction (PAF) or population attributable risk (PAR) to calculate attributable 
costs [55–57]. The measures of PAF and/or PAR were used in seven studies [38,40,44–46,50,53], 
while four studies did not mention the approach to estimating the costs [29,30,39,41]. One study 
[54] used population attributable prevalence (PAP), which takes into account that risk factors and 
their relative risks (RRs) can change over time. 
The bottom-up approach calculates the resources used and productivity loss in individuals 
with the health problem in question, obesity in this case. The per-capita costs are then extrapolated 
to the whole population with the health problem, based on relevant epidemiological data [58]. The 
items that were included in the estimation of the patient-level data included drug medication in all 
twelve studies, but the other items, e.g., hospitalization costs, physician visit costs, inpatient and 
outpatient costs, varied across all studies. For example, whereas An [36] included out-of-pocket 
expenses, inpatient and outpatient costs, office-based medical provider services, emergency room 
services and medication, Effertz et al. [42] considered nursing costs, rehabilitation treatments, and 
financial compensations for job integrations, accidents, and medication. 
There were 17 studies from developed countries [31,35–37,39,41–49,51,52,54] and six studies 
from developing countries [29,30,38,40,50,53] according to the World Economic Situation and 
Figure 1. Flow chart depicting the process of the study selection for the systematic review.

varied across all studies. For example, whereas An [36] included out-of-pocket expenses, inpatient and
outpatient costs, office-based medical provider services, emergency room services and medication,
Effertz et al. [42] considered nursing costs, rehabilitation treatments, and financial compensations for
job integrations, accidents, and medication.
There were 17 studies from developed countries [31,35–37,39,41–49,51,52,54] and six studies
from developing countries [29,30,38,40,50,53] according to the World Economic Situation and
Prospects (WESP) report. According to the WESP and Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), there is no established convention for the designation of “developed” and
“developing” countries, but in common practice, Japan, Canada, the USA and European countries,
for example, are considered “developed” countries, while Mexico and Brazil are considered to be
“developing” countries [59]. There were six studies from Germany [42–44,46,47,54], six from the
USA [31,36,37,39,51,52], three from Brazil [30,38,40] and two from Canada [35,45].
In five studies [36,39,48,51,52] two-part models were used to calculate the health care expenses
attributable to obesity. In two-part models, the probability of the medical expenditures is calculated
first; thereafter it is multiplied by the amount of expenses conditional on the presence of these
expenses. A microsimulation model was designed and applied by Rtveladze et al. for Brazil [30]
and Mexico [29]. Both these studies employed the two-stage modelling process developed by the UK
Foresight working group [60] and results were simulated for three hypothetical scenarios (no BMI
reduction, a 1% reduction, or a 5% reduction in BMI across the population). The model predicted the
costs for Mexico to rise from US $806 million (2010) to US $1.7 billion in 2050. For Brazil, the costs were
estimated to increase from US $5.8 billion (2010) to US $10.1 billion (2050). Another microsimulation
model (Markov-based microsimulation) was developed by Su et al. [31], which predicted the 5-year
and 10-year total economic burden per capita attributable to obesity at US $33,900 and US $70,200
(2013), respectively.
Studies also varied in terms of inclusion of direct costs and indirect costs, i.e., in terms
of perspective of analysis (Table 1).
Direct medical costs include costs for the treatment and
management of the diseases, e.g., inpatient or outpatient care. Direct non-medical costs include,
e.g., transportation costs to health care providers. Indirect costs include early mortality costs and
morbidity costs due to sickness absence and informal care costs [13]. In six studies [42,44–46,50,53],
both direct and indirect costs were included and therefore a societal perspective was used. In twelve
studies [29,30,35,36,38–41,43,48,51,52] only direct costs were calculated and therefore a health care
perspective was used. However, one of these studies [43] described this method as a societal perspective
rather than a health care perspective.
Indirect costs only were calculated in two studies [47,49]. In a study from the USA [52], direct costs
were estimated from a third-party payer perspective and in another study from Germany [42] both
direct and indirect costs were estimated from a third-party payer perspective. The third-party payer
perspective includes insurance companies, governmental agencies, and employers. The Medicaid
perspective, a government programme financed by federal, state and local funds for persons of all ages
within certain income limits, was used in the U.S. study while in the German study, the perspective
of the “Techniker Krankenkasse” insurance company was used. The informal costs and informal
caregiver costs were included in only two studies [43,53].

We found a substantial variation in the items that were included while estimating the direct cost
(Table 1). For example, in one study from Brazil, by Bahia et al. [38], only inpatient and outpatient
costs were included for the estimation of the direct costs, while in another Brazilian study, by de
Oliveira et al. [40], costs for bariatric surgery, medication, orthotics, prosthetics, medical consultation
and diagnostic procedures were additionally included. There was also variation in the calculation
of indirect costs. Out of nine studies, in eight studies [42,44–47,49,50,53] researchers used the human
capital approach (HCA) to calculate the indirect costs. Neovius et al. used the friction cost approach
(FCA) as well as the HCA to estimate the indirect COO for Swedish men [49]. The HCA measures lost
production, in terms of lost earnings of a patient. For mortality or permanent disability costs, the HCA
multiplies the earnings lost at each age by the probability of living to that age [57]. In the FCA, only the
production losses during the time it takes to replace a worker [57] are measured. Andreyeva et al. used
average earnings to measure indirect costs [37].
We further gathered information on the obesity-related diseases included in each of the
studies listed in Table 2.
In 14 studies, researchers mentioned obesity-related diseases in the
cost calculation [29–31,35,38,40,44–47,50,52–54]. The costs of diabetes were included in all of these
14 studies, three of which [35,51,53] included both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
Additionally,
all of the studies, except one [35], considered CVDs. Therefore, diabetes and CVDs were the most
commonly considered comorbidities of obesity in the selected studies. In addition to diabetes and
CVDs regarded as comorbidities of obesity, both hypertension [29–31,35,38,40,44,46,47,50,53,54] and
cancer [29–31,37,40,44–46,50,52–54] were included in twelve studies. However, these studies differ
with regard to the type of cancer included in the cost analysis.

For example, Konnopka et al. [44] included neoplasms of the oesophagus, stomach, colon, liver,
gallbladder, pancreas, postmenopausal breast, cervix uteri, ovary, prostate, and kidney, non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukaemia, while Kang et al. [53] included only colon cancer among
the cancers. Furthermore, musculoskeletal disorders were considered in nine [29–31,38,40,45,50,53,54],
respiratory disorders in six [31,38,40,45,50,52] and digestive diseases in five studies [31,44–46,50].

Two studies estimated the obesity burden in Brazil from a health care perspective. Bahia et al. [38]
calculated the costs over 3 years from 2008 to 2010 to be US $1.1 billion per year and
de Oliveira et al. [40] gave the burden of obesity in 2010 as US $269.6 million. Both studies used
the PAF and a top-down approach. Bahia et al. [38] collected data from the national health database
from 2008 to 2010 and the costs reflected the average costs for 3 years. De Oliveira et al. [40] used
Ministry of Health Data to estimate the annual health care costs.
Konnopka et al. [44] used the concept of attributable fractions based on German prevalence data
and relative risks from US studies as well as statistics from the German Federal Statistics Office and
the German Retirement Insurance Office. These results were updated by Lehnert et al. [46] 6 years
later using the same method to calculate the cost burden. The total annual societal (direct and indirect)
costs due to obesity increased from €9.8 million in 2002 to €12.2 million in 2008. Another study from
Germany [42], using a different method based on claims data from a German health insurance company,
estimated the total costs for third-party payers to be €63.0 billion per year. Konig et al. [43] estimated
the average 3-month individual health care costs (also including informal care) in Germany to be
€1244 (2008) using questionnaire data from an 8-year follow-up contact of a large population-based
prospective cohort study titled “Epidemiologische Studie zu Chancen der Verhütung, Früherkennung
und optimierten Therapie chronischer Erkrankungen in der älteren Bevölkerung” (the ESTHER study).
Yet another German study [54] estimated the total national health care costs at €5.1 billion, using the
OBCOST tool to estimate incidence, prevalence and mortality (IPM) to calculate the COO.
For Canada, the annual societal costs were estimated to be CAD $1.0 billion, according to
Krueger et al. [45] using data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey. Kang et al. [53]
included 1,910,194 Korean individuals in their study to calculate the annual societal costs, which in 2005
amounted to US $1786 billion. Annual societal costs were also estimated in a study in Thailand [50] and
costs attributable to obesity were US $725.3 million in 2009. For Sweden, Neovius et al. [49] estimated
that the total lifetime productivity loss due to obesity was €95,400 per man in 2003. This study
was based on a 38-year follow-up of 45,920 Swedish men who were performing mandatory military
conscription tests at age 18.7 ± 0.5 years.
Direct per-capita costs of obesity were reported in seven studies [31,35–37,43,48,52] and indirect
per-capita costs were calculated in one study in Sweden [49]. When comparing the results of two
studies in the USA [36,39] estimating annual direct costs per capita, the costs increased from US
$2741 in 2005 to US $6899 in 2011. Both these studies used data from the Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey. Alter et al. [35] estimated the direct per-capita costs attributable to obesity over a time frame
of 11.5 years to be CAD $8294.67 (2006) while the direct per-capita costs over a lifetime (>65 years)
amounted to US $171,482 (2010) in the USA [52]. Total per-capita costs in the USA were predicted,
using a Markov-based microsimulation, to be US $33,900 and US $70,200 (2013) over a time frame of
5 and 10 years, respectively [31].
4. Discussion
In this paper, we have performed a systematic literature review of recent cost of obesity (COO)
studies. We have found that there is still a large heterogeneity across the available COO literature.
Although there is a substantial international literature on COO, we have found that a review and
synthesis of the results based on homogeneous methods and costing approaches is hindered by a wide
range of sources, as well as methodological approaches, perspectives, target groups and included
diseases, used to estimate the prevalence of obesity.
A key issue of COI studies is the PAF applied to calculate the fraction of costs attributable to
obesity. There are no agreed recommendations or guidelines on what fraction of the co-morbidities
can be attributed to obesity and what fraction can be attributed to the co-morbidities themselves.
Since obesity is a complex disease condition with much different co-morbidity, what fraction of the
co-morbidities is attributed to obesity has much influence on the cost calculation. The PAF is calculated
by using the RRs for co-morbidities related to obesity. In the literature review, we found different
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 435
11 of 18
methods for calculation of RRs and, subsequently, PAF. For example, Lette et al. [54] applied age- and
gender-specific RRs and used obesity-related co-morbidities from the Comparative Quantification of
Health Risks [61]. Bahia et al. [38] selected co-morbidities based on two conditions: firstly, those RRs
are ≥1.20 for diseases and secondly, that RRs are ≥1.10 but <1.20 for diseases that are a substantial
problem for public health due to high prevalence rate. The authors calculated the RRs by performing
meta-analyses. The different methods for calculation of PAF can lead to an over—or an underestimation
of costs attributable to obesity and can therefore make it difficult for comparison between studies.
Our literature review included studies that are based on different approaches for calculating the
disease burden of obesity (Table 1). Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. The top-down
approach is simple, transparent, and cheaper and faster than the bottom-up approach. A disadvantage
of the top-down approach is that all possible confounding variables need to be adjusted for when
estimating the PAF. For a complex disease such as obesity, this approach may underestimate or
overestimate the costs derived from co-morbidities. The bottom-up approach, on the other hand,
calculates the mean per-person costs, which are then extrapolated to the whole population. In this
case, the patient sample size needs to be unbiased and representative of the national population.
This might require extensive resources and may not be always practical (e.g., for estimating the
future cost) [62]. On the other hand, this approach is more comprehensive and valid, and enables
detection of the variability related to differences in important demographic characteristics between
patients [58]. Microsimulation models can predict the future cost and can incorporate data from other
countries, if data are missing in a specific case or if data from another country are known to be valid
and sufficiently reliable to be incorporated. A disadvantage of microsimulations is that a number of
assumptions are made that may or may not be valid; these assumptions have to be checked using
sensitivity analysis to evaluate how sensitive indicators can react to changes in input parameters.
This process makes the model complex and sometimes makes it difficult to understand [63].
The study by Lehnert et al. [46] aimed to update the study by Konnopka et al. [44] and used
the same method, perspective and target group in Germany. Therefore, these studies provide a good
picture of the increase in the societal COO in Germany, from €9.8 million in 2002 to €12.2 million in
2008. Researchers argued that the main driver behind the cost increases was the rise in the prevalence
of overweight and obesity in Germany between 2002 and 2008. This series of studies from Germany,
using the same methods to measure the COO, may provide a valid statement about the development of
COO between these two time points and gives a good example of how COO studies can be conducted
in a structured and valid way. Nevertheless, the costs estimated in these two studies differ crucially
from those reported by Krueger et al. [45] who used a similar approach to estimate the annual COO
in Canada. Although the population of Canada is less than half of the population of Germany,
these authors estimated the annual COO at CAD $1.0 billion. This variation in estimated costs can
be explained by the approaches to calculating the risk factor exposure of obesity. The two studies
from Germany used relative risks (RR) data from studies conducted in the USA to calculate the
PAF. Even though estimates of RR were adjusted for important confounders such as gender, age,
race and smoking status in both studies, transfer of costs to the German population causes uncertainty.
By contrast, the study from Canada used RR data from a previously conducted literature review on
studies of the general population of Western countries. Whereas Konnopka et al. [44] used German
prevalence data and RRs from the US studies, Krueger et al. [45] used self-reported data from the
Canadian Community Health Survey to calculate the risk factor exposure. Moreover, the two studies
included different diseases in the cost calculation. Krueger et al. [45] excluded hypertension while
Konnopka et al. [44] excluded respiratory and musculoskeletal disorders in the costing approach,
which may explain some of the variation in estimated costs.
We included three studies from Brazil which calculated direct COO. Bahia et al. [38] collected data
of the national health database from 2008 to 2010 and their estimated cost of US $1.1 billion reflects the
average of 3 years. De Oliveira et al. [40] also used a top-down approach with Ministry of Health data
to estimate the annual health care costs, which amounted to US $269.6 million. Rtveladze et al. [30]
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 435
12 of 18
used a microsimulation model (Monte Carlo simulation), which requires county-specific disease
incidence data, to predict health care costs from 2010 to 2050. Their results are limited by the lack of
country-specific incidence and, e.g., cancer mortality data, as they used data from the USA, which has
led to an overestimation of costs because Brazilian per capita health care spending is nearly eight times
lower compared with the USA. When comparing these three study results, several limitations have
to be pointed out: e.g., Bahia et al. [38] used RR data from countries other than Brazil since no data
were available based on Brazilian cohorts. In addition, obesity prevalence rates were obtained from
self-reported weight and height, which method may lead to either overestimation or underestimation
of costs attributable to obesity, when either too many or too few people are categorized as obese,
based on self-reported weight and height. On the other hand, de Oliveira et al. [40] used the PAR of
obesity to calculate the costs for morbid obesity, which can lead to an underestimation of costs; also,
they obtained RR data from cohort studies and meta-analyses published in international journals.
Consequently, the different data sources used to estimate the RR relevant for the cost calculation
need to be considered. When comparing these costs with costs in developed countries, it should be
borne in mind that the Brazilian public health system has a large unmet demand for bariatric surgery,
and consequently, that there may be an underestimation of COO in Brazil due to unmet needs [64].
Another characteristic of studies included in this review was the limited time frame of the analyses.
In only six studies [31,35,38,48,49,52] was the time frame of the analyses longer than 1 year. Su et al. [31]
reported per-capita costs in the USA over a time frame of 5 and 10 years. Alter et al. [35] investigated
a time frame of 11.5 years to estimate the cumulative per-capita costs. Additionally, a propensity score
matching method based on important confounders such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, smoking,
physical activity, psychosocial stress and comorbidity, and a sensitivity analysis were performed,
but the results did not change. Nevertheless, these results are limited by the exclusion of patients aged
65 and older, which may imply an underestimation of the costs and hinder a useful comparison with,
e.g., the study by Yang et al. [52], who calculated lifetime costs from 65 years onwards.
Some studies failed to incorporate a discount rate (Table 1) [29–31,35–41,43,45,47,48,51,52,54].
Discounting allows calculation of the present value of payments that will be made in the future and
should be applied when the duration of the analysis is longer than 1 year, otherwise the calculated costs
might overestimate the true costs. Effertz et al. [42] incorporated discounting in a 1-year time frame
of analysis, whereas for example Alter et al. [35] did not apply any discounting over a time frame of
11.5 years. Furthermore, the discount rates also vary among studies. Effertz et al. [42] used a discount
rate of 2% while Kang et al. [53] discounted the costs at a rate of 6%. Hence, the costs reported by
Effertz et al. [42] might overestimate the true costs, while the costs calculated by Kang et al. [53] might
underestimate them. There is no agreement on the discount rate to be used in the scientific literature,
although the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended using a 3% discount rate [65].
Moreover, it should be pointed out that only four studies [31,35,47,50] include costs for mental
disorders as a relevant obesity-related disease. According to Vigo et al. [66], the burden of mental
disorders still seems to be underestimated even though e.g., depression as a mental disorder is on the
rise globally, according to the WHO [67]. A recent systematic review [68] investigated the relationship
between obesity and depression among adult men and women. The results indicate that there is
a bidirectional relationship between obesity and depression. Consequently, excluding depression and
other mental disorders from the obesity-related diseases may lead to an underestimation of costs.
For example, the societal costs of depression in Germany were estimated at €15.6 billion per year [69].
The International Agency for Research into Cancer (IARC) [70] and the World Cancer Research
Fund (WCRF) [71] report that common cancers in obese people are endometrial, oesophageal, colorectal,
postmenopausal breast, prostate and renal cancer and adenocarcinoma. Less common malignancies
associated with obesity are malignant melanoma, thyroid cancers [72], leukaemia, non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, and multiple myeloma [73]. However, there was a crucial heterogeneity between the
studies that included different types of cancer.
Kang et al. [53] only included colon cancer as
an obesity-related disease, while Konnopka et al. [44] and Lehnert et al. [46] included stomach,
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 435
13 of 18
kidney, liver, gallbladder, cervix, ovary cancers and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma,
and leukaemia in addition to the common cancers in obese people mentioned by the IARC and WCRF.
Su et al. [31] included 16 different types of obesity-related cancers in their study. The reported costs due
to cancers need to be interpreted with the knowledge that different types of cancer were included in the
different studies, which may have led to over- or underestimation of costs. Due to the fact that cancers
create a big cost burden for society [74], there is a need for standardization when including cancers in
the obesity-related costs. Within the twelve studies that have mentioned the included obesity-related
diseases, one study, by Su et al. [31], included obesity-related liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver, which are also associated with
obesity [75,76]. For example, NAFLD, a very common chronic liver disease worldwide, is on the rise
following the trend of increasing prevalence of obesity, and is the second most common indication for
liver transplantation, and an important cause of hepatocellular carcinoma [77]. Also, hepatic steatosis
is known to be an associated comorbidity of obesity [78]. Consequently, we recommend considering
liver diseases when costs of obesity and related diseases are calculated.
We found three studies, from the USA [37], Germany [47] and Sweden [49], in which only
indirect costs due to obesity were calculated. While Andreyeva et al. [37] used overall average
earnings to calculate the costs, Lehnert et al. [47] and Neovius et al. [49] used the HCA. Therefore,
it has to be noted that using overall average earnings may overestimate average earnings for obese
workers, especially women, in light of evidence that obesity is associated with low socioeconomic
status [79]. Neovius et al. [49] state that using an FCA, compared with the HCA, reduced the estimated
productivity losses by about 80%. Therefore, it may be beneficial to calculate indirect costs both using
HCA and FCA approach.
Summarizing these results, we can state that obesity is responsible for a large fraction of costs, not
only to the health care system but also to society at large. As we stated previously, almost half of the
world’s adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030 if the prevalence continues on the current
trend [6] and consequently also the costs attributable to obesity will increase. A useful example for
rapidly rising costs attributable to obesity from these selected studies are the two mentioned studies
from Germany [44,46]. The results of the two papers together show that total societal costs in Germany
due to obesity have increased from €9.8 million to €12.2 million between 2002 and 2008. Therefore,
public health interventions should focus on the prevention of obesity as soon as possible, ideally at
a young age. A possible option would be to focus on work site health promotion (WHP) to increase
physical activity and healthy lifestyles at the workplace, especially as obesity has been found to be
associated with absenteeism, disability pension and overall work impairment [80]. Higher physical
activity at work may not only lead to a reduction in BMI and obesity, but also increase the health
status of the employees. This may in turn further reduce indirect costs due to absenteeism and
disability pension.
Furthermore, the definition of the various perspectives used in the studies should be discussed,
since the term “societal” as a perspective was used variously in different studies. The societal
perspective should include all costs (direct and indirect) except transfer payments (a shift of resources
such as social security benefits or Medicare or Medicaid payments) [57]. For example, Lehnert et al. [47]
and Neovius et al. [49] who only calculated indirect costs of obesity described theirs as a societal
perspective. Konig et al. [43] only estimated direct costs, yet also used the term “societal” to describe
their perspective.
A limitation of this review is that we only used Medline, Web of Science and Google Scholar to
search for studies, which may have limited the number of potentially eligible studies. In addition,
we only examined articles published in English. Furthermore, the absence of international standardized
methods and considerable heterogeneity between the study designs of these COO studies hinders
the completion of a comprehensive review. Another limitation of this study is that we did not aim
to perform a quality appraisal of the selected studies, also due to the fact that there are no validated
guidelines to perform a quality check for COI studies. Furthermore, we considered obesity to be a fixed
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 435
14 of 18
condition even though it has been discussed in the recent literature that obesity may be a transient
state, e.g., depending on age cohorts or period effects [81].
5. Conclusions
The studies under review show that obesity is responsible for a large fraction of costs, both for
health care systems and for society. Heterogeneity is a major limitation among the COI literature in
general and the COO literature in particular, which hinders a conclusive comparison of the different
studies. We recommend that obesity-related diseases and complications should be included more
consistently. We also recommend that additional obesity-related diseases be considered in further
COO studies, such as liver and mental diseases which have mostly been neglected so far.
