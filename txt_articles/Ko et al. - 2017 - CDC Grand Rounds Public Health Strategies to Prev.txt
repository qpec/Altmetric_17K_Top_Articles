Public Health Burden of Neonatal Abstinence 
Syndrome
Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a drug withdrawal 
syndrome that most commonly occurs in infants after in utero 
exposure to opioids, although other substances have also been 
associated with the syndrome (1). NAS usually appears within 
48–72 hours of birth with a constellation of clinical signs, 
including central nervous system irritability (e.g., tremors), 
gastrointestinal dysfunction (e.g., feeding difficulties), and 
temperature instability (1) (Box 1). Opioid exposure during 
pregnancy might result from clinician-approved use of prescrip-
tion opioids for pain relief; misuse or abuse of prescription 
opioids; illicit use (e.g., heroin); or medication-assisted treat-
ment (MAT) of opioid use disorder (2) (Box 2).
Opioid pain reliever sales quadrupled in the United States 
from 1999 to 2010. From 2000 to 2014, opioid-related over-
doses among U.S. adults increased 200% (3). Opioid use dur-
ing pregnancy has also increased nationally in recent years. The 
percentage of Medicaid-enrolled women who filled at least one 
opioid prescription during pregnancy increased 23% during 
2000–2010, from 18.5% to 22.8% (4). The prevalence of opioid 
abuse or dependence among pregnant women has increased from 
1.7 per 1,000 delivery admissions in 1998 to 3.9 in 2011 (5). 
Reflective of increasing maternal opioid exposure, the incidence 
of NAS has increased approximately 400% nationally, from 1.2 
per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 5.8 in 2012, with some 
states reporting rates in excess of 30 per 1,000 hospital births 
(6,7). By 2012, on average, one NAS-affected infant was born 
every 25 minutes in the United States (6).
Respiratory and feeding difficulties, low birth weight, and sei-
zures are more prevalent among infants with NAS (1). Care for 
infants with NAS has placed a substantial burden on hospitals, 
particularly on neonatal intensive care units. In 2012, a term infant 
without complications had a mean length of stay of 2.1 days and 
charge of $3,500; whereas, an infant with NAS had a mean hos-
pital stay of 16.9 days and a mean hospital charge of $66,700 (6). 
Aggregate hospital charges for all infants with NAS in 2012 were 
estimated to be $1.5 billion; approximately 80% was financed 
by Medicaid programs (6). Public health measures to prevent 
and treat opioid dependence before and during pregnancy are 
essential to reducing the incidence of NAS and its related health 
care burden. Strategies include promoting responsible opioid pre-
scribing, decreasing unplanned pregnancies among women who 
abuse opioids, screening and treatment during pregnancy, and 
standardizing postnatal treatment for infants with NAS (Figure).
Prevention and Intervention Strategies
Primary prevention. Strategies to prevent the incidence of 
NAS center on responsible opioid prescribing and access to 
preconception care and family planning services (Figure). The 
2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain (8) 
recommends that clinicians address the unique sensitivities of 
prescribing opioid medications to pregnant women and non-
pregnant women of reproductive age. Recommended actions 
include discussing how long-term opioid use might affect current 
and future pregnancies and how women of reproductive age with 
a need for long-term opioid use can avoid unintended pregnancy. 
Clinicians and patients together should carefully weigh risks and 
benefits when deciding whether to initiate opioid therapy for 
chronic pain during pregnancy. Other specific recommendations 
for women of reproductive age include considering nonopioid 
pharmacologic therapy for chronic pain management and pre-
scribing the lowest effective dose when opioids are started. As of 
March 2016, the Food and Drug Administration requires both 
sustained and immediate-release opioid medication to include 
a black box warning, informing patients that prolonged opioid 
use during pregnancy might lead to NAS.
Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are an 
important public health tool to support responsible opioid pre-
scribing. PDMPs are state-based databases that track controlled 
prescription drugs dispensed by pharmacies and allow prescribers 
to review a patient’s prescription history before prescribing. Every 
state except Missouri has implemented a PDMP (9). Preliminary 
research suggests that PDMPs have been associated with a 
reduction in opioid-related deaths in the general population 
(9). Successful application of PDMPs requires that prescribing 
health care providers are both aware of and regularly use the 
PDMP database (9). However, barriers, such as provider time

BOX 2. Opioid exposures associated with neonatal abstinence syndrome
Central nervous system irritability
• Prescription pain relievers, such as Vicodin, 
OxyContin, Percocet
• Illicit substances: heroin or nonpharmaceutical 
formulations of fentanyl
• Opioid-assisted maintenance therapy (also known as 
medication-assisted treatment): long-term treatment 
for opioid use disorder, under medical supervision, 
with a longer-acting but less euphoric opioid
 
– Methadone or buprenorphine is recommended 
by the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists during pregnancy
constraints and lack of data integration into electronic medical 
records, might prevent universal adoption of PDMPs by health 
care providers. CDC continues to fund states for prescription 
drug overdose prevention activities, including maximizing 
PDMP use and improving timeliness of data availability.*
Another primary prevention strategy that might reduce 
the incidence of NAS is ensuring access to family planning 
and preconception care for women who use opioids. Among 
women who abuse opioids, 86% of pregnancies are unintended 
(10). CDC and the Office of Population Affairs of the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services recommend that 
health care providers support family planning services, which 
include preconception services, pregnancy intention screening, 
and contraceptive counseling to prevent unintended pregnancy 
by increasing access to the full range of contraceptive methods, 
including long-acting reversible contraception (e.g., intrauter-
ine devices and implants) (11).
Two national initiatives encourage clinicians to practice 
responsible prescribing and help women of reproductive age 
optimize their health before pregnancy. CDC’s Treating for 
Two: Safer Medication Use in Pregnancy initiative† encourages 
evidence-based prescribing practices and informed decision-
making specifically for pregnant women and for nonpreg-
nant women of reproductive age. The second, the National 
Preconception Health and Health Care Initiative,§ provides 
educational resources to clinicians and their patients, and 
coordinates outreach and social media campaigns related to 
improving preconception health, including reducing substance 
use and treating substance use disorders before pregnancy.
Intervention strategies and treatment for women with opi-
oid use disorder. Provision of treatment for pregnant women 
with opioid use disorder is important. Medically supervised 
tapering of opioids in pregnant women is associated with high 
relapse rates as compared to methadone maintenance (2). The 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) and the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists recommend that pregnant women with opioid 
use disorder receive MAT with methadone or buprenorphine 
(2,12). SAMHSA’s Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment 
block grants have recently been revised to strengthen capacity 
to deliver MAT for pregnant women with substance use disor-
ders. It is important that clinical providers evaluate concurrent 
substance use (e.g., tobacco) and common maternal psychiatric 
(e.g., depression) and infectious (e.g., hepatitis C) comorbidi-
ties of opioid use disorder (13). In addition, clinical providers 
should anticipate that infants born to women receiving MAT 
might have NAS (8). Collaboration with pediatric care teams 
is necessary to assess infants with in utero opioid exposure for 
signs of NAS and provide appropriate treatment.
Strategies to mitigate the effects of NAS. Improvements in 
the identification of infants at risk and standardized treatment 
of infants with NAS could greatly mitigate the effects of NAS 
and the associated health care burden. To enable state health 
departments identify and provide interventions to areas with 
high NAS incidence, four states (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, 
and Tennessee) have designated NAS a reportable condition.
Treatment of NAS begins with nonpharmacological strate-
gies, such as minimizing environmental stimuli (e.g., place-
ment in a dark, quiet space), careful swaddling, and, in the 
absence of other contraindications, breastfeeding. In addition,

FIGURE. Specific strategies to reduce the health care burden of neonatal abstinence 
syndrome (NAS), by population impact
severe NAS requires tapered dosages of morphine or methadone 
as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, to ease 
infants’ withdrawal, coupled with nonpharmacologic strategies (1). 
Further, recent studies have found that hospital-level strategies, 
including rooming-in, rather than infant placement in neonatal 
intensive care units, increased family involvement during hospi-
talization (14), and standardized opioid-weaning guidelines (15), 
were associated with shorter lengths of hospital stay for infants with 
NAS. A multicenter quality improvement study aimed at stan-
dardization of hospital care for infants with NAS demonstrated 
that implementation of standardized procedures for assessing 
infants at risk and treating infants with NAS decreased both their 
length of hospital stay and need for pharmacological treatment 
(16). State perinatal quality collaboratives are networks of perinatal 
care providers and public health professionals working together to 
advance evidence-based clinical practices and processes through 
quality improvement. Quality improvement projects addressing 
the care of infants with NAS are ongoing.¶
Barriers to prevention and treatment. As a part of com-
plete obstetric care, The American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists recommends that all pregnant women be 
routinely asked about their substance use, including prescrip-
tion opioids and other medications used for nonmedical reasons 
(2). Despite the importance of detecting substance use disorders 
among pregnant women to offer timely treatment, there is

little consensus regarding the best screening 
tool to identify substance use among pregnant 
women, the best time during pregnancy to 
screen, and whether biologic specimens should 
be used in conjunction with or in lieu of ver-
bal screening. To address the need for reliable 
substance use screening during pregnancy, 
CDC is currently funding a three-site research 
study to assess the performance of five differ-
ent substance use screening tools for pregnant 
women (NIH RePORT Project number: 
5R21DP006082–02).
Stigma, provider bias, and legal consequences 
pose additional barriers to screening and 
subsequent identification of women in need 
of treatment. Screening for substance abuse 
during pregnancy and compliance with legally 
mandated reporting might be subject to provider 
bias in contrast to adherence to objective medical 
criteria (17). Furthermore, legal ramifications for 
maternal substance use vary by state. Eighteen 
states classify maternal substance use as child 
abuse and three states consider it grounds for 
involuntary hospitalization.** Conversely, 19 
states provide specialized drug treatment pro-
grams for pregnant women, 13 states prioritize pregnant women 
in state-funded drug treatment programs, and four states legally 
prohibit discrimination against pregnant women who seek sub-
stance abuse treatment. The impacts of these varied state legisla-
tions on prenatal care attendance, disclosure of substance use, and 
treatment seeking or receipt are unclear.
Federal Legislation and Awareness
Two recent legislative initiatives and a nationwide call to 
action address maternal opioid use and NAS. The Protecting 
Our Infants Act of 2015†† stipulates that the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services conduct a review of intra-
agency work related to NAS and prenatal opioid exposure to 
identify gaps or overlap in research or programs and to provide 
technical assistance to states and American Indian tribes when 
implementing public health measures, including NAS surveil-
lance systems. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery 
Act of 2016§§ extends the federal grant program for state-based 
PDMPs and support for various substance use disorder treat-
ment services for pregnant women and infants.
In addition, the U.S. Surgeon General’s Turn the Tide cam-
paign¶¶ calls for clinicians to treat pain safely and effectively,

screen patients for opioid use disorder, and provide or connect 
them with evidence-based treatment, and recognize and treat 
addiction as a chronic illness, and not a moral failing.
Conclusion
NAS is an often hidden consequence of the opioid epidemic. 
The incidence of NAS has increased sharply over the last 
decade and is associated with substantial health care expen-
ditures. Responsible opioid prescribing practices, including 
use of PDMPs, and increased availability of preconception 
health services are vital primary prevention strategies. Access 
to treatment for maternal opioid use disorder and standard-
ized treatment for infants with NAS might further decrease 
the effects of NAS.
