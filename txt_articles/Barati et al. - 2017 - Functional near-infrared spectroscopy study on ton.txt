Abstract. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has recently been suggested for monitoring cortical
hemodynamic response to experimental and clinical acute pain. However, the hemodynamic response to a tonic,
noxious cold stimulus, and its relation with subjective pain sensation is not fully characterized. We investigated
the relationship between pain threshold and tolerance and the evoked hemodynamic response to cold pressor
tests (CPTs) at varying intensities and explored the gender effect. Twenty-one healthy individuals (10 males and
11 females) performed four CPTs at 1°C, 5°C, 10°C, and 15°C. Deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) and oxyhemoglobin
(HbO2) were measured continuously on the forehead by two “far” and two “near” channels in addition to pain
scores, threshold, and tolerance. We found a significant within-subject correlation between pain threshold and
the immediate HbO2 response at the right frontal region. Gender difference and asymmetrical activation were
observed in the “far” channels but not the “near” channels, suggesting a hemispheric preference in response to
noxious cold stimuli. No gender difference was found in pain threshold, tolerance, or scores. This research adds
to the body of literature suggesting the use of fNIRS for bedside assessment of pain in addition to behavioral and
subjective measures for comprehensive, multimodal pain management. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Introduction
Recent progress in brain imaging using advanced modalities
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed activation of brain
regions during a physical or psychological experience of pain.1–6
Several studies have found a relationship between the intensity
of perceived pain and the neuronal activation in several cortical
areas.3,7–11 While neuroimaging modalities exploring neural
basis for nociception have advanced our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms and have had great impact on basic sci-
ence, they are not yet accepted for routine clinical examinations
mainly due to the cost and limited accessibility.
Alternatively, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
has recently been suggested for monitoring cortical hemo-
dynamic response to experimentally and clinically induced
acute pain in adults and infants.12–28 fNIRS is an optical imaging
tool for noninvasive, continuous monitoring of regional blood
flow and tissue oxygenation.29–31 This imaging technique offers
several advantages over other hemodynamic-based imaging
techniques including being portable and noninvasive, no ioniz-
ing radiation or drug injection, measuring two hemodynamic
parameters—deoxyhemoglobin
(HHb)
and
oxyhemoglobin
(HbO2)—simultaneously, and relative robustness to motion arti-
fact, which is desirable for the study of infants, small children, or
elders with involuntary movement disorders.
To establish the suitability of fNIRS for bedside assessment
of pain, it is essential to validate this technique using various
noxious modalities and with different populations of patients.32
fNIRS studies of experimental models of pain in healthy adults
have employed a variety of noxious stimuli, including hot
plates,14,15,18 pressure,17 and electrical stimulus.16,19 However,
the response to cold water stimulus is not well studied. Cold
pressor pain, induced by submergence of the hand in cold water,
is a well-validated test that is suggested to effectively mimic the
pain of chronic diseases because of the higher level of unpleas-
antness that it evokes.33
We previously employed fNIRS to study the effect of
repeated exposure to an ice water stimulus (0°C)12 and showed
that: (1) an ice water stimulus evoked robust and reproducible
hemodynamic responses at both the skin and cortical levels;
(2) the hemodynamic responses as well as the subjective pain
rating scores reported after each stimulus adapted to repeated
exposures; and (3) there was a significant within-subject corre-
lation between the reported pain and the fNIRS signal. The
objective of the present research was to identify the relationship
between pain threshold and tolerance and the evoked hemo-
dynamic response to cold pressor tests (CPTs) at varying inten-
sities and to explore whether there is a gender effect. We
employed CPTat variable temperatures of water and we hypoth-
esized that subjective pain sensation is proportional to the ampli-
tude of the evoked hemodynamic response at any given water
temperature. Based on previous research reporting gender differ-
ence in pain sensation34 or hemodynamic activation,35–39 we
speculated that tolerance to CPT and the associated evoked
hemodynamic activation are lower in females.

 2.1
Sample
Twenty-one right-handed individuals of both sexes (10 males
and 11 females) were recruited from the Drexel University com-
munity. Subjects claimed no history of neurological or psycho-
logical disorders nor use of any medication. They attended an
orientation session at least one day prior to the actual experiment
when they received detailed information on the experimental
protocol and signed the informed consent. During orientation,
subjects performed a CPT at 1°C in the real experimental setting
to minimize anxiety associated with initial exposure to noxious
cold water. Subjects were asked to refrain from smoking and
drinking alcohol at least 3 h prior to the experiment.
2.2
Procedure
Four CPTs at different temperatures of water, i.e., 15°C, 10°C,
5°C, and 1°C, were employed to generate low, moderate, and
severe pain levels. Pioneering work on using CPT for pain study
by Wolf and Hardy40 suggested that pain threshold to cold water
is at 18°C. Any decrease in water temperature is reported to be
proportional to increase in pain score. The cold water temper-
atures in this research were chosen accordingly to induce differ-
ent levels of pain.
For each trial of CPT, a baseline was recorded for 30 s, then
subjects were told to immerse their right hand up to the wrist in
tepid water (∼23°C) for 2 min for adaptation. Then, the experi-
menter verbally asked subjects to submerge the same hand in a
constant temperature bath (15°C, 10°C, 5°C, or 1°C) for as long
as they could tolerate the stimulated pain but no more than
5 min. During each experiment, numerical rating scales on a
0 to 10 scale (NRS-11)—where “0” indicates no pain and “10”
indicates the worst imaginable pain—were recorded every 15 s
in addition to pain threshold (when the first pain was felt) and
tolerance (when the pain intensity became intolerable).41 There
was at least half an hour rest period between trials. A block dia-
gram of the protocol is shown in Fig. 1.
The cold and tepid water containers were equipped with
commercial aquarium pumps to circulate water and minimize
heat buildup around the immersed hand. The cold water con-
tainer had a separate compartment for ice cubes to prevent
any direct contact of the subject’s skin with ice.
2.3
Instrument
fNIRS is an optical imaging modality that exploits visible light
at NIR range (650 to 950 nm), also termed the optical window.
A photodetector placed at a certain distance from the light
source detects the back-scattered light after it has passed a
banana-shape pathway. The depth of light penetration is a func-
tion of the distance between the light source and photodetector
(S–D): the larger the S–D, the deeper the light penetration. By
choosing two appropriate S–Ds, one can sample absorption
changes in a short pathway through superficial tissues and in
a large pathway scanning deeper tissues within the head.
Several theoretical and experimental studies have investigated
depth-dependent changes in absorption using different S–D
separations.42–44 We used two S–D separations: 1 cm (“near”
channel) and 2.8 cm (“far” channel). Each probe had one
“near” channel and two “far” channels. The “near” channel mea-
sured the hemodynamic response at the extracerebral layers
while the “far” channels measured a superimposition of the
hemodynamic changes within the extracerebral layers and the
cortical tissue [Fig. 2(b)].
We employed the continuous wave fNIRS system (730 and
850 nm) developed at Drexel University.45–47 Our fNIRS device
had three main units: (1) two flexible fNIRS probes, each con-
sisting of one multiwavelength light emitting diode and three
photodetectors, (2) a control box for operating the hardware,
and (3) a computer running the COBI Studio software48 for
data acquisition and visualization. The two fNIRS probes
were placed symmetrically on the subjects’ forehead to measure
relative changes in HHb and HbO2 throughout the experiment
[Fig. 2(a)].12 Although the “pain matrix” encompasses multiple
regions of the cerebral cortex, we chose to study the frontal
region because of the ease of measurements on the forehead.
2.4
Data Analysis
To eliminate high-frequency noise, respiration, and heart pulsa-
tion artifacts, raw intensity measurements were first filtered by a
finite-impulse response low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency
set to 0.14 Hz, which was chosen based on the literature.49
Changes in the concentrations of HHb and HbO2 were calcu-
lated relative to the mean value of the optical intensity during
the first 15 s of the prestimulus baseline recording. The HHb
and HbO2 data were then smoothed using a spline basis expan-
sion by imposing a penalty on the roughness of the second
derivative of the data with a smoothing parameter (λ) of 300,
which was chosen by visual judgment and prior knowledge
of the process.50 An objective, data-driven method is also devel-
oped using the generalized cross-validation (GCV) measure51
and an optimum λ minimizes GCVðλÞ function plotted against
log10λ. GCV is the most popular procedure for selecting an opti-
mal value for the smoothing parameter. However, like other
cross-validation methods, GCV tends to under-smooth the data.
For this study, λ was chosen empirically because the GCV plot
resembled a sigmoid function which was not informative.52

Barati, Zakeri, and Pourrezaei: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy study on tonic pain activation. . .
 Based on our previous study,12,52 we defined the following
outcome measures: (1) the maximum change in HHb and
HbO2 in response to a cold water stimulus, which may occur dur-
ing or a few seconds after the stimulus, relative to the prestimulus
value—hereafter referred to as ΔHHb and ΔHbO2; (2) maximum
rate of change of HbO2 with respect to time, which occurs within
a few seconds after hand immersion in cold water, calculated as
the maximum value of the first derivative function—hereafter
referred to as _
mðHbO2Þ. This variable was not calculated for
HHb due to the high variability of the response. We speculated
that _
mðHbO2Þ variable is best associated with pain threshold as
both variables are measured immediately after the hand immer-
sion in cold water. HHb and HbO2 outcome measures of the two
“far” channels for each probe were averaged.
We used linear mixed effects models for the statistical analy-
sis of HHb and HbO2.53,54 Linear mixed models provide a flex-
ible and powerful approach for the analysis of repeated
measures. Repeated measures data involve multiple observa-
tions on the same subject across a repeated factor, which is tem-
perature here. These repeated measurements are likely to be
correlated, therefore, any model fit requires parameter estima-
tion of the covariance structure. Unlike classical repeated mea-
sures analysis of variance (ANOVA), which assumes the
sphericity of the covariance matrix, linear mixed models
allow a wide selection on the form of the variance-covariance
matrix, which provides efficiency and flexibility. In a linear
mixed model approach, the dependent variable is modeled as
a combination of population characteristics, called fixed effects,
and subject specific effects that are unique to a particular indi-
vidual, called random effects. In our model, we included depth
(“far” and “near”), side of the measurements (left and right), and
gender as the fixed main effects and channel by side, channel by
gender, and channel by side by gender as the interactions. We
allowed different intercepts and slopes for individuals’ regres-
sion lines across temperatures.
For subjective measures of pain, we analyzed the pain thresh-
old, pain tolerance, and maximum pain score reported during the
stimulus.
All signal processing calculations were performed in
MATLAB (R2011a, MathWorks, Natwick, Massachusetts),
and the smoothing was performed using the functional data
analysis package for MATLAB.50 Statistical analyses were
conducted using the IBM SPSS Statistics 19. The significance
criterion was α < 0.05 for all analyses. Post hoc pairwise com-
parisons were adjusted by Sidak criterion.

Results
3.1
Subjective Reports of Pain
Friedman’s ANOVA by ranks revealed a significant difference
in the median value of the pain threshold [Fig. 3(a)], tolerance
[Fig. 3(b)], and maximum pain score [Fig. 3(c)] with respect to
temperature [χ2ð3Þ ¼ 42.43, p-value < 0.001; χ2ð3Þ ¼ 23.73,
p-value < 0.001; and χ2ð3Þ ¼ 31.97, p-value < 0.001, respec-
tively]. Post hoc Wilcoxon signed ranks tests adjusted by
Bonferroni criterion yielded that:
1. Pain thresholds at 1°C and 5°C were not different but as
the water temperature increased to 10°C and 15°C, the
pain threshold significantly increased as well.
2. Pain tolerance at 1°C was significantly lower than the
tolerance at higher temperatures (i.e., 5°C, 10°C, and
15°C). No significant difference was found between tol-
erances at 5°C, 10°C, and 15°C.
3. Maximum pain score reported during the CPT decreased
significantly with increase in water temperature.
We did not find any gender difference in the pain tolerance,
pain threshold, or maximum pain score.

HHb and HbO2
Descriptive statistics of the outcome variables ΔHHb, ΔHbO2,
and _
mðHbO2Þ are provided in the Appendix. For HbO2, we
found a three-way interaction between “gender, side, and
depth (channel)” and a two-way interaction between “side
and depth” (Table 1 and Fig. 4). A two-way interaction between
“gender and depth” and significant main effects of temperature,
side, and depth were found for HHb and HbO2, whereas a sig-
nificant main effect of gender was found only for HbO2
(Table 1).

Gender difference
Gender difference was observed at the “far” channels (ΔHHb∶
p-value ¼ 0.02 for the right “far” channel; ΔHbO2∶p-value ¼
0.001 for the right “far” channel and _
mðHbO2Þ∶p-value <
0.001 and 0.03 for the right and left “far” channels, respec-
tively), whereas no gender difference was found at the “near”
channels (Fig. 4). Moreover, males showed a depth-specific
response (i.e., significantly different responses at the “far”
and “near” channels) on the right side [ΔHHb, ΔHbO2, and
_
mðHbO2Þ∶p-value < 0.001], whereas females did not.
3.2.2
Asymmetrical response
Asymmetrical hemodynamic activity was observed in HHb
response for males (ΔHHb∶p ¼ 0.009) and in HbO2 for both
genders [ΔHbO2∶p-value < 0.001 and p-value ¼ 0.001 for the
males and females, respectively;
_
mðHbO2Þ∶p-value < 0.001
and p-value ¼ 0.008 for the males and females, respectively]
at the “far” channels, whereas no asymmetry was observed at
the “near” channels.
3.3
Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant within-
subjects correlation between the pain threshold and _
mðHbO2Þ
measured on the right side (right “near” channel: R ¼ 0.44,
p-value < 0.05, right “far” channel: R ¼ 0.46, p-value <
0.05). When calculated for males and females separately, the
correlation was significant for males (right “near” channel: R ¼
0.80, p-value < 0.01, right “far” channel: R ¼ 0.77, p-value <
0.01) but not for females (right “near” channel: R ¼ 0.40,
t-value¼1.3011, right “far” channel: R¼0.48, t-value ¼ 1.6511).

Discussion
In this fNIRS study, we investigated the relationship between
subjective measures of pain—i.e., pain threshold and toler-
ance—and the evoked hemodynamic response to CPTs at vary-
ing intensities and explored the gender effect. We showed that
pain threshold was significantly correlated with the immediate
evoked hemodynamic response [i.e., _
mðHbO2Þ]. We also found
gender difference and asymmetry in the superimposed cortical
and extracerebral hemodynamic response measured by “far”
channels but not in the extracerebral hemodynamic activity.
Statistical analysis of the amplitude and rate of change of the
evoked hemodynamic response yielded significant ipsilateral
activation in the “far” channels, whereas no laterality was
found in the “near” channels. This laterality suggests a hemi-
spheric preference in response to noxious cold stimuli, which
was unilateral to the stimulus. This finding is consistent with
a PET study using CPT at 6°C (Ref. 1) where an ipsilateral

 increase in the regional cerebral blood flow in the lateral pre-
frontal cortex (Brodmann’s areas 10 and 46) was observed.
Also, an fMRI study showed bilateral prefrontal and ipsilateral
dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) activation in response to hot and
cold plates stimuli.5 It was reported that cold stimulus evoked
larger brain regions and these two pain modalities (hot and cold)
were significantly different in the frontal lobe. A 133Xe SPECT
study of CPT, however, found contralateral increase of blood
flow in the frontal lobe.55
We also showed gender difference at the “far” channels in
response to painful cold stimulation with lower activation in
females. Gender differences in cerebral activation in response to
experimental and clinical noxious stimuli have been studied
using advanced neuroimaging modalities.56–63 Despite identifying
some gender differences in cerebral activation, there seems to be
variability in activation and deactivation patterns across studies.
The three following neuroimaging studies found gender differ-
ence in response to noxious stimuli in the prefrontal cortex. In an
fMRI study, Moulton et al.60 discovered gender differences in
BOLD signal in response to noxious contact heat stimuli.
They observed that women show significantly more voxels with
negative signal change than men in the primary somatosensory
and DLPF cortices that may be in part explained by gender
differences in baseline BOLD signal. In a PET study, Derbyshire
et al.58 found significantly larger activation in males than
females in response to equalized laser stimulation in several con-
tralateral areas including prefrontal, primary, and secondary
somatosensory cortices. Gender differences in medial prefrontal
cortex activation in response to subthreshold and intense elec-
trical stimulation were observed in an fMRI research showing a
stronger activity in women.63 These studies and our research
suggest that the prefrontal cortex may play an important role
in mediating gender differences in the neurophysiological
response to painful stimulation.
Moreover, we did not find any gender difference in the skin
hemodynamic response. In addition, females did not show depth-
dependent activation. This may be justified by the much smaller
cortical response in females. Thus, a larger sample size may be
required to detect any depth-dependent response in females.
Another notable finding of this study was detecting a signifi-
cant correlation between the pain threshold and the maximum
rate of change in HbO2 response immediately after hand immer-
sion in cold water measured on the right frontal region. The size
of correlation was large for males and medium for females,
which again may be explained by the smaller hemodynamic
response in females.
The study of association between the trajectories of the
hemodynamic response and the pain scores reported every
15 s is published elsewhere (Fig. 5).64 In summary, a pattern
of adaptation of the hemodynamic response to the cold water

 stimulus was seen for all temperatures; i.e., HHb∕HbO2 sharply
decreased/increased upon hand immersion in cold water and
after peaking at around 1 min, they slowly increased/decreased
to return to their prestimulus values. On the other hand, the sub-
jective pain scores followed the evoked hemodynamic trajectory
within the first minute of the CPT and then tended to remain
around the peak value throughout the CPT.
4.1
Caveats
First, we understand that the cortical response to CPT is largely
confounded by the extracerebral activation given the substantial
systemic changes in the skin blood flow. The evoked hemo-
dynamic response measured at the “near” channels is associated
with the systemic blood flow changes in the extracerebral layers
(e.g., skin and meninges), mainly due to task-induced changes in
heart rate and blood pressure; whereas the response measured by
the “far” channels is a superimposition of the skin and cortical
hemodynamic activation. The origin of the evoked hemodynamic
response at the cortical level is unknown to us since the noci-
ceptive component and the autonomic aspect of the response are
convoluted. We speculate that it originates from either the
evoked local neurovascular coupling secondary to functional

head and the numeric rating scales (NRS-11) reported every 15 s for the CPTs (CPT) at (a) 1°C and

 brain activity or the evoked systemic cerebral blood flow
changes due to cardiovascular reactions such as heart rate and
blood pressure variations.
Second, we used water stimulus at 15°C, which is close to cold
pain threshold, to elicit less autonomic response. However, our
results showed significantly different responses at the skin and
the cortex regardless of the water temperature. It seems that dis-
sociation of the nociceptive and autonomic elements of response
requires careful control of the experiment, e.g., by including
innocuous challenges for autonomic arousal and then, isolating
its response from the cortical nociceptive processing. In an effort
to evoke a pure autonomic response, Harper et al.65 used the
Valsalva maneuver and found significant activation in a number
of brain regions including the medial and orbital prefrontal cortex
that are activated in response to CPT as well. Their observation
suggests that the evoked hemodynamic response to the CPTs in
the prefrontal cortex may be due to autonomic nervous system
activation. Thus, because cold noxious stimulus evokes substan-
tial cardiovascular reaction, careful adjustment of the experi-
ment’s parameters is warranted to differentiate nociceptive
processing and autonomic reaction to the CPT challenge.
Third, in our study, we could not find any gender difference
in either the pain tolerance or the pain threshold; although gen-
der difference in perception and expression of pain has been
widely addressed in literature.66 Reports on gender differences
in cold pain tolerance are more prevalent than cold pain thresh-
old. Several studies have shown that women are more sensitive
to cold pain than men are. A comprehensive survey of literature
on gender differences in pain perception during 1998 to 2008
found that 80% of CPT studies showed that females tolerate sig-
nificantly less pain than males.67 Another review noted that only
one study (which included 15 male and 19 female participants)
out of 23 did not show a gender difference in cold tolerance.66 It
is suggested that considering the moderate effect size of thresh-
old and tolerance, a sample of 41 subjects for each gender group
is needed to reach adequate power.68 We acknowledge that the
sample size of our study was small (10 males, 11 females) thus,
our study may lack enough power to catch the gender
differences in cold pain tolerance which is reported in the liter-
ature. Nonetheless, since males and females’ subjective reports
of pain are comparable in our sample, it is plausible to compare
their fNIRS signal under the condition of equivalent pain
perception.
The observed gender difference in hemodynamic activation
could be due to differences in anatomy, cortical processing,
or autonomic regulation. There are some evidences for
gender differences in the cerebral blood volume changes during
a cognitive task39 and in the regulation of sympathetic nervous
system.69 However, because we did not do any structural
imaging or hormonal test, we cannot make any deterministic
statement.
Finally, we did not have access to an automatic blood pres-
sure recorder to monitor blood pressure during the CPTs. We ran
similar analyses on the total hemoglobin (HbO2 þ HHb) and
found the same results as HbO2, mainly because the amplitude
of HbO2 response is considerably larger than HHb thus, the total
hemoglobin response is vastly dominated by HbO2 response.

Potential Applications and Future Direction
fNIRS application for the assessment of pain is very recent but
the literature shows a fast growing interest in such a novel
solution.32 Under the assumption of reliable, self-reporting
in healthy subjects, we can study the deviations of the discov-
ered hemodynamic markers from normal values in case of an
ailment or under influence of drugs such as morphine (e.g.,
morphine is shown to aggravate pain sensitization). At least
four studies in adults20–22,70 and five studies in infants23–27
have used fNIRS in a clinical setting during a painful clinical
intervention. It is crucial to report any pharmacologic treat-
ments during experimental or clinical pain studies. For exam-
ple, it has been reported that administration of morphine in
critically ill infants was associated with significantly less
changes in HbO2 compared with those who did not receive
any analgesic medication.27 Gelinas et al.20 also reported
that changes in regional oxygen saturation values during the
insertion of intravenous line and arterial line were lower in
patients who received morphine compared with those who
did not. More studies with specific target populations such
as elderly and cognitively impaired are needed to test the val-
idity and reproducibility of fNIRS for pain assessment.
Some suggested applications of the technique proposed here
include: (1) assessment of the preoperative sensitivity to CPT
and its association with postoperative pain,71 (2) study of spon-
taneous pain under natural conditions like walking and talking,
(3) examination of young children and elderly who would not
stay still in a magnet or a PET scanner, (4) assessment of
patients that are under heavy sedation or muscular blocking
agents since the sedating agents significantly reduce pain behav-
iors, and (5) study of factors modulating the pain tolerance, such
as long-term opioid use, drug abuse, smoking, and alcohol
drinking. For instance, CPT has long been used to assess the
opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH).72 The affordability and
ease of use of fNIRS can provide a scheme for longitudinal mon-
itoring of OIH development.
We suggest the use of fNIRS together with a complemen-
tary technique such as EEG for improving spatial and temporal
resolutions, in addition to behavioral and subjective measures,
for a comprehensive, multidimensional pain assessment.
Although current fNIRS measurements are subjected to a num-
ber of limitations including low spatial resolution (∼1 cm),
limited depth of penetration (0.5 to 2 cm), and signal contami-
nation by physiological noise, technical advancement in
hardware and software may improve these factors in future.
In particular, isolating the cortical response may help in devel-
oping neurofeedback frameworks that aim to design personal-
ized treatments using an individual’s own data for self-
regulation. Techniques for separation of superficial hemo-
dynamic response from the cortical activity are based on the
assumption that responses measured by the near and far opto-
des are independent of each other; i.e., the near channel mea-
sures a global physiological inference which is independent
of the task-evoked response measured by the far channel.
This assumption is violated in the CPT as the task evokes a
large systemic response in addition to a cortical nociceptive
response. Further research is needed to address this important
signal processing challenge.
Finally, the bilateral activation at the “far” and “near” chan-
nels observed in our study showed very similar trends of change
through the time course of the experiment. Time-series analysis
of fNIRS parameters was not conducted here. Given the fact that
the autonomic response fairly quickly adapts to the stimulus
while the pain perception may last for the entire duration of
immersion, analysis of the dynamics of the hemodynamic
response may unravel some interesting mechanisms.52
