ABSTRACT
Objective
To evaluate the associations of a polygenic risk score 
and healthy lifestyle with incident stroke.
Design
Prospective population based cohort study.
setting
UK Biobank Study, UK.
ParticiPants
306 473 men and women, aged 40-73 years, recruited 
between 2006 and 2010.
Main OutcOMe Measure
Hazard ratios for a first stroke, estimated using 
Cox regression. A polygenic risk score of 90 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated 
with stroke was constructed at P<1×10−5 to test for 
an association with incident stroke. Adherence to a 
healthy lifestyle was determined on the basis of four 
factors: non-smoker, healthy diet, body mass index 
<30 kg/m2, and regular physical exercise.
results
During a median follow-up of 7.1 years (2 138 443 
person years), 2077 incident strokes (1541 ischaemic 
stroke, 287 intracerebral haemorrhage, and 249 
subarachnoid haemorrhage) were ascertained. The 
risk of incident stroke was 35% higher among those 
at high genetic risk (top third of polygenic score) 
compared with those at low genetic risk (bottom 
third): hazard ratio 1.35 (95% confidence interval 
1.21 to 1.50), P=3.9×10−8. Unfavourable lifestyle (0 or 
1 healthy lifestyle factors) was associated with a 66% 
increased risk of stroke compared with a favourable 
lifestyle (3 or 4 healthy lifestyle factors): 1.66 (1.45 
to 1.89), P=1.19×10−13. The association with lifestyle 
was independent of genetic risk stratums.
cOnclusiOn
In this cohort study, genetic and lifestyle factors were 
independently associated with incident stroke. These 
results emphasise the benefit of entire populations 
adhering to a healthy lifestyle, independent of genetic 
risk.
Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading reasons for disability and 
death worldwide.1 It is a complex disease, caused by 
both genetic and environmental factors, including diet 
and lifestyle.2
Early evidence supporting a role for genetics in risk 
of stroke came from twin studies and family history 
studies.3 4 Further evidence has emerged from genome 
wide association studies. MEGASTROKE, a large meta-
analysis of genome wide association studies tripled 
the number of loci robustly associated with stroke 
risk.5
Lifestyle is an important modifiable risk factor for 
stroke. Clear evidence shows that adhering to a healthy 
lifestyle, including not smoking, reducing the risk of 
diabetes, regular physical activity, and a healthy diet, 
decreases the risk of stroke substantially.6 7 It might 
be hypothesised that adhering to a healthy lifestyle 
could attenuate the effect of genetics on stroke risk. A 
previous study in coronary artery disease—a condition 
closely related to ischaemic stroke, found a statistically 
significant interplay between genetic and lifestyle risk 
factors in the risk of coronary artery disease.8
We investigated whether a weighted genetic risk 
score based on the genome wide association results 
for stroke in MEGASTROKE is associated with incident 
stroke in a large population based cohort (UK Biobank). 
We also investigated whether adherence to a healthy 
lifestyle influences this association.
Methods
study population
UK Biobank is a prospective study that recruited 
500 000 community dwelling participants, aged 40-
69 years, from across the United Kingdom between 
2006 and 2010 (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).9 Participants 
attended one of 22 assessment centres across England, 
Scotland, and Wales. The study collects extensive 
data from questionnaires, interviews, health records, 
physical measures, biological samples, and imaging. 
Main outcomes and exposures of interest in the current 
study include imputed genetic data, incident stroke, 
and lifestyle (smoking, diet, body mass index, and 
physical activity).

In the present study we included all people who 
were classified as white British (all who self identified 
as white British, followed by the exclusion of ethnic 
outliers identified by principal components analysis 
on the genotype data), without a history of stroke or 
myocardial infarction on the basis of self report or 
medical records, or both, and with complete data on 
lifestyle.
Healthy lifestyle factors
We defined four healthy lifestyle factors on the basis of 
the American Heart Association guidelines: no current 
smoking, healthy diet, body mass index <30 kg/m2, 
and moderate physical activity two or more times 
weekly.10
The 
UK 
Biobank 
participants 
completed 
a 
questionnaire on their usual diet pattern. In this 
analysis, a healthy diet was determined according to 
the increased consumption of fruit, vegetables, and fish 
and the decreased consumption of processed meats 
and red meats. We defined a healthy diet as adherence 
to at least two of the healthy food items. Supplemental 
text S1 and table S1 provide additional details on the 
specific questions asked and the construction of a 
healthy diet score.
Moderate physical activity was defined as at least 
150 minutes of moderate intensity activity weekly or 
75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly.
incident stroke
Incident stroke in UK Biobank was based on medical 
history and linkage to data on hospital admissions 
and mortality. We used the stroke variables provided 
by UK Biobank, which were created by combining 
information from these different data sources (see 
supplemental table S2). Details of the algorithms used 
to combine the data from different sources to identify 
stroke have been described previously and are available 
on the UK Biobank website (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk). 
We subtyped stroke as ischaemic stroke, intracerebral 
haemorrhage, or subarachnoid haemorrhage.
We took into account the occurrence of myocardial 
infarction during the study as this could potentially 
result in lifestyle changes during follow-up that 
affect the risk of stroke. The occurrence of myocardial 
infarction was defined according to the UK Biobank 
algorithmic definition (see supplemental table S2). 
Details of the myocardial infarction algorithm have 
been described previously and are available on the UK 
Biobank website (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).11
We excluded people from the analysis who self 
reported stroke or myocardial infarction.
genetic data
We used the June 2017 release of the imputed genetic 
data from UK Biobank (downloaded 3 June 2017). 
Details of the design of the arrays, sample processing, 
and stringent quality control have been described 
in detail elsewhere12 and summarised previously.13 
Briefly, we used two closely related arrays from 
Affymetrix, the UK BiLEVE Axiom array (9.9% of 
people) and the UK Biobank Axiom array, to genotype 
about 805 426 markers with good genome wide 
coverage. Phasing was performed using SHAPEIT3 
and imputation using IMPUTE4.12 15 Two reference 
panels were used for imputation; the Haplotype 
Reference Consortium reference panel (39 131 578 
autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) 
and a merged UK10K and 1000 Genomes Phase 3 
panel.14 Imputed genotypes were available for 488 369 
participants in this study.12 From the resulting dataset, 
we excluded those who self reported ancestry other 
than white British, related people (second degree 
or greater: kinship coefficient ≥0.884), people with 
high levels of heterozygosity and missingness (>5%), 
and people whose reported sex was inconsistent 
with sex inferred from the genetic data. The UK 
Biobank core team centrally performed a check for 
excessive heterozygosity.13 Extreme heterozygosity or 
high rates of missingness, or both, can be indicators 
of poor sample quality due to, for example, DNA 
contamination. UK Biobank provided a list of samples 
with unusually high heterozygosity and we excluded 
those samples according to its recommendations. 
To evaluate a mismatch in sex self reported sex was 
compared with sex inferred from the genetic data 
(based on relative intensity of markers on the Y and 
X chromosomes). This sex mismatch evaluation was 
centrally performed by the UK Biobank core team and 
is described in detail elsewhere.12 This evaluation 
can be used as a way to detect sample mishandling or 
other kinds of clerical error. However, in a dataset of 
this size, some such mismatches would be expected 
owing to transgender people or instances of real (but 
rare) genetic variation, such as aneuploidies in sex 
chromosomes.
In this analysis we only included SNPs imputed from 
the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel.
Polygenic risk score derived from MegastrOKe
We derived three sets of independent (r2<0.05 or 
1000 Kb apart) SNPs associated with any stroke in 
people of European ancestry in MEGASTROKE (see 
supplemental text S2) at P<5×10−8, P<1×10−6, and 
P<1×10−5 using an LD clumping procedure employed 
using plink v1.90b3.45.5 16 For each individual in 
the UK Biobank sample we calculated quantitative 
aggregate risk scores, defined as the sum of the 
number of risk alleles present at each locus weighted 
by the log of the odds ratio for that locus estimated 
from the MEGASTROKE sample using the plink 
 
“–score” command.
The three polygenic scores were tested for an 
association with incident any stroke, and for further 
analyses we used the polygenic risk score most 
statistically significantly associated with incident 
stroke. Supplemental table S3 lists the SNPs included 
in the MEGASTROKE risk score (all stroke, P<1×10−5).
We repeated the previous steps while restricting 
to ischaemic stroke in those of European ancestry 
to create a genetic risk score for ischaemic stroke 
(P<1×10−5).

statistical analysis
We defined genetic risk in thirds: “low risk” (lowest 
third of genetic risk score), “intermediate risk” (second 
third), “high risk” (highest third). Lifestyle was 
recorded as “favourable” (three or four healthy lifestyle 
factors), “intermediate” (two healthy lifestyle factors), 
“unfavourable” (no or one healthy lifestyle factor).
To test the association of genetic and lifestyle factors 
with incident stroke we used Cox proportional hazards 
models. The duration of follow-up was calculated as 
time between the baseline assessment and the first 
event of either stroke, myocardial infarction, death, 
or 1 March 2016, which was the end of follow-up 
for the current data release. Participants who had a 
myocardial infarction or died before a stroke occurred 
were censored at the time of the respective event.
We repeated the previous steps for the ischaemic 
stroke genetic risk score and assessed the association 
between this score and incident ischaemic stroke. 
In this analysis we censored participants with a 
diagnosis of intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, or myocardial infarction or who died 
before an ischaemic stroke occurred at the time of the 
respective event.
Cox 
proportional 
hazards 
models 
included 
adjustment for age and sex for the lifestyle score 
models. For the models including the genetic score 
we additionally adjusted for the first 10 principal 
components of ancestry and genotyping batch. Model 
discrimination was evaluated with the concordance (c) 
statistic.
We included an interaction term in the regression 
model to test for statistical interaction between the 
lifestyle and genetic risk score.
To obtain cumulative incidence for lifestyle 
and genetic risk stratums we used competing risk 
regression; the cumulative incidence function. We 
compared the hazard ratios for the genetic and lifestyle 
score in the risk of stroke derived from Cox proportional 
hazards models with the subdistribution hazard ratios, 
calculated using proportional subdistribution hazards 
regression models.17
R software version 3.4.2 was used for the Cox 
proportional hazards regression (package “survival”) 
and proportional subdistribution hazards regression 
(package “cmprsk”).
Patient and public involvement
The development of the research question or outcome 
measures was not informed by patients’ priorities, 
experience, or preferences. No patients were involved 
in the design and conduct of the present study. There 
are no plans to disseminate the results to study 
participants.
Results
Complete data for the present analysis were available 
for 306 473 participants in the UK Biobank Study 
(fig 1). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 
study population. During a total of 2 138 443 person 
years (median follow-up 7.1 years), 2077 incident 
fatal or non-fatal strokes were reported as first incident 
vascular event or death, of which 1541 were ischaemic 
stroke, 287 intracerebral haemorrhage, and 249 
subarachnoid haemorrhage. Furthermore, 3436 cases 
of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction and 6646 
deaths due to other causes than stroke or myocardial 
infarction were reported as first incident vascular event 
or death.
Polygenic risk scores containing independent SNPs 
(on basis of linkage disequilibrium patterns) derived 
from MEGASTROKE at three different significance 
thresholds were tested for association with incident 
stroke in UK Biobank (see supplemental figure S1). The 
three polygenic risk scores were associated with risk of 
incident stroke, but the genetic risk score including 
all SNPs associated with stroke in MEGASTROKE 
at P<1×10−5 (90 SNPs, see supplemental table S3) 
showed the strongest association and was therefore 
selected for subsequent analyses. The polygenic risk 
approximated a normal distribution (see supplemental 
figure S2).
In Cox proportional hazards analysis, the risk of 
incident stroke was higher for those with intermediate 
(hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.08 
to 1.34) and high genetic risk scores (1.35, 1.21 to 
1.50) compared with those with a low genetic risk 
score (fig 2). We tested available cardiometabolic 
risk factors for an association with the genetic risk 
score, adjusting for the first 10 principal components 
of ancestry, genotyping batch, age, and sex. The 
genetic risk score was significantly associated with 
systolic blood pressure (P=1.5×10−15), diastolic blood 
pressure (P=1.1×10−7), use of lipid lowering drugs 
(P=7.5×10−13), and diabetes (7.6×10−4), but not with 
body mass index (P=0.18).

The cumulative risk of stroke increased with age. 
Blood pressure, diabetes, and the use of lipid lowering 
drugs did not seem to influence the association 
between genetic risk of stroke and incident stroke (see 
supplemental table S4). Similarly, the risk of stroke 
was increased in those with an unfavourable (hazard 
ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.45 to 1.89) and 
intermediate (1.27, 1.16 to 1.40) lifestyle compared 
with those with a favourable lifestyle (fig 2).
Supplemental figure S3 shows the distribution 
of thirds of genetic risk and lifestyle scores. The 
genetic risk score was not associated with any of the 
single healthy lifestyle factors: odds ratio 0.98 (95% 
confidence interval 0.93 to 1.04) for body mass index 
score, 1.04 (0.99 to 1.09) for diet score, 0.97 (0.88 
to 1.07) for smoking score, and 0.98 (0.94 to 1.03) 
for exercise score. Furthermore, the association of 
genetic risk with incident stroke was unchanged after 
adjustment for lifestyle (see supplemental table S5). 
Likewise, the association of lifestyle with incident 
stroke was essentially unchanged after adjustment for 
the genetic risk score (see supplemental table S5).
Table 2 shows the risk of incident stroke for 
combined genetic risk and lifestyle profiles. An additive 
effect was found for genetic risk and lifestyle on risk 
of incident stroke. Within each genetic risk stratum 
there was an increase in strength of association with 
decreasing number of favourable life style factors (see 
supplemental table S6). The highest risk of incident 
stroke was observed in participants with a high 
genetic risk and an unfavourable lifestyle: hazard 
ratio 2.30 (95% confidence interval 1.84 to 2.87); 
see supplemental figure S4. The test for statistical 
interaction between lifestyle score and genetic risk 
score in relation to incident stroke was not significant 
(P=0.57) compared with participants with low genetic 
risk and favourable lifestyle.
Model discrimination was similar between the 
main Cox proportional hazards models including the 
genetic risk score (c statistic 0.69 (SE) 0.01), lifestyle 
score (0.69 (SE 0.01)), and the combined genetic and 
lifestyle score (0.70 (SE 0.01)).
We repeated the analysis to test the associations 
of the genetic and lifestyle scores with incident 
stroke while restricting only to ischaemic stroke for 
both genetic risk score and outcome. In addition, we 
compared the results derived from the Cox proportional 
hazards model with those derived from the competing 
risk proportional subdistribution hazards model. 
Results did not change substantially when restricting 
to ischaemic stroke or when using the subdistribution 
hazards model compared with the original analyses 
(see supplementary tables S7-S9).
Among individual components of the lifestyle score, 
smoking and body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 contributed 
most to the risk of incident stroke (table 3). For all 
lifestyle factors, the effects were similar across genetic 
risk stratums.
As the effect of smoking was about twice as strong 
as the other individual lifestyle scores (table 3). We 
repeated the analysis of the risk of incident stroke for 
combined genetic risk and lifestyle profile in which 
smoking was counted twice, and this resulted in slightly 
increased point estimates in the unfavourable versus 
favourable lifestyle categories (see supplementary 
table S10).
The associations of genetic risk score with incident 
stroke were consistent in men and women (interaction 
P=0.70, supplemental figure S5). However, across 
all genetic risk stratums the absolute risk of incident 
stroke was lower in women than in men.
A statistically significant interaction on the 
multiplicative scale was found between sex and 
lifestyle profile in the risk of incident stroke 
(interaction P=0.01, supplemental figure S6). For men 
there was an increase in association with decreasing 
number of healthy lifestyle factors: hazard ratio 1.20 
(95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.36) and 1.82 (1.55

discussion
We investigated the association between genetic risk of 
stroke, lifestyle, and incident risk of stroke in 306 473 
people within the population based UK Biobank 
study. Risk of incident stroke was 35% higher among 
those at high genetic risk compared with those at low 
genetic risk, and these associations were independent 
of lifestyle profile. Furthermore, an unfavourable 
lifestyle was associated with a 66% increased risk of 
incident stroke compared with a favourable lifestyle, 
and this increased risk was present within any genetic 
risk category. A high genetic risk combined with an 
unfavourable lifestyle profile was associated with a 
more than twofold increased risk of stroke compared 
with a low genetic risk and a favourable lifestyle.
The present study provides further support that 
common genetic variants are implicated in the 
development of stroke. Our findings showing that a 
polygenic risk score is associated with incident stroke 
is in line with both clinical and population based 
studies.18-21
The genetic risk score was also associated with 
blood pressure and use of lipid lowering drugs, which 
suggest that the effect of the genetic variants on risk 
of incident stroke might at least in part be mediated 
by vascular risk factors. However, adjusting for those 
factors did not change the effect size of association 
between genetic risk and incident stroke, which 
emphasises that other mechanisms than those that 
involve the traditional cardiovascular risk factors are 
likely important. In the MEGASTROKE genome wide 
association analysis of stroke, only about half of the 
identified loci shared genetic variation with related 
vascular traits, including blood pressure and lipid 
levels, which support that the genetic risk might act 
through additional mechanisms.5
The reduction of stroke risk by adhering to a 
healthy lifestyle has been well reported.7 22-25 The

risk reduction associated with adherence to a healthy 
lifestyle in the present study was similar across all 
stratums of genetic risk, which emphasises the benefit 
for entire populations of adhering to a healthy lifestyle, 
independent of genetic risk. Among the lifestyle factors, 
the most statistically significant associations were 
observed for smoking and body mass index ≥30 kg/m2.
comparison with previous studies
Across all categories of genetic risk and lifestyle, the risk 
of incident stroke was higher in men than women. This 
is an expected finding given the previously consistently 
shown higher incidence of stroke in men compared 
with women at the age of most of the UK Biobank 
participants.26 Our results suggested that the relative 
risk of incident stroke associated with high genetic 
risk versus low genetic risk was similar in men and 
women. A family history and genome wide association 
studies suggested that genetic susceptibility to stroke 
is somewhat stronger in women than in men.27 28 The 
methodological differences of those previous studies 
and the current study might explain the different 
conclusions. In the current study, only genetic variants 
associated with stroke in MEGASTROKE at P<1×10−5 
were considered, whereas the other studies evaluated 
all genome wide variants within the study population 
or family history, which also includes environmental 
effects.
Considerable 
evidence 
from 
previous 
epidemiological studies also suggests differences 
in risk factors that are associated with stroke in 
men compared with women. Women have a higher 
prevalence of hypertension, whereas men have a 
higher prevalence of heart disease, diabetes, and 
unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, including smoking, 
obesity, and alcohol use.29-31 In the present study we 
found a higher relative risk of stroke associated with 
an unfavourable lifestyle in men than women (82% v 
36% increased risk, respectively).
Other possibilities for the increased relative risk 
include potential differences in duration of exposure to 
unfavourable lifestyle factors. Future studies are needed 
to evaluate the effect of the duration of exposure to an 
unfavourable lifestyle profile on the risk of stroke.
strengths and limitations of this study
The major strengths of the current study include the 
large sample size of UK Biobank participants, which 
enabled study of the combination of genetic risk and 
lifestyle in detail. Furthermore, to derive a genetic 
risk score for stroke, we used MEGASTROKE, which is 
currently the largest genome wide association study 
of stroke.5 Another distinctive feature of this analysis 
compared with a previous study is that we also included 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated 
with stroke at a subthreshold level of significance 
(P<1×10−5).19 This concurs with a previous study 
examining the predictive utility of genetic risk scores 
for incident coronary heart disease, which showed 
that the best performance was achieved by including 
SNPs that did not necessarily reach the genome wide 
statistical significance threshold in previous genome 
wide association studies.32
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, behavioural 
changes before or after the baseline examinations 
might have had an effect on the risk estimates. We tried 
to reduce the effect of behavioural changes that could 
be related to vascular disease by excluding all those 
with a history of stroke and by censoring those at the 
time a myocardial infarction occurred. Secondly, this 
analysis focused on a narrow range of lifestyle factors, 
based on the American Heart Association guidelines.10 
Expanding the range of lifestyle factors (ie, stress, sleep, 
alcohol and drug use) and more detailed assessment of 
diet and physical activity would be of interest for future 
studies. Thirdly, in the current study we only evaluated 
stroke of any cause. The effects of lifestyle and genetic 
variants might differ according to the cause of stroke, 
although some genetic risk variants and vascular risk 
factors are shared between two or more causal factors.5
Finally, in the present study we restricted our 
analysis to people of European descent. Therefore, our 
results may not be generalisable to populations with 
distinct ancestry. Future studies are needed that test 
these relations in more diverse populations.
conclusion
In the present prospective population based cohort 
study of 306 473 people we found that genetic and 
lifestyle factors were independently associated with 
risk of incident stroke. These findings highlight the 
potential of lifestyle interventions to reduce risk of 
stroke across entire populations, even in those at high 
genetic risk of stroke.
