Abstract
Introduction: A fall in hospital deaths in dementia has been interpreted as indicating an improve-
ment in end-of-life care. Whether other indicators of quality of end-of-life care, such as emergency
department (ED) attendance, show a similar trend is unclear.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from a large mental health
care provider, linked to national mortality and hospital use data (2008–2013).
Results: Of 4867 patients, 78.6% (3824) had at least one ED attendance during their last year of life
(mean 2.13, standard deviation 2.34, range 0–54). ED attendance increased over the time period (inci-
dence rate ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.46–1.80 for 2012–2013 compared with 2008–2009).
Discussion: ED attendance in the last year of life for people with dementia is common and is
increasing. Policy makers must pay attention to a broader range of indicators of poor end-of-life
care alongside the place of death.

1. Introduction
Over the past decade there has been a strong policy focus
in the UK and elsewhere on dying out of hospital as a marker
of good quality end-of-life care [1,2]. A fall in hospital
deaths and a reciprocal increase in home deaths during this
time period have been considered to suggest success of
these strategies [3]. However, the place of death only pro-
vides a snapshot of the care received by a patient at the
end of their life, and does not tell us about the care received
during their last weeks and months.
Emergency department (ED) visits for people who are ap-
proaching the end-of-life can be distressing for patients and
families and challenging for staff, and are considered poten-
tially preventable in a high proportion of cases [4]. At a pop-
ulation level, ED use toward the end-of-life has been used to
indicate poor quality of care [5]. For people with dementia,
ED visits and acute hospital care can lead to cognitive and
physical deterioration with increased risk of hospital ac-
quired infections, bedsores, and worsening of behavioral
problems [6]. However, ED attendance among people with
dementia remains common [7], and studies in the United
States have shown that ED use rises sharply as death ap-
proaches [8]. Whole population mortality data analysis has
shown that hospital deaths in dementia in England began
falling in 2005/2006 [9]. Whether other indicators of poor

 quality end-of-life care in dementia such as ED attendance
show a similar trend is not known.
Routinely collected data, for example, mortality data, are
increasingly used in end-of-life care research and offers the
methodological advantage of negating the challenges of pri-
mary data collection in this potentially vulnerable popula-
tion [10]. Furthermore, routine data analysis is usually
more economical and timely than primary data collection,
and can be carried out for large population-based samples
[5]. However, research in this area is limited by a paucity
of relevant clinical information in administrative data and
incomplete recording of data [11]. Linking administrative
with clinical data can overcome these limitations, while al-
lowing examination of outcomes in naturalistic samples
and settings [12]. The aim of this study was to use linked
data from a large mental health database to examine the fre-
quency, and identify predictors, of ED attendance among
people with dementia in their last year of life.
2. Methods
2.1. Setting and data source
This retrospective observational study used data from the
South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS)
Foundation Trust (SLAM) Biomedical Research Centre
Case Register and the Clinical Record Interactive Search
(CRIS) data extraction tool. This data resource has been
described previously [13–17]. It provides researcher access
to full anonymized copies of electronic medical records
from SLAM, one of Europe’s largest mental health care
providers covering a geographic catchment of 1.2 million
residents in four boroughs of South London. SLAM delivers
a comprehensive range of services, including dementia
assessment and treatment. Data are currently archived on
more than 300,000 cases with a range of mental disorders.
2.2. Population
The records of all patients with a diagnosis of dementia
recorded in SLAM and who were aged 60 years or older at
death were retrieved from the SLAM Biomedical Research
Centre Case Register. Diagnosis of dementia was deter-
mined from structured fields in the source record (based on
ICD-10 codes F00x-03x) and supplemented by a bespoke
natural language processing algorithm using General Archi-
tecture for Text Engineering software [18]. This extracts in-
formation from unstructured text data within clinical records
(including correspondence and case notes), returning text
strings associated with diagnostic statements [13,19,20].
CRIS data have been linked with Office for National
Statistics (ONS) death certification data, and this linkage
was used to identify cohort members who had died,
restricting the analysis to this group. CRIS is also linked to
Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES), a record-based system
covering all NHS Trusts in England, which was used to
determine ED attendance during the last 12 months of life.
Because the HES-ED linkage is only available in CRIS
from April 1, 2007, the cohort was restricted to those who
died after April 1, 2008 so that 12 months of HES-ED data
were available for all patients before death.
2.3. Covariates
CRIS was used to extract data on age, gender, ethnicity
(White British, Other White, African Caribbean, other, not
known) and recorded dementia subtype (Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, vascular, unspecified, Lewy body, unknown). Socio-
economic status was estimated from the 2015 Index of
Multiple Deprivation, a measure of relative deprivation for
small areas termed Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in
England, with LSOAs ranked from 1 (most deprived) to
32,844 (least deprived). Index of Multiple Deprivation was
derived from the LSOA associated with the patient’s most
recent address (at the time of death) and converted into quin-
tiles for ease of interpretation. Dementia severity was esti-
mated from the most recently recorded Mini–Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score, drawn from a structured field
in the source record and a further General Architecture for

extraction
application
[13,17]. The most recent Health of the Nation Outcome
Scale (HoNOS) was also ascertained from the source
record. HoNOS is a functional outcome measure used
routinely
in
mental
health
care
and
comprising
12
subscales each rated 0 (no problem) to 4 (severe or very
severe problem). We dichotomized the HoNOS scores
(scores of 0 and 1 were grouped as no or minor problems,
scores of 2, 3, and 4 represented mild to severe problems)
to facilitate interpretation. Care home residence was
determined from a data linkage to residential postcode.
Linkage with ONS death certification data provided
information on the place of death, which was categorized
as private residence/own home, hospice, hospital, care
home (including residential and nursing homes) and
“other”
(e.g.,
prisons,
street).
Place
of
death
was
categorized from free text provided by ONS by one author
(K.E.S.) and independently checked by a second author
(G.P.).
Where
there
were
discrepancies
these
were
discussed and a category was agreed. The time interval (in
months) between the last face-to-face contact by a SLAM
staff member and death was determined using the date of
death from ONS mortality data. The age at death was deter-
mined from the date of death in ONS mortality data and the
date of birth in CRIS. Information on ED attendance, mode
of arrival (ambulance or other), referral mode (via GP, emer-
gency services, or self-referred), outcome of ED attendance
(admission to hospital, discharge with GP follow-up, or
discharge with no follow-up), and time of attendance was
determined using the HES-ED linked data. Out of hours
was defined as 8 PM to 8 AM on weekdays, or any time on Sat-
urday, Sunday, and Bank Holidays.
The primary outcome was number of ED attendances in
the last year of life, modeled as a continuous variable.

 2.4. Statistical analysis
At the level of the ED attendance, descriptive statistics
were used to describe mode and time of attendances and
outcome following ED attendance. Chi-square tests were
used to examine differences in the mode, time of attendance,
and outcome according to proximity to death. At the patient
level, descriptive statistics were used to describe the study
population in terms of demographic and clinical variables.
Negative binomial regression analysis was used to investi-
gate the factors associated with ED attendances in the
last year of life, using an adapted theoretical model [21].
Negative binomial regression was chosen in preference to
Poisson regression as the data were overdispersed. For the
multivariable model, explanatory variables were selected
according to a priori hypotheses and significance in unad-
justed analyses (P ,.1). In light of missing data for HoNOS
and MMSE, a sensitivity analysis was run with these vari-
ables removed. Analyses were performed using STATA
version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
2.5. Patient involvement
Patients and caregivers were involved in the planning and
interpretation of this study.
2.6. Ethics statement
The source database is approved for secondary analysis
by the Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee C (reference
08/H0606/7115).
3. Results
Using CRIS, 4869 patients who had a clinical diagnosis
of dementia and who had died were identified. One patient
with unknown gender was removed. In addition, one outlier
patient in whom there were 218 ED attendances in the last
year of life was removed, leaving 4867 patients in the final
analysis. Most patients were women (61.3%), and the
mean age at death was 85.3 years (standard deviation [SD]
7.4) (increase from 85.1 years [SD 7.3] in 2008–2009 to
85.7 years [SD 7.3] in 2012–2013). The most common
ethnicity was White British (71.9%). Compared with the Na-
tional distribution, the cohort was relatively deprived. The
most common dementia diagnosis was Alzheimer’s disease
(40.4%), followed by vascular dementia (25.4%). MMSE
score was available for 79.3% patients, and the most recently
recorded mean score was 15.8 (SD 6.8). HoNOS data were
available for 88% of patients, and the most common prob-
lems recorded in HoNOS were cognitive (90.6%), daily
living problems (80.3%), and physical problems (72.0%).
The mean time interval between last face-to-face contact
in SLAM and death was 16.1 months (SD 19.3). Most of
the cohort died in hospital (48.1%) or in a care home
(42.4%). Death at home (8.4%) or in a hospice (1.0%) was
less common. The cohort size increased over the observation
period from 833 deaths in 2008 to 2009 (17.1% cohort) to
1141 deaths in 2012 to 2013 (23.4% cohort) (Table 1).
During their last year of life, the 4867 patients attended
the ED 10,361 times. Referral of patients to the ED was
via the emergency services in 35.1% of attendances
(3637), via self in 17.6% (1820), via the GP in 5.6% (557),
and other in 41.8% (4327). A total of 91.1% of attendances
were by ambulance and 47.3% of ED attendances occurred
out of hours. A total of 72.7% of ED attendances (7528) re-
sulted in hospital admission, 15.8% resulted in discharge,
and 4.9% in discharge with GP follow-up. One hundred
eighty-three patients died in the ED (1.8% of attendances,
3.8% of cohort). The frequency of ED attendance increased
the closer patients were to death, with 24.6% (2546) of all
ED attendances occurring in the last month of life (Fig. 1).
ED attendance in the last month of life was more likely to
be after emergency services referral and less likely to be af-
ter GP or self referral (c2 5 47.10, P ,.001) compared with
ED attendance in months 2 to 12 before death and more
likely to be by ambulance (c2 5 90.58, P ,.001). ED atten-
dance in the last month of life was more likely to be out of
hours (c2 5 11.72, P 5 .001).
Of the 4867 patients in the cohort, 78.6% (3824) had at
least one ED attendance during their last year of life;
44.5% (2164) of the cohort had at least one ED attendance
in their last month of life, and 20.9% (1017) had at least
one ED attendance in their last week of life. The mean num-
ber of ED attendances per patient during the last year of life
was 2.1 (SD 2.3, range 0–54) and increased over the time
period studied from 1.6 (SD 1.9, range 0–14) during 2008
to 2009 to 2.4 (SD 2.5, range 0–54) during 2012 to 2013.
In unadjusted negative binomial regression models male
gender, younger age at death, more recent date of death, a diag-
nosis of vascular dementia, unspecified, or other dementia
(compared with Alzheimer’s disease), African Caribbean
ethnicity (compared with White British), higher MMSE (less
severe cognitive impairment), and higher severity measures
on HoNOS physical health, depression, “other mental” prob-
lems, and problems with living condition subscales were asso-
ciated with greater number of ED attendances. Living in a more
affluent area, being resident in a care home, and a longer time
between the last face-to-face contact and death were associated
with a smaller number of ED attendances.
In the multivariable model, the following factors re-
mained significantly associated with increased number of
ED attendances during the last year of life: male gender,
more recent year of death, HoNOS depression severity,
higher cognitive function (MMSE score), and diagnosis of
vascular dementia. A longer interval between the last face-
to-face contact in SLAM and death, being resident in a
care home, and living in the most affluent areas were associ-
ated with fewer ED attendances (Table 2; Fig. 2). A sensi-
tivity analysis with HoNOS and MMSE removed gave
similar results, with the exception that increasing age
became significantly associated with reduced likelihood of
ED attendance.

 4. Discussion
ED attendance among people with dementia who are ap-
proaching the end-of-life is common, with three quarters of
patients having at least one ED attendance in their last year
of life. These findings are similar to data from the United
States and Australia, where 81.1% and 73.0% of people
with dementia had an ED attendance in their last year of
life, respectively [22].
4.1. Factors associated with ED attendance
We found that the likelihood of ED attendance in the last
year of life has increased over time: people who died in 2012
to 2013 were more likely to have an ED attendance in their
last year than people who died in 2009 to 2010. This trend is
concerning, and reflects a similar trend in the United States
where hospitalization of people with dementia increased be-
tween 2000 and 2009 [23]. Although it is known that emer-
gency admissions among people aged more than 65 years in
England increased between 2001 and 2012 [24], to our
knowledge ours is the first evidence of increasing ED atten-
dance for people in their last year of life.
In our study, being resident in a care home was associated
with reduced likelihood of ED attendance. This suggests that
care home residence might “protect” patients against transi-
tions in care setting close to death, and that increasing care
home bed capacity is likely to play an important role in
reducing pressure on emergency hospital care. A similar as-
sociation has been shown for death in hospital [25]. Although
care home capacity has increased in some parts of England in
recent years, other areas have seen a loss of care homes [26].
Given the projected increase in prevalence of dementia with
population aging [27], this issue requires urgent attention.
Being resident in a more deprived area was positively
associated with ED attendance. A similar association

 has been shown in people with cancer attending the ED in
the last month of life [28] and among people with
dementia who died in hospital [9]. There is evidence
that people living in less deprived areas may have
better access to specialist palliative care (hospice) ser-
vices [29], which could help mitigate against ED
attendance [30].
The association of vascular dementia with ED attendance
may reflect the unpredictable nature of deterioration in this
condition. In contrast with previous studies that show func-
tional impairment is a driver of health care utilization
[31,32], we did not find that patients with severe physical
problems were more likely to attend the ED. This may be
because the mean interval between last being seen in
SLAM and death was 17 months, and so the final recorded
HoNOS score may not reflect perfectly the patient’s
problems close to death. Despite this limitation, our data
did show that less severe cognitive impairment was
associated with more ED attendances. Other studies have
shown similar results [33], although some have found no as-
sociation between dementia severity and ED transition
among nursing home residents [34].

 We found that the frequency of ED attendance among
people with dementia increases dramatically as death ap-
proaches. A total of 44.5% of our cohort had an ED atten-
dance in their last month of life, and these attendances
were more likely to be emergency referrals, to be by ambu-
lance, and to be out of hours, suggesting that these visits are
unplanned and precipitated by an acute crisis. Although we
cannot determine whether attendances were potentially
avoidable, our cohort comprised physically and cognitively
frail older people, and the high frequency of ED attendance
close to death is concerning.
4.2. Strengths and limitations of the study
This study is the first to examine the factors associated
with ED attendance among people with dementia in the
last year of life in England, using linked clinical and admin-
istrative data. The use of a clinical database enabled us to
examine variables, such as the degree of cognitive impair-
ment, and outcome measures that are not available in routine
administrative data. Importantly, these variables were avail-
able for those who did and those who did not have ED atten-
dances. The use of a clinical database was to identify our
cohort negates bias from incomplete death certification of
dementia [11].
The limitations of this study are that the data are restricted
to those patients seen in a specialist setting, which may limit
the generalizability, and future studies should attempt to
replicate the findings in different populations. Predictive fac-
tors are limited to those available in routinely collected clin-
ical and administrative data. For example, information about
social support was limited to the relevant HoNOS subscale,
and detailed information on informal caregivers was not
known. No information was available regarding patients’
preferences or wishes, the presence or absence of advance
directives, or the decision-making processes leading to ED
attendance, and future research to explore these areas is
needed. The interval between the last face-to-face clinical
contact and death was lengthy in many cases, meaning
some recorded clinical variables (such as those derived
from HoNOS) may not perfectly represent the clinical pic-
ture nearer to death. Although we were able to include
care home residence in our model, we were not able to
include the number of care home beds available in the local
area. Finally, our data do not allow us to determine whether
the ED attendances were potentially avoidable or the quality
of care in the different settings.
4.3. ED attendance as a marker of quality of end-of-life
care
End-of-life quality indicators derived from routinely
collected data are intended to provide a measure of the qual-
ity of care across systems, rather than to judge the quality of
care for individual patients. Such indicators were first devel-
oped for use in cancer [5,35], and have subsequently been

 used in other populations including the elderly [36] and peo-
ple with dementia [37].
Dementia is a terminal illness and, like cancer, it is charac-
terized by an increase in distressing symptoms toward the
end-of-life [38]. In one study of people with advanced demen-
tia, 96% of family caregivers reported that comfort was the
primary goal of care [38]. Although ED attendance may be
necessary to reduce discomfort (e.g., after a fracture), such
circumstances have been found to be infrequent [38].
For people with dementia, high rates of ED attendance
near the end-of-life may indicate inadequate availability of
community care, a paucity of advance directives, or lack
of focus on patients’ quality of life. However, dying is a pro-
foundly
personal
experience.
Future
development
of
routinely collected data to include person-centered outcome
measures validated for use in people approaching the end-of-
life (e.g., pain control, quality of communication, and psy-
chological well-being) would greatly enhance the value of
such analyses [39].
5. Conclusions
ED attendance among people with dementia in their last
year of life is common and is associated with demographic,
illness-related and environmental factors. The strong associ-
ation between ED attendance and environmental factors is of
particular importance given the potentially modifiable na-
ture of these. Care home residence was found to mitigate
against ED attendance. In light of the dual pressures of a pro-
jected increase in prevalence of dementia and a loss of care
home beds in some parts of England [26], investing in care
home (or similar) capacity is urgently needed to avoid un-
necessary pressure on emergency care. Although the propor-
tion of people with dementia dying in hospitals has fallen
[9], our data show that ED attendance in the last year of
life follows the opposite trend. We recommend that policy
makers consider a broader range of indicators of the quality
of end-of-life care alongside the place of death.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: Using PubMed, we identified and
reviewed publications reporting on the frequency of,
and factors associated with, Emergency Department
(ED) attendance among people with dementia who
were approaching death.
2. Interpretation: ED attendance among people with de-
mentia in the last year of life is common and has
increased over time. Given the projected increase
in prevalence of dementia, our data suggest that in-
vestment in care home capacity is urgently needed
to mitigate against rising ED attendance near to the
end-of-life.
3. Future directions: Future studies should investigate
trends in other indicators of potentially aggressive
care for people with dementia approaching the end-
of-life, such as hospital transitions and intensive
care unit admissions. For a decade, national policies
have relied on the place of death as an indicator of the
quality of end-of-life care. Policy makers must now
consider a broader range of indicators of the quality
of end-of-life care, taking into account not just where
a person dies but the care they receive during the
preceding months.
