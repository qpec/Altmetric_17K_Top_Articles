Abstract
Background: Rates of routine human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccination of adolescent males in the United States are low.
Leading health organizations advocate consistent and strong
physician recommendations to improve HPV vaccine dissemina-
tion. This study describes the prevalence and correlates of
consistent and strong physician recommendations for HPV
vaccination of adolescent males.
Methods: We surveyed pediatric and family medicine physi-
cians in Florida about their HPV vaccine recommendations for
male vaccine-eligible age groups (11–12, 13–17, 18–21 years).
Descriptive statistics compared consistency and strength of HPV
recommendations across age groups. Multivariable logistic regres-
sion examined factors associated with consistent and strong
recommendations for 11- to 12-year-olds.
Results: We received 367 completed surveys (51% response
rate). Physicians most often consistently and strongly recom-
mended HPV vaccine to males ages 13 to 17 (39%) compared
with ages 11 to 12 (31%) and 18 to 21 (31%). Consistent and
strong recommendation for 11- to 12-year-old males was more
likely to be delivered by Vaccine for Children providers and less
likely among physicians who reported more personal barriers to
vaccination, particularly concerns about vaccine safety, concerns
about adding vaccines to the vaccine schedule, and difficulty in
remembering to discuss HPV vaccination.
Conclusions: Physicians' current consistency and strength of
HPV vaccine recommendations do not align with national recom-
mendations. Interventions to improve HPV vaccine recommen-
dations must also consider the influence of physicians' personal
barriers to HPV vaccine delivery.
Impact: As one of the first studies to examine both consistency
and strength of physicians' HPV vaccine recommendations for
males, our findings can inform future interventions focused on
facilitating physicians' recommendations. Cancer Epidemiol Biomar-

Introduction
In 2011, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommended routine human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccination of all males ages 11 to 12 years, catch-up vaccination
for males ages 13 to 21 years, and vaccination for men who have
sex with men ages 22 to 26 (1). The ACIP updated this recom-
mendation in 2015 to include the recently licensed 9-valent HPV
vaccine (2). Yet HPV vaccination uptake among adolescent males
nationally and in Florida is modest. In 2014, HPV vaccine initi-
ation rate among males both in Florida and nationally was
approximately 41%; coverage with �3 dose among males ages
13 to 17 was 22% in the United States and 17.5% in Florida
(range: 9% in Alabama to 43% in Rhode Island; ref. 3). Available
data suggest rates are even lower for 11- to 12-year-olds, who
constitute the target age group for vaccination (4). Florida has
among the nation's highest rates of HPV-related diseases in males,
including the fifth highest rate of anal cancer (5). Given the
established efficacy of preventing HPV infections that cause anal
and penile cancer (6, 7), HPV vaccination has tremendous poten-
tial for primary prevention (8, 9), particularly for males from
racial/ethnic and sexual minority groups disproportionately
affected by HPV-related diseases (10–12).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; ref. 13)
and the President's Cancer Panel (14) advocate consistent and
strong physician recommendations, particularly for the target
age group of 11- to 12-year-old adolescents, as a primary approach
to improving HPV vaccine dissemination. Yet relatively little

 research has examined the consistency and strength of physicians'
HPV vaccine recommendations specific to males following the
ACIP's recommendation for routine vaccination. Regarding con-
sistency, results from a statewide survey of pediatricians, family
physicians, and nurse practitioners in Minnesota showed that
about 46% of providers routinely recommended HPV vaccine for
boys ages 11 to 12 years (15). A national survey found that 61% of
pediatricians and family physicians started routinely recommend-
ing HPV vaccine for males at or before age 12. For strength, a
national survey of pediatricians and family physicians found that
52% of pediatricians and 41% of family physicians strongly
recommend HPV vaccine for 11- to 12-year-old males (16),
compared with 64% of pediatricians and 50% of family physi-
cians in Hawaii (17). To our knowledge, only one study has
examined both consistency and strength of physicians' HPV
vaccine recommendations as part of a larger recommendation
quality measure but did not focus solely on male patients (16).
Because available literature demonstrates a disparity in recom-
mendation practices such that fewer physicians report consistent
and strong HPV vaccine recommendations for males compared
with females (15–18), it is important to further explore factors
associated with physicians' HPV vaccine recommendations for
males.
Understanding recommendation practices and factors associ-
ated with those practices in a state with low vaccine uptake is
essential to designing and implementing interventions to
improve physicians' HPV vaccine recommendations. The medical
encounter presents competing demands that pull physicians in
many directions and influence how they recommend/provide
preventive services during patient encounters. These ideas serve
as the basis for the Competing Demands Model (CDM; ref. 19),
originally developed to understand delivery of clinical preventive
services in the primary care setting. The CDM proposes that
physician (e.g., specialty, attitudes), patient (e.g., knowledge,
attitudes), and practice environment (e.g., setting, location) fac-
tors influence physicians' delivery of preventive health services.
Although several of these CDM factors have been explored by our
group (20–22) and others (23), few have delved into vaccine-
specific factors within the practice environment, such as the
presence of a vaccine coordinator and use of specific types of
reminder systems for series initiation and completion.
This study examines the prevalence of physician recommen-
dation of HPV vaccination to vaccine-eligible males ages 11 to 12,
13 to 17, and 18 to 21 in Florida. Given ACIP recommendations
emphasize routine vaccination targeting 11- to 12-year-olds and
an emphasis on multilevel approaches to improving HPV vacci-
nation rates (24), we assessed examined physician-reported fac-
tors relevant to the physician and practice (both general and
vaccine specific) domains of the CDM as correlates of HPV vaccine
recommendation for this age group.
Materials and Methods
Recruitment
Physicians were recruited from the American Medical Associ-
ation (AMA) Physician Masterfile, a database of all licensed U.S.
physicians (25). Our initial sampling frame excluded those who
(i) were trainees; (ii) locum tenens; (iii) reported their major
professional activity as nonpatient care; (iv) were �65 years of
age, as the AMA Masterfile has been shown to have a significant lag
in updating retired physicians (26); and (v) listed a post office box
for their address (precluding use of FedEx mailing). Florida
pediatric and family medicine (FM) physicians were sampled on
the basis of their proportional representation in the Florida
physician primary care workforce and randomly selected from
the AMA Masterfile (n ¼ 770). We selected only 1 physician per
group practice. Informed by Dillman tailored design method
(27), prenotice postcards were mailed in May 2014, followed by
the first survey mailing in June 2014. Although the survey itself
was anonymous, we limited subsequent mailings by using a
postage paid postcard that was included with every survey mailing
where physicians were asked to provide their name, address, and
select from options including: (i) I have completed and sent the
survey back in the prepaid envelope; or (ii) I do not wish to
participate and have returned the blank survey and the $25
incentive. Follow-up mailings were sent to all those from whom
we did not receive a completed postcard through August 2014.
Participating physicians received a $25 cash incentive.
Of the 770 surveys mailed, 367 were received. After accounting
for undeliverable surveys (n ¼ 36) and ineligible respondents (n ¼
10), the overall response rate was 51% (367/724). We excluded 12
participants who reported not seeing male patients ages 9 to 26,
for an analytic sample size of 355.
Instrument
Where possible, we used previous survey items to assess HPV
vaccination recommendation (20, 28–33); new items that were
created to measure constructs not assessed in previous studies are
noted below. The final 49-item survey assessed three domains
relevant to the CDM: physician characteristics, physician-reported
general and vaccine-specific practice characteristics.
Physician-reported characteristics were perceived personal and
parental barriers related to HPV vaccination, HPV-related knowl-
edge, and demographic characteristics. Sixteen items assessed
physician-reported barriers to immunizing male patients against
HPV. Perceived parental HPV vaccination barriers for 9- to 17-
year-old male patients were measured using 14 items. Response
options for physician-reported and perceived parental barriers
were on a 4-point Likert scale (1 ¼ not a barrier at all to 4 ¼ a major
barrier). Items were summed to create scores for perceived per-
sonal (range: 16–64; Cronbach a ¼ 0.88) and parental barriers
(range: 14–56; Cronbach a ¼ 0.90). Lower scores indicated lower
perceived barriers. Knowledge was measured using 9 items regard-
ing HPV infection, disease, and vaccine guidelines for males. We
built on previous surveys by creating new items to assess knowl-
edge specific to guidelines and financial coverage for vaccinating
males. One point was awarded for each correct response, and
correct responses were summed to create a knowledge score
(range: 0–9).
Physician-reported general practice characteristics included
number of physicians in the practice, practice situation (single
specialty, multispecialty, other), practice type (private, other),
race/ethnic category of the majority of patients seen, whether the
practice serves Medicaid patients, typical daily patient load, and
practice location (urban, suburban, rural, other). Vaccine-specific
practice characteristics were administration of HPV vaccine, Vac-
cines for Children (VFC) provider, strategies for remembering to
discuss HPV vaccine with male patients, specific strategies to get
patients into the office for the first and subsequent dose(s) of
vaccine, total number of strategies used to get patients into the
office for the first and subsequent dose(s) of vaccine, and presence
of an office vaccine coordinator. We created new survey items to

 assess whether other health care professionals (i.e., medical
assistant, nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) in the
practice discuss and recommend HPV vaccine. The final survey
can be obtained by emailing the corresponding author.
In addition to items evaluating domains relevant to CDM, our
survey included new and previous items that assessed the context
and content of vaccination recommendation (34). New items
also assessed provider's acceptance and use of the CDC mes-
sages and materials to support HPV vaccine recommendation
for adolescent males (35) and intervention preferences.
The primary outcome variables were HPV vaccine recommen-
dations to vaccine-eligible males ages 11 to 12, 13 to 17, and 18 to
21. Given that national guidelines call for consistent and strong
recommendations, we assessed recommendation consistency and
strength using two questions from prior studies (33). The first
question asked providers to indicate how often they recom-
mended HPV vaccination by age group: never/almost never
(<10%), occasionally (10%–39%), about half the time (40%–
59%), usually (60%–90%), and always/almost always (>90%).
Providers were also asked how strongly they recommended vac-
cination by age group: I recommend against; I make no recom-
mendation for or against; I recommend, but not strongly; and I
strongly recommend. In addition to reviewing these items indi-
vidually, we created a composite variable to reflect that national
guidelines call for both consistent and strong recommendations.
We combined these two questions into one variable to compare
those who reported recommending vaccination consistently
(always/almost always) and strongly to physicians who reported
any other combination of responses.
Statistical analysis
Frequencies and percentages were calculated for independent
and outcome variables. To reflect national guidelines for consis-
tent and strong HPV vaccine recommendations targeted to ado-
lescent males ages 11 to 12, we focused analyses on assessing
correlates of recommendation for this age group. This was done in
three steps. First, simple logistic regression models examined each
correlate. Second, within each domain, significant univariate
correlates were entered into a multivariable model. A backward
elimination approach (significance level of stay ¼ 0.05) was used
to determine those correlates, making relatively independent
contributions to consistent and strong HPV vaccine recommen-
dations for each domain. Significant correlates in the final model
for each domain were then entered into a multivariable model
using a backward elimination approach to generate a model of the
relatively independent correlates across domains. ORs and their
95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated in each model. All
analyses used two-tailed tests with the significance level set at P <
0.05 and were performed using the SAS 9.3 statistical software
package (SAS Institute Inc.).
Results
The sample was almost equally comprised of female (51.0%)
and male (49.0%) physicians (Table 1), with an average age of
48.7 years (SD ¼ 9.0). Most were white (67.7%) and non-
Hispanic (75.1%). About half specialized in FM (49.9%) and
had been practicing for �16 years (51.9%). HPV vaccine knowl-
edge scores averaged 5.7 (SD ¼ 2.1; range: 0–9).
Physicians most often reported their practice had two physi-
cians (49.9%), was single specialty (66.8%), private practice
(67.2%), and in a suburban location (52.6%). More than one
third (36.6%) reported seeing mostly patients from minority
groups and about one fifth (20.2%) reported no definable major-
ity. The majority reported seeing Medicaid patients either along
with other types of insurance (67.6%) or solely (1.9%). Almost
half (44.5%) saw 20 to 29 patients daily. The majority reported
administering HPV vaccine in their practice (68.8%) and nearly
half were VFC providers (45.9%). More than half did not use a
strategy to get patients in for the first dose of HPV vaccine (52.5%),
but most used �1 strategies to get patients vaccinated with
subsequent doses (84.3%). Physicians reported using flagging
charts (16.6%), automatic prompts (22.2%), and electronic
queries (13.6%) to remind themselves to discuss HPV vaccine.
About three fourths reported having a vaccine coordinator
(72.2%).
The anonymous nature of the survey precludes examining the
degree to which survey responders and nonresponders were
similar on demographic and practice characteristics. However,
we were able to compare responding physicians to the population
of physicians in Florida, meeting our study eligibility criteria on
characteristics, including age, sex, and clinical specialty. We found
no statistically significant difference between responding physi-
cians and the larger population of Florida physicians for age, sex,
and clinical specialty (all P > 0.05).
Compared with older adolescent groups, a lower proportion of
physicians reported consistently (34.8%), strongly (42.9%), and
both consistently and strongly (30.6%) recommending HPV
vaccine to the 11- to 12-year-old group (Fig. 1). As shown
in Figs. 2 and 3, physicians' mean perceived personal barriers
score was 30.3 (SD ¼ 9.6; range: 16–61), and the mean perceived
parental barriers score was 37.0 (SD ¼ 8.9; range: 14–56). As
can be seen in Table 2, consistent and strong HPV vaccine
recommendation for 11 to 12 year olds was associated with the
following variables in univariate analyses: physician gender,
specialty, personal barriers, HPV knowledge, patient race, Med-
icaid patients seen, practice location, and all vaccine-specific
practice characteristics.
Within each domain (physician characteristics, general practice
characteristics, and vaccine-specific practice characteristics), a
multivariable analysis using a backward stepwise approach was
applied, starting with the significant univariate correlates in each
group (Table 2). Two physician characteristics were significantly
associated with consistent and strong recommendations: pediat-
ric specialty [adjusted OR (AOR) ¼ 2.55; 95% CI, 1.38–4.71] and
fewer (or lower) physician-reported barriers (AOR ¼ 0.94; 95%
CI, 0.90–0.97). The lone general practice characteristic was serving
Medicaid patients (OR ¼ 3.11; 95% CI, 1.48–6.53). The lone
vaccine-specific characteristic was being a VFC provider (OR ¼
6.48; 95% CI, 3.47–12.1).
A multivariable analysis was performed using backward
stepwise regression, starting with the significant correlates in
the domain-specific multivariable models (Table 2). In the
final multivariable model, fewer (or lower) physician barriers
(AOR ¼ 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88–0.94) and being a VFC provider
(AOR ¼ 5.43; 95% CI, 2.80–10.55) were statistically signif-
icant correlates of HPV vaccine recommendation in 11- to
12-year-olds.
Given that that the total score for physician barriers was
inversely associated with strong and consistent HPV vaccine
recommendations, we performed a post hoc analysis to explore
each of the 16 physician barriers as a correlate. The results of these

 analyses are presented in Table 3. Alpha was adjusted to 0.0031
(0.05/16) for univariate analyses and a ¼ 0.05 for multivariable
analyses. Ten of the 16 individual barriers were significant corre-
lates (left column). Only one of these 10 barriers was significant in
a multivariable model (middle column), highlighting the positive
correlation among the individual barriers which is also exhibited
in the relative high Cronbach a (0.88). The barriers that remained
statistically significant following a backward stepwise approach
(right column) were physician concern about vaccine safety,
concern about adding another vaccine to the schedule, and
remembering to discuss the vaccine.
Discussion
Recent efforts to improve physician recommendation for
HPV vaccination have focused on two critical components.
First, the recommendation should be consistent for all adoles-
cent males and females, particularly the 11- to 12-year-old age
group, for which routine vaccination is recommended. This is
clearly demonstrated by the 2011 (1) and 2015 (2) ACIP
guidelines endorsed by all professional medical societies that
provide preventive care to adolescent males. Second, as noted
in the President's Cancer Panel Report focused on HPV vacci-
nation, the recommendation must be strong (24). Our study
demonstrates that, despite available guidelines, a minority of
physicians indicated that they consistently (35%), strongly
(43%), and both consistently and strongly (31%) recommend
HPV vaccination to the target 11- to 12-year-old adolescent
male age group. Although our study focused on recommenda-
tion for males, studies that have examined differences in
recommendation by gender highlight a marked disparity in
vaccine recommendations between boys and girls (15–18).
Without immediate and targeted intervention, the nation is
unlikely to achieve Healthy People 2020 goal of 80% of 13- to
15-year-old adolescents receiving the entire 3-dose HPV vaccine
series (36).
Relative to physicians reporting high HPV vaccination barriers,
those reporting low barriers were more likely to consistently and
strongly recommend vaccination. This finding aligns with previ-
ous research reporting that barriers to vaccination were associated

 with physicians not strongly recommending HPV vaccination to
females ages 11 to 12 years (23) or offering the vaccine at all (37).
Thus, one approach to improving vaccination recommendation
may be to reduce provider barriers.
Barriers significantly associated with recommendation in the
current study included concerns about vaccine safety, adding
another vaccine to the schedule, and remembering to discuss
vaccination. Interestingly, a systematic review of provider com-
munication about HPV vaccination identified no studies dem-
onstrating an association between providers' perceptions of HPV
vaccine safety and their recommendation behaviors (38). How-
ever, our survey took place more recently than those included in
the systematic review and may reflect the cumulative impact of
media coverage that presents HPV vaccination in a controversial
political context and as a vaccine for females (39). Thus, providers
responding to our survey may be less aware of the safety of HPV
vaccine for males. The ACIP recommendations for universal male
HPV vaccination also coincided with political debates surround-
ing the vaccine during the 2012 presidential campaign (40). In
addition, physician concerns about safety may be influenced by
events such as the Japanese government's decision in June 2013 to
stop proactive recommendation of HPV vaccine due to safety
concerns (41, 42).
Physicians in our study also expressed concerns about adding
another vaccine to the schedule. This concern has been documen-
ted in the context of adding a new vaccine to the early childhood
immunization schedule (43) and HPV vaccination (20, 23). This
finding is particularly concerning and should be addressed when
suggesting that providers deliver a bundled recommendation that
includes HPV alongside tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertus-
sis (Tdap) and meningococcal vaccines, which are also recom-
mended at ages 11 to 12 for boys and girls (44).
Difficulty in remembering to discuss HPV vaccine with males
was the third barrier associated with recommendation for males.
Given the strong correlation between provider recommendation
and HPV vaccine uptake in males (45), providers forgetting to
discuss the vaccine offers one possible explanation for lower series
initiation rates in males compared with females, despite the 2011
ACIP recommendation for routine vaccination in age-eligible
males (1). The President's Cancer Panel recommends use of
provider reminders to reduce missed opportunities for HPV
vaccination (24). Almost two thirds of respondents (67%) did
not use any reminders to discuss HPV vaccination with patients
and approximately half (44%) used no strategy to get patients into
the office for the first dose. In our study, we specifically examined
the manual and electronic strategies for remembering to discuss
HPV vaccine with male patients and specific strategies to get
patients into the office for the first and subsequent dose(s) of
vaccine. Although our study found no association between use of
reminders and recommendation, it is possible that the relatively
small number of those using these approaches precluded detec-
tion of a statistically significant association.
One study found that clinics using an electronic health record–
based point-of-care reminder system targeting both clinicians and
patients resulted in significantly more young women initiating
and completing the HPV vaccine series in a timely fashion. The

 authors suggested that this combined strategy may have sup-
ported the creation of a common agenda that facilitates HPV
vaccine series initiation (46). A recent literature review of inter-
ventions to increase HPV vaccination rates suggested that there
was sufficient evidence to support the use of Community Pre-
ventive Task Force recommendations related to client reminder
and recall systems as well as provider assessment and feedback
(47). Thus, future interventions may benefit from considering
point-of-care reminders that simultaneously prompt physicians
and patients to discuss HPV vaccination (48).
In our study, physicians who participated in the VFC program
were more likely to recommend vaccination than those not
participating. VFC-enrolled providers administer to Medicaid-
eligible, uninsured, or American Indian or Alaska Native children

associated with the child's insurance coverage for the vaccine and

childhood vaccines than patients of non-VFC providers (52).

 VFC program reduces physicians' up-front costs by offering free
vaccines for VFC-eligible children (53). Providers also do not have
to send patients elsewhere to receive vaccines. It is also possible
that VFC providers also represent those who are more supportive
of vaccines overall and willing to offer in-office vaccination in
their practice setting. Future qualitative interviews with VFC and
non-VFC providers may help to further explore these possible
explanations.
To our knowledge, our study is among the first to focus
specifically on physicians' HPV vaccine recommendations for

 males after the ACIP guidelines for routine vaccination of
adolescent males. In addition, this is among the first observa-
tional studies to describe the current use of electronic and
manual reminders for both physicians and patients related to
HPV vaccination. This study has several notable strengths,
including a statewide sample of primary care providers and
an examination of physicians' recommendation with respect to
both consistency and strength. There are also limitations. Our
cross-sectional survey design precluded our ability to make
causal inferences about variables significantly associated with
recommendation of HPV vaccination. In addition, we surveyed
physicians from a single state; although this design limits our
ability to generalize findings to physicians practicing in our
states, it allowed us to focus on HPV vaccine recommendations
in a state with relatively high rates of HPV-related disease in
males. We provided quantitative "anchors" for our questions
regarding consistency but not strength of vaccine recommen-
dation. Physicians may vary in their interpretation of a strong
recommendation. Physicians may have reported socially desir-
able responses regarding practice behaviors; however, the ano-
nymity of the survey likely reduced this bias. Physicians most in
favor of HPV vaccination may have completed the survey,
possibly providing an overestimate of the proportion that
consistently and strongly recommend HPV vaccination. In our
sample, 31% of provider-reported HPV vaccine currently is not
administered to males in their clinical setting. However, we did
not include any follow-up questions as to why they currently do
not administer. It is possible that they simply do not vaccinate
in their office. Although less likely, they may specifically not
offer HPV vaccination for males. Finally, our study was limited
to physicians, although other health care providers may rec-
ommend HPV vaccination. Thus, study of groups delivering
care to adolescent males, such as nurses, medical assistants, and
physician assistants, is warranted.
Physician recommendation is key to increasing HPV vaccine
coverage; yet physicians' current HPV vaccine recommendations
do not align with national guidelines and U.S. health organiza-
tion recommendations. Interventions are needed to support HPV
vaccine recommendation consistency and strength. Our research
and others' suggest these interventions also should include edu-
cation about and strategies as well as policy level interventions to
address financial barriers to HPV vaccination. Current efforts to
bolster physician recommendation have largely been focused on
communication skills and office-based strategies to increase HPV
vaccination rates. For example, the CDC's You Are the Key
Campaign (54) largely provides patient and provider educational
materials and provider communication strategies. More recently,
the American Academy of Pediatrics HPV Champion Toolkit (55)
has extended resources provided in the You Are the Key Campaign
to include tools to facilitate change at the practice level (e.g.,
electronic health record–based reminder recalls). Our survey
found that Florida physicians' barriers to consistently and strongly
recommending HPV vaccine were related to concerns about
vaccine safety, concerns about adding vaccines to the vaccine
schedule, and difficulty in remembering to discuss HPV vaccina-
tion. These findings suggest that future interventions should
include components to address these issues at the physician and
practice level. By addressing physicians' challenges and support-
ing their HPV vaccine recommendations to their male patients, we
can increase HPV vaccine coverage in Florida and reduce HPV-
related disease.
