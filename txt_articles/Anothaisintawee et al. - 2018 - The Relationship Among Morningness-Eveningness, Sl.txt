Background: Circadian system is known to influence energy metabolism. Recent
evidence suggested that evening preference could be associated with higher body mass
index (BMI). Moreover, evening preference is known to be associated with insufficient
sleep duration and greater social jetlag, both described to be associated with obesity.
This study aimed to explore whether morningness-eveningness was directly associated
with BMI or its effect was transmitted through sleep duration or social jetlag in patients
with prediabetes.
Methods:
A
total
2,133
patients
with
prediabetes
were
enrolled.
Morningness-eveningness was assessed using a Composite Scale of Morningness
(CSM). Average weekly sleep duration and sleep timing were obtained, and social
jetlag was calculated. BMI was calculated by weight (kg)/height2 (m2). A mediation
analysis was performed based on two pathways, i.e. CSM→sleep→duration→BMI and
CSM→social jetlag→BMI. A sequential equation model was used to estimate the direct
and indirect effects of CSM on BMI.
Results:
Mean (SD) age and BMI were 63.6 (9.2) years and 25.8 (4.0) kg/m2.
For CSM→sleep duration→BMI pathway, every one point decrease in CSM (more
evening preference) was associated with a decrease in sleep duration by 0.054 h
(95% CI 0.043–0.066), whereas sleep duration was negatively associated with
BMI (coefficient = −0.156, 95%CI −0.288, −0.024). Mediation analysis indicated
that a change in CSM (from 90th to 10th percentile, more evening preference)
was associated with a decrease in sleep duration and an increase in BMI by
0.102 kg/m2 (95% CI 0.015, 0.207). In addition, this change in CSM was directly
associated with an increase in BMI by 0.511 kg/m2 (95%CI 0.030, 0.952). The
CSM→social jetlag→BMI pathway analysis revealed that social jetlag was not
significantly associated with BMI. A subgroup analysis in those aged ≤60 years (n
= 784) revealed that each hour increase in social jetlag was associated with an
increase in BMI by 0.56 kg/m2 (p = 0.026) while CSM and sleep duration were not.

Morningness-Eveningness and BMI in Prediabetes
Conclusion:
In patients with prediabetes, more evening preference was directly
associated with higher BMI and indirectly through insufficient sleep duration, while social
jetlag did not mediate the relationship between CSM and BMI. In those ≤60 years, only
greater social jetlag was associated with higher BMI. These data could inform further
interventional studies to reduce BMI in this high risk group.

INTRODUCTION
Diabetes is a global health problem. In the United States,
9.4% of the population, or 30.3 million people, were estimated
to have diabetes in 2015 (1). The world’s heaviest burden
of diabetes, however, is in the Western Pacific Region, with
159 million people having diabetes in 2017, with the number
expected to rise by 15% by 2045 (2). Prediabetes, a condition
in which blood glucose levels are elevated but do not yet meet
a criteria for diabetes, is a precursor which markedly increases
the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease
(1). Diabetes prevention with intensive lifestyle interventions
has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of diabetes
progression (3). In the Diabetes Prevention Program, exercise
and weight loss of 7% in patients with prediabetes resulted in
a 58% reduction in the risk of developing diabetes, confirming
the crucial role of adiposity in abnormal glucose metabolism
(3). Therefore, identifying novel factors influencing adiposity
in prediabetes patients could lead to interventions to prevent
diabetes in this high risk group.
The circadian system, controlled by the master circadian clock
located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus, is
known to play a major role in regulating daily rhythms of
metabolism, sleep/wake cycle, feeding behavior, and hormonal
secretions (4). There is evidence that circadian disruption
or circadian misalignment has detrimental effects on energy
metabolism. Experiments utilizing forced-desynchrony protocols
which the participants ate and slept on a recurring 28-h day
have been shown to result in reduced resting metabolic rate
and leptin levels (5, 6). Night shift work, often associated with
chronic circadian misalignment, has been shown to be a risk
factor for developing obesity (7). This could be partially due to
insufficient and/or poor-quality sleep, well-known risk factors
for obesity (8, 9) often observed in shift workers. In addition,
alterations in meal timing itself can affect circadian regulation
(10). In non-shift working population, milder forms of circadian
misalignment can be observed, such as in those with evening
preference.
The time of day during which individuals prefer to sleep
or perform daily activities denotes morningness-eveningness
or chronotype. Individuals with evening preference, typically
with a later bedtime than those with morning preference,
often have a greater degree of circadian misalignment between
behavioral rhythms and the endogenous central circadian
clock (11). More evening preference has been shown to be
associated with greater social jetlag, which is a phenomenon
resulting from shifting sleep timing between work days and
free days resembling traveling across time zones (12). Emerging
evidence from studies in adolescents as well as in general
population suggested that evening preference (or late bedtime)
and social jetlag were associated with increased adiposity (13–
15), although some found this relationship in overweight
individuals only (14). Whether evening preference is associated
with overweight/obesity in patients with prediabetes, a group
at high risk for developing diabetes, has not been previously
explored.
Therefore, this study aimed to explore the contribution of
morningness-eveningness preference to body mass index (BMI)
of patients with prediabetes. By employing mediation analyses,
we further examined if this association is mediated through
factors known to be associated with both eveningness and
obesity, including insufficient sleep duration and social jetlag,
or whether there is a direct contribution of morningness-
eveningness preference to BMI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This cross-sectional study utilized the baseline data from the
cohort study of prediabetes patients, which has been conducted
since October 2014 at the outpatient clinic of Department of
Family Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.
Prediabetes patients aged ≥18 years were recruited. Criteria used
for diagnosis prediabetes were fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
between 100 and 125 mg/dl (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) or hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) between 5.70 and 6.49% (38.80–47.44 mmol/mol) (16).
Patients were excluded if they had any of following: FPG ≥126
mg/dl (≥7.0 mmol/L), HbA1c level ≥6.5% (48.0 mmol/mol), or
were shift workers. The study’s protocol was approved by the
Ethical clearance Committee of Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol
University. All participants signed written informed consent.
Data Collection
Demographic data (i.e., age, sex, educational level), family
history of diabetes mellitus in first degree relatives, history
of smoking (never or current/past) and alcohol consumption
(never or current/past) were collected by trained interviewers.
Depressive symptoms, previously shown to be related to
overweight/obesity (17), were assessed using the Thai version of
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CESD) Scale
(18). Underlying diseases (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
chronic kidney disease defined as estimated glomerular filtration
rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and date of diagnosis of prediabetes
were reviewed from patient’s medical records by investigating
physicians (TA, ST, and DL). Height and weight were measured

Morningness-Eveningness and BMI in Prediabetes
with a digital scale (Seca 284, CA, U.S.A., precision to 0.1 cm
and 0.1 kg) at the date of enrollment by trained staff. BMI was
calculated by weight (kg)/height2 (m2).
Morningness-Eveningness Assessment
Morningness-eveningness preference was assessed using the
validated Thai version of the Composite Scale of Morningness
(CSM) (19). The CSM consists of 13 questions regarding the
preferred time individuals would like to wake up and go
to bed, preferred time for physical and mental activity, and
subjective alertness. The total score ranges from 13 (i.e., extreme
eveningness) to 55 (i.e., extreme morningness).
Subjective Sleep and Social Jetlag
Assessment
Participants were interviewed to collect the data of sleep
characteristics including sleep duration and sleep quality, as well
as social jetlag. Sleep duration was obtained by the question
of “During the past month, how many hours of actual sleep
did you get at night?” This question was asked separately
for weekdays and weekends. Average sleep duration was then
calculated as [(sleep duration on weekdays∗5) + (sleep duration
on weekend∗2)]/7.
To assess sleep quality over the previous month, we utilized
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score, also validated in
Thai (20). A modified PSQI score was created by removing the
sleep duration component to assess sleep quality independently
from sleep quantity (21). Higher scores reflect poorer sleep
quality.
The participants were also asked about their usual bedtime,
wake-up time, and sleep onset latency on weekdays and weekends
over previous month. Mid sleep time of weekdays and weekends
were estimated from these information as the midpoint between
sleep onset and wake time. Social jetlag (in hours) was then
calculated by the absolute difference between mid-sleep time on
weekdays and weekends.
Dietary Assessment
Information about all food and beverages intake in the past 24 h
before the date of interview were collected by 24-h food recall.
Time of the day (presented in 24-h clock time), types and portion
of food intake including beverages and snack of each meal were
collected. Total daily calorie intake was calculated by dieticians
using a Thai food database (INMUCAL-Nutrients V.3, Institute
of Nutrition, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand).
Physical Activity Assessment
The physical activity of study’s participants was assessed by
Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) version 2 (22).
This questionnaire asked about the time that participants spent
for vigorous- and moderate-intensity activities according to
work, travel to, and from places, and recreational activities.
The intensity of physical activities was measured as Metabolic
Equivalents (METs) that one MET was equivalent to a caloric
consumption of 1 kcal/kg/h, and four and eight METS were
assigned to the time spent in moderate and vigorous activities,
respectively. Total physical activity for each participant was then
calculated by summation of MET values of work, travel to and
from places, and recreational activities.
Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of the participants were presented as mean
(standard deviation, SD) or median (range) for continuous
data and as frequency and percentage for categorical data.
Univariate linear regression analysis was applied to assess the
association between study factor (i.e., CSM score) and mediators
(i.e., sleep duration and social jetlag) and BMI outcome. In
addition, associations between study factor, mediators, BMI, and
other covariables, including demographic variables (i.e., age, sex,
educational level), risk behavior (i.e., smoking and alcohol use),
depressive symptoms, modified PSQI, dietary parameters (i.e.,
breakfast and dinner time, and total daily calorie) and physical
activity were assessed.

Morningness-Eveningness and BMI in Prediabetes
Mediation analysis for continuous data was then applied to
assess the direct effect of morningness-eveningness preference
(CSM score) on BMI and indirect effects of CSM score on BMI
mediated by sleep duration and social jetlag.
Causal pathways among CSM score, sleep duration, social
jetlag, and BMI were constructed as illustrated in Figure 1.
According to these pathways, three equations were constructed
as follows.

Sleep duration was regressed on CSM score (a1) as shown in
Equation (1). Social jetlag was then regressed on CSM score
(a2) as shown in Equation (2). Finally, BMI was fitted on sleep
duration mediator (path b1), social jetlag mediator (path b2), and
CSM score as direct effect (path c) as shown in Equation (3).
The three equations were adjusted for confounding factors, which
were significantly associated with each equation including age,
sex, educational level, smoking, and alcohol use, modified PSQI
score, CESD score, dinner, and breakfast time. Product coefficient
method was applied to estimate the average causal mediation
effect (ACME) of sleep duration (a1b1) and social jetlag (a2b2).
In addition, two sensitivity analyses were performed. Because
dietary recall is subjected to bias especially with regards to caloric
intake, we performed analyses excluding caloric consumption
data. We also analyzed the participants according to age since
social jetlag is known to be more prevalent in younger age (14).
Since our population’s mean age was 63.6 years, we divided them
into >60 years or ≤60 years according to Thai’s definition of
elderly (23).
A bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replications was used to
estimate ACMEs and their 95% confidence interval (CI) using
bias-corrected bootstrap technique. All analyses were performed
using STATA version 14. P < 0.05 was considered as significant
level for all tests.

A total of 2,133 prediabetes patients were eligible for this
study. Baseline characteristics of participants are presented in
Table 1. Means (SD) age and BMI of participants were 63.6 (9.2)
years and 25.8 (4.0) kg/m2. Percentages of female, current/past

with higher BMI. In addition, younger age, being female, and
lower educational level were associated with higher BMI. Higher
physical activity was associated with lower BMI, but the result
was not statistically significant. Total daily calories, but not meal
timing, were associated with BMI.
For sleep duration, the results revealed that more evening
preference, along with lower modified PSQI score, younger
age, being female, non-smoking, non-alcohol use and greater
depressive symptoms were significantly associated with shorter
sleep duration. In addition, earlier breakfast time and later dinner
time were also associated with shorter sleep duration.
For social jetlag, more evening preference (lower CSM score)
was significantly associated with greater social jetlag. In addition,
younger age, higher educational level, smoking, and later dinner
time were also associated with a greater amount of social jetlag.
Mediation Analysis
Because more evening preference was associated with both
mediators (i.e., shorter sleep duration and greater social jetlag)
and higher BMI, and both mediators (i.e., shorter sleep duration
and greater social jetlag) were associated with higher BMI, we
further explored if the association between CSM score and
BMI was mediated by sleep duration and/or social jetlag. Two
mediation equations for sleep duration and social jetlag and
one outcome equation for BMI were constructed, adjusting for
age, sex, smoking, alcohol use, educational level, modified PSQI,
CESD, breakfast time, dinner time, and total daily calories. Their
coefficients adjusted for confounding factors are illustrated in
Table 3.
The results from the mediation equation of sleep duration
showed that every one unit increase in CSM score (more morning
preference) was significantly associated with an increase in sleep
duration by 0.055 h (95% CI: 0.043, 0.066). For the equation of
social jetlag mediator, the result suggested that increased CSM
score (more morning preference) was significantly associated
with decreased social jetlag with the coefficient of −0.008 (95%
CI: −0.012, −0.004).
The results of the BMI outcome model (Table 3) revealed
that increased sleep duration was significantly associated with
decreased BMI, with a coefficient of −0.156 (95% CI: −0.288,
−0.024). More morning preference (higher CSM score) was also
significantly associated with lower BMI (p = 0.024). Social jetlag,
however, was not significantly associated with BMI (p = 0.132).
A bootstrap with 1,000 replications was then applied to
estimate the ACMEs of CSM score on BMI mediated by sleep
duration (ACME1), social jetlag (ACME2) and to estimate the
direct effect of CSM on BMI (c′), see Table 4. The results revealed
the ACME1 was significant, i.e., that every one unit increase in
CSM score (more morning preference) would be associated with
an increase in sleep duration, which then significantly decreased
BMI by 0.0085 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.0167, 0.0003). However, the
association between CSM score and BMI mediated by social
jetlag was not significant (ACME2 = −0.0022, 95% CI: −0.0056,
0.0011). In addition, we found that there was also a direct effect
of CSM on BMI such that every one unit increase in CSM score
(more morning preference) was associated with a decrease in
BMI by 0.043 kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.080, −0.005).
Additional analyses were performed excluding caloric intake
from the models. The results were similar. Bootstrap analysis
revealed that the ACME1 was significant, i.e., that every one
unit increase in CSM score (more morning preference) would
be associated with an increase in sleep duration, which then

significantly decreased BMI by 0.008 kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.016,
−0.0006). The association between CSM score and BMI mediated
by social jetlag was not significant. There was also a direct effect
of CSM on BMI such that every one unit increase in CSM score
(more morning preference) was associated with a decrease in
BMI by 0.042 kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.079, −0.004).
The distribution of CSM score was explored with 10th, 50th,
and 90th percentile of 40, 47, and 52, respectively. A difference
in CSM score between 90th and 10th percentile in our cohort (12
points, more evening preference) was associated with a decrease
in sleep duration and an increase in BMI by 0.102 kg/m2 (95% CI
0.015, 0.207), and was directly associated with an increase in BMI
by 0.511 kg/m2 (95%CI 0.030, 0.952). Percentages of mediation
effects of sleep duration and social jetlag on BMI were 15.94 and
4.20%, respectively, while the direct effect by CSM contributed
79.86% (Table 4).
Subgroup Analysis by Age (≤60 vs. >60
Years)
Mediation analysis in participants aged ≤60 years is shown in
Table 5. The BMI outcome model revealed that sleep duration
and CSM score were not associated with BMI. However, greater
social jetlag was significantly associated with BMI. Every 1 h
increase in social jetlag was associated with higher BMI by 0.56
kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.06, 1.06).

ACME, average causal mediation effect.
Mediation analysis in participants aged ≥60 years is shown
in Table 6. The BMI outcome model revealed that increased
sleep duration was significantly associated with decreased BMI,
with a coefficient of −0.283 (95% CI: −0.439, −0.126). More
morning preference (higher CSM score) was also significantly
associated with lower BMI (p = 0.008). Social jetlag, however, was
not significantly associated with BMI (p = 0.962). A bootstrap
with 1,000 replications was then performed (Table 7). The
results revealed the ACME1 was significant, i.e., that every one
unit increase in CSM score (more morning preference) would
be associated with an increase in sleep duration, which then
significantly decreased BMI by 0.016 kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.028,
−0.005). However, the association between CSM score and BMI
mediated by social jetlag was not significant (ACME2 = 0.00007,
95% CI: −0.003, 0.003). In addition, we found that there was also
a direct effect of CSM on BMI such that every one unit increase
in CSM score (more morning preference) was associated with a
decrease in BMI by 0.059 kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.106, −0.013).
DISCUSSION
In this large cohort of patients with prediabetes who were non-
shift workers, we demonstrated that more evening preference
was independently associated with higher BMI, after adjusting for
multiple covariates. This was mainly due to a direct relationship
(estimated at 80%) and also was partly mediated by shorter sleep
duration (estimated at 16%). This was especially true for our
participants who were older than 60 years. In this group, while
greater social jetlag was associated with more evening preference,
it was neither significantly associated with BMI after adjusting
for confounders, nor did it mediate the relationship between
morningness-eveningness and BMI. For participants aged ≤60
years, social jetlag was a predominant predictor of BMI while
evening preference did not play a significant role. This could
possibly be due to the finding that social jetlag was greater in
younger group in our study (p = <0.001) which was similar to
previous report (14).
In our cohort, a difference in CSM score between 90th and
10th percentile (more evening preference) was associated with an
increase in BMI by 0.102 kg/m2 mediated through sleep duration,
and was directly associated with an increase in BMI by 0.511
kg/m2. In those aged ≤60 years, 1 h increase in social jetlag
was associated with an increase in BMI by 0.556 kg/m2.These
effect sizes could be clinically significant, as in the Diabetes
Prevention Program, 7% weight loss (approximately a 2.2 kg/m2
reduction in BMI in this population with baseline weight of
94.2 kg) by diet and exercise in participants with impaired
glucose tolerance resulted in a 58% reduction in the risk of
developing diabetes during a follow up of 2.8 years (3). Our
results highlight the relationship between circadian preference,
social jetlag, sleep duration, and adiposity, further supporting the
role of circadian regulation on BMI. These results could inform
further interventional studies to reduce BMI in this patient group
who are at high risk of developing diabetes. Whether circadian
preference and social jetlag represent risk factors for future
diabetes development requires further follow up of this cohort.
Mechanisms underlying the relationship between circadian
regulation and energy metabolism were elucidated in well-
controlled experiments inducing circadian misalignment. After
10 days of forced-desynchrony in 10 healthy participants, leptin
levels decreased by 17% and a daily cortisol rhythm reversed
(5). In a separate experiment combining sleep restriction and
circadian misalignment for 3 weeks, mimicking night shift
work, leptin profile was observed to be slightly decreased
while ghrelin profile slightly increased, along with an 8%
reduction in resting metabolic rate (6). Furthermore, a 6-
day inpatient simulated night shift protocol led to a 3%
decrease in total energy expenditure as measured by a whole-
room calorimeter (24). These data are supported by emerging
evidence from population-based studies focusing on the role
of evening preference, typically associated with mild form of
circadian misalignment, and overweight/obesity. In a study of
511 adolescents, evening types had significantly higher BMI z-
scores than morning types (15). Furthermore, evening preference
has been shown to be associated with weight gain (25) or
failed attempts to lose weight (26, 27). In the National Weight
Control Registry, morning chronotype was associated with
weight loss maintenance (26). Among 252 severely obese adults
undergoing bariatric surgery, those who were evening-type had
significantly higher BMI and higher weight regain 4 years
after surgery than those who were morning-type (27). The
results from the current study are in agreement with these data
and provide significant evidence of the relationship between
evening preference and BMI in patients with prediabetes,

a group which BMI is an important predictor of diabetes
development.
Those with more evening preference may have certain
behaviors
which
contribute
to
the
relationship
between
eveningness and BMI. Evening types were described to be
associated with insufficient sleep duration (28, 29), the findings
confirmed in our study. This could possibly be due to preferred
later sleep timing with the need to wake up earlier than desired
to conform to the general society’s schedule. The mechanisms
linking insufficient sleep and increased obesity risk have been
well-characterized in experimental sleep restriction studies,
including alterations in appetite regulating hormones (30–32),
increased hunger/appetite and unhealthy food consumption
(33–35), and little or no change in energy expenditure which
could not compensate for increased caloric intake (36–38). The
results from these experimental studies are well-supported by
epidemiological studies linking short sleep to obesity (39). In a
meta-analysis of over 600,000 adults, each hour of shorter sleep
duration was associated with 0.35 kg/m2 change in BMI (39).
Insufficient sleep may also hinder the effectiveness of weight loss.
In an experiment involving 10 overweight adults for 14 days,
those sleeping 8.5 h had a greater loss of fat-free body mass than
those assigned to 5.5 h time in bed (40). Emerging data suggested
that adequate sleep may be beneficial in weight loss. In a study of
10 overweight adults with short habitual sleep duration (<6.5 h),
home sleep extension for 2 weeks (by 1.6 h) was associate
with a 14% decrease in overall appetite and a 62% decrease in
desire for sweet and salty foods (41). In another study of 123
obese/overweight individuals who underwent a low calorie diet
intervention for 14–24 weeks, longer self-reported sleep duration

and better sleep quality were associated with greater fat mass loss
measured by a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (42). A recent
randomized study explored the effects of caloric restriction
with or without sleep restriction for 8 weeks (43). While both
groups lost similar amount of weight, sleep restriction group
(average sleep reduction of 169 min/week) lost significantly
less proportion of total mass lost as fat (43). Our data, derived
exclusively from prediabetes patients, supported these previous
findings and suggested that sleep extension should be explored
as an adjunct to diet and exercise in reducing diabetes risk.
Besides sleep duration, other behaviors associated with more
evening preference could be contributing to increased BMI.
Greater social jetlag, often seen in those with more evening
preference, was described to be associated with higher BMI in
those with baseline BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 in a large population based
study of more than 60,000 individuals in Europe (14). Our study,
with participants’ mean BMI of 25.8 kg/m2, revealed that social
jetlag, a marker of circadian misalignment, was associated with
BMI in those aged ≤60 years. This was likely due to greater
social jetlag in younger age group. This result was in agreement
with a recent study of participants with non-communicable
chronic diseases (mean age 55 years) which revealed the
association between social jetlag and being overweight (44). In
older participants, despite the association between social jetlag
and evening preference, social jetlag was not an independent
predictor of BMI after adjusting for other covariates, thus other
factors could play a role. Meal timing, an important input of the
circadian system, could be a factor, as delayed or mistimed meals
could lead to alterations and uncoupling between the central and
peripheral oscillators (10, 45). Consuming food at a later time

of the day was shown to be associated with higher BMI (46),
development of obesity (47) and less weight loss in response to
weight loss therapy (48, 49). In our cohort, however, later dinner
time was associated with lower BMI. This could possibly be due
to recall bias of the dietary information, or that the relationship
between meal timing and individual circadian timing is more
important than the meal time as expressed by clock time itself.
This was supported by a recent study in 110 young adults which
found that consumption of food during the circadian evening
(as assessed by dim-light melatonin onset) was associated with
higher BMI while the clock hour of food consumption had no
effects (50). Besides dinner time, breakfast is another important
factor as evening types were associated with breakfast skipping or
morning anorexia (51, 52). Less caloric consumption at breakfast
or breakfast skipping were shown to be related to increased
adiposity (53, 54) and sleep-wake irregularity (55).
In addition to social jetlag and meal timing, evening types
generally prefer later sleep timing. This could be associated with
greater exposure of light at night leading to circadian disruption.
Experimental exposure to blue light 2 h before bedtime in young
men led to decreased energy expenditure during the following
morning (56). Population based studies have also supported
the association between light at night and overweight/obesity
(57, 58). Sleep time in our cohort, while correlated with CSM, was
not an independent predictor of BMI (data not shown) but the
information on light exposure at night was not available. Lastly,
more evening preference has been shown to be associated with
unhealthy diet, which could contribute to obesity in a long term
(15, 59). It is likely that a combination of these factors, rather than
any alone, contributes to overweight/ obesity in those with more
evening preference. Whether comprehensively targeting these
behaviors associated with more evening preference will reduce
BMI and possibly future diabetes risk, and the contribution of
each factor, is a subject of future research.
Given that the study was performed only in Thai population,
some differences from other population should be noted.
According to the CSM cutoff, our population mostly had
morning preference (a cutoff of 44) (60). It is known that
geographic location, likely due to temperature and sun light
exposure, is related to circadian preference with countries closer
to the equator being more morning (61, 62). Alternatively, a
cutoff based on population has been suggested using 10th and
90th percentile for evening and morning preference, respectively
(60). Even though our population had relatively more morning
preference, we did see a relationship between CSM and BMI
across CSM continuum. Another aspect which could be culturally
related is meal timing. Breakfast and dinner timing in this cohort
are typical of our population which differ from some others
such as Spain which typical lunch time is 3 p.m. (48) or in the
United States that eating intervals often extend beyond 15 h (63).
These differences could play a role our results on relationship
between meal timing and BMI.
Our study has the strengths of enrolling a large number
of participants with prediabetes, along with comprehensive
assessments of circadian preference, sleep and dietary intake.
However, there are limitations. The study was conducted at
one medical center in Thailand, and thus may not reflect
findings in a general population. Sleep assessments, although
obtained through validated questionnaires, were subjective.
Dietary recall is subject to imprecision such as participants’
ability to recall their food intake and timing, and a tendency
to underreport which is a well-known phenomenon (64). An
average of only 1,027 calories per day could be possibly related
to the attempt of the participants to limit their food intake
prior to their doctor’s visit when most of the assessments
occurred. However, excluding the caloric information did not
alter the results of our analyses. In addition, the information
on light exposure, especially at night, is not available in this
study.
In summary, in patients with prediabetes, more evening
preference was directly associated with higher BMI and indirectly
through insufficient sleep duration. These data supported the
importance of circadian regulation in energy metabolism and
could inform further interventional studies to reduce BMI in this
high risk group.
