Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex syndrome characterized by a preserved ejection fraction 
but increased diastolic stiffness and abnormalities of filling. Although the prevalence of HFpEF is high and continues to rise, 
no effective therapies exist; however, the diabetic drug metformin has been associated with improved diastolic function 
in diabetic patients. Here we determine the therapeutic potential of metformin for improving diastolic function in a mouse 
model with HFpEF-like symptoms. We combine transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery with deoxycorticosterone 
acetate (DOCA) supplementation to obtain a mouse model with increased diastolic stiffness and exercise intolerance. 
Echocardiography and pressure–volume analysis reveal that providing metformin to TAC/DOCA mice improves diastolic 
function in the left ventricular (LV) chamber. Muscle mechanics show that metformin lowers passive stiffness of the LV wall 
muscle. Concomitant with this improvement in diastolic function, metformin-treated TAC/DOCA mice also demonstrate 
preserved exercise capacity. No metformin effects are seen in sham operated mice. Extraction experiments on skinned 
ventricular muscle strips show that the metformin-induced reduction of passive stiffness in TAC/DOCA mice is due to an 
increase in titin compliance. Using phospho-site-specific antibodies, we assay the phosphorylation of titin’s PEVK and N2B 
spring elements. Metformin-treated mice have unaltered PEVK phosphorylation but increased phosphorylation of PKA 
sites in the N2B element, a change which has previously been shown to lower titin’s stiffness. Consistent with this result, 
experiments with a mouse model deficient in the N2B element reveal that the beneficial effect of metformin on LV chamber 
and muscle stiffness requires the presence of the N2B element. We conclude that metformin offers therapeutic benefit 
during HFpEF by lowering titin-based passive stiffness.

Introduction
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a com-
plex syndrome with preserved systolic function but diastolic 
stiffening that contributes to filling abnormalities. The culmi-
nation of these changes is left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, 
decreased cardiac reserve, and pulmonary edema (Norman et 
al., 2011; Borlaug, 2014). The prevalence of HFpEF is increasing 
and is predicted to exceed 8% of persons older than 65 by the 
year 2020 (van Heerebeek and Paulus, 2016). Studies on myo-
cardial biopsies from HFpEF patients have revealed alterations in 
myocardial structure, function, and signaling. These alterations 
include cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, 
increased cardiomyocyte stiffness, and down-regulation of cy-
clic guanosine monophosphate–protein kinase G (cGMP-PKG; 
Yusuf et al., 2003; Linke and Hamdani, 2014; van Heerebeek 
and Paulus, 2016).
Muscle stiffness is determined by both the elastic protein titin 
and the extracellular matrix (ECM) with the former dominating 
at physiological sarcomere lengths (Granzier and Labeit, 2006; 
Linke and Hamdani, 2014). A recent study measured the ECM- 
and titin-based passive tension in myocardial biopsies from 
HFpEF patients and found increased stiffness in both ECM and 
titin (Zile et al., 2015). Titin-based stiffness is determined by rel-
ative expression of the stiffer (N2B) and more compliant (N2BA) 
isoforms and by various posttranslation modifications including 
phosphorylation of spring elements within titin (LeWinter and 
Granzier, 2014). Phosphorylation of the cardiac-specific N2B 
spring element of titin by PKA and PKG is known to reduce car-
diomyocyte stiffness, while PKC phosphorylation of the PEVK 
spring element increases stiffness (Hidalgo and Granzier, 2013). 
Increased phosphorylation of PKC sites and decreased phosphor-

Metformin ameliorates diastolic dysfunction

ylation of PKA sites are present in HFpEF patients, consistent 
with the increased measured stiffness of titin (Zile et al., 2015).
Unlike heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, pharma-
cological approaches to treating HFpEF do not currently exist, 
and earlier clinical HFpEF trials have been plagued by neutral re-
sults (Yusuf et al., 2003; Massie et al., 2008; Redfield et al., 2012, 
2013). For example, the REL 
AX trail was designed to enhance 
PKG activity through PDE-5 inhibition, but clinical outcomes in 
the treated group were similar to placebo (Redfield et al., 2012, 
2013). Given the lack of effective HFpEF therapies, additional 
therapeutic approaches are of great interest. Our present work 
on metformin, a drug commonly used for treatment of type 2 di-
abetes, was motivated by the finding in patients with diabetes 
that metformin is associated with improved LV diastolic function 
(Andersson et al., 2010). Additionally, the ongoing clinical trial 
Metformin in the Diastolic Dysfunction of Metabolic Syndrome 
investigates whether the effect of adding metformin to standard 
treatment of patients with metabolic syndrome ameliorates 
diastolic dysfunction (Ladeiras-Lopes et al., 2014). To evaluate 
whether metformin might have a beneficial effect on diastolic 
function in HFpEF, we studied metformin in a mouse model with 
HFpEF-like characteristics. The HFpEF was induced through 
transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to increase after-
load with concomitant mineralocorticoid supplementation (de-
oxycorticosterone acetate [DOCA]). This is a mouse model with 
HFpEF characteristics such as increased LV stiffness (both car-
diomyocyte and ECM derived), diastolic dysfunction, concentric 
hypertrophy, preserved ejection fraction, and exercise intoler-
ance (Mohammed et al., 2010; Methawasin et al., 2016). Addition-
ally, we studied a mouse model in which we had deleted the N2B 
element within cardiac titin (N2B KO) resulting in a restrictive 
filling pattern and increased diastolic wall stress (Radke et al., 
2007). We aimed to determine whether diastolic function can be 
improved in these models through treatment with metformin. 
Our findings establish that metformin improves diastolic func-
tion in the TAC/DOCA model, at both the LV chamber and iso-
lated muscle levels. On the molecular level, metformin increases 
phosphorylation levels of PKA sites within titin’s N2B element as 
determined with phospho-site-specific antibodies.
The notion that metformin works through titin’s N2B element 
is supported by the lack of a metformin effect in a mouse model 
that is deficient in the N2B element.
Materials and methods
Mice and TAC/DOCA procedure
Mice on a C57BL/6J background were used for all experiments. 
We used both WT control animals and N2B KO mice that had 
the N2B element (exon 49) removed as described (Radke et al., 
2007). In the N2B KO the deletion of exon 49 leads to splicing of 
exons 48–50, removing 2,646 bp (882 aa), which maintains the 
open reading frame. Mice were studied either at baseline or fol-
lowing either sham or TAC/DOCA surgery. The TAC/DOCA mice 
underwent surgery and pellet implantation as described below. 
Minimally invasive TAC was performed on 10-wk-old male mice 
as described previously with modification (Methawasin et al., 
2016). In brief, mice were anesthetized using a single injection 
of ketamine and xylazine (120 and 12 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and 
a 5-mm horizontal incision was made at the first left intercos-
tal space. The thymus was temporarily retracted to visualize the 
aortic arch, and a 7–0 silk suture was passed under the aorta be-
tween the right innominate and left carotid arteries. The suture 
was ligated around a blunted 27-gauge needle, and the needle was 
quickly removed. The chest wall and skin were closed. An addi-
tional incision was made in the right flank of the animal, and a 
subcutaneous pocket was created by blunt dissection. A DOCA 
(50 mg per pellet, 21-d release) pellet (Innovative Research of 
America) was implanted. The skin was closed, and the mice were 
allowed to recover in a ThermoCare warmer. Sham animals un-
derwent the same procedure without ligation around the aorta 
or implantation of a DOCA pellet. All experiments were approved 
by the University of Arizona Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee and followed the U.S. National Institutes of Health 
Using Animals in Intramural Research guidelines for animal use.
Metformin
Metformin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the drinking water 
of adult TAC/DOCA mice (individually housed) 1 wk after sur-
gery and was maintained for 5 wk. To get a correct dosage, mice 
were weighed and water intake was tracked, and metformin was 
dissolved in water to achieve a dose of 0.2 mg/g BM/day. This is 
within the range of previous rodent studies (Senesi et al., 2016; 
Sun and Yang, 2017) and aligns with levels achieved in routine 
diabetes treatment (Chandel et al., 2016).
Echocardiography
Echocardiography was performed as previously described (Radke 
et al., 2007; Mohammed et al., 2010; Bull et al., 2016). Mice were 
anesthetized under 1% isoflurane (USP Phoenix) in oxygen mix-
ture, then placed in dorsal recumbence on a heated platform for 
echocardiography. Transthoracic echo images were obtained 
with a Vevo 2100 High Resolution Imaging System (Visual-Son-
ics) using the model MS550D scan head designed for murine car-
diac imaging, and MS250 scan head was used to measure aortic 
flow velocity at the site of constricted aorta. Care was taken to 
avoid animal contact and excessive pressure that could induce 
bradycardia. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C. Imaging 
was performed at a depth setting of 1 cm. Images were collected 
and stored as a digital cine loop for offline calculations. Standard 
imaging planes, M-mode, Doppler, and functional calculations 
were obtained according to American Society of Echocardiog-
raphy guidelines. The parasternal long axis view and mid wall 
cross-sectional view of the LV were used to guide calculations of 
percentage fractional shortening, percentage ejection fraction, 
and ventricular dimensions and volumes. In addition, the left 
atrial dimension was measured in the long-axis view directly 
below the aortic valve leaflets. Passive LV filling peak velocity, E 
(cm/s), and atrial contraction flow peak velocity, A (cm/s), were 
acquired from the images of mitral valve Doppler flow from tilted 
parasternal long-axis views. A sweep speed of 100 mm/s was 
used for M-mode and Doppler studies. The heart rates of animals 
during echocardiographic study were maintained in the range 
of 500–550 beats per minute for M-mode, 500–550 beats per 
minute for B-mode, and 400–500 beats per minute for Doppler

studies. Measures of diastolic function, specifically the relation-
ship between early and late filling (E/A ratio) and how quickly 
the flow velocity declines in early diastole (E-wave deceleration 
time), are reported.
Pressure–volume analysis
In vivo pressure–volume analysis was performed in mice 5 wk 
after metformin/vehicle treatment (6 wk after TAC) using a Sci-
Sense Advantage Admittance Derived Volume Measurement Sys-
tem and 1.2F catheters with 4.5-mm electrode spacing (SciSense). 
Mice were anesthetized and ventilated with 1% isoflurane using 
an SAR-1000 Ventilator (CWE Inc.), and body was temperature 
maintained at 37°C using a MouseMonitor S platform (Indus In-
struments). Mice were secured, and the abdomen was opened 
below the sternum. The apex of the LV was punctured using 
a 28-gauge needle, and the catheter was advanced into the LV. 
The inferior vena cava was located and occluded during a sigh 
(pause) in ventilation to acquire load-independent indexes. Data 
acquisition and analysis was performed in LabScribe2 (iWorx). 
Pressure–volume data were analyzed using a monoexponential 
fit (P = AeβV + c) with the exponent (β) reported as the stiffness 
(Burkhoff et al., 2005).
Treadmill exercise tolerance test
Mice were run on an indirect colorimetry treadmill (TSE Sys-
tems) before and 6 wk after TAC/DOCA procedure. Mice under-
went a graded exercise tolerance test until exhaustion as follows 
(speed, duration, incline grade): 0 m/min, 3 min, 0°; 6 m/min, 
2 min, 0°; 9 m/min, 2 min, 5°; 12 m/min, 2 min, 10°; 15 m/min, 2 
min, 15°; 18 m/min, 1 min, 15°; 21 m/min, 1 min, 15°; 23 m/min, 
1 min, 15°; and +1 m/min, each 1 min thereafter, 15°. Exhaustion 
was defined as the point at which mice maintained continuous 
contact with the shock grid for 5 s or 20 visits to the shock grid 
in a 1-min period. During testing, gas was collected continuously 
and analyzed every 5 s. PhenoMaster software (TSE Systems) 
recorded and calculated oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon 
dioxide consumption (VCO2), the respiratory exchange ratio 
(RER), distance run, and visits to the shock grid. The VO2max was 
determined by the peak VO2 reached during this test when RER 
was >1.0. Maximum running speed was defined as the treadmill 
speed at which VO2max was achieved. Mice failing to reach an RER 
>1.0 were excluded.
Muscle mechanics
Mice were placed under isoflurane anesthesia and cervically dis-
located, and the ribcage was rapidly opened to access the heart. 
1 ml HEP 
ES, pH 7.4 (in mM: NaCL, 133.5; KCl, 5; NaH2PO4, 1.2; 
MgSO4,1.2; HEP 
ES, 10), solution containing 30 mM KCl and 3 mM 
2,3-butanedione monoxime was injected into the LV through the 
apex, after which time the heart noticeably relaxed and ceased 
pumping. The heart was removed and the LV was isolated from 
the other chambers. The apex and base were removed from the 
LV leaving a cross-sectional slice ∼2 mm thick. The septum and 
right ventricular attachment regions were discarded, and the LV 
free wall tissue was placed in relaxing solution (in mM: 20 BES, 
10 EGTA, 6.56 MgCl2, 5.88 NaATP, 1 DTT, 46.35 K-propionate, 15 
creatine phosphate, pH 7.0). Endocardial fibers (apical to base 
orientation) were dissected and discarded. Once visualized, mid-
myocardial fibers (circumferential orientation) were carefully 
removed and skinned in fresh relaxing solution, pH 7.0, with 1% 
Triton X-100 (Pierce) overnight at 4°C and protease inhibitors 
(PMSF, 0.5 mM; leupeptin, 0.04 mM; E64, 0.01 mM), then washed 
for 1 h with relaxing solution. 1 ml Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 
2 (P5726; Sigma-Aldrich) was added into 100 ml relaxing solution. 
Immediately after the wash with relaxing solution, 150- to 250-
µm (diameter) strips were dissected, and aluminum clips were 
placed on both ends of the preparation. The aluminum clips were 
attached to a strain gauge force transducer and high-speed length 
motor, and the preparation was submersed in relaxing solution. 
A laser diffraction system was used to measure the sarcomere 
length by taking advantage of Bragg’s law (dsinθ = mλ) to cal-
culate sarcomere length (d) based on the wavelength (λ), peak 
order (m), and angle (θ). The length and cross-sectional area of 
the fiber were then measured in order to normalize measured 
forces to cross-sectional area. Once the fiber was mounted and 
measured, a stretch–hold–release protocol was used in which 
a skinned fiber dissected from the circumferentially aligned 
free wall was stretched to a given sarcomere length within the 
physiological range, held for 90 s, and subjected to a sinusoidal 
frequency sweep. Because cardiac muscle is viscoelastic, the si-
nusoidal frequency sweep was used to quantify the viscous and 
elastic moduli. Viscous and elastic moduli are defined as (σ/ε)
sin(θ) and (σ/ε)cos(θ), respectively, where σ is stress, ε is strain, 
and θ is the phase shift. To quantify the relative contributions of 
titin and ECM, skinned muscle strips were extracted using first 
0.6 M KCl in relaxing solution followed by 1.0 M KI in relaxing 
solution to depolymerize the thick and thin filaments, respec-
tively, removing the anchoring points of titin but keeping ECM 
intact (Granzier and Irving, 1995; Wu et al., 2000). Repeating 
the same initial protocol after extraction allows for calculation 
of titin-based stiffness by subtracting the postextraction (ECM) 
curve from the preextraction (total) curve.
Titin isoform expression
The LV tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and solubi-
lized between glass pestles cooled in liquid nitrogen. Tissues 
were primed at −20°C for a minimum of 20 min, then suspended 
in 50% urea buffer ([in mol/liter] 8 Urea, 2 Thiourea, 0.05 Tris-
HCl, 0.075 Dithiothreitol with 3% SDS, and 0.03% Bromophe-
nol blue, pH 6.8) and 50% glycerol with protease inhibitors ([in 
mmol/liter] 0.04 E64, 0.16 Leupeptin, and 0.2 PMSF) at 60°C for 
10 min. Then the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 
5 min, aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 
−80°C (Lahmers et al., 2004). Using agarose gel electrophoresis, 
total titin, N2B titin, N2BA titin, and T2 were analyzed. Briefly, 
the solubilized samples were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels 
using a vertical SDS-agarose gel system (Hoefer; Warren et al., 
2003a,b). Gels were run at 15 mA per gel for 3 h and 20 min, then 
stained using Coomassie brilliant blue (Acros organics), scanned 
using a commercial scanner (Epson 800; Epson Corporation), 
and analyzed with One-D scan (Scanalytics Inc.). Each sample 
was loaded in a range of five volumes, and the integrated optical 
densities (IOD) of titin and myosin heavy chain were determined 
as a function of loading volume. The slope of the linear relation-

ship between IOD and loading was obtained for each protein to 
quantify expression ratios (Hidalgo et al., 2009).
Splicing analysis
The dual luciferase assay and cell viability assays have previously 
been described (Liss et al., 2018). In brief, human embryonic 
kidney (HEK293.EBNA) cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and 
transfected with splice reporter plus RBM20 or pcDNA3.1 control 
plasmid using PEI40. 24 h later, Metformin was applied at nine 
serial twofold dilutions starting at 20 µM, and luciferase activity 
was measured 60 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase 
Reporter Assay System (Promega). Ratios of firefly to renilla 
luciferase activity were normalized to the control (pcDNA3.1). 
Cell viability was measured 60 h after transfection using a re-
sazurin-based staining of metabolically active cells (PrestoBlue; 
Life Technologies).
Phosphorylation
Solubilized samples were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in a vertical 
gel electrophoresis chamber. Gels run at 15 mA per gel for 3 h and 
20 min were then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Immobi-
lon-FL; Millipore) using a semidry transfer unit (Trans-Blot Cell; 
Bio-Rad). Blots were then probed with primary antibodies (de-
scribed below) followed with secondary antibodies conjugated 
with fluorescent dyes with infrared excitation spectra (Biotium 
Company). Blots were scanned using an Odyssey Infrared Imag-
ing System (Li-COR Biosciences), and the images were analyzed 
using Li-COR software. Signal was normalized to total protein 
transferred quantified either by Ponceau S (Sigma) staining 
(S11878, S12022) or by primary antibody colabeling (S4010). Pon-
ceau S scans were analyzed in One-D scan (Hidalgo et al., 2009). 
Phosphorylation of the S11878 (GL Biochem) and S12022 PKC 
(Genescript) sites in the PEVK element of titin was probed with 
primary phospho-specific antibodies that have been described 
previously (Hudson et al., 2011). Phosphorylation of the S4010 
sites was probed via phospho-specific antibodies (GL Biochem). 
Because this antibody has not been described before, we present 
the following details. The p-S4010 was raised in rabbit against 
CEE 
GK(pS)LSF 
PLA and had a high titer when used in ELI 
SA 
assays with the phospho-peptide and very low titer when used 
against the unphosphorylated version of the peptide (CEE 
GK(S)
LSF 
PLA). To test the specificity of the pS4010 when used on full-
length titin, skinned fibers from WT and N2B KO mice were used. 
The WT fibers were either left untreated, treated with PP1 to de-
phosphorylate titin, or treated with PKA to phosphorylate PKA 
sites on titin. Fibers were then solubilized, run on a 0.8% agarose 
gel, and transferred using the Biorad system as described pre-
viously (Hidalgo et al., 2009). Ideal phospho-specific (pS4010) 
antibodies would yield strong signal for the PKA treated fiber, 
moderate signal for the untreated assuming some basal phos-
phorylation level, no to low signal for the PP1 treated, and no sig-
nal in the N2B KO (used for control) since the S4010 site exists in 
the deleted portion of the protein. However, using the antibod-
ies to probe the phosphorylation status of these fibers yielded 
nonspecific binding—in all samples, including the N2B KO. To 
increase the specificity of the antibody, the SulfoLink Immobili-
zation Kit for Peptides (ThermoFisher) was used. Here, an affin-
ity column was created by immobilizing the nonphosphorylated 
version of the peptide that was used to raise the antibody. The 
antibody likely contains both phospho- and nonphospho-spe-
cific antibodies, and the phospho-specific fraction was removed 
in this step. The antibody was allowed to flow through the column 
with the nonphospho antibodies binding to the peptide allowing 
for collection of the phospho-specific fraction. In Western blots, 
nonspecific binding of the antibody was very low, as revealed by 
the minimal signal observed when using the antibody against 
the N2B KO lysate. Each blot was run with N2B KO samples in 
addition to experimental samples. Phosphorylation was reported 
relative to the N2B KO signal as this represents the remaining 
nonspecific background of the antibody. Western blots that are 
reported in this study were probed using the cleaned-up anti-
bodies, and proteins were colabeled with the Z1Z2 titin antibody 
(Gregorio et al., 1998) to quantify total titin and normalize for 
loading differences (Warren et al., 2003b). Samples were run in 
triplicate, and an average of three technical replicates was taken 
as a biological sample.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed (GraphPad Prism) using t test (Fig. 4), two-
way ANO 
VA (Figs. 1 and 5, Fig. S2, and Tables S1–S3), or nonlinear 
regression (Figs. 2, 3, and 5, and Fig. S2) as appropriate. In the lat-
ter, a statistical analysis was performed to test whether the data 
sets were best fit by one or two equations. A nonlinear regression 
was performed with an extra sum-of-squares F test to determine 
whether there was evidence that the data sets differed from each 
other. The simpler model (i.e., single equation) was preferred for 
P values <0.05.

Results
Effect of metformin on diastolic LV function of mice with 
HFpEF-like symptoms
To create an HFpEF-like state in the mouse, we induced a miner-
alocorticoid excess (DOCA pellet implantation) in the presence 
of chronic pressure overload (TAC surgery). The TAC/DOCA pro-
cedure results in concentric hypertrophy, exercise intolerance, 
fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction, which overlaps with symp-
toms of HFpEF patients (Mohammed et al., 2010; Methawasin 
et al., 2016). Diastolic dysfunction of TAC/DOCA mice is evi-
denced 6 wk after surgery by altered diastolic filling parameters 
measured by Doppler echocardiography. Specifically, increased 
ratios of E to A and E to e′ and a contaminant increase in fill-
ing pressure were observed, suggesting increased LV chamber

stiffness; pressure–volume analysis confirmed an increased di-
astolic stiffness of the LV based on an increase in the diastolic 
stiffness coefficient (β) of the end diastolic pressure volume re-
lation (Table S1 and Fig. 1, A–D). The increased filling pressure is 
supported by the increased left atria weight in TAC/DOCA mice 
(Fig. 1 F). Mice treated with metformin for 5 wk after the TAC/
DOCA procedure demonstrated that metformin did not affect the 
increased afterload experienced by TAC/DOCA hearts or the LV 
hypertrophy response, because end systolic LV pressures were 
comparable between TAC/DOCA groups (Table S1). Additionally, 
LV wall thickness and tissue weights were increased after TAC/
DOCA, but metformin treatment had no effect on these values 
(Table S1). However, mice treated with metformin demonstrated 
preserved diastolic function similar to sham control groups, and 
left atrial weight and end diastolic pressure were now normal 
(Fig. 1, A–F). Exercise intolerance is a key symptom of HFpEF, 
which is captured in the TAC/DOCA model. After TAC/DOCA, 
vehicle-treated mice demonstrated a reduction in VO2max during 
exercise tolerance testing, and metformin treatment preserved 
VO2max (Fig. 1 G).

stolic function, we studied muscle strips isolated from the midre-
gion of the LV free wall. Muscle strips were demembranated and 
bathed in relaxing solution, making it possible to study their pas-
sive material properties as the muscle strips were stretched from 
their slack sarcomere length (∼1.9 µm) to a sarcomere length of 
2.3 µm. Passive tension was measured before and after thick and 
thin filament extraction (Materials and methods section). This 
removes the anchors of titin in the sarcomeres, leaving only the 
ECM-based tension component (Granzier and Irving, 1995). The 
titin-based tension is determined from the difference between 
total passive tension (before extraction) and ECM-based passive 
tension (after extraction). Total passive tension was significantly 
lower in metformin-treated TAC/DOCA mice compared with un-
treated mice (Fig. 2 A). The ECM-based tension was found to be 
unaffected (Fig. 2 B). Subtracting ECM-based tension from the 
total tension revealed a statistically significant decrease in tit-
in-based passive tension in metformin-treated TAC/DOCA mice 
(Fig. 2 C). To gain insights in the dynamic stiffness of the myocar-
dium, we also performed a small-amplitude sinusoidal oscillation 
study at a range of frequencies (0.25–100 Hz) and measured both 
the viscous and elastic moduli. Both viscous (Fig. 3 A) and elastic 
moduli (Fig. 3 B) were significantly lower in metformin-treated 
TAC/DOCA mice compared with untreated TAC/DOCA mice. 
Thus, metformin lowers the stiffness of heart muscle under static 
and dynamic conditions, and the effect is derived from titin.
Effect of metformin on titin expression and phosphorylation
To determine the molecular basis of the metformin-induced 
reduction in titin-based passive stiffness, titin expression and 
phosphorylation status were investigated. Using agarose gel 
electrophoresis (Warren et al., 2003b) we determined total titin 
(expressed relative to myosin heavy chain), N2B titin, N2BA titin, 
and the titin degradation product T2 (Fig. 4 A). Passive stiffness 
may be reduced because of the reduction in the total expression 
level of titin, a shift in the titin isoform expression ratio from 
the stiff N2B isoform to the more compliant N2BA isoform, or 
degradation of titin (T2 level). However, there were no changes 
in total titin, N2BA/N2B, or T2/total titin (Fig. 4, A and C). We also 
used a dual luciferase splice reporter assay that builds on the titin 
splice factor RBM20 and studied the effect of metformin on titin 
splicing and cell viability in HEK293 cells (for details, see Liss et 
Figure 2. Metformin reduces titin-based passive tension of LV muscle 
strips isolated from TAC/DOCA WT mice. The TAC/DOCA mice without 
(n = 9) and with (n = 8) metformin treatment were studied. (A) Total pas-
sive tension was decreased in metformin-treated animals (P < 0.001). (B) 
ECM-based tension was unaffected by metformin (symbols overlap). (C) Tit-
in-based tension was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced by metformin. Error

moduli (Emod) are obtained from a sinusoidal frequency sweep as the ratio of the stress over the strain times the sine (VM) or cosine (Emod) of the phase shift 
(Materials and methods section). Absolute VM and EMod are measured in mN/mm2; here values obtained at a sarcomere length of 2.3 µm on unextracted 
fibers are plotted normalized to the value of the untreated sample at the lowest frequency (this value is set to 1). (A) Viscous moduli were decreased in met-

al., 2018). In line with the protein expression data, there was no 
effect of metformin on titin splicing (Fig. S1). Metformin was well 
tolerated but did not affect the splice reporter readout.
In addition to changes in expression of titin, the stiffness of 
titin can also be altered through a change in the phosphorylation 
level of titin’s PEVK and N2B spring elements. Phosphorylation 
of the S11878 and S12022 sites in the PEVK element of titin that 
are targets of PKCα (Hidalgo et al., 2009) and phosphorylation 
of the S4010 site in the N2B element of titin that is a PKA target 
(Yamasaki et al., 2002) were studied via Western blot analysis 
with phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 4 B). No metformin ef-
fects were found in the phosphorylation level of the two PEVK 
sites in metformin-treated mice, but phosphorylation of S4010 
was significantly increased (Fig. 4 D). Because elevated phos-
phorylation of PKA sites in titin has been shown to lower pas-
sive stiffness, the increased phosphorylation of S4010 is likely 
to contribute to the reduction in diastolic stiffness in met-
formin-treated TAC/DOCA mice.
Effect of metformin on diastolic function of N2B KO mice
To further study the importance of titin’s N2B element in the 
beneficial effect of metformin on diastolic function of TAC/
DOCA mice, we investigated a mouse model in which the N2B 
element of titin has been deleted (the N2B KO). The N2B KO mice 
have increased diastolic stiffness due to the higher strain on the 
remaining titin spring elements (Radke et al., 2007). We tested 
whether metformin was able to improve diastolic function and 
titin-based passive stiffness in N2B KO mice. Echocardiography 
showed no effect of metformin on diastolic function in either WT 
or N2B KO mice under baseline conditions, while N2B KO mice 
demonstrated diastolic dysfunction compared with WT mice 
under baseline conditions (Table S2 and Fig. S2, A–C). Passive 
tension measurements of LV wall muscle were also performed 
in the N2B KO. As above, muscle strips dissected from the LV 
free wall were studied to determine the contribution of the ECM 
and titin to myocardial stiffness. Although total and titin-based 
passive stiffness were higher in untreated N2B KO mice than the 
WT mice, total passive stiffness (Fig. S2 D), ECM passive stiffness 
(Fig. S2 E), and titin passive stiffness (Fig. S2) were not signifi-
cantly different in metformin-treated N2B KO mice.
The lack of a response to metformin in the N2B KO mice 
under baseline conditions could be explained by the absence of 
certain reversible changes specific to the TAC/DOCA pathology. 
Therefore, a group of N2B KO mice underwent TAC/DOCA sur-
gery and were then treated with metformin in order to deter-
mine whether the N2B element plays a critical role in mediating 
the metformin response. The TAC/DOCA numerically worsened 
the diastolic function assessed by both pressure–volume analy-
sis and echocardiography in N2B KO mice; however, metformin 
treatment caused no differences in diastolic parameters in TAC/
DOCA N2B KO mice (Table S3 and Fig. 5, A–D). Additionally, total, 
ECM-based and titin-based passive stiffness were also unaffected 
(Fig. 5, E–G). Thus, the N2B element appears to be essential for 
the effect of metformin on diastolic function.
Discussion
This study revealed that metformin, a commonly used oral drug 
for the treatment of type II diabetes, ameliorates diastolic LV 
chamber stiffness in mice with HFpEF-like symptoms by induc-
ing a reduction in titin-based stiffness. This finding supports 
the importance of titin for LV diastolic stiffness and adds to pre-
vious work in which titin was made either stiffer (Radke et al., 
2007; Chung et al., 2013; Granzier et al., 2014) or more compliant

Metformin ameliorates diastolic dysfunction

(Methawasin et al., 2014; Hinze et al., 2016) and that revealed 
that LV diastolic stiffness was altered accordingly. Although 
many other factors contribute to diastolic stiffness (speed of 
calcium removal from the cytoplasm, cross-bridge detachment 
kinetics, ECM stiffness, etc. [Kass et al., 2004]), titin appears to 
be a dominant factor. This improvement in diastolic function is 
associated with improved exercise capacity and VO2 max, sug-
gesting metformin preserves cardiac reserve and performance 
during exercise. Metformin had no effect when administered to 
mice that lack the N2B element of titin, indicating that the N2B 
element is the downstream target within titin. The N2B element 
is a molecular spring within titin’s I-band region that extends as 
the sarcomere is stretched and contributes to the unique passive 
force–sarcomere length relation of cardiac myocytes (Helmes et 
al., 1999). The N2B element is cardiac-specific and is found in 
both adult cardiac titin isoforms, the short and therefore stiff N2B 
isoform and the longer and more compliant N2BA isoform (Bang 
et al., 2001). The N2B element is a hot spot for posttranslational 
modifications, with ERK1/2, CaMKIIδ, PKA, and PKG all target-
ing this element (Hidalgo and Granzier, 2013). Single-molecule 
and single-cell studies have shown that the functional result of 
phosphorylating the N2B element is an increase in compliance of 
the N2B element and a reduction in passive force (Yamasaki et al., 
2002; Perkin et al., 2015). Thus, the increased phosphorylation 
level of S4010, a PKA site in the N2B element that was found in 
metformin-treated HFpEF mice, suggests that this effect contrib-
utes to the reduction in diastolic stiffness. Our finding that a PKA 
site within titin has elevated phosphorylation after metformin 
treatment is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that 
PKA activity is significantly elevated in metformin-treated car-
diac myocytes, an effect mediated by AMP activated protein ki-
nase (Kobashigawa et al., 2014).
In addition to lowering stiffness by PKA phosphorylation, tit-
in’s stiffness is also modulated by other pathways. Recent work by 
Hopf et al. (2018) identified signaling pathways involved in regu-
lating titin phosphorylation in response to insulin and metformin, 
which include PKG, ERK, and PKC pathways. In agreement with 
our findings, they were also able to demonstrate an increase in 
phosphorylation of the S4010 site after metformin treatment. 
Presently, it cannot be ruled out that additional modifications 
link metformin to a reduction in titin-based stiffness. Although 
it is unlikely that phosphorylation of a single residue within the 
N2B element of titin can fully explain the beneficial effects of 
metformin in this HFpEF-like model, the findings presented here 
suggest the N2B element is a critical region. Although no differ-
ences in overall titin protein expression were observed, changes 
in additional phosphorylation sites or oxidative changes within 
the N2B element may occur. One such possible modification is 
the oxidation of cysteines within the N2B element causing disul-
fide bonds, leading to an increase in titin stiffness (Nedrud et al., 
2011). If fewer disulfide bonds were to exist in metformin-treated 
mice, this would add to the PKA-induced passive force reduction. 
Whether such changes exist within the N2B element of titin that 
respond to metformin treatment requires future research.

Clinical implication
Several recent studies on biopsies from patients with HFpEF have 
revealed hypo-phosphorylation of a PKA site located in the N2B 
element of human titin (Borbély et al., 2009a,b; Zile et al., 2015) 
and activation of PKA upon administering metformin would be 
expected to increase phosphorylation of PKA sites on titin in 
patients as well. Thus, the present findings might be clinically 
relevant. The effect of PKA phosphorylation on passive force has 
been shown to be titin isoform dependent (Fukuda et al., 2005) 
with the largest effect detected in myocytes that express high 
levels of N2B titin and the smallest effect in myocytes that ex-
press high N2BA titin levels (changes in the compliance of the 
N2B element are attenuated by the longer tandem Ig and PEVK 
elements in N2BA titin; for details, see Fukuda et al., 2005). The 
expression ratio of the adult titin isoforms in the LV varies in 
different species (Cazorla et al., 2000), but the differences be-
tween HFpEF-like mice and HFpEF patients are relatively mod-
est: ∼70% of total titin is N2B titin in the mouse (this study) and 
∼65% in patients (Zile et al., 2015). Based on data in Fukuda et al. 
(2005), it can be estimated that the metformin-induced reduc-
tion in stiffness in the human ventricle would be ∼10% less than 
in the mouse and thus should be clearly detectable. In line with 
this expectation, phosphorylating skinned cardiomyocytes iso-
lated from HFpEF patients by exogenously adding PKA has been 
shown to significantly decrease passive stiffness (Borbély et al., 
2009a). We conclude that metformin might be effective in lower-
ing titin-based passive stiffness in HFpEF patients and improving 
diastolic function.
Although the effect of metformin on diastolic function per 
se has not been investigated in HFpEF patients, a number of 
clinical studies have investigated the correlation between met-
formin and heart failure and reported positive correlations on 
mortality (Miles et al., 2014). Incident heart failure is reduced in 
people with type II diabetes on metformin (Nichols et al., 2005; 
Pantalone et al., 2009), and an analysis evaluating ∼20,000 peo-
ple with diabetes in the REA 
CH (REduction of Atherothrombosis 
for Continued Health) registry reported a 31% lower heart fail-
ure mortality rate in those patients on metformin compared with 
those not on metformin (Roussel et al., 2010). Although the work 
presented here demonstrates a benefit of metformin in improv-
ing passive stiffness in HFpEF-like mouse model, HFpEF patients 
often present with both increased passive stiffness and impaired 
active relaxation. The TAC/DOCA model shows only a small in-
crease in the time constant for isovolumetric relaxation, Tau, 
which was unaffected by metformin treatment. Active relaxation 
and the effect of metformin treatment was not further evaluated 
due to minimal impairment of relaxation in this model; however, 
a retrospective cohort study of diabetes patients found a positive 
relationship between the use of metformin and improved LV re-
laxation (Andersson et al., 2010). These correlations support the 
hypothesis that metformin has a positive effect on diastolic func-
tion and might be effective in HFpEF patients. Clearly, studies 
are now required that focus specifically on the diastolic effect of 
metformin in HFpEF patients.
Pharmacological approaches for treating HFpEF are of partic-
ular interest because HFpEF therapies are lacking despite several 
large randomized clinical trials. A recent clinical trial (REL 
AX) 
 
sought to increase titin’s compliance through enhancing PKG 
activity using a phosphodiestesrase-5 inhibitor (sildenafil); 
however, exercise capacity and clinical outcomes were similar 
to placebo (Redfield et al., 2012, 2013) possibly due to the fact 
that sildenafil levels were associated with minimal increases in 
plasma cGMP (Redfield et al., 2013). The neutral outcome of the 
REL 
AX trial does not diminish the importance of a titin-based ap-
proach; titin remains an interesting target for diastolic stiffness–
based therapies because it is a major determinant of diastolic 
function and has multiple well-established biological pathways 
for altering its stiffness, including the PKA pathways targeted by 
metformin. Recent work by Methawasin et al. (2016), Bull et al. 
(2016), and suggest that an alternative for improving diastolic 
function is inactivating the titin splicing RBM20. Genetically 
inactivating RBM20 causes the expression of supercompliant 
N2BA-type titin isoforms and improves diastolic function in mice 
with pathological diastolic stiffening (Methawasin et al., 2016). 
However, genetic targeting is relatively straightforward in the 
mouse but is very difficult to achieve in humans, and currently, 
no pharmaceuticals exist that can target RBM20. A clear advan-
tage of lowering stiffness with metformin is that metformin is 
an existing drug with a known safety profile. In addition, in nor-
moglycemic persons, metformin does not induce hypoglycemia 
(Kalra et al., 2013). Taking advantage of titin phosphorylation to 
modulate stiffness is of particular interest given that phosphor-
ylation is known to be dysregulated in HFpEF patients (Borbély 
et al., 2009a; Zile et al., 2015). Considering the diastolic benefits 
demonstrated in the mouse model and the correlations between 
metformin treatment and LV function in human populations, we 
conclude that metformin is a potential therapy for patients with 
HFpEF. The use of an approved, well-tolerated drug such as met-
formin to target titin stiffness presents a unique opportunity for 
immediate translation.
In summary, metformin lowers LV diastolic stiffness in mice 
exhibiting an HFpEF-like phenotype, and the effect can be ex-
plained by a reduction in titin-based passive stiffness. The N2B 
element within cardiac titin is a downstream metformin tar-
get, and the mechanism includes phosphorylation of PKA sites 
within the N2B element. This makes metformin and titin-based 
modifications an exciting therapeutic avenue in treating diastolic 
dysfunction and HFpEF.
