Study objective: We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of apneic oxygenation
during emergency intubation.
Methods: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid CENTRAL, and Scopus databases for randomized controlled
trials and observational studies from 2006 until July 2016, without language restrictions. Gray literature, clinicaltrials.
gov, and reference lists of articles were hand searched. We conducted a meta-analysis with random-effects models
to evaluate first-pass success rates, incidence of hypoxemia, and lowest peri-intubation SpO2 between apneic
oxygenation and standard oxygenation cases.
Results: A total of 1,386 studies were screened and 77 selected for full-text review. A total of 14 studies were included
for qualitative analysis, and 8 studies (1,837 patients) underwent quantitative analysis. In the meta-analysis of 8
studies (1,837 patients), apneic oxygenation was associated with decreased hypoxemia (odds ratio [OR] 0.66; 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.52 to 0.84), but was not associated with decreased severe hypoxemia (6 studies; 1,043
patients; OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.57) or life-threatening hypoxemia (5 studies; 1,003 patients; OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.52
to 1.55). Apneic oxygenation was associated with increased first-pass success rate (6 studies; 1,658 patients; OR 1.59;
95% CI 1.04 to 2.44) and increased lowest peri-intubation SpO2 (6 studies; 1,043 patients; weighted mean difference
2.2%; 95% CI 0.8% to 3.6%).
Conclusion: In this meta-analysis, apneic oxygenation was associated with increased peri-intubation oxygen
saturation, decreased rates of hypoxemia, and increased first-pass intubation success. [Ann Emerg Med.

INTRODUCTION
Background
Apneic oxygenation consists in the administration of
oxygen during the apneic period of the intubation
procedure to extend the safe apnea time beyond that which
can be achieved by preoxygenation alone.1-5 This concept
was first introduced in the operating room setting,6 and
more recently its use has been rapidly adopted during
airway management in the emergency department (ED)
and ICU.7-10 The rationale for apneic oxygenation revolves
around the physiologic capacity of continuous oxygen
capture by alveoli through a passive process without
providing ventilation.6,11 During laryngoscopy, apneic
oxygenation may be provided as continuous oxygen
delivery throughout the intubation with nasal cannulas,
nasopharyngeal catheters, and modified laryngoscopes.
Importance
Airway management is commonly performed by
anesthesiologists, emergency physicians, and critical care
providers as part of their daily practice. Most intubations
are performed in the operating room under controlled,
often ideal situations. However, out-of-operating-room
intubations have been associated with higher risks of
adverse events because they are frequently performed
urgently in critically ill patients,12 for whom the rates
of severe complications can be as high as 28%.13
Hypoxemia is an adverse effect that can occur during
intubation.14 If oxygen were administered through the
pharynx during the apneic period, one could increase the
uptake of oxygen into the bloodstream, thus reducing
occurrences of potentially harmful oxygen desaturation
events.

AIRWAY/SYSTEMATIC REVIEW/META-ANALYSIS
 Editor’s Capsule Summary
What is already known on this topic
Apneic oxygenation may prolong safe apnea time and
increase first-pass success during emergency intubation.
What question this study addressed
Is apneic oxygenation, typically delivered by high-flow
nasal cannula, associated with lower peri-intubation
hypoxemia and higher first-pass intubation success?
What this study adds to our knowledge
In this meta-analysis of 8 emergency department and
ICU studies comprising 1,837 patients, apneic
oxygenation was associated with lower odds of
peri-intubation hypoxemia (SpO2 <93%; odds ratio
0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.85) and
higher odds of first-pass intubation success (odds
ratio 1.59; 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.44).
How this is relevant to clinical practice
These results support the role of apneic oxygenation
in emergency intubation.
Goals of This investigation
The use of apneic oxygenation has been recommended
by experts for management of high-risk airway situations,
including emergency intubations in the ED,10 and for
patients at risk for difficult laryngoscopy and intubation in
the operating room15; however, the evidence supporting
apneic oxygenation is still not well established. The
objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to
evaluate the effectiveness of apneic oxygenation on
hypoxemia, first-pass success, and lowest oxygen saturation
during emergency intubation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This was a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted
to evaluate the effectiveness of apneic oxygenation during
intubations performed in the ED and ICU settings. A
protocol was developed a priori and it is available for access
in the PROSPERO Web site. This report adheres to
recommendations made in the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.16
Eligibility Criteria
Weincludedoriginalresearcharticles,includingrandomized
controlled trials and observational studies, in which apneic
oxygenation was used as part of the intubation procedure. We
did not exclude any studies according to language, and only
studies published in the past 10 years were included. This time
restriction was based on the recent implementation of apneic
oxygenation in clinical practice and advances in capnography
and intubation monitoring in the included settings.
Studies of pediatric and adult patients who received apneic
oxygenationduringtheapneicperiodofintubationintheEDor
ICU were included. Studies performed in the out-of-hospital
setting and in the operating room were excluded. There was
no restriction by age, sex, or any other baseline characteristic.
To meet the eligibility criteria, patients had to have
received oxygen during the apneic period. All types of oxygen
devices were considered, including standard nasal cannula,
high-flow nasal cannula, nasopharyngeal catheters, modified
laryngoscopes, or any other device. Apneic oxygenation is
most commonly performed with high-flow nasal cannula
through the transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation
ventilatory exchange (THRIVE) technique and with standard
nasal cannula through the technique of nasal oxygen during
efforts securing a tube (NO DESAT). The THRIVE
technique consists of the use of a high-flow warmed
humidified oxygen delivery system up to 70 L/min to perform
both preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation. This technique
combines the benefits of apneic oxygenation with continuous
positive airway pressure and gaseous exchange through
flow-dependent dead-space flushing.17,18 The technique of
NO DESAT uses a standard nasal cannula with cold dry
oxygen set as high as 15 L/min, together with the traditional
techniques of preoxygenation, and allows apneic oxygenation
to continue while attempts at intubation are performed.10,19
Outcome Measures and Study Selection
The following outcomes were included: lowest SpO2 peri-
intubation; first-pass success (success on the first
laryngoscopy attempt); incidences of hypoxemia (SpO2
<93%), severe hypoxemia (SpO2 <80%), and life-
threatening hypoxemia (SpO2 <70%) during the procedure;
duration of mechanical ventilation; ICU length of stay; and
mortality in the ICU. In studies in which an episode of
hypoxemia was defined by SpO2 less than 90%, these events
were included as episodes of SpO2 less than 93%.
A medical librarian (P.J.E.) designed and conducted a
comprehensive search of 4 electronic databases, including
Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid CENTRAL, and
Scopus from 2006 to July 2016. The initial search was
designed in Ovid MEDLINE (Appendix E1, available
online at http://www.annemergmed.com) and then
translated into terms appropriate to Ovid CENTRAL and
Ovid EMBASE. The strategies used a combination of
controlled vocabulary (in MEDLINE, this is Medical
484 Annals of Emergency Medicine
Volume 70, no. 4 : October 2017

 Subject Headings), eg, “intubation,” “intratracheal,” text
words. This was done for each concept: intubation, setting
(eg, ED), purpose (apneic oxygenation), and outcomes (eg,
hypoxemia). Gray literature databases suggested by the
Cochrane handbook,20 ongoing trials (through
clinicaltrials.gov), and reference lists of eligible articles were
hand searched.
In phase 1, 2 investigators (L.O.J.S. and D.C.), working
independently, screened all titles and abstracts for
eligibility. Records considered potentially relevant were
assessed in full text for eligibility by 2 independent
reviewers (L.O.J.S. and D.C.) in phase 2. We used Cohen’s
unweighted k to measure chance corrected agreement
between reviewers for phase 2. Disagreements were
discussed with the senior author (M.F.B.) and resolved by
consensus. All studies were included for qualitative analysis
and only those with available data were included for the
quantitative analysis.
Primary Data Analysis
Pertinent data were extracted with a standardized
predefined form. Data from the first 10 studies were
extracted at the beginning of the process independently in
duplicate by 2 reviewers (L.O.J.S. and P.B.) to identify
variables prone to misinterpretation. Extracted data
included study design, study size, study setting, study
population, details of the intubation procedure, and
outcomes of interest. In regard to the intubation procedure,
data collected included clinical predictors of difficult
intubation (ie, Cormack-Lehane grades III and IV),
methods of preoxygenation, use of rapid sequence
intubation, context for intubation, proceduralist expertise
(trainee versus expert), and type of laryngoscope used.
Trainee proceduralist was defined as physicians undergoing
a training program (residents and fellows). Expert
proceduralist was defined as emergency physicians,
intensivists, and anesthesiologists.
For randomized controlled trials, we assessed the risk of
bias with the Cochrane Collaboration Bias Appraisal
Tool.20 We assessed the risk of bias for observational
studies with a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool.21
Quality assessment of all studies included was performed in
duplicate and independently by 2 reviewers (L.O.J.S. and
P.B.). The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was
evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods.22
We collected the outcomes included in the published
reports, and authors were contacted by e-mail if data were
missing or unclear. Most studies contained the desired
clinical outcomes. We directly contacted the authors of the
14 studies and received additional data from 12. One
conference abstract of an ongoing trial had no data for
outcomes of interest.23
We considered it reasonable to pool the data from ED
and ICU studies to have a better understanding of the overall
benefit of apneic oxygenation in an emergency setting. Data
were managed following Cochrane recommendations.20 We
used Review Manager (version 5.3; The Nordic Cochrane
Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen,
Denmark) for meta-analyses, using a random-effects model
as described by DerSimonian-Laird.24 The pooled-effect
estimates of using apneic oxygenation during intubation
versus not using it were reported as odds ratio (OR) and
weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed among studies
by the I2 statistic proposed by Higgins and Thompson.25
Between-studies heterogeneity was also evaluated visually.
To account for the clinical and statistical heterogeneity
between studies, we used a random-effects model.
During the development of the protocol, we planned to
perform subgroup analyses by proceduralist expertise, study
design, and risk of bias. Sensitivity analyses were conducted
excluding studies with high risk of bias.
RESULTS
The search strategy identified 1,386 studies for review
(Figure 1). After screening the titles and abstracts and
removing duplicates, we identified 77 potentially relevant
studies. After full-text review, a total of 14 studies met the
inclusion criteria: 6 ICU studies,26-31 6 ED studies,23,32-36
and 2 mixed ED and ICU studies.37,38 Interobserver
agreement (k) for phase 2 of study selection was moderate
(k 0.54; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.74), with an overall agreement
of 79.2% (95% CI 70.2% to 88.3%).
Among the studies including patients intubated in the
ED or ICU, there were 9 observational studies and 5
randomized controlled trials (Table 1 and Appendix E2,
available online at http://www.annemergmed.com).
The included studies involved 2,023 participants,
with 1,168 patients receiving apneic oxygenation
during intubation and 855 not receiving it. Eight
studies,26,27,29-32,35,38 including 982 patients receiving
apneic oxygenation and 855 not receiving it, underwent
meta-analysis. Three studies had no control groups,33,34,37 1
study had both arms receiving apneic oxygenation,28 and 1
conference abstract did not have enough data details.23 There
were 2 studies with overlapping cohorts, and we included
only the most comprehensive one in the meta-analyses.35,36
Two ED studies included pediatric patients within a mixed
pediatric and adult cohort,32,38 with a median age greater

 than 50 years. Most studies included patients with acute
respiratory failure requiring emergency intubation.
Apneic oxygenation was performed through high-flow
nasal cannula in most studies,26,28,30,31,34,37 with the
oxygen flow set as high as 60 L/min. Standard nasal
cannula with oxygen set as high as 15 L/min, used in
combination with traditional techniques of preoxygenation,
was mostly used in the ED studies.32,35,36,38
Main Results
We evaluated the body of evidence for the main outcomes
with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation approach, which assessed the
confidence in our meta-analytic effects accounting for
different criteria rather than the risk of bias alone (Table 2 and
Appendix E3, available online at http://www.annemergmed.
com). Sources of clinical heterogeneity included setting
and context for intubation, approaches to preoxygenation
and apneic oxygenation, and proceduralist expertise.
The timeframe for measurement of the lowest peri-
intubation SpO2 and incidences of hypoxemia were unclear
in most studies; among those that reported it in detail, it
was measured from drug injection until the initiation of
mechanical ventilation.
In the meta-analysis of 6 studies including 1,043
patients,26,27,29-31,35 the lowest peri-intubation SpO2 was
higher for apneic oxygenation than standard oxygenation
(difference 2.21%; 95% CI 0.81% to 3.61%; I2¼0%)
(Figure 2A).
In the meta-analysis of 6 studies including 1,658
patients,25,26,28,30,31,34 apneic oxygenation during
intubation was associated with increased first-pass success
rates (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.44; I2¼48%) (Figure 2B).
Hypoxemia was defined differently across studies. For
the meta-analysis, we defined hypoxemia as SpO2 less than
93%. In studies in which an episode of hypoxemia was
defined by SpO2 less than 90%, these events were included
as episodes of SpO2 less than 93%. In the meta-analysis
of 8 studies including 1,837 patients,26,27,29-32,35,38 apneic
oxygenation during intubation was associated with
decreased incidence of hypoxemia (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52
to 0.84; I2¼0%) (Figure 2C).

patients,26,27,29-31,35 apneic oxygenation during intubation
was not associated with severe hypoxemia (SpO2 <80%)
(OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.57; I2¼44%) (Figure 2D).
In the meta-analysis of 5 studies including 1,003
patients,26,27,29,31,35 apneic oxygenation during intubation
was not associated with life-threatening hypoxemia (SpO2
<70%) (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.55; I2¼2%)
(Figure 2E).
In the meta-analysis of 4 studies including 368
patients,26,27,29,31 apneic oxygenation during intubation
was not associated with decreased duration of mechanical
ventilation (weighted mean difference 1.42 days; 95% CI
0.59 to 3.42; I2¼63%) (Figure 3A). In the meta-analysis
of 4 studies including 368 patients,26,27,29,31 apneic
oxygenation during intubation was associated with a
decreased ICU length of stay of 2.88 days (95% CI 1.40 to
4.37 days; I2¼0%) (Figure 3B). In the meta-analysis of 4
studies including 258 patients,26,27,30,31 apneic oxygenation
was not associated with ICU mortality (OR 0.82; 95% CI
0.38 to 1.76; I2¼32%). Deaths included 36 of 118 patients
(30.5%) in the apneic oxygenation group and 49 of 140
(35.0%) in the control group, with an absolute difference
of –4% (95% CI –18% to 14%) (Figure 3C).
Additional Analyses
Forest plots of subgroup analyses by proceduralist
expertise, study design, and risk of bias are shown in
Appendix E4, available online at http://www.
annemergmed.com. Apneic oxygenation favored the
trainees’ subgroup when proceduralist expertise was
evaluated; however, differences between subgroups were
not statistically significant. Sensitivity analysis excluding
the study with high risk of bias32 did not significantly
change the pooled effect estimates. When randomized
controlled trials and studies with low risk of bias were
analyzed separately, apneic oxygenation was not associated
with better periprocedural outcomes.
We were unable to statistically assess the presence of
publication bias because the number of studies included in
each analysis was small, which makes analysis of funnel
plots unreliable.39
LIMITATIONS
There are several limitations in this systematic review
and meta-analysis. The major limitation relates to the
quality of included studies, which warrants a moderate to
low level of certainty in the estimates. Another important
limitation is the different approaches used to apneic

 oxygenation in terms of preoxygenation and other peri-
intubation variables and cointerventions. The different
methods of preoxygenation between groups could affect the
likelihood of developing hypoxemia during the apneic
period; therefore, the effect of apneic oxygenation was not
isolated in some of the included studies. The maintenance
of airway patency during apneic oxygenation was not
described in most of the studies, and that might affect the
quality of this intervention. The clinical heterogeneity of
patients intubated in the ED and ICU in regard to their
cardiorespiratory baseline status is also an important factor
to be considered, and which approach is better among the
spectrum of sickness in patients requiring emergency
intubation still has to be studied.
To decrease selection bias, we included all eligible
studies including those published in gray literature and not
indexed in PubMed or major databases, and abstracts. We
included all studies even if they had a low number of
participants or high risk of bias. This likely introduced
heterogeneity into the analyses. However, we assessed
clinical and statistical heterogeneity and accounted for this
in the statistical analyses. To mitigate some of these
limitations, we used subgroup analyses. Also we contacted
the authors when published data were not clear or missing,
and we received several responses.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated
that the use of apneic oxygenation during intubation
appears to be associated with increased peri-intubation
oxygen saturation and first-pass success rates, as well as
decreased incidence of hypoxemia in patients intubated in
the ED or ICU. The use of apneic oxygenation was
associated with a decrease in ICU length of stay, but there
was no difference in duration of mechanical ventilation and
ICU mortality. We found no reports of adverse events
related to the use of apneic oxygenation, despite different
approaches and settings.
The concept and use of apneic oxygenation for the
optimization of peri-intubation conditions, especially apnea
time, has been introduced in the practice of emergency
medicine after ED observational studies,32,35,38
anesthesiology literature,1,3,4 and recommendations by
experts in the field.10,19 EDs and ICUs have used different
techniques for apneic oxygenation, with most ICU studies
using high-flow nasal cannula and most ED studies using the
standard nasal cannula.32,35,36,38 The THRIVE technique
combines preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation using a
high-flow nasal cannula up to 70 L/min, creating a flow-
dependent positive pharyngeal pressure, with potentially
more benefit for patients with more severe respiratory
disease.8,40
The relative simplicity and safety of this intervention
and the potential to turn intubation in a safer procedure,
with higher success rates and fewer complications, led to a
rapid and widespread use of the concept and to its even
being considered by some as standard of care despite
relatively scarce evidence to support its use.10 Recently,
ICU-based studies have shown conflicting results on the
effectiveness of apneic oxygenation using different
approaches.26-31
Patients intubated outside of the operating room
represented emergency intubations in the setting of
critical illness in an ED or ICU environment, in whom
the lowest SpO2 and incidences of hypoxemia during the
peri-intubation period are different from those in the
elective operating room population. Although there was
variable level of bias and heterogeneity in the included
studies, apneic oxygenation was associated with increased
SpO2 peri-intubation, increased first-pass success rates,
and decreased incidence of hypoxemia in patients
intubated in the ED or ICU. Severe and life-threatening
hypoxemia was not affected. These findings likely
represent an overall benefit of using apneic oxygenation
during emergency intubations, reflecting better
periprocedural outcomes and prolonged safe apnea time.
The physiologic improvements noted likely have little
effect on the underlying disease, which may explain the
lack of improvement in mortality.
In the subgroup analysis, proceduralist experience
showed that peri-intubation oxygen saturation, first-pass
success, and hypoxemia were improved in the trainees’
subgroup; however, these outcomes were not significantly
improved in the experts’ subgroup. The potential decrease
in hypoxemia in urgently intubated patients with the use of
apneic oxygenation might have allowed less experienced
operators more time for laryngoscopy, and thus led them to
achieve higher first-pass success rates. Apneic oxygenation
may be of less benefit to operators who are very skilled at
laryngoscopy and can complete intubation quickly.35
Higher first-pass success rates could also explain the
decreased incidence of hypoxemia, given the direct
relationship between number of attempts and the incidence
of desaturations,9,35,41 and secondary increase in patients’
safety.35 Subgroup analysis by risk of bias showed that
when only studies with low risk of bias were included, none
of the outcomes analyzed showed an improvement with the
use of apneic oxygenation, likely because the sample sizes
were significantly reduced; however, this also raises a
concern about the quality of the evidence of the available
studies in regard to the use of apneic oxygenation.

 In summary, in this meta-analysis apneic oxygenation
was associated with increased peri-intubation SpO2,
decreased hypoxemia, and increased first-pass intubation
success. Apneic oxygenation is a potentially important
adjunct for emergency airway management.
