Abstract
Background: Recent population dietary studies indicate that diets rich in ultra-processed foods, increasingly
frequent worldwide, are grossly nutritionally unbalanced, suggesting that the dietary contribution of these foods
largely determines the overall nutritional quality of contemporaneous diets. Yet, these studies have focused on
individual nutrients (one at a time) rather than the overall nutritional quality of the diets. Here we investigate the
relationship between the energy contribution of ultra-processed foods in the US diet and its content of critical
nutrients, individually and overall.
Methods: We evaluated dietary intakes of 9,317 participants from 2009 to 2010 NHANES aged 1+ years. Food items
were classified into unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods,
and ultra-processed foods. First, we examined the average dietary content of macronutrients, micronutrients, and
fiber across quintiles of the energy contribution of ultra-processed foods. Then, we used Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to identify a nutrient-balanced dietary pattern to enable the assessment of the overall nutritional
quality of the diet. Linear regression was used to explore the association between the dietary share of ultra-
processed foods and the balanced-pattern PCA factor score. The scores were thereafter categorized into tertiles,
and their distribution was examined across ultra-processed food quintiles. All models incorporated survey sample
weights and were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and educational attainment.
Results: The average content of protein, fiber, vitamins A, C, D, and E, zinc, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium,
and calcium in the US diet decreased significantly across quintiles of the energy contribution of ultra-processed
foods, while carbohydrate, added sugar, and saturated fat contents increased. An inverse dose–response association
was found between ultra-processed food quintiles and overall dietary quality measured through a nutrient-
balanced-pattern PCA-derived factor score characterized by being richer in fiber, potassium, magnesium and vitamin
C, and having less saturated fat and added sugars.
Conclusions: This study suggests that decreasing the dietary share of ultra-processed foods is a rational and
effective way to improve the nutritional quality of US diets.

 Background
Ultra-processed foods are formulations manufactured
using several ingredients and a series of processes (hence
“ultra-processed”). Most of their ingredients are lower-
cost industrial sources of dietary energy and nutrients,
and additives used for the purpose of imitating sensorial
qualities of minimally processed foods or of culinary
preparations of these foods, or to disguise undesirable
sensory qualities of the final product. They are made to
be hyper-palatable and attractive by the use of many
additives, with long shelf life, and are able to be con-
sumed anywhere, anytime. Ultra-processed foods include
but are not limited to soft drinks, sweet or savory
snacks, reconstituted meat products, and pre-prepared
frozen dishes [1–6].
In studies carried out in nationally representative sam-
ples of the Brazilian population it has been shown that
the group of ultra-processed foods have higher content
of free sugars, total fats, saturated fats, and trans fats,
and lower content of protein, fiber, and most micronutri-
ents than the rest of the diet, and that high consumption
of ultra-processed foods renders grossly nutritionally un-
balanced diets [7–9]. In Canada, similar results have been
documented regarding free sugars, total fats, protein, and
fiber [10]. In the US, using 2009–2010 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) day 1 data,
a positive association was found between the dietary
contribution of ultra-processed foods and the dietary con-
tent of added sugars [11]. Another US study found that
highly processed barcoded consumer packaged foods and
beverages, mostly ultra-processed products, are higher in
saturated fat, sugar, and sodium contents compared to
less-processed foods [12].
Based on the detrimental effects of ultra-processed
foods on the dietary content of critical nutrients and
taking into account their increasing predominance in
global food supplies [3, 6, 13–16], the dietary share of
ultra-processed foods, expressed as a percentage of
total energy intake, has been proposed [1, 4, 17] and further
recognized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization [5], the Pan-American Health Organization
[6], and INFORMAS (International Network for Food and
Obesity/non-communicable diseases Research, Moni-
toring and Action Support) [18] as a potentially mean-
ingful determinant of the overall nutritional quality of
contemporaneous diets.
In order to further evaluate the influence of the dietary
share of ultra-processed foods on the nutritional dietary
quality we need to study its relationship with the overall
nutrient profile of diets. As several authors have pointed
out [19–22], studying nutrients one at a time has a
number of drawbacks, which may be overcome by focus-
ing on dietary patterns [19, 23–30]. Yet, to date, popula-
tion studies assessing the impact of ultra-processed food
consumption on the nutritional quality of diets have
focused on the dietary content of individual nutrients.
Dietary patterns can be derived using two approaches:
a priori or a posteriori [31]. A priori techniques use
scoring systems or overall measures of dietary quality
based on nutritional variables, generally foods and/or
nutrients, in order to assess the degree to which a par-
ticipant complies with a predefined theoretical dietary
pattern, created based on current nutrition knowledge.
Empirically derived dietary patterns, on the other hand,
are patterns derived a posteriori based on observed
dietary intake of the various foods and/or nutrients.
While a posteriori derived patterns may not necessarily
represent optimal dietary patterns, as they are outcome-
independent, a priori techniques are limited by the current
knowledge which may generate uncertainty regarding
which nutrients and cutoff points to use when generating
scores [19].
The objective of this study was to examine the relation-
ship between dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods
and the nutritional quality of the US diet through the evalu-
ation of dietary contents of critical nutrients individually
and also overall, using dietary pattern analysis.
Methods
Data source, population and sampling
We utilized nationally representative data from the
2009–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), a continuous, nationally representative,
cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized, civilian US
residents [32].
The survey included an interview conducted in the
home and a subsequent health examination performed
at a mobile examination center (MEC). All NHANES
examinees were eligible for two 24-h dietary recall inter-
views. The first dietary recall interview was collected
in-person in the MEC while the second was collected
by telephone three to ten days later. Dietary inter-
views were conducted by trained interviewers using
the validated [33–35] US Department of Agriculture
Automated Multiple-Pass Method.
Among the 13,272 people screened in NHANES in
2009–2010, 10,537 (79.4%) participated in the household
interview and 10,253 (77.3%) also participated in the
MEC health examination. Of these, 9,754 individuals
provided one day of complete dietary intakes, and 8406
provided two days’ worth.
We evaluated 9,317 survey participants aged 1 year and
above who had at least one day of 24-h dietary recall data
and had not been breast-fed on either of the two days. Data
for two recall days were used when available, and one day
otherwise. These 9,317 individuals had similar sociodemo-
graphic characteristics (gender, age, race/ethnicity, family
income, and educational attainment) to the full sample of

 10,109 interviewed participants aged 1 year and above
(Additional file 1: Table S1).
Food classification according to processing
We classified all recorded food items (N = 280,132 Food
Codes) according to Nova, a food classification based
on the extent and purpose of industrial food processing
[4, 17]. Nova includes four groups: “unprocessed or
minimally processed foods” (such as fresh, dry, or
frozen fruits or vegetables; packaged grains and pulses;
grits, flakes, or flours made from corn, wheat, or
cassava; pasta, fresh or dry, made from flour and water;
eggs; fresh or frozen meat and fish and fresh or pas-
teurized milk); “processed culinary ingredients” (includ-
ing salt, vinegar, oils, fats, sugar, and other substances
extracted from foods and used in kitchens to season
and cook unprocessed or minimally processed foods
and to make culinary preparations), “processed foods”
(including pickled vegetables, fruit preserves, salted
meat products, canned fish in water or oil, cheeses,
artisan-style breads (no additives), and other ready-to-
consume products manufactured with the addition of
salt, vinegar, sugar, oil, or other substances of culinary
use to unprocessed or minimally processed foods), and
“ultra-processed foods.”
The Nova group of ultra-processed foods, of particular
interest in this study, includes soft drinks, sweet or
savory packaged snacks, confectionery and industrialized
desserts, mass-produced packaged breads and buns,
poultry and fish nuggets and other reconstituted meat
products, instant noodles and soups, and many other
ready-to-consume formulations of several ingredients.
Besides salt, sugar, oils, and fats, ultra-processed foods
ingredients include food substances not commonly used
in culinary preparations, and this is what distinguishes
them from processed foods. These ingredients include
modified starches, hydrogenated oils, protein isolates, and
additives whose purpose is to imitate sensorial qualities of
unprocessed or minimally processed foods and their culin-
ary preparations, or to disguise undesirable qualities of the
final product, such as colorants, flavorings, non-sugar
sweeteners, emulsifiers, humectants, sequestrants, and
firming, bulking, de-foaming, anti-caking, and glazing
agents. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods repre-
sent a small proportion of, or are even absent from, the
list of ingredients of ultra-processed products. A detailed
definition of each Nova food group and examples of food
items classified in each group are shown elsewhere [11].
The
rationale
underlying
the
classification
is
also
explained elsewhere [1–3, 36, 37].
For all food items (Food Codes) judged to be a hand-
made recipe (prepared from fresh or minimally proc-
essed foods and processed culinary ingredients), the
classification was applied to the underlying ingredients
(Standard Reference Codes -SR Codes-) obtained from
the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies
(FNDDS) 5.0 [38]. More details in this regard have been
previously published [11].
Assessing energy and nutrient contents
For this study, we used Food Code nutrient values as
provided by NHANES.
For handmade recipes, we calculated the underlying
ingredient (SR Code) nutrient values using variables
from both FNDDS 5.0 [38] and USDA National Nutrient
Database for Standard Reference, Release 24 (SR24) [39].
The following nutrients were considered in this study:
protein, carbohydrates, added sugars, fats, saturated fats,
sodium, vitamins A (as retinol activity equivalents), C, D,
and E (as alpha-tocopherol), iron, zinc, potassium, phos-
phorus, magnesium, calcium, and fiber. These included
most underconsumed (vitamins A, C, D, and E, calcium,
magnesium, potassium, and fiber) and all overconsumed
(sodium, added sugar, and saturated fat) nutrients in the
US population [40].
Data on added sugars per Food Code and per SR Code
were obtained by merging the Food Patterns Equivalents
Database (FPED) 2009–2010 and Food Patterns Equiva-
lents Ingredients Database (FPID) 2009–2010 [41].
We used the following conversion factors: 4 kcal/g for
carbohydrates and protein, 9 kcal/g for fat and 7 kcal/g for
alcohol. Total energy intake was calculated as the sum of
calories from carbohydrates, proteins, fat, and alcohol.
Data analysis
We utilized all available dietary intake data for each par-
ticipant, using means of both recall days when available
(86% of participants) and one day otherwise.
Food items were sorted into mutually exclusive food
subgroups within each of the four Nova groups, as
shown in Table 1. First, we evaluated the contributions
of each food group and subgroup to total energy intake
and across quintiles of the dietary energy contribution of
ultra-processed foods (henceforth “dietary share of ultra-
processed foods”). The group of unprocessed or minim-
ally processed foods was also combined with the group
of processed culinary ingredients, as foods belonging to
these two groups are usually combined together in culin-
ary preparations and therefore consumed together.
We then compared the average dietary content of mac-
ronutrients (expressed as percent of total energy) and of
micronutrients and fiber (both expressed as g/1,000 kcal)
across quintiles of dietary share of ultra-processed foods.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the
methods that can be used to empirically derive dietary
patterns. This is a mathematical technique that allows
reducing the complexity of interrelationships among ob-
served variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated

 linear combinations of them referred to as “components”
and which maximize the explained variance [19, 42].
Using PCA, through the correlation matrix applied to
the dietary content of macronutrients, micronutrients, and
fiber, we identified four nutrient dietary patterns in the
sample (Vitamin E was excluded because it loaded on all
main extracted components). The four patterns were se-
lected based on the Kaiser criterion (eigenvalue > 1.0), scree
plot, and PCA components interpretability. The compo-
nents were rotated using the varimax procedure and a
factor score was calculated for each of the four patterns.
PCA was conducted in the whole sample and stratify-
ing by age (1–5, 6–11, 12–19, 20–39, 40–59, 60+ years),
sex, race/ethnicity (Mexican-American, Other Hispanic,
Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Other Race),
ratio of family income to poverty line (0.00–1.30, >1.30–
3.50, and >3.50) [32] and educational attainment of
respondents aged 20+ years or of household reference
person otherwise (<12, 12 years, and >12 years). Final
PCA results are presented for all strata combined be-
cause, despite some variations, comparable patterns were
observed across sociodemographic strata.
We used Gaussian regression to estimate the associ-
ation between the dietary share of ultra-processed
foods and the four component factor scores. To relax
the linearity assumption of the association, the dietary
contribution of ultra-processed foods variable was
transformed using restricted cubic splines with five
knots. The model was also fit using z-standardized
scores. The factor scores were then regressed on the
quintiles of the dietary share of ultra-processed foods.
Finally, factor scores were categorized into tertiles to
express low, middle, and high adherence to the dietary
pattern in order to examine the category distribution
across quintiles of the dietary share of ultra-processed
foods.
All regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, family income [32], and educational attain-
ment. As 908 participants had missing values on family
income and/or educational attainment, adjusted analyses
included 8,409 individuals.
NHANES survey sample weights were used in all
analyses except the PCA correlation matrix, to account
for differential probabilities of selection for the individ-
ual domains, nonresponse to survey instruments, and
differences between the final sample and the total US
population. The Taylor series linearization variance
approximation procedure was used to account for com-
plex sample design and sample weights [32]. Tests of
linear trend were performed to evaluate the effect of
quintiles as a single continuous variable.
To minimize chance findings from multiple compari-
sons, statistical hypotheses were tested using a two-
tailed p ≤ 0.001 level of significance. Data were analyzed
using Stata version 12.1.
Results
Distribution of total energy intake according to food groups
and across quintiles of dietary share of ultra-processed foods
The average US daily energy intake in 2009–2010 was
2,069.9 kcal, 57.5% of calories coming from ultra-
processed foods, 30.2% from unprocessed or minimally
processed foods, 9.3% from processed foods and 2.9%
from processed culinary ingredients (Table 1). The
energy contribution of most subgroups belonging to
ultra-processed foods increased monotonically from the
first to the last quintile of the dietary share of ultra-
processed foods, with a few exceptions that showed a
slight decrease between the fourth and fifth quintiles.
An opposite trend was observed among subgroups from
all three remaining groups.

 Nutrient dietary contents according to dietary share of
ultra-processed foods
The average dietary protein content decreased signifi-
cantly and monotonically across quintiles of the dietary
share of ultra-processed foods (from 17.9% of total energy
intake in the lowest quintile to 13.1% in the highest). The
content of alcohol evolved in a similar way (from 4.1% to
0.9% of total energy intake). In contrast, across the same
quintiles, there were significant increases in the content of
carbohydrates (from 46.5% to 53.4%), added sugars (7.7%
to 19.2%), and saturated fats (10.1% to 10.9%) (Table 2).
The average dietary content of fiber and of all micro-
nutrients except iron and sodium decreased significantly
and monotonically across quintiles of the dietary share
of ultra-processed foods: fiber (from 9.6 in the lowest
quintile to 6.7 g/1,000 kcal in the highest), vitamin A
(377.5 to 272.3 μg/1,000 kcal), vitamin C (58.2 to
32.4 mg/1,000 kcal), vitamin D (3.3 to 2.0 μg/1,000 kcal)
and vitamin E (4.1 to 3.3 mg/1,000 kcal), zinc (6.3 to
4.9 mg/1,000 kcal), potassium (1.6 to 1.0 g/1,000 kcal),
phosphorus (728.9 to 605.9 mg/1,000 kcal), magnesium
(173.3 to 117.3 mg/1,000 kcal), and calcium (531.1 to
464.7 mg/1,000 kcal). The sodium dietary content de-
creased non-significantly across quintiles of the dietary
share of ultra-processed foods (from 1.74 to 1.63 g/
1,000 kcal), while the iron content increased between
the first and third quintiles and decreased thereafter.
Nutrient dietary patterns obtained through PCA
Through PCA, four of 15 components had an eigen-
value >1.0 and explained 67% of the variance, and all
four were retained. The rotated factor loadings of these
four components are displayed in Table 3 (factor loadings
above 0.20 and below -0.20 have been highlighted).
The first component was characterized by being richer in
fiber, potassium, magnesium, and vitamin C, and having less
saturated fat and added sugars (variables with factor load-
ings above 0.20 or below -0.20). The factor loading for so-
dium was close to zero in this first component (0.04). This
component, called nutrient balanced pattern, was selected
as an instrument to measure the quality of the diet overall.
Each
of
the
three
remaining
components
mixed
healthy and unhealthy features regarding dietary nutrient
contents. The second component indicated higher con-
tent in both saturated fat and micronutrients such as

Comparable PCA patterns were observed across socio-

Nutrient balanced pattern as illustrated for race/ethni-

Association between the dietary share of ultra-processed
foods and the nutrient balanced pattern
In unadjusted restricted cubic splines Gaussian regres-
sion analysis, a strong linear association was identified
between the dietary share of ultra-processed foods and
the nutrient balanced pattern factor score (coefficient
for linear term = -0.03, 95% CI: -0.04 to -0.02) (Fig. 1).
There was little evidence of nonlinearity in the restricted
cubic spline model (Wald test for linear term p < 0.001;
Wald test for all non-linear terms p = 0.16). The strength of
the association remained nearly the same after adjusting for
sex, age, race/ethnicity, family income, and educational
attainment (coefficient for linear term = -0.04, 95% CI: -0.05
to -0.03). According to the adjusted model, one standard
deviation increase in the dietary share of ultra-processed
foods leads to a 0.38 standard deviation decrease in the
nutrient balanced pattern factor score.
Across quintiles of the dietary share of ultra-processed
foods, the adjusted mean nutrient balanced pattern
factor score decreased monotonically, from 1.1 in the
lowest quintile to -0.9 in the highest (Table 4). Across
the same quintiles, the proportion of individuals with

adherence

pattern
decreased monotonically from 58.4% in the lowest
quintile of the dietary share of ultra-processed foods
to 11.0% in the highest. Inversely, the proportion of
individuals with low adherence increased from 13.3%

The dietary share of ultra-processed foods also pre-
sented an inverse association with the remaining three
components (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The mean
factor scores of these three remaining components also

Discussion
In this analysis of US nationally representative data, we
show that a significant linear inverse relationship exists
between the dietary contribution of ultra-processed
foods and the dietary content of protein, fiber, vitamins
A, C, D, and E, zinc, potassium, phosphorus, magne-
sium, and calcium. On the other hand, carbohydrate,
saturated fat, and added sugar contents increased signifi-
cantly with the dietary contribution of ultra-processed
foods. Only diets in the lowest quintile of ultra-
processed consumption had the average added sugar
content below the upper limit recommended by the
2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans [40], while
the average saturated fat content exceeded the same
limit in all quintiles, with the lowest quintile moving
closest to the recommendation.
We also found an inverse dose–response association
between ultra-processed food dietary contribution and
the overall dietary quality measured through a nutrient
balanced pattern PCA-derived factor score characterized
by being richer in fiber, potassium, magnesium, and vita-
min C, and having less saturated fat and added sugars.
Furthermore, we found substantially higher adherence to
the nutrient balanced pattern in lower quintiles of ultra-
processed food dietary contribution than in higher ones.
These results are relevant because both individual edu-
cation interventions and food environment regulatory
policies have the potential to modify the dietary content
of ultra-processed foods. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to evaluate the association between the diet-
ary contribution of ultra-processed foods and the overall
nutritional quality of diets in the US.
The non-significant but somewhat unexpected sodium
content decrease across quintiles of the dietary share of
ultra-processed foods may be partly explained by the fact
that in the US processed foods include basically “salty
products” – such as cheese, ham, or vegetables in brine –
while most ultra-processed foods are either “sweet prod-
ucts” (soft, fruit, and milk drinks, cakes, cookies, breakfast
cereals, ice cream, sweet snacks, industrialized desserts) or
products containing both salt and sugar (breads, sauces,
canned soups, dressings, gravies, dips, spreads, mustard,
catsup). Still, the sodium dietary content was above the
Tolerable Upper Intake Level for any sex-age group [40]
regardless of the share of ultra-processed foods.
The not uncommon iron fortification of ultra-processed
foods or their ingredients may explain why the iron
content does not show the reverse gradient across quin-
tiles of ultra-processed food consumption seen among
other micronutrients.
Few studies have assessed the impact of levels of food
processing on the nutrient contents of the US diet. One
study [43] that applied a food-industry-supported classifi-
cation system [44] to NHANES 2003–2008 food intake
data found that, together, “mixtures of combined ingredi-
ents” and “ready-to-eat,” which are mostly ultra-processed
foods, contributed to 51% of total energy intake in the US
diet but to only 37% of the protein intake and to 73% of
the added sugar intake. These two food groups also con-
tributed to 37% of the fiber intake and to between 30%
and 60% of the intake of micronutrients [43]. Analyses of
the same data restricted to children and adolescents [45]
and to adults [46] showed similar results. Unfortunately,
these studies on data from NHANES 2003–2008 failed to
explore whether the dietary content of critical nutrients

Another

US
household
barcoded
purchasing data from 2000 to 2012 using a classification
system guided by the one used in our study [12]. In
2012, the mean per capita purchase of “highly processed
foods,” a category similar to ultra-processed foods, had
higher adjusted median saturated fat, total sugar, and
sodium content than “less processed foods.” This report
did not capture non-barcoded items such as unpackaged
fresh fruit, vegetables, and meat, or highly processed
foods such as ready-to-eat store-prepared items, and did
not explore whether the dietary content of critical nutri-
ents actually differed between high and low consumers
of “highly processed foods".
Consistent with our results, an investigation in Canada
using 2001 household purchasing data found a decrease in
protein content and fiber density across quintiles of the
energy share of ultra-processed foods, together with an
increase in the content of free sugars and total fats [10].
A study carried out in Brazil using 2008–2009 national
food intake data found that protein, fiber, sodium, and
potassium decreased significantly across quintiles of the
dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods, while free
sugars, total fats, and saturated fats increased [8]. After
adjusting for family income, there was a significant drop in
the dietary content of vitamin D, vitamin E, phosphorus,
magnesium, and zinc, and an increase in calcium [9].
Our study has several strengths. We studied a large,
nationally representative sample of the US population,
increasing generalizability. Our investigation was based
on total effective individual consumption data, rather
than on household purchasing data [7, 10, 47], which do
not evaluate the fraction of wasted food or purchases at
restaurants.
Potential limitations should be considered. As with
most population measures, dietary data obtained by 24-
h recalls are imperfect. However, 24-h recalls are the
least-biased self-report instrument available. Also, stan-
dardized methods and approach of NHANES have been
shown to produce accurate intake estimates [33–35],
and will therefore be suitable for assessing food group
contributions and nutrient densities in the overall diet.
Although NHANES collects limited information indica-
tive of food processing (i.e., place of meals, product
brands), these data are not consistently determined for
all food items and this may lead to groups classification
errors. Also, as some authors have highlighted, the num-
ber of food items reported in NHANES is smaller than
the number available in the marketplace, and national
food composition data are not updated as required to
include all brand-specific products and to examine diet-
ary profiles sensitive to brand preferences [48]. The PCA
method also has limitations such as subjective decisions
regarding the number of extracted components, method
of rotation, naming of components, and cutoffs for factor
loadings [23, 31, 49].
Conclusions
This study suggests that decreasing the dietary share of
ultra-processed foods is a rational and effective way to
substantially improve dietary quality in the US.
