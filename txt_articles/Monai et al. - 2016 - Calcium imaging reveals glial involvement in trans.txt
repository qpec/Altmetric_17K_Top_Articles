Transcranical direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a treatment known to ameliorate various
neurological conditions and enhance memory and cognition in humans. tDCS has gained
traction for its potential therapeutic value; however, little is known about its mechanism of
action. Using a transgenic mouse expressing G-CaMP7 in astrocytes and a subpopulation of
excitatory neurons, we find that tDCS induces large-amplitude astrocytic Ca2 þ surges across
the entire cortex with no obvious changes in the local field potential. Moreover, sensory
evoked cortical responses are enhanced after tDCS. These enhancements are dependent on
the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor and are not observed in IP3R2 (inositol trisphosphate receptor
type 2) knockout mice, in which astrocytic Ca2 þ surges are absent. Together, we propose
that tDCS changes the metaplasticity of the cortex through astrocytic Ca2 þ/IP3 signalling.

ranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-
invasive brain stimulation procedure, in which weak d.c.
current (typically 1 mA) is applied over cortical areas for
10–30 min through the skull. tDCS has been shown effective for
alleviating neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions such as
major depression in humans1. tDCS has also been demonstrated
to enhance learning and memory formation2,3. Previous work
demonstrated that tDCS applied over the motor cortex of human
subjects increases the excitability of the motor cortex in a
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent manner4.

tDCS-induced plasticity remain largely unknown.
Multiple studies show crucial roles of astrocytes in NMDAR-
dependent plasticity6–9, using rodent in vitro and in vivo
preparations.
These
studies
imply
that
astrocytes
make
gliotransmission to secrete signalling molecules to synapses.
Several
lines
of
evidence
that
gliotransmission
occurs
by
intracellular Ca2 þ elevation have been reported, although the
exact mechanism of gliotransmission is still controversial10,11. As
recent animal models of tDCS have successfully demonstrated
enhancements in learning and synaptic plasticity2,12,13, we sought
to address the dynamical activity of the brain during tDCS by
Ca2 þ imaging.
G-CaMP7 is a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based Ca2 þ
indicator protein that was improved from the original G-CaMP14
by directed site mutagenesis to yield higher signal-to-noise ratio
and faster response time, making it suitable for monitoring
neuronal activity15. Here we introduce a transgenic mouse line
‘G7NG817’ in which astrocytes and a subset of cortical neurons
express G-CaMP7 permitting transcranial imaging, using a
standard stereo fluorescence microscope. Surprisingly, we find
that tDCS invokes large-amplitude and synchronized Ca2 þ
surges in astrocytes. This phenomenon lead to the hypothesis
that tDCS-induced astrocytic activity affects the metaplasticity of
the cortex in a similar manner to astrocytic modulation of
synaptic plasticity by neuromodulators16.
Results
Functional mapping of the cortex using the G7NG817 mouse.
The G7NG817 line was generated by a random insertion of a
transgenic construct to express G-CaMP7 under the control of
the GLT-1 promoter (see Methods). G-CaMP7 expression in the
brain of the G7NG817 mouse was widespread and distinct from
its background strain C57BL/6 (Fig. 1a). Particularly, high
expression levels were observed in the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus. Double immunostaining for S100B (astrocyte
marker) and GFP (G-CaMP7 marker) shows that virtually all
cortical astrocytes express G-CaMP7 (Fig. 1b; Supplementary
Fig. 1A; 95.2%; n ¼ 3 mice), whereas other glia cell types show
minimal expression (Supplementary Fig. 1C). In addition, neu-
ronal expression of G-CaMP7 was observed (Supplementary
Fig. 1D). The neuronal expression of G-CaMP7 in the cerebral
cortex is not detectable in gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic
(GABAergic) cells (Supplementary Fig. 1E) and has a layer-
dependent profile (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 1B). G-CaMP7
expression is also present in the processes of astrocytes and
neurons, thus labelling the neurogliopil throughout the cortical
depth. The high G-CaMP7 expression across the wide cortical
area allowed transcranial imaging of neuronal and astrocytic
Ca2 þ activities of different cortical states (Supplementary Figs 2
and 3; Supplementary Video 1), as well as various sensory
responses (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4; Supplementary Video 2).
Activation of cortex-wide Ca2 þ elevations caused by tDCS.
Given the versatility of the G7NG817 mouse as a tool for
monitoring cortical activity, we investigated brain activity during
tDCS. We applied a 0.1 mA d.c. for 10 min between an anode at
the cranial bone above the visual cortex (2 mm2 contact area) and
a cathode attached to the neck of an awake mouse. To our
surprise, a large Ca2 þ elevation was observed within several
seconds after the onset of tDCS (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Video 3).
We find that the minimum current required to induce a Ca2 þ
surge is around 50 mA at the anode (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).
The peri-stimulus-averaged trace of the fluorescence signal in the
vicinity of the anodal site (within 500 mm) from eight animals
shows a distinct peak within several seconds (Fig. 1e,f). Similar
peaks were seen at the ipsilateral anterior site (3 mm anterior
from the anodal site) and the contralateral area (laterally
symmetric to the anodal site).
We find that the tDCS-induced Ca2 þ surges have larger
amplitudes than spontaneous Ca2 þ surges (sponta.) at both
anodal and contra-anodal sites (Fig. 1g; sponta. versus tDCS
DF/F; anodal: 7.70±1.1% versus 38.61±8.38%; contra-anodal:
7.27±1.94% versus 29.18±3.18%; anodal versus contra-anodal:
P ¼ 0.30; sponta. versus tDCS: P ¼ 0.0001, two-way ANOVA).
Moreover, tDCS-induced initial Ca2 þ events appeared virtually
simultaneously in the anodal, contra-anodal and distal regions of
the cortex (Supplementary Video 3). Indeed, the time until the
peak of a Ca2 þ surge from the onset of the surge was similar
between the two hemispheres (Fig. 1h). Remarkably, long-lasting
Ca2 þ surges (full-width half-maximum Z10 s) occurred more
frequently during tDCS (Fig. 1i, P ¼ 3.44E � 7), while shorter
events occurred with a similar frequency during tDCS (P ¼ 0.58).
Furthermore, tDCS-induced Ca2 þ surges in urethane-anaesthe-
tized mice too with similar amplitudes (9 out of 10 mice), but the
onset of the initial Ca2 þ surge varied between mice (Fig. 1j,k)
and the frequency of the long-lasting Ca2 þ surges was reduced
(Fig. 1l; P ¼ 0.0022). Notably, tDCS did not induce Ca2 þ surges
in awake G7NG817 mice that are deficient of inositol trispho-
sphate receptor type 2 (IP3R2)17 (Fig. 1l; Supplementary Fig. 7,
Supplementary Video 4), the receptor responsible for large
cytosolic Ca2 þ elevations in astrocytes18. This result indicates
that astrocytic Ca2 þ elevation is likely the key contributor.
Previous studies reported that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor
(A1AR)
signalling
underlies
Ca2 þ
elevations
in
cortical
astrocytes in awake states19,20. In this regard, tDCS-induced
cortical Ca2 þ surges during awake states were blocked by the
A1AR blocker prazosin or diminishment of noradrenergic
innervation by N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine
(DSP-4) treatment21 (Fig. 1l, see Methods). The stimulation
parameters were found to be sufficient to alleviate a mouse model
of depression by chronic restraint stress (Supplementary Fig. 8).
tDCS did not alleviate the depression-like behavior in mice with
prazosin administration, DSP-4 treatment or IP3R2 deficiency.
Moreover, we could not observe obvious astrocytic nor microglial
reactivity after tDCS applied to awake mice (Supplementary
Fig. 9), after 3 h.
Astrocytes underlie tDCS-induced cortical Ca2 þ surges. To
investigate the cellular mechanism of the tDCS-induced Ca2 þ
surges, two-photon imaging in layer 2/3 of the primary visual
cortex was performed through a cranial window in urethane-
anaesthetized G7NG817 mice. As demonstrated with transcranial
imaging, synchronized and large-amplitude Ca2 þ surges were
evoked in a population of cells with tDCS (0.1 mA, 10 min;
Fig. 2a). Notably, these cells were SR101-positive astrocytes
(Fig. 2b). Further analysis revealed that the tDCS evoked astro-
cytic Ca2 þ responses had significantly higher amplitudes than

tDCS had similar amplitudes as spontaneous events (Fig. 2c,

cells that had at least one Ca2 þ event during the respective

Next,
we
compared the neuronal Ca2 þ event frequencies in time windows
without astrocytic Ca2 þ surges (astro off) versus times with
astrocytic Ca2 þ surges (astro on) during control or tDCS periods.
In this comparison, we did not see any significant changes in the
neuronal Ca2 þ event frequency (Fig. 2f).
Similar to the result that tDCS-induced Ca2 þ surges were
blocked by systemic administration of prazosin, local application
of prazosin (200 mM topically applied on the craniotomy 20 min
before imaging) blocked the tDCS-induced astrocytic Ca2 þ
surges, suggesting that noradrenergic activation of A1ARs is
likely the key mechanism for the tDCS-induced Ca2 þ surges
(Fig. 2g). Furthermore, Ca2 þ surges were not induced by tDCS in
IP3R2 knockout (KO) mice (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 7),
indicating that astrocytic GPCR activation is the prevalent
mechanism of tDCS-induced Ca2 þ surges.
While the Ca2 þ signals from the somata of astrocytes and
neurons are separable in G7NG817 by labelling glia with SR101,
the neurogliopil signal is a mixed product of neurons and glia. To
unambiguously investigate the contribution of cortical neurons
and astrocytes to tDCS-induced Ca2 þ surge, we expressed
G-CaMP7 in neurons or astrocytes by cell-type-specific recombi-
nant adeno-associated viruses (AAV2.1-hSyn1-G-CaMP7 and
AAV9-hGFAP-G-CaMP7,
respectively)

and astrocyte-specific astropil were imaged. These experiments
confirmed that astrocyte somata, but not neuronal somata, give

 rise to long-lasting (Z10 s) Ca2 þ surges with tDCS. Moreover,
the astropil showed Ca2 þ responses after tDCS that co-occurred
with the somatic Ca2 þ surges (Fig. 2h), whereas the neuropil
from local neurons did not respond to tDCS (Fig. 2i). The
analysis of the cell-type-specific imaging shows that tDCS

vicinity of the anode did not show obvious alternations with tDCS

tDCS-induced sensory plasticity depends on A1AR and IP3R2.
tDCS has been reported to have positive effects on memory and
plasticity in animal models and in humans3,4,12. We sought to
address the plastic effects of tDCS by investigating the visual
evoked potential (VEP) in the primary visual cortex for an light-
emitting diode flash stimulation. Urethane-anaesthetized C57BL/
6 naive mice were used to record VEPs before and after tDCS
(Fig. 3a). As a result, VEP slope increased by 50% after tDCS and
remained potentiated for at least 2 h. This plasticity was blocked
by the NMDAR antagonist AP-5, suggesting that glutamatergic
synapses are involved (Fig. 3b). To investigate the contribution of
A1ARs
in
the
tDCS-induced
plasticity,
we
repeated
the
experiment
with
topical
application
of
prazosin
(200 mM,
applied
before
20 min
stimulus
presentation).
Remarkably,
tDCS did not enhance the VEP in the prazosin condition
(Fig. 3a,b) or in DSP-4-treated mice, whereas the muscarinic
receptor antagonist atropine (2–3 mM) did not block the effect.
Moreover, tDCS-induced VEP slope enhancements were not
observed in IP3R2 KO mice (n ¼ 5 mice for AP-5, 12 mice for
IP3R2 KO mice and 6 mice for all other groups). These results
suggest an essential role of astrocytic Ca2 þ elevations in the
tDCS-induced enhancement of VEP. To examine the origin of
LFP enhancement, neurogliopil imaging was performed with
G7NG817 mice in layer 2/3 and 4 of the primary visual cortex.
The neurogliopil response was enhanced in layer 2/3, but not in
layer 4 (Fig. 3c). We next monitored visual flash responses of
layer 2/3 astropil and neuropil by imaging after cell-type-specific
expression of G-CaMP7 with AAV (Fig. 3d, n ¼ 6 mice for
astropil expression by AAV9-hGFAP-G-CaMP7, n ¼ 3 mice for
neuropil expression by AAV2.1-hSyn1-G-CaMP7). As a single
visual flash does not result in Ca2 þ elevation in astropil in layer
2/3 (Fig. 3d), the neurogliopil results in Fig. 3c likely reflect
responses from neurons. Indeed, neuropil imaging confirmed that
neuropil response in layer 2/3 was significantly enhanced after
tDCS (Fig. 3d, P ¼ 0.0062).
The sensory response enhancement by tDCS was also seen in
the whisker-barrel cortex system (P ¼ 8.08E � 13, n ¼ 7, 6 and 8
mice for control, prazosin and IP3R2 KO experiments, respec-
tively). Similar to the visual system, tDCS-induced plasticity was
blocked by prazosin and was not present in IP3R2 KO mice
(Fig. 3e,f).
To examine the effect of tDCS in cortical plasticity in awake
mice, we monitored the cortical response for a visual flash
stimulation with transcranial imaging of G7NG817 mice. Visual
flashes were presented to either eye (10 s apart) and the visual
stimulation was repeated at an interval of 60 s before and after
tDCS (Fig. 4a,b). We analysed the visual evoked responses
obtained before and after tDCS (Fig. 4c). An area of 1.0 mm by
1.0 mm centred at the peak of the visual evoked response during
the control period was analysed. This area corresponded to the
primary visual cortex. As a result, the amplitudes of the
visual evoked responses on the anodal side were enhanced after
tDCS (Fig. 4d, anodal DF/F, post1–3, relative to control:
129.80±11.95%, n ¼ 8 mice, P ¼ 0.0004). Furthermore, the visual
evoked active area (see Methods) expanded after tDCS and the
expansion persisted for at least 3 h (Fig. 4e, anodal active area
relative to control: 150.66±20.42%, P ¼ 0.0001). We also note
that the decay slope of the Ca2 þ
transient became less
steep (Fig. 4f, P ¼ 0.0004). Similar changes were observed in the
contra-anodal sites. Notably, tDCS-induced plasticity was blocked
by acute systemic prazosin administration or in mice treated with
DSP-4, pointing to the involvement of noradrenergic activation
(Fig. 4d). This tDCS-induced plasticity was also observed in
urethane-anaesthetized animals (n ¼ 3, P ¼ 0.022), excluding
potential effects of a startle response.
Discussion
We demonstrate that the G7NG817 mouse yields high enough
G-CaMP7 expression in astrocytes and neurons to permit
transcranial functional imaging with a standard fluorescent stereo
microscope. As the BAC-GLT-1 promoter is known to be
active predominantly in astrocytes22, the strong expression of
the transgene in cortical neurons in G7NG817 is ectopic.
Nevertheless, the fortuitous combination of highly expressing
neurons and astrocytes resulted in a transgenic mouse that allows
transcranial fluorescence imaging for functional mapping of the
cerebral cortex, even with heterozygous mice (Supplementary
Fig. 11).
Although tDCS has been shown to have positive effects on
memory
and
remedial
effects
on
neuropsychiatric
and
neurological conditions in humans1,23, its mechanism of action
is largely unknown. Using tDCS parameters commonly used
for small rodent models23–28, we find that the activation
of cortical neurons was undetectable by the analysis methods
we used. This is reasonable, as the stimulus parameters used in
this study are estimated to be close to the neuronal activation
threshold reported in previous studies, which used a voltage-
based
approach29,30.
Unexpectedly,
tDCS-induced
virtually
synchronous astrocytic Ca2 þ surges in wide-spread cortical
areas.
We demonstrated enhancements of sensory evoked cortical
responses after tDCS, consistent with an earlier study performed
with the rabbit whisker system12. In addition, we show that the
lack of the tDCS-induced plasticity in IP3R2 KO mice, suggesting
the involvement of astrocytic Ca2 þ/IP3 signalling. Of note, recent
reports have shown that astrocytic Ca2 þ/IP3 signalling plays a
significant role in in vivo synaptic plasticity in the cortex and
hippocampus7,31–33. Similar to a human study4, we showed that
the tDCS-induced enhancement of sensory evoked LFP response
is NMDAR dependent. As astrocyte Ca2 þ levels are positively
related to the extracellular level of the NMDAR co-agonist
d-serine, tDCS-induced astrocytic Ca2 þ elevations conceivably
lead to NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity6,7,9,34,35.
A large part of the tDCS-induced plasticity was blocked by
prazosin or DSP-4 treatment, indicating the involvement of
noradrenergic activation of A1ARs, which transduce the Gq
signalling cascade for production of IP3. Of note, a recent study
by Panktratov and Lalo35 describes that noradrenaline application
elevates extracellular d-serine and ATP levels, and lowers the
threshold for the induction of LTP-like plasticity in mouse
cortical slices. The same study also demonstrated little neuronal
Ca2 þ elevation after noradrenaline application, supporting our
result that the tDCS-associated Ca2 þ elevations are of astrocytic
origin. Moreover, activation of A1ARs have recently been shown
to be the prevalent mechanism of astrocytic Ca2 þ elevation in
awake mice19,20. The enhanced LFP response following tDCS is
most likely due to a reflection of synaptic current enhancement,
as rodent astrocytic membrane potential fluctuation is modest36.
Our differentiation of neurogliopil signal into neuropil and
astropil components confirmed that tDCS-induced plasticity

Figure 3 | Sensory responses are enhanced by tDCS in a manner dependent on noradrenergic and astrocytic Ca2 þ/IP3 signalling in urethane-
anaesthetized mice. (a) Schematics of visual flash evoked potential (VEP) measurement and evaluation of VEP slope. Example traces of averaged VEP
recorded from the primary visual cortex in wild type (WT, left). The VEP slope is quantified for the interval covering 20–80% of the initial response (red).
The VEP slope at the anodal side is enhanced after tDCS in naive (red, n ¼ 6), but not in mice with prazosin (grey, n ¼ 6). Yellow area represents tDCS
application. Shaded areas represent s.e.m. Inset: examples of mean VEPs for a naive mouse (red) and a prazosin mouse (grey) at 70 min after the onset of
tDCS are compared with pre-tDCS response (black). (b) tDCS-induced VEP slope enhancement is blocked by AP-5 (n ¼ 5, P ¼ 0.86), prazosin (n ¼ 6,
P ¼ 0.26) and DSP-4 (n ¼ 6, P ¼ 0.26) treatment, but not by atropine (n ¼ 6, P ¼ 1.71E-8). Moreover, tDCS-induced VEP slope enhancement is absent in
IP3R2 KO mice (n ¼ 12, P ¼ 1.0). Statistical significance was tested with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. (c) Neurogliopil response to
visual flash stimulation in G7NG817 mice is enhanced after tDCS in layer 2/3 (*P ¼ 0.010, n ¼ 4 mice), but not in layer 4. (d) Layer 2/3 neuropil Ca2 þ
response is significantly enhanced after tDCS (n ¼ 3, P ¼ 0.0062, paired t-test), whereas layer 2/3 astropil did not respond to visual flash stimulus (n ¼ 6).
(e) tDCS-induced enhancement of sensory response in the whisker-barrel cortex system. Single air puffs are applied to whiskers contralateral to anodal and

mouse (red) and an IP3R2 KO mouse (gray), as in a. (f) tDCS enhances the whisker evoked LFP response in the barrel cortex of WT (n ¼ 7, P ¼ 8.08E-13)
and blocked by topical application of prazosin (n ¼ 6, P ¼ 1.0). tDCS does not facilitate the whisker response in the barrel cortex of IP3R2 KO mice (n ¼ 8,

 occurs in neurons. Collectively, we have identified a major
intermediate mechanism between the impact of the electrical field
and neural plasticity mediated by astrocytic activity (Supple-
mentary Fig. 12).
Potential mechanisms for this tDCS-induced noradrenergic
drive
include
activation
of
the
locus
coeruleus
and/or
direct induction of transmitter release from noradrenergic
axon terminals in the cortex. A simulation study predicts
that axon terminals are more susceptible to polarization than
somata by d.c. stimulation37. It is conceivable that the
activation of neuromodulatory terminals are overlooked in
our imaging experiments because the G-CaMP7 expression in
non-glutamatergic neurons is low in G7NG817 and also
single-axonal signals are not detected by LFP electrodes.
The
bias
of
noradrenergic
activation
over
other
neuro-
transmitters such as glutamate or acetylcholine is not clear.
It is possible that glutamate and acetylcholine, if released in
small amounts, undergo immediate transporter uptake or
enzymatic breakdown before they reach to receptors. Future
studies should identify the mechanism for the prevalent
activation of A1ARs.
Finally, while our results suggest that the tDCS-induced
parameters described in this study did not induce obvious glial
inflammation, the safety standards of tDCS on humans38 should
consider glial components in future.
Methods
All experimental protocols were approved by the RIKEN Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Generation of transgenic mice. G-CaMP7-WPRE-polyA DNA15 was
subcloned into a pCR-FRT-Amp-FRT plasmid39. A bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) clone, RPCI-23-361H22 (BAC PAC Resources), containing the GLT1
gene was modified by the Red/ET recombination system (Gene Bridges) to
insert the PCR fragment of G-CaMP7-WPRE-polyA-FRT-Amp-FRT immediately
downstream of the initiation codon. After selection of recombined colonies
by ampicillin resistance, the Amp cassette was removed from the recombined
BAC clones by introducing the Flp recombinase expression plasmid 706-FLP
(Gene Bridges). The resulting BAC construct was amplified, purified with
the Large-Construction kit (Qiagen) and digested with AscI. Correct
modification of the BAC was verified by pulsed-field gel analysis of restriction
digests and direct sequencing of the insert. The linearized BAC DNA was
purified, adjusted to be B1 ng ml � 1 in a microinjection buffer (10 mM
Tris-Cl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and individually injected
into the pronuclei of 590 C57BL/6 J-fertilized embryos. As a result, 88
founders were born, of which 14 founders were positive for the transgene.
Resulting founder mice were identified by PCR using the following primer pair:
50- CGAGGCGCTAAAGGGCTTACC-30 and 50-GTACCGCCCTTGTACA
GCTC-30. Positive founder mice were crossed with C57BL/6 J mice to
obtain germline transmission and the mouse lines were maintained on this
genetic background. Despite the well-known-specific promoter activity of GLT-1 in
astrocytes in the cerebral cortex22,33,40, we could not obtain any founders
that had astrocyte-specific visible fluorescence expression levels with this
construct. Rather, we obtained several lines in which visible amounts of
fluorescence were seen in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus,
striatum and other regions of the brain. Of these lines, line 817, which

Figure 4 | tDCS-induced enhancement of visual response is observed by transcranial Ca2 þ imaging in awake and anaesthetized conditions. (a)
Schematic diagram of the visual flash and transcranial imaging experiment. (b) Transcranial imaging of visual flash response. tDCS induces an enhancement
of visual flash response in activation area and amplitude (single example). Left- and right-eye flash responses are plotted in upper and lower rows,
respectively (ipsilateral responses are masked out). The colour range is between mean þ 1 s.d. and the peak value of the baseline visual evoked response.
Areas exceeding 90% of the baseline visual evoked response (active areas) are demarcated by solid black borders. (c) Visual evoked Ca2 þ response is
enhanced after tDCS. In the left panel, mean fluorescence responses from G7NG817 mice (n ¼ 8) are plotted for the anodal (upper) and contra-anodal
(lower) sites. Pre-tDCS control response is plotted in black and time periods after tDCS are in colour. Shaded areas represent s.e.m. In the right panel, these
traces are normalized to the peak to show that the decay dynamics are altered after tDCS. (d–f) tDCS enhances amplitude (d), expands the active area (e)
and attenuates the decay slope (f). Sham-operated control mice (n ¼ 7, P ¼ 0.51, two-way ANOVA) do not show significant changes. The tDCS-induced
facilitation of visual evoked response is absent in prazosin-injected (i.p. 10 mg kg � 1, n ¼ 7) or DSP-treated (n ¼ 6) awake mice, but observable in urethane-

 we term G7NG817, exhibited high fluorescence levels in the cerebral cortex.
Homozygous transgenic mice were bred and used in the current study except
for the experiments described in Supplementary Fig. 11, where heterozygous
mice were used.
Surgical procedures for virus innoculation. pAAV-hGFAP-G-CaMP7 was syn-
thesized by modifying the pAAV-hSyn-EGFP vector (Addgene plasmid #50465,
a gift from Bryan Roth) with a human GFAP promoter41 and G-CaMP7
complementary DNA. AAV9-hGFAP-G-CaMP7 was purified at a titre of
1.2 � 1014 vg ml � 1. AAV2.1-hSyn1-G-CaMP7 (ref. 42) (7.1 � 1013 vg ml � 1) is a
gift from Masanori Matsuzaki (National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan). The
viruses were diluted to 5–7 � 1012 vg ml � 1 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
for microinjection. Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane (1.5%) or
ketamine þ xylazine (intraperitoneal (i.p.), 56 and 8 mg kg � 1 , respectively), and
fixed in a stereotaxic frame. A small craniotomy was made at the site of prospective
imaging and a glass micropipette containing AAV was inserted to a depth of
250 mm below the surface of the cortex. Microinjection of 300 nl was made over
5 min using a Femtojet injector (Eppendorf). Imaging experiments were performed
at least 2 weeks later.
Surgical procedures for acute experiments. Male and female C57BL/6 wild type,
G7NG817 and IP3R2 KO17 mice of postnatal 8–12-week old were used. The
background strain of these mice is C57BL/6. Mice were housed under a 12 h/12 h
light/dark cycle and raised in a group of up to five. Mice were anaesthetized with
urethane (1.6 gkg � 1) and the body temperature was maintained at 37 �C with a
heating pad (BWT-100 A, Bio Research Center or TR-200, Fine Science Tools)
during surgery and recording. After skull exposure, a metal frame was attached to
the skull using a dental acrylic (Fuji LUTE BC, GC Corporation, Super Bond C&B,
Sunmedical). For transcranial imaging, the skull was treated by a mixture of
paraffin oil and glycerol (mixture composition) to increase transparency.
For two-photon imaging, a craniotomy (2 mm in diameter) was made above the
visual cortex (anterior-posterior (AP) —2.0 mm, and mediolateral (ML) 3.0 mm).
The dura mater was surgically removed. Sulforhodamine 101 (100 mM in PBS) was
topically applied to label astrocytes and washed with N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-
N0-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)
after 1 min. After the dye loading, the craniotomy was covered with agarose (1.5%
w/v in ACSF) and gently sealed with a thin glass coverslip (3 � 3 mm, thickness:
0.12 mm, Matsunami Glass). The cranial window was secured by dental cement.
For experiments involving LFP recording, a screw electrode (diameter, 0.7 mm;
SUS-XM7, no. 00PH þ 14046, Matsumoto Industry) was implanted in the
interparietal bone to serve as reference.
Procedures for awake mouse recording. One to two weeks before the imaging
session, mice were anaesthetized with a ketamine–xylazine cocktail (70 mg kg � 1
ketamine and 10 mg kg � 1 xylazine). After skull exposure, a stainless metal frame
was attached to the skull using a dental acrylic. Following recovery, the mice were
on a 24-h water-deprivation schedule and trained to be restrained under the
microscope using a mechanical fixture that rigidly fixes the head frame once a day
for 5–7 days. During training, mice have access to water once the head frame is
fixed to the apparatus, thereby making an association between the head fixture and
satiation of thirst.
In vivo transcranial fluorescence imaging. Mice were fixed to a stereotaxic stage
by clamping the head frame and placed under a fluorescence stereo microscope
(MZ10F, Leica). The GFP3 filter set (excitation 470±20 nm, emission 525±25 nm,
Leica) was used with the EL6000 light source (Leica). Images were acquired using
the ORCA-Flash 2.0 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) using HC Image
software (Hamamatsu Photonics). The HC Image software also controlled a shutter
unit to illuminate the skull only during imaging. Images were acquired with a size
of 512 � 512 pixels and 16 bit resolution. For sensory stimulation experiments
(Fig. 4; Supplementary Figs 3, 4 and 11), images were acquired with a 30-Hz frame
rate. For tDCS experiments (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs 5–7B), images were
acquired at 10 Hz. For displaying purposes, the DF/F signal is thresholded at
mean þ s.d. for Figs 1d and 4b; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B and 4. Pseudocolouring
was done using Origin 9.0 (Origin lab).
In vivo two-photon imaging. Two-photon imaging was performed with urethane-
anaesthetized adult mice (as above), using a resonant scanner-based B-Scope
(Thorlabs) with a Chameleon Vision 2 laser (Coherent, wavelength 920 nm) and an
Olympus objective lens (XLPlan N � 25). The B-Scope is equipped with a reverse
dichroic mirror (ZT405/488/561/680-1100rpc, Chroma) and the emission light was
separated by using a dichroic mirror (FF562-Di03, Semrock), with band-pass filters
FF03-525/50 and FF01-607/70 (both from Semrock) for the green and red chan-
nels, respectively. Images were acquired using the ThorImage software with a frame
rate of 30 Hz.
Sensory stimulation. Sensory stimulation was presented to mice as follows. Visual
flash stimulation: a flash of light from a red light-emitting diode (UR5365S, 20 mA,
Stanley Electric) was presented to the right eye and then to the left eye 10 s later in
darkness. This sequence was repeated every minute for 20 min. tDCS (see below)
was applied 1 min after the visual flash stimulus. No visual flash stimulus was
applied during tDCS. The same visual flash stimuli were presented 1 min after
tDCS. For VEP plasticity experiments, the flash signal was presented to the left eye
at an interval of 30 s in a room light condition. Whisker stimulation: individual
whiskers were deflected at a frequency of 10 Hz for 5 s by a custom device made out
of an audio speaker (Supplementary Fig. 4A). For whisker evoked response
plasticity experiments, single air puffs were presented to the left whisker pad
at an interval of 30 s (Fig. 3e,f). Auditory stimulation: 5-kHz pure tone for 500 ms
(76 dB) was presented over a speaker using a custom LabView program
(Supplementary Fig. 4C). Tail pinch: tail pinch was manually applied in anaes-
thetized mice via blunt tongs for several seconds.
Transcranial d.c. stimulation. An anode was placed on a conductive (PBS with
1.5% agarose) gel interface spreading over a 2 mm2 area above the primary visual
cortex. A cathode was inserted to the neck muscle for experiments with anaes-
thetized mice. For experiments with unanaesthetized mice, a cathode was placed on
the neck skin. D.c. was applied from the anode to the cathode with a stimulus
isolator (ISO-Flex, AMPI) or a custom-made isolated constant-current supply,
powered by a 9-V battery. Unless otherwise noted, current intensity and duration
for tDCS are set to be 0.1 mA and 10 min, respectively. The potential difference
between the anode and cathode was typically around 0.5 V.
Local field potential recording. Extracellular recordings were performed with an
ELC-03XS amplifier (NPI electronic). A glass micropipette (2-mm tip diameter,
1B150F-4, World Precision Instruments) was filled with HEPES-ACSF (pH 7.4)
and placed to an electrode holder with a headstage preamplifier. The headstage is
then mounted to a remote-controlled micromanipultor (Sensapix). Under a stereo
microscope, the glass micropipette was inserted to the primary visual cortex
(250 mm below the pia) at a 30� insertion angle. Recording sessions started 1–2 h
after insertion of the electrode for the stabilization of evoked responses43. After
amplification (2000 � , 0.1 Hz to 3 kHz), the signal was digitized at 20 kHz and
stored on a hard drive using a LabVIEW-based data acquisition system. The field
potential experiments have been performed in a room light condition.
Drug application. For pharmacological experiments with cranial window (that is,
two-photon imaging or LFP recording), reagents were dissolved in HEPES-ACSF
(in mM:125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2 and 2 MgSO4) and
applied onto the brain surface from 20 min immediately preceding imaging and
the solution was kept in the cranial window until the end of the experiment.
The concentrations of the applied drugs were: atropine sulfate monohydrate
(2–3 mM, catalogue no. 015-04853, Wako Pure Chemical Industries)7, prazosin
hydrochloride (200 mM, catalogue no. P7791-50MG, Sigma–Addrich)19 and AP-5
(50 mM, Tocris).
For i.p. administration of prazosin performed in transcranial imaging
experiments, injection was made at a dosage of 10 mg kg � 1 (1% w/v, dissolved in
0.9% NaCl). DSP-4 treatment was performed by a single i.p. injection of DSP-4
(50 mg kg � 1, 12.5% w/v, dissolved in 0.9% NaCl) 7 days before the imaging
experiment.
Behavioural test. Chronic restraint stress and tail suspension test (TST) were
performed as described in previous papers44,45. In brief, metal frame-attached mice
were restricted to water access and socially isolated for 12 days (Supplementary
Fig. 8A). Furthermore, each mouse was subjected to 8–9 h of chronic restraint
stress for 5 consecutive days before behavioural test using a plastic cylinder with a
radius of 8 cm and a height of 8 cm. After each session of restraint, animals were
returned to their home cage with free access to food. For the behavioural test, all
mice were exposed to a 9-min TST and the immobility time was counted
(Supplementary Fig. 8B). Each mouse was individually suspended by their tail from
a metal bar fixed 60 cm above the surface of a table with a soft vinyl tape. The test
sessions were recorded by a video camera. The subjects were split into five groups:
sham (n ¼ 10), tDCS (n ¼ 10), prazosin þ tDCS (n ¼ 10), DSP-4 þ tDCS (n ¼ 9)
and IP3R2 KO þ tDCS (n ¼ 9). The protocols of tDCS and drug application were
the same as described above.
The repeated TSTs were performed in six successive trials (Supplementary
Fig. 8A). TST1: 5 days before tDCS as control; TST2: after experienced 5-day
chronic restraint stress; TST3: 180 min after tDCS; TST4: 1 day after tDCS; TST5:
3 days after tDCS; and TST6: 1 week after tDCS.
Histology. Mouse brains were perfusion-fixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde (pH
7.4 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer). Following overnight postfixation in the same
fixative, coronal slices (60 mm) were prepared using a microslicer (PRO 7, Dosaka).
For GFP, NeuN, GFAP and IBA-1 staining, sections were incubated with primary
antibodies (1:2,000 for anti-GFP, NeuN, GFAP and IBA-1 antibodies, Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) with 0.1% Triton X-1000) overnight. For S100B staining, sections were

 first treated with 10% normal goat serum in 0.1% Triton X-100 TBS for 1 h, and
then incubated with anti-S100B antibody (1:1,000) in 10% normal goat serum (in
0.1% Triton X-100 TBS) overnight. For GAD67 staining, we blocked the sections
for 1 h using the Mouse on Mouse Polymer IHC kit (Abcam), and then incubated
with anti-GAD67 antibody (1:500) in 0.1% Triton X-100 TBS for overnight. The
sections were subsequently washed in phosphate buffer and incubated with Alexa
488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 2 h for fluorescent
labelling. Immunolabeled sections were examined using a FV1000 confocal
microscope (Olympus). Confocal images were taken with a 60 � oil immersion lens
(UPlanSApo, numerical aperture (NA) ¼ 1.35). For Supplementary Fig. 9, the
images were acquired with a � 20 objective (UPLanSApo, NA ¼ 0.75) with a z-step
size of 2 mm and a � 60 water immersion lens (UPlanSApo, NA ¼ 1.2) with a
z-step size of 0.5 mm, respectively. Primary antibodies were obtained from the
following sources: GFP46, NeuN (Chemicon, MAB377), S100B (Sigma, S2532),
GAD67 (Millipore, MAB5406), GFAP(DAKO, Z0334) and IBA-1 (Wako, 019-
19741).
Data analysis. Extracellular field recording. For spectral power analyses
(Supplementary Fig. 10), the power spectral density was estimated by the Welch
periodogram method using a Hamming window (window size ¼ 0.82 s;
overlap ¼ 0.41 s). Recordings within 10 s from the onset or offset of tDCS were
excluded from the analysis. The slope of evoked visual field response was calculated
as follows. First, the initial deflection of the LFP response was isolated. Next, the
region for slope calculation was defined as the interval within 20–80% of the peak-
to-peak amplitude of the negative deflection 7 (Fig. 3a). The slope was computed by
linear regression of the selected region.
Transcranial imaging. The original 512 � 512 pixel images were reduced
to 64 � 64 pixels by binning. For sensory stimulus response imaging (Fig. 4;
Supplementary Figs 2,3A,4 and 11), DF/F was calculated by taking the baseline
F as the signal 500 ms before the stimulus presentation. For tail pinch or tDCS
experiments (Figs 1 and 2; Supplementary Figs 3 and 7), the baseline F is defined as
the mean intensity of the 50 s period ending 10 s before tail pinch or tDCS. For the
analysis of the spontaneous slow oscillations (Supplementary Figs 2 and 6), the
baseline F is defined as the mean intensity for the entire imaging period. Cross
correlation was computed with the Z scores of the mean intensities of the region of
interests (ROIs), so that the result is the Pearson correlation coefficient. Ca2 þ
events are defined as the events that had DF/F larger than the mean þ 1 s.d. for
longer than 1 s and classified into two classes: those which had DF/F larger than
mean þ 1 s.d. for shorter than 10 s (o10 s) and others that lasted longer (Z 0 s;
Fig. 1i,l; and Supplementary Fig. 11C). Time to Ca2 þ onset is defined as the
time where DF/F exceeded the mean þ 3 s.d. since the start of tDCS (Fig. 1h;
Supplementary Fig. 11B). For the analysis of visual evoked response area, the active
area is defined as the region that exceeds 90% of the mean peak response during the
control period (Fig. 4b,e; and Supplementary Fig. 11F). To compute the decay
slope, the mean visual evoked responses for respective periods were normalized to
their peak value (Fig. 4f). The slope was computed similarly to VEP (Fig. 3a). All
data are expressed as mean±s.e.m.
Two-photon imaging. The peak amplitude and duration statistics were made on
cells that had at least one Ca2 þ elevation during the course of 600 s imaging
(Fig. 2c,d,j; Supplementary Fig. 3D). For each ROI, the baseline mean and s.d. of
the signal were calculated for the first 60 s. The relative fluorescence change DF/F
was computed, where the DF is the difference from the baseline mean and F is the
baseline mean. Signal fluctuations in an ROI larger than the mean þ 3 s.d. were
considered to be Ca2 þ events (Fig. 2e,g,k; and Supplementary Fig. 7D). The
duration is computed as the full-width half-maximum of the Ca2 þ event
(Supplementary Fig. 3E). For tail pinch experiments, the ‘during tail pinch’ period
is defined as the 100-s period starting from the onset of tail pinch. For tDCS
experiments, the ‘tDCS’ period is defined as the entire period of tDCS (that is,
600 s). All data are expressed as mean±s.e.m. Time to Ca2 þ onset is defined as the
time where DF/F exceeded the mean þ 3 s.d. since the start of tDCS. Ca2 þ events
for individual cells were detected with a threshold of the mean þ 3 s.d. Ca2 þ events
of astrocytes in G7NG817 mice were detected after applying a low-pass filter
(cutoff frequency 0.5) to exclude possible neuronal signals from the contiguous
neurogliopil (Fig. 2e,g,k). Ca2 þ events of neurons in G7NG817 mice were detected
after applying a band-pass filter (bandpass: 0.5–3 Hz) to exclude possible astrocytic
signals from the contiguous neurogliopil (Fig. 2e–g,k). For the analysis of astrocyte-
Ca2 þ on versus off period (Fig. 2f), the ‘on’ period is defined as the period where at
least one astrocyte is detected for a Ca2 þ event.
Statistics. For comparisons of two sample means (Fig. 2c,e–g; Supplementary
Figs 3C,E,F,7D), two-sample t-tests and paired t-tests (Fig. 3d) were performed
using ORIGIN (OriginLab). For comparisons of multiple groups, statistical tests
based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) are performed followed by Tukey s post-
hoc tests. Two-way (Fig. 1g,i, and Fig. 4d-f) or one-way (Supplementary Fig. 10B)
repeated measures ANOVA was computed using R (http://www.r-project.org) with
a software add-on for ANOVA (ANOVAKUN, http://riseki.php.xdomain.jp/).
One-way ANOVA was computed using ORIGIN (Fig. 1l and Fig. 3b,f; and
Supplementary Fig. 8B). Unless otherwise noted, mean values are presented with
the s.e.m.
