IMPORTANCE As many as 60% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) experience psychosis,
80% develop dementia, and the use of antipsychotics (APs) in the population with PD is
common. The use of APs by patients with dementia in the general population is associated
with increased mortality, but whether this risk extends to patients with PD remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether AP use in patients with PD is associated with increased
mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective matched-cohort study used data
from a Veterans Health Administration database from fiscal years 1999 to 2010 to examine
the risk associated with AP use in a cohort of patients with idiopathic PD and recent stable
physical health. The rates of 180-day mortality were compared in 7877 patients initiating AP
therapy and 7877 patients who did not initiate AP therapy (matched for age ±2.5 years, sex,
race, index year, presence and duration of dementia, PD duration, delirium, hospitalization,
Charlson Comorbidity Index, and new nonpsychiatric medications). Data were analyzed from
October 19, 2012, to September 21, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality rates at 180 days in those patients who initiated
AP therapy compared with matched patients who did not use APs. Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used with intent-to-treat (ITT) and exposure-only analyses.
RESULTS The study population included 7877 matched pairs of patients with PD (65 women
[0.8%] and 7812 men [99.2%] in each cohort; mean [SD] age, 76.3 [7.7] years for those who
initiated AP therapy and 76.4 [7.6] years for those who did not). Antipsychotic use was
associated with more than twice the hazard ratio (HR) of death compared with nonuse (ITT
HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 2.08-2.66; P < .001). The HR was significantly higher for patients who used
typical vs atypical APs (ITT HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.24-1.91; P < .001). Among the atypical APs
used, HRs relative to nonuse of APs in descending order were 2.79 (95% CI, 1.97-3.96) for
olanzapine, 2.46 (95% CI, 1.94-3.12) for risperidone, and 2.16 (95% CI, 1.88-2.48) for
quetiapine fumarate.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of APs is associated with a significantly increased
mortality risk in patients with PD, after adjusting for measurable confounders. This finding
highlights the need for cautious use of APs in patients with PD. Future studies should examine
the role of nonpharmacologic strategies in managing psychosis in PD. In addition, new
pharmacologic treatments that do not increase mortality in patients with neurodegenerative
diseases need to be developed.

A
range of nonmotor symptoms, including psychosis and
dementia, are common in Parkinson disease (PD).1 Psy-
chosis occurs in as many as 60%2,3 and dementia in as
many as 80% of patients with long-term PD.4,5 Further, de-
mentia is a known correlate of psychosis in PD.6
Use of antipsychotics (APs) in PD is common. One study re-
ported that approximately one-third of patients with newly di-
agnosed PD were prescribed an AP within 7 years,7 and another
reporteda6-yearcumulativeprobabilityofinitiatingAPtreatment
at50%.8Inanexaminationofapproximately2600patientswith
PDandpsychosis(usingVeteransAffairs[VA]datafromfiscalyear
2008),9 50%wereprescribedanAPduringa1-yearperiod,with
dementia significantly associated with increased AP use.
In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a
public health advisory that the treatment of behavioral disor-
ders in elderly patients with dementia with atypical AP medi-
cations is associated with increased mortality.10 A similar US
Food and Drug Administration alert for typical APs followed
in2008,11withevidencethattypical(orconventional)APsmay
be more harmful than atypical APs for morbidity12 and
mortality.13 Since then, Kales et al14 have demonstrated a dif-
ferential risk among AP classes and specific APs.
Specific features of PD (eg, rigidity, gait and balance im-
pairment, orthostatic hypotension, dysphagia, and auto-
nomicsystemcardiacchanges)mayplacethesepatientsateven
higher risk of morbidity and mortality than patients with gen-
eral dementia. For example, patients with PD are already at a
nearly 3-fold increased risk for hip fracture owing to gait and
balance impairment.15
Little research has examined the risks associated with AP
use in PD. A study using Medicaid data16 found that the use of
quetiapine fumarate, risperidone, or olanzapine was associ-
ated with a higher rate of fracture in patients with a diagnosis
ofparkinsonism.AnotherstudyusingCanadianhealthcaread-
ministrativedata17compareddeceasedwithmatchedlivingpa-
tients with PD; the investigators found that individuals ex-
posedtoAPshadhigheroddsofdeathandthattypicalAPswere
associated with an increased odds of death compared with
atypical APs. However, the investigators could not control for
confounding by indication, and only 242 AP-treated patients
with PD were included.
Using methods similar to what Kales et al14,18 used to docu-
ment the increased risk for mortality associated with AP use in
patientswithgeneraldementia,weusednationalVAhealthsys-
tem administrative data to examine 180-day mortality risks as-
sociated with AP use in a large cohort of patients with PD. We
compared patients who initiated AP treatment (exposed) with
those who did not (unexposed) while controlling for a wide ar-
ray of potential confounding factors. We hypothesized that AP-
exposedpatientswithPDwouldhaveincreasedmortalitycom-
pared with matched non–AP-exposed patients with PD.
Methods
Study Design
This retrospective, matched-cohort study used VA data from
fiscal years 1999-2010. For every unique patient with PD who
filled a new AP prescription, we randomly selected 1 indi-
vidual from the risk set with replacement of matched non–
AP-exposed patients. Matching (as outlined below) was per-
formed to identify the day the exposed patient with PD filled
the AP prescription as a phantom start date for the non–AP-
exposed patients with PD so that the observation periods were
matched by calendar time and comparisons would be unaf-
fected by secular trends and other selection biases. We only
included the first new AP prescription for each unique pa-
tient, which was defined as no AP exposure in the prior 6
months, which was a matching factor. We used National Death
Index data19 to assess mortality. Typical APs included halo-
peridol, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, fluphenazine, loxap-
ine, mesoridazine besylate, molindone hydrochloride, per-
phenazine, thioridazine hydrochloride, thiothixene
hydrochloride,andtrifluoperazinehydrochloride;atypicalAPs
included olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole,
clozapine, and ziprasidone. This study was approved by the
VA Central institutional review board, which waived the need
for informed consent.
Participants
As in the VA research study of patients with PD, psychosis, and
dementia by Weintraub et al,9 patients with idiopathic PD were
identifiedusingcode332.0fromtheInternationalClassification
ofDiseases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModification(ICD-9-CM).Psy-
chosisdiagnosesincludedICD-9-CMcodes293.81,293.82,297.0,

298.8,298.9,368.16,and780.1;patientswithschizophreniaand
bipolar disorder were excluded. Because patients with PD con-
stituted the population of interest, patients with a diagnosis of
dementia with Lewy bodies ICD-9-CM code 331.82) were ex-
cluded. A patient was counted as having PD with dementia and
includedinthestudyifthedementiadiagnosisfollowedthePD
diagnosis by at least 1 year, to match the exclusion criteria for
dementia with Lewy bodies.20 Dementia diagnoses included

Key Points
Question Is an increased mortality risk associated with
antipsychotic (AP) use in Parkinson disease (PD)?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 7877 matched pairs
of veterans with PD, AP use was associated with more than twice
the hazard of death compared with nonuse. The hazard ratio was
significantly higher for typical compared with atypical AP use.
Meaning Because AP use is associated with significantly
increased mortality risk in patients with PD, this medication class
needs to be used cautiously in this population.

gency department visit within 14 days of the index new AP pre-
scription (to ensure medical stability); (4) AP exposure in the
preceding 180 days; (5) initiation of AP therapy before the PD
diagnosis; (6) younger than 50 years at initiation of AP therapy;
(7) more than 1 type of AP included on the same fill date; (8) a
diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective
disorder, or Huntington disease; and (9) an AP index prescrip-
tion that occurred during a nursing home or inpatient stay. For
every unique patient with PD who filled a new AP prescrip-
tion, the AP fill date was defined as the index date, and we con-
structed a risk set of matched patients not treated with APs on
the index date.
Matching Variables and Covariates
We matched patients by (1) age (±2.5 years); (2) sex; (3) race
(white, black, other, and unknown); (4) index year; (5) comor-
bid dementia diagnosis within the year before the index date;
(6) time from PD diagnosis to index date (±180 days); (7) de-
lirium diagnosis within the year before the index date; (8) hos-
pitalization in the prior year; (9) 3-category Charlson Comor-
bidity Index21 based on prior 1-year data (0, 1, or >1, where >1
could be >1 condition or a single condition with weighted score
>1; the following conditions were weighted [weight]: hepatic
failure [3], diabetes mellitus with complications [2], hemiple-
gia [2], chronic renal disease [2], malignant neoplasm [2], leu-
kemia [2], lymphomas [2], metastatic solid tumor [6], human
immunodeficiency virus without AIDS [2], and AIDS [6]); and
(10) prescription of new nonpsychiatric medications within 14
days before and including the index date, to help ensure medi-
cal stability. For patients with comorbid dementia, an addi-
tional matching variable was time from dementia diagnosis to
index date (±180 days), because longer duration of dementia
is associated with mortality. For patients without comorbid de-
mentia, additional matching variables were comorbid post-
traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse diagnoses due
to between-group differences in the distribution of these vari-
ables for patients without dementia.
Covariates included (1) marital status; (2) use of any new
psychiatric medications within 14 days before the index date;
(3) number of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric outpatient vis-
its within 180 days before the index date; (4) medication use
within the previous 1 year (separately for antidepressants, opi-
oids, benzodiazepines, and cholinesterase inhibitors); (5) psy-
chiatric diagnoses (separately for depression, other psycho-
ses, alcohol abuse, other drug abuse, posttraumatic stress
disorder, personality disorders, and other anxiety disorders);
(6) number of days in the hospital in the year before the index
date; (7) number of days in a nursing home in the year before
the index date; (8) having an outpatient visit with a neurolo-
gist for PD within the year before the index date; (9) indi-
vidual diseases from the Charlson Comorbidity Index21 (myo-
cardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular
disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease, rheumatologic disease, peptic ulcer disease, cir-
rhosis,hepaticfailure,diabetesmellituswithandwithoutcom-
plications, hemiplegia, chronic renal disease, malignant
neoplasm, leukemia, lymphomas, metastatic solid tumor, and
human immunodeficiency virus with and without AIDS); (10)
academic affiliation of the facility; (11) urban vs rural facility;
and (12) size of the facility. In subanalyses that include only
those patients with AP exposure, matching variables were also
entered as covariates.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from October 19, 2012, to September 21,
2015. We used intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and exposure-
only analysis approaches to measure the exposure period. For
the ITT analysis, exposure period for the initial exposure sta-
tus continued until 180 days after the index date (or the phan-
tom fill date for unexposed participants) or death, whichever
occurred first, regardless of any changes in exposure status (ie,
stopping or switching AP treatments for the AP-exposed group
or starting an AP treatment for the non–AP-exposed group).
In the exposure-only analysis, the exposure period contin-
ued until the end of 180 days or to the time of switch, stop, or
death, whichever occurred first.
Time to death since the index date was used to compare
mortality risks during the 180-day period by baseline AP treat-
ment status (exposed vs nonexposed), across baseline AP
classes, and across different APs. Cox proportional hazards re-
gression models stratified by the matched pairs using the ro-
bust sandwich estimate of Lin and Wei22 were used to adjust
for covariates and to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Com-
parisons across the different APs used only those patients ex-
posed to an AP on the index date. Covariate-adjusted sur-
vival function for an average patient in the cohort by baseline
AP exposure group was generated based on the predicted sur-
vival functions from the Cox proportional hazards regression
without accounting for matching.
Results
Characteristics of Study Cohort
The demographic characteristics of the 7877 matched pairs (65
women[0.8%]and7812men[99.2%]ineachcohort;mean[SD]
age,76.3[7.7]yearsforthosewhoinitiatedAPtherapyand76.4
[7.6] years for those who did not) are given in eTable 1 in the
Supplement. A total of 905 AP-exposed patients were not in-
cluded in the matched analyses because a matched non–AP-
exposed participant could not be found. For the analyses com-
paring mortality rates in patients with typical vs atypical AP
exposure, we included 8782 AP-exposed patients with or with-
out a matched unexposed participant. Despite matching, AP-
exposed and non–AP-exposed patients differed in a number
of characteristics measuring mental health, including psycho-
sesotherthanbipolardisorderorschizophrenia,alcoholabuse,
other drug abuse, other anxiety disorders, personality disor-
ders, and use of other psychiatric medications, so these vari-
ables were included as covariates in the models.

haloperidol (282 [3.6%] of all AP prescriptions) being the most
commonly prescribed typical AP. For atypical APs, the most
commonly prescribed medication was quetiapine (5270
[66.9%]), followed by risperidone (1155 [14.7%]), olanzapine
(837 [10.6%]), and other atypical APs (193 [2.5%]).
Unadjusted Mortality Rates by AP Class
and Specific Medication
For AP-exposed patients, the unadjusted mortality rates (per
100 person-years) in the ITT analysis were highest for halo-
peridol, followed by other typical APs, risperidone, olanza-
pine, and quetiapine. In the exposure-only analysis, the rates
were highest for haloperidol, followed by risperidone, other
typical APs, olanzapine, and quetiapine (Table 1).
Mortality Rates in AP-Exposed vs Non–AP-Exposed Groups
After we adjusted for covariates, AP-exposed patients had
greater than 2-fold higher hazards for mortality in the 180-
day period after AP exposure in the ITT and exposure-only
analyses compared with nonexposed patients (Table 2). This
finding applied to patients exposed to typical and atypical APs,
with an HR in the ITT analysis of 2.26 (95% CI, 1.98-2.57) in
atypical AP-exposed vs non–AP-exposed patients and an HR
intheexposure-onlyanalysisof3.65(95%CI,2.47-5.39)intypi-
cal AP-exposed vs non–AP-exposed patients. Survival prob-
ability graphs are presented for ITT analyses in the Figure and
for exposure-only analyses in the eFigure in the Supplement.
The HR was significantly higher for patients who used typical
vs atypical APs (ITT HR, 1.54; CI, 1.24-1.91; P < .001).
Because patients at imminent risk for mortality might be
prescribed an AP as part of palliative care, we ran additional
analyses excluding those patients who died within 4 weeks of
the index date (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Excluding those
patients who died within 4 weeks of the index date, the el-
evated mortality HR associated with AP exposure vs no expo-
sure (HR, 2.30; 95% CI, 2.01-2.64), for typical AP exposure vs
no exposure (HR, 3.98; 95% CI, 2.50-6.34), and atypical AP ex-
posure vs no exposure (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.90-2.55) were simi-
lar to the HRs presented for the entire cohort.
Mortality Risk by Specific AP
Increased mortality risk (compared with non–AP-exposed
patients) was seen, in descending order, with use of haloperi-
dol, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine (Table 3). These
results were seen for the ITT and exposure-only analyses.
When we ran similar additional analyses excluding those
patients who died within 4 weeks of the index data, an
elevated HR associated with AP exposure remained for halo-
peridol, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine specifically
(eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Relative AP-Related Mortality Risks
In a subanalysis that included AP-exposed patients only and
that used quetiapine exposure as a referent group (because
quetiapine is the most commonly prescribed AP in patients
with PD), increased mortality risks relative to quetiapine were
seen (in descending order) for haloperidol, other typical APs,
olanzapine, and risperidone (Table 4).
Causes of Death
The leading causes of death in AP-exposed and non–AP-
exposed patients (all causes of death in the ITT population) are
givenineTable4intheSupplement.Theleadingcauseofdeath
in AP-exposed patients was PD (listed in 443 of 832 [53.2%]
as a cause of death), 38% higher compared in non–AP-
exposedpatients(165of427[38.6%]).Theothercausesofdeath
that were listed in more than 10% of AP-exposed patients and
more common in this group vs non–AP-exposed patients were
influenzaorpneumonia(127of832[15.3%]vs57of427[13.3%])
and pneumonitis (85 of 832 [10.2%] vs 29 of 427 [6.8%]).
Discussion
Use of APs in patients with dementia is associated with an in-
creased risk for morbidity and mortality,10,12,13 with differen-
tial risk among AP classes and specific APs.12,14 Our results ex-
tend this increased mortality risk to patients with PD and
confirm preliminary research.17 We found a differential risk for

typical vs atypical APs and among the atypical APs. Of par-
ticular note, the increased risk is not specific to dementia in
this case because less than 10% of the patients studied herein
were diagnosed as having dementia.
Some differences between patients with general demen-
tiaandPDprecludegeneralization.First,patientswithPDhave
disease-related risk symptoms that may predispose them to
or overlap with AP-associated adverse events (eg, falls, seda-
tion, orthostatic hypotension, and parkinsonism). Second, the
APs studied in dementia clinical trials (risperidone and olanza-
pine) are different than the most commonly used AP in pa-
tientswithPD(quetiapine).Third,somegeneraldementiastud-
ies have enrolled patients with broadly defined agitation or
psychosis,whereasAPstudiesinPDhaveenrolledpatientswith
psychosis specifically. Finally, psychosis in PD has a higher
overall prevalence rate and presents differently than in gen-
eral dementia; psychosis in patients with PD is associated with
dopamine replacement therapy and is characterized by higher
rates of hallucinations and less frequent delusions.2,23
The HR for mortality associated with any AP exposure was
2.35 (95% CI, 2.08-2.66), indicating a 6-month mortality rate
135% higher in AP-exposed patients compared with non–AP-
exposed patients. Patients treated with a typical AP had an HR
62% higher than patients treated with an atypical AP. Given
that two-thirds of typical AP exposure in this cohort was for
haloperidol, this finding may suggest that APs that are potent
dopamine receptor antagonists or have a high ratio of dopa-
mine to serotonin receptor blocking24 pose the greatest risk
to patients with PD.
Approximately 30% of treated patients were prescribed a
high-potency AP (eg, risperidone, olanzapine, or haloperidol).
These APs are most likely to worsen parkinsonism and poten-
tially to increase mortality risks in patients with PD. Consis-
tently, mortality rates were higher for haloperidol, risperi-
done,andolanzapinecomparedwithlower-potencyquetiapine.
Approximately 70% of APs prescribed in PD were
quetiapine.9 Because no placebo-controlled studies demon-
strate quetiapine’
s efficacy for PD psychosis,25 clinicians of-
ten make it the first-line AP in PD based on clinical impres-
sions of effectiveness, good tolerability compared with other
APs, and complexities associated with use of the single AP ap-
proved by the US Food and Drug Administration that is effi-
cacious for this condition (ie, clozapine). The concept of rela-
tively good tolerability is supported by the finding that
quetiapine had a lower mortality rate compared with all other
commonly used APs, similar to what has been reported in pa-
tients with general dementia.26
We aimed to discern how AP exposure increases mortal-
ity in patients with PD. The most common cause of death in
AP-exposed patients and the second most common cause of
death in non–AP-exposed patients was PD, a nonspecific di-
agnosisintermsofdeterminingthedirectcauseofdeath.How-
ever, patients treated with an AP were 38% more likely to have
PD listed as their cause of death, and one possible explana-
tion is that AP exposure was associated with worsening par-
kinsonism that led to serious adverse events subsumed un-
der a diagnosis of PD.
Strengths of the research include our experience with
analyzing VA pharmacoepidemiologic data, the exposure-
matched design, the large sample size, and careful attention
to inclusion and exclusion criteria and covariates. Limita-
tions include our inability to verify the accuracy of medical
record diagnoses (eg, not having a PD diagnosis made by a
movement disorders neurologist, although a secondary
analysis restricting the analyses to patients seen by a neu-
rologist in the year before the index date yielded a similar
result (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.67-4.09; P < .001) and possible
confounding by indication despite the inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria, extensive matching, and inclusion of covariates

(ie, patients prescribed an AP may have had more severe PD
that predisposed to mortality, and we were unable to exam-
ine directly the severity of disease with this data set). As an
additional measure to account for this latter possibility, addi-
tional analyses that excluded those patients who died within
4 weeks of initiation of AP treatment still showed a similar,
elevated mortality HR associated with AP exposure in 180
days.
Future research should examine whether AP exposure is
also associated with excess morbidity, compare risks in pa-
tients with PD vs Alzheimer disease and dementia with Lewy
bodies,anddeterminewhetherclinicalanddemographicmod-
erators of mortality exist. The latter analyses will help to in-
form clinical care as clinicians weigh the potential benefits and
risksassociatedwithAPprescribingtopatientswithPD.Asnew
APs are introduced for PD psychosis, such as pimavanserin,27
whethertheyhaveadifferentmortalityandmorbidityriskpro-
file needs to be determined. If newer APs with significantly dif-
ferent mechanisms of action are not similarly associated with
increased mortality, this finding would more strongly impli-
cate existing APs as associated with the observed increased
mortality.
Conclusions
Given the more than 2-fold increased mortality risk during 6
months of AP exposure and limited evidence of their efficacy,
APs need to be used cautiously in patients with PD. Evalua-
tion for treatable comorbid medical conditions should be per-
formed, and attempts to decrease use of PD medications that
may contribute to psychosis should be considered.28 Off-
label use of APs (eg, for insomnia) should be discouraged.
Prescribing typical APs to patients with PD should be
avoided. Research efforts are needed to develop APs that are
efficacious but do not increase mortality risk in vulnerable
patients, to test cognition-enhancing medications for AP
properties (eg, cholinesterase inhibitors29,30), and to evaluate
structured nonpharmacologic approaches to manage psycho-
sis as has been done for behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer
disease.31-33 Given that the incidence of PD is increasing
worldwide and that psychosis is very common2 and distress-
ing to patients and caregivers,34 the development of
informed and improved treatment strategies for this condi-
tion remains a priority.
