 The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), a G protein-coupled receptor, plays a crucial role in human 
and mouse pigmentation1–8. Activation of MC1R in melanocytes by α-melanocyte-stimulating 
hormone (α-MSH)9 stimulates cAMP signaling and melanin production and enhances DNA repair 
after UV irradiation (UVR)10–16. Individuals carrying MC1R variants, especially those associated 
with red hair color, fair skin and poor tanning ability (RHC-variants), are associated with higher 
risk of melanoma5,17,18,19,20. However, how MC1R activity might be modulated by UV 
irradiation, why redheads are more prone to developing melanoma, and whether the activity of 
RHC variants might be restored for therapeutic benefit remain unresolved questions. Here we 
demonstrate a potential MC1R-targeted intervention strategy to rescue loss-of-function MC1R in 
MC1R RHC-variants for therapeutic benefit based on activating MC1R protein palmitoylation. 
Specifically, MC1R palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase (PAT) 
ZDHHC13, is essential for activating MC1R signaling that triggers increased pigmentation, UVB-
induced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and melanomagenesis in vitro and in 
vivo. Using C57BL/6J-MC1Re/eJ mice expressing MC1R RHC-variants we show that 
pharmacological activation of palmitoylation rescues the defects of MC1R RHC-variants and 
prevents melanomagenesis. The results highlight a central role for MC1R palmitoylation in 
pigmentation and protection against melanoma.
A preliminary small molecule screen to identify novel modulators of RHC-variant MC1R 
activity suggested that palmitic acid increased cAMP levels in human primary melanocytes 
with an endogenous MC1R R151C variant (HPM-RHC), or engineered RHC-variant B16 
melanoma cells (B16-RHC) in which MC1R R151C was reintroduced after deletion of the 
endogenous gene (MC1R reconstituted cells). To validate this result, HPM-RHC and B16-
RHC were serum starved, pretreated with α-MSH and exposed to one standard erythema 
dose of UVB (100 J/m2), before being treated with medium containing BSA-conjugated 
fatty acids for 3 h. Palmitic acid, but not other lipids, increased cAMP levels in both HPM-
RHC and B16-RHC (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a).
Since palmitic acid can induce palmitoylation of cysteine residues (Extended Data Fig. 1b) 
we treated cells with the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP (2-bromopalmitate). 2-BP 
prevented palmitic acid-induced cAMP levels in both HPM-RHC and B16-RHC (Fig. 1b, 
Extended Data Fig. 1c) as well as in WT B16 and HPMs, with the effect of palmitic acid 
being dependent on α-MSH and stimulated by UV irradiation (Extended Data Fig. 1d-e). 
Using an acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay in HPM-RHCs (Extended Data Fig. 1f), free 
cysteine thiol groups were irreversibly blocked by N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), palmitoylated 
cysteines exposed by hydroxylamine (HAM) and biotinylated. Labeled proteins pulled down 
using streptavidin-dynabeads were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) (Extended Data 
Fig. 1g) to reveal that MC1R is palmitoylated (Extended Data Fig. 1h), consistent with 
integral membrane proteins G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like MC1R9 being 
palmitoylated during activation. Palmitoylation site prediction (NBA-palm) analysis21 
highlighted MC1R Cysteines 78 and 315 as potential palmitoylation sites (Extended Data 
Fig. 1i-k).
Palmitoylation of both endogenous MC1R and exogenously expressed Flag-MC1R was 
confirmed using streptavidin to detect MC1R protein labeled using ABE following

 immunoprecipitation from B16 and HPMs stimulated with α-MSH (Fig. 1c-d, Extended 
Data Fig. 2a-b). The Flag-MC1R C78S mutant but not Flag-MC1R C315S was also 
palmitoylated (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2c), indicating that C315 is the major MC1R 
palmitoylation site.
Using MC1R reconstituted cells, in the presence of α-MSH both R151C and R160W MC1R 
variants exhibited reduced palmitoylation compared to WT (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 2d). 
Moreover, a C315S mutation in the context of the R151C variant completely blocked MC1R 
R151C palmitoylation, indicating Cys151 is not a neo-palmitoylation site (Extended Data 
Fig. 2e-f). Notably UVR-stimulated palmitoylation of endogenous MC1R and exogenously 
expressed Flag-MC1R (Fig. 1g-h, Extended Data Fig. 2g-h), but not the MC1R C315S 
mutant (Fig.1i, Extended Data Fig. 2i), whereas UVR-induced palmitoylation of the R151C 
and R160W RHC-variants was reduced compared to the WT protein (Fig. 1j-k and Extended 
Data Fig. 2j-m).
To identify which protein S-acyl transferases (PATs) were responsible for MC1R 
modification, 23 HA-tagged ZDHHC PATs22 were co-expressed with Flag-MC1R. 
Detectable MC1R palmitoylation was only observed following expression of ZDHHC2, 3, 7, 
13 and 17 (Extended Data Fig. 3a), with ZDHHC13 the most efficient (Fig. 2a). MC1R 
palmitoylation was substantially reduced in cells expressing a C456S mutant ZDHHC13 in 
which the enzymatic DQHC motif was mutated (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3b). Silencing 
ZDHHC13 diminished UVR-stimulated palmitoylation of WT MC1R (Fig. 2c, Extended 
Data Fig. 3c), as well as the R151C RHC variant (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3d), whereas 
ZDHHC13 overexpression activated MC1R R151C palmitoylation (Fig. 2d, Extended Data 
Fig. 3d-f). The MC1R C315S mutant was used as a negative control.
Interaction between ZDHHC13 and MC1R was detected by co-immunoprecipitation from 
α-MSH-treated HPMs and was enhanced by UVR (Fig. 2e), reflecting increased MC1R 
palmitoylation following UVR (Extended Data Fig. 3g-h). Interaction between the MC1R 
RHC R151C and R160W proteins and ZDHHC13 was also increased after UVR, but was 
much less than with WT MC1R (Fig. 2f).
Since ATR is a central effector of the UVB-response23,24 we asked if ATR-mediated 
phosphorylation of ZDHHC13 promoted MC1R palmitoylation following UV exposure. 
HPMs expressing HA-ZDHHC13 were irradiated with UVB and after anti-HA 
immunoprecipitation phosphorylation of ZDHHC13 was detected by with specific phospho-
S/T-Q antibody. The results revealed UVB treatment increased ZDHHC13 phosphorylation 
(Fig. 2g) and MC1R-ZDHHC13 interaction (Fig. 2h) that was substantially reduced in cells 
stably expressing shATR (Fig. 2i). Mutation of an evolutionarily conserved SQ site at Ser8 
(Extended Data Fig. 3i) prevented UVR-stimulated ZDHHC13 phosphorylation (Extended 
Data Fig. 3j) and ATR WT, but not a kinase-dead mutant, robustly phosphorylated 
recombinant WT ZDHHC13, but not the S8A mutant (Extended Data Fig. 3k). Compared to 
WT ZDHHC13, the S8A mutant only weakly interacted with MC1R (Extended Data Fig. 3l) 
and failed to enhance MC1R palmitoylation upon UVB irradiation (Extended Data Fig. 3m). 
Collectively these results suggest that ZDHHC13 phosphorylation by ATR following UVB 
irradiation promotes its interaction with MC1R to stimulate MC1R palmitoylation.

 To test whether MC1R palmitoylation regulates MC1R signaling10–16 cAMP levels were 
measured after UVB irradiation and α-MSH stimulation of MC1R reconstituted cells. 
Whereas WT MC1R significantly increased cAMP levels following UVR, the 
palmitoylation-deficient mutant C315S failed to do so, and RHC variants partially lost their 
ability to stimulate cAMP production (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The C315S mutant also 
failed to up-regulate microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and tyrosinase 
(TYR) mRNA expression (Extended Data Fig. 4b-c) downstream from MC1R signaling. 
The MC1R RHC variants only weakly activated MITF and TYR expression compared to 
WT, strongly suggesting that palmitoylation is essential for MC1R signaling.
To examine the role of MC1R palmitoylation in α-MSH/MC1R-regulated DNA repair, 
endogenous MC1R reconstituted HPMs and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and 6-4 
photoproducts (6-4 PPs) were measured following UVB exposure. Although WT MC1R 
promoted photoproduct clearance, the palmitoylation-defective C315S mutant, or the RHC 
variants failed to repair the lesions efficiently (Extended Data Fig. 4d).
Consistent with previous work25 silencing MC1R augments low dose UVB-induced 
premature senescence that was bypassed by reintroduction of WT MC1R (Extended Data 
Fig. 4e). The R151C and R160W RHC variants also exhibited a defective senescence bypass 
phenotype whereas the C315S mutant was ineffective (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Using 
engineered human immortal melanocytes (hTERT/p53DD/CDK4(R24C) melanocytes)25,26 
in colony formation and soft agar growth assays we found that BRAFV600E-mediated 
cellular transformation was suppressed by WT MC1R, but not the C315S mutant, while the 
R151C and R160W variants exhibited an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 3a, Extended Data 
Fig. 4g-k).
To examine its role in cAMP production, ZDHHC13 was silenced or overexpressed in 
MC1R reconstituted B16 cells and HPMs, and cAMP levels measured following UVB 
irradiation and α-MSH stimulation. ZDHHC13 overexpression increased cAMP levels in 
cells expressing WT MC1R and also rescued the defect in cAMP production in cells 
expressing the R151C variant (Extended Data Fig. 5a). ZDHHC13 overexpression increased 
MITF expression in WT cells and rescued the defect in α-MSH/MC1R RHC variant-
induced MITF up-regulation (Extended Data Fig. 5b). The palmitoylation defective C315S 
mutant was inactive irrespective of ZDHHC13 expression. ZDHHC13 overexpression 
enhanced UVR-induced DNA damage repair and rescued the defect in photoproduct 
clearance in melanocytes with the MC1R R151C variant, whereas ZDHHC13 depletion 
impaired repair (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Similarly, ZDHHC13 overexpression protected 
against UVB-induced premature senescence in melanocytes expressing WT and R151C 
MC1R, but not those expressing the C315S mutant, whereas shRNA depletion of ZDHHC13 
enhanced senescence in cells expressing WT or R151C MC1R (Extended Data Fig. 5d).
Soft agar and colony formation assays using the human hTERT/p53DD/CDK4(R24C) 
melanocytes25,26 revealed that ZDHHC13 depletion increased transformation by 
BRAFV600E in the presence of WT MC1R, whereas enhanced transformation by the R151C 
mutant was suppressed by ZDHHC13 overexpression (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 5e). 
Elevated transformation in the presence of the C315S mutant was unaffected by ZDHHC13

 overexpression/depletion. Subcutaneous xenograft tumor assays also indicated that 
ZDHHC13 overexpression inhibits MC1R R151C-augmented BRAFV600E–induced 
malignant transformation (Fig. 3c-e).
We next used MC1R loss-of-function (C57BL/6J-MC1Re/eJ) mice, backcrossed to C57BL/6 
for more than 24 generations, to generate transgenics re-expressing melanocyte-specific WT, 
RHC variant and C315S mutant MC1R (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Unlike previous transgenic 
MC1R RHC mice developed by Healy et al3 using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC), 
our MC1RR151C variant offspring show a mosaic coat color that could arise as a 
consequence of the promoter used, integration site, or mouse strain background. Our other 
RHC-variants exhibited a paler coat color than WT (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 6b). All 
mice are at generation F26 or later with stable fur phenotypes and exhibit similar expression 
levels of the human transgenic MC1R mRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 6c). The MC1R R151C 
variant mice also exhibit higher skin pheomelanin/eumelanin ratios than WT mice (Fig. 4b). 
Strikingly, the palmitoylation-deficient MC1R C315S-espressing mice showed a similar coat 
color and skin pheomelanin content to the C57BL/6J-MC1Re/eJ mice (Fig. 4b, Extended 
Data Fig. 6b), with no significant difference in number/distribution/location of melanocytes 
detected in mice with MC1R+/+, MC1Re/e, MC1RR151C and MC1RC315S (Extended Data 
Fig. 6d-e).
Tyr-Cre-BRAFCA mice (B6.Cg-Braftm1Mmcm Tg(Tyr-cre/ERT2)13Bos/BosJ)27 were next 
crossed to the MC1Re/e, MC1R+/+, MC1RR151C and MC1RC315S mice and BRAFV600E 
expression induced by tamoxifen administration. After UVB irradiation each week for four 
weeks (Extended Data Fig. 5f) melanomas developed early and frequently in MC1R loss-of-
function (e/e) or palmitoylation-defective MC1R transgenic (C315S) mice, much later with 
WT MC1R mice, and at an intermediate time with the MC1R R151C variant (Fig. 4c). All 
melanomas diagnosed displayed similar morphological and histologic features (Extended 
Data Fig. 6g).
To explore whether MC1R palmitoylation is dynamic, we removed α-MSH from the culture 
medium and found that palmitoylation disappeared within 12 h, while Palm-B, a deacylating 
enzyme inhibitor28,29, blocked both WT and R151C MC1R depalmitoylation (Extended 
Data Fig. 7a), suggesting that Palm-B enhances MC1R palmitoylation. Treatment of 
endogenous MC1R reconstituted B16 cells with Palm-B, together with α-MSH and UVB 
irradiation, increased MC1R R151C palmitoylation to levels detected for the WT protein, 
whereas no palmitoylation was observed using the C315S mutant irrespective of Palm-B 
administration (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Using HPMs or B16 cells reconstituted with WT or 
variant MC1R, Palm-B moderately increased α-MSH-induced cAMP production, but 
dramatically increased signaling from the R151C variant to levels comparable to those 
observed from α-MSH-stimulated WT MC1R in the absence of Palm-B (Extended Data Fig. 
7c). Signaling downstream from the R151C variant, as well as WT MC1R, was functional 
since both MITF and TYR mRNA expression were upregulated by Palm-B (Extended Data 
Fig. 7d-e). Palm-B also accelerated clearance of UVR-induced photoproducts in 
melanocytes with the MC1R R151C variant (Extended Data Fig. 7f). By performing ABE 
on extracts from mouse skin irradiated with UVB we confirmed that Palm-B administration 
to mice increased MC1R palmitoylation in MC1RR151C and MC1R+/+ in vivo (Extended

 Data Fig. 7g). Following UVB treatment, both CPD and 6-4pp DNA lesions were 
significantly higher in R151C mice than in WT mice, with Palm-B reducing the levels of 
damage detected in both (Extended Data Fig. 7h-i). Notably, Palm-B also repressed low-
dose UVB-induced premature senescence in HPMs or B16 cells reconstituted with the 
MC1R R151C variant (Extended Data Fig. 7j). Using human immortal hTERT/p53DD/
CDK4(R24C) melanocytes Palm-B largely reversed the increased colony formation 
observed using the R151C variant (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 7k) and in xenograft studies, 
Palm-B inhibited MC1R R151C-augmented BRAFV600E melanomagenesis (Fig. 4e-g). 
Importantly, Palm-B had no effect in any assay using the C315S mutant.
Finally, to confirm the preventive effect of Palm-B in melanomagenesis in redheads, Tyr-
Cre-BRAFCA-MC1Re/e-MC1RR151C mice were UVB irradiated each week for four weeks, 
with 10 mg/kg Palm-B injected intraperitoneally into Tyr-Cre-BRAFCA-MC1Re/e-
MC1RR151C mice prior to the treatment with UV. While no strong side effects were 
observed, in Palm-B treated mice melanomagenesis was substantially delayed and the 
incidence reduced (Fig. 4h). Similar results were obtained using Palm-B and the MC1R 
R160W variant (Extended Data Fig. 8). Collectively our results highlight a central role for 
MC1R palmitoylation in protecting against melanoma, and suggest that rescuing MC1R 
palmitoylation by up-regulation of ZDHHC13 or inhibition of depalmitoylation might be a 
potential clinical prevention strategy for melanoma in redheads.
Methods
Cell Lines, Animals and UV Exposure
Cell lines and UV exposure were as described previously2,25,30. All cell lines were 
authenticated and mycoplasma negative. Briefly, cells were washed by PBS twice before 
UVB irradiation. For the in vitro UV experiments, cells were exposed to ultraviolet radiation 
in the Stratalinker UV chamber (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX, USA) with UVB bulbs (UVP 
LLC, Upland, CA, USA). UV emittance was measured with the use of a UV photometer 
(UVP LLC, Upland, CA, USA)30. Adherent cells were irradiated through a small volume of 
PBS at a dose of 100 J/m2. A UVB dose of 100 J/m2 is equivalent to one standard erythema 
dose of UVB (SED), commonly used as a measurement of sunlight. As a reference, the 
ambient exposure over an entire sunny summer day in Europe (Switzerland) is 
approximately 30-40 SED31. Human primary melanocytes were isolated from normal 
discarded foreskins as described before32,33 and were cultured in Medium 254 (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). In all assays, cells were pretreated with α-MSH 
(1 μM) for 30 min following with 100 J/m2 UVB irradiation, and collected 3 h after UVB 
exposure. Palm B was used at 1 μM.
The maximal tumor size is 20 mm at the largest diameter, which was permitted by IACUC 
of Boston University Medical Campus. None of the experiments exceeded the limit. Mice 
were maintained in specific-pathogen-free facility of Animal Science Center (ASC) of 
Boston University Medical Campus, and the experiments were performed according to the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Boston University Medical Campus. Mice 
were housed on a time cycle of 12 h of light (beginning at 6:00 AM) and 12 h of dark 
(beginning at 6:00 PM). Mice were allowed free access to an irradiated diet and sterilized

 water. The mice were monitored daily for signs of health status and distress. Mice with age 
from 8 weeks to 6 months were used for breeding and pregnant female will be placed in a 
new cage. Mice were weaned at 20 - 21 days of age. DNA was extracted from the mouse tail 
biopsy for genotyping. NCr nude mice (female, 8-10 weeks) were purchased from Taconic 
Biosciences. C57BL/6J-MC1Re/eJ (The Jackson Laboratory, Stock No: 000060) 
homozygous mice were crossed with Tyr-Cre-BRAFCA mice (B6.Cg-Braftm1Mmcm Tg(Tyr-
cre/ERT2)13Bos/BosJ) (The Jackson Laboratory, Stock No: 017837) homozygous mice to 
generate Tyr-Cre-BRAFCA-MC1R+/e heterozygous mice, which were crossed to generate the 
age-matched C57BL/6J-Tyr-Cre-BRAFCA-MC1R+/+ mice and C57BL/6J-Tyr-Cre-
BRAFCA-MC1Re/e for experiments. All these mice are genotyped according to The Jackson 
Laboratory’s protocol. All mice are with stable fur phenotypes at generation F26 or later.
Transgenic mice were designed to express melanocyte-specific MC1R RHC-variant 
(controlled by the Tyr enhancer/promoter) and generated by Boston University School of 
Medicine Transgenic and Genome Engineering Core. The expression construct was designed 
such that the MC1R gene was inserted downstream of the murine tyrosinase locus control 
region. Each construct was injected into single-cell embryos of C57BL/6J-MC1Re/eJ mice. 
The transgene was detected by genotyping mice tail DNA using the primers targeting 
fragment across Tyr promoter and MC1R region (~1200 bp, forward 5′- 
GGGCTATGTACAAACTCCAAGA′-3, reverse 5′-ACACTTAAAGCGCGTGCACCGC-
′3). The expression levels of human transgene were determined as described3. Briefly, total 
RNA was collected from primary melanocytes isolated from neonatal transgenic mouse 
skins using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A sequential DNA remove was 
performed by DNA-free™ DNA Removal Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, 
USA) to avoid genomic DNA contamination. Reverse transcription was carried out with 
random primers. Primers were used as previously described7 to amplify both the mouse and 
human MC1R. A following extension was performed using primer as previously described3 
by adding ddTTP (mouse MC1R) or ddCTP (human MC1R) (SNaPshot Multiplex Kit, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Extension products were separated by capillary 
electrophoresis and quantified by measuring human/mouse MC1R ratio. Mice underwent 
tamoxifen treatment to express BRAFV600E in melanocytes. Briefly, mice at 3 weeks of age 
were administered with tamoxifen (T5648) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in corn oil 
daily by intraperitoneal injection at 0.12 mg/g body weight for 5 consecutive days. The 
control mice will get plain corn oil injection. Mouse UV exposure procedure was performed 
as described previously30. Briefly, a UVB dose of 500 J/m2 was used. This does is 
equivalent to one minimum erythema dose of UVB (MED) and 5 standard erythema doses 
of UVB (SED), commonly used as a measurement of sunlight in vivo.

B16 and HPMs, mouse or human specific short hairpin RNAs in pLKO.1 against MC1R or 
ZDHHC13 were co-transfected with psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene, 
#12259) in HEK293-FT (ATCC) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., 
Waltham, MA, USA). Lentiviruses were collected after 48 h, and then infected cells for 24 h 
in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/mL) and the infected cells were selected with puromycine 
(2 μg/mL). To generate cells with stable expression of MC1R variants or HA-ZDHHC13, 
HEK293T cells were co-transfected with MC1R variants or HA-ZDHHC13 in pQCXIP, 
VSV-G and pUMVC (Addgene #8449) plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000. Retroviruses 
were harvested after 48 h and cells were infected with retroviruses in the presence of 
polybrene (8 μg/mL). After 24 h, cells were selected with puromycine (2 μg/mL). shRNA

 Acyl-biotin exchange palmitoylation assay
Briefly, cells were lysed by lysis buffer (1% IGEPAL CA-630, 50mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 
150mM NaCl 10% Glycerol and protease inhibitor) with 50 mM N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) 
(Sigma-Aldrich) and endogenous MC1R or Flag-MC1R is then purified by specific 
antibodies and beads. Purified MC1R protein were divided into two groups, and one treated 
with lysis buffer + 1 M hydroxylamine (HAM) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr at room 
temperature. Finally, the beads were gently washed by lysis buffer pH 6.2 and incubated 
with lysis buffer pH 6.2 + 2 μM Biotin-BMCC (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) for 1 hr at 
4 °C. Proteins were washed 3 times and proceeded for IB analysis.
Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry protein identification was performed by the Taplin Biological Mass 
Spectrometry Facility, Harvard Medical School. Protein samples were mixed with sample 
buffer and heated at 100 ℃ for 5 min, then loaded to SDS-PAGE for separation. When 
running was finished, gel was immersed within staining solution (0.3 % Coomassie Brilliant 
Blue, 45 % Methanol, 10 % Glacial acetic acid and 45 % dH2O) and placed on shaker for 30 
min. Gel was destained in destaining solution (20% Methanol, 10% Glacial acetic acid, 70% 
dH2O) on shaker for overnight. Finally, bands on gel were excised and sent to Taplin 
Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility for mass spectrometry protein identification.
Immunoassay
DNA damage immunoassay was performed using the anti-CPD (MC-062) and anti-6-4 PPs 
(KTM-50) antibodies. Briefly, the heat-denatured genomic DNA were coated onto the 
microplate wells with Pierce DNA Coating Solution (17250) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., 
Waltham, MA, USA). After washing and blocking by PBS with the purified anti-mouse IgG 
mAb of 2 μg/mL, the specific antibodies of anti-CPD (MC-062) and anti-6-4 PPs (KTM-50) 
were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer and added to each well. Optical density at 405 nm 
was determined. Intracellular cAMP levels were measured by cAMP Direct Immunoassay 
Kit (ab65355) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) following manufacture’s protocols, optical 
density at 450 nm was determined. For cAMP measurement with fatty acid treatment, fatty 
acids were dissolved in 100% ethanol (250 mM) mixed with 25 mM BSA and added to 
serum-free DMEM/medium 254 at a final concentration of 500 μM. Cells were serum 
starved for 6 h. For the last 30 min cells were incubated with 1 μM α-MSH, followed by 100 
J/m2 UVB treatment. Lastly cells were treated with indicated BSA-conjugated fatty acid 
medium for 3 h with or without 2-BP (25 μM). All results are calculated by three 
independent experiments.
Real-Time qPCR
The cDNA (40 ng) was used for quantitative PCR amplification with SYBR green PCR 
master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The relative levels of 
expression of genes were normalized according to those of GAPDH. Quantitative real-time 
PCR (qRT-PCR) data were calculated using the comparative Ct method. All quantitative 
PCR were performed in triplicates, and three independent RNA samples were assayed for

Immunohistochemistry
Mouse melanomas were fixed in 10% formalin solution at 4°C overnight, paraffin-embedded 
and then cut in 5 μm-thick sections (Dermpath core facility, Boston University). Sections 
were then deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with anti-S-100 (Dako North America, 
Inc. Carpinteria, CA, USA) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Briefly, for antigen 
retrieval, sections were heated in a boiling water bath in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 
6.0) for 20 min prior to immunostaining. Nonspecific staining was blocked by pre-
incubation with Tris Buffered Saline (TBS)/0.1% Tween-20/5% normal goat serum (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Tissue sections were incubated with the 
primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, and were subsequently incubated with secondary 
antibodies and detected with DAB substrate (Dako EnVision + System HRP, Dako) 
following manufacturer’s instructions. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with 
permanent mounting medium. All images were taken with Olympus Inverted microscope 
(Cellular imaging core, Boston University).
Pigment measurement
Eumelanin were and pheomelanin were quantified by HPLC based on the level of 
pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA) by alkaline hydrogen peroxide oxidation of 
eumelanin and 4-amino-3-hydroxyphenylalanine (4-AHP) by hydriodic acid reductive 
hydrolysis of pheomelanin, respectively. Final results were determined by a conversion as 
described (eumelanin=45×PTCA, peomelanin=9×4-AHP)35. All results are calculated by 
three independent experiments.
Clonogenic Survival and Soft Agar Assays
The clonogenic survival and soft agar assays for hTERT/p53DD/CDK4(R24C)/BRAFV600E 
melanocytes were performed as described previously26. Briefly, for the melanocyte growth

 promoting withdrawal experiments, hTERT/p53DD/CDK4(R24C)/BRAFV600E melanocytes 
were treated with 20 J/m2 UVB in the presence of 1 μM α-MSH before plating into 6-well 
plate at 1,000 cells per well, and then subject to clonogenic survival assays 15 days after 
UVR. Crystal violet was used to stain colonies. DMEM media was used with 10% FBS and 
penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. For soft agar assays, cells (10,000 per well) were seeded 
in 0.5% low-melting-point agarose in DMEM with 10% FBS, layered onto 0.8% agarose in 
DMEM/10% FBS. The plates were kept in the cell culture incubator for 30 days after which 
the colonies >50 μm were counted under a light microscope. All results are calculated by 
three independent experiments.
In vivo Tumorigenesis Assay
In vivo tumorigenesis assay of hTERT/p53DD/CDK4(R24C)/BRAFV600E melanocytes was 
performed as described previously26. Briefly, 3×106 melanocytes were mixed with matrigel 
(1:1) and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of male nude mice. Tumor size was 
measured every 3 days with a caliper, and the tumor volume was determined. Three weeks 
after inoculation, the tumors were dissected to measure their weights.
Statistical Analyses
All quantitative data were presented as the mean ± SD or ± SEM of at least three 
independent experiments by Student’s t test for between group differences and analysis of 
variance for comparisons among three or more groups (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001).

harvested for IP, ABE and IB analysis 3 h after UVB exposure.
(c) B16 and HPMs with stable depletion of MC1R by shRNA were infected with the 
indicated Flag-MC1R encoding retroviral constructs. Cells were pre-treated with 1 μM α-
MSH and 1 μM Palm-B for 30 min followed by 100 J/m2 UVB irradiation. After 3 h, cells 
were harvested for cAMP immunoassay. These data were compiled from three independent 
experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SD.
(d-e) B16 and HPMs with stable depletion of MC1R by shRNA were infected with the 
indicated Flag-MC1R encoding retroviral constructs. Cells were pre-treated with 1 μM α-
MSH and 1 μM Palm-B for 30 min followed by 100 J/m2 UVB irradiation. After 3 h, total 
RNA were collected for reverse transcription and cDNA were then used for qRT-PCR by 
specific primers targeting mouse and/or human MITF or TYR. Three independent 
experiments were quantified. Data are represented as mean ± SD.
(f) HPMs with stable depletion of MC1R by shRNA were infected with the indicated Flag-
MC1R encoding retro-viral constructs. Cells were pre-treated with 1 μM α-MSH and 1 μM 
Palm-B for 30 min followed by 100 J/m2 UVB irradiation. Genomic DNA were extracted at 
the different time points indicated and photoproducts were detected by ELISA. Cyclobutane 
pyrimidine dimer (CPD) or 6–4 pyrimidine photoproduct (6–4PP) antibodies were used. 
Three independent experiments were measured and calculated as mean ± SD.
(g) C57BL/6 mice or C57BL/6-MC1Re/e-MC1RR151C-tg mice were given a 10 mg/kg Palm-
B or vehicle injection intraperitoneally 3 h before UVB irradiation (500 J/m2). 3 h after 
UVB, whole skins were collected and the lysates were subjected for IP, ABE and IB 
analysis.
(h-i) C57BL/6 mice or C57BL/6-MC1Re/e-MC1RR151C-tg mouse were injected 
intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg Palm-B 3 h before UVB irradiation (500 J/m2). Melanocytes 
were isolated by flow cytometry, then DNA were extracted and subjected to ELISA 3 h after 
UVB irradiation. Results were calculated as mean ± SD from three independent 
experiments.
(j) B16 with stable depletion of MC1R by shRNA were infected with the indicated Flag-
MC1R encoding retroviral constructs. Cells were pre-treated with 1 μM α-MSH and 1 μM 
Palm-B for 30 min followed by 25 J/m2 UVB irradiation. Cells were subjected to SA-β-gal 
staining assay 7 days after UVR. The quantification of the percentage of SA-β-gal positive 
cells and representative pictures are shown. Data shown correspond to one representative 
experiment out of three independent experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SD.
(k) The cells generated as indicated were seeded (10,000 cells per well) in 0.5% low-
melting-point agarose in DMEM with 10% FBS, layered onto 0.8% agarose in DMEM+10% 
FBS. The plates were cultured for 30 days where upon the colonies >50 μm were counted 
under a light microscope. Colony numbers were plotted as mean ± SD from three 
independent experiments.
