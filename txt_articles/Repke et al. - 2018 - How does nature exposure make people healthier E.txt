Abstract
Nature exposure has been linked to a plethora of health benefits, but the mechanism for this
effect is not well understood. We conducted two studies to test a new model linking the
health benefits of nature exposure to reduced impulsivity in decision-making (as measured
by delay discounting) via psychologically expanding space perception. In study 1 we col-
lected a nationwide U.S. sample (n = 609) to determine whether nature exposure was pre-
dictive of health outcomes and whether impulsive decision-making mediated the effect.
Results indicated that Nature Accessibility and Nature Exposure From Home significantly
predicted reduced scores on the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS) (p < .001, p =
.03, respectively) and improved general health and wellbeing (p < .001, p < .01, respec-
tively). Nature Accessibility also predicted reduced impulsive decision-making (p < .01), and
Nature Accessibility showed significant indirect effects through impulsive decision-making
on both the DASS (p = .02) and general health and wellbeing (p = .04). In Study 2, a lab-
based paradigm found that nature exposure expanded space perception (p < .001), and
while the indirect effect of nature exposure through space perception on impulsive decision-
making did not meet conventional standards of significance (p < .10), the pattern was con-
sistent with hypotheses. This combination of ecologically-valid and experimental methods
offers promising support for an impulsivity-focused model explaining the nature-health
relationship.
Introduction
Human history evolved around an intimate connection to the natural environment (e.g., see
[1,2]). This has changed dramatically over the last century. The recent shift to over half of the
world’s population living in urban areas [3] together with advancements in technology (e.g.,
see [4,5]) has drastically reduced the amount of time many people spend in contact with
nature. This separation of humans from nature may not be inconsequential. A growing body

 of research is dedicated to exploring how interactions with the natural environment affect
human health and wellbeing [6]. To date, researchers have demonstrated that humans gain a
plethora of health and wellbeing benefits from nature exposure. Here, we present two studies
that test a new theory linking the health benefits of nature exposure to reduced impulsivity via
psychologically expanding space perception.
Nature exposure and human health
A wealth of evidence exists linking nature exposure to improved health outcomes. From
reduced recovery time following surgery [7] to reduced Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disor-
der symptomology in children (e.g., [8–12]), health improvements in patients with cancer
(e.g., increased expression of anti cancer proteins [13]) and cardiovascular disease (e.g., reduc-
tion of hypertension [14,15]) and many other outcomes–the abundance of evidence for this
effect is striking. While much of the research exploring the effects of nature exposure has
focused on psychological effects (see e.g., [16–19]), there is also considerable research linking
nature exposure to improved physiological health markers. For example, exposure to nature
images has been linked to decreased oxyhemoglobin concentrations (which is believed to be
associated with psychological calming) in the right prefrontal cortex [20], and favorable
changes in heart rate variability [21]. Physiological effects have also been observed in studies
testing the effects of various nature exposure therapies (for review of such studies conducted in
Japan see [22]). In addition to effects associated with viewing nature scenes or participating in
nature exposure therapy, research has also found evidence in favor of positive physiological
effects of basic environmental exposure. For example, sunlight has been linked to vitamin D
production, release of nitric oxide, production of beta-endorphin, and regulation of circadian
rhythms [23].
Further, research has revealed nature not only improves a wide array of health and wellbe-
ing outcomes, but that both experimentally manipulated increases in nature exposure (e.g.
[15]) and nature exposure resulting from living and/or working within proximity to ample
natural space (e.g., [24–26]) can have these impacts on health. Given this wealth of evidence
linking nature exposure to human health and wellbeing, some researchers have shifted from
asking whether nature exposure improves health, to asking how nature exposure improves
health.
Possible mechanisms
Before researchers had rigorously evaluated the effects of nature exposure, there was the
“nature benefit assumption”[27]. This term captures the intuitive belief many held prior to
recent decades–that nature exposure was generally good for humans. However, it was not
until Wilson’s biophilia theory [28], which stated that humans have evolved to respond posi-
tively to unthreatening natural environments, that rigorous scientific inquiry began. Since the
emergence of this theory, researchers have turned their attention to understanding the specific
nature of these positive responses. As a result, a substantial body of research now confirms the
basic tenet of the nature benefit assumption. With evidence that nature exposure predicts posi-
tive outcomes for humans, researchers have increasingly shifted to asking how it is that nature
affects humans to bring about so many positive outcomes. As a result of this collective inquiry,
evidence has been found in support of a variety of possible mechanisms underlying the posi-
tive effects of nature exposure. While many potential pathways have been studied (e.g. see
[29,30] for reviews), much attention has been paid to restoration, social consequences, and
physical activity as potential underlying mechanisms.

 Restoration.
Early research into the mediators of the nature exposure-health and wellness
relationship revealed evidence that natural environments facilitate physiological, emotional
and attention restoration [31]. From this line of research, two complementary theories have
spawned: Stress Reduction Theory [32] and Attention Restoration Theory (ART [33]). ART
posits that nature exposure encourages effortless brain function, which facilitates its recovery
from fatigue. SRT focuses on the role of affect. In particular, SRT suggests that exposure to nat-
ural environments facilitates positively-toned emotional reactions, which in turn have a restor-
ative effect.
Although suggesting somewhat different routes to restoration, both theories emphasize that
nature is psychologically restorative. And, consistent with this, the restorative quality of nature
has been identified as a mediator of the effects of nature exposure on a variety health and well-
being outcomes, including emotional wellbeing (see e.g., [34]) and mental health (see e.g.,
[35]).
Social consequences.
Others have considered social consequences as a potential mecha-
nism underlying the health and wellbeing effects of nature exposure. This endeavor has
revealed evidence suggesting nature exposure increases social cohesion [36], as defined by For-
rest and Kerns [37] to refer to sense of community, shared norms and values, positive and
friendly relationships, and feelings of being accepted and belonging. Similarly, research has
also found nature exposure enhances social connections [38] and social contacts [39]. Further,
there is evidence suggesting increased nature exposure predicts reduced feelings of loneliness
and decreased frequency of feelings of inadequate social support, and that reduced loneliness
and decreased feelings of inadequate social support in turn improve self-reported health, a
number of health complaints, and mental health [35].
Physical activity.
Finally, others have considered the possibility that nature encourages
physical activity. Evidence has shown that nature increases engagement in physical activity
[40,41], and that “green exercise” (physical activity that occurs while being directly exposed to
nature) improves health and wellbeing outcomes [42]. Although there is evidence in its favor,
in a comparison of these three potential mechanisms (restoration, social cohesion, and physi-
cal activity) conducted by de Vries and colleagues [36], support was stronger for restoration
and social cohesion as mechanisms than physical activity.
The present investigation–while acknowledging that the mechanisms discussed above play
an important role in understanding how nature improves health and wellbeing–seeks to con-
sider the role of another potentially important variable not directly addressed by restoration,
social cohesion or physical activity: impulsive decision-making. The role of decision-making
in predicting health and wellbeing outcomes is extremely important. Lifestyle factors such as
diet, exercise habits, sleep routines, and stress management are largely the result of decision-
making processes, and are critical predictors of health and wellbeing. Therefore, the present
study does not seek to undermine existing theories regarding the underlying mechanism(s) for
the health and wellbeing benefits of nature exposure, but rather further explores an alternate,
and potentially complementary emerging hypothesis: that nature exposure improves decision-
making, and that decision-making in turn improves health and wellbeing outcomes. As deci-
sion-making related to health can often be conceptualized as the choice between a more impul-
sive option (e.g., eating unhealthy food for dinner because it is faster and easier to prepare)
and a less impulsive option (e.g., spending more time and energy making a healthy dinner
from scratch), the present study will focus specifically on impulsive decision-making.
Importantly, impulsive decision-making may provide additional insight into the drivers of
the effects of nature exposure on health, beyond what has been learned from prior research
related to underlying mechanisms. Most notably, research on impulsive decision-making and
restoration-related process such as stress (e.g., [43,44]) and fatigue (e.g., [45,46]) has found

 mixed results, suggesting that there is value in considering impulsive decision-making as a dis-
tinct process from restoration. This is not surprising because the processes, while potentially
overlapping, are conceptually distinct. For example, one may feel restored but still choose to
eat unhealthy food–indeed, research on positive emotion more broadly suggests that it can
sometimes make people more susceptible to immediate cues [47]. By focusing on impulsive
decision-making in the present investigation, we seek to directly study the effects of nature on
such decision-making processes.
Impulsivity and impulsive decision-making.
Impulsive decision-making has been iden-
tified as one component of the broader construct of impulsivity–a construct that has been
defined through multiple psychological lenses. As noted by Evenden [48], impulsivity has been
defined as both a character trait related to quick decision-making [49], a set of actions leading
to poor outcomes [48], or as a choice to prefer smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed
rewards [50]. Given this diversity regarding how impulsivity ought to be defined, many have
argued that impulsivity is actually comprised of multiple distinct factors (see e.g., [48,51].
Research by Broos and colleagues [51] into these potential factors found evidence for three dis-
tinct aspects of impulsivity: self-reported impulsivity, impulsive action, and impulsive choice.
Impulsive choice, also referred to as impulsive decision-making, is a behavioral aspect of
impulsivity that is associated with the preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger
delayed rewards. A common measure of impulsive decision-making is delay discounting,
which can be defined as the decrease in value of an outcome or reward with the increase in
delay until its receipt [52]. An impulsive choice within a delay-discounting paradigm can be
operationalized as the choice of a smaller sooner (e.g., receiving $10 today) over larger later
reward (e.g., receiving $50 in one month). Degree of delay discounting is predictive of a host
of specific behaviors and health outcomes including smoking, obesity, alcohol use, exercise fre-
quency, and expected longevity (see e.g., [53–56]). Importantly, impulsive decision-making in
the form of precipitous delay discounting has been implicated as a partial cause of costly
chronic illness and premature death in the US (e.g., lack of exercise/physical activity, poor diet,
tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption; e.g., [57–64]). Researchers have speculated
that delay discounting is the most important laboratory predictor of real world health-related
behaviors currently available [65].
Nature exposure and impulsive decision-making.
In addition to the abundance of
research linking impulsive decision-making in delay discounting to health, Van der Wal,
Schade, Krabbendam, and van Vugt [66], and Berry and colleagues [67,68] have also found
evidence linking exposure to nature images to reduced impulsivity in delay discounting tasks.
Taken together, this prior research connecting nature to impulsive decision-making and
impulsive decision-making to health outcomes provides evidence for a model that impulsive
decision-making mediates the nature–health relationship. However, despite this evidence con-
necting nature exposure to impulsive decision-making and impulsive decision-making to
health in separate studies, no prior work has simultaneously tested the links between nature
exposure, delay discounting and health in the same study. While prior research has suggested
a link between nature exposure and increased self-discipline [69], research suggests self-disci-
pline and impulsive decision-making should not be considered synonymous constructs (see
e.g., [70,71]).
Understanding how nature might affect health via impulsive decision-making represents a
potentially important and largely unexplored mechanism for determining nature’s beneficial
effects on personal and societal-level health and wellbeing, and may offer insight into targeted
nature interventions for broader public health benefits. Therefore, the present investigation
explores the role of impulsive decision-making as measured by delay discounting to better
understand a mechanism determining how nature improves health by potentially reducing

 unhealthy impulsive decision-making. Study 1 considers impulsive decision-making as a pos-
sible mechanism underlying the effect of nature exposure on health. Study 2 then considers
whether an expansion of space perception might be the underlying mechanism driving
nature’s effect on impulsive decision-making.
Study 1
While prior research provides evidence that nature exposure reduces impulsive decision-mak-
ing, and separately, that reduced impulsivity in decision-making leads to improved health out-
comes, a formal evaluation of the nature!impulsive decision-making!health path has not
been conducted. Therefore, Study 1 addresses this gap by evaluating the importance of impul-
sive decision-making in the nature–health relationship. To do so, we test the degree that
nature’s relationship with health is indirectly carried through impulsivity using standard meth-
ods [72,73]. Using a sample of participants from across the United States, we hypothesized
that: (1) increased nature exposure would predict improved health outcomes, (2) increased
nature exposure would predict reduced impulsivity in decision-making, (3) reduced impulsive
decision-making would predict improved health outcomes, and (4) there would be an indirect
effect of nature on health through impulsive decision-making.
Study 1 methods
Participants.
Six hundred and nine participants were recruited through Mechanical Turk.
Participation was limited to US residents aged 18 or over. Of the 609 participants, 60% were
female. The mean age was 36.39 years (SD = 12.08). The University of Montana Institutional
Review Board approved all procedures.
Procedure.
Participants began by reading the informed consent. Following agreeing to
participate in the study, participants completed all measures and responded to basic demo-
graphic questions. All experimental data collection was programmed via Qualtrics (Provo,
Utah).
Study 1 measures
Nature exposure.
Participants responded to thirteen questions assessing the degree to
which they are exposed to nature in their daily lives. A principal component analysis using a
Varimax rotation with Kaiser Normalization was performed on all items assessing nature
exposure. Components with eigenvalues greater than or equal to 1 were retained. Three mea-
sures of nature exposure were identified through this process and are referred to as Nature
Exposure From Home, Nature Accessibility, and Presence of Blue Space. The first component
(Nature Exposure from Home) contained items related to the nature visible from one’s home,
access to a yard with green elements (e.g., grass, trees, etc.), and assessments of the degree that
one’s neighborhood contains green elements (n = 6, α = .90). The second component (Nature
Accessibility) contained items assessing the prevalence of parks or other pleasant natural fea-
tures nearby, the amount of time one spends outdoors, and how safe one feels being outdoors
in the area around where they live (n = 5, α = .73). Finally, the third component (Presence of
Blue Space) contained one item assessing whether one had access to a yard with a blue element
(e.g., pond, creek, etc.) and another item measuring how one’s neighborhood compared to
areas in presence of blue elements (n = 2, α = .65). Items were developed by research team and
are similar to methods used in prior research (e.g. [74,75]). See S1 Appendix for list of items.
Geospatial nature proximity.
In addition to the self-report items, we also quantified the
natural land cover surrounding respondents’ home addresses using remotely sensed data,
aggregated at three nested scales. Respondents were asked to provide their home address in an

 optional response item (61% of participants reported some portion of an address, ranging
from street address to zip code). Addresses provided were geocoded using ESRI ArcMap
10.3.1. Natural land cover in the vicinity of address locations was assessed using the National
Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), a spatially explicit raster database with 30-m resolution depicting
land cover and land cover change for the United States [76]. In this dataset, land cover is classi-
fied into 16 categories based on spectral signature and post-processing analysis, including:
open water, perennial ice/snow, developed (4 categories), barren land, forest (3 categories),
grassland/herbaceous, shrub/scrub, pasture/hay, cultivated crops, and wetlands (2 categories).
We considered ‘natural land cover’ to be any 30-m raster cell classified as water, perennial ice/
snow, grassland/herbaceous, shrub/scrub, pasture/hay, cultivated crops, and any forest or wet-
land. Percent natural land cover was calculated as the number of natural land cover cells
divided by total cells within three nested spatial scales: immediate vicinity, neighborhood, and
broader locality. Immediate vicinity was operationalized as any cell within 90m of respondents’
home address (participants who only provided a zip code were excluded from this level of
analysis). Neighborhood and broader locality were operationalized as the Census block and
County intersected by respondent’s home address, respectively.
Six variables resulted from this process, which we will refer to as: (1) Immediate Vicinity
Green, (2) Neighborhood Green, (3) Broader Locality Green, (4) Immediate Vicinity Blue, (5)
Neighborhood Blue, and (6) Broader Locality Blue. The ‘green’ items were all positively corre-
lated and therefore combined into a summary variable, Geospatial Green Proximity (α = .72).
The ‘blue’ items were not sufficiently correlated with one another, and therefore considered as
separate variables for analyses.
Health measures.
Participants completed two health measures: (1) The Depression Anxi-
ety Stress Scales, or DASS [77] (DASS scores were reverse-coded during analysis, resulting in
higher scores reflecting increased mental health), and (2) items designed to measure general
health and wellbeing (derived from prior research [78]; α = .88).
Impulsive decision-making measure.
To measure degree of impulsive decision-making,
participants completed a delay-discounting task using hypothetical monetary outcomes. Par-
ticipants responded to a series of questions asking “Would you rather have [amount of
money] now, or [amount of money] in [delay]?” (see [79] for a detailed description of the
descending fixed order delay discounting task). Participants chose either the immediate or
delayed option. Immediate amounts were presented in a fixed descending order ($100, $99,
$95, $90, $85, $80, $70, $60, $50, $40, $30, $20, $15, $10, $5, and $1). The delayed amount was
constant at $100. All aforementioned values were presented at each delay (delays included 1
day, 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years).
Impulsive decision-making was quantified using Area Under the Curve (AUC; [80]). AUC
is derived from normalizing the indifference points in the fixed sequence procedure, which are
defined as the last immediate amount chosen at each delay, as well as normalizing the delays
(see [80]). AUC scores range from 0 to 1, with higher numbers representing less impulsivity in
decision-making (i.e., more willingness to wait for delayed, but larger outcomes), and lower
numbers representing more impulsive decision-making.
Covariates.
Participants were also asked to report their highest level of education achieved
and household income as indicators of socioeconomic status.
Study 1 results
Nature exposure on health.
A series of simple linear regression analyses were initially
used to test for an association between nature exposure and health. In all cases, to test for the
additive impact of the variable above and beyond demographic factors, we further performed

 hierarchical regression where education and income were entered in Block 1 and the predictor
of interest was entered in Block 2.
First, Nature Accessibility was significantly associated with improved mental health (β =
.24, t[549] = 5.84 p < .001) and general health and wellbeing (β = .26, t[560] = 6.24, p < .001).
Each of these effects showed the unique predictive value of Nature Accessibility when educa-
tion and income were entered in Block 1 in hierarchical regression (R2 change p’s < .001).
Similarly, Nature Exposure From Home was found to be significantly associated with
improved mental health (β = .10, t[547] = 2.30, p = .02) and general health and wellbeing (β =
.12, t[557] = 2.80, p < .01). Each of these effects showed the unique predictive value of Nature
Exposure from Home when education was entered as a covariate in Block 1 in hierarchical
regression (R2 change p’s < .05), while similar analysis using income as a covariate revealed
non-significant added effects of Nature Exposure from Home (R2 change p = .15, R2 change
p = .13, respectively). Finally, Presence of Blue Space (i.e., greater blue space) was associated
with a marginally lower mental health scores, although this relation was not statistically signifi-
cant (β = -.08, t[564] = -1.90, p = .06). Presence of Blue Space was not found to be associated
with general health (β = .02, t[574] = .46, p = .64). See Table 1.
Nature exposure on impulsive decision-making.
Consistent with expectations, Nature
Accessibility was significantly associated with reduced impulsivity in decision-making (β =
.11, t[587] = 2.63, p < .01). The effect of Nature Accessibility when education and income were
entered in Block 1 in hierarchical regression was not significant, though in the expected direc-
tion (R2 change p = .06). Neither Nature Exposure From Home or Presence of Blue Space were
significantly associated with impulsivity in decision-making (β = .02, t[584] = .36, p = .72; β =
-.03, t[603] = -.70, p = .48).
Geospatial nature proximity.
A series of simple linear regression analyses were used to
test for an association between geospatial nature proximity and health. Inconsistent with
expectations, none of the measures of geospatial nature proximity were associated with mental
health or general health and wellbeing: Geospatial Green Proximity (β = .01, t[352] = .26, p =
.79; β = -.03, t[356] = -.57, p = .57), Immediate Vicinity–Blue (β = .04, t[215] = .54, p = .59; β =
-.02, t[213] = -.34, p = .73), Neighborhood–Blue (β = .05, t[352] = .90, p = .37; β = -.01, t[356] =
-.12, p = .90), and Broader Locality–Blue (β = -.04, t[352] = -.79, p = .43; β = .00, t[356] = -.02,

 p = .99). Similarly, none of the measures of geospatial nature proximity were associated
with impulsivity in decision-making: Geospatial Green Proximity (β = -.01, t[370] = -.14, p =
.89), Immediate Vicinity–Blue (β = -.04, t[370] = -.61, p = .54), Neighborhood–Blue (β = -.06,

to the implications of these findings in the discussion. See Table A in S1 Appendix for correla-
tions for all Study 1 variables.
Indirect effect nature exposure on health via impulsivity.
A Sobel test [81] was con-
ducted to determine whether there was an indirect effect of Nature Accessibility on health via
impulsive decision-making. Sobel tests are used to test the significance of indirect effects, and
in this case examined whether there was an indirect effect of Nature Accessibility on health via
impulsive decision-making. Findings were consistent with expectations, as results revealed a
significant indirect effect for both measures of health (mental health: z = 2.29, p = .02; general
health and wellbeing: z = 2.02, p = .04). See Fig A in S1 Appendix for graphs.
Study 1 discussion
Results from Study 1 include two key findings. First, the results demonstrate that greater
nature exposure in the form of nature visible from home and the accessibility of nature in
one’s area is associated with health benefits (and that this effect generally occurs above and
beyond income and education level, as indicated by hierarchical regressions accounting for
those demographic factors). And second, that part of the effect of nature accessibility on health
is accounted for via indirect effects through impulsive decision-making. Specifically, these
results indicate that a greater degree of nature accessibility is associated with less impulsivity in
decision-making, and that less impulsivity in decision-making in turn is linked to improved
health. These findings both replicate prior research related to the health benefits of living in
proximity to nature, as well as extend our scientific understanding of the relationship between
nature and health by providing promising evidence that impulsive decision-making may act
as an underlying mechanism of the relationship for certain aspects of the nature–health
relationship.
This result is especially impressive given the psychological distance between the impulsive
decision-making measurement and our measurements of nature and health. The impulsive
decision-making measurement pertained to hypothetical monetary amounts and thus was not
directly related to either nature or health. It is in fact compelling support for our guiding the-
ory that persons who report merely subjectively experiencing more access to nature show
reduced impulsive choice on a measurement not related to nature. Given the ecological valid-
ity of measuring nature exposure in this way, these results suggest a fairly pervasive link
between the degree of nature accessibility in the area around where one lives and reduced
impulsive decision-making and improved health outcomes.
Finally, while the geospatial nature proximity measures did not produce results consistent
with expectations, this was a relatively imprecise measure of nature exposure compared to the
self-report items. Where the self-report items directly measured participants’ own experiences
of nature in their daily lives, the geospatial analysis estimated this experience using low-resolu-
tion land cover data based on the area where one lives. Indeed recent research by Singh, Mad-
den, Gray, and Meentemeyer [82] highlights an important shortcoming of using the NLCD for
research on developed areas. However, regardless of the quality of the measures associated
with the NLCD, these results did not directly support expectations. Some prior research using
mapping technology has also failed to find an association between access to green space and
wellbeing (see e.g., [83]). Future research should further explore differences between self-
reported access to nature and the use of geospatial mapping technology to ascertain rates of

 nature exposure. While evidence suggests some geospatial mapping technologies may be better
than others [82] at accurately measuring nature exposure in some areas (at least in the US), it
is also possible that what matters more to outcomes such as wellbeing is one’s perception of
nature exposure (which would be captured more accurately via self-report methods). Overall,
more research is needed on this topic.
Study 2
Background
In Study 1, we found evidence for an indirect effect of nature exposure on health via impulsive
decision-making. The relationship between impulsive decision-making and health is well-
established in prior research; but less is known about nature’s impulsivity-reducing effect.
Therefore, Study 2 focused on the mechanism driving how nature might influence impulsive
decision-making. Prior research has found that time perception may not only be important in
understanding changes in impulsive decision-making, but also that it may be influenced by
exposure to natural environments [68]. However, despite these connections it has yet to be
tested as a possible mechanism of the nature exposure–impulsive decision-making relation-
ship. Further, time perception is one of many possible sensory experiences that might relate to
both impulsivity and health. To help fill in these gaps, Study 2 tested (a) whether time percep-
tion might help explain changes in impulsive decision-making, and (b) whether another
related sensory construct–space perception–might help explain changes in impulsive decision-
making.
Time, impulsive decision-making, and nature. Given the ostensible importance of time
in understanding impulsive decision-making, prior research has considered how various
aspects of time might relate to impulsive decision-making. Evidence has been found that mod-
ification of temporal attention to be presently biased [84], episodic future thinking [85], and
expanded time perception (e.g., [68,86]) all reduce impulsive decision-making. Of particular
interest to the present investigation is the finding related to expanded time perception, as
nature exposure has also been found to expand perception of time [68,87].
Space expansion: The overlap of time and space.
Although research ties nature exposure
to expansion of time, there is little research on the link between nature and perceptual expan-
sion at a broader level. Yet it may be that fundamental characteristics of nature contribute to
natural environments eliciting expansiveness in ways that go beyond time perception. For
example, natural environments may be more likely on average to prime a sense of vast scale
than non-natural environments and as such, contribute to perceptual expansion. To the degree
that this is true, it may be that perceptual expansion might matter in more general ways.
Therefore, Study 2 also considered a second variable related to perceptual expansion; the per-
ception of space.
Given their common conceptual overlap, it is unsurprising that time perception and space
perception are linked. Not only have studies linked perceptions of time and space under a vari-
ety of conditions, but a look at everyday language also suggests these constructs do not operate
independent from one another. Many studies have considered the psychological linkage of
space and time (for a review of this literature and a discussion of the neurological overlap of
perceptions of space and perceptions of time, see [88]). In sum, there is an abundance of evi-
dence that suggests human perception of space and perception of time are overlapping con-
structs (see e.g., [89–93]).
Further indicators of the association between space and time can be found in the linguistic
overlap of terms describing time and space frequently used in everyday conversation. For
instance, is it is common to hear time described using spatial terms or in an interchangeable

 way (e.g. ‘the end of the term is approaching’ or ‘short meeting’). This use of spatial language
to refer to time is due to a richer perceptual experience humans have for matters of space.
Many believe the reason for this is an intimate linkage of spatial and temporal representations
in the mind (see e.g., [94–101]).
Given the psychological overlap of space and time, and the evidence for time perception’s
role in predicting impulsive decision-making, it follows that space might provide useful insight
into impulsive decision-making behavior. Further, the richer reasoning capabilities humans
have for matters of space over time [102], and the tendency to conceptualize time in terms of
space [103] offers reason to believe space may actually be a more efficacious variable than time
for understanding impulsive decision-making. Despite these connections, however, investiga-
tions to date have not included inquiries into the possible predictive power of space perception
in relation to impulsive decision-making.
Study 2 aimed to fill this gap by considering whether changes in either perception of time
or perception of space were predictive of changes in impulsive decision-making, and whether
there was a significant indirect effect of nature exposure on impulsive decision-making via
either of these constructs.
Study 2 hypotheses.
Study 2 considered whether exposure to nature might have a similar
expanding effect on perceptions of space (as has been found with time), and whether there is
evidence for an indirect effect of nature on impulsive decision-making via perception of time
and/or perception of space. Specifically, this study used a nature exposure manipulation and
delay discounting outcome measure to test: (1) the effect of nature exposure on time percep-
tion and space perception, (2) the effect of time perception and space perception on impulsive
decision-making, and (3) time perception and space perception as possible mechanisms of the
nature–impulsive decision-making relationship. We hypothesized that: (1) nature exposure
would expand perceptions of time and space, (2) as time and space are perceived to be more
expansive, impulsive decision-making would be reduced, and (3) the nature exposure-impul-
sive decision making relationship would be partially carried through both time perception and
space perception.
Study 2 methods
Participants.
Sixty-six undergraduate students were recruited from undergraduate psy-
chology courses. Participants provided written informed consent and received course credit
for their participation. The University of Montana Institutional Review Board approved all
experimental procedures.
Setting and apparatus.
Participants completed the study alone in a small, quiet room.
Four testing rooms were used. Each of the rooms was identical in size (115” x 64”) and layout,
and each room contained two computers, two chairs, and a desk. Participants were asked to
leave their personal belongings in a separate space to ensure engagement with the study and
reduce distractions. Participants sat in front of a computer viewing images, reading prompts,
and responding to questions that utilized E-Prime 2.0 and Qualtrics software.
Stimuli.
Stimuli for the present study included images of nature scenes (e.g. lakes, for-
ests, mountains) and images of built scenes (e.g., buildings, cities, roads). The built images
served as a control condition for comparison to the nature scenes. These images have been
used in previous investigations of attention restoration and delay discounting behavior (e.g.
[66,67,104]).
Procedure.
All experimental procedures were identical across natural and built conditions
with the exception of the condition-specific photographs viewed. Participants were randomly
assigned to either the nature condition or built condition. In each condition, participants

 viewed a series of images (each image was displayed for 10 seconds), based on their assigned
condition both before and during the delay-discounting task (described in detail below). Prior
to beginning the delay discounting task participants viewed 25 randomly presented condition-
specific photographs. Between each delay block of the delay-discounting task, participants
viewed 5 randomly presented condition-specific photographs selected from the original 25.
Following completion of the delay-discounting task, participants responded to six questions
related to perception of space and time, as well as demographic items.
Delay discounting task. To measure degree of impulsive decision-making, participants
completed a delay-discounting task involving the choice between a fewer number of days of
improved air quality now, versus a greater number of days of improved air quality after a
range of delays (see [105] for a detailed description of the task). Participants used the computer
mouse to select either a smaller air quality improvement immediately, or a larger air quality
improvement after a delay. The immediate amount increased or decreased based on the partic-
ipant’s response as previously described (see [79,106] for detailed descriptions of the titration
procedure). Delays tested were 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 25 years
in that order. Impulsive decision-making was quantified using the same Area Under the Curve
(AUC; [80]) analysis described in Study 1.
Perception of space.
Participants were asked three questions designed by the research
team to assess their perception of space. For the first space perception item, participants were
asked to picture themselves immersed in the images they saw on the screen during the study
and rate how the space around them felt (on a 1–10 scale [1 –constricted, 10 –expanded]). For
the second space perception item, participants were asked to close their eyes for a couple
moments and then rate how the space around them felt (on a 1–10 scale [1 –constricted, 10 –
expanded]). Results from these two self-report space perception items were significantly posi-
tively correlated and were consequently combined into a two-item summary scale (α = .46) for
analysis.
Lastly, an exploratory item was developed with the goal of gaining insight into participant’s
perception of space without asking about it directly. This third space perception item asked
participants to use a blank piece of paper and pen (identical paper and pen were provided to
each participant by the researcher) to draw a ‘medium-sized circle’ from which the circle area
was then calculated.
Perception of time.
Three questions designed by the research team (and similar to meth-
ods used in prior research [68,87]) were used to assess participant perception of time: (1) How
quickly has time seemed to pass since you first arrived and signed the informed consent?
(response scale: 1 –time moved really slowly to 10 –time moved really fast), (2) How many
minutes would you estimate have elapsed since you signed the informed consent?, and (3)
Consider how time feels at this moment (response scale: 1 –time feels constricted to 10 –time
feels expanded).
Responses to the two Likert-scale items were positively correlated, while the minute esti-
mate of elapsed time was negatively correlated with both Likert-scale items. Due to the correla-
tion between the items, they were combined into a three-item summary scale (α = .58) for
analysis (the minute estimate time perception item was reverse coded prior to combination).
Study 2 results
Of the 66 participants, 57% were female. The mean age was 23.62 years (SD = 7.79). Chi square
(sex, race) and a t test (age) comparing demographics across natural and built conditions indi-
cated no significant differences across groups for these variables (sex, p = .451; race, p = 1.00;
age, p = .63).

 Main effect of nature exposure on perception of space.
Consistent with expectations, an
independent samples t-test revealed a significant main effect of nature exposure on space per-
ception, such that those exposed to nature images were more likely to report that the space
around them felt expanded (M = 6.19, SD = 2.09) than those who viewed images of built scenes
(M = 4.27, SD = 1.76), t(64) = 3.99, p < .001, d = 0.99. Also, given the exploratory nature of the
circle-area item and its lack of significant correlation to other space items it was not included
in the summary variable. However, the exclusion of this item does not change the pattern of
results presented here: Testing a summary variable including the circle-area item also results
in a statistically significant effect of condition on perception of space, t(64) = 2.33, p = .023,
d = 0.57. See Table B in S1 Appendix for correlations between all space items.
Main effect of space perception on impulsive decision-making.
A simple linear regres-
sion analysis was conducted to determine if space perception significantly predicted impulsive
decision-making. Consistent with expectations, expanded space perception significantly pre-
dicted less impulsivity in decision-making, β = .31, t(1,63) = 2.57, p = .01.
Main effect of nature exposure on perception of time. An independent samples t-test
revealed the main effect of condition on the time perception summary variable was not statisti-
cally significant, though it was in the expected direction. Those exposed to nature were some-
what more likely to report that time felt as though it was moving fast/expanded and that fewer
minutes had elapsed than those exposed to built images, t(63) = 1.70, p = .09, d = 0.42.
Main effect of time perception on impulsive decision-making.
A simple linear regres-
sion analysis was conducted to determine if time perception predicted changes in impulsive
decision-making. Results approached statistical significance (β = .19, t[62] = 1.51, p = .14),
such that increasingly expanded/lengthened time perception predicted reduced impulsive
decision-making.
Analysis of the indirect effect of nature on impulsive decision-making through space
perception.
Given analysis of time perception did not reveal effects achieving conventional
levels of statistical significance, only space perception was considered as a possible mechanism
of the nature–impulsive decision-making relationship. Prior to conducting indirect effect anal-
ysis, an independent samples t-test was used to first establish the presence of a main effect of
nature exposure on impulsive decision-making as measured by AUC (results of the discount-
ing portion of this investigation are reported separately in Berry, Repke, & Conway [107]).
Finally, a Sobel test [81] was conducted to determine whether there was an indirect effect of
nature on impulsive decision-making via space perception. Findings were somewhat consis-
tent with expectations, though a significant indirect effect was not found, z = -1.66, p < .10.
See Fig C in S1 Appendix for graph.
Perception of space—Perception of time relationship.
While no hypothesis was made
regarding the nature of the relationship of the perception of space and perception of time out-
come measures, a correlation analysis was conducted for completeness. Summary variables of
time and space perception were not found to be significantly correlated, r = .14, p = .27. Fur-
thermore, additional analysis considering only items using the same response scale of ‘con-
stricted’ to ‘expanded’ across the two domains were not found to be significantly correlated.
Study 2 discussion
Overall, these results offer support for the framework under consideration: Nature exposure
significantly predicted expanded space perception, and expanded space perception signifi-
cantly predicted decreased impulsive decision-making. Support of the indirect effect of the
nature on impulsive decision-making relationship via space perception was generally consis-
tent with hypotheses, but somewhat weaker. These findings lend support to the broader theory

 underlying this investigation. They further suggest that humans’ superior perceptual abilities
for spatial over temporal matters combined with the psychological relatedness of these con-
structs makes space perception an important variable in understanding and predicting impul-
sive decision-making.
General discussion
The present studies are the first to offer evidence for the tenability of a model of nature’s
health-boosting effects that focuses on impulsivity and perceptual expansion. Several impor-
tant findings emerged. First, Study 1 provides evidence that the health benefits linked to nature
exposure are partially explained by a reduction in impulsive decision-making. Second, Study 2
demonstrated that the effects of exposure to nature on decreased impulsive decision-making
might be partially explained by expanded space perception. Taken together, these results spe-
cifically suggest nature exposure might expand space perception, which in turn may reduce
impulsive decision-making, and that this reduction in impulsive decision-making might
improve health outcomes.
The results of this study extend previous research by linking the indirect effects of nature
exposure on health via impulsive decision-making and of nature exposure on impulsive deci-
sion-making via expanded space perception. These results may have important implications
for our understanding of the effects of nature exposure on health outcomes by suggesting that
with increased exposure to nature, impulsive decision-making, which might lead to stress, anx-
iety, depression, and reductions in overall wellbeing, might be reduced.
Second, these results are also the first to provide support for the involvement of space per-
ception in the nature exposure–impulsive decision-making relationship presented in Study 2.
Based on prior research, we considered time expansion to be an important variable in under-
standing the relationship between nature exposure and impulsive decision-making [68]. From
there, we constructed a theory that since prior research in other contexts had linked the con-
cepts of time and space, that space perception may be an important predictor of impulsive
decision-making above and beyond time perception. This hypothesis was influenced by the
idea that humans are more easily able to perceive matters related to space rather than time
[108], so therefore we theorized that nature exposure was prompting a psychological expan-
sion that was not isolated to time (and for which space perception might actually more acutely
register).
The data from Study 2 suggest that we must qualify some of the assumptions on which this
model was based. For instance, it is possible that exposure to nature influences perception of
space differentially than perception of time such that even if nature exposure led to expanded
perceptions of space and time, the reasons for these effects should not be considered equal, nor
should the effects themselves be considered interchangeable (from a theoretical perspective).
While this would not lessen the importance of the present findings, it would challenge the the-
oretical grounding presented here based on the overlap between space and time perception.
Future research should be conducted to consider how perception of space and perception of
time may or may not be related in their interactions with nature exposure and impulsive deci-
sion-making. Similarly, additional research should also test other assumptions such as poten-
tial other means for accessing psychological expansion beyond perception of space and time.
Limitations
As with all studies, limitations exist. While the present investigation focused specifically on a
mechanism (impulsive decision-making) potentially underlying how nature exposure might
influence health via changes to health behaviors, health behaviors were not directly measured

 in this investigation. Further research testing the merits of the model presented here should
include assessment of health behaviors rather than only self-reported health outcomes. Addi-
tionally, both of these studies were conducted on U.S. samples. Given that socioeconomic sta-
tus has been linked to both health and impulsive decision-making, findings presented here
should be considered within the context of a population that is more educated and wealthy, on
average, than most others.
Further, the present studies were based on a causal mediational model, yet Study 1
employed a non-experimental design that does not allow for direct causal tests. The obvious
drawback of this decision is the disconnect between the causal nature of the theoretical
model and the non-causal nature of the study design. Indeed, it is important at a larger level
to distinguish between the theoretical model–which is based on a mediational approach that
assumes causality–and the statistical tests themselves. No statistical test of mediation can
directly test the causal path assumed in a mediational model [109], and thus as with any such
mediational model, caution is warranted. However, there are also benefits to the dual
approach used here across Studies 1 and 2, which had complementary strengths and weak-
nesses. The non-experimental design of Study 1 allowed for a more ecologically-valid test of
the effects of nature exposure–by looking at how natural environments in real-world contexts
are actually related to health–compared to an experimentally manipulated environment. Fur-
ther, in Study 1 we found an association between nature exposure and impulsive decision-
making, which we replicated using an experimental design in Study 2. Indeed, the effects of
Nature Exposure in Study 2 are more easily interpreted as causal, due to the randomized
nature of the experimental design. Through the combined use of these different methods, we
have demonstrated that this effect is likely to be both ecologically-valid and consistent with
our hypothesized casual theory. But of course, more research is necessary to more completely
validate the causal nature of this design; at this point, it is consistent with our causal media-
tional model, but it is possible that other possible explanations might yet also account for the
found effects.
Finally, the present results were based on a model suggesting the effects of nature exposure
on health are serially mediated through perceptual expansion and impulsive decision-making.
Despite the evidence generally in favor of this model with regards to space perception, this
entire model itself was not directly tested in the same sample. Future research assessing the
role of impulsive decision-making and space perception as mechanisms of the nature expo-
sure–health relationship should include a test of all of these constructs in a single design. The
evidence presented here indeed suggests that impulsive decision-making acts as an underlying
mechanism of the nature exposure–health relationship, and that space perception might act as
an underlying mechanism of the nature exposure–impulsive decision-making relationship.
Yet from these studies, we are not able to draw firm conclusions on how impulsive decision-
making and space perception may interact with one another to predict health outcomes. Thus,
these studies provide important evidence for many of the pieces of an emerging model, and
future research would do well to test these pieces simultaneously.
Conclusion
Prior research has linked a vast array of health effects to nature exposure. The present investi-
gation sought to understand more about how nature might influence so many health outcomes
by considering possible meditators underlying these effects. Using a combination of experi-
mental and non-experimental methods, the studies presented here not only consider new
mediators of these effects, but also lend further credence to the hypothesis that nature exposure
plays a critical role in human health and wellbeing.

 Future research on the health benefits of nature exposure and the underlying mechanism(s)
stands to be theoretically as well as substantively important. As the evidence for the benefits of
nature exposure in daily life mounts, additional opportunities for application are revealed in
many fields including urban planning (e.g. [110]) and architecture/design both at home and in
the workplace (e.g. [111]). These findings not only add to the abundance of evidence for this
effect, but also demonstrate the diverse applications to many aspects of human life.
Finally, nature exposure may not only have important consequences for how humans treat
themselves, but also how they treat nature (e.g. [112]). As our species is increasingly threatened
by both anthropogenic climate change and epidemic levels of declining wellness, it is more
important than ever to identify opportunities that ameliorate the effects of each as efficiently
and effectively as possible. If simple nature exposure can simultaneously improve how humans
choose to sustain their own health and wellbeing along with the health and wellbeing of the
natural environment, it represents a unique and exceedingly important opportunity for
researchers and society alike.
