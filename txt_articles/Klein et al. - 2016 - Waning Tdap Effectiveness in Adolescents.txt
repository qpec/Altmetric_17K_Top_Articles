Waning Tdap Effectiveness 
in Adolescents
Nicola P. Klein, MD, PhD, Joan Bartlett, MPH, MPP, Bruce Fireman, MA, Roger Baxter, MD
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Because the effectiveness of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis 
(DTaP) vaccine wanes substantially after the fifth dose at ages 4 to 6 years, there is a 
growing cohort of adolescents who rely on tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and 
acellular pertussis (Tdap) for protection against pertussis. Yet despite high Tdap vaccine 
coverage among adolescents, California experienced large pertussis outbreaks in 2010 
and 2014. We investigated Tdap vaccine effectiveness (VE) and waning within Kaiser 
Permanente Northern California among adolescents exclusively vaccinated with DTaP 
vaccines.
METHODS: We modeled pertussis risk in relation to Tdap vaccination status among adolescents 
beginning on their 10th birthday. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for each subsequent 
year after Tdap compared with unvaccinated adolescents by using Cox regression, adjusting 
for calendar time, age, gender, race, and facility. We calculated VE as 1 − HR. We also treated 
time since Tdap vaccination as a continuous variable and estimated the change in the HR 
per 1-year increase since vaccination.
RESULTS: On the basis of 1207 pertussis cases, Tdap VE during the first year after vaccination 
was 68.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59.7% to 75.9%), decreasing to 8.9% (95% CI 
–30.6% to 36.4%) by ≥4 years after vaccination. Adolescents who were more remote from 
Tdap were significantly more likely to test positive for pertussis than were those vaccinated 
more recently (HR per year 1.35, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Routine Tdap did not prevent pertussis outbreaks. Among adolescents who 
have only received DTaP vaccines in childhood, Tdap provided moderate protection against 
pertussis during the first year and then waned rapidly so that litle protection remained 2-3 
years after vaccination.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Diphtheria, 
tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine 
effectiveness wanes after the fi
 fth dose, and 
adolescents who have only received DTaP vaccines 
rely on reduced antigen content acellular pertussis 
(Tdap) vaccinefor protection against pertussis. 
Despite high Tdap vaccine coverage among 
adolescents, California experienced large pertussis 
outbreaks in 2010 and 2014.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Routine Tdap vaccination 
did not prevent pertussis outbreaks in adolescents. 
Among adolescents previously vaccinated only with 
DTaP, Tdap provided moderate protection during 
the fi
 rst year and then waned rapidly so that little 
protection remained 2-3 years after vaccination.

KLEIN et al 
The United States switched from 
whole cell pertussis to acellular 
pertussis vaccines during the 1990s 
and now uses diphtheria-tetanus-
acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine 
for all 5 childhood doses at ages 2, 4, 
6, 12 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. 
In 2006, a booster tetanus toxoid, 
reduced diphtheria toxoid, and 
acellular pertussis(Tdap) vaccine, 
was recommended by the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization 
Practices for all adolescents.1 Despite 
high levels of vaccine coverage, the 
United States2 and other countries3–7 
have experienced increased pertussis 
disease in the years after the switch 
to DTaP.
In 2010, California experienced 
the largest pertussis epidemic 
since 19582 as the first cohort of 
children to receive all DTaP vaccines 
(without any doses of a whole cell 
pertussis vaccine) were starting to 
reach 10 to 12 years of age. This 
2010 outbreak was associated with 
10 infant deaths. We and others 
subsequently demonstrated that 
the effectiveness of DTaP vaccines 
wanes substantially in school age 
and younger children8–12 and that 
DTaP provides reduced long-term 
protection against pertussis when 
compared with whole cell pertussis 
vaccines.13–15 We estimated that 
DTaP protection wanes 42% per 
year on average after the fifth dose 
at 4 to 6 years of age8 and predicted 
that there would be larger pertussis 
outbreaks as the cohort of children 
vaccinated exclusively with DTaP 
vaccines expanded and became older 
and more distant from their fifth 
DTaP dose.8,16
This growing cohort of adolescents 
who have only received DTaP 
vaccines therefore relies on the 
booster dose of Tdap for protection 
against pertussis. We previously 
demonstrated using data from the 
2010 epidemic that Tdap provided 
moderate protection against 
pertussis in adolescents who had 
only received acellular pertussis 
vaccines17;however, we did not 
assess Tdap waning because most 
of the adolescents who had received 
Tdap had received it recently (few 
adolescents who had only received 
DTaP vaccines and who also received 
Tdap were older than 12 years in the 
2010 epidemic).
In July 2011, the state of California 
mandated that all adolescents 
receive a dose of Tdap vaccine before 
entering seventh grade.18 Despite 
this requirement, California again 
experienced another pertussis 
epidemic in 2014, with an incidence 
rate surpassing that of the 2010 
epidemic.19
Tdap’s effectiveness during 2 
successive pertussis outbreaks has 
not been assessed, nor is it well 
understood whether Tdap prevents 
new outbreaks in an exclusively 
DTaP-vaccinated population. In this 
study, we examined Tdap vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) among adolescents 
previously vaccinated only with 
DTaPin Kaiser Permanente Northern 
California (KPNC) after both the 
2010 and 2014 outbreaks. Our aims 
were to evaluate Tdap VE during 
the first year after vaccination and 
then during each of the next several 
years and to estimate the average 
annual percentage decrease in Tdap 
VE among adolescents previously 
vaccinated only with DTaP.
METHODS
Setting
KPNC is an integrated health care 
delivery system that provides 
medical care to ∼3.5 million 
members, and operates 55 medical 
clinics and 20 hospitals and its own 
pharmacies and laboratories. KPNC 
databases capture vaccinations, 
laboratory tests, and inpatient, 
emergency department (ED), and 
outpatient diagnoses. KPNC performs 
all pertussis testing in a single, 
centralized laboratory by using 
real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR).8,13
Study Population
This study followed all KPNC 
members starting at age 10 years 
who had exclusively received DTaP 
vaccines in infancy and childhood. 
We limited the study population 
to individuals who were born in 
1999 or later13 or who were born 
in 1996–1998 and received 3 infant 
doses of DTaP at KPNC. We excluded 
individuals who received Tdap 
vaccine or who were positive for 
pertussis before age 10 years. We 
defined a case as testing PCR positive 
for pertussis.
KPNC has used both available Tdap 
vaccines, Boostrix (GlaxoSmithKline) 
and Adacel (Sanofi Pasteur), but 
predominantly Adacel. KPNC 
has administered DTaP vaccines 
from various manufacturers 
but has mostly used those from 
GlaxoSmithKline. This study included 
all acellular pertussis vaccines 
regardless of manufacturer.
KPNC’s Institutional Review Board 
approved this study.
Statistical Analyses
We modeled risk of pertussis in 
relation to Tdap vaccination status 
starting from the 10th birthday 
until the first occurrence of a PCR-
positive test for pertussis, receipt 
of a second Tdap, disenrollment 
from KPNC, or end of follow-up 
(March 31, 2015). Tdap vaccination 
status was specified as a set of time-
varying variables that indicated 
whether a person was unvaccinated, 
too-recently-vaccinated-to-benefit 
(within 1–7 days), or vaccinated 
in the previous 8 days to <1 year 
(“year 1”), 1 to <2 years (“year 2”), 
2 to <3 years (“year 3”), or ≥3 years 
(“year 4+”). VE was assessed for 
each of the 4 ranges of vaccinated 
person-time beginning 8 days after 
receipt of Tdap. Adolescents were 
considered unvaccinated until they 
receivedTdap and then moved across

the year-since-vaccination indicator 
variables with each additional year 
of follow-up (individuals contributed 
unvaccinated person-time until their 
date of Tdap vaccination, and then 
contributed vaccinated person-time). 
We used a Cox regression model to 
estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of 
pertussis for each Tdap time interval 
compared with the unvaccinated 
reference period. For example, 
the HR for the 1 to <2 years since 
vaccination variable estimates the 
risk of pertussis in an adolescent 
who received Tdap 1 to <2 years ago 
divided by the risk in an otherwise 
similar unvaccinated adolescent. The 
Cox regression was on the calendar 
timeline and stratified by birth year 
and included covariates that adjusted 
for gender, race, and facility. We 
compared the Tdap status of each 
pertussis case with the Tdap status of 
all persons born the same year who 
were at risk on the same day the case 
was identified. We calculated VE as 
1 – HR.
We evaluated the HR for several 
subsequent years after Tdap 
vaccination and found that the 
waning of Tdap effectiveness was 
approximately linear on the log-
odds scale. We then treated Tdap 
vaccination as a continuous variable 
and estimated the HR per 365 days 
since Tdap vaccination by using 
a Cox regression model similar to 
that described earlier. This (single) 
HR indicates the average percent 
increase in the odds of acquiring 
pertussis per year of additional time 
since Tdap vaccination.
We used SAS software, version 
9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for all 
analyses.
RESULTS
Incidence of pertussis for the entire 
health plan population varied by 
year, peaking sharply during the 
2010 and 2014 California outbreaks 
(Fig 1). Pertussis incidence also 
varied by age during each of the 
outbreaks (Fig 2). Age-specific 
incidence peaked at ages 10 to 11 
in each outbreak (at ∼300 cases per 
100 000 person-years [P-Y]) during 
2010 and 2014 (Fig 2). Pertussis 
incidence in the 2010 outbreak 
sharply declined after this peak and 
stayed low at older ages (Fig 2), 
a decline that we have previously 
demonstrated to be associated with 
the receipt of whole cell instead of 
acellular pertussis vaccines in infancy 
and childhood8,13 as well as with 
Tdap receipt. Pertussis incidence in 
the 2014 outbreak declined similarly 
among 12-year-olds to 205 cases 
per 100 000 P-Y. In contrast to 2010, 
disease rose again sharply among 
14- to 16-year-olds, with incidence 
rate reaching its highest level at 14 
years of age (465 cases per 100 000 
P-Y), despite Tdap coverage rates 
close to 90% (Fig 3). The high rate 
of pertussis at 14 to 16 years of age 
decreased beginning at ages 18 to 19 
years (Fig 2), which corresponds to 
the ages of persons who had received 
whole cell pertussis vaccines as 
young children (Fig 3).
To analyze Tdap VE, the study 
population included 1207 pertussis 
cases among 279 493 persons 
contributing 792 418 P-Y from 
January 2006 to March 2015. Almost 
85% of all P-Y were contributed 
by persons aged 10 to 13 years, 
15% by those aged 14 to 16 years, 
and 0.5% by those aged 17 to 19 
years. Within the study population, 
175 094 persons received Tdap and 
were followed for an average of 2.4 
years (10th–90th, range 0.4–4.5 
years) after Tdap, totaling 418 595 
vaccinated P-Y (Table 1). The 
unadjusted pertussis incidence rates 
per 100 000 P-Y for all ages combined 
were similar in unvaccinated versus 
vaccinated adolescents (incidence 
rate ratio 0.95, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.85–1.06; Table 2).
In the Cox regression analyses, Tdap 
VE steadily decreased each additional 
year after vaccination, starting at 
68.8% (95% CI 59.7% to 75.9%) 
during year 1, declining to 56.9% 
(95% CI 41.3% to 68.4%) during 
year 2, further declining to 25.2% 
(95% CI –4.3% to 46.4%) during 
year 3, and to 8.9% (95% CI –30.6% 
to 36.4%) during the 4+ years after

vaccination (Table 3). The estimated 
increase in the HR per year since 
Tdap vaccination was 1.35 (95% CI 
1.22 to 1.50), indicating that during 
recent pertussis outbreaks the 
risk of pertussis in Tdap vaccinees 
was higher by 35% per year after 
vaccination in the vaccinees who 
were more remote from Tdap 
vaccination.
Pertussis cases were mild or moderate 
in severity regardless of Tdap status. 
Within 5 days before or after the 
positive PCR test, 1185 per 1207 
cases (98.2%) had a health care visit; 
1041 (86.2%) received a diagnosis 
of pertussis, cough, or exposure to 
pertussis; and 138 (11.4%) received a 
“pertussis-related” diagnosis (upper 
respiratory infection, viral syndrome, 
asthma/wheezing/bronchospasm, 
bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, nasal 
congestion, vomiting, croup, 
pneumonia, shortness of breath, or 
sinusitis); 1164 (96.4%) received a 
prescription for azithromycin, except 
for 1 erythromycin. We identified 44 
(3.6%) cases with 50 total ED visits 
for pertussis care. The diagnoses 
received, percent who received 
antibiotic treatment, and percent 
who sought ED care did not vary 
according to Tdap vaccination status. 
There were no pertussis-related 
hospitalizations or deaths in the study 
population.
DISCUSSION
This study investigated the 
effectiveness of Tdap against 
pertussis in a highly vaccinated 
population during 2 successive 
epidemics. We demonstrate that 
among a cohort of teenagers who 
have exclusively received acellular 
pertussis vaccines, Tdap provides 
moderate protection 1 year after 
vaccination and then protection 
wanes rapidly. Tdap VE was 69% 
during the first year after vaccination, 
declining to <9% by ≥4 years after 
vaccination. This amounted to a 
waning of Tdap protection of 35%

In this study, 96.5% of adolescents 
had received Tdap by their 14th 
birthday because California mandates 
it before beginning seventh grade. 
Widespread Tdap vaccination seen 
in Fig 3 although associated with 
a transient decrease in pertussis 
incidence, did not prevent outbreaks 
among this population of teenagers 
who have only ever received acellular 
pertussis vaccines.
This study demonstrates that despite 
high rates of Tdap vaccination, the 
growing cohort of adolescents who 
have only received acellular pertussis 
vaccines continue to be at high risk of 
contracting pertussis and sustaining 
epidemics. In 2010, children aged 10 
to 12 were the first cohort to have 
exclusively received DTaP vaccines 
and they were the population at 
highest risk of disease. The strategy 
of routinely vaccinating adolescents 
to prevent future disease did not 
prevent the 2014 epidemic, arguably 
because the protection afforded by a 
dose of Tdap was too short-lived.
We8,13 and others9–11 have previously 
shown that the effectiveness of DTaP 
vaccines wanes substantially, even 
among fully vaccinated children. 
An important consideration in this 
current study is that Tdap waning 
estimates may reflect both ongoing

Tdap, they simultaneously become 
1 year more remote from their last 
DTaP dose. This study was unable 
to disentangle the waning of Tdap 
effectiveness from the ongoing 
waning of previous doses of DTaP 
because the years since vaccination 
for Tdap and the fifth DTaP dose are 
closely correlated.
Our estimate of Tdap waning 
is consistent with previous 
observations but provides additional 
data including 2 separate pertussis 
epidemics. Koepke et al evaluated 
Tdap waning during a 2012 pertussis 
outbreak in Wisconsin and found 
that Tdap VE was 75% for those 
vaccinated in 2012, and much lower 
at ∼12% for those vaccinated 3 to 
4 years earlier in 2008–2009.20 Our 
results are also consistent with a 
case-control study that investigated 
Tdap VE during a 2012 pertussis 
outbreak in Washington State. 
This study estimated that among 
adolescents with an exclusive 
acellular pertussis vaccine history, VE 
was 73% within 1 year of vaccination 
and declined to 34% by 2 to 4 years 
after Tdap.21 Taken together with 
the current study, these results all 
indicate that Tdap provides little 
protection against pertussis beyond 
the first 2 to 3 years after vaccination.
Immunizing women with Tdap 
during pregnancy is effective 
at protecting infants against 
pertussis.22,23 A recent study found 
that siblings (median age 8 years) 
are now the most common source 
of pertussis infection in infants24; 
however, it is not clear whether 
adolescent Tdap boosters are 
important for protecting infants.25 
Tdap vaccination of pregnant women 
is likely to have a larger impact on 
pertussis in infants. Protection by 
Tdap during pregnancy is thought to 
be due to the passage of antibodies 
across the placenta. Therefore, the 
half-life of immunoglobulin G and 
when Tdap is given in pregnancy 
relative to delivery largely 
determines the level of antibodies 
transferred to the neonate rather 
than Tdap duration of protection. As 
yet, most women currently receiving 
Tdap during pregnancy received 
whole cell pertussis vaccines during 
infancy and childhood; however, as 
the current adolescent population 
ages into adulthood, an increasing 
proportion of pregnant women will 
have only ever had DTaP vaccines. 
It is not known whether Tdap 
vaccination of these pregnant women 
will result in transfer of antibodies 
that are comparable in quantity 
and quality and that will similarly 
protect infants. In the meantime, 
because Tdap’s protection is short-
lived, it is important to continue 
current Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices policy of 
vaccinating all pregnant women with 
Tdap during every pregnancy.26
A significant strength of this study 
was our ability to follow a large study 
population over a long period of time 
that included 2 pertussis outbreaks. 
We followed all KPNC members who 
only received DTaP vaccines starting 
at age 10 years and continuing 
until the occurrence of pertussis, a 
censoring event, or the end of the 
study in March 31, 2015. The large 
study population allowed us to 
stratify the analyses by birth year to 
control for age-related confounding. 
Our study calculated Tdap 
effectiveness using data that spanned 
over 9 years and 2 separate pertussis 
epidemics. We used calendar time 
as the timeline in the Cox regression 
model so that cases were compared 
only with other persons at risk on 
the same date. Careful adjustment for 
calendar time is important because 
risk of pertussis exposure changes 
rapidly during an outbreak.
It has been suggested that recent 
increases in pertussis incidence are 
mostly due to greater test sensitivity, 
awareness, or testing utilization27; 
however, it is unlikely that our 
findings were related solely or 
even primarily to those reasons. In 
particular, KPNC has used the same 
PCR test for pertussis since 2006, and 
thus greater test sensitivity did not 
play a role. Furthermore, while the 
2010 California outbreak received 
substantial media attention at the 
time, the outbreak in 2014 received 
less coverage and was less visible to 
the general public.23 Finally, the age-
specific incidence patterns during 
the 2 epidemics had distinct peaks 
that coincided with the aging of the 
cohort exclusively vaccinated with 
DTaP and the timing of Tdap receipt. 
It is not plausible that the shift in 
peak incidence to an older age over 
the 2 epidemics is mainly related to 
selective testing utilization within the 
adolescent population.
Our study was not designed to 
directly compare the 2 brands of 
Tdap vaccine and had limited ability 
to detect differences in duration of 
protection between the brands. We 
observed substantial waning after 
both Tdap vaccines and found no 
evidence that waning was greater 
after one or the other. We were also 
not able to compare individuals 
who received all acellular pertussis 
vaccines from 1 manufacturer versus 
individuals who received vaccines 
from both manufacturers. Most of 
the teenagers in this study received 
pertussis vaccines from both 
manufacturers. Almost 80% of Tdap 
doses were from 1 manufacturer

(Sanofi Pasteur), whereas among 
the study participants for whom 
we had complete DTaP vaccine 
data, 75% of DTaP doses were from 
GlaxoSmithKline. In addition, because 
nearly all of the study population had 
received Tdap by age 13 years and 
>85% were vaccinated at age 11 or 
12, there were small differences in 
age distribution by Tdap vaccination 
status: unvaccinated (92% of P-Y 
was contributed by persons aged 
10–11 years), vaccinated 8 days to 
<1 year (86% of P-Y was contributed 
by persons aged 11–12 years), 
vaccinated 1 year to <2 years (85% of 
P-Y was contributed by persons aged 
12–13 years), vaccinated 2 years to 
<3 years (83% of P-Y was contributed 
by persons aged 13–14 years), and 
vaccinated ≥3 years (89% of P-Y was 
contributed by persons aged 14–16 
years). Finally, recent reports have 
suggested that pertactin-deficient 
pertussis strains may be contributing 
to ongoing outbreaks28,29 and 
the degree to which pertactin-
deficient pertussis strains may have 
contributed to our results is not 
known.
Waning immunity is seen for other 
vaccines, yet disease control can 
often be maintained in a population

provided vaccine coverage is high 
enough in the right age groups. 
This is not the case for pertussis. 
Mathematical models have found that 
pertussis transmission is affected by 
both variations in VE and pertussis 
transmission rates.30 Additional 
modeling may be helpful in further 
determining factors important for 
future interventions on a population 
basis.
CONCLUSIONS
Among teenagers who have only 
ever received acellular pertussis 
vaccines, Tdap provides moderate 
protection against pertussis during 
the first year after vaccination, and 
then protection wanes to <9% at 
≥4 years after vaccination. Routine 
immunization with Tdap did not 
prevent pertussis outbreaks among 
this highly vaccinated population. We 
expect future pertussis epidemics to 
be larger as the cohort that has only 
received acellular pertussis vaccines 
ages. The results in this study raise 
serious questions regarding the 
benefits of routinely administering 
a single dose of Tdap to every 
adolescent aged 11 or 12 years. 
Because Tdap provides reasonable 
short-term protection against 
pertussis, Tdap may more effectively 
contain pertussis if it is administered 
to adolescents in anticipation of a 
local pertussis outbreak rather than 
on a routine basis. For other vaccines, 
some countries have successfully 
implemented national or regional 
immunization campaigns in the face 
of an epidemic.31–36 While awaiting 
development of new vaccines that 
will provide long-lasting protection 
against pertussis, we should consider 
alternate Tdap immunization 
strategies for adolescents.
