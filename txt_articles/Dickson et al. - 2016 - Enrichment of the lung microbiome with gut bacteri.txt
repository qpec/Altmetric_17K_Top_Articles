SUMMARY
Sepsis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are major causes of mortality without 
targeted therapies. Although many experimental and clinical observations have implicated gut 
microbiota in the pathogenesis of these diseases, culture-based studies have failed to demonstrate 
translocation of bacteria to the lungs in critically ill patients. Here we report culture-independent 
evidence that the lung microbiome is enriched with gut bacteria both in a murine model of sepsis 
and in humans with established ARDS. Following experimental sepsis, lung communities were 
dominated by viable gut-associated bacteria. Ecologic analysis identified the lower gastrointestinal 
tract, rather than the upper respiratory tract, as the likely source community of post-sepsis lung 
bacteria. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from humans with ARDS, gut-specific bacteria 
(Bacteroides spp.) were common and abundant, undetected by culture, and correlated with the 
intensity of systemic inflammation. Alveolar TNF-α, a key mediator of alveolar inflammation in 
ARDS, was significantly correlated with altered lung microbiota. Our results demonstrate that the 
lung microbiome is enriched with gut-associated bacteria in sepsis and ARDS, potentially 
representing a shared mechanism of pathogenesis in these common and lethal diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Sepsis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common, costly diseases 
with high mortality and no targeted therapies1,2. Sepsis is the most common cause of 
ARDS2,3, and sepsis-related ARDS is more severe and lethal than non-sepsis-related

 ARDS4. Numerous experimental and clinical observations over decades of study have 
demonstrated that the gut microbiome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and 
ARDS5: antibiotic-suppressed and germ-free animals are protected from the lung injury and 
mortality of experimental sepsis6–8, and numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that 
prophylactic suppression of gut microbiota with antibiotics is protective against multiorgan 
failure and mortality in patients with critical illness5,9. Yet the mechanism of the gut 
microbiome’s role in sepsis and ARDS is undetermined5,10,11, and prior studies have been 
limited by dependence upon culture-based techniques of microbial identification12.
We here report that the lung microbiome is enriched with gut bacteria in experimental sepsis 
and human ARDS. Enrichment of the lung microbiome by gut-associated bacteria occurs 
independent of the upper respiratory tract, correlates with severity of systemic inflammation, 
and results in the persistence of viable bacteria within the lung microbiome. Alveolar TNF-
α, a key mediator of alveolar inflammation in ARDS, is significantly correlated with 
alterations in lung microbiota. Our results suggest a potential common mechanism behind 
the gut microbiome’s established role in these common diseases of critical illness.
RESULTS
Lung microbiota are altered after experimental sepsis
To determine whether sepsis results in altered lung microbiota, we used a well-established 
model of abdominal sepsis, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). As previously described, this 
survivable model provokes transient systemic inflammation that mirrors the human septic 
response13. We studied the microbiota of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts via 
sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA-encoding genes. Compared to the lungs of 
untreated mice, lungs of post-sepsis mice had greater community richness (number of 
detectable species) (Fig. 1a), consistent with immigration of new species. Bacterial 
communities in post-sepsis lungs were significantly distinct from those of untreated mice 
and mice that underwent sham surgery (P=0.02 for both). Lung communities of post-sepsis 
mice were significantly enriched with numerous bacteria found in the murine gut, including 
members of the Bacteroidales order, Enterococcus species (sp.), and Lachnospiraceae sp. 
(Fig. 1b). The two most abundant taxonomic groups, comprising nearly 40% of community 
members, were members of the Bacteroidales order, an abundant member of the murine gut 
microbiome. Abundant taxa in lungs of untreated mice are shown in Supplemental Figure 1. 
We then directly compared the bacterial community membership of colon and lung 
communities within each mouse to determine if post-sepsis lung communities more closely 
resembled those of the gut. Gut-lung similarity was significantly associated with 
experimental intervention (P≤0.05); gut and lung communities were most similar in post-
sepsis lungs and most dissimilar in untreated mice (Fig. 1c).
Given this evidence of gut-associated bacteria in the lungs 24 hours after experimental 
sepsis, we performed an experiment with additional experimental controls and extended 
timepoints to determine the duration of altered lung microbiota after sepsis. We compared 
mice exposed to experimental sepsis (CLP and concurrent imipenem) with mice exposed to 
sham surgery plus imipenem, mice exposed to imipenem only, and mice that received no 
intervention. We studied their lung communities at five days, two weeks and eight weeks

 following intervention. Lung communities significantly differed collectively according to 
intervention at five days (P=0.003). This collective difference in lung microbiota across 
intervention arms had resolved at two weeks and eight weeks (P>0.05, Supplemental Figure 
2). Five days post-sepsis, bacterial communities from lungs of post-sepsis mice were distinct 
from those of all control groups: sham-surgery-plus-imipenem (P=0.001), imipenem-only 
(P=0.004), and untreated (P=0.02)(Fig. 2a). By contrast, two weeks and eight weeks 
following exposure, lung communities from post-sepsis mice were indistinguishable from 
those of untreated mice (P>0.05, Fig. 2b). Thus the lung microbiome is altered following 
experimental sepsis, remains altered for at least five days, and normalizes by two weeks.
The post-sepsis lung microbiome is enriched with gut-associated bacteria
We then performed ecologic analysis to identify the source of altered lung microbiota after 
sepsis. To determine which bacteria were responsible for the altered communities in post-
sepsis lungs, we used biplot analysis of principal component analysis (vegan14) as well as 
model-based analysis of multivariate abundance data (mvabund15) to identify key microbial 
drivers of altered communities. Both techniques identified a member of the Bacteroidales 
order (OTU008) as enriched within the post-sepsis lung community (Supplemental Figure 
3a). Alignment searches of sequence databases revealed that while this taxonomic group 
(sequences with 100% coverage and 100% alignment) has been detected frequently in the 
murine gut16–18, no cultured specimen has been reported (Supplemental Figure 4). This 
Bacteroidales OTU comprised one third (33.1%) of total community membership in post-
sepsis lungs at five days, and was not enriched in the lungs of any control group (Fig. 3a). Its 
abundance normalized at two weeks. We analyzed oral bacterial communities to determine if 
enrichment of the lungs with this Bacteroidales OTU was secondary to altered upper 
respiratory tract microbiota. This Bacteroidales OTU was not abundant in bacterial 
communities of the tongues of mice following sepsis at any timepoint (Fig. 3a), indicating 
that the upper respiratory tract was not the source of altered lung microbiota in the post-
sepsis period.
We then compared other potential source communities to determine the origin of this 
Bacteroidales OTU. This sequence was detected in only one of 14 procedural and reagent 
control specimens, and comprised only 0.11% of bacterial sequences in these controls (Fig. 
3b). By contrast, this Bacteroidales OTU was the most abundant taxonomic group detected 
in specimens from the gut (cecum, colon and feces) of untreated mice (Fig. 3b), comprising 
18% of all sequences. The time course of gut-lung similarity in paired specimens from mice 
following experimental sepsis is shown in Supplemental Figure 5. This Bacteroidales OTU 
was detected inconsistently in blood specimens taken from post-sepsis mice (3 of 6 mice at 
five days post-sepsis). By contrast it was uniformly present in the lungs of post-sepsis mice 
(6 of 6 mice). Supplemental Figure 6 shows the relative abundance of this Bacteroidales 
OTU in gut specimens from post-sepsis mice following injury. Taken together, these results 
indicate that the lower gastrointestinal tract is the most likely source community of bacteria 
in the post-sepsis lung microbiome. The route of translocation (via portal circulation, 
systemic circulation or mesenteric lymphatics), if present, remains undetermined.

 Unlike bacterial culture, sequencing-based approaches depend only on the presence of 
bacterial DNA and do not reflect bacterial viability. To determine if the post-sepsis lung 
microbiome contains viable gut-associated bacteria, we cultured homogenized lung 
specimens of post-sepsis mice. Enterococcus faecalis was cultured from the lungs of all 
post-sepsis mice five days after exposure, and was not cultured from the lungs of mice in any 
control group (Fig. 3c). No bacterial growth, E. faecalis or otherwise, was observed from 
concurrent blood cultures. E. faecalis corresponded genetically to the second most abundant 
OTU in lungs of post-sepsis mice (Fig. 3c) and was identified by mvabund as relatively 
enriched within lungs of post-sepsis mice. As it has previously been reported that lung injury 
alone, in the absence of sepsis, is sufficient to alter the lung microbiome of mice19, we used 
a model of direct lung injury (intratracheal lipopolysaccharide [LPS] instillation) to test 
whether direct lung injury could provoke the outgrowth of gut-associated bacteria. No 
bacterial growth, E. faecalis or otherwise, was observed from the lungs of either the LPS-
instilled mice or those of controls (Fig. 3c). These data demonstrate that the gut-associated 
bacteria present in the post-sepsis lung microbiome are viable, and are not attributable to 
local inflammation alone.
To determine if enrichment of lung microbiota with gut-associated bacteria was specific to 
the CLP model, we employed a systemic LPS model of sepsis for validation. One day after 
LPS-induced shock, lung communities were significantly distinct from those of untreated 
mice (P=0.004, Supplemental Figure 7a), a difference that resolved by 4 days. This was 
driven by an Enterobacteriaceae-classified OTU that was enriched in post-sepsis lungs 
compared to those of untreated mice (P<0.01, Supplemental Figure 7b–c). A database 
alignment search determined that this OTU shares 100% genomic identity with gut-
associated members of the Enterobacteriaceae family such as Enterobacter cloacae and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae (Supplemental Figure 7d). We concluded that enrichment of the lung 
microbiome with gut-associated bacteria is not specific to the CLP model of sepsis.
The lung microbiome of humans with ARDS is enriched with uncultured gut bacteria
Given this experimental evidence suggesting translocation of gut bacteria to the lungs in 
sepsis, we asked if gut-associated bacteria are present in the lung microbiota of humans with 
ARDS. We sequenced bacterial communities in 100 specimens of bronchoalveolar lavage 
(BAL) fluid collected from 68 patients with ARDS, and compared these communities to 
those of seven healthy volunteers. Demographics and clinical features of ARDS patients are 
presented in Supplemental Table 1. We employed analysis of multivariate abundance 
(mvabund) to identify taxa enriched in BAL specimens from patients with ARDS relative to 
healthy subjects (Supplemental Figure 3b); of these, we focused on a prominent member of 
the Bacteroides genus (OTU009) that was classified to the same order (Bacteroidales) as the 
OTUs enriched in the post-sepsis lungs in our murine experiments. Alignment searches of 
databases revealed perfect alignment (100% coverage, 100% alignment) between this 
Bacteroides sp. and four anaerobic species abundant in the human gut20–22: B. fragilis, B. 
thetaiotaomicron, B. faecichinchillae and B. salyersiae (Supplemental Figure 4). Of the 24 
BAL specimens in this cohort studied by aerobic culture at the University of Michigan 
Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, none grew Bacteroides sp., despite culture-independent

 identification of this organism in eight (33%), confirming the limited sensitivity of aerobic 
culture-based techniques in identifying gut-associated anaerobes in respiratory specimens.
This gut-associated Bacteroides OTU was common and abundant in the BAL fluid of 
patients with ARDS, and was not detected in reagent control specimens nor in the BAL fluid 
of healthy subjects (Fig. 4a). It was detected in 33% (33) of ARDS BAL specimens, 
representing 41% (28) of all unique ARDS patients. This Bacteroides OTU comprised 5.7% 
of all sequences detected in ARDS BAL specimens. Supplemental Figure 8 shows the 
relative stability of this OTU in BAL communities of patients for whom serial BAL 
specimens were available. No association was detected between relative abundance of this 
Bacteroidales OTU and time since onset of ARDS, predisposing factor for ARDS, or 
severity of illness at diagnosis (P>0.05 for all). In a validation analysis using a previously 
published data set of bacterial communities sequenced from BAL from healthy subjects23, 
we identified a representative sequence corresponding to this Bacteroides OTU (100% 
alignment). This Bacteroides OTU was detected in the BAL of only one of twenty-six 
healthy subjects. Thus collectively this gut-associated Bacteroides sp. was detected in the 
lungs of only one of thirty-three (3.0%) healthy subjects, confirming it is not a normal 
community member in the healthy lung microbiome.
We then asked if enrichment of lung microbiota with gut bacteria was associated with 
systemic and alveolar inflammation, both as measured on the day of bronchoscopy. We 
compared alveolar microbiota with concentrations of TNF-α in serum (which is correlated 
with the diagnosis and severity of sepsis24,25) and BAL fluid (which is correlated with the 
diagnosis, severity and mortality of ARDS26,27). Among patients with ARDS, we observed a 
significant association between relative abundance of this gut-associated Bacteroides OTU 
and patients’ concurrent serum TNF-α concentration (P=0.01, Fig. 4b). This finding 
indicates that enrichment of gut bacteria in the lung microbiome is correlated with severity 
of acute systemic inflammation. By contrast, no association was found between relative 
abundance of this Bacteroides OTU and alveolar TNF-α concentration (P>0.05, Fig. 4b), 
suggesting that gut-lung bacterial translocation, if present, correlates with systemic, but not 
alveolar, inflammation. Relative enrichment of lung microbiota with the Proteobacteria 
phylum has been repeatedly associated with inflammatory lung disease28–30, as compared to 
enrichment with Bacteroidetes (e.g. Prevotella genus), the most abundant phylum in the 
healthy respiratory tract27,28. We hypothesized that relative abundance of Proteobacteria in 
the lungs of patients with ARDS would be correlated with alveolar inflammation. A 
significant positive correlation was observed between relative abundance of Proteobacteria 
and alveolar TNF-α (P=0.003, Fig. 4c). This relationship remained significant when we 
excluded specimens from subjects with a predisposing condition of pneumonia (P=0.02). By 
contrast, relative abundance of the usually prominent Bacteroidetes phylum was negatively 
correlated with alveolar TNF-α (P=0.04, Fig. 4c). These data confirm that key features of 
alveolar inflammation in ARDS are associated with alterations in lung microbiota.
DISCUSSION
The core finding of our study is that gut-associated bacteria, undetectable via conventional 
culture techniques, enrich the lung microbiome in experimental sepsis and human ARDS.

 Microbial evidence suggesting gut-lung translocation and disorder of the lung microbiome 
are respectively correlated with indices of systemic and alveolar inflammation. Our results 
suggest a potential common mechanism behind the gut microbiome’s established role in 
these common and lethal diseases.
The importance of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of critical illness has been 
established for more than sixty years6, though to date the mechanism of its role has been 
undetermined5,10,11. Suppression of gut bacteria, either via enteric antibiotics or use of 
germ-free animals, is protective against the lung injury and mortality of critical illness, a 
robust observation described widely across species (mice8,31, rats32, rabbits7 and dogs6) and 
models of shock (hemorrhage6, sepsis7 and ischemia/reperfusion8). Dozens of clinical trials 
have demonstrated that suppression of the gut microbiome (selective decontamination of the 
digestive tract) is protective against multiorgan failure and mortality in patients with critical 
illness5,9. Permeability of the intestinal wall is increased in critical illness and predictive of 
clinical outcome33, and culture-identified translocation of gut bacteria to mesenteric 
lymphatics is observed in experimental shock34 and predictive of subsequent sepsis in 
postoperative patients35. In a recent culture-independent study of patients undergoing 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant, features of the gut microbiome were predictive of 
pulmonary infiltrates (as observed in ARDS) and mortality36. Yet prior studies have failed to 
find evidence of bacterial translocation via sampling of the systemic, portal and lymphatic 
circulations12,37. Two potential explanations may explain the discrepancy between our 
findings and those of previous studies. Firstly, our culture-independent methodology is far 
more sensitive than prior culture-based approaches, as many bacteria in the human gut are 
undetectable via conventional culture38. The dominant lung bacteria in our experimental 
sepsis model is an as-of-yet uncultured Bacteroidales sp., and the most prominent gut-
associated bacteria in our human ARDS specimens were of the Bacteroides genus; neither 
grow in the standard conditions of clinical microbiology laboratories. Secondly, our results 
demonstrate the persistence of viable gut bacteria in the lungs days after sepsis, even in the 
absence of persistent bacteremia. This indicates that even a brief, transient immigration of 
gut bacteria may alter the lung microbiome. Gut permeability and the toxicity of mesenteric 
lymph peak in the immediate hours following experimental shock39,40, so subsequent 
assessment of blood or mesenteric lymph may fail to detect the presence of bacteria.
Our study is the first culture-independent analysis of the human lung microbiome in ARDS. 
Previous culture-dependent studies have suggested a relationship between bacteria of the 
respiratory tract and the pathophysiology of ARDS5. Pneumonia occurs far more frequently 
in patients with ARDS than in other mechanically ventilated patients41, and pulmonary 
exposure to bacterial factors (e.g. LPS and flagellin) provokes inflammation and injury 
characteristic of ARDS. Culture-independent studies of mechanically ventilated patients 
have demonstrated a previously unappreciated complexity to the respiratory microbiome5,42, 
and animal experimentation has recently shown that direct lung injury alters the lung 
microbiome19. In our study, disorder of the lung microbiome, characterized by enrichment 
with the Proteobacteria phylum (commonly enriched in the lung microbiota of patients with 
inflammatory lung conditions28–30) was significantly associated with elevated alveolar 
concentrations of TNF-α, a key mediator of pulmonary inflammation in ARDS that is 
independently predictive of mortality27. By contrast, decreased alveolar concentrations of

 TNF-α were associated with enrichment of the lung microbiome with Bacteroidetes, the 
most abundant phylum in the lung microbiome of healthy subjects23,28. Our results do not 
imply that bacterial translocation and dysbiosis are the sole or primary cause of ARDS, as 
numerous non-bacterial exposures (e.g. oleic acid, hydrochloric acid and gut ischemia 
factors40) can initiate alveolar injury, and the complex clinical syndromes of sepsis and 
ARDS each encompass multiple pathophysiological pathways. Sepsis and ARDS both have 
dynamic and temporally heterogeneous clinical and biological courses; our study of BAL 
specimens from patients with established ARDS may not reflect the microbiology of early 
and developing ARDS. Though we could control for antibiotic exposure in our murine 
model of sepsis, the effects of ubiquitous antibiotic exposure on lung microbiota in humans 
with ARDS is unknown. Additionally, though TNF-α is a key mediator in these conditions 
(systemically in sepsis28,29, in the alveolar space in ARDS30,31), it alone cannot represent 
the complexity of the dysregulated host response of critical illness. Further study will be 
needed to determine the role of lung microbiota in the initiation, augmentation and 
perpetuation of ARDS.
In both our animal model of sepsis and our human study of ARDS, we identified prominent 
anaerobic gut-associated bacteria not previously implicated in sepsis or ARDS. The 
Bacteroidales OTU that dominated post-sepsis lungs has previously been identified 
molecularly, but not cultured, in the murine gut16–18. Separately, a distinct OTU of the 
Bacteroides genus was common and abundant in lungs of humans with ARDS but absent 
from those of healthy subjects. This genus is the most abundant taxonomic group in the 
human gut microbiome43, and this OTU was absent from lung specimens both in our study’s 
healthy subjects and from previously published reports of the normal lung 
microbiome23,44,45. Within the field of environmental microbiology, molecular detection of 
the Bacteroides genus is used as an indicator of human fecal contamination in watersheds46. 
Our results suggest it may serve a similar role within the respiratory ecosystem. The relative 
abundance of this Bacteroides OTU in the lung microbiome, plausibly reflecting the degree 
of gut-lung translocation, was significantly associated with serum concentrations of TNF-α, 
a key mediator of the septic stress response that is predictive of patient mortality24,25. In an 
innovative recent study of patients with established ARDS, latent class analysis identified a 
subphenotype of ARDS patients characterized by high systemic inflammation, associated 
with worse prognosis and distinct response to therapy47. Our finding that systemic TNF-α 
correlates with enrichment of gut bacteria in BAL fluid suggests that this subphenotype may 
be characterized by differences in lung microbiota. Importantly, the Bacteroides genus is 
highly variable in its abundance, is dominant in only a subset of healthy adults43, and is 
diminished in patients with established critical illness48. It is thus not a universal marker of 
human gut microbiota. Further longitudinal study of paired stool and lung specimens will be 
needed to determine the true prevalence of gut-lung translocation in sepsis and ARDS.
The lung microbiome is determined by the balance of three ecological factors: immigration, 
elimination and the relative growth rates of resident microbiota49. Our experimental results 
demonstrate that the upper respiratory tract, the lung microbiome’s primary source 
community in health, is not the source of altered lung microbiota after sepsis. Though our 
findings suggest a mechanism of immigration via translocation of gut microbiota, a 
competing explanation is relative outgrowth of bacteria present in low abundance before

 injury. Indeed, the Bacteroidales OTU enriched after CLP-induced sepsis was detectable in 
low levels in lung communities of untreated mice. Yet E. faecalis, detected via culture in all 
post-sepsis lung specimens, was not cultured from the lungs of any control animal. Thus if 
this gut-associated bacteria is present in lung communities before injury, its abundance is 
less than our assay’s very low limit of detection (100 CFUs per lung). Analogously, if the 
Bacteroides OTU that was abundant in our human ARDS specimens is present in the healthy 
lung microbiome, it is present but below the highly sensitive limit of detection of 16S 
sequencing. Further, our model of direct lung injury (intratracheal LPS) resulted in no 
detectable outgrowth of gut-associated bacteria, a finding consistent with previously 
published studies19. Definitive proof of gut-lung translocation will require additional study, 
including techniques such as paired metagenomic comparisons of gut and lung microbiota 
and use of labeled “tracer” bacteria in gnotobiotic animals. We have recently posited a 
conceptual model of how alveolar inflammation and injury can both perpetuate - and be 
perpetuated by - disordered bacterial communities in the respiratory tract5,50. The significant 
positive correlation we report between alveolar TNF-α and enrichment with the 
Proteobacteria phylum is evidence that even in the absence of gut-lung translocation, the 
microbiome may play an important role in ARDS.
In summary, these data demonstrate that the lung microbiome is enriched with gut bacteria 
in experimental sepsis and human ARDS. Enrichment with gut bacteria is significantly 
associated with key features of systemic inflammation. Alveolar TNF-α, a key mediator of 
the alveolar inflammation of ARDS, is significantly correlated with disorder of the lung 
microbiome. Our findings suggest that gut-lung translocation and alteration of the lung 
microbiome may represent a common mechanism of pathogenesis in sepsis and ARDS, and 
suggest potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of these common and 
lethal diseases.

 Mice
8- to 12-week old male C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and 
housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. For safety, post-surgical (sham and CLP) 
mice were housed separately from untreated and antibiotic-only mice. Apart from this 
isolation of post-surgical mice, mice were not separately housed according to intervention 
arm or timepoint. Given the copraphagic behavior of co-housed mice, cage number was 
recorded for each mouse and incorporated as a potential confounder into multivariable 
microbiome analysis as reported in Results. Intervention group was determined for each 
mouse by random selection by investigators. In the initial (24 hour CLP) experiment, four 
mice were used per intervention arm. In the subsequent experiment (extended timepoint 
CLP), six mice were used per intervention arm per timepoint. These numbers were used 
based on prior experiments on antibiotic-treated mice that demonstrated appreciable 
microbial community effects comparing comparably sized groups. Except as where reported 
otherwise, all reported replicates were biological (distinct mice separately exposed to the 
same intervention) rather than technical (repeated measurement or analysis of the same 
sample).
Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)
CLP was used as a model of systemic sepsis syndrome as previously described13,51. Mice 
were anesthetized with a mixture of intraperitoneal xylazine and ketamine. A 1-cm 
longitudinal incision was made to the lower-right quadrant of the abdomen and the cecum 
exposed. The distal one-third of the cecum was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture and punctured 
through with a 19-gauge needle. The cecum was then placed back in the peritoneal cavity, 
and the incision was closed with surgical staples. In sham surgical controls, the cecum was 
exposed but not ligated or punctured, then returned to the abdominal cavity. All mice were 
administered 1 ml of sterile saline subcutaneously for fluid resuscitation and 0.5 mg of 
subcutaneous imipenem during the immediate postoperative period. As described in Results, 
various control arms received no intervention, imipenem only, imipenem plus sham surgery, 
and imipenem plus CLP. Each experiment, as detailed in Results, was performed once. No 
unreported experiments have been omitted from Results.
Lipopolysaccharide models
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (derived from Escherechia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich) was 
given systemically as a model of systemic shock and intratracheally as a model of direct 
lung injury. Systemic shock was induced using a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg. 
Control mice received an intraperitoneal injection of phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Mice 
were harvested at 1 day and 4 days following exposure. Direct lung injury was induced via 
intratracheal instillation of 10 μg LPS; control mice received an intratracheal instillation of 
PBS. Mice were harvested 3 days following exposure.
Mouse tissue collection and processing
Mice were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation. Low biomass specimens (tongue, lung) were 
removed prior to high biomass specimens (cecum, colon, feces). Blood was collected from 
mice during harvest using needle aspiration via the right ventricle. Instruments were rinsed

 with ethanol and flamed between each organ. Murine lungs were excised, placed in tubes 
containing 1 ml of sterile water and homogenized mechanically by using a Tissue-Tearor 
(Biospec Products, Bartlesville, Okla.). The tissue homogenizer was cleaned and rinsed in 
ethanol and water between each tissue. Water control specimens from homogenization, 
exposed to cleaned instruments, were included in sequencing as procedural controls.
Lung and blood CFU assay
Aliquots of lung homogenates and blood were plated onto LB media in 10-fold dilutions and 
incubated aerobically at 37°C. Colonies were counted after 24 hours of growth. In addition 
to the Enterococcus growth depicted in Figure 3, the lungs of two sham surgery animals and 
one post-sepsis animal grew Lactobacillus spp., and the lungs of one CLP mouse grew 
Staphylococcus sp. Overall CFU counts were significantly greater in post-sepsis lungs (P ≤ 
0.01), and the specific growth of Lactobacillus spp. and Staphylocococcus sp. was not 
significantly different across intervention arms (P > 0.05). No growth was observed three 
days after intratracheal instillation of PBS or PBS and LPS. CFUs were plated and measured 
in duplicate for each mouse; values reported are means for each animal.
Subject enrollment
All human ARDS subjects were enrolled in a multicenter randomized trial of recombinant 
human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor for patients with ARDS 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00201409). Details of study sites and enrollment have 
previously been described52. ARDS was defined clinically as per the American-European 
Consensus Conference definition53. Patients were excluded if younger than 18 years, if 7 or 
more days had elapsed since onset of ARDS, if there was evidence of preexisting chronic 
respiratory failure, if the patient was neutropenic, if the patient had a history of hematologic 
malignancy or bone marrow transplantation, if the patient was already enrolled in other 
therapeutic trials or if the patient or his/her authorized decision maker or attending physician 
had decided to forego aggressive care. Patients were enrolled within 7 days of first meeting 
criteria for ARDS. Reported timepoints are relative to the time of randomization. Both pre-
intervention and post-intervention BAL specimens were used from patients in both study 
arms. Randomization to the GM-CSF arm had no detectable effect on BAL microbiota (P > 
0.05, PERMANOVA) or the abundance of the Bacteroidetes-classified OTU009, using either 
initial or post-intervention BAL specimens. Healthy control subjects were recruited from the 
southeast Michigan community. All control subjects were less than 55 years of age, were 
taking no medications, and were life-long nonsmokers. The validation cohort of BAL 
specimens from healthy subjects has previously been published and described in detail23. 
Specimens in this cohort were similarly sequenced using the 454 Pyrosequencing platform, 
though whole BAL specimens were used; the cell removal step does result in detection of a 
related but taxonomically distinct community in BAL fluid54.
Study population
We sequenced 100 specimens of BAL fluid collected from 68 unique patients with ARDS 
admitted to intensive care units in three academic medical centers: University of Michigan 
Medical Center, Emory University Hospitals, and the University of Colorado Denver. Mean 
time since study enrollment (which was within 7 days of meeting ARDS criteria) was 8.7

 ± 6.2 days. 25 specimens were obtained within 3 days of enrollment, 61 within seven days, 
84 within two weeks and 99 within 3 weeks; one specimen was obtained 28 days after study 
enrollment. Patients had a mean age of 47.4 ± 14.5 years and were predominantly male 
(67%) and Caucasian (66%). The most common ARDS risk factors were pneumonia 
(29.4%), sepsis (26.4%) and aspiration (20.6%). Other etiologies included pancreatitis, 
trauma and transfusion-related lung injury. Additional information including clinical 
microbiology results and antibiotic exposure was obtained from the electronic medical 
records of 18 subjects enrolled at the University of Michigan Medical Center representing 24 
total BAL fluid specimens. Of these, at the time of bronchoscopy all specimens (100%) were 
obtained while the subject was receiving antibiotics, and most (83.3%) were obtained while 
subjects were receiving multiple antibiotics. The most common antibiotics used were 
vancomycin (50%), piperacillin-tazobactam (41.7%), levofloxacin (41.7%) and cefepime 
(16.7%). Relatively few specimens were obtained from subjects receiving antifungal therapy 
(12.5%) or macrolide antibiotics (8.3%). The most common clinical microbiology results 
were no growth (37.5%), “oral flora” (33.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3%), 
Burkholderia cepacia (8.3%) and Staphylococcus spp. (8.3%).
BAL collection and processing
BAL was performed using standard technique before randomization and at designated 
timepoints following enrollment (3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days). One hundred sixty 
milliliters of sterile isotonic saline was instilled in 20-mL aliquots, with gentle suctioning 
after each aliquot. Bronchoscopy was not performed for research purposes if the P/F ratio 
was less than 100, the patient was deemed to be too unstable by the attending clinician, or 
the surrogate declined participation in this portion of the study. Cells were separated via 
centrifugation (11g for 10 minutes), and the cell-free supernatant was frozen at −80°C for 
subsequent assays. Cell-free supernatants were subsequently centrifuged (22,500g for 30 
minutes) with the resulting pellet used for DNA isolation.
Bacterial DNA isolation
Genomic DNA was extracted from mouse tissue and human acellular BAL pellets 
resuspended in 360μl ATL buffer (Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit) and homogenized in 
UltraClean fecal DNA bead tubes (MO-BIO, Carlsbad, CA) using a modified protocol 
previously demonstrated to isolate bacterial DNA55. Sterile laboratory water and AE buffer 
used in DNA isolation were collected and analyzed as potential sources of contamination.
16S DNA sequencing
Mouse tissue specimens—The V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene was amplified using 
published primers56 and the dual-indexing sequencing strategy developed by the laboratory 
of Patrick D. Schloss57. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform, 
using a MiSeq Reagent Kit V2 (500 cycles), according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
with modifications found in the Schloss SOP58. Accuprime High Fidelity Taq was used in 
place of Accuprime Pfx SuperMix. Primary PCR cycling conditions were 95°C for two 
minutes, followed by 20 cycles of touchdown PCR (95°C 20 seconds, 60°C 20 seconds and 
decreasing 0.3 degrees each cycle, 72°C 5 minutes), then 20 cycles of standard PCR (95°C

 for 20 seconds, 55°C for 15 seconds, and 72°C for 5 minutes), and finished with 72°C for 10 
minutes.
Human BAL specimens—The V3-V5 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA 
gene were sequenced in the V5-V3 direction using barcoded primer sets corresponding to 
357F and 926R59. These barcoded primers were originally developed by the Broad Institute. 
Primary PCR cycling conditions were 95°C for two minutes, followed by 20 cycles of 
touchdown PCR (95°C 20 seconds, followed by an annealing for 30 seconds beginning at 
60°C and decreasing one degree every two cycles until 50°C, and an elongation of 72°C 45 
seconds), then 20 cycles of standard PCR (95°C for 20 seconds, 50°C for 30 seconds, and 
72°C for 45 seconds), and finished with 72°C for 5 minutes. Quality control and sequencing 
was carried out at the University of Michigan, using the Roche 454 GS Junior according to 
established protocols60.
Cytokine measurement in ARDS patients
TNF-α was measured in the 74 human BAL fluid specimens for which adequate fluid was 
available, acquired from 55 unique patients. TNF-α was also measured in 58 serum 
specimens collected from 46 unique patients. These serum specimens were collected on the 
same day as the bronchoscopy used for comparison. TNF-α was measured in serum and 
BAL fluid using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were assayed in duplicate and individual data points 
analyzed and presented as mean values. Cytokine values were log-transformed to obtain a 
normal distribution prior to regression analysis.
Statistical analyses
Sequence data were processed and analyzed using the software mothur v.1.27.0 according to 
the Standard Operating Procedure for 454 and MiSeq sequence data using a minimum 
sequence length of 250 basepairs58,61,62. For each experiment and sequencing run, a shared 
community file and a phylotyped (genus-level grouping) file were generated using 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) binned at 97% identity generated using the dist.seqs, 
cluster, make.shared and classify.otu commands in mothur. OTU numbers were arbitrarily 
assigned in the binning process and are referred to throughout the manuscript in association 
with their most specified level of taxonomy. Classification of OTUs was carried out using 
the mothur implementation of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier and the 
RDP taxonomy training set 9 (fasta reference = trainset9_032012.pds.fasta, taxonomy 
reference = trainset9_032012.pds.tax), available on the mothur website. Sequences are 
available via the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (accession numbers SRP067346 and 
SRP067513).
We performed microbial ecology analysis using the vegan package 2.0-4 and mvabund in 
R14,15,63. For relative abundance and ordination analysis, samples were normalized to the 
percent of total reads and we restricted analysis to OTUs that were present at greater than 
1% of the sample population; all OTUs were included in diversity analysis. Direct 
community similarity comparisons were performed using the Jaccard similarity index. We 
performed ordinations using Principal Component Analysis on Hellinger-transformed

 normalized OTU tables generated using Euclidean distances64. We determined significance 
of differences in community composition using PERMANOVA (adonis) with 1000 
permutations using Euclidean distance matrix. We performed all analyses in R and 
GraphPad Prism 6. We compared means via paired t-test and paired ANOVA with Tukey’s 
multiple comparisons test as appropriate. Linear regressions between relative abundances 
and cytokine concentrations were performed using log-transformed cytokine concentrations 
and adjusted for intrasubject correlations. Permutation analysis using serial exclusion of 
subjects was performed to confirm that significance did not depend on the inclusion of 
outliers. Investigators were not blinded to intervention status of specimens during analysis.
In the first sequencing run (454, ARDS BALs), we obtained 1587 ± 1085 reads per 
specimen and no specimens were excluded from analysis. In the second sequencing run 
(MiSeq, CLP, 24 hour time point), we obtained 26,440 ± 38,804 reads per specimen. Four 
specimens, all blood, had too few reads to interpret (range 5–19 reads) and were excluded 
from analysis. In the third sequencing run (MiSeq, CLP, extended time points), we obtained 
23,725 ± 33,792 reads per specimen. Nine specimens were excluded from analysis because 
they had too few reads to interpret (range 16–237 reads): four blood specimens, two cecum 
specimens, two reagent control specimens, one feces specimen and two lung specimens.

Identification of procedural contaminants
Reagents used in DNA isolation and library preparation contain bacterial DNA that can 
contaminate sequence-based studies of microbial communities65. To identify potential 
sources of contamination in sequencing, we collected multiple procedural controls, 
including sterile water used in tissue collection (exposed to instruments used in harvesting 
and tissue homogenization), sterile water used in library preparation, and AE buffer used in 
DNA isolation. Procedural and environmental control specimens from the collection of 
human BAL specimens were not collected at the time of sampling and were not analyzed, 
including bronchoscope rinse specimens, endotracheal tube specimens, and sterile (pre-
lavage) saline. These procedural controls and mock community standards were analyzed as 
quality controls in each sequencing run. Specimens were processed in a randomized order to

 minimize the risk of false pattern formation due to reagent contamination65. The presence of 
bacterial DNA in all procedural controls was confirmed in all three sequencing runs. In the 
first sequencing run (human ARDS BAL specimens), both sterile water used in specimen 
processing and AE buffer from the DNA isolation kit were sequenced. Sequences detected in 
procedural control specimens were significantly distinct from sequences detected in both 
ARDS BAL specimens and healthy subject BALs (P ≤ 0.001 for both). The dominant taxa in 
procedural control specimens were a Lachnospiraceae sp. (OTU036) and an unclassified 
OTU (OTU016), which comprised a mean of 22.1% of sequences in procedural controls but 
only 0.44% of sequences in BAL specimens. The Bacteroidetes sp. discussed in Results 
(OTU009) was not detected in any of the eight procedural control specimens (0% of total 
sequences). In the second experiment (CLP, 24-hour timepoint), procedural control 
specimen communities were distinct from all tissue communities (P < 0.05 for blood, P < 
0.004 for all other organ sites). The most abundant OTUs in procedural controls (comprising 
a mean of 45.1% of sequences) were an Acinetobacter sp. (OTU030), a Pelomonas sp. 
(OTU023), an unclassified OTU (OTU100) and a Clostridium sp. (OTU009). These were 
common and abundant in blood specimens (comprising a mean of 19.0% of sequences) but 
infrequent and in low abundance in colon, tongue and lung specimens (comprising a mean of 
1.6% of sequences). In the third experiment (CLP, extended timepoints), all types of 
procedural control specimen communities were distinct from the communities of all tissue 
types (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). All procedural control specimens were dominated by 
a single Pseudomonas sp. (OTU004) that comprised a mean of 46.7% of reads; its presence 
both in specimen collection water and in kit reagent specimens confirmed that it was 
introduced in sequencing preparation rather than upstream in the tissue collection step. It 
was excluded from analysis; this was the only OTU excluded from any analysis in this study. 
The Bacteroidales sp. (OTU008) discussed in Results was detected in only one of fourteen 
procedural control specimens, and comprised a mean of only 0.11% of all sequences.

 Figure 1. 
Altered lung microbiota 24 hours after experimental sepsis. Abdominal sepsis was induced 
in mice via cecal ligation and puncture, and lung bacterial communities were sequenced and 
analyzed after 24 hours. (a) The lungs of post-sepsis mice contained increased species 
richness compared to untreated mice, consistent with immigration of new species. (b) 
Relative abundance of bacteria in the lung microbiome following sepsis. The 20 most 
abundant operational taxonomic units detected in post-sepsis lungs are shown across 
experimental arms. Asterisks indicate OTUs significantly enriched in post-sepsis lungs 
compared to control groups. (c) Gut-lung community similarity after sepsis. For each mouse, 
the community similarity was calculated for paired lung and colon communities. Four mice 
were used in each intervention group. Group means and standard errors of the mean are 
depicted. Statistical significance was determined with two-way analysis of variation 
(ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. * P ≤ 0.05. Values presented as means ± 
standard error of the mean. Significance in 1c reflects overall effect of intervention on 
community richness; between-group differences were not significant after controlling for 
multiple comparisons.

 Figure 2. 
Transient alteration of the lung microbiome after experimental sepsis. Mice were exposed to 
abdominal sepsis (cecal ligation and puncture and imipenem) and compared at multiple 
timepoints to three experimental control groups: untreated, imipenem only, and imipenem 
with sham surgery. (a) Five days after exposure, bacterial communities in the lungs of post-
sepsis mice were distinct from those of all control groups. (b) Lung communities of post-
sepsis mice were distinct from untreated mice after five days but indistinguishable at 2 and 8 
weeks following injury.

 Figure 3. 
Evidence suggesting gut-lung translocation after experimental sepsis. (a) The bacterial 
communities of post-sepsis lungs were dominated by an uncultured bacterium, OTU008 
(Bacteroidales sp.) that normalized after 2 weeks. This bacterium did not dominate the 
bacterial communities detected in simultaneously collected tongue specimens. (b) This 
Bacteroidales sp. was of minimal abundance in reagent control specimens, but was the most 
abundant community member in all lower gastrointestinal sites of mice before injury. (c) 
This Bacteroidales sp. was not detected by culture, but Enterococcus faecalis (the second 
most abundant species detected in the lungs of mice 5 days after sepsis) was isolated via 
aerobic culture from the lungs of all post-sepsis mice 5 days after injury. It was not isolated 
from the lungs of any control group, including mice exposed to direct lung injury via 
intratracheal LPS instillation. Statistical significance was determined by Kruskal–Wallis 
one-way analysis of variance with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test (a, c). Values presented 
as means ± standard error of the mean. Six mice were used in each intervention arm and 
timepoint. PBS: phosphate-buffered saline. LPS: lipopolysaccharide.

 Figure 4. 
Evidence suggesting gut-lung translocation of bacteria in humans with the acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS). A Bacteroides sp. (OTU009), a representative of most abundant 
bacterial genus in the human gut microbiome, was absent from reagent control specimens 
and the lungs of healthy subjects, but common (33% of specimens) in the lungs of patients 
with ARDS (a). The relative abundance of this Bacteroides sp. was positively correlated 
with serum TNF-α but not associated with alveolar TNF-α (b). By contrast, alveolar TNF-α 
was positively correlated with relative abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum and 
negatively correlated with the Bacteroidetes phylum (c). 100 bronchoalveolar lavage 
specimens from 68 unique patients were studied. Statistical significance was determined by 
linear regression using logarithmically-transformed cytokine data (b, c).
