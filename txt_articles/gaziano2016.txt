Abstract
Objective: To describe the design and ongoing conduct of the Million Veteran Program (MVP), as an observational cohort study and
mega-biobank in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.
Study Design and Setting: Data are being collected from participants using questionnaires, the VA electronic health record, and a
blood sample for genomic and other testing. Several ongoing projects are linked to MVP, both as peer-reviewed research studies and as
activities to help develop an infrastructure for future, broad-based research uses.
Results: Formal planning for MVP commenced in 2009; the protocol was approved in 2010, and enrollment began in 2011. As of
August 3, 2015, and with a steady state of z50 recruiting sites nationwide, N 5 397,104 veterans have been enrolled. Among
N 5 199,348 with currently available genotyping data, most participants (as expected) are male (92.0%) between the ages of 50 and 69 years
(55.0%). On the basis of self-reported race, white (77.2%) and African American (13.5%) populations are well represented.
Conclusions: By helping to promote the future integration of genetic testing in health care delivery, including clinical decision making,
the MVP is designed to contribute to the development of precision medicine.

1. Introduction
Progress in biomedical research, informatics, and
medical care is merging in the 21st century, providing
an enhanced ability to understand how genes affect
health and disease. Activities such as the Human Genome
Project [1], Hap Map project [2,3], single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) Consortium [4], and 1,000 Ge-
nomes [5] establish a framework for understanding the
human genome across populations. Technological ad-
vances in genotyping and sequencing have improved
the quality, and lowered the cost, of analyzing genetic
data. In addition, the emergence of ‘‘personalized’’ or
‘‘precision’’ medicine has increased interest in inte-
grating genetic testing within health care delivery [6],
and a US Precision Medicine Initiative [7] was recently
announced.

 What is new?
Key finding
� An observational cohort study design can be com-
bined with an electronic health record system and
genomic laboratory testing to create a mega-
biobank.
What this adds to what was known?
� An epidemiologic research infrastructure and data-
base, currently including almost 400,000 enrollees,
is embedded within the national health care system
operated by the US Department of Veterans
Affairs.
� Two alpha-test projects are ongoing; four solicited
beta-test projects have been approved.
What is the implication and what should change
now?
� Researchers and clinicians should be prepared to
understand, evaluate, and interpret genomic studies
that
will
inform
the
practice
of
‘‘precision
medicine.’’
1.1. Epidemiologic context
Initial research efforts in this field have included studies
that use a prospective observational cohort study design.
Examples include the population-based Cohorts for Heart
and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium
[8], as well as the National Cancer Institute Cohort Con-
sortium [9]. Such consortia can analyze collected data
among subsets of patients with and without a given disease,
and then study gene-health associations, often using case-
control analytic frameworks. Limitations exist, however,
related to available health outcomes, the scope of medical
data collected, and even the numbers of ‘‘case’’ patients
with a specific disease or trait.
The emergence of large repositories of data on health
and disease within electronic health record systems pro-
vides another opportunity for studying the genomic-health
association. This approach can include cross-sectional or
longitudinal health data, yet at lower costs per participant
compared to primary data collection. A cursory review of
large genomic initiatives around the worlddsuch as the
UK Biobank [10e12], similar efforts at Vanderbilt Univer-
sity [13], the Kaiser Permanente Research Program on
Genes, Environment, and Health [14], the China Kadoorie
Biobank [15], as well as othersdreveal several key features
for establishing these large-scale projects. For example, to
increase sample size and manage costs, BioVU at Vander-
bilt University links medical record data with residual
clinical specimens deposited in a repository, using an
‘‘opt-out’’ strategy for patients to actively remove them-
selves from the study. This strategy, although efficient,
has limitations regarding longitudinal data and information
on lifestyle factors. The UK Biobank and Kaiser Perma-
nente projects combine questionnaires (as in traditional
cohorts) with electronic medical record data, using an
‘‘opt-in’’ strategy
requiring
active
consent.
The
UK
Biobank included in-person study visits and blood speci-
mens; the Kaiser Permanente effort recruits, consents,
and collects data via the Web, with saliva specimens sent
in by mail.
1.2. Health system context
The UK Biobank and Kaiser Permanente initiatives exist
within larger health care systems thatdas with the Veterans
Health Administration (VHA)dinvolve the integration of
health care delivery. Although large-scale genomic research
holds promise for any health care system, only a fraction of
systems possess key elements for successful execution,
such as (1) available study population; (2) infrastructure
for carrying out scientific, regulatory, technological, and
administrative needs of research; (3) capacity for longitudi-
nal collection of data (with history, physical examination,
laboratory, diagnostic information); (4) follow-up for clin-
ical outcomes; (5) availability of a genetic and serum bio-
bank that can centrally store and retrieve specimens for
use in future research projects; and (6) retention of partic-
ipants in the program over time.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is an appro-
priate setting to construct a mega-biobank, as well as to
conduct genomic research. The VHA is the largest inte-
grated national health system in the country, and most of
the health care experience of the veterans who use the sys-
tem has been captured electronically for many years. Other
strengths of the VA include an altruistic Veteran population,
over 100 research-ready medical centers, a state-of-the-art
biorepository, a bioinformatics infrastructure to enable
secure access to genetic and medical data, and an intramu-
ral clinical research network is embedded in the health care
environment, serving to support the overall health care
mission of VHA.
As of the early 2000s, genomic research activities in
the VA had already included the creation of a DNA Bank,
managed by the VA Cooperative Studies Program (CSP),
to support genetic studies among participants enrolled in
multisite
clinical
trials
[16].
Subsequent
discussions
focused on the creation of a primary resource for genomic
analyses. Preliminary planning included two surveys that
solicited stakeholder input on establishing such a resource
[17,18]. The results indicated that Veterans tended to be
supportive of a VA-based initiative involving research on
genomics, preferred a direct consent (‘‘opt-in’’) approach,
and wanted assurances that their data would be kept
secure.

 1.3. Objective
Envisioned as a VA-based mega-biobank, the Million
Veteran Program (MVP) was launched to establish a na-
tional, representative, and longitudinal study of Veterans
for future genomic (and nongenomic) research that com-
bines data from survey instruments, the electronic health re-
cord, and biospecimens. This article describes the design
and conduct of MVP, as well as the initial experience
regarding enrollment. When applicable, general consider-
ations and lessons are highlighted to facilitate understand-
ing of the challenges encountered.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Overview
The overarching objective of MVP is to improve under-
standing of how health is affected by genetic characteris-
tics, behaviors, and environmental factors. The ultimate
goal of MVP, by providing a framework for scientifically
valid and clinically relevant genomic medicine, is to
enhance the care of the Veteran population. Veterans who
volunteer provide a blood sample for biobanking and re-
sponses to questionnaires; they also consent to allow access
to clinical data from VA electronic health records and other
sources and to be recontacted by MVP staff for (potential)
further data collection or future studies.
2.2. Organizational structure
Various resources, organizational frameworks, and pre-
liminary activities in the VA Office of Research and Devel-
opment served as a foundation for this work. For example,
the CSP has a best-practice planning process for multisite
studies, rooted in the principle that large-scale efforts
require an upfront investment to help ensure that scientific,
administrative, technical, and regulatory considerations are
properly addressed. This process also places a priority on
identifying primary and secondary study goals, outlining
a plan for recruitment and data collection, and assessing
available resources for project execution.
For MVP, the planning effort was led by a group of
patient-oriented and laboratory-based researchers from
VA Central Office and several CSP centers of excellence
(Epidemiology Centers) in epidemiological and population
research. Recognizing current limitations in replication ef-
forts and overall power in genetics researchdand with
MVP representing an infrastructure program rather than a
cause-effect studyda target of up to one million was
selected. This sample size also enables representativeness
across the entire health care system and facilitates a broad
range of research topics. Experience with CSP clinical trials
and observational studies, although with smaller sample
sizes, suggested that recruitment activities, coupled with
informatics capabilities, were scalable to achieve the target.
As the project was being launched, an MVP Steering
Committee (including members of the original Planning
Committee) was created to monitor the operations of
MVP, under the auspices of the VA Office of Research
and Development. The Steering Committee is supported
by five Subcommittees, overseeing issues related to recruit-
ment; general policies and access to data; epidemiology
and phenotyping; molecular and biochemical analyses;
and informatics and information technology.
Day-to-day activities are managed by two VA Genomic
Coordinating Centers, one based at the Massachusetts Vet-
erans Epidemiology Research and Information Center
(MAVERIC) & CSP Coordinating Center in Boston, MA,
and the second based at the Clinical Epidemiology
Research Center (CERC) & CSP Coordinating Center in
West Haven, CT. Activities regarding recruitment, the VA
Central Biorepository, and the Genomic Information Sys-
tem for Integrative Science (GenISIS) as the informatics
backbone, are based mainly at the MAVERIC in Boston.
Activities regarding scanning and monitoring of informed
consent and Health Insurance Portability and Account-
ability Act (HIPAA) documents, MVP site administration
and budgets, and applied projects are based mainly at the
CERC in West Haven. Numerous activities are shared by
both centers; all activities have back-up staffing to promote
continuous operations. In addition, an Information Center
located in Canandaigua, NY, is available during business
hours to address questions about the program from Veter-
ans, schedule appointments for a study visit, and assist re-
cruiting staff at MVP sites.
Field recruiting sites are located currently at a steady
state of approximately 50 VA medical facilities throughout
the country. Central management and administration occurs
through a model in which the MVP Principal Investigators
(J.M.G. and J.C.) jointly oversee sites and day-to-day oper-
ations on the basis of their leadership roles at the CSP
Coordinating Centers. Overall financial management, com-
munications, and public relations activities are based in VA
Central Office in Washington, DC. The VA Central institu-
tional review board (IRB) that oversees the project is also
located in Washington, DC.
2.3. Stakeholder input
Given the scope of planned activities, a major goal was
to inform internal and external stakeholders before project
initiation. Key first steps during the planning stages of the
project were (as mentioned previously) surveys of Veterans
[17,18], and briefings to various levels of leadership within
VHA and VA, as well as to Congressional staff. In addition,
information was provided, and input was sought, from Vet-
eran Service Organizations at the local and national levels.
During this process, discussions of regulatory, ethical, and
methodological topics continued to occur, to ensure that
critical Human Subjects research considerations were ad-
dressed. Critical elements in subsequent planning centered
216
J.M. Gaziano et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 70 (2016) 214e223
 on data security, confidentiality/privacy, and participant
convenience as identified in the stakeholder surveys.
2.4. Recruitment
The source population is defined as active users of the
VHA, with the ability to provide informed consent as the
only inclusion criterion (see informed consent document
at http://www.research.va.gov/MVP/). Access to relevant
VA databases (in accordance with VA policies) for gener-
ating contact lists of potential participants has been ob-
tained. Recruitment is currently occurring in person at
selected sites in the VHA health care system. Every Veteran
is assigned a study ID number, which is used to track them
throughout the entire process of recruitment, enrollment,
sample collection and use; this approach also provides a
level of protection for personal identifiers from the outset.
As shown in Fig. 1, the primary strategy for recruitment
begins with Veterans being informed about the MVP study
via an invitation letter, explaining that participation in the
study involves completing questionnaires, providing a
blood sample for future research, allowing ongoing access
to medical records and other health administrative data by
authorized MVP staff, and agreeing to future contact by
MVP staff (including for possible follow-up studies). The
phone number for the MVP Information Center is also pro-
vided, to answer any questions about the study. Veterans are
asked to complete and return a ‘‘Baseline Survey’’ (with a
corresponding waiver of informed consent) that is included
in the invitational mailing. If not amenable to participation,
Veterans are asked either to return the invitation letter with
an ‘‘I do not want to participate’’ box checked, or to decline
by calling the toll-free number for MVP information. Vet-
erans also have the option to indicate interest in being con-
tacted at a later date.
If a Veteran indicates their willingness to come into a
VA facility for a study visit, an appointment letter is mailed
along with a brochure describing information contained in
the informed consent document. Efforts are made to
schedule a study visit in conjunction with existing VA
clinic appointments that are already scheduled in the up-
coming 3 months. If the selected day or time is not conve-
nient, the participant is asked to contact the MVP
Information Center to reschedule the appointment. If a
response is not received from the initial mailing within a
3-week period, a second (similar) invitation mailing is sent.
Given that a primary goal of the MVP is to enroll up to
one million Veterans who use the VA Health care System,
new strategies continue to be developed. In particular,
and at all of the recruitment sites, Veterans are currently be-
ing encouraged to ‘‘walk-in’’ and learn about the program.
This strategy includes active approaches, such as having
study personnel discuss MVP face-to-face with Veterans
and VA clinicians, as well as passive approaches, such as
postings in high traffic locations throughout each facility.
Potential participants are given adequate time to review
and discuss the informed consent document and the study
at the time of the (impromptu) study visit. If the patient
is undecided about enrolling, a study visit may be sched-
uled for a later date. Ongoing recruitment efforts are
centered at hospital-based locations, with recruitment also
at authorized community-based outpatient clinics.
On the day of the study visit, prospective enrollees
report to the study site to meet with a member of the study
team. During the informed consent process, research staff
discuss the purpose, methods, (minimal) risks, and (future)
benefits of MVP with the Veteran. If the Veteran agrees to
participate, informed consent and an HIPAA authorization
are obtained. At the time of the visit, participants are asked
to complete the Baseline Survey if they had not done so
already, and a blood specimen is collected. An optional
‘‘Lifestyle Survey’’ questionnaire is given at the conclusion
of study visit, or may be mailed to them afterward, and par-
ticipants are asked to complete the document.
In additiontosendinga letter thankingenrolledparticipants
for their efforts, engagement with enrolled Veterans is main-
tained through the MVP newsletters, which are sent out at
approximately yearly intervals, with information on research
involving MVP, descriptive information, and researcher
interviews. The newsletters also include contact information
to allow participants to ask questions about the study.
2.5. Survey instruments

 in the electronic health record of each participant. As with
other study activities and all study materials sent to partic-
ipants, these documents were approved by the VA Central
IRB. As participants are enrolled, informed consent and HI-
PAA authorization forms are scanned by field site staff and
sent to the CERC, to be checked for accuracy and
completeness, and the data are entered in GenISIS.
Conceptually, the MVP Baseline Survey was designed to
collect information regarding demographics, family pedi-
gree, health status, lifestyle habits, military experience,
medical history, family history of specific illnesses, and
physical features. The MVP Lifestyle Survey contains
questions from validated instruments in domains selected
to provide information on sleep and exercise habits, envi-
ronmental exposures, dietary habits, and sense of well-
being. (See Supplementary Material/Appendix at www.
jclinepi.com for the questionnaire instruments and related
source documents.)
2.6. Specimens for biobanking
Blood specimens, after collection by phlebotomists, are
sent to the VA Central Biorepository in Boston, MA, where
they are banked until they are used. Collection kits contain-
ing the necessary supplies for drawing, packaging, and
shipping of the requested sample are mailed to study
personnel at each participating site. Peripheral blood is
placed in 10-mL EDTA blood collection tubes labeled with
a bar code, sealed in a cold shipper, and shipped (adhering
to Federal regulations) by overnight courier to the bio-
repository for processing. The sender notifies the bio-
repository laboratory personnel of incoming shipments.
Handling of specimens follows established standard
operating procedures. Specimens are processed on the
day they arrive; plasma, buffy coat, and DNA are stored
in nitrogen freezers for future use. All specimen tubes are
labeled with 2D coding labels for automated reading.
2.7. Genomic analyses
MVP was designed to enable scientific investigations that
include genotyping, whole-exome sequencing, and whole-
genome sequencing analyses. Corresponding contracts have
been executed (according to applicable VA policies) with
vendors to conduct genotyping and sequencing work. In this
context, an Affymetrix Axiom Biobank Array, with approx-
imately 723K markers, is the ‘‘MVP chip’’ for genotyping.
This array (1) is enriched for exome SNPs; (2) has tag SNPs
validated for diseases, including psychiatric traits; and (3)
has been augmented with biomarkers of specific interest to
the VA population including enrichment for African Amer-
ican and Hispanic ancestry markers, as well as validated
markers for common diseases (such as hypertension, prostate
cancer, and breast cancer). This approach allows for the gen-
otyping of a manageable and targeted number of SNPs at a
very low costdpermitting a much larger number of samples
to be evaluated. (See Supplementary Material/Appendix at
www.jclinepi.com for details of the ‘‘core’’ Affymetrix prod-
uct.) Future plans also include proteomic analyses.
2.8. Data collection and storage
The GenISIS is the informatics infrastructure for storage,
integration, retrieval, and analysis of MVP data. GenISIS has
four main functions: assist in recruitment activities, track
MVP-collected specimens, provide secure data storage,
and maintain a secure computing environment for future
research analyses. In addition, tools have been developed
within GenISIS that allow data extraction from the VA elec-
tronic health record to be incorporated into analytical efforts.
The work flow for study documents follows a defined
pathway, as shown in Fig. 2. The informed consent and HI-
PAA documents are faxed to the Coordinating Center in
West Haven, CT, where image files are stored on a LAN
server behind the VA firewall. Collected data are uploaded
daily to the other Coordinating Center in Boston, MA, and
incorporated into the GenISIS platform. Data from the

 Baseline and Lifestyle Surveys (without identifying infor-
mation) are scanned by a vendor and also transferred to
the GenISIS platform. Changes in health status of patients
can be tracked longitudinally, to further enhance the value
of the collected and stored genetic samples.
Administrative and health care utilization data on partic-
ipants in the MVP can be extracted from national VA clin-
ical and administrative databases, including the National
Patient Care Database, VA-Medicare/Medicaid merge, na-
tional Laboratory and Pharmacy extracts, Corporate Data
Warehouse (Health Data Repository), Medical Domain
Web Services, Patient Care Services Clinical Data Ware-
house, Veteran Informatics and Computing Infrastructure,
VHA Support Service Center, VA Cancer Registry, and
the VA Vital Status File. Additional information on dece-
dents from non-VA databases may be collected from data-
bases such as the National Death Index, and State Vital
Statistic Registries. These data can be downloaded and
transferred, with appropriate permissions, for use in the
GenISIS Scientific Database in accordance with VA pol-
icies. Patients also agree to be contacted for possible
(voluntary) participation in future MVP-related studies.
2.9. Confidentiality
Confidentiality of participant data is a paramount
concern. Participants are assigned a participant study ID,
and specimens are labeled with a preprinted numeric label
(specimen code), lacking any participant identifiers. The
data linking the specimen code to the participant’s study
ID are entered into a password-protected and encrypted
(‘‘crosswalk’’) database. When the specimen reaches the
VA Central Biorepository, the specimen code is replaced
by a biobank code. The link between the specimen code
and bank code is sent to the Coordinating Center and
entered into the crosswalk database. Therefore, the study
sites, the VA Central Biorepository, as well as (future) in-
vestigators using the data, do not have the ability to link
a specimen to each participant’s identity.
GenISIS systems and data access are controlled by roles
and permissions authorized at the individual-user level,
with data and servers behind the VA firewall. All informa-
tion on biosample collection, shipment, sample processing,
and storage are tracked in a Laboratory Information Man-
agement System that is connected to GenISIS.
2.10. Data security
As per the processes described previously, the MVP data-
base contains information from the participant’s medical re-
cord, DNA (genotyping or sequencing data), and MVP
questionnaires; these data are a limited data set, as defined
by HIPAA. The participant’s date of birth is not entered into
the database, but other dates (eg, dates of service, deploy-
ment, discharge, diagnoses, treatments) are available. Only
a limited number of VA employees have access to that data-
base, and encryption is maintained. In addition, all applicable
VHA policies and procedures regarding data, data reposi-
tories, privacy, and information security are followed.
Written information is stored in locked file cabinets, in
locked and secure areas. Given that the genetic and other
tests are being done for research purposes only, information
about the participant’s DNA is not entered into the partici-
pant’s electronic medical record. A Certificate of Confiden-
tiality issued by the Public Health Service, Department of
Health and Human Services, has also been obtained to help
ensure the privacy of the participant’s identity and data.
With this certificate, researchers cannot be forced (e.g.,
by court-ordered subpoena) to disclose information that
may identify the participant in federal, state, or local civil,
criminal, administrative, legal, or other proceedings. Em-
ployees who have access to VHA records are instructed
and trained on the requirements of Federal privacy and in-
formation laws, and regulations, as well as VA and VHA
regulations and policies.
2.11. Ethics
Consent is obtained in accordance with all VA policies and
under the authority of the VA Central IRB. Subsequent
research, using MVP samples and/or data, will also require
IRB approval and oversight from applicable entities, depend-
ing on the scope of the proposed study and the source of fund-
ing. As mentioned, genomics research in MVP is exploratory
in nature and is not a clinically validated test performed in a
CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of
1988) certified laboratory; research results are therefore not
disclosed to participants nor their clinicians.
2.12. Safety plan
MVP is an observational (i.e., noninterventional), longitu-
dinal study, and poses minimal risk to participants. The local
sites are responsible for ensuring participants’ safety and
following appropriate reporting procedures. Reporting of
Adverse Events (AEs) related to study procedures include
anticipated events related to phlebotomy (e.g., bruising, light-
headedness, or fainting),andfeelings of anxiety or discomfort
while answering survey questions. The Coordinating Centers
are responsible for monitoring participant safety data; evalu-
ating progress of the study; reviewing procedures for project
management, statistical analyses, the quality of data collec-
tion, and maintaining the confidentiality of study data; and
following appropriate reporting procedures. Local sites and
the Coordinating Centers report unanticipated problems
involving risks, and any potential unanticipated serious AEs.
3. Results
3.1. Launch of study
Formal planning for MVP commenced in 2009, including
piloting of proposed strategies. The MVP protocol was
219
J.M. Gaziano et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 70 (2016) 214e223
 approved by the VA Central IRB in 2010, and enrollment
began in early 2011 at VA facilities in Boston, MA, and West
Haven, CT. The Program later expanded to seven additional
vanguard sites that provided feedback on best-practice proce-
dures. Subsequently, and in several waves, sites were added to
reach a steady state of approximately 50 locations (Fig. 3).
Sites are selected on the basis of availability of research infra-
structure and the pool of eligible veterans.
3.2. Interim enrollment
As of August 3, 2015, N 5 3,002,336 Veterans have been
contacted by mail, and N 5 495,140 baseline questionnaires
have been received; N 5 397,104 participants have provided
informed consent and blood samples. From the perspective
of the protocol-based strategy for reaching potential partici-
pants, the study has a response rate of 13.2% (397,104/
3,002,336), with additional contact attempts for some pa-
tients still pending. Among enrollees, 50.1% enrolled at a
scheduled appointment; the remaining 49.9% were ‘‘walk-
ins’’ at a study site. As a follow-up and optional component,
N 5 200,098 lifestyle questionnaires have been received.
Cumulative enrollments costs were approximately $61
million for fiscal years (FYs) 2010e2015.
3.3. Genomic data
Initial emphasis has been placed on genotyping data for
N 5 199,348 participants (as well as several thousand
duplicate samples) generated as of October 2014; plans
include genotyping of approximately 200,000 additional
samples by October 2015. Subsets of these samples are also
undergoing
whole-exome
sequencing
(approximately
N 5 28,000) and whole-genome sequencing (approxi-
mately N 5 2,000), for future applications of the MVP
infrastructure. The cumulative costs for these completed
and pending genomic analyses were approximately $55
million for FYs 2010e2015.
3.4. Characteristics of participants
Table 1, summarizing baseline characteristics of partici-
pants, indicates that the age and sex distribution among
N 5 199,348 enrollees with currently available genotyping
data are consistent with the population receiving health care
from the VHA; most of the participants are male (92.0%),
and a majority (55.0%) are between the ages of 50 and 69
years. Table 1 also summarizes results for selected baseline
factors, on the basis of N 5 224,610 enrolled participants

 with returned baseline questionnaires and ‘‘cleaned’’ (vali-
dated) data. Most enrollees are white (77.2%); the African
American
population
(13.5%)
is
well
represented.
Regarding military service characteristics, 43.8% of partic-
ipants reported service in the Army, 19.6% in the Navy,
15.5% in the Air Force, 11.3% in the Marines, and the
remainder other, multiple, or not reported.
Table 2 lists the 20 most common self-reported condi-
tions (N 5 224,610), with this information also serving
as preliminary prevalence data for potential MVP investiga-
tors. Prominent health conditions are well represented,
including hypertension (62.9%), hyperlipidemia (56.6%),
depression (28.4%), diabetes (27.0%), and sleep apnea
(24.5%). These data are linked to electronic health record
information, providing a basis for validation when pheno-
typing activities are conducted for MVP-based studies.
3.5. Applied projects
As an MVP-based, alpha-test activity, a linked but sepa-
rate ongoing project [19] of schizophrenia and bipolar dis-
order has enrolled over N 5 9,500 ‘‘case’’ patients, to be
matched 1:1 with ‘‘control’’ patients from MVP who do
not have corresponding diagnoses nor evidence of medica-
tions for those disorders. A genome-wide association study
(GWAS) will investigate genetic risk factors for schizo-
phrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as for corresponding
functional disability.
As a second and entirely intra-MVP alpha-test activity, a
GWAS of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is under-
way. Determination of whether a participant has PTSD,
or not, is being done using the electronic health record
and data from MVP questionnaires, but without direct pa-
tient contact (except for a small validation study). This
project highlights the challenges and represents the initial
opportunity, of determining phenotype (e.g., case-control
status) using database information.
To expand the scope of MVP, an intramural, VA-based
Request
for
Applications
(RFAs)
was
announced
in
September 2014, with an emphasis on phenotyping experi-
ence and a focus on encouraging consortia of investigators
(to combine relevant expertise in VA facilities across the
country). Among 30 proposals, four beta-test projectsd
addressing cardiac, metabolic, renal, and substance abuse
disordersdwere approved in the Spring 2015 review cycle.
Future RFAs are planned (details pending). Long-term
goals include conducting randomized trials based on results
from MVP, as well as developing systems for returning
research results to clinicians providing direct patient care.
3.6. Access to MVP data and/or samples by
investigators
Access to MVP data and/or samples is governed by the
scopeofMVPinformed consentandVA policies,andrequires
scientific review by appropriate VA review committees. At

 this time, VA-paid or Without Compensation (university-
affiliated) investigators are eligible to use MVP data; phased
expansion, including future access to non-VA investigators,
is envisioned as the computational infrastructure expands.
The current access process includes several elements. First,
potential users can request, obtain permission, and search
metadata (with or without technical assistance) to perform
initial queries and other project-building activities. Second,
and after a study population is defined, the researcher can
request approval to receive detailed data, as a specific data
mart that provides limited access (only to their study group
and only for the identified subset of data) for proposal devel-
opment. Third, and following approval of the proposal
through peer-review, each study-specific data mart is then
connected to the analysis environment with a high-
performance computer cluster and a standard set of bioinfor-
matics tools. Fourth, and after the analysis is complete, the
researcher is expected to retain key findings in GenISIS, with
data and analysis routines to be made searchable by future re-
searchers (in subsequent studies), and with corresponding
publications also uploaded. Cumulative investments in infra-
structure to support ongoing and future analyses totaled
approximately $30 million during FYs 2010e2015.
4. Discussion
4.1. Historical perspective
Research using a longitudinal cohort design has tradi-
tionally involved a baseline evaluation, combined with pro-
spective follow-up of the participants for the development
of clinical outcomes. The design of MVP, as with other
mega-cohorts, expands considerably on the data elements
available for each participant. In particular, MVP enables
linking of biobanked genetic and plasma samples to ante-
cedent, as well as subsequent, information in the electronic
health record and is supplemented by questionnaire data on
clinical and lifestyle factors.
4.2. Current challenges
Although attempts to assemble large ‘‘cohorts’’ do not
always succeed [20], the feasibility of MVP has been
confirmed by progress to-date, and plans are ongoing to
expand enrollment (eg, using Web-based, off-site strate-
gies). Of note, interim enrollment in MVP (N z 400,000
as of July 2015) is within the range of similar genomic
mega-biobanks,
including
the
UK
Biobank
(N z 500,000), Kaiser Permanente (N z 200,000), Van-
derbilt BioVU (N z 200,000), and the China Kadoorie
Biobank (N z 500,000); as an example of newer initia-
tives, the Geisinger Health System and Regeneron Pharma-
ceuticals, Inc., launched a genomic collaboration in 2014.
The preexisting VA-based infrastructure can be viewed as
an
enabling
element
for
MVP,
whereas
increasing
complexity
and
administrative
burdens
represent
challenges. The distribution of demographic and clinical
factors reflects the population using the VHA, with over-
representation of older and male Veterans; the nationwide
location of sites contributes to enhanced generalizability.
Opportunities to collaborate with the National Institutes
of Health and the Department of Defense in the Precision
Medicine Initiative are being explored.
4.3. Future potential
From a researcher’s perspective, MVP provides an infra-
structure for collaborations of laboratory scientists, patient-
oriented researchers, and others, with the potential to
conduct research related to biobanked specimens, as well
as tissue specimens that could be obtained from participants
in the future. MVP also provides a framework to potentially
address deployment-health issues and can support the
development of new specialized population samples (such
as Veteran families across more than one generation). From
a clinician’s perspective, understanding how laboratory-
based genomic science is generated and linked to patient-
oriented science represents a framework for evaluating
genomic studiesdas an ‘‘evidence base’’ for providing
effective ‘‘precision medicine’’ [6] to patients in the future.
5. Conclusion
By combining genomic information with medical record
and questionnaire data, MVP represents a valuable resource
to improve the health of, and health care for, US Veterans
and the general population. MVP can contribute to a better
understanding of the role of genes and the environment in
health and disease, and in turn to the transformation of
health care delivery.
