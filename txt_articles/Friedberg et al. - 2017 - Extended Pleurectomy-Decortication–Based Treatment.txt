Abstract
Background—The purpose of this study was to assess survival for patients with malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (MPM), epithelial subtype, utilizing extended pleurectomy-decortication 
combined with intraoperative photodynamic therapy (PDT) and adjuvant pemetrexed-based 
chemotherapy.
Methods—From 2005 to 2013, 90 patients underwent lung-sparing surgery and PDT for MPM. 
All patients had a preoperative diagnosis of epithelial subtype, of which 17 proved to have mixed 
histology. The remaining 73 patients with pure epithelial subtype are analyzed. All patients 
received lung-sparing surgery and PDT. 92% also received chemotherapy. The median follow up 
was 5.3 years for living patients.
Results—Macroscopic complete resection was achieved in all 73 patients. 30 and 90 day 
mortalities were 3% and 4%, respectively. For all 73 patients (89% AJCC Stage III/IV, 69% N2 
disease and median tumor volume 550 ml) the median overall and disease free survivals were 3 
years and 1.2 years, respectively. For the 19 patients without lymph node metastases (74% Stage

 III/IV, median tumor volume 325 ml) the median overall and disease free survivals were 7.3 years 
and 2.3 years, respectively.
Conclusions—This is a mature data set for MPM that demonstrates the ability to safely execute 
a complex treatment plan that included a surgical technique that consistently permitted achieving a 
macroscopic complete resection while preserving the lung. The role for lung-sparing surgery is 
unclear but this series demonstrates that it is an option, even in advanced cases. The overall 
survival of 7.3 years for the node negative subset of patients, still of advanced stage, is 
encouraging. Of particular interest is the overall survival being approximately triple the disease 
free survival, perhaps PDT-related. The impact of PDT is unclear, but hopefully will be established 
by an ongoing randomized trial.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a virulent, incurable cancer. Chemotherapy is the 
standard of care, with survival usually cited in the 12–18 month range {1,2,3}. As a curative 
microscopic (R0) resection is essentially impossible for MPM the goal of surgery is to 
achieve a macroscopic complete resection (MCR), performed as part of a multimodal 
treatment plan. Surgery remains controversial for MPM because it is an operation of 
considerable magnitude that is, technically, palliative and also because reported surgical 
results are often similar to nonsurgical results.
Still, there do appear to be patients who benefit significantly more from a surgery-based 
approach than would be expected from chemotherapy alone, emphasizing the importance of 
patient selection. The art of patient selection for MPM surgery extends beyond the current 
staging system and includes prognosticators like: gender, platelet count, pain, tumor volume 
and, in particular, the subtype of the cancer {4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.
Our surgery-based approach has always included intraoperative photodynamic therapy 
(PDT), but initially included all subtypes of disease and both surgical approaches. We then 
switched exclusively to EPD after comparing our outcomes of extrapleural pneumonectomy 
(EPP) versus EPD {11}. Examining a larger cohort of EPD patients we found that histologic 
subtype was the main prognosticator, but the results still appeared promising for patients 
with large volume disease, advanced stage and bulky adenopathy {12}. This study reports 
the results of EPD, intraoperative PDT and chemotherapy on 73 patients limited to epithelial 
histology but including the unfavorable prognosticators of advanced stage, nodal disease and 
bulk.
Patients and Methods
This study is an analysis of all patients treated on two prospective clinical trials that were 
approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. From 2005 to 2013, 
90 patients underwent lung-sparing surgery and PDT for MPM. All patients had a 
preoperative diagnosis of epithelial subtype, of which 73 ultimately proved to have pure 
epithelial MPM on final pathology and are the subject of this analysis. Our Multidisciplinary

 Mesothelioma Program was started in 2007 and, from its inception, 31% of the patients who 
presented to the Program and had, or were found to have, a diagnosis of epithelioid subtype, 
underwent surgery. The median age was 65 years (range, 38–81 years), and there were 55 
men (75%) and 18 women (25%). All consecutive patients undergoing EPD across two 
prospective trials with two separate photosensitizers, porfimer sodium (52 patients) and 2-
[1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH) (21 patients) were analyzed. It 
was the institutional bias to treat de novo patients with adjuvant pemetrexed-based doublet 
chemotherapy, but 17 patients presented after chemotherapy and were offered surgery (Table 
1). Six patients received a full course of chemotherapy prior to surgery and, therefore, were 
not deemed appropriate for adjuvant chemotherapy. An additional 11 patients were started 
on chemotherapy and received 1–2 cycles of chemotherapy before going on to have their 
definitive resection. All of these patients received additional standard adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Six out of the 73 patients did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy that was 
planned due to post-operative mortality or rapid recurrence of disease and the initiation of 
palliative care”
Preoperative work-up included risk stratification, CT chest, brain imaging and PET scan. 
Most patients also underwent an outpatient invasive staging procedure including 
bronchoscopy and staging laparoscopy, while selected patients also underwent contralateral 
thoracoscopy, triggered by abnormal radiographic findings. Enrollment was broad, including 
patients with bulky nodal disease, frank chest wall invasion and two patients with cancer 
detected on the invasive staging workup (one contralateral pleural/one abdominal) who were 
enrolled after chemotherapy and repeated workup revealed no detectable disease outside of 
the affected hemithorax.
Criteria for enrollment included: epithelial subtype, deemed medically “fit” for surgery, 
disease confined to one hemithorax and convincing demonstration that surgery is not 
standard of care for MPM, as part of informed consent.
Surgical Procedure
The surgical procedure is described elsewhere in detail {13}. All procedures were performed 
by the same surgeon (JSF). Briefly, the default operative plan was that the parietal pleural 
surfaces were mobilized, leaving the specimen tethered to the lung, and then removed en 
bloc with the entire visceral pleura. Every effort was made to preserve diaphragmatic 
musculature and the skeletonized phrenic nerve. Full thickness diaphragm was resected and 
primarily, or absorbable patch, reconstructed. Typically the fibrous pericardium was 
resected, leaving the inner serous layer. Initially full thickness pericardial invasion was 
reconstructed with permanent prosthetic, but later in the series reconstruction was not 
performed. The default was to resect the entire visceral pleura but in rare cases where this 
was not possible, typically minimal involvement, detectable disease was cauterized. When 
the cancer was highly invasive into the lung, typically massive bulk disease, the 
electrocautery used to liberate the specimen with a gross clear parenchymal margin. The 
fissure was always dissected down to the extrapleural plane, typically resulting in 
skeletonization of the pulmonary artery. A lymphadenectomy was performed, which in the 
more recent part of the series included harvesting the posterior intercostal lymph nodes

 (considered N2 for staging). PDT was then performed, delivering light to a predetermined 
dose as measured by strategically placed isotropic light detectors. The technical aspects and 
further discussion regarding PDT have been previously described {11,12,18}. In the later 
part of the series an absorbable lung sealant (Progel™ Pleural Air Leak Sealant, Bard – 
Davol, Inc.) was applied if substantial parenchymal leaks were noted. In the latter part of the 
series, volume of tumor specimens was determined by displacement in saline.
Follow up and statistics
Standard follow-up was an office visit and chest CT every three months. All patients were 
followed and none were lost to follow-up. Patients were treated for recurrence on an 
individualized basis, as determined by discussion at a multidisciplinary conference or per 
their own oncologists. Some patients received multiple different types of treatments. 
Modalities and agents included: vinorelbine, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, cisplatin, 
carboplatin, ad-interferon gene therapy, SS1P immunotherapy, standard photon radiation and 
proton radiation. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from surgery to death from 
any cause or last patient contact. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time 
from surgery to first documented recurrence, death from any cause, or last patient contact. 
Survival and PFS were estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier. The logrank test was 
used to test equality over strata of selected clinical indications. Statistical significance was 
set at 0.05. No adjustments for confounders were included in this analysis. All statistical 
analyses were performed in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patient demographics and survival statistics are summarized in Table 1. Of the 90 patients 
who had a preoperative diagnosis of epithelial subtype, 17 (18%) proved to have mixed 
histology, with MCR achieved in 14/17 (82%). The following analysis relates to the 73 pure 
epithelial patients, all in whom MCR was achieved. Nodal status was: N0 19/74 (26%), N1 
4/74 (5%) and N2 50 (69%). Median tumor volume was measured in a subset of 34 patients 
at 550 ml (range 250–2200 ml) by measuring saline displacement in a graduated beaker. The 
subset of the N0 patients who had tumor volume measured ranged from150–900ml, median 
325ml. Median tumor volume for N positive was 675ml (250–2200ml). Stage breakdown 
was Stage I 2/73 (3%), Stage II 6/73 (8%), Stage III 37/73 (50%) and Stage IV, 28/73 (39%). 
Further breakdown of the N0 group by stage was: T1N0 2/19 (10%), T2N0 3/19 (15%), 
T3N0 11/19 (57%) and T4N0 3/19 15%). The extent of resections and reconstructions is 
summarized in Table 2. The average length of stay was 18.3 days.
Complications
Complications are summarized in Table 3. The 30-day mortality was 2/73 (3%) with an 
additional death yielding a 90-day mortality of 3/73 (4%). The early causes of death were 
stroke and myocardial infarction with cardiac tamponade responsible for the day 37 death. 
Other complications included: atrial fibrillation 21/73 (28%), respiratory failure requiring 
tracheostomy 14/73 (19%), chyle leak 4/73 (5%), deep venous thrombosis 17/73 (23%), 
persistent air leak 17/73 (23%) and discharge with Heimlich valve 2/73 (2%). The 
pneumonia rate of 28% is high. Extra precautions to prevent aspiration were taken and

 attention to pulmonary toilet, including liberal use of bronchoscopy, was routine. The reason 
for this high pneumonia rate, therefore, is unclear, but is potentially related to the use of 
PDT.
SURVIVAL—At a median follow up of 5.3 years for living patients, the OS and DFS for all 
73 patients were 36 and 14 months, respectively (Figure 1). The 18 patients with mixed 
histology died within one year after surgery. When broken down by nodal status, the median 
OS and DFS for N1/2 (93% N2) were 23 and 10 months, respectively, and for N0 disease 
was 87 and 27 months, respectively (Figure 2). Factors associated with worse survival 
included male gender OS 26 versus 57 months (p= 0. 0142) and nodal status with N1/2 
versus N0, OS 23 versus 87 months (p= 0. 0005). Given the advanced stage patient 
population included in our clinical trials, there were not enough early stage patients to 
compare outcomes according to stage grouping. Factors that were not significant with 
survival included: age <65 years versus >65 years OS 40 versus 30 months (p= 0.41), stage 
III versus stage IV OS 30 versus 23 months (p= 0.30), and photosensitizer porfimer sodium 
versus HPPH OS 35 versus 33 months (p=0.72) or preoperative only chemotherapy versus 
postoperative only chemotherapy (6/74, 8% chemotherapy) versus (50/74, 68%) (Table 1). 
There was a small statistically significant difference in overall survival but not progression 
free survival noted if the recurrence was purely local or if there were distant metastases 
(Figure 3). Local and distant progression were seen in 47 of the patients (64.4%) (Table 4 
and 5).
COMMENT
Study limitations
This study suffers the limitations of being retrospective and significant variability in 
chemotherapy administration. Although all patients received PDT, two different 
photosensitizers were used. Quantifiable quality of life measures were not obtained.
Study strengths
Follow-up: At a median follow up of 5.3 years, this is a particularly mature data set for 
MPM. A single surgeon series likely results in more consistency of the largest variable for 
EPD, surgical technique.
Surgery—With a median tumor volume of 550ml, 68% N2 disease and 89% stage III-IV 
patients, this does represent a cohort of advanced patients, including patients requiring chest 
wall resections, bulky nodal disease and tumor volumes greater than 2 liters. A significant 
portion of this series is comprised of patients who are sometimes denied surgery, or at least 
not considered candidates for lung-sparing surgery. Whether or not EPD is the optimal 
approach is debatable, but this study demonstrates that is likely an option for essentially all 
surgical patients in whom MCR can be achieved. Using the described surgical technique 
there has not yet been a patient encountered where central bronchovascular invasion 
mandated EPP to achieve MCR. There were patients with mixed histology in whom MCR 
could not be achieved, but this was secondary to esophageal and/or aortic invasion and 
conversion to pneumonectomy would not have helped.

 Teamwork—PDT is a particularly complex intraoperative adjuvant therapy that clearly 
increases the challenges of postoperative care and for which major complications have been 
reported. Whether or not PDT played a role in these results is unknown, but will hopefully 
be answered by an ongoing randomized trial (NCT02153229). This study does demonstrate, 
however, that even this very complicated treatment plan can be safely executed by a focused 
and dedicated team.
Unique data—The collection of intercostal lymph nodes, previously not described in this 
context, appears to provide information of prognostic significance. For instance, in 4 patients 
only these nodes were positive. As tumor volume appears prognostic, the physical 
measurement of tumor volume provides interesting information, which at a minimum, can 
be used to validate radiographic volume estimation techniques. The use of a lung sealant 
appears to have mitigated persistent air leaks, one of the most vexing complications of EPD. 
While there were still persistent air leaks, 17/73 (23%), the duration of chest tube days 
generally decreased and discharge with Heimlich valves was eliminated once the sealant was 
adopted. Over the course of the study management of fully resected pericardium evolved 
from prosthetic reconstruction to leaving it open in 12% of the patients, without any known 
early or late complications. This simplified surgery and eliminated potential for patch 
contamination/infection in the setting of air leaks. The pneumonia rate of 28% is high. Extra 
precautions to prevent aspiration were taken and attention to pulmonary toilet, including 
liberal use of bronchoscopy, was routine. The reason for this high pneumonia rate is unclear, 
but is potentially related to the use of PDT. These data are superficially incorporated into 
this report, but are the focus of separate upcoming analyses.
Discussion of results
Despite a likely contribution by PDT to the complexity of care and possibly complications, 
morbidity and mortality are within the range of what is reported for similar patients. With 
respect to survival, several interesting results were generated. The OS of 3 years achieved for 
all patients in this advanced stage cohort is consistent with other favorable results in the 
literature {14,15,16}. The DFS of 14 months being less than half the OS is somewhat 
unusual. The presence of distant recurrence versus local recurrence portended a 10-month 
decrease in OS. A greater impact of lymph node status, perhaps a reflection of the more 
mature follow-up, was noted in this analysis than in our previous reports. The presence of 
any positive lymph nodes dropped the OS to approximately two years, but if no lymph nodes 
were involved the median OS was 7.3 years. This last group is particularly interesting as 
75% were male, 68% were stage III/IV, median measured tumor volume was 325ml and the 
DFS was less than a third of the OS.
Value of this study
The surgical approach that was employed was reproducible and reliably permitted lung 
preservation, to the point where it would potentially allow discrimination between different 
adjuvant approaches. The study identified a cohort of patients, N0 epithelial, who had a 
particularly promising outcome. Nineteen patients, however, is too few to draw any 
definitive conclusions, but this finding is intriguing, especially in light of the OS being more 
than triple the DFS. More commonly, including some recent promising results, the OS and

 DFS are nearly the same {15,16}. This OS/DFS disparity could be related to having two 
lungs instead of one or potentially be a function of an immunologic effect, in this case 
possibly from PDT. In either case it is a phenomenon worth exploring and exploiting if 
possible, attempting to nudge MPM more toward a chronic disease until we have a cure.
Challenges in the field
Recent systemic therapy trials have reported a median survival of 18 months and the 
nonsurgical arm of the MARS trial reported a median survival of 19.5 months for the 
surgical candidates treated medically{2,17}. As we focus on what is important to patients, 
OS and quality of life, perhaps this 18 month range, not “one year” is the OS benchmark that 
should be measured against before declaring a surgery-based approach as beneficial.
Adjuvant therapies are the innovation and potential source of a breakthrough for MPM, but 
it is difficult or impossible to attribute outcomes to adjuvants at this time. Even with a 
consistent surgical platform like EPP, nonstaging prognosticators can confound comparisons 
between series. Lung-sparing surgery is currently so variable that rigorous comparison 
between series is likely impossible.
Where to go
In order to achieve the goal of knowing which patients should have surgery, which adjuvants 
are beneficial and which procedure should be performed, the following steps are necessary:
1.
Techniques and quantification of completeness of resection for EPD needs to be 
refined, defined and standardized. This will allow a lung-sparing approach to be 
used, like EPP, as a stable platform to evaluate adjuvant therapies.
2.
Future series should incorporate whatever new staging system is developed, but 
also carefully track and report non-staging prognosticators. This will allow for 
better comparisons between studies until, hopefully, molecular analyses provide 
definitive guidance.
3.
Quality of life measurements should be routinely obtained and reported. Until 
such time that these operations are curative, this will allow for greater 
discrimination between surgical trials with similar survival results, better 
informed consenting of patients and stronger evidence to define the role of 
surgery.
4.
Shift the goal of treatment to OS with maintenance of quality of life, not local 
control. Until there is a cure, treatments such as immunotherapies that slow 
progression without significant morbidity, may be more desirable than more 
morbid treatments geared toward local control.
5.
Embrace innovative adjuvants and capitalize upon the most promising 
approaches to initiate multicenter trials, paying strict attention to surgical 
consistency and data gathering.

 In conclusion
This study has significant limitations, but validates a surgical approach that consistently 
permitted lung preservation and yielded some promising results, particularly with respect to 
outcomes for the subgroup of advanced stage patients without nodal metastases. The impact 
of nodal metastases and histologic subtype are highlighted by this study, demonstrating the 
importance of appropriate patient selection for MPM surgery. An unusually prolonged 
OS:DFS ratio was observed, an intriguing result worth exploration and exploitation if an 
actionable mechanism is identified. The potential value of intraoperative PDT is again 
raised, a question that should be answered by an ongoing randomized trial. This study 
demonstrates a complicated multimodal treatment plan can be safely executed with 
teamwork. Analysis and critical review of this study reveals areas where generalized 
improvements can be made in surgery-based trials for MPM.

Analysis the effect of lymph node metastases was performed, with patients grouped as either

lymph node metastases was 7.3 years ± 0.16 years vs 1.9 years ± 0.5 years, respectively. 
Progression free survival for patients with or without lymph node metastases was 2.2 years 
± 1.1 years vs 0.8 years ± 0.1 years, respectively.

 Figure 3. Effect of First Treatment Failure Site on Survival and Progression Free Survival
Analysis of patterns of initial treatment failure was performed, with patients grouped as 
either experiencing an initial recurrence involving 1) locoregional site(s) vs 2) distant ± 
locoregional site(s). Overall survival for patients experiencing initial treatment failure at 
only locoregional vs distant ± locoregional site(s) was 2.7 years ± 0.9 years vs 1.9 years 
± 0.9 years, respectively. Progression free survival for patients experiencing only 
locoregional vs distant ± locoregional recurrence(s) was 1.0 years ± 0.3 years vs 1.0 years 
± 0.2 years, respectively.
