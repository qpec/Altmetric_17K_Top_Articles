The naked mole-rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber), which is the longest-lived rodent species,
exhibits extraordinary resistance to cancer. Here we report that NMR somatic cells exhibit a
unique tumour-suppressor response to reprogramming induction. In this study, we generate
NMR-induced pluripotent stem cells (NMR-iPSCs) and find that NMR-iPSCs do not exhibit
teratoma-forming tumorigenicity due to the species-specific activation of tumour-suppressor
alternative reading frame (ARF) and a disruption mutation of the oncogene ES cell-expressed Ras
(ERAS). The forced expression of Arf in mouse iPSCs markedly reduces tumorigenicity.
Furthermore,
we
identify
an
NMR-specific
tumour-suppression
phenotype—ARF
suppression-induced senescence (ASIS)—that may protect iPSCs and somatic cells from
ARF suppression and, as a consequence, tumorigenicity. Thus, NMR-specific ARF regulation
and the disruption of ERAS regulate tumour resistance in NMR-iPSCs. Our findings obtained
from studies of NMR-iPSCs provide new insight into the mechanisms of tumorigenicity in
iPSCs and cancer resistance in the NMR.

 T
he naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber, NMR; Fig. 1a),
a eusocial subterranean mammal native to Africa1, is
the longest-lived rodent (maximum lifespan, 30 years);
its body mass, however, is similar to that of the house mouse
(Mus musculus, Ms)2,3. NMRs exhibit extraordinary resistance
to cancer, which has almost never been detected in long-term
observations of captured NMR colonies2,4. In this study, we
report that NMR somatic cells exhibit a tumour-suppressor
response to reprogramming induction.
Cancer development and cellular reprogramming share several
characteristics, including changes in global gene expression,
epigenetic modification and metabolism5,6. Induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) reprogrammed from somatic cells acquire
pluripotency but also exhibit tumorigenicity similar to that of
embryonic stem cells (ESCs)7,8, which form teratomas in vivo,
representing a major risk factor confronting potential clinical
applications9,10. The expression of many tumour suppressors,
oncogenes and pluripotency genes, including Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and
c-Myc
(OSKM),
contributes
to
both
reprogramming
and
oncogenesis5,11, and the transient in vivo expression of OSKM
has been shown to induce tumours in certain tissues12. These
observations
raise
the
question
of
whether
somatic
cell
reprogramming conferring pluripotency and tumorigenicity can
be induced in cancer-resistant animals, such as the naked mole-rat.
In this study, we generate NMR-iPSCs and show that they do
not exhibit teratoma-forming tumorigenicity. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that this phenotype is the result of the activation of a
tumour-suppressor alternative reading frame (ARF), which is
strongly suppressed in Ms-iPSCs13–15, and a unique frameshift
mutation in ES cell-expressed Ras (ERAS), which positively
regulates
the
tumorigenicity
of
Ms-ESCs16.
Moreover,
we
identify a mechanism that we have termed ‘ARF suppression-
induced senescence’ (ASIS), which appears to be a NMR-specific
tumour-suppression mechanism. This study provides novel
insights
into
NMR
cancer
resistance
and
methods
for
generating safe iPSCs.
Results
Generation of NMR-iPSCs. To induce reprogramming in NMR,
we transduced adult skin fibroblasts (NMR-fibroblasts) using
retroviral vectors expressing Ms OSKM8 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary
Fig. 1a). Within 2–3 weeks, ESC-like colonies appeared in
standard human-ESC medium containing basic fibroblast growth
factor. The alkaline-phosphatase (AP)-positive colony-formation
efficiency of these cells was 0.0029±0.00028% (Supplementary
Fig. 1b). ESC-like colonies were expanded and designated
NMR-iPSCs
(Fig.
1c
and
Supplementary
Fig.
1c).
These
colonies did not form under hypoxic conditions or without the
introduction of c-Myc (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Although small
AP-positive colonies appeared in Ms-ESC medium containing
either leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or LIF/2i (GSK3b and
MEK inhibitors)17, the colonies did not expand after picking up
(Supplementary Fig. 1b).
NMR-iPSCs exhibit pluripotency but not tumorigenicity. Two
NMR-iPSC clones were normal karyotype (58XY; clone 24 and 27;
Fig. 1e), telomerase activity was high (Supplementary Fig. 1d),
exponential proliferation occurred for Z77 days (Supplementary
Fig. 1e) and the cells remained undifferentiated at passage 30. The
growth rates of NMR-iPSCs and parental fibroblasts were similar
(Supplementary Fig. 1f). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qRT–PCR) using the primers specific for OSKM
transgenes showed decreases in the expression of all four
retroviruses (Supplementary Fig. 1g). AP activity, RNA-sequencing
(RNA-seq),
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
(RT–PCR)
analysis
and
immunocytochemistry
revealed
upregulation of several pluripotency markers and downregulation
of fibroblast markers (Fig. 1d,f; Supplementary Fig. 1h,i). Principal
component analysis of global gene expression patterns of RNA-seq
data showed that four NMR-iPSC clones clustered together and
were distinct from parental fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 1j).
We next determined the developmental potential of NMR-iPSCs
by embryoid body (EB) formation. Immunocytochemistry and
RT–PCR analyses revealed that NMR-iPSCs differentiated into
cells of the three germ layers (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1k).
To clarify whether NMR-iPSCs acquire tumorigenicity and form
teratomas in vivo, we transplanted these cells into the testes of
NOD/SCID mice. In contrast to control Ms- and human-iPSCs,
NMR-iPSCs did not form tumours (Fig. 1h,i, Supplementary
Fig. 2a,b). GFP-positive NMR-iPSCs engrafted in the testis without
forming tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2c). These results suggest
that reprogramming to a pluripotent state can be induced in
cancer-resistant NMRs without inducing tumorigenicity.
The role of ARF and ERAS in tumour resistance of NMR-iPSCs.
To
identify
genes
contributing
to
tumour
resistance
in
NMR-iPSCs, we used RNA-seq and qRT–PCR and analysed the
expression levels of genes associated with NMR tumour resistance
and ES/iPSC tumorigenicity16,18–24. The expression levels of both
hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) and pALTINK4a/b, which negatively
contribute to tumorigenicity in NMR-fibroblasts18,19, were quite
lower in NMR-iPSCs (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). In contrast
to mice, we found that the expression of the ARF and its
downstream gene p21 were higher in NMR-iPSCs relative to
expressions of the same genes in NMR fibroblasts, whereas
expression of INK4a and INK4b were suppressed (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Fig. 3c). The INK4/ARF locus is known to
frequently be genetically or epigenetically inactivated in human
cancers, and also to be strongly suppressed in human- and
Ms-iPSCs13–15. Ms-iPSCs derived from transgenic mice carrying
an
extra
copy
of
the
Ink4/Arf
locus
exhibits
reduced
tumorigenicity, although extra copy of Ink4a/Arf are not active
in non-stressed undifferentiated cells24.
Next,
we
determined
that
NMR-iPSCs
do
not
express
oncogenic ERAS, which positively regulates the tumorigenicity
of Ms-ESCs through activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/
AKT pathway16 (Supplementary Fig. 3d). NMR-ERAS harbours a
mutation that introduces a premature stop codon that removes
the
carboxy
(C)-terminal
CAAX
motif
required
for
its
transforming activity (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3e).
NMR-ERAS did not induce the transformation of NIH-3T3
cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a–f).
To evaluate the roles of ARF activation and ERAS disruption in
tumour resistance in NMR-iPSCs, we introduced short hairpin
RNAs targeting ARF (shARF) and/or Ms-ERas (mERas) into
NMR-iPSCs (shARF-, mERas- or shARF/mERas-NMR-iPSCs).
No changes were observed in the morphology of shARF-NMR-
iPSCs, while mERas- and shARF/mERas-NMR-iPSCs formed
flattened colonies (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). We confirmed p21
suppression
and
induction
of
AKT
phosphorylation
by
introducing shARF and mERas, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. 5c,d). The phosphorylation level of AKT in NMR-iPSCs on
ectopic expression of mERas was similar to that in Ms-iPSCs
(20D17)
and
Ms-ESCs
(EGR-G101),
indicating
that
the
AKT phosphorylation level in mERas-NMR-iPSCs was not
supra-physiological. Moreover, the AKT phosphorylation levels
in NMR-iPSCs and ERas knocked-out Ms-ESCs were low
compared
with
that
in
control
Ms-ESCs
(Supplementary
Fig. 5d). A heat map showing hierarchical clustering analysis of
the expression patterns of selected markers of undifferentiated

 and differentiated states from RNA-seq data suggested that
additional reprogramming did not occur following the introduc-
tion of shARF- and/or mERas (Supplementary Fig. 5e–g).
We then tested anchorage-independent growth in soft agar,
which is a conventional assay used to detect tumorigenicity
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 5h,i). Control or mERas-NMR-iPSCs
remained as single cells or formed a few small colonies, whereas
shARF-NMR-iPSCs formed significantly higher numbers of
small
colonies.

than
those
of

indicating
that

potential
depended
on
the
inactivation of ARF and that mERas enhanced cell proli-
feration. These were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice testes
to evaluate in vivo tumorigenic potential. The shARF-NMR-
iPSCs were more tumorigenic than mERas-NMR-iPSCs, and
shARF/mERas-NMR-iPSCs formed large tumours (Fig. 2c,d,
Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). Tumours derived from shARF/mERas-
NMR-iPSCs were teratomas that differentiated into cells of the
three germ layers (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d). Thus, ARF activation
and disruption of ERAS regulates the tumour resistance of
NMR-iPSCs.
Forced expression of Arf reduces tumorigenicity of Ms-iPSCs.
Next, we stably expressed Arf in Ms-iPSCs derived from a
Nanog-EGFP reporter mouse25 (Arf-Ms-iPSC) to study whether
this reduced the tumorigenicity of Ms-iPSCs, and found that it
had
little
effect

expression

 Low-Arf (No. 5, 6) groups, as defined by Arf expression levels
without drug selection (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Although tumour
formation was markedly reduced in both the Low- and High-Arf
groups (Fig. 3a,b), the High-Arf group acquired significantly
higher tumour resistance than the Low-Arf group; 56.25% of
High-Arf group mice survived Z14 weeks without detectable
tumours and 7 of 42 injection sites (16.67%) of High-Arf group
mice developed tumours (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 7d).
Haematoxylin–eosin staining showed that these tumours were
teratomas (Supplementary Fig. 7e). Arf transgene expression was
strongly suppressed in tumours compared with undifferentiated
Arf-Ms-iPSCs, possibly due to gene silencing (Supplementary
Fig. 7f). EB formation showed that the High-Arf group had
differentiation potential into derivatives of all three germ layers
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b).
In mice and humans, expression of both INK4a and ARF is
initially upregulated, and then strongly suppressed in the later
stages of reprogramming14. To determine why NMR-iPSCs
retain relatively high ARF expression and exhibit tumour
resistance,
we
analysed
the
kinetics
of
INK4a
and
ARF
expression
during
reprogramming.
INK4a
and
ARF
were
derepressed
during
early
reprogramming.
In
late
reprogramming, INK4a was suppressed (as it is in both mice
and humans) and ARF expression was retained in NMR-iPSCs
(Supplementary Fig. 9a). Next, we analysed whether ARF was
upregulated in response to c-MYC activation26 in NMR-iPSCs,
and found that the total c-MYC level was lower than it was in
NMR-fibroblasts, and that the expression of genes regulated by
c-MYC was similar to expression of those genes in parental
fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 9b,c).
ARF-suppression blocks iPSC generation by NMR-specific ASIS.
To evaluate the effects of ARF downregulation on NMR-
fibroblasts, we performed ARF knockdown during reprogramming;
this has been shown to enhance reprogramming efficiency in
mice13–15. In NMR-fibroblasts, ARF suppression induced a
phenotype similar to that of senescent cells, including enlarged
cytoplasm and activation of senescence-associated b-galactosidase
(SA-bGal) activity, resulting in the inhibition of reprogramming.
In contrast, INK4a knockdown enhanced cellular growth and
reprogramming efficiency exhibited by Ms and human cells
(Fig.
4a–d,
Supplementary
Fig.
9d,e).
Furthermore,
ARF
knockdown in stressed NMR-fibroblasts, in which ARF had been
derepressed by either c-MYC oncogene overexpression or serial
passage, induced cellular senescence (Fig. 4e–j, Supplementary
Fig. 9f–j). We termed this phenomenon ‘ARF suppression-induced
senescence’ (ASIS). To gain mechanistic insight into ASIS
induction, we examined the activation status of RB, AKT,
MAPK and several cell cycle inhibitors, which are reported to
regulate cellular senescence (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). A previous
study has shown that both RB hypo-phosphorylation by Ink4a and
AKT phosphorylation by mitogenic signalling are both required
for the induction of cellular senescence in Ms-fibroblasts27.
Furthermore,
INK4a
is
reported
to
be
essential
for
the
maintenance of cellular senescence28,29. However, we found
that
in
the
NMR
fibroblasts
undergoing
ASIS,
RB
hypo-phosphorylation was induced without INK4a, p21 and p27
upregulation, whereas AKT was phosphorylated along with ERK
activation. The absence of the involvement of cell cycle inhibitors
(such as INK4a, p21 and p27) is the interesting feature of ASIS,
and other genes may regulate ASIS as NMR-specific safeguard.
Discussion
Cells suffer from stressors such as reprogramming, oncogene
activation, and replication stress are known to derepress INK4a
and ARF expression30. Stressed cells become senescent; this is the
first safeguard against oncogenic transformation30,31. Given the
results of the present study, we suggest that NMR-specific ASIS
may act as a second safeguard, inducing cellular senescence when
ARF is suppressed in cells, in which ARF has been derepressed by
exposure to stressors (Fig. 4k). An ARF-activated cell population
may thus be selected during the generation of NMR-iPSCs.
Moreover, NMRs encode truncated forms of INK4a and ARF20,32,
suggesting that unique cancer-resistance mechanisms mediated
by INK4a and ARF evolved in NMRs.
We conclude that the tumour resistance in NMR-iPSCs is
based on NMR-specific ARF regulation and disruption of ERAS.
Further research into the detailed mechanisms underlying ASIS
in NMRs may contribute to the generation of non-tumorigenic
human-iPSCs enabling safer cell-based therapeutics and shed new
light on cancer resistance in the naked mole-rat.

 Cell culture and retroviral infection. NMR- or Ms-skin fibroblasts were isolated
from 1- to 2-year-old adult male NMRs or 6-week-old adult male C57BL/6 mice.
The skin including the epidermis was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)

serum (FBS) medium (contents described below). The cell clumps and minced
tissues were collected by centrifugation (180g, 5 min), resuspended in fresh med-
ium, plated on gelatin-coated 10-cm cell culture dishes and cultured at 32 �C
(NMR-fibroblasts) or 37 �C (Ms-fibroblasts) in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. The cells were cultured in 15% FBS medium composed of
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with
15% FBS (JRH or BioWest), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine

 We used a lentiviral vector to transduce NMR-fibroblasts (passage 2) with
the Ms retroviral receptor Slc7a1 (ref. 33). The cells were seeded at 1.5 � 105 cells
per 10-cm dish 1 day before transduction; 3 days later, the NMR-fibroblasts
(passage 3) were transduced with retroviral vectors that express Ms OSKM, as
previously described7. In brief, pMXs-based retroviral vectors were introduced into
Plat-E cells with Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Twelve hours after transduction, the medium was
replaced. Another 24 h later, the conditioned medium containing virus particles
derived from these Plat-E cultures was used for viral transduction. A second
retroviral infection was performed 4 days after the first because of the low infection
efficiency of NMR-fibroblasts. Nine days after the first transduction, fibroblasts
were plated at 1.5 � 105 cells per 10-cm dish on a mitomycin C-treated SNL-STO
(MSTO) feeder layer. The medium was replaced with standard human ES medium
containing DMEM/F12 (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 20% knockout serum
replacement (Life Technologies), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine,
0.1 mM NEAA, 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, Sigma Aldrich) and 4 ng ml � 1
fibroblast growth factor 2 (PeproTech). The medium was changed every day, and
we isolated iPSC-like colonies 30 days after reseeding on feeder layers.
NMR-iPSCs were maintained on MSTO feeder layers on gelatin-coated six-well
plates, passaged once each week and reseeded at 2.0 � 105 cells per well. Ms-iPSCs
(20D17, 38C2, N3E6; refs 25,34) were cultured in standard Ms-ES medium
containing DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM
L-glutamine and 0.1 mM NEAA, 0.1 mM 2-ME and human recombinant leukaemia
inhibitory factor (LIF, Nacalai Tesque) or conditioned medium containing
LIF produced by Plat-E cell cultures transfected with a vector encoding human LIF
(pCAGGS-hLIF)35.
Karyotyping. Chromosomal G-band analyses were performed at Nihon Gene
Research Laboratories. The karyotypes of NMR-iPSC clones 24 and 27 were
normal and that of clone 12 was tetraploid.
Molecular cloning of NMR-ERAS coding sequence. PCR was performed using
primers, shown in Supplementary Table 1, designed according to the genomic
sequences of NMR-ERAS deposited in the database of the Beijing Genomics Institute
(BGI)20. DNA fragments were inserted into the pENTR/D-TOPO entry vector and
sequenced using the Sanger method. The NMR-ERAS sequence (NCBI Reference
Sequence: XM_004921208) previously deposited has one base deletion to adjust frame
by automated computational analysis using gene prediction method (Gnomon).
RT–PCR analysis. To remove the feeder-layer MSTO cells, dissociated iPSCs were
allowed to adhere for 20 min to a gelatin-coated dish. The supernatant containing
the iPSCs was centrifuged. Total RNA of iPSCs and fibroblasts were purified using
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with a Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion) to
remove contaminating genomic DNA. Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed
using ReverTraAce (Toyobo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR
was performed using ExTaq-HS polymerase (Takara). The primer sequences are
listed in Supplementary Table 1.
qRT–PCR analysis. Ms and NMR cells were collected and washed with ice-cold
PBS. The cells were centrifuged, and total RNA was extracted from the pellet using
the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). We used gDNA Eliminator spin columns to
remove genomic DNA. The complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using
the ReverTra Ace qRT–PCR RT Master Mix (Toyobo) with 400 ng of total RNA.
The qRT–PCR was performed in triplicate with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara)
or Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen) using a ViiA 7 or StepOne plus
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table 1.
AP activity and immunocytochemistry. AP activity was measured using an
Alkaline Phosphatase Detection Kit (System Biosciences) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. For immunocytochemistry, NMR-iPSCs and differentiated
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature,
washed with PBS and then treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in Tris-NaCl-blocking
buffer (PerkinElmer) for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated
with primary antibodies against Oct4 (Millipore; 7F9.2; 1:200) and E-cadherin (BD
Pharmingen; clone 36; 1:500) for 12 h at 4 �C. After washes with PBS, the cells were
incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 anti-Ms IgG (Cell Signaling
Technology (CST); A21424; 1:1,000) and Alexa Fluor 555 anti-rabbit IgG (CST;
A21429; 1:1,000), and nuclei were counterstained with 1 mg ml � 1 Hoechst 33,258
(Sigma Aldrich) for 60 min at room temperature. After washes with PBS, the
images were captured.
In vitro differentiation. EB formation was analysed by dissociating the NMR-
iPSCs with 0.1% trypsin-EDTA and plating them on an ultra-low attachment
coated dish (Corning) in human ES medium without basic fibroblast growth factor.
After 14 days, EBs were transferred to gelatin-coated adhesion dishes and cultured
for 7 days. Culture medium was replaced every second day. On day 21, the cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and analysed using the antibodies against the
proteins as follows: GFAP (Dako; Z0334; 1:4,000), NESTIN (non-commercial36,37;
1:1,000), aSMA (Sigma Aldrich; 1A4; 1:1,000), DESMIN (Thermo Scientific;
RB-9014; 1:1,000), FOXA2 (ABNOVA; 7E6; 1:1,000) and VIMENTIN
(abcam; EPR3776; 1:1,000).
Ms-iPSCs were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and plated onto an
ultra-low attachment coated dish in 10 ml of aMEM (Gibco) supplemented with
10% FBS and 0.1 mM 2-ME (EB medium), cultured for 6 days, transferred to a
poly-L-ornithine (Sigma Aldrich)/fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich)-coated adhesion dish
and cultured for 24 h. To assess direct neural differentiation, Ms-iPSCs were
dissociated and then plated onto an ultra-low-coated attachment dish in 10 ml of
EB medium. On day 2, 10 � 8 M retinoic acid (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the
culture medium, and after 4 days, EBs were transferred to a poly-L-ornithine/
fibronectin-coated adhesion dish and cultured in medium containing DMEM/F-12
(Gibco), 0.6% glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 3 mM sodium bicarbonate, 5 mM
HEPES, 25 mg ml � 1 insulin (Sigma Aldrich), 100 mg ml � 1 transferrin (Nakalai
Tesque), 20 nM progesterone (Sigma Aldrich), 30 ng sodium selenate (Sigma
Aldrich) and 60 nM putrescine (Sigma Aldrich) and cultured for 24 h as previously
described38. For immunocytochemical analyses, the cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and analysed using the antibodies against the proteins as
follows: aSMA (Sigma Aldrich; 1A4; 1:1,000), albumin (Sigma Aldrich; A0433;
1:1,000), vimentin (Abcam; EPR3776; 1:1,000), Nestin (BD Pharmingen;
BD-556309; 1:250), Tubb3 (Sigma Aldrich; T8660; 1:1,000).
Telomerase activity. Telomerase activity was detected using the TRAPeze
Telomerase Detection Kit (Chemicon), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Telomere repeat additions were performed at 30 �C for 120 min. The
samples were electrophoretically separated through 20% polyacrylamide gels in
0.5 � TBE. The gel was stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen; 1:10,000).
RNA-seq. Total RNA was extracted from NMR-fibroblasts and NMR-iPSCs using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by Qiagen RNeasy column purification. The
quality and quantity of the RNA preparations were assessed using a 2100 Bioa-
nalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent Technologies). Poly(A) þ
RNA was selected and converted to a library of cDNA fragments (200–250 bp) with
adaptors attached to both ends for sequencing using a TruSeq RNA Sample Prep
Kit v2 (Illumina), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were quantified
using a Bioanalyzer DNA High Sensitivity Kit (Agilent Technologies) and Kapa
Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems) using an Applied Biosystems
StepOne Real-Time PCR System, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
libraries were then loaded into a flow cell for cluster generation using the TruSeq
Rapid SR Cluster Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 to
obtain 100-nucleotide sequences (single-end).
Base-calling and Chastity filtering were performed using real-time analysis
software version 1.18.61. Illumina fastq files generated using real-time analysis were
trimmed with cutadapt (http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/) to remove the
Illumina Truseq adapter sequence, and sequences with Z50 nucleotides were
selected. The fastq sequences of NMR-iPS and Ms fibroblasts were separated using
xenome (http://www.genomics.csse.unimelb.edu.au/product-xenome.php) from
the trimmed fastq files. The NMR reference sequence files and annotation general
feature format file were downloaded from BGI ftp site (ftp://ftp.genomics.org.cn/
pub/Heterocephalus_glaber/).
We used bowtie build v.0.12.9 to build Burrows–Wheeler transform indexes for
the reference genomic sequence, which were combined with data from genomic
and mitochondrial sequence files. The trimmed NMR fastq files were aligned to the
reference genomic sequence using TopHat v.2.0.12 (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/)
with SAMtools v.0.1.18 and non-default parameters as follows: --num-threads
6 --max-multihits 1 --transcriptome-index ¼ ‘BGI naked mole-rat cdna sequence’.
Transcript abundances were calculated and fragments per kilobase of transcript
per million mapped reads-normalized to the upper quartile using Cufflinks v.2.0.12
(http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/). The differential expression of transcripts by
fibroblasts and iPSCs was estimated using Cuffdiff. Heat maps of the differentially
expressed genes were generated using the heatmap.3 function in the plots package
of R. We selected 31 pluripotency-related genes7,8,39 and 15 fibroblast-marker
genes shown in Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 5e–g. In Supplementary Fig. 9c,
c-Myc-target genes were selected, as previously described40.
Cell proliferation. NMR-iPSCs and -fibroblasts were passaged every 7 days and
replated at 2 � 105 per six-well plate and 3 � 105 per 10-cm dish, respectively.
Reseeded cells were counted using a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter). The
population doubling time, including cell cycle arrest and cell death, was calculated
from the slopes of growth curve.
Lentivirus preparation. We used the lentiviral vectors pCSII-EF-NMR-ERAS-TK-
hyg, pCSII-EF-mERas-TK-hyg, pCSII-EF-HRasV12-TK-hyg, pCSII-EF-NMR-c-
MYC-TK-hyg or pCSII-EF-EGFP-TK-hyg for ectopic expression and H1
promoter-driven vectors previously described41 for shRNA expression. Three
knockdown vectors expressing shRNA of NMR-ARF were generated and validated
as previously shown32. The target sequences of shRNAs are shown in Supplementary
Table 2. Each plasmid and packaging vectors (pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev and

 pCAG-HIVgp)41 were used to transfect 293T cells with polyethylenimine MAX
transfection reagent (CosmoBio), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
conditioned medium containing virus particles was concentrated and used for viral
transduction.
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption. A 20-nt guide RNA (gRNA)
sequence (50-CATGGTCTTTCACGAAGCAT-30) was designed to target
double-strand breaks at protein coding region of ERas and cloned into the Cas9
and sgRNA expression vector SpCas9-2A-Puro (Addgene, PX459 #62988; ref. 42).
The plasmid was transfected into the Ms-ESC lines (EGR-G101; ref. 43)
using CUY21EDIT2 (BEX) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
transfected cells were enriched by 2 days of puromycin selection starting 24 h
after transfection and colonies were picked up. DNA was extracted from each
colony and coding sequence for ERas was amplified and sequenced using the
Sanger method.
Stable ectopic expression of Arf in Ms-iPSCs. Ms-iPSCs expressing Arf were
generated by electroporating cells with the pCAG-Arf-IRES-hyg vector
and selecting hygromycin-resistant cells for 7 days, and then Arf-Ms-iPSC
colonies were picked up. The differentiation potential of EBs derived from the
Arf-Ms-iPSCs was evaluated by qPCR for differntiation marker genes44.
Teratoma formation. iPSCs were suspended (1 � 107 cells per 200 ml) in medium.
NOD/SCID mice were anaesthetised using isoflurane. We injected 20 ml of the
cell suspension (1 � 106 cells) into each testis. Ten, 20 or 28 weeks after
transplantation, tumours and testes were dissected, fixed overnight in PBS
containing 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The sections were
stained with haematoxylin and eosin or subjected to immunohistochemical analysis
to detect the expression of EGFP and differentiation markers. The sections were
treated with 0.1 M citrate buffer at 105 �C for 20 min and incubated at 4 �C
overnight with antibodies against the following proteins: GFP (MBL; 598; 1:500),
aSMA (Sigma Aldrich; 1A4; 1:500), VIMENTIN (Abcam; EPR3776; 1:1,000),
NESTIN (non-commercial antibody36,37; 1:1,000) and GFAP (Dako; Z0334;
1:1,000). After washes with PBS, the slides were incubated with secondary
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) anti-Ms IgG (CST; 7,076;
1:1,000) and anti-rabbit IgG (CST; 7,074; 1:1,000) for 1 h at room temperature,
washed with PBS and antigen–antibody complexes were detected using DAB
(Vector Laboratories).
The tumorigenicity of Ms-iPSCs was assessed by injecting subcutaneously
5 � 105 cells into nude mice. The mice were monitored once each week for
teratoma formation and general health and killed 3 or 5 weeks later. To
determine the tumour-free survival rate, we monitored the mice once
each week. Scoring criterion: mice with visible tumours were designated
‘tumour-positive’.
Growth in soft agar. To test for anchorage-independent growth, NMR-iPSCs
were suspended to 3 � 103 cells per 3 ml of 0.35% agar in growth medium
and poured over a solidified layer of 0.65% agar medium in a six-well plate.
Three weeks later, the cell colonies were stained using toluidine blue and
enumerated.
SA-bGal activity. SA-bGal activity was measured using the Senescence
Detection Kit (BioVision). Cells were stained for 48 h at 37 �C according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were washed with PBS and stained with
Hoechst 33,258 (diluted 1:1,000 with PBS) for 30 min at room temperature in the
dark. The cells were washed in PBS and analysed by microscopy. The cell
populations in at least three random fields (Z500 cells) were analysed for
perinuclear blue staining indicative of SA-bGal activity, and the nuclei were
visualized using Hoechst staining.
Western blotting. The cells were washed with PBS, lysed in cell-lysis buffer
(62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS and 5% sucrose) and boiled for 5 min.
The protein concentrations were measured using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo Scientific). The samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE (polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis), and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane using a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). The membranes
were probed with antibodies against NMR-INK4a (non-commercial32; 1:1,000),
NMR-ARF (non-commercial32; 1:10,000), AKT (CST; 9,272; 1:1,000),
pAKT (CST; 4,060; 1:1,000), p53 (Sigma Aldrich; AV02055; 1:1,000), p21
(BD Biosciences; 555,430; 1:1,000), p27 (CST; 3,698; 1:1,000), RB (CST; 9,309;
1:1,000), pRB (CST; 8,516; 1:1,000), ERK (CST; 9,102; 1:1,000), pERK (CST; 4,370;
1:1,000), p38 (CST; 9,212; 1:1,000), p-p38(CST; 4,511; 1:1,000) and beta-actin
(Sigma Aldrich; AC-15; 1:100,000). The membranes were incubated with
HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (CST; 7,074; 1:1,000) or anti-Ms (CST; 7,076; 1:1,000)
IgG secondary antibodies and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL; GE Healthcare). All uncropped western blots can be found in Supplementary
Fig. 11.
