Study Highlights 
1. WHAT IS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE 
• 
Epidemiological studies have consistently shown an inverse association between regular use of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. 
• 
However, it remains unclear whether use of NSAIDs is also inversely associated with the 
precursor lesion, Barrett’s esophagus. 
2. WHAT IS NEW HERE 
• 
Use of NSAIDs was not associated with a reduced risk of Barrett’s esophagus. 
• 
The findings from this large pooled analysis suggest that the likely protective mechanism of 
NSAIDs on esophageal adenocarcinoma occurs after to the development of Barrett’s esophagus.

ABSTRACT 
OBJECTIVES: Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a 
reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Epidemiological studies examining the association between 
NSAID use and the risk of the precursor lesion, Barrett’s esophagus, have been inconclusive. 
 
METHODS: We analyzed pooled individual-level participant data from six case-control studies of 
Barrett’s esophagus in the Barrett’s and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON). We 
compared medication use from 1474 patients with Barrett’s esophagus separately with two control 
groups: 2256 population-based controls and 2018 gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) controls. 
Study-specific odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable 
logistic regression models and were combined using a random effects meta-analytic model. 
 
RESULTS: Regular (at least once weekly) use of any NSAIDs was not associated with the risk of 
Barrett’s esophagus (vs. population-based controls, adjusted OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.76–1.32; I2=61%; vs. 
GERD controls, adjusted OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.82–1.19; I2=19%). Similar null findings were observed 
among individuals who took aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs. We also found no association with highest 
levels of frequency (at least daily use) and duration (≥5 years) of NSAID use. There was evidence of 
moderate between-study heterogeneity; however, associations with NSAID use remained non-significant 
in “leave-one-out” sensitivity analyses. 
 
CONCLUSIONS: Use of NSAIDs was not associated with the risk of Barrett’s esophagus. The 
previously reported inverse association between NSAID use and esophageal adenocarcinoma may be 
through reducing the risk of neoplastic progression in patients with Barrett’s esophagus.

INTRODUCTION 
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased more than eightfold in the United States in 
recent decades (1), and the incidence continues to rise (2). Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a highly fatal 
cancer with a five-year survival rate of < 20% (3). Thus, as with other aggressive cancers, there is strong 
interest in identifying chemopreventive agents that might help reduce the burden of esophageal 
adenocarcinoma, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), statins, or acid suppressant 
medications. 
 
NSAIDs have been shown in experimental studies to have a chemopreventive effect on the 
development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, presumably by blocking cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes 
(aspirin is an inhibitor of COX-1, while other NSAIDs block both COX-1 and COX-2) and the production 
of prostaglandin. In addition, epidemiological studies have found a strong inverse association between use 
of NSAIDs and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. In a pooled analysis of data from the Barrett’s 
and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON; http://beacon.tlvnet.org/), Liao et al. (4) 
showed that patients who used any NSAIDs had a 32% reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma 
(summary adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56–0.83; I2=17%). 
 
Barrett’s esophagus is the only known precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma and may affect 
2% of the general adult population (5). Compared to the general population, patients with Barrett’s 
esophagus have 10- to 55-fold increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (6-11). 
Assessment of risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus may allow for better understanding of disease 
pathophysiology, and identify new opportunities for prevention and risk stratification. While NSAIDs 
have been consistently associated with reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, it is unclear whether 
they may affect risk through preventing the development of Barrett’s esophagus, by preventing the 
development of esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett’s esophagus, or both. This question 
has substantial clinical implications, because attempts at chemoprevention with NSAIDs in the setting of 
Barrett’s esophagus are only logical if the effect of NSAIDs occurs after the development of Barrett’s 
esophagus. A recent meta-analysis of five studies showed a 30% reduction in the risk of progression from 
 6 
 
Barrett’s esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma among NSAID users, as compared with nonusers (12). 
In contrast, results from epidemiological studies of the association between NSAIDs and the risk of 
Barrett’s esophagus have been largely inconclusive, where both negative (13-15) and positive 
associations (16,17) have been reported.  
 
We therefore conducted a large analysis of pooled individual-level data from six case-control 
studies in the BEACON Consortium to comprehensively examine the association between use of NSAIDs 
and the risk of Barrett’s esophagus.
 7 
 
METHODS 
Study population 
We analyzed individual-level participant data from six population-based case-control studies in BEACON 
that had available data on NSAID use (Supplementary Table 1). The six studies were as follows: the 
Houston Barrett’s Esophagus study (based at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center at Houston, 
TX; hereafter “Houston”) (17); the Factors Influencing the Barrett’s/Adenocarcinoma Relationship study 
(based in Ireland; “FINBAR”) (13); the Epidemiology and Incidence of Barrett’s Esophagus study (based 
in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population; “KPNC”) (14); The Newly Diagnosed Barrett’s 
Esophagus Study (based at the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Medical Center at 
Ann Arbor, MI; “NDB”) (18); the Study of Digestive Health (based in Brisbane, Australia; “SDH”) (16); 
and the Study of Reflux Disease (based in western Washington State; “SRD”) (19). We additionally 
restricted our analyses to non-Hispanic white study participants due to low numbers of cases from non-
white ethnic groups (total n=95; range n=17 in NDB to n=43 in KPNC). The Institutional Review Boards 
or Research Ethics Committees of each institution approved the acquisition and pooling of data for the 
present analysis. Participants provided written informed consent to take part in the studies. 
 
In all studies, cases included persons with endoscopic evidence of columnar mucosa in the 
tubular esophagus, accompanied by the presence of specialized intestinal metaplasia in an esophageal 
biopsy, and cases included persons with prevalent and newly diagnosed Barrett’s esophagus 
(Supplementary Table 1). The SRD also included some patients with specialized intestinal esophageal 
metaplasia on biopsy, but without endoscopically visible columnar metaplasia. The NDB study included 
only males (cases and controls) (18). 
The cases were compared separately with (1) population-based controls, representing the 
underlying source population from which cases arose, and (2) gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 
controls, representing the population undergoing endoscopy from which cases are diagnosed. 
 
 8 
 
Study variables 
Data for medication use was self-reported in all studies (Supplementary Table 1). Five of the six studies 
asked about “regular use” of medications over a specified time period with a minimum frequency of use 
(13,14,17-19). The duration of regular use varied across the five studies, from 3 months to 1 year of use. 
The definition for frequency of regular use was consistent across the five studies, each specified as at least 
once per week. The remaining study did not define regular use; for this study we reclassified study 
participants as regular users if their reported frequency of use was at least once per week (16). 
 
The main exposure categories used in the analysis were regular (at least once per week) use of the 
medication (aspirin, non-aspirin NSAIDs, any NSAIDs) and non-regular use (referent group; less than 
once per week use for each category). Medication use was further classified by frequency (weekly—
<daily and at least daily) and duration (< 5 years and ≥ 5 years) of use. 
 
Potential confounding variables were available from all studies as part of a core dataset and were 
harmonized by the coordinating center. Variables that were selected a priori as adjustment factors 
included age (<50, 50-<60, 60-<70, ≥70 years), sex (except for NDB which included only males), highest 
level of education (school only, tech/diploma, university), smoking status (never, former, current) and 
body mass index (BMI; <25, 25-29.9, ≥30 kg/m2). Models that compared cases with population-based 
controls were also subsequently adjusted for self-reported GERD symptoms (less than weekly vs. at least 
weekly) to evaluate potential confounding effects of GERD symptoms. Frequency of GERD symptoms 
was defined as the highest reported frequency of either heartburn or acid regurgitation symptoms; 
“frequent symptoms” were those occurring at least weekly. 
 
Statistical analysis 
We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate study-specific ORs and 95% CIs for the association 
between NSAID use and risk of Barrett’s esophagus. The study-specific ORs were then combined using 
random-effects meta-analytic models to generate a summary OR. We used the inconsistency index, I2, 
 9 
 
and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) to assess heterogeneity between studies (20). Larger I2 values reflect 
increasing heterogeneity, beyond what is attributable to chance. I2 values of 25%, 50% and 75% were 
used as evidence of low, moderate, or high levels of heterogeneity, respectively. A leave-one-out 
sensitivity analysis was performed by iteratively removing one study at a time to assess whether a single 
study was contributing to high (if present) between-study heterogeneity and to confirm that our findings 
were not driven by any single study (21). For comparisons with population-based controls only, we 
assessed whether the association between NSAID use and the risk of Barrett’s esophagus was modified 
by frequency of GERD symptoms (less than weekly, at least weekly) by performing likelihood ratio tests 
of nested models with and without the NSAID-GERD interaction term.  
All tests for statistical significance were two-sided at α=0.05 and analyses were conducted using 
Stata 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
 10 
 
RESULTS 
We included data from 1474 cases, 2256 population-based controls and 2018 GERD controls in the 
analysis. In total, 31.7% of the study population reported regular (at least once weekly) use of aspirin, 
19.6% reported regular use of non-aspirin NSAIDs, and 47.0% reported regular use of any NSAIDs. 
However, the prevalence of use among controls (and cases) varied considerably across the six studies 
(Supplementary Table 2). For example, prevalence of prior regular use of aspirin in population-based 
controls ranged from 10.7% in SDH to 47.3% in NDB; in cases, from 17.0% in SDH to 49.6% in NDB. 
 
Aspirin 
Figure 1A shows the association between aspirin use and risk of Barrett’s esophagus. In the multivariable 
analysis, there was no association between prior regular use of aspirin (fully adjusted OR = 1.00, 95% CI 
= 0.76–1.32) and the risk of Barrett’s esophagus for comparison with population-based controls (Table 1). 
We found moderate between-study heterogeneity (I2=56%), but with a wide uncertainty interval (95% UI 
= 0%–82%). Among five studies that reported information on frequency of use (SDH did not capture 
daily medication use), prior daily use of any aspirin was not associated with the risk of Barrett’s 
esophagus (fully adjusted OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.71–1.21), with no evidence of between-study 
heterogeneity (I2=10%). With regard to duration of use (Table 1), we found no association between 
duration of prior aspirin use and risk of Barrett’s esophagus (fully adjusted OR for ≥ 5 years = 1.04, 95% 
CI = 0.70–1.54; I2=59%). We found similar null findings for aspirin use when we compared cases with 
GERD controls (Table 2) and in analyses (cases vs. population-based controls) stratified by frequency of 
GERD symptoms (Table 3). 
 
Non-aspirin NSAIDs 
When compared with population-based controls, regular use of any non-aspirin NSAIDs was not 
associated with the risk of Barrett’s esophagus (fully adjusted OR = 1.16, 0.86–1.56; I2=49%) (Figure 
1B). We found no evidence of effect modification by frequency of GERD symptoms (Table 3). Among 
 11 
 
the five studies that reported information on frequency and duration of use, we found some evidence for a 
modest increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus associated with prior daily use of any non-aspirin NSAIDs 
(fully adjusted OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.92–2.18; I2=37%) and ≥ 5 years of non-aspirin NSAID use (fully 
adjusted OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.09–2.26; I2=7%). However, there were no associations between 
frequency and duration of non-aspirin NSAID use and the risk of Barrett’s esophagus for comparisons 
with GERD controls (Table 2). 
 
Any NSAIDs 
Using data from the six studies, there was no association between regular use of any NSAIDs (adjusted 
OR = 1.00, 0.76–1.32; I2=61%) and the risk of Barrett’s esophagus for comparison with population-based 
controls (Table 1). There was no association between daily use of any NSAIDs and Barrett’s esophagus 
(fully adjusted OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.69–1.47; I2=57%). With regard to duration of use (Table 1), we 
found no association between duration of prior NSAID use and risk of Barrett’s esophagus (fully adjusted 
OR for ≥ 5 years = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.67–1.64; I2=71%). We found similar null findings when we 
compared cases with GERD controls (Table 2) and in analyses (cases vs. population-based controls) 
stratified by frequency of GERD symptoms (Table 3). 
 
While there was evidence of between-study heterogeneity for associations between NSAID use and the 
risk of Barrett’s esophagus, the results remained unchanged in the leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary 
Table 3), indicating that our results were not driven by any single study.

DISCUSSSION 
To our knowledge, this pooled analysis is the largest evaluation of NSAID use and risk of Barrett’s 
esophagus to date. It included six well-characterized population-based case-control studies with similar 
assessments of regular medication use. We observed no overall association between regular use of any 
NSAIDs, as well as for the individual effects of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs, and the risk of Barrett’s 
esophagus. Furthermore, we found no evidence of an inverse relationship between increased frequency or 
duration of NSAID use and the risk of Barrett’s esophagus. We did observe a moderate level of 
heterogeneity among the studies for many of the effect estimates, but with wide uncertainty intervals, and 
the associations with NSAID use remained non-significant when individual studies were omitted 
following “leave-one-out” analyses. 
 
There is consistent evidence from epidemiological studies for an inverse relationship between use 
of NSAIDs and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. In the largest study to date, pooled analyses of 
data from BEACON showed greater than 30% reduction in the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma among 
NSAID users, as compared with nonusers (4). The association between NSAID use and esophageal 
adenocarcinoma was especially strong among daily users (adjusted OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.43–0.73; 
I2=0%). However, there remained considerable uncertainty regarding the stage(s) of neoplastic 
progression in which NSAIDs may act, whether in preventing the development of Barrett’s esophagus, 
preventing progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett’s esophagus, or both. 
Several well designed prospective and retrospective studies have examined the association 
between NSAID use and risk of progression from Barrett’s esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma. In 
their recent meta-analysis examining the association with NSAID use, Zhang et al. (12) showed a 30% 
reduction in the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma among patients with Barrett’s esophagus (adjusted 
OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52–0.95) with minimal heterogeneity between the five studies (I2 = 28%). They 
found no significant differences in the magnitude in the association with aspirin use or non-aspirin 
NSAID use and the association was independent of duration of use.   
 13 
 
While several observational studies have assessed the association between NSAID use and the 
risk of Barrett’s esophagus, the results have been inconclusive. The reasons for the contrasting results are 
not clear and differences in populations and methods make direct comparisons between published studies 
difficult. We attempted to overcome some of these shortcomings by using harmonized data from multiple 
well-conducted case-control studies and meta-analytic methods.  
The results from our study have implications for chemoprevention. If NSAIDs stopped the 
development of Barrett’s esophagus, the target group for treatment would be 40% of the population to 
decrease a fraction of the 10,000 esophageal adenocarcinoma cases in the U.S. every year. Given that 
NSAIDs are not benign, it is unlikely that such an effort is either worthwhile or feasible. If, on the other 
hand, NSAIDs work after the development of Barrett’s esophagus, we have a more reasonable strategy 
whereby we treat a much smaller group of patients at much higher risk to achieve chemoprevention. 
This large pooled analysis of individual-level participant data from six case-control studies in 
BEACON offered several notable strengths. With almost 1500 cases of Barrett’s esophagus, we had 
greater power to detect associations, if present, than in any of the previous single site studies. 
Furthermore, because we were able to evaluate NSAID exposure compared with a common reference 
group (non-regular use), we reduced the potential for exposure misclassification. While we observed 
moderate heterogeneity across studies, we found no evidence that any individual study was overly 
influential, thus providing additional robustness and confidence to our findings. Finally, the use of 
individual-level data, with variables standardized across studies, and the ability to control for a wide 
range of potential confounders collected consistently access the studies were additional strengths of this 
pooled analysis.  
Our study also has a number of limitations. There was some variability among the exposure 
questions from different studies; in particular, the definition of regular use. We addressed the 
misclassification of exposure definition across the studies by using a standard definition for regular use as 
described in the Methods; in the one study that did not specify regular use (16), we reclassified 
participants accordingly. Because of the way in which the individual studies asked participants about 
 14 
 
medication use (e.g., “have you used NSAIDs at least weekly in the past year?”), we were unable to 
examine separately ‘no use’ versus ‘low use’ of NSAIDs. The individual study ORs may differ somewhat 
from the pooled ORs due to differences in confounding structure. For example, race was a strong 
confounder of the association between NSAID use and risk of Barrett’s esophagus in KPNC (14). Here, 
we limited the analyses to non-Hispanic white study participants. Finally, most of the six studies included 
a mix of patients with newly diagnosed and prevalent diagnoses of Barrett’s esophagus, which could have 
biased the results unpredictably. 
In summary, this pooled analysis found no evidence for an inverse association between use of 
NSAIDs and the risk of Barrett’s esophagus. Given the known inverse association between NSAIDs and 
the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, and analogous to that observed for colon cancer and polyps 
whereby NSAID use may stop progression from pre-cancer to cancer, these findings support 
investigations into the use of these chemopreventive agents for decreasing the risk of neoplastic 
progression from Barrett’s esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma.

weighting each study contributes to the summary odds ratio. The dot on each square represents the study-
specific odds ratio, and the size of the surrounding square is an illustrative representation of study 
weighting. The horizontal lines represent the confidence intervals; if ending in an arrow, this indicates 
that the interval transcends the region plotted. The diamond represents the summary odds ratio and 95% 
confidence intervals. Houston = the Houston Barrett’s Esophagus study; FINBAR = Factors Influencing

Case definition 
Houston 
“Have you taken [class of mediation] at least once a week for 3 months or longer, in the last 
year?”. Subjects responding affirmatively were asked to provide start and stop dates, and 
the frequency and duration of use. 
2008-2013 
Newly diagnosed and prevalent cases;  
any length; SIM. 
FINBAR 
Subjects were asked to recall if they had ever taken any prescription or over-the-counter 
aspirin or non-aspirin NSAID at least once weekly for ≥6 months. Subjects responding 
affirmatively were asked to provide their age or the date when they first started taking these 
medications regularly, when they stopped taking the medications on a regular basis, and 
the total duration of use and the frequency that the medications were taken. Medication 
usage is reported ≥1 year before interview date. 
2002-2004 
Newly diagnosed and prevalent cases;  
≥3cm; SIM. 
KPNC 
Subjects were asked to consider both prescription and over-the-counter medications when 
responding ‘‘nonusers’’ for the main analyses were defined as persons with less than 
weekly use of either aspirin or NSAIDs in the past year. Average frequency was estimated 
using intake in the year prior to the index date. The duration of use was the interval 
between the age at initiation of regular use (defined as use at least once a week for more 
than 1 year) and the index date. 
2002-2005 
Newly diagnosed cases;  
any length; SIM. 
NDB 
“Please fill in the table if you have ever taken any of the following prescription or over-the-
counter pain medicines at least once a week, for at least 6 months?” 
2008-2011 
Newly diagnosed cases;  
any length; SIM 
SDH 
“How often have you taken the following over-the-counter medications during the PAST 5 
years?”. For the BEACON analysis, “nonusers” were those that responded never using the 
medication as well as those who reported using the medication ‘occasionally’, ‘less than 
once a month’, or ‘two to three times per month’. “Users” were those that reported using the 
medication ‘once a week’, ‘two to three times per week’, ‘four to seven times per week’, or 
‘two or more times per day’. 
2003-2006 
Newly diagnosed cases;  
any length; SIM. 
SRD 
“Here is a group of some over-the-counter medications that contain aspirin and are taken 
for pain or inflammation. Have you ever taken any of them at least once a week for three 
months or longer?”. Captured frequency (how often did you usually take any of these 
medications), start and stop dates, and total years taking medication. 
1997-2000 
Newly diagnosed cases; SIM.
