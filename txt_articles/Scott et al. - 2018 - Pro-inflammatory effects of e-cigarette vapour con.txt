Key messages
What is the key question?
 
► Do e-cigarettes have a negative impact on 
alveolar macrophage viability and function?
What is the bottom line?
 
► Vapourised e-cigarette fluid is cytotoxic, pro-
inflammatory and inhibits phagocytosis in 
alveolar macrophages.
Why read on?
 
► This work demonstrates a nicotine dependent 
and independent effect and also examines how 
these effects may be abrogated.
AbSTrACT 
Objective Vaping may increase the cytotoxic effects 
of e-cigarette liquid (ecl). We compared the effect of 
unvaped ecl to e-cigarette vapour condensate (ecVc) 
on alveolar macrophage (aM) function.
Methods aMs were treated with ecVc and nicotine-
free ecVc (nfecVc). aM viability, apoptosis, necrosis, 
cytokine, chemokine and protease release, reactive 
oxygen species (rOS) release and bacterial phagocytosis 
were assessed.
results Macrophage culture with ecl or ecVc resulted 
in a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability. ecVc 
was cytotoxic at lower concentrations than ecl and 
resulted in increased apoptosis and necrosis. nfecVc 
resulted in less cytotoxicity and apoptosis. exposure 
of aMs to a sub-lethal 0.5% ecVc/nfecVc increased 
rOS production approximately 50-fold and significantly 
inhibited phagocytosis. Pan and class one isoform 
phosphoinositide 3 kinase inhibitors partially inhibited 
the effects of ecVc/nfecVc on macrophage viability and 
apoptosis. Secretion of interleukin 6, tumour necrosis 
factor α, cXcl-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 
1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 was significantly 
increased following ecVc challenge. treatment with 
the anti-oxidant n-acetyl-cysteine (nac) ameliorated 
the cytotoxic effects of ecVc/nfecVc to levels not 
significantly different from baseline and restored 
phagocytic function.
Conclusions ecVc is significantly more toxic to aMs 
than non-vaped ecl. excessive production of rOS, 
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by 
e-cigarette vapour may induce an inflammatory state in 
aMs within the lung that is partly dependent on nicotine. 
inhibition of phagocytosis also suggests users may suffer 
from impaired bacterial clearance. While further research 
is needed to fully understand the effects of e-cigarette 
exposure in humans in vivo, we caution against the 
widely held opinion that e-cigarettes are safe.
InTrOduCTIOn
Electronic cigarettes, also known as electronic nico-
tine delivery systems (ENDS), were introduced over 
a decade ago and since 2010 the inhalation of e-cig-
arette vapour or ‘vaping’ has risen exponentially in 
both smokers and ex-smokers.1 There is a signif-
icant body of published material on ENDS/e-cig-
arettes and despite varying opinions their main 
effects remain controversial. They may be a useful 
tool for reducing traditional cigarette smoking but 
for many they are simply a replacement nicotine 
delivery method. As such they may precipitate a 
new public health problem.2 The public perception 
is that they are less of a health hazard than conven-
tional cigarette smoking, yet the long-term effects 
of e-cigarettes remain to be elucidated.2
E-cigarettes have developed significantly in the 
last decade, increasing in complexity and capacity. 
They are now considered to be in the fourth gener-
ation, comprising highly modifiable devices capable 
of modulating the energy input used to generate 
vapour. Using ever increasing energy input, 
sub-ohm atomiser resistances and custom mixtures 
for electronic cigarette liquid (ECL), the effect of 
user exposure is becoming more uncertain and 
potentially a new health hazard.3 4
Prior to vaping, ECL is composed of humectants 
such as vegetable glycerin (VG) and propylene glycol 
(PG) with or without nicotine. Several potentially 
cytotoxic metal and silicate particles are present in 
e-cigarette vapour equal to or exceeding the levels 
found in traditional cigarette smoke.5 6 Much of 
the current literature has focused on the effect of 
non-vapourised ECL or ECL condensate. However, 
such studies do not fully reflect the potential effect 
on an e-cigarette user as, importantly, the process of 
vaping itself causes changes in the chemical compo-
sition of ECL.7–11 Recently, some studies have 
attempted a more physiological approach using 
aqueous extract systems similar to those used to 
create traditional cigarette smoke extract (CSE),12 
although this also results in considerable dilution. 
In vivo studies have also been carried out using 
whole animal aerosol exposure systems, without 
vaping, which have also predominantly focused

on the effects on the lungs-.13 14 These studies showed exposure 
to unvaped fluid increased secretion of inflammatory markers, 
induced airway hyper-reactivity and caused lung tissue degra-
dation in chronic exposure.13 14 These studies demonstrated the 
potential negative impact of e-cigarette fluid exposure, however 
the proven change in composition caused by the vaping process 
has not been factored in these models.
For this study, we developed a novel system to generate e-cig-
arette vapour condensate (ECVC) to be a more physiological 
method of exposure. We hypothesised the change in chem-
ical composition caused by vaping would increase cytotoxicity 
and moreover the presence of nicotine would exacerbate any 
cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects. Alveolar macrophages 
(AMs) are a unique lung cell population that eliminate airborne 
irritants and infectious agents, while also coordinating the initia-
tion of resolution of lung inflammation.15
Disturbances in AM function could therefore increase the risk 
of infection and enhance susceptibility to chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). We also assessed the effects of our 
ECVC with and without nicotine on human AMs to determine 
if this is a key component and determine whether anti-oxidants 
abrogate any of the effects.
MeThOdS
Detailed methods are provided in the online supplement.
eCVC preparation
ECVC was prepared using a novel method employing six 
tracheal suction traps (Unomedical, Denmark) connected in 
series and cooled in a dry ice/methanol bath (see online supple-
mentary figure E1a). We calculated the optimal puff duration of 
3 
s every 30 
s based on published data.16–21 This allows time for 
the vapour to condense between each puff and prevented over-
heating of the device; 1.4 
mL of ECL/nicotine-free ECL (nfECL) 
was vaped from each device. On completion, suction traps were 
normalised to room temperature and spun at 1500g for 10 
min 
to collect the condensate.
e-cigarette devices
We chose a second-generation END, popular in the UK, 
to produce condensate (Kanger Ltd, Shenzhen, China; see 
online supplementary figure E1b). The devices were fitted with 
a standard 650 mAh battery with a fresh 1.8 Ohm coil head 
(atomiser) for each preparation.
e-cigarette liquids
ECLs with and without pharmaceutical grade nicotine were 
obtained from American E-liquids Store (Milwaukee County 
Research Park, Wauwatosa, WI, USA), which adheres to US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved good manu-
facturing standards and has been used in previous animal expo-
sure studies.13 To avoid confounders, only flavourless liquids 
were used. Nicotine containing ECL was 36 
mg/mL, nfECL was 
simply a 50:50 mixture of PG:VG.
Alveolar and ThP-1 macrophages
AMs from eight never smokers, five men and three women, 
with normal spirometry and no history of asthma/COPD were 
obtained by repeated saline lavage from non-affected lung 
resection specimens (see online supplement for full extraction 
methods).
THP-1 human monocytic leukaemia cells (European Collec-
tion of Cell Cultures) were differentiated into macrophages 
by stimulation with 0.2 
mM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(PMA) for 24 
hours. Adhered cells were rested in RPMI for 3 
days before use.22
Gas chromatography–flame ionisation detector assessment of 
nicotine content
Gas chromatography–flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) assess-
ment was performed by the University of Birmingham Chemistry 
Department to determine nicotine concentration. L-Nicotine 
standard (#10337220 Fisher Scientific, UK) was used as a refer-
ence standard for quantification.
Cellular methods
Viability was assessed using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solu-
tion (Roche, UK). Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry 
using an Annexin V assay (BD Biosciences, UK) in combination 
with the vital dye propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). 
CXCL-8, interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 
(MCP)-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and matrix metallo-
proteinase (MMP)-9 levels in cell-free supernatants were quan-
tified using commercially available ELISA kits (Biotechne, UK). 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using DCFDA 
assay (Abcam ab113851) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Phagocytosis assay was carried out using pHrodo 
Red Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus BioParticles (Invi-
trogen, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad PRISM 
6.0 software package (San Diego, California, USA). Results 
are expressed as the median with IQR, unless specified other-
wise. All results are representative of at least eight indepen-
dent experiments performed in duplicate. Differences between 
multiple treatments were compared by the Kruskal–Wallis test 
followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test correction. A 
P-value  ≤0.05 was considered to represent a statistically signif-
icant difference.
reSulTS
Inter-batch variability of unvaped eCl
All condensates used in this study were generated from two batches 
of ECL. GC-FID data (table 1A) suggested actual nicotine content 
of ECL was 31.0 
mg/mL and 30.7 
mg/mL for batch 1 and 2 respec-
tively. No nicotine was detected in nicotine-free liquids.
Validation of our model system of condensing vaped eCl
Detailed validation of our model of condensing vaped ECL is 
available in the online supplement (online supplementary figure 
E2). The model system proved both reliable and reproduc-
ible in terms of volume of recovery (60.8%), nicotine content 
(87%), as well as particulates (OD at 370 
nm, table 1B). There 
was no significant variance in biological activity between each 
fresh preparation (online supplementary figure E2), however 
biological activity was lost over time with storage at −80°C 
(online supplementary figure E3, P<0.0001).
eCVC is significantly more cytotoxic to AM than eCl
AMs were exposed to ECL and ECVC for 24 
hours, and 
produced a dos- dependent reduction in viability (figure 1). 
Unvaped ECL/nfECL effect on viability varied significantly 
compared with untreated control (UTC) following 2.5% (v/v) 
challenge (figure 1A, B): ECL: 78.8% viable (IQR 72.3%–87.6%, 
P<0.001), nfECL: 84.6% viable (IQR 83.9%–87.9%, P<0.001).

(Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles, respectively, and the vertical lines represent the range of values within the limits Q1–1.5 (Q3–Q1) and Q3–1.5 (Q3–Q1). 
n=8, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001. UTC, untreated control.
Contrastingly ECVC/nfECVC produced a greater reduction in 
viability following a 0.8% (v/v) challenge (figure 1C, D): ECVC: 
18.2% viable (IQR 15.7%–19.5%, P<0.001), nfECVC 62.8% 
viable (IQR 49.9%–68.1% 
p<0.0001) compared with UTC. 
Viability of AMs was maintained better in the nicotine-free 
challenge (nfECL/nfECVC), than that containing nicotine 
(figure 1A/C vs B/D), suggesting that although vaping signifi-
cantly increases the cytotoxic potential of ECL, much of the 
cytotoxic effect was nicotine dependent.
eCVC induces AM apoptosis and necrosis and is exaggerated 
by the presence of nicotine
AMs were exposed to 0.8% ECVC/nfECVC for 24 
hours 
and compared with UTC. After 24 
hours the majority of 
cells remained viable; median: 92.5% (IQR 91.5%–96.9%, 
(Annexin–/Pi-), with low levels of apoptosis (Annexin +cells): 
6.17% (IQR 2.63%–7.77%), and necrosis (Annexin–/PI+): 
1.9% (IQR 1.7%–4.4%) (figure 2).
After 24 
hours, total viable cells were significantly reduced 
when treated with either ECVC (40.87% alive, IQR 39.29%–
45.61%, P<0.0001) or nfECVC (77.94% alive, IQR 73.09%–
78.69%, P<0.01) compared with UTC.
ECVC exposure significantly increased apoptosis (37.7%, 
IQR 22.7%–54.9%, P<0.0001) and necrosis (16.3%, IQR 
12.1%–31.2%, P<0.001) compared with controls. Expo-
sure to nfECVC also increased apoptosis significantly (17.36, 
IQR 13.28%–19.4%, P<0.05), but not necrosis (9.27%, IQR 
8.3%–11.3%)
ECVC treatment induced significantly more apoptosis than 
nfECVC (17.4%, IQR 13.3%–19.4%, P<0.0001) and resulted 
in a greater total loss of viable cells after 24 
hours of treatment 
(P<0.0001). These data confirm the cytotoxic effects of ECVC 
and support both a nicotine-dependent and nicotine-indepen-
dent effect.
effect of eCVC on macrophage function
The effects of sub-lethal ECVC exposure were assessed using 
measures of macrophage function important in the innate 
immune response, namely ROS production, cytokine, chemo-
kine and protease release, as well as bacterial (Escherichia coli 
and Staphylococcus aureus) phagocytosis.
rOS are induced by eCVC treatment
ROS production was assessed following exposure of AMs to 
a sub-cytotoxic dose (0.5%) of ECVC/nfECVC for 4 
hours. 
Untreated macrophages showed a low baseline level of ROS 
production (figure 3) (1085, IQR 863.7–1133 relative fluores-
cence units (RFUs)). Condensate challenge resulted in a 50-fold 
increase in ROS production for both ECVC (53 858, IQR 
48 
375–56 425 RFU, P<0.0001) and nfECVC (48 746, IQR 
44 
238–56 063 RFU, P<0.0001) compared with UTC.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases are 
induced by 24 hour exposure to 0.5% eCVC
The effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and 
metalloprotease production is shown in figure 4. 0.5% ECVC 
significantly induced production of all analytes: IL-6 (P<000.1), 
TNF-α (P<0.001), CXCL8 (P<0.0001), MCP-1 (P<0.01) and 
matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) (P<0.0001) compared with 
UTC. The response to nfECVC was more variable, with a lower 
increase in IL-6 (P<0.001), CXCL-8 (P<0.0001) and MMP-9 
(P<0.0001) compared with UTC. Non-significant changes were 
also seen for TNF-α and MCP-1.

eCVC significantly inhibits phagocytosis by AM and ThP-1 
macrophages
Incubation of AMs with ECVC and nfECVC reduced pHrodo 
E. coli BioParticle phagocytosis by 30% (P<0.0001) and 50.2% 
respectively (P<0.0001, figure 5A).
Incubation of THP-1 macrophages with ECVC and nfECVC 
reduced pHrodo E. coli BioParticle phagocytosis by 41.7% 
(P<0.0001) and 48.5% respectively (P<0.0001, figure 5B).
Incubation of THP-1 macrophages with ECVC and nfECVC 
reduced pHrodo S. aureus BioParticles phagocytosis by 60.9% 
(P<0.0001) and 62.9% respectively (P<0.0001, online supple-
mentary figure E4).
The effect of n-acetyl cysteine treatment following eCVC 
challenge
ROS production in response to cigarette smoking (or smoke 
extract) has been implicated as a mediator of adverse effects,23 
therefore we examined the possible utility of N-acetyl cysteine 
(NAC) treatment in reducing the harmful effects of ECVC in 
THP-1 macrophages. Both AM and THP-1 macrophages were 
used for these experiments due to the large number of experi-
mental conditions and numbers of cells required.
nAC can ameliorate the cytotoxic effects of eCVC on ThP-1 
derived macrophages
Similar to our observations in AMs, ECVC and nfECVC 
were cytotoxic to THP-1-derived macrophages (24.4%, 
IQR 21.8%–27.4%, P<0.0001; 62.8%, IQR 54.4%–68.4%, 
P<0.0001, respectively(. 1 mM NAC treatment given simul-
taneously with condensate challenge prevented the effects 
on viability of both ECVC and nfECVC compared with UTC 
(figure 6A).
nAC can ameliorate the pro-apoptotic effects of eCVC on 
ThP-1-derived macrophages
ECVC challenge of THP-1 macrophages increased apoptosis to 
36.1% (IQR 35.8%–39.8%, P<0.0001, figure 5B). Exposure 
to nfECVC increased apoptosis to a lesser degree (18.8%, IQR 
13.8%–20.2%, P<0.0001, figure 6B). NAC treatment given 
simultaneously with condensate challenge significantly reduced 
apoptosis in both ECVC (5.9%, IQR 4.6%–7.4%, P<0.0001) 
and nfECVC (4.5%, IQR 2.4%–4.6%, P<0.0001) challenged 
cells (figure 5B).

nAC can restore phagocytic function of eCVC-treated 
macrophages
Incubation of AMs with ECVC and nfECVC reduced pHrodo 
E. coli BioParticle phagocytosis (figure 6A). NAC (1 
mM) given 
simultaneously with ECVC/nfECVC restored phagocytic func-
tion (P<0.001), although not to pretreatment levels (figure 7A).
Using THP-1 macrophages, an increased dose of NAC treat-
ment was assessed to determine if a greater protective effect 
could be achieved. ECVC treatment reduced phagocytosis of E. 
coli pHrodo BioParticles by 41.9% (figure 6B, P<0.0001) and 
nfECVC by 48.4% (figure 7B, P<0.0001). Simultaneous treat-
ment with NAC (5 
mM) restored phagocytic function to levels 
comparable to  the  control (figure 6B, P<0.0001). Higher doses 
of NAC had an even greater restorative effect on cell function.
Phagocytosis of S. aureus pHrodo bioparticles was also signifi-
cantly restored by simultaneous NAC treatment. (Online supple-
mentary figure E4)
eCVC effects on ThP-1 macrophage viability and apoptosis 
are attenuated by inhibitors of phosphopinositol 3 kinase
ROS-induced lung inflammation in COPD has been reported to 
be associated with  phosphopinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) activation.24 
To explore a role for PI3K in ECVC-induced responses we used 
the pan- inhibitor LY294002 (5 
nM) as well as an isoform selec-
tive inhibitor (PIK75 10 
nM).
Both general PI3K inhibition (online supplementary figure 
E5a) and PI3K α isoform inhibitor (PIK-75, figure 8) attenuated 
the effects of ECVC (Ly294002; 37.4%, PIK75; 35% increase 
in viability compared with ECVC, P<0.0001). This protective 
effect was also evident when cells were challenged with nfECVC 
(Ly294002 25%, PIK75 29.2% increase in viability compared 
with nfECVC, P<0.0001). PI3K inhibition was also shown to 
partially restore phagocytic capacity (online supplementary 
figure E6), after challenge with sub-cytotoxic levels of both 
ECVC (Ly294002; 21.3%, PIK75; 23.2% restoration compared 
with ECVC alone, P<0.005) and nfECVC (Ly294002; 25.8%, 
PIK75; 20.9% compared with nfECVC alone, P<0.005).

which the vaping process accentuates. At sub-cytotoxic doses, 
ECVC enhances production of ROS, inflammatory cytokines, 
chemokines and metalloproteinases, although the response is 
less pronounced with nfECVC. Bacterial phagocytosis by macro-
phages is inhibited acutely by ECVC and the effects are atten-
uated by the anti-oxidant NAC, suggesting ROS and reactive 
aldehydes play a role in the effects of ECVC/nfECVC. These 
effects appear to be partially PI3K dependent.
We have confirmed that vaping exaggerates the cytotoxic effects 
of ECL, inducing both cellular apoptosis and necrosis. These effects 
were seen when AMs were treated with both ECVC and nfECVC, 
suggesting both nicotine dependent and independent mechanisms.
Several studies have examined the change in composition of 
e-cigarette vapour,2 3 7–11 and have identified many different 
chemicals that could be toxic, including free radicals, particu-
lates, formaldehyde, nitrosamines, volatile organic compounds 
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.3 8 Importantly, the levels 
of several of these toxicants have been reported to be increased 
after vapourisation, due to heat and/or 
voltage generated by 
the battery in e-cigarettes.2 3 7–11 Many variables affect constit-
uents of the vapour produced: the nicotine content, the ratio 
of humectants PG and VG present, the energy input used in 
the vapourising process, and the temperature achieved are all 
important factors.

E-cigarette vapour has been reported to contain up to 
7×1011 
free radicals per puff.10 Both nicotine-free and nico-
tine-containing condensate induced a significant increase in ROS 
release from our AMs, which may explain the induction of apop-
tosis in nicotine-free liquid. There was significantly greater ROS 
production in AMs treated with nicotine-containing conden-
sate than in nicotine-free condensate, once again suggesting 
both nicotine dependent and independent mechanisms at work. 
Consistent with our results, nicotine has been shown to increase 
ROS production in both epithelial cells25 and macrophages.26 A 
recent patient study by Reidel et al examined the protein content 
of induced sputum in e-cigarette users and smokers.27 In support 
of our findings, proteomic analysis showed significant upregu-
lation of oxidative stress-related proteins in both smokers and 
vapers, such as MMP-9, known to be implicated in inflamma-
tory lung diseases such as COPD. The effects of ECVC with and 
without were ameliorated by NAC and PI3K inhibition.
Sub-lethal exposure of AMs to ECVC induced significantly 
more cytokine, chemokine and MMP-9 production than 
nfECVC. Others have similarly reported a significant induction 
of IL-6 and CXCL-8 in H292 cells following exposure to ECL 
but not following nfECL challenge.28 The importance of nico-
tine in ECL is reflected in the lesser effect on cytokine release 
and was also recently confirmed in vivo in a murine aerosol 
model using unvaped fluid.5
Detection and phagocytosis of pathogens is key to macro-
phage function and in many cases is the first step in orchestrating 
an immune response to infection in the airways. Any effect of 
e-cigarette vapour on the phagocytic ability of AMs is there-
fore of potential significance to the innate immune response in 
vivo. At sub-cytotoxic levels both ECVC and nfECVC inhibited 
phagocytosis of E. coli and S. aureus, suggesting vaping might 
significantly impair bacterial clearance. Our data are supported 
by murine models in which mice exposed to e-cigarette vapour 
showed significantly impaired pulmonary bacterial clear-
ance compared with air-exposed mice following an intranasal 
infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. This defective bacte-
rial clearance was due to reduced phagocytosis by AMs from 
e-cigarette vapour exposed mice.29 A recent human volunteer 
study30 found e-cigarette vapour significantly increased plate-
let-activating factor receptor (PAFR) expression, which aids 
pneumococcal adhesion to airway cells. In vitro PAFR is signifi-
cantly upregulated by inducers of oxidative stress such as tradi-
tional cigarette smoke. Miyashita et al demonstrated increased 
PAFR leads to increased pneumococcal adhesion.30 A broader 
study also found risk of bronchitic symptoms was increased 
by almost twofold among e-cigarette users.31 These studies in 
human volunteers support our suggestion that e-cigarette usage 
may lead to increased or more serious respiratory tract infec-
tions, however further community-based studies will be required 
to fully assess the effect on lung health of e-cigarette users.
Interestingly, in these experiments nfECVC produced a 
greater inhibitory effect than ECVC on phagocytosis. Activation 
of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) has been shown to 
upregulate phagocytosis in tissue-resident macrophages.32 Nico-
tine may therefore be offsetting some of the inhibitory effects in 
both ECVC and nfECVC, which are working through a nico-
tine-independent mechanism.
Cytotoxic compounds generated during the vaping process,3 8 
such as reactive aldehyde species—formaldehyde, acetyl alde-
hyde and acrolein—are known to induce apoptosis by lipid 
peroxidation.33 Reactive aldehydes further cause the accu-
mulation of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) which can induce 
apoptosis via the Fas-mediated and P53-dependent pathways. 
HNE formation can also be caused by inflammation-induced 
ROS.34 35 With this in mind, we performed experiments using 
THP-1-derived macrophages challenged with a cytotoxic dose 
(0.8%) of ECVC/nfECVC in the presence and absence of NAC, a 
well characterised anti-oxidant and anti-aldehyde. NAC signifi-
cantly attenuated both the cytotoxic activity and pro-apoptotic 
effects of condensate with or without nicotine. As shown with 
AMs, in THP-1 macrophages, ECVC caused significantly greater 
loss of viability and significantly more apoptosis than nfECVC, 
again suggesting a nicotine dependent and independent mecha-
nism of action.
Traditional cigarette smoking is implicated as the cause of 
COPD in at least 20% of smokers, which is characterised by 
increased neutrophilic inflammation and oxidative stress within 
the lung.24 36 37 The effects of oxidative stress in epithelial 
cells are mediated through micro-RNA34a via activation of 
PI3Kα.24 Micro-RNA34a has been implicated in accelerated 
cellular senescence, inducing a proliferative, apoptotic pheno-
type. These effects were aborogated by use of PI3K inhibitors 
restoring the baseline phenotype.24 Nicotine receptor seven is 
highly expressed on alveolar macrophages and its activation 
has also been shown to activate PI3K.38 39 We therefore exam-
ined the effects of pan PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 and class one 
isoform selective inhibitor PIK-75 on THP-1-derived macro-
phages. There was a significant protective effect after PI3K inhi-
bition with Ly294002. This effect was mostly conserved when 
class one isoform inhibitor PIK-75 was used. PIK-75 selectively 
inhibits the p110α subunit 200-fold more potently than p110β 
subunit, suggesting a large portion of the activity is moderated 
through the class one isoform. However, further work remains 
to be carried out to fully elucidate the mechanism(s) of action of 
ECVC/nfECVC on AMs.
This study has limitations. First, we have used an in vitro study 
on primary AMs with exposure levels which may not be physi-
ological but are more reflective of the inhalant. In addition, the 
nicotine-containing ECL we selected has been shown to induce 
changes reflective of COPD in mice, suggesting the results have 
physiological plausibility. Second it is difficult to determine an 
optimal dose of nicotine exposure. In this study we have used 
0.8% ECVC (containing 208 
µg/mL nicotine) and 0.5% ECVC 
(containing 130 
µg/mL nicotine). It is not possible to determine 
a standard nicotine dose for smoking experiments as each indi-
vidual will titrate their nicotine intake to match their requirement. 
An average cigarette has 10–14 
mg of nicotine,40 and while the 
majority of this nicotine is not absorbed, intake is approximately 
1–1.5 
mg.41 Puffing topography studies of e-cigarette users16 20 have 
shown nicotine intake of approximately 1.2 
mg in a 20 
min vaping 
session, with users also titrating intake to maintain their specific 
plasma nicotine concentration. There is a lack of information about 
epithelial lining fluid levels of nicotine in smokers. AM exposure in 
vivo will also vary according to techniques used by users to modify 
their nicotine intake, such as depth and frequency of intake as well 
as breath-holding/expiration.16 20 42
Third, our model represents an acute exposure, rather than a 
chronic exposure system which is better suited to in vivo animal 
experiments. Fourth, there is currently a huge disparity in the 
literature regarding e-cigarettes. Many groups have championed 
the benign nature of ECL while others have shown the cytotoxic 
effects of ECL in vitro and in vivo. This disparity may reflect 
the lack of a standardised model of in vitro cellular exposure and 
interpretation. Therefore, until a gold standard is established, 
continued controversy is likely. However, our model seeks to 
replicate the actual exposure of the users’ AMs post vaping. We 
believe this is an important step in establishing an in vitro system

by which to investigate the effects of e-cigarettes on the airways. 
Finally, we have not assessed the effects of flavours on cellular 
effects,43 partly because this adds another layer of uncertainty 
and potential confounders. However, the data provide a back-
ground on which to study these other potential factors, with and 
without nicotine.
In conclusion, we sought to replicate the potential effects 
of exposure of the user in an acute in vitro system using our 
vaping-condensate technique. We show a significant increase 
in cytotoxicity caused by the vaping process itself. Importantly, 
exposure of macrophages to ECVC induced many of the same 
cellular and functional changes in AM function seen in cigarette 
smokers and patients with COPD. While further research is 
needed to fully understand the effects of e-cigarette exposure in 
humans in vivo, we suggest continued caution against the widely 
held opinion that e-cigarettes are safe.
