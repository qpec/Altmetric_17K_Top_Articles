Abstract
While most pain is acute, resolving within a few days or weeks, millions of Americans suffer from 
persistent or recurring pain that may become chronic and debilitating. Medications may provide 
only partial relief from this chronic pain and can be associated with unwanted side effects. As a 
result, many individuals turn to complementary health approaches as part of their pain 
management strategy. This article examines the clinical trial evidence for the efficacy and safety of 
several specific approaches – acupuncture, manipulation, massage therapy, relaxation techniques 
including meditation, selected natural product supplements (chondroitin, glucosamine, 
methylsulfonylmethane, S-adenoysl methionine), tai chi, and yoga – as used to manage chronic 
pain and related disability associated with back pain, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, neck pain, and 
severe headaches or migraines.
INTRODUCTION
The most recent national estimate suggests that 126 million adults suffer from some pain in 
a given year1 with about one-third (40 million adults) suffering from severe pain. Pain is 
often associated with poor general health, health-related disability and increased health care 
utilization.2 Yet according to the Institute of Medicine (2011),2 pain is routinely undertreated 
in health care; pain care that is provided is often fragmented, without a comprehensive 
assessment or treatment plan, and patients may encounter difficulty obtaining the full range 
of potential treatments.
Back pain, joint pain, neck pain and headaches are among the most common types of pain 
experienced by US adults (Table 1).3–6 The prevalence rates for these conditions have

 remained relatively stable over time. Among the many pharmacological and non-
pharmacological approaches that have been incorporated into pain management strategies 
are complementary health approaches. This broad category of care includes procedures by 
licensed providers such as acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists, as well as 
self-care approaches such as relaxation techniques (e.g., meditation), and meditative 
movement-based approaches (e.g., yoga and tai chi), as well as natural products such a 
glucosamine and herbal medicines. National surveys going back more than 25 years have 
consistently found that these complementary approaches are used by about 30% to 40% of 
the US public in a given year,7–11 although use of a given approach may wax and wane over 
time (Table 2).
While a substantial part of this use is for overall wellness and prevention,12,13 painful 
conditions are the most common health conditions for which individuals turn to these 
complementary approaches.7, 8, 10, 11, 14 In 2007, for example, about 14.3 million adults 
used a complementary health approach for their back pain, while about 5.0 million used 
these approaches for their neck pain, and 3.1 million for their arthritis.7 Far fewer 
individuals used complementary health approaches for other chronic diseases such as 
depression (1.0 million), hypertension (0.8 million), diabetes (0.7 million) or cancer (0.4 
million).
Based on national survey data,14 this high use of complementary health approaches for 
painful conditions translated into $8.5 billion out-of-pocket for these approaches to manage 
back pain, $3.6 billion to manage neck pain, and $2.3 billion to manage arthritis. 
Substantially less is spent out-of-pocket on complementary health approaches to treat other 
chronic health conditions such as depression ($1.1 billion), hypertension ($0.7 billion), 
diabetes ($0.3 billion), and cancer ($0.2 billion).
Given the high use of complementary health approaches for pain, a number of specific 
complementary approaches have undergone mechanistic and clinical evaluations 
culminating in phase III trials. This article examines the clinical trial evidence for the 
efficacy, effectiveness and safety of several widely used approaches – acupuncture, 
manipulation, massage therapy, relaxation techniques including meditation, selected natural 
product supplements (e.g., chondroitin and glucosamine) tai chi, and yoga (defined in 
Supplemental Appendix 1) – as used to manage chronic pain and related disability 
associated with back pain, osteoarthritis, neck pain, and severe headaches or migraines, 
conditions frequently seen and managed in the primary care setting. Fibromyalgia was 
included in this review as an example of a complex pain syndrome that is often managed 
with a multi-modal approach that may include complementary approaches. Cancer pain is 
certainly a major public health concern but is more likely to be addressed outside of the 
primary care setting (e.g., by oncologists, at cancer centers, as part of palliative care, etc.).
The randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) is considered the strongest study design for 
investigating the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of pharmacological, behavior, and 
physical interventions. To identify examples of RCT’s for each complementary approach, 
we performed searches of the MEDLINE database for articles published from 1966 through 
March, 2016 using the search strategy outlined in Supplemental Appendix 2. In order to

 make this review as relevant as possible to the primary care provider in the US, we limit this 
review to RCT’s either done in the US or that included participants from the US. This 
decision is based on two factors. First, the unique health care system in the US versus other 
countries means that the standard care or usual care control groups used in the US and other 
countries may vary substantially. Thus whether or not a given complementary approach 
performs better than usual care in another country may not reflect how the approach would 
perform in US trials. Another factor is that the training and licensure of acupuncturists, 
chiropractors and naturopathic doctors vary substantially among countries, as does the 
marketing, regulation and use of dietary supplements. For instance, in Germany, the location 
of some of the largest acupuncture trials, acupuncture is only practiced by medical doctors, 
while the vast majority of acupuncture treatment in the US is provided by licensed 
acupuncturists. Thus, the findings from German trials may not be directly comparable to 
acupuncture as practiced in the US.
Brief summaries of the reviewed RCTs are presented below with details provided in online 
supplemental tables. The findings of these RCTs also illustrate several methodological 
issues that should be considered when interpreting the trial data. These issues are 
summarized briefly at the end of this article,
LOW BACK PAIN
Acupuncture
We found four RCT’s (total participants = 1,092)15–18 that assessed the clinical benefit of 
acupuncture for treatment of low back pain (LBP) (age range: 28–60, mostly white race), 
and used primary study outcomes of self-report of pain intensity (numeric rating scale 
[NRS] or visual analog scale [VAS]) and/or functional disability (Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire [RMDQ], Oswestry Disability index [ODI], or Disability Rating Index). 
Cherkin et al. (200115 & 200916) both reported modest improvement in pain intensity and 
function compared to usual care. In pregnant women using auricular acupuncture, Wang et 
al. (2009)17 found a significant reduction in pain intensity and function compared to no 
treatment control. Comparison of verum- to sham-acupuncture had mixed results with two 
RCTS16, 18 finding no significant difference and 1 RCT17 finding a slight but significant 
difference. No significant adverse events were reported.
Massage Therapy
We summarize seven RCTs studying the use of massage for LBP15, 19–25 (total participants 
= 829). Massage types included Swedish/relaxation, structural, structural integration, and 
muscle energy; sessions varied in duration from 15 – 90 minutes. For chronic LBP (cLBP), 2 
larger studies15, 19 reporting massage compared to usual care resulted in modest 
improvements in pain and function at 10 weeks, but the benefit was not sustained at 52 
weeks.15 Three smaller studies compared massage to either usual outpatient rehabilitation24 
or relaxation22, 23 and did not observe significant between-group differences for pain and/or 
function. For acute or subacute LBP, 2 smaller studies found significant, albeit modest, 
improvements in pain compared to no treatment (−1.5 pts. NRS) 21 or function (−18% 
ODI)25 compared to a putative placebo. No RCTs reported significant adverse events.

 Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy
Six RCTs of osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT) for LBP are reviewed (total 
participants = 1308).26–31 2 RCTs examined OMT compared to sham-OMT for cLBP30, 31 
using similar intervention paradigms and reported mixed results with 1 not finding any 
significant difference and 1 showing a −9mm reduction in pain intensity (VAS). 2 RCTs 
compared OMT to usual care for acute or subacute LBP26, 27 and both reported no 
significant improvement for function/disability but mixed results for pain intensity for 
between-group differences. In pregnant women with LBP, 2 studies compared the benefit of 
adding OMT or a placebo-ultrasound to usual obstetric care, and reported significant, 
modest improvements with added care but no significant between-group differences.28, 29 
No RCTs reported significant adverse events.
Spinal Manipulation
We reviewed 24 RCTs32–55 (total participants = 4503, all adults) of spinal manipulation 
(SM) for LBP. Recent data suggest that for cLBP, the “dose” of SM (defined as the # of 
sessions) may affect outcomes,45, 46, 56 and hence the dose utilized was dichotomized for 
this report depending upon whether 6+ sessions of SM were provided in a given study. No 
RCTs reported significant adverse events.
Chronic LBP—There were 9 studies of SM for cLBP (total participants = 
1882),32, 35–37, 40, 44–46, 50 8 of which employed 6+ sessions for treatment, and 1 of these 
studies was principally (> 2/3) of adult women.32 For the 4 larger RCTs (each with 200+ 
participants)37, 44, 46, 50 that compared HVLA-SM to an active comparison (exercise, usual 
care, physical therapy, light touch), 3 found significant, albeit modest, between-group 
differences for pain intensity and/or function. 2 studies directly examined dose of HVLA-
SM45, 46 and both found the higher doses (12 and 18 sessions of SM) provided larger 
improvement at 12 and 52 weeks, respectively. 1 RCT utilized a putative placebo-SM32 and 
found that after the first session that verum-SM > sham-SM > no treatment, but at 2 weeks, 
there were no significant between-group differences. 1 RCT compared thrust to non-thrust 
SM40 (less than 6 sessions) and reported no significant between-group differences.
Acute, sub-acute, or mixed LBP—There were 15 studies of SM for either acute, 
subacute, or a mixture of types of LBP (total participants = 
2621).33, 34, 38, 39, 41–43, 47–49, 51–55 Six of these studies were of modest – moderate size (i.e., 
> 100 participants) and utilized 6+ sessions of SM.38, 42, 49, 51, 53, 54 The results of these 
studies were mixed with some demonstrating modest, significant benefit of SM compared to 
active intervention (physical therapy, back school, medication, usual care) at ~4 weeks for 
pain intensity and/or function,42, 49, 54 but others not reporting significant between-group 
differences.38, 51, 53 1 RCT examined pregnant women with LBP42 and found that adding 
SM + exercise to usual obstetric care provided modest improvement in pain and function/
disability.
There were 5 studies of SM for either acute and/or subacute LBP that used less than 6 
treatment sessions,33, 39, 41, 47, 55 but only 1 of these (and the largest) was an effectiveness 
study: Fritz et al. (2015)41 did a RCT of 4 sessions over 4 weeks of SM + exercise vs. usual

 primary care and found at 3 months significant between-group improvement in function 
(−3.2 pts ODI). The other 4 studies (sample sizes ranged from 54 – 123) compared different 
types of SM and/or SM to an active intervention (e.g., exercise). In general, these 4 studies 
reported that all groups improved and there were very small or no significant between-group 
differences; though it is unclear whether these 4 studies were sufficiently powered to 
definitively ascertain whether differences existed.
There were 4 studies of SM that by design had mixed LBP34, 48, 52, 53 (i.e., the inclusion 
criteria allowed participants with acute, sub-acute, or chronic LBP; 3 of these studies 
utilized 6+ treatment sessions. All studies had 1 or more active comparison groups (e.g., 
massage, electrical stimulation, usual care, steroid injection, physical therapy), and in all 
studies, all groups improved but there were no significant between-group differences.
Yoga
Six RCTs of yoga for cLBP57–62 are examined (total participants = 596, all adults, 
predominantly female). Three named forms of yoga were studied: hatha,57, 58 viniyoga,59, 60 
and Iyengar;61, 62 all were done in group settings, with class durations from 60 – 90 minutes, 
and number of sessions ranging from 12 – 24, either once or twice per week, with 
recommendations for home practice. Compared to usual care, 2 studies59, 60 found yoga 
provided improvements in pain bothersomeness and function, but the results were mixed 
when compared to exercise/stretching. A dose-response study57 compared 1/week to 2/week 
classes and found both had equivalent improvements in pain intensity and function. 3 
smaller studies compared yoga to wait-list58, 61 or education control62 and reported 
significant, modest reductions in pain intensity and function/disability. No RCTs reported 
significant adverse events.
Additional information on all back pain RCT’s can be found in Supplemental Table 1.
FIBROMYLGIA
All trials we reviewed for fibromyalgia used the 1990 American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR) classification criteria63 except for one64 that used an older definition.
Acupuncture
Four RCT’s examined acupuncture versus sham acupuncture for pain, physical function, 
global well-being, sleep, fatigue, and adverse events.65–68 Martin et al. (2006)68 found a 
significant improvement between the electro-acupuncture versus a sham electro-acupuncture 
control group. Differences were seen on the Fibromyalgia, Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), on 
fatigue and on anxiety. No other trial found significant differences between groups on any 
outcome. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of these studies. In one study, 
minor adverse events (e.g. discomfort at site of needle insertion or simulation of needles) 
were reported by 89% of participants.65

 Relaxation Techniques
Two studies (93 total participants, mostly female and white) looked at biofeedback versus 
control groups (attention control and placebo) as a treatment for symptoms of 
fibromyalgia.64, 69 Buckelew et al. (1998)64 saw a significant improvement in the Tender 
Point Index in the biofeedback group versus an attention control but not for any other 
outcome measure. Nelson et al. (2010)69 did not find any differences between biofeedback 
and a placebo biofeedback. A small study (90 women) found that MBSR significantly 
reduced perceived stress, sleep disturbance, and lessened the severity of symptoms in 
persons with fibromyalgia versus a waitlist control group.70 Another RCT examined the 
effects of Affective Self-Awareness, a technique that places primary importance on the 
awareness and expression of emotions underlying fibromyalgia symptoms, on 45 women 
with fibromyalgia, and found significant pain reduction and improved physical functioning 
versus a waitlist control group.71 Astin et al. (2003)72 examined the effects of an 
intervention combining mindfulness meditation and qi gong and found that the combined 
intervention was no better than an educational/support control group for pain, depression, 
and physical functioning. Two studies73, 74 (112 total participants, mostly female) examined 
guided imagery versus usual care control as a treatment for symptoms of fibromyalgia. One 
study74 found a significant decrease in the FIQ compared to the usual care control group. 
The second study73 found positive effects of guided imagery on pain intensity, fatigue, and 
depression versus the control group. Both studies found improvements in self-efficacy for 
managing symptoms. Only one study69 reported on adverse events and there were none 
noted.
Massage
A small study (12 women) examined Swedish massage versus myofascial release therapy for 
fibromyalgia symptoms.75 No difference was seen between groups on the FIQ.
Tai Chi
A study of 98 adults with fibromyalgia, aged 40 and over, mostly white and female, 
compared Yang style tai chi (modified for fibromyalgia patients) with an educational control 
and found that the tai chi group had a greater decrease in the FIQ76. Another study (59 
adults with fibromyalgia) compared Yang style tai chi to a control combining wellness 
education and stretching classes, and found that the tai chi group had greater improvement in 
the FIQ.77
Yoga
A small study (53 women) looked at yoga versus waitlist for management of fibromyalgia 
symptoms and found that those practicing yoga had significant improvement in the FIQ.78 
No adverse events were noted.

 NECK PAIN
Massage
Four randomized controlled trials examined whether massage could relieve symptoms 
associated with chronic neck pain.79–82 One study did not report patient demographics, the 
others studied subjects ages 20 to 64. Primary outcomes included The Neck Disability Index 
(NDI), an 11 point neck bothersome score, the VAS pain scale, and range of motion (ROM). 
Sherman et al. (2009)81 found significant improvement on the NDI for those randomized to 
10 massage therapy session over 10 weeks versus those assigned to a self-care book on 
managing neck problems. In an RCT by Field et al.,80 individuals were randomized to either 
a wait list control, or 30 minutes of massage therapy weekly for 4 weeks combined with 
daily self-massage. At the completion of the intervention, those assigned to massage therapy 
showed improvements in pain and range of motion compared to the control group. Sherman 
et al.82 demonstrated a dose response relationship between the number and duration of 
message sessions per week and improvement in the NDI and neck pain intensity. The 
findings indicated that 60 minutes of massage for 2 to 3 times per week was significantly 
better than either 30 or 60 minutes of massage once per week after the 4 weeks of treatment. 
In a follow-up to Sherman et al. (2014),82 Cook et al. (2015)79 re-consented and randomized 
participants to one additional massage therapy session per week for 6 additional weeks. 
Those randomized to the booster sessions had significantly improved pain and function 
verses those that did not receive the booster at the end of treatment; the difference between 
groups was no longer significant after 14 weeks of follow-up.
Spinal manipulation
We reviewed three randomized trials of spinal manipulation for neck pain.83–85 One study 
assessed manipulation compared to mobilization with a 2×2×2 factorial design: with or 
without heat, or with or without electrical muscle stimulation (EMS);84 no significant 
differences in outcomes were seen between groups. Evans et al.83 compared spinal 
manipulation combined with supervised exercising to supervised exercising alone and also 
to home exercise. After completion of the 12-week intervention, no difference was seen 
between spinal manipulation combined with supervised exercising and supervised exercising 
alone; however, both these groups showed significant improvement in neck pain versus only 
home exercise. Maiers et al.85 assessed the efficacy of three groups: 1) manipulation plus 
home exercise; 2) versus supervised rehabilitation exercise plus home exercise; and 3) home 
exercise alone. Spinal manipulation with home exercise produced significantly better 
reduction in pain than home exercise alone. No significant difference was seen between 
manipulation and home exercise, versus supervised rehabilitation exercise plus home 
exercise.
There was one RCT of manual cervical distraction,86 a traction-based therapy with low, 
medium, and high forces assessed. The goal of the study was to identify a viable sham-
control (see Supplemental Table 3 for details). The study endpoints included pain VAS, NDI, 
and credibility and expectancy questionnaire. The investigators did report benefit in medium 
or high force interventions.

OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE
Acupuncture
Four RCT’s examined whether acupuncture needling could relieve symptoms associated 
with osteoarthritis of the knee.87–90 These studies used similar definitions of knee OA. 
Participants were predominately female; had mean ages between 60 and 65; and had knee 
pain for an average of 9 to 11 years. All studies incorporated either the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities (WOMAC) arthritis Index total score or the WOMAC pain subscore 
as the primary outcomes. In two of the trials,89, 90 no difference was seen between verum 
acupuncture and sham acupuncture for either the primary or secondary outcome measure. 
The third trial87 using a sham control saw significantly better improvement in both the 
WOMAC pain subscale and function subscale after 14 weeks of treatment. For the three 
trials that also incorporated either an attention control87 or standard care controls,88, 90 
verum acupuncture produced significantly better improvement in primary and secondary 
outcomes than did the control group. Across trials, adverse events associated with 
acupuncture were few in number with the most common complaints being pain at the 
needling site and muscle soreness that resolved soon after the treatment session ended.
Glucosamine and Chondroitin
We reviewed eight RCT’s examining the efficacy of two dietary supplements, glucosamine 
and/or chondroitin, in individuals with knee OA.91–98 These studies varied substantially in 
how knee OA was defined, as well as in the primary outcome measures used (see 
Supplemental Table 4).
Three different configurations of glucosamine were used: glucosamine hydrochloride 
(HCl),93–95 glucosamine sulfate,91, 92, 98 and glucosamine bound to a polymer.97 One trial 
did not identify the configuration of glucosamine.96 Doses of glucosamine varied from 1000 
mg per day for 6 weeks98 to 1500 mg per day for 24 weeks.91, 95 Chondroitin sulfate was 
studied in two trials at a dose 1200 mg/day for 6 months91, 95 and in one trial at the same 
dose but for 8 weeks.93
All studies employed a placebo control group. Participants in two trials were made up 
exclusively93 or predominately of males;96 participants in four other trials were 
predominately females;91, 94, 95, 98 the remaining two trial were closely balanced in men and 
women.92, 97 Mean participant ages for the trials varied from 45 years of age93 to 72 years of 
age.95
Mixed results were found in trials comparing glucosamine versus a placebo control with 
pain relief or functional improvement as the primary outcomes. Three trials found 
glucosamine superior to placebo,92, 97, 98 and three trials failed to see a difference between 
groups.91, 94, 96
Mixed results were seen in the three trials studying a combination of glucosamine and 
chondroitin. Leffler et al.93 found that a combination of glucosamine HCl and chondroitin

 sulfate (and manganese acerbate) was superior to placebo for providing pain relief. In two 
other trials, the combination of glucosamine (either sulfate or HCl) and chondroitin sulfate 
were no better than placebo for either pain relief or function.91, 95
Across trials, adverse events were generally mild (gastrointestinal distress being the most 
common) with no differences seen between those taking glucosamine or chondroitin and 
those taking placebo.
Massage therapy
Two RCT’s studied the efficacy of Swedish massage therapy for symptoms associated with 
osteoarthritis of the knee.99, 100 The two studies were similar in that both: 1) defined knee 
OA using the American College of Rheumatology criteria;101 2) required a baseline score of 
at least 40 on the visual analog pain scale; 3) participants were predominately white females. 
In the earlier study100, after completing the 8 week intervention, participants in the massage 
group saw significant improvement versus those randomized to Usual Care in the WOMAC 
Arthritis Index, as well as in each of the WOMAC subscales: pain, function and joint 
stiffness. In a dosing study,99 individuals were randomized to one of five groups for 8 
weeks: 1) Usual care; 2) 240 minutes of massage over 8 weeks; 3) 360 minutes of massage; 
4) 480 minutes of massage; and 5) 600 minutes of massage. Only individuals receiving at 
least 480 minutes of massage therapy (groups 4 and 5), saw substantial improvement in the 
WOMAC OA index and the WOMAC Pain subscale versus the Usual Care group. Across 
the two trials only one adverse event, discomfort at the knee in one participant, was noted.
Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)
One RCT compared MSM (6 grams/day for 12 weeks) to a placebo control.102 Knee OA 
was based on ACR criteria.101 Outcome measures were the WOMAC arthritis subscales for 
pain, function, and stiffness. Individuals randomized to MSM saw significant improvement 
in both the WOMAC pain and functions scales. However, the authors cautioned that the 
differences between groups were small (<20%) and probably not clinical meaningful. No 
difference in adverse events was seen between groups.
S-Adenoysl methionine (SAMe)
One RCT compared the dietary supplement SAMe (1200 mg/day) to celecoxib (200 mg/day 
for 16 weeks in a cross-over design that included a one-week washout period.103 Knee OA 
was defined based on ACR criteria:102 the population was primarily female and white. The 
primary outcomes were VAS pain scores, WOMAC arthritis subscales for pain, function, 
and stiffness, and clinician assessments of OA severity. By the end of the trial, no differences 
were seen between the two treatment arms on any of the outcomes measures. However, the 
sample size was insufficient to establish equivalency. Overall adverse events were less 
common in those taking SAMe then those taking celecoxib.
Tai Chi
We reviewed four RCT’s that examined the efficacy of Tai Chi in those with confirmed knee 
osteoarthritis using various criteria for diagnosis.104–107 The four RCT’s had similar study

 populations, primarily white and female, with mean ages ranging from 65 to 79. Mean BMI 
was also similar across studied ranging from 27.8 to 30.
In Hartman et al.,105 participants randomized to a Yang style tai chi group had significant 
improvement in the Arthritis Self-Efficacy scale versus those in the Routine Care group. The 
remaining trials compared tai chi to attention controls.104, 106, 107 All found that Tai Chi 
(either Yang style or Sun Style) did better than the attention control group on both primary 
and secondary outcomes. Across trials the most common adverse event associated with Tai 
Chi was minor muscle soreness that resolved after a few days.
Yoga
Park et al.108 completed a quasi-experimental trial, with participants randomized to either 
sitting yoga or Reiki; however the attention control group was chosen as a convenience 
sample from other participants meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The primary 
outcome measures were the WOMAC Arthritis Index score and the pain, function, and 
stiffness subscales. The mean age of participants was 80, with 68.7% being male. 
Individuals randomized to yoga, had substantially better reduction in the WOMAC function 
then either the Reiki group or the attention control group (p<0.02). No other differences 
were seen between the three groups. No adverse advents were reported for any of the groups 
in this study.
Additional information on all osteoarthritis RCT’s can be found in Supplemental Table 4.
SEVERE HEADACHE AND MIGRAINE
The majority of studies we reviewed defined cervicogenic headache, migraine, and tension-
type headache with the International Classification of Headache Disorders second 
edition.109, 110
Acupuncture
Coeytaux et al.111 randomized patients with chronic daily headache to management by a 
neurologist with or without acupuncture. The acupuncture group had significantly reduced 
headache impact test scores versus the control, but there were no significant differences on 
pain severity.
Massage
One small study that compared myofascial trigger point massage, a sham device, and 
waitlist; found massage reduced headache frequency but did not significantly reduce 
intensity or duration of headaches.112
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
One study randomized adolescents with migraine to omega-3 or placebo in a cross-over 
study.113 Adolescents experienced a reduction in headache frequency when taking either fish 
oil or placebo, but there was no significant difference between the treatments. Another study 
randomized patients with chronic headaches to increased omega-3 and lower omega-6 fatty

 acids in the diet or to lower omega-6 fatty acids in the diet.114 The participants on high 
omega-3 and low omega-6 diet had greater improvement on the Headache Impact Test and 
number of headache days.
Relaxation techniques
Six trials we reviewed evaluated stress management, relaxation, or biofeedback for headache 
disorders.115–120 Slavin-Spennyt et al.120 randomized students with chronic headache to 
expression training, relaxation training, or waitlist. Both active treatments showed significant 
decreases in headache frequency versus the waitlist control, but did not differ among 
themselves. Two trials examined complementary approaches to either tension headaches or 
migraine.116, 117 D’Souza et al. (2008)117 randomized students to relaxation training, written 
emotional disclosure, or neutral writing. The relaxation group had greater reductions in 
headache frequency and the associated headache disability compared to the other two 
groups. Devineni et al.116 randomized participants to an internet behavioral intervention or a 
waitlist. The behavioral intervention demonstrated improvement in the headache index 
versus waitlist. A trial randomized children with migraine to hand warming biofeedback 
with stress management, hand cooling biofeedback (attention control), or waitlist.119 The 
warming biofeedback group had improved headache index scores compared to the other 
groups. Holroyd et al.118 randomized participants with chronic tension headache to tricyclic 
antidepressant, placebo, stress management, or stress management plus tricyclic 
antidepressant. Both the medication and stress management groups had improvements over 
placebo, but the combination produced the best outcomes. Blanchard et al.115 randomized 
patients with headache to biofeedback with relaxation training, biofeedback plus cognitive 
therapy, sham meditation, or a headache monitoring control condition. All of the treatment 
groups including the “sham” meditation group had improvements in the headache index in 
comparison to the monitoring control group.
Spinal and Osteopathic Manipulation
One trial randomized patients with chronic cervicogenic headache to two doses of spinal 
manipulation or light massage;121 based on the literature, the light massage should have 
little, if any, specific effects and was therefore chosen as a control for time and physical 
contract with the patient. Haas and colleagues found improvement over all time points 
favoring spinal manipulation compared to light massage and a dose effect with the spinal 
manipulation. Two RCT’s were identified that assessed manipulation in individuals with 
tension headache.122, 123 The first trial randomized patients with chronic tension type 
headache to spinal manipulation or amitriptyline medication and found no differences 
between the groups;122 however the trial did not appear powered to detect non-inferiority. 
The second study was a small trial that randomized patients to osteopathic manipulation, a 
palpation examination, or no treatment.123 Authors noted an improvement in headache 
severity for the spinal manipulation group; however no statistical comparisons were made 
between groups. Nelson and colleagues study randomized patients with migraine to 
amitriptyline, spinal manipulation, or both treatments.124 The study found no significant 
differences between the groups; however it did not appear that the trial was powered to 
detect non-inferiority (see Supplemental Table 5).

OVERALL SUMMARY OF RCT DATA
Tables 3 (Efficacy), and 4 (Effectiveness) provide concise summaries of the reviewed 
clinical trial data for each complementary approach across painful health conditions. In these 
tables, positive trials are those in which the complementary approach provided statistically 
significant improvements in pain severity or pain-related disability or function compared to 
the control group. Negative trials are those in which no difference was seen between groups. 
Based on a preponderance of positive trials versus negative trials, current evidence suggests 
that the following complementary approaches may help some patients manage their painful 
health conditions:
Acupuncture and Yoga for back pain;
Acupuncture and Tai Chi for osteoarthritis of the knee;
Massage therapy for neck pain with adequate doses and for short term benefit; 
and
Relaxation techniques for severe headaches and migraine.
Weaker evidence suggests that Massage therapy, Spinal Manipulation and Osteopathic 
Manipulation might also be of some benefit to those with Back Pain, while Relaxation 
approaches and Tai Chi might help those with Fibromyalgia.
SAFETY
Generally the reporting of safety data in the reviewed RCTs was minimal. For those trials 
that did report safety data, we have summarized this information in the text for each painful 
health condition. In no case did an RCT identify a serious adverse event associated with any 
of the complementary approaches examined. The most common adverse events 
(gastrointestinal distress) were noted in trials of dietary supplements (glucosamine, 
chondroitin, MSM, SAMe). In some trials, tai chi and yoga were associated with minor 
muscle or joint soreness, and acupuncture was associated with minor pain and/or bruising at 
the needling site.
Comparisons to recent systematic reviews
Our search criteria identified a number of recent (2010 or later) systematic reviews that 
covered our topics of interest.125–133 Conclusions from these systematic reviews for 
practitioner approaches (acupuncture, chiropractic, massage therapy)125–131 and dietary 
supplements132 were generally consistent with our findings. For instance, in a 
comprehensive reviews of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to 
manage back pain, Chou et al. (20016)125 found that acupuncture and yoga appear to be 
effective for improving pain and/or function in back pain. A Cochrane systematic review 
concluded that acupuncture was a viable treatment option for osteoarthritis of the knee.127 
Also concurring with the present analysis, the meta-analysis by Deare et al.126 concluded 
that acupuncture was not an effective therapy for pain or function in individuals with

 Fibromyalgia. In their systematic review, Posadzki and Ernst 128 found little data supporting 
the use of spinal manipulation for headaches. Supporting our conclusions is a recent 
comprehensive meta-analysis of trials studying glucosamine for osteoarthritis,132 which 
found considerable variability in results across trials and concluded that neither glucosamine 
sulfate or HCl provide pain relief. The RCT’s examined in two systematic reviews of yoga 
for arthritis129,130 overlapped considerably with RCTs in the present review. The authors of 
the systematic reviews concluded that yoga appears to be a viable option for relieving pain 
and discomfort associated with arthritis, but that larger, better designed trials were needed. A 
recent systematic review131 that included international trials found that “clinically relevant 
effects of OMT were found for reducing pain and improving functional status” for those 
with back pain. Although this is a stronger conclusion than we reached, the authors’ 
identified deficiencies in trial methodology and called for larger, better quality RCT’s to 
provide firm conclusions. Not all recent systematic reviews agreed with our conclusions. A 
recent Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis133 concluded that spinal manipulation was no 
more effective than “inert” interventions for managing back pain and related disability. 
However this review only included RCT’s published through 2009. We reviewed eight RCTs 
published since then. Of these, two were negative trials32,27 and six were positive 
trials.36,41–43,46,54 Inclusion of these trials into the meta-analysis might have lead 
Rubenstein et al.133 to draw a different conclusion.
Caveats
A number of methodological issues temper our conclusions: 1) The trial samples tend to be 
white, female and older, with very few, if any minority group participants; as such the 
generalizability of the findings to the breath of patients seen by primary care providers in the 
U.S. is still unresolved; 2) Often the trials reviewed were small, with fewer than 100 total 
participants. Small trials are prone to more variability and to false-negative results. 3) In 
many of the trials where the statistical superiority of a given complementary health approach 
was demonstrated, it was not clear if the differences versus the control group were clinically 
relevant; 4) For the given painful health condition, a wide number of outcome measures 
were often used to asses pain and function; this plethora of outcomes may partly explain the 
conflicting results seen across trials; 5) For most complementary approaches there are no 
standard treatment protocols or algorithms, or in the case of dietary supplements, no 
rigorously established dosages and products; as such, trials of a given complementary 
approach rarely compare the exact same intervention; and 6) Our findings that relatively few 
mild adverse events and no serious adverse events were associated with complementary 
approaches is consistent the findings from a number of systematic reviews.125–133 However, 
even large clinical trials are not powered to identify infrequent adverse events; therefore, it is 
likely that this review is underestimating the entire range of events associated with the 
complementary approaches examined. Finally, our review was intended to be an overview of 
data from RCTs performed in the US. The inclusion of RCTs performed outside the US may 
have resulted in a different set of recommendations.
