Abstract
Background: long working hours and short sleep duration are associated with a range of adverse health consequences.
However, the combined effect of these two exposures on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been investigated.
Methods: we studied white men born between 1919 and 1934 in the Helsinki Businessmen Study (HBS, initial n = 3,490). Data
on clinical variables, self-rated health (SRH), working hours and sleep duration in 1974, and RAND-36 (SF-36) HRQoL survey
in the year 2000 were available for 1,527 men. Follow-up time was 26 years. By combining working hours and sleep duration,
four categories were formed: (i) normal work (≤50 hours/week) and normal sleep (>47 hours/week); (ii) long work (>50 hours/
week) and normal sleep; (iii) normal work and short sleep (≤47 hours/week); and (iv) long work and short sleep. The association
with RAND-36 domains was examined using multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, smoking and SRH.
Results: compared to those with normal work and sleep in midlife, men with long work and short sleep had poorer
RAND-36 scores for physical functioning, vitality and general health, and those with long work and normal sleep had
poorer scores for physical functioning in old age. Adjustment for midlife smoking and SRH attenuated the associations, but
the one for long work and short sleep and physical functioning remained significant (difference in mean physical functioning
score −4.58, 95% confidence interval −9.00 to −0.15).
Conclusion: businessmen who had long working hours coupled with short sleep duration in midlife had poorer physical
health in old age.
Keywords: working hours, sleep duration, health-related quality of life, disability, ageing, older people
Introduction
A number of studies have shown that longer working hours
are associated with a range of adverse health consequences
such as higher prevalence of stroke [1], coronary heart dis-
ease [2], metabolic disorders [3] and mental disorders [4].
Shorter as well as longer sleep durations have also been
shown to increase the prevalence of several chronic ill-
nesses, poorer self-rated health (SRH) and lower quality of
life [5–8]. Although some evidence exists that longer work-
ing hours and shorter sleep duration are related to
premature mortality [8, 9], less is known about the relation
between working hours and sleep duration and other rele-
vant outcomes in older age such as functioning and quality
of life. Furthermore, although working hours and sleep dur-
ation are related to each other, insufficient recovery due to
sleep deprivation is more common in individuals who have
longer working hours [10]; the combined association
between these two has not been extensively investigated.
Long working hours coupled with sleep deprivation might
serve as a proxy to higher job strain [10], which, in turn, is
associated with disability and premature mortality in older

 age [11, 12]. Using data from a cohort of Finnish business-
men (the Helsinki Businessmen Study, HBS), we investi-
gated whether work and sleep hours in midlife are
associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in
old age and if smoking and SRH would explain the poten-
tial associations. This knowledge is useful since managers,
entrepreneurs and executives as well as also the general
workforce are continuously faced with long working hours
[13], coupled with high pressures in terms of performance
and extensive personnel responsibilities.
Materials and methods
The HBS cohort has been described in detail earlier [14].
Briefly, the present study population consisted of white
men born between 1919 and 1934 who belonged to the
highest social class with similar socioeconomic and working
status. Of the original study cohort, 2,748 of 3,490 mem-
bers had data available on work hours and sleep duration in
1974, and of these 1,527 men completed the validated
Finnish version of the RAND-36-Item Health Survey 1.0
(similar to the SF-36 Health Survey) [15] questionnaire in
the year 2000. The follow-up studies of the HBS have been
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of
Medicine, Helsinki University Hospital, Finland.
In 1974, the cohort members were asked how many
hours per week they had worked on average during the pre-
vious year regardless of where the work was done. Working
hours were coded into normal work (≤50 hours/week, three
highest quartiles) and long work (>50 hours/week, bottom
quartile). The participants were asked how many hours per
week they had slept on average during the previous year
including weekends. Sleep duration was coded into normal
sleep (>47 hours/week, three lowest quartiles) and short
sleep (≤47 hours/week, highest quartile). The cohort mem-
bers were asked in 1974 about current smoking status (yes
versus no) and baseline SRH (answering alternatives were
very good, fairly good, average, fairly poor and very poor of
which the two latter ones were coded into one cat-
egory ‘poor’ due to few cases in the very poor category) [16].
The RAND-36 survey [15], used for assessing HRQoL,
comprises eight domains: physical functioning (10 items), role
limitations caused by physical health problems (4 items), role lim-
itations caused by emotional problems (3 items), vitality (4 items),
mental health (5 items), social functioning (2 items), bodily
pain (2 items) and general health (5 items). Scores range from
0 to 100, with 100 representing the best level of functioning
or well-being. A difference of 3–5 points in the RAND-36
domains is considered to be clinically important [17].
Using generalised linear regression models, we investi-
gated the associations between working hours and sleep dur-
ation in midlife and HRQoL in old age. First, we tested the
interaction term for working hours*sleep duration in midlife
on RAND-36 domains in old age and some of the terms
were statistically significant (all P > 0.043). Four categories of
the combined variable of working hours and sleep duration
were formed: (i) normal work and sleep (n = 942); (ii) long
work and normal sleep (n = 247); (iii) normal work and short
sleep (n = 233); and (iv) long work and short sleep
(n = 105). Adjustment was first made for age and then add-
itionally for baseline smoking status and SRH. Modelling was
performed with IBM SPSS version 22.0.
Results
The mean age at baseline was 47.2 (SD 4.0) years in 1974
and 73.2 (SD 4.0) years in 2000. The men who did not have
the necessary data available both in 1974 and 2000 were old-
er and they had poorer SRH (all P < 0.001) at baseline, but
there were no statistically significant differences in the
amount of working hours or sleep duration in 1974. The

 domains according to the binary working hours and sleep
duration variables are presented in Figure 1. In the age-
adjusted analysis, the men with long compared to those with
normal work had significantly poorer scores for
physical
functioning and general health in old age (P = 0.007
and 0.024, respectively), and those with short sleep com-
pared to those with normal sleep had a trend for poorer
scores for mental health (P = 0.054).
Age-adjusted analyses on the combined categories of
working hours and sleep duration are presented in Table 1.
Although the effect sizes were small, compared to men
with normal work and sleep in midlife, those with long
work and short sleep had the poorest scores of physical
functioning, vitality and general health, and those with long
work and normal sleep reported poor physical functioning
in old age. After further adjustment for baseline smoking
and SRH, only the association for long work and short
sleep and physical functioning remained statistically signifi-
cant (difference in mean physical functioning score −4.58,
95% confidence interval −9.00 to −0.15, P < 0.043),
whereas the others were attenuated.
Discussion
In this homogeneous cohort of older businessmen and execu-
tives, long working hours coupled with short sleep duration in
midlife was associated with poorer physical functioning in old
age during the 26-year follow-up. Allowing for age, smoking and

 SRH attenuated the association, but it remained significant sug-
gesting an independent relationship. Although the effect sizes
were small, this is the first study to investigate these associations
in midlife and old age in the highest socioeconomic strata.
Among businessmen, long working hours are likely to
co-occur with high job demands [18], which are known to
be related to adverse health outcomes and decreased phys-
ical and mental functioning in older age [19]. On the con-
trary, businessmen and executives are likely to have higher
job control, which has been shown to buffer the negative
effects of high job demands [20].
There are several potential mechanisms that might
explain the association between working hours and sleep
duration and subsequent HRQoL. Long working hours limit
the time that is left for recovery from the strain of the work
day [10]. This insufficient recovery is related to a range of
physiological changes such as elevated blood pressure and
nervous system activity that subsequently may result in phys-
ical and psychological health problems. Furthermore, long
working hours and sleep deprivation have been linked with
an unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking and excessive use of
alcohol [21], which are further linked with adverse health
outcomes. This might also be why adjustment for smoking
and SRH diluted the association between the combined mid-
life work/sleep variable and the RAND-36 domains in old
age. These adjustments did not explain the entire relation-
ship between working hours and sleep duration and subse-
quent HRQoL in old age, which indicates that there was an
independent association between the amount of work and
sleep in midlife and the HRQoL assessed decades later.
The strengths of our study include the well-characterised
sample of businessmen and executives who came from a
homogenous background, and which has been followed up
across several decades. HRQoL was assessed using the vali-
dated RAND-36 questionnaire [15]. Some limitations of the
study should be recognised. The cohort was composed of
men only. We did not have other measures of the work (e.g.
job demand or control) available; also we used a self-reported
measure of sleep and details of the quality of sleep are lacking.
Furthermore, we had information on working hours and sleep
duration from only one data collection point. However, the
cohort members were asked to recall the previous year, and
not only the previous few weeks. We categorised working
hours and sleep duration according to quartiles rather than
using standard cut-points. This was done because our study
population did not represent the general labour force [18] and
because of the timing of data collection. Employee working
hours are regulated by the Working Hour Act [22]; however,
this Act does not apply to higher management. Additionally,
we tested the quadratic terms for working hours and sleep
duration and later HRQoL, but they were non-significant.
This was done because there have been findings of u-shaped
associations particularly between sleep duration and health
outcomes [8]. Finally, as in all studies where individuals are
followed up for a long time, cohort effects may limit the gen-
eralizability of the results to the present time. We studied
businessmen; however, nowadays many employees are also
subjected to long working hours and several administrative
obligations and thus the present findings are likely to apply
to a larger segment of the workforce than only businessmen.
In conclusion, we found that longer working hours
coupled with shorter sleep duration in midlife was asso-
ciated with poorer physical functioning in old age. Lifestyle
factors such as smoking and health status did not entirely
explain this association. The study showed that the working
conditions in midlife, in this case work and sleep time, had
long-term associations with physical functioning in old age
several decades later. This finding indicates that the conse-
quences of the work are apparent also in old age and
should be therefore tackled in midlife or earlier in order to
promote better health-related quality of life in older age.
Key points
• In older businessmen, long working hours and short sleep
duration in midlife were linked with old age poor physical
functioning.
• Allowing for age, smoking and SRH attenuated the associ-
ation, but it remained significant.
• Useful knowledge since managers, entrepreneurs and
executives as well as the general workforce are continu-
ously faced with long working hours.
