Immunization strategies against commensal bacterial pathogens
have long focused on eradicating asymptomatic carriage as well as
disease, resulting in changes in the colonizing microflora with
unknown future consequences. Additionally, current vaccines are
not easily adaptable to sequence diversity and immune evasion.
Here, we present a “smart” vaccine that leverages our current un-
derstanding of disease transition from bacterial carriage to infec-
tion with the pneumococcus serving as a model organism. Using
conserved surface proteins highly expressed during virulent tran-
sition, the vaccine mounts an immune response specifically against
disease-causing bacterial populations without affecting carriage.
Aided by a delivery technology capable of multivalent surface
display, which can be adapted easily to a changing clinical picture,
results include complete protection against the development of
pneumonia and sepsis during animal challenge experiments with
multiple, highly variable, and clinically relevant pneumococcal iso-
lates. The approach thus offers a unique and dynamic treatment
option readily adaptable to other commensal pathogens.

H
uman–microbe interactions serve numerous symbiotic pur-
poses. However, certain colonizing microorganisms have the
capacity to become virulent and trigger disease. The two most
common antimicrobial therapies, antibiotics and vaccines, must
be reconsidered in this context because of the numerous pitfalls
associated with traditional metrics of “success.”
Specifically, we suggest that treatment must be directed at a
disease-progression state of a microbial population and not at the
population more generally. Doing so offers the potential to opti-
mize treatment and reduce unintended pathological consequences.
In this paper, we present such an approach in the context of
pneumococcal disease, culminating in a “smart” vaccine that directs
an immune response to virulent cell populations while minimizing
the disruption of avirulent commensal colonization.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a regarded
as a major human pathogen and is the most common cause of
community-acquired pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, bacteremia,
and otitis media (1). In addition, S. pneumoniae has been impli-
cated as an important cause of sinusitis, septic arthritis, osteo-
myelitis, peritonitis, and endocarditis (1). Regardless of clinical
manifestation, infection is always preceded by colonization of the
nasopharynx, and >95% of children are colonized within the first
few weeks or months of life by serotypes that are replaced se-
quentially as more serotypes are acquired (2–4). Interestingly,
pneumococcal colonization is asymptomatic, and it is only upon
external triggering (e.g., viral infection) that virulent S. pneumo-
niae subpopulations disseminate and cause disease (Fig. 1A) (5).
The illnesses caused by this transition from carriage to disease
result in a mortality rate of ∼15–20% in adults with an even higher
rate in elderly patients (2–4). Pediatric cases include >20 million
yearly occurrences, primarily middle ear infections, in the United
States and account for the majority of emergency room admissions
and associated antibiotic prescriptions, accruing billions of dollars
in annual socioeconomic costs (6, 7). Invasive disease has a more
devastating impact in resource-limited countries, with an estimated
1 million children (11% of all deaths below age 5 y) succumbing to
pneumococcal infection annually (8–11).
As introduced above, effectively treating pneumococcal disease is
difficult because of the multiple populations of S. pneumoniae with
different characteristics, including cells localized to a colonizing
biofilm and cells triggered for dissemination and disease. Antibiotic
treatment options have become limited by the emergence of anti-
biotic resistance. Notably, before the 1990s, most S. pneumoniae
strains demonstrated universal sensitivity to penicillin (12). Today,
however, penicillin resistance varies from 5–60% in various parts of
the world (13, 14). Of particular concern is the increase in multidrug-
resistant S. pneumoniae strains demonstrating resistance to three or
more drug classes (15–18), which creates substantial concerns about
both the efficacy of current antibiotic regimens and the continual
development of resistance. In addition, the formation of S. pneu-
moniae biofilm during colonization provides a barrier to effective
antibiotic activity (19–23), thus limiting complete bacterial clearance
and promoting the development of resistance (24, 25). Finally, and
more importantly, even in the event of successful bacterial clearance
with antibiotic treatment, there is a risk for recolonization by po-
tentially more dangerous serotypes or alternative pathogens (e.g.,
Staphylococcus aureus), which are equally adept at biofilm forma-
tion and have effective mechanical tolerance of and high biological
resistance to antibiotics (26–28).
Alternatively, two pneumococcal vaccine compositions are cur-
rently on the market in the United States: the Prevnar family
(Pfizer) and Pneumovax (Merck). Prevnar vaccines contain cap-
sular polysaccharides conjugated to the diphtheria CRM197
protein. The most recent composition is Prevnar 13, which is
designed to encompass 13 of the most common invasive sero-
types of S. pneumoniae and provides protection against 74–88%
Significance
Pneumococcal disease represents a global health problem, espe-
cially for the young, the elderly, and the resource-limited. Disease
progression begins with asymptomatic nasopharyngeal bacterial
colonization before subsequent dissemination and disease (pneu-
monia, sepsis, and middle ear infection). Analysis of this transition
from colonization to disease provided antigens that were tested in
this study for directed vaccination against only the virulent subset
of pneumococci. In so doing, a “smart” vaccine was sought that
would address this disease broadly, effectively, and selectively.

 of invasive pneumococcal disease cases (29, 30). Pneumovax is a
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, introduced in 1977, that since
1983 has provided protection against 23 serotypes of S. pneumoniae
(PPSV23) with 56–75% efficacy overall (29, 30). However, current
vaccination strategies have met with incomplete success because
of (i) an inability to account for and include all current and future
S. pneumoniae serotypes capable of establishing nasopharyngeal
residence and (ii), analogous to antibiotic treatment, the displace-
ment of the asymptomatic vaccine-type S. pneumoniae biofilms with
nonvaccine serotypes and by organisms (such as methicillin-resistant
S. aureus or Haemophilus influenzae) capable of equal or greater
pathologies (Fig. 1B) (31–33).
Recognizing the need to develop a new generation of pneu-
mococcal vaccines, we present a strategy to direct protection against
virulent biofilm-released S. pneumoniae while retaining their stable
nasopharyngeal commensalism (Fig. 1C). Specifically, vaccine can-
didates (i.e., antigens) were discovered by building on the funda-
mental insight that S. pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx as a
biofilm and that disease progression occurs when external triggers
resulting from changes in the nasopharyngeal environment prompt
escape from the asymptomatic biofilm of bacteria with a changed
transcriptional profile associated with increased virulence (22, 23,
34). Although current vaccines have provided protection and ex-
panded coverage over time (Fig. 1D), clinical data suggest the
emergence of new serotypes that must be addressed in future vac-
cination efforts (Fig. 1 E–G) (35). Effectively, the propensity for
serotype replacement, within or outside current treatment options,
underscores the need to identify and use pneumococcal antigens
capable of providing broad serotype coverage in a manner that will
minimize asymptomatic biofilm disruption and the associated op-
portunities for niche replacement. One option in this regard is to
target only those pneumococci triggered for virulent biofilm escape
in response to changes in the nasopharyngeal environment (Fig. 1C).
Results and Discussion
Virulence-Associated Antigens Selected from and Screened Against
Biofilm-Released, Clinically Conditioned S. pneumoniae. Through the
combination of an in vitro biofilm model (Fig. 2A) and transcriptional
analysis of the bacterial populations comprising this model (23, 36),
antigens were identified that were significantly up-regulated in bio-
film-released pneumococci demonstrating increased virulence. In
addition to providing target antigens, the biofilm model served an-
other key purpose in this study: Namely, S. pneumoniae is a human
pathogen that, with the exception of a few strains, cannot cause in-
vasive disease in mice. Thus, the biofilm model was used to condition
a clinical isolate of S. pneumoniae (EF3030, serotype 19F) to become
lethally infectious. Specifically, EF3030 cells released from biofilms by
increased temperature (38.5 °C, mimicking fever) induced septicemia
and death in mice and thus offered a clinically relevant surrogate
model of human pneumococcal disease (Fig. 2 B–D). Broth-grown
(planktonic) EF3030 pneumococci or those mechanically isolated
from biofilms had no such virulence. As such, the biofilm model
enables clinically conditioned S. pneumoniae strains to be subse-
quently assessed in mouse protection assays, allowing a substantial
increase in the number of strains tested in this study.
Initial protection then was investigated by immunizing mice
with a range of promising antigen targets (Table S1) selected on
the basis of (i) conserved sequence homology across S. pneu-
moniae strains (thus offering broad-coverage potential) and,
critically, (ii) specific prominence in the virulent, biofilm-released
bacterial population compared with asymptomatic biofilm pneu-
mococci. Namely, antigen targets up-regulated in biofilm-released
bacteria were prepared as recombinant proteins and tested for
protection relative to the well-established S. pneumoniae surface
protein antigen (PspA), which is one of the best-studied protein
protective vaccine candidates and also is up-regulated during vir-
ulence transition (Fig. 2E) (36–38). Under these conditions, all
antigens except DexB showed protection comparable to PspA,
with two antigens, GlpO (an α-glycerophosphate oxidase) and
PncO (a bacteriocin ABC transporter transmembrane protein),
demonstrating promising individual protection surpassing that of
PspA. Complete protection and effective bacterial reduction were
conferred upon immunization with both antigens (Fig. 2 F and G);
thus, remaining analyses were conducted using these two antigens
in combination.

S. pneumoniae pathogenesis outcomes and
infectious disease statistics in the United States
(1998–2013). (A) S. pneumoniae colonizes the human
nasopharynx and produces a bacterial biofilm with
an accompanying extracellular matrix capable of
providing protection from external and host chal-
lenges. External triggers such as viral infection
prompt the active release of virulent pneumococci
that disseminate to secondary sites and cause disease.
(B) Leading vaccination strategies [polysaccharide
conjugate vaccines (PCVs), such as the Prevnar family]
mediate protection against certain bacterial serotypes
by promoting clearance of pneumococci before

niche to colonization by nonvaccine serotypes or
other bacterial species. (C) The strategy featured in
this work mediates clearance of only virulent biofilm-
released bacteria while maintaining the presence of
the preexisting biofilm. (D) The annual infection rate

 Antigen Delivery Using Co-PoP Liposomal Surface Display. The code-
livery of GlpO and PncO, both recombinantly produced with 6×
histidine tags, was facilitated using a cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid
(Co-PoP) liposomal carrier capable of surface-orienting and de-
livering multiple his-tagged peptide-based antigens (Fig. S1) (39).
The liposomal device thus offers a unique vaccine formulation
based on a simple and stable antigen–carrier complex without the
need for advanced chemical conjugation. Furthermore, the tech-
nology is well aligned with the antigen discovery and production
techniques offered by the aforementioned biofilm model and well-
established recombinant protein production. Therefore, we adopted
the technology here in the delivery of GlpO and PncO. Looking
forward, the Co-PoP delivery platform offers even more potential
in the way of unprecedented valency of discovered antigens via the
surface localization and presentation of hundreds of additional
protein or peptide products.
Directed Response and Extended Coverage Provided by Combined
Virulent Antigens. The directed nature of the antigens was tested
in a series of experiments presented in Fig. 3A. Across different
anatomical locations representative of bacterial colonization (na-
sopharynx) and displacement (nasopharynx lavage), disseminating
pneumonia (lung), and invasive septicemia (blood), vaccinated
and nonvaccinated mice were challenged with planktonic and
in vitro biofilm-released S. pneumoniae, and bacterial clearance
was monitored over time. In the absence of an external stimulus
(e.g., viral infection), mice will remain colonized with planktonic
D39 or EF3030 for 1–3 wk without infection of the lower respiratory
tract or the development of bacteremia. Biofilm-released bacteria
demonstrate a colonization pattern similar to that of planktonic
bacteria but also have the propensity to disseminate into second-
ary anatomical sites and cause disease. Thus, planktonic EF3030
and D39 cells provided a clearance baseline to compare bacterial
loads using biofilm-released pneumococci challenge. Clearance of
biofilm-released bacteria was mediated only in vaccinated mice; the
bacterial load was increased significantly and was lethal in non-
vaccinated mice. Interestingly, the rate of clearance of planktonic
bacteria was unchanged despite vaccination. A comparison of
bacterial burden across the planktonic and biofilm-released
EF3030 clinical isolate is provided in Fig. 3B, emphasizing a
directed vaccination strategy using GlpO and PncO.
However, the potential of S. pneumoniae for antigenic drift
emphasizes the need for any new antigens to be general and ef-
fective across a wide range of challenge strains (Tables S2 and S3).
To this end, the antigens were tested in mice infected with a range
of S. pneumoniae strains chosen for the notable difficulty of pro-
tecting against these strains and for the variability in serotype and
genetic background among the strains. Complete protection was
provided for a panel of strains across both sepsis and pneumonia
challenge models (Fig. 3 B and C and Figs. S2 and S3). Ten addi-
tional strains were tested in protection experiments, in which the
average time to death in treated mice ranged from 12–21 d as op-
posed to <3 d for controls (Fig. S4). Importantly, like EF3030,
several of the S. pneumoniae strains tested required virulent
conditioning using the in vitro biofilm model, thus emphasizing the
importance of this tool in both antigen discovery and broad challenge

 assessment. These challenge assays included strains of serotype 12,
15B, and 27 that are not covered by current vaccines and suggest that
(i) this vaccine composition can offer protection against strains cur-
rently circulating and causing disease in the population and (ii) the
methodology of in vitro biofilm release can be used to produce ad-
ditional mouse-virulent bacterial populations (beyond those tested
here) for future vaccine protection screening. The combined results
emphasize a degree of coverage not previously reported when using
a protein-based antigen with the added potential to identify and
test new antigens continually in response to disease variation
over time. Finally, broad protection is supported by a sequence-
conservation analysis of the new antigens across S. pneumoniae
serotypes (Table S4). The results therefore support the potential
for widespread protection and resistance to antigenic drift.
Extension to an in Vivo Model of Virulence Progression. In a final set
of experiments presented in Fig. 4, we explored protection in an
in vivo model that mimics the clinical progression of pneumo-
coccal disease onset. Epidemiological evidence suggests that
pneumococcal disease is strongly associated with a concomitant
infection with upper respiratory tract viruses, such as influenza A
virus (IAV) (40, 41). Mice were infected intranasally with IAV
48 h after colonization with S. pneumoniae, a protocol designed to
mediate the release of virulent pneumococci from colonizing
biofilms for subsequent dissemination to the lungs and blood.
Mice vaccinated with GlpO and PncO displayed a limited spread
of D39 and EF3030 S. pneumoniae strains in this clinically relevant
model, with the reduced onset of dissemination of virulent or-
ganisms indicated on day 1 post viral infection and significantly
pronounced reduction in the lung and the blood on day 5 (Fig. 4 A
and B). Of major importance, the nasopharyngeal burden in im-
munized and nonimmunized animals remained unchanged,
suggesting that harmless and potentially beneficial commen-
sal colonization was unaffected. This result further supports a

 paradigm shift in protection against accidental pathogens or those
commensals that colonize asymptomatically but have the capacity
to cause disease in response to inflammation or other external
triggers.
When using this same in vivo model of IAV-induced pneu-
mococcal disease, full protection against septicemia and death
was provided by the combination of GlpO and PncO using tra-
ditional immunization, whereas partial protection was accom-
plished via adoptive/passive vaccination strategies (Fig. 4 C and D
and Fig. S4). The latter result indicates an important role of the
humoral immune system arm in the mechanism driving the results
obtained throughout this study and suggests that an additional
T-cell response also contributes. Interestingly, these observations
are in line with the recognition that priming of TH17 cells is an
important factor mediating the clearance of pathogens at mucosal
surfaces (42). However, a more mechanistic analysis of individual
and combined antigens is required to characterize better the im-
munological underpinnings of the results presented. We also
recognize the potential for immune response cross-talk, in that
analogous antigens might be targeted in other commensal or-
ganisms. For the primary antigens tested in this study, GlpO is
present in other streptococcal species as well as in enterococci,
lactococci, and lactobacilli. However, PncO appears to be re-
stricted to pneumococci, based upon homology analysis. Similar to
the pneumococci emphasis of this study, we would expect that
cross-reactivity with other members of the host microbial flora
would be restricted to those populations that have up-regulated
versions of the antigens tested here. However, a more complete
analysis of microbial content postvaccination would be required to
elucidate the impact on global microflora variation. This analysis
would be a fruitful and interesting topic of future research.
Conclusions
In summary, the availability of tools derived from a better un-
derstanding of the mechanisms involved in pneumococcal biofilm
establishment and transition to disease and of effective delivery
technology has enabled a directed and potent strategy to induce
an antibody-mediated immune response against a disease-causing
subset of a commensal microbial population. Specifically, antigens
associated with biofilm-released, virulent pneumococci have
demonstrated unequivocal protection against challenge and re-
duction in the bacterial burden of a range of clinically relevant
S. pneumoniae strains under varying disease conditions. The re-
sults offer a response to a globally relevant disease and to growing
concerns associated with current treatment options, including risks
posed by emerging serotype- and niche-replacement pathogens.
Importantly, the tools enabling the results of this work can be
applied to identify new antigens continually and simultaneously to
address the diversity and antigenic drift potential of S. pneumoniae
and other pathogens that exhibit similar virulence progression.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
of the National Institutes of Health (43). The protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University at Buffalo,
The State University of New York. All bacterial inoculations and treatments
were performed under conditions designed to minimize any potential suf-
fering of the animals.
Vaccine Formulation and Immunization. Antigen Co-PoP liposomal carrier vectors
were generated as described previously (39). Each injection dose contained
25 μg of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) in liposomes comprising 1,2-dioleoyl-
sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:cholesterol:MPLA:Co-PoP at a molar ratio of
50:30:5:5. After liposomes were dissolved in chloroform in a test tube, the
solvent was evaporated, and the film was further dried under vacuum over-
night. Liposomes then were rehydrated with PBS and sonicated. The binding
ability of recombinant antigens was evaluated by incubating 25 μg of protein
with 20 μg of liposomes in 200 μL PBS within a well of a 96-well plate. Fluo-
rescence in the FRET channel (excitation: 430 nm, emission: 525 nm) was
measured periodically with a fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan Infinite II).
Data were normalized to the FRET signal for protein without addition of li-
posomes. Once binding was confirmed, antigens were incubated at 4 °C with
Co-PoP liposomes overnight before animal injections. Dynamic light scattering
was used to evaluate the particle diameter and zeta potential of liposomes
containing three concentrations of PspA (0, 5, and 15 μg).
Outbred 6-wk-old female CD-1 mice (Harlan Laboratories) were used in
immunization experiments. Mice were immunized by s.c. injection (200 μL). All
samples contained PBS as the background solution, and final antigen (Table
S1) doses ranged from 5–15 μg. The sham vaccination control was the Co-PoP
delivery device in PBS. When combined, PncO and GlpO (Table S4) were ad-
ministered at 15 μg each. After 14 d, mice were boosted with the same for-
mulations. At day 14 and day 28, serum samples were collected from the mice
by retro-orbital bleeding. For passive immunizations, respective sera were di-
luted 10 times and administered via i.p. injection (200 μL).
Bacterial Preparation and Biofilm Release. The bacterial strains used in this
study are listed in Tables S2 and S3 and were initially grown on Todd–
Hewitt agar plates supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract and 5% (vol/vol)
sheep blood and were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Single colonies were
used to inoculate 5 mL of Todd–Hewitt broth containing 0.5% yeast ex-
tract and were incubated at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6. At this point, mouse-
passaged strains of S. pneumoniae (which display a virulent phenotype)
were used for challenge studies after one washing with and resuspension
in PBS (Fig. S5).
Other S. pneumoniae strains are clinical isolates that do not demonstrate
a virulent phenotype in mice unless conditioned using an in vitro biofilm
release model. Specifically, NCI-H292 epithelial cells were cultured in RPMI-
1640 medium in T75 flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After reaching 100% con-
fluency, H292 cells were prefixed in 4% (wt/vol) buffered paraformaldehyde at
34 °C for 48 h followed by three washes with PBS. Pneumococci grown in

 chemically defined bacterial growth medium (CDM) (JRH Biosciences) then
were seeded onto fixed H292 cells, and the medium was changed every 12 h.
Formed biofilms were exposed to heat (38.5 °C) for 4 h, and released cells were
collected by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in PBS, and quantified
by OD600 measurement. Biofilm-associated cells were disrupted by gentle
pipetting, collected by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in PBS, and
quantified by OD600 measurement.
Challenge Models. To induce sepsis or pneumonia, mice were administered i.p.
or intranasally (with isoflurane), respectively, with 1 × 104 to 1 × 106 cfu of
pneumococci strains (Tables S2 and S3). To induce colonization, mice were
administered 1 × 106 cfu bacteria intranasally without isoflurane. To mimic
influenza-induced pneumonia, pneumococci colonization (with biofilm-
grown EF3030 or D39) was followed 48 h later by intranasal inoculation with
40 pfu of IAV in 50 μL of PBS. Mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (ATCC VR-95)
was used, and viral titers were determined by plaque assays. Mice were
monitored every 4 h for signs of morbidity (huddling, ruffled fur, lethargy,
and abdominal surface temperature). Mice found to be moribund were
killed via CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation. When IAV addition was
replaced with background PBS inoculation, mice remained colonized by
S. pneumoniae strains D39 and EF3030 for 1–3 wk without lethargy, hud-
dling, and ruffled fur (as observed with viral inoculation), infection of the
lower respiratory tract, or the development of bacteremia.
All remaining experimental details are described in SI Materials
and Methods.
