APOE e4 and the associations of seafood
and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids with
cognitive decline
ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine the association between consumption of seafood and long-chain n-3 fatty
acids with change in 5 cognitive domains over an average of 4.9 years.
Methods: From an ongoing longitudinal, community-based epidemiologic study of aging and
dementia (the Rush Memory and Aging Project), we included 915 participants (age 81.4 6
7.2 years, 25% men) who had completed at least one follow-up cognitive assessment and
dietary data. Diet was assessed by semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Scores
for global cognitive function and 5 cognitive domains (episodic, semantic, and working memory,
perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability) were assessed using 19 cognitive tests. Mixed
models adjusted for multiple risk factors of cognitive change were used to assess the
associations.
Results: Consumption of seafood was associated with slower decline in semantic memory (b 5
0.024; p 5 0.03) and perceptual speed (b 5 0.020; p 5 0.05) in separate models adjusted for
age, sex, education, participation in cognitive activities, physical activity, alcohol consumption,
smoking, and total energy intake. In secondary analyses, APOE e4 carriers demonstrated slower
rates of decline in global cognition and in multiple cognitive domains with weekly seafood con-
sumption and with moderate to high long-chain n-3 fatty acid intake from food. These associa-
tions were not present in APOE e4 noncarriers. Higher intake levels of a-linolenic acid were
associated with slower global cognitive decline, but also only in APOE e4 carriers.
Conclusions: These results suggest protective relations of one meal per week of seafood and
long-chain n-3 fatty acids against decline in multiple cognitive domains. The role of APOE e4 in
this association needs further study. Neurology® 2016;86:2063–2070

The primary structural component of the brain is the long-chain n-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA) (22:6 n-3), of which the direct nutrient source is seafood. DHA is also metabolized
in vivo from the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5 n-3) and a-linolenic acid
(ALA) (18:3 n-3). The importance of seafood and n-3 fatty acids in the prevention of dementia
has been demonstrated through a number of prospective epidemiologic studies,1,2 most of which
reported findings for global cognitive functioning. Few examined associations with specific
cognitive domains that may provide clues to the underlying biologic mechanisms of effect.
Further, we are not aware of a previous study investigating whether APOE, the gene encoding
the lipid protein responsible for intercellular trafficking of cholesterol and other lipids involved
in brain composition and functioning,3 and more specifically the APOE e4 genotype, a major
risk factor for dementia,4 might modify the relations of seafood/n-3 fatty acid intake to domain-
specific cognitive decline. We investigated whether APOE e4 modifies the association between
seafood and n-3 fatty acid intakes and domain-specific cognitive decline in a community-based,
prospective study.

 METHODS Study population. Participants are from the
Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), an ongoing longitudi-
nal, community-based study of aging and dementia.5 They were
recruited from more than 40 retirement and subsidized housing
communities across northeastern Illinois, in addition to church
groups and social service agencies. Participants were free of
known dementia at enrollment into the study and agreed to
annual clinical evaluation. From February 2004 to 2013, the
MAP
study
participants
were
invited
to
complete
food
frequency questionnaires. During that period, there were 1,306
active participants, 1,068 of whom completed the dietary
questionnaire, and 960 survived and completed at least one
follow-up cognitive assessment for the analyses of change in
cognition. Of these, 915 had nonmissing data on n-3 fatty acid
dietary components.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The Institutional Review Board of Rush University
Medical Center approved this study and all participants signed
written informed consent.
Dietary assessment. Dietary intake was assessed by a semiquan-
titative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was validated for
use in a population-based study of older community residents.6
Participants were asked to report usual frequency of intake of 144
food items over the previous 12 months. Nutrient levels and total
energy for each food item were based either on natural portion
sizes (e.g., slice of bread) or according to age- and sex-specific
portion sizes from national dietary surveys. The FFQ included 4
seafood items: tunafish sandwich, fish sticks/fish cakes/fish
sandwich, fresh fish as a main dish, and shrimp/lobster/crab.
The use of fish oil supplements was also ascertained. Weekly
consumption of seafood was computed by summing the
responses to the 4 seafood items. Intakes of n-3 fatty acids were
obtained by multiplying the nutrient content of individual food
items by the frequency of consumption and summing over all
items. For these analyses, we investigated dietary intakes of the
long-chain n-3 fatty acids, EPA (20:5 n-3), DHA (22:6 n-3), and
ALA (18:3 n-3), a long-chain n-3 fatty acid that can be consumed
through plant sources. Nutrient intakes were energy-adjusted by
the regression residual method.7
Cognitive testing. A standardized battery including 21 cogni-
tive tests was administered at each annual evaluation, 19 of which
were used to measure decline in global cognition and 5 cognitive
domains: episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory,
perceptual
speed,
and
visuospatial
ability,
as
previously
described.8 For analyses, we computed composite scores of the
5 domains and of all 19 tests to measure global cognition. To
compute the composite measures, raw scores on each test were
first converted to z scores using the baseline mean and standard
deviation for the entire cohort. The z scores were then averaged
over all tests. The composite scores minimize floor and ceiling
effects of the individual tests as well as other sources of measure-
ment error. The Mini-Mental State Examination9 was also
administered for descriptive purposes.
Covariates. Model covariates were based on information current
to the baseline cognitive assessment for these analyses. Age and
education were modeled in years. Smoking behavior (never
smoked, former smoker, or current smoker) was based on a series
of questions. Alcohol consumption (grams per day) was com-
puted from 3 questions on the FFQ about usual frequency of
consumption of beer, wine, and liquor. Frequency of participa-
tion in cognitively stimulating activities was quantified with a pre-
viously established scale8 wherein people rated (5-point scale)
how often over the past year they had participated in 7
cognitive activities (reading, library visits, reading newspapers,
reading magazines, reading books, writing letters, playing
games). Hours of physical activity per week was based on
standardized
questions10,11
that
assessed
the
sum
total
of minutes spent on each of 5 activities (walking for exercise,
gardening or yard work, calisthenics or general exercise, bicycle
riding, swimming or water exercise). Presence of diabetes (self-
reported history or antidiabetic medication use), hypertension (self-
reported history, measured blood pressure $160 mm Hg systolic
or $95 mm Hg diastolic, or current use of antihypertensive
medications), heart disease (self-reported history of myocardial
infarction or digitalis use), and stroke (self-reported history
and neurologic examination) were modeled as dichotomous
variables.
APOE genotype was determined using DNA extracted from
peripheral blood lymphocytes as previously described.12 Genotyp-
ing was performed by Agencourt Bioscience Corporation (Bev-
erly, MA). Participants with one or more copies of the e4 allele
were considered e4 carriers.
Statistical analysis. We used linear mixed models to examine
the relations of seafood meals and n-3 fatty acid intake to change
in cognitive function. Both linear and nonlinear relations of the
n-3 fatty acid nutrient variables were considered by modeling
the variables in tertiles and also as linear trend variables in which
all participants in a tertile were coded at the median level and
modeled as a categorical variable. Seafood consumption was mod-
eled as an indicator variable of one or more (11) seafood meals
per week vs ,1 (the referent category) based on findings from
previous studies.13–17 Models were adjusted for age (years), sex,
education (years), frequency of participation in cognitively stim-
ulating activities, energy intake (only for seafood models), phys-
ical activity (hours of activity per week), alcohol consumption
(grams per day of beer, wine, and liquor), smoking (never/for-
mer/current), time, and time interactions with each model cova-
riate. In a second model, we added covariates for cardiovascular
risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and
stroke) that may be considered both potential mediators and
confounders of the hypothesized relations. We performed tests
for statistical interaction by adding to the basic model 2-way
multiplicative terms between the dietary variable and APOE e4
and 3-way multiplicative terms between the dietary variable,
APOE-e4, and time.
Because of significant interactions between intakes of seafood
and n-3 fatty acids and APOE e4 and time for the cognitive
outcomes in the basic-adjusted models, we subsequently ran sep-
arate models within strata of APOE e4 carriers and APOE e4
noncarriers as secondary analyses. All analyses were performed
using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and p # 0.05 was consid-
ered significant.
RESULTS The sample of 915 participants was fol-
lowed on average 4.9 6 2.5 years and had a mean
of 5.7 cognitive assessments. Mean age of the partic-
ipants at baseline was 81.4 6 7.2 years and 25.5%
were male. Compared with participants in the lowest
tertile of long-chain n-3 fatty acid intake, those in the
highest tertile were more likely to be male, APOE e4
carriers, and physically active, and somewhat less
likely to have a history of diabetes, hypertension, or
stroke. They also had higher baseline scores on some
of the cognitive domains (table 1). Participants in the

 highest tertile of ALA intake tended to have lower
alcohol consumption and to be less physically active
than participants in the lowest tertile, and were more
likely to have a history of cardiovascular conditions.
Nutrient relations in the total sample. Global cognitive
scores in the total sample declined on average by
0.083 standardized units per year (SU/y). When we
examined the decline in rates by seafood consump-
tion in models adjusted for age, sex, education, total
caloric intake, alcohol consumption, smoking, and
participation in cognitive and physical activities, those
who consumed one or more seafood meals per week
did not demonstrate slower decline in global cogni-
tion, but did have significantly slower rates of decline
in semantic memory and perceptual speed compared
with those who consumed less (table 2). These asso-
ciations did not change with additional adjustment
for cardiovascular risk factors (stroke, hypertension,
myocardial infarction, diabetes) that could potentially

 mediate the relations between seafood and decline
(data not shown). Dietary intakes of ALA (table 2)
and food sources of the long-chain n-3 fatty acids
were not associated with any measure of cognitive
decline in the overall sample. However, the group
of 161 fish oil supplement consumers had slower rates
of decline in the global cognitive measure (b 5 0.024,
p 5 0.02) and in episodic memory (b 5 0.027, p 5
0.03) compared with the nonconsumers.
Analyses by APOE e4 status. We next investigated
potential modifications in the associations of the
nutrient variables on cognitive decline by APOE e4
status. Because statistical interactions were observed
among all 3 nutrient variables and multiple cognitive
measures and time in the basic adjusted models, we
conducted secondary analyses stratified by APOE e4
status (table 3 and table e-1 on the Neurology® Web
site at Neurology.org).
Among the 178 APOE e4 carriers, the mean rate
of decline in global score was 20.126 SU/y. Weekly
seafood consumption in this group was associated
with slower declines in global cognitive score (figure),
episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceptual
speed compared with less consumption (table 3).
APOE e4 carriers also demonstrated linear protective
relations with increased intakes of long-chain n-3
fatty acids reflected as slower declines in semantic
memory and perceptual speed. However, nonlinear
associations for the long-chain n-3 fatty acids were
observed for global cognition, episodic memory,
and working memory, such that participants in the
second tertile of intakes had significantly slower de-
clines, but there were no benefits with higher intakes.
The plant-based 18:3 n-3 fatty acid, ALA, had mar-
ginally linear protective relations with global cognitive
score (p 5 0.05) and perceptual speed (p 5 0.07) in
the group of APOE e4 carriers.
In further analyses we investigated an intermediary
role of cardiovascular conditions on the observed as-
sociations among the APOE e4 carriers. The addition
of covariates for stroke, myocardial infarction, diabe-
tes, and hypertension to basic-adjusted models
reduced the protective association of seafood con-
sumption on global cognitive decline (b 5 0.047,
p 5 0.06), and that with episodic memory was
reduced and no longer remained (b 5 0.048, p 5
0.12). By contrast, the protective associations with
semantic memory (b 5 0.086, p 5 0.01) and per-
ceptual speed (b 5 0.066, p 5 0.02) remained. In
parallel analyses of the long-chain n-3 fatty acids, the
associations with cognitive decline and the second
tertile of intakes changed little and remained signifi-
cant. The exception was working memory, for which
there was a 32% diminution in the estimated effect
that was no longer significant. (b 5 0.046, p 5 0.11).
The marginal associations for ALA intake were further
weakened after the adjustments for cardiovascular

 conditions (global cognition b 5 0.089, p 5 0.10;
perceptual speed b 5 0.107, p 5 0.08).
To investigate the extent to which the findings
could be explained by dietary changes or to invalid
reporting among individuals with ongoing disease
processes, we reanalyzed the data after eliminating
those in the lowest 10% of baseline cognitive scores.
There were no appreciable changes in the estimated
effects of the second tertile of long-chain n-3 fatty
acid intake for any cognitive measure except for a mar-
ginal association for episodic memory (b 5 0.054,
p 5 0.07). For seafood consumption, only the asso-
ciation for semantic memory remained (b 5 0.049,
p 5 0.03) and the previously observed associations
for ALA no longer lasted (all p . 0.15).
In APOE e4 noncarriers, the average decline in
global cognitive score was 20.078 SU/y. There was
no evidence of association for any of the nutrient
exposures and cognitive measures. (table e-1) Further,
there was no evidence of statistical interaction
between fish oil supplement use and APOE e4 on
cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION The present study is one of a few that
investigated associations between seafood and long-
chain n-3 fatty acid intake with change in cognitive
domains. Our findings support the hypothesis that
consumption of seafood and long-chain n-3 fatty acids
reduces age-related decline in multiple cognitive
domains. The study findings suggest that the relation
may be more pronounced in individuals who have the
APOE e4 genotype.
APOE e4 is associated with increased brain neuro-
inflammation and deposition of Ab in senile plaques.18

 DHA is a major polyunsaturated fatty acid in the brain
that is obtained through diet and has potent anti-
inflammatory and antioxidative properties that have
been demonstrated in some brain animal models.19
One such study of APOE e4 and APOE e3 targeted
replacement mice found that the phenotypic deleteri-
ous effects of APOE e4 on cognition and brain neuro-
pathology were prevented by a DHA-rich diet.20
Our associations of higher dietary n-3 fatty acids
with slower cognitive decline among APOE e4 car-
riers are in accordance with a prior observational
study showing associations in APOE e4 carriers
between higher plasma EPA and DHA and slower
decline in visual working memory.21 Yet several other
observational studies reported associations of higher
fish consumption or erythrocyte levels of EPA/DHA
with dementia in noncarriers of APOE e4.22–24 How-
ever, the interaction terms in these studies were not
significant at p # 0.05, inconsistent per outcome
measure, or based on very small numbers, so the
evidence restricting the association to APOE e4 non-
carriers is not strong. The robustness of the current
associations is reinforced by our findings in a subsam-
ple of deceased participants with autopsy data, in
which we recently showed associations between higher
seafood consumption with lower levels of Alzheimer
disease neuropathology also in APOE e4 carriers
only.25 A very recent study observed associations
between fish oil supplement use and less cognitive
decline and less brain atrophy in the entire study
cohort that, after stratification, remained significant
in the APOE e4 noncarriers only.26 Results from
randomized placebo-controlled intervention trials
are also mixed, observing positive effects of long-
chain n-3 fatty acids among APOE e4 carriers27,28
or in APOE e4 noncarriers.29 One possible explana-
tion for the previous findings of association among
APOE e4 noncarriers is the larger number of partic-
ipants being APOE e4 noncarriers. Our contrasting
result with the majority of previous observational
and intervention studies may also be due to the
relatively older study sample (mean age at baseline
was 81.4 years), or could also be a chance finding.
The interaction between APOE e4 status and long-
chain n-3 fatty acid intake is not fully understood. It
has been suggested that APOE e4 carriers may have
compromised brain reserves or poor brain protection
and repair mechanisms, making them more vulner-
able to detrimental factors, but also to beneficial fac-
tors, such as long-chain n-3 fatty acid intake.30 It has
also been proposed that EPA and DHA may help to
compensate brain glucose hypometabolism.31 Alter-
nately, it has also been hypothesized that APOE e4
carriers may modulate n-3 fatty acid metabolism.32
A number of studies have reported protective asso-
ciations of seafood intake on slower global cognitive
decline.17,33–35 Most observed protective benefits at
the level of one seafood meal per week, which is
consistent with our findings. In addition, our finding
of slower decline (in APOE e4 carriers) among per-
sons in the second tertile of long-chain n-3 fatty acid
intake (range 0.35–0.84 g/wk) also approximates the
DHA/EPA content of one 3-oz serving of seafood per
week (e.g., shrimp, 0.23 g; pollock, 0.43 g; sockeye
salmon, 1.04 g; bluefin tuna, 1.28 g). To illustrate the
relevance of our findings, we compared the mixed
model effect estimates for age over time on global
cognition b 5 20.004 to that for weekly seafood
consumption (b 5 0.058). Based on the comparison
of these effect estimates, the rate of cognitive decline
among weekly seafood consumers was the equivalent
of being 14.5 years younger in age.
Our findings of associations with multiple cogni-
tive domains are supported by previous prospective
studies that found associations of higher concentra-
tions of n-3 fatty acids measured in diet or plasma
with slower declines in perceptual speed,33 semantic
memory,35 verbal memory,36 and verbal fluency.37,38
Together, the findings that n-3 fatty acids are
associated with multiple cognitive domains involving
multiple brain regions and cognitive systems suggest
that they may play a fundamental role in brain
neuroprotection.
There are many strengths of the study that lend
confidence in the overall findings. The prospective
design and annual cognitive assessments using
a comprehensive battery of tests over 2–10 years
allowed for more precise measurement of individual
cognitive trajectories to test dietary associations.
This precision was also provided by the use of mul-
tiple tests to measure specific cognitive domains.
The relatively long follow-up period (mean of
4.9 years) after the dietary assessment reduced the
potential for bias due to dietary changes caused by
underlying diseases or cognitive changes. Further,
the results for n-3 fatty acid intake remained after
exclusion of the lowest (10%) baseline cognitive
scores, i.e., those with poorer cognition, which
could have impaired recall on the FFQ. Whereas
dietary intake was assessed with a FFQ that was
validated in a community sample of older Chicago
residents,6,39 there was likely error in the measure-
ment of n-3 fatty acid intake due to nonspecific
information obtained on the type of fresh fish con-
sumed as a main dish. This type of measurement
error would tend to bias the results toward the null
and thus likely had minimal influence on the study
findings. As with all observational studies, despite
adjustment for the most relevant potential con-
founders, residual confounding is still possible.
Another limitation of the study is the relatively small
sample size to detect modest associations within

 subgroups. Therefore, it is possible that a protective
relation of n-3 fatty acids on cognitive decline also
exists among APOE e4 noncarriers, but the power of
the study was insufficient to detect an association. The
average rate of cognitive decline in this group was sub-
stantially less (20.078) than the rate in the APOE e4
carriers (20.126).
Loss in cognitive abilities and dementia are among
the most feared and debilitating conditions of aging
and currently there are no effective treatments. The
role of seafood consumption may be differential de-
pending on APOE e4 status. Randomized trials
would be required to further clarify this possible dis-
tinction. Dietary behaviors, such as the consumption
of one seafood meal per week, are relatively simple
measures for individuals to take with few negative
consequences and potentially many established health
benefits, if not cognitive.40

Comment:
Gene-environment interactions in dementia—
Not just another fish story
Many observational studies have shown relationships between dietary
omega-3 fatty acids and cognitive outcomes, but relatively few have examined
gene–environment interactions due to APOE genotype. In this study, van de Rest
et al.1 highlight the modifying effect of APOE genotype on cognitive effects of
dietary omega-3 fatty acids, finding “protective” effects of dietary seafood/omega-
3s only in the e4 carrier group, which is at higher risk of Alzheimer disease. Prior
observational studies that have incorporated APOE genotype have reported
mixed results, sometimes concluding that the omega-3 benefit is stronger in the
e4 carriers and sometimes in the e4 noncarriers. The finding in the present study is
strengthened by a recent report from the same group showing an inverse relation-
ship between dietary omega-3 and autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer disease brain
pathology, also only in e4 carriers.2 However, observational studies and clinico-
pathologic studies cannot determine with certainty whether dietary or supplemen-
tal omega-3s will attenuate cognitive decline in individuals at risk. Randomized,
placebo-controlled trials are necessary to definitively answer this question. While
most of these have been negative,3 few have included APOE stratification in the
analyses, so may have failed to appreciate genotype-specific effects of omega-3
supplementation.
The implications of the Morris study for practice or for public health are
modest at present. Since the amount of seafood that was “protective” in this study
was the equivalent of one seafood meal per week, and since the American Stroke
Association guidelines already recommend eating fish twice a week for vascular
health, even the most optimistic view of this study would not justify a change in
a neurologist’s dietary recommendation. Furthermore, since the literature remains
mixed regarding APOE and omega-3s, it is premature to suggest APOE genotyp-
ing as a tool to guide dietary recommendations.
