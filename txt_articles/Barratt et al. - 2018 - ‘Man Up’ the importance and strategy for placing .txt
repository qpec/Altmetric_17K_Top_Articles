ABSTRACT: Approximately 1 in 20 young men today have sperm counts low enough to impair fertility, whereas this may not have been
the case historically. The cause(s) of such a decline in male reproductive health is unknown, despite it being a global health issue. Concomitantly,
little progress has been made in answering fundamental questions in andrology or in developing new diagnostic tools or alternative management
strategies to ICSI in infertile men. We advocate formulation of a detailed roadmap for male reproductive health to facilitate development of a
research agenda that highlights the present unmet needs and key unanswered questions, and seeks to deliver effective funding and investment to
address them. This vision we term ‘a Male Reproductive Health Ecosystem’.
Key words: andrology / contraception / IVF ICSI / male infertility / sperm count / spermatogenesis
Introduction
Whilst formulating new World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines
for the diagnosis of male infertility a striking observation was the pau-
city of high quality data on which to base recommendations (Barratt
et al., 2017). Even simple questions did not have sufficient data to for-
mulate ‘low’ let alone ‘strong’ recommendations. Similar deficiencies
are evident regarding other longstanding fundamental questions in
andrology. For example, spermatogenesis is absolutely dependent on
high levels of testosterone, yet the mechanistic pathways via which tes-
tosterone achieves this remains a black box. This is despite our
achievements in successfully manipulating androgen action specifically
in every cell type in the testis via transgenesis (O’Hara and Smith,
2015). This example is symptomatic of much broader ‘andrological
ignorance’, illustrated by the almost complete lack of effective treat-
ments for male infertility or for male reversible contraception other
than the condom—a stark contrast with the female, for whom there
are multiple effective treatments for both infertility and contraception.
This has been thrown into sharp relief by recent confirmation that
sperm counts have been falling steadily for >40 years yet we do not
know why (Levine et al., 2017). Therefore, across the andrology spec-
trum, from basics to the clinic, there is a fundamental lack of knowl-
edge that obstructs research, diagnosis and patient management. So
this is where we are now, but how did we get here and how can we
move forward in a structured way to improve our understanding and
management of male reproductive health issues?
The illusion of progress
Male infertility is part of a dynamic and rapidly growing health industry.
ART is a worldwide, highly innovative, billion dollar enterprise.
Combined with the fact that reproductive medicine is newsworthy
and rapidly captures the attention of the general public, the perception
from the outside is that all is well in the world of male reproduction.
This is an illusion. Numerous basic clinical and scientific questions in
andrology remain unanswered—some for over 50 years. A sentinel

 example is the lack of any real progress in developing robust methods
for semen analysis, despite it being the cornerstone of infertility investi-
gations. If a simple diagnosis cannot be correctly identified then how
can we progress? These limitations have been well rehearsed else-
where but do not diminish our collective universal failure in this area
(Carrell and De Jonge, 2016). Moreover, diagnostic tools/treatments
are introduced too soon, usually without proof of efficacy. A recent
assessment demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of ‘add ons’
in ART (including andrology examples) had no robust evidence to sup-
port their use is damning in this respect (Spencer et al., 2016). To a
large extent, this situation is simply a consequence of our continuing
ignorance about male infertility, as it creates a vacuum that encourages
the premature introduction of new putative diagnostics assays and/or
treatments because there is nothing else to offer patients. Couples
seeking ART because the male partner has poor semen quality are
likely to grasp at any new initiative, irrespective of cost, and are in no
position to judge the benefits or efficacy. The paucity of effective non-
ART treatments for male infertility, at least since 1992, simply adds to
the pressure.
Explanations for ‘andrological
ignorance’—the ICSI paradox
Contrary to the negative perspective above, advances in male repro-
ductive health have been delivered historically. We (the community of
reproductive biology/medicine specialists) have a good history of basic
research leading to clinical benefit, thus demonstrating that genuine
advances in male reproductive health can be delivered. One example
is the development of robust protocols for the cryopreservation of
human sperm (Bunge and Sherman, 1953), which has had a profound
impact on management of subfertile couples. However, the most
transformative example was the truly remarkable development of ICSI
for management of male infertility. Following the first birth of an ICSI-
conceived child in 1992, ICSI use has mushroomed worldwide and is
increasingly used even when no male problem exists (EIM, 2016;
Boulet et al., 2015). However, here’s the paradox. ICSI is not a treat-
ment, as the man’s fertility status remains unchanged (the gametes are
manipulated); it is a treatment of the female partner (encompassing
ovarian stimulation, egg recovery and embryo transfer). Thus, the
woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique
scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI’s success has effectively
diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and
focussed research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs
and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI’s success depends. Thus,
since its introduction 25 years ago, ICSI has effectively served to road-
block further scientific advancement in andrology—a widely argued
viewpoint (Skakkebaek, 2017).
The situation described above has arisen over a long time period.
Simply put, we are where we are so why change now?
Five timely reasons for
immediate action
The first evidence on the legacy of ICSI has emerged—sperm counts
in young men conceived by ICSI are, as a group, ~50% of those in
young men conceived naturally (Belva et al., 2016), and as sperm
counts may be a barometer of overall health and longevity (Glazer
et al., 2017; Hanson et al., 2018), this could be a double whammy for
these men. Are we being complacent about passing on other health
problems for the next generation to deal with?
Significant evidence suggests that the health of future generations
may be influenced epigenetically by the quality of their father’s sperm,
which may have been altered by his diet and/or lifestyle (Lane et al.,
2014; Siklenka et al., 2015); maybe such effects are the explanation for
the fall in sperm counts (Levine et al., 2017).
Fertile mouse sperm can now be generated in vitro (Saitou and
Miyauchi, 2016) and the technology (Clustered Regularly Interspaced
Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease:
CrispR-Cas9) for editing DNA in gametes has arrived (Vassena et al.,
2016). The pressures to use both approaches in human male infertility
are so substantial, that it will undoubtedly happen. As with ICSI, are
we going to sit back complacently whilst it happens? Use of these tech-
niques may have no downside for future generations, but we owe it to
our children and future generations to base this on evidence rather
than blind presumption, as done largely with ICSI.
In many countries, couples are delaying their first attempt at concep-
tion until the female partner is in her 30s when her fertility is declining
progressively (ACOG, 2014). For example in UK, the average age at
first pregnancy in 2016 was 28.8 years and 54% of all pregnancies
were to mothers aged > 30 years (Office for National Statistics,
2016). Therefore, sperm quality in the male partner should be optimal
to maximize chances of a pregnancy, yet sperm counts are falling
(Levine et al. 2017) such that >15% of young men today have subopti-
mal semen quality, with Denmark as an example of the worst case
(Skakkebaek et al., 2016). Evidence of impact is that births in Denmark
due to assisted reproduction (>6%; EIM, 2016) are some of the high-
est in the world.
However, the most concerning issue of all is the burgeoning world
population. Population growth creates significant pressure on limited
world resources and productivity and, without dramatic policy change(s),
is becoming increasingly unsustainable (Gerland et al., 2014; Tilman
et al., 2017). The United Nations (UN) Population Division’s 95%
centile prediction of ~13.2 billion people by 2100 is frankly staggering
and frightening in its potential impact (UN, 2017). It is remarkable
then that contraceptive choices are still very limited and that the cur-
rent global contraceptive strategy is suboptimal as evidenced by the
continual high rates of elective terminations (Department of Health,
2016). Moreover, current strategies focus almost entirely on women.
For example Family Planning 2020 (www.familyplanning2020.org), a
global partnership whose aims are to increase contraception use by
120 million users by 2020, only includes women as users! No effect-
ive, reversible and widely available form of contraception has been
developed for the male since the condom. Thus the burden once
again falls to the female and is a price unfairly paid because of an inad-
equate understanding of the male reproductive process. Effective volun-
tary family planning is fundamental to delivery on the UN 17 Sustainable
Development Goals which will transform our world (Starbird et al.,
2016; FP 2020; Fig. 1). To achieve this, it is critical that the reproductive
input of males be considered of equal importance as females (Hardee
et al., 2016).
As outlined above, the present sidelining of andrology has arisen
over many decades due to a combination of reasons. So how do we
redeem the situation? We suggest the development and execution of a
542

 detailed roadmap—‘Male Reproductive Health Ecosystem’ (Fig. 2).
We propose that it should encompass the areas outlined below.
Identify research gaps
A fundamental part of a strategic roadmap is the identification of
research gaps. The WHO has recently published a summary of the
new evidence-based infertility guidelines (Barratt et al., 2017), which
could act as a foundation for developing strategies to improve
research, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of male reproductive
health disorders, in particular infertility. Nevertheless, it needs updat-
ing and expanding. Moreover, several critical aspects are missing from
the WHO analysis. Primary among these is a detailed assessment of
the economic and societal burden of male reproductive health. Many
other diseases have compelling evidence of economic effects, for
example infectious diseases (Bloom et al., 2017), but this is all but
absent for male reproductive health. A recent study (Hauser et al.,
2015) attempted to address this, although its focus was to suggest that
this burden was attributable to endocrine disrupting chemicals, for
which the evidence is rather limited. But the important point the article
makes is that the cost to the European Union (EU) of male reproduct-
ive health disorders is substantial ~15 billion Euros per year. Such
figures will likely surprise politicians and placing this information more
into the public spotlight is one way to raise awareness and the political
profile for andrology. A fundamental priority is therefore to obtain a
detailed assessment of the economic and societal burden of male
reproductive health disorders. This also needs to take account of the
Figure 1 Family planning as key to success of the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals. Family planning is centre stage to achieving the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Detailed information
is provided in Starbird et al. (2016). See also FP 2020. Momentum at

Figure 2 Male reproductive health ecosystem. The gaps in research
are basic, translational and clinical. The proposal is to include key repre-
sentatives from a spectrum of disciplines early on, for example policy
experts, as in the final analysis some changes in policy strategy will be
required. As for the World Health Organization (WHO) (Barratt et al.,
2017) this could be actioned by Expert Synthesis Groups led by a key
expert. As we propose a strategic plan, overall we must be cognisant of
initiatives in other areas such as growth of big data (Frégnac, 2017; Insel,
2017), whole cell maps (Horwitz and Johnson, 2017) and their biology
(Kosik et al., 2016). Funding for this initial approach would be required
and may come from, for example, The Wellcome Trust. It is initially diffi-
cult to imagine identifying the gaps outwith the auspices of national pro-
fessional societies. The default and easy route would be to get societies
to do this. However, often these are talking shops and action can get
stifled by political wrangling. Moreover, some work at glacial speed. An
international consortium will require an international, co-ordinated effort
across the discipline if it is to be effective. The proposal would work,
throughout, by informing and interacting with key societies such as
ESHRE, The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society for
the Study of Reproduction, the International Society of Andrology, and
international bodies such as WHO, but not be dominated by them. Any
effective strategy needs to be cognisant with what is working so far. For
example, there is a renewed interest in funding work on male contracep-
tion (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, National Institutes of Health).
Several countries have very effective networking for research delivery in
infertility, e.g. The Netherlands. How did they achieve these? What
can other societies/disciplines/models teach us? For example, the role
of specific charities in collaboration with national funding agencies.
Parkinson’s.org.uk is a good example of a charity who have a £20 million
UK research commitment (Parkinson’s.org.uk) for a health issue that is
less prevalent than male infertility. Effectiveness of national programmes
of research should be investigated and benchmarked. Whilst any solu-
tions involve significant new funding for male reproductive research (only
~3.6% of the UK Medical Research Council Populations and Systems
panel budget was provided for male infertility research from 2014 to
2017), a piecemeal approach is not the answer (Spradling, 2016; Bloom
et al., 2017). The roadmap is presented in a simplistic linear fashion but
there would be much dynamic movement between stages.

 impact of infertility at a time when family size across most of the EU is
below replacement level (UN, 2015), as this has huge future implica-
tions for national economics. The increasing contribution of the male
to couple infertility, for reasons outlined above, provides another
opportunity for moving andrology back onto the research priority
stage.
Effecting change
Once the gaps in knowledge are identified and articulated, a coherent
plan for closing them is required. However, identifying the gaps in
knowledge and formulating a plan are only the first steps for an effect-
ive long-term strategy. The key is for this to trigger changes in funding
and, where necessary, policy. This is where it gets difficult. Evidence
alone does not determine action and we need to marshal a whole ser-
ies of skills to influence policy (Cairney, 2012, 2017). As Chris Tyler,
who studied how evidence is used in the UK parliament, elegantly con-
cluded ‘for research to truly inform policy, it is not enough to hope
that the stars will align. The stars need to be wrestled into position’
(Tyler, 2017). One approach would be ‘a New Male Reproductive
Health Ecosystem’ akin to that proposed for cancer research
(Horning, 2017). This can and should involve co-ordination of a
host of different parties including health care providers, patients and
regulatory industries working as one interconnected community.
Concomitantly, our aspirations for research financial support need to
be raised logarithmically. For example, male reproductive health
should be incorporated into the Global Fund to fight disease, which
has been successful worldwide (Sachs and Schmidt-Traub, 2017), and
aligned with worldwide challenges facing non-reproductive health of
the male. Sperm counts may be a barometer for overall male health
(Glazer et al., 2017; Hanson et al., 2018), so evidence that sperm
counts have fallen 59% in ~40 years (Levine et al., 2017) is a wake-up
call. Baker and Shand (2017) in ‘Men’s Health: Time for a new
approach to policy and practice’ show how men are ignored or given
minimal priority in policy and practice to effect the UN’s Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on health and wellbeing (GDG 3). Current pol-
icies are not equally applied to men and women, in part because men
are reluctant to talk about their health problems, whether reproduct-
ive or not (Courtenay, 2000; Himmelstein and Sanchez, 2016).
Part of the execution strategy must involve raising the visibility of
male reproductive health and engaging public support to press for
change. Women could play a key partnership role in this. They have
suffered invasive treatment, on behalf of male infertility management,
with silent dignity in pursuit of a baby, but in a world in which we claim
to be addressing inequalities between men and women, this is a stand-
out example of the infringement of basic human rights and dignity.
Maybe women undergoing treatment during ICSI can begin to apply
pressure at the point of delivery of (their) treatment, asking ‘why can’t
you treat him rather than me?’ Initiatives such as March for Science
(www.marchforscience.com) are a starting platform to explain the
value of male reproductive health research, building on what has
been learnt from initiatives such as Andrology Australia (www.
andrologyaustralia.org) who have taken the lead in ‘normalizing’
men’s health disorders, such that they can be discussed without stig-
mas (Hammarberg et al., 2017). Urgent action is needed and under
one banner—‘Man up’ (with its deliberate euphemism) is an example.
There needs to be a concerted campaign to educate the public about
the enormous gulf in understanding and practice regarding male versus
female reproductive health, making clear this is not because all the pro-
blems are on the female side or because the female carries the biggest
‘reproductive burden’.
Undoubtedly the development and delivery of a new male repro-
ductive health ecosystem is a daunting task. However, we need to
take strength from key advantages to develop a comprehensive strat-
egy. For example, the combination of a dynamic health industry and
large public interest provides an excellent starting point from which to
go forward. Moreover, in some countries, a highly innovative regula-
tory framework is aligned with a strong translational arm (ART indus-
try), which should facilitate and oversee the effective execution of
novel research in humans (www.hfea.gov.uk; National Centres for
Translational Research in Reproduction and Infertility www.nichd.nih.
gov/research/supported/NCTRI; Reproductive Medicine Network
http://c2s2.yale.edu/rmn/).
Future perspectives
Medicine currently faces the exciting challenge of incorporating new
technology (e.g. stem cell therapy, gene editing), with its huge potential
benefits, into patient care. To do this effectively, with minimal side-
effects, understanding in a given area needs to be sufficiently advanced
to enable technological advances to ‘slot in’. We are far from this pos-
ition with male reproductive health, yet the new technology is almost
ready to use. Unless we ‘Man up’ our research now, the present gulf in
knowledge and effective therapy for infertility between male and
female will grow, and it will become easier to use in vitro generated
male germ cells than naturally produced sperm to achieve couple fertil-
ity, making infertile men truly redundant. More worrying, however, is
that such applications will be founded as much on guesswork as on
understanding. The future wellbeing of children resulting from assisted
reproduction should not be left to chance, and we should have a clear
understanding of the risks versus benefits before embracing these new
developments.
