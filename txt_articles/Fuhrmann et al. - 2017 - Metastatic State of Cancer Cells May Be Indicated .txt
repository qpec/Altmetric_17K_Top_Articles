ABSTRACT
Cancer cells within a tumor are heterogeneous and only a small fraction are able to form secondary tumors. Uni-
versal biological markers that clearly identify potentially metastatic cells are limited, which complicates isolation and further
study. However, using physical rather than biological characteristics, we have identified Mg2þ- and Ca2þ-mediated differences
in adhesion strength between metastatic and nonmetastatic mammary epithelial cell lines, which occur over concentration
ranges similar to those found in tumor stroma. Metastatic cells exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in their adhesion strength under
stromal-like conditions, unlike their nonmetastatic counterparts, which exhibit Mg2þ- and Ca2þ-insensitive adhesion. This het-
erogeneity is the result of increased sensitivity to Mg2þ- and Ca2þ-mediated focal adhesion disassembly in metastatic cells,
rather than changes in integrin expression or focal adhesion phosphorylation. Strongly adherent metastatic cells exhibit less
migratory behavior, similar to nonmetastatic cell lines but contrary to the unselected metastatic cell population. Adhesion
strength heterogeneity was observed across multiple cancer cell lines as well as isogenically, suggesting that adhesion strength
may serve as a general marker of metastatic cells.
INTRODUCTION
Cancer cell dissemination is a highly coordinated process in
which a cell detaches and migrates away from the primary
tumor to form a secondary metastatic site (1). However,
only a small subset of cancer cells from a tumor or even
from a cancer cell line are capable of causing secondary tu-
mors in vivo (2). Successful dissemination requires collagen
fiber deposition, alignment, and cross-linking in the adja-
cent stromal matrix (3,4) to create tracks on which cells
migrate. However, this will only occur in cells with labile
adhesions (5). Focal adhesion (FA) turnover permits the
migration required of invasive cancer cells (6), which tend
to have more dynamic FAs than noninvasive cancer cells
(7,8). Due to the lack of a consistent set of biomarkers
that predict metastatic potential across solid tumors (9), a
systematic quantification of adhesion strength could result
in a unique biophysical metric to identify highly metastatic
cells within a broader tumor cell population. Furthermore, a
quantification of tumor cell adhesion strength could serve as
a predictor of the metastatic potential of a solid tumor.
Population-based adhesion assays, e.g., the spinning-disk
shear assay (10), can monitor FAs by measuring adhesion
strength. Specifically, by analyzing the magnitude of shear
needed to detach 75% of the cell population (denoted by
t25), we are able to quantify the adhesion strength of a
cell population and correlate it with FA assembly. In addi-
tion, the spinning-disk shear assay can capture adhesion
heterogeneity within a population (11). For example, by
plotting a log shear stress versus linear cell density profile,
we are able to analyze the logarithmic slope for the resulting
sigmoidal curve. From these data, we are able to determine
the attachment heterogeneity of a cell type in a variety of
conditions. In contrast, single-cell, single-shear, and wash
assays cannot quantify these values (8,12–16). Although
some studies have shown a correlation between changes in
adhesion and secondary tumor development (14–16), sub-
stantial phenotypic heterogeneity can exist even within a
single cancer cell line (17). Thus, understanding the adhe-
sive heterogeneity within an invasive population may
improve our ability to physically monitor cancer cells and
predict
invasive
behavior.
Population-based
adhesion
assays also provide a reductionist niche for determining
sensitivity to culture conditions (e.g., cation concentration
and matrix composition) (11). This is especially important
because breast tumors have higher magnesium (Mg) and

 calcium (Ca) concentrations than healthy breast tissue
(18,19). Clinically, lower stromal cation concentrations
have been associated with increasingly metastatic (20) and
aggressive (21) tumors. As cancer cells migrate into the
stroma, lower Mg2þ and Ca2þ concentrations may decrease
integrin activation (22) and clustering (23,24), thus favoring
the labile adhesions required for cancer cell migration (5).
These data appear consistent with observations that integrin
activation is inversely proportional to the metastatic poten-
tial of mammary cell lines (8), whereas traction forces
are proportional (25). These data collectively suggest that
heterogeneity in the adhesion-strength profile in stromal
conditions may act as a biophysical marker, indicating
the presence of a subset of metastatic cancer cells that
are capable of disseminating into the stroma with lower
Mg2þ and Ca2þ concentrations. Thus, we hypothesize that
strongly adherent cells within a metastatic cell line will be
the least migratory, and that adhesion strength is regulated
by the sensitivity of assembled FAs to stromal Mg2þ and
Ca2þ concentrations.
To understand how Mg2þ and Ca2þ influences cancer
cell adhesion, we performed a spinning-disk analysis on
epithelial and invasive cancer cell lines across a spectrum
of metastatic potentials while varying the Mg2þ and Ca2þ
levels. We observed a remarkable cellular heterogeneity
and a decrease in cellular adhesion strength during the
spinning-disk analysis. This was quantified by a decrease
in logarithmic slope and a leftward shift in the t25 value
when shear stress was plotted versus cell density. This
phenotype was only present in low Mg2þ and Ca2þ condi-
tions for metastatic cell lines. These observations corre-
lated with FA disassembly and were recapitulated in
nonmetastatic cell lines that had been transformed to
mirror their metastatic counterparts. The data further estab-
lish that metastatic cells with less labile adhesions and
higher
adhesion
strength
have
reduced
migration
in
collagen gels and transwell assays. These behaviors were
independent of tumor and tissue type, and were demon-
strated isogenically. These results support the concept
that adhesion strength may act as a universal biophysical
regulator of metastasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Cells were cultured in their respective media as indicated in Table S1 in the
Supporting Material, using typical formulations from Life Technologies
(Carlsbad, CA) and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA). When applicable, cells were selectively cultured with
RGD peptides (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). All cells were cultured at 37�C in
a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Unless otherwise noted, cell
culture products were purchased from Life Technologies. All cells were ob-
tained from the ATCC cell bank and verified to be mycoplasma free. Cells
were also authenticated by the ATCC based on morphology, growth curve
analysis, and isoenzyme analysis, and were passaged for <6 months after
resuscitation.
Cell adhesion-strength assay
Glass coverslips (25 mm, Fisher Scientific, St. Louis, MO) were sonicated
in ethanol and pure water before incubation with 10 mg/mL human fibro-
nectin (isolated from serum (26)) for 60 min at room temperature. All adhe-
sion-strength assays were performed on fibronectin-coated coverslips
unless otherwise noted, and 20 mg/mL type I collagen (rat tail; BD Biosci-
ences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was used. Under regular conditions, cells were
allowed to attach for 24 h at 37�C and 5% CO2 using cation-containing me-
dia. The coverslips were then mounted on a custom-built spinning-disk de-
vice and dipped into temperature-controlled spinning buffer (37�C) (11).
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; without magnesium and calcium or with
0.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2 (Cellgro, Manassas, VA)) was used as
the spinning buffer. All spinning buffers contained 4.5 mg/mL dextrose.
Once immersed in the spinning buffer, the coverslips were spun for
5 min at defined angular velocities and then the culture was continued or
the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde immediately after spinning.
To select for strongly attaching cells, the center of the coverslips was
covered with Parafilm that had been circularly cut with a crafting punch
(The Punch Bunch, Temple, TX) and removed before shear application to
ensure that all cells were subjected to a minimum shear. After 5 min of
shear application, cells were allowed to recover in cell culture media for
1–2 h. The remaining cells were then trypsinized and replated on regular
petri dish plastic. Control cells were treated likewise but without applica-
tion of shear (i.e., 0 rpm).
Quantification of adhesion strength
Shear stress, t, by radial fluid motion over the surface of the coverslip was
calculated (10,27) such that:
t ¼ 4

where r is the radial position from the center of the disk, r is the buffer den-
sity, m is the buffer viscosity, and u is the rotational speed. To obtain quan-
titative information about the adhesion strength, whole 25 mm coverslips
were imaged at 10� magnification on a Nikon (Melville, NY) Ti-S micro-
scope (~1000 individual images stitched together with Metamorph 7.6 soft-
ware and custom macros) and analyzed using a custom-written MATLAB
(The MathWorks, Natick, MA) program. In brief, in this approach, the
user defines the outer circle of the coverslip from a stitched overview image
and the software then finds the position of each nucleus relative to the center
of the coverslip. Cell densities, as a function of radial position and subse-
quently shear, are stored and combined with other measurements, e.g., those
obtained at different RPMs. A sigmoidal decay fit is used to quantify values
of adhesion strength and the logarithmic slope, i.e., the fit parameter in the
sigmoid for curve steepness.
Migration assays
For two-dimensional migration experiments, tissue-culture-treated 12- and
24-well plates were coated with soluble rat-tail type I collagen in acetic acid
(BD Biosciences) to achieve a coverage of 20 mg/cm2 and incubated
at room temperature for 1 h. For two-dimensional migration, collagen
matrices at 1.2 and 2.4 mg/mL concentrations were prepared as described
elsewhere (28). In brief, collagen was mixed with ice-cold PBS and 1 M
NaOH was then added to normalize the pH to 7.0. Cells were imaged
with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope equipped with a motorized temper-
ature- and CO2-controlled stage. Cells were imaged at 10� in bright field at
multiple positions every 15 min for up to 48 h. Most of the migration data
were analyzed by Time Lapse Analyzer, a freely available MATLAB pro-
gram for cell migration analysis (29). Samples that could not be analyzed by
the automated software (due to gel swelling and/or z-migration of the cells)
were tracked manually with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

 Additional migration experiments utilized six-well plates with transwell
permeable supports (8 mm polycarbonate membrane; Corning, Corning,
NY) that were seeded with 100,000 cells. After cells adhered to the perme-
able support, media was added to the whole well. Cells were allowed to
migrate through the membrane for 24 h and then fixed and stained for nuclei
(DAPI). Cells that successfully migrated through the membrane were
counted on the bottom of the permeable support (ceiling). Additionally,
cells that dropped off the support and adhered to the bottom of the six-
well plate were also counted (bottom).
Immunofluorescence staining and focal adhesion
analysis
Fixed cells were incubated for 10 min with 0.25% Triton X-100 followed by
1% albumin overnight at 4�C for blocking. Primary paxillin antibody
(1:2000; ab32084, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was applied for 2 h at room
temperature. Then, a secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody
(1:2000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was applied for 1 h or rhodamine phal-
loidin (1:2000, Invitrogen) and Hoechst 33342 (3.2 mM, Invitrogen) were
applied for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were subsequently
mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). All
buffers contained 1 mM MgCl2. The samples were imaged with the use
of a CARV II confocal (BD Biosciences) Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope
equipped with a motorized, programmable stage using a Cool-Snap HQ
camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and controlled by Metamorph 7.6
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). A custom-written MATLAB program
was used to quantify cell area and FA number and size (11). All FA metrics
were computed across the entire cell to avoid regional biases.
Western blotting
Cell lysates were collected in mRIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5),
150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Na-DOC, and
0.1% SDS) with 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM Na4P2O7, and
1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride for Western blots. Samples were
run in 10% SDS-PAGE gels at 150 V until proteins were separated and
then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercu-
les, CA) to be run at 100 V for 1 h 15 min in the transfer apparatus (Bio-
Rad). The membranes were washed in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl,
150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) 5% bovine serum albumin overnight
at 4�C and then incubated for 2 h with the following antibodies: FA kinase
(FAK; ab40794) at 1/500 and pFAK anti-phospho Y397 (ab4803) at 1/500
(both from Abcam), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; MAB374) at 1/250 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After three
10-min washes with buffer A, secondary goat anti-rabbit horseradish perox-
idase (Bio-Rad) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Abcam) were used
for incubation for 30 min. Immunoblots were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
Cells were detached from fibronectin-treated coverslips by incubation for
5–10 min with PBS without cations at 37�C and gentle pipetting. After re-
suspension in flow-cytometry buffer (DPBS, 2.5% goat serum, 1 mM EDTA
(pH 7.4)), the cells were incubated with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies
against CD49e (phycoerythrin) and CD51 (fluorescein isothiocyanate)
(Biolegend, San Diego, CA) for 30 min on ice. Cells were analyzed using
a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Statistical analysis
Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance tests were used
for all statistical analyses unless indicated otherwise. All data in shear
plots are expressed as mean 5 SD. All experiments were performed at least
in biological triplicate, and analyses represent hundreds of cells per
condition.
RESULTS
Mg2D and Ca2D concentrations influence the
adhesion heterogeneity of metastatic cells
To disseminate from primary tumors, metastatic cancer cells
must invade adjacent stroma, which requires a transition
from stable to labile adhesion. Using a spinning-disk device
(Fig. S1), we measured the adhesion strength, t25, of mam-
mary epithelial cell lines of varying metastatic potential. At
physiological (serum) cation concentrations, i.e., 0.5 mM
Mg2þ and 1 mM Ca2þ (denoted as PBSþMgCa), the adhe-
sion strengths of nontumorigenic MCF10A cells, tumori-
genic but not metastatic MCF7 cells, and tumorigenic and
metastatic MDAMB231 cells to fibronectin were very
similar, with no dramatic differences (Fig. 1, black). Mg2þ
and Ca2þ concentrations differ between a healthy niche
and tumor niche (18,19), and their removal during 5 min
of shear application only slightly reduced the adhesion
strength of MCF10A and MCF7 cells. However, the removal
of Mg2þ and Ca2þ significantly reduced MDAMB231 cell
adhesion strength (Fig. 1, red) by more than an order of
magnitude (Fig. 1 E). Notably, the cell adhesion strength
of the latter metastatic cell line was very heterogeneously
distributed, with a significantly lower logarithmic slope
versus nonmetastatic lines (Fig. 1 F). Given the significant
genetic differences between these lines, we also assessed
the adhesion strength of H-Ras-transformed MCF10A cells
(labeled MCF10AT cells), which give rise to invasive car-
cinoma in vivo (30). As was the case with MDAMB231
cells, the MCF10AT cells showed Mg2þ and Ca2þ sensi-
tivity, with lower t25 and slightly more heterogeneity
than MCF10A cells (Fig. 1 D, open versus closed data
points). In contrast to fibroblasts (11), shear forces in the
presence of Mg2þ and Ca2þ did not induce large changes
in size for any of the cell lines tested. Furthermore, in
the presence of Mg2þ and Ca2þ, variation in cell size
across different cell lines was within the same order of
magnitude. In these analyses, we visually assessed the cells
to ensure that they were sufficiently spaced apart to prevent
cell-cell interactions from disrupting the shear analysis
(Fig. S2).
Although these data were obtained over a wide range of
Mg2þ and Ca2þ concentrations, concentration gradients
likely exist between the tumor and adjacent stroma
(18,19). We found that homogeneous and strong adhesion
strengths for metastatic cells, i.e., high t25 and a logarithmic
fit slope in density versus shear plots, could be gradually
restored with increasing cation concentrations (Fig. 2 A),
independently of cation type (Mg or Ca), with significant
sensitivity at tumor and adjacent stroma concentrations

 (Fig. 2 B). Mg2þ- and Ca2þ-dependent adhesion heteroge-
neity was also observed on type I collagen and could be
gradually restored with increasing Mg2þ and Ca2þ concen-
trations (Fig. 2, C and D). Conversely, adhesion strength
changes were minimal for nontumorigenic cells, which
always exhibited strong adhesion (Fig. S3). Thus, metastatic
mammary epithelial cells likely adhere in a metastatic-
potential-dependent manner based on a subset of FA
parameters.
Adhesive heterogeneity also extends beyond MDAMB231
cells
to
other
metastatic
cells.
For
comparison,
we
analyzed metastatic MDAMB468 and SUM1315 mammary
cells by spinning-disk assay to determine the heterogeneity
of their adhesion strength. The cells were sufficiently
spaced apart to enable measurements of only the cell-
matrix adhesion strength (27) (Fig. S2). Although it was
not as robust as that observed for MDAMB231 cells,
their adhesion strength was also heterogeneously distrib-
uted in terms of a lower t25 and logarithmic fit slope,
especially in comparison with BT20, an invasive but non-
metastatic mammary cell line, and BT549, a nonmalignant
and nonmetastatic mammary cell line. PC-3 prostate carci-
noma cells, a tumorigenic and highly metastatic cell
line, also exhibited heterogeneously distributed adhesion
(Fig. S4), indicating that common FA parameters may
make adhesion strength a unique biophysical metric of
cell state.
Adhesion heterogeneity correlates with a
migratory phenotype
Although metastatic mammary epithelial cells display adhe-
sive heterogeneity in a niche with low concentrations of
Mg2þ and Ca2þ, it remains unclear how adhesion differ-
ences affect migration. We assessed cell migration in cell
media containing physiological Mg2þ and Ca2þ concentra-
tions first by selecting for strongly adherent cells, as out-
lined in Fig. 3 A. Migration appeared to change with
relative adhesive heterogeneity in the absence of Mg2þ
and Ca2þ; for example, minimal migration was observed
for MCF10A cells and MDAMB231 cells selected with
45 dynes/cm2 shear, whereas unselected MDAMB231 cells

 were significantly more motile (Fig. 3 B) and progressive in
their migration. Migration of unselected MDAMB231 cells
in collagen gels was increasingly persistent and linear with
collagen concentration. Conversely, strongly adherent cells
selected with high shear progressively lost their persistent,
linear migration (Fig. 3 C). Other metastatic mammary
cells, i.e., SUM1315, also demonstrated adhesive heteroge-
neity (Fig. S4), exhibiting more persistent, linear migration
on collagen-coated, planar substrates than on collagen hy-
drogels. Migration of unselected SUM1315 cells, however,
was more persistent and linear on collagen hydrogels
compared with strongly adhering cells (Fig. S5 A). Migra-
tion of PC3 prostate cancer cells was also more persistent
and linear with the unselected cell population (Fig. S5 B).
These data suggest that shear selection can selectively
isolate highly adhesive, Mg2þ- and Ca2þ-independent
MDAMB231 cells, which appear to be less migratory than
unselected MDAMB231 cells. Cell migration was also as-
sessed using a transwell assay over 48 h. Relative to
MCF10A cells, twice as many unselected MDAMB231
cells migrated through the pores. Metastatic cells demon-
strating a strongly adherent phenotype during shear selec-
tion also exhibited decreased migration in the transwell
assay. Interestingly, a significant number of MDAMB231
cells detached from the transwell insert and reattached
to the chamber bottom. Significantly more MDAMB231
cells underwent this process compared with MCF10A
(Fig. 3 D). Thus, the highly adhesive, Mg2þ- and Ca2þ-inde-
pendent MDAMB231 cells appear to be less migratory than
their unselected counterparts, which contain a highly migra-
tory subpopulation.
Labile FAs reduce adhesion strength and
enhance migration in metastatic cells
Although these data illustrate adhesive differences and their
correlation to a migratory phenotype, they do not suggest an
origin for these differences. Strongly adherent MDAMB231
cells did not differentially express integrins (Fig. 4 A), nor
did phosphorylation of FAK change between MCF10A
and MDAMB231 cells as a function of shear exposure
(Fig. 4 B), suggesting a structural mechanism. Consistent
with their adhesion strength, MCF10A cells did not fully
disassemble their FAs (Fig. 4, C and D) and maintained their
size and shape (Fig. 4, E and F) after Mg2þ and Ca2þ
removal in the absence of shear. Conversely, metastatic
MDAMB231 cells disassembled their FAs (Fig. 4, G
and H) without significant changes in their size or
morphology (Fig. 4, I and J). Thus, Mg2þ and Ca2þ sensi-
tivity in the absence of shear suggests that MDAMB231 ad-
hesions are transient and independent of the amount of
elapsed culture time before shear application.
Although MCF10A cells did not exhibit Mg2þ- and Ca2þ-
sensitive adhesion, we next asked whether we could induce
FA disassembly and adhesion strength heterogeneity in
these cells. Cells were seeded onto a fibronectin-coated sub-
strate and pretreated with the fibronectin integrin-blocking
peptide RGD. When the fibronectin-binding integrins were

 blocked, cells without Mg2þ and Ca2þ exhibited statis-
tically fewer FAs per area (Fig. 5, A and B). These data
are consistent with fewer FAs but a different distribution
from MDAMB231 cells (Fig. 5 B versus Fig. 4 H). When
exposed to shear, RGD-treated MCF10A cells exhibited
lower adhesion strengths but were not as heterogeneous as
MDAMB231 cells (Fig. 5 C), possibly due to uniform integ-
rin blocking with RGD ligand. Free RGD improved cell
migration velocity (Fig. 5 D) to rates similar to those
observed for MDAMB231 cells versus untreated nonmeta-
static cells. Overall, these data suggest that FAs in metasta-
tic cells are more Mg2þ and Ca2þ sensitive than those in
nonmetastatic cells, and disassemble in stromal conditions
(in contrast to nonmetastatic cells), thus driving the metasta-
tic potential.
DISCUSSION
Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, which can be observed in
comparisons between tumors, across cell lines, and even
within a single cancer cell population. Complex tumor gen-
otyping has been used to predict metastatic risk (31,32), and
although these predictions are successful for some tumor
subclasses (33), they do not identify the functional media-
tors of metastasis (34). Even in model cell lines, a subpop-
ulation may develop increased metastatic potential under
certain conditions that could inhibit metastasis for others.
Rather than using biomarker(s) to predict metastatic poten-
tial (9), we tested a functional assay that allows the strength
of cell adhesion to an underlying substrate to be observed
ex vivo and in the appropriate context (i.e., with specific
Mg2þ and Ca2þ concentrations to recapitulate tumor
stroma) (18,19). It has been observed that lower cation con-
centrations, akin to those found in tumor stroma, create
labile adhesions (5) and lead to increased metastasis (20)
and invasion (21). We demonstrated that 1) a systematic
quantification of metastatic versus nonmetastatic cells can
reveal different adhesive phenotypes, and 2) that these dif-
ferences are driven by changes in FA dynamics resulting
from stromal niche conditions.
Cell-matrix adhesion is an exceedingly dynamic process
(1). To capture that complexity in a context-specific manner,
a systematic quantification of adhesion under appropriate
tumor and stromal cation conditions is required. Classic
wash assays involve cells adhering for a short period of
time (<1 h), with subsequent rinsing steps to remove un-
bound cells (13). The undefined shear in such assays makes
it difficult to quantitatively assess cancer cell adhesion.
Although
centrifugation
and
micropipette
assays
can
impose a single shear amount per culture, they typically
indicate that the number of bound cancer cells (14–16)
and the amount of activated integrin (8) is inversely propor-
tional to the metastatic potential of those cells. However,
with the spinning-disk device, force is applied in a quantifi-
able and reproducible manner across the population (10).
Furthermore, cation concentrations can also be probed
directly since the cells remain in media (11). Under
conditions that recapitulate estimated tumor Mg2þ and

 Ca2þ concentrations, e.g., 0.1–0.5 mM (18,19), we found
that several mammary cell lines had adhesion strengths be-
tween 300 and 400 dynes/cm2, regardless of the metastatic
potential. At lower stromal cation concentrations, metastatic
cells became significantly weaker and displayed adhesive
heterogeneity, whether they originated from mammary
(MDAMB231, SUM1315, and MDAMB468) or prostate
(PC3) cancers. In contrast, nonmetastatic cell lines did not
demonstrate significant adhesion strength heterogeneity.
Moreover H-Ras transformation of a nonmetastatic cell
line caused it to adopt adhesive heterogeneity only in
Mg2þ- and Ca2þ-free conditions, indicating that indepen-
dently of their genetic background, metastatic cell lines
vary significantly in adhesion strength. Together with previ-
ous findings (14–16), these data establish an adhesion
dependence on stromal-like conditions for a subset of met-
astatic cells.
The mechanism(s) behind adhesive heterogeneity and
cation sensitivity in cells appears to be complex, whether
the cells are selected by shear or not. Although metastatic
behavior was previously linked to diminished integrin acti-
vation (8), we found no change in integrin expression or
FAK phosphorylation that was independent of the buffer
conditions used. However, blocking ion channels in meta-
static mammary and prostate cancer cells artificially
enhanced their adhesion in single-cell assays versus control
cells (14), suggesting that cation effects are plausible.
Indeed, we found that MCF10A adhesions were less cation
sensitive than MDAMB231 adhesions, as their FA size and
number changed less after Mg2þ and Ca2þ removal in com-
parison with the MDAMB231 cells. Similarly, when
MCF10A cell FA assembly was modulated by the addition
of soluble RGD, the resulting changes in FAs reduced adhe-
sion strength in a manner consistent with that observed for
MDAMB231 cells. It should be noted that MCF10A cells
were more sensitive to ligand type, although the sensitivity
was always observed with adhesion strengths well above
100 dynes/cm2. The sensitivity of MDAMB231 cells was
observed at lower adhesion strengths and also induced het-
erogeneous adhesion, i.e., a shallow logarithmic slope.
Under comparable matrix and cation conditions, MCF10A
cells never exhibited heterogeneous adhesion. Together,
these data suggest that assembly differences in low Mg2þ
and Ca2þ conditions in the stroma could drive adhesion
strength heterogeneity. As such, assembly changes have
been equated to differences in turnover (7) and might be
expected to create MDAMB231 cells with labile adhesions
required for 3D protrusion and migration (28). This interpre-
tation is consistent with metastatic and invasive behaviors
observed in low Mg2þ- and Ca2þ-containing stroma
(20,21). We also showed that shear selection of the
strongly adhering subpopulation of MDAMB231 cells
(>45 dynes/cm2) suppressed their migration on collagen
gels and their ability to migrate through transwells, such
that they resembled the less cation-sensitive, nonmetastatic
cells. Although the origin of increased FA cation sensitivity

 remains unclear, the mechanism is not specific to mammary
cells, since adhesion-selected PC3 prostate cancer cells also
failed to migrate on substrates and/or in transwell assays as
did their unselected counterparts. Together, these data sug-
gest that there is a common heterogeneous adhesive signa-
ture in cell lines described as having metastatic potential,
and importantly, within this population is a subset of weakly
adherent, highly migratory cells.
CONCLUSIONS
Given the heterogeneity and plasticity observed in the
adhesive phenotype and the inverse correlation between
migration and strongly adherent subpopulations, the data
presented here emphasize the importance of therapeutically
targeting as many cancer cell states as possible, instead of
focusing on the largest population or most aggressive phe-
notypes. These data also suggest that the adhesive state,
when measured in the appropriate stromal cation concentra-
tions, could serve as a unique biophysical marker for highly
migratory behavior in metastatic cells generally.
