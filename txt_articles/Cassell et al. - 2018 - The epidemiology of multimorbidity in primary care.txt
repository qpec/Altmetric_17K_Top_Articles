 INTRODUCTION
Multimorbidity is defined as the coexistence 
of two or more long-term medical conditions 
or diseases.1 Patients with numerous long-
term conditions often have complicated 
medical needs, including understanding and 
managing multiple illnesses and complex 
medication 
regimens.1 
Multimorbidity 
is challenging for the healthcare system 
to manage, because patients who have 
it often require more intensive treatment 
and monitoring by physicians, nurses, 
and other healthcare providers.2 Many 
studies have shown a positive association 
between the prevalence of multimorbidity 
and age2–5 so, as the population of older 
individuals in developed nations continues 
to grow, multimorbidity is likely to become 
increasingly common.6 
Multimorbidity has a substantial impact 
on various health services ranging from 
general practice to end-of-life care. Much 
of the management of patients with 
multimorbidity is undertaken in primary 
care, placing large demands on GPs, 
many of whom are already dealing with 
unsustainable increases in their workload.7 
Describing the relationship and quantifying 
the associations between multimorbidity 
and health service utilisation can provide 
information about overburdened aspects of 
primary care, identifying areas for increased 
resource allocation or targets for systems-
level restructuring. 
In previous studies, patients with 
multimorbidity have been identified either 
through self-reporting illnesses8,9 or, 
more commonly, by extracting information 
from electronic health records (EHRs) 
using lists of diagnostic and prescription 
codes.2–4,10,11 These code lists likely differ 
substantially between studies and, although 
standardised published lists exist for use 
in specific contexts — for example, those 
used to identify conditions as part of the 
UK pay-for-performance Quality and 
Outcomes Framework (QOF) — there is 
currently no single set of codes that has been 
consistently used to identify patients with 
a given condition. Many code lists used in 
multimorbidity studies have varying levels of 
sensitivity and specificity, and are subjective 
because their content is at the discretion 
of the researchers or physicians involved in 
the study. 
A study on 40 long-term conditions by 
Barnett et al based on Scottish general 
practice data from 2007 described the 
prevalence of multimorbidity in Scottish 
primary care.4 Subsequent work, also in 
Scotland and based on the same list of 
morbidities, reported a strong association 
between multimorbidity and hospitalisation.12 
The list of conditions included in these studies 
was a pragmatic compromise between 
smaller lists that have clear, accepted coded 
definitions (including that used by the QOF), 
and the far larger, more inclusive Johns 
Research
Abstract
Background
Multimorbidity places a substantial burden on 
patients and the healthcare system, but few 
contemporary epidemiological data are available. 
Aim
To describe the epidemiology of multimorbidity 
in adults in England, and quantify associations 
between multimorbidity and health service 
utilisation. 
Design and setting
Retrospective cohort study, undertaken in 
England. 
Method
The study used a random sample of 403 985 adult 
patients (aged ≥18 years), who were registered 
with a general practice on 1 January 2012 
and included in the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink. Multimorbidity was defined as having 
two or more of 36 long-term conditions recorded 
in patients’ medical records, and associations 
between multimorbidity and health service 
utilisation (GP consultations, prescriptions, and 
hospitalisations) over 4 years were quantified. 
Results
In total, 27.2% of the patients involved in the study 
had multimorbidity. The most prevalent conditions 
were hypertension (18.2%), depression or anxiety 
(10.3%), and chronic pain (10.1%). The prevalence 
of multimorbidity was higher in females than 
males (30.0% versus 24.4% respectively) and 
among those with lower socioeconomic status 
(30.0% in the quintile with the greatest levels of 
deprivation versus 25.8% in that with the lowest). 
Physical–mental comorbidity constituted a much 
greater proportion of overall morbidity in both 
younger patients (18–44 years) and those patients 
with a lower socioeconomic status. Multimorbidity 
was strongly associated with health service 
utilisation. Patients with multimorbidity accounted 
for 52.9% of GP consultations, 78.7% of 
prescriptions, and 56.1% of hospital admissions.
Conclusion
Multimorbidity is common, socially patterned, 
and associated with increased health service 
utilisation. These findings support the need 
to improve the quality and efficiency of health 
services providing care to patients with 
multimorbidity at both practice and national 
level.

The epidemiology of multimorbidity 
in primary care:
a retrospective cohort study
e245  British Journal of General Practice, April 2018
 Hopkins University Adjusted Clinical Groups 
Case-Mix Systems (ACG) lists.4,12 The ACG 
lists are complex and difficult to implement 
in research or clinical settings; the QOF lists 
— although more practical to implement 
— fail to capture important, common 
conditions, such as chronic pain, which can 
have a significant impact on patient care and 
quality of life. Additionally, the diagnostic and 
prescribing code lists used in these Scottish 
studies are not readily available, the methods 
used to derive the codes are not well 
described, and the association with service 
utilisation beyond hospital admission has 
not been examined. Furthermore, the data 
are now over 10 years old and considerable 
changes in both disease prevalence and 
health service use might be expected over 
this time period. 
The study presented here aimed to provide 
a comprehensive and more contemporary 
description 
of 
the 
epidemiology 
of 
multimorbidity 
in 
England 
and 
its 
association with health service utilisation, 
using a refined list of long-term conditions 
based on the work by Barnett et al.4 
METHOD
Patient population and data acquisition
Data for this study were obtained from the 
Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). 
The CPRD provides researchers with 
anonymised clinical information extracted 
from consenting general practice EHRs that 
are uploaded to the CPRD on a monthly 
basis. The CPRD contains information from 
approximately 6.9% of the UK population 
and is representative of the UK general 
population in terms of age, sex, and 
ethnicity.13,14 To ensure records were up to 
date, patients had to have up-to-standard 
registration data for at least 1 year prior to 
the beginning of the study and through its 
completion. 
This study linked CPRD patient-level 
general practice clinical data to: 
• an area-based measure of socioeconomic 
deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation 
[IMD]); and 
• national 
hospital 
admissions 
administrative data (Hospital Episodes 
Statistics [HES]). 
Of the practices that provide patient data 
to CPRD, 75% participate in this linkage 
scheme; only patients from practices 
that participated in this data linkage were 
eligible for inclusion in the study.
Definition of multimorbidity
Patients with multimorbidity were defined 
as having two or more currently active 
long-term conditions out of a list of 36 
conditions. The detailed definition for each 
condition was developed by a group of 
researchers and GPs from the Primary Care 
Unit, University of Cambridge. The overall 
taxonomy drew largely on the previous work 
by Barnett et al in Scotland;4 the authors 
of the study presented here used Barnett 
et al’s definition of morbidities, which 
comprised those conditions:
‘… likely to be chronic (defined as having 
significant impact over at least the most 
recent year) and with significant impact 
on patients in terms of need for chronic 
treatment, reduced function, reduced quality 
of life, and risk of future morbidity and 
mortality.’15
Information identifying whether patients 
had current, active morbidities was extracted 
from patients’ primary care medical records 
in the CPRD, using a list of both Read 
codes (used by UK GPs to record coded 
information in the EHR about diagnoses and 
administrative activity) and product codes 
(which are unique to the CPRD, and reflect 
all prescribed pharmacological and non-
pharmacological products recorded in the 
EHR). A detailed description of how each 
individual condition was defined is available 
from the authors on request. 
In addition to the prevalence of 
multimorbidity, the association between 
mental health morbidities and physical 
morbidities was also examined, with 
the authors specifically looking at the 
coexistence of at least one mental morbidity 
(for example, depression/anxiety) with at 
How this fits in
Multimorbidity is known to be increasingly 
common in developed countries; in 2007, 
a large Scottish study found that 23.2% 
of the population had multimorbidity. The 
study presented here provides a more 
up-to-date and comprehensive description 
of multimorbidity than exists in the current 
literature, and describes a large English 
population in 2012. It found a slightly higher 
rate of multimorbidity at 27.2%, and higher 
rates of multimorbidity with increased 
age and greater levels of socioeconomic 
deprivation. A third of patients with 
multimorbidity have a mental health 
condition. The majority of GP consultations, 
prescriptions, and hospital admissions 
involve patients with multimorbidity.
British Journal of General Practice, April 2018  e246
 least one physical morbidity (for example, 
hypertension). 
Study design 
In a retrospective cohort study, the authors 
quantified the cross-sectional prevalence of 
multimorbidity on 1 January 2012 in relation 
to several covariates: 
• sex;
• age; and 
• socioeconomic status (SES). 
They then assessed health service 
utilisation over 4 years between 1 January 
2012 and 31 December 2015. Utilisation 
was defined as the number of yearly GP 
consultations (including face-to-face and 
telephone consultations), the total number 
of prescriptions (including pharmaceuticals 
and non-pharmaceuticals) issued to a 
patient in a year, and the total number of 
yearly inpatient hospital admissions. More 
details about the specific consultation types 
that were included are available from the 
authors on request.
Study sample
This study included 403 985 adult patients 
(aged ≥18 years) who had been registered 
with a GP in England on 1 January 2012 
and who were marked by CPRD as having 
acceptable patient and up-to-standard 
practice data in April 2016. Figure 1 shows 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria for 
patients in the study.

 percentages to describe the prevalence of 
multimorbidity. To assess differences by 
sex, age, and SES in the percentage of 
patients with multimorbidity and physical–
mental comorbidity, c2 tests were used. The 
number of morbidities in the sample was 
summarised according to sex, age group 
(based on 10-year cut-off values), and SES 
quintile, using mean figures and standard 
deviations. To assess whether the mean 
number of morbidities differed by sex, a 
t-test was used. For age group and SES, the 
authors used one-way analysis of variance to 
determine whether there was a statistically 
significant difference in the mean number of 
morbidities between groups. 
Health 
service 
utilisation 
was 
summarised 
using 
median 
figures 
and interquartile ranges (IQRs), and the 
proportions of consultations, prescriptions, 
and hospital admissions that occurred 
in patients with multimorbidity were 
calculated. To account for patients who died 
or transferred out after 1 January 2012, 
yearly counts of health service utilisation 
were based on total person time (in months) 
that a participant contributed to the study. 
Negative binomial regression was used 
to investigate the association between the 
presence of multimorbidity and incident 
rates of GP consultations, prescriptions, 
and hospital admissions adjusted for sex, 
age category, SES quintile, and follow-up 
time (months). To account for similarity 
of outcome within practices, statistical 
inference from the negative binomial model 
was based on cluster-robust standard 
errors. All analyses were conducted using 
Stata version 13.1.
RESULTS
Table 1 summarises the demographic 
characteristics 
of 
patients 
included 
in the study and reports the mean 
number of morbidities, prevalence of 
multimorbidity, and prevalence of physical–
mental comorbidity. The prevalence of 
multimorbidity was 27.2% and females 
had significantly higher prevalence of 
multimorbidity than males (30.0% versus 
24.4%, P<0.001). 
Figure 2 shows the prevalence of 
multimorbidity by age and SES; prevalence 
was significantly higher with increased 
age (P<0.001 for all age groups). Greater 
socioeconomic deprivation was associated 
with 
significantly 
higher 
levels 
of 
multimorbidity — 30.0% in the quintile with 
the greatest levels of deprivation versus 
25.8% in that with the lowest (Table 1). 
Of patients in the sample, 9.5% had 
both a physical and a mental morbidity 
(Table 1). The prevalence of physical–
mental comorbidity in patients was 
highest among females (11.9% versus 
7.0%, P<0.001; Table 1) and increased with 
age and greater levels of socioeconomic 
deprivation (Figure 3). Among patients with 
multimorbidity, 33.8% had both a physical 
and a mental morbidity. The majority 
of patients with multimorbidity in the 
18–24- year age group had physical–mental 
comorbidity (56.5%), compared with 23.7% 
of their 75–84-year-old counterparts. The 
proportion of patients with multimorbidity 
who had a physical–mental comorbidity 
increased substantially with greater 
socioeconomic deprivation: 29.5% in the 
quintile with the lowest levels of deprivation 
rose to 41.2% in that with the greatest 
(P<0.001) (Table 1). 
Table 2 shows the prevalence of the 10 
most common individual morbidities, the 
average number of morbidities associated 
with these conditions, and the three most

depression/anxiety (10.3%), and chronic 
pain (10.1%) were the three most common 
individual morbidities. The prevalence of 
all comorbidities in the sample is available 
from the authors on request. 
Health service utilisation
The 
majority 
of 
GP 
consultations, 
prescriptions, and hospital admissions 
were associated with patients with 
multimorbidity. Table 3 summarises 
health service utilisation among patients 
in the study sample. The proportion of 
GP consultations devoted to patients with 
multimorbidity was 52.9%. There was a 
strong association between multimorbidity 
and adjusted yearly rate of GP consultations: 
patients with multimorbidity had 2.56 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 2.48 to 2.64) times 
as many consultations as patients without 
multimorbidity. 
In total, 78.7% of prescriptions were 
given to patients with multimorbidity. 
There was a strong association between 
multimorbidity 
and 
adjusted 
yearly 
rate of total prescriptions: patients with 
multimorbidity had 5.91 (95% CI = 5.71 
to 6.12) times as many prescriptions as 
patients without multimorbidity (Table 3). 
In the sample, 155 488 patients (38.5%) 
were admitted to hospital at least once 
during the 4-year follow-up period; patients 
with multimorbidity accounted for 56.1% 
of these admissions (Table 3). There was a 
strong association between multimorbidity 
and hospital admissions; patients with 
multimorbidity had 2.58 (95% CI = 2.48 to 
2.69) times as many hospitalisations as 
patients without multimorbidity. Essentially, 
one quarter of the population is accounting 
for more than half of health service 
utilisation.
DISCUSSION
Summary
This study found that multimorbidity was 
associated with female sex, increased age, 
and lower SES. Physical–mental comorbidity 
made up a substantial proportion of all 
patients with multimorbidity (33.8%). The 
proportion of patients with multimorbidity 
who have a physical–mental comorbidity is 
higher among females, younger age groups

 (patients aged 18–44 years), and groups with 
greater levels of socioeconomic deprivation. 
Additionally, 
multimorbidity 
was 
highly associated with increased rates 
of GP consultations, prescriptions, and 
hospitalisations, which highlights the 
disproportionately large demand that 
patients with multimorbidity place on the 
UK’s overburdened healthcare system. 
Strengths and limitations 
A strength of this study was its use of a large, 
up-to-date data sample that is representative 
of the English population; there were few 
missing data.13 The code lists used to extract 
information on chronic diseases from the 
database were evaluated by practising GPs, 
utilised or improved previously published 
lists where possible, and are published in full, 
ultimately improving the reproducibility and 
transparency of this type of EHR research. A 
limitation is that, with real clinical data, there 
may be systematic differences in both the 
type and frequency of diagnostic labels that 
GPs and general practice staff document 
in a patient’s medical record. Smaller or 
less-organised practices are less likely to 
participate in CPRD, so it is important to be 
aware that this sample might not be fully 
representative of all types of GP practices 
in England.13 
An additional limitation was that all 
GP consultations, prescriptions, and 
hospitalisations were weighted equally 
as measures of health service utilisation. 
Accounting for duration of consultation, 
frequency of prescriptions, and length of 
hospitalisations would have provided a more 
complete picture of health service utilisation.
Comparison with existing literature
This 
study 
provides 
an 
up-to-date 
and comprehensive description of the 
epidemiology of multimorbidity and health 
service utilisation in England. The authors 
have closely mirrored, but refined where 
necessary, the definitions of individual 
multimorbidity categories used by Barnett 
et al in 2012;4 the specific definition in full 
for each of these morbidity categories is 
available from the authors on request to 
facilitate future research.
The prevalence of multimorbidity in this 
study in England in 2012 (27.2%) was higher 
than in previous studies involving similar 
populations, including Barnett et al’s study 
in Scotland in 2007 (23.2% prevalence)4 and 
Salisbury et al’s study in the UK in 2008 
(16% prevalence), which used only long-
term conditions featured in the QOF.3 The 
higher prevalence in the study presented 
here may be attributable to differences in the 
definitions of multimorbidity and the codes 
used to identify patients with multimorbidity, 
as well as to increases in diagnosis and 
coding within clinical practice. However, it 
may also suggest that further increases 
in the prevalence of multimorbidity has 
occurred in England in recent years. 
The 
study 
presented 
here 
also 
demonstrates and describes a strong 
association 
between 
multimorbidity 
and overall health service utilisation, 
which 
is 
consistent 
with 
previous 
studies demonstrating a strong link with 
prescriptions,16 
consultations,17 
and 
admissions12 individually. 
Implications for research and practice 
How health services are designed to care for 
patients with multimorbidity should take into 
consideration demographic factors, such as 
age and socioeconomic deprivation. This 
study found that in the younger age groups 
most of those with multimorbidity had both 
a physical and mental comorbidity. Similarly, 
those patients with the greatest levels of 
socioeconomic deprivation also had higher 
rates of physical–mental comorbidities. 
These data suggest that when GPs are 
caring for younger and poorer patients with 
multimorbidity, they should think about the 
intersection between physical and mental 
health morbidities. By comparison, when 
caring for older patients with multimorbidity, 
the sheer number of morbidities is more 
likely to define those patients’ healthcare 
needs. 
The Five Year Forward View called for 
a reorganisation of the NHS to support 
people with multiple health conditions, 
not just single diseases.18 This study has 
provided yet more evidence of the pressing 
need to fulfil this ambition at a time when 
general practice workload,7 prescribing,16 
and hospital admissions19 continue to climb 
at alarmingly rapid rates. As the majority 
of healthcare encounters are now with 
patients with multimorbidity, all health 
professionals must be trained to manage 
the cumulative effects of more than one 
chronic condition. Many ‘single-disease’ 
services in primary and secondary care will 
need to be redesigned to treat patients with 
multiple morbidities.
